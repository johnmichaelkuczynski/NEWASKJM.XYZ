THE 
STARRY 
MESSENGER 



Translated 
by 
Edward 
Stafford 
Carlos 


The 
Oxford 
English 
Dictionary 
defines 
genius 
(noun) 
as 
the 
“innate 
intellectual 
or 
creative 
power 
of 
an 
exceptional 
or 
exalted 
type, 
such 
as 
is 
attributed 
to 
those 
people 
considered 
greatest 
in 
any 
area 
of 
art, 
science, 
etc.; 
instinctive 
and 
extraordinary 
capacity 
for 
imaginative 
creation, 
original 
thought, 
invention, 
or 
discovery”. 
The 
modern 
media, 
with 
their 
love 
of 
superlatives, 
have 
devalued 
this 
term, 
but 
its 
original 
meaning 
remains 
unsullied 
in 
academic 
circles. 
There 
are 
few 
genii 
in 
our 
history, 
but 
perhaps 
the 
first 
that 
is 
universally 
recognised 
was 
Leonardo 
da 
Vinci 
(15th 
April 
1452 
– 
2nd 
May 
1519): 
a 
true 
genius 
and 
polymath 
– 
scientist, 
artist, 
inventor 
-with 
footprints 
in 
almost 
all 
areas 
of 
academic 
endeavour 
– 
including 
painting, 
sculpture, 
architecture, 
music, 
literature, 
science, 
mathematics, 
engineering, 
anatomy, 
geology, 
astronomy, 
botany, 
writing, 
history, 
and 
even 
map 
making. 
He 
was 
the 
archetype 
of 
Renaissance 
man. 
A 
century 
later, 


8th 


another 
genius 
was 
born 
in 
Italy 
-Galileo 
Galilei 
(15th 
February 
1564 
– 
January 
1642; 
see 
Figure 
1) 
-astronomer, 
physicist, 
engineer, 
philosopher 
and 
mathematician. 
Albert 
Einstein 
and 
Stephen 
Hawking 
– 
two 
modern 
genii 
-credit 
him 
with 
being 
the 
progenitor 
of 
modern 
science, 
and 
his 
work 
had 
aprofoundinfluence 
onSir 
Isaac 
Newton, 
laying 
the 
basis 
ofhis 
Lawsof 
Motion,andlaterEinstein’sTheoryof 
Special 
Relativity. 


Galileo’s 
first 
landmark 
book 
was 
published, 
in 
Latin, 
in 
1610 
(see 
Figure 
2), 
revolutionising 
the 
science 
of 
astronomy. 
It 
was 
entitled 
Sidereus 
Nuncius: 
this 
is 
translated 
variously 
as 
Sidereal 
Messenger 
(see 
Figure 
3), 
Starry 
Messenger, 
or 
Sidereal 
Message 
(the 
most 
accurate 
translation). 
It 
was 
the 
first 
astronomical 
book 
based 
on 
observations 
made 
with 
a 
telescope, 
and 
included 
studies 
of 
the 
moon, 
and 
of 
hundreds 
of 
previously 
unobserved 
stars. 
Galileo 
built 
his 
own 
telescope 
for 
this 
study, 
improving 
on 
the 
design 
available 
at 
the 
time. 
His 
observations 
of 
the 
moon 
(Figure 
4) 
resulted 
in 
his 
deducing 
the 
existence 
of 
mountains 
and 
valleys 
on 
the 
lunar 
surface. 
His 
observations 
of 
the 
stars, 
especially 
the 
constellations 
of 
Orion 
(Figure 
5) 
and 
the 
Pleiades 
(Figure 
6) 
resulted 
in 
the 
number 
of 
observable 
stars 
being 
up 
to 



ten 
times 
the 
number 
previously 
observed. 
He 
also 
examined 
the 
Milky 
Way, 
and 
his 
comments, 
reproduced 
here, 
are 
both 
elegant 
and 
perceptive. 
“I 
have 
observed 
the 
essence 
or 
substance 
of 
the 
MILKY 
WAY 
circle. 
By 
the 
aid 
of 
a 
telescope 
anyone 
may 
behold 
this 
in 
a 
manner 
which 
so 
distinctly 
appeals 
to 
the 
senses 
that 
all 
the 
disputes 
which 
have 
tormented 
philosophers 
through 
somany 
ages 
are 
exploded 
at 
onceby 
the 
unquestionable 
evidence 
of 
our 
eyes, 
and 
we 
are 
freed 
from 
wordy 
disputes 
upon 
this 
subject, 
for 
the 
GALAXY 
is 
nothing 
else 
but 
a 
mass 
of 
innumerable 
stars 
planted 
together 
in 
clusters. 
Upon 
whatever 
part 
of 
it 
you 
direct 
the 
telescope 
straightway 
a 
vast 
crowd 
of 
stars 
presents 
itself 
to 
view; 
many 
of 
them 
are 
tolerably 
large 
and 
extremely 
bright, 
but 
the 
number 
of 
small 
ones 
is 
quite 
beyond 
determination.” 


Another 
key 
feature 
of 
this 
landmark 
volume 
is 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
moons 
of 
Jupiter, 
which 
Galileo 
referred 
to 
as 
“Medicean 
Stars”, 
named 
for 
the 
four 
Medici 
brothers. 
He 
wrote: 
“I 
therefore 
concluded, 
and 
decided 
unhesitatingly, 
that 
there 
are 
three 
stars 
in 
the 
heavens 
moving 
about 
Jupiter, 
as 
Venus 
and 
Mercury 
round 
the 
Sun; 
which 
at 
length 
was 
established 
as 
clear 
as 
daylight 
by 
numerous 
other 
subsequent 
observations. 
These 
observations 
also 
established 
that 
there 
are 
not 
only 
three, 
but 
four, 
erratic 
sidereal 
bodies 
performing 
their 
revolutions 
round 
Jupiter, 
observations 
of 
whose 
changes 
of 
position 
made 
with 
more 
exactness 
on 
succeeding 
nights.” 
They 
are 
now 
known 
as 
“Galilean 
moons”, 
and 
named 
Io, 
Europa, 
Ganymede, 
and 
Callisto 
(all 
lovers 
of 
Zeus, 
or 
Jupiter) 
by 
Simon 
Marius 
(whoindependentlydiscoveredthema 
fewdaysafter 
Galileo). 


And 
so 
the 
seeds 
were 
sown. 
Enlightened 
scientists, 
philosophers 
and 
artists 
greeted 
Sidereus 
Nuncius 
with 
acclaim. 
But 
many 
rejected 
the 
findings, 
ascribing 
them 
to 
lens 
defects 
in 
the 
telescope, 
and 
denied 
the 
existence 
of 
Jupiter’s 
moons. 
Independent 
verification 
of 
Galileo’s 
observations 
soon 
followed, 
confirming 
his 
conclusions 
that 
four 
moons 
orbitedJupiter. 


Naming 
the 
moons 
after 
the 
Medici 
brothers 
moved 
the 
content 
of 
the 
book 
from 
scientific 
discourse 
to 
a 
political 
issue. 
Moreover, 
this 
book 
challenged 
the 
Church’s 
position 
– 
the 
proof 
that 
the 
Milky 
Way 
consisted 
of 
a 
multitude 
of 
stars, 
and 
not 
“the 
fiery 
exhalation 
of 
stars” 
(the 
Aristotelian 
view), 
that 
Earth’s 
moon 
was 
not 
a 
perfect 
sphere, 
and 
his 
belief 
in 
the 
absolute 
truth 
of 
the 
Copernican 
heliocentric 
system 
(already 
downgraded 
to 
a 
hypothesis 
bythe 
Church)wereallseentochallengescripture. 



In 
the 
current 
post-truth 
(relating 
to, 
or 
denoting, 
circumstances 
in 
which 
objective 
facts 
are 
less 
influential 
in 
shaping 
public 
opinion 
than 
appeals 
to 
emotion 
and 
personal 
belief) 
era, 
we 
see 
a 
parallel 
for 
Galileo’s 
situation. 
In 
contradiction 
to 
the 
compelling 
weight 
of 
scientific 
evidence, 
in 
1616 
or 
2016, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
ignore 
or 
arbitrarily 
select 
data 
and 
arguments, 
and 
come 
to 
whatever 
conclusion 
you 
desire. 
Post-truth, 
then 
as 
now, 
is 
a 
weapon 
of 
ignorance 
and 
superstition, 
wielded 
by 
unscrupulous 
politicians 
and 
religious 
leaders. 
Whether 
it 
is 
a 
Church 
unwilling 
to 
accept 
a 
heliocentric 
system, 
creationists, 
or 
climate-change 
deniers,

PREFATORY 
NOTE. 


About 
five 
years 
ago 
I 
was 
engaged 
in 
preparing 
a 
catalogue 
of 
the 
ancient 
books 
which 
belong 
to 
Christ’s 
Hospital. 
One 
portion 
of 
these 
books 
consisted 
of 
a 
collection 
of 
ancient 
mathematical 
works 
presented 
at 
various 
times 
for 
the 
use 
of 
that 
part 
of 
the 
school 
which 
is 
known 
as 
the 
Royal 
Mathematical 
Foundation 
of 
King 
Charles 
II. 
Amongst 
them 
were 
some 
well 
known 
by 
name 
to 
every 
mathematical 
student, 
but 
which 
few 
have 
ever 
seen. 
Perhaps 
the 
most 
interesting 
of 
them 
all 
was 
a 
little 
volume, 
printed 
in 
London 
in 
1653, 
containing 
Gassendi’s 
Explanation 
of 
the 
Ptolemaic 
and 
Copernican 
Systems 
of 
Astronomy, 
as 
well 
as 
that 
of 
Tycho 
Brahe, 
Galileo’s 
Sidereus 
Nuncius, 
and 
Kepler’s 
Dioptrics. 
I 
found 
Galileo’s 
account 
of 
his 
astronomical 
discoveries 
so 
interesting, 
both 
in 
matter 
and 
in 
style, 
that 
I 
translated 
it 
as 
a 
recreation 
from 
school-work. 
I 
venture 
to 
think 
that 
others 
also 
will 
be 
interested 
in 
following 
Galileo 
through 
the 
apprehension 
of 
his 
famous 
discoveries, 
and 
in 
reading 
the 
language 
in 
which 
he 
announced 
them. 



INTRODUCTION. 


In 
1609, 
Galileo, 
then 
Professor 
of 
Mathematics 
at 
Padua, 
in 
the 
service 
of 
the 
Venetian 
Republic, 
heard 
from 
a 
correspondent 
at 
Paris 
of 
the 
invention 
of 
a 
telescope, 
and 
set 
to 
work 
to 
consider 
how 
such 
an 
instrument 
could 
be 
made. 
The 
result 
was 
his 
invention 
of 
the 
telescope 
known 
by 
his 
name, 
and 
identical 
in 
principle 
with 
the 
modern 
opera-glass. 
In 
a 
maritime 
and 
warlike 
State, 
the 
advantages 
to 
be 
expected 
from 
such 
an 
invention 
were 
immediately 
recognised, 
and 
Galileo 
was 
rewarded 
witha 
confirmation 
of 
his 
Professorship 
for 
life, 
anda 
handsome 
stipend, 
in 
recognition 
of 
his 
invention 
and 
construction 
of 
the 
first 
telescope 
seen 
at 
Venice. 
In 
his 
pamphlet, 
The 
Sidereal 
Messenger, 
here 
translated, 
Galileo 
relates 
how 
he 
came 
to 
learn 
the 
value 
of 
the 
telescope 
for 
astronomical 
research; 
and 
how 
his 
observations 
were 
rewarded 
by 
numerous 
discoveries 
in 
rapid 
succession, 
and 
at[viii] 
length 
by 
that 
of 
Jupiter’s 
satellites. 
Galileo 
at 
once 
saw 
the 
value 
of 
this 
discovery 
as 
bearing 
upon 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Copernican 
system 
of 
astronomy, 
which 
had 
met 
with 
slight 
acceptance, 
and 
indeed 
as 
yet 
had 
hardly 
any 
recommendation 
except 
that 
of 
greater 
simplicity. 
Kepler 
had 
just 
published 
at 
Prague 
his 
work 
on 
the 
planet 
Mars 
(Commentaria 
de 
motibus 
Stellæ 
Martis), 
on 
which 
he 
had 
been 
engaged 
apparently 
for 
eight 
years; 
there 
he 
heard 
of 
Galileo’s 
discoveries, 
and 
at 
length 
was 
invited 
by 
Galileo 
himself, 
through 
a 
common 
friend, 
Giuliano 
de’ 
Medici, 
ambassador 
of 
the 
Grand-Duke 
of 
Tuscany, 
Cosmo 
de’ 
Medici 
II., 
to 
the 
Emperor 
Rudolph 
II., 
to 
correspond 
with 
Galileo 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
these 
discoveries. 
The 
Emperor 
also 
requested 
his 
opinion, 
and 
Kepler 
accordingly 
examined 
Galileo’s 
Sidereal 
Messenger 
in 
a 
pamphlet, 
entitled 
A 
Discussion 
with 
the 
Sidereal 
Messenger 
(Florence,1610). 


In 
this 
Discussion 
Kepler 
gives 
reasons 
for 
accepting 
Galileo’s 
observations 
— 
although 
he 
was 
not 
able 
to 
verify 
them 
from 
want 
of 
a 
telescope 
— 
and 
entirely 
supports 
Galileo’s 
views 
and 
conclusions, 
adducing 
hisown 
previousspeculations,or 
pointingout, 
asinthecase 
ofGalileo’sidea 
of 
earth-light 
on 
the 
moon, 
the 
previous 
conception 
of 
the 
same 
explanation 
of 
the 
phenomenon. 
He 
rejects, 
however, 
Galileo’s 
explanation 
of 
the 
copper 
colour 
of 
the 
moon 
in 
eclipses. 
Kepler 
ends 
by 
expressing 
unbounded 
enthusiasm 
at 
the 
discovery 
of 
Jupiter’s 
satellites, 
and 
the 
argument 
it 
furnishesinsupportoftheCopernicantheory. 



Soon 
after, 
in 
1611, 
Kepler 
published 
another 
pamphlet, 
his 
Narrative, 
giving 
an 
account 
of 
actual 
observations 
made 
in 
verification 
of 
Galileo’s 
discoveries 
by 
himself 
and 
several 
friends, 
whose 
names 
he 
gives, 
with 
a 
telescope 
made 
by 
Galileo, 
and 
belonging 
to 
Ernest, 
Elector 
and 
Archbishop 
of 
Cologne. 
Kepler 
and 
his 
friends 
saw 
the 
lunar 
mountains 
and 
three 
of 
the 
satellites 
of 
Jupiter, 
but 
failed 
to 
make 
out 
any 
signs 
of 
the 
ring 
of 
Saturn 
correspondingto 
theimperfectdescriptionofGalileo. 


Kepler 
had 
previously 
published 
a 
treatise 
on 
Optics 
(Frankfort, 
1604). 
He 
now 
extended 
it 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
telescope, 
and 
explained 
the 
principle 
of 
Galileo’s 
telescope; 
he 
also 
showed 
another 
combination 
of 
lenses 
which 
would 
produce 
a 
similar 
effect. 
This 
was 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
common 
astronomical 
telescope, 
often 
called, 
from 
this 
circumstance, 
Kepler’s 
telescope, 
though 
he 
did 
not 
construct 
it. 
The 
account 
of 
Galileo’s 
later 
astronomical 
discoveries 
of 
Saturn’s 
ring 
and 
the 
phases 
of 
Venus 
is 
taken 
from 
the 
preface 
of 
this 
work. 
— 
(Kepler’s 
Dioptrics; 
Augsburg,1611.) 


In 
1612 
Galileo 
published 
a 
series 
of 
observations 
of 
solar 
spots, 
and 
in 
1618 
some 
observations 
of 
three 
comets. 
There 
exist 
also 
long 
series 
of 
minute 
observations 
of 
Jupiter 
and 
his 
satellites, 
continued 
to 
November 
1619. 
— 
(Galileo’s 
Works;Florence,1845.) 


Further 
astronomical 
researches 
may 
have 
been 
hindered 
by 
failing 
sight. 
One 
more 
astronomical 
discovery, 
however, 
that 
of 
the 
moon’s 
librations, 
was 
made 
as 
late 
as 
1637, 
and 
the 
announcement 
of 
it 
is 
dated 
“dalla

THERE 
is 
certainly 
something 
very 
noble 
and 
large-minded 
in 
the 
intention 
of 
those 
who 
have 
endeavoured 
to 
protect 
from 
envy 
the 
noble 
achievements 
of 
distinguished 
men, 
and 
to 
rescue 
their 
names, 
worthy 
of 
immortality, 
from 
oblivion 
and 
decay. 
This 
desire 
has 
given 
us 
the 
lineaments 
of 
famous 
men, 
sculptured 
in 
marble, 
or 
fashioned 
in 
bronze, 
as 
a 
memorial 
of 
them 
to 
future 
ages; 
to 
the 
same 
feeling 
we 
owe 
the 
erection 
of 
statues, 
both 
ordinary 
and 
equestrian; 
hence, 
as 
the 
poet1 
says, 
has 
originated 
expenditure, 
mounting 
to 
the 
stars, 
upon 
columns 
and 
pyramids; 
with 
this 
desire, 
lastly, 
cities 
have 
been 
built, 
and 
distinguished 
by 
the 
names 
of 
those 
men, 
whom 
the 
gratitude 
of 
posterity 
thought 
worthy 
of 
being 
handed 
down 
to 
all 
ages. 
For 
the 
state 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
is 
such, 
that 
unless 
it 
be 
continually 
stirred 
by 
the 
counterparts2 
of 
matters, 
obtruding 
themselves 
upon 
it 
from 
without, 
all 
recollectionofthematterseasily 
passesawayfromit. 


But 
others, 
having 
regard 
for 
more 
stable 
and 
more 
lasting 
monuments, 
secured 
the 
eternity 
of 
the 
fame 
of 
great 
men 
by 
placing 
it 
under 
the 
protection, 
not 
of 
marble 
or 
bronze, 
but 
of 
the 
Muses’ 
guardianship 
and 
the 
imperishable 
monuments 
of 
literature. 
But 
why 
do 
I 
mention 
these 
things, 
as 
if 
human 
wit, 
content 
with 
these 
regions, 
did 
not 
dare 
to 
advance 
further; 
whereas, 
since 
she 
well 
understood 
that 
all 
human 
monuments 
do 
perish 
at 
last 
by 
violence, 
by 
weather, 
or 
by 
age, 
she 
took 
a 
wider 
view, 
and 
invented 
more 
imperishable 
signs, 
over 
which 
destroying 
Time 
and 
envious 
Age 
could 
claim 
no 
rights; 
so, 
betaking 
herself 
to 
the 
sky, 
she 
inscribed 
on 
the 
well-
known 
orbs 
of 
the 
brightest 
stars 
— 
those 
everlasting 
orbs 
— 
the 
names 
of 
those 
who, 
for 
eminent 
and 
god-like 
deeds, 
were 
accounted 
worthy 
to 
enjoy 
an 
eternity 
in 
company 
with 
the 
stars. 
Wherefore 
the 
fame 
of 
Jupiter, 
Mars, 
Mercury, 
Hercules, 
and 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
heroes 
by 
whose 
names 
the 
stars 
are 
called, 
will 
not 
fade 
until 
the 
extinction 
of 
the 
splendour 
of 
the 
constellations 
themselves. 


But 
this 
invention 
of 
human 
shrewdness, 
so 
particularly 
noble 
and 
admirable, 
has 
gone 
out 
of 
date 
ages 
ago, 
inasmuch 
as 
primeval 
heroes 
are 
in 
possession 
of 
those 
bright 
abodes, 
and 
keep 
them 
by 
a 
sort 
of 
right; 
into 



whose 
company 
the 
affection 
of 
Augustus 
in 
vain 
attempted 
to 
introduce 
Julius 
Cæsar; 
for 
when 
he 
wished 
that 
the 
name 
of 
the 
Julian 
constellation 
should 
be 
given 
to 
a 
star, 
which 
appeared 
in 
his 
time, 
one 
of 
those 
which 
the 
Greeks 
and 
the 
Latins 
alike 
name, 
from 
their 
hair-like 
tails, 
comets, 
it 
vanished 
in 
a 
short 
time 
and 
mocked 
his 
too 
eager 
hope. 
But 
we 
are 
able 
to 
read 
the 
heavens 
for 
your 
highness, 
most 
Serene 
Prince, 
far 
more 
truly 
and 
more 
happily, 
for 
scarcely 
have 
the 
immortal 
graces 
of 
your 
mind 
begun 
to 
shine 
on 
earth, 
when 
bright 
stars 
present 
themselves 
in 
the 
heavens, 
like 
tongues 
to 
tell 
and 
celebrate 
your 
most 
surpassing 
virtues 
to 
all 
time. 
Behold 
therefore, 
four 
stars 
reserved 
for 
your 
famous 
name, 
and 
those 
not 
belonging 
to 
the 
common 
and 
less 
conspicuous 
multitude 
of 
fixed 
stars, 
but 
in 
the 
bright 
ranks 
of 
the 
planets 
— 
four 
stars 
which, 
moving 
differently 
from 
each 
other, 
round 
the 
planet 
Jupiter, 
the 
most 
glorious 
of 
all 
the 
planets, 
as 
if 
they 
were 
his 
own 
children, 
accomplish 
the 
courses 
of 
their 
orbits 
with 
marvellous 
velocity, 
while 
all 
the 
while 
with 
one 
accord 
they 
complete 
all 
together 
mighty 
revolutions 
every 
ten 
years 
round 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
universe, 
that 
is, 
roundtheSun. 


But 
the 
Maker 
of 
the 
Stars 
himself 
seemed 
to 
direct 
me 
by 
clear 
reasons 
to 
assign 
these 
new 
planets 
to 
the 
famous 
name 
of 
your 
highness 
in 
preference 
to 
all 
others. 
For 
just 
as 
these 
stars, 
like 
children 
worthy 
of 
their 
sire, 
never 
leave 
the 
side 
of 
Jupiter 
by 
any 
appreciable 
distance, 
so 
who 
does 
not 
know 
that 
clemency, 
kindness 
of 
heart, 
gentleness 
of 
manners, 
splendour 
of 
royal 
blood, 
noblenessinpublic 
functions, 
wideextentof 
influence 
and 
powerover 
others, 
all 
of 
which 
have 
fixed 
their 
common 
abode 
and 
seat 
in 
your 
highness, 
— 
who, 
I 
say, 
does 
not 
know 
that 
all 
these 
qualities, 
according 
to 
the 
providence 
of 
God, 
from 
whom 
all 
good 
things 
do 
come, 
emanate 
from 
the 
benign 
star 
of 
Jupiter? 
Jupiter, 
Jupiter, 
I 
maintain, 
at 
the 
instant 
of 
the 
birth 
of 
your 
highness 
having 
at 
length 
emerged 
from 
the 
turbid 
mists 
of 
the 
horizon, 
and 
being 
in 
possession 
of 
the 
middle 
quarter 
of 
the 
heavens, 
and 
illuminating 
the 
eastern 
angle, 
from 
his 
own 
royal 
house, 
from 
that 
exalted 
throne, 
looked 
out 
upon 
your 
most 
happy 
birth, 
and 
poured 
forth 
into 
a 
most 
pure 
atmosphere 
all 
the 
brightness 
of 
his 
majesty, 
in 
order 
that 
your 
tender 
body 
and 
your 
mind 
— 
though 
that 
was 
already 
adorned 
by 
God 
with 
still 
more 
splendid 
graces 
— 
might 
imbibe 
with 
your 
first 
breath 
the 
whole 
of 
that 
influence 
and 
power. 
But 
why 
should 
I 
use 
only 
plausible 
arguments 
when 
I 
can 
almost 
absolutely 
demonstrate 
my 
conclusion? 
It 
was 
the 
will 
of 
Almighty 
God 
that 
I 
should 
be 
judged 
by 
your 
most 
serene 
parents 
not 



unworthy 
to 
be 
employed 
in 
teaching 
your 
highness 
mathematics, 
which 
duty 
Idischarged,duringthe 
four 
years 
just 
passed, 
at 
that 
time 
ofthe 
yearwhen 
it 
is 
customary 
to 
take 
a 
relaxation 
from 
severer 
studies. 
Wherefore, 
since 
it 
evidently 
fell 
to 
my 
lot 
by 
God’s 
will, 
to 
serve 
your 
highness, 
and 
so 
to 
receive 
the 
rays 
of 
your 
surpassing 
clemency 
and 
beneficence 
in 
a 
position 
near 
your 
person, 
what 
wonder 
is 
it 
if 
you 
have 
so 
warmed 
my 
heart 
that 
it 
thinks 
about 
scarcely 
anything 
else 
day 
and 
night, 
but 
how 
I, 
who 
am 
indeed 
your 
subject 
not 
only 
by 
inclination, 
but 
also 
by 
my 
very 
birth 
and 
lineage, 
may 
be 
known 
to 
be 
most 
anxious 
for 
your 
glory, 
and 
most 
grateful 
to 
you? 
And 
so, 
inasmuch 
as 
under 
your 
patronage, 
most 
serene 
Cosmo, 
I 
have 
discovered 
these 
stars, 
which 
were 
unknown 
to 
all 
astronomers 
before 
me, 
I 
have, 
with 
very 
good 
right, 
determined 
to 
designate 
them 
with 
the 
most 
august 
name 
of 
your 
family. 
And 
as 
I 
was 
the 
first 
to 
investigate 
them, 
who 
can 
rightly 
blame 
me 
if 
I 
give 
them 
a 
name, 
and 
call 
them 
the 
Medicean 
Stars, 
hoping 
that 
as 
much 
consideration 
may 
accrue 
to 
these 
stars 
from 
this 
title, 
as 
other 
stars 
have 
brought 
to 
other 
heroes? 
For 
not 
to 
speak 
of 
your 
most 
serene 
ancestors, 
to 
whose 
everlasting 
glory 
the 
monuments 
of 
all 
history 
bear 
witness, 
your 
virtue 
alone, 
most 
mighty 
sire, 
can 
confer 
on 
those 
stars 
an 
immortal 
name; 
for 
who 
can 
doubt 
that 
you 
will 
not 
only 
maintain 
and 
preserve 
the 
expectations, 
high 
though 
they 
be, 
about 
yourself, 
which 
you 
have 
aroused 
by 
the 
very 
happy 
beginning 
of 
your 
government, 
but 
that 
you 
will 
also 
far 
surpass 
them, 
so 
that 
when 
you 
have 
conquered 
others 
like 
yourself, 
you 
may 
still 
vie 
with 
yourself, 
and 
become 
day 
by 
day 
greater 
than 
yourself 
andyourgreatness? 


Accept, 
then, 
most 
clement 
Prince, 
this 
addition 
to 
the 
glory 
of 
your 
family, 
reserved 
by 
the 
stars 
for 
you; 
and 
may 
you 
enjoy 
for 
many 
years 
those 
good 
blessings, 
which 
are 
sent 
to 
you 
not 
so 
much 
from 
the

THE 
ASTRONOMICAL 
MESSENGER 


Containing 
and 
setting 
forth 
Observations 
lately 
made 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
a 
newly 
invented 
Telescope 
respecting 
the 
Moon’s 
Surface, 
the 
Milky 
Way, 
Nebulous 
Stars, 
an 
innumerable 
multitude 
of 
Fixed 
Stars, 
and 
also 
respecting 
Four 
Planets 
never 
before 
seen, 
which 
have 
been 
named 


THECOSMIANSTARS.3 


Introduction. 


IN 
the 
present 
small 
treatise 
I 
set 
forth 
some 
matters 
of 
great 
interest 
for 
all 
observers 
of 
natural 
phenomena 
to 
look 
at 
and 
consider. 
They 
are 
of 
great 
interest, 
I 
think, 
first, 
from 
their 
intrinsic 
excellence; 
secondly, 
from 
their 
absolute 
novelty; 
and 
lastly, 
also 
on 
account 
of 
the 
instrument 
by 
the 
aid 
of 
which 
theyhavebeenpresentedtomyapprehension. 


The 
number 
of 
the 
Fixed 
Stars 
which 
observers 
have 
been 
able 
to 
see 
without 
artificial 
powers 
of 
sight 
up 
to 
this 
day 
can 
be 
counted. 
It 
is 
therefore 
decidedly 
a 
great 
feat 
to 
add 
to 
their 
number, 
and 
to 
set 
distinctly 
before 
the 
eyes 
other 
stars 
in 
myriads, 
which 
have 
never 
been 
seen 
before, 
and 
which 
surpasstheold,previouslyknown,starsinnumbermorethanten 
times. 


Again, 
it 
is 
a 
most 
beautiful 
and 
delightful 
sight 
to 
behold 
the 
body 
of 
the 
Moon, 
which 
is 
distant 
from 
us 
nearly 
sixty 
semi-diameters4 
of 
the 
Earth, 
as 
near 
as 
if 
it 
was 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
only 
two 
of 
the 
same 
measures; 
so 
that 
the 
diameter 
of 
this 
same 
Moon 
appears 
about 
thirty 
times 
larger, 
its 
surface 
about 
nine 
hundred 
times, 
and 
its 
solid 
mass 
nearly 
27,000 
times 
larger 
than 
when 
it 
is 
viewed 
only 
with 
the 
naked 
eye; 
and 
consequently 
any 
one 
may 
know 
with 
the 
certainty 
that 
is 
due 
to 
the 
use 
of 
our 
senses, 
that 
the 
Moon 
certainly 
does 
not 
possess 
a 
smooth 
and 
polished 
surface, 
but 
one 
rough 
and 
uneven, 
and, 
just 
like 
the 
face 
of 
the 
Earth 
itself, 
is 
everywhere 
full 
of 
vast 
protuberances,deep 
chasms,and 
sinuosities. 


Then 
to 
have 
got 
rid 
of 
disputes 
about 
the 
Galaxy 
or 
Milky 
Way, 
and 
to 
have 
made 
its 
nature 
clear 
to 
the 
very 
senses, 
not 
to 
say 
to 
the 
understanding, 
seems 
by 
no 
means 
a 
matter 
which 
ought 
to 
be 
considered 
of 
slight 



importance. 
In 
addition 
to 
this, 
to 
point 
out,as 
with 
one’s 
finger,the 
nature 
of 
those 
stars 
which 
every 
one 
of 
the 
astronomers 
up 
to 
this 
time 
has 
called 
nebulous, 
and 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
it 
is 
very 
different 
from 
what 
has 
hitherto 
been 
believed, 
will 
be 
pleasant, 
and 
very 
fine. 
But 
that 
which 
will 
excite 
the 
greatest 
astonishment 
by 
far, 
and 
which 
indeed 
especially 
moved 
me 
to 
call 
the 
attention 
of 
all 
astronomers 
and 
philosophers, 
is 
this, 
namely, 
that 
I 
have 
discovered 
four 
planets, 
neither 
known 
nor 
observed 
by 
any 
one 
of 
the 
astronomers 
before 
my 
time, 
which 
have 
their 
orbits 
round 
a 
certain 
bright 
star, 
one 
of 
those 
previously 
known, 
like 
Venus 
and 
Mercury 
round 
the 
Sun, 
and 
are 
sometimes 
in 
front 
of 
it, 
sometimes 
behind 
it, 
though 
they 
never 
depart 
from 
it 
beyond 
certain 
limits. 
All 
which 
facts 
were 
discovered 
and 
observed 
a 
few 
days 
ago 
by 
the 
help 
of 
a 
telescope5 
devised 
by 
me, 
through 
God’s 
gracefirstenlighteningmy 
mind. 


Perchance 
other 
discoveries 
still 
more 
excellent 
will 
be 
made 
from 
time 
to 
time 
by 
me 
or 
by 
other 
observers, 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
a 
similar 
instrument, 
so 
I 
will 
first 
briefly 
record 
its 
shape 
and 
preparation, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
occasion 
of 
its 
being 
devised, 
and 
then 
I 
will 
give 
an 
account 
of 
the 
observations 
made 
byme. 


Galileo’s 
account 
of 
the 
invention 
of 
his 
telescope. 


About 
ten 
months 
ago 
a 
report 
reached 
my 
ears 
that 
a 
Dutchman 
had 
constructed 
a 
telescope, 
by 
the 
aid 
of 
which 
visible 
objects, 
although 
at 
a 
great 
distance 
from 
the 
eye 
of 
the 
observer, 
were 
seen 
distinctly 
as 
if 
near; 
and 
some 
proofs 
of 
its 
most 
wonderful 
performances 
were 
reported, 
which 
some 
gave 
credence 
to, 
but 
others 
contradicted. 
A 
few 
days 
after, 
I 
received 
confirmation 
of 
the 
report 
in 
a 
letter 
written 
from 
Paris 
by 
a 
noble 
Frenchman, 
Jaques 
Badovere, 
which 
finally 
determined 
me 
to 
give 
myself 
up 
first 
to 
inquire 
into 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
telescope, 
and 
then 
to 
consider 
the 
means 
by 
which 
I 
might 
compass 
the 
invention 
of 
a 
similar 
instrument, 
which 
a 
little 
while 
after 
I 
succeeded 
in 
doing, 
through 
deep 
study 
of 
the 
theory 
of 
Refraction; 
and 
I 
prepared 
a 
tube, 
at 
first 
of 
lead, 
in 
the 
ends 
of 
which 
I 
fitted 
two 
glass 
lenses, 
both 
plane 
on 
one 
side, 
but 
on 
the 
other 
side 
one 
spherically 
convex, 
and 
the 
other 
concave. 
Then 
bringing 
my 
eye 
to 
the 
concave 
lens 
I 
saw 
objects 
satisfactorily 
large 
and 
near, 
for 
they 
appeared 
one-third 
of 
the 
distance 
off 
and 
nine 
times 
larger 
than 
when 
they 
are 
seen 
with 
the 
natural 
eye 
alone. 
I 
shortly 
afterwards 
constructed 
another 
telescope 
with 
more 



nicety, 
which 
magnified 
objects 
more 
than 
sixty 
times. 
At 
length, 
by 
sparing 
neither 
labour 
nor 
expense, 
I 
succeeded 
in 
constructing 
for 
myself 
an 
instrument 
so 
superior 
that 
objects 
seen 
through 
it 
appear 
magnified 
nearly 
a 
thousand 
times, 
and 
more 
than 
thirty 
times 
nearer 
than 
if 
viewed 
by 
the 
naturalpowersof 
sightalone. 


Galileo’s 
first 
observations 
with 
his 
telescope. 


It 
would 
be 
altogether 
a 
waste 
of 
time 
to 
enumerate 
the 
number 
and 
importance 
of 
the 
benefits 
which 
this 
instrument 
may 
be 
expected 
to 
confer, 
when 
used 
by 
land 
or 
sea. 
But 
without 
paying 
attention 
to 
its 
use 
for 
terrestrial 
objects, 
I 
betook 
myself 
to 
observations 
of 
the 
heavenly 
bodies; 
and 
first 
of 
all, 
I 
viewed 
the 
Moon 
as 
near 
as 
if 
it 
was 
scarcely 
two 
semidiameters6 
of 
the 
Earth 
distant. 
After 
the 
Moon, 
I 
frequently 
observed 
other 
heavenly 
bodies, 
both 
fixed 
stars 
and 
planets, 
with 
incredible 
delight; 
and, 
when 
I 
saw 
their 
very 
great 
number, 
I 
began 
to 
consider 
about 
a 
method 
by 
which 
I 
might 
be 
able 
to 
measure 
their 
distances 
apart, 
and 
at 
length 
I 
found 
one. 
And 
here 
it 
is 
fitting 
that 
all 
who 
intend 
to 
turn 
their 
attention 
to 
observations 
of 
this 
kind 
should 
receive 
certain 
cautions. 
For, 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
it 
is 
absolutely 
necessary 
for 
them 
to 
prepare 
a 
most 
perfect 
telescope, 
one 
which 
will 
show 
very 
bright 
objects 
distinct 
and 
free 
from 
any 
mistiness, 
and 
will 
magnify 
thematleast 
400 
times,for 
then 
it 
willshow 
themas 
if 
only 
one-twentieth 
of 
their 
distance 
off. 
For 
unless 
the 
instrument 
be 
of 
such 
power, 
it 
will 
be 
in 
vain 
to 
attempt 
to 
view 
all 
the 
things 
which 
have 
been 
seenby 
meintheheavens,orwhichwillbeenumerated 
hereafter. 


Butinorderthat 
anyonemaybe 
alittlemorecertain 
aboutthemagnifying 
power 
of 
his 
instrument, 
he 
shall 
fashion 
two 
circles, 
or 
two 
square 
pieces 
of 
paper, 
one 
of 
which 
is 
400 
times 
greater 
than 
the 
other, 
but 
that 
will 
be 
when 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
greater 
is 
twenty 
times 
the 
length 
of 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
other. 
Then 
he 
shall 
view 
from 
a 
distance 
simultaneously 
both 
surfaces, 
fixed 
on 
the 
same 
wall, 
the 
smaller 
with 
one 
eye 
applied 
to 
the 
telescope, 
and 
the 
larger 
with 
the 
other 
eye 
unassisted; 
for 
that 
may 
be 
done 
without 
inconvenience 
at 
one 
and 
the 
same 
instant 
with 
both 
eyes 
open. 
Then 
both 
figures 
will 
appear 
of 
the 
same 
size, 
if 
the 
instrument 
magnifies 
objects 
in 
the 
desiredproportion. 


After 
such 
an 
instrument 
has 
been 
prepared, 
the 
Method 
of 
measuring 
small 
angular 
distances 
between 
heavenly 
bodies 
by 
the 
size 
of 
the 
aperture 



of 
the 
telescope.method 
of 
measuring 
distances 
remains 
for 
inquiry, 
and 
this 
weshallaccomplishby 
the 
following 
contrivance: 
— 


For 
the 
sake 
of 
being 
more 
easily 
understood, 
I 
will 
suppose 
a 
tube 
A 
B 
C 


D.7 
Let 
E 
be 
the 
eye 
of 
the 
observer; 
then, 
when 
there 
are 
no 
lenses 
in 
the 
tube 
rays 
from 
the 
eye 
to 
the 
object 
F 
G 
would 
be 
drawn 
in 
the 
straight 
lines 
E 
C 
F, 
E 
D 
G, 
but 
when 
the 
lenses 
have 
been 
inserted, 
let 
the 
rays 
go 
in 
the 
bent 
lines 
E 
C 
H, 
E 
D 
I, 
— 
for 
they 
are 
contracted, 
and 
those 
which 
originally, 
when 
unaffected 
by 
the 
lenses, 
were 
directed 
to 
the 
object 
F 
G, 
will 
include 
only 
the 
part 
H 
I. 
Hence 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
distance 
E 
H 
to 
the 
line 
H 
I 
being 
known, 
we 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
find, 
by 
means 
of 
a 
table 
of 
sines, 
the 
magnitude 
of 
the 
angle 
subtended 
at 
the 
eye 
by 
the 
object 
H 
I, 
which 
we 
shall 
find 
to 
contain 
only 
some 
minutes. 
But 
if 
we 
fit 
on 
the 
lens 
C 
D 
thin 
plates 
of 
metal, 
pierced, 
some 
with 
larger, 
others 
with 
smaller 
apertures, 
by 
putting 
on 
over 
the 
lens 
sometimes 
one 
plate, 
sometimes 
another, 
as 
may 
be 
necessary, 
we 
shall 
construct 
at 
our 
pleasure 
different 
subtending 
angles 
of 
more 
or 
fewer 
minutes, 
by 
the 
help 
of 
which 
we 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
measure 
conveniently 
the 
intervals 
between 
stars 
separated 
by 
an 
angular 
distance 
of 
some 
minutes, 
within 
anerror 
of 
one 
ortwo 
minutes. 
Butlet 
it 
sufficeforthe 
presentto 
have 
thus 
slightly 
touched, 
and 
as 
it 
were 
just 
put 
our 
lips 
to 
these 
matters, 
for 
on 
some 
other 
opportunity 
I 
will 
publish 
the 
theory 
of 
this 
instrument 
in 
completeness. 
Now 
let 
me 
review 
the 
observations 
made 
by 
me 
during 
the 
two 
months 
just 
past, 
again 
inviting 
the 
attention 
of 
all 
who 
are 
eager 
for 
true 
philosophy 
tothebeginningswhich 
ledtothesightofmost 
important 
phenomena. 


The 
Moon. 
Ruggedness 
of 
its 
surface. 
Existence 
of 
lunar 
mountains 
and 
valleys. 
Let 
me 
speak 
first 
of 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
Moon, 
which 
is 
turned 
towards 
us. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
being 
understood 
more 
easily, 
I 
distinguish 
two 
parts 
in 
it, 
which 
I 
call 
respectively 
the 
brighter 
and 
the 
darker. 
The 
brighter 
part 
seems 
to 
surround 
and 
pervade 
the 
whole 
hemisphere; 
but 
the 
darker 
part, 
like 
a 
sort 
of 
cloud, 
discolours 
the 
Moon’s 
surface 
and 
makes 
it 
appear 
covered 
with 
spots. 
Now 
these 
spots, 
as 
they 
are 
somewhat 
dark 
and 
of 
considerable 
size, 
are 
plain 
to 
every 
one, 
and 
every 
age 
has 
seen 
them, 
wherefore 
I 
shall 
call 
them 
great 
or 
ancient 
spots, 
to 
distinguish 
them 
from 
other 
spots, 
smaller 
in 
size, 
but 
so 
thickly 
scattered 
that 
they 
sprinkle 
the 
whole 
surface 
of 
the 
Moon, 
but 
especially 
the 
brighter 
portion 
of 
it. 
These 
spots 
have 
never 
been 
observed 
by 
any 
one 
before 
me; 
and 
from 
my 



observations 
of 
them, 
often 
repeated, 
I 
have 
been 
led 
to 
that 
opinion 
which 
I 
have 
expressed, 
namely, 
that 
I 
feel 
sure 
that 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
Moon 
is 
not 
perfectly 
smooth, 
free 
from 
inequalities 
and 
exactly 
spherical, 
as 
a 
large 
school 
of 
philosophers 
considers 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
Moon 
and 
the 
other 
heavenly 
bodies, 
but 
that, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
it 
is 
full 
of 
inequalities, 
uneven, 
full 
of 
hollows 
and 
protuberances, 
just 
like 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
Earth 
itself, 
which 
isvaried

The 
appearances 
from 
which 
we 
may 
gather 
these 
conclusions 
are 
of 
the 
following 
nature: 
— 
On 
the 
fourth 
or 
fifth 
day 
after 
new-moon, 
when 
the 
Moon 
presents 
itself 
to 
us 
with 
bright 
horns, 
the 
boundary 
which 
divides 
the 
part 
in 
shadow 
from 
the 
enlightened 
part 
does 
not 
extend 
continuously 
in 
an 
ellipse, 
as 
would 
happen 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
perfectly 
spherical 
body, 
but 
it 
is 
marked 
out 
by 
an 
irregular, 
uneven, 
and 
very 
wavy 
line, 
as 
represented 
in 
the 
figure 
given, 
for 
several 
bright 
excrescences, 
as 
they 
may 
be 
called, 
extend 
beyond 
the 
boundary 
of 
light 
and 
shadow 
into 
the 
dark 
part, 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
pieces 
of 
shadow 
encroach 
upon 
the 
light: 
— 
nay, 
even 
a 
great 
quantity 
of 
small 
blackish 
spots, 
altogether 
separated 
from 
the 
dark 
part, 
sprinkle 
everywhere 
almost 
the 
whole 
space 
which 
is 
at 
the 
time 
flooded 
with 
the 



Sun’s 
light, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
that 
part 
alone 
which 
is 
occupied 
by 
the 
great 
and 
ancient 
spots. 
I 
have 
noticed 
that 
the 
small 
spots 
just 
mentioned 
have 
this 
common 
characteristic 
always 
and 
in 
every 
case, 
that 
they 
have 
the 
dark 
part 
towards 
the 
Sun’s 
position, 
and 
on 
the 
side 
away 
from 
the 
Sun 
they 
have 
brighter 
boundaries, 
as 
if 
they 
were 
crowned 
with 
shining 
summits. 
Now 
we 
have 
an 
appearance 
quite 
similar 
on 
the 
Earth 
about 
sunrise, 
when 
we 
behold 
the 
valleys, 
not 
yet 
flooded 
with 
light, 
but 
the 
mountains 
surrounding 
them 
on 
the 
side 
opposite 
to 
the 
Sun 
already 
ablaze 
with 
the 
splendour 
of 
his 
beams; 
and 
just 
as 
the 
shadows 
in 
the 
hollows 
of 
the 
Earth 
diminish 
in 
size 
as 
the 
Sun 
rises 
higher, 
so 
also 
these 
spots 
on 
the 
Moon 
lose 
their 
blackness 
as 
the 
illuminated 
part 
grows 
larger 
and 
larger. 
Again, 
not 
only 
are 
the 
boundaries 
of 
light 
and 
shadow 
in 
the 
Moon 
seen 
to 
be 
uneven 
and 
sinuous, 
but 
— 
and 
this 
produces 
still 
greater 
astonishment 
— 
there 
appear 
very 
many 
bright 
points 
within 
the 
darkened 
portion 
of 
the 
Moon, 
altogether 
divided 
and 
broken 
off 
from 
the 
illuminated 
tract, 
and 
separated 
from 
it 
by 
no 
inconsiderable 
interval, 
which, 
after 
a 
little 
while, 
gradually 
increase 
in 
size 
and 
brightness, 
and 
after 
an 
hour 
or 
two 
become 
joined 
on 
to 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
bright 
portion, 
now 
become 
somewhat 
larger; 
but 
in 
the 
meantime 
others, 
one 
here 
and 
another 
there, 
shooting 
up 
as 
if 
growing, 
are 
lighted 
up 
within 
the 
shaded 
portion, 
increase 
in 
size, 
and 
at 
last 
are 
linked 
on 
to 
the 
same 
luminous 
surface, 
now 
still 
more 
extended. 
An 
example 
of 
this 
is 
given 
in 
the 
same 
figure. 
Now, 
is 
it 
not 
the 
case 
on 
the 
Earth 
before 
sunrise, 
that 
while 
the 
level 
plain 
is 
still 
in 
shadow, 
the 
peaks 
of 
the 
most 
lofty 
mountains 
are 
illuminated 
by 
the 
Sun’s 
rays? 
After 
a 
little 
while 
does 
not 
the 
light 
spread 
further, 
while 
the 
middle 
and 
larger 
parts 
of 
those 
mountains 
are 
becoming 
illuminated; 
and 
at 
length, 
when 
the 
Sun 
has 
risen, 
do 
not 
the 
illuminatedpartsof 
the 
plainsandhillsjointogether?The 
grandeur,however, 
of 
such 
prominences 
and 
depressions 
in 
the 
Moon 
seems 
to 
surpass 
both 
in 
magnitude 
and 
extent 
the 
ruggedness 
of 
the 
Earth’s 
surface, 
as 
I 
shall 
hereafter 
show. 
And 
hereI 
cannot 
refrain 
from 
mentioning 
what 
a 
remarkable 
spectacle 
I 
observed 
while 
the 
Moon 
was 
rapidly 
approaching 
her 
first 
quarter, 
a 
representation 
of 
which 
is 
given 
in 
the 
same 
illustration, 
placed 
opposite 
page 
16. 
A 
protuberance 
of 
the 
shadow, 
of 
great 
size, 
indented 
the 
illuminated 
part 
in 
the 
neighbourhood 
of 
the 
lower 
cusp; 
and 
when 
I 
had 
observed 
this 
indentation 
longer, 
and 
had 
seen 
that 
it 
was 
dark 
throughout, 
at 
length, 
after 
about 
two 
hours, 
a 
bright 
peak 
began 
to 
arise 
a 
little 
below 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
depression; 
this 
by 
degrees 
increased, 
and 
presented 
a 



triangular 
shape, 
but 
was 
as 
yet 
quite 
detached 
and 
separated 
from 
the 
illuminated 
surface. 
Soon 
around 
it 
three 
other 
small 
points 
began 
to 
shine, 
until, 
when 
the 
Moon 
was 
just 
about 
to 
set, 
that 
triangular 
figure, 
having 
now 
extended 
and 
widened, 
began 
to 
be 
connected 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
illuminated 
part, 
and, 
still 
girt 
with 
the 
three 
bright 
peaks 
already 
mentioned, 
suddenly 
burstinto 
the 
indentationofshadowlikea 
vastpromontory 
oflight. 


At 
the 
ends 
of 
the 
upper 
and 
lower 
cusps 
also 
certain 
bright 
points, 
quite 
away 
from 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
bright 
part, 
began 
to 
rise 
out 
of 
the 
shadow, 
as 
is 
seendepictedinthesameillustration. 


In 
both 
horns 
also, 
but 
especially 
in 
the 
lower 
one, 
there 
was 
a 
great 
quantity 
of 
dark 
spots, 
of 
which 
those 
which 
are 
nearer 
the 
boundary 
of 
light 
and 
shadow 
appear 
larger 
and 
darker, 
but 
those 
which 
are 
more 
remote 
less 
dark 
and 
more 
indistinct. 
In 
all 
cases, 
however, 
just 
as 
I 
have 
mentioned 
before, 
the 
dark 
portion 
of 
the 
spot 
faces 
the 
position 
of 
the 
Sun’s 
illumination, 
and 
a 
brighter 
edge 
surrounds 
the 
darkened 
spot 
on 
the 
side 
away 
from 
the 
Sun, 
and 
towards 
the 
region 
of 
the 
Moon 
in 
shadow. 
This 
part 
of 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
Moon, 
where 
it 
is 
marked 
with 
spots 
like 
a 
peacock’s 
tail 
with 
its 
azure 
eyes, 
is 
rendered 
like 
those 
glass 
vases 
which, 
through 
being 
plunged 
while 
still 
hot 
from 
the 
kiln 
into 
cold 
water, 
acquire 
a 
crackled 
and 
wavy 
surface, 
from 
which 
circumstance 
they 
are 
commonly 
called 
frosted 
glasses.8 
The 
lunar 
spots 
are 
suggested 
to 
be 
possibly 
seas 
bordered 
by 
ranges 
ofmountains. 


Now 
the 
great 
spots 
of 
the 
Moon 
observed 
at 
the 
same 
time 
are 
not 
seen 
to 
be 
at 
all 
similarly 
broken, 
or 
full 
of 
depressions 
and 
prominences, 
but 
rather 
to 
be 
even 
and 
uniform; 
for 
only 
here 
and 
there 
some 
spaces, 
rather 
brighter 
than 
the 
rest, 
crop 
up; 
so 
that 
if 
any 
one 
wishes 
to 
revive 
the 
old 
opinion 
of 
the 
Pythagoreans, 
that 
the 
Moon 
is 
another 
Earth, 
so 
to 
say, 
the 
brighter 
portion 
may 
very 
fitly 
represent 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
land, 
and 
the 
darker 
the 
expanse 
of 
water. 
Indeed, 
I 
have 
never 
doubted 
that 
if 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
Earth 
were 
seen 
from 
a 
distance, 
when 
flooded 
with 
the 
Sun’s 
rays, 
that 
part 
of 
the 
surface 
which 
is 
land 
would 
present 
itself 
to 
view 
as 
brighter, 
and 
that 
which 
is 
water 
as 
darker 
in 
comparison. 
Moreover, 
the 
great 
spots 
in 
the 
Moon 
are 
seen 
to 
be 
more 
depressed 
than 
the 
brighter 
tracts; 
for 
in 
the 
Moon, 
both 
when 
crescent 
and 
when 
waning, 
on 
the 
boundary 
between 
the 
light 
and 
shadow, 
which 
projects 
in 
some 
places 
round 
the 
great 
spots, 
the 
adjacent 
regions 
are 
always 
brighter, 
as 
I 
have 
noticed 
in 
drawing 
my 
illustrations, 
and 
the 
edges 
of 
the 
spots 
referred 
to 
are 
not 
only 
more 
depressed 
than 
the 



brighter 
parts, 
but 
are 
more 
even, 
and 
are 
not 
broken 
by 
ridges 
or 
ruggednesses. 
But 
the 
brighter 
part 
stands 
out 
most 
near 
the 
spots, 
so 
that 
both 
before 
the 
first 
quarter 
and 
about 
the 
third 
quarter 
also, 
around 
a 
certain 
spot 
in 
the 
upper 
part 
of 
the 
figure, 
that 
is, 
occupying 
the 
northern 
region 
of 
the 
Moon, 
some 
vast 
prominences 
on 
the 
upper 
and 
lower 
sides 
of 
it 
rise 
to 
an 
enormous 
elevation, 
as 
the 
illustrations 
show. 
This 
same 
spot 
before 
the 
third 
quarter 
is 
seen 
to 
be 
walled 
round 
with 
boundaries 
of 
a 
deeper 
shade, 
which 
just 
like 
very 
lofty 
mountain 
summits 
appear 
darker 
on 
the 
side 
away 
from 
the 
Sun, 
and 
brighter 
on 
the 
side 
where 
they 
face 
the 
Sun; 
but 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
cavities 
the 
opposite 
happens, 
for 
the 
part 
of 
them 
away 
from 
the 
Sun 
appears 
brilliant, 
and 
that 
part 
which 
lies 
nearer 
to 
the 
Sun 
dark 
and 
in 
shadow. 
After 
a 
time, 
when 
the 
enlightened 
portion 
of 
the 
Moon’s 
surface 
has 
diminished 
in 
size, 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
whole 
or 
nearly 
so 
of 
the 
spot 
already 
mentioned 
is 
covered 
with 
shadow, 
the 
brighter 
ridges 
of 
the 
mountains 
mount 
high 
above 
the 
shade. 
These 
two 
appearances 
are 
shown 
in 
the 
illustrationswhich 
are 
given. 


Description 
of 
a 
lunar 
crater, 
perhaps 
Tycho.9 
There 
is 
one 
other 
point 
which 
I 
must 
on 
no 
account 
forget, 
which 
I 
have 
noticed 
and 
rather 
wondered 
at. 
It 
is 
this: 
— 
The 
middle 
of 
the 
Moon, 
as 
it 
seems, 
is 
occupied 
by 
a 
certain 
cavity 
larger 
than 
all 
the 
rest, 
and 
in 
shape 
perfectly 
round. 
I 
have 
looked 
at 
this 
depression 
near 
both 
the 
first 
and 
third 
quarters, 
and 
I 
have 
represented 
it 
as 
well 
as 
I 
can 
in 
the 
second 
illustration 
already 
given. 
It 
produces 
the 
same 
appearance 
as 
to 
effects 
of 
light 
and 
shade 
as 
a 
tract 
like 
Bohemia 
would 
produce 
on 
the 
Earth, 
if 
it 
were 
shut 
in 
on 
all 
sides 
by 
very 
lofty 
mountains 
arranged 
on 
the 
circumference 
of 
a 
perfect 
circle; 
for 
the 
tract 
in 
the 
Moon 
is 
walled 
in 
with 
peaks 
of 
such 
enormous 
height 
that 
the 
furthest 
side 
adjacent 
to 
the 
dark 
portion 
of 
the 
Moon 
is 
seen 
bathed 
in 
sunlight 
before 
the 
boundary 
between 
light 
and 
shade 
reaches 
half-way 
across 
the 
circular 
space. 
But 
according 
to 
the 
characteristic 
property 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
spots, 
the 
shaded 
portion 
of 
this 
too 
faces 
the 
Sun, 
and 
the 
bright 
part 
is 
towards 
the 
dark 
side 
of 
the 
Moon, 
which 
for 
the 
third 
time 
I 
advise 
to 
be 
carefully 
noticed 
as 
a 
most 
solid 
proof 
of 
the 
ruggednesses 
and 
unevennesses 
spread 
over 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
bright 
region 
of 
the 
Moon. 
Of 
these 
spots, 
moreover, 
the 
darkest 
are 
always 
those 
which 
are 
near 
to 
the 
boundary-line 
between 
the 
light 
and 
the 
shadow, 
but 
those 
further 
off 
appear 
both 
smaller 
in 
size 
and 
less 
decidedly 
dark; 
so 
that 
at 
length, 
when 
the 
Moon 
at 
opposition 
becomes 



full, 
the 
darkness 
of 
the 
cavities 
differs 
from 
the 
brightness 
of 
the 
prominences 
withasubdued 
andvery 
slight 
difference. 


Reasons 
for 
believing 
that 
there 
is 
a 
difference 
of 
constitution 
in 
various 
parts 
of 
the 
Moon’s 
surface. 


These 
phenomena 
which 
we 
have 
reviewed 
are 
observed 
in 
the 
bright 
tracts 
of 
the 
Moon. 
In 
the 
great 
spots 
we 
do 
not 
see 
such 
differences 
of 
depressions 
and 
prominences 
as 
we 
are 
compelled 
to 
recognise 
in 
the 
brighter 
parts, 
owing 
to 
the 
change 
of 
their 
shapes 
under 
different 
degreesof 
illumination 
by 
the 
Sun’s 
rays 
according 
to 
the 
manifold 
variety 
of 
the 
Sun’s 
position 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
Moon. 
Still, 
in 
the 
great 
spots 
there 
do 
exist 
some 
spaces 
rather 
less 
dark 
than 
the 
rest, 
as 
I 
have 
noted 
in 
the 
illustrations, 
but 
these 
spaces 
always 
have 
the 
same 
appearance, 
and 
the 
depth 
of 
their 
shadow 
is 
neither 
intensified 
nor 
diminished; 
they 
do 
appear 
indeed 
sometimes 
a 
little 
more 
shaded, 
sometimes 
a 
little 
less, 
but 
the 
change 
of 
colour 
is 
very 
slight, 
according 
as 
the 
Sun’s 
rays 
fall 
upon 
them 
more 
or 
less 
obliquely; 
and 
besides, 
they 
are 
joined 
to 
the 
adjacent 
parts 
of 
the 
spots 
with 
a 
very 
gradual 
connection, 
so 
that 
their 
boundaries 
mingle 
and 
melt 
into 
the 
surrounding 
region. 
But 
it 
is 
quite 
different 
with 
the 
spots 
which 
occupy 
the 
brighter 
parts 
of 
the 
Moon’s 
surface, 
for, 
just 
as 
if 
they 
were 
precipitous 
crags 
with 
numerous 
rugged 
and 
jagged 
peaks, 
they 
have 
well-defined 
boundaries 
through 
the 
sharp 
contrast 
of 
light 
and 
shade. 
Moreover, 
inside 
those 
great 
spots 
certain 
other 
tracts 
are 
seen 
brighter 
than 
the 
surrounding 
region, 
and 
some 
of 
them 
very 
bright 
indeed, 
but 
the 
appearance 
of 
these, 
as 
well 
as 
of 
the 
darker 
parts, 
is 
always 
the 
same; 
there 
is 
no 
change 
of 
shape 
or 
brightness 
or 
depth 
of 
shadow, 
sothatitbecomesa 
matterof 
certainty 
and 
beyond 
doubt 
that 
their 
appearance 
is 
owing 
to 
real 
dissimilarity 
of 
parts, 
and 
not 
to 
unevennesses 
only 
in 
their 
configuration, 
changing 
in 
different 
ways 
the 
shadows 
of 
the 
same 
parts 
according 
to 
the 
variations 
of 
their 
illumination 
by 
the 
Sun, 
which 
really 
happens 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
other 
smaller 
spots 
occupying 
the 
brighter 
portion 
of 
the 
Moon, 
for 
day 
by 
day 
they 
change, 
increase, 
decrease, 
or 
disappear, 
inasmuch 
as 
they 
derive 
their 
origin 
only 
fromtheshadows 
ofprominences. 


Explanation 
of 
the 
evenness 
of 
the 
illuminated 
part 
of 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
Moon’s 
orb 
by 
the 
analogy 
of 
terrestrial 
phenomena, 
or 
by 
a 
possible 
lunar 
atmosphere. 
But 
here 
I 
feel 
that 
some 
people 
may 
be 
troubled 
with 



grave 
doubt, 
and 
perhaps 
seized 
with 
a 
difficulty 
so 
serious 
as 
to 
compel 
them 
to 
feel 
uncertain 
about 
the 
conclusion 
just 
explained 
and 
supported 
by 
so 
many 
phenomena. 
For 
if 
that 
part 
of 
the 
Moon’s 
surface 
which 
reflects 
the 
Sun’s 
rays 
most 
brightly 
is 
full 
of 
sinuosities, 
protuberances, 
and 
cavities 
innumerable, 
why, 
when 
the 
Moon 
is 
increasing, 
does 
the 
outer 
edge 
which 
looks 
toward 
the 
west, 
when 
the 
Moon 
is 
waning, 
the 
other 
half-
circumference 
towards 
the 
east, 
and 
at 
full-moon 
the 
whole 
circle, 
appear 
not 
uneven, 
rugged, 
and 
irregular, 
but 
perfectly 
round 
and 
circular, 
as 
sharply 
defined 
as 
if 
marked 
out 
with 
a 
pair 
of 
compasses, 
and 
without 
the 
indentations 
of 
any 
protuberances 
or 
cavities? 
And 
most 
remarkably 
so, 
because 
the 
whole 
unbroken 
edge 
belongs 
to 
that 
part 
of 
the 
Moon’s 
surface 
which 
possesses 
thepropertyofappearing 
brighter 
than 
therest, 
which 
Ihave 
said 
to 
be 
throughout 
full 
of 
protuberances 
and 
cavities. 
For 
not 
one 
of 
the 
Great 
Spots 
extends 
quite 
to 
the 
circumference, 
but 
all 
of 
them 
are 
seen 
to 
be 
together 
away 
from 
the 
edge. 
Of 
thisphenomenon, 
which 
affords 
a 
handle 
for 
such 
serious 
doubt, 
I 
produce 
two 
causes, 
and 
so 
two 
solutions 
of 
the 
difficulty. 


The 
first 
solution 
which 
I 
offer 
is 
this: 
— 
If 
the 
protuberances 
and 
cavities 
in 
the 
body 
of 
the 
Moon 
existed 
only 
on 
the 
edge 
of 
the 
circle 
that 
bounds 
the 
hemisphere 
which 
we 
see, 
then 
the 
Moonmight, 
or 
rather 
must, 
showitself 
to 
us 
with 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
toothed 
wheel, 
being 
bounded 
with 
an 
irregular 
and 
uneven 
circumference; 
but 
if, 
instead 
of 
a 
single 
set 
of 
prominences 
arrangedalongtheactual 
circumferenceonly,verymanyranges 
ofmountains 
with 
their 
cavities 
and 
ruggednesses 
are 
set 
one 
behind 
the 
other 
along 
the 
extreme 
edge 
of 
the 
Moon, 
and 
that 
too 
not 
only 
in 
the 
hemisphere 
which 
we 
see, 
but 
also 
in 
that 
which 
is 
turned 
away 
from 
us, 
but 
still 
near 
the 
boundary 
of 
the 
hemisphere, 
then 
the 
eye, 
viewing 
them 
afar 
off, 
will 
not 
at 
all 
be 
able 
to 
detect 
the 
differences 
of 
prominences 
and 
cavities, 
for 
the 
intervals 
between 
the 
mountains 
situated 
in 
the 
same 
circle, 
or 
in 
the 
same 
chain, 
are 
hidden 
by 
the 
jutting 
forward 
of 
other 
prominences 
situated 
in 
other 
ranges, 
and 
especially 
if 
the 
eye 
of 
the 
observer 
is 
placed 
in 
the 
same 
line 
with 
the 
tops 
oftheprominences 
mentioned. 
So 
ontheEarth,the 
summitsof 
anumber 
of 
mountains 
close 
together 
appear 
situated 
in 
one 
plane, 
if 
the 
spectator 
is 
a 
long 
way 
off 
and 
standing 
at 
the 
same 
elevation. 
So 
when 
the 
sea 
is 
rough, 
the 
tops 
of 
the 
waves 
seem 
to 
form 
one 
plane, 
although 
between 
the 
billows 
there 
is 
many 
a 
gulf 
and 
chasm, 
so 
deep 
that 
not 
only 
the 
hulls, 
but 
even 
the 
bulwarks, 
masts, 
and 
sails 
of 
stately 
ships 
are 
hidden 
amongst 
them. 



Therefore, 
as 
within 
the 
Moon, 
as 
well 
as 
round 
her 
circumference, 
there 
is 
a 
manifold 
arrangement 
of 
prominences 
and 
cavities, 
and 
the 
eye, 
regarding 
them 
from 
a 
great 
distance, 
is 
placed 
in 
nearly 
the 
same 
plane 
with 
their 
summits, 
no 
one 
need 
think 
it 
strange 
that 
they 
present 
themselves 
to 
the 
visual 
ray 
which 
just 
grazes 
them 
as 
an 
unbroken 
line 
quite 
free 
from 
unevennesses. 
To 
this 
explanation 
may 
be 
added 
another, 
namely, 
that 
there 
is 
round 
the 
body 
of 
the 
Moon, 
just 
as 
round 
the 
Earth, 
an 
envelope 
of 
some 
substance 
denser 
than 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
ether, 
which 
is 
sufficient 
to 
receive 
and 
reflect 
the 
Sun’s 
rays, 
although 
it 
does 
not 
possess 
so 
much 
opaqueness 
as 
to 
be 
able 
to 
prevent 
our 
seeing 
through 
it 
— 
especially 
when 
it 
is 
not 
illuminated. 
That 
envelope, 
when 
illuminated 
by 
the 
Sun’s 
rays, 
renders 
the 
body 
of 
the 
Moon 
apparently 
larger 
than 
it 
really 
is, 
and 
would 
be 
able 
to 
stop 
our 
sight 
from 
penetrating 
to 
the 
solid 
body 
of 
the 
Moon, 
if 
its 
thickness 
were 
greater; 
now, 
it 
is 
of 
greater 
thickness 
about 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
Moon, 
greater, 
I 
mean, 
not 
in 
actual 
thickness, 
but 
with 
reference 
to 
our 
sight-rays, 
which 
cut 
it 
obliquely; 
and 
so 
it 
may 
stop 
our 
vision, 
especially 
when 
it 
is 
in 
a 
state 
of 
brightness, 
and 
may 
conceal 
the 
true 
circumference 
of 
theMoononthesidetowardstheSun. 



This 
may 
be 
understood 
more 
clearly 
from 
the 
adjoining 
figure, 
in 
which 
the 
body 
of 
the 
Moon, 
A 
B 
C, 
is 
surrounded 
by 
an 
enveloping 
atmosphere, 
D 
E 
G. 
An 
eye 
at 
F 
penetrates 
to 
the 
middle 
parts 
of 
the 
Moon, 
as 
at 
A, 
through 
a 
thickness, 
D 
A, 
of 
the 
atmosphere; 
but 
towards 
the 
extreme 
parts 
a 
mass 
of 
atmosphere 
of 
greater 
depth, 
E 
B, 
shuts 
out 
its 
boundary 
from 
our 
sight. 
An 
argument 
in 
favour 
of 
this 
is, 
that 
the 
illuminated 
portion 
of 
the 
Moon 
appearsoflargercircumference 
thantherestofthe 
orbwhichis 
inshadow. 


Perhaps 
also 
some 
will 
think 
that 
this 
same 
cause 
affords 
a 
very 
reasonable 
explanation 
why 
the 
greater 
spots 
on 
the 
Moon 
are 
not 
seen 
to 



reach 
to 
the 
edge 
of 
the 
circumference 
on 
any 
side, 
although 
it 
might 
be 
expected 
that 
some 
would 
be 
found 
about 
the 
edge 
as 
well 
as 
elsewhere; 
and 
it 
seems 
credible 
that 
there 
are 
spots 
there, 
but 
that 
they 
cannot 
be 
seen 
because 
they 
are 
hidden 
by 
a 
mass 
of 
atmosphere 
too 
thick 
and 
too 
bright 
for 
thesightto 
penetrate.

The 
faint 
illumination 
of 
the 
Moon’s 
disc 
about 
new-moon 
explained 
to 
be 
due 
to 
earth-light. 


I 
wish 
in 
this 
place 
to 
assign 
the 
cause 
of 
another 
lunar 
phenomenon 
well 
worthy 
of 
notice, 
and 
although 
this 
phenomenon 
was 
observed 
by 
me 
not 
lately, 
but 
many 
years 
ago, 
and 
has 
been 
pointed 
out 
to 
some 
of 
my 
intimate 
friends 
and 
pupils, 
explained, 
and 
assigned 
to 
its 
true 
cause, 
yet 
as 
the 
observation 
of 
it 
is 
rendered 
easier 
and 
more 
vivid 
by 
the 
help 
of 
a 
telescope, 
I 
have 
considered 
that 
it 
would 
not 
be 
unsuitably 
introduced 
in 
this 
place, 
but 
I 
wish 
to 
introduce 
it 
chiefly 
in 
order 
that 
the 
connection 
and 
resemblance 
between 
theMoonandtheEarth 
mayappearmoreplainly. 


When 
the 
Moon, 
both 
before 
and 
after 
conjunction, 
is 
found 
not 
far 
from 
the 
Sun, 
not 
only 
does 
its 
orb 
show 
itself 
to 
our 
sight 
on 
the 
side 
where 
it 
is 
furnished 
with 
shining 
horns, 
but 
a 
slight 
and 
faint 
circumference 
is 
also 
seen 
tomarkoutthecircleofthedarkpart,that 
part,namely, 
whichisturnedaway 
from 
the 
Sun, 
and 
to 
separate 
it 
from 
the 
darker 
background 
of 
the 
sky. 
But 
if 
we 
examine 
the 
matter 
more 
closely, 
we 
shall 
see 
that 
not 
only 
is 
the 
extreme 
edge 
of 
the 
part 
in 
shadow 
shining 
with 
a 
faint 
brightness, 
but 
that 
the 
entire 
face 
of 
the 
Moon, 
that 
side, 
that 
is, 
which 
does 
not 
feel 
the 
Sun’s 
glare, 
is 
illuminated 
with 
a 
pale 
light 
of 
considerable 
brightness. 
At 
the 
first 
glance 
only 
a 
fine 
circumference 
appears 
shining, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
darker 
part 
of 
the 
sky 
adjacent 
to 
it; 
whereas, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
surface 
appears 
dark, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
contiguity 
of 
the 
shining 
horns, 
which 
destroys 
the 
clearness 
of 
our 
sight. 
But 
if 
any 
one 
chooses 
such 
a 
position 
for 
himself, 
that 
by 
the 
interposition 
of 
a 
roof, 
or 
a 
chimney, 
or 
some 
other 
object 
between 
his 



sight 
and 
the 
Moon, 
but 
at 
a 
considerable 
distance 
from 
his 
eye, 
the 
shining 
horns 
are 
hidden, 
and 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
Moon’s 
orb 
is 
left 
exposed 
to 
his 
view, 
then 
he 
will 
find 
that 
this 
tract 
of 
the 
Moon 
also, 
although 
deprived 
of 
sunlight, 
gleams 
with 
considerable 
light, 
and 
particularly 
so 
if 
the 
gloom 
of 
the 
night 
has 
already 
deepened 
through 
the 
absence 
of 
the 
Sun; 
for 
with 
a 
darker 
background 
the 
same 
light 
appears 
brighter. 
Moreover, 
it 
is 
found 
that 
this 
secondary 
brightness 
of 
the 
Moon, 
as 
I 
may 
call 
it, 
is 
greater 
in 
proportion 
as 
the 
Moon 
is 
less 
distant 
from 
the 
Sun; 
for 
it 
abates 
more 
and 
more 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
Moon’s 
distance 
from 
that 
body, 
so 
much 
so 
that 
after 
the 
first 
quarter, 
and 
before 
the 
end 
of 
the 
second, 
it 
is 
found 
to 
be 
weak 
and 
very 
faint, 
although 
it 
be 
observed 
in 
a 
darker 
sky; 
whereas, 
at 
an 
angular 
distance 
of 
60° 
or 
less, 
even 
during 
twilight, 
it 
is 
wonderfully 
bright, 
so 
bright 
indeed 
that, 
with 
the 
help 
of 
a 
good 
telescope, 
the 
great 
spots 
may 
be 
distinguished 
init. 


This 
strange 
brightness 
has 
afforded 
no 
small 
perplexity 
to 
philosophical 
minds; 
and 
some 
have 
published 
one 
thing, 
some 
another, 
as 
the 
cause 
to 
be 
alleged 
for 
it. 
Some 
have 
said 
that 
it 
is 
the 
inherent 
and 
natural 
brightness 
of 
the 
Moon; 
some 
that 
it 
is 
imparted 
to 
that 
body 
by 
the 
planet 
Venus; 
or, 
as 
others 
maintain, 
by 
all 
the 
stars; 
while 
some 
have 
said 
that 
it 
comes 
from 
the 
Sun, 
whose 
rays, 
they 
say, 
find 
a 
way 
through 
the 
solid 
mass 
of 
the 
Moon. 
But 
statements 
of 
this 
kind 
are 
disproved 
without 
much 
difficulty, 
and 
convincingly 
demonstrated 
to 
be 
false. 
For 
if 
this 
kind 
of 
light 
were 
the 
Moon’s 
own, 
or 
were 
contributed 
by 
the 
stars, 
the 
Moon 
would 
retain 
it, 
particularly 
in 
eclipses, 
and 
would 
show 
it 
then, 
when 
left 
in 
an 
unusually 
dark 
sky, 
but 
this 
is 
contrary 
to 
experience. 
For 
the 
brightness 
which 
is 
seen 
on 
the 
Moon 
in 
eclipses 
is 
far 
less 
intense, 
being 
somewhat 
reddish, 
and 
almost 
copper-coloured, 
whereas 
this 
is 
brighter 
and 
whiter; 
besides, 
the 
brightness 
seen 
during 
an 
eclipse 
is 
changeable 
and 
shifting, 
for 
it 
wanders 
over 
the 
face 
ofthe 
Moon,so 
that 
that 
part 
which 
is 
near 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
circle 
of 
shadow 
thrown 
by 
the 
Earth 
is 
bright, 
but 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
Moon 
is 
always 
seen 
to 
be 
dark. 
From 
which 
circumstance 
we 
understand 
without 
hesitation 
that 
this 
brightness 
is 
due 
to 
the 
proximity 
of 
the 
Sun’s 
rays 
coming 
into 
contact 
with 
some 
denser 
region 
which 
surrounds 
the 
Moon 
as 
an 
envelope; 
owing 
to 
which 
contact 
a 
sort 
of 
dawn-light 
is 
diffused 
over 
the 
neighbouring 
regions 
of 
the 
Moon, 
just 
as 
the 
twilight 
spreads 
in 
the 
morning 
and 
evening 
on 
the 
Earth:11 
but 
I 
will 
treat 
more 
fully 
of 
this 
matter 
in 
my 


12 


bookuponthe 
System 
of 
the 
Universe. 



Again, 
to 
assertthat 
this 
sort 
of 
light 
is 
imparted 
to 
the 
Moon 
by 
the 
planet 
Venus 
is 
so 
childish 
as 
to 
beundeserving 
of 
an 
answer;for 
who 
is 
soignorant 
as 
not 
to 
understand 
that 
at 
conjunction 
and 
within 
an 
angular 
distance 
of 
60° 
it 
is 
quite 
impossible 
for 
the 
part 
of 
the 
Moon 
turned 
away 
from 
the 
Sun 
to 
be 
seenby 
theplanetVenus? 


But 
that 
this 
light 
is 
derived 
from 
the 
Sun 
penetrating 
with 
its 
light 
the 
solid 
mass 
of 
the 
Moon, 
and 
rendering 
it 
luminous, 
is 
equally 
untenable. 
For 
then 
this 
light 
would 
never 
lessen, 
since 
the 
hemisphere 
of 
the 
Moon 
is 
always 
illumined 
by 
the 
Sun, 
except 
at 
the 
moment 
of 
a 
lunar 
eclipse, 
yet 
really 
it 
quickly 
decreases 
while 
the 
Moon 
is 
drawing 
near 
to 
the 
end 
of 
her 
first 
quarter, 
and 
when 
she 
has 
passed 
her 
first 
quarter 
it 
becomes 
quite 
dull. 
Since, 
therefore, 
this 
kind 
of 
secondary 
brightness 
is 
not 
inherent 
and 
the 
Moon’s 
own, 
nor 
borrowed 
from 
any 
of 
the 
stars, 
nor 
from 
the 
Sun, 
and 
since 
there 
now 
remains 
in 
the 
whole 
universe 
no 
other 
body 
whatever 
except 
the 
Earth, 
what, 
pray, 
must 
we 
conclude? 
What 
must 
we 
assert? 
Shall 
we 
assert 
that 
the 
body 
of 
the 
Moon, 
or 
some 
other 
dark 
and 
sunless 
orb, 
receives 
light 
from 
the 
Earth?Why 
should 
it 
notbe 
theMoon? 
And 
most 
certainlyitis. 
The 
Earth, 
with 
fair 
and 
grateful 
exchange, 
pays 
back 
to 
the 
Moon 
an 
illumination 
like 
that 
which 
it 
receives 
from 
the 
Moon 
nearly 
the 
whole 
time 
during 
the 
darkest 
gloom 
of 
night. 
Let 
me 
explain 
the 
matter 
more 
clearly. 
At 
conjunction, 
when 
the 
Moon 
occupies 
a 
position 
between 
the 
Sun 
and 
the 
Earth, 
the 
Moon 
is 
illuminated 
by 
the 
Sun’s 
rays 
on 
her 
half 
towards 
the 
Sun 
which 
is 
turned 
away 
from 
the 
Earth, 
and 
the 
other 
half, 
with 
which 
she 
regards 
the 
Earth, 
is 
covered 
with 
darkness, 
and 
so 
in 
no 
degree 
illumines 
the 
Earth’s 
surface. 
When 
the 
Moon 
has 
slightly 
separated 
from 
the 
Sun, 
straightway 
she 
is 
partly 
illumined 
on 
the 
half 
directed 
towards 
us; 
she 
turns 
towards 
us 
a 
slender 
silvery 
crescent, 
and 
slightly 
illumines 
the 
Earth; 
the 
Sun’s 
illumination 
increases 
upon 
the 
Moon 
as 
she 
approaches 
her 
first 
quarter,andthereflexionofthatlightincreaseson 
the 
Earth;thebrightnessin 
the 
Moon 
next 
extends 
beyond 
the 
semicircle, 
and 
our 
nights 
grow 
brighter; 
at 
length 
the 
entire 
face 
of 
the 
Moon 
looking 
towards 
the 
Earth 
is 
irradiated 
with 
the 
most 
intense 
brightness 
by 
the 
Sun, 
which 
happens 
when 
the 
Sun 
and 
Moon 
are 
on 
opposite 
sides 
of 
the 
Earth; 
then 
far 
and 
wide 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
Earth 
shines 
with 
the 
flood 
of 
moonlight; 
after 
this 
the 
Moon, 
now 
waning, 
sends 
out 
less 
powerful 
beams, 
and 
the 
Earth 
is 
illumined 
less 
powerfully; 
at 
length 
the 
Moon 
draws 
near 
her 
first 
position 
of 
conjunction 
with 
the 
Sun, 
and 
forthwith 
black 
night 
invades 
the 
Earth. 
In 
such 
a 
cycle 
the 



moonlight 
gives 
us 
each 
month 
alternations 
of 
brighter 
and 
fainter 
illumination. 
But 
the 
benefit 
of 
her 
light 
to 
the 
Earth 
is 
balanced 
and 
repaid 
by 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
light 
of 
the 
Earth 
to 
her; 
for 
while 
the 
Moon 
is 
found 
near 
the 
Sun 
about 
the 
time 
of 
conjunction, 
she 
has 
in 
front 
of 
her 
the 
entire 
surface 
of 
that 
hemisphere 
of 
the 
Earth 
which 
is 
exposed 
to 
the 
Sun, 
and 
vividly 
illumined 
with 
his 
beams, 
and 
so 
receives 
light 
reflected 
from 
the 
Earth. 
Owing 
to 
such 
reflexion, 
the 
hemisphere 
of 
the 
Moon 
nearer 
to 
us, 
though 
deprived 
of 
sunlight, 
appears 
of 
considerable 
brightness. 
Again, 
when 
removed 
from 
the 
Sun 
through 
a 
quadrant, 
the 
Moon 
sees 
only 
one-half 
of 
the 
Earth’s 
hemisphere 
illuminated, 
namely 
the 
western 
half, 
for 
the 
other, 
the 
eastern, 
is 
covered 
with 
the 
shades 
of 
night; 
the 
Moon 
is, 
therefore, 
less 
brightly 
enlightened 
by 
the 
Earth, 
and 
accordingly 
that 
secondary 
light 
appears 
fainter 
to 
us. 
But 
if 
you 
imagine 
the 
Moon 
to 
be 
set 
on 
the 
opposite 
side 
of 
the 
Earth 
to 
the 
Sun, 
she 
will 
see 
the 
hemisphere 
of 
the 
Earth, 
now 
between 
the 
Moon 
and 
the 
Sun, 
quite 
dark, 
and 
steeped 
in 
the 
gloom 
of 
night; 
if, 
therefore, 
an 
eclipse 
should 
accompany 
such 
a 
position 
of 
the 
Moon, 
she 
will 
receive 
no 
light 
at 
all, 
being 
deprived 
of 
the 
illumination 
of 
the 
Sun 
and 
Earthtogether. 
Inany 
other 
position,withregard 
totheEarth 
andtheSun,the 
Moon 
receives 
more 
or 
less 
light 
by 
reflexion 
from 
the 
Earth, 
according 
as 
she 
sees 
a 
greater 
or 
smaller 
portion 
of 
the 
hemisphere 
of 
the 
Earth 
illuminated 
by 
the 
Sun; 
for 
such 
a 
law 
is 
observed 
between 
these 
two 
orbs, 
that 
at 
whatever 
times 
the 
Earth 
is 
most 
brightly 
enlightened 
by 
the 
Moon, 
at 
those 
times, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
Moon 
is 
least 
enlightened 
by 
the 
Earth; 
and 
contrariwise. 
Let 
these 
few 
words 
on 
this 
subject 
suffice 
in 
this 
place; 
for 
I 
will 
consider 
it 
more 
fully 
in 
my 
System 
of 
the 
Universe, 
where, 
by 
very 
many 
arguments 
and 
experimental 
proofs, 
there 
is 
shown 
to 
be 
a 
very 
strong 
reflexion 
of 
the 
Sun’s 
light 
from 
the 
Earth, 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
those 
who 
urge 
that 
the 
Earth 
must 
be 
separated 
from 
the 
starry 
host, 
chiefly 
for 
the 
reason 
that 
it 
has 
neither 
motion 
nor 
light, 
for 
I 
will 
prove 
that 
the 
Earth 
has 
motion, 
and 
surpasses 
the 
Moon 
in 
brightness, 
and 
is 
not 
the 
place 
where 
the 
dull 
refuse 
of 
the 
universe 
has 
settled 
down; 
and 
I 
will 
support 
my 
demonstration 
byathousandargumentstakenfromnaturalphenomena. 


Stars. 
Their 
appearance 
in 
the 
telescope. 
Hitherto 
I 
have 
spoken 
of 
the 
observations 
which 
I 
have 
made 
concerning 
the 
Moon’s 
body; 
now 
I 
will 
briefly 
announce 
the 
phenomena 
which 
have 
been, 
as 
yet, 
seen 
by 
me 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
Fixed 
Stars. 
And 
first 
of 
all 
the 
following 
fact 
is 
worthy 
of 
consideration: 
— 
The 
stars, 
fixed 
as 
well 
as 
erratic, 
when 
seen 
with 
a 



telescope, 
by 
no 
means 
appear 
to 
be 
increased 
in 
magnitude 
in 
the 
same 
proportionasotherobjects, 
andtheMoonherself,gainincreaseofsize;butin 
the 
case 
of 
the 
stars 
such 
increase 
appears 
much 
less, 
so 
that 
you 
may 
consider 
that 
a 
telescope, 
which 
(for 
the 
sake 
of 
illustration) 
is 
powerful 
enough 
to 
magnify 
other 
objects 
a 
hundred 
times, 
will 
scarcely 
render 
the 
stars 
magnified 
four 
or 
five 
times. 
But 
the 
reason 
of 
this 
is 
as 
follows: 
— 
When 
stars 
are 
viewed 
with 
our 
natural 
eyesight 
they 
do 
not 
present 
themselves 
to 
us 
of 
their 
bare, 
real 
size, 
but 
beaming 
with 
a 
certain 
vividness, 
and 
fringed 
with 
sparkling 
rays, 
especially 
when 
the 
night 
is 
far 
advanced; 
and 
from 
this 
circumstance 
they 
appear 
much 
larger 
than 
they 
would 
if 
they 
were 
stripped 
of 
those 
adventitious 
fringes, 
for 
the 
angle 
which 
they 
subtend 
at 
the 
eye 
is 
determined 
not 
by 
the 
primary 
disc 
of 
the 
star, 
but 
by 
the 
brightness 
which 
so 
widely 
surrounds 
it. 
Perhaps 
you 
will 
understand 
this 
most 
clearly 
from 
the 
well-known 
circumstance 
that 
when 
stars 
rise 
just 
at 
sunset, 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
twilight, 
they 
appear 
very 
small, 
although 
they 
may 
be 
stars 
of 
the 
first 
magnitude; 
and 
even 
the 
planet 
Venus 
itself, 
on 
any 
occasion 
when 
it 
may 
present 
itself 
to 
view 
in 
broad 
daylight, 
is 
so 
small 
to 
see 
that 
it 
scarcely 
seems 
to 
equal 
a 
star 
of 
the 
last 
magnitude. 
It 
is 
different 
in 
the 
case 
of 
other 
objects, 
and 
even 
of 
the 
Moon, 
which, 
whether 
viewed 
in 
the 
light 
of 
midday 
or 
in 
the 
depth 
of 
night, 
always 
appears 
of 
the 
same 
size. 
We 
conclude 
therefore 
that 
the 
stars 
are 
seen 
at 
midnight 
in 
uncurtailed 
glory, 
but 
their 
fringes 
are 
of 
such 
a 
nature 
that 
the 
daylight 
can 
cut 
them 
off, 
and 
not 
only 
daylight, 
but 
any 
slight 
cloud 
which 
may 
be 
interposed 
between 
a 
star 
and 
the 
eye 
of 
the 
observer. 
A 
dark 
veil 
or 
coloured 
glass 
has 
the 
same 
effect, 
for, 
upon 
placing 
them 
before 
the 
eye 
between 
it 
and 
the 
stars, 
all 
the 
blaze 
that 
surrounds 
them 
leaves 
them 
at 
once. 
A 
telescope 
also 
accomplishes 
the 
same 
result, 
for 
it 
removes 
from 
the 
stars 
their 
adventitious 
and 
accidental 
splendours 
before 
it 
enlarges 
their 
true 
discs(if 
indeed 
they 
are 
of 
that 
shape), 
and 
so 
they 
seem 
less 
magnified 
than 
other 
objects, 
for 
a 
star 
of 
the 
fifth 
or 
sixth 
magnitude 
seen 
through 
a 
telescope 
is 
shown 
as 
of 
the 
first 
magnitude 
only. 


The 
difference 
between 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
planets 
and 
the 
fixed 
stars 
seems 
also 
deserving 
of 
notice. 
The 
planets 
present 
their 
discs 
perfectly 
round, 
just 
as 
if 
described 
with 
a 
pair 
of 
compasses, 
and 
appear 
as 
so 
many 
little 
moons, 
completely 
illuminated 
and 
of 
a 
globular 
shape; 
but 
the 
fixed 
stars 
do 
not 
look 
to 
the 
naked 
eye 
bounded 
by 
a 
circular 
circumference, 
but 
rather 
like 
blazes 
of 
light, 
shooting 
out 
beams 
on 
all 
sides 
and 
very 
sparkling, 



and 
with 
a 
telescope 
they 
appear 
of 
the 
same 
shape 
as 
when 
they 
are 
viewed 
by 
simply 
looking 
at 
them, 
but 
so 
much 
larger 
that 
a 
star 
of 
the 
fifth 
or 
sixth

Telescopic

their 
infinite 
multitude. 
As 
examples, 
Orion’s 
Belt 
and 
Sword 
and 
the 
Pleiades 
are 
described 
as 
seen 
by 
Galileo. 


But 
beyond 
the 
stars 
of 
the 
sixth 
magnitude 
you 
will 
behold 
through 
the 
telescope 
a 
host 
of 
other 
stars, 
which 
escape 
the 
unassisted 
sight, 
so 
numerous 
as 
to 
be 
almost 
beyond 
belief, 
for 
you 
may 
see 
more 
than 
six 
other 
differences 
of 
magnitude, 
and 
the 
largest 
of 
these, 
which 
I 
may 
call 
stars 
of 
the 
seventh 
magnitude, 
or 
of 
the 
first 
magnitude 
of 
invisible 
stars, 
appear 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
telescope 
larger 
and 
brighter 
than 
stars 
of 
the 
second 
magnitude 
seen 
with 
the 
unassisted 
sight. 
But 
in 
order 
that 
you 
may 
see 
one 
or 
two 
proofs 
of 
the 
inconceivable 
manner 
in 
which 
they 
are 
crowded 
together, 
I 
have 
determined 
to 
make 
out 
a 
case 
against 
two 
star-clusters, 
that 
fromthemas 
aspecimenyoumay 
decideaboutthe 
rest. 


As 
my 
first 
example 
I 
had 
determined 
to 
depict 
the 
entire 
constellation 
of 
Orion, 
but 
I 
was 
overwhelmed 
by 
the 
vast 
quantity 
of 
stars 
and 
by 
want 
of 
time, 
and 
so 
I 
have 
deferred 
attempting 
this 
to 
another 
occasion, 
for 
there 
are 
adjacent 
to, 
or 
scattered 
among, 
the 
old 
stars 
more 
than 
five 
hundred 
new 



stars 
within 
the 
limits 
of 
one 
or 
two 
degrees. 
For 
this 
reason 
I 
have 
selected 
the 
three 
stars 
in 
Orion’s 
Belt 
and 
the 
six 
in 
his 
Sword, 
which 
have 
been 
long 
well-known 
groups, 
and 
I 
have 
added 
eighty 
other 
stars 
recently 
discovered 
in 
their 
vicinity, 
and 
I 
have 
preserved 
as 
exactly 
as 
possible 
the 
intervals 
between 
them. 
The 
well-known 
or 
old 
stars, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
distinction, 
I 
have 
depicted 
of 
larger 
size, 
and 
I 
have 
outlined 
them 
with 
a 
double 
line; 
the 
others, 
invisible 
to 
the 
naked 
eye, 
I 
have 
marked 
smaller 
and 
with 
one 
line 
only. 
I 
have 
alsopreservedthedifferencesof 
magnitudeas 
much 
asIcould. 


As 
a 
second 
example 
I 
have 
depicted 
the 
six 
stars 
of 
the 
constellation 
Taurus, 
called 
the 
Pleiades 
(I 
say 
six 
intentionally, 
since 
the 
seventh 
is 
scarcely 
ever 
visible), 
a 
group 
of 
stars 
which 
is 
enclosed 
in 
the 
heavens 
within 
very 
narrow 
precincts. 
Near 
these 
there 
lie 
more 
than 
forty 
others 
invisible 
to 
the 
naked 
eye, 
no 
one 
of 
which 
is 
much 
more 
than 
half 
a 
degree 
off 
any 
of 
the 
aforesaid 
six; 
of 
these 
I 
have 
noticed 
only 
thirty-six 
in 
my 
diagram. 
I 
have 
preserved 
their 
intervals, 
magnitudes, 
and 
the 
distinction 
between 
the 
old 
and 
the 
new 
stars, 
just 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
constellation 
Orion. 


The 
Milky 
Way 
consists 
entirely 
of 
stars 
in 
countless 
numbers 
and 
of 
various 
magnitudes. 
The 
next 
object 
which 
I 
have 
observed 
is 
the 
essence 
or 
substance 
of 
the 
Milky 
Way. 
By 
the 
aid 
of 
a 
telescope 
any 
one 
may 
behold 
this 
in 
a 
manner 
which 
so 
distinctly 
appeals 
to 
the 
senses 
that 
all 
the 
disputes 
which 
have 
tormented 
philosophers 
through 
so 
many 
ages 
are 
exploded 
at 
once 
by 
the 
irrefragable 
evidence 
of 
our 
eyes, 
and 
we 
are 
freed 
from 
wordy 
disputes 
upon 
this 
subject, 
for 
the 
Galaxy 
is 
nothing 
else 
but 
a 
mass 
of 
innumerable 
stars 
planted 
together 
in 
clusters. 
Upon 
whatever 
part 
of 
it 
you 
direct 
the 
telescope 
straightway 
a 
vast 
crowd 
of 
stars 
presents 
itself 
to 
view; 
many 
of 
them 
are 
tolerably 
large 
and 
extremely 
bright, 
but 
the 
number 
of 
smallonesis 
quitebeyonddetermination.

not

to

several

of

similar

shine 
faintly 
here

there 
in 
the

if 
you 
turn 
the

upon 
any 
of

you 
will 
find 
a

of 
stars 
packed 
close 
together. 
Further 
— 
and 
you 
will 
be 
more 
surprised 
at 
this, 
— 
the 
stars 
which 
have 
been 
called 
by 
every 
one 
of 
the 
astronomers 
up 
to 
this 
day 
nebulous,are 
groups 
of 
small 
stars 
set 
thick 
together 
in 
a 
wonderful 
way, 
and 
although 
each 
one 
of 
them 
on 
account 
of 
its 
smallness, 
or 
its 
immense 
distance 
from 
us, 
escapes 
our 
sight, 
from 
the 
commingling 
of 
their 
rays 
there 
arises 
that

hitherto

to

I 
have 
observed 
some 
of 
these, 
and 
I 
wish 
to 
subjoin 
the 
star-clusters 
of 
two 
of

you

contains 
the

called

which 
is 
not 
one 
star 
only, 
but 
a 
mass 
of 
more 
than 
forty 
small

have

remains 
the 
matter, 
which 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
deserve 
to 
be 
considered 
the 
most 
important 
in 
this 
work, 
namely, 
that 
I 
should 
disclose

publish 
to 
the

observing

our 
own 
times, 
their 
positions, 
and 
the 
observations 
made 
during 
the 
last 
two 
months 
about 
their 
movements 
and 
their 
changes 
of 
magnitude; 
and 
I 
summon 
all 
astronomers 
to 
apply 
themselves 
to 
examine 
and 
determine 
their 
periodic 
times, 
which 
it 
has 
not 
been 
permitted 
me 
to 
achieve 
up 
to 
this 
day, 
owing 
to 
the 
restriction 
of 
my 
time. 
I 
give 
them 
warning 
however 
again, 
so 
that 
they 
may 
not 
approach 
such 
an 
inquiry 
to 
no 
purpose, 
that 
they 
will 
want 
a 
very 
accurate 
telescope, 
and 
such 
as 
I 
have 
described 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
this 
account. 


On 
the 
7th 
day 
of 
January 
in 
the 
present 
year, 
1610, 
in 
the 
first14 
hour 
of 
the 
following 
night, 
when 
I 
was 
viewing 
the 
constellations 
of 
the 
heavens 



through 
a 
telescope, 
the 
planet 
Jupiter 
presented 
itself 
to 
my 
view, 
and 
as 
I 
had 
prepared 
for 
myself 
a 
very 
excellent 
instrument, 
I 
noticed 
a 
circumstance 
which 
I 
had 
never 
been 
able 
to 
notice 
before, 
owing 
to 
want 
of 
power 
in 
my 
othertelescope,namely, 
that 
three 
little 
stars,small 
but 
very 
bright,were 
near 
the 
planet; 
and 
although 
I 
believed 
them 
to 
belong 
to 
the 
number 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
yet 
they 
made 
me 
somewhat 
wonder, 
because 
they 
seemed 
to 
be 
arranged 
exactly 
in 
a 
straight 
line, 
parallel 
to 
the 
ecliptic,15 
and 
to 
be 
brighter 
than 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
stars, 
equal 
to 
them 
in 
magnitude. 
The 
position 
of 
them 
withreferenceto 
oneanotherandtoJupiterwasas 
follows 
(Fig. 
1). 


On 
the 
east 
side 
there 
were 
two 
stars, 
and 
a 
single 
one 
towards 
the 
west. 
The 
star 
which 
was 
furthest 
towards 
the 
east, 
and 
the 
western 
star, 
appeared 
rather 
largerthan 
thethird. 


I 
scarcely 
troubled 
at 
all 
about 
the 
distance 
between 
them 
and 
Jupiter, 
for, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
said, 
at 
first 
I 
believed 
them 
to 
be 
fixed 
stars; 
but 
when 
on 
January 
8th, 
led 
by 
some 
fatality, 
I 
turned 
again 
to 
look 
at 
the 
same 
part 
of 
the 
heavens, 
I 
found 
a 
very 
different 
state 
of 
things, 
for 
there 
were 
three 
little 
stars 
all 
west 
of 
Jupiter, 
and 
nearer 
together 
than 
on 
the 
previous 
night, 
and 
they 
were 
separated 
from 
one 
another 
by 
equal 
intervals, 
as 
the 
accompanyingillustration(Fig. 
2)shows. 


At 
this 
point, 
although 
I 
had 
not 
turned 
my 
thoughts 
at 
all 
upon 
the 
approximation 
of 
the 
stars 
to 
one 
another, 
yet 
my 
surprise 
began 
to 
be 
excited, 
how 
Jupiter 
could 
one 
day 
be 
found 
to 
the 
east 
of 
all 
the 
aforesaid 
fixed 
stars 
when 
the 
day 
before 
it 
had 
been 
west 
of 
two 
of 
them; 
and 
forthwith 
I 
became 
afraid 
lest 
the 
planet 
might 
have 
moved 
differently 
from 
the 
calculation 
of 
astronomers, 
and 
so 
had 
passed 
those 
stars 
by 
its 
own 
proper 
motion. 
I 
therefore 
waited 
for 
the 
next 
night 
with 
the 
most 
intense 
longing, 
but 
I 
was 
disappointed 
of 
my 
hope, 
for 
the 
sky 
was 
covered 
with 
clouds 
inevery 
direction. 


But 
on 
January 
10th 
the 
stars 
appeared 
in 
the 
following 
position 
with 
regardtoJupiter;thereweretwoonly,andbothontheeastsideof 
Jupiter,the 
third, 
as 
I 
thought, 
being 
hidden 
by 
the 
planet 
(Fig. 
3). 
They 
were 
situated 
just 
as 
before, 
exactly 
in 
the 
same 
straight 
line 
with 
Jupiter, 
and 
along 
the 
Zodiac. 


When 
I 
had 
seen 
these 
phenomena, 
as 
I 
knew 
that 
corresponding 
changes 
of 
position 
could 
not 
by 
any 
means 
belong 
to 
Jupiter, 
and 
as, 
moreover, 
I 
perceived 
that 
the 
stars 
which 
I 
saw 
had 
been 
always 
the 
same, 
for 
there 
were 
no 
others 
either 
in 
front 
or 
behind, 
within 
a 
great 
distance, 
along 
the 
Zodiac, 



— 
at 
length, 
changing 
from 
doubt 
into 
surprise, 
I 
discovered 
that 
the 
interchangeofposition 
which 
I 
saw 
belonged 
notto 
Jupiter, 
buttothe 
starsto 
which 
my 
attention 
had 
been 
drawn, 
and 
I 
thought 
therefore 
that 
they 
ought 
tobe 
observedhenceforwardwith 
more 
attentionand 
precision. 
Accordingly, 
on 
January 
11th 
I 
saw 
an 
arrangement 
of 
the 
following 
kind 
(Fig. 
4), 
namely, 
only 
two 
stars 
to 
the 
east 
of 
Jupiter, 
the 
nearer 
of 
which 
was 
distant 
from 
Jupiter 
three 
times 
as 
far 
as 
from 
the 
star 
further 
to 
the 
east; 
and 
thestar 
furthesttothe 
eastwasnearlytwiceaslargeas 
the 
other 
one;whereas 
on 
the 
previous 
night 
they 
had 
appeared 
nearly 
of 
equal 
magnitude. 
I 
therefore 
concluded, 
and 
decided 
unhesitatingly, 
that 
there 
are 
three 
stars 
in 
the 
heavens 
moving 
about 
Jupiter, 
as 
Venus 
and 
Mercury 
round 
the 
Sun; 
which 
at 
length 
was 
established 
as 
clear 
as 
daylight 
by 
numerous 
other 
subsequent 
observations. 
These 
observations 
also 
established 
that 
there 
are 
not 
only 
three, 
but 
four, 
erratic 
sidereal 
bodies 
performing 
their 
revolutions 
round 
Jupiter, 
observations 
of 
whose 
changes 
of 
position 
made 
with 
more 
exactness 
on 
succeeding 
nights 
the 
following 
account 
will 
supply. 
I 
have 
measured 
also 
the 
intervals 
between 
them 
with 
the 
telescope 
in 
the 
manner 
already 
explained. 
Besides 
this, 
I 
have 
given 
the 
times 
of 
observation, 
especially 
when 
several 
were 
made 
in 
the 
same 
night, 
for 
the 
revolutions 
of 
these 
planets 
are 
so 
swift 
that 
an 
observer 
may 
generally 
get 
differences 
of 
positionevery 
hour. 


Jan. 
12. 
— 
At 
the 
first 
hour 
of 
the 
next 
night 
I 
saw 
these 
heavenly 
bodies 
arranged 
in 
this 
manner 
(Fig. 
5). 
The 
satellite16 
furthest 
to 
the 
east 
was 
greater 
than 
the 
satellite 
furthest 
to 
the 
west; 
but 
both 
were 
very 
conspicuous 
and 
bright; 
the 
distance 
of 
each 
one 
from 
Jupiter 
was 
two 
minutes. 
A 
third 
satellite, 
certainly 
not 
in 
view 
before, 
began 
to 
appear 
at 
the 
third 
hour; 
it 
nearly 
touched 
Jupiter 
on 
the 
east 
side, 
and 
was 
exceedingly 
small. 
They 
wereallarrangedinthesamestraightline,alongtheecliptic. 


Jan. 
13. 
— 
For 
the 
first 
time 
four 
satellites 
were 
in 
view 
in 
the 
following 
positionwithregard 
toJupiter(Fig. 
6). 


There 
were 
three 
to 
the 
west, 
and 
one 
to 
the 
east; 
they 
made 
a 
straight 
line 
nearly, 
but 
the 
middle 
satellite 
of 
those 
to 
the 
west 
deviated 
a 
little 
from 
the 
straight 
line 
towards 
the 
north. 
The 
satellite 
furthest 
to 
the 
east 
was 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
2´ 
from 
Jupiter; 
there 
were 
intervals 
of 
1´ 
only 
between 
Jupiter 
and 
the 
nearest 
satellite, 
and 
between 
the 
satellites 
themselves, 
west 
of 



Jupiter. 
All 
the 
satellites 
appeared 
of 
the 
same 
size, 
and 
though 
small 
they 


wereverybrilliant,andfaroutshonethefixedstars 
ofthesamemagnitude. 


Jan. 
14. 
—Theweatherwas 
cloudy. 


Jan. 
15. 
— 
At 
the 
third 
hour 
of 
the 
night 
the 
four 
satellites 
were 
in 
the 
statedepicted 
inthenextdiagram(Fig. 
7)withreferenceto 
Jupiter. 


All 
were 
to 
the 
west, 
and 
arranged 
nearly 
in 
the 
same 
straight 
line; 
but 
the 
satellite 
which 
counted 
third 
from 
Jupiter 
was 
raised 
a 
little 
to 
the 
north. 
The 
nearest 
to 
Jupiter 
was 
the 
smallest 
of 
all; 
the 
rest 
appeared 
larger 
and 
in 
order 
of 
magnitude; 
the 
intervals 
between 
Jupiter 
and 
the 
three 
nearest 
satellites 
were 
all 
equal, 
and 
were 
of 
the 
magnitude 
of 
2´ 
each; 
but 
the 
satellite 
furthest 
to 
the 
west 
was 
distant 
4´ 
from 
the 
satellite 
nearest 
to 
it. 
They 
were 
very 
brilliant, 
and 
not 
at 
all 
twinkling, 
as 
they 
have 
always 
appeared 
both 
before 
and 
since. 
But 
at 
the 
seventh 
hour 
there 
were 
only 
three 
satellites, 
presenting 
with 
Jupiter 
an 
appearance 
of 
the 
following 
kind 
(Fig. 
8). 
They 
were, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
in 
the 
same 
straight 
line 
to 
a 
hair; 
the 
nearest 
to 
Jupiter 
was 
very 
small, 
and 
distant 
from 
the 
planet 
3´; 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
second 
from 
this 
one 
was 
1´; 
and 
of 
the 
third 
from 
the 
second 
4´ 
30´´. 
But 
after 
another 
hour 
the 
two 
middlesatelliteswerestillnearer,forthey 
were 
only30´´,orless,apart. 


Jan. 
16. 
— 
At 
the 
first 
hour 
of 
the 
night 
I 
saw 
three 
satellites 
arranged 
in 
this 
order 
(Fig. 
9). 
Jupiter 
was 
between 
two 
of 
them, 
which 
were 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
0´ 
40´´ 
from 
the 
planet 
on 
either 
side, 
and 
the 
third 
was 
west 
of 
Jupiter 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
8´. 
The 
satellites 
near 
to 
Jupiter 
appeared 
brighter 
than 
the 
satellite 
furtheroff,butnotlarger. 


Jan. 
17, 
after 
sunset 
0 
hours 
30 
minutes, 
the 
configuration 
was 
of 
this 
kind 
(Fig. 
10). 
There 
was 
one 
satellite 
only 
to 
the 
east, 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
3´ 
from 
Jupiter; 
to 
the 
west 
likewise 
there 
was 
only 
one 
satellite, 
distant 
11´ 
from 
Jupiter. 
The 
satellite 
on 
the 
east 
appeared 
twice 
as 
large 
as 
the 
satellite 
to 
the 
west; 
and 
there 
were 
no 
more 
than 
these 
two. 
But 
four 
hours 
after, 
that 
is, 
nearly 
at 
the 
fifth 
hour, 
a 
third 
satellite 
began 
to 
emerge 
on 
the 
east 
side, 
which, 
before 
its 
appearance, 
as 
I 
think, 
had 
been 
joined 
with 
the 
former 
of 
the 
two 
other 
satellites, 
and 
the 
position 
was 
of 
this 
kind 
(Fig. 
11). 
The 
middle 
satellite 
was 
very 
near 
indeed 
to 
the 
satellite 
on 
the 
east, 
and 
was 
only 
20´´ 
from 
it; 
and 
was 
a 
little 
towards 
the 
south 
of 
the 
straight 
line 
drawn 
throughthetwo 
extremesatellitesandJupiter. 


Jan. 
18, 
at 
0 
h. 
20 
m. 
after 
sunset, 
the 
appearance 
was 
such 
as 
this 
(Fig. 
12). 
The 
satellite 
to 
the 
east 
was 
larger 
than 
the 
western 
one, 
and 
was 
at 
a 
distance 
fromJupiterof8´,thewestern 
onebeingatadistanceof10´. 



Jan. 
19. 
— 
At 
the 
second 
hour 
of 
the 
night 
the 
relative 
position 
of 
the 
satellites 
was 
such 
as 
this 
(Fig. 
13); 
that 
is, 
there 
were 
three 
satellites 
exactly 
in 
a 
straight 
line 
with 
Jupiter, 
one 
to 
the 
east, 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
6´ 
from 
Jupiter; 
between 
Jupiter 
and 
the 
first 
satellite 
to 
the 
west 
in 
order, 
there 
was 
an 
interval 
of 
5´; 
this 
satellite 
was 
4´ 
off 
the 
other 
one 
more 
to 
the 
west. 
At 
that 
time 
I 
was 
doubtful 
whetheror 
no 
therewas 
asatellitebetweenthe 
satellite 
to 
the 
east 
and 
Jupiter, 
but 
so 
very 
close 
to 
Jupiter 
as 
almost 
to 
touch 
the 
planet; 
but 
at 
the 
fifth 
hour 
I 
saw 
this 
satellite 
distinctly, 
by 
that 
time 
occupying 
exactly 
the 
middle 
position 
between 
Jupiter 
and 
the 
eastern 
satellite, 
so 
that 
the 
configuration 
was 
thus 
(Fig. 
14). 
Moreover, 
the 
satellite 
which 
had 
just 
come 
into 
view 
was 
very 
small; 
yet 
at 
the 
sixth 
hour 
it 
was 
nearly 
as 
large 
as 
therest. 


Jan. 
20: 
1 
h. 
15 
m. 
— 
A 
similar 
arrangement 
was 
seen 
(Fig. 
15). 
There 
were 
three 
satellites, 
so 
small 
asscarcely 
to 
bedistinguishable;their 
distances 
from 
Jupiter, 
and 
from 
one 
another, 
were 
not 
more 
than 
1´. 
I 
was 
doubtful 
whether 
on 
the 
western 
side 
there 
were 
two 
satellites 
or 
three. 
About 
the 
sixth 
hour 
they 
were 
grouped 
in 
this 
way 
(Fig. 
16). 
The 
eastern 
satellite 
was 
twice 
as 
far 
away 
from 
Jupiter 
as 
before, 
that 
is 
2´; 
on 
the 
western 
side, 
the 
satellite 
in 
the 
middle 
was 
distant 
from 
Jupiter 
0´ 
40´´, 
and 
from 
the 
satellite 
still 
further 
to 
the 
west 
0´ 
20´´; 
at 
length, 
at 
the 
seventh 
hour, 
three 
satellites 
were 
seen 
on 
the 
western 
side 
(Fig. 
17). 
The 
satellite 
nearest 
to 
Jupiter 
was 
distant 
from 
the 
planet 
0´ 
20´´; 
between 
this 
one 
and 
the 
satellite 
furthest 
to 
the 
west 
there 
was 
an 
interval 
of 
40´´, 
but 
between 
these 
another 
satellite 
was 
in 
view 
slightly 
southward 
of 
them, 
and 
not 
more 
than 
10´´ 
off 
the 
most 
westerly 
satellite. 


Jan. 
21: 
0 
h. 
30 
m. 
— 
There 
were 
three 
satellites 
on 
the 
east 
side; 
the 
satellites 
and 
Jupiter 
were 
at 
equal 
distances 
apart 
(Fig. 
18). 
The 
intervals 
wereby 
estimation50´´ 
each. 
There 
wasalsoonesatellite 
onthe 
west, 
distant 
4´ 
from 
Jupiter. 
The 
satellite 
on 
the 
east 
side 
nearest 
to 
Jupiter 
was 
the 
least 
ofall. 


Jan. 
22: 
2 
h. 
— 
The 
grouping 
of 
the 
satellites 
was 
similar 
(Fig. 
19). 
There 
was 
an 
interval 
of 
5´ 
from 
the 
satellite 
on 
the 
east 
to 
Jupiter; 
from 
Jupiter 
to 
the 
satellite 
furthest 
to 
the 
west 
7´. 
The 
two 
interior 
satellites 
on 
the 
western 
side 
were 
0´ 
40´´ 
apart, 
and 
the 
satellite 
nearer 
to 
Jupiter 
was 
1´ 
from 
the 
planet. 
The 
inner 
satellites 
were 
smaller 
than 
the 
outer 
ones, 
but 
they 
were 
situated 
all 
in 
the 
same 
straight 
line, 
along 
the 
ecliptic, 
except 
that 
the 
middle 



of 
the 
three 
western 
satellites 
was 
slightly 
to 
the 
south 
of 
it, 
but 
at 
the 
sixth 
hour 
of 
the 
night 
they 
appeared 
in 
this 
position 
(Fig. 
20). 
The 
satellite 
on 
the 
east 
was 
very 
small, 
at 
a 
distance 
from 
Jupiter 
of 
5´ 
as 
before; 
but 
the 
three 
satellites 
onthe 
west 
wereseparated 
by 
equal 
distances 
fromJupiter 
andfrom 
each 
other; 
and 
the 
intervals 
were 
nearly 
1´ 
20´´ 
each. 
The 
satellite 
nearest 
Jupiter 
appeared 
smaller 
than 
the 
other 
two 
on 
the 
same 
side, 
but 
they 
all 
appearedarranged 
exactly 
inthesamestraightline. 


Jan. 
23, 
at 
0 
h. 
40 
m. 
after 
sunset, 
the 
grouping 
of 
the 
satellites 
was 
nearly 
after 
this 
fashion 
(Fig. 
21). 
There 
were 
three 
satellites 
with 
Jupiter 
in 
a 
straight 
line 
along 
the 
ecliptic, 
as 
they 
always 
have 
been; 
two 
were 
on 
the 
east 
of 
the 
planet, 
one 
on 
the 
west; 
the 
satellite 
furthest 
to 
the 
east 
was 
7´ 
from 
the 
next 
one, 
and 
this 
satellite 
2´ 
40´´ 
from 
Jupiter; 
Jupiter 
was 
3´ 
20´´ 
from 
the 
satellite 
on 
the 
west; 
and 
they 
were 
all 
of 
nearly 
the 
same 
size. 
But 
at 
the 
fifth 
hour 
the 
two 
satellites 
which 
had 
been 
previously 
near 
Jupiter 
were 
no 
longer 
visible, 
being, 
as 
I 
suppose, 
hidden 
behind 
Jupiter, 
and 
the 
appearancepresentedwassuchas 
this(Fig. 
22). 


Jan. 
24. 
— 
Three 
satellites, 
all 
on 
the 
east 
side, 
were 
visible, 
and 
nearly, 
but 
not 
quite, 
in 
the 
same 
straight 
line 
with 
Jupiter, 
for 
the 
satellite 
in 
the 
middle 
was 
slightly 
to 
the 
south 
of 
it 
(Fig. 
23). 
The 
satellite 
nearest 
to 
Jupiter 
was 
2´ 
distant 
from 
the 
planet; 
the 
next 
in 
order 
0´ 
30´´ 
from 
this 
satellite, 
and 
the 
third 
was 
9´ 
further 
off 
still; 
they 
were 
all 
very 
bright. 
But 
at 
the 
sixth 
hour 
two 
satellites 
only 
presented 
themselves 
to 
view 
in 
this 
position, 
namely 
in 
the 
same 
straight 
line 
with 
Jupiter 
exactly, 
and 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
nearest 
to 
the 
planet 
was 
lengthened 
to 
3´; 
the 
next 
was 
2´ 
further 
off, 
and 
unless 
I 
am 
mistaken, 
the 
two 
satellites 
previously 
observed 
in 
the 
middle 
had 
come 
together,and 
appearedasone. 


Jan. 
25, 
at 
1 
h. 
40 
m., 
the 
satellites 
were 
grouped 
thus 
(Fig. 
24). 
There 
were 
only 
two 
satellites 
on 
the 
east 
side, 
and 
these 
were 
rather 
large. 
The 
satellite 
furthest 
to 
the 
east 
was 
5´ 
from 
the 
satellite 
in 
the 
middle, 
and 
it 
was 
6´ 
fromJupiter. 


Jan. 
26, 
at 
0 
h. 
40 
m., 
the 
relative 
positions 
of 
the 
satellites 
were 
thus 
(Fig. 
25). 
Three 
satellites 
were 
in 
view, 
of 
which 
two 
were 
east 
and 
the 
third 
west 
of 
Jupiter; 
this 
one 
was 
distant 
3´ 
from 
the 
planet. 
On 
the 
east 
side 
the 
satellite 
in 
the 
middle 
was 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
5´ 
20´´; 
the 
further 
satellite 
was 
6´ 
beyond; 
they 
were 
arranged 
in 
a 
straight 
line, 
and 
were 
of 
the 
same 
size. 
At 
the 
fifth 
hour 
the 
arrangement 
was 
nearly 
the 
same, 
with 
this 
difference 
only, 
that 
the 
fourth 
satellite 
was 
emerging 
on 
the 
east 
side 
near 
Jupiter. 
It 
was 



smaller 
than 
the 
rest, 
and 
was 
then 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
0´ 
30´´ 
from 
Jupiter; 
but 
was 
raised 
a 
little 
above 
the 
straight 
line 
towards 
the 
north, 
as 
the 
accompanyingfigure 
shows(Fig. 
26). 


Jan. 
27, 
1 
h. 
after 
sunset, 
a 
single 
satellite 
only 
was 
in 
view, 
and 
that 
on 
the 
east 
side 
of 
Jupiter 
in 
this 
position 
(Fig. 
27). 
It 
was 
very 
small, 
and 
at 
a 
distance 
of7´ 
fromJupiter. 


Jan. 
28 
and 
29. 
— 
Owing 
to 
the 
intervention 
of 
clouds, 
I 
could 
make 
no 
observation. 


Jan. 
30. 
— 
At 
the 
first 
hour 
of 
the 
night 
the 
satellites 
were 
in 
view, 
arranged 
in 
the 
following 
way 
(Fig. 
28). 
There 
was 
one 
satellite 
on 
the 
east 
side, 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
2´ 
30´´ 
from 
Jupiter; 
and 
there 
were 
two 
satellites 
on 
the 
west, 
of 
which 
the 
one 
nearer 
to 
Jupiter 
was 
3´ 
off 
the 
planet, 
and 
the 
other 
satellite 
1´ 
further. 
The 
places 
of 
the 
outer 
satellites 
and 
Jupiter 
were 
in 
the 
same 
straight 
line; 
but 
the 
satellite 
in 
the 
middle 
was 
a 
little 
above 
it 
to 
the 
north. 
Thesatellitefurthestto

On 
the 
last 
day 
of 
the 
month, 
at 
the 
second 
hour, 
two 
satellites 
on 
the 
east 
side 
were 
visible, 
and 
one 
on 
the 
west 
(Fig. 
29). 
Of 
the 
satellites 
east 
of 
the 
planet, 
the 
one 
in 
the 
middle 
was 
2´ 
20´´ 
distant 
from 
Jupiter; 
and 
the 
satellite 
further 
to 
the 
east 
was 
0´ 
30´´ 
from 
the 
middle 
satellite; 
the 
satellite 
on 
the 
westwasatadistance 
of10´ 
fromJupiter. 
Theywereinthesamestraightline 
nearly, 
and 
would 
have 
been 
exactly 
so, 
only 
the 
satellite 
on 
the 
east 
nearest 
to 
Jupiter 
was 
raised 
a 
little 
towards 
the 
north. 
At 
the 
fourth 
hour, 
the 
two 
satellites 
on 
the 
east 
were 
still 
nearer 
together, 
for 
they 
were 
only 
20´´ 
apart 
(Fig. 
30). 
The 
western 
satellite 
appeared 
rather 
small 
in 
these 
two 
observations. 


Feb. 
1. 
— 
At 
the 
second 
hour 
of 
the 
night 
the 
arrangement 
was 
similar 
(Fig. 
31). 
The 
satellite 
furthest 
to 
the 
east 
was 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
6´ 
from 
Jupiter, 
and 
the 
western 
satellite 
8´. 
On 
the 
east 
side 
there 
was 
a 
very 
small 
satellite, 
atadistanceof20´´ 
from 
Jupiter. 
Theymadeaperfectlystraightline. 


Feb. 
2. 
— 
The 
satellites 
were 
seen 
arranged 
thus 
(Fig. 
32). 
There 
was 
one 
only 
on 
the 
east, 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
6´ 
from 
Jupiter. 
Jupiter 
was 
4´ 
from 
the 
nearest 
satellite 
on 
the 
west; 
between 
this 
satellite 
and 
the 
satellite 
further 
to 
the 
west 
there 
was 
an 
interval 
of 
8´; 
they 
were 
in 
the 
same 
straight 
line 
exactly, 
and 
were 
nearly 
of 
the 
same 
magnitude. 
But 
at 
the 
seventh 
hour 
four 
satellites 
were 
there 
— 
two 
on 
each 
side 
of 
Jupiter 
(Fig. 
33). 
Of 
these 
satellites, 
the 
most 
easterly 
was 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
4´ 
from 
the 
next; 
this 
satellite 
was 
1´ 
40´´ 
from 
Jupiter; 
Jupiter 
was 
6´ 
from 
the 
nearest 
satellite 
on 
the 
west, 



and 
this 
one 
from 
the 
satellite 
further 
to 
the 
west, 
8´; 
and 
they 
were 
all 
alike 
inthesamestraightline,drawn 
inthedirectionof 
theZodiac. 


Feb. 
3: 
7 
h. 
— 
The 
satellites 
were 
arranged 
in 
the 
following 
way 
(Fig. 
34): 


— 
The 
satellite 
on 
the 
east 
was 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
1´ 
30´´ 
from 
Jupiter; 
the 
nearest 
satellite 
on 
the 
west, 
2´, 
and 
there 
was 
a 
long 
distance, 
10´, 
from 
this 
satellite 
to 
the 
satellite 
further 
to 
the 
west. 
They 
were 
exactly 
in 
the 
same 
straightline,andofequalmagnitude. 
Feb. 
4: 
2 
h. 
— 
Four 
satellites 
attended 
Jupiter, 
two 
on 
the 
east 
and 
two 
on 
the 
west, 
arranged 
in 
one 
perfectly 
straight 
line, 
as 
in 
the 
adjoining 
figure 
(Fig. 
35). 
The 
satellite 
furthest 
to 
the 
east 
was 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
3´ 
from 
the 
next 
satellite. 
This 
one 
was 
0´ 
40´´ 
from 
Jupiter; 
Jupiter 
4´ 
from 
the 
nearest 
satellite 
on 
the 
west; 
and 
this 
one 
from 
the 
satellite 
further 
to 
the 
west 
6´. 
In 
magnitude 
they 
were 
nearly 
equal; 
the 
satellite 
nearest 
to 
Jupiter 
was 
rather 
smaller 
in 
appearance 
than 
the 
rest. 
But 
at 
the 
seventh 
hour 
(Fig. 
36) 
the 
eastern 
satellites 
were 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
only 
0´ 
30´´ 
apart. 
Jupiter 
was 
2´ 
from 
the 
nearest 
satellite 
on 
the 
east; 
and 
from 
the 
satellite 
on 
the 
west, 
next 
in 
order, 
4´; 
this 
one 
was 
distant 
3´ 
from 
the 
satellite 
further 
to 
the 
west. 
They 
were 
all 
equal 
in 
magnitude, 
and 
in 
a 
straight 
line, 
drawn 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
theecliptic. 


Feb.

Two 
satellites 
only 
appeared, 
with 
Jupiter 
between 
them, 
as 
is 
seen 
in 
the 
accompanying 
figure 
(Fig. 
37). 
The 
satellite 
on 
the 
east 
was 
2´ 
from 
Jupiter, 
and 
that 
on 
the 
west 
3´. 
They

Feb. 
7. 
— 
There 
were 
two 
satellites 
by 
the 
side 
of 
Jupiter, 
and 
both 
of 
them 
on 
the 
east 
of 
the 
planet, 
arranged 
in 
this 
manner 
(Fig. 
38). 
The 
intervals 
between 
the 
satellites 
and 
Jupiter 
were 
equal, 
and 
of 
1´ 
each; 
and

Feb. 
8: 
1 
h. 
— 
Three 
satellites 
were 
there, 
all 
on 
the 
east 
side 
of 
Jupiter, 
as 
in 
the 
diagram 
(Fig. 
39). 
The 
nearest 
to 
Jupiter, 
a 
rather 
small 
one, 
was 
distant 
from 
the 
planet 
1´ 
20´´; 
the 
middle 
one 
was 
4´ 
from 
this 
satellite, 
and 
was 
rather 
large; 
the 
satellite 
furthest 
to 
the 
east, 
a 
very 
small 
one, 
was 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
0´ 
20´´ 
from 
this 
satellite. 
It 
was 
doubtful 
whether 
there 
was 
one 
satellite 
neartoJupiter 
ortwo,forsometimesitseemedthat 
there 
wasanother 
satellite 
by 
its 
side 
towards 
the 
east, 
wonderfully 
small, 
and 
only 
10´´ 
from 
it. 
They 
were 
all 
situated 
at 
points 
in 
a 
straight 
line 
drawn 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
Zodiac. 
At 
the 
third 
hour 
the 
satellite 
nearest 
to 
Jupiter 
was 
almost 
touching 



the 
planet, 
for 
it 
was 
only 
distant 
10´´ 
from 
it; 
but 
the 
others 
had 
become 
further 
off, 
for 
the 
middle 
one 
was 
6´ 
from 
Jupiter. 
At 
length, 
at 
the 
fourth 
hour, 
the 
satellite 
which 
was 
previously 
the 
nearest 
to 
Jupiter 
joined 
with 
the 
planet 
anddisappeared. 


Feb. 
9: 
0 
h. 
30 
m. 
— 
There 
were 
two 
satellites 
on 
the 
east 
side 
of 
Jupiter, 
and 
one 
on 
the 
west, 
in 
an 
arrangement 
such 
as 
this 
(Fig. 
40). 
The 
satellite 
furthesttotheeast,which 
wasarathersmallone,wasdistant4´ 
from 
the 
next 
satellite; 
the 
satellite 
in 
the 
middle 
was 
larger, 
and 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
7´ 
from 
Jupiter. 
Jupiter 
was 
distant 
4´ 
from 
the 
western 
satellite, 
which 
was 
a 
small 
one. 


Feb. 
10: 
1 
h. 
30 
m. 
— 
A 
pair 
of 
satellites, 
very 
small, 
and 
both 
on 
the 
east 
of 
the 
planet, 
were 
visible, 
in 
the 
following 
position 
(Fig. 
41). 
The 
further 
satellite 
was 
distant 
from 
Jupiter 
10´, 
the 
nearer 
0´ 
20´´, 
and 
they 
were 
in 
the 
same 
straight 
line; 
but 
at 
the 
fourth 
hour 
the 
satellite 
nearest 
to 
Jupiter 
no 
longer 
appeared, 
and 
the 
other 
seemed 
so 
diminished 
that 
it 
could 
scarcely 
be 
kept 
in 
sight, 
although 
the 
atmosphere 
was 
quite 
clear, 
and 
the 
satellite 
was 
furtherfromJupiter 
thanbefore, 
since 
itsdistancewasnow 
12´. 


Feb. 
11: 
1 
h. 
— 
There 
were 
two 
satellites 
on 
the 
east, 
and 
one 
on 
the 
west 
(Fig. 
42). 
The 
western 
satellite 
was 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
4´ 
from 
Jupiter. 
The 
satellite 
on 
the 
east, 
nearest 
to 
the 
planet, 
was 
likewise 
4´ 
from 
Jupiter; 
but 
the 
satellite 
further 
to 
the 
east 
was 
at 
a 
distance 
from 
this 
one 
of 
8´; 
they 
were 
fairly 
clear 
to 
view, 
and 
in 
the 
same 
straight 
line; 
but 
at 
the 
third 
hour 
the 
fourth 
satellite 
was 
visible 
near 
to 
Jupiter 
on 
the 
east, 
less 
in 
magnitude 
than 
the 
rest, 
separated 
from 
Jupiter 
by 
a 
distance 
of 
0´ 
30´´, 
and 
slightly 
to 
the 
north 
out 
of 
the 
straight 
line 
drawn 
through 
the 
rest 
(Fig. 
43). 
They 
were 
all 
very 
bright 
and 
extremely 
distinct, 
but 
at 
5 
h. 
30 
m. 
the 
satellite 
on 
the 
east 
nearest 
to 
Jupiter 
had 
moved 
further 
away 
from 
the 
planet, 
and 
was 
occupying 
a 
position 
midway 
between 
the 
planet 
and 
the 
neighbouring 
satellite 
further 
to 
the 
east. 
They 
were 
all 
in 
the 
same 
straight 
line 
exactly, 
and 
of 
the 
same 
magnitude, 
as 
may 
be

10´, 
and 
the 
further 
of 
the

They 
were 
both 
fairly

were 
very 
near 
to 
Jupiter, 
and 
very 
small, 
especially 
the 
satellite 
to 
the

which 
was 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
0´ 
40´´ 
from

The 
distance 
of 
the

1´. 



But 
at

Two 
satellites 
were 
visible 
in 
the 
east, 
two 
also 
in 
the 
west 
(Fig. 
46). 
The 
satellite 
on 
the 
east 
near 
Jupiter 
was 
fairly 
distinct; 
its 
distance 
from 
the 
planet 
was 
2´. 
The 
satellite 
further 
to 
the 
east 
was 
less 
noticeable; 
it 
was 
distant 
4´ 
from 
the 
other. 
Of 
the 
satellites 
on 
the 
west, 
the 
one 
furthest 
from 
Jupiter, 
which 
was 
very 
distinct, 
was 
parted 
from 
the 
planet 
4´. 
Between 
this 
satellite 
and 
Jupiter 
intervened 
a 
small 
satellite 
close 
to 
the 
most 
westerly 
satellite, 
being 
not 
more 
than 
0´ 
3´´ 
off. 
They 
were 
all 
in 
the 
samestraightline,

(for 
on 
the 
14th 
the 
skywascoveredwithclouds), 
at 
the 
first 
hour, 
the 
position 
of 
the 
satellites 
was 
thus 
(Fig. 
47); 
that 
is, 
there 
were 
three 
satellites 
on 
the 
east, 
but 
none 
were 
visible 
on 
the 
west. 
The 
satellite 
on 
the 
east 
nearest 
to 
Jupiter 
was 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
0´ 
50´´ 
from 
the 
planet; 
the 
next 
in 
order 
was 
0´ 
20´´ 
from 
this 
satellite, 
and 
the 
furthest 
to 
the 
east 
was 
2´ 
from 
the 
second 
satellite, 
and 
it 
was 
larger 
than 
the 
others, 
for 
those 
nearer 
to 
Jupiter 
were 
very 
small. 
But 
about 
the 
fifth 
hour 
only 
one 
of 
the 
satellites 
which 
had 
been 
near 
to 
Jupiter 
was 
to 
be 
seen; 
its 
distance 
from 
Jupiter 
was 
0 
´ 
30´´. 
The 
distance 
of 
the 
satellite 
furthest 
to 
the 
east 
from 
Jupiter 
had 
increased, 
for 
it 
was 
then 
4´ 
(Fig. 
48). 
But 
at 
the 
sixth 
hour, 
besides 
the 
two 
situated 
as 
just 
described 
on 
the 
east, 
one 
satellite 
was 
visible 
towards 
the 
west,

Feb. 
16:

h. 
— 
Their 
places 
were 
arranged 
as 
follows 
(Fig. 
50); 
that 
is, 
the 
satellite 
on 
the 
east 
was 
7´ 
from 
Jupiter, 
Jupiter 
5´ 
from 
the 
next 
satellite 
on 
the 
west, 
and 
this 
3´ 
from 
the 
remaining 
satellite 
still 
further 
to 
the 
west. 
They 
were 
all 
of 
the

magnitude 
nearly, 
rather 
bright, 
and 
in 
the

distant 
3´ 
from 
Jupiter; 
the 
other 
on 
the 
west, 
distant 
10´ 
(Fig.

The 
latter 
was 
somewhat 
less 
than 
the 
satellite 
on 
the 
east; 
but 
at 
the 
sixth 
hour 
the 
eastern 
satellite 
was 
nearer 
to 
Jupiter, 
being 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
0´ 
50´´, 
and 
the 
western 
satellite 
was 
further 
off, 
namely 
12´. 
At 
both 
observations 
they 
were 
in 
the

were 
both 
rather

the 
distance 
of 
the 
eastern

of 
the 
nearest 
satellite 
on 
the

2´; 
the 
remaining 
satellite, 
still 
further

the 
middle 
satellite 
(Fig.

They 
were 
all 
in 
the 
same 
straight 
line 
exactly, 
and 
of 
about 
the 
same 
magnitude. 
But 
at 
the 
second 
hour 
the 
satellites 
nearest 
to 
the 
planet 
were 
at 
equal 
distances 
from 
Jupiter, 
for 
the 
western 
satellite 
was 
now 
also 
3´ 
from 
the 
planet. 
But 
at 
the 
sixth 
hour 
the 
fourth 
satellite 
was 
visible 
between 
the 
satellite 
on 
the 
east 
and 
Jupiter, 
in 
the 
following 
configuration 
(Fig.

The 
satellite 
furthest

was 
at 
a 
distance

These 
were 
nearly 
equal 
in 
magnitude, 
only 
the 
satellite 
on 
the 
east 
nearest 
to 
Jupiter 
was 
a

only 
were 
present, 
one 
on 
the

distant 
10´ 
from 
Jupiter; 
the 
other 
was 
on 
the

at 
a 
distance

At 
the 
fifth

for, 
besides 
the 
two 
already 
noticed, 
a 
third

near 
Jupiter, 
very 
small, 
which 
previously

observe 
the 
motion 
of

the 
adjacent 
planets 
(his 
satellites) 
along 
the 
zodiac, 
by 
reference

The 
satellites 
appeared 
in 
the 
following 
configuration. 
The 
satellite 
furthest 
to 
the 
east 
was 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
10´ 
from 
Jupiter; 
the 
next 
in 
order 
was 
near 
Jupiter, 
being 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
0´ 
30´´ 
from 
the 
planet. 
The 
next 
satellite 
was 
on 
the 
western 
side, 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
2´ 
30´´ 
from 
Jupiter; 
and 
the 
satellite 
further 
to 
the 
west 
was 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
1´ 
from 
this. 
The 
two 
satellites 
near 
to 
Jupiter 
appeared 
small, 
especially 
the 
satellite 
on 
the 
east; 
but 
the 
satellites 
furthest 
off 
were 
very 
bright, 
particularly 
that 
on 
the 
west, 
and 
they 
made 
a 
straight 
line 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
ecliptic 
exactly. 
The 
motion 
of 
the 
planets 
towards 
the 
east 
was 
plainly 
seen 
by 
reference 
to 
the 
aforesaid 
fixed 
star, 
for 
Jupiter

his 
attendant 
satellites 
were 
nearer 
to 
it,

they 
were 
both

only 
the 
satellite 
third 
from

The 
fixed

formed 
with 
Jupiter

the 
most

satellite 
an

March

Three 
satellites 
were 
in 
attendance, 
two 
on 
the 
east 
and 
one 
on 
the 
west, 
in 
the 
configuration 
shown 
in 
the 
diagram 
(Fig. 
64). 
The 
satellite 
furthest 
to 
the 
east 
was 
7´ 
from 
Jupiter; 
from 
this 
satellite 
the 
next 
was 
distant 
0´ 
30´´, 
and 
the 
satellite 
on 
the 
west 
was 
separated 
from 
Jupiter 
by 
an 
interval 
of 
2´. 
The 
satellites 
furthest 
off 
were 
brighter 
and 
larger 
than 
the 
remaining 
satellite, 
which 
appeared 
very 
small. 
The 
satellite 
furthest 
to 



the 
east 
seemed 
to 
be 
raised 
a 
little 
towards 
the 
north, 
out 
of 
the 
straight 
line 
drawn 
through 
theothersatellites 
andJupiter. 


The 
fixed 
star 
already 
noticed 
was 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
8´ 
from 
the 
western 
satellite, 
that 
is, 
from 
the 
perpendicular 
drawn 
from 
that 
satellite 
to 
the 
straightline 
drawnthroughallthesystem, 
asshown 
inthefiguregiven. 


These 
determinations 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
Jupiter 
and 
the 
adjacent 
planets 
(his 
satellites) 
by 
reference 
to 
a 
fixed 
star, 
I 
have 
thought 
well 
to 
present 
to 
the 
notice 
of 
astronomers, 
in 
order 
that 
any 
one 
may 
be 
able 
to 
understand 
from 
them 
that 
the 
movements 
of 
these 
planets 
(Jupiter’s 
satellites) 
both 
in 
longitude 
and 
in 
latitudeagree 
exactly 
with 
themotions 
[of 
Jupiter] 
which 
are 
extractedfromtables. 


These 
are 
my 
observations 
upon 
the 
four 
Medicean 
planets, 
recently 
discovered 
for 
the 
first 
time 
by 
me; 
and 
although 
it 
is 
not 
yet 
permitted 
me 
to 
deduce 
by 
calculation 
from 
these 
observations 
the 
orbits 
of 
these 
bodies, 
yet 
I 
may 
be 
allowed 
to 
make 
some 
statements, 
based 
upon 
them, 
well 
worthy 
of 
attention. 


Deductions 
from 
the 
previous 
observations 
concerning 
the 
orbits 
and 
periodsofJupiter’ssatellites. 
And,in 
the 
firstplace,sincetheyaresometimes 
behind, 
sometimes 
before 
Jupiter, 
at 
like 
distances, 
and 
withdraw 
from 
this 
planet 
towards 
the 
east 
and 
towards 
the 
west 
only 
within 
very 
narrow 
limits 
of 
divergence, 
and 
since 
they 
accompany 
this 
planet 
alike 
when 
its 
motion 
is 
retrograde 
and 
direct, 
it 
can 
be 
a 
matter 
of 
doubt 
to 
no 
one 
that 
they 
perform 
their 
revolutions 
about 
this 
planet, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
they 
all 
accomplish 
together 
orbits 
of 
twelve 
years’ 
length 
about 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
world. 
Moreover, 
they 
revolve 
in 
unequal 
circles, 
which 
is 
evidently 
the 
conclusion 
to 
be 
drawn 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
I 
have 
never 
been 
permitted 
to 
see 
two 
satellites 
in 
conjunction 
when 
their 
distance 
from 
Jupiter 
was 
great, 
whereas 
near 
Jupiter 
two, 
three, 
and 
sometimes 
all 
(four), 
have 
been 
found 
closely 
packed 
together. 
Moreover, 
it 
may 
be 
detected 
that 
the 
revolutions 
of 
the 
satellites 
which 
describe 
the 
smallest 
circles 
round 
Jupiter 
are 
the 
most 
rapid, 
for 
the 
satellites 
nearest 
to 
Jupiter 
are 
often 
to 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
east, 
when 
the 
day 
before 
they 
have 
appearedinthe 
west, 
and 
contrariwise. 
Alsothe 
satellite 
moving 
in 
the 
greatest 
orbit 
seems 
to 
me, 
after 
carefully 
weighing 
the 
occasions 
of 
its 
returning 
to 
positions 
previously 
noticed, 
to 
have 
a 
periodic 
time 
of 
half 
a 
month.17 
Besides, 
we 
have 
a 
notable 
and 
splendid 
argument 
to 
remove 
the 
scruples 
of 
those 
who 
can 
tolerate 
the 
revolution 
of 
the

both 
accomplish 
an

of 
a

length 
about 
the

that 
they 
consider 
that 
this 
theory 
of 
the 
constitution 
of 
the 
universe 
must 
be 
upset 
as 
impossible; 
for 
now 
we 
have 
not 
one 
planet 
only 
revolving 
about 
another, 
while 
both 
traverse 
a 
vast 
orbit 
about 
the 
Sun, 
but 
our 
sense 
of 
sight 
presents 
to 
us 
four 
satellites 
circling 
about 
Jupiter, 
like 
the 
Moon 
about 
the 
Earth, 
while 
the 
whole

Explanation 
of 
the 
variations 
in 
brightness 
of 
Jupiter’s 
satellites. 
Lastly, 
I 
must 
not 
pass 
over 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
reason 
why 
it 
happens 
that 
the 
Medicean 
stars, 
in 
performing 
very 
small 
revolutions 
about 
Jupiter, 
seem 
sometimes 
more 
than 
twice 
as 
large 
as 
at 
other 
times. 
We 
can 
by 
no 
means 
look 
for 
the 
explanation 
in 
the 
mists 
of 
the 
Earth’s 
atmosphere, 
for 
they 
appear 
increased 
or 
diminished, 
while 
the 
discs 
of 
Jupiter 
and 
neighbouring 
fixed 
stars 
are 
seen 
quite 
unaltered. 
That 
they 
approach 
and 
recede 
from 
the 
Earth 
at 
the 
points 
of 
their 
revolutions 
nearest 
to 
and 
furthest 
from 
the 
Earth 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
as 
to 
account 
for 
so 
great 
changes 
seems 
altogether 
untenable, 
for 
a 
strict 
circular 
motion 
can 
by 
no 
means 
show 
those 
phenomena; 
and 
an 
elliptical 
motion 
(which 
in 
this 
case 
would 
be 
nearly 
rectilinear) 
seems 
to 
be 
both 
untenable 
and 
by 
no 
means 
in 
harmony 
with 
the 
phenomena 
observed. 
But 
I 
gladly 
publish 
the 
explanation 
which 
has 
occurred 
to 
me 
upon 
this 
subject, 
and 
submit 
it 
to 
the 
judgment 
and 
criticism 
of 
all 
true 
philosophers. 
It 
is 
certain 
that 
when 
atmospheric 
mists 
intervene 
the 
Sun 
and 
Moon 
appear 
larger, 
but 
the 
fixed 
stars 
and 
planets 
less 
than 
they 
really 
are;hencethe 
formerluminaries, 
when 
nearthehorizon,arelargerthan 
at 
other 
times, 
but 
stars 
appear 
smaller, 
and 
are 
frequently 
scarcely 
visible; 
also 
they 
are 
still 
more 
diminished 
if 
those 
mists 
are 
bathed 
in 
light; 
so 
stars 
appear 
very 
small 
by 
day 
and 
in 
the 
twilight, 
but 
the 
Moon 
does 
not 
appear 
so, 
as 
I 
have 
previously 
remarked. 
Moreover, 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
not 
only 
the 
Earth, 
but 
also 
the 
Moon, 
has 
its 
own 
vaporous 
sphere 
enveloping 
it, 
for 
the 
reasons 
which 
I 
have 
previously 
mentioned, 
and 
especially 
for 
those 
which 
shall 
be 
stated 
more 
fully 
in 
my 
System; 
and 
we 
may 
consistently 
decide 
that 
the 
same 
is 
true 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
planets; 
so 
that 
it 
seems 
to 
be 
by 
no 
means 
an 
untenable 
opinion 
to 
place 
round 
Jupiter 
also 
an 
atmosphere 
denser 
than 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
ether,18 
about 
which, 
like 
the 
Moon 
about 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
elements, 
the 
Medicean 
planets 
(Jupiter’s 
satellites) 
revolve; 
and 
that 
by 
the 
intervention 
of 
this 
atmosphere 
they 
appear 
smaller 
when 
they 
are 
in 
apogee; 
but 
when 
in 
perigee, 
through 
the 
absence 
or 
attenuation 
of 
that 



atmosphere, 
they 
appear 
larger.

THE 
PREFACE 
TO 
KEPLER’S 
DIOPTRICS 
FORMING 
A 
CONTINUATION 
OF 
GALILEO’S 
SIDEREAL 
MESSENGER. 


In 
the 
preface 
to 
Kepler’s 
Dioptrics 
there 
are 
introduced 
letters 
of 
Galileo 
about 
the 
new 
and 
astonishing 
discoveries 
which 
he 
had 
made 
in 
the 
heavens 
by 
the

of 
the

since 
the

of 
his 
work, 
The

and 
Kepler’s

upon 
them,

Extract 
from 
the 
Preface 
of 
Kepler’s 
Dioptrics. 
Augsburg, 
1611. 


Kepler 
remarks 
on 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
application 
of 
the 
telescope 
to 
astronomical 
investigations 
as 
indicated 
by 
Galileo’s 
discoveries, 
published 
in 
his 
Sidereal 
Messenger.“The 
Sidereal 
Messenger” 
of 
Galileo 
has 
been 
for 
a 
long 
time 
in 
everybody’s 
hands, 
also 
my 
“Discussion, 
such 
as 
it 
is, 
with 
this 
Messenger,” 
and 
my 
Brief 
Narrative 
in 
confirmation 
of 
Galileo’s 
Sidereal 
Messenger, 
so 
any 
reader 
may 
briefly 
weigh 
the 
chief 
points 
of 
that 
Messenger 
and 
see 
the 
nature 
and 
the 
value 
of 
the 
discoveries 
made 
by 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
telescope, 
the 
theory 
of 
which 
I 
am 
intending 
to 
demonstrate 
in 
this 
treatise. 
Actual 
sight 
testified 
that 
there 
is 
a 
certain 
bright 
heavenly 
body 
which 
wecallthe 
Moon. 
Itwasdemonstrated 
from 
the 
laws 
of 
optics 
that 
this 
body 
is 
round; 
also 
Astronomy, 
by 
some 
arguments 
founded 
upon 
optics, 
had 
built 
up 
the 
conclusion 
that 
its 
distance 
from 
the 
earth 
is 
about 
sixty 
semidiametersofthe 
earth. 
Various 
spots 
showed 
themselves 
in 
that 
body;and 
the 
result 
was 
a 
dubious 
opinion 
among 
a 
few 
philosophers, 
derived 
from 
Hecatæus’ 
account 
of 
the 
stories 
about 
the 
island 
of 
the 
Hyperboreans,19 
that 
the 
reflected 
images 
of 
mountains 
and 
valleys, 
sea 
and 
land, 
were 
seen 
there; 
but 
now 
the 
telescope 
places 
all 
these 
matters 
before 
our 
eyes 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
he 
must 
be 
an 
intellectual 
coward 
who, 
while 
enjoying 
such 
a 
view, 
still 
thinks 
that 
the 
matter 
is 
open 
to 
doubt. 
Nothing 
is 
more 
certain 
than 
that 
the 
southern 
parts 
of 
the 
moon 
teem 
with 
mountains, 
very 
many 
in 
number, 
and 
vast 
in 
size; 
and 
that 
the 
northern 
parts, 
inasmuch 
as 
they 
are 
lower, 
receive 
in 
most 
extensive 
lakes 
the 
water 
flowing 
down 
from 
the 
south. 
The 
conclusions 
which 
previously 
Pena 
published 
as 
disclosed 
by 
the 
aid 
of 



optics, 
started 
indeed 
from 
certain 
slight 
supports, 
rather 
than 
foundations, 
afforded 
by 
actual 
sight, 
but 
were 
proved 
by 
long 
arguments 
depending 
one 
upon 
another, 
so 
that 
they 
might 
be 
assigned 
to 
human 
reason 
rather 
than 
to 
sight; 
but 
now 
our 
very 
eyes, 
as 
if 
a 
new 
door 
of 
heaven 
had 
been 
opened, 
are 
led 
to 
the 
view 
of 
matters 
once 
hidden 
from 
them. 
But 
if 
it 
should 
please 
any 
one 
to 
exhaust 
the 
force 
of 
reasoning 
upon 
these 
new 
observations, 
who 
does 
not 
see 
how 
far 
the 
contemplation 
of 
nature 
will 
extend 
her 
boundaries, 
when 
we 
ask, 
“What 
is 
the 
use 
of 
the 
tracts 
of 
mountains 
and 
valleys, 
and 
the 
very 
wide 
expanse 
of 
seas 
in 
the 
moon?” 
and 
“May 
not 
some 
creature 
less 
noble 
thanmanbeimaginedsuch 
asmight 
inhabitthosetracts?” 


With 
no 
less 
certainty 
also 
do 
we 
decide 
by 
the 
use 
of 
this 
instrument 
even 
that 
famous 
question, 
which, 
coeval 
with 
philosophy 
itself, 
is 
disputed 
to 
this 
day 
by 
the 
noblest 
intellects 
— 
I 
mean, 
whether 
the 
earth 
can 
move 
(as 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
Planets 
greatlyrequires)without 
theoverthrow 
ofall 
bodies 
that 
have 
weight, 
or 
the 
confusion 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
elements? 
For 
if 
the 
earth 
werebanished 
from 
the 
centreoftheuniverse,somefearlestthewater 
should 
leave 
the 
orb 
of 
the 
earth 
and 
flow 
to 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
universe; 
and 
yet 
we 
see 
that 
in 
the 
moon, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
earth, 
there 
is 
a 
quantity 
of 
moisture 
occupying 
the 
sunken 
hollows 
of 
that 
globe; 
and 
although 
this 
orb 
revolves 
actually 
in 
the 
ether, 
and 
outside 
the 
centres 
not 
merely 
of 
the 
universe, 
but 
even 
of 
our 
earth, 
yet 
the 
mass 
of 
water 
in 
the 
moon 
is 
not 
at 
all 
hindered 
from 
cleaving 
invariably 
to 
the 
orb 
of 
the 
moon, 
and 
tending 
to 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
body 
to 
which 
it 
belongs. 
So, 
by 
this 
instance 
of 
the 
phenomena 
of 
the 
moon, 
the 
science 
of 
optics 
amends 
the 
received 
theory 
of 
mechanics, 
and 
confirms 
on 
this 
point 
my 
introduction 
to 
my 
Commentaries 
upon 
the 


20 


Motions 
of 
the 
Planet 
Mars. 


The 
followers 
of 
the 
Samian 
philosophy 
(for 
I 
may 
use 
this 
epithet 
to 
designate 
the 
philosophy 
originated 
by 
the 
Samians, 
Pythagoras 
and 
Aristarchus) 
have 
a 
strong 
argument 
against 
the 
apparent 
immobility 
of 
the 
earth 
provided 
in 
the 
phenomena 
of 
the 
moon. 
For 
we 
are 
taught 
by 
optics 
that 
if 
any 
one 
of 
us 
was 
in 
the 
moon, 
to 
him 
the 
moon, 
his 
abode, 
would 
seem 
quite 
immovable, 
but 
our 
earth 
and 
sun 
and 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
heavenly 
bodies 
movable;for 
the 
conclusionsofsightarethus 
related. 


Pena 
has 
noticed 
how 
astronomers, 
using 
the 
principles 
of 
optics, 
have 
by 
most 
laborious 
reasoning 
removed 
the 
Milky 
Way 
from 
the 
elementary 
universe, 
where 
Aristotle 
had 
placed 
it, 
into 
the 
highest 
region 
of 
the 
ether; 
but 
now, 
by 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
telescope 
lately 
invented, 
the 
very 
eyes 
of 



astronomers 
are 
conducted 
straight 
to 
a 
thorough 
survey 
of 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
Milky 
Way; 
and 
whoever 
enjoys 
this 
sight 
is 
compelled 
to 
confess 
that 
theMilky 
Wayisnothingelsebuta 
mass 
ofextremelysmallstars. 


Again, 
up 
to 
this 
time 
the 
nature 
of 
nebulous 
stars 
had 
been 
entirely 
unknown; 
but 
if 
the 
telescope 
be 
directed 
to 
one 
of 
such 
nebulous 
balls, 
as 
Ptolemy 
calls 
them, 
it 
again 
shows, 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
Milky 
Way, 
three 
or 
fourverybrightstars 
clusteredveryclosetogether. 


Again, 
who 
without 
this 
instrument 
would 
have 
believed 
that 
the 
number 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars 
was 
ten 
times, 
or 
perhaps 
twenty 
times, 
more 
than 
that 
which 
is 
given 
in 
Ptolemy’s 
description 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars? 
And 
whence, 
pray, 
should 
we 
seek 
for 
conclusive 
evidence 
about 
the 
end 
or 
boundary 
of 
this 
visible 
universe, 
proving 
that 
it 
is 
actually 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
and 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
beyond, 
except 
from 
this 
very 
discovery 
by 
the 
telescope 
of 
this 
multitude 
of 
fixed 
stars, 
which 
is, 
as 
it 
were, 
the 
vaulting 
of 
the 
mobile 
universe? 
Again, 
how 
greatly 
an 
astronomer 
would 
go 
wrong 
in 
determining 
the 
magnitude 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
except 
he 
should 
survey 
the 
stars 
all 
over 
again 
with 
a 
telescope, 
also 
may 
be 
seen 
in 
Galileo’s 
treatise, 
and 
we 
will 
also 
hereafter 
produceinproofaletterfromaGermanastronomer. 


But 
no 
words 
can 
express 
my 
admiration 
of 
that 
chapter 
of 
the 
Sidereal 
Messenger 
where 
the 
story 
is 
told 
of 
the 
discovery, 
by 
the 
aid 
of 
a 
very 
highly 
finished 
telescope, 
of 
another 
world, 
as 
it 
were, 
in 
the 
planet 
Jupiter. 
The 
mind 
of 
the 
philosopher 
almost 
reels 
as 
he 
considers 
that 
there 
is 
a 
vast 
orb, 
which 
is 
equal 
in 
mass 
to 
fourteen 
orbs 
like 
the 
earth 
(unless 
on 
this 
point 
the 
telescope 
of 
Galileo 
shall 
shortly 
reveal 
something 
more 
exact 
than 
themeasurements 
of 
Tycho 
Brahe) 
round 
which 
circlefour 
moons, 
notunlike 
this 
moon 
of 
ours; 
the 
slowest 
revolving 
in 
the 
space 
of 
fourteen 
of 
our 
days, 
as 
Galileo 
has 
published; 
the 
next 
to 
this, 
by 
far 
the 
brightest 
of 
the 
four, 
in 
the 
space 
of 
eight 
days, 
as 
I 
detected 
in 
last 
April 
and 
May; 
the 
other 
two 
in 
still 
shorter 
periods. 
And 
here 
the 
reasoning 
of 
my 
Commentaries 
about 
the 
Planet 
Mars, 
applied 
to 
a 
similar 
case, 
induces 
me 
to 
conclude 
also 
that 
the 
actual 
orb 
of 
Jupiter 
rotates 
with 
very 
great 
rapidity, 
most 
certainly 
faster 
than 
once 
in 
the 
space 
of 
one 
of 
our 
days; 
so 
that 
this 
rotation 
of 
the 
mighty 
orb 
upon 
its 
own 
axis 
is 
accompanied 
wherever 
it 
goes 
by 
the 
perpetual 
circuits 
of 
those 
four 
moons. 
Moreover, 
this 
sun 
of 
ours, 
the 
common 
source 
of 
heat 
and 
light 
for 
this 
terrestrial 
world 
as 
well 
as 
for 
that 
world 
of 
Jupiter, 
which 
we 
consider 
to 
be 
of 
the 
angular 
magnitude 
of 
30´ 
at 
most, 
there 
scarcely 
subtends 
more 
than 
6´ 
or 
7´, 
and 
is 
found 
again 
in 
the 
same 
position 



among 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
having 
completed 
the 
zodiac 
in 
the 
interval, 
after 
a 
period 
of 
twelve 
of 
our 
years.21 
Accordingly, 
the 
creatures 
which 
live 
on 
that 
orb 
of 
Jupiter, 
while 
they 
contemplate 
the 
very 
swift 
courses 
of 
those 
four 
moons 
among 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
while 
they 
behold 
them 
and 
the 
sun 
rising 
and 
setting 
day 
by 
day, 
would 
swear 
by 
Jupiter-in-stone, 
like 
the 
Romans 
(for 
I 
have 
lately 
returned 
from 
those 
parts), 
that 
their 
orb 
of 
Jupiter 
remains 
immovable 
in 
one 
spot, 
and 
that 
the 
fixed 
stars 
and 
the 
sun, 
which 
are 
the 
bodies 
really 
at 
rest, 
no 
less 
than 
those 
four 
moons 
of 
theirs, 
revolve 
round 
that 
abode 
of 
theirs 
with 
manifold 
variety 
of 
motions. 
And 
from 
this 
instance 
now, 
much 
more 
than 
before 
from 
the 
instance 
of 
the 
moon, 
any 
follower 
of 
the 
Samian 
philosophy 
will 
learn 
what 
reply 
may 
be 
made 
to 
any 
one 
objecting 
to 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
earth 
as 
absurd, 
and 
alleging 
the 
evidence 
of 
our 
sight. 
O 
telescope, 
instrument 
of 
much 
knowledge, 
more 
precious 
than 
any 
sceptre! 
Is 
not 
he 
who 
holds 
thee 
in 
his 
hand 
made 
king 
and 
lordof 
theworksof 
God?Truly 


“Allthatisoverhead,themightyorbs 


Withalltheirmotions,thoudostsubjugate 


Toman’s 
intelligence.” 


If 
there 
is 
any 
one 
in 
some 
degree 
friendly 
to 
Copernicus 
and 
the 
lights 
of 
the 
Samian 
philosophy, 
who 
finds 
this 
difficulty 
only, 
that 
he 
doubts 
how 
it 
can 
happen,supposingtheearthto 
performagainandagain 
her 
courseamong 
the 
planets 
through 
the 
ethereal 
plains, 
that 
the 
moon 
should 
keep 
so 
constantly 
by 
her 
side, 
like 
an 
inseparable 
companion, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
fly 
round 
and 
round 
the 
actual 
orb 
of 
the 
earth, 
just 
like 
a 
faithful 
dog 
which 
goes 
round 
and 
round 
his 
master 
on 
some 
journey, 
now 
running 
in 
front, 
now 
deviating 
to 
this 
side 
or 
that, 
in 
ever-varying 
mazes, 
let 
him 
look 
at 
the 
planet 
Jupiter, 
which, 
as 
this 
telescope 
shows, 
certainly 
carries 
in 
its 
train 
not 
one 
such 
companion 
only, 
like 
the 
earth, 
as 
Copernicus 
showed, 
but 
actually 
four, 
that 
neverleaveit,thoughallthetime 
hastening 
eachinits 
ownorbit. 


But 
enough 
has 
been 
said 
about 
these 
matters 
in 
my 
Discussion 
with 
the 
Sidereal 
Messenger. 
It 
is 
time 
that 
I 
should 
turn 
to 
those 
discoveries 
which 
have 
been 
made 
since 
the 
publication 
of 
Galileo’s 
Sidereal 
Messenger, 
and 
sincemy 
Discussion 
withit, 
bymeansofthis 
telescope. 


Galileo’s 
discovery 
of 
Saturn’s 
ring 
(imperfectly). 
It 
is 
now 
just 
a 
year 
since 
Galileo 
wrote 
to 
Prague, 
and 
gave 
full 
notice 
that 
he 
had 
detected 



something 
new 
in 
the 
heavens 
beyond 
his 
former 
discoveries; 
and 
that 
there 
might 
not 
be 
any 
one 
who, 
with 
the 
intention 
of 
detracting 
from 
his 
credit, 
should 
try 
to 
pass 
himself 
off 
as 
an 
earlier 
observer 
of 
the 
phenomenon, 
Galileo 
gave 
a 
certain 
space 
of 
time 
for 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
new 
phenomena 
which 
any 
one 
had 
seen; 
he 
himself 
meanwhile 
described 
his 
discovery 
in 
letters 
transposed 
in 
this 
manner: 
smai 
smrmil 
mepoeta 
leumibunnugttauiras. 
Out 
of 
these 
letters 
I 
made 
an 
uncouth 
verse 
which 
I 
inserted 
in 
my 
Short 
Account 
in 
the 
month 
of 
September 
of 
last 
year: 
— 


Salveumbistineum22 
geminatumMartiaproles. 


Hail, 
twincompanionship,children 
ofMars. 


But 
I 
was 
a 
very 
long 
way 
from 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
letters; 
it 
contained 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
Mars; 
and, 
not 
to 
detain 
you, 
reader, 
here 
is 
the 
solution 
of 
theriddle 
inthewords 
ofGalileohimself,theauthorofit:23 
— 


“Di

Ma 
passando 
ad 
altro, 
giacchè 
il 
Sig. 
Keplero 
ha 
in 
questa 
sua 
ultima

stampate 
le

che 
io

mando 
a 
Vostra 
Signoria 
Illustrissima 
per 
participarlo 
con 
Sua 
Maestà 
col 
Sig. 
Keplero 
e 
con 
chi 
piacerà

Altissimumplanetamtergeminumobservavi. 


Questo 
è, 
che 
Saturno 
con 
mia 
grandissima 
ammirazione 
ho 
osservato 
essere 
non 
una 
stella 
sola, 
ma 
tre 
insieme, 
le 
quali 
quasi 
si 
toccano; 
e 
sono 
trà 
di 
loro 
totalmente 
immobili, 
e 
constituite 
in 
questa 
guisa 
Quella 
di 
mezzo 
è 
assai 
più 
grande 
delle 
laterali; 
sono 
situate 
una 
da 
oriente, 
l’altra 
da 
occidente, 
nella 
medesima 
linea 
retta 
a 
capello; 
non 
sono 
giustamente 
secondo 
la 
dirittura 
del 
Zodiaco, 
ma 
l’occidentale 
si 
eleva 
alquanto 
verso 
Borea; 
forse 
sono 
parallele 
all’ 
Equinoziale?]. 
Se 
si 
guarderanno 
con 
un 
occhiale 
che 
non 
sia 
di 
grandissima 
moltiplicazione, 
non 
appariranno 
tre 
stelle 
ben 
distinte, 
ma 
parrà, 
che 
Saturno 
sia 
una 
stella 
lunghetta 
in 
forma 
di 
un’ 
oliva, 
così, 
Ma 
servendosi 
di 
un 
occhiale 
che 
moltiplichi 
più 
di 
mille 
volte 
in 
superficie, 
si 
vedranno 
tre 
globi 
distintissimi, 
che 
quasi 
si 
toccano, 
non 
apparendo 
trà 
essi 
maggior 
divisione 
di 
un 
sottil 
filo 
oscuro. 
Or 
ecco

Although 
these 
words 
differ 
little 
from 
Latin, 
yet 
I 
will 
translate 
them 
that 
no 
difficulty 
may 
hinder 
my 
reader 
from 
following 
me. 
Thus 
then 
Galileo 
writes:— 
“But 
to 
come 
now 
to 
my 
second 
topic. 
Since 
Kepler 
has 
published 
in 
that 
recent 
‘Narrative’ 
of 
his 
the 
letters 
which 
I 
sent 
as 
an 
anagram 
to 
your 
illustrious 
Lordship, 
and 
since 
an 
intimation 
has 
been 
given 
me 
that 
his 
Majesty 
desires 
to 
be 
taught 
the 
meaning 
of 
those 
letters, 
I 
send 
it 
to 
your 
illustrious 
Lordship, 
that 
your 
Lordship 
may 
communicate 
it 
to 
his 
Majesty, 
toKepler,and 
toany 
oneyourLordshipmay 
wish. 


“Theletterswhenjoinedtogether 
astheyoughtto 
be,saythis, 


‘Altissimumplanetamtergeminumobservavi,’ 


‘Ihave 
observedthemostdistant 
oftheplanetstohave 
atripleform.’ 


“For 
in 
truth 
Ihave 
foundout 
with 
the 
mostintense 
surprisethatthe 
planet 
Saturn 
is 
not 
merely 
one 
single 
star, 
but 
three 
stars 
very 
close 
together, 
so 
much 
so 
that 
they 
are 
all 
but 
in 
contact 
one 
with 
another. 
They 
are 
quite 
immovable 
with 
regard 
to 
each 
other, 
and 
are 
arranged 
in 
this 
manner, 
The 
middle 
star 
of 
the 
three 
is 
by 
far 
greater 
than 
the 
two 
on 
either 
side. 
They 
are 
situated 
one 
towards 
the 
east, 
the 
other 
towards 
the 
west, 
in 
one 
straight 
line 
to 
a 
hair’s-breadth; 
not, 
however, 
exactly 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
Zodiac, 
for 
the 
star 
furthest 
to 
the 
west 
rises 
somewhat 
towards 
the 
north; 
perhaps 
they 
are 
parallel 
to 
the 
equator. 
If 
you 
look 
at 
them 
through 
a 
glass 
that 
does 
not 
multiply 
much, 
the 
stars 
will 
not 
appear 
clearly 
separate 
from 
one 
another, 
but 
Saturn’s 
orb 
will 
appear 
somewhat 
elongated, 
of 
the 
shape 
of 
an 
olive, 
thus, 
But 
if 
you 
should 
use 
a 
glass 
which 
multiplies 
a 
surface 
more 
than 
a 
thousand 
times, 
there 
will 
appear 
very 
distinctly 
three 
orbs, 
almost 
touching 
one 
another; 
and 
they 
will 
be 
thought 
to 
be 
not 
farther 
apart 
than 
the 
breadth 
of 
a 
very 
fine 
and 
scarcely 
visible 
thread. 
So 
you 
see 
a 
guard 
of 
satellites 
has 
been 
found 
for 
Jupiter, 
and 
for 
the 
decrepit 
little 
old 
man 
two 
servants 
to 
help 
his 
steps 
and 
never 
leave 
his 
side. 
Concerning 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
planets 
I 
have 
foundnothingnew.” 


So 
says 
Galileo; 
but 
if 
I 
may 
do 
so, 
I 
will 
not 
make 
an 
old 
dotard 
out 
of 
Saturn, 
and 
two 
servants 
for 
him 
out 
of 
his 
companion 
orbs, 
but 
rather 
out 
of 
thosethreeunited 
bodiesIwillmakeatripleGeryon,outofGalileoHercules, 
and 
out 
of 
the 
telescope 
his 
club, 
armed 
with 
which, 
Galileo 
has 
conquered 
that 
most 
distant 
of 
the 
planets, 
drawn 
it 
out 
of 
the 
furthest 
recesses 
of 
nature, 



dragged 
it 
down 
to 
earth, 
and 
exposed 
it 
to 
the 
gaze 
of 
us 
all. 
It 
pleases 
me 
too, 
now 
that 
the 
nest 
has 
been 
found, 
to 
consider 
with 
curiosity 
what 
kind 
of 
brood 
must 
be 
in 
it, 
what 
kind 
of 
life, 
if 
there 
be 
any 
life 
there, 
between 
orbs 
which

butwherethereisscarcelyachinkofanail’s-breadthallround. 


Do 
indeed 
the 
astrologers 
rightly 
ascribe 
to 
Saturn 
the 
guardianship 
of 
miners, 
who, 
accustomed 
to 
spend 
their 
lives, 
like 
moles, 
underground, 
seldom 
breathe 
the 
free 
air 
under 
the 
open 
sky? 
Although 
the 
darkness 
here 
is 
rather 
more 
supportable 
than 
in 
Saturn, 
because 
the 
sun, 
which 
appears 
there 
only 
as 
large 
as 
Venus 
appears 
to 
us 
on 
the 
earth, 
continually 
casts 
its 
rays 
through 
the 
spaces 
between 
the 
different 
orbs 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
those 
inhabitants 
who 
are 
situated 
on 
one 
orb 
are 
covered 
by 
the 
other 
as 
by 
a 
ceiling; 
while 
those 
on 
the 
latter 
orb, 
on 
the 
top 
of 
this 
roof 
of 
theirs, 
exposed 
as 
it 
is 
to 
the 
full 
light 
of 
the 
sun, 
receive 
a 
glare 
as 
if 
from 
very 
firebrands. 
But 
I 
must 
draw 
in 
the 
reins 
and 
check 
my 
mind 
in 
its 
enjoyment 
of 
the 
free 
fieldsof 
ether; 
for 
fear,perchance, 
later 
observations 
shouldreport 
something 
differentfromthefirstaccount,something 
changedincourseof

Account 
of 
Galileo’s 
discovery 
of 
the 
phases 
of 
Venus. 


At 
the 
end 
of 
his 
letter 
Galileo 
seemed 
to 
think 
that 
he 
had 
come 
to 
the 
end 
of 
his 
reports 
about 
the 
planets, 
and 
observations 
of 
new 
phenomena 
respecting 
them, 
but 
ever 
on 
the 
watch, 
that 
eye 
of 
his, 
that 
one 
not 
of 
Nature’s 
making 


— 
I 
mean 
his 
telescope 
— 
in 
a 
short 
time 
made 
more 
discoveries, 
concerning 
which 
readthefollowingletter 
ofGalileo:

the 
marvels

In

a 
certain

splendid

you 
do 
so, 
I 
should 
like 
you 
to 
notice, 
by 
the 
way, 
what 
Galileo 
says 
about 
the 
Pythagorean 
and 
Copernican 
system 
of 
the 
universe. 
For 
he 


26 


points 
to 
my 
Mystery 
of 
the 
Universe, 
published 
fourteen 
years 
ago, 
in 
which 
I 
took 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
Planetary 
orbits 
according 
to 
the 
astronomy 
of 
Copernicus, 
who 
makes 
the 
sun 
immovable 
in 
the 
centre, 
and 
the 
earth 
movable 
both 
round 
the 
sun 
and 
upon 
its 
own 
axis; 
and 
I 
showed 
that 
the 
differences 
of 
their 
orbits 
corresponded 
to 
the 
five 
regular 
Pythagorean 
figures, 
which 
had 
been 
already 
distributed 
by 
their 
author 
among 
the 
elements 
of 
the 
world, 
though 
the 
attempt 
was 
admirable 
rather 
than 
happy 
or 
legitimate, 
and 
for 
which 
figures’ 
sake 
Euclid 
wrote 
the 
whole 
of 
his 
Geometry. 
Now, 
in 
that 
Mystery 
you 
may 
find 
a 
sort 
of 
combination 
of 
Astronomy 
and 
Euclid’s 
Geometry, 
and 
through 
this 
combination 
a 
most 
thorough 
completion 
and 
finishing 
of 
them 
both; 
and 
this 
was 
the 
reason 
why 
I 
waited 
with 
intense 
longing 
to 
see 
what 
sort 
of 
an 
argument 
Galileo 
would 



produce 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
Pythagorean 
system 
of 
the 
universe. 
After 
this 


explanation,Galileo’s 
letteraboutthisargumentwas 
asfollows:

“IllustrissimoeReverendissimoSignoremiocolendissimo.

“È 
tempo 
che 
io 
deciferi 
a 
Vostra 
Signoria 
Illustrissima 
e 
Reverendissima 
e 
per 
lei 
al 
Sig. 
Keplero 
le 
lettere 
trasposte 
le 
quali 
alcune 
settimane 
sono 
le 
inviai; 
è 
tempo 
dico, 
giacchè 
sono 
interamente 
chiaro 
della 
verità 
del 
fatto, 
sicchè 
non 
ci 
resta 
un 
minimo 
scrupolo, 
o 
dubbio. 
Sapranno 
dunque 
come 
circa 
a 
tre 
mesi 
fa 
vedendosi 
Venere 
vespertina 
la 
cominciai 
ad 
osservar 
diligentemente 
coll’occhiale, 
per 
veder 
col 
senso 
stesso 
quello 
di 
che 
non 
dubitava 
punto 
l’intelletto. 
La 
vidi 
dunque 
sul 
principio 
di 
figura 
rotonda, 
pulita 
e 
terminata, 
ma 
molto 
picciola; 
di 
tal 
figura 
si 
mantenne 
sino 
che 
cominciò 
ad 
avvicinarsi 
alla 
sua 
massima 
digressione, 
ma 
tra 
tanto 
andò 
crescendo 
in 
mole. 
Cominciò 
poi 
a 
mancare 
dalla 
rotondità 
nella 
sua 
parte 
orientale 
ed 
avversa 
al 
Sole, 
e 
in 
pochi 
giorni 
si 
ridusse 
ad 
esser 
un 
mezzo 
cerchio 
perfettissimo, 
e 
tale 
si 
mantenne, 
senza 
punto 
alterarsi, 
finchè 
incominciò 
à 
ritirarsi 
verso 
il 
Sole, 
allontanandosi 
dalla 
tangente. 
Ora 
va 
calando 
dal 
mezzo 
cerchio, 
e 
si 
mostra 
cornicolata, 
e 
anderà 
assottigliandosi 
sino 
all’occultazione, 
riducendosi 
allora 
con 
corna 
sottilissime. 
Quindi 
passando 
all’apparizione 
mattutina, 
la 
vedremo 
pur 
falcata, 
e 
sottilissima 
e 
colle 
corna 
avverse 
al 
Sole; 
anderà 
poi 
crescendo 
fino 
alla 
massima 
digressione, 
dove 
apparirà 
semicircolare, 
e 
tale 
senza 
alterarsi 
si 
manterrà 
molti 
giorni, 
e 
poi 
dal 
mezzo 
cerchio 
passerà 
presto 
al 
tutto 
tondo, 
e 
così 
rotonda 
si 
conserverà 
poi 
per 
molti 
mesi. 
Il 
suo 
diametro 
adesso 
è 
circa 
cinque 
volte 
maggiore 
di 
quello, 
che 
si 
mostrava 
nella 
sua 
prima 
apparizione 
vespertina; 
dalla 
quale 
mirabile 
esperienza 
abbiamo 
sensata, 
e 
certa 
dimostrazione 
di 
due 
gran 
questioni 
state 
fin 
qui 
dubbie 
trà 
i 
maggiori 
ingegni 
del 
Mondo. 
L’una 
è, 
che 
i 
Pianeti 
tutti 
son 
di 
lor 
natura 
tenebrosi 
(accadendo 
anco 
a 
Mercurio 
l’istesso, 
che 
a 
Venere). 
L’altra, 
che 
Venere 
necessarissimamente 
si 
volge 
intorno 
al 
Sole, 
come 
anco 
Mercurio, 
cosa, 
che 
degli 
altri 
Pianeti, 
fu 
creduta 
da’ 
Pitagorici, 
dal 
Copernico, 
dal 
Keplero 
e 
da’ 
loro 
seguaci, 
ma 
non 
sensatamente 
provata, 
come 
ora 
in 
Venere, 
ed 
in 
Mercurio. 


“Averanno 
dunque 
il 
Sig. 
Keplero, 
e 
gli 
altri 
Copernicani 
da 
gloriarsi 
di 
aver 
creduto 
e 
filosofato 
bene, 
sebbene 
ci 
è 
toccato, 
e 
ci 
è 
per 
toccare 
ancora 
ad 
esser 
reputati 
dall’ 
università 
dei 
Filosofi 
in 
libris, 
per 
poco 
intendenti, 
e 
pocomenochestolti.

Suchis 
Galileo’sletter;butletmegive 
youthesubstanceof 
it: 
— 


“It 
is 
time 
for 
me 
to 
disclose 
the 
method 
of 
reading 
the 
letters 
which 
some 
weeks 
since 
I 
sent 
you 
as 
an 
anagram. 
It 
is 
time 
now, 
I 
mean, 
after 
I 
have 
become 
quite 
certain 
about 
the 
matter, 
so 
much 
so 
that 
I 
have 
no 
longer 
even 
a 
shadow 
of 
doubt. 
You 
must 
know 
then 
that 
about 
three 
months 
ago, 
when 
the 
star 
of 
Venus 
could 
be 
seen, 
I 
began 
to 
look 
at 
it 
through 
a 
telescope 
with 
great 
attention, 
so 
that 
I 
might 
grasp 
with 
my 
physical 
senses 
an 
idea 
which 
I 
was 
entertaining 
as 
certain. 
At 
first 
then 
you 
must 
know 
the 
planet 
Venus 
appearedof 
aperfectlycircularform, 
accuratelyso, 
andboundedbyadistinct 
edge, 
but 
very 
small; 
this 
figure 
Venus 
kept 
until 
it 
began 
to 
approach 
its 
greatest 
distance 
from 
the 
sun, 
and 
meanwhile 
the 
apparent 
size 
of 
its 
orb 
kept 
on 
increasing. 
From 
that 
time 
it 
began 
to 
lose 
its 
roundness 
on 
the 
eastern 
side, 
which 
was 
turned 
away 
from 
the 
sun, 
and 
in 
a 
few 
days 
it 
contracted 
its 
visible 
portion 
into 
an 
exact 
semicircle; 
that 
figure 
lasted 
without 
the 
smallest 
alteration 
until 
it 
began 
to 
return 
towards 
the 
sun 
where 
it 
leaves 
the 
tangent 
drawn 
to 
its 
epicycle.27 
At 
this 
time 
it 
loses 
the 
semicircular 
form 
more 
and 
more, 
and 
keeps 
on 
diminishing 
that 
figure 
until 
itsconjunction, 
when 
itwillwane 
toaverythin 
crescent. 
Aftercompleting 
its 
passage 
past 
the 
sun, 
it 
will 
appear 
to 
us, 
at 
its 
appearance 
as 
a 
morning 
star, 
as 
only 
sickle-shaped, 
turning 
a 
very 
thin 
crescent 
away 
from 
the 
sun; 
afterwards 
the 
crescent 
will 
fill 
up 
more 
and 
more 
until 
the 
planet 
reaches 
its 
greatest 
distance 
from 
the 
sun, 
in 
which 
position 
it 
will 
appear 
semicircular, 



and 
that 
figure 
will 
last 
for 
many 
days 
without 
appreciable 
variation. 
Then 
by 
degrees, 
from 
being 
semicircular 
it 
will 
change 
to 
a 
full 
orb, 
and 
will 
keep 
that 
perfectly 
circular 
figure 
for 
several 
months; 
but 
at 
this 
instant 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
orb 
of 
Venus 
is 
about 
five 
times 
as 
large 
as 
that 
which 
it 
showedatits 
firstappearanceas 
anevening 
star. 


“From 
the 
observation 
of 
these 
wonderful 
phenomena 
we 
are 
supplied 
with 
a 
determination 
most 
conclusive, 
and 
appealing 
to 
the 
evidence 
of 
our 
senses, 
of 
two 
very 
important 
problems, 
which 
up 
to 
this 
day 
were 
discussed 
by 
the 
greatest 
intellects 
with 
different 
conclusions. 
One 
is 
that 
the 
planets 
are 
bodies 
not 
self-luminous 
(if 
we 
may 
entertain 
the 
same 
views 
about 
Mercury 
as 
we 
do 
about 
Venus). 
The 
second 
is 
that 
we 
are 
absolutely 
compelled 
tosaythatVenus(andMercuryalso)revolves 
roundthesun,asdo 
also 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
planets. 
A 
truth 
believed 
indeed 
by 
the 
Pythagorean 
school, 
by 
Copernicus, 
and 
by 
Kepler, 
but 
never 
proved 
by 
the 
evidence 
of 
our 
senses, 
as 
it 
is 
now 
proved 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Venus 
and 
Mercury. 
Kepler 
therefore 
and 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
school 
of 
Copernicus 
have 
good 
reason 
for 
boasting 
that 
they 
have 
shown 
themselves 
good 
philosophers, 
and 
that 
their 
belief 
was 
not 
devoid 
of 
foundation; 
however 
much 
it 
has 
been 
their 
lot, 
and 
may 
even 
hereafter 
be 
their 
lot, 
to 
be 
regarded 
by 
the 
philosophers 
of 
our 
times, 
who 
philosophise 
on 
paper, 
with 
an 
universal 
agreement, 
as 
men 
of 
no 
intellect, 
andlittle 
betterthan 
absolutefools.

days

I 
observed 
an 
eclipse 
of 
the 
moon, 
but 
not 
anything 
worthy 
of 
special 
notice 
occurred 
in 
it. 
Only 
the 
edge 
of 
the 
shadow 
appeared 
indistinct, 
blurred, 
and 
hazy; 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
phenomenon 
no 
doubt 
is 
that 
the 
shadow 
has 
its 
origin 
at 
the 
earth, 
at 
a 
great 
distance 
from 
the 
body 
of 
the 
moon.

some 
other 
particulars,

I 
am

by 
time 
from

aboutthem,etc.” 


Sowrites 
Galileo. 



What 
now, 
dear 
reader, 
shall 
we 
make 
out 
of 
our 
telescope? 
Shall 
we 
make 
a 
Mercury’s 
magic-wand 
to 
cross 
the 
liquid 
ether 
with, 
and, 
like 
Lucian,28 
lead 
a 
colony 
to 
the 
uninhabited 
evening 
star, 
allured 
by 
the 
sweetness 
of 
the 
place? 
or 
shall 
we 
make 
it 
a 
Cupid’s 
arrow, 
which, 
entering 
by 
our 
eyes, 
has 
pierced 
our 
inmost 
mind, 
and 
fired 
us 
with 
a 
love 
of 
Venus? 
For 
what 
language 
is 
too 
strong 
for 
the 
marvellous 
beauty 
of 
this 
orb, 
if, 
having 
no 
light 
of 
its 
own, 
it 
can 
attain 
simply 
by 
the 
borrowed 
light 
of 
the 
sun 
to 
such 
splendour, 
as 
Jupiter 
has 
not, 
nor 
the 
moon, 
though 
enjoying 
a 
proximity 
to 
the 
sun 
as 
close 
as 
Venus; 
for 
if 
the 
moon’s 
light 
be 
compared 
with 
the 
light 
of 
Venus, 
it 
will 
be 
seen 
to 
be 
certainly 
greater 
on 
account 
of 
the 
apparent 
magnitude 
of 
the 
moon, 
but, 
in 
comparison 
with 
the 
light 
of 
Venus, 
dull, 
dead, 
and 
leaden. 
O 
truly 
golden 
Venus! 
Will 
any 
one 
doubt 
any 
more 
that 
the 
whole 
orb 
of 
Venus 
is 
wrought 
most 
smoothly 
out 
of 
pure 
unalloyed 
gold, 
since 
its 
surface, 
when 
only 
placed 
in 
the 
sunlight, 
reflects 
a 
splendour 
so 
intense! 
And 
here 
let 
me 
add 
my 
experiments 
about 
the 
alteration 
of 
the 
light 
of 
Venus 
on 
blinking 
the 
eye, 
which 
I 
have 
examined 
in 
the 
part 
of 
my 
Astronomy 
which 
treats 
of 
Optics. 
Reasoning 
will 
be 
able 
to 
conclude 
nothing 
else 
but 
this, 
that 
the 
orb 
of 
Venus 
turns 
on 
its 
own 
axis 
with 
an 
exceedingly 
swift 
rotation, 
displaying 
one 
after 
another 
different 
parts 
of 
its 
surface 
which 
are 
more 
or 
less 
capable 
of 
retaining 
the 
sun’s 
light.29 


Galileo’s 
conclusions 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
inherent 
nature 
of 
the 
brightness 
of 
the 
stars. 


But 
enough 
of 
my 
own 
conclusions. 
Let 
us 
now 
hear 
as 
an 
epilogue 
Galileo’s 
conclusions 
built 
up 
out 
of 
all 
the 
observations 
which 
he 
has 
made 
with 
his 
telescope,andannounced 
fromtimetotime.

splendore, 
e 
più 
illustremente 
ce 
lo 
riverberano; 
e 
perciò 
Marte 
perigeo, 
e 
a 
noi 
vicinissimo 
si 
vede 
assai 
più 
splendido, 
che 
Giove; 
benchè 
a 
quello 
di 
mole 
assai 
inferiore; 
e 
difficilmente 
se 
gli 
può 
coll’ 
occhiale 
levare 
quella 
irradiazione, 
che 
impedisce 
il 
vedere 
il 
suo 
disco 
terminato, 
e 
rotondo; 
il 
che 
in 
Giove 
non 
accade, 
vedendosi 
esquisitamente 
circolare. 
Saturno 
poi 
per 
la 
sua 
gran 
lontananza 
si 
vede 
esattamente 
terminato, 
sì 
la 
Stella 
maggiore 
di 
mezzo, 
come 
le 
due 
piccole 
laterali; 
ed 
appare 
il 
suo 
lume 
languido, 
ed 
abbacinato 
e 
senza 
niuna 
irradiazione, 
che 
impedisca 
il 
distinguere 
i 
suoi 
tre 
piccoli 
globi 
terminatissimi. 
Ora 
poichè 
apertamente 
veggiamo, 
che 
il 
Sole 
molto 
splendidamente 
illustra 
Marte 
vicino, 
e 
che 
molto 
più 
languido 
è 
il 
lume 
di 
Giove 
(sebbene 
senza 
lo 
strumento 
appare 
assai 
chiaro, 
il 
che 
accade 
per 
la 
grandezza, 
e 
candore 
della 
Stella) 
languidissimo, 
e 
fosco 
quello 
di 
Saturno, 
come 
molto 
più 
lontano, 
quali 
doveriano 
apparirci 
le 
Stelle 
fisse 
lontane 
indicibilmente 
più 
di 
Saturno, 
quando 
il 
lume 
loro 
derivasse 
dal 
Sole? 
Certamente 
debolissime, 
torbide 
e 
smorte. 
Ma 
tutto 
l’opposito 
si 
vede, 
perocchè 
se 
rimireremo 
per 
esempio 
il 
Cane, 
incontreremo 
un 
fulgore 
vivissimo, 
che 
quasi 
ci 
toglie 
la 
vista, 
con 
una 
vibrazione 
di 
raggi 
tanto 
fiera, 
e 
possente, 
che 
in 
comparazione 
di 
quello 
rimangono 
i 
Pianeti, 
e 
dico 
Giove 
e 
Venere 
stessa, 
come 
un 
impurissimo 
vetro 
appresso 
un 
limpidissimo 
e 
finissimo 
diamante. 
E 
benchè 
il 
disco 
di 
esso 
Cane 
apparisca 
non 
maggiore 
della 
cinquantesima 
parte 
di 
quello 
di 
Giove, 
tuttavia 
la 
sua 
irradiazione 
è 
grande, 
e 
fiera 
in 
modo, 
che 
l’istesso 
globo 
tra 
i 
proprii 
crini 
s’implica, 
e 
quasi 
si 
perde, 
e 
con 
qualche 
difficoltà 
si 
distingue; 
dove 
che 
Giove 
(e 
molto 
più 
Saturno) 
si 
vedono 
e 
terminati, 
e 
di 
una 
luce 
languida, 
e 
per 
così 
dire 
quieta. 
E 
per 
tanto 
io 
stimo, 
che 
bene 
filosoferemo, 
referendo 
la 
causa 
della 
scintillazione 
delle 
Stelle 
fisse, 
al 
vibrare, 
che 
elle 
fanno 
dello 
splendore 
proprio 
e 
nativo 
dall’intima 
loro 
sustanza; 
dove 
che 
nella 
superficie 
de’ 
Pianeti 
termina 
più 
presto, 
e 
si 
finisce 
l’illuminazione, 
che 
dal 
Sole 
deriva, 
e 
si 
parte.

io 
sentirò

particolare 
questione 
ricevuta 
dal

Wackher, 
non 
resterò

When 
translated,the 
meaningisasfollows: 
— 


“Your 
last 
letter 
has 
exceedingly 
pleased 
me, 
especially 
that 
part 
which 
assures 
me 
of 
the 
friendly 
feeling 
entertained 
towards 
me 
by 
the 
most 
illustrious 
Imperial 
Counsellor, 
Wagher, 
which 
I 
for 
my 
part 
highly 
appreciate. 
And 
since 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
friendliness 
is, 
that 
I 
have 
incontestably 
demonstrated 
by 
some 
observations 
of 
mine 
certain 
conclusions 
which 
he 
had 
long 
held 
as 
true, 
I 
wish 
to 
confirm 
my 
possession 
of 
favour, 
which 
I 
value 
so 
much, 
and 
accordingly 
I 
ask 
you 
to 
give 
him 
this 
piece 
of 
news 
from 
me; 
that 
I 
have 
most 
conclusive 
arguments 
ready, 
showing 
clearly 
that, 
just 
as 
he 
holds, 
all 
the 
planets 
receive 
their 
light 
from 
the 
sun, 
being 
by 
constitution 
bodies 
dark 
and 
devoid 
of 
light;30 
but 
that 
the 
fixed 
stars 
shine 
by 
their 
own 
proper 
light, 
not 
needing 
to 
be 
illuminated 
by 
the 
sun’s 
rays, 
since 
God 
knows 
whether 
they 
reach 
the 
very 
remote 
region 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars 
with 
intensity 
even 
equal 
to 
the 
small 
intensity 
with 
which 
the 
rays 
of 
the 
fixed 
starscomedownto 
us. 


“My 
demonstration 
depends 
chiefly 
on 
this 
fact, 
that 
with 
the 
telescope 
I 
have 
distinctly 
observed 
that 
the 
planets 
receive 
greater 
brightness, 
and 
reflect 
it 
more 
intensely, 
in 
proportion 
as 
each 
one 
is 
nearer 
to 
us 
and 
to 
the 
sun. 
So 
Mars 
in 
perigee, 
that 
is, 
when 
nearest 
to 
the 
earth, 
greatly 
surpasses 



Jupiter 
in 
brightness, 
although 
in 
actual 
size 
it 
is 
far 
inferior 
to 
Jupiter; 
and 
in 
consequence 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
receive 
the 
effulgence 
of 
this 
planet 
in 
the 
telescope, 
for 
it 
is 
so 
great 
as 
to 
prevent 
the 
eye 
from 
being 
able 
to 
distinguish 
the 
circular 
termination 
of 
the 
planet’s 
disc. 
This 
does 
not 
happen 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Jupiter, 
for 
it 
appears 
quite 
circular. 
The 
next 
planet, 
Saturn, 
on 
account 
of 
its 
great 
distance 
likewise 
— 
for 
indeed 
it 
is 
the 
most 
remote 
of 
the 
planets, 
— 
appears 
bounded 
by 
a 
well-defined 
edge, 
both 
the 
greater 
orb 
in 
the 
middle 
and 
the 
two 
small 
orbs 
at 
its 
sides. 
Indeed, 
it 
appears 
to 
shine 
with 
a 
faint 
and 
delicate 
light, 
without 
any 
effulgence 
to 
prevent 
an 
observer 
recognising 
the 
well-defined 
termination 
of 
its 
three 
orbs. 
Since, 
then, 
we 
see 
that 
Mars, 
the 
nearest 
of 
the 
three, 
is 
illumined 
by 
the 
sun 
with 
very 
great 
splendour, 
and 
that 
the 
light 
of 
Jupiter, 
at 
a 
greater 
distance, 
is 
much 
more 
faint 
(although 
without 
the 
use 
of 
an 
instrument 
it 
appears 
tolerably 
bright, 
which 
is 
due 
to 
the 
size 
and 
brilliancy 
of 
its 
body), 
and 
that 
the 
light 
of 
Saturn, 
at 
the 
greatest 
distance, 
is 
most 
faint, 
and 
almost 
watery, 
of 
what 
kind, 
do 
you 
think, 
would 
appear 
the 
light 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
which 
are 
at 
an 
immeasurable 
distance 
further 
from 
the 
sun 
than 
Saturn, 
if 
they 
only 
received 
light 
from 
the 
sun? 
Most 
certainly, 
extremely 
feeble, 
indistinct, 
and 
pallid. 
And 
yet 
we 
find 
quite 
the 
contrary; 
for, 
let 
us 
look 
with 
our 
eyes 
at 
the 
Dog-
Star, 
for 
example. 
We 
shall 
encounter 
a 
most 
vivid 
brilliancy, 
which 
almost 
pricks 
the 
eye 
with 
the 
rapid 
sparkling 
of 
its 
rays, 
of 
such 
intensity 
that, 
in 
comparison 
with 
it, 
the 
planets, 
even 
Jupiter, 
and 
Venus 
too, 
are 
as 
thoroughly 
outshone 
as 
common 
and 
bad 
glass 
compared 
with 
a 
highly 
polished 
and 
most 
sparkling 
diamond. 
And 
although 
the 
orb 
of 
the 
Dog-Star 
appears 
no 
larger 
than 
the 
fiftieth 
part 
of 
Jupiter’s 
disc, 
nevertheless 
its 
brilliancy 
is 
great 
and 
very 
strong; 
so 
that 
the 
form 
of 
its 
disc, 
which 
you 
expect 
to 
see, 
hides 
itself 
among 
the 
rays 
of 
its 
own 
refulgence, 
envelops 
itself 
in 
them, 
and 
almost 
disappears; 
and 
it 
is 
not 
distinguished 
without 
some 
difficulty 
from 
the 
rays 
which 
surround 
it. 
Whereas 
Jupiter, 
and 
still 
more 
Saturn, 
are 
seen 
well 
defined; 
and 
their 
light 
is 
without 
intensity, 
and, 
if 
I 
may 
say 
so, 
quiescent. 
Wherefore 
I 
think 
that 
we 
shall 
rightly 
apply 
our 
philosophy 
if 
we 
refer 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
twinkling 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars 
to 
vibrations 
of 
a 
brilliancy, 
which 
is 
their 
own, 
belonging 
to 
their 
constitution, 
and 
inherent 
in 
their 
substance, 
and 
say, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
that 
the 
illumination 
of 
the 
planets, 
which 
is 
derived 
from 
the 
sun, 
and 
distributed 
to 
theworld,islimitedtotheirsurface.”

You 
see 
then, 
studious 
reader, 
how 
the 
subtle 
mind 
of 
Galileo, 
in 
my 
opinion 
the 
first 
philosopher 
of 
the 
day, 
uses 
this 
telescope

ours 
like

and,

darts 
the 
glances 
of 
his 
most 
acute 
intellect 
upon 
these 
petty

ours 
— 
the

The 
words 
used 
by 
Galileo 
for 
“telescope” 
are 
perspicillum, 
specillum 
instrumentum, 
organum, 
and 
occhiale 
(Ital.). 
Kepler 
uses 
also 
oculare 
tubus,

dioptrica. 
The 
word 
“telescopium” 
is 
used 
by 
Gassendi,1647.

The

represents 
the

H 
which, 
after 
refraction 
through 
the

reach 
the

The

the

H 
of 
the

would 
be 
just 
outside

The 
method, 
however, 
is 
at 
best 
only 
a 
very 
rough 
one, 
as 
the 
boundary 
of 
the

unavoidably 
indistinct.

The 
illumination 
of 
the 
Moon 
in 
eclipses, 
noticed 
by 
Galileo, 
is 
now 
referred 
to 
the 
refraction 
of 
the 
sunlight 
by 
the 
earth’s 
atmosphere, 
and 
the 
reddish 
colour 
of 
the 
light 
is 
explained 
by 
Herschel 
(Outlines 
of 
Astronomy, 
ch. 
vii.) 
to 
be 
due 
to 
the 
absorption 
of 
the 
violet

blue 
rays 
by 
the 
aqueous 
vapour 
of 
the 
Earth’s

idea 
of

Galileo’s 
Systema 
Mundi. 
Owing 
to 
the 
violent 
opposition 
provoked 
by 
the 
discussion 
of 
the 
discoveries 
of 
Galileo, 
and 
their 
bearingon 
theCopernican 
system 
of 
astronomy, 
Galileoseems 
to 
have 
found 
it 
necessary 
to 
delay 
the 
publication 
of 
this 
work 
until 
1632, 
when, 
believing 
himself 
safe 
under 
the 
friendship 
and 
patronage 
of 
Pope 
Urban 
VIII. 
and 
others 
in 
power 
at 
Rome, 
he 
at 
length 
published 
it. 
Urban, 
however, 
now 
turned 
against 
him, 
denounced 
the 
book 
and 
its 
author, 
and 
summoned 
him 
to 
Rome, 
wherethewell-known

The 
immense 
distance 
of 
stars 
makes 
it 
impossible 
for 
them 
to 
be 
magnified 
by 
any 
telescope, 
however 
powerful; 
the 
apparent 
or 
spurious

is 
an 
optical 
effect,

Galileo 
continues 
to 
call 
these 
bodies 
stars, 
perhaps 
meaning 
“Medicean 
stars,” 
throughout 
the 
description 
of 
their 
configurations, 
but 
as 
he 
had 
now 
detected 
their 
nature, 
it 
is 
more 
convenient 
to 
call 
them 
satellites,thetermintroducedby

Modern 
astronomers 
agree 
in 
assigning 
an 
atmosphere 
to 
Jupiter, 
but 
consider 
it 
not 
extensive 
enough 
to 
affect 
the 
brightness 
of 
the 
satellites. 
— 
(Webb, 
Celestial 
Objects 
for 
Common 
Telescopes.) 
Their 
absolute 
magnitudes 
are 
different, 
and 
their 
surfaces 
have 
been 
observed 
to 
be 
obscured 
by 
spots, 
which 
may 
account 
for 
the 
variations 
of 
their 
brightness. 
These 
spots, 
like 
the 
lunar 
spots, 
are 
probably 
due 
to 
variations 
of 
reflective 
power 
at 
different 
parts 
of 
their 
surfaces, 
for 
as 
they 
always 
turn 
the 
same 
face 
to 
Jupiter, 
they 
present 
different 
portions 
of 
their 
surfaces 
to 
us 
periodically, 
and 
it 
has 
been 



ascertained 
by 
observation 
that 
“these 
fluctuations 
in 
their 
brightness 
are 
periodical, 
depending 
on 
their 
position 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
Sun.”

Kepler 
says 
in 
his 
introduction 
to 
his 
Commentaries 
upon 
the 
Motions 
of 
the 
Planet 
Mars, 
that 
the 
theory 
of 
gravitation 
depends 
on 
certain 
axioms, 
one 
of 
which 
is 
that 
“heavy 
bodies 
do 
not 
tend 
to 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
universe, 
supposing 
the 
earth 
to 
be 
placed 
there, 
because 
that 
point 
is 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
universe, 
but 
because 
it 
is 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
earth. 
So, 
wherever 
the 
earth 
be 
set, 
or 
whithersoever 
it 
be 
transported, 
heavy 
bodies 
have 
a 
continual 
tendency 
to 
it.” 
Kepler’s 
object 
in 
this 
work 
was 
to 
correct 
the 
methods 
for 
determining 
the 
apparent 
places 
of 
the 
planets 
according 
to 
the 
three 
theories 
then 
current 
— 
the 
Ptolemaic,theCopernican, 
and 
thatofTycho 
Brahe. 


In 
1593 
the 
observed 
place 
of 
the 
planet 
Mars 
differed 
by 
nearly 
5° 
from 
the 
place 
calculated 
for 
it. 
Kepler 
accordingly 
studied 
the 
motions 
of 
this 
planet, 
and 
“by 
most 
laborious 
demonstrations 
and 
discussions 
of 
many 
observations,” 
arrived 
at 
the 
conclusions 
known 
as 
Kepler’s 
first 
and 
second 
laws; 
according 
towhich 
theCopernican 
systemofeccentrics 
and 
epicycles 
was 
replacedby 
anellipsewhose 
centreandeccentricitywere 
the 
same 
asthecentreandeccentricityof 
the 
eccentricintheoldermethod, 
and 
the 
Sun 
therefore 
was 
in 
one 
of 
the 
foci. 
Also 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
planet 
in 
its 
orbit 
was 
such 
that 
equal 
areas 
were 
described 
about 
the 
Sun 
by 
the 
radius 
vector 
of 
the 
planet 
in 
equal 
times.

The 
degree 
of 
accuracy 
attained 
by 
Kepler 
and 
Galileo 
with 
their 
imperfect 
instruments 
will 
be 
appreciated 
by 
comparing 
these 
statements 
with 
the 
determinations 
of 
later 
astronomers. 
Jupiter 
is 
about 
1300 
times 
the 
size 
of 
the 
Earth. 
Its 
diameter 
is 
about 
87,000 
miles; 
time 
of 
rotation, 
9 
h. 
55 
m. 
21 
sec.; 
time 
of 
revolution, 
4333 
days 
nearly. 
The 
angular 
diameter 
of 
the 
sun, 
seen 
from 
Jupiter, 
is 
between 
6´ 
and 
7´. 
The 
times

the

The 
completion 
of 
Galileo’s 
observations 
on 
Saturn 
depended 
on 
the 
improvement 
of 
astronomical 
instruments, 
as 
will 
be 
evident 
from 
the 
following 
sketch. 
Galileo 
made 
out 
the 
first 
indications 
of 
Saturn’s 
ring 
in 
1610, 
as 
narrated 
in 
his 
letter, 
with 
a 
power 
of 
thirty; 
but 
in 
December 
1612 
he 
wrote 
to 
one 
of 
his 
friends, 
Marco 
Velseri, 
that 
he 
could 
no 
longer 
see 
these 
indications, 
and 
began 
to 
imagine 
that 
his 
telescope 
had 
deceived 
him, 
and 
apparently 
abandoned 
further 
researches. 
Hevelius 
in 
1642 
saw 
the 
ring 
more 
clearly, 
but 
figured 
it 
as 
two 
crescents 
attached 
to 
Saturn 
by 
their 
cusps. 
At 
length, 
in 
1653, 
Huyghens 
provided 
himself 
with 
a 
power 
of 
one 
hundred, 
having 
made 
the 
lenses 
with 
his 
own 



hands, 
and 
immediately 
discovered 
the 
explanation 
of 
the 
phenomena 
which 
had 
baffled 
previous 
observers. 
He 
published 
his 
explanation 
of 
Saturn’s 
ring, 
and 
his 
discovery 
of 
the 
first 
satellite, 
in 
his 
Systema 
Saturnium, 
1659. 
Cassini, 
with 
still 
more 
powerful 
instruments, 
discovered 
four 
more 
satellites 
in 
1671, 
1672, 
1684. 
Sir 
William 
Herschel 
in 
1789 
detected 
two 
more, 
“which 
can 
only 
be 
seen 
with 
telescopes 
of 
extraordinary 
power 
and 
perfection, 
and 
under 
the 
most 
favourable 
atmospheric 
circumstances.” 
— 
(Herschel, 
Outlines 
of 
Astronomy, 
§ 
548.) 
And 
the 
last 
of 
the 
eight 
satellites 
was 
discoveredin 
1848 
by 
Lassellof 
Liverpool,andBond 
ofCambridge,U.S., 
simultaneously. 


26 
Kepler, 
in 
his 
Mystery 
of 
the 
Universe, 
endeavoured 
to 
connect 
the 
orbits 
of 
the 
planets 
with 
the 
five 
regular 
solids, 
thus: 
If 
in 
a 
sphere 
(i.) 
a 
cube 
be 
inscribed, 
and 
in 
the 
cube 
a 
sphere 
(ii.); 
and 
in 
that 
spherea 
tetrahedron,and 
in 
thetetrahedron 
a 
sphere(iii.); 
and 
in 
that 
sphere 
a 
dodecahedron,and 
inthe 
dodecahedron 
a 
sphere 
(iv.); 
and 
in 
that 
sphere 
an 
icosahedron, 
and 
in 
the 
icosahedron 
a 
sphere 
(v.); 
and 
in 
that 
sphere 
anoctahedron, 
and 
in 
the 
octahedron 
a 
sphere 
(vi.), 
the 
diameters 
of 
these 
six 
spheres 
will 
be 
proportional 
to 
the 
diameters 
of 
the 
orbits 
of 
Saturn, 
Jupiter, 
Mars, 
the 
Earth, 
Venus, 
and 
Mercury 
respectively; 
or, 
as 
Kepler 
expresses 
it, 
the 
common 
centre 
of 
these 
spheres 
represents 
the 
positionof 
the 
Sun,andthesix 
spheresrepresent 
the 
spheresof 
theplanets. 


By 
these 
considerations, 
however, 
Kepler 
was 
led 
to 
enunciate 
his 
third 
law, 
that 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
periodic 
times 
of 
planets 
are 
proportional 
to 
the 
cubes 
of 
their 
mean 
distances 
from 
the 
sun.

27 
In 
the 
Ptolemaic 
system 
the 
earth’s 
centre 
was 
regarded 
as 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
universe, 
and 
the 
movements 
of 
the 
heavenly 
bodies 
were 
explained 
by 
eccentrics 
and 
epicycles. 
The 
sun 
was 
conceived 
to 
describe 
a 
circle 
about 
a 
point 
not 
exactly 
coinciding 
with 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
earth, 
called 
the 
sun’s 
eccentric. 
The 
planets 
described 
epicycles 
(circles) 
whose 
centres 
described 
eccentrics 
(circles), 
and 
the 
centres 
of 
these 
eccentrics 
coincided 
with 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
sun’s 
eccentric. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
Mercury 
and 
Venus 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
epicycle 
was 
always 
on 
the 
line 
drawn 
from 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
eccentric 
to 
the 
sun’s 
centre. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
the 
other 
planets 
the 
construction 
was 
more 
complicated. 
The 
stationary 
points 
were 
determined 
by 
drawing 
tangents 
from 
the 
earth’s 
centre 
(or 
the 
observer) 
to 
the 
epicycle, 
as 
in 
the 
figure 
(1). 
— 
(Gassendi, 
Institutio 
Astronomica, 
1647.) 
This 
will 
explain 
Kepler’s 
description 
of 
the 
stationary 
points 
as 
the 
points 
where 
the 
planet 
leaves 
the 
tangent 
to 
its 
epicycle, 
supposing 
that 
he 
uses 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
current 
(i.e. 
Ptolemaic) 
astronomy. 
Copernicus 
placed 
the 
sun 
instead 
of 
the 
earth 
at 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
universe, 
but 
to 
determine 
the 
positions 
of 
the 
planets 
at 
any 
given 
time 
with 
as 
much 
accuracy 
as 
was 
attainable 
with 
the 
Ptolemaic 
system, 
he 
was 
obliged 
to 
use 
a 
similar 
method 
of 
eccentrics 
and 
epicycles, 
so 
that 
Kepler’s 
expression 
may 
be 
understood 
to 
describe 
the 
stationary 
points 
according 
to 
the 
Copernican 
theory, 
though 
it 
is 
still 
strange 
that 
he 
should 
not 
recognise 
the 
elliptical 
form 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbits, 
which 
he 
had 
lately 
demonstrated 
after 
most 
laborious 
reasoning 
in 
his 
Commentaries 
on 
the 
Motion 
of 
the 
Planet 
Mars, 
1609. 
Galileo’s 
own 
expression 
seems 
to 
describe 
the 
stationary 
points 
according 
to 
the 
Copernican 
system, 
as 
would 
be 
expected,

LETTER 
TO 
THE 
GRAND 
DUCHESS 
CHRISTINA 



Translated 
by 
Thomas 
Salusbury 


The 
Grand 
Duchess 
Christina 
(see 
Figure 
1) 
was 
granddaughter 
to 
the 
infamous 
Catherine 
de’ 
Medici, 
daughter 
of 
Charles 
III 
of 
Lorraine, 
and 
wife 
of 
Duke 
Ferdinando 
I 
de’ 
Medici 
of 
Tuscany 
– 
a 
powerful 
political 
and 
societal 
figure. 
With 
a 
perfect 
storm 
of 
(unjustified) 
criticism 
over 
Sidereus 
Nuncius 
arising 
from 
jealous 
scientists, 
scheming 
politicians 
and 
the 
Church, 
Galileo 
needed 
a 
powerful 
protector. 
Having 
heard 
that 
Christina 
was 
somewhat 
sympathetic 
to 
his 
astronomical 
arguments, 
he 
wrote 
a 
letter 
to 
her 
in 
1615 
(five 
years 
after 
the 
book 
appeared) 
— 
an 
expanded 
and 
more 
detailed 
version 
of 
an 
earlier 
letter 
to 
Benedetto 
Castelli. 
Manuscript 
copies 
of 
this 
letter 
circulated, 
and 
it 
finally 
appeared 
in 
print 
in 
1636 
(see 
Figure 
2). 
The 
letter 
is 
far 
clearer 
about 
Galileo’s 
views 
than 
the 
book, 
as 
can 
be 
seen 
in 
thefollowingtwo 
extracts: 


“Some

and 
overturn 
the

They 
seemed 
to 
forget 
that 
the

of 
known 
truths 
stimulates 
the 
investigation,

and 
growth 
of 
the 
arts; 
not

“Persisting

to

and

any

that 
as 
to 
the 
arrangement 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
universe, 
I 
hold 
the 
sun 
to 
be 
situated 
motionless 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
revolution 
of 
the 
celestial 
orbs 
while 
the 
earth 
revolves 
about 
the 
sun. 
They 
know 
also 
that 
I 
support 
this 
position 
not 
only 
by 
refuting 
the 
arguments 
of 
Ptolemy 
and 
Aristotle, 
but 
by 
producing 
many 
counter



arguments; 
in 
particular, 
some 
which 
relate 
to 
physical 
effects 
whose 
causes 
can 
perhaps 
be 
assigned 
in 
no 
other 
way. 
In 
addition 
there 
are 
astronomical 
arguments 
derived 
from 
many 
things 
in 
my 
new 
celestial 
discoveries 
that 
plainly 
confute 
the 
Ptolemaic 
system 
while 
admirably 
agreeing 
with 
and 
confirming 
the 
contrary 
hypothesis. 
Possibly 
because 
they 
are 
disturbed 
by 
the 
known 
truth 
of 
other 
propositions 
of 
mine 
which 
differ 
from 
those 
commonly 
held, 
and 
therefore 
mistrusting 
their 
defence 
so 
long 
as 
they 
confine 
themselves 
to 
the 
field 
of 
philosophy, 
these 
men 
have 
resolved 
to 
fabricate 
a 
shield 
for 
their 
fallacies 
out 
of 
the 
mantle 
of 
pretended 
religion 
and 
the 
authority 
of 
the 
Bible. 
These 
they 
apply 
with 
little 
judgement 
to 
the 
refutation 
of 
arguments 
that 
they 
do 
not 
understand 
and 
have 
not 
even 
listenedto.”

TO 
HERMOST 
SERENE 
HIGHNESTHEGRANDUCHESS 
MOTHER. 


SOme 
years 
since, 
as 
Your 
most 
Serene 
Highness 
well 
knoweth, 
I 
did 
discover 
many 
particulars 
in 
Heaven 
that 
had 
been 
unseen 
and 
unheard 
of 
untill 
this 
our 
Age; 
which, 
as 
well 
for 
their 
novelty, 
as 
for 
certain 
consequences 
which 
depend 
upon 
them, 
clashing 
with 
some 
Physical 
Propositions 
commonly 
received 
by 
the 
Schools, 
did 
stir 
up 
against 
me 
no 
small 
number 
of 
such 
as 
professed 
the 
vulgar 
Philosophy 
in 
the 
Universities; 
as 
if 
I 
had 
with 
my 
own 
hand 
newly 
placed 
these 
things 
in 
Heaven 
to 
obscure 
and 
disturb 
Nature 
and 
the 
Sciences: 
who 
forgetting 
that 
the 
multitude 
of 
Truths 
contribute, 
and 
concur 
to 
the 
investigation, 
augmentation, 
and 
establishment 
of 
the 
Arts, 
and 
not 
to 
their 
diminution, 
and 
destruction; 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
shewing 
themselves 
more 
affectionate 
to 
their 
own 
Opinions, 
than 
to 
Truth, 
went 
about 
to 
deny, 
and 
to 
disprove 
those 
Novelties; 
of 
which 
their 
very 
sense, 
had 
they 
but 
pleased 
to 
have 
intentsly 
beheld 
them, 
would 
have 
rendered 
them 
thorowly 
assured. 
And 
to 
this 
purpose 
they 
alledged 
sundry 
things, 
and 
published 
certain 
Papers 
fraughted 
with 
vain 
discourses; 
and 
which 
was 
a 
more 
gross 
errour, 
interwoven 
with 
the 
attestations 
of 
the 
Sacred 
Scriptures, 
taken 
from 
places 
by 
them 
not 
rightly 
understood, 
and 
which 
did 
not 
any 
thing 
concern 
the 
point 
for 
which 
they 
were 
produced 
Into 
which 
errour 
perhaps 
they 
would 
not 
have 
run, 
if 
they 
had 
but 
been 
advertised 
of 
a 
most 
profitable 
Document 
which 
S. 
Augustine 
giveth 
us, 
concerning 
our 
proceeding 
warily, 
in 
making 
positive 
determinations 
in 
points 
that 
are 
obscure 
and 
hard 
to 
be 
understood 
by 
the 
meer 
help 
of 
ratiocination; 
where 
treating 
(as 
we) 
of 
a 
certain 
natural 
conclusion 
concerning 
Celestial 
Bodies, 
he 
thus 
writes: 
But 
now 
having 
evermore 
a 
respect 
to 
the 
moderation 
of 
pious 
Gravity, 
we 
ought 
to 
believe 
nothing 
unadvisedly 
in 
a 
doubtful 
point; 
lest 
we 
conceive 
a 
prejudice 
against 
that, 
in 
favour 
to 
our 
Errour, 
which 
Truth 
hereafter 
may 
discover 
to 
be 
no 
wise 
contrary 
totheSacredBooks 
eitherof 
the 
Oldor 
NewTestament.

It 
hath 
since 
come 
to 
pass, 
that 
Time 
hath 
by 
degrees 
discovered 
to 
every 
one 
the 
truths 
before 
by 
me 
indicated: 
and 
together 
with 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
fact, 
a 
discovery 
hath 
been 
made 
of 
the 
difference 
of 
humours 
between 
those 
who 
simply 
and 
without 
passion 
did 
refuse 
to 
admit 
such 
like 
Phaenomena 
for 
true, 
and 
those 
who 
to 
their 
incredulity 
had 
added 
some 
discomposed 
affection: 
For 
as 
those 
who 
were 
better 
grounded 
in 
the 
Science 
of 
Astronomy, 
and 
Natural 
Philosophy, 
became 
satisfied 
upon 
my 
first 
intimation 
ofthenews;soallthosewho 
stood 
not 
intheNegative,orindoubt 
for 
any 
other 
reason, 
but 
because 
it 
was 
an 
unlookt-for-Novelty, 
and 
because 
they 
had 
not 
an 
occasion 
of 
seeing 
a 
sensible 
experiment 
thereof, 
did 
by 
degrees 
come 
to 
satisfie 
themselves: 
But 
those, 
who 
besides 
the 
love 
they 
bore 
to 
to 
their 
first 
Errour, 
have 
I 
know 
not 
what 
imaginary 
interess 
to 
render 
them 
disaffected; 
not 
so 
much 
towards 
the 
things, 
as 
towards 
the 
Author 
of 
them, 
not 
being 
able 
any 
longer 
to 
deny 
them, 
conceal 
themselves 
under 
an 
obstinate 
silence; 
and 
being 
exasperated 
more 
than 
ever 
by 
that 
whereby 
those 
others 
were 
satisfied 
and 
convinced, 
they 
divert 
their 
thoughts 
to 
other 
projects, 
and 
seek 
to 
prejudice 
me 
some 
other 
wayes: 
of 
whom 
I 
profess 
that 
I 
would 
make 
no 
more 
account 
than 
I 
have 
done 
of 
those 
who 
heretofore 
have 
contradicted 
me 
(at 
whom 
I 
alwaies 
laugh, 
as 
being 
assured 
of 
the 
issue 
that 
the 
business 
is 
to 
have) 
but 
that 
I 
see 
that 
those 
new 
Calumnies 
and 
Persecutions 
do 
not 
determine 
in 
our 
greater 
or 
lesser 
Learning 
(in 
which 
I 
will 
scarce 
pretend 
to 
any 
thing) 
but 
extend 
so 
far 
as 
to 
attempt 
to 
asperse 
me 
with 
Crimes 
which 
ought 
to 
be, 
and 
are 
more 
abhorred 
by 
me 
than 
Death 
it 
self: 
Nor 
ought 
I 
to 
content 
my 
self 
that 
they 
are 
known 
to 
be 
unjust 
by 
those 
onely 
who 
know 
me 
and 
them, 
but 
by 
all 
men 
whatsoever. 
They 
persisting 
therefore 
in 
their 
first 
Resolution, 
Of 
ruining 
me 
and 
whatsoever 
is 
mine, 
by 
all 
imaginable 
waies; 
and 
knowing 
how 
that 
I 
in 
my 
Studies 
of 
Astronomy 
and 
Philosophy 
hold, 
as 
to 
the 
Worlds 
Systeme, 
That 
the 
Sun, 
without 
changing 
place, 
is 
situate 
in 
the 
Centre 
of 
the 
Conversion 
of 
the 
Celestial 
Orbes; 
and 
that 
the 
Earth, 
convertible 
about 
its 
own 
Axis, 
moveth 
it 
self 
about 
the 
Sun: 
And 
moreover 
understanding, 
that 
I 
proceed 
to 
maintain 
this 
Position, 
not 
onely 
by 
refuting 
the 
Reasons 
of 
Ptolomy 
and 
Aristotle, 
but 
by 
producing 
many 
on 
the 
contrary; 
and 
in 
particular, 
some 
Physical 
pertaining 
to 
Natural 
Effects, 
the 
causes 
of 
which 
perhapscan 
beby 
no 
other 
way 
assigned; 
and 
others 
Astronomical 
depending 



upon 
many 
circumstances 
and 
encounters 
of 
new 
Discoveries 
in 
Heaven, 
which 
manifestly 
confute 
the 
Ptolomaick 
Systeme, 
and 
admirably 
agree 
with 
and 
confirm 
this 
other 
Hypothesis: 
and 
possibly 
being 
ashamed 
to 
see 
the 
known 
truth 
of 
other 
Positions 
by 
me 
asserted, 
different 
from 
those 
that 
have 
been 
commonly 
received; 
and 
therefore 
distrusting 
their 
defence 
so 
long 
as 
they 
should 
continue 
in 
the 
Field 
of 
Philosophy: 
for 
th 
[...]se 
respects, 
I 
say, 
they 
have 
resolved 
to 
try 
whether 
they 
could 
make 
a 
Shield 
for 
the 
fallacies 
of 
their 
Arguments 
of 
the 
Mantle 
of 
a 
feigned 
Religion, 
and 
of 
the 
Authority 
of 
the 
Sacred 
Scriptures, 
applyed 
by 
them 
with 
little 
judgment 
to 
the 
confutation 
of 
such 
Reasons 
of 
mine 
as 
they 
had 
neither 
understood, 
nor 
so 
muchasheard. 


And 
first, 
they 
have 
indeavoured, 
as 
much 
as 
in 
them 
lay, 
to 
divulge 
an 
opiniou 
thorow 
the 
Universe, 
that 
those 
Propositions 
are 
contrary 
to 
the 
Holy 
Letters, 
and 
consequently 
Damnable 
and 
Heretical: 
And 
thereupon 
perceiving, 
that 
for 
the 
most 
part, 
the 
inclination 
of 
Mans 
Nature 
is 
more 
prone 
to 
imbrace 
those 
enterprizes, 
whereby 
his 
Neighbour 
may, 
although 
unjustly, 
be 
oppressed, 
than 
those 
from 
whence 
he 
may 
receive 
just 
incouragement; 
it 
was 
no 
hard 
matter 
to 
find 
those 
Complices, 
who 
for 
such 
(that 
is, 
for 
Damnable 
and 
Heretical) 
did 
from 
their 
Pulpits 
with 
unwonted 
confidence 
preach 
it, 
with 
but 
an 
unmerciful 
and 
less 
considerate 
injury, 
not 
only 
to 
this 
Doctrine, 
and 
to 
its 
followers, 
but 
to 
all 
Mathematicks 
and 
Mathematicians 
together. 
Hereupon 
assuming 
greater 
confidence, 
and 
vainly 
hoping 
that 
that 
Seed 
which 
first 
took 
root 
in 
their 
unsound 
mindes, 
might 
spread 
its 
branches, 
and 
ascend 
towards 
Heaven, 
they 
went 
scattering 
rumours 
up 
and 
down 
among 
the 
People, 
That 
it 
would, 
ere 
long 
be 
condemned 
by 
Supreme 
Authority: 
and 
knowing 
that 
such 
a 
Censure 
would 
supplant 
not 
onely 
these 
two 
Conclusions 
of 
the 
VVorlds 
Systeme, 
but 
would 
make 
all 
other 
Astronomical 
and 
Physical 
Observations 
that 
have 
correspondence 
and 
necessary 
connection 
therewith 
to 
become 
damnable, 
to 
facilitate 
the 
business 
they 
seek 
all 
they 
can 
to 
make 
this 
opinion 
(at 
least 
among 
the 
vulgar) 
to 
seem 
new, 
and 
peculiar 
to 
my 
self, 
not 
owning 
to 
know 
that 
Nicholas 
Copernicus 
was 
its 
Authour, 
or 
rather 
Restorer 
and 
Confirmer: 
a 
person 
who 
was 
not 
only 
a 
Catholick, 
but 
a 
Priest, 
Canonick, 
and 
so 
esteemed, 
that 
there 
being 
a 
Dispute 
in 
the 
Lateran 
Council, 
under 
Leo 
X. 
touching 
the 
correction 
of 
the 
Ecclesiastick 
Calender, 
he 
was 
sent 
for 
to 
Rome 
from 
the 
remotest 
parts 
of 
Germany, 
for 
to 
assist 
in 
this 
Reformation, 
which 
forthattime 
wasleftimperfect, 
onelybecause 
asthenthe 
true 
measure 



of 
the 
Year 
and 
Lunar 
Moneth 
was 
not 
exactly 
known: 
whereupon 
it 
was 
given 
him 
in 
charge 
by 
the 
Bishop 
of 
Sempronia, 
at 
that 
time 
Super-intendent 
in 
that 
Affair, 
to 
search 
with 
reiterated 
studies 
and 
pains 
for 
greater 
light 
and 
certainty, 
touching 
those 
Coelestial 
Motions. 
Upon 
which, 
with 
a 
labour 
truly 
Atlantick 
and 
with 
his 
admirable 
Wit, 
setting 
himself 
again 
to 
that 
Study, 
he 
made 
such 
a 
progress 
in 
these 
Sciences, 
and 
reduced 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
Coelestial 
Motions 
to 
such 
exactnesse, 
that 
he 
gained 
the 
title 
of 
an 
Excellent 
Astronomer. 
And, 
according 
unto 
his 
Doctrine, 
not 
only 
the 
Calendar 
hath 
been 
since 
regulated, 
but 
the 
Tables 
of 
all 
the 
Motions 
of 
the 
Planets 
have 
also 
been 
calculated: 
and 
having 
reduced 
the 
said 
Doctrine 
into 
six 
Books, 
he 
published 
them 
to 
the 
World 
at 
the 
instance 
of 
the 
Cardinal 
of 
Capua, 
and 
of 
the 
Bishop 
of 
Culma. 
And 
in 
regard 
that 
he 
had 
re-assumed 
this 
so 
laborious 
an 
enterprize 
by 
the 
order 
of 
The 
Pope; 
he 
dedicated 
his 
Book 
De 
Revolutionibus 
Coelestibus 
to 
His 
Successour, 
namely 
Paul 
III. 
which, 
being 
then 
also 
Printed, 
hath 
been 
received 
by 
The 
Holy 
Church, 
and 
read 
and 
studied 
by 
all 
the 
World, 
without 
any 
the 
least 
umbrage 
of 
scruple 
that 
hath 
ever 
been 
conceived 
at 
his 
Doctrine; 
The 
which, 
whilst 
it 
is 
now 
proved 
by 
manifest 
Experiments 
and 
necessary 
Demonstrations 
to 
have 
been 
well 
grounded, 
there 
want 
not 
persons 
that, 
though 
they 
never 
saw 
that 
same 
Book 
intercept 
the 
reward 
of 
those 
many 
Labours 
to 
its 
Authour, 
by 
causing 
him 
to 
be 
censured 
and 
pronounced 
anHeretick; 
and 
this, 
only 
to 
satisfie 
aparticular 
displeasure 
conceived, 
without 
any 
cause, 
against 
another 
man, 
that 
hath 
no 
otherinterestinCopernicus,butonlyas 
heisan 
approverofhisDoctrine. 


Now 
in 
regard 
of 
these 
false 
aspersions, 
which 
they 
so 
unjustly 
seek 
to 
throw 
upon 
me, 
I 
have 
thought 
it 
necessary 
for 
my 
justification 
before 
the 
World 
(of 
whose 
judgment 
in 
matters 
of 
Religion 
and 
Reputation 
I 
ought 
to 
make 
great 
esteem) 
to 
discourse 
concerning 
those 
Particulars, 
which 
these 
men 
produce 
to 
scandalize 
and 
subvert 
this 
Opinion, 
and 
in 
a 
word, 
to 
condemn 
it, 
not 
only 
as 
false, 
but 
also 
as 
Heretical; 
continually 
making 
an 
Hipocritical 
Zeal 
for 
Religion 
their 
shield; 
going 
about 
moreover 
to 
interest 
the 
Sacred 
Scriptures 
in 
the 
Dispute, 
and 
to 
make 
them 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
Ministers 
of 
their 
deceiptful 
purposes: 
and 
farthermore 
desiring, 
if 
I 
mistake 
not, 
contrary 
to 
the 
intention 
of 
them, 
and 
of 
the 
Holy 
Fathers 
to 
extend 
(that 
I 
may 
not 
say 
abuse) 
their 
Authority, 
so 
as 
that 
even 
in 
Conclusions 
meerly 
Natural, 
and 
not 
de 
Fide, 
they 
would 
have 
us 
altogether 
leave 
Sense 
and 
Demonstrative 
Reasons, 
for 
some 
place 
of 
Scripture 
which 
sometimes 
under 
the 
apparent 
words 
may 
contain 
a 
different 
sense. 
Now 
I 
hope 
to 
shew 
with 



how 
much 
greater 
Piety 
and 
Religious 
Zeal 
I 
proceed, 
than 
they 
do, 
in 
that 
I 
propose 
not, 
that 
the 
Book 
of 
Copernicus 
is 
not 
to 
be 
condemned, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
not 
to 
be 
condemned, 
as 
they 
would 
have 
it; 
without 
understanding 
it, 
hearing 
it, 
or 
so 
much 
as 
seeing 
it; 
and 
especially 
he 
being 
an 
Author 
that 
never 
treateth 
of 
matters 
of 
Religion 
or 
Faith; 
nor 
by 
Reasons 
any 
way 
depending 
on 
the 
Authority 
of 
Sacred 
Scriptures 
whereupon 
he 
may 
have 
erroniously 
interpreted 
them; 
but 
alwaies 
insists 
upon 
Natural 
Conclusions 
belonging 
to 
the 
Celestial 
Motions, 
handled 
with 
Astronomical 
and 
Geometrical 
Demonstrations. 
Not 
that 
he 
had 
not 
a 
respect 
to 
the 
places 
of 
the 
Sacred 
Leaves, 
but 
because 
he 
knew 
very 
well 
that 
his 
said 
Doctrine 
being 
demonstrated, 
it 
could 
not 
contradict 
the 
Scriptures, 
rightly, 
and 
according 
to 
their 
true 
meaning 
understood. 
And 
therefore 
in 
the 
end 
of 
his 
EpistleDedicatory, 
speakingto 
ThePope,he 
saiththus; 


Si 
fortasscerunt 
Mataeologi 
qui 
cum 
omnum 
Mathematicum 
ignari 
sint, 
tamen 
de 
[...]is 
judicium 
assumunt, 
propter 
aliquem 
locum 
Scripturae, 
malè 
ad 
suum 
propositum, 
detortum, 
ausi 
fuerint 
hoc 
meum 
institutum 
repre 
[...]endere 
ac 
insectari, 
illos 
nihil 
moror, 
adeò 
ut 
etiam 
illorum 
judicium, 
tanquam 
temerarium 
contemnam. 
Non 
enim 
obscurum 
est, 
Lactantium, 
celelebrem 
alioqui 
Scriptorem, 
sed 
Mathematicum 
parvum, 
admodum 
pueriliter 
de 
forma 
Terrae 
loqui, 
cùm 
deridet 
eos, 
qui 
Terram, 
Glob 
[...] 
formam 
habere 
prodiderunt. 
Itaque 
non 
debet 
mirum 
videri 
studiosis, 
si 
qui 
tales, 
nos 
etiam 
ridebunt. 
Mathemata 
Mathematicis 
scribuntur; 
quibus 
& 
hi 
nostri 
labores, 
(si 
me 
non 
fallit 
opinio) 
videbuntur 
etiam 
Reipublicae 
Ecclesiasticae 
conducere 
aliquid, 
cujus 
Principatum 
Tua 
Sanctitas

If 
there 
should 
chance 
to 
be 
any 
Mataeologists, 
who 
though 
ignorant 
in 
all 
the 
Mathematicks, 
yet 
pretending 
a 
skill 
in 
those 
Learnings, 
should 
dare, 
upon 
the 
authority 
of 
some 
place 
of 
Scripture 
wrested 
to 
their 
purpose, 
to 
condemn 
and 
censure 
this 
my 
Hypothesis, 
I 
value 
them 
not, 
but 
shall 
slight 
their 
inconsiderate 
Judgement. 
For 
it 
is 
not 
unknown, 
that 
Lactantius 
(otherwise 
a 
Famous 
Author, 
though 
mean 
Mathematician) 
writeth 
very 
childishly 
touching 
the 
Form 
of 
the 
Earth, 
when 
he 
scoffs 
at 
those 
who 
affirm 
the 
Earth 
to 
be 
in 
Form 
of 
a 
Globe. 
So 
that 
it 
ought 
not 
to 
seem 
strange 
to 
the 
Ingenious, 
if 
any 
such 
should 
likewise 
now 
deride 
us. 
The 
Mathematicks 
are 
written 
for 
Mathematitians, 
to 
whom 
(if 
I 
deceive 
not 
my 
self) 
these 
Labours 
of 
mine 
shall 
seem 
to 
add 
something, 
as 
also 
to 
the 
Common-weale 
of 
the 
Church,whoseGovernmentisnowinthehandsofYourHoliness. 



And 
of 
this 
kinde 
do 
these 
appear 
to 
be 
who 
indeavour 
to 
perswade 
that 
Copernicus 
may 
be 
condemned 
before 
his 
Book 
is 
read; 
and 
to 
make 
the 
World 
believe 
that 
it 
is 
not 
onely 
lawfull 
but 
commendable 
so 
to 
do, 
produce 
certain 
Authorities 
of 
the 
Scripture, 
of 
Divines, 
and 
of 
Councils; 
which 
as 
they 
are 
by 
me 
had 
in 
reverence, 
and 
held 
of 
Supream 
Authority, 
insomuch 
that 
I 
should 
esteem 
it 
high 
temerity 
for 
any 
one 
to 
contradict 
them 
whilst 
they 
are 
used 
according 
to 
the 
In 
stitutes 
of 
Holy 
Church, 
so 
I 
believe 
that 
it 
is 
no 
errour 
to 
speak, 
so 
long 
as 
one 
hath 
reason 
to 
suspect 
that 
a 
person 
hath 
a 
desire, 
for 
some 
concern 
of 
his 
own, 
to 
produce 
and 
alledge 
them, 
to 
purposes 
different 
from 
those 
that 
are 
in 
the 
most 
Sacred 
intention 
of 
The 
Holy 
Church. 
Therefore 
I 
not 
onely 
protest 
(and 
my 
sincerity 
shall 
manifest 
it 
self) 
that 
I 
intend 
to 
submit 
my 
self 
freely 
to 
renounce 
those 
errors, 
into 
which, 
through 
ignorance▪ 
I 
may 
run 
in 
this 
Discourse 
of 
matters 
pertaining 
to 
Religion; 
but 
I 
farther 
declare, 
that 
I 
desire 
not 
in 
these 
matters 
to 
engage 
dispute 
with 
any 
one, 
although 
it 
should 
be 
in 
points 
that 
are 
disputable: 
for 
my 
end 
tendeth 
onely 
to 
this, 
That 
if 
in 
these 
considerations, 
besides 
my 
own 
profession, 
amongst 
the 
errours 
that 
may 
be 
in 
them, 
there 
be 
any 
thing 
apt 
to 
give 
others 
an 
hint 
of 
some 
Notion 
beneficial 
to 
the 
Holy 
Church, 
touching 
thedetermining 
aboutthe 
Copernican 
Systeme, 
it 
may 
be 
takenand 
improved 
as 
shall 
seem 
best 
to 
my 
Superiours: 
If 
not, 
let 
my 
Book 
be 
torn 
and 
burnt; 
for 
that 
I 
do 
neither 
intend, 
nor 
pretend 
to 
gain 
to 
my 
self 
any 
fruit 
from 
my 
writings, 
that 
is 
not 
Pious 
and 
Catholick. 
And 
moreover, 
although 
that 
many 
of 
the 
things 
that 
I 
observe 
have 
been 
spoken 
in 
my 
own 
hearing, 
yet 
I 
shall 
freely 
admit 
and 
grant 
to 
those 
that 
spake 
them, 
that 
they 
never 
said 
them, 
if 
so 
they 
please, 
but 
confess 
that 
I 
might 
have 
been 
mistaken: 
And 
therefore 
what 
I 
say, 
let 
it 
be 
supposed 
to 
be 
spoken 
not 
by 
them, 
but 
by 
those 
which 
wereofthisopinion. 


The 
motive 
therefore 
that 
they 
produce 
to 
condemn 
the 
Opinion 
of 
the 
Mobility 
of 
the 
Earth, 
and 
Stability 
of 
the 
Sun, 
is, 
that 
reading 
in 
the 
Sacred 
Leaves, 
in 
many 
places, 
that 
the 
Sun 
moveth, 
that 
the 
Earth 
standeth 
still; 
and 
the 
Scripture 
not 
being 
capable 
of 
lying, 
or 
erring, 
it 
followeth 
upon 
necessary 
consequence, 
that 
the 
Position 
of 
those 
is 
Erronious 
and 
Heretical, 
whomaintainthattheSunofitself 
isimmoveable,andtheEarth 
moveable. 


Touching 
this 
Reason 
I 
think 
it 
fit 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
to 
consider, 
That 
it 
is 
both 
piously 
spoken, 
and 
prudently 
affirmed, 
That 
the 
Sacred 
Scripture 
can 
never 
lye, 
when 
ever 
its 
true 
meaning 
is 
understood: 
Which 
I 
believe 
none 
will 
deny 
to 
be 
many 
times 
very 
abstruce, 
and 
very 
different 
from 
that 
which 



the 
bare 
sound 
of 
the 
words 
signifieth. 
Whence 
it 
cometh 
to 
pass, 
that 
if 
ever 
any 
one 
should 
constantly 
confine 
himself 
to 
the 
naked 
Grammatical 
Sence, 
he 
might, 
erring 
himself, 
make 
not 
only 
Contradictions 
and 
Propositions 
remote 
from 
Truth 
to 
appear 
in 
the 
Scriptures, 
but 
also 
gross 
Heresies 
and 
Blasphemies: 
For 
that 
we 
should 
be 
forced 
to 
assign 
to 
God 
feet, 
and 
hands, 
and 
eyes, 
yea 
more 
corporal 
and 
humane 
affections, 
as 
of 
Anger, 
of 
Repentance, 
of 
Hatred, 
nay, 
and 
sometimes 
the 
Forgetting 
of 
things 
past, 
and 
Ignorance 
of 
those 
to 
come: 
Which 
Propositions, 
like 
as 
(so 
the 
Holy 
Ghost 
affirmeth) 
theywereinthatmannerpronouncedbytheSacred 
Scriptures, 
that 
they 
might 
be 
accommodated 
to 
the 
Capacity 
of 
the 
Vulgar, 
who 
are 
very 
rude 
and 
unlearned; 
so 
likewise, 
for 
the 
sakes 
of 
those 
that 
deserve 
to 
be 
distinguished 
from 
the 
Vulgar, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
grave 
and 
skilful 
Expositors 
produce 
the 
true 
senses 
of 
them, 
and 
shew 
the 
particular 
Reasons 
why 
they 
are 
dictated 
under 
such 
and 
such 
words. 
And 
this 
is 
a 
Doctrine 
so 
true 
and 
common 
amongst 
Divines, 
that 
it 
would 
be 
superfluous 
to 
produce 
any 
attestationthereof. 


Hence 
me 
thinks 
I 
may 
with 
much 
more 
reason 
conclude, 
that 
the 
same 
holy 
Writ, 
when 
ever 
it 
hath 
had 
occasion 
to 
pronounce 
any 
natural 
Conclusion, 
and 
especially, 
any 
of 
those 
which 
are 
more 
abstruce, 
and 
difficult 
to 
beunderstood, 
hath 
not 
failed 
to 
observethisRule,thatso 
itmight 
not 
cause 
confusion 
in 
the 
mindes 
of 
those 
very 
people, 
and 
render 
them 
the 
more 
contumacious 
against 
the 
Doctrines 
that 
were 
more 
sublimely 
mysterious: 
For 
(like 
as 
we 
have 
said, 
and 
as 
it 
plainly 
appeareth) 
out 
of 
the 
sole 
respect 
of 
condescending 
to 
Popular 
Capacity, 
the 
Scripture 
hath 
not 
scrupled 
to 
shadow 
over 
most 
principal 
and 
fundamental 
Truths, 
attributing, 
even 
to 
God 
himself, 
qualities 
extreamly 
remote 
from, 
and 
contrary 
unto 
his 
Essence. 
Who 
would 
positively 
affirm 
that 
the 
Scripture, 
laying 
aside 
that 
respect, 
in 
speaking 
but 
occasionally 
of 
the 
Earth, 
of 
the 
Water, 
of 
the 
Sun, 
or 
of 
any 
other 
Creature, 
hath 
chosen 
to 
confine 
it 
self, 
with 
all 
rigour, 
within 
the 
bare 
and 
narrow 
literal 
sense 
of 
the 
words? 
And 
especially, 
in 
mentioning 
of 
those 
Creatures, 
things 
not 
at 
all 
concerning 
the 
primary 
Institution 
of 
the 
same 
Sacred 
Volume, 
to 
wit, 
the 
Service 
of 
God, 
and 
the 
salvation 
of 
Souls, 
and 
inthingsinfinitelybeyondtheapprehension 
oftheVulgar? 


This 
therefore 
being 
granted, 
methinks 
that 
in 
the 
Discussion 
of 
Natural 
Problemes, 
we 
ought 
not 
to 
begin 
at 
the 
authority 
of 
places 
of 
Scripture; 
but 
at 
Sensible 
Experiments 
and 
Necessary 
Demonstrations: 
For, 
from 
the 
Divine 
Word,the 
Sacred 
Scripture 
andNature 
didbothalike 
proceed; 
the 
first,as 
the 



Holy 
Ghosts 
Inspiration; 
the 
second, 
as 
the 
most 
observant 
Executrix 
of 
Gods 
Commands: 
And 
moreover 
it 
being 
convenient 
in 
the 
Scriptures 
(by 
way 
of 
condescension 
to 
the 
understanding 
of 
all 
men) 
to 
speak 
many 
things 
different, 
inappearance;and 
sofarasconcernesthenaked 
significationofthe 
words, 
from 
absolute 
truth: 
But 
on 
the 
contrary, 
Nature 
being 
inexorable 
and 
immutable, 
and 
never 
passing 
the 
bounds 
of 
the 
Laws 
assigned 
her, 
as 
one 
that 
nothing 
careth 
whether 
herabstruse 
reasons 
and 
methods 
of 
operatingbe, 
or 
be 
not 
exposed 
to 
the 
Capacity 
of 
Men; 
I 
conceive 
that 
that, 
concerning 
Natural 
Effects, 
which 
either 
Sensible 
Experience 
sets 
before 
our 
eyes, 
or 
Necessary 
Demonstrations 
do 
prove 
unto 
us, 
ought 
not, 
upon 
any 
account, 
to 
becalledintoquestion,much 
lesscondemneduponthetestimonyofTextsof 
Scripture, 
which 
may, 
under 
their 
words, 
couch 
Senses 
seemingly 
contrary 
thereto; 
In 
regard 
that 
every 
Expression 
of 
Scripture 
is 
not 
tied 
to 
so 
strict 
conditions, 
as 
every 
Effect 
of 
Nature: 
Nor 
doth 
God 
less 
admirably 
discover 
himself 
unto 
us 
in 
Nature’s 
Actions, 
than 
in 
the 
Scriptures 
Sacred 
Dictions. 
Which 
peradventure 
Tertullian 
intended 
to 
express 
in 
those 
words:Not 
definimus, 
Deum, 
primò 
N 
[...] 
tura 
cognoscendum; 
Deinde, 
Doctrina 
recognescendum: 
Natura 
ex 
operibus; 
Doctrina 
ex 
p 
[...]aedicationibus. 
We 
conclude, 
God 
is 
known; 
first, 
by 
Nature, 
and 
then 
again 
more 
particularly 
known 
by 
Doctrine: 
by 
Nature, 
in 
his 
Works; 
by 
Doctrine, 
in 
his 
Word 
preached. 


But 
I 
will 
not 
hence 
affirm, 
but 
that 
we 
ought 
to 
have 
an 
extraordinary 
esteem 
for 
the 
Places 
of 
Sacred 
Scripture, 
nay,

certainty

Conclusions,Tertul.

ca. 
we 
ought 
to 
make 
use 
of 
them, 
as 
most 
apposite 
helps 
to 
the 
true 
Exposition 
of 
the 
same 
Scriptures, 
and 
to 
the 
investigation 
of 
those 
Senses 
which 
are 
necessarily 
conteined 
in 
them, 
as 
most 
true, 
and 
concordant 
with 
the 
Truths 
demonstrated. 


This 
maketh 
me 
to 
suppose, 
that 
the 
Authority 
of 
the 
Sacred 
Volumes 
was 
intended 
principally 
to 
perswade 
men 
to 
the 
belief 
of 
those 
Articles 
and 
Propositions, 
which, 
by 
reason 
they 
surpass 
all 
humane 
discourse, 
could 
not 
by 
any 
other 
Science, 
or 
by 
any 
other 
means 
be 
made 
credible, 
than 
by 
the 
Mouth 
of 
the 
Holy 
Spirit 
it 
self. 
Besides 
that, 
even 
in 
those 
Propositions, 
which 
are 
not 
de 
Fide, 
the 
Authority 
of 
the 
same 
Sacred 
Leaves 
ought 
to 
be 
preferred 
to 
the 
Authority 
of 
all 
Humane 
Sciences 
that 
are 
not 
written 
in 
a 
Demonstrative 
Method, 
but 
either 
with 
bare 
Narrations, 
or 
else 
with 
probable 
Reasons; 
and 
this 
I 
hold 
to 
be 
so 
far 
convenient 
and 
necessary, 
by 
how 
far 
the 



said 
Divine 
Wisdome 
surpasseth 
all 
humane 
Judgment 
and 
Conjecture. 
But 
that 
that 
self 
same 
God 
who 
hath 
indued 
us 
with 
Senses, 
Discourse, 
and 
Understanding 
hath 
intended, 
laying 
aside 
the 
use 
of 
these, 
to 
give 
the 
knowledg 
of 
those 
things 
by 
other 
means, 
which 
we 
may 
attain 
by 
these, 
so 
as 
that 
even 
in 
those 
Natural 
Conclusions, 
which 
either 
by 
Sensible 
Experiments 
or 
Necessary 
Demonstrations 
are 
set 
before 
our 
eyes, 
or 
our 
Understanding, 
we 
ought 
to 
deny 
Sense 
and 
Reason, 
I 
do 
not 
conceive 
that 
I 
am 
bound 
to 
believe 
it; 
and 
especially 
in 
those 
Sciences, 
of 
which 
but 
a 
small 
part, 
and 
that 
divided 
into 
Conclusions 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
Scripture: 
Such 
as, 
for 
instance, 
is 
that 
of 
Astronomy, 
of 
which 
there 
is 
so 
small 
a 
part 
in 
Holy 
Writ, 
that 
it 
doth 
not 
so 
much 
as 
name 
any 
of 
the 
Planets, 
except 
the 
Sun 
andthe 
Moon, 
andonce 
or 
twice 
onelyVenusunder 
the 
nameof 
Lucifer. 
For 
if 
the 
Holy 
Writers 
had 
had 
any 
intention 
to 
perswade 
People 
to 
believe 
the 
Dispositions 
and 
Motions 
of 
the 
Coelestial 
Bodies; 
and 
that 
consequently 
we 
are 
still 
to 
derive 
that 
knowledge 
from 
the 
Sacred 
Books 
they 
would 
not, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
have 
spoken 
so 
little 
thereof, 
that 
it 
is 
as 
much 
as 
nothing, 
in 
comparison 
of 
the 
infinite 
admirable 
Conclusions, 
which 
in 
that 
Science 
are 
comprized 
and 
demonstrated. 
Nay, 
that 
the 
Authours 
of 
the 
Holy 
Volumes 
did 
not 
only 
not 
pretend 
to 
teach 
us 
the 
Constitutions 
and 
Motions 
of 
the 
Heavens 
and 
Stars, 
their 
Figures, 
Magnitudes, 
and 
Distances, 
but 
that 
intentionally 
(albeit 
that 
all 
these 
things 
were 
very 
well 
known 
unto 
them) 
they 
forbore 
to 
speak 
of 
them, 
is 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
Most 
Holy 
& 
Most 
Learned 
Fathers: 
and 
in 
S. 
Augustine 
we 
read 
the 
following 
words. 
Quaeri 
etiam 
solet, 
quae 
forma 
& 
figura 
Caeli 
credenda 
sit 
secundum 
Scripturas 
nostras: 
Multi 
enim 
multum 
disputant 
de 
iis 
ribus, 
quas 
majori 
prudentia 
nostri 
Autores 
omiserunt, 
ad 
beatam

non 
profuturas 
discentibus, 
& 
occupaentes 
(quod 
prius 
est)

prolixa 
[...], 
&

salubribus

Quid 
enim 
ad

pertinet, 
utrum 
Caelum, 
sicut 
Sphaera,

Terram, 
in

libratam; 
an 
eam 
ex 
una 
parte 
desuper, 
velut 
discus, 
operiat? 
Sed 
quia 
[...] 
de 
Fide 
agitur 
Scripturarum, 
propter 
illam 
causam, 
quam 
non 
semel 
commemoravimus, 
Ne 
scilicet 
quisquam

divina 
non 
intelligens, 
cum 
de 
his

tale 
aliquid 
vel 
invenerit 
in

Nostris, 
vel 
ex 
illis 
audiverit, 
quod 
perceptis

Breviter 
discendum 
est, 
de

hoc 
scisse 
Autores 
nostros, 
quod 
veritas 
habet: 
Sed

Idem

legitur 
apud

Magistrum 
Sententiarum. 
It 
is 
likewise 
commonly 
asked, 
of 
what 
Form 
and 
Figure 
we 
may 
believe 
Heaven 
to 
be, 
according 
to 
the 
Scriptures: 
For 
many 
contend 
much 
about 
those 
matters, 
which 
the 
greater 
prudence 
of 
our 
Authors 
hath 
forborn 
to 
speakof,as 
nothing 
furthering 
their 
Learnersinrelation 
to 
a 
blessedlife;and, 
(which 
is 
the 
chiefest 
thing) 
taking 
up 
much 
of 
that 
time 
which 
should 
be 
spent 
in 
holy 
exercises. 
For 
what 
is 
it 
to 
me 
whether 
Heaven, 
as 
a 
Sphere, 
doth 
on 
all 
sides 
environ 
the 
Earth, 
a 
Mass 
ballanced 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
World; 
or 
whether 
like 
a 
Dish 
it 
doth 
onely 
cover 
or 
overcast 
the 
same? 
But 
because 
belief 
of 
Scripture 
is 
urged 
for 
that 
cause, 
which 
we 
have 
oft 
mentioned, 
that 
is, 
That 
none 
through 
ignorance 
of 
Divine 
Phrases, 
when 
they 
shall 
find 
any 
thing 
of 
this 
nature 
in, 
or 
hear 
any 
thing 
cited 
out 
of 
our 
Bibles 
which 
may 
seem 
to 
oppose 
manifest 
Conclusions, 
should 
be 
induced 
to 
suspect 
their 
truth, 
when 
they 
admonish, 
relate, 
& 
deliver 
more 
profitable 
matters 
Briefly 
be 
it 
spoken, 
touching 
the 
Figure 
of 
Heaven, 
that 
our 
Authors 
knew 
the 
truth: 
But 
the 
H. 
Spirit 
would 
not, 
that 
men 
should 
learn 
what 
is 
profitabletonone 
forsalvation. 


And 
the 
same 
intentional 
silence 
of 
these 
sacred 
Penmen 
in 
determining 
what 
is 
to 
be 
believed 
of 
these 
accidents 
of 
the 
Celestial 
Bodies, 
is 
again 
hinted 
to 
us 
by 
the 
same 
Father 
in 
the 
ensuing 
10. 
Chapter 
upon 
the 
Question, 
Whether 
we 
are 
to 
believe 
that 
Heaven 
moveth, 
or 
standeth 
still, 
in 
these 
words: 
De 
Moit 
[...] 
etiam 
Caeli, 
nonnulli 
fra 
[...]tres 
quaestionem 
movent, 
utrum 
stet, 
an 
moveatur; 
quia 
[...] 
si 
[...] 
vetur, 
inquiunt, 
quomodo 
Firmamentum 
est? 
Si 
autem 
stat, 
quomodo 
Sydera 
quae 
in 
ipso 
fixa 
creduntur, 
ab 
Oriente 
in 
Occidentem 
circu¯ 
eunt,, 
Septentrionalibus 
breviores 
gyros 
juxta 
cardinem 
peragentibus; 
ut 
Caelum, 
si 
est 
alius 
nobis 
occulius 
cardo, 
ex 
alio 
vertice, 
sicut 
Sphaera; 
si 
autem 
nullus 
alius 
cardo 
est, 
vel 
uti 
discus 
rotari 
videatur? 
Quibus 
respondeo, 
Multum 
subtilibus 
& 
laboriosis 
rationibus 
ista 
perquiri, 
ut 
vere 
percipiaetur, 
utrum 
ita, 
an 
non 
ita 
sit, 
quibus 
ineundis 
atque 
tractandis 
nec 
mihi 
jam 
tempus 
est, 
nec 
illis 
esse 
debet, 
quos 
ad 
salutem 
suam, 
è 
Sanctae 
Ecclesiae 
necessaria 
utilitate 
cupimus 
informari: 
There 
are 
some 
of 
the 
Brethren 
that 
start 
a 
question 
concerning 
the 
motion 
of 
Heaven, 
Whether 
it 
be 
fixed, 
or 
moved: 
For 
if 
it 
be 
moved 
(say 
they) 
how 
is 
it 
a 
Firmament? 
If 
it 
stand 
still, 
how 
do 
these 
Stars 
which 
are 
held 
to 
be 
fixed 
go 
round 
from 
East 
to 
West, 
the 
more 
Northern 
performing 
shorter 
Circuits 
near 
the 
Pole; 
so 
that 
Heaven, 
if 
there 
be 
another 
Pole, 
to 
us 
unknown, 
may 



seem 
to 
revolve 
upon 
some 
other 
Axis; 
but 
if 
there 
be 
not 
another 
Pole, 
it 
may 
be 
thought 
to 
move 
as 
a 
Discus? 
To 
whom 
I 
reply, 
that 
these 
points 
require 
many 
subtil 
and 
profound 
Reasons, 
for 
the 
making 
out 
whether 
they 
be 
really 
so, 
or 
no; 
the 
undertakeing 
and 
discussing 
of 
which 
is 
neither 
consistent 
with 
my 
leasure, 
nor 
their 
duty, 
vvhom 
I 
desire 
to 
instruct 
in 
the 
necessary 
matters 
more 
directly 
conducing 
to 
their 
salvation, 
and 
to 
the 
benefitofTheHolyChurch. 


Fromwhich 
(thatwe 
maycomenearerto 
our 
particularcase)itnecessarily 
followeth, 
that 
the 
Holy 
Ghost 
not 
having 
intended 
to 
teach 
us, 
whether 
Heaven 
moveth 
or 
standeth 
still; 
nor 
whether 
its 
Figure 
be 
in 
Form 
of 
a 
Sphere, 
or 
of 
a 
Discus, 
or 
distended 
in 
Planum: 
Nor 
whether 
the 
Earth 
be 
contained 
in 
the 
Centre 
of 
it, 
or 
on 
one 
side; 
he 
hath 
much 
less 
had 
an 
intention 
to 
assure 
us 
of 
other 
Conclusions 
of 
the 
same 
kinde, 
and 
in 
such 
a 
manner, 
connected 
to 
these 
already 
named, 
that 
without 
the 
dedermination 
of 
them, 
one 
can 
neither 
affirm 
one 
or 
the 
other 
part; 
which 
are, 
The 
determining 
of 
the 
Motion 
and 
Rest 
of 
the 
said 
Earth, 
and 
of 
the 
Sun. 
And 
if 
the 
same 
Holy 
Spirit 
hath 
purposely 
pretermitted 
to 
teach 
us 
those 
Propositions, 
as 
nothing 
concerning 
his 
intention, 
that 
is, 
our 
salvation; 
how 
can 
it 
be 
affirmed, 
that 
the 
holdingofonepartratherthan 
theother, 
should 
be 
so 
necessary, 
as 
that 
it 
is 
de 
Fide, 
and 
the 
other 
erronious? 
Can 
an 
Opinion 
be 
Heretical, 
and 
yet 
nothing 
concerning 
the 
salvation 
of 
souls? 
Or 
can 
it 
be 
said 
that 
the 
Holy 
Ghost 
purposed 
not 
to 
teach 
us 
a 
thing 
that 
concerned 
our 
salvation? 
I 
might 
here 
insert 
the 
Opinion 
of

let

ought 
to 
be 
esteemed 
in

of

have 
accounted 
them, 
from 
whom 
amongst 
an 
hundred 
other 
attestations, 
we 
have 
these 
that 
follow:

We 
must 
also 
carefully 
heed 
and 
altogether 
avoid 
in 
handling 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
Moses, 
to 
avouch 
or 
speak 
any 
thing 
affirmatively 
and 
confidently 
which 
contradicteth 
the 
manifest 
Experiments 
and 
Reasons 
of 
Philosophy, 
or 
other 
Sciences. 
For 
since 
all 
Truth 
is 
agreeable 
to 
Truth, 
the 
Truth 
of 
Holy 
Writ 
cannot 
be 
contrary 
to 
the 
solid 
Reasons 
and 
Experiments 
ofHumaneLearning. 


And 
in 
St. 
Augustine 
we 
read: 
Si 
manifestae 
certaeque 
Rationi, 
velut 
sanctarum 
Litterarum 
objicitur 
autoriritas, 
non 
intelligit, 
qui 
hoc 
facit; 
& 
non 
Scriptura 
sensum 
(ad 
quem 
penetrare 
non 
potuit) 
sed 
suum 
potius 
objicit 
veritati: 
nec 
[...]d 
quod 
in 
ea, 
sed 
quod 
in 
seipso 
velut 
pro 
ea 
invenit, 
opponit. 
If 
any 
one 
shall 
object 
the 
Authority 
of 
Sacred 
Writ, 
against 
clear 
and 
manifest 
Reason, 
he 
that 
doth 
so, 
knows 
not 
what 
he 
undertakes: 
For 
he 
objects 
against 
the 
Truth, 
not 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
Scripture 
(which 
is 
beyond 
his 
comprehension) 
but 
rather 
his 
own; 
not 
what 
is 
in 
it, 
but 
what, 
finding 
it 
in 
himself,hefancyedto 
beinit. 


This 
granted, 
and 
it 
being 
true, 
(as 
hath 
been 
said) 
that 
two 
Truths 
cannot 
be 
contrary 
to 
each 
other, 
it 
is 
the 
office 
of 
a 
Judicious 
Expositor 
to 
study 
to 
finde 
the 
true 
Senses 
of 
Sacred 
Texts, 
which 
undoubtedly 
shall 
accord 
with 
those 
Natural 
Conclusions, 
of 
which 
manifest 
Sense 
and 
Necessary 
Demonstrations 
had 
before 
made 
us 
sure 
and 
certain.Epist.

ad 
Marcellinum. 
Yea, 
in 
regard 
that 
the 
Scriptures 
(as 
hath 
been 
said) 
for 
the 
Reasons 
alledged,admit 
in 
many 
places 
Expositions 
farfrom 
theSense 
ofthe 
words; 
and 
moreover, 
we 
not 
being 
able 
to 
affirm, 
that 
all 
Interpreters 
speak 
by 
Divine 
Inspiration; 
For 
(if 
it 
were 
so) 
then 
there 
would 
be 
no 
difference 
between 
them 
about 
the 
Senses 
of 
the 
same 
places; 
I 
should 
think 
that 
it 
would 
be 
an 
act 
of 
great 
prudence 
to 
make 
it 
unlawful 
for 
any 
one 
to 
usurp 
Texts 
of 
Scripture, 
and 
as 
it 
were 
to 
force 
them 
to 
maintain 
this 
or 
that 
Naturall 
Conclusion 
for 
truth, 
of 
which 
Sence, 
& 
Demonstrative, 
and 
necessaryReasons 
mayone 
timeorother 
assure 
us 
the 
contrary. 
For 
who 
will 
prescribe 
bounds 
to 
the 
Wits 
of 
men? 
Who 
will 
assert 
that 
all 
that 
is 
sensible 
and 
knowable 
in 
the 
World 
is 
already 
discovered 
and 
known? 
Will 
not 
they 
that 
in 
other 
points 
disagree 
with 
us, 
confess 
this 
(and 
it 
is 
a 
great 
truth) 
that 
Eaquae 
scimus, 
sint 
minima 
pars 
corum 
quae 
ignoramus? 
That 
those 
Truths 
which 
we 
know, 
are 
very 
few, 
in 
comparison 
of 
those 
which 
we 
know 
not? 
Nay 
more,Ecclesiast.

if 
we 
have 
it 
from

One 
ought 
not, 
as 
I 
conceive, 
to 
stop 
the 



way 
to 
free 
Philosophating, 
touching 
the 
things 
of 
the 
World, 
and 
of 
Nature, 
as 
if 
that 
they 
were 
already 
certainly 
found, 
and 
all 
manifest: 
nor 
ought 
it 
to 
be 
counted 
rashness, 
if 
one 
do 
not 
sit 
down 
satisfied 
with 
the 
opinions 
now 
become 
as 
it 
were 
commune; 
nor 
ought 
any 
persons 
to 
be 
displeased, 
if 
others 
do 
not 
hold, 
in 
natural 
Disputes 
to 
that 
opinion 
which 
best 
pleaseth 
them; 
and 
especially 
touching 
Problems 
that 
have, 
for 
thousands 
of 
years, 
been 
controverted 
amongst 
the 
greatest 
Philosophers, 
as 
is 
the 
Stability 
of 
the 
Sun, 
and 
Mobility 
of 
the 
Earth, 
an 
opinion 
held 
by 
Pythagoras, 
and 
by 
his 
whole 
Sect; 
by 
Heraclides 
Ponticus, 
who 
was 
of 
the 
same 
opininion; 
by 
Phylolaus, 
theMaster 
of 
Plato; 
and 
by 
Plato 
himself,as 
Aristotle 
relateth, 
and 
of 
which 
Plutarch 
writeth 
in 
the 
life 
of 
Numa, 
that 
the 
said 
Plato, 
when 
he 
was 
grown 
old, 
said, 
It 
is 
a 
most 
absurd 
thing 
to 
think 
otherwise: 
The 
same 
was 
believed 
by 
Aristarchus 
Samius, 
as 
we 
have 
it 
in 
Archimedes; 
and 
probably 
by 
Archimedes 
himself; 
by 
Nicetas 
the 
Philosopher, 
upon 
the 
testimony 
of 
Scicero, 
and 
by 
many 
others. 
And 
this 
opinion 
hath, 
finally, 
been 
amplified, 
and 
with 
many 
Observations 
and 
Demonstrations 
confirmed 
by 
Nicholaus 
Copernicus. 
And 
Seneca, 
a 
most 
eminent 
Philosopher, 
in 
his 
Book 
De 
Cometis, 
advertizeth 
us 
that 
we 
ought, 
with 
great 
diligence, 
seek 
for 
an 
assured 
knowledge, 
whether 
it 
be 
Heaven, 
or 
the 
Earth, 
in 
which 
the 
DiurnalConversionresides. 


And 
for 
this 
cause, 
it 
would 
probably 
be 
prudent 
and 
profitable 
counsel, 
if 
besides 
the 
Articles 
which 
concern 
our 
Salvation, 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
our 
Faith 
(against 
the 
stability 
of 
which 
there 
is 
no 
fear 
that 
any 
valid 
and 
solid 
Doctrine 
can 
ever 
rise 
up) 
men 
would 
not 
aggregate 
and 
heap 
up 
more, 
without 
necessity: 
And 
if 
it 
be 
so, 
it 
would 
certainly 
be 
a 
preposterous 
thing 
to 
introduce 
such 
Articles 
at 
the 
request 
of 
persons 
who, 
besides 
that 
we 
know 
not 
that 
they 
speak 
by 
inspiration 
of 
Divine 
Grace, 
we 
plainly 
see 
that 
there 
might 
be 
wished 
in 
them 
the 
understanding 
which 
would 
be 
necessary 
first 
to 
enable 
them 
to 
comprehend, 
and 
then 
to 
discuss 
the 
Demonstrations 
wherewith 
the 
subtiler 
Sciences 
proceed 
in 
confirming 
such 
like 
Conclusions. 
Nay, 
more 
I 
should 
say, 
(were 
it 
lawful 
to 
speak 
my 
judgment 
freely 
on 
this 
Argument) 
that 
it 
would 
haply 
more 
suit 
with 
the 
Decorum 
and 
Majesty 
of 
those 
Sacred 
Volumes, 
if 
care 
were 
taken 
that 
every 
shallow 
and 
vulgar 
Writer 
might 
not 
authorize 
his 
Books 
(which 
are 
not 
seldome 
grounded 
upon 
foolish 
fancies) 
by 
inserting 
into 
them 
Places 
of 
Holy 
Scripture, 
interpreted, 
or 
rather 
distorted 
to 
Senses 
as 
remote 
from 
the 
right 
meaning 
of 
the 
said 
Scripture, 
as 
they 
are 
neer 
to 
derirision, 
who 
not 
without 
ostentation 
flourish 



out 
their 
Writings 
therewith. 
Examples 
of 
such 
like 
abuses 
there 
might 
many 
be 
produced, 
but 
for 
this 
time 
I 
will 
confine 
my 
self 
to 
two, 
not 
much 
besides 
these 
matters 
of 
Astronomy: 
One 
of 
which, 
is 
that 
of 
those 
Pamphlets 
which 
were 
published 
against 
the 
Medicean 
Planets, 
of 
which 
I 
had 
the 
fortune 
to 
make 
the 
discovery; 
against 
the 
existence 
of 
which 
there 
were 
brought 
many 
placesofSacredScripture:Now,thatalltheWorldseeththemto 
bePlanets,I 
would 
gladly 
hear 
with 
what 
new 
interpretations 
those 
very 
Antagonists 
do 
expound 
the 
Scripture, 
and 
excuse 
their 
own 
simplicity. 
The 
other 
example 
is 
of 
him 
who 
but 
very 
lately 
hath 
Printed 
against 
Astronomers 
and 
Philosophers, 
that 
the 
Moon 
doth 
not 
receive 
its 
light 
from 
the 
Sun, 
but 
is 
of 
its 
own 
nature 
resplendent: 
which 
imagination 
he 
in 
the 
close 
confirmeth, 
or, 
to 
say 
better, 
perswadeth 
himself 
that 
he 
confirmeth 
by 
sundry 
Texts 
of 
Scripture, 
which 
he 
thinks 
cannot 
be 
reconciled 
unlesse 
his 
opinion 
should 
be 
true 
and 
necessary. 
Neverthelesse, 
the 
Moon 
of 
it 
self 
is 
Tenebrose, 
and 
yet 
it 
isnolesse 
lucid 
thantheSplendorof 
theSun. 


Hence 
it 
is 
manifest, 
that 
these 
kinde 
of 
Authors, 
in 
regard 
they 
did 
not 
dive 
into 
the 
true 
Sence 
of 
the 
Scriptures, 
would 
(in 
case 
their 
authority 
were 
of 
any 
great 
moment) 
have 
imposed 
a 
necessity 
upon 
others 
to 
believe 
such 
Conclusions 
for 
true 
as 
were 
repugnant 
to 
manifest 
Reason, 
and 
to 
Sense. 
Which 
abuse 
Deus 
avertat, 
that 
it 
do 
not 
gain 
Countenance 
and 
Authority; 
for 
if 
it 
should, 
it 
would 
in 
a 
short 
time 
be 
necessary 
to 
proscribe 
and 
inhibit 
all 
the 
Contemplative 
Sciences. 
For 
being 
that 
by 
nature 
the 
number 
of 
such 
as 
are 
very 
unapt 
to 
understand 
perfectly 
both 
the 
Sacred 
Scriptures, 
and 
the 
other 
Sciences 
is 
much 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
the 
skilfull 
and 
intelligent; 
those 
of 
the 
first 
sort 
superficially 
running 
over 
the 
Scriptures, 
would 
arrogate 
to 
themselves 
an 
Authority 
of 
decreeing 
upon 
all 
the 
Questions 
in 
Nature, 
by 
vertue 
of 
some 
Word 
by 
them 
misunderstood, 
and 
produced 
by 
the 
Sacred 
Pen-men 
to 
another 
purpose: 
Nor 
would 
the 
small 
number 
of 
the 
Intelligent 
be 
able 
to 
repress 
the 
furious 
Torrent 
of 
those 
men, 
who 
would 
finde 
so 
many 
the 
more 
followers, 
in 
that 
the 
gaining 
the 
reputation 
of 
Wise 
men 
without 
pains 
or 
Study, 
is 
far 
more 
grateful 
to 
humane 
Nature, 
than 
the 
consuming 
our 
selves 
with 
restless 
contemplations 
about 
the 
most 
painfull 
Arts. 
Therefore 
we 
ought 
to 
return 
infinite 
thanks 
to 
Almighty 
God, 
who 
of 
his 
Goodness 
freeth 
us 
from 
this 
fear, 
in 
that 
he 
depriveth 
such 
kinde 
of 
persons 
of 
all 
Authority 
and, 
reposeth 
the 
Consulting, 
Resolving, 
and 
Decreeing 
upon 
so 
important 
Determinations 
in 
the 
extraordinary 
Wisdom 
and 
Candor 
of 
most 
Sacred 
Fathers; 
and 
in 
the 
Supream 
Authority 
of 
those, 
who 
being 



guided 
by 
his 
Holy 
Spirit, 
cannot 
but 
determin 
Holily: 
So 
ordering 
things, 
that 
of 
the 
levity 
of 
those 
other 
men, 
there 
is 
no 
account 
made. 
This 
kinde 
of 
men 
are 
those, 
as 
I 
believe, 
against 
whom, 
not 
without 
Reason, 
Grave, 
and 
Holy 
Writers 
do 
so 
much 
inveigh; 
and 
of 
whom

This 
(Scilicet 
the 
Sacred 
Scripture) 
the 
talking 
old 
woman, 
the 
doting 
old 
man, 
the 
talkative 
Sophister, 
all 
venture 
upon, 
lacerate, 
teach, 
and 
that 
before 
they 
have 
learnt 
it. 
Others 
induced 
by 
Pride, 
diving 
into 
hard 
words, 
Philosophate 
amongst 
Women, 
touching 
the 
Holy 
Scriptures. 
Others 
(Oh 
shameful!) 
Learn 
of 
Women 
what 
they 
teach 
to 
Men; 
and, 
as 
if 
this 
were 
nothing, 
in 
a 
certain 
facility 
of 
words, 
I 
may 
say 
of 
confidence, 
expound 
to 
others 
what 
they 
understand 
not 
themselves. 
I 
forbear 
to 
speak 
of 
those 
of 
my 
own 
Profession, 
who, 
if 
after 
Humane 
Learning 
they 
chance 
to 
attain 
to 
the 
Holy 
Scriptures, 
and 
tickle 
the 
ears 
of 
the 
people 
with 
affected 
and 
Studied 
expressions, 
they 
affirm 
that 
all 
they 
say, 
is 
to 
be 
entertained 
as 
the 
Law 
of 
God; 
and 
not 
stooping 
to 
learn 
what 
the 
Prophets 
and 
Apostles 
held, 
they 
force 
incongruous 
testimonies 
to 
their 
own 
Sense: 
As 
if 
it 
were 
the 
genuine, 
and 
not 
corrupt 
way 
of 
teaching 
to 
deprave 
Sentences, 
and 
Wrest 
the 
Scriptureaccordingto 
their 
ownsingularand 
contradictoryhumour. 
I 
will 
not 
rank 
among 
these 
same 
secular 
Writers 
any 
Theologists, 
whom 
I 
repute 
to 
be 
men 
of 
profound 
Learning, 
and 
sober 
Manners, 
and 
therefore 
hold 
them 
in 
great 
esteem 
and 
veneration: 
Yet 
I 
cannot 
deny 
but 
that 
I 
have 
a 
certain 
scruple 
in 
my 
mind, 
and 
consequently 
am 
desirous 
to 
have 
it 
removed, 
whilst 
I 
hear 
that 
they 
pretend 
to 
a 
power 
of 
constraining 
others 
by 
Authority 
of 
the 
Scriptures 
to 
follow 
that 
opinion 
in 
Natural 
Disputations, 
which 
they 
think 
most 
agreeth 
with 
the 
Texts 
of 
that: 
Holding 
withall, 
that 



they 
are 
not 
bound 
to 
answer 
the 
Reasons 
and 
Experiments 
on 
the 
contrary: 
In 
Explication 
and 
Confirmation 
of 
which 
their 
judgement 
they 
say, 
That 
Theologie 
being 
the 
Queen 
of 
all 
the 
Sciences, 
she 
ought 
not 
upon 
any 
account 
to 
stoop 
to 
accomodate 
her 
self 
to 
the 
Positions 
of 
the 
rest, 
less 
worthy, 
and 
inferior 
to 
her: 
But 
that 
they 
ought 
to 
refer 
themselves 
to 
her 
(as 
to 
their 
Supream 
Emperess) 
and 
change 
and 
alter 
their 
Conclusions, 
according 
to 
Theological 
Statutes 
and 
Decrees. 
And 
they 
further 
add, 
That 
if 
in 
the 
inferior 
Science 
there 
should 
be 
any 
Conclusion 
certain 
by 
vertue 
of 
Demonstrations 
or 
experiments, 
to 
which 
there 
is 
found 
in 
Scripture 
another 
Conclusion 
repugnant; 
the 
very 
Professors 
of 
that 
Science 
ought 
of 
themselves 
to 
resolve 
their 
Demonstrations, 
and 
discover 
the 
falacies 
of 
their 
own 
Experiments, 
without 
repairing 
to 
Theologers 
and 
Textuaries, 
it 
not 
suiting 
(as 
hath 
been 
said) 
with 
the 
dignity 
of 
Theologie 
to 
stoop 
to 
the 
investigation 
of 
the 
falacies 
of 
the 
inferior 
Sciences: 
But 
it 
sufficeth 
her, 
to 
determine 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
Conclusion 
with 
her 
absolute 
Authority, 
and 
by 
her 
infallibility. 
And 
then 
the 
Natural 
Conclusions 
in 
which 
they 
say 
that 
we 
ought 
to 
bide 
by 
the 
meer 
Authority 
of 
the 
Scripture, 
without 
glossing, 
or 
expounding 
it 
to 
Senses 
different 
from 
the 
Words, 
they 
affirm 
to 
be 
Those 
of 
which 
the 
Scripture 
speaketh 
alwaies 
in 
the 
same 
manner; 
and 
the 
Holy 
Fathersallreceive,andexpound 
tothesameSense. 


Now 
as 
to 
these 
Determinations, 
I 
have 
had 
occasion 
to 
consider 
some 
particulars 
(which 
I 
will 
purpose) 
for 
that 
I 
was 
made 
cautious 
thereof, 
by 
those 
who 
understand 
more 
than 
I 
in 
these 
businesses, 
and 
to 
whose 
judgements 
I 
alwaies 
submit 
my 
self. 
And 
first 
I 
could 
say, 
that 
there 
might 
possibly 
a 
certain 
kinde 
of 
equivocation 
interpose, 
in 
that 
they 
do 
not 
distinguish 
the 
preheminences 
whereby 
Sacred 
Theologie 
meriteth 
the 
Title 
of 
Queen. 
For 
it 
might 
be 
called 
so, 
either 
because 
that 
that 
which 
is 
taught 
by 
alltheother 
Sciences, 
is 
foundto 
be 
comprized 
and 
demonstrated 
in 
it, 
but 
with 
more 
excellent 
means, 
and 
with 
more 
sublime 
Learning; 
in 
like 
manner, 
as 
for 
example; 
The 
Rules 
of 
measuring 
of 
Land, 
& 
of 
Accountantship 
are 
much 
more 
excellently 
contained 
in 
the 
Arithmatick 
and 
Geometry 
of 
Euclid, 
than 
in 
the 
Practises 
of 
Surveyours 
and 
Accomptants: 
Or 
because 
the 
Subject 
about 
which 
Theologie 
is 
conversant, 
excelleth 
in 
Dignity 
all 
the 
other 
Subjects, 
that 
are 
the 
Matters 
of 
other 
Sciences: 
As 
also 
because 
its 
Documents 
are 
divulged 
by 
nobler 
waies. 
That 
the 
Title 
and 
Authority 
of 
Queen 
belongeth 
to 
Theologie 
in 
the 
first 
Sense, 
I 
think 
that 
no 
Theologers 
will 
affirm, 
that 
have 
but 
any 
in-sight 
into 
the 
other 
Sciences; 
of 
which 
there 



are 
none 
(as 
I 
believe) 
that 
will 
say 
that 
Geometry, 
Astronomy 
Musick, 
and 
Medicine 
are 
much 
more 
excellently 
and 
exactly 
contained 
in 
the 
Sacred 
Volumes, 
than 
in 
the 
Books 
of 
Archimedes, 
in 
Ptolomy, 
in 
Boetius, 
and 
in 
Galen. 
Therefore 
itis 
probablethatthe 
RegalPreheminenceisgiven 
herupon 
the 
second 
account, 
namely, 
By 
reason 
of 
the 
Subject, 
and 
the 
admirable 
communicating 
of 
the 
Divine 
Revelations 
in 
those 
Conclusions 
which 
by 
other 
means 
could 
not 
be 
conceived 
by 
men, 
and 
which 
chiefly 
concern 
the 
acquist 
of 
eternal 
Beatitude. 
Now 
if 
Theologie 
being 
conversant 
about 
the 
loftiest 
Divine 
Contemplation, 
and 
residing 
for 
Dignity 
in 
the 
Regal 
Throne 
of 
the 
Sciences, 
(whereby 
she 
becometh 
of 
highest 
Authority) 
descendeth 
not 
to 
the 
more 
mean 
and 
humble 
Speculations 
of 
the 
inferior 
Sciences: 
Nay; 
(as 
hath 
been 
declared 
above) 
hath 
no 
regard 
to 
them, 
as 
not 
concerning 
Beatitude; 
the 
Professors 
thereof 
ought 
not 
to 
arrogate 
to 
themselves 
the 
Authority 
to 
determin 
of 
Controversies 
in 
those 
Professions 
which 
have 
been 
neither 
practised 
nor 
studied 
by 
them. 
For 
this 
would 
be 
as 
if 
an 
Absolute 
Prince, 
knowing 
that 
he 
might 
freely 
command, 
and 
cause 
himself 
to 
be 
obeyed, 
should 
(being 
neither 
Phisitian 
nor 
Architect) 
undertake 
to 
administer 
Medicines, 
and 
erect 
Buildings 
after 
his 
own 
fashion, 
to 
the 
great 
endangering 
af 
the 
lives 
of 
the 
poor 
Patients, 
and 
to 
the 
manifest 
destruction 
oftheEdifices. 


Again, 
to 
command 
the 
very 
Professors 
of 
Astronomy, 
that 
they 
of 
themselves 
see 
to 
the 
confuting 
of 
their 
own 
Observations 
and 
Demonstrations, 
as 
those 
that 
can 
be 
no 
other 
but 
Falacies 
and 
Sophismes, 
is 
to 
enjoyn 
a 
thing 
beyond 
all 
possibility 
of 
doing: 
For 
it 
is 
not 
onely 
to 
command 
them 
that 
they 
do 
not 
see 
that 
which 
they 
see, 
and 
that 
they 
do 
not 
understand 
that 
which 
they 
understand; 
but 
that 
in 
seeking, 
they 
finde 
the 
contrary 
of 
that 
which 
they 
happen 
to 
meet 
with. 
Therefore 
before 
that 
this 
is 
to 
be 
done, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
that 
they 
were 
shewed 
the 
way 
how 
to 
make 
the 
Powers 
of 
the 
Soul 
to 
command 
one 
another, 
and 
the 
inferior 
the 
Superior; 
so 
that 
the 
imagination 
and 
will 
might, 
and 
should 
believe 
contrary 
to 
what 
the 
Intellect 
understands: 
I 
still 
mean 
in 
Propositions 
purely 
Natural, 
and 
whicharenotdeFide,and 
notintheSupernatural, 
whicharedeFide. 


I 
would 
entreat 
these 
Wise 
and 
Prudent 
Fathers, 
that 
they 
would 
withal 
diligence 
consider 
the 
difference 
that 
is 
between 
Opinable 
and 
Demonstrative 
Doctrines: 
To 
the 
end, 
that 
well 
weighing 
in 
their 
minds 
with 
what 
force 
Necessary 
Illations 
oblige, 
they 
might 
the 
better 
ascertain 
themselves, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
in 
the 
Power 
of 
the 
Professors 
of 
Demonstrative 
Sciences 
to 
change 



their 
Opinions 
at 
pleasure, 
and 
apply 
themselves 
one 
while 
to 
one 
side, 
and 
another 
while 
to 
another; 
and 
that 
there 
is 
a 
great 
difference 
between 
commanding 
a 
Methametitian 
or 
a 
Philosopher, 
and 
the 
disposing 
of 
a 
Lawyer 
or 
a 
Merchant; 
and 
that 
the 
demonstrated 
Conclusions 
touching 
the 
things 
of 
Nature 
and 
of 
the 
Heavens 
cannot 
be 
changed 
with 
the 
same 
facility, 
as 
the 
Opinions 
are 
touching 
what 
is 
lawful 
or 
not 
in 
a 
Contract, 
Bargain, 
or 
Bill 
of 
Exchange. 
This 
difference 
was 
well 
understood 
by 
the 
Learned 
and 
Holy 
Fathers, 
as 
their 
having 
been 
at 
great 
pains 
to 
confute 
many 
Arguments, 
or 
to 
say 
better, 
many 
Philosophical 
Fallacies, 
doth 
prove 
unto 
us; 
and 
as 
may 
expresly 
be 
read 
in 
some 
of 
them, 
and 
particularly 
we 
have 
in 
S. 
Augustine 
the 
following 
words:Hoc 
indubitanter 
tenendum 
est, 
ut 
quicquid 
Sapientes 
hujus 
Mundi, 
de 
Natura 
rerum 
veraciter 
demonstrare 
potuerint, 
ostendamus, 
nostris 
libris 
non 
esse 
contrarium: 
quicquid 
autem 
illi, 
in 
suis 
voluminibus, 
contrarium 
Sacris 
Litteris 
docent, 
sine 
ulla 
dubitatione 
credamus, 
id 
falsissimum 
esse, 
& 
quoquo 
modo 
possumus, 
etiam 
ostendamus; 
atque 
ita 
teneamus 
Fidem 
Domini 
nostri, 
in 
quasunt 
absconditi 
omnes 
thesauri 
Sapientiae, 
ut 
neque 
falsae 
Philosophiae 
loquacitate 
seducamur, 
neque 
simulata 
Religionis 
superstitione 
terreamur. 
This 
is 
to 
be 
held 
for 
an 
undoubted 
Truth, 
That 
we 
may 
be 
confident, 
that 
whatever 
the 
Sages 
of 
this 
World 
have 
demonstrated 
touching 
Natural 
Points, 
is 
no 
waies 
contrary 
to 
our 
Bibles: 
And 
in 
case 
they 
teach 
any 
thing 
in 
their 
Books 
that 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
Holy 
Scriptures, 
we 
may 
without 
any 
scruple 
conclude 
it 
to 
be 
most 
false; 
And 
according 
to 
our 
ability 
let 
us 
make 
the 
same 
appear: 
And 
let 
us 
so 
keep 
the 
Faith 
of 
our 
Lord, 
in 
whom 
are 
hidden 
all 
the 
Treasures 
of 
Wisdom; 
that 
we 
be 
neither 
seduced 
with 
the 
Loquacity 
of 
false 
Philosophy, 
norscaredbythesuperstition 
ofa 
counterfeitReligion. 


From 
which 
words, 
I 
conceive 
that 
I 
may 
collect 
this 
Doctrine, 
namely, 
That 
in 
the 
Books 
of 
the 
Wise 
of 
this 
World, 
there 
are 
contained 
some 
Natural 
truths 
that 
are 
solidly 
demonstrated, 
and 
others 
again 
that 
are 
barely 
taught; 
and 
that 
as 
to 
the 
first 
sort, 
it 
is 
the 
Office 
of 
wise 
Divines 
to 
shew 
that 
they 
are 
not 
contrary 
to 
the 
Sacred 
Scriptures; 
As 
to 
the 
rest, 
taught, 
but 
not 
necessarily 
demonstrated, 
if 
they 
shall 
contain 
any 
thing 
contrary 
to 
the 
Sacred 
Leaves, 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
held 
undoubtedly 
false, 
and 
such 
it 
ought 
by 
all 
possiblewaies 
tobedemonstrated. 


If 
therefore 
Natural 
Conclusions 
veritably 
demonstrated,Gen. 
as

lib 
I. 
Cap.25. 
are 
not 
to 
be 
postposed 
to 
the 
Places 
of 
Scripture, 
but 
that 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
shewn 
how 
those 
Places 
do 
not 
interfer 
with 
the 
said 



Conclusions; 
then 
its 
necessary 
before 
a 
Physical 
Proposition 
be 
condemned, 
to 
shew 
that 
it 
is 
not 
necessarily 
demonstrated; 
and 
this 
is 
to 
be 
done 
not 
by 
them 
who 
hold 
it 
to 
be 
true, 
but 
by 
those 
who 
judge 
it 
to 
be 
false. 
And 
this 
seemeth 
very 
reasonable, 
and 
agreeable 
to 
Nature; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
that 
they 
may 
much 
more 
easily 
find 
the 
fallacies 
in 
a 
Discourse, 
who 
believe 
it 
to 
be 
false, 
than 
those 
who 
account 
it 
true 
and 
concludent. 
Nay, 
in 
this 
particular 
it 
will 
come 
to 
passe, 
that 
the 
followers 
of 
this 
opinion, 
the 
more 
that 
they 
shall 
turn 
over 
Books, 
examine 
the 
Arguments, 
repeat 
the 
Observations, 
and 
compare 
the 
Experiments, 
the 
more 
shall 
they 
be 
confirmed 
in 
this 
belief. 
And 
your 
Highness 
knoweth 
what 
happened 
to 
the 
late 
Mathematick 
Professor 
in 
the 
University 
of 
Pisa, 
Who 
betook 
himself 
in 
his 
old 
age 
to 
look 
into 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
Copernicus, 
with 
hope 
that 
he 
might 
be 
able 
solidly 
to 
confute 
it 
(for 
that 
he 
held 
it 
so 
far 
to 
be 
false, 
as 
that 
he 
had 
never 
studied 
it) 
but 
it 
was 
his 
fortune, 
that 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
had 
understood 
the 
grounds, 
proceedings, 
and 
demonstrations 
of 
Copernicus, 
he 
found 
himself 
to 
be 
perswaded, 
and 
of 
an 
opposer 
became 
his 
most 
confident 
Defender. 
I 
might 
also 
nominate 
otherP. 
Clavius 
the 
Jesuite. 
Mathematicians, 
who 
being 
moved 
by 
my 
last 
Discoveries, 
have 
confessed 
it 
necessary 
to 
change 
the 
formerly 
received 
Constitution 
of 
the 
World, 
it 
not 
being 
able 
by 
any 
means 
to 
subsist 
any 
longer. 


If 
for 
the 
banishing 
this 
Opinion 
and 
Hypothesis 
out 
of 
the 
World, 
it 
were 
enough 
to 
stop 
the 
mouth 
of 
one 
alone, 
as 
it 
may 
be 
they 
perswade 
themselves 
who 
measuring 
others 
judgements 
by 
their 
own, 
think 
it 
impossible 
that 
this 
Doctrine 
should 
be 
able 
to 
subsist 
and 
finde 
any 
followers, 
this 
would 
be 
very 
easie 
to 
be 
done, 
but 
the 
business 
standeth 
otherwise: 
For 
to 
execute 
such 
a 
determination, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
prohibite 
not 
onely 
the 
Book 
of 
Copernicus, 
and 
the 
Writings 
of 
the 
other 
Authors 
that 
follow 
the 
same 
opinion, 
but 
to 
interdict 
the 
whole 
Science 
of 
Astronomy; 
and 
which 
is 
more, 
to 
forbid 
men 
looking 
towards 
Heaven, 
that 
so 
they 
might 
not 
see 
Mars 
and 
Venus 
at 
one 
time 
neer 
to 
the 
Earth, 
and 
at 
another 
farther 
off, 
with 
such 
a 
difference 
that 
the 
latter 
is 
found 
to 
be 
fourty 
times, 
and 
the 
former 
sixty 
times 
bigger 
in 
surface 
at 
one 
time 
than 
at 
another; 
and 
to 
the 
end, 
that 
the 
same 
Venus 
might 
not 
be 
discovered 
to 
be 
one 
while 
round, 
and 
another 
while 
forked, 
with 
most 
subtil 
hornes: 
and 
many 
other 
sensible 
Observations 
which 
can 
never 
by 
any 
means 
be 
reconciled 
to 
the 
Ptolomaick 
Systeme, 
but 
are 
unanswerable 
Arguments 
for 
theCopernican. 



But 
the 
prohibiting 
of 
Copernicus 
his 
Book, 
now 
that 
by 
many 
new 
Observations, 
and 
by 
the 
application 
of 
many 
of 
the 
Learned 
to 
the 
reading 
of 
him, 
his 
Hypothesis 
and 
Doctrine 
doth 
every 
day 
appear 
to 
be 
more 
true, 
having 
admitted 
and 
tolerated 
it 
for 
so 
many 
years, 
whilst 
he 
was 
lesse 
followed, 
studied, 
and 
confirmed, 
would 
seem, 
in 
my 
judgment, 
an 
affront 
to 
Truth, 
and 
a 
seeking 
the 
more 
to 
obscure 
and 
suppresse 
her, 
the 
more 
she 
sheweth 
her 
selfclearandperspicuous. 


The 
abolishing 
and 
censuring, 
not 
of 
the 
whole 
Book, 
but 
onely 
so 
much 
of 
it 
as 
concerns 
this 
particular 
opinion 
of 
the 
Earths 
Mobility, 
would, 
if 
I 
mistake 
not, 
be 
a 
greater 
detriment 
to 
souls, 
it 
being 
an 
occasion 
of 
great 
scandal, 
to 
see 
a 
Position 
proved, 
and 
to 
see 
it 
afterwards 
made 
an 
Heresie 
to 
believeit. 


The 
prohibiting 
of 
the 
whole 
Science, 
what 
other 
would 
it 
be 
but 
an 
open 
contempt 
of 
an 
hundred 
Texts 
of 
the 
Holy 
Scriptures, 
which 
teach 
us, 
That 
the 
Glory, 
and 
the 
Greatnesse 
of 
Almighty 
God 
is 
admirably 
discerned 
in 
all 
his 
Works, 
and 
divinely 
read 
in 
the 
Open 
Book 
of 
Heaven? 
Nor 
let 
any 
one 
think 
that 
the 
Lecture 
of 
the 
lofty 
conceits 
that 
are 
written 
in 
those 
Leaves 
finish 
in 
only 
beholding 
the 
Splendour 
of 
the 
Sun, 
and 
of 
the 
Stars, 
and 
their 
rising 
and 
setting, 
(which 
is 
the 
term 
to 
which 
the 
eyes 
of 
bruits 
and 
of 
the 
vulgar 
reach) 
but 
there 
are 
couched 
in 
them 
mysteries 
so 
profound, 
and 
conceipts 
so 
sublime, 
that 
the 
vigils, 
labours, 
and 
studies 
of 
an 
hundred 
and 
an 
hundred 
acute 
Wits, 
have 
not 
yet 
been 
able 
thorowly 
to 
dive 
into 
them 
after 
the 
continual 
disquisition 
of 
some 
thousands 
of 
years. 
But 
let 
the 
Unlearned 
believe, 
that 
like 
as 
that 
which 
their 
eyes 
discern 
in 
beholding 
the 
aspect 
of 
a 
humane 
body, 
is 
very 
little 
in 
comparison 
of 
the 
stupendious 
Artifices, 
which 
an 
exquisite 
and 
curious 
Anatomist 
or 
Philosopher 
finds 
in 
the 
same 
when 
he 
is 
searching 
for 
the 
use 
of 
so 
many 
Muscles, 
Tendons, 
Nerves, 
and 
Bones; 
and 
examining 
the 
Offices 
of 
the 
Heart, 
and 
of 
the 
other 
principal 
Members, 
seeking 
the 
seat 
of 
the 
vital 
Faculties, 
noting 
and 
observing 
the 
admirable 
structures 
of 
the 
Instruments 
of 
the 
Senses, 
and, 
without 
ever 
making 
an 
end 
of 
satisfying 
his 
curiosity 
and 
wonder, 
contemplating 
the 
Receptacles 
of 
the 
Imagination, 
of 
the 
Memory, 
and 
of 
the 
Understanding; 
So 
that 
which 
represents 
it 
self 
to 
the 
meer 
sight, 
is 
as 
nothing 
in 
comparison 
and 
proportion 
to 
the 
strange 
Wonders, 
that 
by 
help 
of 
long 
and 
accurate 
Observations 
the 
Wit 
of 
Learned 
Men 
discovereth 
in 
Heaven. 
And 
this 
is 
the 
substance 
of 
what 
I 
had 
to 
consider 
touching 
this 
particular. 



In 
the 
next 
place, 
as 
to 
those 
that 
adde, 
That 
those 
Natural 
Propositions 
of 
which 
the 
Scripture 
still 
speaks 
in 
one 
constant 
tenour, 
and 
which 
the 
Fathers 
all 
unanimously 
receive 
in 
the 
same 
sense, 
ought 
to 
be 
accepted 
according 
to 
the 
naked 
and 
literal 
sense 
of 
the 
Words, 
without 
glosses 
and 
interpretations; 
and 
received 
and 
held 
for 
most 
certain 
and 
true; 
and 
that 
consequently 
the 
Mobility 
of 
the 
Sun, 
and 
Stability 
of 
the 
Earth, 
as 
being 
such, 
are 
de 
Fide 
to 
be 
held 
for 
true, 
and 
the 
contrary 
opinion 
to 
be 
deemed 
Heretical. 
I 
shall 
propose 
to 
consideration, 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
That 
of 
Natural 
Propositions, 
some 
there 
are, 
of 
which 
all 
humane 
Science 
and 
Discourse 
can 
furnish 
us 
only 
with 
some 
plausible 
opinion, 
and 
probable 
conjecture 
rather 
than 
with 
any 
certain 
and 
demonstrative 
knowledge; 
as 
for 
example, 
whether 
the 
Stars 
be 
animated: 
Others 
there 
are, 
of 
which 
we 
have, 
or 
may 
confidently 
believe 
that 
we 
may 
have, 
by 
Experiments, 
long 
Observations, 
and 
Necessary 
Demonstrations 
an 
undubitable 
assurance; 
as 
for 
instance, 
whether 
the 
Earth 
and 
Heavens 
move, 
or 
not; 
whether 
the 
Heavens 
are 
Spherical, 
or 
otherwise. 
As 
to 
the 
first 
sort, 
I 
doubt 
not 
in 
the 
least, 
that 
if 
humane 
Ratiocinations 
cannot 
reach 
them, 
and 
that 
consequently 
there 
is 
no 
Science 
to 
be 
had 
of 
them, 
but 
only 
an 
Opinion 
or 
Belief, 
we 
ought 
fully 
and 
absolutely 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
meer 
Verbal 
Sense 
of 
the 
Scripture: 
But 
as 
to 
the 
other 
Positions, 
I 
should 
think 
(as 
hath 
been 
said 
above) 
That 
we 
are 
first 
to 
ascertain 
our 
selves 
of 
the 
fact 
it 
self, 
which 
will 
assist 
us 
in 
finding 
out 
the 
true 
senses 
of 
the 
Scriptures; 
which 
shall 
most 
certainly 
be 
found 
to 
accord 
with 
the 
fact 
demonstrated, 
for 
two 
truths 
can 
never 
contradict 
each 
other. 
And 
this 
I 
take 
to 
be 
a 
Doctrine 
orthodox 
and 
undoubted, 
for 
that 
I 
finde 
it 
written 
in 
Saint 
Augustine, 
who 
speaking 
to 
our 
point 
of 
the 
Figure 
of 
Heaven, 
and 
what 
it 
is 
to 
be 
believed 
to 
be, 
in 
regard 
that 
which 
Astronomers 
affirm 
concerning 
it 
seemeth 
to 
be, 
contrary 
to 
the 
Scripture,

founded 
only 
on 
the 
conjectures 
of 
humane 
infirmity: 
but 
if 
that 
which 
which 
they 
affirm 
be 
proved 
by 
indubitable 
Reasons, 
this 
Holy 
Father 
doth 
not 
say, 
that 
the 
Astronomers 
are 
to 
be 
enjoyned, 
that 
they 
themselves 
resolving 
and 
renouncing 
their 
Demonstrations 
do 
declare 
their 
Conclusion 
to 
be 
false, 
but 
saith, 
that 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
demonstrated, 
That 
what 
is 
said 
in 
Scripture 
of 
a 
Curtain 
is 
not 
contrary 
to 
their 
true 
Demonstrations. 
These 
are 
his 
words: 
Sed 
ait 
aliquis, 
quomodo 
non 
est 
contrarium 
iis, 
qui 



figuram 
Sphaerae 
Coelo 
tribunt, 
quod 
scriptum 
est 
in 
Libris 
Nostris, 
Qui 
extendit 
Coelum, 
sicut 
pellem? 
Sit 
sanè 
contraritem, 
si 
falsum 
est, 
quod 
illi 
dicunt: 
hoc 
enim 
verum 
est, 
qu 
[...]d 
Divina 
dicit 
authoritas, 
potius 
quam 
illud, 
qu 
[...]d 
humana 
infirmitas 
conjicit. 
Sea 
si 
forte 
illud 
talibus 
illi 
documentis 
probare 
potuerint, 
ut 
dubitari 
inde 
non 
debeat; 
demonstrandum 
est, 
hoc 
quod 
apud 
nos 
est 
de 
Pelle 
dictum, 
veris 
illis 
rationibus 
non 
esse 
contrarium. 
But 
some 
object; 
How 
doth 
it 
appear, 
that 
the 
saying 
in 
our 
Bibles, 
Who 
stretcheth 
out 
the 
Heaven 
as 
a 
Curtain, 
maketh 
not 
against 
those 
who 
maintain 
the 
Heavens 
to 
be 
in 
figure 
of 
a 
Sphere? 
Let 
it 
be 
so, 
if 
that 
be 
false 
which 
they 
affirme: 
For 
that 
is 
truth 
which 
is 
spoke 
by 
Divine 
Authority, 
rather 
than 
that 
which 
proceeds 
from 
Humane 
Infirmity. 
But 
if 
peradventure 
they 
should 
be 
able 
to 
prove 
their 
Position 
by 
such 
Experiments 
as 
puts 
it 
out 
of 
question, 
it 
is 
to 
be 
proved, 
that 
vvhat 
is 
said 
in 
Scripture 
concerningaCurtain,dothinnovvisecontradicttheirmanifestReasons. 


He 
proceedeth 
afterwards 
to 
admonish 
us 
that 
we 
ought 
to 
be 
no 
less 
careful 
and 
observant 
in 
reconciling 
a 
Text 
of 
Scripture 
with 
a 
demonstrated 
Natural 
Proposition, 
than 
w 
[...]th 
another 
Text 
of 
Scripture 
which 
should 
sound 
to 
a 
contrary 
Sense. 
Nay 
methinks 
that 
the 
circumspection 
of 
this 
Saint 
is 
worthy 
to 
be 
admired 
and 
imitated, 
who 
even 
in 
obscure 
Conclusions, 
and 
of 
which 
we 
may 
assure 
our 
selves 
that 
we 
can 
have 
no 
knowledge 
or 
Science 
by 
humane 
demonstration, 
is 
very 
reserved 
in 
determining 
what 
is 
to 
be 
believed, 
as 
we 
see 
by 
that 
which 
he 
writeth 
in 
the 
end 
of 
his 
second 
Book, 
de 
Genesi 
ad 
Litteram, 
speaking, 
whether 
the 
Stars 
are 
to 
be 
believed 
animate:Quod 
licet 
in 
praesenti 
facile 
non 
possit 
comprehendi; 
arbitror 
tamen, 
in 
processu 
tractandarum 
Scripturarum, 
opportuniora 
loca 
posse 
occurrere, 
ubi 
nobis 
de 
hac 
re, 
secundum 
Sancta 
auctoritatis 
Litteras, 
etsi 
non 
ost 
endere 
certum 
aliquid, 
tamen 
credere 
licebit. 
Nunc 
autem, 
servatâ 
semper 
modoratione 
piae 
gravitatis, 
nihil 
credere 
dere 
obscura 
temere 
debemus; 
ne 
fortè, 
quod 
postea 
veritas 
patefecerit, 
quamvis 
Libris 
Sanctis, 
sive 
Testamenti 
veteris, 
sive, 
novi 
nullo 
modo 
esse 
possit 
aeeversum, 
tamen 
propter 
amorem 
nostri 
erroris, 
oderimus. 
Which 
particular, 
although 
(at 
present) 
it 
cannot 
easily 
be 
comprehended, 
yet 
I 
suppose 
in 
our 
farther 
Progress 
of 
handling 
the 
Scriptures, 
we 
may 
meet 
with 
some 
more 
pertinent 
places, 
upon 
which 
it 
will 
be 
permitted 
us 
(if 
not 
to 
determin 
any 
thing 
for 
certain, 
yet) 
to 
suggest 
somewhat 
concerning 
this 
matter, 
according 
to 
the 
dictates 
of 
Sacred 
Authority. 
But 
novv, 
the 
moderation 
of 
pious 
gravity 
being 
alwaies 
observed, 
vve 
ought 
to 
receive 
nothing 
rashly 
in 
a 
doubtful 
point, 
least 
perhaps 
vve 



reject 
that 
out 
of 
respect 
to 
our 
Errour, 
vvhich 
hereafter 
Truth 
may 
discover, 
to 
be 
in 
no 
vvise 
repugnant 
to 
the 
Sacred 
Volumes 
of 
the 
Old 
and 
Nevv 
Testament. 


By 
this 
and 
other 
places 
(if 
I 
deceive 
not 
my 
self) 
the 
intent 
of 
the 
Holy 
Fathers 
appeareth 
to 
be, 
That 
in 
Natural 
questions, 
and 
which 
are 
not 
de 
Fide, 
it 
is 
first 
to 
be 
considered, 
whether 
they 
be 
indubitably 
demonstrated, 
or 
by 
sensible 
Experiments 
known; 
or 
whether 
such 
a 
knowledge 
and 
demonstration 
is 
to 
be 
had; 
which 
having 
obtained, 
and 
it 
being 
the 
gift 
of 
God, 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
applyed 
to 
find 
out 
the 
true 
Sences 
of 
the 
Sacred 
Pages 
in 
those 
places, 
which 
in 
appearance 
might 
seem 
to 
speak 
to 
a 
contrary 
meaning: 
Which 
will 
unquestionably 
be 
pierced 
into 
by 
Prudent 
Divines, 
together 
with 
the 
occasions 
that 
moved 
the 
Holy 
Ghost,Id.

in

our 
exercise, 
or 
for 
some 
other 
reason 
to 
me 
unknown)to 
veilit 
selfsometimesunder 
wordsofdifferentsignifications. 


As 
to 
the 
other 
point, 
Of 
our 
regarding 
the 
Primary 
Scope 
of 
those 
Sacred 
Volumes, 
I 
cannot 
think 
that 
their 
having 
spoken 
alwaies 
in 
the 
same 
tenour, 
doth 
any 
thing 
at 
all 
disturb 
this 
Rule. 
For 
if 
it 
hath 
been 
the 
Scope 
of 
the 
Scripture 
by 
way 
of 
condescention 
to 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
Vulgar 
at 
any 
time, 
to 
express 
a 
Proposition 
in 
words, 
that 
bear 
a 
sense 
different 
from 
the 
Essence 
of 
the 
said 
Proposition; 
why 
might 
it 
not 
have 
observed 
the 
same, 
and 
for 
the 
same 
respect, 
as 
often 
as 
it 
had 
occasion 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
same 
thing? 
Nay 
Iconceive,thattohave 
done 
otherwise, 
would 
buthave 
encreased 
the 
confusion, 
and 
diminished 
the 
credit 
that 
these 
Sacred 
Records 
ought 
to 
haveamongsttheCommonPeople. 


Again, 
that 
touching 
the 
Rest 
and 
Motion 
of 
the 
Sun 
and 
Earth, 
it 
was 
necessary, 
for 
accommodation▪ 
to 
Popular 
Capacity, 
to 
assert 
that 
which 
the 
Litteral 
sense 
of 
the 
Scripture 
importeth, 
experience 
plainly 
proveth: 
For 
that 
even 
to 
our 
dayes 
people 
far 
less 
rude, 
do 
continue 
in 
the 
same 
Opinion 
upon 
Reasons, 
that 
if 
they 
were 
well 
weighed 
and 
examined, 
would 
be 
found 
to 
be 
extream 
trivial, 
and 
upon 
Experiments, 
either 
wholly 
false, 
or 
altogether 
besidesthepurpose. 
Norisitworth 
whiletogoabouttoremovethemfrom 
it, 
they 
being 
incapable 
of 
the 
contrary 
Reasons 
that 
depend 
upon 
too 
exquisite 
Observations, 
and 
too 
subtil 
Demonstrations, 
grounded 
upon 
Abstractions, 
which, 
for 
the 
comprehending 
of 
them, 
require 
too 
strong 
an 
Imagination. 
Whereupon, 
although 
that 
the 
Stability 
of 
Heaveu, 
and 
Motion 
of 
the 
Earth 
should 
be 
more 
than 
certain 
and 
demonstrated 
to 
the 
Wise; 
yet 
nevertheless 
it 
would 
be 
necessary, 
for 
the 
conservation 
of 
credit 
amongst 
the 
Vulgar, 
to 



affirm 
the 
contrary: 
For 
that 
of 
a 
thousand 
ordinary 
men, 
that 
come 
to 
be 
questioned 
concerning 
these 
particulars, 
its 
probab 
[...]e 
that 
there 
will 
not 
be 
found 
so 
much 
as 
one 
that 
will 
not 
answer 
that 
he 
thinketh, 
and 
so 
certainly 
he 
doth, 
that 
the 
Sun 
moveth, 
and 
the 
Earth 
standeth 
still. 
But 
yet 
none 
ought 
to 
take 
this 
common 
Popular 
Assent 
to 
be 
any 
Argument 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
that 
which 
is 
affirmed: 
For 
if 
we 
should 
examine 
these 
very 
men 
touching 
the 
grounds 
and 
motives 
by 
which 
they 
are 
induced 
to 
believe 
in 
that 
manner; 
and 
on 
the 
other 
side 
should 
hear 
what 
Experiments 
and 
Demonstrations 
perswade 
those 
few 
others 
to 
believe 
the 
contrary, 
we 
should 
finde 
these 
latter 
to 
be 
moved 
by 
most 
solid 
Reasons, 
and 
the 
former 
by 
simple 
appearances, 
and 
vain 
and 
ridiculous 
occurrences. 
That 
therefore 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
assign 
Motion 
to 
the 
Sun, 
and 
Rest 
to 
the 
earth, 
lest 
the 
shallow 
capacity 
of 
the 
Vulgar 
should 
be 
confounded, 
amused, 
and 
rendred 
obstinate 
and 
contumacious, 
in 
giving 
credit 
to 
the 
principal 
Articles, 
and 
which 
are 
absolutely 
de 
fide, 
it 
is 
sufficiently 
obvious. 
And 
if 
it 
was 
necessary 
so 
to 
do, 
it 
is 
not 
at 
all 
to 
be 
wondred 
at, 
that 
it 
was 
with 
extraordinary 
Wisdom 
so 
done,intheDivineScriptures. 


But 
I 
will 
alledge 
further, 
That 
not 
onely 
a 
respect 
to 
the 
Incapacity 
of 
the 
Vulgar, 
but 
the 
current 
Opinion 
of 
those 
times 
made 
the 
Sacred 
Writers, 
in 
the 
points 
that 
were 
not 
necessary 
to 
salvation, 
to 
accommodate 
themselves 
more 
to 
the 
received 
use, 
than 
to 
the 
true 
Essence 
of 
things: 
Of 
which 
S. 
Hierom 
treating, 
writeth:Quasi 
non 
mu 
[...]tain 
Scripturis 
Sanctis 
dicantur 
juxta 
opinionem 
illius 
temporis 
quo 
gesta 
referunt, 
& 
non 
juxta 
quod 
rei 
veritas 
contenebat. 
D. 
Hiero. 
in 
c. 
28. 
Jerem. 
As 
if 
many 
things 
were 
not 
spoken 
in 
the 
Holy 
Scriptures 
according 
to 
the 
judgement 
of 
those 
times 
in 
which 
they 
were 
acted, 
and 
not 
according 
to 
that 
which 
truth 
contained. 
And 
elsewhere, 
the 
same 
Saint:Consuetudinis 
Scripturarum 
est, 
ut 
opinionem 
multarum 
rerum 
sic 
narret 
Historicus, 
quomodo 
eo 
tempore 
ab 
omnibus 
credebatur. 
In 
ca. 
Matth. 
It 
is 
the 
custome 
for 
the 
Pen-men 
of 
Scripture, 
to 
deliver 
their 
Judgments 
in 
many 
things, 
according 
to 
the 
common 
received 
opinion 
that 
their 
times 
had 
of 
them. 
AndD. 
Thomas, 
in 
ca. 
Job. 
v. 
7. 
S. 
Thomas 
Aquinas 
in 
Job 
upon 
those 
words, 
Qui 
extendit 
Aquilonem 
super 
vacuum, 
& 
appendit 
Terram 
super 
nihilum: 
Noteth 
that 
the 
Scripture 
calleth 
that 
space 
Vacuum 
and 
Nihilum, 
which 
imbraceth 
and 
invironeth 
the 
Earth, 
and 
which 
we 
know, 
not 
to 
be 
empty, 
bat 
filled 
with 
Air, 
Neverthelesse, 
saith 
he, 
The 
Scripture 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
apprehension 
of 
the 
Vulgar, 
who 
think 
that 
in 
that 
same 
space 
there 
is 
nothing, 
calleth 
it 
Vacuum 
and 
Nihilum. 
Here 



the 
words 
of 
S. 
Thomas, 
Quod 
de 
superiori 
Haemisphaerio 
Coeli 
nihil 
nobis 
apparet, 
nisi 
spatium 
aëre 
plenum, 
quod 
vulgares 
homines 
reputant 
Vacuum; 
loquitur 
enim 
secundum 
existimationem 
vulgarium 
hominum, 
prout 
est 
mos 
in 
Sacra 
Scriptura. 
Now 
from 
this 
Place 
I 
think 
one 
may 
very 
Logically 
argue, 
That 
the 
Sacred 
Scripture 
for 
the 
same 
respect 
had 
much 
more 
reason 
to 
phrase 
the 
Sun 
moveable, 
and 
the 
Earth 
immoveable. 
For 
if 
we 
should 
try 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
Common 
People, 
we 
should 
find 
them 
much 
more 
unapt 
to 
be 
perswaded 
of 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
Sun, 
and 
Motion 
of 
the 
Earth, 
than 
that 
the 
space 
that 
environeth 
it 
is 
full 
of 
Air. 
Therefore 
if 
the 
sacred 
Authors, 
in 
this 
point, 
which 
had 
not 
so 
much 
difficulty 
to 
be 
beat 
into 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
Vulgar, 
have 
notwithstanding 
forborn 
to 
attempt 
perswading 
them 
unto 
it, 
it 
must 
needs 
seem 
very 
reasonable 
that 
in 
other 
Propositions 
much 
more 
abstrusethey 
have 
observed 
the 
same 
stile. 
Nay 
Copernicus 
himself,knowing 
what 
power 
an 
antiquated 
custome 
and 
way 
of 
conceiving 
things 
become 
familiar 
to 
us 
from 
our 
infancy 
hath 
in 
our 
Fancy, 
that 
he 
might 
not 
increase 
confusion 
and 
difficulty 
in 
our 
apprehensions,after 
he 
had 
first 
demonstrated, 
That 
the 
Motions 
which 
appear 
to 
us 
to 
belong 
to 
the 
Sun, 
or 
to 
the 
Firmament, 
are 
really 
in 
the 
Earth; 
in 
proceeding 
afterwards 
to 
reduce 
them 
into 
Tables, 
and 
to 
apply 
them 
to 
use, 
he 
calleth 
them 
the 
Motions 
of 
the 
Sun, 
and 
of 
the 
Heaven 
that 
is 
above 
the 
Planets; 
expresly 
terming 
them 
the 
Rising 
and 
Setting 
of 
the 
Sun 
and 
Stars; 
and 
mutations 
in 
the 
obliquity 
of 
the 
Zodiack, 
and 
variations 
in 
the 
points 
of 
the 
Equinoxes, 
the 
Middle 
Motion, 
Anomalia, 
Prosthaphaeresis 
of 
the 
Sun; 
and 
such 
other 
things; 
which 
do 
in 
reality 
belong 
to 
the 
Earth: 
But 
because 
being 
joyned 
to 
it, 
and 
consequently 
having 
a 
share 
in 
every 
of 
its 
motions, 
we 
cannot 
immediately 
discern 
them 
in 
her, 
but 
are 
forced 
to 
refer 
them 
to 
the 
Celestial 
Bodies 
in 
which 
they 
appear;thereforewecall 
them 
asiftheyweremadethere,wheretheyseemto 
us 
to 
be 
made. 
Whence 
it 
is 
to 
be 
noted 
how 
nenessary 
it 
is 
to 
accommodate 
ourdiscoursetoouroldandaccustomedmannerofunderstanding. 


That, 
in 
the 
next 
place, 
the 
common 
consent 
of 
Fathers, 
in 
receiving 
a 
Natural 
Proposition 
of 
Scripture, 
all 
in 
the 
same 
sense 
ought 
to 
Authorize 
it 
so 
far, 
as 
to 
make 
it 
become 
a 
matter 
of 
Faith 
to 
believe 
it 
to 
beNamely, 
according 
to 
the 
Litteral 
Sense. 
so, 
I 
should 
think 
that 
it 
ought 
at 
most 
to 
be 
understood 
of 
those 
Conclusions 
onely, 
which 
have 
been 
by 
the 
said 
Fathers 
discussed, 
and 
sifted 
with 
all 
possible 
diligence, 
and 
debated 
on 
the 
one 
side, 
and 
on 
the 
other, 
and 
all 
things 
in 
the 
end 
concurring 
to 
disprove 
the 
one, 
and 
prove 
the 
other. 
But 
the 
Mobility 
of 
the 
Earth, 
and 
Stability 
of 
the 
Sun, 
are 



not 
of 
this 
kinde; 
For, 
that 
the 
said 
Opinion 
was 
in 
those 
times 
totally 
buried, 
and 
never 
brought 
amongst 
the 
Questions 
of 
the 
Schools, 
and 
not 
considered, 
much 
less 
followed 
by 
any 
one: 
So 
that 
it 
is 
to 
be 
believed 
that 
it 
never 
so 
much 
as 
entered 
into 
the 
thought 
of 
the 
Fathers 
to 
dispute 
it, 
the 
Places 
of 
Scripture, 
their 
own 
Opinion, 
and 
the 
assent 
of 
men 
having 
all 
concurred 
in 
the 
same 
judgement, 
without 
the 
contradiction 
of 
any 
one, 
so 
far 
as 
we 
can 
finde. 


Besides, 
it 
is 
not 
enough 
to 
say 
that 
the 
Fathers 
all 
admit 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
Earth, 
&c. 
Therefore 
to 
believe 
it 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
Faith: 
But 
its 
necessary 
to 
prove 
that 
they 
have 
condemned 
the 
contrary 
Opinion: 
For 
I 
may 
affirm 
and 
bide 
by 
this, 
That 
their 
not 
having 
occasion 
to 
make 
satisfaction 
upon 
the 
same, 
and 
to 
discussit, 
hathmade 
them 
to 
omit 
and 
admit 
it, 
onelyas 
current, 
butnotasresolvedandproved. 
And 
IthinkIhave 
verygoodReasonforwhat 
I 
say; 
For 
either 
the 
Fathers 
did 
make 
reflection 
upon 
this 
Conclusion 
as 
controverted, 
or 
not: 
If 
not, 
then 
they 
could 
determin 
nothing 
concerning 
it, 
no 
not 
in 
their 
private 
thoughts; 
and 
their 
incogitance 
doth 
not 
oblige 
us 
to 
receive 
those 
Precepts 
which 
they 
have 
not, 
so 
much 
as 
in 
their 
intentions 
enjoyned. 
But 
if 
they 
did 
reflect 
and 
consider 
thereon, 
they 
would 
long 
since 
have 
condemned 
it, 
if 
they 
had 
judged 
it 
erroneous; 
which 
we 
do 
not 
find 
that 
they 
have 
done. 
Nay, 
after 
that 
some 
Divines 
have 
began 
to 
consider 
it, 
we 
find 
that 
they 
have 
not 
deem’d 
it 
erroneous; 
as 
we 
read 
in 
the 
Commentaries 
of 
Didacus 
a 
Stunica 
upon 
Job, 
in 
Ca, 
v. 
6. 
on 
the 
words, 
Qui 
commovet 
Terram 
de 
loco 
suo, 
&c. 
Where 
he 
at 
large 
discourseth 
upon 
the 
Copernican 
Hypothesis, 
and 
concludeth, 
That 
the 
Mobility 
of 
the 
Earth, 
is 
not 
contrary 
to 
Scripture. 


Withal, 
I 
may 
justly 
question 
the 
truth 
of 
that 
determination, 
namely, 
That 
the 
Church 
enjoyneth 
us 
to 
hold 
such 
like 
Natural 
Conclusions 
as 
matters 
of 
Faith,onelybecausetheybear 
thestampofan 
unanimousInterpretation 
ofall 
the 
Fathers: 
And 
I 
do 
suppose 
that 
it 
may 
possibly 
be, 
that 
those 
who 
hold 
in 
this 
manner, 
might 
possibly 
have 
gone 
about 
in 
favour 
of 
their 
own 
Opinion, 
to 
have 
amplified 
the 
Decretal 
of 
the 
Councils; 
which 
I 
cannot 
finde 
in 
this 
case 
to 
prohibit 
any 
other, 
save 
onely, 
Perverting 
to 
Senses 
contrary 
to 
that 
of 
Holy 
Church, 
or 
of 
the 
concurrent 
consent 
of 
Fathers, 
those 
places, 
and 
those 
onely 
that 
do 
pertain 
either 
to 
Faith 
or 
Manners, 
or 
concern 
our 
edification 
in 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
Christianity: 
And 
thus 
speaks 
the 
Council 
of 
Trent. 
Concil. 
Trid. 
Sess.

Sess.

But 
the 
Mobility 
or 
Stability 
of 
the 
Earth, 
or 
of 
the 
Sun, 
are 
not 
matters 
of 
Faith, 
nor 
contrary 
to 
Manners, 
nor 
is 
there 
any 
one, 
that 



for 
the 
stablishing 
of 
this 
Opinion, 
will 
pervert 
places 
of 
Scripture 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
Holy 
Church, 
or 
to 
the 
Fathers: 
Nay, 
Those 
who 
have 
writ 
of 
this 
Doctrine, 
did 
never 
make 
use 
of 
Texts 
of 
Scripture; 
that 
they 
might 
leave 
it 
still 
in 
the 
breasts 
of 
Grave 
and 
Prudent 
Divines 
to 
interpret 
the 
said 
Places, 
according 
totheirtrue 
meaning. 


And 
how 
far 
the 
Decrees 
of 
Councills 
do 
comply 
with 
the 
Holy 
Fathers 
in 
these 
particulars, 
may 
be 
sufficiently 
manifest, 
in 
that 
they 
are 
so 
far 
from 
enjoyning 
to 
receive 
such 
like 
Natural 
Conclusions 
for 
matters 
of 
Faith, 
or 
from 
censuring 
the 
contrary 
Opinions 
as 
erronious; 
that 
rather 
respecting 
the 
Primitive 
and 
primary 
intention 
of 
the 
Holy 
Church, 
they 
do 
adjudge 
it 
unprofitable 
to 
be 
busied 
in 
examining 
the 
truth 
thereof. 
Let 
your 
Highness 
be 
pleased 
to 
hear 
once 
again 
what 
S. 
Augustine 
answers 
to 
to 
those 
Brethren 
who 
put 
the 
Question, 
Whether 
it 
be 
true 
that 
Heaven 
moveth, 
or 
standeth 
still?His 
resp 
[...]ndeo, 
mul 
[...]um 
subuliter, 
& 
laboriosis 
rationibus, 
ista 
perquiri, 
ut 
vere 
percipiatur, 
utrum 
ita, 
an 
non 
ita 
sit: 
quibus 
ineundis 
atque 
tractandis, 
nec 
mihi 
jam, 
tem 
[...]us 
est, 
nec 
illis 
esse 
debet, 
quos 
ad 
salutem 
suam, 
Sanctae 
Ecclesiae 
necessariamutilitatem 
cupimus 
informari. 
To 
these 
I 
answer, 
That 
Points 
of 
this 
nature 
require 
a 
curious 
and 
profound 
examination, 
that 
it 
may 
truly 
appear 
whether 
they 
be 
true 
or 
false; 
a 
work 
inconsistent 
with 
my 
leasure 
to 
undertake 
or 
go 
thorow 
with, 
nor 
is 
it 
any 
way 
necessary 
for 
those, 
whom 
we 
desire 
to 
inform 
of 
things 
that 
more 
nearlyconcerntheirownsalvationandTheChurches 
Benefit. 


But 
yet 
although 
in 
Natural 
Propositions 
we 
were 
to 
take 
the 
resolution 
of 
condemning 
or 
admitting 
them 
from 
Texts 
of 
Scripture 
unanimously 
expounded 
in 
the 
same 
Sense 
by 
all 
the 
Fathers, 
yet 
do 
I 
not 
see 
how 
this 
Rule 
can 
hold 
in 
our 
Case; 
for 
that 
upon 
the 
same 
Places 
we 
read 
several 
Expositions 
in 
the 
Fathers; 
Non 
solem, 
sed 
Primum 
Mobile 
immotum 
constitisse: 
Dionis. 
Areop. 
Dionysius 
Areopagita 
saying, 
That 
the 
Primum 
Mobile, 
and 
not 
the 
Sun 
stand 
still. 
Saint 
Augustine 
is 
of 
the 
same 
Opinion; 
Omnia 
corpora 
Caelestia, 
immota 
substitisse: 
All 
the 
Celestial 
Bodies 
were 
immoveable. 
And 
with 
them 
concurreth 
Abulensis. 
But 
which 
is 
more, 
amongst 
the 
Jewish 
Authors 
(whom 
Josephus 
applauds) 
some 
have 
held,Solem 
revera 
non 
substitisse 
immotum, 
sed 
probrevi 
tempore, 
intra 
quod 
Israelitae, 
hostes 
suos 
fuderunt, 
id 
ita 
visumesse. 
That 
The 
Sun 
did 
not 
really 
stand 
still, 
but 
seemed 
so 
to 
do, 
during 
the 
short 
time 
in 
which 
Israel 
gave 
the 
overthrow 
to 
their 
Enemies. 
So 
for 
the 
Miracle 
in 
the 
time 
of 
Hezekiah, 
Paulus 
Burgensis 
is 
of 
opinion 
that 
it 
was 
not 
wrought 
on 
the 
Sun, 
but 
on 
the 



Diall. 
But 
that, 
in 
short, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
Glosse 
and 
Interpret 
the 
words 
of 
the 
Text 
in 
Joshua, 
when 
ever 
the 
Worlds 
Systeme 
is 
in 
dispute,Isa. 
Ca. 
I 
shall 
shew 
anon. 
Now 
finally, 
granting 
to 
these 
Gentlemen 
more 
than 
they 
demand, 
to 
wit, 
That 
we 
are 
wholly 
to 
acquiesce 
in 
the 
judgment 
of 
Judicious 
Divines, 
and 
that 
in 
regard 
that 
such 
a 
particular 
Disquisition 
is 
not 
found 
to 
have 
been 
made 
by 
the 
Ancient 
Fathers, 
it 
may 
be 
undertaken 
by 
the 
Sages 
of 
our 
Age, 
who 
having 
first 
heard 
the 
Experiments, 
Observations, 
Reasons, 
and 
Demonstrations 
of 
Philosophers 
and 
Astronomers, 
on 
theone 
side, 
andon 
the 
other 
(seeing 
that 
the 
Controversie 
is 
about 
Natural 
Problems, 
and 
Necessary 
Dilemma’s, 
and 
which 
cannot 
possibly 
be 
otherwise 
than 
in 
one 
of 
the 
two 
manners 
in 
controversie) 
they 
may 
with 
competent 
certainty 
determine 
what 
Divine 
Inspirations 
shall 
dictate 
to 
them. 
But 
that 
without 
minutely 
examining 
and 
discussing 
all 
the 
Reasons 
on 
both 
sides; 
and 
without 
ever 
comming 
to 
any 
certainty 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
Case, 
such 
a 
Resolution 
should 
be 
taken, 
Is 
not 
to 
be 
hoped 
from 
those 
who 
do 
not 
stick 
to 
hazzard 
the 
Majesty 
and 
Dignity 
of 
the 
Sacred 
Scripture, 
in 
defending 
the 
reputation 
of 
their 
vain 
Fancies; 
Nor 
to 
be 
feared 
from 
those 
who 
make 
it 
their 
whole 
businesse, 
to 
examine 
with 
all 
intensness, 
what 
the 
Grounds 
of 
this 
Doctrine 
are;andthatonlyin 
anHolyZealforTruth,theSacredScriptures,andforthe 
Majesty, 
Dignity, 
and 
Authority, 
in 
which 
every 
Christian 
should 
indeavour 
to 
have 
them 
maintained. 
Which 
Dignity, 
who 
seeth 
not 
that 
it 
is 
with 
greater 
Zeal 
desired 
and 
procured 
by 
those 
who, 
absolutely 
submitting 
themselves 
to 
the 
Holy 
Church, 
desire, 
not 
that 
this, 
or 
that 
opinion 
may 
be 
prohibited, 
but 
onely 
that 
such 
things 
may 
be 
proposed 
to 
consideration, 
as 
may 
the 
more 
ascertain 
her 
in 
the 
safest 
choice, 
than 
by 
those 
who 
being 
blinded 
by 
their 
particular 
Interest, 
or 
stimulated 
by 
malitious 
suggestions, 
preach 
that 
she 
should, 
without 
more 
ado, 
thunder 
out 
Curses, 
for 
that 
she 
had 
power 
so 
to 
do: 
Not 
considering 
that 
all 
that 
may 
be 
done 
is 
not 
alwayes 
convenient 
to 
be 
done. 
The 
Holy 
Fathers 
of 
old 
were 
not 
of 
this 
opinion, 
but 
rather 
knowing 
of 
how 
great 
prejudice, 
and 
how 
much 
against 
the 
primary 
intent 
of 
the 
Catholick 
Church, 
it 
would 
be 
to 
go 
about 
from 
Texts 
of 
Scripture 
to 
decide 
Natural 
Conclusions, 
touching 
which, 
either 
Experiments 
or 
necessary 
Demonstrations, 
might 
in 
time 
to 
come 
evince 
the 
contrary, 
of 
that 
which 
the 
naked 
sense 
of 
the 
Words 
soundeth, 
they 
have 
not 
only 
proceeded 
with 
great 
circumspection, 
but 
have 
left 
the 
following 
Precepts 
for 
the 
instruction 
of 
others.In

&

In 
points 
obscure 
and 
remote 
from 
our 
Sight, 
if 
we 
come 
to 
read 
any 
thing 
out 
of 
Sacred 
Writ, 
that, 
with 
a 
Salvo 
to 
the 
Faith 
that 
we 
have 
imbued, 
may 
correspond 
with 
several 
constructions, 
let 
us 
not 
so 
farre 
throw 
our 
selves 
upon 
any 
of 
them 
with 
a 
precipitous 
obstinacy, 
as 
that 
if, 
perhaps 
the 
Truth 
being 
more 
diligently 
search’t 
into, 
it 
should 
justly 
fall 
to 
the 
ground, 
we 
might 
fall 
together 
with 
it: 
and 
so 
shew 
that 
we 
contend 
not 
for 
the 
sense 
of 
Divine 
Scriptures, 
but 
our 
own, 
in 
that 
we 
would 
have 
that 
which 
is 
our 
own 
to 
be 
the 
sense 
of 
Scriptures, 
vvhen 
as 
vve 
should 
rather 
desiretheScripturesmeaningtobeours. 


He 
goeth 
on, 
and 
a 
little 
after 
teacheth 
us, 
that 
no 
Proposition 
can 
be 
against 
the 
Faith, 
unlesse 
first 
it 
be 
demonstrated 
false; 
saying,Tam 
diu 
non 
est 
extra 
fidem, 
donec 
Veritate 
certissima 
refellatur. 
Quod 
si 
factum 
fuerit, 
non 
hoc 
habebat 
Divina 
Scriptura, 
sed 
hoc 
senserat 
humana 
Ignorantia. 
Ibid. 
Tis 
not 
all 
the 
while 
contrary 
to 
Faith, 
until 
it 
be 
disproved 
by 
most 
certain 
Truth, 
which 
if 
it 
should 
so 
be, 
the 
Holy 
Scripture 
affirm’d 
it 
not, 
but 
Humane 
Ignorance 
supposed 
it. 
Whereby 
we 
see 
that 
the 
senses 
which 
we 
impose 
on 
Texts 
of 
Scripture, 
would 
be 
false, 
when 
ever 
they 
should 
disagree 
with 
Truths 
demonstrated. 
And 
therefore 
we 
ought, 
by 
help 
of 
demonstrated 
Truth, 
to 
seek 
the 
undoubted 
sense 
of 
Scripture: 
and 
not 
according 
to 
the 
sound 
of 
the 
words, 
that 
may 
seem 
true 
to 
our 
weaknesse, 
to 
go 
about, 
as 
it 
were, 
to 
force 
Nature, 
and 
to 
deny 
Experiments 
and 
Necessary 
Demonstrations. 


Let 
Your 
Highnesse 
be 
pleased 
to 
observe 
farther, 
with 
how 
great 
circumspection 
this 
Holy 
Man 
proceedeth, 
before 
he 
affirmeth 
any 
Interpretation 
of 
Scripture 
to 
be 
sure, 
and 
in 
such 
wise 
certain, 
as 
that 
it 
need 
not 
fear 
the 
encounter 
of 
any 
difficulty 
that 
may 
procure 
it 
disturbance, 
for 
not 
contenting 
himself 
that 
some 
sense 
of 
Scripture 
agreeth 
with 
some 
Demonstration, 
he 
subjoynes. 
Si 
autem 
hoc 
verum 
esse 
vera 
ratio 
demonstraverit, 
adhuc 
incertum 
erit, 
utrum 
hoc 
in 
illis 
verbis 
Sanctorum 
Librorum, 
Scriptor 
sentiri 
voluerit, 
an 
aliquid 
aliud 
non 
minus 
verum. 
Quod

non

But 
if 
right 
Reason 
shall 
demonstrate 
this 
to 
be 
true, 
yet 
is 
it 
questionable 
whether 
in 
these 
words 
of 
Sacred 
Scripture 
the 
Pen-man 
would 
have 
this 
to 
be 
understood, 
or 
somewhat 
else, 
no 
lesse 
true. 
And 
in 
case 
the 
Context 
of 
his 
Words 
shall 
prove 
that 
he 
intended 
not 
this, 
yet 
will 
not 
that 
which 
he 
would 
have 
to 
be 
understood 
be 
therefore 
false, 
but 
most 
true, 
aad 
that 
whichis 
more 
profitable 
tobeknovvn. 


But 
that 
which 
increaseth 
our 
wonder 
concerning 
the 
circumspection, 
wherewith 
this 
Pious 
Author 
proceedeth, 
is, 
that 
not 
trusting 
to 
his 
observing, 
that 
both 
Demonstrative 
Reasons, 
and 
the 
sense 
that 
the 
words 
of 
Scripture 
and 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
Context 
both 
precedent 
and 
subsequent, 
do 
conspire 
to 
provethe 
same 
thing,headdeth 
thefollowing 
words. 


Si 
autem 
contextio 
Scripturae, 
hoc 
voluiss 
intelligi 
Scriptorem, 
non 
repugnaverit, 
adhuc 
restabit 
quaerere, 
utrum 
& 
aliud 
non 
potuerit. 
But 
if 
the 
Context 
do 
not 
hold 
forth 
any 
thing 
that 
may 
disprove 
this 
to 
be 
the 
Authors 
Sense, 
it 
yet 
remains 
to 
enquire, 
Whether 
the 
other 
may 
not 
be 
intended 
also. 
And 
not 
yet 
resolving 
to 
accept 
of 
one 
Sense, 
or 
reject 
another, 
but 
thinking 
that 
he 
could 
never 
use 
sufficient 
caution, 
he 
proceedeth: 
Quod 
si 
& 
aliud 
potuisse 
invenerimus, 
incertum 
erit; 
quidnam 
eorum 
ille 
voluerit: 
aut 
utrumque 
voluisse 
non 
inconvenienter 
creditur, 
si 
utriusque 
sententiae 
certa 
circumstantia 
sufragatur. 
But 
if 
so 
be 
we 
finde 
that 
the 
other 
may 
be 
also 
meant, 
it 
vvill 
be 
doubted 
which 
of 
them 
he 
would 
have 
to 
stand; 
or 
which 
in 
probability 
he 
may 
be 
thought 
to 
aim 
at, 
if 
the 
true 
circumstances 
on 
both 
sides 
be 
weighed. 
And 
lastly, 
intending 
to 
render 
a 
Reason 
of 
this 
his 
Rule, 
by 
shewing 
us 
to 
what 
perils 
those 
men 
expose 
the 
Scriptures, 
and 
the 
Church; 
who, 
more 
respecting 
the 
support 
of 
their 
own 
errours, 
than 
the 
Scriptures 
Dignity, 
would 
stretch 
its 
Authority 
beyond 
the 
Bounds 
which 
it 
prescribeth 
to 
it 
self, 
he 
subjoyns 
the 
ensuing 
words, 
which 
of 
themselves 
alone 
might 
suffice 
to 
repress 
and 
moderate 
the 
excessive 
liberty, 
which 
some 
think 
that 
they 
may 
assume 
to 
themselves: 
Plerumque 
enim 
accidit, 
ut 
aliquid 
de 
Terra, 
de 
Celo, 
de 
ceteris 
hujus 
mundi 
elementis, 
de 
motu, 
conversione, 
vel 
etiam 
magnitudine 
& 
intervallis 
Syderum, 
de 
certis 
defectibus 
Solis, 
& 
Lunae, 
de 
eircuitibus 
annorum 
& 
temporum; 
de 
Naturis 
animalium, 
fruticum, 
lapidum, 
atque 
hujusmodi 
ceteris, 
etiam 
non 
Christianus 
ita 
noverit, 
ut 
cirtissima 
ratione 
vel 
experientiâ 
teneat. 
Turpe 
autem 
est 
nimis 
& 
perniciosum, 
ac 
maxime 
cavendum, 
ut 
Christianum 
de 
his 
rebus 
quasi 
secundum 
Christianas 
litteras 
loquentem, 
ita 
delirare 
quilibet 
infidelis 
audiat, 
ut, 
quem 
admodum 
dicitur, 
toto 
Caelo 
errare 
conspiciens, 



risu¯tenere 
vix 
possit: 
& 
non 
tam 
molestum 
est, 
quod 
errans 
homo 
derideretur, 
sed 
quod 
auctores 
nostri, 
ab 
tis 
qui 
foris 
sunt, 
talia 
sensisse 
creduntur, 
& 
cum 
magno 
exitio 
corim, 
de 
quorum 
salute 
satagimus, 
tanquam 
indocti 
reprehenduntur 
atque 
respuuntur. 
Cum 
enim 
quemquam 
de 
numero 
Christianorum 
eai 
[...]re, 
quam 
ipsi 
optime 
norunt, 
deprehenderint, 
& 
vanam 
sententiam 
suam 
de 
nostris 
libris 
asserent; 
quo 
pacto 
illis 
Libris 
credituri 
sunt, 
de 
Resurrectione 
Mortuorum, 
& 
de 
spe 
vitae 
eternae, 
Regnoque 
Celorum; 
quando 
de 
his 
rebus 
quas 
jam 
experiri, 
vel 
indubitatis 
rationibus 
percipere 
potuerunt, 
fallaciter 
putaverint 
esse 
conscriptos. 
For 
it 
many 
times 
falls 
out, 
that 
a 
Christian 
may 
not 
so 
fully 
understand 
a 
Point 
concerning 
the 
Earth, 
Heaven, 
and 
the 
rest 
of 
this 
Worlds 
Elements; 
the 
Motion, 
Conversion, 
Magnitude, 
and 
Distances 
of 
the 
Stars, 
the 
certain 
defects 
of 
the 
Sun 
and 
Moon, 
the 
Revolutions 
of 
Years 
and 
Times, 
the 
Nature 
of 
Animals, 
Fruits, 
Stones, 
andother 
things 
of 
like 
nature, 
as 
to 
defendthe 
same 
by 
rightReason, 
or 
make 
it 
out 
by 
Experiments. 
But 
its 
too 
great 
an 
absurdity, 
yea 
most 
pernicious, 
and 
chiefly 
to 
be 
avoided, 
to 
let 
an 
Infidel 
finde 
a 
Christian 
so 
stupid, 
that 
he 
should 
argue 
these 
matters; 
as 
if 
they 
were 
according 
to 
Christian 
Doctrine; 
and 
make 
him 
(as 
the 
Proverb 
saith) 
scarce 
able 
to 
contain 
his 
laughter, 
seeing 
him 
so 
far 
from 
the 
Mark. 
Nor 
is 
the 
matter 
so 
much 
that 
one 
in 
an 
errour 
should 
be 
laught 
at, 
but 
that 
our 
Authors 
should 
be 
thought 
by 
them 
that 
are 
without, 
to 
be 
of 
the 
same 
Opinion, 
and 
to 
the 
great 
prejudice 
of 
those, 
whose 
salvation 
we 
wait 
for, 
sensured 
and 
rejected 
as 
unlearned. 
For 
when 
they 
shal 
confute 
any 
one 
of 
the 
Christians 
in 
that 
matter, 
vvhich 
they 
themselvs 
thorovvly 
understand, 
and 
shall 
thereupon 
express 
their 
light 
esteem 
of 
our 
Books; 
hovv 
shall 
these 
Volumes 
be 
believed 
touching 
the 
Resurrection 
of 
the 
Dead, 
the 
Hope 
of 
eternal 
Life, 
and 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
Heaven; 
vvhen, 
as 
to 
these 
Points 
vvhich 
admit 
of 
present 
Demonstration, 
or 
undoubted 
Reasons, 
they 
conceive 
them 
to 
be 
falsly 
vvritten. 


And 
how 
much 
the 
truly 
Wise 
and 
Prudent 
Fathers 
are 
displeased 
with 
these 
men, 
who 
in 
defence 
of 
Propositions 
which 
they 
do 
not 
understand, 
do 
apply, 
and 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
pawn 
Texts 
of 
Scripture, 
and 
afterwards 
go 
on 
to 
encrease 
their 
first 
Errour, 
by 
producing 
other 
places 
less 
understood 
than 
the 
former. 
The 
same 
Saint 
declareth 
in 
the 
expressions 
following: 
Quid 
enim 
molestiae, 
tristiaeque 
ingerant 
prudentibus 
fratribus, 
tenerar 
[...]j 
praesumpiores, 
satis 
dici 
non 
potest, 
cum, 
si 
quando 
de 
falsa 
& 
prava 
opinione 
sua 
reprehendi 
& 
convinci 
caeperint, 
ab 
iis 
qui 
nostrorum 
librorum 



auctoritate, 
& 
apertissima 
falsitate 
dixerunt, 
eosdnm 
libros 
Sanctos, 
unde 
id 
probent, 
proferre 
conantur; 
vel 
etiam 
memoriter, 
quae 
ad 
testimonium 
v 
[...]lere 
arbitrantur, 
multa 
inde 
verba 
pronunciant, 
non 
intelligentes, 
neque 
quae 
loquuntur, 
neque 
de 
quibus 
affirmant. 
What 
trouble 
and 
sorrow 
weak 
undertakers 
bring 
upon 
their 
knowing 
Brethren, 
is 
not 
to 
be 
expressed; 
since 
vvhen 
they 
begin 
to 
be 
told 
and 
convinced 
of 
their 
false 
and 
unsound 
Opinion,by 
those 
vvhohave 
no 
respectfor 
theAuthority 
of 
our 
Scriptures, 
in 
defence 
of 
vvhat 
through 
a 
fond 
Temerity, 
and 
most 
manifest 
falsity, 
they 
have 
urged; 
they 
fall 
to 
citing 
the 
said 
Sacred 
Books 
for 
proof 
of 
it, 
or 
else 
repeat 
many 
vvords 
by 
heart 
out 
of 
them, 
vvhich 
they 
conceive 
to 
make 
for 
theirpurpose;notknovvingeitherwhattheysay,or 
vvhereoftheyaffirm. 


In 
the 
number 
of 
these 
we 
may, 
as 
I 
conceive, 
account 
those, 
who, 
being 
either 
unwilling 
or 
unable 
to 
understand 
the 
Demonstrations 
and 
Experiments, 
wherewith 
the 
Author 
and 
followers 
of 
this 
Opinion 
do 
confirm 
it, 
run 
upon 
all 
occasions 
to 
the 
Scriptures, 
not 
considering 
that 
the 
more 
they 
cite 
them, 
and 
the 
more 
they 
persist 
in 
affirming 
that 
they 
are 
very 
clear, 
and 
do 
admit 
no 
other 
senses, 
save 
those 
which 
they 
force 
upon 
them, 
the 
greater 
injury 
they 
do 
to 
the 
Dignity 
of 
them 
(if 
we 
allowed 
that 
their 
judgments 
were 
of 
any 
great 
Authority) 
in 
case 
that 
the 
Truth 
coming 
to 
be 
manifestly 
known 
to 
the 
contrary, 
should 
occasion 
any 
confusion, 
at 
least 
to 
those 
who 
are 
separated 
from 
the 
Holy 
Church; 
of 
whom 
yet 
she 
is 
very 
solicitous, 
and 
like 
a 
tender 
Mother, 
desirous 
to 
recover 
them 
again 
into 
her 
Lap 
Your 
Highness 
therefore 
may 
see 
how 
praeposterously 
those 
Persons 
proceed, 
who 
in 
Natural 
Disputations 
do 
range 
Texts 
of 
Scripture 
in 
the 
Front 
for 
their 
Arguments; 
and 
such 
Texts 
too 
many 
times, 
as 
are 
but 
superficially 
understood 
bythem. 


But 
if 
these 
men 
do 
verily 
think, 
& 
absolutely 
believe 
that 
they 
have 
the 
true 
sence 
of 
Such 
a 
particular 
place 
of 
Scripture, 
it 
must 
needs 
follow 
of 
consequence, 
that 
they 
do 
likewise 
hold 
for, 
certain, 
that 
they 
have 
found 
the 
absolute 
truth 
of 
that 
Natural 
Conclusion, 
which 
they 
intend 
to 
dispute: 
And 
that 
withal, 
they 
do 
knowthatthey 
have 
a 
greatadvantage 
of 
theirAdversary, 
whose 
Lot 
it 
is 
to 
defend 
the 
part 
that 
is 
false; 
in 
regard 
that 
he 
who 
maintaineth 
the 
Truth, 
may 
have 
many 
sensible 
experiments, 
and 
many 
necessary 
Demonstrations 
on 
his 
side; 
whereas 
his 
Antagonist 
can 
make 
use 
of 
no 
other 
than 
deceitful 
appearances, 
Paralogisms 
and 
Sophisms. 
Now 
if 
they 
keeping 
within 
natural 
bounds, 
& 
producing 
no 
other 
Weapons 
but 
those 
of 
Philosophy, 
pretend 
however, 
to 
have 
so 
much 
advantage 
of 
their 
Enemy; 



why 
do 
they 
afterwards 
in 
coming 
to 
engage, 
presently 
betake 
themselves 
to 
a 
Weapon 
inevitable 
& 
dreadful 
to 
terrifie 
their 
Opponent 
with 
the 
sole 
beholding 
of 
it? 
But 
if 
I 
may 
speak 
the 
truth, 
I 
believe 
that 
they 
are 
the 
first 
that 
are 
affrighted, 
and 
that 
perceiving 
themselves 
unable 
to 
bear 
up 
against 
the 
assaults 
of 
theit 
Adversary, 
go 
about 
to 
find 
out 
ways 
how 
to 
keep 
them 
far 
enough 
off, 
forbidding 
unto 
them 
the 
use 
of 
the 
Reason 
which 
the 
Divine 
Bounty 
had 
vouchsafed 
them, 
& 
abusing 
the 
most 
equitable 
Authority 
of 
sacred 
Scripture, 
which 
rightly 
understood 
and 
applyed, 
can 
never, 
according 
to 
the 
common 
Maxime 
of 
Divines, 
oppose 
the 
Manifest 
Experiments, 
or 
Necessary 
Demonstrations. 
But 
these 
mens 
running 
to 
the 
Scriptures 
for 
a 
Cloak 
to 
their 
inability 
to 
comprehend, 
not 
to 
say 
resolve 
the 
Reasons 
alledged 
against 
them, 
ought 
(if 
I 
be 
not 
mistaken) 
to 
stand 
them 
in 
no 
stead: 
the 
Opinion 
which 
they 
oppose 
having 
never 
as 
yet 
been 
condemned 
by 
Holy 
Church. 
So 
that 
if 
they 
would 
proceed 
with 
Candor, 
they 
should 
either 
by 
silence 
confess 
themselves 
unable 
to 
handle 
such 
like 
points, 
or 
first 
consider 
that 
it 
is 
not 
in 
the 
power 
of 
them 
or 
others,If 
this 
passage 
seem 
harsh, 
the 
Reader 
must 
remember 
that 
I 
do 
but 
Translate. 
but 
onely 
in 
that 
of 
the 
Pope, 
and 
of 
Sacred 
Councils 
to 
censure 
a 
Position 
to 
be 
Erroneous: 
But 
that 
it 
is 
left 
to 
their 
freedome 
to 
dispute 
concerning 
its 
falsity. 
And 
thereupon, 
knowing 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
a 
Proposition 
should 
at 
the 
same 
time 
be 
True 
and 
Heretical; 
they 
ought, 
I 
say, 
to 
imploy 
themselves 
in 
that 
work 
which 
is 
most 
proper 
to 
them, 
namely, 
in 
demonstrating 
the 
falsity 
thereof: 
whereby 
they 
may 
see 
how 
needlesse 
the 
prohibiting 
of 
it 
is, 
its 
falshood 
being 
once 
discovered, 
for 
that 
none 
would 
follow 
it: 
or 
the 
Prohibition 
would 
be 
safe, 
and 
without 
all 
danger 
of 
Scandal. 
Therefore 
first 
let 
these 
men 
apply 
themselves 
to 
examine 
the 
Arguments 
of 
Copernicus 
and 
others; 
and 
leave 
the 
condemning 
of 
them 
for 
Erroneous 
and 
Heretical 
to 
whom 
it 
belongeth: 
But 
yet 
let 
them 
not 
hope 
ever 
to 
finde 
such 
rash 
and 
precipitous 
Determinations 
in 
the 
Wary 
and 
Holy 
Fathers, 
or 
in 
the 
absolute 
Wisdome 
of 
him 
that 
cannot 
erre, 
as 
those 
into 
which 
they 
suffer 
themselves 
to 
be 
hurried 
by 
some 
particular 
Affection 
or 
Interest 
of 
their 
own. 
In 
these 
and 
such 
other 
Positions, 
which 
are 
not 
directly 
de 
Fide, 
certainly 
no 
man 
doubts 
but 
His 
Holiness 
hath 
alwayes 
an 
absolute 
power 
of 
Admitting 
or 
Condemning 
them, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
in 
the 
power 
of 
any 
Creature 
to 
make 
them 
to 
be 
true 
or 
false, 
otherwisethanoftheirownnature,anddefactotheyare. 


Therefore 
it 
is 
in 
my 
judgment 
more 
discretion 
to 
assure 
us 
first 
of 
the 
necessary 
and 
immutable 
Truth 
of 
the 
Fact, 
(over 
which 
none 
hath 
power) 



than 
without 
that 
certainty 
by 
condemning 
one 
part 
to 
deprive 
ones 
self 
of 
that 
authority 
of 
freedome 
to 
elect, 
making 
those 
Determinations 
to 
become 
necessary, 
which 
at 
present 
are 
indifferent 
and 
arbitrary, 
and 
rest 
in 
the 
will 
of 
Supreme 
Authority. 
And 
in 
a 
word, 
if 
it 
be 
not 
possible 
that 
a 
Conclusion 
should 
be 
declared 
Heretical, 
whilst 
we 
are 
not 
certain, 
but 
that 
it 
may 
be 
true, 
their 
pains 
are 
in 
vain 
who 
pretend 
to 
condemn 
the 
Mobility 
of 
the 
Earth 
and 
Stability 
of 
the 
Sun, 
unlesse 
they 
have 
first 
demonstrated 
it 
to 
be 
impossible 
andfalse. 


It 
remaineth 
now, 
that 
we 
consider 
whether 
it 
be 
true, 
that 
the 
Place 
in 
Joshuah 
may 
be 
taken 
without 
altering 
the 
pure 
signification 
of 
the 
words: 
and 
how 
it 
can 
be 
that 
the 
Sun, 
obeying 
the 
command 
of 
Joshuah, 
which 
was, 
That 
it 
should 
stand 
still, 
the 
day 
might 
thereupon 
be 
much 
lengthened. 
Which 
businesse, 
if 
the 
Celestial 
Motions 
be 
taken 
according 
to 
the 
Ptolomaick 
Systeme, 
can 
never 
any 
wayes 
happen, 
for 
that 
the 
Sun 
moving 
thorow 
the 
Ecliptick, 
according 
to 
the 
order 
of 
the 
Signes, 
which 
is 
from 
East 
to 
West 
(which 
is 
that 
which 
maketh 
Day 
and 
Night) 
it 
is 
a 
thing 
manifest, 
that 
the 
Sun 
ceasing 
its 
true 
and 
proper 
Motion, 
the 
day 
would 
become 
shorter 
and 
not 
longer; 
and 
that 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
way 
to 
lengthen 
it 
would 
be 
to 
hasten 
and 
velocitate 
the 
Suns 
motion; 
insomuch 
that 
to 
cause 
the 
Sun 
to 
stay 
above 
the 
Horizon 
for 
some 
time, 
in 
one 
and 
the 
same 
place, 
without 
declining 
towards 
the 
West, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
accelerate 
its 
motion 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
as 
that 
it 
might 
seem 
equal 
to 
that 
of 
the 
Primum 
Mobile, 
which 
would 
be 
an 
accelerating 
it 
about 
three 
hundred 
and 
sixty 
times 
more 
than 
ordinary. 
If 
therefore 
Joshuah 
had 
had 
an 
intention 
that 
his 
words 
should 
be 
taken 
in 
their 
pure 
and 
proper 
signification, 
he 
would 
have 
bid 
the 
Sun 
to 
have 
accelerated 
its 
Motion 
so, 
that 
the 
Rapture 
of 
the 
Primum 
Mobile 
might 
not 
carry 
it 
to 
the 
West: 
but 
because 
his 
words 
were 
heard 
by 
people 
which 
haply 
knew 
no 
other 
Celestial 
Motion, 
save 
this 
grand 
and 
common 
one, 
from 
East 
to 
West, 
stooping 
to 
their 
Capacity, 
and 
having 
no 
intention 
to 
teach 
them 
the 
Constitution 
of 
the 
Spheres, 
but 
only 
that 
they 
should 
perceive 
the 
greatness 
of 
the 
Miracle 
wrought, 
in 
the 
lengthening 
of 
the 
Day, 
he 
spoke 
according 
to 
their 
apprehension. 
Possibly 
this 
Consideration 
moved 
Dionysius 
Areopagita 
to 
say 
that 
in 
this 
Miracle 
the 
Primum 
Mobile 
stood 
still, 
and 
this 
stopping, 
all 
the 
Celestial 
Spheres 
did 
of 
consequence 
stay: 
of 
which 
opinion 
is 
S. 
Augustine 
himself, 
and 
Abulensis 
at 
large 
confirmeth 
it. 
Yea, 
that 
Joshua’s 
intention 
was, 
that 
the 
whole 
Systeme 
of 
the 
Celestial 
Spheresshouldstand 
still, 
is 
collected 
fromthe 
command 
he 
gave 
atthe 
same 



time 
to 
the 
Moon, 
although 
that 
it 
had 
nothing 
to 
do 
in 
the 
lengthening 
of 
the 
day; 
and 
under 
the 
injunction 
laid 
upon 
the 
Moon, 
we 
are 
to 
understand 
the 
Orbes 
of 
all 
the 
other 
Planets, 
passed 
over 
in 
silence 
here, 
as 
also 
in 
all 
other 
places 
of 
the 
Sacred 
Scriptures; 
the 
intention 
of 
which, 
was 
not 
to 
teach 
us 
theAstronomicalSciences. 
I 
suppose 
therefore,(ifIbenotdeceived)that 
itis 
very 
plain, 
that 
if 
we 
allow 
the 
Ptolemaick 
Systeme, 
we 
must 
of 
necessity 
interpret 
the 
words 
to 
some 
sense 
different 
from 
their 
strict 
signification. 
Which 
Interpretation 
(being 
admonished 
by 
the 
most 
usefull 
precepts 
of 
S. 
Augustine) 
I 
will 
not 
affirm 
to 
be 
of 
necessity 
this 
above-mentioned, 
since 
that 
some 
other 
man 
may 
haply 
think 
of 
some 
other 
more 
proper, 
and 
more 
agreeableSense. 


But 
now, 
if 
this 
same 
passage 
may 
be 
understood 
in 
the 
Copernican 
Systeme, 
to 
agree 
better 
with 
what 
we 
read 
in 
Joshuah, 
with 
the 
help 
of 
another 
Observation 
by 
me 
newly 
shewen 
in 
the 
Body 
of 
the 
Sun; 
I 
will 
propound 
it 
to 
consideration, 
speaking 
alwaies 
with 
those 
safe 
Reserves; 
That 
I 
am 
not 
so 
affectionate 
to 
my 
own 
inventions, 
as 
to 
prefer 
them 
before 
those 
of 
other 
men, 
and 
to 
believe 
that 
better 
and 
more 
agreeable 
to 
the 
intention 
of 
theSacredVolumescannotbeproduced. 


Supposing 
therefore 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
that 
in 
the 
Miracle 
of 
Joshuah, 
the 
whole 
Systeme 
of 
the 
Celestial 
Revolutions 
stood 
still, 
according 
to 
the 
judgement 
of 
the 
afore-named 
Authors: 
And 
this 
is 
the 
rather 
to 
be 
admitted, 
to 
the 
end, 
that 
by 
the 
staying 
of 
one 
alone, 
all 
the 
Constitutions 
might 
not 
be 
confounded, 
and 
a 
great 
disorder 
needlesly 
introduced 
in 
the 
whole 
course 
of 
Nature: 
I 
come 
in 
the 
second 
place 
to 
consider 
how 
the 
Solar 
Body, 
although 
stable 
in 
one 
constant 
place, 
doth 
nevertheless 
revolve 
in 
it 
self, 
making 
an 
entire 
Conversion 
in 
the 
space 
of 
a 
Month, 
or 
thereabouts; 
as 
I 
conceive 
I 
have 
solidly 
demonstrated 
in 
my 
Letters 
Delle 
Machie 
Solari: 
Which 
motion 
we 
sensibly 
see 
to 
be 
in 
the 
upper 
part 
of 
its 
Globe, 
inclined 
towards 
the 
South; 
and 
thence 
towards 
the 
lower 
part, 
to 
encline 
towards 
the 
North, 
just 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
all 
the 
other 
Orbs 
of 
the 
Planets 
do. 
Thirdly, 
If 
we 
respect 
the 
Nobility 
of 
the 
Sun, 
and 
his 
being 
the 
Fountain 
of 
Light, 
by 
which, 
(as 
I 
necessarily 
demonstrate) 
not 
onely 
the 
Moon 
and 
Earth, 
but 
all 
the 
other 
Planets 
(all 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
dark 
of 
themselves) 
become 
illuminated; 
I 
conceive 
that 
it 
will 
be 
no 
unlogicall 
Illation 
to 
say, 
That 
it, 
as 
the 
Grand 
Minister 
of 
Nature, 
and 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
the 
Soul 
and 
Heart 
of 
the 
World, 
infuseth 
into 
the 
other 
Bodies 
which 
environ 
it; 
not 
onely 
Light, 
but 
Motion 
also; 
by 
revolving 
[...] 
On 
its 
own 
Axis. 
in 
it 
self: 
So 
that 
in 
the 
same 



manner 
that 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Heart 
of 
an 
Animal 
ceasing, 
all 
the 
other 
motions 
of 
its 
Members 
would 
cease; 
so, 
the 
Conversion 
of 
the 
Sun 
ceasing, 
[...] 
Conversions 
of 
all 
the 
Planets 
would 
stand 
still. 
And 
though 
I 
could 
produce 
the 
testimonies 
of 
many 
grave 
Writers 
to 
prove 
the 
admirable 
power 
and 
influence 
of 
the 
Sun, 
I 
will 
content 
my 
self 
with 
one 
sole 
place 
of 
Holy 
Dionisius 
Areopagita 
in 
his 
Book 
de 
Divinis 
Nominibus; 
who 
thus 
writes 
of 
the 
Sun:Lux 
ejus 
colligit, 
convertitque 
ad 
se 
omnia, 
quae 
videntur, 
quae 
moventur, 
quae 
illustrantur, 
quae 
calescunt, 
& 
uno 
nomine 
ea, 
quae 
ab 
ejus 
splendore 
continentur. 
Itaque 
Sol 
[...] 
dicitur, 
quod 
omnia 
congreget, 
colligatque 
dispersa. 
His 
Light 
gathereth 
and 
converts 
all 
things 
to 
himself, 
which 
are 
seen, 
moved, 
illustrated, 
wax 
hot, 
and 
(in 
a 
word) 
those 
things 
which 
arepreserved 
by 
his 
splendor: 
Wherefore 
the 
Suniscalled[...],for 
that 
he 
collecteth 
and 
gathereth 
together 
all 
things 
dispersed. 
And 
a 
little 
after 
of 
the 
Sun 
again 
he 
adds;Si 
enim 
Sol 
hic 
quem 
videmus, 
eorum 
quae 
sub 
sensum 
cadunt, 
essentias 
& 
qualitates, 
quaeque 
multa 
sint 
ac 
dissimiles, 
tamen 
ipse 
qui 
unus 
est, 
aequaliterque 
lumen 
fundit, 
renovat, 
alit, 
tuetur, 
perficit, 
dividit, 
conjungit, 
fovet, 
faecunda 
reddit, 
auget, 
mutat, 
firmat 
edit, 
movet, 
vitalia 
(que) 
facit 
omnia: 
& 
unaqua 
(que) 
res 
hujus 
universitatis, 
pro 
captu 
suo, 
unius 
atque 
ejusdem 
Solis 
est 
particeps, 
causasque 
multorum, 
quae 
participent, 
in 
se 
aequabiliter 
anticipatas 
habet, 
certe 
majori 
raticne, 
&c. 
If 
this 
Sun 
which 
we 
see, 
as 
touching 
the 
Essences 
and 
Qualities 
of 
those 
things 
which 
fall 
vvithin 
our 
Sense, 
being 
very 
many 
and 
different; 
yet 
if 
he 
vvho 
is 
one, 
and 
equally 
bestovves 
his 
Light, 
doth 
renew, 
nourish, 
defend, 
perfect, 
divide, 
conjoyn, 
cherish, 
make 
fruitfull, 
encrease, 
change, 
fix, 
produce, 
move, 
and 
fashion 
all 
living 
creatures: 
And 
every 
thing 
in 
this 
Vniverse 
at 
this 
Pleasure, 
is 
partaker 
of 
one 
and 
the 
same 
Sun; 
and 
the 
causes 
of 
many 
things 
which 
participate 
of 
him, 
are 
equally 
auticipated 
in 
him: 
Certainly 
by 
greater 
reason; 
&c. 
The 
Sun 
therefore 
being 
the 
Fountain 
of 
Light 
and, 
Principle 
of 
Motion, 
God 
intending, 
that 
at 
the 
Command 
of 
Joshua, 
all 
the 
Worlds 
Systeme, 
should 
continue 
many 
hours 
in 
the 
same 
state, 
it 
sufficeth 
to 
make 
the 
Sun 
stand 
still, 
upon 
whose 
stay 
(all 
the 
other 
Conversions 
ceasing) 
the 
Earth, 
the 
Moon, 
the 
Sun 
did 
abide 
in 
the 
same 
Constitution 
as 
before, 
as 
likewise 
all 
the 
other 
Planets: 
Nor 
in 
all 
that 
time 
did 
the 
Day 
decline 
towards 
Night, 
but 
it 
was 
miraculously 
prolonged: 
And 
in 
this 
manner, 
upon 
the 
standing 
still 
of 
the 
Sun, 
without 
altering, 
or 
in 
the 
least 
disturbing 
the 
other 
Aspects 
and 
mutual 
Positions 
of 
the 
Stars, 
the 
Day 
might 
be 
lengthned 
on 
Earth;whichexactlyagreethwiththeLitteralsenseoftheSacredText. 



But 
that 
of 
which, 
if 
I 
be 
not 
mistaken, 
we 
are 
to 
make 
no 
small 
account, 
is, 
That 
by 
help 
of 
this 
Copernican 
Hypothesis, 
we 
have 
the 
Litteral, 
apert, 
and 
Natural 
Sense 
of 
another 
particular 
that 
we 
read 
of 
in 
the 
same 
Miracle; 
which 
is, 
That 
the 
Sun 
stood 
still 
in 
Medio 
Caeli: 
Upon 
which 
passage 
grave 
Divines 
raise 
many 
questions, 
in 
regard 
it 
seemeth 
very 
probable, 
That 
when 
Joshuah 
desired 
the 
lengthning 
of 
the 
Day, 
the 
Sun 
was 
near 
setting, 
and 
not 
in 
the 
Meridian; 
for 
if 
it 
had 
been 
in 
the 
Meridian, 
it 
being 
then 
about 
the 
Summer 
Solstice, 
and 
consequently 
the 
dayes 
being 
at 
the 
longest, 
it 
doth 
not 
seem 
likely 
that 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
pray 
for 
the 
lengthning 
of 
the 
day, 
to 
prosecute 
Victory 
in 
a 
Battail, 
the 
space 
of 
seven 
hours 
and 
more, 
which 
remained 
to 
Night, 
being 
sufficient 
for 
that 
purpose. 
Upon 
which 
Grave 
Divines 
have 
been 
induced 
to 
think 
that 
the 
Sun 
was 
near 
setting: 
And 
so 
the 
words 
themselves 
seem 
to 
sound, 
saying, 
Ne 
movearis 
Sol, 
ne 
movearis. 
For 
if 
it 
had 
been 
in 
the 
Meridian, 
either 
it 
had 
been 
needless 
to 
have 
asked 
a 
Mircale, 
or 
it 
would 
have 
been 
sufficient 
to 
have 
onely 
praid 
for 
some 
retardment. 
Of 
this 
opinion 
is 
Cajetan, 
to 
which 
subscribeth 
Magaglianes, 
confirming 
it 
by 
saying, 
that 
Joshua 
had 
that 
very 
day 
done 
so 
many 
other 
things 
before 
his 
commanding 
the 
Sun, 
as 
were 
not 
possibly 
to 
be 
dispatch’t 
in 
half 
a 
day. 
Whereupon 
they 
are 
forced 
to 
read 
the 
Words 
in 
Medio 
Coeli 
(to 
confess 
the 
truth) 
with 
a 
little 
harshness, 
saying 
that 
they 
import 
no 
more 
than 
this: 
That 
the 
Sun 
stood 
still, 
being 
in 
our 
Hemisphere, 
Solem 
stetisse, 
dum 
adhuc 
in 
Hemisphaerio 
nostro, 
supra 
scilicet 
Horizontem 
existeret. 
Cajetan 
in 
loco. 
that 
is, 
above 
the 
Horizon. 
But 
(if 
I 
do 
not 
erre) 
we 
shall 
avoid 
that 
and 
all 
other 
harsh 
expositions, 
if 
according 
to 
the 
Copernican 
Systeme 
we 
place 
the 
Sun 
in 
the 
midst, 
that 
is, 
in 
the 
Centre 
of 
the 
Coelestial 
Orbes, 
and 
of 
the 
Planetary 
Conversions, 
as 
it 
is 
most 
requisite 
to 
do. 
For 
supposing 
any 
hour 
of 
the 
day 
(either 
Noon, 
or 
any 
other, 
as 
you 
shall 
please 
neerer 
to 
the 
Evening) 
the 
Day 
was 
lengthened, 
and 
all 
the 
Coelestial 
Revolutions 
stayed 
by 
the 
Suns 
standing 
still, 
In 
the 
midst, 
that 
is, 
in 
the 
Centre 
of 
Heaven, 
where 
it 
resides: 
A 
Sense 
so 
much 
the 
more 
accomodate 
to 
the 
Letter 
(besides 
what 
hath 
been 
said 
already) 
in 
that, 
if 
the 
Text 
had 
desired 
to 
have 
affirmed 
the 
Suns 
Rest 
to 
have 
been 
caused 
at 
Noon-day, 
the 
proper 
expression 
of 
it 
had 
been 
to 
say, 
It 
stood 
still 
at 
Noon-day, 
or 
in 
the 
Meridian 
Circle, 
and 
not 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
Heaven: 
In 
regard 
that 
the 
true 
and 
onlyMiddle 
ofa 
SphericalBody(as 
isHeaven)istheCentre. 


Again, 
as 
to 
other 
places 
of 
Scripture, 
which 
seem 
contrary 
to 
this 
position, 
I 
do 
not 
doubt 
but 
that 
if 
it 
were 
acknowledged 
for 
True 
and 



Demonstrated 
those 
very 
Divines 
who 
so 
long 
as 
they 
repute 
it 
false, 
hold 
those 
places 
incapable 
of 
Expositions 
that 
agree 
with 
it 
would 
finde 
such 
Interpretations 
for 
them, 
as 
should 
very 
well 
suit 
therewith; 
and 
especially 
if 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
Divine 
Learning 
they 
would 
but 
adde 
some 
knowledge 
of 
the 
Astronomical 
Sciences: 
And 
as 
at 
present, 
whilst 
they 
deem 
it 
false 
they 
think 
they 
meet 
in 
Scripture 
only 
with 
such 
places 
as 
make 
against 
it, 
if 
they 
shall 
but 
once 
have 
entertained 
another 
conceipt 
thereof, 
they 
would 
meet 
peradventure 
as 
many 
others 
that 
accord 
with 
it, 
and 
haply 
would 
judge, 
that 
the 
Holy 
Church 
doth 
very 
appositly 
teach, 
That 
God 
placed 
the 
Sun 
in 
the 
Centre 
of 
Heaven, 
and 
that 
thereupon 
by 
revolving 
it 
in 
it

DISCOURSE 
ON 
FLOATING 
BODIES 



Translated 
by 
Thomas 
Salusbury 


At 
a 
dinner 
held 
by 
Cosimo 
II 
de’ 
Medici, 
the 
Grand 
Duke 
of 
Tuscany, 
Galileo 
discussed 
with, 
inter 
alia, 
Lodovico 
delle 
Columbe 
(an 
Aristotelian 
physicist, 
with 
views 
diametrically 
opposed 
to 
those 
of 
Galileo) 
the 
subjects 
of 
floating 
bodies 
and 
buoyancy. 
It 
was 
a 
classical 
encounter 
of 
scientific 
analysis 
opposed 
against 
philosophical 
principles, 
and 
Galileo 
won 
the 
day. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
this 
debate, 
Galileo 
published 
an 
account, 
encouraged 
by 
and 
dedicated 
to 
the 
Grand 
Duke 
of 
Tuscany. 
This 
interesting 
volume 
was 
published 
in 
1612. 
Although 
often 
abbreviated 
to 
Discourse 
on 
Floating 
Bodies, 
its 
Italian 
title 
(and 
its 
publication 
in 
Italian 
rather 
than 
Latin 
made 
clear 
its 
general 
audience) 
was 
Discorso 
intorno 
alle 
cose, 
che 
Stanno 
in 
sù 
l’acqua, 
ò 
che 
in 
quella 
si 
muovono, 
which 
more 
literally 
translates 
as 
Discourse 
on 
Bodies 
that 
Stay 
atop 
Water, 
or 
Move 
in 
It. 
The 
first 
edition 
sold 
out 
almost 
immediately, 
and 
a 
second 
edition 
appeared 
in 
the 
same 
year 
(see 
Figure 
1). 
Within 
the 
text, 
Galileo’s 
views 
on 
sunspots 
and 
some 
of 
the 
planets 
(especially 
Venus, 
Jupiter 
and 
Saturn) 
were 
also 
mentioned. 
Thus 
Galileo 
again 
challenged 
the 
accepted 
Aristotelian 
view, 
pioneering 
the 
now 
accepted 
scientific 
methodology 
that 
practical 
experimental 
observations 
and 
mathematicalanalysiswereparamount 
whenweighedagainstunsubstantiated 
arguments: 
that 
empirical 
data, 
logically 
analysed, 
count 
more 
than 
philosophicalspeculation. 


Although 
this 
is 
an 
important 
work 
in 
Galileo’s 
development 
and 
his 
relationship 
with 
the 
authorities, 
it 
is 
not 
an 
easy 
read 
– 
which 
is 
not 
helped 
by 
a 
rather 
clumsy 
translation. 
A 
sense 
of 
this 
can 
be 
gained 
from 
the 
final 
sentence: 
“And 
this 
is 
the 
only 
true 
proper 
and 
absolute 
Cause 
of 
Natation 
and 
Submersion, 
so 
that 
nothing 
else 
hath 
part 
therein: 
and 
the 
Board 
of 
the 
Adversaries 
swimmeth, 
when 
it 
is 
conjoined 
with 
as 
much 
Air, 
as, 
together 
with 
it, 
doth 
form 
a 
Body 
less 
grave 
than 
so 
much 
water 
as 
would 
fill 
the 
place 
that 
the 
said 
Compound 
occupies 
in 
the 
water; 
but 
when 
they 
shall 
demit 
the 
simple 
Ebony 
into 
the 
water, 
according 
to 
the 
Tenor

CONCERNING

(Most

that 
the

of 
so 
different 
an 
Argument 
from

which 
many 
expect, 
and 
which 
according 
to 
the 
intentions 
I 
proposed 
in 
my 
A 
Astronomicall 
Adviso, 
I 
should 
before 
this 
time 
have 
put 
forth, 
might 
peradventure 
make 
some 
thinke, 
either 
that 
I 
had 
wholly 
relinquished 
my 
farther 
imployment 
about 
the 
new 
Celestiall 
Observations, 
or 
that, 
at 
least, 
I 
handled 
them 
very 
remissely; 
I 
have 
judged 
fit 
to 
render 
an 
account, 
aswell 
of 
my 
deferring 
that, 
as 
of 
my

and 
publishingthis

As 
to 
the 
first, 
the 
last 
discoveries 
of 
Saturn 
to 
be 
tricorporeall, 
and 
of 
the 
mutationsofFigurein 
Venus, 
like 
to 
those 
that 
are 
seen 
in 
the 
Moon, 
together 
with 
the 
Consequents 
depending 
thereupon, 
have 
not 
so 
much 
occasioned 
the 
demur, 
as 
the 
investigation 
of 
the 
times 
of 
the 
Conversions 
of 
each 
of 
the 
Four 
Medicean 
Planets 
about 
Jupiter, 
which 
I 
lighted 
upon 
in 
April 
the 
year 
past, 
1611, 
at 
my 
being 
in 
Rome; 
where, 
in 
the 
end, 
I 
assertained 
my 
selfe, 
that 
the 
first 
and 
neerest 
to 
Jupiter, 
moved 
about 
8 
gr. 
& 
29 
m. 
of 
its 
Sphere 
in 
an 
houre, 
makeing 
its 
whole 
revolution 
in 
one 
naturall 
day, 
and 
18 
hours, 
and 
almost 
an 
halfe. 
The 
second 
moves 
in 
its 
Orbe 
14 
gr. 
13 
min. 
or 
very 
neer, 
in 
an 
hour, 
and 
its 
compleat 
conversion 
is 
consummate 
in 
3 
dayes, 
13 
hours, 
and 
one 
third, 
or 
thereabouts. 
The 
third 
passeth 
in 
an 
hour, 
2 
gr. 
6 
min. 
little 
more 
or 
less 
of 
its 
Circle, 
and 
measures 
it 
all 
in 
7 
dayes, 
4 
hours, 
or 
very 
neer. 
The 
fourth, 
and 
more 
remote 
than 
the 
rest, 
goes 
in 
one 
houre, 
0 
gr 
54 
min. 
and 
almost 
an 
halfe 
of 
its 
Sphere, 
and 
finisheth 
it 
all 
in 
16 
dayes, 
and 
very 
neer 
18 
hours. 
But 
because 
the 
excessive 
velocity 
of 
their 
returns 
or 
restitutions, 
requires 
a 
most 
scrupulous 
precisenesse 
to 
calculate 
their 
places, 



in 
times 
past 
and 
future, 
especially 
if 
the 
time 
be 
for 
many 
Moneths 
or 
Years; 
I 
am 
therefore 
forced, 
with 
other 
Observations, 
and 
more 
exact 
than 
the 
former, 
and 
in 
times 
more 
remote 
from 
one 
another, 
to 
correct 
the 
Tables 
of 
such 
Motions, 
and 
limit 
them 
even 
to 
the 
shortest 
moment: 
for 
such 
exactnesse 
my 
first 
Observations 
suffice 
not; 
not 
only 
in 
regard 
of 
the 
short 
intervals 
of 
Time, 
but 
because 
I 
had 
not 
as 
then 
found 
out 
a 
way 
to 
measure 
the 
distances 
between 
the 
said 
Planets 
by 
any 
Instrument: 
I 
Observed 
such 
Intervals 
with 
simple 
relation 
to 
the 
Diameter 
of 
the 
Body 
of 
Jupiter; 
taken, 
as 
we 
have 
said, 
by 
the 
eye, 
the 
which, 
though 
they 
admit 
not 
errors 
of 
above 
a 
Minute, 
yet 
they 
suffice 
not 
for 
the 
determination 
of 
the 
exact 
greatness 
of 
the 
Spheres 
of 
those 
Stars. 
But 
now 
that 
I 
have 
hit 
upon 
a 
way 
of 
taking 
such 
measures 
without 
failing, 
scarce 
in 
a 
very 
few 
Seconds, 
I 
will 
continue 
the 
observation 
to 
the 
very 
occultation 
of 
JUPITER, 
which 
shall 
serve 
to 
bring 
us 
to 
the 
perfect 
knowledge 
of 
the 
Motions, 
and 
Magnitudes 
of 
the 
Orbes 
of 
the 
said 
Planets, 
together 
also 
with 
some 
other 
consequences 
thence 
arising. 
I 
adde 
to 
these 
things 
the 
observation 
of 
some 
obscure 
Spots1, 
which 
are 
discovered 
in 
the 
Solar 
Body, 
which 
changing, 
position 
in 
that, 
propounds 
to 
our 
consideration 
a 
great 
argument 
either 
that 
the 
Sun 
revolves 
in 
it 
selfe, 
or 
that 
perhapsotherStarrs,inlikemanneras 
Venus 
and 
Mercury, 
revolve 
about 
it, 
invisible 
in 
other 
times, 
by 
reason 
of 
their 
small 
digressions, 
lesse 
than 
that 
of 
Mercury, 
and 
only 
visible 
when 
they 
interpose 
between 
the 
Sun 
and 
our 
eye, 
or 
else 
hint 
the 
truth 
of 
both 
this 
and 
that; 
the 
certainty 
of 
which 
things

Continuall

hath 
at 
last 
assured 
me 
that 
these 
Spots 
are 
matters 
contiguous 
to 
the 
Body 
of 
the 
Sun, 
there 
continually 
produced 
in 
great 
number, 
and 
afterwards 
dissolved, 
some 
in 
a 
shorter, 
some 
in 
a 
longer 
time, 
and 
to 
be 
by 
the 
Conversion 
or

of 
the 
Sun 
in 
it 
selfe, 
which 
in 
a 
Lunar 
Moneth, 
or 
thereabouts, 
finisheth 
its 
Period, 
caried 
about 
in 
a

an 
accident 
great 
of 
it 
selfe,

greater 
for 
its 
Consequences. 


As 
to 
the 
other 
particular 
in 
the 
next 
place 
B 
Many 
causes 
have 
moved 
me 
to 
write 
the 
present 
Tract, 
the 
subject 
whereof, 
is 
the 
Dispute 
which 
I 
held 
some 
dayes 
since, 
with 
some 
learned 
men 
of 
this 
City, 
about 
which, 
as 
your 
Highnesse 
knows, 
have 
followed 
many 
Discourses: 
The 
principall 
of 
which 
Causes 
hath 
been 
the 
Intimation 
of 
your 
Highnesse, 
having 
commended 
to 



me 
Writing, 
as 
a 
singular 
means 
to 
make 
true 
known 
from 
false, 
reall 
from 
apparent 
Reasons, 
farr 
better 
than 
by 
Disputing 
vocally, 
where 
the 
one 
or 
the 
other, 
or 
very 
often 
both 
the 
Disputants, 
through 
too 
greate 
heate, 
or 
exalting 
of 
the 
voyce, 
either 
are 
not 
understood, 
or 
else 
being 
transported 
by 
ostentation 
of 
not 
yeilding 
to 
one 
another, 
farr 
from 
the 
first 
Proposition, 
with 
the 
novelty, 
of 
the 
various 
Proposals, 
confound 
both 
themselves 
and 
their 
Auditors. 


B 
The 
occasioninducing 
theAuthorto 
writethisTreatise. 


Moreover, 
it 
seemed 
to 
me 
convenient 
to 
informe 
your 
Highnesse 
of 
all 
the 
sequell, 
concerning 
the 
Controversie 
of 
which 
I 
treat, 
as 
it 
hath 
been 
advertised 
often 
already 
by 
others: 
and 
because 
the 
Doctrine 
which 
I 
follow, 
in 
the 
discussion 
of 
the 
point 
in 
hand, 
is 
different 
from 
that 
of 
Aristotle; 
and 
interferes 
with 
his 
Principles, 
I 
have 
considered 
that 
against 
the 
Authority 
of 
that 
most 
famous 
Man, 
which 
amongst 
many 
makes 
all 
suspected 
that 
comes 
not 
from 
the 
Schooles 
of 
the 
Peripateticks, 
its 
farr 
better 
to 
give 
ones 
Reasons 
by 
the 
Pen 
than 
byword 
of 
mouth, 
and 
therforeIresolvedtowrite 
the 
present 
discourse: 
in 
which 
yet 
I 
hope 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
it 
was 
not 
out 
of 
capritiousnesse, 
or 
for 
that 
I 
had 
not 
read 
or 
understood 
Aristotle, 
that 
I 
sometimes 
swerve 
from 
his 
opinion, 
but 
because 
severall 
Reasons 
perswade 
me 
to 
it, 
and 
the 
same 
Aristotle 
hath 
tought 
me 
to 
fix 
my 
judgment 
on 
that 
which 
is 
grounded 
upon 
Reason, 
and 
not 
on 
the 
bare 
Authority 
of 
the 
Master2; 
and 
it 
is 
most 
certaine 
according 
to 
the 
sentence 
of 
Alcinoos, 
that 
philosophating 
should 
be 
free. 
Nor 
is 
the 
resolution 
of 
our 
Question 
in 
my 
judgment 
without 
some 
benefit 
to 
the 
Universall3, 
forasmuch 
as 
treating 
whether 
the 
figure 
of 
Solids 
operates, 
or 
not, 
in 
their 
going, 
or 
not 
going 
to 
thebottome 
in 
Water, 
in 
occurrences 
of 
buildingBridges 
or 
other 
Fabricks 
on

which 
happen 
commonly 
in 
affairs 
of 
grand 
import,

may 
be

2 
Aristotle 
prefers 
Reason 
to 
theAuthority 
ofanAuthor. 


3 
The 
benefit 
of 
this 
Argument. 


I 
say 
therfore, 
that 
being 
the 
last 
Summer 
in 
company 
with 
certain 
Learned 
men, 
it 
was 
said 
in 
the 
argumentation; 
That 
Condensation 
was 
the 
propriety 
of 
Cold4, 
and 
there 
was 
alledged 
for 
instance, 
the 
example 
of 
Ice: 



now 
I 
at 
that 
time 
said, 
that, 
in 
my 
judgment, 
the 
Ice 
should 
be 
rather 
Water 
rarified 
than 
condensed5, 
and 
my 
reason 
was, 
because 
Condensation 
begets 
diminution 
of 
Mass, 
and 
augmentation 
of 
gravity, 
and 
Rarifaction 
causeth 
greater 
Lightness, 
and 
augmentarion 
of 
Masse: 
and 
Water 
in 
freezing, 
encreaseth 
in 
Masse, 
and 
the 
Ice 
made 
thereby 
is 
lighter 
than 
the 
Water 
on 
which 
itswimmeth. 


4 
Condensation 
the 
Proprietyof 
Cold, 
according 
to 
thePeripateticks. 


5 
Ice 
rather 
water 
rarified, 
thancondensed, 
and 
why: 


What 
I 
say, 
is 
manifest, 
because, 
the 
medium 
subtracting 
from 
the 
whole 
Gravity 
of 
Sollids 
the 
weight 
of 
such 
another 
Masse 
of 
the 
said 
Medium; 
as 
Archimedes 
proves 
in 
his 
C 
First 
Booke 
De 
Insidentibus 
Humido; 
when 
ever 
the 
Masse 
of 
the 
said 
Solid 
encreaseth 
by 
Distraction, 
the 
more 
shall 
the 
Medium 
detract 
from 
its 
entire 
Gravity; 
and 
lesse, 
when 
by 
Compression 
it 
shall 
be 
condensed 
and 
reduced 
to 
a 
lesse 
Masse.

thatitsubmergethnot. 
Ireplied,thatany 
piece 
of 
Ice, 
of 
whatsoever 
Figure, 
swims 
upon 
the 
Water, 
a 
manifest 
signe, 
that 
its 
being 
never 
so 
flat 
and 
broad, 
hath 
not 
any 
part 
in 
its 
floating: 
and 
added, 
that 
it 
was 
a 
manifest 
proofe 
hereof 
to 
see 
a 
piece 
of 
Ice 
of 
very 
broad 
Figure 
being 
thrust 
to 
the 
botome 
of 
the 
Water, 
suddenly 
return 
to 
flote 
atoppe, 
which 
had 
it 
been 
more 
grave, 
and 
had 
its 
swimming 
proceeded 
from 
its 
Forme, 
unable 
to 
penetrate 
the 
Resistance 
of 
the 
Medium, 
that 
would 
be 
altogether 
impossible; 
I 
concluded 
therefore, 
that 
the 
Figure 
was 
in 
sort 
a 
Cause 
of 
the 
Natation 
or 
Submersion 
of 
Bodies, 
but 
the 
greater 
or 
lesse 
Gravity 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
Water: 
and 
therefore 
all 
Bodyes 
heavier 
than 
it 
of 
what 
Figure 
soever 
they 
be, 
indifferently 
go 
to 
the 
bottome, 
and 
the 
lighter, 
though 
of 
any 
figure, 
float 
indifferently 
on 
the 
top: 
and 
I 
suppose 
that 
those 
which 
hold 
otherwise, 
were 
induced 
to 
that 
beliefe, 
by 
seeing 
how 
that 
diversity 
of 
Formes 
or 
Figures, 
greatly 
altereth 
the 
Velosity, 
and 
Tardity 
of 



Motion; 
so 
that 
Bodies 
of 
Figure 
broad 
and 
thin, 
descend 
far 
more 
leasurely 
into 
the 
Water, 
than 
those 
of 
a 
more 
compacted 
Figure, 
though 
both 
made 
of 
the 
same 
Matter: 
by 
which 
some 
might 
be 
induced 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
Dilatation 
of 
the 
Figure 
might 
reduce 
it 
to 
such 
amplenesse 
that 
it 
should 
not 
only 
retard 
but 
wholly 
impede 
and 
take 
away 
the 
Motion, 
which 
I 
hold 
to 
be 
false. 
Upon 
this 
Conclusion, 
in 
many 
dayes 
discourse, 
was 
spoken 
much, 
and 
many 
things, 
and 
divers 
Experiments 
produced, 
of 
which 
your 
Highnesse 
heard, 
and 
saw 
some, 
and 
in 
this 
discourse 
shall 
have 
all 
that 
which 
hath 
been 
produced 
against 
my 
Assertion, 
and 
what 
hath 
been 
suggested 
to 
my 
thoughts 
on 
this 
matter, 
and 
for 
confirmation 
of 
my 
Conclusion: 
which 
if 
it 
shall 
suffice 
to 
remove 
that 
(as 
I 
esteem 
hitherto 
false) 
Opinion, 
I 
shall 
thinke 
I 
have 
not 
unprofitably 
spent 
my 
paynes 
and 
time. 
and 
although 
that 
come 
not 
to 
passe, 
yet 
ought 
I 
to 
promise 
another 
benefit 
to 
my 
selfe, 
namely, 
of 
attaining 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
truth, 
by 
hearing 
my 
Fallacyes 
confuted, 
and 
truedemonstrationsproduced 
bythoseofthecontrary 
opinion. 


And 
to 
proceed 
with 
the 
greatest 
plainness 
and 
perspicuity 
that 
I 
can 
possible, 
it 
is, 
I 
conceive, 
necessary, 
first 
of 
all 
to 
declare 
what 
is 
the 
true, 
intrinsecall, 
and 
totall 
Cause, 
of 
the 
ascending 
of 
some 
Sollid 
Bodyes 
in 
the 
Water, 
and 
therein 
floating; 
or 
on 
the 
contrary, 
of 
their 
sinking 
and 
so 
much 
the 
rather 
in 
asmuch 
as 
I 
cannot 
satisfie 
myselfe 
in 
that 
which 
Aristotle 
hath 
left 
written 
onthis 
Subject. 


The 
cause 
of 
the 
Natation 
& 
submersion 
of 
Solids 
in 
the 
Water. 


I 
say 
then 
the 
Cause 
why 
some 
Sollid 
Bodyes 
descend 
to 
the 
Bottom 
of 
Water, 
is 
the 
excesse 
of 
their 
Gravity, 
above 
the 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Water; 
and 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
excess 
of 
the 
Waters 
Gravity 
above 
the 
Gravity 
of 
those, 
is 
the 
Cause 
that 
others 
do 
not 
descend, 
rather 
that 
they 
rise 
from 
the 
Bottom, 
and 
ascend 
to 
the 
Surface. 
This 
was 
subtilly 
demonstrated 
by 
Archimedes 
in 
his 
Book 
Of 
the 
NATATION 
of 
BODIES: 
Conferred 
afterwards 
by 
a 
very 
grave 
Author, 
but, 
if 
I 
erre 
not 
invisibly, 
as 
below 
for 
defence 
of 
him, 
I 
shall 
endeavourtoprove. 


I, 
with 
a 
different 
Method, 
and 
by 
other 
meanes, 
will 
endeavour 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
same, 
reducing 
the 
Causes 
of 
such 
Effects 
to 
more 
intrinsecall 
and 
immediate 
Principles, 
in 
which 
also 
are 
discovered 
the 
Causes 
of 
some 
admirable 
and 
almost 
incredible 
Accidents, 
as 
that 
would 
be, 
that 
a 
very 
little 
quantity 
of 
Water, 
should 
be 
able, 
with 
its 
small 
weight, 
to 



raise 
and 
sustain 
a 
Solid 
Body, 
an 
hundred 
or 
a 
thousand 
times 
heavier 
than 
it. 


And 
because 
demonstrative 
Order 
so 
requires, 
I 
shall 
define 
certain 
Termes, 
and 
afterwards 
explain 
some 
Propositions, 
of 
which,as 
of 
thingstrue 
and 
obvious,Imaymakeuseofto 
my 
presentpurpose. 


DEFINITIONI. 


I 
then 
call 
equally 
Grave 
in 
specie, 
those 
Matters 
of 
which 
equall 
Masses 
weigh 
equally. 


As 
if 
for 
example, 
two 
Balls, 
one 
of 
Wax, 
and 
the 
other 
of 
some 
Wood 
of 
equall 
Masse, 
were 
also 
equall 
in 
Weight, 
we 
say, 
that 
such 
Wood, 
and 
the 
Waxare 
in 
specie 
equallygrave. 


DEFINITIONII. 


But 
equally 
grave 
in 
Absolute 
Gravity, 
we 
call 
two 
Sollids, 
weighing 
equally, 
though 
of 
Mass 
they 
be 
unequall. 


As 
for 
example, 
a 
Mass 
of 
Lead, 
and 
another 
of 
Wood, 
that 
weigh 
each 
ten 
pounds, 
I 
call 
equall 
in 
Absolute 
Gravity, 
though 
the 
Mass 
of 
the 
Wood 
bemuchgreaterthen 
thatoftheLead. 


And, 
consequently, 
less 
Grave 
inspecie. 


DEFINITIONIII. 


I 
call 
a 
Matter 
more 
Grave 
in 
specie 
than 
another, 
of 
which 
a 
Mass, 
equall 
to 
a 
Mass 
of 
the 
other, 
shall 
weigh 
more. 


And 
so 
I 
say, 
that 
Lead 
is 
more 
grave 
in 
specie 
than 
Tinn, 
because 
if 
you 
takeof 
themtwoequallMasses,thatoftheLeadweighethmore. 


DEFINITIONIV. 


But 
I 
call 
that 
Body 
more 
grave 
absolutely 
than 
this, 
if 
that 
weigh 
more 
than 
this, 
without 
any 
respect 
had 
to 
the 
Masses. 


And 
thus 
a 
great 
piece 
of 
Wood 
is 
said 
to 
weigh 
more 
than 
a 
little 
lump 
of 
Lead,though 
the 
Leadbe 
in 
specie 
more 
heavythan 
the 
Wood. 



And 
the 
same 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
of 
the 
less 
grave 
in 
specie, 
and 
the 
less 
graveabsolutely. 


These 
Termesdefined, 
I 
takefromtheMechanickstwo 
Principles:thefirst 
is,that 


AXIOME. 
I. 


Weights 
absolutely 
equall, 
moved 
with 
equall 
Velocity, 
are 
of 
equall 
Force 
and 
Moment 
in 
their 
operations. 


DEFINITION 
V. 


Moment, 
amongst 
Mechanicians, 
signifieth 
that 
Vertue, 
that 
Force, 
or 
that 
Efficacy, 
withwhichtheMovermoves, 
andtheMoveableresists. 


Which 
Vertue 
dependes 
not 
only 
on 
the 
simple 
Gravity, 
but 
on 
the 
Velocity 
of 
the 
Motion, 
and 
on 
the 
diverse 
Inclinations 
of 
the 
Spaces 
along 
which 
the 
Motion 
is 
made: 
For 
a 
descending 
Weight 
makes 
a 
greater 
Impetus 
in 
a 
Space 
much 
declining, 
than 
in 
one 
less 
declining; 
and 
in 
summe, 
what 
ever 
is 
the 
occasion 
of 
such 
Vertue, 
it 
ever 
retaines 
the 
name 
of 
Moment; 
nor 
in 
my 
Judgement, 
is 
this 
sence 
new 
in 
our 
Idiome, 
for, 
if 
I 
mistake 
not, 
I 
think 
we 
often 
say; 
This 
is 
a 
weighty 
businesse, 
but 
the 
other 
is 
of 
small 
moment: 
and 
we 
consider 
lighter 
matters 
and 
let 
pass 
those 
of 
Moment; 
a 
Metaphor, 
I 
suppose, 
taken 
from 
the 
Mechanicks. 


As 
for 
example, 
two 
weights 
equall 
in 
absolute 
Gravity, 
being 
put 
into 
a 
Ballance 
of 
equall 
Arms, 
they 
stand 
in 
Equilibrium, 
neither 
one 
going 
down, 
nor 
the 
other 
up: 
because 
the 
equality 
of 
the 
Distances 
of 
both, 
from 
the 
Centre 
on 
which 
the 
Ballance 
is 
supported, 
and 
about 
which 
it 
moves, 
causeth 
that 
those 
weights, 
the 
said 
Ballance 
moving, 
shall 
in 
the 
same 
Time 
move 
equall 
Spaces, 
that 
is, 
shall 
move 
with 
equall 
Velocity, 
so 
that 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
for 
which 
this 
Weight 
should 
descend 
more 
than 
that, 
or 
that 
more 
than 
this; 
and 
therefore 
they 
make 
an 
Equilibrium, 
and 
their 
Moments 
continue 
ofsemblable 
andequallVertue. 


ThesecondPrincipleis;That 


AXIOMEII. 



The 
Moment 
and 
Force 
of 
the 
Gravity, 
is 
encreased 
by 
the 
Velocity 
of 
the 
Motion. 


So 
that 
Weights 
absolutely 
equall, 
but 
conjoyned 
with 
Velocity 
unequall, 
are 
of 
Force, 
Moment 
and 
Vertue 
unequall: 
and 
the 
more 
potent, 
the 
more 
swift, 
according 
to 
the 
proportion 
of 
the 
Velocity 
of 
the 
one, 
to 
the 
Velocity 
of 
the 
other. 
Of 
this 
we 
have 
a 
very 
pertinent 
example 
in 
the 
Balance 
or 
Stiliard 
of 
unequall 
Arms, 
at 
which 
Weights 
absolutely 
equall 
being 
suspended, 
they 
do 
not 
weigh 
down, 
and 
gravitate 
equally, 
but 
that 
which 
is 
at 
a 
greater 
distance 
from 
the 
Centre, 
about 
which 
the 
Beam 
moves, 
descends, 
raising 
the 
other, 
and 
the 
Motion 
of 
this 
which 
ascends 
is 
slow, 
and 
the 
other 
swift: 
and 
such 
is 
the 
Force 
and 
Vertue, 
which 
from 
the 
Velocity 
of 
the 
Mover, 
is 
conferred 
on 
the 
Moveable, 
which 
receives 
it, 
that 
it 
can 
exquisitely 
compensate, 
as 
much 
more 
Weight 
added 
to 
the 
other 
slower 
Moveable: 
so 
that 
if 
of 
the 
Arms 
of 
the 
Balance, 
one 
were 
ten 
times 
as 
long 
as 
the 
other, 
whereupon 
in 
the 
Beames 
moving 
about 
the 
Centre, 
the 
end 
of 
that 
would 
go 
ten 
times 
as 
far 
as 
the 
end 
of 
this, 
a 
Weight 
suspended 
at 
the 
greater 
distance, 
may 
sustain 
and 
poyse 
another 
ten 
times 
more 
grave 
absolutely 
than 
it: 
and 
that 
because 
the 
Stiliard 
moving, 
the 
lesser 
Weight 
shall 
move 
ten 
times 
faster 
than 
the 
bigger. 
It 
ought 
alwayes 
therefore 
to 
be 
understood, 
that 
Motions 
are 
according 
to 
the 
same 
Inclinations, 
namely, 
that 
if 
one 
of 
the 
Moveables 
move 
perpendicularly 
to 
the 
Horizon, 
then 
the 
other 
makes 
its 
Motion 
by 
the 
like 
Perpendicular; 
and 
if 
the 
Motion 
of 
one 
were 
to 
be 
made 
Horizontally; 
that 
then 
the 
other 
is 
made 
along 
the 
same 
Horizontall 
plain:andinsumme,alwayesbothinlikeInclinations. 


This 
proportion 
between 
the 
Gravity 
and 
Velocity 
is 
found 
in 
all 
Mechanicall 
Instruments: 
and 
is 
considered 
by 
Aristotle, 
as 
a 
Principle 
in 
his 
Mechanicall 
Questions; 
whereupon 
we 
also 
may 
take 
it 
for 
a 
true 
Assumption, 
That 


AXIOMEIII. 


Weights 
absolutely 
unequall, 
do 
alternately 
counterpoyse 
and 
become 
of 
equall 
Moments, 
as 
oft 
as 
their 
Gravities, 
with 
contrary 
proportion, 
answer 
to 
the 
Velocity 
of 
their 
Motions. 


That 
is 
to 
say, 
that 
by 
how 
much 
the 
one 
is 
less 
grave 
than 
the 
other, 
by 
so 
muchisitinaconstitutionof 
movingmoreswiftlythanthat. 



Having 
prefatically 
explicated 
these 
things, 
wemaybegin 
to 
enquire, 
what 
Bodyes 
those 
are 
which 
totally 
submerge 
in 
Water, 
and 
go 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
and 
which 
those 
that 
by 
constraint 
float 
on 
the 
top, 
so 
that 
being 
thrust 
by 
violence 
under 
Water,they 
returnto 
swim, 
with 
one 
part 
of 
theirMass 
visible 
above 
the 
Surface 
of 
the 
Water: 
and 
this 
we 
will 
do 
by 
considering 
the 
respective 
operation 
of 
the 
said 
Solids, 
and 
of 
Water: 
Which 
operation 
followes 
the 
Submersion 
and 
sinking; 
and 
this 
it 
is6, 
That 
in 
the 
Submersion 
that 
the 
Solid 
maketh, 
being 
depressed 
downwards 
by 
its 
proper 
Gravity, 
it 
comes 
to 
drive 
away 
the 
water 
from 
the 
place 
where 
it 
successively 
subenters, 
and 
the 
water 
repulsed 
riseth 
and 
ascends 
above 
its 
first 
levell, 
to 
which 
Ascent 
on 
the 
other 
side 
it, 
as 
being 
a 
grave 
Body 
of 
its 
own 
nature, 
resists: 
And 
because 
the 
descending 
Solid 
more 
and 
more 
immerging, 
greater 
and 
greater 
quantity 
of 
Water 
ascends, 
till 
the 
whole 
Sollid 
be 
submerged; 
its 
necessary 
to 
compare 
the 
Moments 
of 
the 
Resistance 
of 
the 
water 
to 
Ascension, 
with 
the 
Moments 
of 
the 
pressive 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Solid: 
And 
if 
the 
Moments 
of 
the 
Resistance 
of 
the 
water, 
shall 
equalize 
the 
Moments 
of 
the 
Solid, 
before 
its 
totall 
Immersion7; 
in 
this 
case 
doubtless 
there 
shall 
be 
made 
an 
Equilibrium, 
nor 
shall 
the 
Body 
sink 
any 
farther. 
But 
if 
the 
Moment 
of 
the 
Solid, 
shall 
alwayes 
exceed 
the 
Moments 
wherewith 
the 
repulsed 
water 
successively 
makes 
Resistance8, 
that 
Solid 
shall 
not 
only 
wholly 
submerge 
under 
water, 
but 
shall 
descend 
to 
the 
Bottom. 
But 
if, 
lastly, 
in 
the 
instant 
of 
totall 
Submersion, 
the 
equality 
shall 
be 
made 
between 
the 
Moments 
of 
the 
prement 
Solid, 
and 
the 
resisting 
Water9; 
then 
shall 
rest, 
ensue, 
and 
the 
said 
Solid 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
rest 
indifferently, 
in 
whatsoever 
part 
of 
the 
water. 
By 
this 
time 
is 
manifest 
the 
necessity 
of 
comparing 
the 
Gravity 
of 
the 
water, 
and 
of 
the 
Solid10; 
and 
this 
comparison 
might 
at 
first 
sight 
seem 
sufficient 
to 
conclude 
and 
determine 
which 
are 
the 
Solids 
that 
float 
a-top, 
and 
which 
those 
that 
sink 
to 
the 
Bottom 
in 
the 
water, 
asserting 
that 
those 
shall 
float 
which 
are 
lesse 
grave 
in 
specie 
than 
the 
water, 
and 
those 
submerge, 
which 
are 
in 
specie 
more 
grave. 
For 
it 
seems 
in 
appearance, 
that 
the 
Sollid 
in 
sinking 
continually, 
raiseth 
so 
much 
Water 
in 
Mass, 
as 
answers 
to 
the 
parts 
of 
its 
own 
Bulk 
submerged: 
whereupon 
it 
is 
impossible, 
that 
a 
Solid 
less 
grave 
in 
specie, 
than 
water, 
should 
wholly 
sink, 
as 
being 
unable 
to 
raise 
a 
weight 
greater 
than 
its 
own, 
and 
such 
would 
a 
Mass 
of 
water 
equall 
to 
its 
own 
Mass 
be. 
And 
likewise 
it 
seems 
necessary, 
that 
the 
graver 
Solids 
do 
go 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
as 
being 
of 
a 
Force 
more 
than 
sufficient 
for 
the 
raising 
a 
Masse 
of 
water, 
equall 
to 
its 
own, 
though 
inferiour 
in 
weight. 
Nevertheless 
the 
business 
succeeds 



otherwise: 
and 
though 
the 
Conclusions 
are 
true, 
yet 
are 
the 
Causes 
thus 
assigned 
deficient, 
nor 
is 
it 
true, 
that 
the 
Solid 
in 
submerging, 
raiseth 
and 
repulseth 
Masses 
of 
Water, 
equall 
to 
the 
parts 
of 
it 
self 
submerged; 
but 
the 
Water 
repulsed, 
is 
alwayes 
less 
than 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Solid 
submerged11: 
and 
so 
much 
the 
more 
by 
how 
much 
the 
Vessell 
in 
which 
the 
Water 
is 
contained 
is 
narrower:in 
such 
mannerthatithinders 
not, 
but 
that 
a 
Solid 
maysubmerge 
all 
under 
Water, 
without 
raising 
so 
much 
Water 
in 
Mass, 
as 
would 
equall 
the 
tenth 
or 
twentieth 
part 
of 
its 
own 
Bulk: 
like 
as 
on 
the 
contrary, 
a 
very 
small 
quantity 
of 
Water, 
may 
raise 
a 
very 
great 
Solid 
Mass12, 
though 
such 
Solid 
should 
weigh 
absolutely 
a 
hundred 
times 
as 
much, 
or 
more, 
than 
the 
said 
Water, 
if 
so 
be 
that 
the 
Matter 
of 
that 
same 
Solid 
be 
in 
specie 
less 
grave 
than 
the 
Water. 
And 
thus 
a 
great 
Beam, 
as 
suppose 
of 
a 
1000 
weight, 
may 
be 
raised 
and 
born 
afloat 
by 
Water, 
which 
weighs 
not 
50: 
and 
this 
happens 
when

But 
because 
such 
things, 
propounded 
thus 
in 
abstract, 
are 
somewhat 
difficult 
to 
be 
comprehended, 
it 
would 
be 
good 
to 
demonstrate 
them 
by 
particular 
examples; 
and 
for 
facility 
of 
demonstration, 
we 
will 
suppose 
the 
Vessels 
in 
which 
we 
are 
to 
put 
the 
Water, 
and 
place 
the 
Solids, 
to 
be 
inviron’d 
and 
included 
with 
sides 
erected 
perpendicular 
to 
the 
Plane 
of 
the 
Horizon, 
and 
the 
Solid 
that 
is 
to 
be 
put 
into 
such 
vessell 
to 
be 
either 
a 
streight

The 
which 
proposed 
and 
declared, 
I 
proceed 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
truth 
of 
what 
hath 
been 
hinted, 
forming 
the 
ensuing 
Theoreme. 



THEOREME 
I. 


The 
Proportion 
of 
the 
water 
raised 
to 
the 
Solid 
submerged. 


The 
Mass 
of 
the 
Water 
which 
ascends 
in 
the 
submerging 
of 
a 
Solid, 
Prisme 
or 
Cylinder, 
or 
that 
abaseth 
in 
taking 
it 
out, 
is 
less 
than 
the 
Mass 
of 
the 
said 
Solid, 
so 
depressed 
or 
advanced: 
and 
hath 
to 
it 
the 
same 
proportion, 
that 
the 
Surface 
of 
the 
Water 
circumfusing 
the 
Solid, 
hath 
to 
the 
same 
circumfused 
Surface,together 
withtheBaseoftheSolid. 


Let 
the 
Vessell 
be 
A

and 
in 
it 
the 
Water 
raised 
up 
to 
the 
Levell 
E 
F 
G, 
before 
the 
Solid 
Prisme 
H 
I 
K 
be 
therein 
immerged; 
but 
after 
that 
it 
is 
depressed 
under 
Water, 
let 
the 
Water 
be 
raised 
as 
high 
as 
the 
Levell 
L 
M, 
the 
Solid 
H 
I 
K 
shall 
then 
be 
all 
under 
Water, 
and 
the 
Mass 
of 
the 
elevated 
Water 
shall 
be 
L 
G, 
which 
is 
less 
than 
the 
Masse 
of 
the 
Solid 
depressed, 
namely 
of 
H 
I 
K, 
being 
equall 
to 
the 
only 
part 
E 
I 
K, 
which 
is 
contained 
under 
the 
first 
Levell 
E 
F 
G. 


Which 
is 
manifest, 
because 
if 
the 
Solid 
H 
I 
K 
be 
taken 
out, 
the 
Water 
I 
G 
shall 
return 
into 
the 
place 
occupied 
by 
the 
Mass 
E 
I 
K, 
where 
it 
was 
continuate 
before 
the 
submersion 
of 
the 
Prisme. 
And 
the

L 
G 
being 
equall 
to 
the 
Mass 
E 
K: 
adde 
thereto 
the 
Mass 
E 
N, 
and 
it 
shall 
be 
the 
whole 
Mass 
E 
M, 
composed 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Prisme 
E 
N, 
and 
of 
the 
Water 
N 
F, 
equall 
to 
the 
whole 
Solid 
H 
I 
K: 
And, 
therefore, 
the 
Mass 
L 
G 
shall 
have 
the 
same 
proportion 
to 
E 
M, 
as 
to 
the 
Mass 
H 
I 
K: 
But 
the 
Mass 
L 
G 
hath 
the 
same 
proportion 
to 
the 
Mass 
E 
M, 
as 
the 
Surface 
L 
M 
hath 
to 
the 
Surface 
M 


H: 
Therefore 
it 
is 
manifest, 
that 
the 
Mass 
of 
Water 
repulsed 
L 
G, 
is 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
Mass 
of 
the 
Solid 
submerged 
H 
I 
K; 
as 
the 
Surface 
L 
M, 
namely, 
that 
of 
the 
Water 
ambient 
about 
the 
Sollid, 
to 
the 
whole 
Surface 
H 
M, 
compounded 
of 
the 
said 
ambient 
water, 
and 
the 
Base 
of

But 
if 
we 
suppose 
the 
first 
Levell 
of 
the

the 
according 
to 
the 
Surface 
H 
M, 
and 
the

and 
after 
to 
be 
taken 
out 
and 
raised

A

and 
the

to 
be 
faln 
from 
the 
first 
Levell 
H 
L 
M 
as 
low 
as 
E 
F 
G; 
It 
is 
manifest, 
that 
the 
Prisme 
E 
A 
O 
being 
the 
same 
with 
H 
I 
K, 
its 
superiour 
part 
H

shall 
be 
equall 
to 
the 
inferiour 
E 
I 
K: 
and 
remove 
the 
common 
part 
E 
N, 
and, 
consequently, 
the 
Mass 
of 
the 
Water 
L 
G 
is 
equall 
to 
the 
Mass 
H 
O; 
and, 
therefore, 
less 
than 
the 
Solid, 
which 
is 
without 
the 
Water, 
namely, 
the 
whole 
Prisme 
E 
A 
O, 
to 
which 
likewise, 
the 
said 
Mass 
of 
Water 

abated 
L 
G, 
hath 
the 
same 
proportion, 
that 
the 
Surface 
of 
the 
Waters 
circumfused 
L 
M 
hath 
to 
the 
same 
circumfused 
Surface, 
together 
with 
the 
Base 
of 
the 
Prisme 
A 
O: 
which 
hath 
the 
same 
demonstration 
with 
the 
former 
case 
above. 



And 
from 
hence 
is 
inferred, 
that 
the 
Mass 
of 
the 
Water, 
that 
riseth 
in 
the 
immersion 
of 
the 
Solid, 
or 
that 
ebbeth 
in 
elevating 
it, 
is 
not 
equall 
to 
all 
the 
Mass 
of 
the 
Solid, 
which 
is 
submerged 
or 
elevated, 
but 
to 
that 
part 
only, 
which 
in 
the 
immersion 
is 
under 
the 
first 
Levell 
of 
the 
Water, 
and 
in 
the 
elevation 
remaines 
above 
the 
first 
Levell: 
Which 
is 
that 
which 
was 
to 
be 
demonstrated. 
We 
will 
now 
pursue 
the 
things 
that 
remain. 


Andfirstwewilldemonstratethat, 


THEOREMEII. 


The 
proportion 
of 
the 
water 
abated, 
to 
the 
Solid 
raised. 


When 
in 
one 
of 
the 
above 
said 
Vessels, 
of 
what 
ever 
breadth, 
whether 
wide 
or 
narrow, 
there 
is 
placed 
such 
a 
Prisme 
or 
Cylinder, 
inviron’d 
with 
Water, 
if 
we 
elevate 
that 
Solid 
perpendicularly, 
the 
Water 
circumfused 
shall 
abate, 
and 
the 
Abatement 
of 
the 
Water, 
shall 
have 
the 
same 
proportion 
to 
the 
Elevation 
of 
the 
Prisme, 
as 
one 
of 
the 
Bases 
of 
the 
Prisme, 
hath 
to 
the 
Surface 
of 
the 
Water 
Circumfused. 



Imagine 
in 
the 
Vessell, 
as 
is 
aforesaid, 
the 
Prisme 
A 
C 
D 
B 
to 
be 
placed, 
and 
in 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
Space 
the 
Water 
to 
be 
diffused 
as 
far 
as 
the 
Levell 
E 
A: 
and 
raising 
the 
Solid, 
let 
it 
be 
transferred 
to 
G 
M, 
and 
let 
the 
Water 
be 
abased 
from 
E 
A 
to 
N 
O: 
I 
say, 
that 
the 
descent 
of 
the 
Water, 
measured 
by 
the 
Line 
A 
O, 
hath 
the 
same 
proportion 
to 
the 
rise 
of 
the 
Prisme, 
measured 
by 
the 
Line 
G 
A, 
as 
the 
Base 
of 
the 
Solid 
G 
H 
hath 
to 
the 
Surface 
of 
the 
Water 
N 
O. 
The 
which 
is 
manifest: 
because 
the 
Mass 
of 
the 
Solid 
G 
A 
B 
H, 
raised 
above 
the 
first 
Levell 
E 
A 
B, 
is 
equall 
to 
the 
Mass 
of 
Water 
that 
is 
abased 
E 
N 
O 
A. 
Therefore, 
E 
N 
O 
A 
and 
G 
A 
B 
H 
are 
two 
equall 
Prismes; 
for 
of 
equall 
Prismes, 
the 
Bases 
answer 
contrarily 
to 
their 
heights: 
Therefore, 
as 
the 
Altitude 
A 
O 
is 
to 
the 
Altitude 
A 
G, 
so 
is 
the 
Superficies 
or 
Base 
G 
H 
to 
the 
Surface 
of 
the 
Water 
N 
O. 
If 
therefore, 
for 
example, 
a 
Pillar 
were 
erected 
in 
a 
waste 
Pond 
full 
of 
Water, 
or 
else 
in 
a 
Well, 
capable 
of 
little 
more 
then 
the 
Mass 
of 
the 
said 
Pillar, 
in 
elevating 
the 
said 
Pillar, 
and 
taking 
it 
out 
of 
the 
Water, 
according 
as 
it 
riseth, 
the 
Water 
that 
invirons 
it 
will 
gradually 
abate, 
and 
the 
abasement 
of 
the 
Water 
at 
the 
instant 
of 
lifting 
out 
the 
Pillar, 
shall 
have 
the 
same 
proportion, 
that 
the 
thickness 
of 
the 
Pillar 
hath 
to 
the 
excess 
of 
the 
breadth 
of 
the 
said 
Pond 
or 
Well, 
above 
the 
thickness 
of 
the 
said 
Pillar: 
so 
that 
if 
the 
breadth 
of 
the 
Well 
were 
an 
eighth 
part 
larger 
than 
the 
thickness 
of 
the 
Pillar, 
and 
the 
breadth 
of 
the 
Pond 
twenty 
five 
times 
as 
great 
as 
the 
said 
thickness, 
in 
the 
Pillars 
ascending 
one 
foot, 
the 
water 
in 
the 
Well 
shall 
descendseven

Why 
a 
Solid 
less 
grave 
in 
specie 
than 
water, 
stayeth 
not 
under 
water, 
in 
very 
small

This 
Demonstrated, 
it

But 
the

is 
to 
the

as 
the

LEMMA 
I. 


The 
absolute 
Gravity 
of 
Solids, 
are 
in 
a 
proportion 
compounded 
of 
their 
Specifick 
Gravities, 
and 
of 
their 
Masses. 


The 
absolute 
Gravities 
of 
Solids, 
have 
a 
proportion 
compounded 
of 
the 


proportionsoftheirspecificallGravities,andoftheirMasses.
Let 
A 
and 
B 
be 
two 
Solids. 
I 
say, 
that 
the 
Absolute 
Gravity 
of 
A, 
hath

the

to 
the

and 
of 
the 
Mass 
A 
to 
the 
Mass 
B. 
Let 
the 
Line 
D 
have 
the 
same 
proportion 
to 
E, 
that 
the 
specifick 
Gravity 
of 
A, 
hath 
to 
the 
specifick 
Gravity 
of 
B; 
and 
let 
E 
be 
to 
F, 
as 
the 
Mass 
A 
to 
the 
Mass 
B: 
It 
is 
manifest, 
that 
the 
proportion 
of 
D 
to 
F, 
is 
compounded 
of 
the 
proportions 
D 
and 
E; 
and 
E 
and 
F. 
It 
is 
requisite, 
therefore, 
to 
demonstrate, 
that 
as 
D 
is 
to 
F, 
so 
the 
absolute 
Gravity 
of 
A, 
is 
to 
the 
absolute 
Gravity 
of 
B. 
Take 
the 
Solid 
C, 
equall 
in 
Mass 
to 
the 
Solid 
A, 
and 
ofthesameGravity 
in 
specie 
withtheSolidB. 


Because, 
therefore, 
A 
and 
C 
are 
equall 
in 
Mass, 
the 
absolute 
Gravity 
of 
A, 
shall 
have 
to 
the 
absolute 
Gravity 
of 
C, 
the 
same 
proportion, 
as 
the 
specificall 
Gravity 
of 
A, 
hath 
to 
the 
specificall 
Gravity 
of 
C, 
or 
of 
B, 
which 
is 
the 
same 
in 
specie; 
that 
is, 
as 
D 
is 
to 
E. 
And, 
because, 
C 
and 
B 
are 
of 
the 
same 
Gravity 
in 
specie, 
it 
shall 
be, 
that 
as 
the 
absolute 
weight 
of 
C, 
is 
to 
the 
absolute 



weight 
of 
B, 
so 
the 
Mass 
C, 
or 
the 
Mass 
A, 
is 
to 
the 
Mass 
B; 
that 
is, 
as 
the 
Line 
E 
to 
the 
Line 
F. 
As 
therefore, 
the 
absolute 
Gravity 
of 
A, 
is 
to 
the 
absolute 
Gravity 
of 
C, 
so 
is 
the 
Line 
D 
to 
the 
Line 
E: 
and, 
as 
the 
absolute 
Gravity 
of 
C, 
is 
to 
the 
absolute 
Gravity 
of 
B, 
so 
is 
the 
Line 
E 
to 
the 
Line 
F: 
Therefore, 
by 
Equality 
of 
proportion, 
the 
absolute 
Gravity 
of 
A, 
is 
to 
the 
absolute 
Gravity 
of 
B, 
as

which 
was

The

of 
whatsoever 
greatnesse, 
and 
the

be 
afterwards 
infused, 
the

shall 
rest 
in 
the

unraised, 
till 
the

arrive 
to 
that 
part 
of 
the 
Altitude, 
of 
the 
said

to 
which 
its 
whole 
Altitude 
hath 
the

that 
the 
Specificall 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Water, 
hath 
to 
the 
Specificall 
Gravity 
of 
the 
said 
Solid: 
but 
infusing 
more 
Water, 
the 
Solid 
shall 
ascend. 



Let 
the

be

of 
any

and 
let 
there 
be 
placed

it 
the 
Solid 
Prisme 
D 
F 
G 
E, 
less 
grave 
in

than 
the

and 
look 
what 
proportion 
the 
Specificall 
Gravity 
of 
the

hath 
to 
that 
of 
the 
Prisme, 
such 
let 
the 
Altitude 
D 
F, 
have 
to 
the 
Altitude 
F 
B. 
I 
say, 
that 
infusing 
water 
to 
the 
Altitude 
F 
B, 
the 
Solid 
D 
G 
shall 
not 
float, 
but 
shall 
stand 
in 
Equilibrium, 
so, 
that 
that 
every 
little 
quantity 
of 
water, 
that 
is 
infused, 
shall 
raise 
it. 
Let 
the 
water, 
therefore, 
be 
infused 
to 
the 
Levell 
A 
B 
C; 
and; 
because 
the 
Specifick 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Solid 
D 
G, 
is 
to 
the 
Specifick 
Gravity 
of 
the

as 
the

B 
F 
is 
to 
the

F 
D; 
that 
is, 
as 
the 
Mass 
B 
G 
to 
the 



Mass 
G 
D; 
as 
the 
proportion 
of 
the

B 
G 
is 
to 
the 
Mass 
G 
D, 
as 
the 
proportion 
of 
the

is

A 
F, 
they 
compose 
the 
Proportion 
of 
the 
Mass 
B 
G 
to 
the 
Mass 
A 
F. 
Therefore, 
the 
Mass 
B 
G 
is 
to 
the 
Mass 
A 
F, 
in 
a 
proportion 
compounded 
of 
the 
proportions 
of 
the 
Specifick 
Gravity 
of 
the

G

to 
the 
Specifick 
Gravity 
of 
the

and 
of 
the

G

to 
the

A 
F: 
But 
the 
same 
proportions 
of 
the 
Specifick 
Gravity 
of 
G 
D, 
to 
the 
Specifick 
Gravity 
of 
the 
water, 
and 
of 
the 
Mass 
G 
D 
to 
the 
Mass 
A 
F, 
do 
also 
by 
the 
precedent 
Lemma, 
compound 
the 
proportion 
of 
the 
absolute 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Solid 
D 
G, 
to 
the 
absolute 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Mass 
of 
the 
water 
A 


F: 
Therefore, 
as 
the 
Mass 
B 
G 
is 
to 
the 
Mass 
A 
F, 
so 
is 
the 
Absolute 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Solid 
D 
G, 
to 
the 
Absolute 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Mass 
of 
the 
water 
A 
F. 
But 
as 
the 
Mass 
B 
G 
is 
to 
the 
Mass 
A 
F; 
so 
is 
the 
Base 
of 
the 
Prisme 
D 
E, 
to 
the 
Surface 
of 
the 
water 
A 
B; 
and 
so 
is 
the 
descent 
of 
the 
water 
A 
B, 
to 
the 
Elevation 
of 
the 
Prisme 
D 
G; 
Therefore, 
the 
descent 
of 
the 
water 
is 
to 
the 
elevation 
of 
the 
Prisme, 
as 
the 
absolute 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Prisme, 
is 
to 
the 
absolute 
Gravity 
of 
the 
water: 
Therefore, 
the 
Moment 
resulting 
from 
the 
absolute 
Gravity 
of 
the 
water 
A 
F, 
and 
the 
Velocity 
of 
the 
Motion 
of 
declination, 
with 
which 
Moment 
it 
forceth 
the 
Prisme 
D 
G, 
to 
rise 
and 
ascend, 
is 
equall 
to 
the 
Moment 
that 
results 
from 
the 
absolute 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Prisme 
D 
G, 
and 
from 
the 
Velocity 
of 
the 
Motion, 
wherewith 
being 
raised, 
it 
would 
ascend: 
with 
which 
Moment 
it 
resists 
its 
being 
raised: 
because, 
therefore, 
such 
Moments 
are 
equall, 
there 
shall 
be 
an 
Equilibrium 
between 
the 
water 
and 
the 
Solid. 
And, 
it 
is 
manifest, 
that 
putting 
a 
little 
more 
water 
unto 
the 
other 
A 
F, 
it 
will 
increase 
the 
Gravity 
and 
Moment, 
whereupon 
the 
Prisme 
D 
G, 
shall 
be 
overcome, 
and 
elevated 
till 
that

How 
far 
Solids 
less 
grave

than

do 
submerge. 


By 
what 
hath 
been 
demonstrated, 
it 
is 
manifest, 
that 
Solids 
less 
grave 
in 
specie 
than 
the 
water, 
submerge 
only 
so 
far, 
that 
as 
much

as

the

of 
the

submerged, 
doth 
weigh 
absolutely 
as

the

For, 
it 
being 
supposed, 
that 
the

Gravity 
of

is 
to 
the 
Specificall

that 
is, 
as 
the 
Solid 
D 
G 
is 
to 
the

B 
G; 
we 
might 
easily 
demonstrate, 
that 
as 
much 
water 
in

as 
is 
equall 
to 
the 
Solid 
B 
G, 
doth 
weigh 
absolutely 
as 
much 
as 
the 
whole

For, 
by 
the 
Lemma 
foregoing, 
the 
Absolute 
Gravity 
of 
a 
Mass 
of 
water, 
equall 
to 
the 
Mass 
B 
G, 
hath 
to 
the 
Absolute 
Gravity 
of 
the

D

a 
proportion 
compounded 
of 
the 
proportions, 
of 
the

to 
the

and 
of 
the 
Specifick 
Gravit{y} 
of 
the

to 
the 
Specifick

But 
the 
Gravity 
in

of 
the

to 
the 
Gravity

the

is 
supposed 
to 
be 
as 
the 
Mass 
G 
D 
to 
the 
Mass 
G 
B. 
Therefore, 
the 
Absolute 
Gravity 
of 
a 
Mass 
of 
water, 
equall 
to 
the 
Mass 
B 
G, 
is 
to 
the 
Absolute

of 
the

in

to

which 
is 
a

The

It

that 
a

less

being 
put

that 
as 
much

as

do 
weigh

it

The

if

had 
been 
elevated 
to 
three

which 
to 
many 
at 
the 
first 
sight, 
may 
seem 
a 
notable 
Paradox, 
and 
beget 
a 
conceit, 
that 
the 
Demonstration 
of 
these

were 
sophisticall 
and 
fallacious: 
but, 
for 
those 
who 
so 
repute 
it, 
the

is 
a 
means 
that

fully 
satisfie 
them. 
But 
he 
that

is, 
and 
how 
it 
exactly 
compensates 
the

will 
cease

wonder, 
in

the 
great

very 
much,

the

is 
performed

In

let

consider

some

unto 
the

which

shall 
rest 
in 
this 
position, 
not 
without 
admiration 
in 
some, 
who 
cannot 
conceive 
how 
it 
can 
be, 
that 
the 
heavie 
charge 
of 
the 
great 
Mass 
of 
water 
G 
D, 
pressing 
downwards, 
should 
not 
elevate 
and 
repulse 
the 
little 
quantity 
of 
the

contained 
in 
the 
Funnell

by 
which 
the

of

hindered: 
But 
such

shall 
cease, 
if 
we 
begin 
to 
suppose 
the

to 
be 
abased 
only

and 
shall 
afterwards

the

by

One

can 
never 
be 
sustained, 
by 
any 
whatever 
quantity 
of 
it. 


For 
having 
seen 
how 
that 
the 
Moment 
wherewith 
such 
a 
Solid, 
as 
grave 
in 
specie 
as 
the 
water, 
contrasts 
with 
the 
Moment 
of 
any 
Mass 
of 
water 
whatsoever, 
is 
able 
to 
retain 
it, 
even 
to 
its 
totall 
Submersion, 
without 
its 
ever 
ascending; 
it 
remaineth, 
manifest, 
that 
the 
water 
is 
far 
less 
able 
to 
raise 
it 
up, 
when 
it 
exceeds 
the 
same 
in 
specie: 
so, 
that 
though 
you 
infuse 
water 
till 
its 
totall 
Submersion, 
it 
shall 
still 
stay 
at 
the 
Bottome, 
and 
with 
such 
Gravity, 
and 
Resistance 
to 
Elevation, 
as 
is 
the 
excess 
of 
its 
Absolute 
Gravity, 
above 
the 
Absolute 
Gravity 
of 
a 
Mass 
equall 
to 
it, 
made 
of 
water, 
or 
of 
a 
Matter 
in

equally 
grave 
with 
the

though

encrease 
the 
Pression,

Gravitation, 
of 
the 
parts 
circumfused 
about 
the 
said 
Solid, 
by 
which 
greater 
pression, 
it 
might 
come 
to 
be 
repulsed; 
because, 
the 
Resistance 
is 
not 
made, 
but 
only 
by 
those 
parts 
of 
the 
water, 
which 
at 
the 
Motion 
of 
the 
said 
Solid 
do 
also 
move, 
and 
these 
are 
those 
only, 
which 
are 
comprehended 
by 
the 
two 
Superficies 
equidistant 
to 
the 
Horizon, 
and 
their 
parallels, 
that 
comprehend 
the 
Altitude

I 
conceive, 
I 
have 
by 
this 
time 
sufficiently 
declared 
and 
opened 
the 
way 
to 
the 
contemplation 
of 
the 
true, 
intrinsecall 
and 
proper 
Causes 
of 
diverse 
Motions, 
and 
of 
the 
Rest 
of 
many 
Solid 
Bodies 
in 
diverse 
Mediums, 
and 
particularly 
in 
the 
water, 
shewing 
how 
all 
in 
effect, 
depend 
on 
the 
mutuall 
excesses 
of 
the 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Moveables 
and 
of 
the 
Mediums: 
and, 
that 
which 
did 
highly 
import, 
removing 
the 
Objection, 
which 
peradventure 
would 
have 
begotten 
much 
doubting, 
and 
scruple 
in 
some, 
about 
the 
verity 
of 
my 
Conclusion, 
namely, 
how 
that 
notwithstanding, 
that 
the 
excess 
of 
the 
Gravity 
of 
the 
water, 
above 
the 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Solid, 
demitted 
into 
it, 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
its 
floating 
and 
rising 
from 
the 
Bottom 
to 
the 
Surface, 
yet 
a 
quantity 
of 
water, 
that 
weighs 
not 
ten 
pounds, 
can 
raise 
a 
Solid 
that 
weighs 
above 
100 
pounds: 
in 
that 
we 
have 
demonstrated, 
That 
it 
sufficeth, 
that 
such 
difference 
be 
found 
between 
the 
Specificall 
Gravities 
of 
the 
Mediums 
and 
Moveables, 
let 
the 
particular 
and 
absolute 
Gravities 
be 
what 
they 
will: 
insomuch, 
that 
a 
Solid, 
provided 
that 
it 
be 
Specifically 
less 
grave 
than 
the 
water, 
although 
its 
absolute 
weight 
were 
1000 
pounds, 
yet 
may 
it 
be 
born 
up 
and 
elevated 
by 
ten 
pounds 
of 
water, 
and 
less: 
and 
on 
the 
contrary, 
another 
Solid, 
so 
that 
it 
be 
Specificallymoregrave 
thanthewater,thoughin 
absoluteGravityitwerenot 
above 
a

yet 
all 
the 
water 
in 
the 
Sea, 
cannot 
raise 
it 
from 
the 
Bottom, 
or 
float 
it. 
This 
sufficeth 
me, 
for 
my 
present 
occasion, 
to 
have, 
by 
the 
above 
declared 
Examples, 
discovered 
and 
demonstrated, 
without 
extending 
such 
matters 
farther, 
and, 
as 
I 
might 
have 
done, 
into 
a 
long 
Treatise: 
yea, 
but 
that 
there 
was 
a 
necessity 
of 
resolving 
the 
above 
proposed 
doubt, 
I 
should 
have 
contented 
my 
self 
with 
that 
only, 
which 
is 
demonstrated 
by 
Archimedes, 
in 
his 
first 
Book 
De 
Insidentibus 
humido14: 
where 
in 
generall 
termes 
he 
infers

The

defence 
of 
Archimedes 
his 
Doctrine, 
against 
the 
oppositions 
of 
Buonamico. 


But, 
because 
that 
this 
Doctrine 
of 
Archimedes, 
perused, 
transcribed 
and 
examined 
by 
Signor 
Francesco 
Buonamico, 
in 
his 
fifth 
Book 
of 
Motion, 
Chap. 
29, 
and 
afterwards 
by 
him 
confuted, 
might 
by 
the 
Authority 
of 
so 
renowned, 
and 
famous 
a 
Philosopher, 
be 
rendered 
dubious, 
and 
suspected 
of 
falsity; 
I 
have 
judged 
it 
necessary 
to 
defend 
it, 
if 
I 
am 
able 
so 
to 
do, 
and 
to 
clear 
Archimedes, 
from 
those 
censures, 
with 
which 
he 
appeareth 
to 
be 
charged. 
Buonamico 
rejecteth 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
Archimedes, 
first15, 
as 
not 
consentaneous 
with 
the 
Opinion 
of 
Aristotle, 
adding, 
that 
it 
was 
a 
strange 
thing 
to 
him, 
that 
the 
Water 
should 
exceed 
the 
Earth 
in 
Gravity16, 
seeing 
on 
the 
contrary, 
that 
the 
Gravity 
of 
water, 
increaseth, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
participation 
of 
Earth. 
And 
he 
subjoyns 
presently 
after17, 
that 
he 
was 
not 
satisfied 
with 
the 
Reasons 
of 
Archimedes, 
as 
not 
being 
able 
with 
that 
Doctrine, 
to 
assign 
the 
cause 
whence 
it 
comes, 
that 
a 
Boat 
and 
a 
Vessell, 
which 
otherwise, 
floats 
above 
the 
water, 
doth 
sink 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
if 
once 
it 
be 
filled 
with 
water; 
that 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
equality 
of 
Gravity, 
between 
the 
water 
within 
it, 
and 
the 
other 
water 
without, 
it 
should 
stay 
a 
top; 
but 
yet, 
nevertheless,weseeittogoto

His 
first 
Objection 
against 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
Archimedes. 


16 
His 
Second 
Objection. 


17 
His 
third 
Objection. 


He 
farther 
addes18, 
that 
Aristotle 
had 
clearly 
confuted 
the 
Ancients, 
who 
said, 
that 
light 
Bodies 
moved 
upwards19, 
driven 
by 
the 
impulse 
of 
the 
more 
grave 
Ambient: 
which 
if 
it 
were 
so, 
it 
should 
seem 
of 
necessity 
to 
follow, 
that 
all 
naturall 
Bodies 
are 
by 
nature 
heavy, 
and 
none 
light: 
For 
that 
the 
same 
would 
befall 
the 
Fire 
and 
Air, 
if 
put 
in 
the 
Bottom 
of 
the 
water. 
And, 
howbeit, 
Aristotle 
grants 
a 
Pulsion 
in 
the 
Elements, 
by 
which 
the 
Earth 
is 
reduced 
into 
a 
Sphericall 
Figure, 
yet 
nevertheless, 
in 
his 
judgement; 
it 
is 
not 
such 
that 
it 
can 
remove 
grave 
Bodies 
from 
their 
naturall 
places, 
but 
rather, 



that 
it 
send 
them 
toward 
the 
Centre, 
to 
which 
(as 
he 
somewhat 
obscurely 
continues 
to 
say,) 
the 
water 
principally 
moves, 
if 
it 
in 
the 
interim 
meet 
not 
with 
something 
that 
resists 
it, 
and, 
by 
its 
Gravity, 
thrusts 
it 
out 
of 
its 
place: 
in 
which 
case, 
if 
it 
cannot 
directly, 
yet 
at 
least 
as 
well 
as 
it 
can, 
it 
tends 
to 
the 
Centre: 
but 
it 
happens, 
that 
light 
Bodies 
by 
such 
Impulsion, 
do 
all 
ascend 
upward: 
but 
this 
properly 
they 
have 
by 
nature, 
as 
also, 
that 
other 
of 
swimming. 
He 
concludes, 
lastly20, 
that 
he 
concurs 
with 
Archimedes 
in 
his 
Conclusions; 
but 
not 
in 
the 
Causes, 
which 
he 
would 
referre 
to 
the 
facile 
and 
difficult 
Separation 
of 
the 
Medium, 
and 
to 
the 
predominance 
of 
the 
Elements, 
so 
that 
when 
the 
Moveable 
superates 
the 
power 
of 
the 
Medium; 
as 
for 
example, 
Lead

The

This 
is 
all 
that 
I 
have 
been 
able 
to 
collect, 
as 
produced 
against 
Archimedes 
by 
Signor 
Buonamico: 
who 
hath 
not 
well 
observed 
the 
Principles 
and 
Suppositionsof 
Archimedes; 
which 
yet 
must 
be 
false, 
if 
the 
Doctrine 
be 
false, 
which 
depends 
upon 
them; 
but 
is 
contented 
to 
alledge 
therein 
some 
Inconveniences, 
and 
some 
Repugnances 
to 
the 
Doctrine 
and 
Opinion 
of 
Aristotle. 
In 
answer 
to 
which 
Objections, 
I 
say, 
first21, 
That 
the 
being 
of 
Archimedes 
Doctrine, 
simply 
different 
from 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
Aristotle, 
ought 
not 
to 
move 
any 
to 
suspect 
it, 
there 
being 
no 
cause, 
why 
the 
Authority 
of 
this 
should 
be 
preferred 
to 
the 
Authority 
of 
the 
other: 
but, 
because, 
where 
the 
decrees 
of 
Nature 
are 
indifferently 
exposed 
to 
the 
intellectuall 
eyes 
of 
each, 
the 
Authority 
of 
the 
one 
and 
the 
other, 
loseth 
all 
a{u}thenticalness 
of 
Perswasion, 
the 
absolute 
power 
residing 
in 
Reason; 
therefore 
I 
pass 
to 
that 
which 
he 
alledgeth 
in 
the 
second 
place22, 
as 
an 
absurd 
consequent 
of 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
Archimedes, 
namely, 
That 
water 
should 
be 
more 
grave 
than 
Earth. 
But 
I 
really 
find 
not, 
that 
ever 
Archimedes 
said 
such 
a 
thing, 
or 
that 
it 
can 
be 
rationally 
deduced 
from 
his 
Conclusions: 
and 
if 
that 
were 
manifest 
unto 
me, 
I 
verily 
believe, 
I 
should 
renounce 
his 
Doctrine, 
as 
most 
erroneous. 
Perhaps 
this 
Deduction 
of 
Buonamico, 
is 
founded 
upon 
that 
which 
he 
citeth 
of 
the 
Vessel, 
which 
swims 
as 
long 
as 
its 
voyd 
of 
water, 
but 
once 
full 
it 
sinks 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
and 
understanding 
it 
of 
a 
Vessel 
of 
Earth, 
he 
infers 
against 



Archimedes 
thus: 
Thou 
sayst 
that 
the 
Solids 
which 
swim, 
are 
less 
grave 
than 
water: 
this 
Vessell 
swimmeth: 
therefore, 
this 
Vessell 
is 
lesse 
grave 
than 
water. 
If 
this 
be 
the 
Illation. 
I 
easily 
answer, 
granting 
that 
this 
Vessell 
is 
lesse 
grave 
than 
water, 
and 
denying 
the 
other 
consequence, 
namely, 
that 
Earth 
is 
less 
Grave 
than 
Water. 
The 
Vessel 
that 
swims 
occupieth 
in 
the 
water, 
not 
only 
a 
place 
equall 
to 
the 
Mass 
of 
the 
Earth, 
of 
which 
it 
is 
formed; 
but 
equall 
to 
the 
Earth 
and 
to 
the 
Air 
together, 
contained 
in 
its 
concavity. 
And, 
if 
such 
a 
Mass 
compounded 
of 
Earth 
and 
Air, 
shall 
be 
less 
grave 
than 
such 
another 
quantity 
of 
water, 
it 
shall 
swim, 
and 
shall 
accord 
with 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
Archimedes; 
but 
if, 
again, 
removing 
the 
Air, 
the 
Vessell 
shall 
be 
filled 
with 
water, 
so 
that 
the 
Solid 
put 
in 
the 
water, 
be 
nothing 
but 
Earth, 
nor 
occupieth 
other 
place, 
than 
that 
which 
is 
only 
possest 
by 
Earth, 
it 
shall 
then 
go 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
by 
reason 
that 
the 
Earth 
is 
heavier 
than 
the 
water: 
and 
this 
corresponds 
well 
with 
the 
meaning 
of 
Archimedes. 
See 
the 
same 
effect 
illustrated, 
with 
such 
another 
Experiment, 
In 
pressing 
a 
Viall 
Glass 
to 
the 
Bottom 
of 
the 
water, 
when 
it 
is 
full 
of 
Air, 
it 
will 
meet 
with 
great 
resistance, 
because 
it 
is 
not 
the 
Glass 
alone, 
that 
is 
pressed 
under 
water, 
but 
together 
with 
the 
Glass 
a 
great 
Mass 
of 
Air, 
and 
such, 
that 
if 
you 
should 
take 
as 
much 
water, 
as 
the 
Mass 
of 
the 
Glass, 
and 
of 
the 
Air 
contained 
in 
it, 
you 
would 
have 
a 
weight 
much 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
the 
Viall, 
and 
of 
its 
Air: 
and, 
therefore, 
it 
will 
not 
submerge 
without 
great 
violence: 
but 
if 
we 
demit 
only 
the 
Glass 
into 
the 
water, 
which 
shall 
be 
when 
you 
shall 
fill 
the 
Glass 
with 
water, 
then 
shall 
the 
Glass 
descend 
to 
the 
Bottom; 
as 
superiour 
in 
Gravity 
to 
thewater.

Authors

to 
thefirstObjection. 


22 
The 
Authors 
answer 
to 
thesecond 
Objection. 


Returning, 
therefore, 
to 
our 
first 
purpose; 
I 
say, 
that 
Earth 
is 
more 
grave 
than 
water, 
and 
that 
therefore, 
a 
Solid 
of 
Earth 
goeth 
to 
the 
bottom 
of 
it; 
but 
one 
may 
possibly 
make 
a 
composition 
of 
Earth 
and 
Air, 
which 
shall 
be 
less 
grave 
than 
a 
like 
Mass 
of 
Water; 
and 
this 
shall 
swim: 
and 
yet 
both 
this 
and 
the 
other 
experiment 
shall 
very 
well 
accord 
with 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
Archimedes. 
But 
because 
that 
in 
my 
judgment 
it 
hath 
nothing 
of 
difficulty 
in 
it, 
I 
will 
not 
positively 
affirme 
that 
Signor 
Buonamico, 
would 
by 
such 
a 
discourse 
object 
unto 
Archimedes 
theabsurdity 
ofinferringby 
his 
doctrine, 
thatEarthwasless 



grave 
than 
Water, 
though 
I 
know 
not 
how 
to 
conceive 
what 
other 
accident 
he 
couldhaveinducedthence. 


Perhaps 
such 
a 
Probleme 
(in 
my 
judgement 
false) 
was 
read 
by 
Signor 
Buonamico 
in 
some 
other 
Author, 
by 
whom 
peradventure 
it 
was 
attributed 
as 
a 
singular 
propertie, 
of 
some 
particular 
Water, 
and 
so 
comes 
now 
to 
be 
used 
with 
a 
double 
errour 
in 
confutation 
of 
Archimedes, 
since 
he 
saith 
no 
such 
thing, 
nor 
by 
him 
that 
did 
say 
it 
was 
it 
meant 
of 
the 
common 
Element 
of 
Water. 


The 
Authors 
answer 
to 
the 
third 
Objection. 


The 
third 
difficulty 
in 
the 
doctrine 
of 
Archimedes 
was, 
that 
he 
could 
not 
render 
a 
reason 
whence 
it 
arose, 
that 
a 
piece 
of 
Wood, 
and 
a 
Vessell 
of 
Wood, 
which 
otherwise 
floats, 
goeth 
to 
the 
bottom, 
if 
filled 
with 
Water. 
Signor 
Buonamico 
hath 
supposed 
that 
a 
Vessell 
of 
Wood, 
and 
of 
Wood 
that 
by 
nature 
swims, 
as 
before 
is 
said, 
goes 
to 
the 
bottom, 
if 
it 
be 
filled 
with 
water; 
of 
which 
he 
in 
the 
following 
Chapter, 
which 
is 
the 
30 
of 
the 
fifth 
Book 
copiously 
discourseth: 
but 
I 
(speaking 
alwayes 
without 
diminution 
of 
his 
singularLearning) 
dareindefenceof 
Archimedes 
deny 
thisexperiment,being 
certain 
that 
a 
piece 
of 
Wood 
which 
by 
its 
nature 
sinks 
not 
in 
Water, 
shall 
not 
sinke 
though 
it 
be 
turned 
and 
converted 
into 
the 
forme 
of 
any 
Vessell 
whatsoever, 
and 
then 
filled 
with 
Water: 
and 
he 
that 
would 
readily 
see 
the 
Experiment 
in 
some 
other 
tractable 
Matter, 
and 
that 
is 
easily 
reduced 
into 
several 
Figures, 
may 
take 
pure 
Wax, 
and 
making 
it 
first 
into 
a 
Ball 
or 
other 
solid 
Figure, 
let 
him 
adde 
to 
it 
so 
much 
Lead 
as 
shall 
just 
carry 
it 
to 
the 
bottome, 
so 
that 
being 
a 
graine 
less 
it 
could 
not 
be 
able 
to 
sinke 
it, 
and 
making 
it 
afterwards 
into 
the 
forme 
of 
a 
Dish, 
and 
filling 
it 
with 
Water, 
he 
shall 
finde 
that 
without 
the 
said 
Lead 
it 
shall 
not 
sinke, 
and 
that 
with 
the 
Lead 
it 
shall 
descend 
with 
much 
slowness: 
& 
in 
short 
he 
shall 
satisfie 
himself, 
that 
the 
Water 
included 
makes 
no 
alteration. 
I 
say 
not 
all 
this 
while, 
but 
that 
its 
possible 
of 
Wood 
to 
make 
Barkes, 
which 
being 
filled 
with 
water, 
sinke; 
but 
that 
proceeds 
not 
through 
its 
Gravity, 
encreased 
by 
the 
Water, 
but 
rather 
from 
the 
Nailes 
and 
other 
Iron 
Workes, 
so 
that 
it 
no 
longer 
hath 
a 
Body 
less 
grave 
than 
Water, 
but 
one 
mixt 
of 
Iron 
and 
Wood, 
more 
grave 
than 
a 
like 
Masse 
of 
Water. 
Therefore 
let 
Signor 
Buonamico 
desist 
from 
desiring 
a 
reason 
of 
an 
effect, 
that 
is 
not 
in 
nature: 
yea 
if 
the 
sinking 
of 
the 
Woodden 
Vessell 
when 
its 
full 
of 
Water, 
may 
call 
in 
question 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
Archimedes, 
which 
he 



would 
not 
have 
you 
to 
follow, 
is 
on 
the 
contrary 
consonant 
and 
agreeable 
to 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
the 
Peripateticks, 
since 
it 
aptly 
assignes 
a 
reason 
why 
such 
a 
Vessell 
must, 
when 
its 
full 
of 
Water, 
descend 
to 
the 
bottom; 
converting 
the 
Argument 
the 
other 
way, 
we 
may 
with 
safety 
say 
that 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
Archimedes 
is 
true, 
since 
it 
aptly 
agreeth 
with 
true 
experiments, 
and 
question 
the 
other, 
whose 
Deductions 
are 
fastened 
upon 
erroneouss 
Conclusions. 
As 
for 
the 
other 
point 
hinted 
in 
this 
same 
Instance, 
where 
it 
seemes 
that 
Benonamico 
understands 
the 
same 
not 
only 
of 
a 
piece 
of 
wood, 
shaped 
in 
the 
forme 
of 
a 
Vessell, 
but 
also 
of 
massie 
Wood, 
which 
filled, 
scilicet, 
as 
I 
believe, 
he 
would 
say, 
soaked 
and 
steeped 
in 
Water, 
goes 
finally 
to 
the 
bottom 
that 
happens 
in 
some 
porose 
Woods, 
which, 
while 
their 
Porosity 
is 
replenished 
with 
Air, 
or 
other 
Matter 
less 
grave 
than 
Water, 
are 
Masses 
specificially 
less 
grave 
than 
the 
said 
Water, 
like 
as 
is 
that 
Viall 
of 
Glass 
whilest 
it 
is 
full 
of 
Air: 
but 
when, 
such 
light 
Matter 
departing, 
there 
succeedeth 
Water 
into 
the 
same 
Porosities 
and 
Cavities, 
there 
results 
a 
compound 
of 
Water 
and 
Glass 
more 
grave 
than 
a 
like 
Mass 
of 
Water: 
but 
the 
excess 
of 
its 
Gravity 
consists 
in 
the 
Matter 
of 
the 
Glass, 
and 
not 
in 
the 
Water, 
which 
cannot 
be 
graver 
than 
it 
self: 
so 
that 
which 
remaines 
of 
the 
Wood, 
the 
Air 
of 
its 
Cavities 
departing, 
if 
it 
shall 
be 
more 
grave 
in 
specie 
than 
Water, 
fil 
but 
its 
Porosities 
with 
Water, 
and 
you 
shall 
have 
a 
Compost 
of 
Water 
and 
of 
Wood 
more 
grave 
than 
Water, 
but 
not 
by 
vertue 
of 
the 
Water 
received 
into 
and 
imbibed 
by 
the 
Porosities, 
but 
of 
that 
Matter 
of 
the 
Wood 
which 
remains 
when 
the 
Air 
is 
departed: 
and 
being 
such 
it 
shall, 
according 
to 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
Archimedes, 
goe 
to 
thebottom,like 
asbefore, 
according 
to 
thesame 
Doctrine 
it 
did 
swim. 


The 
Authors 
answer 
to 
the 
fourth 
Objection. 


As 
to 
that 
finally 
which 
presents 
itself 
in 
the 
fourth 
place, 
namely, 
that 
the 
Ancients 
have 
been 
heretofore 
confuted 
by 
Aristotle, 
who 
denying 
Positive 
and 
Absolute 
Levity, 
and 
truely 
esteeming 
all 
Bodies 
to 
be 
grave, 
said, 
that 
that 
which 
moved 
upward 
was 
driven 
by 
the 
circumambient 
Air, 
and 
therefore 
that 
also 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
Archimedes, 
as 
an 
adherent 
to 
such 
an 
Opinion 
was 
convicted 
and 
confuted: 
I 
answer 
first, 
that 
Signor 
Buonamico 
in 
my 
judgement 
hath 
imposed 
upon 
Archimedes, 
and 
deduced 
from 
his 
words 
more 
than 
ever 
he 
intended 
by 
them, 
or 
may 
from 
his 
Propositions 
be 



collected, 
in 
regard 
that 
Archimedes 
neither 
denies, 
nor 
admitteth 
Positive 
Levity, 
nor 
doth 
he 
so 
much 
as 
mention 
it: 
so 
that 
much 
less 
ought 
Buonamico 
to 
inferre, 
that 
he 
hath 
denyed 
that 
it 
might 
be 
the 
Cause 
and 
Principle 
of 
the 
Ascension 
of 
Fire, 
and 
other 
Light 
Bodies23: 
having 
but 
only 
demonstrated, 
that 
Solid 
Bodies 
more 
grave 
than 
Water 
descend 
in 
it, 
according 
to 
the 
excess 
of 
their 
Gravity 
above 
the 
Gravity 
of 
that, 
he 
demonstrates 
likewise, 
how 
the 
less 
grave 
ascend 
in 
the 
same 
Water24, 
accordng 
to 
its 
excess 
of 
Gravity, 
above 
the 
Gravity 
of 
them. 
So 
that 
the 
most 
that 
canbegatheredfromtheDemonstration 
of 
Archimedes 
is, 
that 
like 
as 
the 
excess 
of 
the 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Moveable 
above 
the 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Water, 
is 
the 
Cause 
that 
it 
descends 
therein, 
so 
the 
excess 
of 
the 
Gravityof 
thewater 
above 
that 
of 
the 
Moveable, 
is 
a 
sufficient 
Cause 
why 
it 
descends 
not, 
but 
rather 
betakes 
it 
self 
to 
swim: 
not 
enquiring 
whether 
of 
moving 
upwards 
there 
is, 
or 
is 
not 
any 
other 
Cause 
contrary 
to 
Gravity: 
nor 
doth 
Archimedes 
discourse 
less 
properly 
than 
if 
one 
should 
say: 
If 
the 
South 
Winde 
shall 
assault 
the 
Barke 
withgreater 
Impetus 
thanis 
the 
violence 
with 
whichthe 
Streame 
of 
the 
Rivercarriesit 
towardstheSouth,themotion 
ofitshall 
betowards 
the 
North: 
but 
if 
the 
Impetus 
of 
the 
Water 
shall 
overcome 
that 
of 
the 
Winde, 
its 
motion 
shall 
be 
towards 
the 
South. 
The 
discourse 
is 
excellent 
and 
would 
be 
unworthily 
contradicted 
by 
such 
as 
should 
oppose 
it, 
saying: 
Thou 
misalledgest 
as 
Cause 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Bark 
towards 
the 
South, 
the 
Impetus 
of 
the 
Stream 
of 
the 
Water 
above 
that 
of 
the 
South 
Winde; 
mis-alledgest 
I 
say, 
for 
it 
is 
the 
Force 
of 
the 
North 
Winde 
opposite 
to 
the 
South, 
that 
is 
able 
to 
drive 
the 
Bark 
towards 
the 
South. 
Such 
an 
Objection 
would 
be 
superfluous, 
because 
he 
which 
alledgeth 
for 
Cause 
of 
the 
Motion 
the 
Stream 
of 
the 
Water, 
denies 
not 
but 
that 
the 
Winde 
opposite 
to 
the 
South 
may 
do 
the 
same, 
but 
only 
affirmeth 
that 
the 
force 
of 
the 
Water 
prevailing 
over 
the 
South 
Wind,theBarkshallmovetowardstheSouth:andsaithno 
more 
thanis 
true. 


And 
just 
thus 
when 
Archimedes 
saith, 
that 
the 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Water 
prevailing 
over 
that 
by 
which 
the 
moveable 
descends 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
such 
moveable 
shall 
be 
raised 
from 
the 
Bottom 
to 
the 
Surface 
alledgeth 
a 
very 
true 
Cause 
of 
such 
an 
Accident, 
nor 
doth 
he 
affirm 
or 
deny 
that 
there 
is, 
or 
is 
not, 
a 
vertue 
contrary 
to 
Gravity, 
called 
by 
some 
Levity, 
that 
hath 
also 
a 
power 
of 
moving 
some 
Matters 
upwards. 
Let 
therefore 
the 
Weapons 
of 
Signor 
Buonamico 
be 
directed 
against 
Plato25, 
and 
other 
Ancients, 
who 
totally 
denying 
Levity, 
and 
taking 
all 
Bodies 
to 
be 
grave, 
say 
that 
the 
Motion 
upwards 
is 
made, 
not 
from 
an 
intrinsecal 
Principle 
of 
the 
Moveable, 
but 
only 



by 
the 
Impulse 
of 
the 
Medium; 
and 
let 
Archimedes 
and 
his 
Doctrine 
escape 
him, 
since 
he 
hath 
given 
him 
no 
Cause 
of 
quarelling 
with 
him. 
But 
if 
this 
Apologie, 
produced 
in 
defence 
of 
Archimedes, 
should 
seem 
to 
some 
insufficient 
to 
free 
him 
from 
the 
Objections 
and 
Arguments, 
produced 
by 
Aristotle 
against 
Plato, 
andtheother 
Ancients, 
as 
if 
they 
did 
also 
fight 
against 
Archimedes, 
alledging 
the 
Impulse 
of 
the 
Water 
as 
the 
Cause 
of 
the 
swimmingofsomeBodieslessgravethanit26, 
I 
would 
not 
question, 
but 
that 
I 
should 
be 
able 
to 
maintaine 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
Plato 
and 
those 
others 
to 
be 
most 
true, 
who 
absolutely 
deny 
Levity, 
and 
affirm 
no 
other 
Intrinsecal 
Principle 
of 
Motion 
to 
be 
in 
Elementary 
Bodies 
save 
only 
that 
towards 
the 
Centre 
of 
the 
Earth27, 
nor 
no 
other 
Cause 
of 
moving

speaking 
of 
that 
which 
hath 
the 
resemblance 
of 
natural 
Motion, 
but 
only 
the 
repulse 
of 
the 
Medium, 
fluid, 
and 
exceeding 
the 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Moveable28: 
and 
as 
to 
the 
Reasons 
of 
Aristotle 
on 
the 
contrary, 
I 
believe 
that 
I 
could 
be 
able 
fully 
to 
answer 
them, 
and 
I 
would 
assay 
to 
do 
it, 
if 
it 
were 
absolutely 
necessary 
to 
the 
present 
Matter, 
or 
were 
it 
not 
too 
long 
a 
Digression 
for 
this 
short 
Treatise. 
I 
will 
only 
say, 
that 
if 
there 
were 
in 
some 
of 
our 
Ellementary 
Bodies 
an 
Intrinsecall 
Principle 
and 
Naturall 
Inclination 
to 
shun 
the 
Centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
and 
to 
move 
towards 
the 
Concave 
of 
the 
Moon, 
such 
Bodies, 
without 
doubt, 
would 
more 
swiftly 
ascend 
through 
those 
Mediums 
that 
least 
oppose 
the 
Velocity 
of 
the 
Moveable, 
and 
these 
are 
the 
more 
tenuous 
and 
subtle; 
as 
is, 
for 
example, 
the 
Air 
in 
comparison 
of 
the 
Water, 
we 
daily 
proving 
that 
we 
can 
with 
farre 
more 
expeditious 
Velocity 
move 
a 
Hand 
or 
a 
Board 
to 
and 
again 
in 
one 
than 
in 
the 
other29: 
nevertheless, 
we 
never 
could 
finde 
any 
Body, 
that 
did 
not 
ascend 
much 
more 
swiftly 
in 
the 
water 
than 
in

Yea

that

much 
more

To 
that 
which 
for 
a 
finall 
conclusion, 
Signor 
Buonamico 
produceth 
of 
going 
about 
to 
reduce 
the 
descending 
or 
not 
descending, 
to 
the 
easie 
and 
uneasie 
Division 
of 
the 
Medium, 
and 
to 
the 
predominancy 
of 
the 
Elements: 
I 
answer, 
as 
to 
the 
first 
part, 
that 
that 
cannot 
in 
any 
manner 
be 
admitted 
as 
a 
Cause, 
being 
that 
in 
none 
of 
the 
Fluid 
Mediums, 
as 
the 
Air, 
the 
Water, 
and 
other 
Liquids, 
there 
is 
any 
Resistance 
against 
Division32, 
but 
all 
by 
every 
the 
least 
Force, 
are 
divided 
and 
penetrated, 
as 
I 
will 
anon 
demonstrate: 
so, 
that 
of 
such 
Resistance 
of 
Division 
there 
can 
be 
no 
Act, 
since 
it 
self 
is 
not 
in 
being. 
As 
to 
theother 
part, 
I 
say, 
that 
the 
predominancy 
of 
the 
Elements 
in 
Moveables33,is 
to 
be 
considered, 
as 
far 
as 
to 
the 
excesse 
or 
defect 
of 
Gravity, 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
Medium: 
for 
in 
that 
Action, 
the 
Elements 
operate 
not, 
but 
only, 
so 
far 
as 
they 
are 
grave 
or 
light: 
therefore, 
to 
say 
that 
the 
Wood 
of 
the 
Firre 
sinks 
not, 
because 
Air 
predominateth 
in 
it, 
is 
no 
more 
than 
to 
say, 
because 
it 
is 
less 
grave 
than 
the 
Water. 
Yea, 
even 
the 
immediate 
Cause, 
is 
its 
being 
less 
grave 



thantheWater34:andit 
being 
underthepredominancyof 
the 
Air, 
istheCause 
of 
its 
less 
Gravity: 
Therefore, 
he 
that 
alledgeth 
the 
predominancy 
of 
the 
Element 
for 
a 
Cause, 
brings 
the 
Cause 
of 
the 
Cause, 
and 
not 
the 
neerest 
and 
immediate 
Cause. 
Now, 
who 
knows 
not 
that 
the 
true 
Cause 
is 
the 
immediate, 
and 
not 
the 
mediate35? 
Moreover, 
he 
that 
alledgeth 
Gravity, 
brings 
a 
Cause 
most 
perspicuous 
to 
Sence36: 
The 
cause 
we 
may 
very 
easily 
assertain 
our 
selves; 
whether 
Ebony, 
for 
example, 
and 
Firre, 
be 
more 
or 
less 
grave 
than 
water: 
but 
whether 
Earth 
or 
Air 
predominates 
in 
them, 
who 
shall 
make 
that 
manifest? 


Certainly, 
no 
Experiment 
can 
better 
do 
it 
than 
to 
observe 
whether 
they 
swim 
or 
sink. 
So, 
that 
he 
who 
knows, 
not 
whether 
such 
a 
Solid 
swims, 
unless 
when 
he 
knows 
that 
Air 
predominates 
in 
it, 
knows 
not 
whether 
it 
swim, 
unless 
heseesitswim,forthenhe 
knowsthatitswims,whenheknowsthat 
it 
is 
Air 
that 
predominates, 
but 
knows 
not 
that 
Air 
hath 
the 
predominance, 
unless 
he 
sees 
it 
swim: 
therefore, 
he 
knows 
not 
if 
it 
swims, 
till 
such 
time 
as 
hehath 
seenit

The 
diversity 
of 
Figures 
given 
to 
this 
or 
that 
Solid, 
cannot 
any 
way 
be 
a 
Cause 
of 
its 
absolute 
Sinking 
or 
Swimming. 


So 
that 
if 
a 
Solid 
being 
formed, 
for 
example, 
into 
a 
Sphericall 
Figure, 
doth 
sink 
or 
swim 
in 
the 
water, 
I 
say, 
that 
being 
formed 
into 
any 
other 
Figure, 
the 
same 
figure 
in 
the 
same 
water, 
shall 
sink 
or 
swim: 
nor 
can 
such 
its 
Motion 
by 
theExpansion 
orbyothermutation 
ofFigure, 
beimpededortaken 
away. 


The 
Expansion 
of 
Figure, 
retards 
the 
Velocity 
of 
the 
ascent 
or 
descent 
of 
the 
Moveable 
in 
the 
water; 
but 
doth 
not 
deprive 
it 
of 
all 
Motion. 


The 
Expansion 
of 
the 
Figure 
may 
indeed 
retard 
its 
Velocity, 
aswell 
of 
ascent 
as 
descent, 
and 
more 
and 
more 
according 
as 
the 
said 
Figure 
is 
reduced 
to 
a 
greater 
breadth 
and 
thinness: 
but 
that 
it 
may 
be 
reduced 
to 
such 
a 
form 
as 
that 
that 
same 
matter 
be 
wholly 
hindred 
from 
moving 
in 
the 
same 
water, 
that 
I 
hold 
to 
be 
impossible. 
In 
this 
I 
have 
met 
with 
great 
contradictors, 
who 
producing 
some 
Experiments, 
and 
in 
perticular 
a 
thin 
Board 
of 
Ebony, 
and 
a 
Ball 
of 
the 
same 
Wood, 
and 
shewing 
how 
the 
Ball 
in 
Water 
descended 
to 
the 
bottom, 
and 
the 
Board 
being 
put 
lightly 
upon 
the 
Water 
submerged 
not, 
but 
rested; 
have 
held, 
and 
with 
the 
Authority 
of 
Aristotle, 
confirmed 
themselves 
in 
their 
Opinions, 
that 
the 
Cause 
of 
that 
Rest 
was 
the 
breadth 
of 
the 
Figure, 
u{n}able 
by 
its 
small 
weight 
to 
pierce 
and 
penetrate 
the 
Resistance 
of 
the 
Waters 
Crassitude, 
which 
Resistance 
is 
readily 
overcome 
by 
the 
other 
SphericallFigure. 


This 
is 
the 
Principal 
pointinthe 
presentQuestion,inwhichI 
perswademy 
self

Therefore, 
beginning 
to 
investigate 
with 
the 
examination 
of 
exquisite 
Experiments 
that 
reallythe 
Figuredoth 
not 
a 
jotalter 
thedescent 
orAscent 
of 



the 
same 
Solids, 
and 
having 
already 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
greater 
or 
less 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Solid 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Medium 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
Descent 
or 
Ascent: 
when 
ever 
we 
would 
make 
proof 
of 
that, 
which 
about 
this 
Effect 
the 
diversity 
of 
Figure 
worketh, 
its 
necessary 
to 
make 
the 
Experiment 
with 
Matter 
wherein 
variety 
of 
Gravities 
hath 
no 
place. 
For 
making 
use 
of 
Matters 
which 
may 
be 
different 
in 
their 
Specifical 
Gravities, 
and 
meeting 
with 
varieties 
of 
effects 
of 
Ascending 
and 
Descending, 
we 
shall 
alwayes 
be 
left 
unsatisfied 
whether 
that 
diversity 
derive 
it 
self 
really 
from 
the 
sole 
Figure, 
or 
else 
from 
the 
divers 
Gravity 
also. 
We 
may 
remedy 
this 
by 
takeing 
one 
only 
Matter, 
that 
is 
tractable 
and 
easily 
reduceable 
into 
every 
sort 
of 
Figure. 
Moreover, 
it 
will 
be 
an 
excellent 
expedient 
to 
take 
a 
kinde 
of 
Matter, 
exactly 
alike 
in 
Gravity 
unto 
the 
Water: 
for 
that 
Matter, 
as 
far 
as 
pertaines 
to 
the 
Gravity, 
is 
indifferent 
either 
to 
Ascend 
or 
Descend; 
so 
that 
we 
may 
presently 
observe 
any 
the 
least 
difference 
that 
derives 
it 
self 
from 
the 
diversityofFigure. 


An 
Experiment 
in 
Wax, 
that 
proveth 
Figure 
to 
have 
no 
Operation 
in 
Natation 
& 
Submersion. 


Now 
to 
do 
this, 
Wax 
is 
most 
apt, 
which, 
besides 
its 
incapacity 
of 
receiveing 
any 
sensiblealteration 
fromits 
imbibing 
of 
Water, 
is 
ductile 
or 
pliant, 
andthe 
same 
piece 
is 
easily 
reduceable 
into 
all 
Figures: 
and 
being 
in 
Specie 
a

inconsiderablematterinferiour

little

the 
fileings 
of

it 
is 
reduced 
to 
a 
Gravity 
exactly 
equall 
to 
that 
of 
theWater. 


This 
Matter 
prepared, 
and, 
for 
example, 
a 
Ball 
being 
made 
thereof 
as 
bigge 
as 
an 
Orange 
or 
biger, 
and 
that 
made 
so 
grave 
as 
to 
sink 
to 
the 
bottom, 
but 
so 
lightly, 
that 
takeing 
thence 
one 
only 
Grain 
of 
Lead, 
it 
returns 
to 
the 
top, 
and 
being 
added, 
it 
submergeth 
to 
the 
bottom, 
let 
the 
same 
Wax 
afterwards 
be 
made 
into 
a 
very 
broad 
and 
thin 
Flake 
or 
Cake; 
and 
then, 
returning 
to 
make 
the 
same 
Experiment, 
you 
shall 
see 
that 
it 
being 
put 
to 
the 
bottom, 
it 
shall, 
with 
the 
Grain 
of 
Leadrestbelow, 
and 
that 
Grain 
deducted, 
it 
shall 
ascend 
to 
the 
very 
Surface, 
and 
added 
again 
it 
shall 
dive 
to 
the 
bottom. 
And 
this 
same 
effect 
shall 
happen 
alwaies 
in 
all 
sort 
of 
Figures, 
as 
wel 
regular 
as 
irregular: 
nor 
shall 
you 
ever 
finde 
any 
that 
will 
swim 
without 
the 
removall 
of 
the 
Grain 
of 
Lead, 
or 
sinke 
to 
the 
bottom 
unless 
it 
be 
added: 
and, 
in 
short, 
about 
the 
going 
or 
not 
going 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
you 
shall 
discover 
no 



diversity, 
although, 
indeed, 
you 
shall 
about 
the 
quick 
and 
slow 
descent: 
for 
the 
more 
expatiated 
and 
distended 
Figures 
move 
more 
slowly 
aswel

the 
diveingtothebottom 
asintherisingto 
thetop;and 
the 
other 
more 
contracted 
and 
compact 
Figures, 
more

Now 
I 
know 
not 
what 
may 
be 
expected 
from 
the 
diversity 
of 
Figures,

to 
raise 
a 
doubt 
upon 
my 
producedExperiment40. 
And 
first 
that 
they 
offer 
to 
my 
consideration, 
that 
the 
Figure, 
as 
a 
Figure 
simply, 
and 
disjunct 
from 
the 
Matter 
workes 
not 
any 
effect, 
but 
requires 
to 
be 
conjoyned 
with 
the 
Matter; 
and, 
furthermore, 
not 
with 
every 
Matter, 
but 
with 
those 
only, 
wherewith 
it 
may 
be 
able 
to 
execute 
the 
desired 
operation. 
Like 
as 
we 
see 
it 
verified 
by 
Experience, 
that 
the 
Acute 
and 
sharp 
Angle 
is 
more 
apt 
to 
cut, 
than 
the 
Obtuse; 
yet 
alwaies 
provided, 
that 
both 
the 
one 
and 
the 
other, 
be 
joyned 
with 
a 
Matter 
apt 
to 
cut, 
as 
for 
example, 
with 
Steel. 
Therefore, 
a 
Knife 
with 
a 
fine 
and 
sharp 
edge, 
cuts 
Bread 
or 
Wood 
with 
much 
ease, 
which 
it 
will 
not 
do, 
if 
the 
edge 
be 
blunt 
and 
thick: 
but 
he 
that 
will 
instead 
of 
Steel, 
take 
Wax, 
and 
mould 
it 
into 
a 
Knife, 
undoubtedly 
shall 
never 
know 
the 
effects 
of 
sharp 
and 
blunt 
edges: 
because 
neither 
of 
them 
will 
cut, 
the 
Wax 
being 
unable 
by 
reason 
of 
its 
flexibility, 
to 
overcome 
the 
hardness 
of 
the 
Wood 
and 
Bread. 
And, 
therefore, 
applying 
the 
like 
discoursetoourpurpose,they 
say, 
thatthedifferenceofFigure 
willshew 
different 
effects, 
touching 
Natation 
and 
Submersion, 
but 
not 
conjoyned 
with 
any 
kind 
of 
Matter, 
but 
only 
with 
those 
Matters 
which, 
by 
their 
Gravity, 
are 
apt 
to 
resist 
the 
Velocity 
of 
the 
water, 
whence 
he 
that 
would 
elect 
for 
the 
Matter, 
Cork 
or 
other 
light 
wood, 
unable, 
through 
its 
Levity, 
to 
superate 
the 
Crassitude 
of 
the 
water, 
and 
of 
that 
Matter 
should 
forme 
Solids 
of 
divers 
Figures, 
would 
in 
vain 
seek 
to 
find 
out 
what 
operation 
Figure 
hath 
in 
Natation 
or 
Submersion; 
because 
all 
would 
swim, 
and 
that 
not 
through 
any 
property 
of 
this 
or 
that 
Figure, 
but 
through 
the 
debility 
of 
the 
Matter, 
wanting 
so 
much 
Gravity, 
as 
is 
requisite 
to 
superate 
and 
overcome 
the 
Density 
and 
Crassitude 
ofthewater.

An

Its 
needfull, 
therefore, 
if 
wee 
would 
see 
the 
effect 
wrought 
by 
the 
Diversity 
of 
Figure, 
first 
to 
make 
choice 
of 
a 
Matter 
of 
its 
nature 
apt 
to 
penetrate 
the 
Crassitude 
of 
the 
water. 
And, 
for 
this 
effect41, 
they 
have 
made 
choice 
of 
such 
a 
Matter, 
as 
fit, 
that 
being 
readily 
reduced 
into 
Sphericall 



Figure, 
goes 
to 
the 
Bottom; 
and 
it 
is 
Ebony, 
of 
which 
they 
afterwards 
making 
a 
small 
Board 
or 
Splinter, 
as 
thin 
as 
a 
Lath, 
have 
illustrated 
how 
that 
this, 
put 
upon 
the 
Surface 
of 
the 
water, 
rests 
there 
without 
descending 
to 
the 
Bottom: 
and 
making, 
on 
the 
otherside, 
of 
the 
same 
wood 
a 
Ball, 
no 
less 
than 
a 
hazell 
Nut, 
they 
shew, 
that 
this 
swims 
not, 
but 
descendes. 
From 
which 
Experiment, 
they 
think 
they 
may 
frankly 
conclude, 
that 
the 
Breadth 
of 
the 
Figure 
in 
the 
flat 
Lath 
or 
Board, 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
its 
not 
descending 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
for 
as 
much 
as 
a 
Ball 
of 
the 
same 
Matter, 
not 
different 
from 
the 
Board 
in 
any 
thing 
butin 
Figure,submergeth 
in 
thesame 
water 
to 
theBottom. 
The 
discourse 
and 
the 
Experiment 
hath 
really 
so 
much 
of 
probability 
and 
likelyhood 
of 
truth 
in 
it, 
that 
it 
would 
be 
no 
wonder, 
if 
many 
perswaded 
by 
a 
certain 
cursory 
observation, 
should 
yield 
credit 
to 
it; 
nevertheless, 
I 
think 
I 
am 
able 
to 
discover,howthatitisnotfreefromfalacy. 


41 
An 
ExperimentinEbany,broughttodisprovetheExperiment 
in 
Wax. 


Beginning, 
therefore, 
to 
examine 
one 
by 
one, 
all 
the 
particulars 
that 
have 
been 
produced, 
I 
say, 
that 
Figures, 
as 
simple 
Figures, 
not 
only 
operate 
not 
in 
naturall 
things, 
but 
neither 
are 
they 
ever 
seperated 
from 
the 
Corporeall 
substance42: 
nor 
have 
I 
ever 
alledged 
them 
stript 
of 
sensible 
Matter, 
like 
as 
also 
I 
freely 
admit, 
that 
in 
our 
endeavouring 
to 
examine 
the 
Diversity 
of 
Accidents, 
dependant 
upon 
the 
variety 
of 
Figures, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
apply 
them 
to 
Matters, 
which 
obstruct 
not 
the 
various 
operations 
of 
those 
various 
Figures:andIadmit 
and 
grant,thatI 
should 
dovery 
ill;ifI 
would 
experiment 
the 
influence 
of 
Acutenesse 
of 
edge 
with 
a 
Knife 
of 
Wax, 
applying 
it 
to 
cut 
an 
Oak, 
because 
there 
is 
no 
Acuteness 
in 
Wax 
able 
to 
cut 
that 
very 
hard 
wood. 


But 
yet 
such 
an 
Experiment 
of 
this 
Knife, 
would 
not 
be 
besides 
the 
purpose, 
to 
cut 
curded 
Milk, 
or 
other 
very 
yielding 
Matter: 
yea, 
in 
such 
like 
Matters, 
the 
Wax 
is 
more 
commodious 
than 
Steel; 
for 
finding 
the 
diversity 
depending 
upon 
Angles, 
more 
or 
less 
Acute, 
for 
that 
Milk 
is 
indifferently 
cut 
with 
a 
Raisor, 
and 
with 
a 
Knife, 
that 
hath 
a 
blunt 
edge. 
It 
needs, 
therefore, 
that 
regard 
be 
had, 
not 
only 
to 
the 
hardness, 
solidity 
or 
Gravity 
of 
Bodies, 
which 
under 
divers 
figures, 
are 
to 
divide 
and 
penetrate 
some 
Matters, 
but 
it 
forceth 
also, 
that 
regard 
be 
had, 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
to 
the 
Resistance 
of 
the 
Matters, 
to 
be 
divided 
and 
penetrated. 
But 
since 
I 
have 
in 
making 
the 
Experiment 
concerning 
our 
Contest; 
chosen 
a 
Matter 
which 
penetrates 
the 
Resistance 
of 
the 
water; 
and 
in 
all 
figures 
descendes 
to 
the 
Bottome, 
the 



Adversaries 
can 
charge 
me 
with 
no 
defect; 
yea, 
I 
have 
propounded 
so 
much 
a 
more 
excellent 
Method 
than 
they, 
in 
as 
much 
as 
I 
have 
removed 
all 
other 
Causes, 
of 
descending 
or 
not 
descending 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
and 
retained 
the 
only 
sole 
and 
pure 
variety 
of 
Figures, 
demonstrating 
that 
the 
same 
Figures 
all 
descende 
with 
the 
only 
alteration 
of 
a 
Grain 
in 
weight: 
which 
Grain 
being 
removed, 
they 
return 
to 
float 
and 
swim; 
it 
is 
not 
true, 
therefore, 
(resuming 
the 
Example 
by 
them 
introduced) 
that 
I 
have 
gon{e} 
about 
to 
experiment 
the 
efficacy 
of 
Acuteness, 
in 
cutting 
with 
Matters 
unable 
to 
cut, 
but 
with 
Matters 
proportioned 
to 
our 
occasion, 
since 
they 
are 
subjected 
to 
no 
other 
variety, 
thenthatalonewhichdependsontheFiguremoreorlessacute.

The 
answer 
to 
the 
Objection 
against 
the 
Experiment 
of 
the 
Wax. 


But 
let 
us 
proceed 
a 
little 
farther, 
and 
observe, 
how 
that 
indeed 
the 
Consideration, 
which, 
they 
say, 
ought 
to 
be 
had 
about 
the 
Election 
of 
the 
Matter, 
to 
the 
end, 
that 
it 
may 
be 
proportionate 
for 
the 
making 
of 
our 
experiment, 
is 
needlessly 
introduced, 
declaring 
by 
the 
example 
of 
Cutting, 
that 
like 
as 
Acuteness 
is 
inefficient 
to 
cut, 
unless 
when 
it 
is 
in 
a 
Matter 
hard 
and 
apt 
to 
superate 
the 
Resistance 
of 
the 
wood 
or 
other 
Matter, 
which 
we 
intend 
to 
cut; 
so 
the 
aptitude 
of 
descending 
or 
not 
descending 
in 
water, 
ought 
and 
can 
only 
be 
known 
in 
those 
Matters, 
that 
are 
able 
to 
overcome 
the 
Renitence,and 
superate 
the 
Crassitudeof 
thewater. 
Untowhich, 
I 
say, 
that 
to 
make 
distinction 
and 
election, 
more 
of 
this 
than 
of 
that 
Matter, 
on 
which 
to 
impress 
the 
Figures 
for 
cutting 
or 
penetrating 
this 
or 
that 
Body, 
as 
the 
solidity 
or 
obdurateness 
of 
the 
said 
Bodies 
shall 
be 
greater 
or 
less, 
is 
very 
necessary: 
but 
withall 
I 
subjoyn, 
that 
such 
distinction, 
election 
and 
caution 
would 
be 
superfluous 
and 
unprofitable, 
if 
the 
Body 
to 
be 
cut 
or 
penetrated, 
should 
have 
no 
Resistance, 
or 
should 
not 
at 
all 
withstand 
the 
Cutting 
or 
Penitration: 
and 
if 
the 
Knife 
were 
to 
be 
used 
in 
cutting 
a 
Mist 
or 
Smoak, 
one 
of 
Paper 
would 
be 
equally 
serviceable 
with 
one 
of 
Damascus 
Steel: 
and 
so 
by 
reason 
the 
water 
hath 
not 
any 
Resistance 
against 
the 
Penitration 
of 
any 
Solid 
Body, 
all 
choice 
of 
Matter 
is 
superfluous 
and 
needless, 
and 
the 
Election 
which 
I 
said 
above 
to 
have 
been 
well 
made 
of 
a 
Matter 
reciprocall 
in 
Gravity 
to 
water, 
was 
not 
because 
it 
was 
necessary, 
for 
the 
overcoming 
of 
the 
crassitude 
of 
the 
water, 
but 
its 
Gravity, 
with 
which 
only 
it 
resists 
the 
sinking 
of 
Solid 
Bodies: 
and 
for 
what 
concerneth 
the 
Resistance 
of 
the 
crassitude, 
if 
we 
narrowly 
consider 
it, 



we 
shall 
find 
that 
all 
Solid 
Bodies, 
as 
well 
those 
that 
sink, 
as 
those 
that 
swim, 
are 
indifferently 
accomodated 
and 
apt 
to 
bring 
us 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
truth 
in 
question. 
Nor 
will 
I 
be 
frighted 
out 
of 
the 
belief 
of 
these 
Conclusions, 
by 
the 
Experiments 
which 
may 
be 
produced 
against 
me, 
of 
many 
severall 
Woods, 
Corks, 
Galls, 
and, 
moreover, 
of 
subtle 
slates 
and 
plates 
of 
all 
sorts 
of 
Stone 
and 
Mettall, 
apt 
by 
means 
of 
their 
Naturall 
Gravity, 
to 
move 
towards 
the 
Centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
the 
which, 
nevertheless, 
being 
impotent, 
either 
throughtheFigure(astheAdversariesthinke)or 
through 
Levity,to 
break 
and 
penetrate 
the 
Continuity 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
water, 
and 
to 
distract 
its 
union, 
do 
continue 
to 
swimm 
without 
submerging 
in 
the 
least: 
nor 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
shall 
the 
Authority 
of 
Aristotle 
move 
me, 
who 
in 
more 
than 
one 
place, 
affirmeththecontrarytothis,whichExperience 
shewsme. 


No 
Solid 
of 
such 
Levity, 
nor 
of 
such 
Figure, 
but 
that 
it 
doth 
penetrate 
the 
Crassitude 
of 
the 
Water. 


Bodies 
of 
all 
Figures, 
laid 
upon 
the 
water, 
do 
penetrate 
its 
Crassitude, 
and 
in 
what 
proportion. 


I 
return, 
therefore, 
to 
assert, 
that 
there 
is 
not 
any 
Solid 
of 
such 
Levity, 
nor 
of 
such 
Figure, 
that 
being 
put 
upon 
the 
water, 
doth 
not 
divide 
and 
penetrate 
its 
Crassitude: 
yea 
if 
any 
with 
a 
more 
perspicatious 
eye, 
shall 
return 
to 
observe 
more 
exactly 
the 
thin 
Boards 
of 
Wood, 
he 
shall 
see 
them 
to 
be 
with 
part 
of 
their 
thickness 
under 
water, 
and 
not 
only 
with 
their 
inferiour 
Superficies, 
to 
kissetheSuperiourofthewater,as 
theyofnecessity 
musthavebelieved, 
who 
have 
said, 
that 
such 
Boards 
submerge 
not, 
as 
not 
being 
able 
to 
divide 
the 
Tenacity 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
water: 
and, 
moreover, 
he 
shall 
see, 
that 
subtle 
shivers 
of 
Ebony, 
Stone 
or 
Metall, 
when 
they 
float, 
have 
not 
only 
broak 
the 
Continuity 
of 
the 
water, 
but 
are 
with 
all 
their 
thickness, 
under 
the 
Surface 
of 
it; 
and 
more 
and 
more, 
according 
as 
the 
Matters 
are 
more 
grave: 
so 
that 
a 
thin 
Plate 
of 
Lead, 
shall 
be 
lower 
than 
the 
Surface 
of 
the 
circumfused 
water, 
by 
at 
least 
twelve 
times 
the 
thickness 
of 
the 
Plate, 
and 
Gold 
shall 
dive 
below 
the 
Levell 
of 
the 
water, 
almost 
twenty 
times 
the 
thickness 
of 
the 
Plate, 
as 
I 
shall 
anondeclare. 


But 
let 
us 
proceed 
to 
evince, 
that 
the 
water 
yields 
and 
suffers 
it 
self 
to 
be 
penetrated 
by 
every 
the 
lightest 
Body; 
and 
therewithall 
demonstrate, 
how, 
even 
by 
Matters 
that 
submerge 
not, 
we 
may 
come 
to 
know 
that 
Figure 



operates 
nothing 
about 
the 
going 
or 
not 
going 
to

you 
shall

shall 
it

lye

which 
shall 
be 
manifest, 
first, 
that

out 
of 
an 
inability 
to

having 
already 
divided

in 
the 
other 
Experiment 
are 
equall 
to 
an 
hair: 
whence 
he 
may 
manifestly 
conclude, 
that 
the 
acute 
Figure 
which 
seemed 
most 
apt 
to 
part 
and 
penetrate 
the 
water, 
doth 
not 
part 
or 
penetrate 
it 
more 
than 
the 
large 
and 
spacious. 


And 
he 
that 
would 
have 
a 
more 
easie 
Experiment, 
let 
him 
take 
two 
Cylinders 
of 
the 
same 
Matter, 
one 
long 
and 
small, 
and 
the 
other 
short, 
but 
very 
broad, 
and 
let 
him 
put 
them 
in 
the 
water, 
not 
distended, 
but 
erect 
and 
endways: 
he 
shall 
see, 
if 
he 
diligently 
measure 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
one 
and 
of 
the 
other, 
that 
in 
each 
of 
them 
the 
part 
submerged, 
retains 
exactly 
the 
same 
proportion 
to 
that 
out 
of 
the 
water, 
and 
that 
no 
greater 
part 
is 
submerged 
of 
that 
long 
and 
small 
one, 
than 
of 
the 
other 
more 
spacious 
and 
broad: 
howbeit, 
this 
rests 
upon 
a 
very 
large, 
and 
that 
upon 
a 
very 
little 
Superficies

be 
the

or

He 
may 
likewise 
discover 
the 
non 
operating 
of 
variety 
of 
Figures, 
in 
arising 
from 
the 
Bottom 
of 
the 
water, 
towards 
the 
Surface, 
by 
taking 
Wax, 
and 
tempering 
it 
with 
a 
competent 
quantity 
of 
the 
filings 
of 
Lead, 
so 
that 
it 
may 
become 
a 
considerable 
matter 



graver 
than 
the 
water: 
then 
let 
him 
make 
it 
into 
a 
Ball, 
and 
thrust 
it 
unto 
the 
Bottom 
of 
the 
water; 
and 
fasten 
to 
it 
as 
much 
Cork, 
or 
other 
light 
matter, 
as 
just 
serveth 
to 
raise 
it, 
and 
draw 
it 
towards 
the 
Surface: 
for 
afterwards 
changing 
the 
same

into 
a 
thin 
Cake, 
or 
into 
any 
other 
Figure,

This 
silenceth 
not 
my 
Antagonists, 
but 
they 
say, 
that 
all 
the 
discourse 
hitherto 
made 
by 
me 
little 
importeth 
to 
them, 
and 
that 
it 
serves 
their 
turn, 
that 
they 
have 
demonstrated 
in 
one 
only 
particular, 
and 
in 
what 
matter, 
and 
under 
what 
Figure 
pleaseth 
them, 
namely, 
in 
a 
Board 
and 
in 
a 
Ball 
of 
Ebony, 
that 
this 
putinthe 
water, 
descends 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
and 
that 
staysatop 
to 
swim: 
and 
the 
Matter 
being 
the 
same, 
and 
the 
two 
Bodies 
differing 
in 
nothing 
but 
in 
Figure, 
they 
affirm, 
that 
they 
have 
with 
all 
perspicuity 
demonstrated 
and 
sensibly 
manifested 
what 
they 
undertook; 
and 
lastly, 
that 
they 
have 
obtained 
their 
intent. 
Nevertheless, 
I 
believe, 
and 
thinke, 
I 
can 
demonstrate, 
that 
that 
sameExperimentprovethnothingagainstmyConclusion. 


In 
Experiments 
of 
Natation, 
the 
Solid 
is 
to 
be 
put 
into, 
not 
upon 
the 
water. 


And 
first, 
it 
is 
false, 
that 
the 
Ball 
descends, 
and 
the 
Board 
not: 
for 
the 
Board

alsodescend, 
if

The 
Question 
of 
Natation 
stated. 


The 
words 
were 
these. 
That 
the 
Antagonists 
having 
an 
opinion, 
that 
the 
Figure 
would 
alter 
the 
Solid 
Bodies, 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
descending 
or 
not 
descending, 
ascending 
or 
not 
ascending 
in 
the 
same 
Medium, 
as 
v. 
gr. 
in 
the 
same 
water, 
in 
such 
sort, 
that, 
for 
Example, 
a 
Solid 
that 
being 
of 
a 
Sphericall 
Figure, 
shall 
descend 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
being 
reduced 
into 
some 
other 
Figure, 
shall 
not 
descend: 
I 
holding 
the 
contrary, 
do 
affirm, 
that 
a 
Corporeall 
Solid 
Body, 
which 
reduced 
into 
a 
Sphericall 
Figure, 
or 
any 
other, 
shall 
go

Bottom, 
shall 
do

The 
which 
is 
again 
made 
manifest, 
by 
the 
questions 
being 
put 
as 
well 
about 
the 
things 
which 
go 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
as 
those 
which 
arise 
from 
the 
Bottom 
to 
swimme, 
and 
who 
sees 
not 
that 
things 
placed 
in 
the 
Bottom, 
must 
have 
water 
about 
them. 


The 
confutation 
of 
the 
Experiment 
in 
the 
Ebany. 


It 
is 
now 
to 
be 
noted, 
that 
the 
Board 
of 
Ebany 
and 
the 
Ball, 
put 
into 
the 
water, 
both 
sink, 
but 
the 
Ball 
more 
swiftly, 
and 
the 
Board 
more 
slowly; 
and 
slower 
and 
slower, 
according 
as 
it 
shall 
be 
more 
broad 
and 
thin, 
and 
of 
this 
Tardity 
the 
breadth 
of 
the 
Figure 
is 
the 
true 
Cause: 
But 
these 
broad 
Boards 
that 
slowly 
descend, 
are 
the 
same, 
that 
being 
put 
lightly 
upon 
the 
water, 
do 
swimm: 
Therefore, 
if 
that 
were 
true 
which 
the 
Adversaries 
affirm, 
the 
same 
numerical 
Figure, 
would 
in 
the 
same 
numericall 
water, 
cause 
one 
while 
Rest, 
and 
another 
while 
Tardity 
of 
Motion, 
which 
is 
impossible: 
for 
every 
perticular 
Figure 
which 
descends 
to 
the 
Bottom43, 
hath 
of 
necessity 
its 
own 
determinate 
Tardity 
and 
slowness, 
proper 
and 
naturall 
unto 
it, 
according 
to 
which 
it 
moveth, 
so 
that 
every 
other 
Tardity, 
greater 
or 
lesser 
is 
improper 
to 
its 
nature: 
if, 
therefore, 
a 
Board, 
as 
suppose 
of 
a 
foot 
square, 
descendeth 
naturally 
with 
six 
degrees 
of 
Tardity, 
it 
is 
impossible, 
that 
it 
should 
descend 
with 
ten 
or 
twenty, 
unless 
some 
new 
impediment 
do 
arrest 
it. 
Much 
less 
can 
it, 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
same 
Figure 
rest, 
and 
wholly 
cease 
to 
move; 
but 
it 
is 
necessary, 
that 
when 
ever 
it 
resteth, 
there 
do 
some 
greater 
impediment 
intervene 
than 
the 
breadth 
of 
the 
Figure. 
Therefore, 
it 
must 
be 
somewhat 
else, 
and 
not 
the 
Figure, 
that 
stayeth 
the 
Board 
of 
Ebany 
above 
water, 
of 
which 
Figure 
the 
only 
Effect 
is 
the 
retardment 
of 
the 
Motion, 
according 
to 
which 
it 
descendeth 
more 
slowly 
than 
the 
Ball. 
Let 
it 
be 
confessed, 
therefore, 



rationally 
discoursing, 
that 
the 
true 
and 
sole 
Cause 
of 
the 
Ebanys 
going 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
is 
the 
excess 
of 
its 
Gravity 
above 
the 
Gravity 
of 
the 
water: 
and 
the 
Cause 
of 
the 
greater 
or 
less 
Tardity, 
the 
breadth 
of 
this 
Figure, 
or 
the 
contractedness 
of 
that: 
but 
of 
its 
Rest, 
it 
can 
by 
no 
means 
be 
allowed, 
that 
the 
quallity 
of 
the 
Figure, 
is 
the 
Cause 
thereof: 
aswell, 
because, 
making 
the 
Tardity 
greater, 
according 
as 
the 
Figure 
more 
dilateth, 
there 
cannot 
be 
so 
immense 
a 
Dilatation, 
to 
which 
there 
may 
not 
be 
found 
a 
correspondent 
immence 
Tardity 
without 
redusing 
it 
to 
Nullity 
of 
Motion; 
as, 
because 
the 
Figures 
produced 
by 
the 
Antagonists 
for 
effecters 
of 
Rest, 
are 
the 
self 
same 
that 
doalsogo 
totheBottom.

I 
will 
not 
omit 
another 
reason, 
founded 
also 
upon 
Experience, 
and 
if 
I 
deceive 
not 
my 
self, 
manifestly 
concluding, 
how 
that 
the 
Introduction 
of 
the 
breadth 
or 
amplitude 
of 
Figure, 
and 
the 
Resistance 
of 
the 
water 
against 
penetration, 
have 
nothing 
to 
do 
in 
the 
Effect 
of 
descending, 
or 
ascending, 
or 
resting 
in 
the 
water. 
DTake 
a 
piece 
of 
wood 
or 
other 
Matter, 
of 
which 
a 
Ball 
ascends 
from 
the 
Bottom 
of 
the 
water 
to 
the 
Surface, 
more 
slowly 
than 
a 
Ball 
of 
Ebony 
of 
the 
same 
bignesse, 
so 
that 
it 
is 
manifest, 
that 
the 
Ball 
of 
Ebony 
more 
readily 
divideth 
the 
water 
in 
descending, 
than 
the 
other 
in 
ascending; 
as 
for 
Example, 
let 
the 
Wood 
be 
Walnut-tree. 
Then 
take 
a 
Board 
of 
Walnut-tree, 
like 
and 
equall 
to 
that 
of 
Ebony 
of 
the 
Antagonists, 
which 
swims; 
and 
if 
it 
be 
true, 
that 
this 
floats 
above 
water, 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
Figure, 
unable 
through 
its 
breadth, 
to 
pierce 
the 
Crassitude 
of 
the 
same, 
the 
other 
of 
Wallnut-tree, 
without 
all 
question, 
being 
thrust 
unto 
the 
Bottom, 
will 
stay 
there, 
as 
less 
apt, 
through 
the 
same 
impediment 
of 
Figure, 
to 
divide 
the 
said 
Resistance 
of 
the 
water. 
But 
if 
we 
shall 
find, 
and 
by 
experience 
see, 
that 
not 
only 
the 
thin 
Board, 
but 
every 
other 
Figure 
of 
the 
same 
Wallnut-tree 
will 
return 
to 
float, 
as 
undoubtedly 
we 
shall, 
then 
I 
must 
desier 
my 
opposers 
to 
forbear 
to 
attribute 
the 
floating 
of 
the 
Ebony, 
unto 
the 
Figure 
of 
the 
Board, 
in 
regard 
that 
the 
Resistance 
of 
the 
water 
is 
the 
same, 
as 
well 
to 
the 
ascent, 
as 
to 
the 
descent, 
and 
the 
force 
of 
the 
Wallnut-trees 
ascension, 
is 
lesse 
than 
the 
Ebonys 
force 
in 
goingtotheBottom. 


D 
The 
Figure 
& 
Resistance 
of 
the 
Medium 
against 
Division, 
have 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
Effect 
of 
Natation 
or 
Submersion, 
by 
an 
Experiment 
in 
Wallnuttree. 



An 
Experiment 
in 
Gold, 
to 
prove 
the 
non-operating 
of 
Figure 
in 
Natation 
and 


Submersion. 


Nay, 
I 
will 
say 
more, 
that 
if 
we 
shall 
consider 
Gold 
in 
comparison 
of 
water, 
we 
shall 
find, 
that 
it 
exceeds 
it 
in 
Gravity 
almost 
twenty 
times, 
so 
that 
the 
Force 
and 
Impetus, 
wherewith 
a 
Ball 
of 
Gold 
goes 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
is 
very 
great. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
there 
want 
not 
matters, 
as 
Virgins 
Wax, 
and 
some 
Woods, 
which 
are 
not 
above 
a 
fiftieth 
part 
less 
grave 
than 
water, 
whereupon 
their 
Ascension 
therein 
is 
very 
slow, 
and 
a 
thousand 
times 
weaker 
than 
the 
Impetus 
of 
the 
Golds 
descent: 
yet 
notwithstanding, 
a 
plate 
of 
Gold 
swims 
without 
descending 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
and, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
we 
cannot 
make 
a 
Cake 
of 
Wax, 
or 
thin 
Board 
of 
Wood, 
which 
put 
in 
the 
Bottom 
of 
the 
Water, 
shall 
rest 
there 
without 
ascending. 
Now 
if 
the 
Figure 
can 
obstruct 
the 
Penetration, 
and 
impede 
the 
descent 
of 
Gold, 
that 
hath 
so 
great 
an 
Impetus, 
how 
can 
it 
choose 
but 
suffice 
to 
resist 
the 
same 
Penetration 
of 
the 
other 
matter 
in 
ascending, 
when 
as 
it 
hath 
scarce 
a 
thousandth 
part 
of 
the 
Impetus 
that 
the 
Gold 
hath 
in 
descending? 
Its 
therefore, 
necessary, 
that 
that 
which 
suspends 
the 
thin 
Plate 
of 
Gold, 
or 
Board 
of 
Ebony, 
upon 
the 
water, 
be 
some 
thing 
that 
is 
wanting 
to 
the 
other 
Cakes 
and 
Boards 
of 
Matters 
less 
grave 
than 
the 
water; 
since 
that 
being 
put 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
and 
left 
at 
liberty, 
they 
rise 
up 
to 
the 
Surface, 
without 
any 
obstruction: 
But 
they 
want 
not 
for 
flatness 
and 
breadth 
of 
Figure: 
Therefore, 
the 
spaciousnesse 
of 
the 
Figure, 
is 
not 
that 
which 
makestheGoldandEbonytoswim. 


And, 
because, 
that 
the 
excess 
of 
their 
Gravity 
above 
the 
Gravity 
of 
the 
water, 
is 
questionless 
the 
Cause 
of 
the 
sinking 
of 
the 
flat 
piece 
of 
Ebony, 
and 
the 
thin 
Plate 
of 
Gold, 
when 
they 
go 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
therefore, 
of 
necessity, 
when 
they 
float, 
the 
Cause 
of 
their 
staying 
above 
water, 
proceeds 
from 
Levity, 
which 
in 
that 
case, 
by 
some 
Accident, 
peradventure 
not 
hitherto 
observed, 
cometh 
to 
meet 
with 
the 
said 
Board, 
rendering 
it 
no 
longer 
as 
it 
was 
before,whilstitdidsinkmoreponderousthanthewater,butless. 


Now, 
let 
us 
return 
to 
take 
the 
thin 
Plate 
of 
Gold, 
or 
of 
Silver, 
or 
the 
thin 
Board 
of 
Ebony, 
and 
let 
us 
lay 
it 
lightly 
upon 
the 
water, 
so 
that 
it 
stay 
there 
withoutsinking,anddiligentlyobserveitseffect. 


And 
first, 
see 
how 
false 
the 
assertion 
of 
Aristotle, 
and 
our 
oponents 
is, 
to 
wit, 
that 
it 
stayeth 
above 
water, 
through 
its 
unability 
to 
pierce 
and 
penetrate 
theResistanceofthe 
waters 
Crassitude:for 
it 
will 
manifestly 
appear, 
not 
only 
that 
the 
said 
Plates 
have 
penetrated 
the 
water, 
but 
also 
that 
they 
are 
a 



considerable 
matter 
lower 
than 
the 
Surface 
of 
the 
same, 
the 
which 
continueth 
eminent, 
and 
maketh 
as 
it 
were 
a 
Rampert 
on 
all 
sides, 
round 
about 
the 
said 
Plates, 
the 
profundity 
of 
which 
they 
stay 
swimming: 
and, 
according 
as 
the 
said 
Plates 
shall 
be 
more 
grave 
than 
the 
water, 
two, 
four, 
ten 
or 
twenty 
times, 
it 
is 
necessary, 
that 
their 
Superficies 
do 
stay 
below 
the 
universall 
Surface 
of 
the 
water, 
so 
much 
more, 
than 
the 
thickness 
of 
those 
Plates, 
as 
we 
shal 
more 
distinctly 
shew 
anon. 
In 
the 
mean 
space, 
for 
the 
more 
easie 
understanding 
of 
what 
I 
say, 
observe 
with 
me 
a 
little 
the 
present 
Scheme: 
in 
which 
let 
us 
suppose 
the 
Surface 
of 
the 
water 
to 
be 
distended, 
according 
to 
the 
Lines 
F 
L 
D 
B, 
upon 
which 
if 
one 
shall 
put 
a 
board 
of 
matter 
specifically 
more 
grave 
than 
water, 
but 
so 
lightly 
that 
it 
submerge 
not, 
it 
shall 
not 
rest 
any 
thing 
above, 
but 
shall 
enter 
with 
its 
whole 
thickness 
into 
the 
water: 
and, 
moreover, 
shall 
sink 
also, 
as 
wesee 
by 
the 
Board 
A 
I, 
O 
I, 
whose 
breadth 
is 
wholly 
sunk 
into 
the 
water, 
the 
little 
Ramperts 
of 
water 
L 
A 
and 
D 
O 
incompassing 
it, 
whose 
Superficies 
is 
notably 
higher 
than 
the 
Superficies 
of 
the 
Board. 
See 
now 
whether 
it 
be 
true, 
that 
the 
said 
Board 
goes 
not 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
as 
being 


ofFigureunapttopenetratetheCrassitudeofthewater.
Why 
solids 
having 
penitrated 
the 
Water, 
do 
not 
proceed 
to 
a 
totall 
Submersion. 


But, 
if 
it 
hath 
already 
penetrated, 
and 
overcome 
the 
Continuity 
of 
the 
water, 
& 
is 
of 
its 
own 
nature 
more 
grave 
than 
the 
said 
water, 
why 
doth 
it 
not 
proceed 
in 
its 
sinking, 
but 
stop 
and 
suspend 
its 
self 
within 
that 
little 
dimple 
or 
cavitie, 
which 
with 
its 
ponderosity 
it 
hath 
made 
in 
the 
water? 
I 
answer; 
because 
that 
in 
submerging 
it 
self, 
so 
far 
as 
till 
its 
Superficies 
come 
to 
the 
Levell 
with 
that 
of 
the 
water, 
it 
loseth 
a 
part 
of 
its 
Gravity, 
and 
loseth 
the 
rest 
of 
it 
as 
it 
submergeth 
& 
descends 
beneath 
the 
Surface 
of 
the 
water, 
which 
maketh 
Ramperts 
and 
Banks 
round 
about 
it, 
and 
it 
sustaines 
this 
loss 
by 
means 
of 
its 
drawing 
after 
it, 
and 
carrying 
along 
with 
it, 
the 
Air 
that 
is 
above 
it, 
and 
by 
Contact 
adherent 
to 
it, 
which 
Air 
succeeds 
to 
fill 
the 
Cavity 
that 
is 



invironed 
by 
the 
Ramperts 
of 
water; 
so 
that 
that 
which 
in 
this 
case 
descends 
and 
is 
placed 
inthe 
water, 
is 
notonly 
theBoardof 
Ebony 
or 
Plate 
of 
Iron, 
but 
a 
composition 
of 
Ebony 
and 
Air, 
from 
which 
resulteth 
a 
Solid 
no 
longer 
superiour 
in 
Gravity 
to 
the 
water, 
as 
was 
the 
simple 
Ebony, 
or 
the 
simple 
Gold. 
And, 
if 
we 
exactly 
consider, 
what, 
and 
how 
great 
the 
Solid 
is, 
that 
in 
this 
Experiment 
enters 
into 
the 
water, 
and 
contrasts 
with 
the 
Gravity 
of 
the 
same, 
it 
will 
be 
found 
to 
be 
all 
that 
which 
we 
find 
to 
be 
beneath 
the 
Surface 
of 
the 
water, 
the 
which 
is 
an 
aggregate 
and 
Compound 
of 
a 
Board 
of 
Ebony, 
and 
of 
almost 
the 
like 
quantity 
of 
Air, 
or 
a 
Mass 
compounded 
of 
a 
Plate 
of 
Lead,andtenortwelvetimesas 
much 
Air. 


But, 
Gentlemen, 
you 
that 
are 
my 
Antagonists 
in 
our 
Question, 
we 
require 
the 
Identity 
of 
Matter, 
and 
the 
alteration 
only 
of 
the 
Figure; 
therefore, 
you 
must 
remove 
that 
Air, 
which 
being 
conjoyned 
with 
the 
Board, 
makes 
it 
become 
another 
Body 
less 
grave 
than 
the 
Water, 
and 
put 
only 
the 
Ebony 
into 
the 
Water, 
and 
you 
shall 
certainly 
see 
the 
Board 
descend 
to 
the 
Bottom; 
and, 
if 
that 
do 
not 
happen, 
you 
have 
got 
the 
day. 
And 
to 
seperate 
the 
Air 
from 
the 
Ebony44, 
there 
needs 
no 
more 
but 
only 
to 
bath 
the 
Superficies 
of 
the 
said 
Board 
with 
the 
same 
Water: 
for 
the 
Water 
being 
thus 
interposed 
between 
the 
Board 
and 
the 
Air, 
the 
other 
circumfused 
Water 
shall 
run 
together 
without 
any 
impediment, 
and 
shall 
receive 
into 
it 
the 
sole 
andbare 
Ebony, 
as 
it 
was 
to 
do. 


44 
Howtoseperate 
theAir 
fromSolidsindemittingthem 
intothe 
water. 


But, 
me 
thinks 
I 
hear 
some 
of 
the 
Adversaries 
cunningly 
opposing 
this, 
and 
telling 
me, 
that 
they 
will 
not 
yield, 
by 
any 
means, 
that 
their 
Board 
be 
wetted, 
because 
the 
weight 
added 
thereto 
by 
the 
Water, 
by 
making 
it 
heavier 
than 
it 
was 
before, 
draws 
it 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
and 
that 
the 
addition 
of 
new 
weightiscontrarytoour 
agreement,whichwas,thattheMatter 
bethesame. 


To 
this, 
I 
answer, 
first; 
that 
treating 
of 
the 
operation 
of 
Figure 
in 
Bodies 
put 
into 
the 
Water, 
none 
can 
suppose 
them 
to 
be 
put 
into 
the 
Water 
without 
being 
wet; 
nor 
do 
I 
desire 
more 
to 
be 
done 
to 
the 
Board, 
then 
I 
will 
give 
you 
leave 
to 
do 
to 
the 
Ball. 
Moreover, 
it 
is 
untrue, 
that 
the 
Board 
sinks 
by 
vertue 
ofthenew 
Weightaddedtoitby 
the 
Water,in 
the 
singleandslightbathingof 
it: 
for 
I 
will 
put 
ten 
or 
twenty 
drops 
of 
Water 
upon 
the 
same 
Board, 
whilst 
it 
is 
sustained 
upon 
the 
water; 
which 
drops, 
because 
not 
conjoyned 
with 
the 
other 
Water 
circumfused, 
shall 
not 
so 
encrease 
the 
weight 
of 
it, 
as 
to 
make 
it 
sink: 
but 
if 
the 
Board 
being 
taken 
out, 
and 
all 
the 
water 
wiped 
off 
that 
was 



added 
thereto, 
I 
should 
bath 
all 
its 
Superficies 
with 
one 
only 
very 
small 
drop, 
and 
put 
it 
again 
upon 
the 
water, 
without 
doubt 
it 
shall 
sink, 
the 
other 
Water 
running 
to 
cover 
it, 
not 
being 
retained 
by 
the 
superiour 
Air; 
which 
Air 
by 
the 
interposition 
of 
the 
thin 
vail 
of 
water, 
that 
takes 
away 
its 
Contiguity 
unto 
the 
Ebony, 
shall 
without 
Renitence 
be 
seperated, 
nor 
doth 
it 
in 
the 
least 
oppose 
the 
succession 
of 
the 
other 
Water: 
but 
rather, 
to 
speak 
better, 
it 
shall 
descend 
freely; 
because 
it 
shall 
be 
all 
invironed 
and 
covered 
with 
water, 
as 
soon 
as 
its 
superiour 
Superficies, 
before 
vailed 
with 
water, 
doth 
arrive 
to 
the 
Levell 
of 
the 
universall 
Surface 
of 
the 
said 
water. 
To 
say, 
in 
the 
next 
place, 
that 
water 
can 
encrease 
the 
weight 
of 
things 
that 
are 
demitted 
into 
it, 
is 
most 
false; 
for 
water 
hath 
no 
Gravity 
in 
water45, 
since 
it 
descends 
not: 
yea, 
if 
we 
would 
well 
consider 
what 
any 
immense 
Mass 
of 
water 
doth 
put 
upon 
a 
grave 
Body; 
that 
is 
placed 
in 
it, 
we 
shall 
find 
experimentally, 
that 
it, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
will 
rather 
in 
a 
great 
part 
deminish 
the 
weight 
of 
it46, 
and 
that 
we 
may 
be 
able 
to 
lift 
an 
huge 
Stone 
from 
the 
Bottom 
of 
the 
water, 
which 
the 
water 
being 
removed, 
we 
are 
not 
able 
to 
stir. 
Nor 
let 
them 
tell 
me 
by 
way 
of 
reply, 
that 
although 
the 
superposed 
water 
augment 
not 
the 
Gravity 
of 
things 
that 
are 
in 
it, 
yet 
it 
increaseth 
the 
ponderosity 
of 
those 
that 
swim, 
and 
are 
part 
in 
the 
water 
and 
part 
in 
the 
Air, 
as 
is 
seen, 
for 
Example, 
in 
a 
Brass 
Ketle47, 
which 
whilst 
it 
is 
empty 
of 
water, 
and 
replenished 
only 
with 
Air 
shall 
swim, 
but 
pouring 
of 
Water 
therein, 
it 
shall 
become 
so 
grave, 
that 
it 
shall 
sink 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
and 
that 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
new 
weight 
added 
thereto. 
To 
this 
I 
will 
return 
answer, 
as 
above, 
that 
the 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Water, 
contained 
in 
the 
Vessel 
is 
not 
that 
which 
sinks 
it 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
but 
the 
proper 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Brass,superiourtothe 
SpecificallGravityoftheWater:forif 
the 
Vesselwere 
less 
gravethanwater,the 
Oceanwould 
not 
sufficetosubmergeit48.And,give 
me 
leave 
to 
repeat 
it 
again, 
as 
the 
fundamentall 
and 
principall 
point 
in 
this 
Case, 
that 
the 
Air 
contained 
in 
this 
Vessel 
before 
the 
infusion 
of 
the 
Water, 
was 
that 
which 
kept 
it 
a-float49, 
since 
that 
there 
was 
made 
of 
it, 
and 
of 
the 
Brass, 
a 
Composition 
less 
grave 
than 
an 
equall 
quantity 
of 
Water: 
and 
the 
place 
that 
the 
Vessel 
occupyeth 
in 
the 
Water 
whilst 
it 
floats, 
is 
not 
equall 
to 
the 
Brass 
alone, 
but 
to 
the 
Brass 
and 
to 
the 
Air 
together, 
which 
filleth 
that 
part 
of 
the 
Vessel 
that 
is 
below 
the 
Levell 
of 
the 
water: 
Moreover, 
when 
the 
Water 
is 
infused, 
the 
Air 
is 
removed, 
and 
there 
is 
a 
composition 
made 
of 
Brass 
and 
of 
water, 
more 
grave 
in 
specie 
than 
the 
simple 
water, 
but 
not 
by 
vertue 
of 
the 
waterinfused,as 
having 
greater 
Specifick 
Gravity 
thanthe 
other 
water, 
but 
through 
the 
proper 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Brass, 
and 
through 
the 
alienation 



of 
the 
Air. 
Now, 
as 
he 
that 
should 
say 
that 
Brass, 
that 
by 
its 
nature 
goes 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
being 
formed 
into 
the 
Figure 
of 
a 
Ketle50, 
acquireth 
from 
that 
Figure 
a 
vertue 
of 
lying 
in 
the 
Water 
without 
sinking, 
would 
say 
that 
which 
is 
false; 
because 
that 
Brass 
fashioned 
into 
any 
whatever 
Figure, 
goeth 
always 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
provided, 
that 
that 
which 
is 
put 
into 
the 
water 
be 
simple 
Brass; 
and 
it 
is 
not 
the 
Figure 
of 
the 
Vessel 
that 
makes 
the 
Brass 
to 
float, 
but 
it 
is 
because 
that 
that 
is 
not 
purely 
Brass 
which 
is 
put 
into 
the 
water, 
but 
an 
aggregate 
of 
Brass 
and 
of 
Air: 
so 
is 
it 
neither 
more 
nor 
less 
false, 
that 
a 
thin 
Plate 
of 
Brass 
or 
of 
Ebony, 
swims 
by 
vertue 
of 
its 
dilated 
& 
broad 
Figure: 
for 
the 
truth 
is, 
that 
it 
bares 
up 
without 
submerging, 
because 
that 
that 
which 
is 
put 
in 
the 
water, 
is 
not 
pure 
Brass 
or 
simple 
Ebony, 
but 
an 
aggregate 
of 
Brass 
and 
Air, 
or 
of 
Ebony 
and 
Air. 
And, 
this 
is 
not 
contrary 
unto 
my 
Conclusion, 
the 
which, 
(having 
many 
a 
time 
seen 
Vessels 
of 
Mettall, 
and 
thin 
pieces 
of 
diversegraveMattersfloat,byvertueoftheAirconjoyned 
withthem) 


did 
affirm, 
That 
Figure 
was 
not 
the 
Cause 
of 
the 
Natation 
or 
Submersion 
of 
such 
Solids 
as 
were 
placed 
in 
the 
water. 
Nay 
more, 
I 
cannot 
omit, 
but 
must 
tell 
my 
Antagonists, 
that 
this 
new 
conceit 
of 
denying 
that 
the 
Superficies 
of 
the 
Board 
should 
be 
bathed, 
may 
beget 
in 
a 
third 
person 
an 
opinion 
of 
a 
poverty 
of 
Arguments 
of 
defence 
on 
their 
part, 
since 
that 
such 
bathing 
was 
never 
insisted 
upon 
by 
them 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
our 
Dispute, 
and 
was 
not 
questioned 
in 
the 
least, 
being 
that 
the 
Originall 
of 
the 
discourse 
arose 
upon 
the 
swiming 
of 
Flakes 
of 
Ice, 
wherein 
it 
would 
be 
simplicity 
to 
require 
that 
their 
Superficiesmight 
bedry: 
besides, 
that 
whether 
thesepiecesofIce 
bewet 
or 
dry 
they 
alwayes 
swim,

Some 
peradventure, 
by 
way 
of 
defence, 
may 
say, 
that 
wetting 
the 
Board 
of 
Ebony,andthatinthe 
superiourSuperficies,itwould, 
though 
of 
it 
self 
unable 
to 
pierce 
and 
penetrate 
the 
water, 
be 
born 
downwards, 
if 
not 
by 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
additionall 
water, 
at 
least 
by 
that 
desire 
and 
propension 
that 
the 
superiour 
parts 
of 
the 
water 
have 
to 
re-unite 
and 
rejoyn 
themselves: 
by 
the 
Motion 
of 
which 
parts, 
the 
said 
Board 
cometh 
in 
a 
certain 
manner, 
to 
be 
depressed 
downwards. 


The 
Bathed 
Solid 
descends 
not 
out 
of 
any 
affectation 
of 
union 
in 
the 
upper 
parts 
of 
the 
water. 


This 
weak 
Refuge 
will 
be 
removed, 
if 
we 
do 
but 
consider, 
that 
the 
repugnancy 
of 
the 
inferiour 
parts 
of 
the 
water, 
is 
as 
great 
against 
Dis-union, 
as 
the 
Inclination 
of 
its 
superiour 
parts 
is 
to 
union: 
nor 
can 
the 
uper 
unite 
themselves 
without 
depressing 
the 
board, 
nor 
can 
it 
descend 
without 
disuniting 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
nether 
Water: 
so 
that 
it 
doth 
follow, 
by 
necessary 
consequence, 
that 
for 
those 
respects, 
it 
shall 
not 
descend. 
Moreover, 
the 
same 
that 
may 
be 
said 
of 
the 
upper 
parts 
of 
the 
water, 
may 
with 
equall 
reason 
be 
said 
of 
the 
nether, 
namely, 
that 
desiring 
to 
unite, 
they 
shall 
force 
the 
said 
Board 
upwards. 


Happily, 
some 
of 
these 
Gentlemen 
that 
dissent 
from 
me, 
will 
wonder, 
that 
I 
affirm, 
that 
the 
contiguous 
superiour 
Air 
is 
able 
to 
sustain 
that 
Plate 
of 
Brass 
or 
of 
Silver, 
that 
stayeth 
above 
water; 
as 
if 
I 
would 
in 
a 
certain 
sence 
allow 
the 
Air51, 
a 
kind 
of 
Magnetick 
vertue 
of 
sustaining 
the 
grave 
Bodies, 
with 
which 
it 
is 
contiguous. 
To 
satisfie 
all 
I 
may, 
to 
all 
doubts, 
I 
have 
been 
considering 
how 
by 
some 
other 
sensible 
Experiment 
I 
might 
demonstrate, 
how 
truly 
that 
little 
contiguous 
and 
superiour 
Air 
sustaines 
those 
Solids, 
which 
being 
by 
nature 
apt 
to 
descend 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
being 
placed 
lightly 
on 
the 
water 
submerge 
not, 
unless 
they 
be 
first 
thorowly 
bathed; 
and 
have 
found, 
that 
one 
of 
these 
Bodies 
having 
descended 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
by 
conveighing 
to 
it 
(without 
touching 
it 
in 
the 
least) 
a 
little 
Air, 
which 
conjoyneth 
with 
the 
top 
of 
the 
same, 
it 
becometh 
sufficient, 
not 
only, 
as 
before 
to 
sustain 
it, 
but 
also 
to 
raise 
it, 
and 
to 
carry 
it 
back 
to 
the 
top, 
where 
it 
stays 
and 
abideth 
in 
the 
same 
manner, 
till 
such 
time, 
as 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
conjoyned 
Air 
is 
taken 
away. 
And 
to 
this 
effect, 
I 
have 
taken 
a 
Ball 
of 
Wax, 
and 
made 
it 
with 
a 
little 
Lead, 
so 
grave, 
that 
it 
leasurely 
descends 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
making 
with 
all 
its 
Superficies 
very 
smooth 
and 
pollite: 
and 
this 
being 
put 
gently 
into 
the 
water, 



almost 
wholly 
submergeth, 
there 
remaining 
vissible 
only 
a 
little 
of 
the 
very 
top52, 
the 
which 
so 
long 
as 
it 
is 
conjoyned 
with 
the 
Air, 
shall 
retain 
the 
Ball 
atop, 
but 
the 
Contiguity 
of 
the 
Air 
taken 
away 
by 
wetting 
it, 
it 
shall 
descend 
to 
the 
Bottom 
and 
there 
remain. 
Now 
to 
make 
itby 
vertue 
of 
the 
Air, 
that 
before 
sustained 
it 
to 
return 
again 
to 
the 
top, 
and 
stay 
there, 
thrust 
into 
the 
water 
a 
Glass 
reversed 
with 
the 
mouth 
downwards, 
the 
which 
shall 
carry 
with 
it 
the 
Air 
it 
contains, 
and 
move 
this 
towards 
the 
Ball, 
abasing 
it 
till 
such 
time 
that 
you 
see, 
by 
the 
transparency 
of 
the 
Glass, 
that 
the 
contained 
Air 
do 
arrive 
to 
the 
summity 
of 
the 
Ball53: 
then 
gently 
withdraw 
the 
Glass 
upwards, 
and 
you 
shall 
see 
the 
Ball 
to 
rise, 
and 
afterwards 
stay 
on 
the 
top 
of 
the 
water54, 
if 
you 
carefully 
part 
the 
Glass 
and 
the 
water 
without 
overmuch 
commoving 
and 
disturbingit. 


There 
is, 
therefore, 
a 
certain 
affinity 
between 
the 
Air 
and 
other 
Bodies, 
which 
holds 
them 
unied, 
so, 
that 
they 
seperate 
not 
without 
a 
kind 
of 
violence. 
The 
same 
likewise 
is 
seen 
in 
the 
water55; 
for 
if 
we 
shall 
wholly 
submerge 
some 
Body 
in 
it, 
so 
that 
it 
be 
thorowly 
bathed, 
in 
the 
drawing 
of 
it 
afterwards 
gently 
out 
again, 
we 
shall 
see 
the 
water 
follow 
it, 
and 
rise 
notably 
above 
its 
Surface, 
before 
it 
seperates 
from 
it. 
Solid 
Bodies, 
also56, 
if 
they 
be 
equall 
and 
alike 
in 
Superficies, 
so, 
that 
they 
make 
an 
exact 
Contact 
without 
the 
interposition 
of 
the 
least 
Air, 
that 
may 
part 
them 
in 
the 
seperation 
and 
yield 
untill 
that 
the 
ambient 
Medium 
succeeds 
to 
replenish 
the 
place, 
do 
hold 
very 
firmly 
conjoyned, 
and 
are 
not 
to 
be 
seperated 
without 
great 
force 
but, 
because, 
the 
Air, 
Water, 
and 
other 
Liquids, 
very 
expeditiously 
shape 
themselves 
to 
contact 
with 
any 
Solid 
Bodies, 
so 
that 
their 
Superficies 
do 
exquisitely 
adopt 
themselves 
to 
that 
of 
the 
Solids, 
without 
any 
thing 
remaining 
between 
them, 
therefore, 
the 
effect 
of 
this 
Conjunction 
and 
Adherence 
is 
more 
manifestly 
and 
frequently 
observed 
in 
them, 
than 
in 
hard 
and 
inflexible 
Bodies, 
whose 
Superficies 
do 
very 
rarely 
conjoyn 
with 
exactness 
of 
Contact57. 
This 
is 
therefore 
that 
Magnetick 
vertue, 
which 
with 
firm 
Connection 
conjoyneth 
all 
Bodies, 
that 
do 
touch 
without 
the 
interposition 
of 
flexible 
fluids; 
and, 
who 
knows, 
but 
that 
that 
a 
Contact, 
when 
it 
is 
very 
exact, 
may 
be 
a 
sufficient 
Cause 
of 
the 
Union 
and 
Continuity 
of 
the 
partsofanaturall 
Body?

of

of

Now, 
pursuing 
my 
purpose, 
I 
say; 
that 
it 
needs 
not, 
that 
we 
have 
recourse 
to 
the 
Tenacity, 
that 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
water 
have 
amongst 
themselves, 
by 
which 
they 
resist 
and 
oppose 
Division, 
Distraction, 
and 
Seperation, 
because 
there 
is 
no 
such 
Coherence 
and 
Resistance 
of 
Division 
for 
if 
there 
were, 
it 
would 
be 
no 
less 
in 
the 
internall 
parts 
than 
in 
those 
nearer 
the 
superiour 
or 
externall 
Surface, 
so 
that 
the 
same 
Board, 
finding 
alwayes 
the 
same 
Resistance 
and 
Renitence, 
would 
no 
less 
stop 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
water 
than 
about 
the 
Surface, 
which 
is 
false. 
Moreover, 
what 
Resistance 
can 
we 
place 
in 
the 
Continuity 
of 
the 
water, 
if 
we 
see 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
find 
any 
Body 
of 
whatsoever 
Matter, 
Figure 
or 
Magnitude, 
which 
being 
put 
into 
the 
water, 
shall 
be 
obstructed 
and 
impeded 
by 
the 
Tenacity 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
water 
to 
one 
another, 
so, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
moved 
upwards 
or 
downwards, 
according 
as 
the 
Cause 
of 
their 
Motion 
transports 
it? 
And, 
what 
greater 
proof 
of 
it 
can 
we 
desier, 
than 
that 
which 
we 
daily 
see 
in 
Muddy 
waters, 
which 
being 
put 
into 
Vessels 
to 
be 
drunk, 
and 
being, 
after 
some 
hours 
setling58, 
still, 
as 
we 
say, 
thick 
in 
the 
end, 
after 
four 
or 
six 
dayes 
they 
are 
wholly 
setled, 
and 
become 
pureandclear? 


Nor 
can 
their 
Resistance 
of 
Penetration 
stay 
those 
impalpable 
and 
insensible 
Atomes 
of 
Sand, 
which 
by 
reason 
of 
their 
exceeding 
small 
force, 
spendsixdayes 
indescending 
thespaceof 
halfayard. 


58 
The 
settlementof 
Muddy 
Water, 
proveth 
that 
that 
Element 
hath 
no 
aversion 
to 
Division. 


Nor 
let 
them 
say, 
that 
the 
seeing 
of 
such 
small 
Bodies, 
consume 
six 
dayes 
in 
descending 
so 
little 
a 
way, 
is 
a 
sufficient 
Argument 
of 
the 
Waters 
Resistance 
of 
Division; 
because 
that 
is 
no 
resisting 
of 
Division, 
but 
a 
retarding 
of 
Motion; 
and 
it 
would 
be 
simplicity 
to 
say, 
that 
a 
thing 
opposeth 
Division59, 
and 
that 
in 
the 
same 
instant, 
it 
permits 
it 
self 
to 
be 
divided: 
nor 
doth 
the 
Retardation 
of 
Motion 
at 
all 
favour 
the 
Adversaries 
cause, 
for 
that 



they 
are 
to 
instance 
in 
a 
thing 
that 
wholly 
prohibiteth 
Motion, 
and 
procureth 
Rest; 
it 
is 
necessary, 
therefore, 
to 
find 
out 
Bodies 
that 
stay 
in 
the 
water, 
if 
one 
would 
shew 
its 
repugnancy 
to 
Division, 
and 
not 
such 
as 
move 
in 
it, 
howbeit 
but 
slowly. 


59 
Watercannot 
oppose 
division, 
and 
at 
the 
sametimepermitit 
self 
to 
be 
divided. 


What 
then 
is 
this 
Crassitude 
of 
the 
water, 
with 
which 
it 
resisteth 
Division? 
What, 
I 
beseech 
you, 
should 
it 
be, 
if 
we 
(as 
we 
have 
said 
above) 
with 
all 
diligence 
attempting 
the 
reduction 
of 
a 
Matter 
into 
so 
like 
a 
Gravity 
with 
the 
water, 
that 
forming 
it 
into 
a 
dilated 
Plate 
it 
rests 
suspended 
as 
we 
have 
said, 
between 
the 
two 
waters, 
it 
be 
impossible 
to 
effect 
it, 
though 
we 
bring 
them 
to 
such 
an 
Equiponderance, 
that 
as 
much 
Lead 
as 
the 
fourth 
part 
of 
a 
Grain 
of 
Musterd-seed, 
added 
to 
the 
same 
expanded 
Plate, 
that 
in 
Air 
[i. 
e. 
out 
of 
the 
water] 
shall 
weigh 
four 
or 
six 
pounds, 
sinketh 
it 
to 
the 
Bottom, 
and 
being 
substracted, 
itascendsto 
theSurfaceof 
thewater? 


I 
cannot 
see, 
(if 
what 
I 
say 
be 
true, 
as 
it 
is 
most 
certain) 
what 
minute 
vertue 
and 
force 
we 
can 
possibly 
find 
or 
imagine, 
to 
which 
the 
Resistance 
of 
the 
water 
against 
Division 
and 
Penetration 
is 
not 
inferiour; 
whereupon, 
we 
must 
of 
necessity 
conclude 
that 
it 
is 
nothing: 
because, 
if 
it 
were 
of 
any 
sensible 
power, 
some 
large 
Plate 
might 
be 
found 
or 
compounded 
of 
a 
Matter 
alike 
in 
Gravity 
to 
the 
water, 
which 
not 
only 
would 
stay 
between 
the 
two 
waters; 
but, 
moreover, 
should 
not 
be 
able 
to 
descend 
or 
ascend 
without 
notable 
force. 
We 
may 
likewise 
collect 
the 
same 
from 
an 
other 
Experiment60, 
shewing 
that 
the 
Water 
gives 
way 
also 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
to 
transversall 
Division; 
for 
if 
in 
a 
setled 
and 
standing 
water 
we 
should 
place 
any 
great 
Mass 
that 
goeth 
not 
to 
the 
bottom, 
drawing 
it 
with 
a 
single 
Womans 
Hair, 
we 
might 
carry 
it 
from 
place 
to 
place 
without 
any 
opposition, 
and 
this 
whatever 
Figure 
it 
hath, 
though 
that 
it 
possess 
a 
great 
space 
of 
water, 
as 
for 
instance, 
a 
great 
Beam 
would 
do 
moved 
side-ways. 
Perhaps 
some 
might 
oppose 
me 
and 
say, 
that 
if 
the 
Resistance 
of 
water 
against 
Division, 
as 
I 
affirm, 
were 
nothing; 
Shipsshould 
notneed 
sucha 
force 
ofOarsandSaylesforthemovingof 
them 
from 
place 
to 
place 
in 
a 
tranquile 
Sea, 
or 
standing 
Lake. 
To 
him 
that 
should 
make 
such 
an 
objection, 
I 
would 
reply61, 
that 
the 
water 
contrasteth 
not 
against, 
nor 
simply 
resisteth 
Division, 
but 
a 
sudden 
Division, 
and 
with 
so 
much 
greater 
Renitence, 
by 
how 
much 
greater 
the 
Velocity 
is: 
and 
the 
Cause 
of 
this 
Resistance 
depends 
not 
on 
Crassitude, 
or 
any 
other 
thing 
that 



absolutely 
opposeth 
Division, 
but 
because 
that 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
water 
divided, 
in 
giving 
way 
to 
that 
Solid 
that 
is 
moved 
in 
it, 
are 
themselves 
also 
necessitated 
locally 
to 
move, 
some 
to 
the 
one 
side, 
and 
some 
to 
the 
other, 
and 
some 
downwards: 
and 
this 
must 
no 
less 
be 
done 
by 
the 
waves 
before 
the 
Ship, 
or 
other 
Body 
swimming 
through 
the 
water, 
than 
by 
the 
posteriour 
and 
subsequent; 
because, 
the 
Ship 
proceeding 
forwards, 
to 
make 
it 
self 
a 
way 
to 
receive 
its 
Bulk, 
it 
is 
requisite, 
that 
with 
the 
Prow 
it 
repulse 
the 
adjacent 
parts 
of 
the 
water, 
as 
well 
on 
one 
hand 
as 
on 
the 
other, 
and 
that 
it 
move 
them 
as 
much 
transversly, 
as 
is 
the 
half 
of 
the 
breadth 
of 
the 
Hull: 
and 
the 
like 
removall 
must 
those 
waves 
make, 
that 
succeeding 
the 
Poump 
do 
run 
from 
the 
remoter 
parts 
of 
the 
Ship 
towards 
those 
of 
the 
middle, 
successively 
to 
replenish 
the 
places, 
which 
the 
Ship 
in 
advancing 
forwards, 
goeth, 
leaving 
vacant. 
Now, 
because, 
all 
Motitions 
are 
made 
in 
Time62, 
and 
the 
longer 
in 
greater 
time: 
and 
it 
being 
moreover 
true, 
that 
those 
Bodies 
that 
in 
a 
certain 
time 
are 
moved 
by 
a 
certain 
power 
such 
a 
certain 
space, 
shall 
not 
be 
moved 
the 
same 
space, 
and 
in 
a 
shorter 
Time, 
unless 
by 
a 
greater 
Power: 
therefore, 
the 
broader 
Ships 
move 
slower 
than 
the 
narrower, 
being 
put 
on 
by 
an 
equall 
Force: 
and 
the 
same 
Vessel 
requires 
so 
much 
greater 
force 
of 
Wind, 
or 
Oars, 
thefaster 
itis 
tomove. 


60 
An

a

which 
proveth, 
that 
ithath 
no 
Resistance

61 
Howships

moved 
in

water. 


62 
Bodies 
moved 
a 
certain 
space 
in 
a 
certain 
Time, 
by 
a 
certain 
power, 
cannot 
be 
moved 
the 
same 
space 
and 
in 
a 
shorter 
time, 
but 
by 
a 
greater 
power. 


But 
yet 
for 
all 
this, 
any 
great 
Mass 
swimming 
in 
a 
standing 
Lake, 
may 
be 
moved 
by 
any 
petit 
force; 
only 
it 
is 
true, 
that 
a 
lesser 
force 
more 
slowly 
moves 
it: 
but 
if 
the

Resistance 
of

were 
in 
any 
manner 
sensible, 
it 
would 
follow, 
that 
the 
said 
Mass, 
should, 
notwithstanding 
the 
percussion 
of 
some 
sensible 
force, 
continue 
immoveable, 
which 
is 
not 
so63. 
Yea, 
I 
will 
say 
farther, 
that 
should 
we 
retire 
our 
selves 
into 
the 
more 
internall 
contemplation 
of 
the 
Nature 
of 
water 
and 
other 
Fluids, 
perhaps 
we 
should 
discover 
the 
Constitution 
of 
their 
parts 
to 
be 
such, 
that 
they 
not 
only 
do 
not 
oppose 
Division, 
but 
that 
they 
have 
not 
any 
thing 
in 
them 
to 
be 
divided: 
so 
that 
the 
Resistance 
that 
is 
observed 
in 
moving 
through 
the 
water64, 
is 
like 
to 
that 
which 
we 
meet 
with 
in 
passing 
through 
a 
great 
Throng 
of 
People, 



wherein 
we 
find 
impediment, 
and 
not 
by 
any 
difficulty 
in 
the 
Division, 
for 
that 
none 
of 
those 
persons 
are 
divided 
whereof 
the 
Croud 
is 
composed, 
but 
only 
in 
moving 
of 
those 
persons 
side-ways 
which 
were 
before 
divided 
and 
disjoyned: 
and 
thus 
we 
find 
Resistance 
in 
thrusting 
a 
Stick 
into 
an 
heap 
of 
Sand, 
not 
because 
any 
part 
of 
the 
Sand 
is 
to 
be 
cut 
in 
pieces, 
but 
only 
to 
be 
moved 
and 
raised65. 
Two 
manners 
of 
Penetration, 
therefore, 
offer 
themselves 
to 
us, 
one 
in 
Bodies, 
whose 
parts 
were 
continuall, 
and 
here 
Division 
seemeth 
necessary, 
the 
other 
in 
the 
aggregates 
of 
parts 
not 
continuall, 
but 
contiguous 
only66, 
and 
here 
there 
is 
no 
necessity 
of 
dividing 
but 
of 
moving 
only. 
Now, 
I 
am 
not 
well 
resolved, 
whether 
water 
and 
other 
Fluids 
may 
be 
esteemed 
to 
be 
of 
parts 
continuall 
or 
contiguous 
only67; 
yet 
I 
find 
my 
self 
indeed 
inclined 
to 
think 
that 
they 
are 
rather 
contiguous 
(if 
there 
be 
in 
Nature 
no 
other 
manner 
of 
aggregating, 
than 
by 
the 
union, 
or 
by 
the 
touching 
of 
the 
extreams:) 
and 
I 
am 
induced 
thereto 
by 
the 
great 
difference 
that 
I 
see 
between 
the 
Conjunction 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
an 
hard 
or 
Solid 
Body68, 
and 
the 
Conjunction 
of 
the 
same 
parts 
when 
the 
same 
Body 
shall 
be 
made 
Liquid 
and 
Fluid: 
for 
if, 
for 
example, 
I 
take 
a 
Mass 
of 
Silver 
or 
other 
Solid 
and 
hard 
Mettall, 
I 
shall 
in 
dividing 
it 
into 
two 
parts, 
find 
not 
only 
the 
resistance 
that 
is 
found 
in 
the 
moving 
of 
it 
only69, 
but 
an 
other 
incomparably 
greater, 
dependent 
on 
that 
vertue, 
whatever 
it 
be, 
which 
holds 
the 
parts 
united: 
and 
so 
if 
we 
would 
divide 
again 
those 
two 
parts 
into 
other 
two, 
and 
successively 
into 
others 
and 
others, 
we 
should 
still 
find 
a 
like 
Resistance, 
but 
ever 
less 
by 
how 
much 
smaller 
the 
parts 
to 
be 
divided 
shall 
be; 
but 
if, 
lastly, 
employing 
most 
subtile 
and 
acute 
Instruments, 
such 
as 
are 
the 
most 
tenuous 
parts 
of 
the 
Fire, 
we 
shall 
resolve 
it 
(perhaps) 
into 
its 
last 
and 
least 
Particles, 
there 
shall 
not 
be 
left 
in 
them 
any 
longer 
either 
Resistance 
of 
Division, 
or 
so 
much 
as 
a 
capacity 
of 
being 
farther 
divided, 
especially 
by 
Instruments 
more 
grosse 
than 
the 
acuities 
of 
Fire: 
and 
what 
Knife 
or 
Rasor 
put 
into 
well 
melted 
Silver 
can 
we 
finde, 
that 
will 
divide 
a 
thing 
which 
surpasseth 
the 
separating 
power 
of 
Fire? 
Certainly 
none: 
because 
either 
the 
whole 
shall 
be 
reduced 
to 
the 
most 
minute 
and 
ultimate 
Divisions, 
or 
if 
there 
remain 
parts 
capable 
still 
of 
other 
Subdidivisions, 
they 
cannot 
receive 
them, 
but 
only 
from 
acuter 
Divisors 
than 
Fire; 
but 
a 
Stick 
or 
Rod 
of 
Iron, 
moved 
in 
the 
melted 
Metall, 
is 
not 
such 
a 
one. 
Of 
a 
like 
Constitution 
and 
Consistence, 
I 
account 
the 
parts 
of 
Water70, 
and 
other 
Liquids 
to 
be, 
namely, 
incapable 
of 
Division 
by 
reason 
of 
their 
Ienuity; 
or 
if 
not 
absolutely 
indivisible, 
yet 
at 
least 
not 
to 
be 
divided 
by 
a 



Board, 
or 
other 
Solid 
Body, 
palpable 
un 
required 
to 
be 
more 
sharp 
than 
the 
Solid 
only 
move, 
and 
not 
divide 
the 
Water71, 
before 
divided 
to 
the 
extreamest 
minu 
moved, 
either 
many 
of 
them 
at 
once, 
or 
to 
every 
small 
Corpuscle, 
that 
descend 
and 
light, 
descending 
in 
the 
Air, 
and

Particles 
of

and 
Extrusion, 
than 
is 
its 
whereupon 
it 
submergeth, 
and 
move 
proportionate 
to 
its 
Power. 
There 
is 
no 
against 
Division, 
nay, 
there 
is 
not 
in 
it

in

I 
believe 
not 
after 
all 
this, 
that 
any 
(thinking 
perhaps 
thereby 
to 
defend 
Aristotle)willsay, 
that 
it 
beingtrue,thatthe 
much 
waterresistsmore 
than 
the 
little, 
the 
said 
Board 
being 
put 
lower 
descendeth, 
because 
there 
remaineth 
a 
less 
Mass 
of 
water 
to 
be 
divided 
by 
it: 
because 
if 
after 
the 
having 
seen 
the 
same 
Board 
swim 
in 
four 
Inches 
of 
water, 
and 
also 
after 
that 
in 
the 
same 
to 
sink, 
he 
shall 
try 
the 
same 
Experiment 
upon 
a 
profundity 
of 
ten 
or 
twenty 
fathom 
water, 
he 
shall 
see 
the 
very 
self 
same 
effect. 
And 
here 
I 
will 
take 
occasion 
to 
remember, 
for 
the 
removall 
of 
an 
Error 
that 
is 
too 
common; 
That 
that 
Ship 
or 
other 
whatsoever 
Body, 
that 
on 
the 
depth 
of 
an 
hundred 
or 
a 
thousand 
fathom, 
swims 
with 
submerging 
only 
six 
fathom 
of 
its 
own 
height, 
[or 
in 
the 
Sea 
dialect, 
that 
draws 
six 
fathom 
water] 
shall 
swim 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
in 
water, 
that 
hath 
but 
six 
fathom 
and 
half 
an 
Inch 
of 
depth94. 
Nor 
do 
I 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
think 
that 
it 
can 
be 
said, 
that 
the 
superiour 
parts 
of 
the 
water 
are 
the 
more 
dense, 
although 
a 
most 
grave 
Authour 
hath 
esteemed 
the 
superiour 
water 
in 
the 
Sea 
to 
be 
so, 
grounding 
his 
opinion 
upon 
its 
being 
more 
salt, 
than 
that 
at 
the 
bottom: 
but 
I 
doubt 
the 
Experiment, 
whether 
hitherto 
in 
taking 
the 
water 
from 
the 
bottom, 
the 
Observatour 
did 
not 
light 
upon 
some 
spring 
of 
fresh 
water 
there 
spouting 
up: 
but 
we 
plainly 
see 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
fresh 
Waters 
of 
Rivers 
to 
dilate 
themselves 
for 
some 
miles 
beyond 
their 
place 
of 
meeting 
with 
the 
salt 
water 
of 
the 
Sea, 
without 
descending 
in 
it, 
or 
mixing 
with 
it, 
unless 
by 
the 
intervention 
of 
some 
commotionorturbulencyof 
the 
Windes. 


94 
A 
Ship 
that 
in 
100 
Fathomewater 
draweth 
6Fathome, 
shall 
float 
in 
6Fathomeand1/2 
anInch 
ofdepth. 


But 
returning 
to 
Aristotle, 
I 
say, 
that 
the 
breadth 
of 
Figure 
hath 
nothing 
to 
do 
in 
this 
business 
more 
or 
less, 
because 
the 
said 
Plate 
of 
Lead, 
or 
other 
Matter, 
cut 
into 
long 
Slices, 
swim 
neither 
more 
nor 
less95; 
and 
the 
same 
shall 
the 
Slices 
do, 
being 
cut 
anew 
into 
little 
pieces, 
because 
its 
not 
the 
breadth 
but 
the 
thickness 
that 
operates 
in 
this 
business. 
I 
say 
farther, 
that 
in 
case 
it 
were 
really 
true, 
that 
the 
Renitence 
to 
Division 
were 
the 
proper 
Cause 
of 
swimming96, 
the 
Figures 
more 
narrow 
and 
short, 
would 
much 
better 
swim 
than 
the 
more 
spacious 
and 
broad, 
so 
that 
augmenting 
the 
breadth 
of 
the 
Figure, 
the 
facility 
of 
supernatation 
will 
be 
deminished, 
and 
decreasing,

96 
Were 
Renitence 
the 
cause 
of 
Natation,breadth 
of 
Figurewouldhinder 
the 
swiming 
of 
Bodies. 


And 
for 
declaration 
of 
what 
I 
say, 
consider 
that 
when 
a 
thin 
Plate 
of 
Lead 
descends, 
dividing 
the 
water, 
the 
Division 
and 
discontinuation 
is 
made 
between 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
water, 
invironing 
the 
perimeter 
or 
Circumference 
of 
the 
said 
Plate, 
and 
according 
to 
the 
bigness 
greater 
or 
lesser 
of 
that 
circuit, 
it 
hath 
to 
divide 
a 
greater 
or 
lesser 
quantity 
of 
water, 
so 
that 
if 
the 
circuit, 
suppose 
of 
a 
Board, 
be 
ten 
Feet 
in 
sinking 
it 
flatways, 
it 
is 
to 
make 
the 
seperation 
and 
division, 
and 
to 
so 
speak, 
an 
incission 
upon 
ten 
Feet 
of 
water; 
and 
likewise 
a 
lesser 
Board 
that 
is 
four 
Feet 
in 
Perimeter, 
must 
make 
an 
incession 
of 
four 
Feet. 
This 
granted, 
he 
that 
hath 
any 
knowledge 
in 
Geometry, 
will 
comprehend, 
not 
only 
that 
a 
Board 
sawed 
in 
many 
long 
thin 
pieces, 
will 
much 
better 
float 
than 
when 
it 
was 
entire, 
but 
that 
all 
Figures, 
the 
more 
short 
and 
narrow 
they 
be, 
shall 
so 
much 
the 
better 
swim. 
Let 
the 
Board 
A 
B 
C 
D 
be, 
for 
Example, 
eight 
Palmes 
long, 
and 
five 
broad, 
its 
circuit 
shall

six 
Palmes;andsomanymust

sawir,assupposeintoeightlittle 
pieces, 
according 
to 
the 
Lines 
E 
F, 
G 
H, 
{&}c. 
making 
seven 
Segments, 
we 
must 
adde 
to 
the 
twenty 
six 
Palmes 
of 
the 
circuit 
of 
the 
whole 
Board, 
seventy 
others; 
whereupon 
the 
eight 
little 
pieces 
so 
cut 
and 
seperated, 
have 
to 
cut 
ninty 
six 
Palmes 
of 
water. 
And, 
if 
moreover, 
we 
cut 
each 
of 
the 
said 
pieces 
into 
five 
parts, 
reducing 
them 
into 
Squares, 
to 
the 
circuit 
of 
ninty 
six 
Palmes, 
with 
four 
cuts 
of 
eight 
Palmes 
apiece; 
we 
shall 
adde 
also 
sixty 
four 
Palmes, 
whereupon 
the 
said 
Squares 
to 
descend 
in 
the 
water, 
must 
divide 
one 
hundred 
and 
sixty 
Palmes 
of 
water, 
but 
the 
Resistance 
is 
much 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
twenty 
six; 
therefore 
to 
the 
lesser 
Superficies, 
we 
shall 
reduce 
them, 
so 
much 
the 
more 
easily 
will 
they 
float: 
and 
the 
same 
will 
happen 
in 
all 
other 
Figures, 
whose 
Superficies 
are 
simular 
amongst 
themselves, 
but 
different 
in 
bigness: 
because 
the 
said 
Superficies, 
being 
either 
deminished 
or 
encreased, 
always 
diminish 
or 
encrease 
their 
Perimeters 
in 
subduple 
proportion; 
to 
wit, 
the 
Resistance 
that 
they 
find 
in 
penetrating 
the 
water; 
therefore 
the 
little 
pieces 
graduallyswim,with 
more 
andmorefacilityas 
theirbreadthislessened. 



This 
is 
manifest; 
for 
keeping 
still 
the 
same 
height 
of 
the 
Solid, 
with 
the 
same 
proportion 
as 
the 
Base 
encreaseth 
or 
deminisheth, 
doth 
the 
said 
Solid 
also 
encrease 
or 
diminish; 
whereupon 
the 
Solid 
more 
diminishing 
than 
the 
Circuit, 
the 
Cause 
of 
Submersion 
more 
diminisheth 
than 
the 
Cause 
of 
Natation: 
And 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
Solid 
more 
encreasing 
than 
the 
Circuit, 
the 
Cause 
of 
Submersion 
encreaseth 
more, 
that 
of 
Natation 
less. 


And 
this 
may 
all 
be 
deduced 
out 
of 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
Aristotle 
against 
his 
ownDoctrine. 


Lastly, 
to 
that 
which 
we 
read 
in 
the 
latter 
part 
of 
the 
Text97, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
that 
we 
must 
compare 
the 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Moveable 
with 
the 
Resistance 
of 
the 
Medium 
against 
Division, 
because 
if 
the 
force 
of 
the 
Gravity 
exceed 
the 
Resistance 
of 
the 
Medium, 
the 
Moveable 
will 
descend, 
if 
not 
it 
will 
float. 
I 
need 
not 
make 
any 
other 
answer, 
but 
that 
which 
hath 
been 
already 
delivered; 



namely, 
that 
its 
not 
the 
Resistance 
of 
absolute 
Division, 
(which 
neither 
is 
in 
WaternorAir) 


but 
the 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Medium 
that 
must 
be 
compared 
with 
the 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Moveables; 
and 
if 
that 
of 
the 
Medium 
be 
greater, 
the 
Moveable 
shall 
not 
descend, 
nor 
so 
much 
as 
make 
a 
totall 
Submersion, 
but 
a 
partiall 
only; 
because 
in 
the 
place 
which 
it 
would 
occupy 
in 
the 
water, 
there 
must 
not 
remain 
a 
Body 
that 
weighs 
less 
than 
a 
like 
quantity 
of 
water: 
but 
if 
the 
Moveable 
be 
more 
grave, 
it 
shall 
descend 
to 
the 
bottom, 
and 
possess 
a 
place 
where 
it 
is 
more 
conformable 
for 
it 
to 
remain, 
than 
another 
Body 
that 
is 
less 
grave. 
And 
this 
is 
the 
only 
true 
proper 
and 
absolute 
Cause 
of 
Natation 
and 
Submersion, 
so 
that 
nothing 
else

DIALOGUE 
CONCERNING 
THE 
TWO 
CHIEF 
WORLD 
SYSTEMS 



Translated 
by 
Thomas 
Salusbury 


The 
Dialogue 
Concerning 
the 
Two 
Chief 
World 
Systems 
was 
first 
published 
in 
Italian 
as 
Dialogo 
sopra 
i 
due 
massimi 
sistemi 
del 
mondo 
in 
1632 
(see 
Figure 
1). 
As 
with 
the 
earlier 
Discourse 
on 
Floating 
Bodies, 
it 
was 
aimed 
at 
a 
general 
readership 
and 
only 
appeared 
in 
Latin 
(as 
Systema 
cosmicum) 
in 
1635. 
Again, 
as 
with 
the 
earlier 
volume, 
it 
was 
dedicated 
to 
the 
Grand 
Duke 
ofTuscany,now 
FerdinandoII 
de’ 
Medici. 


The 
focus 
of 
this 
landmark 
volume 
is 
the 
comparison 
of 
the 
Copernican 
planetary 
system 
(which 
was 
heliocentric, 
with 
the 
planets 
orbiting 
the 
sun) 
with 
the 
classical 
Ptolemaic 
system 
(where 
everything 
in 
the 
Universe 
circles 
around 
the 
Earth). 
It 
takes 
the 
form 
of 
a 
discussion 
(occurring 
over 
four 
days) 
between 
three 
characters 
(Figure 
2): 
Salviati, 
an 
intellectual, 
who 
is 
a 
mouthpiece 
for 
Galileo’s 
arguments; 
Sagredo, 
a 
wealthy, 
inquisitive 
layman; 
and 
Simplicio 
(“simpleton”) 
-a 
philosopher 
who 
puts 
up 
ineffectual 
Aristotolean 
arguments 
for 
Salviati 
to 
refute. 
In 
the 
introduction 
(to 
the 
discerning 
reader) 
Galileo 
writes 
“I 
have 
taken 
the 
Copernican 
side 
in 
the 
discourse, 
proceeding 
as 
with 
a 
pure 
mathematical 
hypothesis 
and 
striving 
by 
everyartifice 
torepresentitassuperiortosupposingtheearthmotionless.” 


Even 
though 
this 
book 
was 
published 
in 
Florence 
with 
a 
formal 
license 
from 
the 
Inquisition, 
a 
year 
later 
Galileo 
was 
tried 
and 
condemned 
(see 
Figure 
3). 
He 
was 
found 
to 
be 
“vehemently 
suspect 
of 
heresy”, 
and 
the 
book 
was 
placed 
on 
the 
Index 
of 
Forbidden 
Books, 
where 
it 
remained 
for 
a 
further 
two 
centuries. 
In 
a 
secret 
action, 
the 
publication 
of 
anything 
else 
he 
had 
written, 
or 
ever 
might 
write, 
was 
also 
banned 
in 
Catholic 
countries. 
Galileo, 
himself, 
was 
sentenced 
to 
indefinite 
imprisonment, 
and 
was 
kept 
under 
house 
arrestuntilhisdeathin1642.

DUKE 
OF 
TUSCANY. 


THOUGH 
the 
difference 
between 
Men 
and 
other 
living 
Creatures 
be 
very 
great, 
yet 
happly 
he 
that 
should 
say 
that 
he 
could 
shew 
little 
less 
between 
Man 
and 
Man 
would 
not 
speak 
more 
than 
he 
might 
prove. 
What 
proportion 
doth 
one 
bear 
to 
a 
thousand? 
and 
yet 
it 
is 
a 
common 
Proverb, 
One 
Man 
is 
worth 
a 
thousand, 
when 
as 
a 
thousand 
are 
not 
worth 
one. 
This 
difference 
hath 
dependence 
upon 
the 
different 
abilities 
of 
their 
Intellectuals; 
which 
I 
reduce 
to 
the 
being, 
or 
not 
being 
a 
Philosopher; 
in 
regard 
that 
Philosophy 
as 
being 
the 
proper 
food 
of 
such 
as 
live 
by 
it, 
distinguisheth 
a 
Man 
from 
the 
common 
Essence 
of 
the 
Vulgar 
in 
a 
more 
or 
less 
honourable 
degree 
according 
to 
the 
variety 
of 
that 
diet. 
In 
this 
sence 
he 
that 
hath 
the 
highest 
looks, 
is 
of 
highest 
quality; 
and 
the 
turning 
over 
of 
the 
great 
Volume 
of 
Nature, 
which 
is 
the 
proper 
Object 
of 
Philosophy 
is 
the 
way 
to 
make 
one 
look 
high: 
in 
which 
Book, 
although 
whatsoever 
we 
read, 
as 
being 
the 
Work 
of 
Almighty 
God, 
is 
therefore 
most 
proportionate; 
yet 
notwithstanding 
that 
is 
more 
absolute 
and 
noble 
wherein 
we 
more 
plainly 
deserne 
his 
art 
and 
skill. 
The 
Constitution 
of 
the 
Vnivers, 
among 
all 
Physical 
points 
that 
fall 
within 
Humane 
Comprehension, 
may, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
be 
preferred 
to 
the 
Precedency: 
for 
if 
that 
in 
regard 
of 
universal 
extent 
it 
excell 
all 
others, 
it 
ought 
as 
the 
Rule 
and 
Standard 
of 
the 
rest 
to 
goe 
before 
them 
in 
Nobility. 
Now 
if 
ever 
any 
persons 
mightchallenge 
to 
be 
signally 
distinguished 
for 
Intellectualsfrom 
other 
men, 
Ptolomey 
and 
Copernicus 
were 
they 
that 
have 
had 
the 
honour 
to 
see 
farthest 
into,and 
discoursemostprofoundly 
oftheWorldsSysteme. 
AbouttheWorks 
of 
which 
famous 
Men 
these 
Dialous 
being 
chiefly 
conversant, 
I 
conceived 
it 
my 
duty 
to 
Dedicate 
them 
only 
to 
Your 
Highness. 
For 
laying 
all 
the 
weight 
upon 
these 
two, 
whom 
I 
hold 
to 
be 
the 
Ablest 
Wits 
that 
have 
left 
us 
their 
Works 
upon 
these 
Subjects; 
to 
avoid 
a 
Solecisme 
in 
Manners, 
I 
was 
obliged 
to 
address 
them 
to 
Him, 
who 
with 
me, 
is 
the 
Greatest 
of 
all 
Men, 
from 
whom 
they 
can 
receive 
either 
Glory 
or 
Patrociny. 
And 
if 
these 
two 
persons 
have 
so 
farre 
illuminated 
my 
Understanding 
as 
that 
this 
my 
Book 
may 
in 
a 
great 
part 
be 
confessed 
to 
belong 
to 
them, 
well 
may 
it 
also 
be 
acknowledged 
to 
belong 
to 
Your 
Highness, 
unto 
whose 
Bounteous 
Magnificence 
I 
owe 
the 
time 
and 
leasure 
I 
had 
to 
write 
it, 
as 
also 
unto 
Your 
Powerful 
Assistance, 
(never 
weary 
of 
honouring 
me) 
the 
means 
that 
at 
length 
I 
have 
had 
to 
publish 
it. 
May 
Your 
Highness 
therefore 
be 
pleased 
to 
accept 
of 
it 
according 
to 
Your 
accustomed 



Goodness; 
and 
if 
any 
thing 
shall 
be 
found 
therein, 
that 
may 
be 
subservient 
towards 
the 
information 
or 
satisfaction 
of 
those 
that 
are 
Lovers 
of 
Truth; 
let 
them 
acknowledge 
it 
to 
be 
due 
to 
Your 
Self, 
who 
are 
so 
expert 
in 
doing 
good, 
that 
Your 
Happy 
Dominion 
cannot 
shew 
the 
man 
that 
is 
concerned 
in 
any 
of 
those 
general 
Calamities 
that 
disturb 
the 
World; 
so 
that 
Praying 
for 
Your 
Prosperity,

in

SIR, 


I 
Humbly 
begge 
your 
Pardon 
for 
bringing 
this 
Book 
under 
your 
Protection. 
Were 
it 
a 
Work 
of 
my 
own, 
or 
I 
any 
thing 
but 
the 
Translatour, 
I 
should 
master 
my 
Thoughts 
to 
a 
meaner 
Dedication; 
But 
being 
a 
Collection 
of 
some 
of 
the 
greatest 
Masters 
in 
the 
World, 
and 
never 
made 
English 
till 
now, 
I 
conceived 
I 
might 
sooner 
procure 
their 
Welcome 
to 
a 
person 
so 
eminent 
for 
Noble 
Candor, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
all 
those 
Intellectual 
Excellencies 
wherewith 
Your 
Rich 
Soul 
is 
known 
to 
be 
furnished. 
I 
resolv’d 
to 
be 
as 
kind 
to 
this 
Book 
as 
I 
could, 
and 
seriously 
considering 
which 
way 
to 
effect 
it, 
I 
at 
last 
concluded 
to 
prefix 
Your 
Name, 
whom 
His 
Majesty 
and 
all 
his 
Subjects, 
(who 
have 
a 
higher 
Sense 
and 
Judgement 
of 
Excellent 
Parts) 
know 
best 
able 
to 
defend 
my 
Imperfections. 
And 
yet 
I 
confess 
there’s 
one 
thing 
makes 
against 
me, 
which 
is 
your 
eminent 
Integrity 
and 
great 
Affection 
to 
Truth, 
whereby 
my 
Lapses 
in 
a 
Work 
of 
this 
Nature 
might 
justly 
despair 
of 
Shelter, 
but 
that 
the 
Excellency 
of 
Your 
Native 
Candor 
strives 
for 
Predominancy 
over 
all 
Your 
great 
Abilities. 
For 
’tis 
all-most 
impossible 
to 
think 
what 
Your 
Matchless 
Wit 
is 
not 
able 
to 
Conquer, 
would 
Your 
known 
Modesty 
but 
give 
leave: 
therefore 
Galileus, 
Kepler, 
and 
those 
other 
Worthies 
in 
Learning 
are 
now 
brought 
before 
You 
in 
English 
Habit, 
having 
chang’d 
their 
Latine, 
Italian 
and 
French, 
whereby 
they 
were 
almost 
Strangers 
to 
our 
Nation, 
unless 
to 
such 
as 
You, 
who 
so 
perfectly 
master 
the 
Originals. 
I 
know 
you 
have 
so 
much 
and 
great 
imployment 
for 
His 
Majesty, 
and 
his 
good 
Subjects 
that 
I 
shall 
not 
robb 
you 
of 
another

READER, 



MATHEMATICAL 
Learning 
(to 
speak 
nothing 
touching 
the 
necessity 
& 
delight 
thereof; 
hath 
bin 
so 
sparingly 
imparted 
to 
our 
Countrymen 
in 
their 
native 
English, 
especially 
the 
nobler 
and 
sublimer 
part, 
that 
in 
Compliance 
with 
the 
Solicitations 
of 
several 
of 
my 
noble 
and 
learned 
Friends, 
and 
the 
Inclinations 
of 
such 
as 
are 
Mathematically 
disposed, 
more 
especially 
those, 
who 
either 
want 
Time 
or 
Patience 
to 
look 
into 
the 
vulgar 
and 
unstudied 
Languages, 
I 
did 
adventure 
upon 
this 
Work 
of 
Collecting 
& 
Translating 
from 
amongst 
the 
excellent 
Pieces 
that 
are 
so 
abounding 
in 
the 
Italian 
and 
French 
Tongues, 
some 
of 
those 
that 
my 
own 
observation 
and 
the 
intimation 
of 
Friends 
were 
most 
usefull 
and 
desired, 
and 
with 
all 
most 
wanting 
in 
their 
Own. 


I 
was, 
indeed, 
at 
first 
seriously 
Conscious, 
and 
am 
now, 
by 
experience, 
fully 
convinced 
how 
disproportionate 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
Enterprize 
is 
to 
the 
weakness 
of 
the 
Vndertaker, 
but 
yet 
the 
Passion 
I 
ever 
had 
to 
be 
subservient 
to 
my 
Friends 
and 
Compatriots 
in 
their 
Inquisition 
after 
these 
Sublime 
Studies, 
and 
a 
Patience 
which 
I 
owe 
to 
the 
Flegme 
that 
is 
predominant 
in 
my 
Constitution, 
joyned 
with 
a 
nine-years 
conversence 
in 
these 
Languages, 
as 
also 
an 
unhappy 
and 
long 
Vacation 
that 
the 
persecutions 
of 
the 
late 
Tyrants 
gave 
me 
from 
more 
advantagious 
employments 
so 
prevailed 
with 
me, 
that 
I 
resolved 
to 
improve 
even 
my 
very 
Confinement 
to 
serve 
those 
Friends, 
whom,astheTimes 
thenstood,Icouldnotsee. 


The 
Book 
being 
for 
Subject 
and 
Design 
intended 
chiefly 
for 
Gentlemen, 
I 
have 
bin 
as 
careless 
of 
using 
a 
studied 
Pedantry 
in 
my 
Style; 
as 
careful 
in 
contriving 
a 
pleasant 
and 
beautiful 
Impression. 
And 
when 
I 
had 
considered 
the 
hazard, 
and 
computed 
the 
charge 
of 
the 
undertaking, 
I 
found 
it 
to 
exceed 
the 
ability 
of 
a 
private 
Purse, 
especially 
of 
mine, 
that 
had 
bin 
so 
lately 
emptied 
by 
the 
hand 
of 
violent 
enemies, 
and 
perfidious 
friends; 
not 
to 
make 
mention 
here 
of 
the 
Sums 
that 
a 
Loyal 
Reflexion 
upon 
my 
Princes 
Affairs 
had 
at 
the 
same 
time 
drawn 
from 
me; 
and 
judg’d 
that 
the 
most 
safe, 
easy, 
and 
reasonable 
way 
was 
to 
invite 
those 
Persons 
who 
had 
appeared 
desirous 
of 
the 
Book, 
to 
be 
contributary 
to 
their 
own 
Contentment, 
by 
subscribing 
towards 
thechargeofthisPublication. 


And 
for 
the 
better 
management 
of 
the 
Work, 
I 
joyned 
to 
my 
self 
a 
Printer, 
whose 
Genius 
having 
rendered 
him 
Mathematical, 
and 
my 
overtures 
of 
profit 
having 
interessed 
his 
diligence, 
I 
was 
induced 
to 
promise 
my 
self 
a 
more 
than 
common 
Assistance 
from 
him: 
and 
at 
his 
door 
I 
with 
reason 
lay 
all 
miscarriages 
thatconcerns 
his 
Professioninthe 
Business. 



In 
this 
Work 
I 
found 
more 
than 
ordinary 
Encouragement 
from 
that 
publick 
spirited 
Person 
the 
Reverend 
and 
Learned 
Dr.

few 
others 
whose 
Modesty 
hath 
expresly 
enjoin’d 
me 
a 
concealment 
of 
their 
Names. 


Well, 
at 
length 
I 
have 
got 
to 
the 
end 
of 
my 
first 
Stage; 
and 
if 
I 
have 
not 
rid 
Post, 
let 
my 
excuse 
be 
that 
my 
long 
stay 
for 
my 
Warrant 
caused 
me 
to 
set 
out 
late; 
and 
being 
ill 
mounted, 
and 
in 
a 
road 
full 
of 
rubbs, 
I 
could 
not 
with 
any 
safety 
go 
faster; 
but 
hope 
to 
get 
it 
up 
in 
the 
next 
Stage, 
for 
in 
that 
I 
intend 
to 
shiftmyHorses. 


The 
names 
of 
those 
Authors 
and 
Treatices 
which 
I 
judged 
would 
most 
grace 
our 
Language, 
and 
gratify 
Students, 
are 
particularly 
exprest 
in 
the 
General 
Title 
of 
the 
two 
Tomes. 
Distinct 
Tomes 
they 
are 
as 
consisting 
of 
several 
Pieces: 
Collections 
I 
call 
them, 
because 
they 
have 
bin 
so 
published, 
disperst, 
and 
worn 
out 
of 
Print, 
that 
they 
very 
rarely 
meet 
in 
one 
hand: 
and 
Translations 
I 
own 
them 
to 
be, 
as 
not 
pretending 
to 
any 
thing 
more 
than 
the 
disposure 
and 
conversion 
of 
them: 
those 
Tracts 
only 
excepted 
which 
composethesecond 
Partofthesecond 
Tome. 


The 
first 
Book 
which 
offers 
it 
self 
to 
your 
view 
in 
this 
Tome 
is 
that 
singular 
and 
unimitable 
Piece 
of 
Reason 
and 
Demonstration 
the 
Systeme 
of 
Galileo. 
The 
subject 
of 
it 
is 
a 
new 
and 
Noble 
p 
rt 
of 
Astronomy, 
to 
wit 
the 
Doctrine 
and 
Hypothesis 
of 
the 
Mobility 
of 
the 
Earth 
and 
the 
Stability 
of 
the 
Sun; 
the 
History 
whereof 
I 
shall 
hereafter 
give 
you 
at 
large 
in 
the 
Life 
of 
that 
famous 
Man. 
Only 
this 
by 
the 
by; 
that 
the 
Reader 
may 
not 
wonder 
why 
these 
Dialogues 
found 
so 
various 
entertainment 
in 
Italy 
(for 
he 
cannot 
but 
have 
heard 
that 
though 
they 
have 
been 
with 
all 
veneration 
valued, 
read 
& 
applauded 
by 
the 
Iudicious, 
yet 
they 
were 
with 
much 
detestation 
persecuted, 
suppressed 
& 
exploded 
by 
the 
Superstitious) 
I 
am 
to 
tell 
him 
that 
our 
Author 
having 
assigned 
his 
intimate 
Friends 
Salviati 
and 
Sagredo 
the 
more 
successfull 
Parts 
of 
the 
Challenger, 
and 
Moderater, 
he 
made 
the 
famous 
Commentator 
Simplicius 
to 
personate 
the 
Peripatetick. 
The 
Book 
coming 
out, 
and 
Pope 
Urban 
the 
VIII. 
taking 
his 
Honour 
to 
be 
concern’d 
as 
having 
in 
his 
private 
Capacity 
bin 
very 
positive 
in 
declaiming 
against 
the 
Samian 
Philosophy, 
and 
now 
(as 
he 
supposed) 
being 
ill 
delt 
with 
by 
Galileo 
who 
had 
summed 
up 
all 
his 
Arguments, 
and 
put 
them 
into 
the 
mouth 
of 
Simplicius; 
his 



Holiness 
thereupon 
conceived 
an 
implacable 
Displeasure 
against 
our 
Author, 
and 
thinking 
no 
other 
revenge 
sufficient, 
he 
employed 
his 
Apostolical 
Authority, 
and 
deals 
with 
the 
Consistory 
to 
condemn 
him 
and 
proscribe 
his 
Book 
as 
Heretical; 
prostituting 
the 
Censure 
of 
the 
Church 
to 
his 
private 
revenge. 
This 
was 
Galileo’s 
fortune 
in 
Italy: 
but 
had 
I 
not 
reason 
to 
hope 
that 
the 
English 
will 
be 
more 
hospitable, 
on 
the 
account 
of 
that 
Principle 
which 
induceth 
them 
to 
be 
civil 
to 
(I 
say 
not 
to 
dote 
on) 
Strangers, 
I 
should 
fear 
to 
be 
charged 
with 
imprudence 
for 
appearing 
an 
Interpreter 
to 
that 
great 
Philosopher. 
And 
in 
this 
confidence 
I 
shall 
forbear 
to 
make 
any 
large 
Exordium 
concerning 
him 
or 
his 
Book: 
& 
the 
rather 
in 
regard 
that 
such 
kind 
of 
Gauderies 
become 
not 
the 
Gravity 
of 
the 
Subject; 
as 
also 
knowing 
how 
much 
(coming 
from 
me) 
they 
must 
fall 
short 
of 
the 
Merits 
of 
it, 
or 
him: 
but 
principally 
because 
I 
court 
only 
persons 
of 
Judgement 
& 
Candor, 
that 
can 
distinguish 
between 
a 
Native 
Beauty, 
and 
spurious 
Vernish. 
This 
only 
let 
me 
premise, 
though 
more 
to 
excuse 
my 
weakness 
in 
the 
menaging, 
than 
to 
insinuate 
my 
ability 
in 
accomplishing 
this 
so 
arduous 
a 
Task, 
that 
these 
profound 
Dialogues 
have 
bin 
found 
so 
uneasy 
to 
Translate, 
that 
neither 
affectation 
of 
Novelty 
could 
induce 
the 
French, 
nor 
the 
Translating 
humour 
perswade 
the 
Germans 
to 
undertake 
them. 
This 
difficulty, 
as 
I 
conceived, 
was 
charged 
either 
upon 
the 
Intricacy 
of 
this 
manner 
of 
Writing, 
or 
upon 
the 
singular 
Elegance 
in 
the 
stile 
of 
Galileo, 
or 
else 
upon 
the 
miscarriage 
of 
the 
unfortunate 
Mathias 
Berneggeius 
who 
first 
attempted 
to 
turn 
them 
into 
Latine 
forthebenefitoftheLearned 
World. 


I 
shall 
not 
presume 
to 
Censure 
the 
Censure 
which 
the 
Church 
of 
Rome 
past 
upon 
this 
Doctrine 
and 
its 
Assertors. 
But, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
my 
Author 
having 
bin 
indefinite 
in 
his 
discourse, 
I 
shall 
forbear 
to 
exasperate, 
and 
attempt 
to 
reconcile 
such 
persons 
to 
this 
Hypothesis 
as 
devout 
esteem 
for 
Holy 
Scripture, 
and 
dutifull 
Respect 
to 
Canonical 
Injunctions 
hath 
made 
to 
stand 
off 
from 
this 
Opinion: 
and 
therefore 
for 
their 
sakes 
I 
have 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Dialogues 
by 
way 
of 
supplement 
added 
an 
Epistle 
of 
Galileo 
to 
Her 
Most 
Serene 
Highness 
Christina 
Lotharinga 
the 
Grand 
Dutchesse 
Mother 
of 
Tuscany; 
as 
also 
certain 
Abstracts 
of 
John 
Kepler, 
Mathematician 
to 
two 
Emperours, 
and 
Didacus 
à 
Stunica 
a 
famous 
Divine 
of 
Salamanca, 
with 
an 
Epistle 
of 
Paulo 
Antonio 
Foscarini 
a 
learned 
Carmelite 
of 
Naples, 
that 
shew 
theAuthority 
of 
Sacred 
Scripture 
in 
determiningof 
Philosophicaland 
Natural 
Controversies: 
hoping 
that 
the 
ingenious 
& 
impartial 
Reader 
will 
meet 
with 
full 
satisfaction 
in 
the 
same. 
And 
least 
what 
I 
have 
spoken 
of 
the 
prohibiting 



of 
these 
Pieces 
by 
the 
Inquisition 
may 
deterre 
any 
scrupulous 
person 
from 
reading 
of 
them, 
I 
have 
purposely 
inserted 
the 
Imprimatur 
by 
which 
that 
Office 
licenced 
them. 
And 
for 
a 
larger 
account 
of 
the 
Book 
or 
Author, 
I 
refer 
you 
to 
the 
Relation 
of 
his 
Life, 
which 
shall 
bring 
up 
the 
Reare 
in 
the 
Second 
Tome. 


What 
remains 
of 
this, 
is 
that 
Excellent 
Discourse 
of 
D. 
Benedetto 
Castelli 
Abbate 
di 
San 
Benedetto 
Aloysio, 
concerning 
the 
Mensuration 
of 
Running 
Waters, 
with 
other 
Treatises 
of 
that 
Learned 
Prelate, 
& 
of 
the 
Superintendent 
Corsini. 
Some 
may 
alledge, 
and 
I 
doe 
confess 
that 
I 
promised 
to 
publish 
the 
Life 
of 
Galileo 
in 
this 
place: 
But 
the 
great 
miscarriages 
of 
Letters 
from 
some 
Friends 
in 
Italy 
and 
else 
where, 
to 
whom 
I 
am 
a 
Debtor 
for 
several 
Remarques, 
& 
from 
whom 
I 
daily 
expect 
yet 
greater 
Helps 
concerning 
the 
History 
of 
that 
famous 
Personage: 
these 
disappointments, 
I 
say, 
joyned 
with 
the 
undeniable 
Request 
of 
some 
Friends, 
who 
were 
impatient 
to 
see 
Castelli 
in 
English, 
together 
with 
a 
consideration 
of 
the 
disproportionate 
Bulk 
that 
would 
otherwise 
have 
bin 
betwixt 
the 
two 
Volumes, 
perswaded 
me 
to 
this 
exchange. 
This 
deviation 
from 
my 
Promise 
I 
hope 
is 
Venial, 
and 
for 
the 
expiating 
of 
it 
I 
plead 
Supererrogation: 
having 
in 
each 
Tome 
made 
so 
large 
Aditions 
(though 
to 
my 
great 
expense) 
that 
they 
make 
neer 
a 
third 
part 
more 
than 
I 
stood 
by 
promise 
bound 
to 
Publish. 
That 
this 
is 
so 
will 
appear 
by 
comparing 
the 
Contents 
I 
here 
prefix 
with 
the 
Advertisment 
I 
formerly 
Printed. 
For 
not 
to 
mention 
those 
Epitomes 
of 
Kepler 
and 
à 
Stunica, 
the 
whole 
second 
and 
following 
Books 
of 
Castelli, 
were 
not 
come 
to 
my 
hands 
at 
the 
time 
of 
my 
penning 
that 
Paper; 
yet 
knowing 
how 
imperfect 
the 
Volume 
would 
be 
without 
them, 
they 
being 
partly 
a 
supplement 
to 
the 
Theoremes 
and 
Problemes 
whichthe 
Abbothad 
formerly 
Printed, 
and 
partly 
experiments 
that 
had 
procured 
him 
and 
his 
Doctrine 
a 
very 
great 
Reputation, 
knowing 
this 
I 
say, 
I 
apprehended 
a 
necessity 
of 
publishing 
them 
with 
the 
rest: 
and 
hope 
that 
if 
youthink 
notthe 
serviceI 
havedone 
therein 
worth 
your 
acknowledgement, 
you 
will 
yet 
at 
least 
account 
the 
encrease 
of 
my 
expence 
a 
sufficient 
extenuation 
of 
the 
Trespass 
that 
those 
Additions 
have 
forced 
me 
to 
commit 
uponyour 
PatienceinpointofTime. 


As 
for 
the 
second 
Tome, 
I 
have 
only 
this 
to 
assure 
the 
Generous 
Readers; 
1 
that 
I 
am 
very 
confident 
I 
shall 
be 
much 
more 
punctual 
in 
publishing 
that, 
than 
(for 
the 
reasons 
above 
related.) 
I 
was 
able 
to 
be 
in 
setting 
forth 
this: 
2 
that 
they 
shall 
not 
be 
abused 
in 
advancing 
of 
their 
moneys, 
(as 
hath 
bin 
used 
in 
the 
like 
case) 
by 
selling 
the 
remaining 
Copyes 
at 
an 
under 
rate; 
and 
3 
that 
I 



have 
a 
very 
great 
care 
that 
no 
disesteem 
may 
by 
my 
means 
arise 
unto 
this 
way 
of 
publishing 
Books, 
for 
that 
it 
is 
of 
excellent 
use 
in 
ushering 
Great 
and 
Costly 
Volumesinto 
theWorld. 


To 
say 
nothing 
of 
the 
disadvantages 
of 
Translations 
in 
general, 
this 
of 
mine 
doubtless 
is 
not 
without 
it’s 
Errours, 
and 
oversights: 
but 
those 
of 
the 
Printer 
discounted, 
I 
hope 
the 
rest 
may 
be 
allowed 
me 
upon 
the 
score 
of 
Human 
Imbecilitie. 
The 
truth 
is, 
I 
have 
assumed 
the 
Liberty 
to 
note 
the 
MistakesintheFloridVersionof 
Berneggerusinthe 
Margent,notsomuch 
to 
reproach 
him, 
as 
to 
convince 
those 
who 
told 
me 
that 
they 
accounted 
my 
pains 
needless, 
having 
his 
Latine 
Translation 
by 
them. 
The 
like 
they 
said 
of 
the 
whole 
two 
Tomes: 
but 
they 
thereby 
caused 
me 
to 
question 
their 
Understanding 
or 
Veracity. 
For 
some 
of 
the 
Books 
were 
yet 
never 
extant: 
As 
for 
instance; 
the 
Mechanicks 
of 
Monsieur 
Des 
Cartes, 
a 
Manuscript 
which 
I 
found 
amongst 
the 
many 
other 
Rarities 
that 
enrich 
the 
well-chosen 
Library 
of 
my 
Learned 
and 
Worthy 
Friend 
Dr. 
Charles 
Scarburgh; 
the 
Experiments 
of 
Gravity, 
and 
the 
Life 
of 
Galileo, 
both 
my 
own: 
Others 
were 
included 
in 
Volumes 
of 
great 
price, 
or 
so 
dispersed 
that 
they 
were 
not 
to 
be 
purchased 
for 
any 
money; 
as 
those 
of 
Kepler, 
à 
Stunica, 
Archimedes, 
Tartaglia, 
and 
the 
Mechanicks 
of 
Galileo: 
And 
the 
remainder, 
though 
easyer 
to 
procure, 
were 
harder 
to 
be 
understood; 
as 
Tartaglia 
his 
notes 
on 
Archimedes, 
Torricellio 
his 
Doctrine 
of 
Projects, 
Galileo 
his 
Epistle 
to 
the 
Dutchesse 
of 
Tuscany, 
and 
above 
all 
his 
Dialogues 
de 
Motu; 
(never 
till 
now 
done 
into 
any 
Language) 
which 
were 
so 
intermixt 
of 
Latine 
and 
Italian, 
that 
the 
difficulty 
of 
the 
Stile, 
joyned 
with 
the 
intricatnesse 
of 
the 
Subject 
rendered 
them 
Unpleasant, 
if 
not 
wholly 
Vnintelligible, 
to 
such 
as 
were 
not 
absolute 
Masters 
of 
both 
the 
Tongues. 


To 
conclude; 
according 
to 
the 
entertainment 
that 
you 
please 
to 
afford 
these 
Collections, 
I 
shall 
be 
encouraged 
to 
proceed 
with 
the

THE 
AUTHOR’S 
INTRODUCTION. 


JudiciousReader, 


THERE 
was 
published 
some 
years 
since 
in 
Rome 
a 
salutiferous 
Edict, 
that, 
for 
the 
obviating 
of 
the 
dangerous 
Scandals 
of 
the 
present 
Age, 
imposed 
a 
seasonable 
Silence 
upon 
the 
Pythagorean 
Opinion 
of 
the 
Mobility 
of 
the 
Earth. 
There 
want 
not 
such 
as 
unadvisedly 
affirm, 
that 
that 
Decree 
was 
not 
the 
production 
of 
a 
sober 
Scrutiny, 
but 
of 
an 
illinformed 
Passion; 
& 
one 
may 
hear 
some 
mutter 
that 
Consultors 
altogether 
ignorant 
of 
Astronomical 
Observations 
ought 
not 
to 
clipp 
the 
Wings 
of 
Speculative 
Wits 
with 
rash 
Prohibitions. 
My 
zeale 
cannot 
keep 
silence 
when 
I 
hear 
these 
inconsiderate 
complaints. 
I 
thought 
fit, 
as 
being 
thoroughly 
acquainted 
with 
that 
prudent 
Determination, 
to 
appear 
openly 
upon 
the 
Theatre 
of 
the 
World 
as 
a 
Witness 
of 
the 
naked 
Truth. 
I 
was 
at 
that 
time 
in 
Rome; 
and 
had 
not 
only 
the 
audiences, 
but 
applauds 
of 
the 
most 
Eminent 
Prelates 
of 
that 
Court; 
nor 
was 
that 
Decree 
Published 
without 
Previous 
Notice 
given 
me 
thereof. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
my 
resolution 
in 
the 
present 
case 
to 
give 
Foraign 
Nations 
to 
see, 
that 
this 
point 
is 
as 
well 
understood 
in 
Italy, 
and 
particularly 
in 
Rome, 
as 
Transalpine 
Diligence 
can 
imagine 
it 
to 
be: 
and 
collecting 
together 
all 
the 
proper 
Speculations 
that 
concern 
the 
Copernican 
Systeme, 
to 
let 
them 
know, 
that 
the 
notice 
of 
all 
preceded 
the 
Censure 
of 
the 
Roman 
Court; 
and 
that 
there 
proceed 
from 
this 
Climate 
not 
only 
Doctrines 
for 
the 
health 
of 
the 
Soul, 
but 
also 
ingenious 
Discoveriesforthe 
recreatingof 
the 
Mind. 


To 
this 
end 
I 
have 
personated 
the 
Copernican 
in 
this 
Discourse; 
proceeding 
upon 
an 
Hypothesis 
purely 
Mathematical; 
striving 
by 
all 
artificial 
wayes 
to 
represent 
it 
Superiour, 
not 
to 
that 
of 
the 
Immobility 
of 
the 
Earth 
absolutely, 
but 
according 
as 
it 
is 
mentioned 
by 
some, 
that 
retein 
no 
more, 
but 
the 
name 
of 
Peripateticks, 
and 
are 
content, 
without 
going 
farther, 
to 
adore 
Shadows, 
not 
philosophizing 
with 
requisit 
caution, 
but 
with 
the 
sole 
remembranceoffourPrinciples,butbadlyunderstood. 


We 
shall 
treat 
of 
three 
principall 
heads. 
First 
I 
will 
endeavour 
to 
shew 
that 
all 
Experiments 
that 
can 
be 
made 
upon 
the 
Earth 
are 
insufficient 
means 
to 
conclude 
it’s 
Mobility, 
but 
are 
indifferently 
applicable 
to 
the 
Earth 
moveable 
or 
immoveable: 
and 
I 
hope 
that 
on 
this 
occasion 
we 
shall 
discover 
many 
observable 
passages 
unknown 
to 
the 
Ancients. 
Secondly 
we 
will 
examine 
the 
Coelestiall 
Phoenomena 
that 
make 
for 
the 
Copernican 
Hypothesis, 
as 
if 
it 



were 
to 
prove 
absolutely 
victorious; 
adding 
by 
the 
way 
certain 
new 
Observations, 
which 
yet 
serve 
only 
for 
the 
Astronomical 
Facility, 
not 
for 
Natural 
Necessity. 
In 
the 
third 
place 
I 
will 
propose 
an 
ingenuous 
Fancy. 
I 
remember 
that 
I 
have 
said 
many 
years 
since, 
that 
the 
unknown 
Probleme 
of 
the 
Tide 
might 
receive 
some 
light, 
admitting 
the 
Earths 
Motion. 
This 
Position 
of 
mine 
passing 
from 
one 
to 
another 
had 
found 
charitable 
Fathers 
that 
adopted 
it 
for 
the 
Issue 
of 
their 
own 
wit. 
Now, 
because 
no 
stranger 
may 
ever 
appear 
that 
defending 
himself 
with 
our 
armes, 
shall 
charge 
us 
with 
want 
of 
caution 
in 
so 
principal 
an 
Accident, 
I 
have 
thought 
good 
to 
lay 
down 
those 
probabilities 
that 
would 
render 
it 
credible, 
admitting 
that 
the 
Earth 
did 
move. 
I 
hope, 
that 
by 
these 
Considerations 
the 
World 
will 
come 
to 
know, 
that 
if 
other 
Nations 
have 
Navigated 
more 
than 
we, 
we 
have 
not 
studied 
less 
than 
they; 
& 
that 
our 
returning 
to 
assert 
the 
Earths 
Stability, 
and 
to 
take 
the 
contrary 
only 
for 
a 
Mathematical 
Capriccio, 
proceeds 
not 
from 
inadvertency 
of 
what 
others 
have 
thought 
thereof, 
but 
(had 
we 
no 
other 
inducements) 
from 
those 
Reasons 
that 
Pi 
ty, 
Religion, 
the 
Knowledge 
of 
the 
Divine 
Omnipotency, 
and 
a 
consciousness 
of 
the 
incapacity 
of 
mans 
Vnderstanding 
dictateunto 
us. 


With 
all 
I 
conceived 
it 
very 
proper 
to 
express 
these 
conceits 
by 
way 
of 
Dialogue, 
which, 
as 
not 
being 
bound 
up 
to 
the 
riggid 
observance 
of 
Mathematical 
Laws, 
gives 
place 
also 
to 
Digressions 
that 
are 
sometimes 
no 
less 
curiousthantheprincipalArgument. 


I 
chanced 
to 
be 
several 
years 
since, 
at 
several 
times, 
in 
the 
Stupendious 
Citty 
of 
Venice, 
where 
I 
conversed 
with 
Signore 
Giovan 
Francesco 
Sagredo 
of 
a 
Noble 
Extraction, 
and 
piercing 
wit. 
There 
came 
thither 
from 
Florence 
at 
the 
same 
time 
Signore 
Filippo 
Salviati, 
whose 
least 
glory 
was 
the 
Eminence 
of 
his 
Blood, 
and 
Magnificence 
of 
his 
Estate: 
a 
sublime 
Wit 
that 
fed 
not 
more 
hungerly 
upon 
any 
pleasure 
than 
on 
elevated 
Speculations. 
In 
the 
company 
of 
these 
two 
I 
often 
discoursed 
of 
these 
matters 
before 
a 
certain 
Peripatetick 
Philosopher 
who 
seemed 
to 
have 
no 
geater 
obstacle 
in 
understanding 
of 
the 
Truth,thantheFamehehadacquiredby 
AristotelicalInterpretations. 


Now, 
seeing 
that 
inexorable 
Death 
hath 
deprived 
Venice 
and 
Florence 
of 
those 
two 
great 
Lights 
in 
the 
very 
Meridian 
of 
their 
years, 
I 
did 
resolve, 
as 
far 
as 
my 
poor 
ability 
would 
permit, 
to 
perpetuate 
their 
lives 
to 
their 
honour 
in 
these 
leaves, 
bringing 
them 
in 
as 
Interlocutors 
in 
the 
present 
Controversy. 
Nor 
shall 
the 
Honest 
Peripatetick 
want 
his 
place, 
to 
whom 
for 
his 
excessive 
affection 
towards 
the 
Commentaries 
of 
Simplicius, 
I 
thought 
fit, 
without 



mentioning 
his 
own 
Name, 
to 
leave 
that 
of 
the 
Author 
he 
so 
much 
respected. 
Let 
those 
two 
great 
Souls, 
ever 
venerable 
to 
my 
heart, 
please 
to 
accept 
this 
publickMonumentofmynever-dyingLove;andlettheremembrance 
oftheir 
Eloquence 
assist 
me 
in 
delivering 
to 
Posterity 
the 
Considerations 
that 
I 
have 
promised. 


There 
casually 
happened 
(as 
was 
usuall) 
several 
discourses 
at 
times 
between 
these 
Gentlemen, 
the 
which 
had 
rather 
inflamed 
than 
satisfied 
in 
their 
wits 
the 
thirst 
they 
had 
to 
be 
learning; 
whereupon 
they 
took 
a 
discreet 
resolution 
to 
meet 
together 
for 
certain 
dayes, 
in 
which 
all 
other 
business 
set 
aside, 
they 
might 
betake 
themselves 
more 
methodically 
to 
contemplate 
the 
Wonders 
of 
God 
in 
Heaven, 
and 
in 
the 
Earth: 
the 
place 
appointed 
for 
their 
meeting 
being 
in 
the 
Palace 
of 
the 
Noble 
Sagredo, 
after 
the 
due, 
but 
very

THE 
FIRST 
DIALOGUE. 


INTERLOCVTORS. 
SALVIATUS,SAGREDUS,andSIMPLICIUS. 


SALVIATUS. 


IT 
was 
our 
yesterdayes 
resolution, 
and 
agreement, 
that 
we 
should 
to 
day 
discourse 
the 
most 
distinctly, 
and 
particularly 
we 
could 
possible, 
of 
the 
natural 
reasons, 
and 
their 
efficacy 
that 
have 
been 
hitherto 
alledged 
on 
the 
one 
or 
other 
part, 
by 
the 
maintainers 
of 
the 
Positions, 
Aristotelian, 
and 
Ptolomaique; 
Copernicus 
reputeth 
the 
Earth 
a 
Globe 
like 
to 
a 
Planet. 
and 
by 
the 
followers 
of 
the 
Copernican 
Systeme: 
And 
because 
Copernicus 
placing 
the 
Earth 
among 
the 
moveable 
Bodies 
of 
Heaven, 
comes 
to 
constitute 
a 
Globe 
for 
the 
fame 
like 
to 
a 
Planet; 
it 
would 
be 
good 
that 
we 
began 
our 
disputation 
with 
the 
examination 
of 
what, 
and 
how 
great 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
Peripateticks 
arguments 
is, 
when 
they 
demonstrate, 
that 
this 
Hypothesis 
is 
impossible: 
Since 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
introduce 
in 
Nature, 
Coelestial 
substances 
that 
are 
in 
alterable 
and 
Elementary 
that 
be 
alterable, 
art 
necessary 
in 
the 
opinion 
of 
Aristotle. 
substances 
different 
betwixt 
themselves, 
that 
is, 
the 
Coelestial, 
and 
Elementary; 
that 
impassible 
and 
immortal, 
this 
alterable 
and 
corruptible. 
Which 
argument 
Aristotle 
handleth 
in 
his 
book 
De 
Coelo, 
insinuating 
it 
first, 
by 
some 
discourses 
dependent 
on 
certain 
general 
assumptions, 
and 
afterwards 
confirming 
it 
with 
experiments 
and 
perticular 
demonstrations: 
following 
the 
same 
method, 
I 
will 
propound, 
and 
freely 
speak 
my 
judgement, 
submitting 
my 
self 
to 
your 
censure, 
and 
particularly 
to 
Simplicius,a 
Stout 
ChampionandcontenderfortheAristotelianDoctrine. 


And 
the 
first 
Step 
of 
the 
Peripatetick 
arguments 
is 
that, 
Aristotle 
maketh 
the 
World 
perfect, 
because 
it 
hath 
the 
threefold 
demension. 
where 
Aristotle 
proveth 
the 
integrity 
and 
perfection 
of 
the 
World, 
telling 
us, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
a 
simple 
line, 
nor 
a 
bare 
superficies, 
but 
a 
body 
adorned 
with 
Longitude, 
Latitude, 
and 
Profundity; 
and 
because 
there 
are 
no 
more 
dimensions 
but 
these 
three; 
The 
World 
having 
them, 
hath 
all, 
and 
having 
all, 
is 
to 
be 
concluded 
perfect. 
And 
again, 
that 
by 
simple 
length, 
that 
magnitude 
is 
constituted, 
which 
is 
called 
a 
Line, 
to 
which 
adding 
breadth, 
there 
is 
framed 
the 
Superficies, 
and 
yet 
further 
adding 
the 
altitude 
or 
profoundity, 
there 
results 
the 
Body, 
and 
after 
these 
three 
dimensions 
there 
is 
no 
passing 
farther, 
so 
that 



in 
these 
three 
the 
integrity, 
and 
to 
so 
speak, 
totality 
is 
terminated, 
which 
I 
might 
but 
with 
justice 
have 
required 
Aristotle 
to 
have 
proved 
to 
me 
by 
necessary 
consequences, 
the 
rather 
in 
regard 
he 
was 
able 
to 
do 
it 
very 
plainly, 
and 
speedily. 


SIMPL. 


What 
say 
you 
to 
the 
excellent 
demonstrations 
in 
the 
2. 
3. 
and 
4. 
Texts, 
Aristotles 
demonstrations▪ 
to 
prove 
the 
dimensions 
to 
be 
three 
and 
no 
more. 
after 
the 
definition 
of 
Continual? 
have 
you 
it 
not 
first 
there 
proved, 
that 
there 
is 
no 
more 
but 
three 
dimensions, 
for 
that 
those 
three 
are 
all 
things, 
and 
that 
they 
are 
every 
where? 
And 
is 
not 
this 
confirmed 
by 
the 
Doctrine 
and 
Authority 
of 
the 
Pythagorians, 
The 
number 
three 
celebrated 
amongst 
the 
Pythagorians 
who 
say 
that 
all 
things 
are 
determined 
by 
three, 
beginning, 
middle, 
and 
end, 
which 
is 
the 
number 
of 
All? 
And 
where 
leave 
you 
that 
reason, 
namely, 
that 
as 
it 
were 
by 
the 
law 
of 
Nature, 
this 
number 
is 
used 
in 
the 
sacrifices 
of 
the 
Gods? 
And 
why 
being 
so 
dictated 
by 
nature, 
do 
we 
atribute 
to 
those 
things 
that 
are 
three, 
and 
not 
to 
lesse, 
the 
title 
of 
all? 
why 
of 
two 
is 
it 
said 
both, 
and 
not 
all, 
unless 
they 
be 
three? 
And 
all 
this 
Doctrine 
you 
have 
in 
the 
second 
Text. 
Afterwards 
in 
the 
third, 
Ad 
pleniorem 
scientiam, 
Omne, 
Totum 
& 
Perfectum. 
we 
read 
that 
All, 
the 
Whole, 
and 
Perfect, 
are 
formally 
one 
and 
the 
same; 
and 
that 
therefore 
onely 
the 
Body, 
amongst 
magnitudes 
is 
perfect: 
because 
it 
is 
determined 
by 
three, 
which 
is 
All, 
and 
being 
divisible 
three 
manner 
of 
waies, 
it 
is 
every 
way 
divisible; 
but 
of 
the 
others, 
some 
are 
dividible 
in 
one 
manner, 
and 
some 
in 
two, 
because 
according 
to 
the 
number 
affixed, 
they 
have 
their 
division 
and 
continuity, 
and 
thus 
one 
magnitude 
is 
continuate 
one 
way, 
Or 
Solid. 
another 
two, 
a 
third, 
namely 
the 
Body, 
every 
way. 
Moreover 
in 
the 
fourth 
Text; 
doth 
he 
not 
after 
some 
other 
Doctrines, 
prove 
it 
by 
another 
demonstration? 
Scilicet, 
That 
no 
transition 
is 
made 
but 
according 
to 
some 
defect 
(and 
so 
there 
is 
a 
transition 
or 
passing 
from 
the 
line 
to 
the 
superficies, 
because 
the 
line 
is 
defective 
in 
breadth) 
and 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
the 
perfect 
to 
want 
any 
thing, 
it 
being 
every 
way 
so; 
therefore 
there 
is 
no 
transition 
from 
the 
Solid 
or 
Body 
to 
any 
other 
magnitude. 
Now 
think 
you 
not 
that 
by 
all 
these 
places 
he 
hath 
sufficiently 
proved, 
how 
that 
there’s 
no 
going 
beyond 
the 
three 
dimensions, 
Length, 
Breadth, 
and 
Thickness, 
and 
that 
therefore 
the 
body 
or 
solid, 
which 
haththemall, 
isperfect? 



SALV. 


To 
tell 
you 
true, 
I 
think 
not 
my 
self 
bound 
by 
all 
these 
reasons 
to 
grant 
any 
more 
but 
onely 
this, 
That 
that 
which 
hath 
beginning, 
middle, 
and 
end, 
may, 
and 
ought 
to 
be 
called 
perfect: 
But 
that 
then, 
because 
beginning, 
middle, 
and 
end, 
are 
Three, 
the 
number 
Three 
is 
a 
perfect 
number, 
and 
hath 
a 
faculty 
of 
conferring 
Perfection 
on 
those 
things 
that 
have 
the 
same, 
I 
find 
no 
inducement 
to 
grant; 
neitherdo 
I 
understand, 
norbelieve 
that, 
for 
example, 
of 
feet, 
the 
number 
three 
is 
more 
perfect 
then 
four 
or 
two, 
nor 
do 
I 
conceive 
the 
number 
four 
to 
be 
any 
imperfection 
to 
the 
Elements: 
and 
that 
they 
would 
be 
more 
perfect 
if 
they 
were 
three. 
Better 
therefore 
it 
had 
been 
to 
have 
left 
these 
subtleties 
to 
the 
Rhetoricians, 
and 
to 
have 
proved 
his 
intent, 
by 
necessary 
demonstration;for 
soitbehoves 
todoin 
demonstrative 
sciences. 


SIMPL. 


You 
seem 
to 
scorn 
these 
reasons, 
and 
yet 
it 
is 
all 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
the 
Pythagorians, 
who 
attribute 
so 
much 
to 
numbers; 
and 
you 
that 
be 
a 
Mathematician, 
and 
believe 
many 
opinions 
in 
the 
Pythagorick 
Philosophy, 
seemnowtocontemntheir 
Mysteries. 


SALV. 


That 
the 
Pythagorians 
had 
the 
science 
of 
numbers 
in 
high 
esteem, 
and 
that 
Plato 
himself 
admired 
humane 
understanding, 
Plato 
held 
that 
humane 
understanding 
partook 
of 
divinity, 
because 
it 
understood 
numbers. 
and 
thought 
that 
it 
pertook 
of 
Divinity, 
for 
that 
it 
understood 
the 
nature 
of 
numbers, 
I 
know 
very 
well, 
nor 
should 
I 
be 
far 
from 
being 
of 
the 
same 
opinion: 
But 
that 
the 
Mysteries 
for 
which 
Pythagoras 
and 
his 
sect, 
had 
the 
Science 
of 
numbers 
in 
such 
veneration, 
are 
the 
follies 
that 
abound 
in 
the 
mouths 
and 
writings 
of 
the 
vulgar, 
The 
Mystery 
of 
Pythagorick 
numbers 
fabulous. 
I 
no 
waies 
credit: 
but 
rather 
because 
I 
know 
that 
they, 
to 
the 
end 
admirable 
things 
might 
not 
be 
exposed 
to 
the 
contempt, 
and 
scorne 
of 
the 
vulgar, 
censured 
as 
sacrilegious, 
the

of 
Numbers,

and 
incommensurable 
and 
irrational 
quantities, 
by 
them 
investigated; 
and 
divulged, 
that 
he 
who 
discovered 
them, 
was 
tormented 
in 
the 
other 
World: 
I 
believe 
that 
some 
one 
of 
them 
to 
deter 
the 
common 
sort, 
and 
free 
himself 
from 
their 
inquisitiveness, 



told 
them 
that 
the 
mysteries 
of 
numbers 
were 
those 
trifles, 
which 
afterwards 
did 
so 
spread 
amongst 
the 
vulgar; 
and 
this 
with 
a 
discretion 
and 
subtlety 
resembling 
that 
of 
the 
prudent 
young 
man, 
that 
to 
be 
freed 
from 
the 
importunity 
of 
his 
inquisitive 
Mother 
or 
Wife, 
I 
know 
not 
whether, 
who 
pressed 
him 
to 
impart 
the 
secrets 
of 
the 
Senate, 
contrived 
that 
story, 
which 
afterwards 
brought 
her 
and 
many 
other 
women 
to 
be 
derided 
and 
laught 
at

SIMPL. 


I 
will 
not 
be 
of 
the 
number 
of 
those 
who 
are 
over 
curious 
about 
the 
Pythagorick 
mysteries; 
but 
adhering 
to 
the 
point 
in 
hand; 
I 
reply, 
that 
the 
reasons 
produced 
by 
Aristotle 
to 
prove 
the 
dimensions 
to 
be 
no 
more 
than 
three, 
seem 
to 
me 
concludent, 
and 
I 
believe, 
That 
had 
there 
been 
any 
more 
evidentdemonstrations 
thereof,Aristotlewouldnothaveomittedthem. 


SAGR. 


Put 
in 
at 
least, 
if 
he 
had 
known, 
or 
remembred 
any 
more. 
But 
you 
Salviatus 
would 
do 
me 
a 
great 
pleasure 
to 
alledge 
unto 
me 
some 
arguments 
that 
may 
be 
evident,andclearenoughformetocomprehend. 


SALV. 


I 
will; 
and 
they 
shall 
be 
such 
as 
are 
not 
onely 
to 
be 
apprehended 
by 
you, 
but 
even 
by 
Simplicius 
himself: 
nor 
onely 
to 
be 
comprehended, 
but 
are 
also 
already 
known, 
although 
haply 
unobserved; 
and 
for 
the 
more 
easie 
understanding 
thereof, 
we 
will 
take 
this 
Pen 
and 
Ink, 
which 
I 
see 
already 
prepared 
for 
such 
occasions, 
A 
Geometrical 
demonstration 
of 
the 
triple 
dimension. 
and 
describe 
a 
few 
figures. 
And 
first 
we 
will 
note 
[Fig. 
1. 
at 
the 
end 
of 
this 
Dialog. 
] 
these 
two 
points 
AB, 
and 
draw 
from 
the 
one 
to 
the 
other 
the 
curved 
lines, 
ACB, 
and 
ADB, 
and 
the 
right 
line 
AB, 
I 
demand 
of 
you 
which 
of 
them, 
in 
your 
mind, 
is 
that 
which 
determines 
the 
distance 
between 
theterms 
AB, 
&why? 


SAGR. 



I 
should 
say 
the 
right 
line, 
and 
not 
the 
crooked, 
as 
well 
because 
the 
right 
is 
shorter, 
as 
because 
it 
is 
one, 
sole, 
and 
determinate, 
whereas 
the 
others 
are 
infinit, 
unequal, 
and 
longer; 
and 
my 
determination 
is 
grounded 
upon 
that, 
Thatitisone,andcertain. 


SALV. 


We 
have 
then 
the 
rightline 
todetermine 
the 
length 
between 
thetwoterms;let 
us 
add 
another 
right 
line 
and 
parallel 
to 
AB, 
which 
let 
be 
CD, 
[Fig. 
2. 
] 
so 
that 
there 
is 
put 
between 
them 
a 
superficies, 
of 
which 
I 
desire 
you 
to 
assign 
me 
the 
breadth, 
therefore 
departing 
from 
the 
point 
A, 
tell 
me 
how, 
and 
which 
way 
you 
will 
go, 
to 
end 
in 
the 
line 
CD, 
and 
so 
to 
point 
me 
out 
the 
breadth 
comprehended 
between 
those 
lines; 
let 
me 
know 
whether 
you 
will 
terminate 
it 
according 
to 
the 
quantity 
of 
the 
curved 
line 
AE, 
or 
the 
right 
line 
AF, 
or 
any 
other. 


SIMPL. 


According 
to 
the 
right 
AF, 
and 
not 
according 
to 
the 
crooked, 
that 
being 
alreadyexcludedfromsuch 
anuse. 


SAGR. 


But 
I 
would 
take 
neither 
of 
them, 
seeing 
the 
right 
line 
AF 
runs 
obliquely; 
But 
would 
draw 
a 
line, 
perpendicular 
to 
C 
D, 
for 
this 
should 
seem 
to 
me 
the 
shortest, 
and 
the 
properest 
of 
infinite 
that 
are 
greater, 
and 
unequal 
to 
one 
another, 
which 
may 
be 
produced 
from 
the 
term 
A 
to 
any 
other 
part 
of 
the 
opposite 
lineCD. 


SALV. 


Your 
choice, 
and 
the 
reason 
you 
bring 
for 
it 
in 
my 
judgment 
is 
most 
excellent; 
so 
that 
by 
this 
time 
we 
have 
proved 
that 
the 
first 
dimension 
is 
determined 
by 
a 
right 
line, 
the 
second 
namely 
the 
breadth 
with 
another 
line 
right 
also, 
and 
not 
onely 
right, 
but 
withall, 
at 
right-angles 
to 
the 
other 
that 
determineth 
the 
length, 
and 
thus 
we 
have 
the 
two 
dimensions 
of 
length 
and 
breadth, 
definite 
and 
certain. 
But 
were 
you 
to 
bound 
or 
terminate 
a 
height, 
as 
for 
example, 
how 
high 
this 
Roof 
is 
from 
the 
pavement, 
that 
we 
tread 
on, 



being 
that 
from 
any 
point 
in 
the 
Roof, 
we 
may 
draw 
infinite 
lines, 
both 
curved, 
and 
right, 
andall 
of 
diverselengths 
to 
infinitepointsofthe 
pavement, 
which 
ofalltheselineswouldyou 
makeuseof? 


SAGR. 


I 
would 
fasten 
a 
line 
to 
the 
Seeling, 
and 
with 
a 
plummet 
that 
should 
hang 
at 
it, 
would 
let 
it 
freely 
distend 
it 
self 
till 
it 
should 
reach 
well 
near 
to 
the 
pavement, 
and 
the 
length 
of 
such 
a 
thread 
being 
the 
streightest 
and 
shortest 
of 
all 
the 
lines, 
that 
could 
possibly 
be 
drawn 
from 
the 
same 
point 
to 
the 
pavement,Iwould 
say 
wasthetrue 
heightofthisRoom. 


SALV. 


Very 
well, 
And 
when 
from 
the 
point 
noted 
in 
the 
pavement 
by 
this 
pendent 
thread 
(taking 
the 
pavement 
to 
be 
levell 
and 
not 
declining) 
you 
should 
produce 
two 
other 
right 
lines, 
one 
for 
the 
length, 
and 
the 
other 
for 
the 
breadth 
of 
the 
superficies 
of 
the 
said 
pavement, 
what 
angles 
should 
they 
make 
with 
thesaidthread? 


SAGR. 


They 
would 
doubtless 
meet 
at 
right 
angles, 
the 
said 
lines 
falling 
perpendicular,andthepavementbeingveryplainandlevell. 


SALV. 


Therefore 
if 
you 
assign 
any 
point, 
for 
the 
term 
from 
whence 
to 
begin 
your 
measure; 
and 
from 
thence 
do 
draw 
a 
right 
line, 
as 
the 
terminator 
of 
the 
first 
measure,namelyofthelength,itwillfollowof 
necessity,thatthatwhichis 
to 
design 
out 
the 
largeness 
or 
breadth, 
toucheth 
the 
first 
at 
right-angles, 
and 
that 
that 
which 
is 
to 
denote 
the 
altitude, 
which 
is 
the 
third 
dimension, 
going 
from 
the 
same 
point 
formeth 
also 
with 
the 
other 
two, 
not 
oblique 
but 
right 
angles, 
and 
thus 
by 
the 
three 
perpendiculars, 
as 
by 
three 
lines, 
one, 
certain, 
and 
as 
short 
as 
is 
possible, 
you 
have 
the 
three 
dimensions 
AB 
length, 
AC 
breadth, 
and 
AD 
height; 
and 
because, 
clear 
it 
is, 
that 
there 
cannot 
concurre 
any 
more 
lines 
in 
the 
said 
point, 
so 
as 
to 
make 
therewith 
right-angles, 
and 
the 
dimensions 
ought 
to 
be 
determined 
by 
the 
sole 
right 
lines, 
which 
make 



between 
themselves 
right-angles; 
therefore 
the 
dimensions 
are 
no 
more 
but 
three, 
and 
that 
which 
hath 
three 
hath 
all, 
and 
that 
which 
hath 
all, 
is 
divisible 
onallsides, 
andthatwhich 
isso,isperfect, 
&c. 


SIMPL. 


And 
who 
saith 
that 
I 
cannot 
draw 
other 
lines? 
why 
may 
not 
I 
protract 
another 
line 
underneath,unto 
the 
point 
A,thatmaybe 
perpendicular 
totherest? 


SALV. 


You 
can 
doubtless, 
at 
one 
and 
the 
same 
point, 
make 
no 
more 
than 
three 
right 
linesconcurre,thatconstituteright 
anglesbetween 
themselves. 


SAGR. 


I 
see 
what 
Simplicius 
means, 
namely, 
that 
should 
the 
said 
DA 
be 
prolonged 
downward, 
then 
by 
that 
means 
there 
might 
be 
drawn 
two 
others, 
but 
they 
would 
be 
the 
same 
with 
the 
first 
three, 
differing 
onely 
in 
this, 
that 
whereas 
now 
they 
onely 
touch, 
then 
they 
would 
intersect, 
but 
not 
produce 
new 
dimensions. 


SIMPL. 


I 
will 
not 
say 
that 
this 
your 
argument 
may 
not 
be 
concludent; 
In 
physical 
proofs 
e 
metrical 
exactness 
is 
not 
necessary. 
but 
yet 
this 
I 
say 
with 
Aristotle, 
that 
in 
things 
natural 
it 
is 
not 
alwaies 
necessary, 
to 
bring 
Mathematical 
demonstrations. 


SAGR. 


Grant 
that 
it 
were 
so 
where 
such 
proofs 
cannot 
be 
had, 
yet 
if 
this 
case 
admit 
of 
them, 
why 
do 
not 
you 
use 
them? 
But 
it 
would 
be 
good 
we 
spent 
no 
more 
words 
on 
this 
particular, 
for 
I 
think 
that 
Salviatus 
will 
yield, 
both 
to 
Aristotle, 
and 
you, 
without 
farther 
demonstration, 
that 
the 
World 
is 
a 
body, 
and 
perfect, 
yea 
mostperfect,as 
beingthegreatestworkofGod. 


SALV. 



So 
really 
it 
is, 
therefore 
leaving 
the 
general 
contemplation 
of 
the 
whole, 
Parts 
of 
the 
world 
are 
two, 
according 
to 
Aristotle, 
Coelestial 
and 
Elementary 
contrary 
to 
one 
another. 
let 
us 
descend 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
its 
parts, 
which 
Aristotle, 
in 
his 
first 
division, 
makes 
two, 
and 
they 
very 
different 
and 
almost 
contrary 
to 
one 
another; 
namely 
the 
Coelestial, 
and 
Elementary: 
that 
ingenerable, 
incorruptible, 
unalterable, 
unpassible, 
&c. 
and 
this 
exposed 
to 
a 
continual 
alteration, 
mutation, 
&c. 
Which 
difference, 
as 
from 
its 
original 
principle, 
he 
derives 
from 
the 
diversity 
of 
local 
motions, 
and 
in 
this 
method 
heproceeds. 


Leaving 
the 
sensible, 
if 
I 
may 
so 
speak, 
and 
retiring 
into 
the 
Ideal 
world, 
he 
begins 
Architectonically 
to 
considerthat 
nature 
being 
the 
principle 
of 
motion, 
Local 
motion 
of 
three 
kinds, 
right, 
circular, 
& 
mixt. 
it 
followeth 
that 
natural 
bodies 
be 
indued 
with 
local 
motion. 
Next 
he 
declares 
local 
motion 
to 
be 
of 
three 
kinds, 
namely, 
circular, 
right, 
and 
mixt 
of 
right 
and 
circular: 
and 
the 
two 
first 
he 
calleth 
simple, 
Circular, 
and 
streight 
motions 
are 
simple, 
as 
proceeding 
by 
simple 
lines. 
for 
that 
of 
all 
lines 
the 
circular, 
and 
right 
are 
onely 
simple; 
and 
here 
somewhat 
restraining 
himself, 
he 
defineth 
anew, 
of 
simple 
motions, 
one 
to 
be 
circular, 
namely 
that 
which 
is 
made 
about 
the 
medium, 
and 
the 
other 
namely 
the 
right, 
upwards, 
and 
downwards; 
upwards, 
that 
which 
moveth 
from 
the 
medium; 
downwards, 
that 
which 
goeth 
towards 
the 
medium. 
And 
from 
hence 
he 
infers, 
as 
he 
may 
by 
and 
necessary 
consequence, 
Ad 
medium, 
à 
, 
& 
circa 
medium. 
that 
all 
simple 
motions 
are 
confined 
to 
these 
three 
kinds, 
namely, 
to 
the 
medium, 
from 
the 
medium, 
and 
about 
the 
medium; 
the 
which 
corresponds 
saith 
he, 
with 
what 
hath 
been 
said 
beforeofabody,thatitalsoisperfectedbythreethings,andso 
isitsmotion. 
Having 
confirmed 
these 
motions, 
he 
proceeds 
saying, 
that 
of 
natural 
bodies 
some 
being 
simple, 
and 
some 
composed 
of 
them 
(and 
he 
calleth 
simple 
bodies 
those, 
that 
have 
a 
principle 
of 
motion 
from 
nature, 
as 
the 
Fire 
and 
Earth) 
it 
follows 
that 
simple 
motions 
belong 
to 
simple 
bodies, 
and 
mixt 
to 
the 
compound; 
yet 
in 
such 
sort, 
that 
the 
compounded 
incline 
to 
the 
part 
predominantinthecomposition. 


SAGR. 


Pray 
you 
hold 
a 
little 
Salviatus, 
for 
I 
find 
so 
many 
doubts 
to 
spring 
up 
on 
all 
sides 
in 
this 
discourse, 
that 
I 
shall 
be 
constrained, 
either 
to 
communicate 



them 
if 
I 
would 
attentively 
hearken

I 
will 
very 
willingly

for 
that 
I 
also 
run 
the

and 
am 
ready 
at 
every 
step 
to 
lose 
my 
self 
whilst 
I 
sail 
between 
Rocks, 
and 
boisterous 
Waves, 
that 
make 
me, 
as 
they 
say, 
to 
lose 
my 
Compass; 
therefore 
before 
I 
make 
them 
more,propound

SAGR. 


You 
and 
Aristotle 
together 
would 
at 
first 
take 
me 
a 
little 
out 
of 
the 
sensible 
World, 
The 
definition 
of 
Nature, 
either 
imperfect, 
or 
unseasonable, 
produced 
by 
Aristotle. 
to 
tell 
me 
of 
the 
Architecture, 
wherewith 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
fabricated; 
and 
very 
appositly 
begin 
to 
tell 
me, 
that 
a 
natural 
body 
is 
by 
nature 
moveable, 
nature 
being 
(as 
elsewhere 
it 
is 
defined) 
the 
principle 
of 
motion. 
But 
here 
I 
am 
somewhat 
doubtfull 
why 
Aristotle 
said 
not 
that 
of 
natural 
bodies, 
some 
are 
moveable 
by 
nature, 
and 
others 
immoveable, 
for 
that 
in 
the 
definition, 
nature 
is 
said 
to 
be 
the 
principle 
of 
Motion, 
and 
Rest; 
for 
if 
natural 
bodies 
have 
all 
a 
principle 
of 
motion, 
either 
hemight 
haveomitted 
the 
mention 
of 
Rest, 
in 
the 
definition 
of 
nature: 
or 
not 
have 
introduced 
such 
a 
definition 
in 
this 
place. 
Next, 
as 
to 
the 
declaration 
of 
what 
Aristotle 
intends 
by 
simple 
motions, 
and 
how 
by 
Spaces 
he 
determines 
them, 
calling 
those 
simple, 
that 
are 
made 
by 
simple 
lines, 
which 
are 
onely 
the 
right, 
and 
circular, 
The 
Helix 
about 
the 
Cylinder 
may 
be 
said 
to 
be 
a 
simple 
line. 
I 
entertain 
it 
willingly; 
nor 
do 
I 
desire 
to 
tenter 
the 
instance 
of 
the 
Helix, 
about 
the 
Cylinder; 
which 
in 
that 
it 
is 
in 
every 
part 
like 
to 
it 
self, 
might 
seemingly 
be 
numbred 
among 
simple 
lines. 
But 
herein 
I 
cannot 
concurre, 
that 
he 
should 
so 
restrain 
simple 
motions 
(whilst 
he 
seems 
to 
go 
about 
to 
repeat 
the 
same 
definition 
in 
other 
words) 
as 
to 
call 
one 
of 
them 
the 
motion 
about 
the 
medium, 
the 
others 
Sursum 
& 
Deorsum, 
namely 
upwards 
and 
downward; 
which 
terms 
are 
not 
to 
be 
used, 
out 
of 
the 
World 
fabricated, 
but 
imply 
it 
not 
onely 
made, 
but 
already 
inhabited 
by 
us; 
for 
if 
the 
right 
motion 
be 
simple, 
by 
the 
simplicity 
of 
the 
right 
line, 
and 
if 
the 
simple 
motion 
be 
natural, 
it 
is 
made 
on 
every 
side, 
to 
wit, 
upwards, 
downwards, 
backwards, 
forwards, 
to 
the 
right, 
to 
the 
left, 
and 
if 
any 
other 
way 
can 
be 
imagined, 
provided 
it 
be 
straight, 
it 
shall 
agree 
to 
any 
simple 
natural 
body; 
or 
if 
not 
so, 
then 
the 
supposion 
of 



Aristotle 
is 
defective. 
Aristotle 
accommodates 
the 
rules 
of 
Architecture 
to 
the 
frame 
of 
the 
World, 
and 
not 
the 
frame 
to 
the 
rules. 
It 
appears 
moreover 
that 
Aristotle 
hinteth 
but 
one 
circular 
motion 
alone 
to 
be 
in 
the 
World, 
and 
consequently 
but 
one 
onely 
Center, 
to 
which 
alone 
the 
motions 
of 
upwards 
and 
downwards, 
refer. 
All 
which 
are 
apparent 
proofs, 
that 
Aristotles 
aim 
is, 
to 
make 
white 
black, 
and 
to 
accommodate 
Architecture 
to 
the 
building, 
and 
not 
to 
modle 
the 
building 
according 
to 
the 
precepts 
of 
Arthitecture: 
for 
if 
I 
should 
say 
that 
Nature 
in 
Universal 
may 
have 
a 
thousand 
Circular 
Motions, 
and 
by 
consequence 
a 
thousand 
Centers, 
there 
would 
be 
also 
a 
thousand 
motions 
upwards, 
and 
downwards. 
Again 
he 
makes 
as 
hath 
been 
said, 
a 
simple 
motion, 
and 
a 
mixt 
motion, 
calling 
simple, 
the 
circular 
and 
right; 
and 
mixt, 
the 
compound 
of 
them 
two: 
of 
natural 
bodies 
he 
calls 
some 
simple 
(namely 
those 
that 
have 
a 
natural 
principle 
to 
simple 
motion) 
and 
others 
compound: 
and 
simple 
motions 
he 
attributes 
to 
simple 
bodies, 
and 
the 
compounded 
to 
the 
compound; 
but 
by 
compound 
motion 
he 
doth 
no 
longer 
understand 
the 
mixt 
of 
right 
and 
circular, 
which 
may 
be 
in 
the 
World; 
but 
introduceth 
a 
mixt 
motion 
as 
impossible, 
as 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
mixe 
opposite 
motions 
made 
in 
the 
same 
right 
line, 
so 
as 
to 
produce 
from 
them 
a 
motion 
partly 
upwards, 
partly 
downwards; 
and, 
to 
moderate 
such 
an 
absurdity, 
Right 
motion 
sometimes 
simple, 
and 
sometimes 
mixt 
according 
to 
Arist. 
and 
impossibility, 
he 
asserts 
that 
such 
mixt 
bodies 
move 
according 
to 
the 
simple 
part 
predominant: 
which 
necessitates 
others 
to 
say, 
that 
even 
the 
motion 
made 
by 
the 
same 
right 
line 
is 
sometimes 
simple, 
and 
sometimes 
also 
compound: 
so 
that 
the 
simplicity 
of 
the 
motion, 
is 
no 
longer 
dependent 
onely 
onthesimplicityoftheline. 


SIMPL. 


How? 
Is 
it 
not 
difference 
sufficient, 
that 
the 
simple 
and 
absolute 
are 
more 
swift 
than 
that 
which 
proceeds 
from 
predominion? 
and 
how 
much 
faster 
doth 
a 
piece 
ofpureEarthdescend,thanapieceofWood? 


SAGR. 


Well, 
Simplicius; 
But 
put 
case 
the 
simplicity 
for 
this 
cause 
was 
changed, 
besides 
that 
there 
would 
be 
a 
hundred 
thousand 
mixt 
motions, 
you 
would 
not 
be 
able 
to 
determine 
the 
simple; 
nay 
farther, 
if 
the 
greater 
or 
lesse 
velocity 
be 
able 
to 
alter 
the 
simplicity 
of 
the 
motion, 
no 
simple 
body 
should 
move 
with 
a 



simple 
motion; 
since 
that 
in 
all 
natural 
right 
motions, 
the 
velocity 
is 
ever 
encreasing, 
and 
by 
consequence 
still 
changing 
the 
simplicity, 
which 
as 
it 
is 
simplicity, 
ought 
of 
consequence 
to 
be 
immutable, 
and 
that 
which 
more 
importeth, 
you 
charge 
Aristotle 
with 
another 
thing, 
that 
in 
the 
definition 
of 
motions 
compounded, 
he 
hath 
not 
made 
mention 
of 
tardity 
nor 
velocity, 
which 
younow 
insertfor 
a 
necessary 
and 
essential 
point. 
Again 
you 
can 
draw 
no 
advantage 
from 
this 
rule, 
for 
that 
there 
will 
be 
amongst 
the 
mixt 
bodies 
some, 
(and 
that 
not 
a 
few) 
that 
will 
move 
swiftly, 
and 
others 
more 
slowly 
than 
the 
simple; 
as 
for 
example, 
Lead, 
and 
Wood, 
incomparison 
of 
earth; 
and 
therefore 
amongst 
these 
motions, 
which 
call 
you 
the 
simple, 
and 
which 
the 
mixt? 


SIMPL. 


I 
would 
call 
that 
simple 
motion, 
which 
is 
made 
by 
a 
simple 
body, 
and 
mixt, 
that 
ofa 
compound 
body. 


SAGR. 


Very 
well, 
and 
yet 
Simplicius 
a 
little 
before 
you 
said, 
that 
the 
simple, 
and 
compound 
motions, 
discovered 
which 
were 
mixt, 
and 
which 
were 
simple 
bodies; 
now 
you 
will 
have 
me 
by 
simple 
and 
mixt 
bodies, 
come 
to 
know 
which 
is 
the 
simple, 
and 
which 
is 
the 
compound 
motion: 
an 
excellent 
way 
to 
keep 
us 
ignorant, 
both 
of 
motions 
and 
bodies. 
Moreover, 
you 
have 
also 
a 
little 
above 
declared, 
how 
that 
a 
greater 
velocity 
did 
not 
suffice, 
but 
you 
seek 
a 
third 
condition 
for 
the 
definement 
of 
simple 
motion, 
for 
which 
Aristotle 
contented 
himself 
with 
one 
alone, 
namely, 
of 
the 
simplicity 
of 
the 
Space, 
or 
Medium: 
But 
now 
according 
to 
you, 
the 
simple 
motion, 
shall 
be 
that 
which 
is 
made 
upon 
a 
simple 
line, 
with 
a 
certain 
determinate 
velocity, 
by 
a 
body 
simply 
moveable. 
Now 
be 
it 
as 
you 
please, 
and 
let 
us 
return 
to 
Aristotle, 
who 
defineth 
the 
mixt 
motion 
to 
be 
that 
compounded 
of 
the 
right, 
and 
circular, 
but 
producethnotany 
body,which 
naturallymovethwithsuch 
amotion. 


SALV. 


I 
come 
again 
to 
Aristotle, 
who 
having 
very 
well, 
and 
Methodically 
begun 
his 
discourse, 
but 
having 
a 
greater 
aim 
to 
rest 
at, 
and 
hit 
a 
marke, 
predesigned 
in 
his 
minde, 
then 
that 
to 
which 
his 
method 
lead 
him, 
digressing 
from 
the 



purpose, 
he 
comes 
to 
assert, 
as 
a 
thing 
known 
and 
manifest, 
that 
as 
to 
the 
motions 
directly 
upwards 
or 
downwards, 
they 
naturally 
agree 
to 
Fire, 
and 
Earth; 
and 
that 
therefore 
it 
is 
necessary, 
that 
besides 
these 
bodies, 
which 
are 
neer 
unto 
us, 
there 
must 
be 
in 
nature 
another, 
to 
which 
the 
circular 
motion 
may 
agree: 
which 
shall 
be 
so 
much 
the 
more 
excellent 
by 
how 
much 
the 
circular 
motion 
is 
more 
perfect, 
then 
the 
streight, 
but 
how 
much 
more 
pefect 
that 
is 
than 
this, 
he 
determines 
from 
the 
greatness 
of 
the 
circular 
lines 
perfection 
above 
the 
right 
line; 
The 
circular 
line 
perfect, 
according 
to 
Aristotle, 
and 
but 
the 
right 
imperfect, 
and 
why. 
calling 
that 
perfect, 
and 
this 
imperfect; 
imperfect, 
because 
if 
infinite 
it 
wanteth 
a 
termination, 
and 
end: 
and 
if 
it 
be 
finite, 
there 
is 
yet 
something 
beyond 
which 
it 
may 
be 
prolonged. 
This 
is 
the 
basis, 
ground 
work, 
and 
master-stone 
of 
all 
the 
Fabrick 
of 
the 
Aristotelian 
World, 
upon 
which 
they 
superstruct 
all 
their 
other 
properties, 
of 
neither 
heavy 
nor 
light, 
of 
ingenerable 
incorruptible, 
exemption 
from 
all 
motions, 
some 
onely 
the 
local, 
&c. 
And 
all 
these 
passions 
he 
affirmeth 
to 
be 
proper 
to 
a 
simple 
body 
that 
is 
moved 
circularly; 
and 
the 
contrary 
qualities 
of 
gravity, 
levity, 
corruptibility, 
&c. 
he 
assigns 
to 
bodies 
naturally 
moveable 
in 
a 
streight 
line, 
for 
that 
if 
we 
have 
already 
discovered 
defects 
in 
the 
foundation, 
we 
may 
rationally 
question 
what 
soever 
may 
farther 
built 
thereon. 
I 
deny 
not, 
that 
this 
which 
Aristotle 
hitherto 
hath 
introduced, 
with 
a 
general 
discourse 
dependent 
upon 
universal 
primary 
principles, 
hath 
been 
since 
in 
process 
of 
time, 
re-inforced 
with 
particular 
reasons, 
and 
experiments; 
all 
which 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
distinctly 
to 
consider 
and 
weigh; 
but 
because 
what 
hath 
been 
said 
hitherto 
presents 
to 
such 
as 
consider 
the 
same 
many 
and 
no 
small 
difficulties, 
(and 
yet 
it 
would 
be 
necessary, 
that 
the 
primary 
principles 
and 
fundamentals, 
were 
certain, 
firm, 
and 
established, 
that 
so 
they 
might 
with 
more 
confidence 
be 
built 
upon) 
it 
would 
not 
be 
amiss, 
before 
we 
farther 
multiply 
doubts, 
to 
see 
if 
haply 
(as 
I 
conjecture) 
betaking 
our 
selves 
to 
other 
waies, 
we 
may 
not 
light 
upon 
a 
more 
direct 
and 
secure 
method; 
and 
with 
better 
considered 
principles 
of 
Architecture 
lay 
our 
primary 
fundamentals. 
Therefore 
suspending 
for 
the 
present 
the 
method 
of 
Aristotle, 
(which 
we 
will 
re-assume 
again 
in 
its 
proper 
place, 
and 
particularly 
examine; 
The 
world 
is 
supposed 
by 
the 
Author 
to 
be 
perfectly 
ordinate.) 
I 
say, 
that 
in 
the 
things 
hitherto 
affirmed 
by 
him, 
I 
agree 
with 
him, 
and 
admit 
that 
the 
World 
is 
a 
body 
enjoying 
all 
dimensions, 
and 
therefore 
most 
perfect; 
and 
I 
add, 
that 
as 
such, 
it 
is 
necessarily 
most 
ordinate, 
that 
is, 
having 
parts 
between 



themselves, 
with 
exquisite 
and 
most 
perfect 
order 
disposed; 
which 
assumptionIthinkisnottobe 
denied,neitherby 
youor 
anyother. 


SIMPL. 


Who 
can 
deny 
it? 
the 
first 
particular 
(of 
the 
worlds 
dimensions) 
is 
taken 
from 
Aristotle 
himself, 
and 
its 
denomination 
of 
ordinate 
seems 
onely 
to 
be 
assumed 
fromthe 
order 
whichitmostexactlykeeps. 


SALV. 


This 
principle 
then 
established, 
Streight 
motion 
impossible 
in 
the 
world 
exactly 
ordinate. 
one 
may 
immediately 
conclude, 
that 
if 
the 
entire 
parts 
of 
the 
World 
should 
be 
by 
their 
nature 
moveable, 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
their 
motions 
should 
be 
right, 
orother 
than 
circular; 
and 
the 
reason 
is 
sufficiently 
easie, 
and 
manifest; 
for 
that 
whatsoever 
moveth 
with 
a 
right 
motion, 
changeth 
place; 
and 
continuing 
to 
move, 
doth 
by 
degrees 
more 
and 
more 
remove 
from 
the 
term 
from 
whence 
it 
departed, 
and 
from 
all 
the 
places 
thorow 
which 
it 
successively 
passed; 
and 
if 
such 
motion 
naturally 
suited 
with 
it, 
then 
it 
was 
not 
at 
the 
beginning 
in 
its 
proper 
place; 
and 
so 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
World 
were 
not 
disposed 
with 
perfect 
order. 
But 
we 
suppose 
them 
to 
be 
perfectly 
ordinate, 
therefore 
as 
such, 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
they 
should 
by 
nature 
change 
place, 
and 
consequently 
move 
in 
a 
right 
motion. 
Right 
motion 
nature 
infinite. 
Again, 
the 
right 
motion 
being 
by 
nature 
infinite, 
for 
that 
the 
right 
line 
is 
infinite 
and 
indeterminate, 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
any 
moveable 
can 
have 
a 
natural 
principle 
of 
moving 
in 
a 
right 
line; 
Motion 
by 
a 
right 
line 
naturally 
impossible. 
namely 
toward 
the 
place 
whither 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
arrive, 
there 
being 
no 
prae-finite 
term; 
Nature 
attempts 
not 
things 
impossible 
to 
be 
effected. 
and 
nature, 
as 
Aristotle 
himself 
saith 
well, 
never 
attempts 
to 
do 
that 
which 
can 
never 
be 
done, 
nor 
essaies 
to 
move 
whither 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
arrive. 
And 
if 
any 
one 
should 
yet 
object, 
that 
albeit 
the 
right 
line, 
and 
consequently 
the 
motion 
by 
it 
is 
producible 
in 
infinitum, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
is 
interminate;yet 
neverthelessNature,asonemaysay,arbitrarilyhath

them 
some 
terms, 
and 
given 
natural 
instincts 
to 
its 
natural 
bodies 
to 
move

the 
same; 
I 
will 
reply, 
that 
this 
might 
perhaps 
be 
fabled 
to 
have 
come 
to 
pass 
in 
the 
first 
Chaos▪ 
Right 
motion 
might 
perhaps 
be 
in 
th 
first 
Chaos. 
where 
indistinct 
matters 
confusedly 
and 
inordinately 
wandered; 
to 
regulate 
which, 
Right 
motion 
is 
commodious 
to 
range 
in 
order, 
things 
out 
of 
order. 



Nature 
very 
appositely 
made 
use 
of 
right 
motions, 
by 
which, 
like 
as 
the 
well-
constituted, 
moving, 
disorder 
themselves, 
so 
were 
they 
which 
were 
before 
depravedly 
disposed 
by 
this 
motion 
ranged 
in 
order: 
but 
after 
their 
exquisite 
distribution 
and 
collocation, 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
there 
should 
remain 
natural 
inclinations 
in 
them 
of 
longer 
moving 
in 
a 
right 
motion, 
from 
which 
now 
would 
ensue 
their 
removal 
from 
their 
proper 
and 
natural 
place, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
their 
disordination; 
we 
may 
therefore 
say 
that 
the 
right 
motion 
serves 
to 
conduct 
the 
matter 
to 
erect 
the 
work; 
but 
once 
erected, 
that 
it 
is 
to 
rest 
immoveable, 
or 
if 
moveable, 
Mundane 
bodies 
moved 
in 
the 
beginning 
in 
a 
right 
line, 
and 
afterwards 
circularly, 
according 
to 
Plato. 
to 
move 
it 
self 
onely 
circularly. 
Unless 
we 
will 
say 
with 
Plato, 
that 
these 
mundane 
bodies, 
after 
they 
had 
been 
made 
and 
finished, 
were 
for 
a 
certain 
time 
moved 
by 
their 
Maker, 
in 
a 
right 
motion, 
but 
that 
after 
their 
attainment 
to 
certain 
and 
determinate 
places, 
they 
were 
revolved 
one 
by 
one 
in 
Spheres, 
passing 
from 
the 
right 
to 
the 
circular 
motion, 
wherein 
they 
have 
been 
ever 
since 
kept 
and 
maintained. 
A 
sublime 
conceipt, 
and 
worthy 
indeed 
of 
Plato: 
upon 
which, 
I 
remember 
to 
have 
heard 
our 
common 
friend 
theThus 
doth 
he 
cover 
ly 
and 
modestly 
stile 
himselfe 
throughout 
this 
work. 
Lyncean 
Academick 
discourse 
in 
this 
manner, 
if 
I 
have 
not 
forgot 
it. 
Every 
body 
for 
any 
reason 
constituted 
in 
a 
state 
of 
rest, 
but 
which 
is 
by 
nature 
moveable, 
being 
set 
at 
liberty 
doth 
move; 
A 
moveable 
being 
in 
a 
state 
of 
rest, 
shall 
not 
move 
unless 
it 
have 
an 
inclination 
to 
some 
particular 
place. 
provided 
withal, 
that 
it 
have 
an 
inclination 
to 
some 
particular 
place; 
for 
should 
it 
stand 
indifferently 
affected 
to 
all, 
it 
would 
remain 
in 
its 
rest, 
not 
having 
greater 
inducement 
to 
move 
one 
way 
than 
another. 
From 
the 
having 
of 
this 
inclination 
necessarily 
proceeds, 
The 
moveable 
accelerates 
its 
motion, 
going 
towards 
the 
place 
whither 
it 
hath 
an 
inclination. 
that 
it 
in 
its 
moving 
shall 
continually 
increase 
its 
acceleration, 
and 
beginning 
with 
a 
most 
slow 
motion, 
it 
shall 
not 
acquire 
any 
degree 
of 
velocity, 
before 
it 
shall 
have 
passed 
thorow 
all 
the 
degrees 
of 
less 
velocity, 
or 
greatertardity: 
forpassing 
from 
the 
state 
ofquiet 
(which 
is 
the 
infinite 
degree 
of 
tardity 
of 
motion) 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
by 
which 
it 
should 
enter 
into 
such 
a 
determinate 
degree 
of 
velocity, 
The 
moveable 
passing 
from 
rest, 
goeth 
thorow 
all 
the 
degrees 
of 
tardity. 
before 
it 
shall 
have 
entred 
into 
a 
less, 
and 
into 
yet 
a 
less, 
before 
it 
entred 
into 
that: 
but 
rather 
it 
stands 
with 
reason, 
to 
pass 
first 
by 
those 
degrees 
nearest 
to 
that 
from 
which 
it 
departed, 
and 
from 
those 
to 
the 
more 
remote; 
Rest 
the 
infinite 
degree 
of 
tardity. 
but 
the 
degree 
from 
whence 
the 
moveable 
began 
to 
move, 
is 
that 
of 
extreme 
tardity, 
namely 



of 
rest. 
Now 
this 
acceleration 
of 
motion 
is 
never 
made, 
The 
moveable 
doth 
not 
accelerate, 
save 
only 
as 
it 
approacheth 
nearer 
to 
us 
term. 
but 
when 
the 
moveable 
in 
moving 
acquireth 
it; 
nor 
is 
its 
acquist 
other 
than 
an 
approaching 
to 
the 
place 
desired, 
to 
wit, 
whither 
its 
natural 
inclination 
attracts 
it, 
and 
thither 
it 
tendeth 
by 
the 
shortest 
way; 
namely, 
by 
a 
right 
line. 
We 
may 
upon 
good 
grounds 
therefore 
say, 
That 
Nature, 
to 
confer 
upon 
a 
moveable 
first 
constituted 
in 
rest 
a 
determinate 
velocity, 
useth 
to 
make 
it 
move 
according 
to 
a 
certain 
time 
and 
space 
with 
a 
right 
motion. 
Nature, 
to 
introduce 
in 
the 
moveable 
a 
certain 
degree 
of 
velocity, 
made 
it 
move 
in 
a 
right 
line. 
This 
presupposed, 
let 
us 
imagine 
God 
to 
have 
created 
the 
Orb 
v. 
g. 
of 
Jupiter, 
on 
which 
he 
had 
determined 
to 
confer 
such 
a 
certain 
velocity, 
which 
it 
ought 
afterwards 
to 
retain 
perpetually 
uniform; 
we 
may 
with 
Plato 
say, 
that 
he 
gave 
it 
at 
the 
beginning 
a 
right 
and 
accelerate 
motion, 
and 
that 
it 
afterwards 
being 
arrived 
to 
that 
intended 
degree 
of 
velocity, 
Vniform 
velocity 
convenient 
to 
the 
circular 
motion. 
he 
converted 
its 
right, 
into 
a 
circular 
motion, 
the 
velocity 
ofwhichcameafterwardsnaturally 
tobeuniform. 


SAGR. 


I 
hearken 
to 
this 
Discourse 
with 
great 
delight; 
and 
I 
believe 
the 
content 
I 
take 
therein 
will 
be 
greater, 
when 
you 
have 
satisfied 
me 
in 
a 
doubt: 
that 
is, 
(which 
I 
do 
not 
very 
well 
comprehend) 
how 
it 
of 
necessity 
ensues, 
that 
a 
moveable 
departing 
from 
its 
rest, 
Betwixt 
rest, 
and 
any 
assigned 
degree 
of 
velocity, 
infinite 
degrees 
of 
less 
velocity 
interpose. 
and 
entring 
into 
a 
motion 
to 
which 
it 
had 
a 
natural 
inclination, 
it 
passeth 
thorow 
all 
the 
precedent 
degrees 
of 
tardity, 
comprehended 
between 
any 
assigned 
degree 
of 
velocity, 
and 
the 
state 
of 
rest, 
which 
degrees 
are 
infinite? 
so 
that 
Nature 
was 
not 
able 
to 
confer 
them 
upon 
the 
body 
of 
Jupiter, 
his 
circular 
motion 
being 
instantly 
created 
with 
suchandsuchvelocity. 


SALV. 


I 
neither 
did, 
Nature 
doth 
not 
immediately 
confer 
a 
determinate 
degree 
of 
velocity, 
howbeit 
she 
could. 
nor 
dare 
say, 
that 
it 
was 
impossible 
for 
God 
or 
Nature 
to 
confer 
that 
velocity 
which 
you 
speak 
of, 
immediately; 
but 
this 
I 
say, 
that 
de 
facto 
she 
did 
not 
do 
it; 
so 
that 
the 
doing 
it 
would 
be 
a 
work 
extranatural,
andbyconsequencemiraculous 



SAGR. 


Then 
you 
believe, 
that 
a 
stone 
leaving 
its 
rest, 
and 
entring 
into 
its 
natural 
motion 
towards 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
passeth 
thorow 
all 
the 
degrees 
of 
tardityinferiour 
toanydegreeofvelocity? 


SALV. 


I 
do 
believe 
it, 
nay 
am 
certain 
of 
it; 
and 
so 
certain, 
that 
I 
am 
able 
to 
make 
you 
also 
verywellsatisfied 
withthetruththereof. 


SAGR. 


Though 
by 
all 
this 
daies 
discourse 
I 
should 
gain 
no 
more 
but 
such 
a 
knowledge,I 
shouldthinkmytimeverywellbestowed. 


SALV. 


By 
what 
I 
collect 
from 
our 
discourse, 
a 
great 
part 
of 
your 
scruple 
lieth 
in 
that 
it 
should 
in 
a 
time, 
and 
that 
very 
short, 
pass 
thorow 
those 
infinite 
degrees 
of 
tardity 
precedent 
to 
any 
velocity, 
acquired 
by 
the 
moveable 
in 
that 
time: 
and 
therefore 
before 
we 
go 
any 
farther, 
I 
will 
seek 
to 
remove 
this 
difficulty, 
which 
shall 
be 
an 
easie 
task; 
for 
I 
reply, 
that 
the 
moveable 
passeth 
by 
the 
aforesaid 
degrees, 
The 
moveable 
departing 
from 
rest 
passeth 
thorow 
all 
degrees 
of 
velocity 
without 
staying 
in 
any. 
but 
the 
passage 
is 
made 
without 
staying 
in 
any 
of 
them; 
so 
that 
the 
passage 
requiring 
but 
one 
sole 
instant 
of 
time, 
and 
every 
small 
time 
containing 
infinite 
instants, 
we 
shall 
not 
want 
enough 
of 
them 
to 
assign 
its 
own 
to 
each 
of 
the 
infinite 
degrees 
of 
tardity; 
although 
thetime 
were 
neversoshort. 


SAGR. 


Hither 
to 
I 
apprehend 
you; 
nevertheless 
it 
is 
very 
much 
that 
that 
Ball 
shot 
from 
a 
Cannon 
(for 
such 
Iconceive 
thecadent

which 
yetwe 
seeto 
fall 
with 
such 
a 
precipice, 
that 
in 
less 
than 
ten 
pulses 
it 
will 
pass 
two 
hundred 
yards 
of 
altitude; 
should 
in 
its 
motion 
be 
joyned 
with 
so 
small 
a 
degree 
of 
velocity, 
that, 
should

that 
rate 
without

You 
may 
say,

nor

no 
nor 
in

as 
I 
will 
endeavour

also 
happily 
without 
your

to 
some 
simple 
questions 
that 
I

And 
if 
I 
should 
say 
that 
the 
impetus 
acquired 
in 
any 
place 
of 
its 
motion, 
is 
so 
much, 
that 
it 
would 
suffice

from 
which 
it

SAGR. 


I 
should 
consent 
to 
it 
without 
contradiction, 
provided 
alwaies, 
that 
it 
might 
imploy 
without 
impediment 
its 
whole 
impetus 
in 
that 
sole 
work 
of 
re-
conducting 
it 
self, 
or 
another 
equal 
to 
it, 
to 
that 
self-same 
height 
as 
it 
would 
do, 
The 
ponderous 
mover 
descending 
acquireth 
impetus 
sufficient 
to 
recarry 
it 
to 
the 
like 
height. 
in 
case 
the 
Earth 
were 
bored 
thorow 
the 
centre, 
and 
the 
Bullet 
fell 
a 
thousand 
yards 
from 
the 
said 
centre, 
for 
I 
verily 
believe 
it 
would 
pass 
beyond 
the 
centre, 
ascending 
as 
much 
as 
it 
had 
descended; 
and 
this 
I 
see 
plainly 
in 
the 
experiment 
of 
a 
plummet 
hanging 
at 
a 
line, 
which 
removed 
from 
the 
perpendicular, 
which 
is 
its 
state 
of 
rest, 
and 
afterwards 
let 
go, 
falleth 
towards 
the 
said 
perpendicular, 
and 
goes 
as 
far 
beyond 
it; 
or 
onely 
so 
much 
less, 
as 
the 
opposition 
of 
the 
air, 
and 
line, 
or 
other 
accidents 
have 
hindred 
it. 
The 
like 
I 
see 
in 
the 
water, 
which 
descending 
thorow 
a 
pipe, 
re-mounts 
as

SALV. 


You 
argue 
very 
well. 
And 
for 
that 
I 
know 
you 
will 
not 
scruple 
to 
grant 
that 
the 
acquist 
of 
the 
impetus 
is 
by 
means 
of 
the 
receding 
from 
the 
term 
whence 
the 
moveable 
departed, 
and 
its 
approach 
to 
the 
centre, 
whither 
it 
motion 



tendeth; 
will 
you 
stick 
to 
yeeld, 
that

equal 
moveables,

SAGR. 


Idonotverywell 
understandthequestion. 


SALV. 


I 
will 
express 
it 
better 
by 
drawing 
a 
Figure: 
therefore 
I 
will 
suppose 
the 
line 
AB 
[in 
Fig. 
3. 
] 
parallel 
to 
the 
Horizon, 
and 
upon 
the 
point 
B, 
I 
will 
erect 
a 
perpendicular 
BC; 
and 
after 
that 
I 
adde 
this 
slaunt 
line 
CA. 
Understanding 
now 
the 
line 
CA 
to 
be 
an 
inclining 
plain 
exquisitely 
polished, 
and 
hard, 
upon 
which 
descendeth 
a 
ball 
perfectly 
round 
and 
of 
very 
hard 
matter, 
and 
such 
another 
I 
suppose 
freely 
to 
descend 
by 
the 
perpendicular 
CB: 
will 
you 
now 
confess 
that 
the 
impetus 
of 
that 
which 
descends 
by 
the 
plain 
CA, 
being 
arrived 
to 
the 
point 
A, 
may 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
impetus 
acquired 
by 
the 
other 
in 
thepointB,afterthe 
descentbytheperpendicularCB? 


SAGR. 


I 
resolutely 
believe 
so: 
The 
impetuosity 
of 
moveables 
equally 
approaching 
to 
the 
centre, 
are 
equal. 
for 
in 
effect 
they 
have 
both 
the 
same 
proximity 
to 
the 
centre, 
and 
by 
that, 
which 
I 
have 
already 
granted, 
their 
impetuosities 
would 
beequallysufficientto

the

But 
on 
the 
inclining 
plane 
CA 
it 
would 
descend, 
but 
with 
a 
gentler 
motion 
thanby 
the 
perpendicular 
CB? 


SAGR. 


I 
may 
confidently 
answer 
in 
the 
affirmative, 
it 
seeming 
to 
me 
necessary 
that 
the 
motion 
by 
the 
perpendicular 
CB 
should 
be 
more 
swift, 
than 
by 
the 
inclining 
plane 
CA; 
yet 
nevertheless, 
if 
this 
be, 
how 
can 
the 
Cadent 
by 
the 
inclination 
arrived 
to 
the 
point 
A, 
have 
as 
much 
impetus, 
that 
is, 
the 
same 
degree 
of

that 
the

by 
the

SALV. 


Then 
you 
would 
think 
it 
much 
more 
false, 
The 
velocity 
by 
the 
inclining 
plane 
equal 
to 
the 
velocity 
by 
the 
perpendicular, 
and 
the 
motion 
by 
the 
perpendicular 
swifter 
than 
by 
the 
inclination. 
should 
I 
say, 
that 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
Cadents 
by 
the 
perpendicular, 
and 
inclination, 
are 
absolutely 
equal: 
and 
yet 
this 
is 
a 
Proposition 
most 
true, 
as 
is 
also 
this 
that 
the 
Cadent 
moveth

but 
proportionate 
to 
those 
spaces. 
Take 
now 
the 
same 
Figure, 
and 
applying 
the 
conceipt 
that 
you 
had 
of 
the

tell

why 
you 
think 
the 
velocity 
of 
the

SIMPL. 
I 
think 
so; 
because 
in 
the

that 
the

shall

True; 
and 
thus 
it 
is 
proved, 
that 
the 
moveable 
moves 
more 
swiftly 
by 
the 
perpendicular, 
than 
by 
the 
inclination. 
Now 
consider, 
if 
in 
this 
same 
Figure 


one 
may 
any 
way 
evince 
the 
other

and 
finde

SALV. 
And 
what 
say 
you, 
Sagredus? 
I 
would 
not 
teach 
you 
what 
you 
knew 
before, 


and 
thatof 
whichbutjustnowyouproducedmethedefinition. 
SAGR. 
The 
definition 
I 
gave 
you, 
was, 
that 
moveables 
may 
be 
called 
equally 
swift, 


when 
the 
spaces 
passed 
are 
proportional 
to 
the 
times 
in 
which 
they 
passed; 
therefore 
to 
apply 
the 
definition 
to 
the 
present 
case, 
it 
will 
be 
requisite, 
that 
the 
time 
of 
descent 
by 
CA, 
to 
the 
time 
of 
falling 
by 
CB, 
should 
have 
the 
same 
proportion 
that 
the 
line 
CA 
hath 
to 
the 
line 
CB; 
but 
I 
understand 
not 
how 
that 
can 
be,forthat 
the

thanbyCA. 


SALV. 


And 
yet 
you 
must 
of 
necessity 
know 
it. 
Tell 
me 
a 
little, 
do 
not 
these 
motions 
gocontinually 
accelerating? 
SAGR. 
Theydo;butmoreintheperpendicularthan

SALV. 
But 
this 
acceleration 
in 
the 
perpendicular, 
is 
it 
yet 
notwithstanding 
such 
in 


comparison 
of 
that 
of 
the 
inclined, 
that 
two 
equal 
parts 
being 
taken 
in 
any 



place 
of 
the 
said 
perpendicular 
and 
inclining 
lines, 
the 
motion 
in 
the 
parts 
of 
theperpendicularis 
alwaiesmoreswift,thanin 
thepartoftheinclination? 


SAGR. 


I 
say 
not 
so: 
but 
I 
could 
take 
a 
space 
in 
the 
inclination, 
in 
which 
the 
velocity 
shall 
be 
far 
greater 
than 
in 
the 
like 
space 
taken 
in 
the 
perpendicular; 
and 
this 
shall 
be, 
if 
the 
space 
in 
the 
perpendicular 
should 
be 
taken 
near 
to 
the 
end 
C, 
and 
intheinclination,far 
fromit. 


SALV. 


You 
see 
then, 
that 
the 
Proposition 
which 
saith, 
that 
the 
motion 
by 
the 
perpendicular 
is 
moreswift 
than 
by 
the 
inclination, 
holds 
not 
true 
universally, 
but 
onely 
of 
the 
motions, 
which 
begin 
from 
the 
extremity, 
namely 
from 
the 
point 
of 
rest: 
without 
which 
restriction, 
the 
Proposition 
would 
be 
so 
deficient, 
that 
its 
very 
direct 
contrary 
might 
be 
true; 
namely, 
that 
the 
motion 
in 
the 
inclining 
plane 
is 
swifter 
than 
in 
the 
perpendicular: 
for 
it 
is 
certain, 
that 
in 
the 
said 
inclination, 
we 
may 
take 
a 
space 
past 
by 
the 
moveable 
in 
less 
time, 
than 
the 
like 
space 
past 
in 
the 
perpendicular. 
Now 
because 
the 
motion 
in 
the 
inclination 
is 
in 
some 
places 
more, 
in 
some 
less, 
than 
in 
the 
perpendicular; 
therefore 
in 
some 
places 
of 
the 
inclination, 
the 
time 
of 
motion 
of 
the 
moveable, 
shall 
have 
a 
greater 
proportion 
to 
the 
time 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
moveable, 
by 
some 
places 
of 
the 
perpendicular, 
than 
the 
space 
passed, 
to 
the 
space 
passed: 
and 
in 
other 
places, 
the 
proportion 
of 
the 
time 
to 
the 
time, 
shall 
be 
less 
than 
that 
of 
the 
space 
to 
the 
space. 
As 
for 
example: 
two 
moveables 
departing 
from 
their 
quiescence, 
namely, 
from 
the 
point 
C, 
one 
by 
the 
perpendicular 
CB, 
[in 
Fig. 
4. 
] 
and 
the 
other 
by 
the 
inclination 
CA, 
in 
the 
time 
that, 
in 
the 
perpendicular, 
the 
moveable 
shall 
have 
past 
all 
CB, 
the 
other 
shall 
have 
past 
CT 
lesser. 
And 
therefore 
the 
time 
by 
CT, 
to 
the 
time 
by 
CB 
(which 
is 
equal) 
shall 
have 
a 
greater 
proportion 
than 
the 
line 
CT 
to 
CB, 
being 
that 
the 
same 
to 
the 
less, 
hath 
a 
greater 
proportion 
than 
to 
the 
greater. 
And 
on 
the 
contrary, 
if 
in 
CA, 
prolonged 
as 
much 
as 
is 
requisite, 
one 
should 
take 
a 
part 
equal 
to 
CB, 
but 
past 
in 
a 
shorter 
time; 
the 
time 
in 
the 
inclination 
shall 
have 
a 
less 
proportion 
to 
the 
time 
in 
the 
perpendicular, 
than 
the 
space 
to 
the 
space. 
If 
therefore 
in 
the 
inclination 
and 
perpendicular, 
we 
may 
suppose 
such 
spaces 
and 
velocities, 
that 
the 
proportion 
between 
the 
said 
spaces 
be 
greater 
and 
less 
than 
the 
proportion 
of 
the 
times; 
we 
may 
easily 
grant, 
that 
there 
are 



also 
spaces, 
by 
which 
the 
times 
of 
the 
motions 
retain 
the 
same 
proportion 
as 
thespaces. 


SAGR. 


I 
am 
already 
freed 
from 
my 
greatest 
doubt, 
and 
conceive 
that 
to 
be 
not 
onely 
possible, 
but 
necessary, 
which 
I 
but 
now 
thought 
a 
contradiction: 
but 
nevertheless 
I 
understand 
not 
as 
yet, 
that 
this 
whereof 
we 
now 
are 
speaking, 
is 
one 
of 
these 
possible 
or 
necessary 
cases; 
so 
as 
that 
it 
should 
be 
true, 
that 
the 
time 
of 
descent 
by 
CA, 
to 
the 
time 
of 
the 
fall 
by 
CB, 
hath 
the 
same 
proportion 
that 
the 
line 
CA 
hath 
to 
CB; 
whence 
it 
may 
without 
contradiction 
be 
affirmed, 
that 
the 
velocity 
by 
the 
inclination 
CA, 
and 
by 
the 
perpendicular 
CB,areequal. 


SALV. 


Content 
your 
self 
for 
this 
time, 
that 
I 
have 
removed 
your 
incredulity; 
but 
for 
the 
knowledge 
of 
this, 
expect 
it 
at 
some 
other 
time, 
namely, 
when 
you 
shall 
see 
the 
matters 
concerning 
local 
motion 
demonstrated 
by 
our 
Academick; 
at 
which 
time 
you 
shall 
find 
it 
proved, 
that 
in 
the 
time 
that 
the 
one 
moveable 
falls 
all 
the 
space 
CB, 
the 
other 
descendeth 
by 
CA 
as 
far 
as 
the 
point 
T, 
in 
which 
falls 
the 
perpendicular 
drawn 
from 
the 
point 
B: 
and 
to 
find 
where 
the 
same 
Cadent 
by 
the 
perpendicular 
would 
be 
when 
the 
other 
arriveth 
at 
the 
point 
A, 
draw 
from 
A 
the 
perpendicular 
unto 
CA, 
continuing 
it, 
and 
CB 
unto 
the 
interfection, 
and 
that 
shall 
be 
the 
point 
sought. 
Whereby 
you 
see 
how 
it 
is 
true, 
that 
the 
motion 
by 
CB 
is 
swifter 
than 
by 
the 
inclination 
CA 
(supposing 
the 
term 
C 
for 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
motions 
compared) 
because 
the 
line 
CB 
is 
greater 
than 
CT, 
and 
the 
other 
from 
C 
unto 
the 
intersection 
of 
the 
perpendicular 
drawn 
from 
A, 
unto 
the 
line 
CA, 
is 
greater 
than 
CA, 
and 
therefore 
the 
motion 
by 
it 
is 
swifter 
than 
by 
CA. 
But 
when 
we 
compare 
the 
motion 
made 
by 
all 
CA, 
not 
with 
all 
the 
motion 
made 
in 
the 
same 
time 
by 
the 
perpendicular 
continued, 
but 
with 
that 
made 
in 
part 
of 
the 
time, 
by 
the 
sole 
part 
CB, 
it 
hinders 
not, 
that 
the 
motion 
by 
CA, 
continuing 
to 
descend 
beyond, 
may 
arrive 
to 
A 
in 
such 
a 
time 
as 
is 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
other 
time, 
as 
the 
line 
CA 
is 
to 
the 
line 
CB. 
Now 
returning 
to 
our 
first 
purpose; 
which 
was 
to 
shew, 
that 
the 
grave 
moveable 
leaving 
its 
quiescence, 
passeth 
descending 
by 
all 
the 
degrees 
of 
tardity, 
precedent 
to 
any 
whatsoever 
degree 
of 
velocity 
that 
it 
acquireth, 
re-assuming 
the 
same 
Figure 
which 
we 
used 
before, 
let 
us 



remember 
that 
we 
did 
agree, 
that 
the 
Descendent 
by 
the 
inclination 
CA, 
and 
the 
Cadent 
by 
the 
perpendicular 
CB, 
were 
found 
to 
have 
acquired 
equal 
degrees 
of 
velocity 
in 
the 
terms 
B 
and 
A: 
now 
to 
proceed, 
I 
suppose 
you 
will 
not 
scruple 
to 
grant, 
that 
upon 
another 
plane 
less 
steep 
than 
AC; 
as 
for 
example, 
AD 
[in 
Fig. 
5. 
] 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
descendent 
would 
be 
yet 
more 
flow 
than 
in 
the 
plane 
AC. 
So 
that 
it 
is 
not 
any 
whit 
dubitable, 
but 
that 
there 
may 
be 
planes 
so 
little 
elevated 
above 
the 
Horizon 
AB, 
that 
the 
moveable, 
namely 
the 
same 
ball, 
in 
any 
the 
longest 
time 
may 
reach 
the 
point 
A, 
which 
being 
to 
move 
by 
the 
plane 
AB, 
an 
infinite 
time 
would 
not 
suffice: 
and 
the 
motion 
is 
made 
always 
more 
slowly, 
by 
how 
much 
the 
declination 
is 
less. 
It 
must 
be 
therefore 
confest, 
that 
there 
may 
be 
a 
point 
taken 
upon 
the 
term 
B, 
so 
near 
to 
the 
said 
B, 
that 
drawing 
from 
thence 
to 
the 
point 
A 
a 
plane, 
the 
ball 
would 
not 
pass 
it 
in 
a 
whole 
year. 
It 
is 
requisite 
next 
for 
you 
to 
know, 
that 
the 
impetus, 
namely 
the 
degree 
of 
velocity 
the 
ball 
is 
found 
to 
have 
acquired 
when 
it 
arriveth 
at 
the 
point 
A, 
is 
such, 
that 
should 
it 
continue 
to 
move 
with 
this 
self-same 
degree 
uniformly, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
without 
accelerating 
or 
retarding; 
in 
as 
much 
more 
time 
as 
it 
was 
in 
coming 
by 
the 
inclining 
plane, 
it 
would 
pass 
double 
the 
space 
of 
the 
plane 
inclined: 
namely 
(for 
example) 
if 
the 
ball 
had 
past 
the 
plane 
DA 
in 
an 
hour, 
continuing 
to 
move 
uniformly 
with 
that 
degree 
of 
velocity 
which 
it 
is 
found 
to 
have 
in 
its 
arriving 
at 
the 
term 
A, 
it 
shall 
pass 
in 
an 
hour 
a 
space 
double 
the 
length 
DA; 
and 
because 
(as 
we 
have 
said) 
the 
degrees 
of 
velocity 
acquired 
in 
the 
points 
B 
and 
A, 
by 
the 
moveables 
that 
depart 
from 
any 
point 
taken 
in 
the 
perpendicular 
CB, 
and 
that 
descend, 
the 
one 
by 
the 
inclined 
plane, 
the 
other 
by 
the 
said 
perpendicular, 
arealwaysequal: 
therefore 
the 
cadentbytheperpendicularmay 
departfroma 
term 
so 
near 
to 
B, 
that 
the 
degree 
of 
velocity 
acquired 
in 
B, 
would 
not 
suffice 
(still 
maintaining 
the 
same) 
to 
conduct 
the 
moveable 
by 
a 
space 
double 
the 
length 
of 
the 
planeinclinedin 
a 
year, 
norin 
ten,no 
norin 
ahundred. 
We 
may 
therefore 
conclude, 
that 
if 
it 
be 
true, 
that 
according 
to 
the 
ordinary 
course 
of 
nature 
a 
moveable, 
all 
external 
and 
accidental 
impediments 
removed, 
moves 
upon 
an 
inclining 
plane 
with 
greater 
and 
greater 
tardity, 
according 
as 
the 
inclination 
shall 
be 
less; 
so 
that 
in 
the 
end 
the 
tardity 
comes 
to 
be 
infinite, 
which 
is, 
when 
the 
inclination 
concludeth 
in, 
and 
joyneth 
to 
the 
horizontal 
plane; 
and 
if 
it 
be 
true 
likewise, 
that 
the 
degree 
of 
velocity 
acquired 
in 
some 
point 
of 
the 
inclined 
plane, 
is 
equal 
to 
that 
degree 
of 
velocity 
which 
is 
found 
to 
beinthe 
moveable 
that 
descends 
bythe 
perpendicular, 
inthe 
pointcutby 
a 
parallel 
to 
the 
Horizon, 
which 
passeth 
by 
that 
point 
of 
the 
inclining 
plane; 
it 



must 
of 
necessity 
be 
granted, 
that 
the 
cadent 
departing 
from 
rest, 
passeth 
thorow 
all 
the 
infinite 
degrees 
of 
tardity, 
and 
that 
consequently, 
to 
acquire 
a 
determinate 
degree 
of 
velocity, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
it 
move 
first 
by 
right 
lines, 
descending 
by 
a 
short 
or 
long 
space, 
according 
as 
the 
velocity 
to 
be 
acquired, 
ought 
to 
be 
either 
less 
or 
greater, 
and 
according 
as 
the 
plane 
on 
which 
it 
descendeth 
is 
more 
or 
less 
inclined; 
so 
that 
a 
plane 
may 
be 
given 
with 
so 
small 
inclination, 
that 
to 
acquire 
in 
it 
the 
assigned 
degree 
of 
velocity, 
it 
must 
first 
move 
in 
a 
very 
great 
space, 
and 
take 
a 
very 
long 
time; 
whereupon 
in 
the 
horizontal 
plane, 
any 
how 
little 
soever 
velocity, 
would 
never 
be 
naturally 
acquired, 
since 
that 
the 
moveableinthis 
casewillnever 
move: 
but 
themotion 
by 
the 
horizontal 
line, 
The 
circular 
motion 
is 
never 
acquired 
naturally, 
without 
right 
motion 
precede 
it. 
Circular 
motion 
perpetually 
uniform. 
which 
is 
neither 
declined 
or 
inclined, 
is 
a 
circular 
motion 
about 
the 
centre: 
therefore 
the 
circular 
motion 
is 
never 
acquired 
naturally, 
without 
the 
right 
motion 
precede 
it; 
but 
being 
once 
acquired, 
it 
will 
continue 
perpetually 
with 
uniform 
velocity. 
I 
couldwith 
other 
discourses 
evince 
anddemonstrate 
thesame 
truth, 
but 
I 
will 
not 
by 
so 
great 
a 
digression 
interrupt 
our 
principal 
argument: 
but 
rather 
will 
return 
to 
it 
upon 
some 
other 
occasion; 
especially 
since 
we 
not 
assumed 
the 
same, 
not 
to 
serve 
for 
a 
necessary 
demonstration, 
but 
to 
adorn 
a 
Platonick 
Conceit; 
to 
which 
I 
will 
add 
another 
particular 
observation 
of 
our 
Academick, 
which 
hath 
in 
itsomething 
of 
admirable. 
Letussuppose 
amongst 
the 
decrees 
of 
the 
divine 
Architect, 
a 
purpose 
of 
creating 
in 
the 
World 
these 
Globes, 
which 
we 
behold 
continually 
moving 
round, 
and 
of 
assigning 
the 
centre 
of 
their 
conversions; 
and 
that 
in 
it 
he 
had 
placed 
the 
Sun 
immoveable, 
and 
had 
afterwards 
made 
all 
the 
said 
Globes 
in 
the 
same 
place, 
and 
with 
the 
intended 
inclinations 
of 
moving 
towards 
the 
Centre, 
till 
they 
had 
acquired 
those 
degrees 
of 
velocity, 
which 
at 
first 
seemed 
good 
to 
the 
same 
Divine 
Minde; 
the 
which 
being 
acquired, 
we 
lastly 
suppose 
that 
they 
were 
turned 
round, 
each 
in 
his 
Sphere 
retaining 
the 
said 
acquired 
velocity: 
it 
is 
now 
demanded, 
in 
what 
altitude 
and 
distance 
from 
the 
Sun 
the 
place 
was 
where 
the 
said 
Orbs 
were 
primarily 
created; 
and 
whether 
it 
be 
possible 
that 
they 
might 
all 
be 
created 
in 
the 
same 
place? 
To 
make 
this 
investigation, 
we 
must 
take 
from 
the 
most 
skilfull 
Astronomers 
the 
magnitude 
of 
the 
Spheres 
in 
which 
the 
Planets 
revolve, 
and 
likewise 
the 
time 
of 
their 
revolutions: 
from 
which 
two 
cognitions 
is 
gathered 
how 
much 
(for 
example) 
Jupiter 
is 
swifter 
than 
Saturne; 
and 
being 
found 
(as 
indeed 
it 
is) 
that 
Jupiter 
moves 
more 
swiftly, 
it 
is 
requisite, 
that 
departing 
from 
the 
same 
altitude, 
Jupiter 
be 



descendedmore 
thanSaturne, 
as 
wereally 
know 
it 
is,its 
Orbe 
being 
inferiour 
to 
that 
of 
Saturne. 
But 
by 
proceeding 
forwards, 
from 
the 
proportions 
of 
the 
two 
velocities 
of 
Jupiter 
and 
Saturne, 
and 
from 
the 
distance 
between 
their 
Orbs, 
and 
from 
the 
proportion 
of 
acceleration 
of 
natural 
motion, 
one 
may 
finde 
in 
what 
altitude 
and 
distance 
from 
the 
centre 
of 
their 
revolutions, 
The 
magnitude 
of 
the 
Orbs, 
and 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Planets, 
answer 
proportionably, 
as 
if 
descended 
from 
the 
same 
place. 
was 
the 
place 
from 
whence 
they 
first 
departed. 
This 
found 
out, 
and 
agreed 
upon, 
it 
is 
to 
be 
sought, 
whether 
Mars 
descending 
from 
thence 
to 
his 
Orb, 
the 
magnitude 
of 
the 
Orb, 
and 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
motion, 
agree 
with 
that 
which 
is 
found 
by 
calculation; 
and 
let 
the 
like 
be 
done 
of 
the 
Earth, 
of 
Venus, 
and 
of 
Mercury; 
the 
greatness 
of 
which 
Spheres, 
and 
the 
velocity 
of 
their 
motions, 
agree 
so 
nearlytowhatcomputationgives,thatitisveryadmirable. 


SAGR. 


I 
have 
hearkened 
to 
this 
conceit 
with 
extreme 
delight; 
and, 
but 
that 
I 
believe 
the 
making 
of 
these 
calculations 
truly 
would 
be 
a 
long 
and 
painfull 
task,

SALV. 


The 
operation 
indeed 
is 
long 
and 
difficult; 
nor 
could 
I 
be 
certain 
to 
finde 
it 
so 
readily; 
therefore 
we 
shall 
refer 
it 
to 
another 
time, 
and 
for 
the 
present 
we 
will 
return 
to 
our 
first 
proposal, 
going 
on 
there 
where 
we 
made 
digression; 
which, 
if 
I 
well 
remember, 
was 
about 
the 
proving 
the 
motion 
by 
a 
right 
line 
of 
no 
use, 
in 
the 
ordinate 
parts 
of 
the 
World; 
and 
we 
did 
proceed 
to 
say, 
that 
it 
was 
not 
so 
in 
circular 
motions, 
of 
which 
that 
which 
is 
made 
by 
the 
moveable 
in 
it 
self, 
Finite 
and

the 
parts 
of 
the 
World. 
still 
retains 
it 
in 
the 
same 
place, 
and 
that 
which 
carrieth 
the 
moveable 
by 
the 
circumference 
of 
a 
circle 
about 
its 
fixed 
centre, 
neither 
puts 
it 
self, 
nor 
those 
about 
it 
in 
disorder; 
for 
that 
such 
a 
motion 
primarily 
is 
finite 
and 
terminate 
(though 
not 
yet 
finished 
and 
determined) 
but 
there 
is 
no 
point 
in 
the 
circumference, 
In 
the 
circular 
motion, 
every 
point 
in 
the 
circumference 
is 
the 
begining 
and 
end. 
that 
is 
not 
the 
first 
and 
last 
term 
in 
the 
circulation; 
and 
continuing 
it 
in 
the 
circumference 
assigned 
it, 
it 
leaveth 
all 
the 
rest, 
within 
and 
without 
that, 
free 
for 
the 
use 
of 
others, 
without 
ever 
impeding 
or 



disordering 
them. 
This 
being 
a 
motion 
that 
makes 
the 
moveable 
continually 
leave, 
and 
continually 
arrive 
at 
the 
end; 
Circular 
motion 
onely 
is 
uniform. 
it 
alone 
therefore 
can 
primarily 
be 
uniform; 
for 
that 
acceleration 
of 
motion 
is 
made 
in 
the 
moveable, 
when 
it 
goeth 
towards 
the 
term, 
to 
which 
it 
hath 
inclination; 
and 
the 
retardation 
happens 
by 
the 
repugnance 
that 
it 
hath 
to 
leave 
and 
part 
from 
the 
same 
term; 
and 
because 
in 
circular 
motion, 
the 
moveable 
continually 
leaves 
the 
natural 
term, 
and 
continually 
moveth 
towards 
the 
same, 
therefor, 
in 
it, 
the 
repugnance 
and 
inclination 
are 
always 
of 
equal 
force: 
from 
which 
equality 
results 
a 
velocity, 
neither 
retarded 
nor 
accelerated, 
i. 
e. 
an 
uniformity 
in 
motion. 
From 
this 
conformity, 
and 
from 
the 
being 
terminate, 
Circular 
motion 
may 
be 
continued 
perpetually. 
may 
follow 
the 
perpetual 
continuation 
by 
successively 
reiterating 
the 
circulations; 
which 
in 
an 
undeterminated 
line, 
and 
in 
a 
motion 
continually 
retarded 
or 
accelerated,cannot 
naturallybe. 
Rightmotioncannotnaturallybeperpetual. 
I 
say, 
naturally; 
because 
the 
right 
motion 
which 
is 
retarded, 
is 
the 
violent, 
which 
cannot 
be 
perpetual; 
and 
the 
accelerate 
arriveth 
necessarily 
at 
the 
term, 
if 
one 
there 
be; 
and 
if 
there 
be 
none, 
it 
cannot 
be 
moved 
to 
it, 
because 
nature 
moves 
not 
whether 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
attain. 
I 
conclude 
therefore, 
that 
the 
circular 
motion 
can 
onely 
naturally 
consist 
with 
natural 
bodies, 
parts 
of 
the 
universe, 
and 
constituted 
in 
an 
excellent 
disposure; 
and 
that 
the 
right, 
at 
the 
most 
that 
can 
be 
said 
for 
it, 
is 
assigned 
by 
nature 
to 
its 
bodies, 
Right 
motion 
assigned 
to 
natural 
bodies, 
to 
reduce 
them 
to 
perfect 
order, 
when 
removed 
from 
their 
places. 
and 
their 
parts, 
at 
such 
time 
as 
they 
shall 
be 
out 
of 
their 
proper 
places, 
constituted 
in 
a 
depraved 
disposition, 
and 
for 
that 
cause 
needing 
to 
be 
redu 
d 
by 
the 
shortest 
way 
to 
their 
natural 
state. 
Hence, 
me 
thinks, 
it 
may 
rationally 
be 
concluded, 
that 
for 
maintenance 
of 
perfect 
order 
amongst 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
World, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
say, 
that 
moveables 
are 
moveable 
onely 
circularly; 
and 
if 
there 
be 
any 
that 
move 
not 
circularly, 
Rest 
onely, 
and 
circular 
motion 
are 
apt 
to 
conserve 
order. 
these 
of 
necessity 
are 
immoveable: 
there 
being 
nothing 
but 
rest 
and 
circular 
motion 
apt 
to 
the 
conservation 
of 
order. 
And 
I 
do 
not 
a 
little 
wonder 
with 
my 
self, 
that 
Aristotle, 
who 
held 
that 
the 
Terrestrial 
globe 
was 
placed 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
World, 
and 
there 
remained 
immoveable, 
should 
not 
say, 
that 
of 
natural 
bodies 
some 
are 
moveable 
by 
nature, 
and 
others 
immoveable; 
especially 
havingbeforedefined

Aristotle, 
though 
of 
a 
very 
perspicacious 
wit, 
would 
not 
strain 
it 
further 
than 
needed: 
Sensible

holding 
in 
all 
his 
argumentations, 
that 
sensible 
experiments 
were 
to 
be 
preferred 
before 
any 
reasons 
founded 
upon 
strength 
of 
wit, 
and 
said 
those 
which 
should 
deny 
the 
testimony 
of

deserved 
to 
be 
punished 
with 
the 
loss 
of 
that 
sense; 
He 
who 
denies 
sense, 
deserves 
to 
be 
deprived 
of 
it. 
Sense 
sheweth 
that 
things 
grave 
move 
to 
the 
medium, 
and 
the 
light 
to 
the 
concave. 
now 
who 
is 
so 
blind, 
that 
sees 
not 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Earth 
and 
Water 
to 
move, 
as 
being 
grave, 
naturally 
downwards, 
namely; 
towards 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Universe, 
assigned 
by 
nature 
her 
self 
for 
the 
end 
and 
term 
of

motion 
deorsùm; 
and 
doth 
not 
likewise 
see 
the 
Fire 
and 
Air 
to 
move 
right 
upwards 
towards 
the 
Concave 
of 
the 
Lunar 
Orb, 
as 
to 
the 
natural 
end 
of

And 
this 
being 
so 
manifestly

and 
we 
being 
certain, 
that

why 
may 
we 
not 
assert 
it 
for

The 
most 
that 
you 
can 
pretend 
from 
this 
your 
Discourse, 
were 
it 
granted 
to 
be 
true, 
is 
that, 
like 
as 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Earth 
removed 
from 
the 
whole, 
namely, 
fromtheplacewherethey 
naturallyrest,thatisinshort

and

return 
to 
their 
place 
spontaneously, 
and 
therefore 
naturally 
in 
a 
right 
motion, 
(it 
being 
granted, 
that 
eadem 
sit 
ratio 
totius 
& 
partium) 
so 
it 
may 
be 
inferred, 
that 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
removed 
violently 
from 
the 
place 
assigned 
it 
by 
nature, 
It 
is 
questionable 
whether 
descending 
weights 
move 
in 
a 
right 
line. 
it 
would 
return 
by 
a 
right 
line. 
This, 
as 
I 
have 
said, 
is 
the 
most 
that 
can 
be 
granted 
you, 
and 
that 
onely 
for 
want 
of 
examination; 
but 
he 
that 
shall 
with 
exactness 
revise 
these 
things, 
will 
first 
deny, 
that 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Earth, 
in 
returning 
to 
its 
whole, 
move 
in 
a 
right 
line, 
and 
not 
by 
a 
circular 
or 
mixt; 
and 
really 
you 
would 
have 
enough 
to 
do 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
contrary, 
as 
you 
shall 
plainly 
see 
in 
the 
answers 
to 
the 
particular 
reasons 
and 
experiments 
alledged 
by 
Ptolomey 
and 
Aristotle. 
Secondly, 
If 
another 
should 
say 
that 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Earth, 
go 
not 
in 
their 
motion 
towards 
the 
Centre 
of 
the 
World, 
but 
to 
unite 
with 
its 
Whole, 
and 
that 
for 
that 
reason 
they 
naturally 
incline 
towards 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe, 
by 
which 
inclination 
they 
conspire 
to 
form 
and 
preserve 
it,

to 
which 
the 
whole 
Terrene 
Globe, 
being 
thence 
removed, 
would 
seek 
to 
return, 
that 
so 
the 
reason 
of 
the 
Whole 
might 
be 
like 
to 
that 
of 
its 
parts? 
It 
may 
be 
added, 
That 
neither 
Aristotle, 
nor 
you 
can 
ever 
prove, 
that 
the 
Earth 
de 
facto 
is 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Universe; 
but 
if 
any 
Centre 
may 
be 
assigned 
to 
the 
Universe, 
The 
Sun 
more 
probably 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Vniverse, 
than 
the 
Earth. 
we 
shall 
rather 
find 
the 
Sun 
placedin 
it, 
asbythesequel 
youshallunderstand. 


Now, 
like 
as 
from 
the 
consentaneous 
conspiration 
of 
all 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Earth 
to 
form 
its 
whole, 
doth 
follow, 
that 
they 
with 
equal 
inclination 
concurr 
thither 
from 
all 
parts; 
Natural 
inclination 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
all 
the 
globes 
of 
the 
World 
to 
go 
to 
their 
centre. 
and 
to 
unite 
themselves 
as 
much 
as 
is 
possible 
together, 
they 
there 
spherically 
adapt 
themselves; 
why 
may 
we 
not 
believe 
that 
the 
Sun, 
Moon, 
and 
other 
mundane 
Bodies, 
be 
also 
of 
a 
round 
figure, 
not 
by 
other 
than 
a 
concordant 
instinct, 
and 
natural 
concourse 
of 
all 
the 
parts 
composing 
them? 
Of 
which, 
if 
any, 
at 
any 
time, 
by 
any 
violence 
were 
separated 
from 
the 
whole, 
is 
it 
not 
reasonable 
to 
think, 
that 
they 
would 
spontaneously 
and 
by 
natural 
instinct 
return? 
and 
in 
this 
manner 
to 
infer, 
that 
therightmotionagreethwith 
all 
mundanebodies 
alike. 


SIMPL. 


Certainly, 
if 
you 
in 
this 
manner 
deny 
not 
onely 
the 
Principles 
of 
Sciences, 
but 
manifest 
Experience, 
and 
the 
Senses 
themselves, 
you 
can 
never 
be 
convinced 
or 
removed 
from 
any 
opinion 
which 
you 
once 
conceit, 
therefore 
I 
will 
choose 
rather 
to 
be 
silent 
(for,

than

And 
insisting 
on 
the

alledged

you 
even 
now 
(since 
you 
question 
so 
much 
as 
whether

a

or 
no) 
how 
can 
you 
ever 
rationally 
deny, 
The

that 
the

of 
the

or, 
if 
you 
will, 
that 
ponderous

descend 
towards 
the 
Centre, 
with 
a 
right 
motion; 
whenas, 
if 
from 
a 
very 
high 
Tower, 
whose 
walls 
are 
very 
upright 
and 
perpendicular, 
you 
let

being 
hanged 
bya

fastned

just 
there, 
whence 
the 
said 
weights 
were 
let 
fall? 
is 
not 
this 
a 
more 
than 
evident 
argument 
of 
the 
motions 
being 
right, 
and 
towards 
the

doubt, 
whether 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Earth 
are 
moved, 
as 
Aristotle 
affirms, 
towards 
the 
Centre 
of 
the 
World; 
as 
if 
he 
had 
not 
rationally 
demonstrated 
it 
by 
contrary 
motions, 
whilst 
he 
thus 
argueth; 
The 
motion 
of 
heavie 
bodies 
is 
contrary 
to 
that 
of 
the 
light: 
but 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
light 
is 
manifest 
to 
be 
directly 
upwards, 
namely, 
towards 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
World, 
therefore 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
heavie 
is 
directly 
towards 
the 
Centre 
of 
the 
World: 
and 
it 
happens 
per 
accidens, 
Heavie 
bodies 
move 
towards 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth 
per 
accidens. 
that 
it 
be 
towards 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
for 
that 
this 
striveth 
to 
be 
united 
to 
that. 
The 
seeking 
in 
the 
next 
place, 
what 
a 
part 
of 
the 
Globe 
of 
the 
Sun 
or 
Moon 
would 
do, 
were 
it 
separated 
from 
its 
whole, 
is 
vanity; 
because 
that 
thereby 
that 
is 
sought, 
To 
seek 
what 
would 
follow 
upon 
an 
impossibility, 
is 
folly. 
which 
would 
be 
the 
consequence 
of 
an 
impossibility; 
in 
regard 
that, 
as 
Aristotle 
also 
demonstrates, 
the 
coelestial 
bodies 
are 
impassible, 
impenetrable, 
and 
infrangible; 
so 
that 
such 
a 
case 
can 
never 
happen: 
Coelestial 
bodies 
neither 
heavie 
nor 
light, 
according 
to 
Aristotle. 
and 
though 
it 
should, 
and 
that 
the 
separated 
part 
should 
return 
to 
its 
whole, 
it 
would 
not 
return 
as 
grave 
or 
light, 
for 
that 
the 
same 
Aristotle 
proveth, 
that 
the 
CoelestialBodiesareneitherheavienorlight. 


SALV. 


With 
what 
reason 
I 
doubt, 
whether 
grave 
bodies 
move 
by 
a 
right 
and 
perpendicular 
line, 
you 
shall 
hear, 
as 
I 
said 
before, 
when 
I 
shall 
examine 
this 
particular 
argument. 
Touching 
the 
second 
point, 
I 
wonder 
that 
you 
should 
need 
to 
discover 
the 
Paralogism 
of 
Aristotle, 
being 
of 
it 
self 
so 
manifest; 
and 
that 
you 
perceive 
not, 
that 
Aristotle 
supposeth 
that 
which 
is 
in 
question: 
thereforetakenotice. 


SIMPL. 


Pray 
Salviatus 
speak 
with 
more 
respect 
of 
Aristotle: 
for 
who 
can 
you 
ever 
perswade, 
that 
he 
who 
was 
the 
first, 
only, 
and 
admirable 
explainer 
of 
the 
Syllogistick 
forms 
of 
demonstration, 
Aristotle 
cannot 
equivocate, 
being 
the 
inventer 
of 
Logick. 
of 
Elenchs, 
of 
the 
manner 
of 
discovering 
Sophisms, 
Paralogisms, 
and 
in 
short, 
of 
all 
the 
parts 
of 
Logick, 
should 
afterwards 
so 
notoriously 
equivocate 
in 
imposing 
that 
for 
known, 
which 
is 
in 
question? 
It 



would 
be 
better, 
my 
Masters, 
first 
perfectly 
to 
understand 
him, 
and 
then 
to

SALV. 


Simplicius, 
we 
are 
here 
familiarly 
discoursing 
among 
our 
selves, 
to 
investigate 
some 
truth; 
I 
shall 
not 
be 
displeased 
that 
you 
discover 
my 
errors; 
and 
if 
I 
do 
not 
follow 
the 
mind 
of 
Aristotle, 
freely 
reprehend 
me, 
and 
I 
shall 
take 
it 
in 
good 
part. 
Onely 
give 
me 
leave 
to 
expound 
my 
doubts, 
and 
to 
reply 
something 
to 
your 
last 
words, 
telling 
you, 
that 
Logick, 
as 
it 
is 
well 
understood, 
is 
the 
Organe 
with 
which 
we 
philosophate; 
but 
as 
it 
may 
be 
possible, 
that 
an 
Artist 
may 
be 
excellent 
in 
making 
Organs, 
but 
unlearned 
in 
playing 
on 
them, 
thus 
he 
might 
be 
a 
great 
Logician, 
but 
unexpert 
in 
making 
use 
of 
Logick; 
like 
as 
we 
have 
many 
that 
theorically 
understand 
the 
whole 
Art 
of 
Poetry, 
and 
yet 
are 
unfortunate 
in 
composing 
but 
meer 
four 
Verses; 
others 
enjoy 
all 
the 
precepts 
of 
Vinci 
A 
famous 
Italian 
Painter., 
and 
yet 
know 
not 
how 
to 
paint 
a 
Stoole. 
The 
playing 
on 
the 
Organs 
is 
not 
taught 
by 
them 
who 
know 
how 
to 
make 
Organs, 
but 
by 
him 
that 
knows 
how 
to 
play 
on 
them: 
Poetry 
is 
learnt 
by 
continual 
reading 
of 
Poets: 
Limning 
is 
learnt 
by 
continual 
painting 
and 
designing: 
Demonstration 
from 
the 
reading 
of 
Books 
full 
of 
demonstrations, 
which 
are 
the 
Mathematical 
onely, 
and 
not 
the 
Logical. 
Now 
returning 
to 
our 
purpose, 
I 
say, 
that 
that 
which 
Aristotle 
seeth 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
light 
bodies, 
is 
the 
departing 
of 
the 
Fire 
from 
any 
part 
of 
the 
Superficies 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe, 
and 
directly 
retreating 
from 
it, 
mounting 
upwards; 
and 
this 
indeed 
is 
to 
move 
towards 
a 
circumference 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
the 
Earth; 
yea, 
the 
same 
Aristotle 
makes 
it 
to 
move 
to 
the 
concave 
of 
the 
Moon, 
but 
that 
this 
circumference 
is 
that 
of 
the 
World, 
or 
concentrick 
to 
it, 
so 
that 
to 
move 
towards 
this, 
is 
a 
moving 
towards 
that 
of 
the 
World, 
that 
he 
cannot 
affirm, 
unless 
he 
supposeth, 
That 
the 
Centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
Paralogism 
of 
Aristotle, 
in 
proving 
the 
Earth 
to 
be 
in 
the 
Centre 
of 
the 
World. 
from 
which 
we 
see 
these 
light 
ascendent 
bodies 
to 
depart, 
be 
the 
same 
with 
the 
Centre 
of 
the 
World; 
which 
is 
as 
much 
as 
to 
say, 
that 
the 
terrestrial 
Globe 
is 
constituted 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
World: 
which 
is 
yet 
that 
of 
which 
we 
were 
in 
doubt, 
and 
which 
Aristotle 
intended 
to 
prove. 
And 
do 
you 
say 
that 
this 
is 
not 
a 
manifest 
Paralogism?TheParalogismeofAristotleanotherwaydiscovered. 


SAGR. 



This 
Argument 
of 
Aristotle 
appeared 
to 
me 
deficient 
also, 
and 
nonconcludent 
for 
another 
respect; 
though 
it 
were 
granted, 
that 
that 
Circumference,to 
whichthe 
Fire 
directlymoveth, 
be 
that 
which 
includeth 
the 
World: 
for 
that 
in 
a 
circle, 
not 
onely 
the 
centre, 
but 
any 
other 
point 
being 
taken, 
every 
moveable 
which 
departing 
thence, 
shall 
move 
in 
a 
right 
line, 
and 
towards 
any 
whatsoever 
part, 
shall 
without 
any 
doubt 
go 
towards 
the 
circumference, 
and 
continuing 
the 
motion, 
shall 
also 
arrive 
thither; 
so 
that 
we 
may 
truly 
say, 
that 
it 
moveth 
towards 
the 
circumference: 
but 
yet 
it 
doth 
not 
follow, 
that 
that 
which 
moveth 
by 
the 
same 
line 
with 
a 
contrary 
motion, 
would 
go 
towards 
the 
centre, 
unless 
when 
the 
point 
taken 
were 
the 
centre 
it 
self, 
or 
that 
the 
motion 
were 
made 
by 
that 
onely 
line, 
which 
produced 
from 
the 
point 
assigned, 
passeth 
thorow 
the 
centre. 
So 
that 
to 
say, 
that 
Fire 
moving 
in 
a 
right 
line, 
goeth 
towards 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
World, 
therefore 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Earth 
which 
by 
the 
same 
lines 
move 
with 
a 
contrary 
motion, 
go 
towards 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
World, 
concludeth 
not, 
unless 
then 
when 
it 
is 
presupposed, 
that 
the 
lines 
of 
the 
Fire 
prolonged 
pass 
by 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
World; 
and 
because 
we 
know 
certainly 
of 
them, 
that 
they 
pass 
by 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
(being 
perpendicular 
to 
its 
superficies, 
and 
not 
inclined) 
therefore 
to 
conclude, 
it 
must 
be 
supposed, 
that 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth 
is 
the 
same 
with 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
World; 
or 
at 
least, 
that 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Fire 
and 
Earth 
descend 
not, 
save 
onely 
by 
one 
sole 
line 
which 
passeth 
by 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
World. 
Which 
nevertheless 
is 
false, 
and 
repugnant 
to 
experience, 
which 
sheweth 
us, 
that 
the 
parts 
of 
Fire, 
not 
by 
one 
line 
onely, 
but 
by 
infinite, 
produced 
from 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth 
towards 
all 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
World, 
ascend 
always 
by 
lines 
perpendicular 
to 
the 
Superficies 
of 
the 
TerrestrialGlobe.

whilst 
their

they

are 
still 
farther 
so

may 
more 



rationally

to

to 
the 
Centre

Earth, 
than 
of 
the 
Vniverse. 
not 
to 
go 
towards 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
but 
towards 
that 
of 
the 
Universe; 
which 
we 
know 
not 
where 
to 
find, 
or 
whether 
it 
be 
or 
no; 
and 
were 
it 
granted 
to 
be, 
it 
is 
but 
an 
imaginary 
point, 
and 
a 
nothing 
without 
any 
quality. 
As 
to 
what 
Simplicius 
said 
last, 
that 
the 
contending 
whether 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Sun, 
Moon, 
or 
other 
coelestial 
Body, 
separated 
from 
their 
Whole, 
should 
naturally 
return 
to 
it, 
is 
a 
vanity, 
for 
that 
the 
case 
is 
impossible; 
it 
being 
clear 
by 
the 
Demonstrations 
of 
Aristotle, 
that 
the 
coelestial 
Bodies 
are 
impassible, 
The 
conditions 
and 
attributes 
which 
differ 
the 
coelestial 
bodies 
from 
Elementary, 
depend 
on 
the 
motions 
assigned 
them 
by 
Arist. 
impenetrable, 
unpartable, 
&c. 
I 
answer, 
that 
none 
of 
the 
conditions, 
whereby 
Aristotle 
distinguisheth 
the 
Coelestial 
Bodies 
from 
Elementary, 
hath 
other 
foundation 
than 
what 
he 
deduceth 
from 
the 
diversity 
of 
the 
natural 
motion 
of 
those 
and 
these; 
insomuch 
that 
it 
being 
denied, 
that 
the 
circular 
motion 
is 
peculiar 
to 
Coelestial 
Bodies, 
and 
affirmed, 
that 
it 
is 
agreeable 
to 
all 
Bodies 
naturally 
moveable, 
it 
is 
behoofull 
upon 
necessary 
consequence 
to 
say, 
either 
that 
the 
attributes 
of 
generable, 
or 
ingenerable, 
alterable, 
or 
unalterable, 
partable, 
or 
unpartable, 
&c. 
equally 
and 
commonly 
agree 
with 
all 
worldly 
bodies, 
namely, 
as 
well 
to 
the 
Coelestial 
as 
to 
the 
Elementary; 
or 
that 
Aristotle 
hath 
badly 
and 
erroneously 
deduced 
those 
from 
the 
circular 
motion, 
which 
he 
hath 
assigned 
toCoelestialBodies. 


SIMPL. 


This 
manner 
of 
argumentation 
tends 
to 
the 
subversion 
of 
all 
Natural 
Philosophy, 
and 
to 
the 
disorder 
and 
subversion 
of 
Heaven 
and 
Earth, 
and 
the 
whole 
Universe; 
but 
I 
believe 
the 
Fundamentals

Take

As

your 
fears 
are 
vain 
for 
that

you 
your

as 
for

we

it,

we 
make 
it

to 
the 
Coelestial 
Bodies, 
and 
as 
it

whence 
your

have 
exiled 
it. 
The

Rather

I 
see 
not 
yet 
any 
need 
that 
Aristotle 
hath 
of 
help, 
standing 
as 
he 
doth 
stoutly 
and 
strongly 
on 
his 
feet; 
yea 
not 
being 
yet 
assaulted, 
much 
less 
foiled 
by 
you. 
And 
what 
ward 
will 
you 
choose 
in 
this 
combate 
for 
this 
first 
blow?Aristotles 
discourse 
to 
prove 
the 
incorruptibility 
of 
Heaven. 
Aristotle 
writeth, 
that 
whateveris 
generated,ismadeoutof 
acontraryinsomesubject, 
andlikewise 
is 
corrupted 
in 
some 
certain 
subject 
from 
a 
contrary 
into 
a 
contrary; 
Generation 
& 
corruption 
is 
onely 
amongst 
contraries, 
according 
to 
Arist. 
so 
that 
(observe) 
corruption 
and 
generation 
is 
never 
but 
onely 
in 
contraries; 
If 
therefore 
to 
a 
Coelestial 
Body 
no 
contrary 
can 
be 
assigned, 
for 
that 
to 
the 
circular 
motion 
no 
other 
motion 
is 
contrary, 
To 
the

no

then 
Nature 
hath

very 
well

incorruptible, 
This 
fundamental

it 
immediately 
followeth

that

confirmeth 
the 
same 
by 
sense; 
Immutability 
of 
Heaven 
evident 
to 
sense. 
in 
regard, 
that 
in 
all 
times 
past, 
according 
to 
memory 
or 
tradition, 
we 
see 
nothing 
removed, 
according 
to 
the 
whole 
outward 
Heaven, 
nor 
any 
of 
its 
proper 
parts. 
He 
proveth 
that 
the 
circular 
motion 
hath 
no 
contrary. 
Next, 
as 
to 
the 
circular 
motion, 
that 
no 
other 
is 
contrary 
to 
it, 
Aristotle 
proveth 
many 
ways; 
but 
without 
recitingthem 
all, 
it 
is 
sufficiently 
demonstrated, 
since 
simple 
motions 
are 
but 
three, 
to 
the 
medium, 
from 
the 
medium, 
and 
about 
the 
medium, 
of 
which 
the 
two 
right, 
sursum 
and 
deorsum, 
are 
manifestly 
contrary; 
and 
because 
one 
onely 
hath 
onely 
one 
for 
contrary, 
therefore 
there 
rests 
no 
other 
motion 
which 
may 
be 
contrary 
to 
the 



circular. 
You 
see 
the 
subtle 
and 
most 
concluding 
discourse 
of 
Aristotle, 
whereby 
heproveth 
the 
incorruptibilityof 
Heaven. 


SALV. 


This 
is 
nothing 
more, 
save 
the 
pure 
progress 
of 
Aristotle, 
by 
me 
hinted 
before; 
wherein, 
besides 
that 
I 
affirm, 
that 
the 
motion 
which 
you 
attribute 
to 
the 
Coelestial 
Bodies 
agreeth 
also 
to 
the 
Earth, 
its 
illation 
proves 
nothing. 
I 
tell 
you 
therefore, 
that 
that 
circular 
motion 
which 
you 
assign 
to 
Coelestial 
Bodies, 
suiteth 
also 
to 
the 
Earth, 
from 
which, 
supposing 
that 
the 
rest 
of 
your 
discourse 
were 
concludent, 
will 
follow 
one 
of 
these 
three 
things, 
as 
I 
told 
you 
a 
little 
before, 
and 
shall 
repeat; 
namely, 
either 
that 
the 
Earth 
it 
self 
is 
also 
ingenerable, 
and 
incorruptible, 
as 
the 
Coelestial 
bodies; 
or 
that 
the 
Coelestial 
bodies 
are, 
like 
as 
the 
Elementary 
generable, 
alterable 
&c. 
or 
that 
this 
difference 
of 
motion 
hath 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
Generation 
and 
Corruption. 
The 
discourse 
of 
Aristotle, 
and 
yours 
also 
contain 
many 
Propositions 
not 
to 
be 
lightly 
admitted, 
and 
the 
better 
to 
examine 
them, 
it 
will 
be 
convenient 
to 
reduce 
them 
to 
the 
most 
abstracted 
and 
distinct 
that 
can 
be 
possible; 
and 
excuse 
me 
Sagredus, 
if 
haply 
with 
some 
tediousness 
you 
hear 
me 
oft 
repeat 
the 
same 
things, 
and 
fancie 
that 
you 
see 
me 
reassume 
my 
argument 
in 
the 
publick 
circle 
of 
Disputations. 
You 
say 
Generation 
and 
Corruption 
are 
onely 
made 
where 
there 
are 
contraries; 
contraries 
are 
onely 
amongst 
simple 
natural 
bodies, 
moveable 
with 
contrary 
motions; 
contrary 
motions 
are 
onely 
those 
which 
are 
made 
by 
a 
right 
line 
between 
contrary 
terms; 
and 
these 
are 
onely 
two, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
from 
the 
medium, 
and 
towards 
the 
medium; 
and 
such 
motions 
belong 
to 
no 
other 
natural 
bodies, 
but 
to 
the 
Earth, 
the 
Fire, 
and 
the 
other 
two 
Elements: 
therefore 
Generation 
and 
Corruption 
is 
onely 
amongst 
the 
Elements. 
And 
because 
the 
third 
simple 
motion, 
namely, 
the 
circular 
aboutthe 
medium, 
hath 
no 
contrary, 
(for 
that 
theother 
two 
arecontraries, 
and 
one 
onely, 
hath 
but 
onely 
one 
contrary) 
therefore 
that 
natural 
body 
with 
which 
such 
motion 
agreeth, 
wants 
a 
contrary; 
and 
having 
no 
contrary 
is 
ingenerable 
and 
incorruptible, 
&c. 
Because 
where 
there 
is 
no 
contrariety, 
there 
is 
no 
generation 
or 
corruption, 
&c. 
But 
such 
motion 
agreeth 
onely 
with 
the 
Coelestial 
bodies; 
therefore 
onely 
these 
are 
ingenerable, 
Its 
easier 
to 
prove 
the 
Earth 
to 
move, 
than 
that 
corruption 
is 
made 
by 
contraries. 
incorruptible,&c. 
And 
to 
begin, 
Ithink 
it 
amore 
easie 
thing, 
and 
sooner 
done 
to 
resolve, 
whether 
the 
Earth 
(a 
most 
vast 
Body, 
and 
for 
its 
vicinity 
to 
us, 



most 
tractable) 
moveth 
with 
a 
speedy 
motion, 
such 
as 
its 
revolution 
about 
its 
own 
axis 
in 
twenty 
four 
hours 
would 
be, 
than 
it 
is 
to 
understand 
and 
resolve, 
whether 
Generation 
and 
Corruption 
ariseth 
from 
contrariety, 
or 
else 
whether 
there 
be 
such 
things 
as 
generation, 
corruption 
and 
contrariety 
in 
nature. 
And 
if 
you, 
Simplicius, 
can 
tell 
me 
what 
method 
Nature 
observes 
in 
working, 
when 
she 
in 
a 
very 
short 
time 
begets 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
flies 
from 
a 
little 
vapour 
of 
the 
Must 
of 
wine, 
and 
can 
shew 
me 
which 
are 
there 
the 
contraries 
you 
speakof,what 
it 
is 
that 
corrupteth,andhow; 
Ishould 
think 
you 
would 
do 
more 
than 
I 
can; 
for 
I 
profess 
I 
cannot 
comprehend 
these 
things. 
Besides, 
I 
would 
very 
gladly 
understand 
how, 
and 
why 
these 
corruptive 
contraries 
are 
so 
favourable 
to 
Daws, 
and 
so 
cruel 
to 
Doves; 
so 
indulgent 
to 
Stags, 
and 
so 
hasty 
to 
Horses, 
that 
they 
do 
grant 
to 
them 
many 
more 
years 
of 
life, 
that 
is, 
of 
incorruptibility, 
than 
weeks 
to 
these. 
Peaches 
and 
Olives 
are 
planted 
in 
the 
same 
soil, 
exposed 
to 
the 
same 
heat 
and 
cold, 
to 
the 
same 
wind 
and 
rains, 
and, 
in 
a 
word, 
to 
the 
same 
contrarieties; 
and 
yet 
those 
decay 
in 
a 
short 
time, 
and 
these 
live 
many 
hundred 
years. 
Furthermore, 
I 
never 
was 
thorowly 
satisfied 
about 
this 
substantial 
transmutation(still 
keeping 
within 
pure 
natural 
bounds) 
whereby 
a 
matter 
becometh 
so 
transform’d, 
that 
it 
should 
be 
necessarily 
said 
to 
be 
destroy’d, 
so 
that 
nothing 
remaineth 
of 
its 
first 
being, 
and 
that 
another 
body 
quite 
differing 
there-from 
should 
be 
thence 
produced; 
Bare 
transposition 
of 
parts 
may 
represent 
bodies 
under 
diverse 
asp 
cts. 
and 
if 
I 
fancy 
to 
my 
self 
a 
body 
under 
one 
aspect, 
and 
by 
and 
by 
under 
another 
very 
different, 
I 
cannot 
think 
it 
impossible 
but 
that 
it 
may 
happen 
by 
a 
simple 
transposition 
of 
parts, 
without 
corrupting 
or 
ingendring 
any 
thing 
a-new; 
for 
we 
see 
such 
kinds 
of 
Metamorphoses 
dayly: 
so 
that 
to 
return 
to 
my 
purpose, 
I 
answer 
you, 
that 
inasmuch 
as 
you 
go 
about 
to 
perswade 
me 
that 
the 
Earth 
can 
not 
move 
circularly 
by 
way 
of 
corruptibility 
and 
generability, 
you 
have 
undertook 
a 
much 
harder 
task 
than 
I, 
that 
with 
arguments 
more 
difficult 
indeed, 
but 
nolessconcluding,willprove 
thecontrary. 


SAGR. 


Pardon 
me, 
Salviatus, 
if 
I 
interrupt 
your 
discourse, 
which, 
as 
it 
delights 
me 
much, 
for 
that 
I 
also 
am 
gravel’d 
with 
the 
same 
doubts; 
so 
I 
fear 
that 
you 
can 
never 
conclude 
the 
same, 
without 
altogether 
digressing 
from 
your 
chief 
design: 
therefore 
if 
it 
be 
permitted 
to 
proceed 
in 
our 
first 
argument, 
I 
should 
think 
that 
it 
were 
convenient 
to 
remit 
this 
question 
of 
generation 
and 



corruption 
to 
another 
distinct 
and 
single 
conference; 
as 
also, 
if 
it 
shall 
please 
you 
and 
Simplicius, 
we 
may 
do 
by 
other 
particular 
questions 
which 
may 
fall 
in 
the 
way 
of 
our 
discourse; 
which 
I 
will 
keep 
in 
my 
mind 
to 
propose, 
and 
exactly 
discuss 
them 
some 
other 
time. 
Now 
as 
for 
the 
present, 
since 
you 
say, 
that 
if 
Aristotle 
deny 
circular 
motion 
to 
the 
Earth 
in 
common 
with 
other 
bodies 
Coelestial, 
it 
thence 
will 
follow, 
that 
the 
same 
which 
befalleth 
the 
Earth, 
as 
to 
its 
being 
generable, 
alterable, 
&c. 
will 
hold 
also 
of 
Heaven, 
let 
us 
enquire 
no 
further 
if 
there 
be 
such 
things 
in 
nature, 
as 
generation 
and 
corruption, 
or 
not; 
but 
let 
us 
return 
to 
enquire 
what 
the 
Globe 
of 
the 
Earth 
doth. 


SIMPL. 


I 
cannot 
suffer 
my 
ears 
to 
hear 
it 
question’d, 
whether 
generation 
and 
corruption 
be 
in 
rerum 
naturâ, 
it 
being 
a 
thing 
which 
we 
have 
continually 
before 
our 
eyes, 
By 
denying 
Principles 
in 
the 
Sciences, 
any 
Paradox 
may 
be 
maintained. 
and 
whereof 
Aristotle 
hath 
written 
two 
whole 
Books. 
But 
if 
you 
go 
about 
to 
deny 
the 
Principles 
of 
Sciences, 
and 
question 
things 
most 
manifest, 
who 
knows 
not, 
but 
that 
you 
may 
prove 
what 
you 
will, 
and 
maintain 
any 
Paradox? 
And 
if 
you 
do 
not 
dayly 
see 
herbs, 
plants, 
animals 
to 
generate 
and 
corrupt, 
what 
is 
it 
that 
you 
do 
see? 
Also, 
do 
you 
not 
continually 
behold 
contrarieties 
contend 
together, 
and 
the 
Earth 
change 
into 
Water, 
the 
Water 
turn 
to 
Air, 
the 
Air 
into 
Fire, 
and 
again 
the 
Air 
to 
condense 
into 
Clouds, 
Rains, 
Hails 
andStorms? 


SAGR. 


Yes, 
we 
see 
these 
things 
indeed, 
and 
therefore 
will 
grant 
you 
the 
discourse 
of 
Aristotle, 
as 
to 
this 
part 
of 
generation 
and 
corruption 
made 
by 
contraries; 
but 
if 
I 
shall 
conclude 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
same 
propositions 
which 
are 
granted 
to 
Aristotle, 
that 
the 
Coelestial 
bodies 
themselves 
are

Well 
then, 
if 
this 
be 
true, 
and 
it 
be 
also 
granted, 
that 
Coelestial 
Bodies 
are 


ingenerable 
and 
incorruptible; 
I 
prove 
that 
of 
necessity 
Coelestial 
Bodies 
mustbegenerableandcorruptible. 
SIMPL. 
Thismust 
needsbe 
aSophism. 


SAGR. 
Hear 
my 
Argument, 
Coelestial 
Bodies 
are 
generable 
and 
corruptible, 
because 
they 
are 
ingenerable 
and 
incorruptible. 
and 
then 
censure 
and 
resolve 
it. 
Coelestial 
Bodies, 
for 
that 
they 
are 
ingenerable 
and 
incorruptible, 
have 
in 
Nature 
their 
contraries, 
which 
are 
those 
Bodies 
that 
be 
generable 
and 
corruptible; 
but 
where 
there 
is 
contrariety, 
there 
is 
also 
generation 
and 
corruption;therefore 
CoelestialBodies 
aregenerableandcorruptible. 


SIMPL. 
Did 
I 
not 
say 
it 
could 
be 
no 
other 
than 
a 
Sophism? 
This 
is 
one 
of 
those 
forked 
ArgumentscalledSoritae:TheforkedSyllogismcal’d 
likethatoftheCretan, 
who 
said 
that 
all 
Cretans 
were 
lyars; 
but 
he 
as 
being 
a 
Cretan, 
had 
told 
a 
lye, 



in 
saying 
that 
the 
Cretans 
were 
lyars; 
it 
followed 
therefore, 
that 
the 
Cretans 
were 
no 
lyars, 
and 
consequently 
that 
he, 
as 
being 
a 
Cretan, 
had 
spoke 
truth: 
And 
yet 
in 
saying 
the 
Cretans 
were 
lyars, 
he 
had 
said 
true, 
and 
comprehending 
himself 
asa 
Cretan, 
hemustconsequentlybe 
alyar. 
And 
thus 
in 
these 
kinds 
of 
Sophisms 
a 
man 
may 
dwell 
to 
eternity, 
and 
never 
come 
to 
any 
conclusion. 


SAGR. 


You 
have 
hitherto 
censured 
it, 
it 
remaineth 
now 
that 
you 
answer 
it, 
shewing

SIMPL. 


As 
to 
the 
resolving 
of 
it, 
and 
finding 
out 
its 
fallacie, 
do 
you 
not 
in 
the 
first 
placesee 
amanifestcontradictionin 
it? 
CoelestialBodiesare 
ingenerable 
and 
incorruptible; 
Ergo, 
Coelestial 
Bodies 
are 
generable 
and 
corruptible. 
Amongst 
Coelestial 
Bodies 
there 
is 
no 
contrariety. 
And 
again, 
the 
contrariety 
is 
not 
betwixt 
the 
Coelestial 
Bodies, 
but 
betwixt 
the 
Elements, 
which 
have 
the 
contrariety 
of 
the 
Motions, 
sursùm 
and 
deorsùm, 
and 
of 
levity 
and 
gravity; 
But 
the 
Heavens 
which 
move 
circularly, 
to 
which 
motion 
no 
other 
motioniscontrary, 
wantcontrariety,andthereforethey

SAGR. 


Fair 
and 
softly, 
Simplicius; 
this 
contrariety 
whereby 
you 
say 
some 
simple 
Bodies 
become 
corruptible, 
resides 
it 
in 
the 
same 
Body 
which 
is 
corrupted, 
or 
else 
hath 
it 
relation 
to 
some 
other? 
I 
say, 
if, 
for 
example, 
humidity 
by 
which 
a 
piece 
of 
Earth 
is 
corrupted, 
resides 
it 
in 
the 
same 
Earth 
or 
in 
some 
other 
bodie, 
which 
must 
either 
be 
the 
Air 
or 
Water? 
I 
believe 
you 
will 
grant, 
that 
like 
as 
the 
Motions 
upwards 
and 
downwards, 
and 
gravity 
and 
levity, 
which 
you 
make 
the 
first 
contraries, 
cannot 
be 
in 
the 
same 
Subject, 
so 
neither 
can 
moist 
and 
dry, 
hot 
and 
cold: 
you 
must 
therefore 
consequently 
acknowledg 
that 
when 
a 
bodie 
corrupteth, 
Contraries 
which 
are 
the 
causes 
of 
corruption, 
reside 
not 
in 
the 
same 
body 
that 
corrupteth▪ 
it 
is 
occasioned 
by 
some 
quality 
residing 
in 
another 
contrary 
to 
its 
own: 
therefore 
to 
make 
the 
Coelestial 
Body 
become 
corruptible, 
it 
sufficeth 
that 
there 
are 
in 
Nature, 
bodies 
that 
have 
a 



contrariety 
to 
that 
Coelestial 
body; 
and 
such 
are 
the 
Elements, 
if 
it 
be 
true 
that 
corruptibilitybecontrarytoincorruptibility. 


SIMPL. 


This 
sufficeth 
not, 
Sir; 
The 
Elements 
alter 
and 
corrupt, 
because 
they 
are 
intermixed, 
and 
are 
joyn’d 
to 
one 
another, 
and 
so 
may 
exercise 
their 
contrariety; 
Coelestial 
Bodies 
touch, 
but 
are 
not 
touched 
by 
the 
Elements. 
but 
Coelestial 
bodies 
are 
separated 
from 
the 
Elements, 
by 
which 
they 
are 
not 
so 
much 
as 
toucht, 
though 
indeed 
they 
have 
an 
influence 
upon 
the 
Elements. 
It 
is 
requisite, 
if 
you 
will 
prove 
generation 
and 
corruption 
in 
Coelestial 
bodies, 
that

SAGR. 


See 
how 
I 
will 
find 
those 
contrarieties 
between 
them. 
The 
first 
fountain 
from 
whence 
you 
derive 
the 
contrariety 
of 
the 
Elements, 
is 
the 
contrariety 
of 
their 
motions 
upwards 
and 
downwards: 
it 
therefore 
is 
necessary 
that 
those 
Principles 
be 
in 
like 
manner 
contraries 
to 
each 
other, 
Gravity 
& 
levity, 
rarity 
and 
density, 
are 
contrary 
qualities. 
upon 
which 
those 
motions 
depend: 
and 
because 
that 
is 
moveable 
upwards 
by 
lightness, 
and 
this 
downwards 
by 
gravity, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
lightness 
and 
gravity 
are 
contrary 
to 
each 
other: 
no 
less 
are 
we 
to 
believe 
those 
other 
Principles 
to 
be 
contraries, 
which 
are 
the 
causes 
that 
this 
is 
heavy, 
and 
that 
light: 
but 
by 
your 
own 
confession, 
levity 
and 
gravity 
follow 
as 
consequents 
of 
rarity 
and 
density; 
therefore 
rarity 
and 
density 
shall 
be 
contraries: 
The 
stars 
infinitely 
surpass 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
Heaven 
in 
density. 
the 
which 
conditions 
or 
affections 
are 
so 
amply 
found 
in 
Coelestial 
bodies, 
that 
you 
esteem 
the 
stars 
to 
be 
onely 
more 
dense 
parts 
of 
their 
Heaven: 
and 
if 
this 
be 
so, 
it 
followeth 
that 
the 
density 
of 
the 
stars 
exceeds 
that 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
Heaven, 
by 
almost 
infinite 
degrees: 
which 
is 
manifest, 
in 
that 
Heaven 
is 
infinitely 
transparent, 
and 
the 
stars 
extremely 
opacous; 
and 
for 
that 
there 
are 
there 
above 
no 
other 
qualities, 
but 
more 
and 
less 
density 
and 
rarity, 
which 
may 
be 
causes 
of 
the 
greater 
or 
less 
transparency. 
There 
being 
then 
such 
contrariety 
between 
the 
Coelestial 
bodies, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
they 
also 
be 
generable 
and 
corruptible, 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
the 
Elementary 
bodies 
are; 
or 
else 
that 
contrariety 
is 
not 
the 
cause 
of 
corruptibility, 
Rarity 
& 
density 
in 
Coelestial 
bodies, 
is 
different 
from 
the 
rarity&densityof 
the 
elements. 
&c. 



SIMPL. 


There 
is 
no 
necessity 
either 
of 
one 
or 
the 
other, 
for 
that 
density 
and 
rarity 
in 
Coelestial 
bodies, 
are 
not 
contraries 
to 
each 
other, 
as 
in 
Elementary 
bodies; 
for 
that 
they 
depend 
not 
on 
the 
primary 
qualities, 
cold 
and 
heat, 
which 
are 
contraries;buton

Therefore 
affirming, 
that 
density 
and 
rarity, 
which 
amongst 
the 
Elements 
should 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
gravity 
and 
levity, 
which 
may 
be 
the 
causes 
of 
contrary 
motions 
sursum 
and 
deors 
m, 
on 
which, 
again, 
dependeth 
the 
contrarieties 
for 
generation 
and 
corruption; 
it 
sufficeth 
not 
that 
they 
be 
those 
densnesses 
and 
rarenesses 
which 
under 
the 
same 
quantity, 
or 
(if 
you 
will) 
mass 
contain 
much 
or 
little 
matter, 
but 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
they 
be 
densnesses 
and 
rarenesses 
caused 
by 
the 
primary 
qualities, 
hot 
and 
cold, 
otherwise 
they 
would 
operate 
nothing 
at 
all: 
but 
if 
this 
be 
so, 
Aristotle 
defective 
in 
assigning 
the 
causes 
why 
the 
elements 
are 
generable 
& 
corruptible. 
Aristotle 
hath 
deceived 
us, 
for 
that 
he 
should 
have 
told 
it 
us 
at 
first, 
and 
so 
have 
left 
written 
that 
those 
simplebodiesaregenerableandcorruptible,thataremoveablewith 
simple

upwards 
and

dependent 
on

caused

rarity 
and

made 
by 
much 
or 
little

by 
reason 
of 
heat 
and 
cold; 
and 
not 
to 
have 
staid 
at 
the

sursum 
and

for 
I 
assure 
you 
that 
to 
the 
making 
of 
bodies 
heavy 
or 
light, 
whereby 
they 
come 
to 
be 
moved 
with 
contrary 
motions, 
any 
kind 
of 
density 
and 
rarity 
sufficeth, 
whether 
it 
proceed 
from 
heat 
and 
cold, 
or 
what 
else 
you 
please; 
for 
heat 
and 
cold 
have 
nothing 
to 
do 
in 
this 
affair: 
and 
you 
shall 
upon 
experiment 
find, 
that 
a 
red 
iron, 
which 
you 
must 
grant 
to 
have 
heat, 
weigheth 
as 
much, 
and 
moves 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
when 
it

But 
to 
overpass 
this 
also, 
how

SIMPL. 


I

SALV. 


I 
see 
we 
are 
again 
going 
about 
to 
engulph 
our 
selves 
in 
a 
bottomless 
ocean, 
where 
there 
is 
no 
getting 
to 
shore; 
for 
this 
is 
a 
Navigation 
without 
Compass, 
Stars, 
or 
Rudder: 
so 
that 
it 
will 
follow 
either 
that 
we 
be 
forced 
to 
pass 
from 
Shelf 
to 
Shelf,

run 
on

Therefore, 
if 
according

your 
advice 
we 
shall 
proceed 
in 
our 
main

we 
must 
of 
necessity 
for 
the 
present 
overpass 
this 
general 
consideration, 
whether 
direct 
motion 
be 
necessary 
in 
Nature, 
and 
agree 
with 
some

and 
come 
to 
the

propounding 
in 
the

all 
those 
that 
have 
been 
hitherto 
alledged 
by 
Aristotle, 
Ptolomey,

others, 
to 
prove 
the 
stability 
of 
the

endeavouring 
in 
the 
next 
place 
to 
answer 
them: 
and 
producing 
in 
the 
last 
place, 
those, 
by 
which

may 
be 
perswaded, 
that 
the

is 
no

the

I 
shall 
the 
more 
willingly 
incline

in 
that 
I 
am 
better 
satisfied 
with 
your 
Architectonical

the

at 
every

crosseth 
my

with 
some

And 
I 
see 
no 
reason 
why 
Simplicius 
should 
not 
be 
presently 
satisfied 
with 
the 
Argument 
you 
alledg, 
to 
prove 
that 
there 
can 
be 
no 
such 
thing 
in 
nature 
as 
a 
motion 
by 
a 
right 
line, 
if 
we 
do 
but 
presuppose 
that 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Universe 
are 
disposed 
in 
an 
excellent 
constitution 
and 
perfectorder. 


SALV. 


Stay 
a 
little, 
good 
Sagredus, 
for 
just 
now 
a 
way 
comes 
into 
my 
mind, 
how 
I 
may 
give 
Simplicius 
satisfaction, 
provided 
that 
he 
will 
not 
be 
so 
strictly 
wedded 
to 
every 
expression 
of 
Aristotle, 
as 
to 
hold 
it 
heresie 
to 
recede 
in 
any 
thing 
from 
him. 
Nor 
is 
there 
any 
question 
to 
be 
made, 
but 
that 
if 
we 
grant 
the 
excellent 
disposition 
and 
perfect 
order 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Universe, 
as 
to 
local 
scituation, 
that 
then 
there 
is 
no 
other 
but 
the 
circular 
motion, 
and 
rest; 
for 
as 
to 
the 
motion 
by 
a 
right 
line, 
I 
see 
not 
how 
it 
can 
be 
of 
use 
for 
any 
thing, 
but 



to 
reduce 
to 
their 
natural 
constitution, 
some 
integral 
bodies, 
that 
by 
some 
accidentwereremov’dandseparatedfromtheirwhole,aswesaidabove. 


Let 
usnow 
considerthewhole 
TerrestrialGlobe,and 
enquire 
thebestwecan, 
whether 
it, 
and 
the 
other 
Mundane 
bodies 
are 
to 
conserve 
themselves 
in 
their 
perfect 
and 
natural 
disposition. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
say, 
that 
it 
rests 
and 
keeps 
perpetually 
immoveable 
in 
its 
place; 
or 
else 
that 
continuing 
always 
in 
its 
place, 
it 
revolves 
in 
its 
self; 
or 
that 
it 
turneth 
about 
a 
Centre, 
moving 
by 
the 
circumference 
of 
a 
circle. 
Arist. 
& 
Ptolomey 
make 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
immoveable. 
Of 
which 
accidents, 
both 
Aristotle 
and 
Ptolomey, 
and 
all 
their 
followers 
say, 
that 
it 
hath 
ever 
observed, 
and 
shall 
continually 
keep 
the 
first, 
that 
is, 
a 
perpetual 
rest 
in 
the 
same 
place. 
It 
is 
better 
to 
say, 
that 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
naturally 
resteth, 
than 
that 
it 
moveth 
directly 
downwards. 
Now, 
why, 
I 
pray 
you, 
ought 
they 
not 
to 
have 
said, 
that 
its 
natural 
affection 
is 
to 
rest 
immoveable, 
rather 
than 
to 
make 
natural 
unto 
it 
the 
motionThe 
word 
is, 
all’ 
ingiù, 
which 
the 
Latine 
version 
rendreth 
sursùm, 
which 
is 
quite 
contrary 
to 
the 
Authors 
sense. 
downwards, 
with 
which 
motion 
it 
never 
did 
or 
shall 
move? 
And 
as 
to 
the 
motion 
by 
a 
right 
line, 
they 
must 
grant 
us 
that 
Nature 
maketh 
use 
of 
it 
to 
reduce 
the 
small 
parts 
of 
the 
Earth, 
Water, 
Air, 
Fire, 
and 
every 
other 
integral 
Mundane 
body 
to 
their 
Whole, 
when 
any 
of 
them 
by 
chance 
are 
separated, 
and 
so 
transported 
out 
of 
their 
proper 
place; 
if 
also 
haply, 
some 
circularmotion 
mightnot 
befound 
to 
bemore 
convenient 
to 
make 
this 
restitution. 
In 
my 
judgment, 
this 
primary 
position 
answers 
much 
better, 
even 
according 
to 
Aristotles 
own 
method, 
to 
all 
the 
other 
consequences, 
than 
to 
attribute 
the 
straight 
motion 
to 
be 
an 
intrinsick 
and 
natural 
principle 
of 
the 
Elements. 
Which 
is 
manifest, 
for 
that 
if 
I 
aske 
the 
Peripatetick, 
if, 
being 
of 
opinion 
that 
Coelestial 
bodies 
are 
incorruptibe 
and 
eternal, 
he 
believeth 
that 
the 
Terrestial 
Globe 
is 
not 
so, 
but 
corruptible 
and 
mortal, 
so 
that 
there 
shall 
come 
a 
time, 
when 
the 
Sun 
and 
Moon 
and 
other 
Stars, 
continuing 
their 
beings 
and 
operations, 
the 
Earth 
shall 
not 
be 
found 
in 
the 
World, 
but 
shall 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
Elements 
be 
destroyed 
and 
annihilated, 
I 
am 
certain 
that 
he 
would 
answer 
me, 
no: 
therefore 
generation 
and 
corruption 
is 
in 
the 
parts 
and 
not 
in 
the 
whole; 
Right 
Motion 
with 
more 
reason 
attributed 
to 
the 
parts, 
than 
to 
the 
whole 
Elements. 
and 
in 
the 
parts 
very 
small 
and 
superficial, 
which 
are, 
as 
it 
were, 
incensible 
in 
comparison 
of 
the 
whole 
masse. 
And 
because 
Aristotle 
deduceth 
generation 
and 
corruption 
from 
the 
contrariety 
of 
streight 
motions, 
let 
us 
remit 
such 
motions 
to 
the 



parts, 
which 
onely 
change 
and 
decay, 
and 
to 
the 
whole 
Globe 
and 
Sphere 
of 
the 
Elements, 
let 
us 
ascribe 
either 
the 
circular 
motion, 
or 
a 
perpetual 
consistance 
in 
its 
proper 
place: 
the 
only 
affections 
apt 
for 
perpetuation, 
and 
maintaining 
of 
perfect 
order. 
This 
which 
is 
spoken 
of 
the 
Earth, 
may 
be 
said 
with 
the 
same 
reason 
of 
Fire, 
and 
of 
the 
greatest 
part 
of 
the 
Air; 
to 
which 
Elements, 
The 
Peripateticks 
improperly 
assign 
those 
motions 
to 
the 
Elements 
for 
Natural, 
with 
which 
they 
never 
were 
moved, 
and 
those 
for 
Preternatural 
with 
which 
they 
alwayes 
are 
moved. 
the 
Peripateticks 
are 
forced 
to 
ascribe 
for 
intrinsical 
and 
natural, 
a 
motion 
wherewith 
they 
were 
never 
yet 
moved, 
nornever 
shallbe; 
and 
to 
call 
that 
motionpreternaturaltothem, 
wherewith,if 
they 
move 
at 
all, 
they 
do 
and 
ever 
shall 
move. 
This 
I 
say, 
because 
they 
assign 
to 
the 
Air 
and 
Fire 
the 
motion 
upwards, 
wherewith 
those 
Elements 
were 
never 
moved, 
but 
only 
some 
parts 
of 
them, 
and 
those 
were 
so 
moved 
onely 
in 
order 
to 
the 
recovery 
of 
their 
perfect 
constitution, 
when 
they 
were 
out 
of 
their 
natural 
places; 
and 
on 
the 
contrary 
they 
call 
the 
circular 
motion 
preternatural 
to 
them, 
though 
they 
are 
thereby 
incessantly 
moved: 
forgeting, 
as 
it 
seemeth, 
whatAristotleoftinculcateth,that 
nothing 
violentcan 
bepermanent. 


SIMPL. 


To 
all 
these 
we 
have 
very 
pertinent 
answers, 
Sensible 
experiments 
to 
be 
preferred 
to 
humane 
Arguments. 
which 
I 
for 
this 
time 
omit, 
that 
we 
may 
come 
to 
the 
more 
particular 
reasons, 
and 
sensible 
experiments, 
which 
ought 
in 
conclusion 
to 
be 
opposed,

Aristotle 
saith 
well,

What 
hath 
been

hitherto, 
serves

clear 
up 
unto

which 
of 
the 
two 
general 
discourses 
carrieth 
with 
it 
most 
of 
probability, 
I 
mean 
that 
of 
Aristotle, 
which 
would 
perswade 
us, 
that 
the 
sublunary 
bodies 
are 
by 
nature 
generable, 
and 
corruptible, 
&c. 
and 
therefore 
most 
different 
from 
the 
essence 
of 
Coelestial 
bodies, 
which 
are 
impassible, 
ingenerable, 
incorruptible, 
&c. 
drawn 
from 
the 
diversity 
of 
simple 
motions; 
or 
else 
this 
of 
Salviatus, 
who 
supposing 
the 
integral 
parts 
of 
the 
World 
to 
be 
disposed 
in 
a 
perfect 
constitution, 
excludes 
by 
necessary

the

much 
more 
likely, 
in 
my 
judgment, 
than 
that 
other. 
Therefore 
resolve, 
Simplicius, 
to 
produce 
all 
the 
particular 
reasons, 
experiments 
and 
observations, 
as 
well 
Natural 
as 
Astronomical, 
that 
may 
serve 
to 
perswade 
us 
that 
the 
Earth 
differeth 
from 
the 
Coelestial 
bodies, 
is 
immoveable, 
and 
situated 
in 
the 
Centre 
of 
the 
World, 
and 
what 
ever 
else 
excludes 
its 
moving 
like 
to 
the 
Planets, 
as 
Jupiter 
or 
the 
Moon, 
&c. 
And 
Salviatus 
will 
be 
pleased 
to 
be 
so 
civil 
as 
to 
answer 
to 
them 
one 
byone. 


SIMPL. 


See 
here 
for 
a 
begining, 
two 
most 
convincing 
Arguments 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
Earthtobemost 
differentfromtheCoelestialbodies. 
First,thebodiesthatare 
generable, 
corruptible, 
alterable, 
&c. 
are 
quite 
different 
from 
those 
that 
are 
ingenerable, 
incorruptible, 
unalterable, 
&c. 
But 
the 
Earth 
is 
generable, 
corruptible, 
alterable, 
&c. 
and 
the 
Coelestial 
bodies 
ingenerable, 
incorruptible, 
unalterable, 
&c. 
Therefore 
the 
Earth 
is 
quite 
different 
from 
the 
Coelestialbodies. 


SAGR. 


By 
your 
first 
Argument 
you 
spread 
the 
Table 
with 
the 
same 
Viands, 
which 
butjust 
nowwithmuchadoe 
were 
voided. 


SIMPL. 


Hold 
a 
little, 
Sir, 
and 
take 
the 
rest 
along 
with 
you, 
and 
then 
tell 
me 
if 
this 
be 
not 
different 
from 
what 
you 
had 
before. 
In 
the 
former, 
the 
Minor 
was 
proved 
à 
priori, 
& 
now 
you 
see 
it 
proved 
à 
posteriori: 
Judg 
then 
if 
it 
be 
the 
same. 
I 
prove 
the 
Minor, 
therefore 
(the 
Major 
being 
most 
manifest) 
by 
sensible 
experience, 
which 
that 
in 
the 
Earth 
there 
are 
made 
continual 
generations, 
corruptions, 
alterations, 
&c. 
which 
neither 
our 
senses, 
nor 
the 
traditions 
or 
memories 
of 
our 
Ancestors, 
ever 
saw 
an 
instance 
of 
in 
Heaven; 
therefore 
Heaven 
is 
unalterable, 
&c. 
and 
the 
Earth 
alterable, 
Heaven 
immutable, 
because 
there 
never 
was 
any 
mutation 
seen 
in 
it. 
&c. 
and 
therefore 
different 
from 
Heaven. 
I 
take 
my 
second 
Argument 
from 
a 
principal 
and 
essential 
accident, 
and 
it 
is 
this. 
That 
body 
which 
is 
by 
its 
nature 
obscure 
and 
deprived 
of 
light, 
Bodies 
naturally 
lucid, 
are 
different 
from 
those 
which 
are 
by 
nature 



obscure. 
is 
divers 
from 
the 
luminous 
and 
shining 
bodies; 
but 
the 
Earth 
is 
obscureand 
voidoflight,and 
the 
Coelestialbodiessplendid, 
andfulloflight; 
Ergo, 
&c. 
Answer 
to 
these 
Arguments 
first, 
that 
we 
may 
not 
heap 
up 
too 
many,andthenIwill 
alledge 
others. 


SALV. 


As 
to 
the 
first, 
the 
stresse 
whereof 
you 
lay 
upon 
experience, 
I 
desire 
that 
you 
would 
a 
little 
more 
distinctly 
produce 
me 
the 
alteration 
which 
you 
see 
made 
in 
the 
Earth, 
and 
not 
in 
Heaven; 
upon 
which 
you 
call 
the 
Earth 
alterable, 
and 
theHeavensnotso. 


SIMPL. 


I 
see 
in 
the 
Earth, 
plants 
and 
animals 
continually 
generating 
and 
decaying; 
winds, 
rains, 
tempests, 
storms 
arising; 
and 
in 
a 
word, 
the 
aspect 
of 
the 
Earth 
to 
be 
perpetually 
metamorphosing; 
none 
of 
which 
mutations 
are 
to 
be 
discern’d 
in 
the 
Coelestial 
bodies; 
the 
constitution 
and 
figuration 
of 
which 
is 
most 
punctually 
conformable 
to 
that 
they 
ever 
weretime 
out 
ofmind; 
without 
the 
generation 
of 
any 
thing 
that 
is 
new, 
or 
corruption 
of 
any 
thing 
that 
was 
old. 


SALV. 


But 
if 
you 
content 
your 
self 
with 
these 
visible, 
or 
to 
say 
better, 
seen 
experiments, 
you 
must 
consequently 
account 
China 
and 
America 
Coelestial 
bodies, 
for 
doubtlesse 
you 
never 
be 
held 
in 
them 
these 
alterations 
which 
you 
see 
here 
in 
Italy, 
and 
that 
therefore 
according 
to 
your 
apprehension 
they 
are 
inalterable. 


SIMPL. 


Though 
I 
never 
did 
see 
these 
alterations 
sensibly 
in 
those 
places, 
the 
relations 
of 
them 
are 
not 
to 
be 
questioned; 
besides 
that, 
cum 
eadem 
sit 
ratio 
totius, 
& 
partium, 
those 
Countreys 
being 
a 
part 
of 
the 
Earth, 
as 
well 
as 
ours, 
they 
must 
ofnecessity 
bealterableastheseare. 


SALV. 



And 
why 
have 
you 
not, 
without 
being 
put 
to 
believe 
other 
mens 
relations, 
examinedand 
observedthosealterations 
withyourowneyes? 


SIMPL. 


Because 
those 
places, 
besides 
that 
they 
are 
not 
exposed 
to 
our 
eyes, 
are 
so 
remote, 
that 
our 
sight 
cannot 
reach 
to 
comprehend 
therein 
such 
like 
mutations. 


SALV. 


See 
now, 
how 
you 
have 
unawares 
discovered 
the 
fallacy 
of 
your 
Argument; 
for, 
if 
you 
say 
that 
the 
alterations 
that 
are 
seen 
on 
the 
Earth 
neer 
at 
hand, 
cannot, 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
too 
great 
distance, 
be 
seen 
in 
America, 
much 
lesse 
can 
you 
see 
them 
in 
the 
Moon, 
which 
is 
so 
many 
hundred 
times 
more 
remote: 
And 
if 
you 
believe 
the 
alterations 
in 
Mexico 
upon 
the 
report 
of 
those 
that 
come 
from 
thence, 
what 
intelligence 
have 
you 
from 
the 
Moon, 
to 
assure 
you 
that 
there 
is 
no 
such 
alterations 
in 
it? 
Therefore, 
from 
your 
not 
seeing 
any 
alterations 
in 
Heaven, 
whereas, 
if 
there 
were 
any 
such, 
you 
could 
not 
see 
them 
by 
reason 
of 
their 
too 
great 
distance, 
and 
from 
your 
not 
having 
intelligence 
thereof, 
in 
regard 
that 
it 
cannot 
be 
had, 
you 
ought 
not 
to 
argue, 
that 
there 
are 
no 
such 
alterations; 
howbeit, 
from 
the 
seeing 
and 
observing 
of 
themonEarth,youwellarguethatthereinsuchthereare. 


SIMPL. 


I 
will 
shew 
so 
great 
mutations 
that 
have 
befaln 
on 
the 
Earth; 
that 
if 
any 
such 
had 
happened 
in 
the 
Moon, 
they 
might 
very 
well 
have 
been 
observed 
here 
below. 
The 
Mediterranian 
Sea 
made 
by 
the 
separation 
of 
Abila 
and 
Calpen. 
We 
find 
in 
very 
antient 
records, 
that 
heretofore 
at 
the 
Streights 
of 
Gibraltar, 
the 
two 
great 
Mountains 
Abila, 
and 
Calpen, 
were 
continued 
together 
by 
certain 
other 
lesse 
Mountains, 
which 
there 
gave 
check 
to 
the 
Ocean: 
but 
those 
Hills, 
being 
by 
some 
cause 
or 
other 
separated, 
and 
a 
way 
being 
opened 
for 
the 
Sea 
to 
break 
in, 
it 
made 
such 
an 
inundation, 
that 
it 
gave 
occasion 
to 
the 
calling 
of 
it 
since 
the 
Mid-land 
Sea: 
the 
greatness 
whereof 
considered, 
and 
the 
divers 
aspects 
the 
surfaces 
of 
the 
Water 
and 
Earth 
then 
made, 
had 
it 
been 
beheld 
afar 
off, 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
but 
so 
great 
a 
change 
might 
have 
been 
discerned 
by 
one 
that 
was 
then 
in 
the 
Moon; 
as 
also 
to 
us 
inhabitants 
of 
the 



Earth, 
the 
like 
alterations 
would 
be 
perceived 
in 
the 
Moon; 
but 
we 
find 
not 
in 
antiquity, 
that 
ever 
there 
wassuch 
athing 
seen;therefore 
we 
have 
nocause 
to 
say,that 
anyof 
the 
Coelestialbodiesare 
alterable,&c. 


SALV. 


That 
so 
great 
alterations 
have 
hapned 
in 
the 
Moon, 
I 
dare 
not 
say, 
but 
for 
all 
that,I 
am 
notyetcertain 
butthatsuchchangesmight 
occur; 
and 
because 
such 
a 
mutation 
could 
onely 
represent 
unto 
us 
some 
kind 
of 
variation 
between 
the 
more 
clear, 
and 
more 
obscure 
parts 
of 
the 
Moon, 
I 
know 
not 
whether 
we 
have 
had 
on 
Earth 
observant 
Selenographers, 
who 
have 
for 
any 
considerable 
number 
of 
years, 
instructed 
us 
with 
so 
exact 
Selenography, 
as 
that 
we 
should 
confidently 
conclude, 
that 
therehath 
no 
such 
changehapned 
in 
theface 
of 
the 
Moon; 
of 
the 
figuration 
of 
which 
I 
find 
no 
more 
particular 
description, 
than 
the 
saying 
of 
some, 
that 
it 
represents 
an 
humane 
face; 
of 
others, 
that 
it 
is 
like 
the 
muzle 
of 
a 
Lyon; 
and 
of 
others, 
that 
it 
is 
Cain 
with 
a 
bundle 
of 
thorns 
on 
his 
back: 
therefore, 
to 
say 
Heaven 
is 
unalterable, 
because 
that 
in 
the 
Moon, 
or 
other 
Coelestial 
bodies, 
no 
such 
alterations 
are 
seen, 
as 
discover 
themselves 
onEarth,isa 
badillation, 
andconcludethnothing. 


SAGR. 


And 
there 
is 
another 
odd 
kind 
of 
scruple 
in 
this 
Argument 
of 
Simplicius, 
running 
in 
my 
mind, 
which 
I 
would 
gladly 
have 
answered; 
therefore 
I 
demand 
of 
him, 
whether 
the 
Earth 
before 
the 
Mediterranian 
inundation 
was 
generableand 
corruptible,or 
elsebeganthenso 
tobe? 


SIMPL. 


It 
was 
doubtless 
generable 
and 
corruptible 
also 
before 
that 
time; 
but 
that 
was 
sovasta 
mutation,thatitmighthavebeen

SAGR. 


Go 
to; 
if 
the 
Earth 
was 
generable 
and 
corruptible 
before 
that 
Inundation, 
why 
may 
not 
the 
Moon 
be 
so 
likewise 
without 
such 
a 
change? 
Or 
why 
should 
that 
benecessaryin 
the 
Moon, 
whichimportethnothingon 
Earth? 



SALV. 


It 
is 
a 
shrewd 
question: 
But 
I 
am 
doubtfull 
that 
Simplicius 
a 
little 
altereth 
the 
Text 
of 
Aristotle, 
and 
the 
other 
Peripateticks, 
who 
say, 
they 
hold 
the 
Heavens 
unalterable, 
for 
that 
they 
see 
therein 
no 
one 
star 
generate 
or 
corrupt, 
which 
is 
probably 
a 
less 
part 
of 
Heaven, 
than 
a 
City 
is 
of 
the 
Earth, 
and 
yet 
innumerable 
of 
these 
have 
been 
destroyed, 
so 
as 
that 
no 
mark 
of 
them 
hath 
remain’d. 


SAGR. 


I 
verily 
believed 
otherwise, 
and 
conceited 
that 
Simplicius 
dissembled 
this 
exposition 
of 
the 
Text, 
that 
he 
might 
not 
charge 
his 
Master 
and 
Consectators, 
with 
a 
notion 
more 
absurd 
than 
the 
former. 
And 
what 
a 
folly 
it 
is 
to 
say 
the 
Coelestial 
part 
is 
unalterable, 
because 
no 
stars 
do 
generate 
or 
corrupt 
therein? 
What 
then? 
hath 
any 
one 
seen 
a 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
corrupt, 
and 
another 
regenerate 
in 
itsplace? 
And 
yetisitnot 
onall 
handsgranted 
byPhilosophers, 
that 
there 
are 
very 
few 
stars 
in 
Heaven 
less 
than 
the 
Earth, 
Its 
no 
less 
impossible 
for 
a 
star 
to 
corrupt, 
than 
for 
the 
whole 
Terrestrial 
Globe. 
but 
very 
many 
that 
are 
much 
bigger? 
So 
that 
for 
a 
star 
in 
Heaven 
to 
corrupt, 
would 
be 
no 
less 
than 
if 
the 
whole 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
should 
be 
destroy’d. 
Therefore, 
if 
for 
the 
true 
proof 
of 
generation 
and 
corruption 
in 
the 
Universe, 
it 
be 
necessary 
that 
so 
vast 
bodies 
as 
a 
star, 
must 
corrupt 
and 
regenerate, 
you 
may 
satisfie 
your 
self 
and 
cease 
your 
opinion; 
for 
I 
assure 
you, 
that 
you 
shall 
never 
see 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
or 
any 
other 
integral 
body 
of 
the 
World, 
to 
corrupt 
or 
decay 
so, 
that 
having 
been 
beheld 
by 
us 
for 
so 
many 
years 
past, 
theyshouldsodissolve,as 
not 
toleaveany 
footstepsofthem. 


SALV. 


But 
to 
give 
Simplicius 
yet 
fuller 
satisfaction, 
and 
to 
reclaim 
him, 
Aristotle 
would 
change 
his 
opinion, 
did 
he 
see 
the 
novelties 
of 
our 
age. 
if 
possible, 
from 
his 
error; 
I 
affirm, 
that 
we 
have 
in 
our 
age 
new 
accidents 
and 
observations, 
and 
such, 
that 
I 
question 
not 
in 
the 
least, 
but 
if 
Aristotle 
were 
now 
alive, 
they 
would 
make 
him 
change 
his 
opinion; 
which 
may 
be 
easily 
collected 
from 
the 
very 
manner 
of 
his 
discoursing: 
For 
when 
he 
writeth 
that 
he 
esteemeth 
the 
Heavens 
inalterable, 
&c. 
because 
no 
new 
thing 
was 
seen 
to 
be 
begot 
therein, 
or 
any 
old 
to 
be 
dissolved, 
he 
seems 
implicitely 
to 
hint 
unto 



us, 
that 
when 
he 
should 
see 
any 
such 
accident, 
he 
would 
hold 
the 
contrary: 
and 
, 
as 
indeed 
it 
is 
meet, 
sensible 
experiments 
to 
natural 
reason: 
for 
had 
he 
not 
made 
any 
reckoning 
of 
the 
senses, 
he 
would 
not 
then 
from 
the 
not 
seeing 
ofanysensiblemutation,have 
arguedimmutability. 


SIMPL. 


Aristotle 
deduceth 
his 
principal 
Argument 
à 
priori, 
shewing 
the 
necessity 
of 
theinalterabilityof 
Heaven 
bynatural,manifest 
andclearprinciples;and 
then 
stablisheth 
the 
sameàposteriori, 
bysense,and 
the

SALV. 


This 
you 
speak 
of 
is 
the 
Method 
he 
hath 
observed 
in 
delivering 
his 
Doctrine, 
but 
I 
do 
not 
bethink 
it 
yet 
to 
be 
that 
wherewith 
he 
invented 
it; 
for 
I 
do 
believe 
for 
certain, 
that 
he 
first 
procured 
by 
help 
of 
the 
senses, 
such 
experiments 
and 
observations 
as 
he 
could, 
The 
certainty 
of 
the 
conclusion 
helpeth 
by 
a 
resolutive 
method 
to 
find 
the 
demonstration. 
to 
assure 
him 
as 
much 
as 
it 
was 
possible, 
of 
the 
conclusion, 
and 
that 
he 
afterwards 
sought 
out 
the 
means 
how 
to 
demonstrate 
it: 
For 
this 
is 
the 
usual 
course 
in 
demonstrative 
Sciences, 
and 
the 
reason 
thereof 
is, 
because 
when 
the 
conclusion 
is 
true, 
by 
help 
of 
resolutive 
Method, 
one 
may 
hit 
upon 
some 
proposition 
before 
demonstrated, 
or 
come 
to 
some 
principle 
known 
per 
se; 
but 
if 
the 
conclusion 
be 
false, 
a 
man 
may 
proceed 
in 
infinitum, 
and 
never 
meet 
with 
any 
truth 
already 
known; 
but 
very 
oft 
he 
shall

Pythagoras 
offered 
an 
Hecatomb 
for 
a 
Geometrical 
demonstration 
which 
he 
found. 
Nor 
need 
you 
question 
but 
that 
Pythagoras 
along 
time 
before 
he 
found 
the 
demonstration 
for 
which 
he 
offered 
the 
Hecatomb, 
had 
been 
certain, 
that 
the 
square 
of 
the 
side 
subtending 
the 
right 
angle 
in 
a 
rectangle 
triangle, 
was 
equal 
to 
the 
square 
of 
the 
other 
two 
sides: 
and 
the 
certainty 
of 
the 
conclusion 
conduced 
not 
a 
little 
to 
the 
investigating 
of 
the 
demonstration, 
understanding 
me 
alwayes 
to 
mean 
in 
demonstrative 
Sciences. 
But 
what 
ever 
was 
the 
method 
of 
Aristotle, 
and 
whether 
his 
arguing 
à 
priori 
preceded 
sense 
à 
posteriori, 
or 
the 
contrary; 
it 
sufficeth 
that 
the 
same 
Aristotle 
preferreth 
(as 
hath 
been 
oft 
said) 
sensible 
experiments 
before 
all 
discourses; 
besides, 
as 
to 
the 
Arguments 
à 
priori 
their 
force 
hath 
been 
already 
examined. 
Now 
returning 
to 
my 
purposed 
matter, 
Isay, 
that 
thethingsinour 
times 
discovered 
in 
the 
Heavens, 
are, 
and 
have 
been 
such, 
that 
they 
may 
give 
absolute 



satisfaction 
to 
all 
Philosophers; 
forasmuch 
as 
in 
the 
particular 
bodies, 
and 
in 
the 
universal 
expansion 
of 
Heaven, 
there 
have 
been, 
and 
are 
continually, 
seen 
just 
such 
accidents 
as 
we 
call 
generations 
and 
corruptions, 
being 
that 
excellent 
Astronomers 
have 
observed 
many 
Comets 
generated 
and 
dissolved 
in 
parts 
higher 
than 
the 
Lunar 
Orb, 
besides 
the 
two 
new 
Stars, 
Anno 
1572, 
New 
stars 
discovered 
in 
Heaven. 
and 
Anno 
1604, 
without 
contradiction 
much 
higher 
than 
all 
the 
Planets; 
and 
in 
the 
face 
of 
the 
Sun 
it 
self, 
by 
help 
of 
the 
Telescope, 
Spots 
generate 
and 
dissolve 
in 
the 
face 
of 
the 
Sun. 
certain 
dense 
and 
obscure 
substances, 
in 
semblance 
very 
like 
to 
the 
foggs 
about 
the 
Earth, 
are 
seen 
to 
be 
produced 
and 
dissolved; 
and 
many 
of 
these 
are 
so 
vast, 
that 
they 
far 
exceed 
not 
only 
the 
Mediterranian 
Streight, 
but 
all 
Affrica 
and 
Asia 
also. 
Solar 
spots 
are 
bigger 
than 
all 
Asia 
and 
Affrick. 
Now 
if 
Aristotle 
had 
seenthesethings,whatthinkyouhewouldhavesaid,anddoneSimplicius? 


SIMPL. 


I 
know 
not 
what 
Aristotle 
would 
have 
done 
or 
said, 
that 
was 
the 
great 
Master 
of 
all 
the 
Sciences, 
but 
yet 
I 
know 
in 
part, 
what 
his 
Sectators 
do 
and 
say, 
and 
ought 
to 
do 
and 
say, 
unlesse 
they 
would 
deprive 
themselves 
of 
their 
guide, 
leader, 
and 
Prince 
in 
Philosophy. 
As 
to 
the 
Comets, 
are 
not 
those 
Modern 
Astronomers, 
who 
would 
make 
them 
Coelestial, 
convinced 
by 
theAstronomers 
confuted 
by 
Anti-Tycho. 
Anti-Tycho, 
yea, 
and 
overcome 
with 
their 
own 
weapons, 
I 
mean 
by 
way 
of 
Paralaxes 
and 
Calculations, 
every 
way 
tryed, 
concluding 
at 
the 
last 
in 
favour 
of 
Aristotle, 
that 
they 
are 
all 
Elementary? 
And 
this 
being 
overthrown, 
which 
was 
as 
it 
were 
their 
foundation, 
have 
these 
Novellists 
any 
thing 
more 
wherewith 
to 
maintain 
their 
assertion? 


SALV. 


Hold 
a 
little, 
good 
Simplicius, 
this 
modern 
Author, 
what 
saith 
he 
to 
the 
new 
Stars, 
Anno 
1572, 
and 
1604, 
and 
to 
the 
Solar 
spots? 
for 
as 
to 
the 
Comets, 
I 
for 
my 
own 
particular 
little 
care 
to 
make 
them 
generated 
under 
or 
above 
the 
Moon; 
nor 
did 
I 
ever 
put 
much 
stresse 
on 
the 
loquacity 
of 
Tycho; 
nor 
am 
I 
hard 
to 
believe 
that 
their 
matter 
is 
Elementary, 
and 
that 
they 
may 
elevate 
(sublimate) 
themselves 
at 
their 
pleasure, 
without 
meeting 
with 
any 
obstacle 
from 
the 
impenetrability 
of 
the 
Peripatetick 
Heaven, 
which 
I 
hold 
to 
be 
far 
more 
thin, 
yielding, 
and 
subtil 
than 
our 
Air; 
and 
as 
to 
the 
calculations 
of 
the 



Parallaxes, 
first, 
the 
uncertainty 
whether 
Comets 
are 
subject 
to 
such 
accidents, 
and 
next, 
the 
inconstancy 
of 
the 
observations, 
upon 
which 
the 
computations 
are 
made, 
make 
me 
equally 
suspect 
both 
those 
opinions: 
Anti-
Tycho 
wresteth 
Astronomical 
observations 
to 
his 
own 
purpose. 
and 
the 
rather, 
for 
that 
I 
see 
him 
you 
call 
Anti-Tycho, 
sometimes 
stretch 
to 
his 
purpose,or 
elsereject 
those 
observations 
whichinterferewithhisdesign. 


SIMPL. 


As 
to 
the 
new 
Stars, 
Anti-Tycho 
extricates 
himself 
finely 
in 
three 
or 
four 
words; 
saying, 
That 
those 
modern 
new 
Stars 
are 
no 
certain 
parts 
of 
the 
Coelestial 
bodies, 
and 
that 
the 
adversaries, 
if 
they 
will 
prove 
alteration 
and 
generation 
in 
those 
superior 
bodies, 
must 
shew 
some 
mutations 
that 
have 
been 
made 
in 
the 
Stars 
described 
so 
many 
ages 
past, 
of 
which 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
but 
that 
they 
be 
Coelestial 
bodies, 
which 
they 
can 
never 
be 
able 
to 
do: 
Next, 
as 
to 
those 
matters 
which 
some 
affirm, 
to 
generate 
and 
dissipate 
in 
the 
face 
of 
the 
Sun, 
he 
makes 
no 
mention 
thereof; 
wherefore 
I 
conclude, 
that 
he 
believed 
them 
fictious, 
or 
the 
illusions 
of 
the 
Tube, 
or 
at 
most, 
some 
petty 
effects 
caused 
by 
the 
Air, 
and 
in 
brief, 
any 
thing 
rather 
than 
matters 
Coelestial. 


SALV. 


But 
you, 
Simplicius, 
what 
answer 
could 
you 
give 
to 
the 
opposition 
of 
these 
importunate 
spots 
which 
are 
started 
up 
to 
disturb 
the 
Heavens, 
and 
more 
than 
that, 
the 
Peripatetick 
Philosophy? 
It 
cannot 
be 
but 
that 
you, 
who 
are 
so 
resolute 
a 
Champion 
of 
it, 
have 
found 
some 
reply 
or 
solution 
for 
the 
same, 
of 
which 
yououghtnotto 
deprive 
us. 


SIMPL. 


I 
have 
heard 
sundry 
opinions 
about 
this 
particular. 
One 
saith: 
‘They 
are 
Stars

Mercury,

about 
the

and 
in 
passing 
under 
it, 
represent 
themselves 
to 
us 
obscure; 
and 
for 
that 
they 
are 
many, 
they 
oft 
happen 
to 
aggregate 
their 
parts 
together, 
and 
afterwards 
seperate 
again’. 
Others 
believe 
them 
to 
be 
äerial 
impressions; 
others, 
the 
illusions 
of 
the 
chrystals; 
and 
others, 
other 
things: 
But 
I 
incline 
to 
think, 
yea 
am 
verily 
perswaded, 
That 



they 
are 
an 
aggregate 
of 
many 
several 
concurrent 
among 
themselves. 
And 
the 
those 
spots 
one 
may 
number 
ten 
or 
m 
irregular 
figures, 
and 
seem 
to 
us

This 
invention 
is 
truly 
ingenious; 
and 
that 
which 
hath 
not 
been 
done 
already, 
may 
be 
done 
in 
time 
to 
come; 
and 
if 
there 
have 
been

other

which 
have 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the

these 
may 
be 
produced 
also; 
in 
the 
mean 
time, 
that 
I 
may 
not 
prevent 
any 
one, 
I 
will 
suppresse 
the 
answer 
which 
might 
be 
given, 
and 
onely 
for 
this 
time 
betake 
my 
self 
to 
satisfie 
the 
objections 
brought 
by 
Simplicius. 
I 
say 
therefore, 
that 
this 
reason 
of 
yours 
is 
too 
general, 
and 
as 
you 
apply 
it 
not 
to 
all 
the 
appearances 
one 
by 
one; 
which 
are 
seen 
in 
the 
Moon, 
and 
for 
which 
my 
self 
and 
others 
are 
induced 
to 
hold 
it 
mountainous, 
I 
believe 
you 
will 
not 
find 
any 
one 
that 
will 
be 
satisfied 
with 
such 
a 
doctrine; 
nor 
can 
I 
think, 
that 
either 
you, 
or 
the 
Author 
himself, 
find 
in 
it 
any 
greater 
quietude, 
The 
apparent 
unevennesses 
of 
the 
Moon 
cannot 
be 
imitated 
by 
way 
of 
more 
and 
less 
opacity 
& 
perspicuity. 
than 
in 
any 
other 
thing 
wide 
from 
the 
purpose. 
Of 
the 
very 
many 
several 
appearances 
which 
are 
seen 
night 
by 
night 
in 
the 
course 
of 
Moon, 
you 
cannot 
imitate 
so 
much 
as 
one, 
by 
making 
a 
Ball 
at 
your 
choice, 
more 
or 
less 
opacous 
and 
perspicuous, 
and 
that 
is 
of 
a 
polite 
superficies; 
The 
various 
aspects 
of 
the 
Moon, 
imitable 
with 
any 
opacous 
matter. 
whereas 
on 
the 
contrary, 
one 
may 
make 
Balls 
of 
any 
solid 
matter 
whatsoever, 
thatis 
not 
transparent, 
whichonely 
with 
eminencies 
and 
cavities, 
and 
by 
receiving 
the 
illumination 
several 
ways, 
shall 
represent 
the 
same 
appearances 
and 
mutations 
to 
an 
hair, 
Various 
appearances 
from 
which 
the 
Moons 
montuosity 
is 
argued. 
which 
from 
hour 
to 
hour 
are 
discovered 
in 
the 
Moon. 
In 
them 
you 
shall 
see 
the 
ledges 
of 
Hills 
exposed 
to 
the 
Suns 
light, 
to 
be 
very 
shining, 
and 
afterthem 
theprojectionsof 
their 
shadows 
very 
obscure; 
you 
shall 
see 
them 
greater 
and 
less, 
according 
as 
the 
said 
eminencies 
shall 
be 
more 
or 
less 
distant 
from 
the 
confines 
which 
distinguish 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Moon 
illuminated, 
from 
the 
obscure: 
you 
shall 
see 
the 
same 
term 
and 
confine, 
not 
equally 
distended, 
as 
it 
would 
be 
if 
the 
Ball 
were 
polish’d, 
but 
craggie 
and 
rugged. 
You 
shall 
see 
beyond 
the 
same 
term, 
in 
the 
dark 
parts 
of 
the 
Moon 
many 
bright 
prominencies, 
and 
distinct 
from 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
illuminations: 
you 
shall 
see 
the 
shadows 
aforesaid, 
according 
as 
the 
illumination 
gradually 
riseth, 
to 
deminish 
by 
degrees, 
till 
they 
wholly 
disappear; 
nor 
are 
there 
any 
of 
them 
to 
be 
seen 
when 
the 
whole 
Hemisphere 
is 
enlightned. 
Again 
on 
the 
contrary, 
in 
the 
lights 
passage 
towards 
the 
other 
Hemisphere 
of 
the 
Moon, 
you 
shall 
again 
observe 
the 
same 
eminencies 
that 
were 
marked, 
and 
you 
shall 
see 
the 
projections 
of 
their 
shadows 
to 
be 
made 
a 
contrary 
way, 
and 
to 
decrease 
by 
degrees: 
of 
which 
things, 
once 
more 
I 
say, 



you 
cannot 
shew 
me 
so 
much 
as 
one 
in 
yours 
that 
are 
opacous 
and 
perspicuous. 


SAGR. 


One 
of 
them 
certainly 
he 
may 
imitate, 
namely, 
that 
of 
the 
Full-Moon, 
when 
by 
reason 
of 
its 
being 
all 
illuminated, 
there 
is 
not 
to 
be 
seen 
either 
shadow, 
or 
other 
thing, 
which 
receiveth 
any 
alteration 
from 
its 
eminencies 
and 
cavities. 
But 
I 
beseech 
you, 
Salviatus, 
let 
us 
spend 
no 
more 
time 
on 
this 
Argument, 
for 
a 
person 
that 
hath 
had 
but 
the 
patience 
to 
make 
observation 
of 
but 
one 
or 
two 
Lunations, 
and 
is 
not 
satisfied 
with 
this 
most 
sensible 
truth, 
may 
well 
be 
adjudged 
void 
of 
all 
judgment; 
and 
upon 
such 
why 
should 
we 
throw 
away 
ourtimeandbreathin 
vain? 


SIMPL. 


I 
must 
confess 
I 
have 
not 
made 
the 
observations, 
for 
that 
I 
never 
had 
so 
much 
curiosity, 
or 
the 
Instruments 
proper 
for 
the 
business; 
but 
I 
will 
not 
fail 
to 
do 
it. 
In 
the 
mean 
time, 
we 
may 
leave 
this 
question 
in 
suspense, 
and 
pass 
to 
that 
point 
which 
follows, 
producing 
the 
motives 
inducing 
you 
to 
think 
that 
the 
Earth 
may 
reflect 
the 
light 
of 
the 
Sun 
no 
less 
forceably 
than 
the 
Moon, 
for 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
so 
obscure 
and 
opacous, 
that 
I 
judg 
such 
an 
effect 
altogether 
impossible. 


SALV. 


The 
cause 
for 
which 
you 
repute 
the 
Earth 
unapt 
for 
illumination, 
may 
rather 
evince 
the 
contrary: 
And 
would 
it 
not 
be 
strange, 
Simplicius, 
if 
I 
should

SIMPL. 


Whether 
I 
argue 
well 
or 
ill, 
it 
may 
be, 
that 
you 
may 
better 
understand 
the 
same 
than 
I; 
but 
be 
it 
ill 
or 
well 
that 
I 
discourse, 
I 
shall 
never 
believe 
that 
you 
can 
penetratewhatI 
mean 
betterthan 
Imyself. 


SALV. 



Well, 
I 
will 
make 
you 
believe 
the 
same 
presently. 
Tell 
me 
a 
little, 
when 
the 
Moon 
is 
near 
the 
Full, 
so 
that 
it 
may 
be 
seen 
by 
day, 
and 
also 
at 
midnight, 
at 
whatdoyouthinkitmoresplendid, 
byday 
orbynight? 


SIMPL. 


By 
night, 
The 
Moon 
appears 
brighter 
by 
night 
than 
by 
day. 
without 
all 
comparison. 
And 
methinks 
the 
Moon 
resembleth 
that 
pillar 
of 
Clouds 
and 
pillar 
of 
Fire, 
which 
guided 
the 
Israelites; 
which 
at 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
Sun, 
appeared 
like 
a 
Cloud, 
but 
in 
the 
night 
was 
very 
glorious. 
Thus 
I 
have 
by 
day 
observed 
the 
Moon 
amidst 
certain 
small 
Clouds, 
The 
Moon 
beheld 
in 
the 
day 
time, 
is 
like 
to 
a 
little 
cloud. 
just 
as 
if 
one 
of 
them 
had 
been 
coloured 
white, 
butbynightitshineswithmuch 
splendor. 


SALV. 


So 
that 
if 
you 
had 
never 
happened 
to 
see 
the 
Moon, 
save 
onely 
in 
the 
day 
time,youwouldnothavethoughtit 
more 
shiningthanoneofthoseClouds. 


SIMPL. 


Iverily 
believeIshouldnot. 


SALV. 


Tell 
me 
now; 
do 
you 
believe 
that 
the 
Moon 
is 
really 
more 
shining 
in 
the 
night 
thanday,or 
thatby 
some 
accidentit 
seemethso? 


SIMPL. 


I 
am 
of 
opinion, 
that 
it 
resplends 
in 
it 
self 
as 
much 
in 
the 
day 
as 
night, 
but 
that 
its 
light 
appears 
greater 
by 
night, 
because 
we 
behold 
it 
in 
the 
dark 
mantle 
of 
Heaven; 
and 
in 
the 
day 
time, 
the 
whole 
Atmosphere 
being 
very 
clear, 
so 
that 
shelittleexceedethitinlustre,sheseems 
tous 
muchlessbright. 


SALV. 


Now 
tell 
me; 
have 
you 
ever 
at 
midnight 
seen 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
illuminatedbytheSun? 



SIMPL. 


This 
seemeth 
to 
me 
a 
question 
not 
to 
be 
ask’d, 
unless 
in 
jest, 
or 
of 
some 
personknowntobe 
altogethervoidofsense. 


SALV. 


No, 
no; 
I 
esteem 
you 
to 
be 
a 
very 
rational 
man, 
and 
do 
ask 
the 
question 
seriously; 
and 
therefore 
answer 
me: 
and 
if 
afterwards 
you 
shall 
think 
that 
I 
speak 
impertinently, 
I 
will 
be 
content 
to 
be 
the 
senseless 
man: 
for 
he 
is 
much 
morea 
foolwho 
interrogates 
simply,than 
hetowhomthequestion 
isput. 


SIMPL. 


If 
then 
you 
do 
not 
think 
me 
altogether 
simple, 
take 
it 
for 
granted 
that 
I 
have 
answered 
you 
already, 
and 
said, 
that 
it 
is 
impossible, 
that 
one 
that 
is 
upon 
the 
Earth, 
as 
we 
are, 
should 
see 
by 
night 
that 
part 
of 
the 
Earth 
where 
it 
is 
day, 
namely,thatisilluminated 
bythe 
Sun. 


SALV. 


Therefore 
you 
have 
never 
seen 
the 
Earth 
enlightned, 
save 
onely 
by 
day; 
but 
you 
see 
the 
Moon 
to 
shine 
also 
in 
the 
dead 
of 
night. 
And 
this 
is 
the 
cause, 
Simplicius, 
which 
makes 
you 
believe 
that 
the 
Earth 
doth 
not 
shine 
like 
the 
Moon; 
but 
if 
you 
could 
see 
the 
Earth 
illuminated, 
whilst 
you 
were 
in 
some 
dark 
place, 
like 
our 
night, 
you 
would 
see 
it 
shine 
brighter 
than 
the 
Moon. 
Now 
if 
you 
desire 
that 
the 
comparison 
may 
proceed 
well, 
you 
must 
compare 
the 
light 
of 
the 
Earth, 
with 
that 
of 
the 
Moon 
seen 
in 
the 
day 
time, 
and 
not 
with 
the 
same 
by 
night: 
for 
it 
is 
not 
in 
our 
power 
to 
see 
the 
Earth 
illuminated, 
saveonelyin 
the 
day. 
Isit 
notso? 


SIMPL. 


Soitoughttobe. 


SALV. 


And 
forasmuch 
as 
you 
your 
self 
have 
already 
confessed 
to 
have 
seen 
the 
Moon 
by 
day 
among 
some 
little 
white 
Clouds, 
and 
very 
nearly, 
as 
to 
its 



aspect, 
resembling 
one 
of 
them; 
you 
did 
thereby 
grant, 
Clouds 
are 
no 
less 
apt 
than 
the 
Moon 
to 
be 
illuminated 
by 
the 
Sun. 
that 
those 
Clouds, 
which 
yet 
are 
Elementary 
matters, 
are 
as 
apt 
to 
receive 
illumination, 
as 
the 
Moon, 
yea 
more, 
if 
you 
will 
but 
call 
to 
mind 
that 
you 
have 
sometimes 
seen 
some 
Clouds 
of 
vast 
greatness, 
and 
as 
perfect 
white 
as 
the 
Snow; 
and 
there 
is 
no 
question, 
but 
that 
if 
such 
a 
Cloud 
could 
be 
continued 
so 
luminous 
in 
the 
deep 
of 
night, 
it 
would 
illuminate 
the 
places 
near 
about 
it, 
more 
than 
an 
hundred 
Moons. 
If 
therefore 
we 
wereassured 
that 
theEarthisilluminated 
by 
the 
Sun,likeone 
of 
those 
Clouds, 
it 
would 
be 
undubitable, 
but 
that 
it 
would 
be 
no 
less 
shining 
than 
the 
Moon. 
But 
of 
this 
there 
is 
no 
question 
to 
be 
made, 
in 
regard 
we 
see 
thosevery 
Clouds 
in 
the 
absenceof 
theSun, 
toremain 
by 
night,asobscure 
as 
the 
Earth: 
and 
that 
which 
is 
more, 
there 
is 
not 
any 
one 
of 
us, 
but 
hath 
seen 
many 
times 
some 
such 
Clouds 
low, 
and 
far 
off, 
and 
questioned 
whether 
they 
were 
Clouds 
or 
Mountains: 
an 
evident 
sign 
that 
the 
Mountains 
are 
no 
less 
luminous 
than 
those 
Clouds. 
A 
wall 
illuminated 
by 
the 
Sun, 
compared 
to 
the 
Moonshinethnolessthanit. 


SAGR. 


But 
what 
needs 
more 
discourse? 
See 
yonder 
the 
Moon 
is 
risen, 
and 
more 
than 
half 
of 
it 
illuminated; 
see 
there 
that 
wall, 
on 
which 
the 
Sun 
shineth; 
retire 
a 
little 
this 
way, 
so 
that 
you 
see 
the 
Moon 
sideways 
with 
the 
wall: 
look 
now; 
which 
of 
them 
shews 
more 
lucid? 
Do 
not 
you 
see, 
that 
if 
there 
is 
any 
advantage, 
the 
wall 
hath 
it? 
The 
Sun 
shineth 
on 
that 
wall; 
from 
thence 
it 
is 
reverberated 
upon 
the 
wall 
of 
the 
Hall, 
The 
third 
reflection 
of 
a 
Wall 
illuminates 
more 
than 
the 
first 
of 
the 
Moon. 
from 
thence 
it’s 
reflected 
upon 
that 
chamber, 
so 
that 
it 
falls 
on 
it 
at 
the 
third 
reflection: 
and 
I 
am 
very 
certain, 
that 
there 
is 
in 
that 
place 
more 
light, 
than 
if 
the 
Moons 
light 
had 
directly 
faln 
uponit. 


SIMPL. 


But 
this 
I 
cannot 
believe; 
for 
the 
illumination 
of 
the 
Moon, 
especially 
when 
it 
is 
atthefull,isvery 
great. 


SAGR. 



It 
seemeth 
great 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
circumjacent 
dark 
places; 
The 
light 
of 
the 
Moon 
weaker 
than 
that 
of 
the 
twilight. 
but 
absolutely 
it 
is 
not 
much, 
and 
is 
less 
than 
that 
of 
the 
twilight 
half 
an 
hour 
after 
the 
Sun 
is 
set; 
which 
is 
manifest, 
because 
you 
see 
not 
the 
shadows 
of 
the 
bodies 
illuminated 
by 
the 
Moon 
till 
then, 
to 
begin 
to 
be 
distinguished 
on 
the 
Earth. 
Whether, 
again, 
that 
third 
reflection 
upon 
that 
chamber, 
illuminates 
more 
than 
the 
first 
of 
the 
Moon, 
may 
be 
known 
by 
going 
thether, 
and 
reading 
a 
Book, 
and 
afterwards 
standing 
there 
in 
the 
night 
by 
the 
Moons 
light, 
which 
will 
shew 
by 
which 
of 
them 
lights 
one 
may 
read 
more 
or 
less 
plainly, 
but 
I 
believe 
without 
further 
tryal,thatone 
shouldseeless

SALV. 


Now, 
Simplicius, 
(if 
haply 
you 
be 
satisfied) 
you 
may 
conceive, 
as 
you 
your 
self 
know 
very 
well, 
that 
the 
Earth 
doth 
shine 
no 
less 
than 
the 
Moon; 
and 
the 
only 
remembring 
you 
of 
some 
things, 
which 
you 
knew 
of 
your 
self, 
and 
learn’d 
not 
of 
me, 
hath 
assured 
you 
thereof: 
for 
I 
taught 
you 
not 
that 
the 
Moon 
shews 
lighter 
by 
night 
than 
by 
day, 
but 
you 
understood 
it 
of 
your 
self; 
as 
also 
you 
could 
tell 
me 
that 
a 
little 
Cloud 
appeareth 
as 
lucid 
as 
the 
Moon: 
you 
knew 
also, 
that 
the 
illumination 
of 
the 
Earth 
cannot 
be 
seen 
by 
night; 
and 
in 
a 
word, 
you 
knew 
all 
this, 
without 
knowing 
that 
you 
knew 
it. 
So 
that 
you 
have 
no 
reason 
to 
be 
scrupulous 
of 
granting, 
that 
the 
dark 
part 
of 
the 
Earth 
may 
illuminate 
the 
dark 
part 
of 
the 
Moon, 
with 
no 
less 
a 
light 
than 
that 
wherewith 
the 
Moon 
illuminates 
the 
obscurities 
of 
the 
night, 
yea 
rather 
so 
muchthegreater,inasmuchas 
theEarthis 
fortytimes 
biggerthan 
theMoon. 


SIMPL. 


I 
must 
confess 
that 
I 
did 
believe, 
that 
that 
secondary 
light 
had 
been 
the 
naturallightofthe 
Moon. 


SALV. 


And 
this 
also 
you 
know 
of 
your 
self, 
and 
perceive 
not 
that 
you 
know 
it. 
Tell 
me, 
do 
not 
you 
know 
without 
teaching, 
that 
the 
Moon 
shews 
it 
self 
more 
bright 
by 
night 
than 
by 
day, 
Lum 
nous 
bodies 
appear 
the 
brighter 
in 
an 
obscurer 
ambient. 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
obscurity 
of 
the 
space 
of 
the 
ambient? 
and 



confequently, 
do 
you 
not 
know 
in 
genere, 
that 
every 
bright 
body 
shews 
the 
clearer,byhowmuchtheambientisobscurer? 
SIMPL. 
ThisIknowverywell. 


SALV. 
When 
the 
Moon 
is 
horned, 
and 
that 
secondary 
light 
seemeth 
to 
you 
very 
bright, 
is 
it 
not 
ever 
nigh 
the 
Sun, 
and 
consequently, 
in 
the 
light 
of 
the 
crepusculum,(twilight?) 


SIMPL. 
It 
is 
so; 
and 
I 
have 
oftentimes 
wish’d 
that 
the 
Air 
would 
grow 
thicker, 
that 
I 


might 
be 
able 
to 
see 
that 
same 
light 
more 
plainly; 
but 
it 
ever 
disappeared 
beforedark 
night. 
SALV. 
You 
know 
then 
very 
certainly, 
that 
in 
the 
depth 
of 
night, 
that 
light 
would 
be 


moreconspicuous. 
SIMPL. 
I 
do 
so; 
and 
also 
more 
than 
that, 
if 
one 
could 
but 
take 
away 
the 
great 
light 
of 


the 
crescent 
illuminated 
by 
the 
Sun, 
the 
presence 
of 
which 
much 
obscureth 
theotherlesser. 


SALV. 
Why, 
doth 
it 
not 
sometimes 
come 
to 
pass, 
that 
one 
may 
in 
a 
very 
dark 
night 
seethe 
wholeface 
oftheMoon,withoutbeingatallilluminatedby 
the 
Sun? 


SIMPL. 
I 
know 
not 
whether 
this 
ever 
happeneth, 
save 
onely 
in 
the 
total 
Ecclipses 
of 
theMoon. 



SALV. 


Why, 
at 
that 
time 
this 
its 
light 
would 
appear 
very 
clear, 
being 
in 
a 
most 
obscure 
medium, 
and 
not 
darkned 
by 
the 
clarity 
of 
the 
luminous 
crescents: 
butinthatposition,how 
lightdid 
itappear 
toyou? 


SIMPL. 


I 
have 
sometimes 
seen 
it 
of 
the 
colour 
of 
brass, 
and 
a 
little 
whitish; 
but 
at 
othertimesithathbeensoobscure, 
thatIhavewhollylostthesightof

SALV. 


How 
then 
can 
that 
light 
be 
so 
natural, 
which 
you 
see 
so 
cleer 
in 
the 
close 
of 
the 
twilight, 
notwithstanding 
the 
impediment 
of 
the 
great 
and 
contiguous 
splendor 
of 
the 
crescents; 
and 
which 
again, 
in 
the 
more 
obscure 
time 
of 
night, 
allotherlightremoved,appearsnotatall? 


SIMPL. 


I 
have 
heard 
of 
some 
that 
believed 
that 
same 
light 
to 
be 
participated 
to 
these 
crescents 
from 
the 
other 
Stars, 
and 
in 
particular 
from 
Venus, 
the 
Moons 
neighbour. 


SALV. 


And 
this 
likewise 
is 
a 
vanity; 
because 
in 
the 
time 
of 
its 
total 
obscuration, 
it 
ought 
to 
appear 
more 
shining 
than 
ever; 
for 
you 
cannot 
say, 
that 
the 
shadow 
oftheEarthinterceptsthesightofVenus,or 
theotherStars. 
Buttosay 
true,it 
is 
not 
at 
that 
instant 
wholly 
deprived 
thereof, 
for 
that 
the 
Terrestrial 
Hemisphere, 
which 
in 
that 
time 
looketh 
towards 
the 
Moon, 
is 
that 
where 
it 
is 
night, 
that 
is, 
an 
intire 
privation 
of 
the 
light 
of 
the 
Sun. 
And 
if 
you 
but 
diligently 
observe, 
you 
will 
very 
sensibly 
perceive, 
that 
like 
as 
the 
Moon, 
when 
it 
is 
sharp-horned, 
doth 
give 
very 
little 
light 
to 
the 
Earth; 
and 
according 
as 
in 
her 
the 
parts 
illuminated 
by 
the 
Suns 
light 
do 
encrease: 
so 
likewise 
the 
splendor 
to 
our 
seeming 
encreaseth, 
which 
from 
her 
is 
reflected 
towards 
us; 
thus 
the 
Moon, 
whilst 
it 
is 
sharp-forked, 
and 
that 
by 
being 
between 
the 
Sun 
and 
the 
Earth, 
it 
discovereth 
a 
very 
great 
part 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Hemisphere 



illuminated, 
appeareth 
very 
clear: 
and 
departing 
from 
the 
Sun, 
and 
passing 
towards 
theBy 
the 
Moons 
two 
Quadratures 
you 
are 
to 
understand 
its 
first 
and 
last 
quarters, 
as 
Astrologers 
call 
them▪ 
Quadrature, 
you 
may 
see 
the 
said 
light 
by 
degrees 
to 
grow 
dim; 
and 
after 
the 
Quadrature, 
the 
same 
appears 
very 
weak, 
because 
it 
continually 
loseth 
more 
and 
more 
of 
the 
view 
of 
the 
luminous 
part 
of 
the 
Earth: 
and 
yet 
it 
should 
succeed 
quite 
contrary, 
if 
that 
light 
were 
its 
own, 
or 
communicated 
to 
it 
from 
the 
Stars; 
for 
then 
we 
should

Stay 
a 
little; 
for 
I 
just 
now 
remember, 
that 
I 
have 
read 
in 
a 
little 
modern 
tract, 
full 
of 
many 
novelties; 
‘That 
this 
secondary 
light 
is 
not 
derived 
from 
the 
Stars, 
nor 
innate 
in 
the 
Moon, 
and 
least 
of 
all 
communicated 
by 
the 
Earth, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
received 
from 
the 
same 
illumination 
of 
the 
Sun, 
The 
secondary 
light 
of 
the 
Moon 
caused 
by 
the 
Sun, 
according 
to 
some. 
which, 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
Lunar 
Globe 
being 
somewhat 
transparent, 
penetrateth 
thorow 
all 
its 
body; 
but 
more 
livelily 
illuminateth 
the 
superficies 
of 
the 
Hemisphere 
exposed 
to 
the 
rays 
of 
the 
Sun▪ 
and 
its 
profundity 
imbuing, 
and 
(as 
I 
may 
say) 
swallowing 
that 
light, 
afterthe 
manner 
of 
a 
cloud 
orchrystal, 
transmits 
it, 
and 
renders 
it 
visibly 
lucid. 
And 
this 
(if 
I 
remember 
aright) 
he 
proveth 
by 
Authority, 
Experience 
and 
Reason; 
citing 
Cleomedes, 
Vitellion, 
Macrobius, 
and 
a 
certain 
other 
modern 
Author: 
and 
adding, 
That 
it 
is 
seen 
by 
experience 
to 
shine 
most 
in 
the 
days 
nearest 
the 
Conjunction, 
that 
is, 
when 
it 
is 
horned, 
and 
is 
chiefly 
bright 
about 
its 
limb. 
And 
he 
farther 
writes, 
That 
in 
the 
Solar 
Ecclipses, 
when 
it 
is 
under 
the 
Discus 
of 
the 
Sun, 
it 
may 
be 
seen 
translucid, 
and 
more 
especially 
towards 
its 
utmost 
Circle. 
And 
in 
the 
next 
place, 
for 
Arguments, 
as 
I 
think, 
he 
saith, 
That 
it 
not 
being 
able 
to 
derive 
that 
light 
either 
from 
the 
Earth, 
or 
from 
the 
Stars, 
or 
from 
it 
self, 
it 
necessarily 
follows, 
that 
it 
cometh 
from 
the 
Sun. 
Besides 
that, 
if 
you 
do 
but 
grant 
this 
supposition, 
one 
may 
easily 
give 
convenient 
reasons 
for 
all 
the 
particulars 
that 
occur. 
For 
the 
reason 
why 
that 
secundary 
light 
shews 
more 
lively 
towards 
the 
outmost 
limb, 
is, 
the 
shortness 
of 
the 
space 
that 
the 
Suns 
rays 
hath 
to 
penetrate, 
in 
regard 
that 
of 
the 
lines 
which 
pass 
through 
a 
circle, 
the 
greatest 
is 
that 
which 
passeth 
through 
the 
centre, 
and 
of 
the 
rest, 
those 
which 
are 
farthest 
from 
it, 
are 
always 
less 
than 
those 
that 
are 
nearer. 
From 
the 
same 
principle, 
he 
saith, 
may 
be 
shewn 
why 
the 
said 
light 
doth 
not 
much 
diminish. 
And 
lastly, 
by 
this 



way 
thecauseis 
assigned 
whence 
it 
comes,thatthatsame 
moreshining 
circle 
about 
the 
utmost 
edge 
of 
the 
Moon, 
is 
seen 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Solar 
Ecclipse, 
in 
that 
part 
which 
lyeth 
just 
under 
the 
Discus 
of 
the 
Sun, 
but 
not 
in 
that 
which 
is 
beside 
the 
Discus: 
which 
happeneth 
because 
the 
rays 
of 
the 
Sun 
pass 
directly 
to 
our 
eye, 
through 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Moon 
underneath: 
but 
as 
for 
the 
partswhich 
are 
besides 
it,theyfall 
besides 
the 
eye.’

If 
this 
Philosopher 
had 
been 
the 
first 
Author 
of 
this 
opinion, 
I 
would 
not 
wonder 
that 
he 
should 
be 
so 
affectionate 
to 
it, 
as 
to 
have 
received 
it 
for 
truth; 
but 
borrowing 
it 
from 
others, 
I 
cannot 
find 
any 
reason 
sufficient 
to 
excuse 
him 
for 
not 
perceiving 
it 
fallacies; 
and 
especially 
after 
he 
had 
heard 
the 
true 
cause 
of 
that 
effect, 
and 
had 
it 
in 
his 
power 
to 
satisfie 
himself 
by 
a 
thousand 
experiments, 
and 
manifest 
circumstances, 
that 
the 
same 
proceeded 
from 
the 
reflection 
of 
the 
Earth, 
and 
from 
nothing 
else: 
and 
the 
more 
this 
speculation 
makes 
something 
to 
be 
desired, 
in 
the 
judgment 
of 
this 
Author, 
and 
of 
all 
those 
who 
give 
no 
credit 
to 
it: 
so 
much 
the 
more 
doth 
their 
not 
having 
understood 
and 
remembred 
it, 
excuse 
those 
more 
recess 
Antients, 
who, 
I 
am 
very 
certain, 
did 
they 
now 
understand 
it, 
would 
without 
the 
least 
repugnance 
admit 
thereof. 
And 
if 
I 
may 
freely 
tell 
you 
what 
I 
think, 
I 
cannot 
believe 
but 
that 
this 
Moderndothin 
his 
heart 
believeit; 
butI 
rather 
think,thatthe 
conceit 
he 
should 
not 
be 
the 
first 
Author 
thereof, 
did 
a 
little 
move 
him 
to 
endeavour 
to 
suppresse 
it, 
or 
to 
disparage 
it 
at 
least 
amongst 
the 
simple, 
whose 
number 
we 
know 
to 
be 
very 
great; 
and 
many 
there 
are,

but 
let 
us 
return 
to 
prove 
to 
Simplicius 
the 
invalidity 
of 
the 
reasons 
of 
his 
modern 
Author, 
in 
which 
there 
are 
several 
falsities, 
inconsequencies, 
The 
secondary 
light 
of 
the 
Mo 
n 
appears 
in 
form 
of 
a 
Ring, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
bright 
in 
the 
extreme 
circumference, 
and 
not 
n 
the 
midst, 
and 
why▪ 
and 
incredible 
Paradoxes. 
And 
first, 
it 
is 
false 
that 
this 
secondary 
light 
is 
clearer 
about 
the 
utmost 
limb 
than 
in 
the 
middle 
parts, 
so 
as 
to 
form, 
as 
it 
were, 
a 
ring 
or 
circle 
more 
bright 
than 
the 
rest 
of 
its 
space 
or 
contence. 
True 
it 
is, 
indeed, 
that 
looking 
on 
the 
Moon 
at 
the 
time 
of 
twilight, 
at 
first 
sight 
there 
is 
the 
resemblance 
of 
such 
a 
circle, 
but 
by 
an 
illusion 
arising 
from 
the 
diversity 
of 
confines 
that 
bound 
the 
Moons 
Discus, 
which 
are 
confused 
by 
means 
of 
this 
secondary 
light; 
forasmuch 
as 
on 
the 
part 
towards 
the 
Sun 
it 
is 
bounded 
by 
the 
lucid 
horns 
of 
the 
Moon, 
and 
on 
the 
other 
part, 
its 
confining 
term 
is 
the 
obscure 
tract 
of 
the 
twilight; 
whose 
relation 
makes 
us 
think 
the 
candor 
of 
the 
Moons 
Discus 
to 
be 
so 
much 
the 
clearer; 
the 
which 
happens 
to 
be 
obfuscated 
in 
the 
opposite 
part, 
by 
the 
greater 
clarity 
of 
the 
crescents; 
but 
if 
this 
modern 
Author 
had 
essaied 
to 
make 
an 
interposition 
between 
the 
eye 
and 
the 
primary 
splendor,

Oh! 
how 
is 
this 
(as 
I 
believed) 
inadvertency 
of 
his, 
changed 
into 
a 
lie, 
bordering 
on 
rashnesse; 
for 
that 
every 
one 
may 
frequently 
make 
proof 
of 
the 
contrary. 
That 
in 
the 
next 
place, 
The 
Moons 
Discus 
in 
a 
solar 
Eclipse 
can 
be 
seen 
onely 
by 
privation. 
at 
the 
Suns 
Eclipse, 
the 
Moons 
Discus 
is 
seen 
otherwayes 
than 
by 
privation, 
I 
much 
doubt, 
and 
specially 
when 
the 
Eclipse 
is 
not 
total, 
as 
those 
must 
necessarily 
have 
been, 
which 
were 
observed 
by 
the 
Author; 
but 
if 
also 
he 
should 
have 
discovered 
somewhat 
of 
light, 
this 
contradicts 
not, 
rather 
favoureth 
our 
opinion; 
for 
that 
at 
such 
a 
time, 
the 
whole 
Terrestrial 
Hemisphere 
illuminated 
by 
the 
Sun, 
is 
opposite 
to 
the 
Moon, 
so 
that 
although 
the 
Moons 
shadow 
doth 
obscure 
a 
part 
thereof, 
yet 
this 
is 
very 
small 
in 
comparison 
of 
that 
which 
remains 
illuminated. 
That 
which 
he 
farther 
adds, 
that 
in 
this 
case, 
the 
part 
of 
the 
limb, 
lying 
under 
the 
Sun,doth 
appear 
very 
lucid,but 
that 
which 
lyeth 
besides 
it, 
notso; 
and 
that 
to 
proceed 
from 
the 
coming 
of 
the 
solar 
rayes 
directly 
through 
that 
part 
to 
the 
eye, 
but 
not 
through 
this, 
is 
really 
one 
of 
those 
fopperies, 
which 
discover 
the 
otherfictions, 
of 
him 
which 
relatesthem: 
For 
if 
it 
berequisiteto 
themaking 
a

visible 
in 
the

Discus, 
that 
the 
rayes 
of 
the 
Sun 
came 
directly 
through 
it 
to 
our 
eyes, 
doth 
not 
this 
pitiful 
Philosopher 
perceive, 
that 
we 
should 
never 
see 
this 
same 
secondary 
light, 
save 
onely 
at 
the 
Eclipse 
of 
the 
Sun? 
And 
if 
a 
part 
onely 
of 
the 
Moon, 
far 
lesse 
than 
half 
a 
degree, 
by 
being 
remote 
from 
the 
Suns 
Discus, 
can 
deflect 
or 
deviate 
the 
rayes 
of 
the 
Sun, 
so 
that 
they 
arrive 
not 
at 
our 
eye; 
what 
shall 
it 
do 
when 
it 
is 
distant 
twenty 
or 
thirty 
degrees, 
as 
it 
is 
at 
its 
first 
apparition? 
and 
what 
course 
shall 
the 
rayes 
of 
the 
Sun 
keep, 
which 
are 
to 
passe 
thorow 
the 
body 
of 
the 
Moon, 
that 
they 
may 
find 
out 
our 
eye?The 
Author 
of 
the 
Book 
of 
conclusions, 
accommodates 
the 
things 
to 
his 
purposes, 
and 
not 
his 
purposes 
to 
the 
things. 
This 
man 
doth 
go 
successively 
considering 
what 
things 
ought 
to 
be, 
that 
they 
may 
serve 
his 
purpose, 
but 
doth 
not 
gradually 
proceed, 
accommodating 
his 
conceits 
to 
the 
things, 
as 
really 
they 
are. 
As 
for 
instance, 
to 
make 
the 
light 
of 
the 
Sun 
capable 
to 
penetrate 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
Moon, 
he 
makes 
her 
in 
part 
diaphanous, 
as 
is 
v. 
g. 
the 
transparence 
of 
a 
cloud, 
or 
crystal: 
but 
I 
know 
not 
what 
he 
would 
think 
of 
such 
a 
transparency, 
in 
case 
the 
solar 
rayes 
were 
to 
passe 
a 
depth 
of 
clouds 
of 
above 
two 
thousand 
miles; 
but 
let 
it 
be 
supposed 
that 
he 
should 
boldly 
answer, 
that 
might 
well 
be 
in 
the 
Coelestial, 
which 
are 
quite 
other 
things 
from 
these 
our 
Elementary, 
impure, 
and 
feculent 
bodies; 
and 
let 
us 
convict 
his 
error 
by 
such 
wayes, 
as 
admit 
him 
no 
reply, 
or 
(to 
say 
better) 
subter-fuge. 
If 
he 
will 
maintain, 
that 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
Moon 
is 



diaphanous, 
he 
must 
say 
that 
it 
is 
so, 
whilest 
that 
the 
rayes 
of 
the 
Sun 
are 
to 
penetrate 
its 
whole 
profundity, 
that 
is, 
more 
than 
two 
thousand 
miles; 
but 
that 
if 
you 
oppose

them 
onely 
one

lesse, 
they 
should 
no

that

did 
suffice 
me 
to 
make 
it, 
I 
being

he 
in

he 
answered 
me, 
that 
in

small 
a

one 
could 
not 
so 
well 
perceive 
the 
operation; 
whereupon 
I 
turn’d

going, 
telling

the 
Moon 
themselves 
are 
a 
proof 
thereof, 
which 
percussed 
on 
one 
side 
of 
the 
Sun, 
do 
cast 
on 
the 
contrary 
side 
very 
dark 
shadows,terminate, 
andmore 
distinctby 
much, 
than 
the 
shadowsofours; 
but 
had 
these 
mountains 
been 
diaphanous, 
we 
could 
never 
have 
come 
to 
the 
knowledg 
of 
any 
unevennesse 
in 
the 
superficies 
of 
the 
Moon, 
not 
have 
seen 
those 
luminous 
montuosities 
distinguished 
by 
the 
terms 
which 
separate 
the 
lucid 
parts 
from 
the 
dark: 
much 
lesse, 
should 
we 
see 
this 
same 
term 
so 
distinct, 
if 
it 
were 
true, 
that 
the 
Suns 
light 
did 
penetrate 
the 
whole 
thicknesse 
of 
the 
Moon; 
yea 
rather, 
according 
to 
the 
Authors 
own 
words, 
we 
should 
of 
necessity 
discern 
the 
passage, 
and 
confine, 
between 
the 
part 
of 
the 
Sun 
seen, 
andthepartnotseen,tobeveryconfused,andmixtwithlightand 
darknesse; 
for 
that 
that 
matter 
which 
admits 
the 
passage 
of 
the 
Suns 
rayes 
thorow 
a 
space 
of 
two 
thousand 
miles, 
must 
needs 
be 
so 
transparent, 
that 
it 
would 
very 



weakly 
resist 
them 
in 
a 
hundredth, 
or 
lesser 
part 
of 
that 
thicknesse; 
neverthelesse, 
the 
term 
which 
separateth 
the 
part 
illuminated 
from 
the 
obscure, 
is 
incident, 
and 
as 
distinct, 
as 
white 
is 
distinct 
from 
black; 
and 
especially 
where 
the 
Section 
passeth 
through 
the 
part 
of 
the 
Moon, 
that 
is 
naturally 
more 
clear 
and 
montanous; 
but 
where 
the 
old 
spots 
do 
part, 
which 
are 
certain 
plains, 
that 
by 
means 
of 
their 
spherical 
inclination, 
receive 
the 
rayes 
of 
the 
Sun 
obliquely, 
there 
the 
term 
is 
not 
so 
distinct, 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
more 
dimme 
illumination. 
That, 
lastly, 
which 
he 
saith, 
how 
that 
the 
secondary 
light 
doth 
not 
diminish 
and 
languish, 
according 
as 
the 
Moon 
encreaseth, 
but 
conserveth 
it 
self 
continually 
in 
the 
same 
efficacy; 
is 
most 
false; 
nay 
it 
is 
hardly 
seen 
in 
the 
quadrature, 
when, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
it 
should 
appear 
more 
splendid, 
and 
be 
visible 
after 
the 
crepusculum 
in 
the 
dark 
of 
night. 
Let 
us 
conclude 
therefore, 
that 
the 
Earths 
reflection 
is 
very 
strong 
upon 
the 
Moon; 
and 
that, 
which 
you 
ought 
more 
to 
esteem, 
we 
may 
deduce 
from 
thence 
another 
admirable 
congruity 
between 
the 
Moon 
and 
Earth; 
namely, 
The 
Earth 
may 
reciprocally 
operate 
upon 
Coelestial 
bodies, 
with 
its 
light. 
that 
if 
it 
be 
true, 
the 
Planets 
operate 
upon 
the 
Earth 
by 
their 
motion 
and 
light, 
the 
Earth 
may 
probably 
be 
no 
lesse 
potent 
in 
operating 
reciprocally 
upon 
them 
with 
the 
same 
light, 
and 
peradventure, 
motion 
also. 
And 
though 
it 
should 
not 
move, 
yet 
may 
it 
retain 
the 
same 
operation; 
because, 
as 
it 
hath 
been 
proved 
already, 
the 
action 
of 
the 
light 
is 
the 
self 
same, 
I 
mean 
of 
the 
light 
of 
the 
Sun 
reflected; 
and 
motion 
doth 
nothing, 
save 
only 
vary 
the 
aspects, 
which 
fall 
out 
in 
the 
same 
manner, 
whether 
we 
make 
the 
Earth 
move, 
and 
the 
Sun 
stand 
still,orthecontrary. 


SIMPL. 


None 
of

are 
found 
to

Aristotle 
and 
the 
rest, 
who 
knew 
not 
that 
the 
Earth 
and 
Moon 
mutually 
illuminated 
each 
other, 
are 
to 
be 
excused; 
but 
they 
would 
justly 
deserve 
our 
censure, 
if 
whilest 
they 
desire 
that 
we 
should 
grant 
and 
believe 
with 
them, 
that 
the 
Moon 
operateth 
upon 
the 
Earth 
with 
light, 
they 
should 
deny 
to

that

In 
short, 
I 
find 
in 
my 
self 
a 
great 
unwillingnesse 
to 
admit 
this 
commerce, 
which 
you 
would 
perswade 
me 
to 
be 
betwixt 
the 
Earth 
and 
Moon, 
placing 
it, 
as 
we 
say, 
amongst 
the 
numberofthe 
Stars; 
for 
if 
therewere 
nothingelse,the 
great 
separation 
and 
distance 
between 
it 
and 
the 
Coelestial 
bodies,

SALV. 


See 
Simplicius 
what 
an 
inveterate 
affection 
and 
radicated 
opinion 
can 
do, 
since 
it 
is 
so 
powerful, 
that 
it 
makes 
you 
think 
that 
those 
very 
things 
favour 
you, 
which 
you 
produce 
against 
your 
self. 
For 
if 
separation 
and 
distance 
are 
accidents 
sufficient 
to 
perswade 
with 
you 
a 
great 
diversity 
of 
natures, 
it 
must 
follow 
that 
proximity 
and 
contiguity 
import 
similitude. 
Affinity 
between 
the 
Earth 
& 
Moon 
in 
respect 
of 
their 
vicinity. 
Now 
how 
much 
more 
neerer 
is 
the 
Moon 
to 
the 
Earth, 
than 
to 
any 
other 
of 
the 
Coelestial 
Orbs? 
You 
must 
acknowledg 
therefore, 
according 
to 
your 
own 
concession 
(and 
you 
shall 
have 
other 
Philosophers 
bear 
you 
company) 
that 
there 
is 
a 
very 
great 
affinity 
betwixt 
the 
Earth 
and 
Moon. 
Now 
let 
us 
proceed, 
and 
see 
whether 
any 
thing 
remains 
to 
be 
considered, 
touching 
those 
objections 
which 
you 
made 
against 
theresemblancesthatare 
betweenthesetwo 
bodies. 


SIMPL. 


It 
rests, 
that 
we 
say 
something 
touching 
the 
solidity 
of 
the 
Moon, 
which 
I 
argued 
from 
its 
being 
exquisite 
smooth 
and 
polite, 
and 
you 
from 
its 
montuosity. 
There 
is 
another 
scruple 
also 
comes 
into 
my 
mind, 
from 
an 
opinion 
which 
I 
have, 
that 
the 
Seas 
reflection 
ought 
by 
the 
equality 
of 
its 
surface, 
to 
be 
rendered 
stronger 
than 
that 
of 
the 
Earth, 
whose 
superficies 
is 
so 
roughand 
opacous. 


SALV. 


As 
to 
the 
first 
objection; 
I 
say, 
that 
like 
as 
among 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Earth, 
Solidity 
of 
the 
Lunar 
Globe 
argued 
from 
its 
being 
montainous. 
which 
all 
by 
their 
gravity 
strive 
to 
approach 
the 
nearest 
they 
can 
possible 
to 
the 
center, 
some 
of 
them 
alwayes 
are 
more 
remote 
from 
it 
than 
the 
rest, 
as 
the 
mountains 



more 
than 
the 
valleys, 
and 
that 
by 
reason 
of 
their 
solidity 
and 
firmnesse 
(for 
if 
they 
were 
of 
fluid, 
they 
would 
be 
even) 
so 
the 
seeing 
some 
parts 
of 
the 
Moon 
to 
be 
elevated 
above 
the 
sphericity 
of 
the 
lower 
parts, 
argueth 
their 
hardnesse; 
for 
it 
is 
probable 
that 
the 
matter 
of 
the 
Moon 
is 
reduced 
into 
a 
spherical 
form 
by 
the 
harmonious 
conspiration 
of 
all 
its 
parts 
to 
the 
same 
sentense. 
Touching 
the 
second 
doubt, 
my 
thinks 
that 
the 
particulars 
already 
observed 
to 
happen 
in 
the 
Looking-glasses, 
may 
very 
well 
assure 
us, 
that 
the 
reflection 
of 
light 
comming 
from 
the 
Sea, 
The 
Seas 
reflection 
of 
light 
much 
weaker 
than 
that 
of 
the 
Earth. 
is 
far 
weaker 
than 
that 
which 
cometh 
from 
Land; 
understanding 
it 
alwayes 
of 
the 
universal 
reflection; 
for 
as 
to 
that 
particular, 
on 
which 
the 
water 
being 
calm, 
casteth 
upon 
a 
determinate 
place, 
there 
is 
no 
doubt, 
but 
that 
he 
who 
shall 
stand 
in 
that 
place, 
shall 
see 
a 
very 
great 
reflection 
in 
the 
water, 
but 
every 
way 
else 
he 
shall 
see 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
Water 
more 
obscure 
than 
that 
of 
the 
Land; 
An 
experimen 
to 
prove 
the 
reflection 
of 
the 
Water 
lesse 
clear 
than

Here 
I 
see 
the 
west 
part 
shine 
more 
than 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
the

and 
I 
see 
that 
it 
so 
hapneth, 
because 
the

of 
the

which

SALV. 


That 
moisture 
hath 
done 
no 
more 
but 
filled 
those 
little 
cavities 
which 
are 
in 
the 
brick 
with 
water, 
and 
reduced 
its 
superficies 
to 
an 
exact 
evenesse; 
whereupon 
the 
reflex 
rayes 
issue 
unitedly 
towards 
one 
and 
the 
same 
place; 
but 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
pavement 
which 
is 
dry, 
hath 
its 
protuberances, 
that 
is, 
an 
innumerable 
variety 
of 
inclinations 
in 
its 
smallest 
particles; 
whereupon 
the 
reflections 
of 
the 
light 
scatter 
towards 
all 
parts, 
but 
more 
weakly 
than 
if 
they 
had 
gone 
all 
united 
together;and 
therefore, 
the 
samesheweth 
almost 
all 
alike, 
beheld 
several 
wayes, 
but 
far 
lesse 
clear 
than 
the 
moistned 
brick. 
I 
conclude 
therefore, 
that 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
Sea, 
beheld 
from 
the 
Moon, 
in 
like 
manner, 



as 
it 
would 
appear 
most 
equal, 
(the 
Islands 
and 
Rocks 
deducted) 
so 
it 
would 
shew 
lesse 
clear 
than 
that 
of 
the 
Earth, 
which 
is 
montanous 
and 
uneven. 
And 
but 
that 
I 
would 
not 
seem, 
as 
the 
saying 
is, 
to 
harp 
too 
much 
on 
one 
string, 
I 
could 
tell 
you 
that 
I 
have 
observed 
in 
the 
Moon 
that 
secondary 
light 
which 
I 
told 
you 
came 
to 
her 
from 
the 
reflection 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe, 
to 
be 
notably 
more 
clear 
two 
or 
three 
dayes 
before 
the 
conjunction, 
The 
secondary 
light 
of 
the

clearer 
before

than 
after, 
that 
is, 
when 
we 
see 
it 
before 
break 
of 
day 
in 
the 
East, 
than 
when 
it 
is 
seen 
at 
night 
after 
Sun-set 
in 
the 
West; 
of 
which 
difference 
the 
cause 
is, 
that 
the 
Terrestrial 
Hemisphere, 
which 
looks 
towards 
the 
Eastern 
Moon, 
hath 
little 
Sea, 
and 
much 
Land, 
to 
wit, 
all 
Asia, 
whereas, 
when 
it 
is 
in 
the 
West, 
it 
beholds 
very 
great 
Seas, 
that 
is, 
the 
whole 
Atlantick 
Ocean 
as 
far 
as 
America: 
An 
Argument 
sufficiently 
probable 
that 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
water 
appears 
lesse 
splendid 
thanthat

SIMPL. 


So 
that 
perhaps 
you 
believe, 
those 
great 
spots 
discovered 
in 
the 
face 
of 
the 
Moon,to 
beSeas,andtheotherclearerpartstobe 
Land,orsomesuch 
thing? 


SALV. 


This 
which 
you 
ask 
me, 
is 
the 
beginning 
of 
those 
incongruities 
which 
I 
esteem 
to 
be 
between 
the 
Moon 
and 
the 
Earth, 
out 
of 
which 
it 
is 
time 
to 
disingage 
our 
selves, 
for 
we 
have 
stayed 
too 
long 
in 
the 
Moon. 
I 
say 
therefore, 
that 
if 
there 
were 
in 
nature 
but 
one 
way 
onely, 
to 
make 
two 
superficies 
illustrated 
by 
the 
Sun, 
to 
appear 
one 
more 
clear 
than 
the 
other, 
and 
that 
this 
were 
by 
the 
being 
of 
the 
one 
Earth, 
and 
the 
other 
Water; 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
say 
that 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
Moon 
were 
part 
earthy 
and 
part 
aquatick; 
but 
because 
we 
know 
many 
wayes 
to 
produce 
the 
same 
effect 
(and 
others 
there 
may 
be 
which 
we 
know 
not 
of;) 
therefore 
I 
dare 
not 
affirm 
the 
Moon 
to 
consist 
of 
one 
thing 
more 
than 
another: 
It 
hath 
been 
seen 
already 
that 
a 
silver 
plate 
boiled, 
being 
toucht 
with 
the 
Burnisher, 
becometh 
of 
white 
obscure; 
that 
the 
moist 
part 
of 
the 
Earth 
shews 
more 
obscure 
than 
the 
dry; 
that 
in 
the 
tops 
of 
Hills, 
the 
woody 
parts 
appear 
more 
gloomy 
than 
the 
naked 
and 
barren; 
which 
hapneth 
because 
there 
falleth 
very 
much 
shadow 
among 
the 
Trees, 
but 
the 
open 
places 
are 
illuminated 
all 
over 
by 
the 
Sun. 
And 
this 
mixtion 
of 
shadow 
hath 
such 
operation, 
that 
in 
tufted 
velvet, 
the 
silk 
which 
is 



cut, 
is 
of 
a 
far 
darker 
colour 
than 
that 
which 
is 
not 
cut, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
shadows 
diffused 
betwixt 
thred 
and 
thred, 
and 
a 
plain 
velvet 
shews 
much 
blacker 
than 
a 
Taffata, 
made 
of 
the 
same 
silk. 
So 
that 
if 
there 
were 
in 
the 
Moon 
things 
which 
should 
look 
like 
great 
Woods, 
their 
aspect 
might 
represent 
unto 
us 
the 
spots 
which 
we 
discover; 
alike 
difference 
would 
be 
occasioned, 
if 
there 
were 
Seas 
in 
her: 
and 
lastly, 
nothing 
hindreth, 
but 
that 
those 
spots 
may 
really 
be 
of 
an 
obscurer 
colour 
than 
the 
rest; 
for 
thus 
the 
snow 
makes 
the 
mountainsshew 
brighter. 
The 
obscurer 
parts 
of 
theMoon 
are 
plains, 
and 
the 
more 
bright 
mountainous. 
That 
which 
is 
plainly 
observed 
in 
the 
Moon 
is, 
that 
its 
most 
obscure 
parts 
are 
all 
plains, 
with 
few 
rises 
and 
bancks 
in 
them; 
though 
some 
there 
be; 
the 
rest 
which 
is 
of 
a 
brighter 
colour, 
is 
all 
full 
of 
rocks, 
mountains, 
hillocks 
of 
spherical 
and 
other 
figures; 
and 
in 
particular, 
round 
about 
the 
spots 
are 
very 
great 
ledges 
of 
mountains. 
Long 
ledges 
of 
mountains 
about 
the 
spots 
of 
the 
Moon. 
That 
the 
spots 
be 
plain 
superficies, 
we 
have 
assured 
proof, 
in 
that 
we 
see, 
how 
that 
the 
term 
which 
distinguisheth 
the 
part 
illuminated 
from 
the 
obscure, 
in 
crossing 
the 
spots 
makes 
the 
intersection 
even, 
but 
in 
the 
clear 
parts 
it 
shews 
all 
craggy 
and 
shagged. 
But 
I 
know 
not 
as 
yet 
whether 
this 
evennesse 
of 
superficies 
may 
be 
sufficient 
of 
it 
self 
alone, 
to 
make 
the 
obscurity 
appear, 
and 
I 
rather 
think 
not. 
Besides, 
I 
account 
the 
Moon 
exceeding 
different 
from 
the 
Earth; 
for 
although 
I 
imagine 
to 
my 
self 
that 
those 
are 
not 
idle 
and 
dead 
Regions, 
There 
are 
not 
generated 
in 
the 
Moon 
things 
like 
to 
ours, 
but 
if 
there 
be 
any 
productions, 
they 
are 
very 
different. 
yet 
I 
affirm 
not, 
that 
there 
are 
in 
them 
motion 
and 
life, 
much 
less 
that 
there 
are 
bred 
plants, 
animals 
or 
other 
things 
like 
to 
ours; 
but, 
if 
such 
there 
be, 
they 
should 
nevertheless 
be 
very 
different, 
and 
remote 
from 
our 
imagination. 
And 
I 
am 
induced 
so 
to 
think, 
because 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
I 
esteem 
that 
the 
matter 
of 
the 
Lunar 
Globe 
consists 
not 
of 
Earth 
and 
Water; 
and 
this 
alone 
sufficeth 
to 
take 
away 
the 
generations 
and 
alterations 
resembling 
ours: 
The 
Moon 
not 
composed 
of 
Water 
and 
Earth. 
but 
now 
supposing 
that 
there 
were 
in 
the 
Moon, 
Water 
and 
Earth, 
yet 
would 
they 
not 
produce 
plants 
and 
animals 
like 
to 
ours; 
Those 
aspects 
of 
the 
Sun 
necessary 
for 
our 
generations, 
are 
not 
so 
in 
the 
Moon. 
and 
this 
for 
two 
principal 
reasons: 
The 
first 
is, 
that 
unto 
our 
productions 
there 
are 
required 
so 
many 
variable 
aspects 
of 
the 
Sun, 
that 
without 
them 
they 
would 
all 
miscarry: 
now 
the 
habitudes 
of 
the 
Sun 
towards 
the 
Earth 
are 
far 
different 
from 
those 
towards 
the 
Moon. 
We 
as 
to 
the 
diurnal 
illumination, 
have, 
in 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
Earth, 
every 
twenty 
four 
hours 
part 
day, 
and 
part 
night, 
which 
effect 
in 



the 
Moon 
is 
monethly: 
and 
that 
annual 
declination 
and 
elevation 
of 
the 
Sun 
in 
the 
Zodiack, 
Natural 
dayes 
in 
the 
Moon 
are 
of 
a 
Moneth 
long. 
by 
which 
it 
produceth 
diversity 
of 
Seasons, 
and 
inequality 
of 
dayes 
and 
nights, 
are 
finished 
in 
the 
Moon 
in 
a 
moneth; 
and 
whereas 
the 
Sun 
to 
us 
riseth 
and 
declineth 
so 
much, 
To 
the 
Moon 
the 
Sun 
ascendeth 
and 
declineth 
with 
a 
difference 
of 
ten 
degrees, 
and 
to 
the 
Earth 
of 
forty 
seven 
degrees. 
that 
from 
the 
greatest 
to 
the 
least 
altitude, 
there 
is 
a 
difference 
of 
almost 
47 
degrees, 
for 
so 
much 
is 
the 
distance 
from 
one 
to 
the 
other 
Tropick; 
this 
is 
in 
the 
Moon 
but 
ten 
degrees 
only, 
or 
little 
more; 
namely, 
as 
much 
as 
the 
greatest 
Latitudes 
of 
the 
Dragon 
on 
each 
side 
the 
Ecliptick. 
Now 
consider 
what 
effect 
the 
Sun 
would 
have 
in 
the 
torrid 
Zone, 
should 
it 
continually 
for 
fifteen 
dayes 
together 
beam 
forth 
its 
Rayes 
upon 
it; 
which 
without 
all 
question 
would 
destroy 
plants, 
herbs, 
and 
living 
creatures: 
and 
if 
it 
should 
chance 
that 
there 
were 
any 
production, 
it 
would 
be 
of 
herbs, 
plants, 
and 
creatures 
very 
different 
from 
those 
which 
are 
now 
there. 
There 
are 
no 
rains 
in 
the 
Moon. 
Secondly, 
I 
verily 
believe 
that 
in 
the 
Moon 
there 
are 
no 
rains, 
for 
if 
Clouds 
should 
gather 
in 
any 
part 
thereof, 
as 
they 
do 
about 
the 
Earth, 
they 
would 
thereupon 
hide 
from 
our 
sight 
some 
of 
those 
things, 
which 
we 
with 
the 
Telescope 
behold 
in 
the 
Moon, 
and 
in 
a 
word, 
would 
some 
way 
or 
other 
change 
its 
Phaenomenon, 
an 
effect 
which 
I 
could 
never 
by 
long 
and 
diligent 
observations 
discover; 
but 
alwayes 
behelditinaevenandpureserenity. 


SAGR. 


To 
this 
may 
be 
answered, 
either 
that 
there 
might 
be 
great 
mists, 
or 
that 
it 
might 
rain 
in 
the 
time 
of 
their 
night, 
that 
is, 
when 
the 
Sun 
doth 
not 
illuminate 
it. 


SALV. 


If 
other 
passages 
did 
but 
assure 
us, 
that 
there 
were 
generations 
in 
it 
like 
to 
ours, 
and 
that 
there 
was 
onely 
wanting 
the 
concourse 
of 
rains, 
we 
might 
find 
out 
this, 
or 
some 
other 
temperament 
to 
serve 
instead 
thereof, 
as 
it 
happens 
in 
Egypt 
by 
the 
inundation 
of 
Nile: 
but 
not 
meeting 
with 
any 
accident, 
which 
corresponds 
with 
ours, 
of 
many 
that 
have 
been 
sought 
out 
for 
the 
production 
of 
the 
like 
effects, 
we 
need 
not 
trouble 
our 
selves 
to 
introduce 
one 
alone; 
and 
that 
also, 
not 
because 
we 
have 
certain 
observation 
of 
it, 
but 
for 
a 
bare 
non-
repugnance 
that 
we 
find 
therein. 
Moreover, 
if 
I 
was 
demanded 
what 
my 
first 



apprehension, 
and 
pure 
natural 
reason 
dictated 
to 
me 
concerning 
the 
production 
of 
things 
like 
or 
unlike 
there 
above, 
I 
would 
alwayes 
reply, 
that 
they 
are 
most 
different, 
and 
to 
us 
altogether 
unimaginable, 
for 
so 
me 
thinks 
the 
riches 
of 
Nature, 
and 
the 
omnipotence 
of 
our 
Creator 
and 
Governour, 
do 
require. 


SAGR. 


I 
ever 
accounted 
extraordinary 
madnesse 
that 
of 
those, 
who 
would 
make 
humane 
comprehension 
the 
measure 
of 
what 
nature 
hath 
a 
power 
or 
knowledge 
to 
effect; 
whereas 
on 
the 
contrary 
there 
is 
not 
any 
the 
least 
effect 
in 
Nature, 
The 
having 
a 
perfect 
knowledg 
of 
nothing, 
maketh 
some 
believe 
they 
understand 
all 
things. 
which 
can 
be 
fully 
understood 
by 
the 
most 
speculative 
wits 
in 
the

This 
their

Your 
discourse 
is 
very 
concluding; 
in 
confirmation 
of 
which 
we 
have 
the 
example 
of 
those 
who 
understand, 
or 
have 
known 
some 
thing, 
which 
the 
more 
knowing 
they 
are, 
the 
more 
they 
know, 
and 
freely 
confesse 
that 
they 
know 
little; 
nay, 
the 
wisest 
man 
in 
all 
Greece, 
and 
for 
such 
pronounced 
by

professedtoknowthatheknewnothing. 


SIMPL. 


It 
must 
be 
granted 
therefore, 
either 
that 
Socrates 
or 
that 
the 
Oracle 
it 
self 
was 
a 
lyar, 
that 
declaring 
him 
to 
be 
most 
wise, 
and 
he 
confessing 
that 
he 
knew 
himselftobe 
mostignorant. 


SALV. 


Neither 
one 
nor 
the 
other 
doth 
follow, 
The 
answer 
of 
the 
Oracle 
true 
in 
judging 
Socrates 
the 
wisest 
of 
his 
time. 
for 
that 
both 
the 
assertions 
may 
be 
true. 
The 
Oracle 
adjudged 
Socrates 
the 
wisest 
of 
all 
men, 
whose 
knowledg 
is 



limited; 
Socrates 
acknowledgeth 
that 
he 
knew 
nothing 
in 
relation 
to 
absolute 
wisdome, 
which 
is 
infinite; 
and 
because 
of 
infinite, 
much 
is 
the 
same 
part, 
as 
is 
little, 
and 
as 
is 
nothing 
(for 
to 
arrive 
v. 
g. 
to 
the 
infinite 
number, 
it 
is 
all 
one 
to 
accumulate 
thousands, 
tens, 
or 
ciphers,) 
therefore 
Socrates 
well 
perceived 
his 
wisdom 
to 
be 
nothing, 
in 
comparison 
of 
the 
infinite 
knowledg 
which 
he 
wanted. 
But 
yet, 
because 
there 
is 
some 
knowledg 
found 
amongst 
men, 
and 
this 
not 
equally 
shared 
to 
all, 
Socrates 
might 
have 
a 
greater 
share 
thereofthanothers,andthereforeverifiedtheansweroftheOracle. 


SAGR. 


IthinkIverywellunderstandthis 
particular 
amongstmen,Simplicius 
thereis 
a 
power 
of 
operating, 
but 
not 
equally 
dispensed 
to 
all; 
and 
it 
is 
without 
question, 
that 
the 
power 
of 
an 
Emperor 
is 
far 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
a 
private 
person; 
but, 
both 
this 
and 
that 
are 
nothing 
in 
comparison 
of 
the 
Divine 
Omnipotence. 
Amongst 
men, 
there 
are 
some 
that 
better 
understand 
Agriculture 
than 
many 
others; 
but 
the 
knowledg 
of 
planting 
a 
Vine 
in 
a 
trench, 
what 
hath 
it 
to 
do 
with 
the 
knowledg 
of 
making 
it 
to 
sprout 
forth, 
to 
attract 
nourishment, 
to 
select 
this 
good 
part 
from 
that 
other, 
for 
to 
make 
thereof 
leaves, 
another 
to 
make 
sprouts, 
another 
to 
make 
grapes, 
another 
to 
make 
raisins, 
another 
to 
make 
the 
huskes 
of 
them, 
which 
are 
the 
works 
of 
most 
wise 
Nature? 
This 
is 
one 
only 
particular 
act 
of 
the 
innumerable, 
which 
Nature 
doth, 
Divine 
Wisdom 
infinitely 
infinite. 
and 
in 
it 
alone 
is 
discovered 
an 
infinite 
wisdom, 
so 
that 
Divine 
Wisdom 
may 
be 
concluded 
to 
be 
infinitely 
infinite. 


SALV. 


Take 
hereof 
another 
example. 
Do 
we 
not 
say 
that 
the 
judicious 
discovering 
of 
a 
most 
lovely 
Statua 
in 
a 
piece 
of 
Marble, 
hath 
sublimated 
the 
wit 
of 
Buonarruotti 
far 
above 
the 
vulgar 
wits 
of 
other 
men?Buonarruotti, 
a 
statuary 
of 
admirable 
ingenitity. 
And 
yet 
this 
work 
is 
onely 
the 
imitation 
of 
a 
meer 
aptitude 
and 
disposition 
of 
exteriour 
and 
superficial 
members 
of 
an 
immoveable 
man; 
but 
what 
is 
it 
in 
comparison 
of 
a 
man 
made 
by 
nature, 
composed 
of 
as 
many 
exteriour 
and 
interiour 
members, 
of 
so 
many 
muscles, 
tendons, 
nerves, 
bones, 
which 
serve 
to 
so 
many 
and 
sundry 
motions? 
but 
what 
shall 
we 
say 
of 
the 
senses, 
and 
of 
the 
powers 
of 
the 
soul, 
and 
lastly, 
of 
the 
understanding? 
May 
we 
not 
say, 
and 
that 
with 
reason, 
that 
the 
structure 
of 



a

fals 
far 
short 
of 
the 
formation 
of 
a 
living

yea 
more 
of 
a 
contemptibleworm?

And 
what 
difference 
think 
you, 
was 
there 
betwixt 
the 
Dove

SIMPL. 


Either 
I 
am 
none 
of 
these 
knowing 
men, 
or 
else 
there 
is 
a 
manifest 
contradiction 
in 
this 
your 
discourse. 
You 
account 
understanding 
amongst 
the 
greatest 
(if 
you 
make 
it 
not 
the 
chief 
of 
the) 
Encomiums 
ascribed 
to 
man 
made 
by 
Nature, 
and 
a 
little 
before 
you 
said 
with 
Socrates, 
that 
he 
had 
no 
knowledg 
at 
all; 
therefore 
you 
must 
say, 
that 
neither 
did 
Nature 
understand 
howtomakeanunderstandingthatunderstandeth. 


SALV. 


You 
argue 
very 
cunningly, 
but 
to 
reply 
to 
your 
objection 
I 
must 
have 
recourse 
to 
a 
Philosophical 
distinction, 
and 
say 
that 
the 
understanding 
is 
to 
be 
taken 
too 
ways, 
Man 
understandeth 
very 
well 
intensivè, 
but 
little 
extensivè. 
that 
is 
intensivè, 
or 
extensivè; 
and 
that 
extensivè, 
that 
is, 
as 
to 
the 
multitude 
of 
intelligibles, 
which 
are 
infinite, 
the 
understanding 
of 
man 
is 
as 
nothing, 
though 
he 
should 
understand 
a 
thousand 
propositions; 
for 
that 
a 
thousand, 
in 
respect 
of 
infinity 
is 
but 
as 
a 
cypher: 
but 
taking 
the 
understanding 
intensive, 
(in 
as 
much 
as 
that 
term 
imports) 
intensively, 
that 
is, 
perfectly 
some 
propositions, 
I 
say, 
that 
humane 
wisdom 
understandeth 
some 
propositions 
so 
perfectly, 
and 
is 
as 
absolutely 
certain 
thereof, 
as 
Nature 
her 
self; 
and 
such 
are 
the 
pure 
Mathematical 
sciences, 
to 
wit, 
Geometry 
and 
Arithmetick: 
in 
which 
Divine 
Wisdom 
knows 
infinite 
more 
propositions, 
because 
it 
knows 
them 
all; 
but 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
knowledge 
of 
those 
few 
comprehended 
by 
humane 
understanding, 
equalleth 
the 
divine, 
as 
to 
the 
certainty 
objectivè, 
for 
that 
it 
arriveth 
to 
comprehend 
the 
necessity 
thereof, 
than 
which 
there 
can 
be 
no 
greatercertainty.

These 
are 
common 
notions,

far 
from 
all 
umbrage 
of 
temerity, 
or 
boldness, 
and 
detract 
not 
in 
the 
least 
from 
the 
Majesty 
of 
divine

as 
it 
nothing 
diminisheth 
the 
omnipotence 
thereof 
to 
say, 
that 
God 
cannot 
make 
what 
is 
once 
done, 
to 
be 
undone: 
but 
I 
doubt, 
Simplicius, 
that 
your 
scruple 
ariseth 
from 
an 
opinion 
you 
have, 
that 
my 
words 
are 
somewhat 
equivocal; 
therefore 
the 
better 
to 
express 
my 
self 
I 
say, 
that 
as 
to 
the 
truth, 
of 
which 
Mathematical 
demonstrations 
give 
us 
the 
knowledge, 
it 
is 
the 
same, 
which 
the

knoweth; 
but 
this 
I 
must 
grant 
you, 
G 
ds 
manner 
of 
knowing 
different 
from 
that 
of 
men. 
that 
the 
manner 
whereby 
God 
knoweth 
the 
infinite 
propositions, 
of 
which 
we 
understand 
some 
few, 
is 
highly 
more 
excellent 
than 
ours, 
Humane 
understanding 
done 
by 
raciocination. 
which

his

the 
most 
simple, 
and 
taking 
that 
for 
its 
definition, 
doproceed 
with 
argumentation 
to 
another, 
and 
from 
that 
to 
a 
third, 
and 
then 
to 
a 
fourth, 
&c. 
the 
Divine 
Wisdom, 
by 
the 
apprehension 
of 
its 
essence 
comprehends, 
without 
temporary 
raciocination, 
all 
these 
infinite 
passions; 
which 
notwithstanding, 
are 
in 
effect 
virtually 
comprised 
in 
the 
definitions 
of 
all 
things; 
Definitions 
contein 
virtually 
all 
the 
passions 
of 
the 
things 
defined. 
and, 
to 
conclude, 
as 
being 
infinite, 
perhaps 
are 
but 
one 
alone 
in 
their 
nature, 
and 
in 
the 
Divine 
Mind; 
the 
which 
neither 
is 
wholly 
unknown 
to 
humane 
understanding, 
Infinite 
Passions 
are 
perhaps 
but 
one 
onely. 
but 
onely 
be-clouded 
with 
thick 
and 
grosse 
mists; 
which 
come 
in 
part 
to 
be 
dissipated 
and 
clarified, 
when 
we 
are 
made 
Masters 
of 
any 
conclusions, 
firmly 
demonstrated, 
and 
so 
perfectly 
made 
ours, 
as 
that 
we 
can 
speedily 
run 
through 
them; 
for 
in 
sum, 
what 
other, 
is 
that 
proposition, 
that 
the 
square 
of 
the 
side 
subtending 
the 
right 
angle 
in 
any 
triangle, 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
other 
two, 
which 
include 
it, 
but 
onely 
the 
Paralellograms 
being 
upon 
common 
bases, 
and 
between 
parallels 
equal 
amongst 
themselves? 
and 
this, 
lastly, 
is 
it 
not 
the 
same, 
as 
to 
say 
that 
those 
two 
superficies 
are 
equal, 
of 
which 
equal 
parts 
applyed 
to 
equal 
parts, 
The 
discourses 
which 
humane 
reason 
makes 
in 
a 
certain 
time, 
the 
Divine 
Wisdom 
resolveth 
in 
a 
moment; 



that 
is, 
hath 
them 
alwayes 
present. 
possesse 
equal 
place? 
Now 
these 
inferences, 
which 
our 
intellect 
apprehendeth 
with 
time 
and 
a 
gradual 
motion, 
the 
Divine 
Wisdom, 
like 
light, 
penetrateth 
in 
an 
instant, 
which 
is 
the 
same 
as 
to 
say, 
hath 
them 
alwayes 
present: 
I 
conclude 
therefore, 
that 
our 
understanding, 
both 
as 
to 
the 
manner 
and 
the 
multitude 
of 
the 
things 
comprehended 
by 
us, 
is 
infinitely 
surpast 
by 
the 
Divine 
Wisdom; 
but 
yet 
I 
do 
not 
so 
vilifie 
it, 
as 
to 
repute 
it 
absolutely 
nothing; 
yea 
rather, 
when 
I 
consider 
how 
many 
and 
how 
great 
misteries 
men 
have 
understood, 
discovered, 
and 
contrived, 
I 
very 
plainly 
know 
and 
understand 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
to 
be 
one 
of 
theworks,yea 
oneof 
themostexcellentworks 
ofGod. 


SAGR. 


I 
have 
oft 
times 
considered 
with 
my 
self, 
The 
wit 
of 
man 
admirably 
acute. 
in 
pursuance 
of 
that 
which 
you 
speak 
of, 
how 
great 
the 
wit 
of 
man 
is; 
and 
whil’st 
I 
run 
thorow 
such 
and 
so 
many 
admirable 
inventions 
found 
out 
by 
him, 
as 
well 
in 
the 
Arts, 
as 
Sciences; 
and 
again 
reflecting 
upon 
my 
own 
wit, 
so 
far 
from 
promising 
me 
the 
discovery 
of 
any 
thing 
new, 
that 
I 
despair 
of 
comprehending 
what 
is 
already 
discovered, 
confounded 
with 
wonder, 
and 
surprised 
with 
desperation, 
I 
account 
my 
self 
little 
lesse 
than 
miserable. 
If 
I 
behold 
a 
Statue 
of 
some 
excellent 
Master, 
I 
say 
with 
my 
self; 
When 
wilt 
thou 
know 
how 
to 
chizzle 
away 
the 
refuse 
of 
a 
piece 
of 
Marble, 
and 
discover 
so 
lovely 
a 
figure, 
as 
lyeth 
hid 
therein? 
When 
wilt 
thou 
mix 
and 
spread 
so 
many 
different 
colours 
upon 
a 
Cloth, 
or 
Wall, 
and 
represent 
therewith 
all 
visible 
objects, 
like 
a 
Michael 
Angelo, 
a 
Raphaello, 
or 
a 
Tizvano? 
If 
I 
behold 
what 
inventions 
men 
have 
in 
comparting 
Musical 
intervals, 
in 
establishing 
Precepts 
and 
Rules 
for 
the 
management 
thereof 
with 
admirable 
delight 
to 
the 
ear: 
When 
shall 
I 
cease 
my 
astonishment? 
What 
shall 
I 
say 
of 
such 
and 
so 
various 
Instruments 
of 
that 
Art? 
The 
reading 
of 
excellent 
Poets, 
with 
what 
admiration 
doth 
it 
swell 
any 
one 
that 
attentively 
considereth 
the 
invention 
of 
conceits, 
and 
their 
explanation? 
What 
shall 
we 
say 
of 
Architecture? 
What 
of 
Navigation?The 
invention 
of 
writing 
stupendious 
above 
all 
others. 
But, 
above 
all 
other 
stupendious 
inventions, 
what 
sublimity 
of 
mind 
was 
that 
in 
him, 
that 
imagined 
to 
himself 
to 
find 
out 
a 
way 
to 
communicate 
his 
most 
secret 
thoughts 
to 
any 
other 
person, 
though 
very 
far 
distant 
from 
him 
either 
in 
time, 
or

with 
those

of

SALV. 


THE 
yesterdayes 
diversions 
which 
led 
us 
out 
of 
the 
path 
of 
our 
principal 
discourse, 
were 
such 
and 
so 
many, 
that 
I 
know 
not 
how 
I 
can 
without 
your 
assistancerecover 
the 
track 
inwhich 
Iamtoproceed. 


SAGR. 


I 
wonder 
not, 
that 
you, 
who 
have 
your 
fancy 
charged 
and 
laden 
with 
both 
what 
hath 
been, 
and 
is 
to 
be 
spoken, 
do 
find 
your 
self 
in 
some 
confusion; 
but 
I, 
who 
as 
being 
onely 
an 
Auditor, 
have 
nothing 
to 
burthen 
my 
memory 
withal, 
but 
such 
things 
as 
I 
have 
heard, 
may 
haply 
by 
a 
succinct 
rehearsal 
of 
them, 
recover 
the 
first 
thred 
of 
our 
Discourse. 
As 
far 
therefore 
as 
my 
memory 
serves 
me, 
the 
sum 
of 
yester-dayes 
conferences 
were 
an 
examination 
of 
the 
Principles 
of 
Ptolomy 
and 
Copernicus, 
and 
which 
of 
their 
opinions 
is 
the 
more 
probable 
and 
rational; 
that, 
which 
affirmeth 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
Coelestial 
bodies 
to 
be 
ingenerable, 
incorruptible, 
unalterable, 
impassible, 
and 
in 
a 
word, 
exempt 
from 
all 
kind 
of 
change, 
save 
that 
of 
local, 
and 
therefore 
to 
be 
a 
fifth 
essence, 
quite 
different 
from 
this 
of 
our 
Elementary 
bodies, 
which 
are 
generable, 
corruptible, 
alterable, 
&c. 
or 
else 
the 
other, 
which 
taking 
away 
such 
deformity 
from 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
World, 
holdeth 
the 
Earth 
to 
enjoy 
the 
same 
perfections 
as 
the 
other 
integral 
bodies 
of 
the 
universe; 
and 
esteemeth 
it 
a 
moveable 
and 
erratick 
Globe, 
no 
lesse 
than 
the 
Moon, 
Jupiter, 
Venus, 
or 
any 
other 
Planet: 
And 
lastly, 
maketh 
many 
particular 
parallels 
betwixt 
the 
Earth 
and 
Moon; 
and 
more 
with 
the 
Moon, 
than 
with 
any 
other 
Planet; 
haply 
by 
reason 
we 
have 
greater 
and 
more 
certain 
notice 
of 
it, 
as 
being 
lesse 
distant 
from 
us. 
And 
having, 
lastly, 
concluded 
this 
second 
opinion 
to 
have 
more 
of 
probability 
with 
it 
than 
the 
first, 
I 
should 
think 
it 
best 
in 
the 
subsequent 
discourses 
to 
begin 
to 
examine 
whether 
the 
Earth 
be 
esteemed 
immoveable, 
as 
it 
hath 
been 
till 
now 
believed 
by 
most 
men, 
or 
else 
moveable, 
as 
some 
ancient 
Philosophers 
held, 
and 
others 
of 
not 
very 
recesse 
times, 
were 
of 
opinion; 
and 
if 
it 
be 
moveable, 
to 
enquire 
of 
what 
kindits 
motionmaybe? 



SALV. 


I 
see 
already 
what 
way 
I 
am 
to 
take; 
but 
before 
we 
offer 
to 
proceed 
any 
farther, 
I 
am 
to 
say 
something 
to 
you 
touching 
those 
last 
words 
which 
you 
spake,how 
thattheopinionwhich 
holds 
the 
Earthtobeenduedwith 
thesame 
conditions 
that 
the 
Coelestial 
bodies 
enjoy, 
seems 
to 
be 
more 
true 
than 
the 
contrary; 
for 
that 
I 
affirmed 
no 
such 
thing, 
nor 
would 
I 
have 
any 
of 
the 
Propositions 
in 
controversie, 
be 
made 
to 
speak 
to 
any 
definitive 
sense: 
but 
I 
onely 
intended 
to 
produce 
on 
either 
part, 
those 
reasons 
and 
answers, 
arguments 
and 
solutions, 
which 
have 
been 
hitherto 
thought 
upon 
by 
others, 
together 
with 
certain 
others, 
which 
I 
have 
stumbled 
upon 
in 
my 
long 
searching 
thereinto, 
alwayes 
remitting 
the 
decision 
thereof 
to 
the 
judgment 
of 
others. 


SAGR. 


I 
was 
unawares 
transported 
by 
my 
own 
sense 
of 
the 
thing; 
and 
believing 
that 
others 
ought 
to 
judg 
as 
I 
did, 
I 
made 
that 
conclusion 
universal, 
which 
should 
have 
been 
particular; 
and 
therefore 
confesse 
I 
have 
erred, 
and 
the 
rather, 
in 
that 
IknownotwhatSimpliciushisjudgmentisinthisparticular. 


SIMPL. 


I 
must 
confesse, 
that 
I 
have 
been 
ruminating 
all 
this 
night 
of 
what 
past 
yesterday, 
and 
to 
say 
the 
truth, 
I 
meet 
therein 
with 
many 
acute, 
new, 
aud 
plausible 
notions; 
yet 
nevertheless, 
I 
find 
my 
self 
over-perswaded 
by 
the 
authority 
of 
so 
many 
great 
Writers, 
and 
in 
particular 
— 
&c. 
I 
see 
you 
shake 
your 
head 
Sagredus, 
and 
smile 
to 
your 
self, 
as 
if 
I 
had 
uttered 
some 
great 
absurdity. 


SAGR. 


I 
not 
onely 
smile, 
but 
to 
tell 
you 
true, 
am 
ready 
to 
burst 
with 
holding 
in 
my 
self 
from 
laughing 
outright, 
for 
you 
have 
put 
me 
in 
mind 
of 
a 
very 
pretty 
passage, 
that 
I 
was 
a 
witnesse 
of, 
not 
many 
years 
since, 
together 
with 
some 
others 
ofmyworthyfriends, 
whichIcouldyetname

SALV. 



It 
would 
be 
well 
that 
you 
told 
us 
what 
it 
was, 
that 
so 
Simplicius 
may 
not 
still 
thinkthat

SAGR. 


I 
am 
content. 
I 
found 
one 
day, 
at 
home 
in 
his 
house, 
at 
Venice, 
a 
famous 
Phisician, 
to 
whom 
some 
flockt 
for 
their 
studies, 
and 
others 
out 
of 
curiosity, 
sometimes 
came 
thither 
to 
see 
certain 
Anatomies 
diffected 
by 
the 
hand 
of 
a 
no 
lesse 
learned, 
than 
careful 
and 
experienced 
Anatomist. 
The 
original 
of 
the 
Nerves 
according 
to 
Aristotle, 
and 
according 
to 
Phisicians. 
It 
chanced 
upon 
that 
day, 
whenIwasthere,thathewasinsearchof 
the 
originalandrise 
ofthe 
Nerves, 
about 
which 
there 
is 
a 
famous 
controversie 
between 
the 
Galenists 
and 
Peripateticks; 
and 
the 
Anatomist 
shewing, 
how 
that 
the 
great 
number 
of 
Nerves 
departing 
from 
the 
Brain, 
as 
their 
root, 
and 
passing 
by 
the 
nape 
of 
the 
Neck, 
distend 
themselves 
afterwards 
along 
by 
the 
Back-bone, 
and 
branch 
themselves 
thorow 
all 
the 
Body; 
and 
that 
a 
very 
small 
filament, 
as 
fine 
as 
a 
thred 
went 
to 
the 
Heart; 
he 
turned 
to 
a 
Gentleman 
whom 
he 
knew 
to 
be 
a 
Peripatetick 
Philosopher, 
and 
for 
whose 
sake 
he 
had 
with 
extraordinary 
exactnesse, 
discovered 
and 
proved 
every 
thing, 
and 
demanded 
of 
him, 
if 
he 
was 
at 
length 
satisfied 
and 
perswaded 
that 
the 
original 
of 
the 
Nerves 
proceeded 
from 
the 
Brain, 
and 
not 
from 
the 
Heart?The 
ridiculous 
answer 
of 
a 
Philosopher, 
determining 
the 
original 
of 
the 
Nerves. 
To 
which 
the 
Philosopher, 
after 
he 
had 
stood 
musing 
a 
while, 
answered; 
you 
have 
made 
me 
to 
see 
this 
businesse 
so 
plainly 
and 
sensibly, 
that 
did 
not 
the 
Text 
of 
Aristotle 
assert 
the 
contrary, 
which 
positively 
affirmeth 
the 
Nerves 
to 
proceed 
from 
the 
Heart,Ishouldbe

SIMPL. 


I 
would 
have 
you 
know 
my 
Masters, 
that 
this 
controversie 
about 
the 
original 
of 
the 
Nerves 
is 
not 
yet 
so 
proved 
and 
decided, 
as 
some 
may 
perhaps 
perswadethemselves. 


SAGR. 


Nor 
questionlesse 
ever 
shall 
it 
be, 
if 
it 
find 
such 
like 
contradictors; 
but 
that 
which 
you 
say, 
doth 
not 
at 
all 
lessen 
the 
extravagance 
of 
the 
answer 
of 
that 
Peripatetick, 
who 
against 
such 
sensible 
experience 
produced 
not 
other 



experiments, 
or 
reasons 
of 
Aristotle, 
but 
his 
bare 
authority 
and 
pure 
ipse 
dixit. 


SIMPL. 


Aristotle 
had 
not 
gained 
so 
great 
authority, 
but 
for 
the 
force 
of 
his 
Demonstrations, 
and 
the 
profoundnesse 
of 
his 
arguments; 
but 
it 
is 
requisite 
that 
we 
understand 
him, 
and 
not 
onely 
understand 
him, 
but 
have 
so 
great 
familiarity 
with 
his 
Books, 
that 
we 
form 
a 
perfect 
Idea 
thereof 
in 
our 
minds, 
so 
as 
that 
every 
saying 
of 
his 
may 
be 
alwayes 
as 
it 
were, 
present 
in 
our 
memory 
for 
he 
did 
not 
write 
to 
the 
vulgar, 
nor 
is 
he 
obliged 
to 
spin 
out 
his 
Sillogismes 
with 
the 
trivial 
method 
of 
disputes; 
nay 
rather, 
using 
a 
freedome, 
he 
hath 
sometimes 
placed 
the 
proof 
of 
one 
Proposition 
amongst 
Texts, 
which 
seem 
to 
treat 
of 
quite 
another 
point; 
Requisites 
to 
fit 
a 
man 
to 
philosophate 
well 
after

therefore

But 
good 
Simplicius, 
like 
as 
the 
things 
scattered 
here 
and 
there 
in 
Aristotle, 
give 
you 
no 
trouble 
in 
collecting 
them, 
but 
that 
you 
perswade 
your 
self 
to 
be 
able 
by 
comparing 
and 
connecting 
several 
small 
sentences

extract 
thence 
the

some 
desired 
conclusion,

so 
this, 
which 
you 
and 
other 
egregious 
Philosophers 
do 
with 
the 
Text 
of

I 
could 
do 
by 
the

of

or 
of

But 
what 
talk 
I 
of 
Virgil, 
or 
any 
other 
Poet? 
I 
have 
a 
little 
Book 
much 
shorter 
than 
Aristotle 
and 
Ovid, 
in 
which 
are 
conteined 
all 
the 
Sciences, 
and 
with 
very 
little 
study, 
one 
may 
gather 
out 
of 
it 
a 
most 
perfect 
Idea, 
and 
this 
is 
the 
Alphabet; 
and 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
but 
that 
he 
who 
knows 
how 
to 
couple 
and 
dispose 
aright 
this 
and 
that 
vowel, 
with 
those, 
or 
those 
other 
consonants, 
may 
gather 
thence 
the 
infallible 
answers 
to 
all 
doubts, 
and 
deduce 
from 
them 
the 
principles 
of 
all 



Sciences 
and 
Arts, 
just 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
the 
Painter 
from 
divers 
simple 
colours, 
laid 
severally 
upon 
his 
Pallate, 
proceedeth 
by 
mixing 
a 
little 
of 
this 
and 
a 
little 
of 
that, 
with 
a 
little 
of 
a 
third,

represent 
to 
the

plants, 
buildings, 
birds, 
fishes,

in 
a 
word,

what

be 
not 
on 
the 
Pallate 
all 
the

either 
eyes, 
or 
feathers,or 
fins,orleaves,or

Nay, 
farther, 
it 
is 
necessary,thatnone 
of 
the 
things 
to 
be 
imitated, 
or 
any 
part 
of 
them, 
be 
actually 
among 
colours, 
if 
you 
would 
be 
able 
therewith 
to 
represent 
all 
things; 
for 
should 
there 
be 
amongst 
them 
v.

so 
simple,

not

been

to 
have

the

that 
would

more

with

laught

Do 
you 
question 
whether 
Aristotle, 
had 
he 
but 



seen 
the 
novelties 
discovered 
in 
Heaven, 
would 
not 
have 
changed 
his 
opinion, 
amended 
his 
Books, 
and 
embraced 
the 
more 
sensible 
Doctrine; 
rejecting 
those 
silly 
Gulls, 
which 
too 
scrupulously 
go 
about 
to 
defend 
what 
ever 
he 
hath 
said; 
not 
considering, 
that 
if 
Aristotle 
were 
such 
a 
one 
as 
they 
fancy 
him 
to 
themselves, 
he 
would 
be 
a 
man 
of 
an 
untractable 
wit, 
an 
obstinate 
mind, 
a 
barbaroussoul, 
a 
stubborn 
will,that 
accounting 
all 
men 
else

as 
silly 
sheep, 
would 
have 
his 
Oracles 
preferred 
before 
the 
Senses, 
Experience, 
and 
Nature 
her 
self? 
They 
are 
the 
Sectators 
of 
Aristotle 
that 
have 
given 
him 
this 
Authority,

not 
he 
that 
hath 
usurped 
or 
taken 
it 
upon 
him;

because 
it 
is 
more 
easie 
for 
a 
man 
to 
sculk 
under 
anothers 
shield 
than 
to 
shew 
himself 
openly, 
they 
tremble, 
and 
are 
affraid 
to 
stir 
one 
step 
from 
him;

rather 
than 
they

admit 
some 
alterations

These 
kind 
of 
Drolleries 
put 
me 
in 
mind 
of 
that 
Statuary 
which 
having 
reduced 
a 
great 
piece 
of 
Marble 
to 
the 
Image 
of 
an 
Hercules, 
A 
ridiculous

know 
not 
whether, 
and 
given 
it 
with 
admirable 
Art 
such 
a 
vivacity 
and 
threatning 
fury, 
that 
it 
moved 
terror 
in 
as 
many 
as 
beheld 
it; 
he 
himself 
began 
also 
to 
be 
affraid 
thereof, 
though 
all 
its 
sprightfulnesse, 
and 
life 
was 
his 
own 
workmanship; 
and 
his 
affrightment 
was 
such, 
that 
he 
had 
no 
longer 
the 
courage 
to 
affront 
it 
with 
his 
ChizzelsandMallet. 


SALV. 


I 
have 
many 
times 
wondered 
how 
these 
nice 
maintainers 
of 
what 
ever 
fell 
from 
Aristotle, 
are 
not 
aware 
how 
great 
a

they 
are 
to 
his 
reputation 
and 
credit; 
and 
how 
that 
themore 
they 
goabout

the 
more 
they 
diminish 
it; 
for 
whilest 
I 
see 
them 
obstinate 
in 
their 
attempts 
to 
maintain 
those 
Propositions 
which 
I 
palpably 
discover 
to 
be 
manifestly 
false; 
and 
in 
their 
desires 
to 
perswade 
me 
that 
so 
to 
do, 
is 
the 
part 
of 
a 
Philosopher; 
and 
that 
Aristotle 
himself 
would 
do 
the 
same, 
it 
much 
abates 
in 
me 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
he 
hath 
rightly 
philosophated 
about 
other 
conclusions, 
to 
me 
more 
abstruse: 
for 
if 
I 
could 
see 
them 
concede 
and 
change 
opinion 
in 
a 
manifest 
truth, 
I 
would 
believe,

Or 
when 
they 
should 
be 
made

they 
have 
hazarded 
too 
much 
of 
their 
own 
and 
Aristotle’s 
repuatation 
in 
confessing, 
that 
they 
had 
not 
understood 
this 
or 
that 
conclusion 
found 
out 
by 
some 
other 
man; 
would 
it 
not 
be 
a 
less 
evil 
for 
them 
to 
seek

laying 
many

such

they 
themselves 
cannot

resolve

they 
were

writ 
to 
that 
purpose,

serve 
to 
prove 
that 
assumption

a 
greater 
madnesse, 
they

Leader; 
and 
for 
such, 
it 
is 
better 
that 
they 
stay 
at 
home. 
But 
he 
that 
hath 
eyes 
in 
his 
head, 
and 
in 
his 
mind, 
him 
should 
a 
man 
choose 
for 
his 
Guid. 
Too 
close 
adhering 
to 
Aristotle 
is 
blameable. 
Yet 
mistake 
me 
not, 
thinking 
that 
I 
speak 
this, 
for 
that 
I 
am 
against 
hearing 
of 
Aristotle; 
for 
on 
the 
contrary, 
I 
commend 
the 
reading, 
and 
diligently 
studying 
of 
him; 
and 
onely 
blame 
the 
servile 
giving 
ones 
self 
up 
a 
slave 
unto 
him, 
so, 
as 
blindly 
to 
subscribe 
to 
what 
ever 
he 
delivers, 
and 
without 
search 
of 
any 
farther 
reason 
thereof, 
to 
receive 
the 
same 
for 
an 
inviolable 
decree. 
Which 
is 
an 
abuse, 
that 
carrieth 
with 
it 
another 
great 
inconvenience, 
to 
wit, 
that 
others 
will 
no 
longer 
take 
pains 
to 
understand 
the 
validity 
of 
his 
Demonstrations. 
And 
what 
is 
more 
shameful, 
than 
in 
the 
middest 
of 
publique 
disputes, 
whilest 
one 
person 
is 
treating 
of 
demonstrable 
conclusions, 
to 
hear 
another 
interpose 
with 
a 
passage 
of 
Aristotle, 
and 
not 
seldome 
writ 
to 
quite 
another 
purpose, 
and 
with 
that 
to 
stop 
the 
mouth 
of 
his 
opponent? 
But 
if 
you 
will 
continue 
to 
study 
in 
this 
manner, 
I 
would 
have 
you 
lay 
aside 
the 
name 
of 
Philosophers; 
and 
call 
your 
selves 
either 
Historians 
or 
Doctors 
of 
Memory, 
It 
is 
not 
just, 
that 
those 
who 
never 
philosophate, 
should 
surp 
the 
title 
of 
Philosophers. 
for 
it 
is 
not 
fit, 
that 
those 
who 
never 
philosophate, 
should 
usurp 
the 
honourable 
title 
of 
Philosophers. 
But 
it 
is 
best 
for 
us 
to 
return 
to 
shore, 
and 
not 
lanch 
farther 
into 
a 
boundlesse 
Gulph, 
out 
of 
which 
we 
shall 
not 
be 
able 
to 
get 
before 
night. 
Therefore 
Simplicius, 
come 
either 
with 
arguments 
and 
demonstrations 
of 
your 
own, 
or 
of 
Aristotle, 
and 



bring 
us 
no 
more 
Texts 
and 
naked 
authorities, 
The 
Sensible 
World. 
for 
our 
disputes 
are 
about 
the 
Sensible 
World, 
and 
not 
one 
of 
Paper. 
And 
forasmuch 
as 
in 
our 
discourses 
yesterday, 
we 
retriev’d 
the 
Earth 
from 
darknesse, 
and 
exposed 
it 
to 
the 
open 
skie, 
shewing, 
that 
the 
attempt 
to 
enumerate 
it 
amongst 
those 
which 
we 
call 
Coelestial 
bodies, 
was 
not 
a 
position 
so 
foil’d, 
and 
vanquish’t, 
as 
that 
it 
had 
no 
life 
left 
in 
it; 
it 
followeth 
next, 
that 
we 
proceed 
to 
examine 
what 
probability 
there 
is 
for 
holding 
of 
it 
fixt, 
and 
wholly 
immoveable, 
scilicet 
as 
to 
its 
entire 
Globe, 
what 
likelihood 
there 
is 
for 
making 
it 
moveable 
with 
some 
motion, 
and 
of 
what 
kind 
that 
may 
be. 
And 
forasmuch 
as 
in 
this 
same 
question 
I 
am 
ambiguous, 
and 
Simplicius 
is 
resolute, 
as 
likewise 
Aristotle 
for 
the 
opinion 
of 
its 
immobility, 
he 
shall 
one 
by 
one 
produce 
the 
arguments 
in 
favour 
of 
their 
opinion, 
and 
I 
will 
alledge 
the 
answers 
and 
reasons 
on 
the 
contrary 
part;

I

few 
of

that 
have

SALV. 



Let 
our 
contemplation 
begin 
therefore 
with 
this 
consideration, 
that 
whatsoever 
motion 
may 
be 
ascribed 
to 
the 
Earth, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
it 
be 
to 
us, 
(as 
inhabitants 
upon 
it, 
and 
consequently 
partakers 
of 
the 
same) 
altogether 
imperceptible, 
and 
as 
if 
it 
were 
not 
at 
all, 
so 
long 
as 
we 
have 
regard 
onely 
to 
terrestrial 
things; 
The 
motions 
of 
the 
Earth 
are 
imperceptible 
to 
its 
inhabitants. 
but 
yet 
it 
is 
on 
the 
contrary, 
as 
necessary 
that 
the 
same 
motion 
do 
seem 
common 
to 
all 
other 
bodies, 
and 
visible 
objects, 
that 
being 
separated 
from 
the 
Earth, 
participate 
not 
of 
the 
same. 
So 
that 
the 
true 
method 
to 
find 
whether 
any 
kind 
of 
motion 
may 
be 
ascribed 
to 
the 
Earth, 
and 
that 
found, 
to 
know 
what 
it 
is, 
is 
to 
consider 
and 
observe 
if 
in 
bodies 
separated 
from 
the 
Earth, 
The 
Earth 
can 
have 
no 
other 
motions, 
than 
those 
which 
to 
us 
appear 
commune 
to 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
Vniverse, 
the 
Earth 
excepted. 
one 
may 
discover 
any 
appearance 
of 
motion, 
which 
equally 
suiteth 
to 
all 
the 
rest; 
for 
a 
motion 
that 
is 
onely 
seen, 
v. 
gr. 
in 
the 
Moon, 
and 
that 
hath 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
Venus 
or 
Jupiter, 
or 
any 
other 
Stars, 
cannot 
any 
way 
belong 
to 
the 
Earth, 
or 
to 
any 
other 
save 
the 
Moon 
alone. 
Now 
there 
is 
a 
most 
general 
and 
grand 
motion 
above 
all 
others, 
and 
it 
is 
that 
by 
which 
the 
Sun, 
the 
Moon, 
The 
Diurnal 
Motion, 
seemeth 
commune 
to 
all 
the 
Vniverse, 
save 
onely 
the 
Earth 
excepted. 
the 
other 
Planets, 
and 
the 
Fixed 
Stars, 
and 
in 
a 
word, 
the 
whole 
Universe, 
the 
Earth 
onely 
excepted, 
appeareth 
in 
our 
thinking 
to 
move 
from 
the 
East 
towards 
the 
West, 
in 
the 
space 
of 
twenty 
four 
hours; 
and 
this, 
as 
to 
this 
first 
appearance, 
hath 
no 
obstacle 
to 
hinder 
it, 
that 
it 
may 
not 
belong 
to 
the 
Earth 
alone, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
all 
the 
World 
besides, 
the 
Earth 
excepted; 
for 
the 
same 
aspects 
will 
appear 
in 
the 
one 
position, 
as 
in 
the 
other. 
Hence 
it 
is 
that 
Aristotle 
and 
Ptolomy, 
Aristotle 
and 
Ptolomy 
argue 
against 
the 
Diurnal 
Motion 
attributed 
to 
the 
Earth. 
as 
having 
hit 
upon 
this 
consideration, 
in 
going 
about 
to 
prove 
the 
Earth 
to 
be 
immoveable, 
argue 
not 
against 
any 
other 
than 
this 
Diurnal 
Motion; 
save 
onely 
that 
Aristotle 
hinteth 
something 
in 
obscure 
terms 
against 
another 
Motion 
ascribed 
to 
it 
by 
an 
Ancient, 
of 
which 
we 
shall 
speakinitsplace. 


SAGR. 


I 
very 
well 
perceive 
the 
necessity 
of 
your 
illation: 
but 
I 
meet 
with 
a 
doubt 
which 
I 
know 
not 
how 
to 
free 
my 
self 
from, 
and 
this 
it 
is, 
That 
Copernicus 
assigning 
to 
the 
Earth 
another 
motion 
beside 
the 
Diurnal, 
which, 
according 
to 
the 
rule 
even 
now 
laid 
down, 
ought 
to 
be 
to 
us, 
as 
to 
appearance, 



imperceptible 
in 
the 
Earth, 
but 
visible 
in 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
World; 
me 
thinks 
I 
may 
necessarily 
infer, 
either 
that 
he 
hath 
manifestly 
erred 
in 
assigning 
the 
Earth 
a 
motion, 
to 
which 
there 
appears 
not 
a 
general 
correspondence 
in 
Heaven; 
or 
else 
that 
if 
there 
be 
such 
a 
congruity 
therein, 
Ptolomy 
on 
the 
other 
handhath 
beendeficientinnotconfuting 
this, 
ashehathdone 
the

SALV. 


You 
have 
good 
cause 
for 
your 
doubt: 
and 
when 
we 
come 
to 
treat 
of 
the 
other 
Motion, 
you 
shall 
see 
how 
far 
Copernicus 
excelled 
Ptolomey 
in 
clearness 
and 
sublimity 
of 
wit, 
in 
that 
he 
saw 
what 
the 
other 
did 
not, 
I 
mean 
the 
admirable 
harmony 
wherein 
thatMotion 
agreed 
with 
allthe 
other 
Coelestial 
Bodies. 
But 
for 
the 
present 
we 
will 
suspend 
this 
particular, 
and 
return 
to 
our 
first 
consideration; 
touching 
which 
I 
will 
proceed 
to 
propose 
(beginingwith 
things 
more 
general) 
those 
reasons 
which 
seem 
to 
favour 
the 
mobility 
of 
the 
Earth, 
Why 
the 
diurnal 
motion 
more 
probably 
should 
belong 
to 
the 
Earth, 
than 
to 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
Vniverse. 
and 
then 
wait 
the 
answers 
which 
Simplicius 
shall 
make 
thereto. 
And 
first, 
if 
we 
consider 
onely 
the 
immense 
magnitude 
of 
the 
Starry 
Sphere, 
compared 
to 
the 
smalness 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe, 
contained 
therein 
so 
many 
millions 
of 
times; 
and 
moreover 
weigh 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
motion 
which 
must 
in 
a 
day 
and 
night 
make 
an 
entire 
revolution 
thereof, 
I 
cannot 
perswade 
my 
self, 
that 
there 
is 
any 
man 
who 
believes 
it 
more 
reasonable 
and 
credible, 
that 
the 
Coelestial 
Sphere 
turneth 
round, 
and 
the 
TerrestrialGlobestands 
still. 


SAGR. 


If 
from 
the 
universality 
of 
effects, 
which 
may 
in 
nature 
have 
dependence 
upon 
such 
like 
motions, 
there 
should 
indifferently 
follow 
all 
the 
same 
consequences 
to 
an 
hair, 
aswell 
in 
one 
Hypothesis 
as 
in 
the 
other; 
yet 
I 
for 
my 
part, 
as 
to 
my 
first 
and 
general 
apprehension, 
would 
esteem, 
that 
he 
which 
should 
hold 
it 
more 
rational 
to 
make 
the 
whole 
Universe 
move, 
and 
thereby 
to 
salve 
the 
Earths 
mobility, 
is 
more 
unreasonable 
than 
he 
that 
being 
got 
to 
the 
top 
of 
your 
Turret, 
should 
desire, 
to 
the 
end 
onely 
that 
he 
might 
behold 
the 
City, 
and 
the 
Fields 
about 
it, 
that 
the 
whole 
Country 
might 
turn 
round, 
that 
so 
he 
might 
not 
be 
put 
to 
the 
trouble 
to 
stir 
his 
head. 
And 
yet 
doubtless 
the 
advantages 
would 
be 
many 
and 
great 
which 
the 
Copernican 
Hypothesis 
is 
attended 
with, 
above 
those 
of 
the 
Ptolomaique, 
which 
in 
my 



opinion 
resembleth, 
nay 
surpasseth 
that 
other 
folly; 
so 
that 
all 
this 
makes 
me 
think 
that 
far 
more 
probable 
than 
this. 
But 
haply 
Aristotle 
Ptolomey, 
and 
Simplicius 
may 
find 
the 
advantages 
of 
their 
Systeme, 
which 
they 
would 
do 
well 
to 
communicate 
to 
us 
also, 
if 
any 
such 
there 
be; 
or 
else 
declare 
to 
me, 
that 
there 
neither 
areorcanbe 
anysuchthings. 


SALV. 


For 
my 
part, 
as 
I 
have 
not 
been 
able, 
as 
much 
as 
I 
have 
thought 
upon 
it, 
to 
find 
any 
diversity 
therein; 
so 
I 
think 
I 
have 
found, 
that 
no 
such 
diversity 
can 
be 
in 
them: 
in 
so 
much 
that 
I 
esteem 
it 
to 
no 
purpose 
to 
seek 
farther 
after 
it. 
Motion, 
as 
tothe 
things 
that 
equallymovethereby, 
is 
as 
if 
it 
never 
were,&so 
far 
operates 
as 
it 
hath 
relation 
to 
things 
deprived 
of 
motion. 
Therefore 
observe: 
Motion 
is 
so 
far 
Motion, 
and 
as 
Motion 
operateth, 
by 
how 
far 
it 
hath 
relation 
to 
things 
which 
want 
Motion: 
but 
in 
those 
things 
which 
all 
equally 
partake 
thereof 
it 
hath 
nothing 
to 
do, 
and 
is 
as 
if 
it 
never 
were. 
And 
thus 
the 
Merchandises 
with 
which 
a 
ship 
is 
laden, 
so 
far 
move, 
by 
how 
far 
leaving 
London, 
they 
pass 
by 
France, 
Spain, 
Italy, 
and 
sail 
to 
Aleppo, 
which 
London, 
France, 
Spain 
&c. 
stand 
still, 
not 
moving 
with 
the 
ship: 
but 
as 
to 
the 
Chests, 
Bales 
and 
other 
Parcels, 
wherewith 
the 
ship 
is 
stow’d 
and 
and 
laden, 
and 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
ship 
it 
self, 
the 
Motion 
from 
London 
to 
Syria 
is 
as 
much 
as 
nothing; 
and 
nothing-altereth 
the 
relation 
which 
is 
between 
them: 
and 
this, 
because 
it 
is 
common 
to 
all, 
and 
is 
participated 
by 
all 
alike: 
and 
of 
the 
Cargo 
which 
is 
in 
the 
ship, 
if 
a 
Bale 
were 
romag’d 
from 
a 
Chest 
but 
one 
inch 
onely, 
this 
alone 
would 
be 
in 
that 
Cargo, 
a 
greater 
Motion 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
Chest, 
than 
the 
whole 
Voyage 
of 
above 
three 
thousand 
miles, 
made

I 
hold 
it 
to 
be 
much 
more 
antient: 
A 
proposition 
taken 
by 
Aristotle 
from 
the 
Antients,but 
somewhataltered 
by 
him. 
andsuspect 
thatAristotle 
in 
receiving 
it 
from 
some 
good 
School, 
did 
not 
fully 
understand 
it, 
and 
that 
therefore, 
having 
delivered 
it 
with 
some 
alteration, 
it 
hath 
been 
an 
occasion 
of 



confusion 
amongst 
those, 
who 
would 
defend 
whatever 
he 
saith. 
And 
when 
he 
writ, 
that 
whatsoever 
moveth, 
doth 
move 
upon 
something 
immoveable, 
I 
suppose 
that 
he 
equivocated, 
and 
meant, 
that 
whatever 
moveth, 
moveth 
in 
respect 
to 
something 
immoveable; 
which 
proposition 
admitteth 
no 
doubt,

It 
being 
therefore 
manifest, 
The 
first 
discourse 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
diurnal 
motion 
belongs 
to 
the 
Earth. 
that 
the 
motion 
which 
is 
common 
to 
many 
moveables, 
is 
idle, 
and 
as 
it 
were, 
null 
as 
to 
the 
relation 
of 
those 
moveables 
between 
themselves, 
because 
that 
among 
themselves 
they 
have 
made 
no 
change: 
and 
that 
it 
is 
operative 
onely 
in 
the 
relation 
that 
those 
moveables 
have 
to 
other 
things, 
which 
want 
that 
motion, 
among 
which 
the 
habitude 
is 
changed: 
and 
we 
having 
divided 
the 
Universe 
into 
two 
parts, 
one 
of 
which 
is 
necessarily 
moveable, 
and 
the 
other 
immoveable; 
for 
the 
obtaining 
of 
whatsoever 
may 
depend 
upon, 
or 
be 
required 
from 
such 
a 
motion, 
it 
may 
as 
well 
be 
done 
by 
making 
the 
Earth 
alone, 
as 
by 
making 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
World 
to 
move: 
for 
that 
the 
operation 
of 
such 
a 
motion 
consists 
in 
nothing 
else, 
save 
in 
the 
relation 
or 
habitude 
which 
is 
between 
the 
Coelestial 
Bodies, 
and 
the 
Earth, 
the 
which 
relation 
is 
all 
that 
is 
changed. 
Now 
if 
for 
the 
obtaining 
of 
the 
same 
effect 
ad 
unguem, 
it 
be 
all 
one 
whether 
the 
Earth 
alone 
moveth, 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
Universe 
standing 
still; 
Nature 
never 
doth 
that 
by 
many 
things, 
which 
may 
be 
done 
by 
a 
few. 
or 
that, 
the 
Earth 
onely 
standing 
still, 
the 
whole 
Universe 
moveth 
with 
one 
and 
the 
same 
motion; 
who 
would 
believe, 
that 
Nature 
(which 
by 
common 
consent, 
doth 
not 
that 
by 
many 
things, 
which 
may 
be 
done 
by 
few) 
hath 
chosen 
to 
make 
an 
innumerable 
number 
of 
most 
vast 
bodies 
move, 
and 
that 
with 
an 
unconceivable 
velocity, 
to 
perform 
that, 
which 
might 
be 
done 
by 
the 
moderate 
motion 
of 
one 
alone 
aboutitsown 
Centre? 


SIMPL. 



I 
do 
not 
well 
understand, 
how 
this 
grand 
motion 
signifieth 
nothing 
as 
to 
the 
Sun, 
as 
to 
the 
Moon, 
as 
to 
the 
other 
Planets, 
and 
as 
to 
the 
innumerable 
multitude 
of 
fixed 
stars: 
or 
why 
you 
should 
say 
that 
it 
is 
to 
no 
purpose 
for 
the 
Sun 
to 
pass 
from 
one 
Meridian 
to 
another; 
to 
rise 
above 
this 
Horizon, 
to 
set 
beneath 
that 
other; 
to 
make 
it 
one 
while 
day, 
another 
while 
night: 
the 
like 
variations 
are 
made 
by 
the 
Moon, 
the 
other 
Planets, 
and 
the 
fixed 
stars 
themselves. 


SALV. 


All 
these 
alterations 
instanced 
by 
you, 
are 
nothing, 
save 
onely 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
Earth: 
and 
that 
this 
is 
true, 
do 
but 
imagine 
the 
Earth 
to 
move, 
The 
diurnal 
motion 
causeth 
no 
mutation 
amongst 
the 
Coelestial 
Bodies, 
but 
all 
changes 
have 
relation 
to 
the 
Earth. 
and 
there 
will 
be 
no 
such 
thing 
in 
the 
World 
as 
the 
rising 
or 
setting 
of 
the 
Sun 
or 
Moon, 
nor 
Horizons, 
nor 
Meridians, 
nor 
days, 
nor 
nights; 
nor, 
in 
a 
word, 
will 
such 
a 
motion 
cause 
any 
mutation 
between 
the 
Moonand 
Sun, 
orany 
other 
starwhatsoever,whetherfixedorerratick;butall 
these 
changes 
have 
relation 
to 
the 
Earth: 
which 
all 
do 
yet 
in 
sum 
import 
no 
other 
than 
as 
if 
the 
Sun 
should 
shew 
it 
self 
now 
to 
China, 
anon 
to 
Persia, 
then 
to 
Egypt, 
Greece, 
France, 
Spain, 
America, 
&c. 
and 
the 
like 
holdeth 
in 
the 
Moon, 
and 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
Coelestial 
Bodies: 
which 
self 
same 
effect 
falls 
out 
exactly 
in 
the 
same 
manner, 
if, 
without 
troubling 
so 
great 
a 
part 
of 
the 
Universe, 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
be 
made 
to 
revolve 
in 
it 
self. 
A 
second 
confirmation 
that 
the 
diurnal 
motion 
belongs 
to 
the 
Earth. 
But 
we 
will 
augment 
the 
difficulty 
by 
the 
addition 
of 
this 
other, 
which 
is 
a 
very 
great 
one, 
namely, 
that 
if 
you 
will 
ascribe 
this 
Great 
Motion 
to 
Heaven, 
you 
must 
of 
necessity 
make 
it 
contrary 
to 
the 
particular 
motion 
of 
all 
the 
Orbs 
of 
the 
Planets, 
each 
of 
which 
without 
controversie 
hath 
its 
peculiar 
motion 
from 
the 
West 
towards 
the 
East, 
and 
this 
but 
very 
easie 
and 
moderate: 
and 
then 
you 
make 
them 
to 
be 
hurried 
to 
the 
contrary 
part, 
i. 
e. 
from 
East 
to 
West, 
by 
this 
most 
furious 
diurnal 
motion: 
whereas, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
making 
the 
Earth 
to 
move 
in 
it 
self, 
the 
contrariety 
of 
motions 
is 
taken 
away, 
and 
the 
onely 
motion 
from 
West 
to 
East 
is 
accommodated 
to 
all 
appearances, 
and 
exactly 
satisfietheveryPhoenomenon.

As 
to 
the 
contrariety 
of 
Motions 
it 
would 
import 
little, 
Circular 
motions 
are 
not 
contrary, 
according 
to 
Aristotle. 
for 
Aristotle 
demonstrateth, 
that 
circular 
motions, 
are 
not 
contrary 
to 
one 
another; 
and 
that 
theirs 
cannot 
be 
truly 
called 
contrariety. 


SALV. 


Doth 
Aristotle 
demonstrate 
this, 
or 
doth 
he 
not 
rather 
barely 
affirm 
it, 
as 
serving 
to 
some 
certain 
design 
of 
his? 
If 
contraries 
be 
those 
things, 
that 
destroy 
one 
another, 
as 
he 
himself 
affirmeth, 
I 
do 
not 
see 
how 
two 
moveables 
that 
encounter 
each 
other 
in 
a 
circular 
line, 
should 
lesse 
prejudice 
one 
another,than

SAGR. 


Hold 
a 
little, 
I 
pray 
you. 
Tell 
me 
Simplicius, 
when 
two 
Knights 
encounter 
each 
other, 
tilting 
in 
open 
field, 
or 
when 
two 
whole 
Squadrons, 
or 
two 
Fleets 
at 
Sea, 
make 
up 
to 
grapple, 
and 
are 
broken 
and 
sunk, 
do 
you 
call 
these 
encounters 
contraryto 
oneanother? 


SIMPL. 


Yes,wesay

SAGR. 


How 
then, 
is 
there 
no 
contrariety 
in 
circular 
motions. 
These 
motions, 
being 
made 
upon 
the 
superficies 
of 
the 
Earth 
or 
Water, 
which 
are, 
as 
you 
know, 
spherical, 
come 
to 
be 
circular. 
Can 
you 
tell, 
Simplicius, 
which 
those 
circular 
motions 
be, 
that 
are 
not 
contrary 
to 
each 
other? 
They 
are 
(if 
I 
mistake 
not) 
those 
of 
two 
circles, 
which 
touching

But 
be 
they 
contrary, 
or 
not 
contrary, 
these 
are 
but 
alterations 
of 
words; 
and 
I 
know, 
that 
upon 
the 
matter, 
it 
would 
be 
far 
more 
proper 
and 
agreeable 
with 
Nature, 
if 
we 
could 
salve 
all 
with 
one 
motion 
onely, 
than 
to 
introduce 
two 
that 
are 
(if 
you 
will 
not 
call 
them 
contrary) 
opposite; 
yet 
do 
I 
not 
censure 
this 
introduction 
(of 
contrary 
motions) 
as 
impossible; 
nor 
pretend 
I 
from 
the 
denial 
thereof, 
to 
inferre 
a 
necessary 
Demonstration, 
but 
onely 
a 
greater 
probability, 
A 
third 
confirmation 
of 
the 
same 
Doctrine. 
of 
the 
other. 
A 
third 
reason 
which 
maketh 
the 
Ptolomaique 
Hypothesis 
lesse 
probable 
is, 
that 
it 
most 
unreasonably 
confoundeth 
the 
order, 
which 
we 
assuredly 
see 
to 
be 
amongst 
those 
Coelestial 
Bodies, 
the 
circumgyration 
of 
which 
is 
not 
questionable, 
The 
greater 
Orbs 
make 
their 
conversions 
in 
greater 
times. 
but 
most 
certain. 
And 
that 
Order 
is, 
that 
according 
as 
an 
Orb 
is 
greater, 
it 
finisheth 
its 
revolution 
in 
a 
longer 
time, 
and 
the 
lesser, 
in 
shorter. 
And 
thus 
Saturn 
describing 
a 
greater 
Circle 
than 
all 
the 
other 
Planets, 
compleateth 
the 
same 
in 
thirty 
yeares: 
Jupiter 
finisheth 
his; 
that 
is 
lesse, 
in 
twelve 
years: 
Mars 
in 
two: 
The 
Moon 
runneth 
thorow 
hers, 
so 
much 
lesse 
than 
the 
rest, 
in 
a 
Moneth 
onely. 
Nor 
do 
we 
lesse 
sensibly 
see 
that 
of 
the 
Medicean 
Stars, 
The 
times 
of 
the 
Medicean 
Planets 
conversions. 
which 
is 
nearest 
to 
Jupiter, 
to 
make 
its 
revolution 
in 
a 
very 
short 
time, 
that 
is, 
in 
four 
and 
forty 
hours, 
or 
thereabouts, 
the 
next 
to 
that 
in 
three 
dayes 
and 
an 
half, 
the 
third 
in 
seven 
dayes, 
and 
the 
most 
remote 
in 
sixteen. 
And 
this 
rate 
holdeth 
well 
enough, 
nor 
will 
it 
at 
all 
alter, 
whilest 
we 
assign 
the 
motion 
of 
24 
hours 
to 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe, 
for 
it 
to 
move 
round 
its 
own 
center 
in 
that 
time; 
but 
if 
you 
would 
have 
the 
Earth 
immoveable, 
it 
is 
necessary, 
that 
when 
you 
have 
past 
from 
the 
short 
period 
of 
the 
Moon, 
to 
the 
others 
successively 
bigger, 
until 
you 
come 
to 
that 
of 
Mars 
in 
two 
years, 
and 
from 
thence 
to 
that 
of 
the 
bigger 
Sphere 
of 
Jupiter 
in 
twelve 
years, 
and 
from 
this 
to 
the 
other 
yet 
bigger 
of 
Saturn, 
whose 
period 
is 
of 
thirty 
years, 
it 
is 
necessary, 
I 
say, 
that 
you 
passe 
to 
another 
Sphere 
incomparably 
greater 
still 
than 
that, 
and 
make 
this 
to 
accomplish 
an 
entire 
revolution 
in 
twenty 
four 
hours. 
The 
motion 
of 
24 
hours 
ascribed 
to 
the 
highest 
Sphere 
disorders 
the 
period 
of 
the 
inferiour. 
And 
this 
yet 
is 
the 
least 
disorder 
that 
can 
follow. 
For 
if 
any 
one 
should 
passe 
from 
the 
Sphere 
of 
Saturn 
to 
the 
Starry 
Orb, 
and 
make 
it 
so 
much 
bigger 
than 
that 
of 
Saturn, 
as 
proportion 
would 
require, 
in 
respect 
of 
its 
very 
slow 
motion, 
of 
many 
thousands 
of 
years, 
then 
it 
must 
needs 
be 
a 
Salt 
much 
more 
absurd, 
to 
skip 
from 
this 
to 
another 
bigger, 
and 
to 
make 
it 
convertible 
in 
twenty 
four 
hours. 
But 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth 
being 
granted, 
the 
order 
of 
the 
periods 
will 
be 



exactly 
observed, 
and 
from 
the 
very 
slow 
Sphere 
of 
Saturn, 
we 
come 
to 
the 
fixed 
Stars, 
which 
are 
wholly 
immoveable, 
The 
fourth 
Confirmation. 
and 
so 
avoid 
a 
fourth 
difficulty, 
which 
we 
must 
of 
necessity 
admit, 
if 
the 
Starry 
Sphere 
be 
supposed 
moveable, 
and 
that 
is 
the 
immense 
disparity 
between 
the 
motions 
of 
those 
stars 
themselves; 
Great 
disparity 
amongst 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
particular 
fixed 
stars, 
if 
their 
Sphere 
be 
moveable. 
of 
which 
some 
would 
come 
to 
move 
most 
swiftly 
in 
most 
vast 
circles, 
others 
most 
slowly 
in 
circles 
very 
small, 
according 
as 
those 
or 
these 
should 
be 
found 
nearer, 
or 
more 
remote 
from 
the 
Poles; 
which 
still 
is 
accompanied 
with 
an 
inconvenience, 
as 
well 
because 
we 
see 
those, 
of 
whose 
motion 
there 
is 
no 
question 
to 
be 
made, 
to 
move 
all 
in 
very 
immense 
circles; 
as 
also, 
because 
it 
seems 
to 
be 
an 
act 
done 
with 
no 
good 
consideration, 
to 
constitute 
bodies, 
that 
are 
designed 
to 
move 
circularly, 
at 
immense 
distances 
from 
the 
centre, 
and 
afterwards 
to 
make 
them 
move 
in 
very 
small 
circles. 
And 
not 
onely 
the 
magnitudes 
of 
the 
circles, 
and 
consequently 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
motions 
of 
these 
Stars, 
shall 
be 
most 
different 
from 
the 
circles 
and 
motions 
of 
those 
others, 
The 
fifth 
Confirmation. 
but 
(which 
shallbe 
the 
fifth 
inconvenience) 
theself-same 
Stars 
shall 
successively 
vary 
its 
circles 
and 
velocities: 
The 
motions 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars 
would 
accelerate 
and 
grow 
slow 
in 
divers 
times, 
if 
the 
starry 
Sphere 
were 
moueable. 
For 
that 
those, 
which 
two 
thousand 
years 
since 
were 
in 
the 
Equinoctial, 
and 
consequently 
did 
with 
their 
motion 
describe 
very 
vast 
circles, 
being 
in 
our 
dayes 
many 
degrees 
distant 
from 
thence, 
must 
of 
necessity 
become 
more 
slow 
of 
motion, 
and 
be 
reduced 
to 
move 
in 
lesser 
circles, 
and 
it 
is 
not 
altogether 
impossible 
but 
that 
a 
time 
may 
come, 
in 
which 
some 
of 
them 
which 
in 
aforetime 
had 
continually 
moved, 
shall 
be 
reduced 
by 
uniting 
with 
the 
Pole, 
to 
a 
state 
of 
rest, 
and 
then 
after 
some 
time 
of 
cessation, 
shall 
return 
to 
their 
motion 
again; 
whereas 
the 
other 
Stars, 
touching 
whose 
motion 
none 
stand 
in 
doubt, 
do 
all 
describe, 
as 
hath 
been 
said, 
the 
great 
circle 
of 
their 
Orb, 
and 
in 
that 
maintain 
themselves 
without 
any 
variation. 
The 
sixth 
Confirmation. 
The 
absurdity 
is 
farther 
enlarged 
(which 
let 
be 
the 
sixth 
inconvenience) 
to 
him 
that 
more 
seriously 
examineth 
the 
thing, 
in 
that 
no 
thought 
can 
comprehend 
what 
ought 
to 
be 
the 
solidity 
of 
that 
immense 
Sphere, 
whose 
depth 
so 
stedfastly 
holdeth 
fast 
such 
a 
multitude 
of 
Stars, 
which 
without 
ever 
changing 
site 
among 
themselves, 
are 
with 
so 
much 
concord 
carried 
about, 
with 
so 
great 
disparity 
of 
motions. 
Or 
else, 
supposing 
the 
Heavens 
to 
be 
fluid, 
as 
we 
are 
with 
more 
reason 
to 
believe, 
so 
as 
that 
every 
Star 
wandereth 
to 
and 
fro 
in 
it, 
by 
wayes 
of 
its 
own, 
what 
rules 
shall 



regulate 
their 
motions, 
and 
to 
what 
purpose, 
so, 
as 
that 
being 
beheld 
from 
the 
Earth, 
they 
appear 
as 
if 
they 
were 
made 
by 
one 
onely 
Sphere? 
It 
is 
my 
opinion, 
that 
they 
might 
so 
much 
more 
easily 
do 
that, 
and 
in 
a 
more 
commodious 
manner, 
by 
being 
constituted 
immoveable, 
than 
by 
being 
made 
errant, 
by 
how 
much 
more 
facile 
it 
is 
to 
number 
the 
quarries 
in 
the 
Pavement 
of 
a 
Piazza, 
than 
the 
rout 
of 
boyes 
which 
run 
up 
and 
down 
upon 
them. 
The 
Seventh 
Confirmation. 
And 
lastly, 
which 
is 
the 
seventh 
instance, 
if 
we 
attribute 
the 
Diurnal 
Motion 
to 
the 
highest 
Heaven, 
it 
must 
be 
constituted 
of 
such 
a 
force 
and 
efficacy, 
as 
to 
carry 
along 
with 
it 
the 
innumerable 
multitude 
of 
fixed 
Stars, 
Bodies 
all 
of 
vast 
magnitude, 
and 
far 
bigger 
than 
the 
Earth; 
and 
moreover 
all 
the 
Spheres 
of 
the 
Planets; 
notwithstanding 
that 
both 
these 
and 
those 
of 
their 
own 
nature 
move 
the 
contrary 
way. 
And 
besides 
all 
this, 
it 
must 
be 
granted, 
that 
also 
the 
Element 
of 
Fire, 
and 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
Air, 
are 
likewise 
forcibly 
hurried 
along 
with 
the 
rest, 
and 
that 
the 
sole 
little 
Globe 
of 
the 
Earth 
pertinaciously 
stands 
still, 
and 
unmoved 
against 
such 
an 
impulse; 
a 
thing, 
which 
in 
my 
thinking, 
is 
very 
difficult; 
nor 
can 
I 
see 
how 
the 
Earth, 
a 
pendent 
body, 
The 
Earth 
a 
pendent 
Body, 
and 
equilibrated 
in 
a 
fluid 
Medium 
seems 
unable 
to 
resist 
the 
rapture 
of 
the 
Diurnal 
Motion. 
and 
equilibrated 
upon 
its 
centre, 
exposed 
indifferently 
to 
either 
motion 
or 
rest, 
and 
environed 
with 
a 
liquid 
ambient, 
should 
not 
yield 
also 
as 
the 
rest, 
and 
be 
carried 
about. 
But 
we 
find 
none 
of 
these 
obstacles 
in 
making 
the 
Earth 
to 
move; 
a 
small 
body, 
and 
insensible, 
compared 
to 
the 
Universe, 
and 
therefore 
unable 
to 
offer 
it 
anyviolence. 


SAGR. 


I 
find 
my 
fancy 
disturbed 
with 
certain 
conjectures 
so 
confusedly 
sprung 
from 
your 
later 
discourses; 
that, 
if 
I 
would 
be 
enabled 
to 
apply 
my 
self 
with 
atention 
to 
what 
followeth, 
I 
must 
of 
necessity 
attempt 
whether 
I 
can 
better 
methodize 
them, 
and 
gather 
thence 
their 
true 
construction,ifhaply 
any 
canbe 
made 
of 
them; 
and 
peradventure, 
the 
proceeding 
by 
interrogations 
may 
help 
me 
the 
more 
easily 
to 
expresse 
my 
self. 
Therefore 
I 
demand 
first 
of 
Simplicius, 
whether 
he 
believeth, 
that 
divers 
motions 
may 
naturally 
agree 
to 
one 
and 
the 
same 
moveable 
body, 
or 
else 
that 
it 
be 
requisite 
its 
natural 
and 
propermotion 
beonelyone. 


SIMPL. 



To 
one 
single 
moveable, 
A 
single 
moveable 
hath 
but 
onely 
one 
natural 
motion, 
and 
all 
the 
rest 
are 
by 
participation. 
there 
can 
naturally 
agree 
but 
one 
sole 
motion, 
and 
no 
more; 
the 
rest 
all 
happen 
accidentally 
and 
by 
participation; 
like 
as 
to 
him 
that 
walketh 
upon 
the 
Deck 
of 
a 
Ship, 
his 
proper 
motion 
is 
that 
of 
his 
walk, 
his 
motion 
by 
participation 
that 
which 
carrieth 
him 
tohisPort,whitherhe 
wouldneverwithhiswalkinghavearrived,iftheShip 
withits 
motionhad 
notwafted 
himthither. 


SAGR. 


Tell 
me 
secondly. 
That 
motion, 
which 
is 
communicated 
to 
any 
moveable 
by 
participation, 
whilest 
it 
moveth 
by 
it 
self, 
with 
another 
motion 
different 
from 
the 
participated, 
is 
it 
necessary, 
that 
it 
do 
reside 
in 
some 
certain 
subject 
by 
it 
self,orelse 
canitsubsistinnaturealone,withoutothersupport. 


SIMPL. 


Aristotle 
giveth 
you 
an 
answer 
to 
all 
these 
questions, 
Motion 
cannot 
be 
made 
without 
its 
moveable 
subject. 
and 
tels 
you, 
that 
as 
of 
one 
sole 
moveable 
the 
motion 
is 
but 
one; 
so 
of 
one 
sole 
motion 
the 
moveable 
is 
but 
one; 
and 
consequently, 
that 
without 
the 
inherence 
in 
its 
subject, 
no 
motion 
can 
either 
subsist, 
orbeimagined. 


SAGR. 


I 
would 
have 
you 
tell 
me 
in 
the 
third 
place, 
whether 
you 
beblieve 
that 
the 
Moon 
and 
the 
other 
Planets 
and 
Coelestial 
bodies, 
have 
their 
proper 
motions, 
and 
whattheyare. 


SIMPL. 


They 
have 
so, 
and 
they 
be 
those 
according 
to 
which 
they 
run 
through 
the 
Zodiack, 
the 
Moon 
in 
a 
Moneth, 
the 
Sun 
in 
a 
Year, 
Mars 
in 
two, 
the 
Starry 
Sphere 
in 
those 
so 
many 
thousand. 
And 
these 
are 
their 
proper, 
or 
natural 
motions. 


SAGR. 



But 
that 
motion 
wherewith 
I 
see 
the 
fixed 
Stars, 
and 
with 
them 
all 
the 
Planets 
go 
unitedly 
from 
East 
to 
West, 
and 
return 
round 
to 
the

again 
in

fourhours,

This 
then

not 
in

and 
not 
residing 
in 
them, 
nor 
being 
able 
to 
subsist 
without 
some 
subject 
in 
which 
it 
is 
resident, 
it 
must 
of 
force 
be 
the 
properandnaturalmotion 
ofsomeotherSphere. 


SIMPL. 


For 
this 
purpose 
Astronomers, 
and 
Philosophers 
have 
found 
another 
high 
Sphere, 
above 
all 
the 
rest, 
without 
Stars, 
to 
which 
Natural 
agreeth 
the 
Diurnal 
Motion; 
and 
this 
they 
call 
the 
Primum 
mobile; 
the 
which 
carrieth 
along 
with 
it 
all 
the 
inferiourSpheres,contributingand 
imparting 
itsmotionto 
them. 


SAGR. 


But 
when, 
without 
introducing 
other 
Spheres 
unknown 
and 
hugely 
vast, 
without 
other 
motions 
or 
communicated 
raptures, 
with 
leaving 
to 
each 
Sphere 
its 
sole 
and 
simple 
motion, 
without 
intermixing 
contrary 
motions, 
but 
making 
all 
turn 
one 
way, 
as 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
they 
do, 
depending 
all 
upon 
one 
sole 
principle, 
all 
things 
proceed 
orderly, 
and 
correspond 
with 
most 
perfect 
harmony, 
why 
do 
we 
reject 
this

In 
my 
judgment 
this 
is 
found. 
Make 
the 
Earth 
the 
Primum 
mobile, 
that 
is, 
make 
it 
turn 
round 
its 
own 
axis 
in 
twenty 
four 
hours, 
and 
towards 
the 
same 



point 
with 
all 
the 
other 
Spheres; 
and 
without 
participating 
this 
same 
motion 
to 
any 
other 
Planet 
or 
Star, 
all 
shall 
have 
their 
risings,

in 
a

SIMPL. 


The 
business 
is, 
to 
be 
able 
to 
make 
the 
Earth 
move 
without 
a 
thousand 
inconveniences. 


SALV. 


All 
the 
inconveniences 
shall 
be 
removed 
as 
fast 
as 
you 
propound 
them: 
and 
the 
things 
spoken 
hitherto 
are 
onely 
the 
primary 
and 
more 
general 
inducements 
which 
give 
us 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
diurnal 
conversion 
may 
not 
altogether 
without 
probability 
be 
applyed 
to 
the 
Earth, 
rather 
than 
to 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
Universe: 
the 
which 
inducements 
I 
impose 
not 
upon 
you 
as 
inviolable 
Axioms, 
but 
as 
hints, 
which 
carry 
with 
them 
somewhat 
of 
likelihood. 
One 
single 
experiment, 
or 
sound 
demonstration 
batereth 
down 
all 
arguments 
meerly 
probable. 
And 
in 
regard 
I 
know 
very 
well, 
that 
one 
sole 
experiment, 
or 
concludent 
demonstration, 
produced 
on 
the 
contrary 
part, 
sufficeth 
to 
batter 
to 
the 
ground 
these 
and 
a 
thousand 
other 
probable 
Arguments; 
therefore 
it 
is 
not 
fit 
to 
stay 
here, 
but 
proceed 
forwards 
and 
hear 
what 
Simplicius 
answereth, 
and 
what 
greater 
probabilities, 
or 
stronger 
arguments 
healledgethonthecontrary. 


SIMPL. 


I 
will 
first 
say 
something 
in 
general 
upon 
all 
these 
considerations 
together, 
and 
then 
I 
will 
descend 
to 
some 
particulars. 
It 
seems 
that 
you 
universally 
bottom 
all 
you 
say 
upon 
the 
greater 
simplicity 
and 
facility 
of 
producing 
the 
same 
effects, 
whilst 
you 
hold, 
that 
as 
to 
the 
causing 
of 
them, 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth 
alone, 
serveth 
as 
well 
as 
that 
of 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
World, 
the 
Earth 
deducted: 
but 
as 
to 
the 
operations, 
you 
esteem 
that 
much 
easier 
than 
this. 
To 
which 
I 
reply, 
that 
I 
am 
also 
of 
the 
same 
opinion, 
so 
long 
as 
I 
regard 
my 
own 
not 
onely 
finite, 
but 
feeble 
power; 
but 
having 
a 
respect 
to 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
Mover, 
which 
is 
infinite, 
its 
no 
lesse 
easie 
to 
move 
the 
Universe, 
than 
the 
Earth, 
yea 
than 
a 
straw. 
And 
if 
his 
power 
be 
infinite, 
Of 
an 
infinite 
power 
one 
would 
think 
a 
greater 
part 
should 
rather 
be 
imploy’d 
than 
a 
lesse. 
why 
should 



he 
not 
rather 
exercise 
a 
greater 
part 
thereof 
than 
a 
lesse? 
Therefore, 
I 
hold 
that 
yourdiscoursein 
generalisnotconvincing. 


SALV. 


If 
I 
had 
at 
any 
time 
said, 
that 
the 
Universe 
moved 
not 
for 
want 
of 
power 
in 
the 
Mover, 
I 
should 
have 
erred, 
and 
your 
reproof 
would 
have 
been 
seasonable; 
and 
I 
grant 
you, 
that 
to 
an 
infinite 
power, 
it 
is 
as 
easie 
to 
move 
an 
hundred 
thousand, 
as 
one. 
But 
that 
which 
I 
did 
say, 
concerns 
not 
the 
Mover, 
but 
onely 
hath 
respect 
to 
the 
Moveables; 
and 
in 
them, 
not 
onely 
to 
their 
resistance,which 
doubtlesse 
is 
lesser 
in 
theEarth, 
than 
in 
the 
Universe; 
but 
to 
the 
many 
other 
particulars, 
but 
even 
now 
considered. 
As 
to 
what 
you 
say 
in 
the 
next 
place, 
that 
of 
an 
infinite 
power 
it 
is 
better 
to 
exercise 
a 
great 
part 
than 
a 
small: 
I 
answer, 
that 
of 
infinite 
one 
part 
is 
not 
greater 
than 
another, 
since 
both 
are 
infinite; 
Of 
infinity, 
one 
part 
is 
no 
bigger 
than 
another, 
although 
they 
are 
comparatively 
unequal. 
nor 
can 
it 
be 
said, 
that 
of 
the 
infinite 
number, 
an 
hundred 
thousand 
is 
a 
greater 
part 
than 
two, 
though 
that 
be 
fifty 
thousand 
times 
greater 
than 
this; 
and 
if 
to 
the 
moving 
of 
the 
Universe 
there 
be 
required 
a 
finite 
power, 
though 
very 
great 
in 
comparison 
of 
that 
which 
sufficeth 
to 
move 
the 
Earth 
onely; 
yet 
is 
there 
not 
implied 
therein 
a 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
infinite 
power, 
nor 
is 
that 
part 
lesse 
infinite 
which 
remaineth 
unimploy’d. 
So 
that 
to 
apply 
unto 
a 
particular 
effect, 
a 
little 
more, 
or 
a 
little 
lesse 
power, 
importeth 
nothing; 
besides 
that 
the 
operation 
of 
such 
vertue, 
hath 
not 
for 
its 
bound 
or 
end 
the 
Diurnal 
Motion 
onely; 
but 
there 
are 
severalothermotionsintheWorld,which 
we 
know 
of,andmany 
othersthere 
may 
be, 
that 
are 
to 
us 
unknown. 
Therefore 
if 
we 
respect 
the 
Moveables, 
and 
granting 
it 
as 
out 
of 
question, 
that 
it 
is 
a 
shorter 
and 
easier 
way 
to 
move 
the 
Earth, 
than 
the 
Universe; 
and 
moreover, 
having 
an 
eye 
to 
the 
so 
many 
other 
abreviations, 
and 
facilities 
that 
onely 
this 
way 
are 
to 
be 
obtained, 
an 
infallible 
Maxime 
of 
Aristotle, 
which 
he 
teacheth 
us, 
that, 
frustra 
fit 
per 
plura, 
quod 
potest 
fieri 
per 
pauciora, 
rendereth 
it 
more 
probable 
that 
the 
Diurnal 
Motion 
belongstotheEarthalone,than 
totheUniverse,theEarthsubducted. 


SIMPL. 


In 
reciting 
that 
Axiom, 
you 
have 
omitted 
a 
small 
clause, 
which 
importeth 
as 
much 
as 
all 
the 
rest, 
especially 
in 
our 
case, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
words 
aequè 



bene. 
It 
is 
requisite 
therefore 
to 
examine 
whether 
this 
Hypothesis 
doth 
equallywellsatisfieinallparticulars, 
astheother. 


SALV. 


The 
knowledg 
whether 
both 
these 
positions 
do 
aequè 
bene, 
satisfie, 
may 
be 
comprehendedfromtheparticularexamination 
oftheappearances 
whichthey 
are 
to 
satisfie; 
for 
hitherto 
we 
have 
discoursed, 
and 
will 
continue 
to 
argue 
ex 
hypothesi, 
namely, 
supposing, 
that 
as 
to 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
the 
appearances, 
both 
the 
assumptions 
are 
equally 
accomodated. 
In 
the 
Axiome 
Frustra 
fit 
per 
plura, 
&c. 
the 
addition 
of 
aeque 
benè, 
is 
superfluous. 
As 
to 
the 
clause 
which 
you 
say 
was 
omitted 
by 
me, 
I 
have 
more 
reason 
to 
suspect 
that 
it 
was 
superfluously 
inserted 
by 
you. 
For 
the 
expression 
aequè 
bene, 
is 
a 
relative 
that 
necessarily 
requireth 
two 
terms 
at 
least, 
for 
a 
thing 
cannot 
have 
relation 
to 
its 
self, 
nor 
do 
we 
say, 
v. 
gr. 
rest 
to 
be 
equally 
good, 
as 
rest. 
And 
because, 
when 
we 
say, 
that 
is 
done 
in 
vain 
by 
many 
means, 
which 
may 
be 
done 
with 
fewer, 
we 
mean, 
that 
that 
which 
is 
to 
be 
done, 
ought 
to 
be 
the 
same 
thing, 
not 
two 
different 
ones; 
and 
because 
the 
same 
thing 
cannot 
be 
said 
to 
be 
done 
as 
well 
as 
its 
self; 
therefore, 
the 
addition

let 
Simplicius 
begin 
to 
produce 
those 
difficulties 
that 
seeminhisopinion,tothwart 
thisnewdispositionofthe 
World. 


SIMPL. 


That 
disposition 
is 
not 
new, 
but 
very 
old; 
and 
that 
you 
may 
see 
it 
is 
so, 
Aristotle 
confuteth 
it; 
and 
his 
confutations 
are 
these: 
Aristotles 
Arguments 
for 
the 
Earths 
quiessence. 
‘First 
if 
the 
Earth 
moveth 
either 
in 
it 
self 
about 
its 
own 
Centre, 
or 
in 
an 
Excentrick 
Circle, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
that 
same 
motion 
be 
violent; 
for 
it 
is 
not 
its 
natural 
motion, 
for 
if 
it 
were, 
each 
of 
its 
parts 
would 
partake 
thereof; 
but 
each 
of 
them 
moveth 
in 
a 
right 
line 
towards 
its 
Centre. 
It 
being 
therefore 
violent 
and 
pteternatural, 
it 
could 
never 
be 
perpetual: 
But 
the 
order 
of 
the 
World 
is 
perpetual. 
Therefore, 
&c. 
Secondly, 
all 
the 
other 
moveables 
that 
move 
circularly, 
seem 
toResti 
indietz 
, 
which 
is 



meant 
here 
of 
that 
motion 
which 
a 
bowl 
makes 
when 
is 
born 
by 
its 
by 
as 
to 
one 
side 
or 
other, 
and 
so 
hindered 
in 
its 
direct 
motion. 
stay 
behind, 
and 
to 
move 
with 
more 
than 
one 
motion, 
the 
Prmum 
Mobile 
excepted: 
Whence 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
that 
the 
Earth 
also 
do 
move 
with 
two 
motions; 
and 
if 
that 
should 
be 
so, 
it 
would 
inevitablyfollow,that 
mutations 
should 
be 
made 
in 
the 
Fixed 
Stars, 
the 
which 
none 
do 
perceive; 
nay 
without 
any 
variation, 
the 
same 
Stars 
alwayes 
rise 
from 
towards 
the 
same 
places, 
and 
in 
the 
same 
places 
do 
set. 
Thirdly, 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
parts 
is 
the 
same 
with 
that 
of 
the 
whole, 
and 
naturally 
tendeth 
towards 
the 
Centre 
of 
the 
Universe; 
and 
for 
the 
same 
cause 
rest, 
being 
arrived 
thither. 
He 
thereupon 
moves 
the 
question 
whether 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
parts 
hath 
a 
tendency 
to 
centre 
of 
the 
Universe, 
or 
to 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth; 
and 
concludeth 
that 
it 
goeth 
by 
proper 
instinct 
to 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Universe, 
and 
per 
accidence 
to 
that 
of 
the 
Earth; 
of 
which 
point 
we 
largely 
discoursed 
yesterday. 
He 
lastly 
confirmeth 
the 
same 
with 
a 
fourth 
argument 
taken 
from 
the 
experiment 
of 
grave 
bodies, 
which 
faling 
from 
on 
high, 
descend 
perpendicularly 
unto 
the 
Earths 
surface; 
and 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
Projectionsshot 
perpendicularly 
upwards, 
do 
by 
the 
same 
lines 
return 
perpendicularly 
down 
again, 
though 
they 
were 
shot 
to 
a 
very 
great 
height. 
All 
which 
arguments 
necessarily 
prove 
their 
motion 
to 
be 
towards 
the 
Centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
which 
without 
moving 
at 
all 
waits 
for, 
and 
receiveth 
them. 
He 
intimateth 
in 
the 
last 
place 
that 
the 
Astronomers 
alledg 
other 
reasons 
in 
confirmation 
of 
the 
same 
conclusions, 
I 
mean 
of 
the 
Earths 
being 
in 
the 
Centre 
of 
the 
Universe, 
and 
immoveable; 
and 
instanceth 
onely 
in 
one 
of 
them, 
to 
wit, 
that 
all 
the 
Phaenomena 
or 
appearances 
that 
are 
seen 
in 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
Stars, 
perfectly 
agree 
with 
the 
position 
of 
the 
Earth 
in 
the 
Centre; 
which 
would 
not 
be 
so, 
were 
the 
Earth 
seated 
otherwise.’ 
The 
rest 
produced 
by 
Ptolomy 
and 
the 
other 
Astronomers, 
I 
can 
give 
you 
now 
if 
you 
please, 
or 
after 
you 
have 
spoken 
what 
you 
have 
to 
say 
in 
answer 
to 
these 
of 
Aristotle. 


SALV. 


The 
arguments 
which 
are 
brought 
upon 
this 
occasion 
are 
of 
two 
kinds: 
Two 
kindes 
of 
Arguments 
touching 
theEarthsmotion 
or 
rest. 
some 
have 
respect 
to 
the 
accidents 
Terrestrial, 
without 
any 
relation 
to 
the 
Stars, 
and 
others 
are 
taken 
from 
the 
Phaenomena 
and 
observations 
of 
things 
Coelestial. 
The 
arguments 
of 
Aristotle 
are 
for 
the 
most 
part 
taken 
from 
things 
neer 
at 
hand, 



and 
he 
leaveth 
the 
others 
to 
Astronomers; 
and 
therefore 
it 
is 
the 
best 
way, 
if 
you 
like 
of 
it, 
to 
examine 
these 
taken 
from 
experiments 
touching 
the 
Earth, 
and 
then 
proceed 
to 
those 
of 
the 
other 
kind. 
Arguments 
of 
Ptolomy 
and 
Tycho, 
and 
other 
persons, 
over 
and 
above 
those 
of 
Aristotle. 
And 
because 
Ptolomy, 
Tycho, 
and 
the 
other 
Astronomers 
and 
Philosophers, 
besides 
the 
arguments 
of 
Aristotle 
by 
them 
assumed, 
confirmed, 
and 
made 
good, 
do 
produce 
certain 
others; 
we 
will 
put 
them 
all 
together, 
that 
so 
we 
may 
not 
answertwicetothesame,orthe

ThereforeSimplicius,choose 
whether 
you 
will 
recite 
them 
your 
self, 
or 
cause 
me 
to 
ease 
you 
of 
this 
task, 
forIamreadytoserveyou. 


SIMPL. 


It 
is 
better 
that 
you 
quote 
them, 
because, 
as 
having 
taken 
more 
pains 
in 
the 
study 
of 
them, 
you 
can 
produce 
them 
with 
more 
readinesse, 
and 
in 
greater 
number. 


SALV. 


All, 
The 
first 
argument 
taken 
from 
grave 
bodies 
falling 
from 
on 
high 
to 
the 
ground. 
for 
the 
strongest 
reason, 
alledge 
that 
of 
grave 
bodies, 
which 
falling 
downwards 
from 
on 
high, 
move 
by 
a 
right 
line, 
that 
is 
perpendicular 
to 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
Earth, 
an 
argument 
which 
is 
held 
undeniably 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
Earth 
is 
immoveable: 
for 
in 
case 
it 
should 
have 
the 
diurnal 
motion, 
a 
Tower, 
from 
the 
top 
of 
which 
a 
stone 
is 
let 
fall, 
being 
carried 
along 
by 
the 
conversion 
of 
the 
Earth, 
in 
the 
time 
that 
the 
stone 
spends 
in 
falling, 
would 
be 
transported 
many 
hundred 
yards 
Eastward, 
and 
so 
far 
distant 
from 
the 
Towers 
foot 
would 
the 
stone 
come 
to 
ground. 
The 
which 
effect 
they 
back 
with 
another 
experiment; 
Which 
is 
confirmed 
by 
the 
experiment 
of 
a 
body 
let 
fall 
from 
the 
round 
top 
of 
a 
Ship. 
to 
wit, 
by 
letting 
a 
bullet 
of 
lead 
fall 
from 
the 
round 
top 
of 
a 
Ship, 
that 
lieth 
at 
anchor, 
and 
observing 
the 
mark 
it 
makes 
where 
it 
lights, 
which 
they 
find 
to 
be 
neer 
theThat 
is, 
at 
the 
foot 
of 
the 
Mast, 
upon 
the 
upper 
deck. 
partners 
of 
the 
Mast; 
but 
if 
the 
same 
bullet 
be 
let 
fall 
from 
the 
same 
place 
when 
the 
ship 
is 
under 
sail, 
it 
shall 
light 
as 
far 
from 
the 
former 
place, 
as 
the 
ship 
hath 
run 
in 
the 
time 
of 
the 
leads 
descent; 
and 
this 
for 
no 
other 
reason, 
than 
because 
the 
natural 
motion 
of 
the 
ball 
being 
at 
liberty 
is 
by 
a 
right 
line 
towards 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth. 
The 
second 
argument 
taken 
from 
a 
Projection 
shot 
very 
high. 
They 
fortifie 
this 
argument 
with 
the 
experiment 



of 
a 
projection 
shot 
on 
high 
at 
a 
very 
great 
distance; 
as 
for 
example, 
a 
ball 
sent 
out 
of 
a 
Cannon, 
erected 
perpendicular 
to 
the 
horizon, 
the 
which 
spendeth 
so 
much 
time 
in 
ascending 
and 
falling, 
that 
in 
our 
parallel 
the 
Cannon 
and 
we 
both 
should 
be 
carried 
by 
the 
Earth 
many 
miles 
towards 
the 
East, 
so 
that 
the 
ball 
in 
its 
return 
could 
never 
come 
neer 
the 
Peece, 
but 
would 
fall 
as 
far 
West, 
The 
third 
argument 
taken 
from 
the 
shots 
of 
a 
Cannon, 
towards 
the 
East, 
and 
towards 
the 
West▪ 
as 
the 
Earth 
had 
run 
East. 
They 
againe 
adde 
a 
third, 
and 
very 
evident 
experiment, 
scilicet, 
that 
shooting 
a 
bullet 
point 
blank 
(or 
as 
Gunners 
say, 
neither 
above 
nor 
under 
metal) 
out 
of 
a 
CulverintowardstheEast,andafterwardsanother, 
withthesamecharge,and 
at 
the 
same 
elevation 
or 
disport 
towards 
the 
West, 
the 
range 
towards 
the 
West 
should 
be 
very 
much 
greater 
then 
the 
other 
towards 
the 
East: 
for 
that 
whil’st 
the 
ball 
goeth 
Westward, 
and 
the 
Peece 
is 
carried 
along 
by 
the 
Earth 
Eastward, 
the 
ball 
will 
fall 
from 
the 
Peece 
as 
far 
distant 
as 
is 
the 
aggregate 
of 
the 
two 
motions, 
one 
made 
by 
it 
self 
towards 
the 
West, 
and 
the 
other 
by 
the 
Peece 
carried 
about 
by 
the 
Earth 
towards 
the 
East; 
and 
on 
the 
contrary, 
from 
the 
range 
of 
the 
ball 
shot 
Eastward 
you 
are 
to 
substract 
the 
space 
the 
Peece 
moved, 
being 
carried 
after 
it. 
Now 
suppose, 
for 
example, 
that 
the 
range 
of 
the 
ball 
shot 
West 
were 
five 
miles, 
and 
that 
the 
Earth 
in 
the 
same 
parallel 
and 
in 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Bals 
ranging 
should 
remove 
three 
miles, 
the 
Ball 
in 
this 
case 
would 
fall 
eight 
miles 
distant 
from 
the 
Culverin, 
namely, 
its 
own 
five 
Westward, 
and 
the 
Culverins 
three 
miles 
Eastward: 
but 
the 
range 
of 
the 
shot 
towards 
the 
East 
would 
be 
but 
two 
miles 
long, 
for 
so 
much 
is 
the 
remainder, 
after 
you 
have 
substracted 
from 
the 
five 
miles 
of 
the 
range, 
the 
three 
miles 
which 
the 
Peece 
had 
moved 
towards 
the 
same 
part. 
But 
experience 
sheweth 
theRangestobe 
equal, 
thereforetheCulverin,andconsequentlythe 
Earthare 
immoveable. 
This 
argument 
is 
confirmed 
by 
two 
shots 
towards 
the 
South 
and 
towards 
the 
North. 
And 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
Earth 
is 
no 
lesse 
confirmed 
by 
two 
other 
shots 
made 
North 
and 
South; 
for 
they 
would 
never 
hit 
the 
mark, 
but 
the 
Ranges 
would 
be 
alwayes 
wide, 
or 
towards 
the 
West, 
by 
meanes 
of 
the 
remove 
the 
mark 
would 
make, 
being 
carried 
along 
with 
the 
Earth 
towards 
the 
East, 
whil’st 
the 
ball 
is 
flying. 
And 
it 
is 
likewise 
confirmed 
by 
two 
shots 
towards 
the 
East, 
and 
towards 
the 
West. 
And 
not 
onely 
shots 
made 
by 
the 
Meridians, 
but 
also 
those 
aimed 
East 
or 
West 
would 
prove 
uncertain; 
for 
those 
aim’d 
East 
would 
be 
too 
high, 
and 
those 
directed 
West 
too 
low, 
although 
they 
were 
shot 
point 
blank, 
as 
I 
said. 
For 
the 
Range 
of 
the 
Ball 
in 
both 
the 
shots 
being 
made 
by 
the 
Tangent, 
that 
is, 
by 
a 
line 
parallel 
to 
the 



Horizon, 
and 
being 
that 
in 
the 
diurnal 
motion, 
if 
it 
be 
of 
the 
Earth, 
the 
Horizon 
goeth 
continually 
descending 
towards 
the 
East, 
and 
rising 
from 
the 
West 
(therefore 
the 
Oriental 
Stars 
seem 
to 
rise, 
and 
the 
Occidental 
to 
decline) 
so 
that 
the 
Oriental 
mark 
would 
descend 
below 
the 
aime, 
and 
thereupon 
the 
shot 
would 
fly 
too 
high, 
and 
the 
ascending 
of 
the 
Western 
mark 
would 
make 
the 
shot 
aimed 
that 
way 
range 
too 
low; 
so 
that 
the 
Peece 
would 
never 
carry 
true 
towards 
any 
point; 
and 
for 
that 
experience 
telleth 
us 
the 
contrary,

believe,

if 
any 
one 
forsakes 
the 
Doctrine

it

because 
they

some

befell

so 
soon 
as 
I 
first 
began 
to 
hear 
speak 
of 
this 
new 
doctrine. 
Being 
very 
young, 
and 
having 
scarcely 
finished 
my 
course 
of 
Philosophy, 
which 
I 
left 
off, 
as 
being 
set 
upon 
other 
employments, 
there 
chanced 
to 
come 
into 
these 
parts 
a 
certain 
Foreigner 
of 
Rostock, 
whose 
name, 
as 
I 
remember, 
was 
Christianus 
Vurstitius, 
Christianus 
Vurstitius 
read 
certain 
Lectures 
touching 
the 
opinion 
of 
Copernicus, 
& 
what 
ensued 
thereupon. 
a 
follower 
of 
Copernicus, 
who 
in 
an 
Academy 
made 
two 
or 
three 
Lectures 
upon 
this 
point, 
to 
whom 
many 
flock’t 
as 
Auditors; 
but 
I 
thinking 
they 
went 
more 
for 
the 
novelty 
of 
the 
subject 
than 
otherwise, 
did 
not 
go 
to 
hear 
him: 
for 
I 
had 
concluded 
with 
my 
self 
that 
that 
opinion 
could 
be 
no 
other 
than 
a 
solemn 
madnesse. 
And 
questioning 
some 
of 
those 
who 
had 
been 
there, 
I 
perceived 
they 
all 
made 
a 
jest 
thereof, 
execpt 
one, 
who 
told 
me 
that 
the 
businesse 
was 
not 
altogether 
to 
be 
laugh’t 
at, 
and 
because 
this 
man 
was 
reputed 
by 
me 
to 
be 
very 
intelligent 
and 
wary, 
I 
repented 
that 
I 
was 
not 
there, 
and 
began 
from 
that 
time 
forward 
as 
oft 
as 
I 
met 
with 
any 
one 
of 
the 
Copernican 
perswasion, 
to 
demand 
of 
them, 
if 
they 
had 
been 
alwayes 
of 
the 
same 
judgment; 
and 
of 
as 
many 
as 
I 
examined, 
I 
found 
not 
so 
much 
as 
one, 
who 
told 
me 
not 
that 
he 
had 
been 
a 
long 
time 
of 
the 
contrary 
opinion, 
but 
to 
have 
changed 
it 
for 
this, 
as 
convinced 
by 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
reasons 
proving 
the 
same: 
and 
afterwards 
questioning 
them, 
one 
by 
one, 
to 
see 
whether 
they 
were 
well 
possest 
of 
the 
reasons 
of 
the 
other 
side, 
I 
found 
them 
all 
to 
be 
very 
ready 
and 
perfect 
in 
them; 
The 
followers 
of 
Copernicus 
were 
all 
first 
against 
that 
opinion, 
but 
the 
Sectators 
of 
Aristotle 
& 
Ptolomy, 
were 
never 
of 
the 
other 
side. 
so 
that 
I 
could 
not 
truly 
say, 
that 
they 
had 
took 
up 
this 
opinion 
out 
of 
ignorance, 
vanity, 
or 
to 
shew 
the 
acutenesse 
of 
their 
wits. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
of 
as 
many 
of 
the 
Peripateticks 
and 
Ptolomeans 
as 
I 
have 
asked 
(and 
out 
of 
curiosity 
I 
have 
talked 
with 
many) 
what 
pains 
they 
had 
taken 
in 
the 
Book 
of 
Copernicus, 
I 
found 
very 
few 
that 
had 
so 
much 
as 
superficially 
perused 
it; 
but 
of 
those 



whom, 
I 
thought, 
had 
understood 
the 
same, 
not 
one; 
and 
moreover, 
I 
have 
enquired 
amongst 
the 
followers 
of 
the 
Peripatetick 
Doctrine, 
if 
ever 
any 
of 
them 
had 
held 
the 
contrary 
opinion, 
and 
likewise 
found 
none 
that 
had. 
Whereupon 
considering 
that 
there 
was 
no 
man 
who 
followed 
the 
opinion 
of 
Copernicus, 
that 
had 
not 
been 
first 
on 
the 
contrary 
side, 
and 
that 
was 
not 
very 
well 
acquainted 
with 
the 
reasons 
of 
Aristotle 
and 
Ptolomy; 
and, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
that 
there 
is 
not 
one 
of 
the 
followers 
of 
Ptolomy 
that 
had 
ever 
been 
of 
the 
judgment 
of 
Copernicus, 
and 
had 
left 
that, 
to 
imbrace 
this 
of 
Aristotle, 
considering, 
I 
say, 
these 
things, 
I 
began 
to 
think, 
that 
one, 
who 
leaveth 
an 
opinion 
imbued 
with 
his 
milk, 
and 
followed 
by 
very 
many, 
to 
take 
up 
another 
owned 
by 
very 
few, 
and 
denied 
by 
all 
the 
Schools, 
and 
that 
really 
seems 
a 
very 
great 
Paradox, 
must 
needs 
have 
been 
moved, 
not 
to 
say 
forced, 
by 
more 
powerful 
reasons. 
For 
this 
cause, 
I 
am 
become 
very 
curious 
to 
dive, 
as 
they 
say, 
into 
the 
bottom 
of 
this 
businesse, 
and 
account 
it 
my 
great 
good 
fortune 
that 
I 
have 
met 
you 
two, 
from 
whom 
I 
may 
without 
any 
trouble, 
hear 
all 
that 
hath 
been, 
and, 
haply, 
can 
be 
said 
on 
this 
argument, 
assuring 
my 
self 
that 
the 
strength 
of 
your 
reasons 
will 
resolve 
all 
scruples, 
and 
bring 
me 
to 
a

This 
is 
a

that 
those 
reasons 
that 
hitherto 
seemed 
concluding 
unto 
you, 
and 
assured 
you 
in 
the

of

by 
degrees,

not 
imbrace, 
at

look 
towards 
the 



contrary

I, 
that 
have 
been 
hitherto

do 
greatly 
hope

They 
are 
so. 
We 
are 
in 
a 
Dilemma, 
one 
part 
of 
which 
must 
of 
necessity 
be 
true, 
and 
the 
other 
untrue; 
for 
between 
Motion 
and 
Rest, 
which 
are 
contradictories, 
there 
cannot 
be 
instanced 
a 
third, 
so 
as 
that 
one 
cannot

the 
Earth

The 
Earth, 
the

what

in

are

So

Motion 
and

principal 
accidents

that 


Natureherself

SAGR. 
So 
that 
moving 
eternally, 
and 
the 
being 
wholly 
immoveable 
are 
two 


conditions 
very 
considerable 
in 
Nature, 
and 
indicate 
very 
great 
diversity;

Now 
answer 
me 
to 
another 
point. 
Do 
you 
believe 
that 
in 
Logick, 
Rhethorick, 


the 
Physicks, 
Metaphysicks, 
Mathematicks, 
and 
finally, 
in 
the 
universa 
ity 
of 
Disputations 
there 
are 
arguments 
sufficient 
to 
perswade 
and 
demonstrate 
to 
a 
personthefallacious,no 
lessethenthetrue 
conclusions? 


SIMPL. 
No 
Sir; 
Vntruths 
cannot 
be 
demonstrated, 
as 
Truths 
are. 
rather 
I 
am 
very 
confident 
and 
certain, 
that 
for 
the 
proving 
of 
a 
true 
and 
necessary 
conclusion, 



there 
are 
in 
nature 
not 
onely 
one, 
For 
proof 
of 
true 
conclusions, 
many 
solid 
arguments 
may 
be 
produced, 
but 
to 
prove 
a 
falsity, 
none. 
but 
many 
very 
powerfull 
demonstrations: 
and 
that 
one 
may 
discusse 
and 
handle 
the 
same 
divers 
and 
sundry 
wayes, 
without 
ever 
falling 
into 
any 
absurdity; 
and 
that 
the 
more 
any 
Sophist 
would 
disturb 
and 
muddy 
it, 
the 
more 
clear 
would 
its 
certainty 
appear: 
And 
that 
on 
the 
contrary 
to 
make 
a 
false 
position 
passe 
for 
true, 
and 
to 
perswade 
the 
belief 
thereof, 
there 
cannot 
be 
any 
thing 
produced 
but 
fallacies, 
Sophisms, 
Paralogismes, 
Equivocations, 
and 
Discourses 
vain, 
inconsistant,andfullofrepugnancesand 
contradictions. 


SAGR. 


Now 
if 
eternal 
motion, 
and 
eternal 
rest 
be 
so 
principal 
accidents 
of 
Nature, 
and 
so 
different, 
that 
there 
can 
depend 
on 
them 
only 
most 
different 
consequences, 
and 
especially 
when 
applyed 
to 
the 
Sun, 
and 
to 
the 
Earth, 
so 
vast 
and 
famous 
bodies 
of 
the 
Universe; 
and 
it 
being, 
moreover, 
impossible, 
that 
one 
of 
two 
contradictory 
Propositions, 
should 
not 
be 
true, 
and 
the 
other 
false; 
and 
that 
for 
proof 
of 
the 
false 
one, 
any 
thing 
can 
be 
produced 
but 
fallacies; 
but 
the 
true 
one 
being 
perswadeable 
by 
all 
kind 
of 
concluding 
and 
demonstrative 
arguments, 
why 
should 
you 
think 
that 
he, 
of 
you 
two, 
who

You 
must 
suppose 
me 
to 
be 
of 
a 
stupid 
wit, 
perverse 
judgment, 
dull 
mind 
and 
intellect, 
and 
of 
a 
blind 
reason, 
that 
I 
should 
not 
be 
able 
to 
distinguish 
lightfromdarknesse,jewels 
fromcoals,ortruth

SIMPL. 


I 
tell 
you 
now, 
and 
have 
told 
you 
upon 
other 
occasions, 
that 
the 
best 
Master 
to 
teach 
us 
how 
to 
discern 
Sophismes, 
Paralogismes, 
and 
other 
fallacies, 
was 
Aristotle, 
whoin 
thisparticularcannever 
bedeceived. 


SAGR. 


You 
insist 
upon 
Aristotle, 
who 
cannot 
speak. 
Yet 
I 
tell 
you, 
Aristotle 
would 
either 
refute 
his 
adversaries 
arguments, 
or 
would 
alter 
his 
opinion. 
that 
if 
Aristotle 
were 
here, 
he 
would 
either 
yield 
himself 
to 
be 
perswaded 
by 
us, 
or 
refuting 
our 
arguments, 
convince 
us 
by 
better 
of 
his 
own. 
And 
you 
your 
self, 
when 
you 
heard 
the 
experiments 
of 
the 
Suns 
related, 
did 
you 
not 
acknowledg 



and 
admire 
them, 
and 
confesse 
them 
moreconcludentthanthose 
of 
Aristotle? 
Yet 
neverthelesse 
I 
cannot 
perceive 
that 
Salviatus, 
who 
hath 
produced 
them, 
examined 
them, 
and 
with 
exquisite 
care 
scan’d 
them, 
doth 
confesse 
himself 
perswaded 
by 
them; 
no 
nor 
by 
others 
of 
greaterforce, 
which 
he 
intimated 
that 
he 
was 
about 
to 
give 
us 
an 
account 
of. 
And 
I 
know 
not 
on 
what 
grounds 
you 
should 
censure 
Nature, 
as 
one 
that 
for 
many 
Ages 
hath 
been 
lazie, 
and 
forgetful 
to 
produce 
speculative 
wits; 
and 
that 
knoweth 
not 
how 
to 
make 
more 
such, 
unlesse 
they 
be 
such 
kind 
of 
men 
as 
slavishly 
giving 
up 
their 
judgments 
to 
Aristotle, 
do 
understand 
with 
his 
brain, 
and 
resent 
with 
his 
senses. 
But 
let 
us 
hear 
the 
residue 
of 
those 
reasons 
which 
favour 
his 
opinion, 
that 
we 
may 
thereupon 
proceed 
to 
speak 
to 
them; 
comparing 
and 
weighing 
themintheballanceofimpartiality. 


SALV. 


Before 
I 
proceed 
any 
farther, 
I 
must 
tell 
Sagredus, 
that 
in 
these 
our 
Disputations, 
I 
personate 
the 
Copernican, 
and 
imitate 
him, 
as 
if 
I 
were 
his 
Zany; 
but 
what 
hath 
been 
effected 
in 
my 
private 
thoughts 
by 
these 
arguments 
which 
I 
seem 
to 
alledg 
in 
his 
favour, 
I 
would 
not 
have 
you 
to 
judg 
by 
what 
I 
say, 
whil’st 
I 
am 
in 
the 
heat 
of 
acting 
my 
part 
in 
the 
Fable; 
but 
after 
I 
have 
laid 
by 
my 
disguise, 
for 
you 
may 
chance 
to 
find 
me 
different 
from 
what 
you 
seeme 
upontheStage. 
Nowletus 
goon. 


Ptolomy 
and 
his 
followers 
produce 
another 
experiment 
like 
to 
that 
of 
the 
Projections, 
An 
argument 
taken 
from 
the 
Clouds, 
and 
from 
Birds. 
and 
it 
is 
of 
things 
that 
being 
separated 
from 
the 
Earth, 
continue 
a 
good 
space 
of 
time 
in 
the 
Air, 
such 
as 
are 
the 
Clouds, 
Birds 
of 
flight; 
and 
as 
of 
them 
it 
cannot 
be 
said 
that 
they 
are 
rapt 
or 
transparted 
by 
the 
Earth, 
having 
no 
adhesion 
thereto, 
it 
seems 
not 
possible, 
that 
they 
should 
be 
able 
to 
keep 
pace 
with 
the 
velocity 
thereof;nayitshould

And 
if

passe 
our

twenty 
four

beat

or 
any 
other 
part, 
without 
any 
sensible 
difference. 
Moreover, 
if 
when 
we 
run 
a 
Horse 
at 
his

we 
feel 
the

beat 
vehemently

perpetually 
to

from

carried 
with 
so 
rapid 
a 
course 
against 
the 
wind? 
and 
yet 
no 
such 
effect 
is 
perceived. 
Take 
another 
very 
ingenious 
argument 
inferred 
from 
the 
following 
experiment. 
An 
argument 
taken 
from 
the 
whirling 
of 
circular 
motion, 
which 
hath 
a 
faculty 
to 
extrude 
and 
dissipate. 
The 
circular 
motion 
hath 
a 
faculty 
to 
extrude 
and 
dissipate 
from 
its 
Centre 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
moving 
body, 
whensoever 
either 
the 
motion 
is 
not 
very 
slow, 
or 
those 
parts 
are 
not 
very 
well 
fastened 
together; 
and 
therefore, 
if 
v. 
g. 
we 
should 
turn 
one 
of 
those 
great 
wheels 
very 
fast 
about, 
wherein 
one 
or 
more 
men 
walking, 
crane 
up 
very 
great 
weights, 
as 
the 
huge 
massie 
stone, 
used 
by 
the 
Callander 
for 
pressing 
of 
Cloaths; 
or 
the 
fraighted 
Barks 
which 
being 
haled 
on 
shore, 
are 
hoisted 
out 
of 
one 
river 
into 
another; 
in 
case 
the 
parts 
of 
that 
same 
Wheel 
so 
swiftly 
turn’d 
round, 
be 
not 
very 
well 
joyn’d 
and 
pin’d 
together, 
they 
would 
all 
be 
shattered 
to 
pieces; 
and 
though 
many 
stones 
or 
other 
ponderous 
substances, 
should 
be 
very 
fast 
bound 
to 
its 
outward 
Rimme, 
yet 
could 
they 
not 
resist 
the 
impetuosity, 
which 
with 
great 
violence 
would 
hurl 
them 
every 
way 
far 
from 
the 
Wheel, 
and 
consequently 
from 
its 
Centre. 
So 
that 
if 
the 
Earth 
did 
move 
with 
such 
and 
so 
much 
greater 
velocity, 
what 
gravity, 
what 
tenacity 
of 
lime 
or 
plaister 
would 
keep 
together 
Stones, 
Buildings, 
and 
whole 
Cities, 
that 
they 
should 
not 
be 
tost 
into 
the 
Air 
by 
so 
precipitous 
a 
motion? 
And 
both 
men 
and 
beasts, 
which 
are 
not 
fastened 
to 
the 
Earth, 
how 
could 
they 
resist 
so 
great 
an 
impetus? 
Whereas, 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
we 
see 
both 
these, 
and 
far 
lesse 
resistances 
of 
pebles, 
sands, 
leaves 
rest 
quietly 
on 
the 
Earth, 
and 
to 
return 
to 
it 
in 
falling, 
though 
with 
a 
very 
slow 
motion. 
See 
here, 
Simplicius, 
the 
most 
potent 
arguments, 
taken, 
to 
so 
speak, 
from 
things 
Terrestrial; 
there 
remain 
those 
of 
the 
other 
kind, 
namely, 
such 
as 
have 
relation 
to 
the 
appearances 
of 
Heaven, 
which 
reasons, 
to 
confesse 
the 
truth, 
tend 
more 
to 
prove 
the 
Earth 
to 
be 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Universe, 
and 
consequently, 
to 
deprive 
it 
of 
the 
annual 
motion 
about 
the 
same, 
ascribed 
unto 
it 
by 
Copernicus.

being

What 
say

that

is 
Master 
of,

knoweth 
how

Were 
it 
not 
for 
the 
high 
esteem, 
that 
the 
past 
discourses 
have 
begot 
in 
me 
of 
the 
learning 
of 
Salviatus, 
and 
of 
the 
acutenesse 
of 
Sagredus, 
I 
would 
by 
their 
good 
leave 
have 
gone 
my 
way 
without 
staying 
for 
their 
answers; 
it 
seeming 
to 
me 
a 
thing 
impossible, 
that 
so 
palpable 
experiments 
should 
be 
contradicted; 
and 
would, 
without 
hearing 
them 
farther, 
confirm 
my 
self 
in 
my 
old 
perswasion; 
for 
though 
I 
should 
be 
made 
to 
see 
that 
it 
was 
erroneous, 
its 
being 
upheld 
by 
so 
many 
probable 
reasons, 
would 
render 
it 
excuseable. 
And 
if 
these 
arefallacies,whattrue 
demonstrationswereever 
sofair? 


SAGR. 


Yet 
its 
good 
that 
we 
hear 
the 
responsions 
of 
Salviatus; 
which 
if 
they 
be 
true, 
mustof

those

yea 
most

if

Metaphysical 
Axiome 
hold, 
True 
and 
fair 
are 
one 
and 
the

as 
also 
false

That 
true 
and 
fair 
are

thing; 
as 
also 
false 
and 
deformed. 
Therefore 
Salviatus 
let’s

SALV. 


The 
first 
Argument 
alledged 
by 
Simplicius, 
if 
I 
well 
remember 
it, 
was 
this. 
The 
Earth 
cannot 
move 
circularly, 
because 
such 
motion 
would 
be 
violent 
to 
the 
same, 
and 
therefore 
not 
perpetual: 
that 
it 
is 
violent, 
the 
reason 
was: 
Because, 
that 
had 
it 
been 
natural, 
its 
parts 
would 
likewise 
naturally 
move 
round, 
which 
is 
impossible, 
for 
that 
it 
is 
natural 
for 
the 
parts 
thereof 
to 
move 
with 
a 
right 
motion 
downwards. 
To 
this 
my 
reply 
is, 
that 
I 
could 
gladly 
wish, 
The 
answer 
t 
Aristotles 
first 
argument. 
that 
Aristotle 
had 
more 
cleerly 
exprest 
himself, 
where 
he 
said; 
That 
its 
parts 
would 
likewise 
move 
circularly; 
for 
this 
moving 
circularly 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
two 
wayes, 
one 
is, 
that 
every 
particle 
or 
atome 
separated 
from 
its 
Whole 
would 
move 
circularly 
about 
its 
particular 
centre, 
describing 
its 
small 
Circulets; 
the 
other 
is, 
that 
the 
whole 
Globe 
moving 
about 
its 
centre 
in 
twenty 
four 
hours, 
the 
parts 
also 
would 
turn 
about 
the 
same 
centre 
in 
four 
and 
twenty 
hours. 
The 
first 
would 
be 
no 
lesse 
an 
impertinency, 
than 
if 
one 
should 
say, 
that 
every 
part 
of 
the 
circumference 
of 
a 
Circle 
ought 
to 
be 
a 
Circle; 
or 
because 
that 
the 
Earth 
is 
Spherical, 
that 
therefore 
every 
part 
thereof 
be 
a 
Globe, 
for 
so 
doth 
the 
Axiome 
require: 



Eadem 
est 
ratio 
totius, 
& 
partium. 
But 
if 
he 
took 
it 
in 
the 
other 
sense, 
to 
wit, 
that 
the 
parts 
in 
imitation 
of 
the 
Whole 
should 
move 
naturally 
round 
the 
Centre 
of 
the 
whole 
Globe 
in 
twenty 
four 
hours, 
I 
say, 
that 
they 
do 
so; 
and 
it 
concernsyou, 
insteadofAristotle,toprovethattheydonot. 


SIMPL. 


This 
is 
proved 
by 
Aristotle 
in 
the 
same 
place, 
when 
he 
saith, 
that 
the 
natural 
motion 
of 
the 
parts 
is 
the 
right 
motion 
downwards 
to 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Universe;sothatthecircular 
motioncannotnaturallyagreetherewith. 


SALV. 


But 
do 
not 
you 
see, 
that 
those 
very 
words 
carry 
in 
them 
a 
confutation 
of 
this 
solution? 


SIMPL. 


How? 
andwhere? 


SALV. 


Doth 
not 
he 
say 
that 
the 
circular 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth 
would 
be 
violent? 
and 
therefore 
not 
eternal? 
and 
that 
this 
is 
absurd, 
for 
that 
the 
order 
of 
the 
World 
is 
eternal? 


SIMPL. 


Hesaithso. 


SALV. 


But 
if 
that 
which 
is 
violent 
cannot 
be 
eternal, 
That 
which 
is 
violent, 
cannot 
be 
eternal, 
and 
that 
which 
cannot 
be 
eternal, 
cannot 
be 
natural. 
then 
by 
conversion, 
that 
which 
cannot 
be 
eternal, 
cannot 
be 
natural: 
but 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth 
downwards 
cannot 
be 
otherwise 
eternal; 
therefore 
much 
lesse 
can 
it 
be 
natural: 
nor 
can 
any 
other 
motion 
be 
natural 
to 
it, 
save 
onely 
that 
which 
is 
eternal. 
But 
if 
we 
make 
the 
Earth 
move 
with 
a 
circular 
motion, 
this 
may 
be 
eternalto 
it,andtoits 
parts,andthereforenatural. 



SIMPL. 


The 
right 
motion 
is 
most 
natural 
to 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Earth, 
and 
is 
to 
them 
eternal; 
nor 
shall 
it 
ever 
happen 
that 
they 
move 
not 
with 
a 
right 
motion; 
alwayes 
providedthatthe 
impedimentsberemoved. 


SALV. 


You 
equivocate 
Simplicius; 
and 
I 
will 
try 
to 
free 
you 
from 
the 
equivoke. 
Tell 
me, 
therefore, 
do 
you 
think 
that 
a 
Ship 
which 
should 
sail 
from 
the 
Strait 
of 
Gibralter 
towards 
Palestina 
can 
eternally 
move 
towards 
that 
Coast? 
keeping 
alwayes 
anequalcourse? 


SIMPL. 


Nodoubtlesse. 


SALV. 


Andwhynot? 


SIMPL. 


Because 
that 
Voyage 
is 
bounded 
and 
terminated 
between 
the 
Herculean 
Pillars, 
and 
the 
shore 
of 
the 
Holy-land; 
and 
the 
distance 
being 
limited, 
it 
is 
past 
in 
a 
finite 
time, 
unlesse 
one 
by 
returning 
back 
should 
with 
a 
contrary 
motion 
begin 
the 
same 
Voyage 
anew; 
but 
this 
would 
be 
an 
interrupted 
and 
no 
continuedmotion. 


SALV. 


Very 
true. 
But 
the 
Navigation 
from 
the 
Strait 
of 
Magalanes 
by 
the 
Pacifick 
Ocean, 
the 
Moluccha’s, 
the 
Cape 
di 
buona 
Speranza, 
and 
from 
thence 
by 
the 
same 
Strait, 
and 
then 
again 
by 
the 
Pacifick 
Ocean, 
&c. 
do 
you 
believe 
that 
it 
maybe 
perpetuated? 


SIMPL. 



It 
may; 
for 
this 
being 
a 
circumgyration, 
which 
returneth 
about 
its

with 
infinitereplications,itmaybeperpetuated 
without 
anyinterruption. 


SALV. 


AShipthenmay

Voyage

SIMPL. 


It 
may, 
in 
case 
the 
Ship 
were 
incorruptible, 
but 
the 
Ship 
decaying, 
the 
Navigationmust 
ofnecessitycometo 
an

SALV. 


But 
in 
the 
Mediterrane, 
though 
the 
Vessel 
were 
incorruptible, 
yet 
could 
she 
not 
sail 
perpetually 
towards 
Palestina, 
that 
Voyage 
being 
determined. 
Two 
things 
requisite 
to 
the 
end 
a 
motion 
may 
perpetuate 
it 
self; 
an 
unlimited 
space, 
and 
an 
incorruptible 
moveable. 
Two 
things 
then 
are 
required, 
to 
the 
end 
a 
moveable 
may 
without 
intermission 
move 
perpetually; 
the 
one 
is, 
that 
the 
motion 
may 
of 
its 
own 
nature 
be 
indeterminate 
and 
infinite; 
the 
other, 
that 
themoveablebelikewise 
incorruptibleandeternal. 


SIMPL. 


Allthis 
isnecessary. 


SALV. 


Therefore 
you 
may 
see 
how 
of 
your 
own 
accord 
you 
have 
confessed 
it 
impossible 
that 
any 
moveable 
should 
move 
eternally 
in 
a 
right 
line, 
Right 
motion 
cannot 
be 
eternal, 
and 
consequently 
cannot 
be 
natural 
to 
the 
Earth. 
in 
regard 
that 
right 
motion, 
whether 
it 
be 
upwards, 
or 
downwards, 
is 
by 
you 
your 
self 
bounded 
by 
the 
circumference 
and 
centre; 
so 
that 
if 
a 
Moveable, 
as 
suppose 
the 
Earth 
be 
eternal, 
yet 
forasmuch 
as 
the 
right

terminate, 
it 
cannot 
naturally 
suit 
with 
the 
Earth. 
Nay, 
as 
was 
saidBy 
this 
expression 
he 
every 
where

the 
preceding 
Dialogue, 
or 
Giornata. 
yesterday, 
Aristotle 
himself 
is 
constrained 
to 
make 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
eternally 
immoveable. 
When 
again 



you 
say, 
that 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Earth 
evermore 
move 
downwards, 
all 
impediments 
being 
removed, 
you 
egregiously 
equivocate; 
for 
then, 
on 
the 
other 
side 
they 
must 
be 
impeded, 
contraried, 
and 
forced, 
if 
you 
would 
have 
them 
move; 
for, 
when 
they 
are 
once 
fallen 
to 
the 
ground, 
they 
must 
be 
violently 
thrown 
upwards, 
that 
they 
may 
a 
second 
time 
fall; 
and 
as 
to 
the 
impediments, 
these 
only 
hinder 
its 
arrival 
at 
the 
centre; 
but 
if 
there 
were 
a 
Well, 
that 
did 
passe 
thorow 
and 
beyond 
the 
centre, 
yet 
would 
not 
a 
cold 
of 
Earth 
passe 
beyond 
it, 
unlesse 
inasmuch 
as 
being 
transported 
by 
its 
impetus, 
it 
should 
passe 
the 
same 
to 
return 
thither 
again, 
and 
in 
the 
end 
there 
to 
rest. 
As 
therefore 
to 
the 
defending, 
that 
the 
motion 
by 
a 
right 
line 
doth 
or 
can 
agree 
naturally 
neither 
to 
the 
Earth, 
nor 
to 
any 
other 
moveable, 
whil’st 
the 
Universe 
retaineth 
its 
perfect 
order, 
I 
would 
have 
you 
take 
no 
further 
paines 
about 
it, 
but 
(unlesse 
you 
will 
grant 
them 
the 
circular 
motion) 
your 
best 
way 
willbe 
todefendandmaintaintheir 
immobility. 


SIMPL. 


As 
to 
their 
immoveablenesse, 
the 
arguments 
of 
Aristotle, 
and 
moreover 
those 
alledged 
by 
your 
self 
seem 
in 
my 
opinion 
necessarily 
to 
conclude 
the

therefore,

And 
this 
new 
reading 
of 
the 
place 
hath 
confirmed 
me 
in 
the 
fallacy 
of 
the 
Sillogisme, 
and 
moreover, 
discovered 
another 
falsity. 
Therefore 
observe. 
The 
Positions, 
or 
if 
you 
will, 
Conclusions, 
which 
Aristotle 
endeavours 
to 
oppose, 
are 
two; 
one 
is 
that 
of 
those, 
who 
placing 
the 
Earth 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
World, 
do 
make 
it 
move 
in 
it 
self 
about 
its 
own 
centre. 
The 
other 
is 
of 
those, 
who 
constituting 
it 
far 
from 
the 
middle, 
do 
make 
it 
revolve 
with 
a 
circular 
motion 
about 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
Universe. 
And 
both 
these 
Positions 
he 
conjointly 



impugneth 
with 
one 
and 
the 
same 
argument. 
Now 
I 
affirm 
that 
he 
is 
out 
in 
both 
the 
one 
and 
the 
other 
impugnation; 
and 
that 
his 
error 
against 
the 
first 
Position 
is 
an 
Equivoke 
or 
Paralogisme; 
Aristotles 
argument 
against 
the 
Earth 
motion, 
is 
defective 
in 
two 
things 
and 
his 
mistake 
touching 
the 
second 
is 
a 
false 
consequence. 
Let 
us 
begin 
with 
the 
first 
Assertion, 
which 
constituteth 
the 
Earth 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
World, 
and 
maketh 
it 
move 
in 
it 
self 
about 
its 
own 
centre; 
and 
let 
us 
confront 
it 
with 
the 
objection 
of 
Aristotle; 
saying, 
All 
moveables, 
that 
move 
circularly, 
seem 
toThe 
same 
word 
which 
a 
little 
a 
ve 
I 
tendred 
stay 
behind, 
as 
a 
bowle 
when 
it 
meets 
with 
ul 
s. 
foreslow, 
and 
more 
with 
more 
than 
one 
Byas, 
except 
the 
first 
Sphere 
(that 
is 
the 
primum 
mobile) 
therefore 
the 
Earth 
moving 
about 
its 
own 
centre, 
being 
placed 
in 
the 
middle, 
must 
of 
necessity 
have 
two 
byasse, 
and 
foreslow. 
But 
if 
this 
were 
so, 
it 
would 
follow, 
that 
there 
should 
be 
a 
variation 
in 
the 
rising 
and 
setting 
of 
the 
fixed 
Stars, 
which 
we 
do 
not 
perceive 
to 
be 
done: 
Therefore 
the 
Earth 
doth 
not 
move, 
&c. 
Here 
is 
the 
Paralogisme, 
and 
to 
discover 
it, 
I 
will 
argue 
with 
Aristotle 
in 
this 
manner. 
Thou 
saist, 
oh 
Aristotle, 
that 
the 
Earth 
placed 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
World, 
cannot 
move 
in 
it 
self 
(i. 
e. 
upon 
its 
own 
axis) 
for 
then 
it 
would 
berequisite 
to 
allow 
it 
two 
byasses;so 
that,if 
itshould 
not 
be 
necessary 
to 
allow 
it 
more 
than 
one 
Byas 
onely, 
thou 
wouldest 
not 
then 
hold 
it 
impossible 
for 
it 
to 
move 
onely 
with 
that 
one; 
for 
thou 
would’st 
unnecessarily 
have 
confined 
the 
impossibility 
to 
the 
plurality 
of 
byasses, 
if 
in 
case 
it 
had 
nomore 
butone,yet 
it 
could 
notmove 
withthat. 
Andbecausethat 
of 
all 
the 
moveables 
in 
the 
World, 
thou 
makest 
but 
one 
alone 
to 
move 
with 
one 
sole 
byas; 
and 
all 
the 
rest 
with 
more 
than 
one; 
and 
this 
same 
moveable 
thou 
affirmest 
to 
be 
the 
first 
Sphere, 
namely, 
that 
by 
which 
all 
the 
fixed 
and 
erratick 
Stars 
seem 
harmoniously 
to 
move 
from 
East 
to 
West, 
if 
in 
case 
the 
Earth 
may 
be 
that 
first 
Sphere, 
that 
by 
moving 
with 
one 
byas 
onely, 
may 
make 
the 
Stars 
appear 
to 
move 
from 
East 
to 
West, 
thou 
wilt 
not 
deny 
them 
it: 
But 
he 
that 
affirmeth, 
that 
the 
Earth 
being 
placed 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
World, 
moveth 
about 
its 
own 
Axis, 
ascribes 
unto 
it 
no 
other 
motion, 
save 
that 
by 
which 
all 
the 
Stars 
appear 
to 
move 
from 
East 
to 
West; 
and 
so 
it 
cometh 
to 
be 
that 
first 
Sphere, 
which 
thou 
thy 
self 
acknowledgest 
to 
move 
with 
but 
one 
byas 
onely. 
It 
is 
therefore 
necessary, 
oh 
Aristotle, 
if 
thou 
wilt 
conclude 
any 
thing, 
that 
thou 
demonstrate, 
that 
the 
Earth 
being 
placed 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
World, 
cannot 
move 
with 
so 
much 
as 
one 
byas 
onely; 
or 
else, 
that 
much 
lesse 
can 
the 
first 
Sphere 
have 
one 
sole 
motion; 
for 
otherwise 
thou 
doest 
in 
thy 
very 
Sillogisme 
both 
commit 
the 
falacy, 
and 
detect 
it, 
denying, 
and 
at 
that 



very 
time 
proving 
the 
same 
thing. 
I 
come 
now 
to 
the 
second 
Position, 
namely, 
of 
those 
who 
placing 
the 
Earth 
far 
from 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
Universe, 
make 
it 
moveable 
about 
the 
same; 
that 
is, 
make 
it 
a 
Planet 
and 
erratick 
Star; 
against 
which 
the 
argument 
is 
directed, 
and 
as 
to 
form 
is 
concludent, 
but 
faileth 
in 
matter. 
For 
it 
being 
granted, 
that 
the 
Earth 
doth 
in 
that 
manner 
move, 
and 
that 
with 
two 
byasses, 
yet 
doth 
it 
not 
necessarily 
follow 
that 
though 
it 
were 
so, 
it 
should 
make 
alterations 
in 
the 
risings 
and 
settings 
of 
the 
fixed 
Stars, 
as 
I 
shall 
in 
its 
proper 
place 
declare. 
And 
here 
I 
could 
gladly 
excuse 
Aristotle; 
rather 
I 
could 
highly 
applaud 
him 
for 
having 
light 
upon 
the 
most 
subtil 
argument 
that 
could 
be 
produced 
against 
the 
Copernican 
Hypothesis; 
and 
if 
the 
objection 
be 
ingenious, 
and 
to 
outward 
appearance 
mostpowerful,you 
mayseehowmuchmoreacuteand 
ingeniousthesolution 
must 
be, 
and 
not 
to 
be 
found 
by 
a 
wit 
lesse 
piercing 
than 
that 
of 
Copernicus; 
and 
again 
from 
the 
difficulty 
in 
understanding 
it, 
you 
may 
argue 
the 
so 
much 
greater 
difficulty 
in 
finding 
it. 
But 
let 
us 
for 
the 
present 
suspend 
our 
answer, 
which 
you 
shall 
understand 
in 
due 
time 
and 
place, 
after 
we 
have 
repeated 
the 
objection 
of 
Aristotle, 
and 
that 
in 
his 
favour, 
much 
strengthened. 
Now 
passe 
we 
to 
Aristotles 
third 
Argument, 
The 
answer 
to 
the 
third 
argument. 
touching 
which 
we 
need 
give 
no 
farther 
reply, 
it 
having 
been 
sufficiently 
answered 
betwixt 
the 
discourses 
of 
yesterday 
and 
to 
day: 
In 
as 
much 
as 
he 
urgeth, 
that 
the 
motion 
of 
grave 
bodies 
is 
naturally 
by 
a 
right 
line 
to 
the 
centre; 
and 
then 
enquireth, 
whether 
to 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
or 
to 
that 
of 
the 
Universe, 
and 
concludeth 
that 
they 
tend 
naturally 
to 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Universe, 
but 
accidentally 
to 
that 
of 
the 
Earth. 
Therefore 
we 
may 
proceed 
to 
the 
fourth, 
The 
answer 
to 
the 
fourth 
argument. 
upon 
which 
its 
requisite 
that 
we 
stay 
some 
time, 
by 
reason 
it 
is 
founded 
upon 
that 
experiment, 
from 
whence 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
remaining 
arguments 
derive 
all 
their 
strength. 
Aristotle 
saith 
therefore, 
that 
it 
is 
a 
most 
convincing 
argument 
of 
the 
Earths 
immobility, 
to 
see 
that 
projections 
thrown 
or 
shot 
upright, 
return 
perpendicularly 
by 
the 
same 
line 
unto 
the 
same 
place 
from 
whence 
they 
were 
shot 
or 
thrown. 
And 
this 
holdeth 
true, 
although 
the 
motion 
be 
of 
a 
very 
great 
height; 
which 
could 
never 
come 
to 
passe, 
did 
the 
Earth 
move: 
for 
in 
the 
time 
that 
the 
projected 
body 
is 
moving 
upwards 
and 
downwards 
in 
a 
state 
of 
separation 
from 
the 
Earth, 
the 
place 
from 
whence 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
projection 
began, 
would 
be 
past, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
Earths 
revolution, 
a 
great 
way 
towards 
the 
East, 
and 
look 
how 
great 
that 
space 
was, 
so 
far 
from 
that 
place 
would 
the 
projected 
body 
in 
its 
descent 
come 
to 
the 
ground. 
So 
that 
hither 
may 
be

asalsothat

Now 
that 
I 
may 
begin 
to 
unite 
these 
knots, 
I 
demand 
of 
Simplicius 
that 
in 
case 
one 
should 
deny 
to 
Ptolomy 
and 
Aristotle 
that 
weights 
in 
falling 
freely 
from 
on 
high, 
descend 
by 
a 
right 
and 
perpendicular 
line, 
that 
is,directly 
tothecentre, 
whatmeanshewouldusetoproveit? 


SIMPL. 


The 
means 
of 
the 
senses; 
the 
which 
assureth 
us, 
that 
that 
Tower 
or 
other 
altitude, 
is 
upright 
and 
perpendicular, 
and 
sheweth 
us 
that 
that 
stone, 
or 
other 
grave 
body, 
doth 
slide 
along 
the 
Wall, 
without 
inclining 
a 
hairs 
breadth 
to 
one 
side 
or 
another, 
and 
light 
at 
the 
foot 
thereof 
just 
under 
the 
place 
from 
whenceitwasletfall. 


SALV. 


But 
if 
it 
should 
happen 
that 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
did 
move 
round, 
and 
consequently 
carry 
the 
Tower 
also 
along 
with 
it, 
and 
that 
the 
stone 
did 
then 
also 
grate 
and 
slide 
along 
the 
side 
of 
the 
Tower, 
what 
must 
its 
motion 
be 
then? 


SIMPL. 


In 
this 
case 
we 
may 
rather 
say 
its 
motions: 
for 
it 
would 
have 
one 
wherewith 
to 
descend 
from 
the 
top 
of 
the 
Tower 
to 
the 
bottom, 
and 
should 
necessarily 
haveanotherto 
followthecourseof 
the 
saidTower. 


SALV. 


So 
that 
its 
motion 
should 
be 
compounded 
of 
two, 
to 
wit, 
of 
that 
wherewith 
it 
measureth 
the 
Tower, 
and 
of 
that 
other 
wherewith 
it 
followeth 
the 
same: 
From 
which 
composition 
would 
follow, 
that 
the 
stone 
would 
no 
longer 
describe 
that 
simple 
right 
and 
perpendicular 
line, 
but 
one 
transverse, 
and 
perhapsnotstreight. 


SIMPL. 



I 
can 
say 
nothing 
of 
its 
non-rectitude, 
but 
this 
I 
know 
very 
well, 
that 
it 
would 
of 
necessity 
be 
transverse, 
and 
different 
fromthe 
otherdirectly 
perpendicular, 
which 
itdoth 
describe,theEarthstandingstill. 


SALV. 
You 
see 
then, 
that 
upon 
the 
meer 
observing 
the 
falling 
stone 
to 
glide 
along 
the 
Tower, 
you 
cannot 
certainly 
affirm 
that 
it 
describeth 
a 
line 
which 
is 


streight 
and 
perpendicular, 
unless 
you 
first 
suppose 
that 
the 
Earth 
standeth 
still. 
SIMPL. 
True; 
for 
if 
the 
Earth 
should 
move, 
the 
stones 
motion 
would 
be 
transverse, 


and 
not 
perpendicular. 
SALV. 
Behold 
then 
the 
Paralogism 
of 
Aristotle 
and 
Ptolomey 
to 
be 
evident 
and 


manifest, 
Th 
Paralogism 
of

How 
can 
that 
be? 
To

it

that 
the 
Syllogism

You

SAGR. 
I 
would, 
in 
favour 
of 
Simplicius, 
defend 
Aristotle 
if 
it 
were 
possible, 
or 
at 
least 
better 
satisfie 
my 
self 
concerning 
the 
strength 
of 
your 
illation. 
You 
say, 
that 
the 
seeing 
the 
stone 
rake 
along 
the 
Tower, 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
assure 
us, 
that 
its 
motion 
is 
perpendicular 
(which 
is 
the 
middle 
term 
of 
the 
Syllogism) 



unless 
it 
be 
presupposed, 
that 
the 
Earth 
standeth 
still, 
which 
is 
the 
conclusion 
to 
be 
proved: 
For 
that 
if 
the 
Tower 
did 
move 
together 
with 
the 
Earth, 
and 
the 
stone 
did 
slide 
along 
the 
same, 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
stone 
would 
be 
transverse, 
and 
not 
perpendicular. 
But 
I 
shall 
answer, 
that 
should 
the 
Tower 
move, 
it 
would 
be 
impossible 
that 
the 
stone 
should 
fail 
gliding 
along 
the 
side

SIMPL. 


It 
is 
so; 
for 
if 
you 
would 
have 
the 
stone 
in 
descending 
to 
grate 
upon 
the 
Tower, 
though 
it 
were 
carried 
round 
by 
the 
Earth, 
you 
must 
allow 
the 
stone 
two 
natural 
motions, 
to 
wit, 
the 
straight 
motion 
towards 
the 
Centre, 
and 
the 
circular 
about 
theCentre,thewhichisimpossible. 


SALV. 


Aristotles 
defense 
then 
consisteth 
in 
the 
impossibilitie, 
or 
at 
least 
in 
his 
esteeming 
it 
an 
impossibility, 
that 
the 
stone 
should 
move 
with 
a 
motion 
mixt 
of 
right 
and 
circular: 
for 
if 
he 
did 
not 
hold 
it 
impossible 
that 
the 
stone 
could 
move 
to 
the 
Centre, 
and 
about 
the 
Centre 
at 
once, 
he 
must 
have 
understood, 
that 
it 
might 
come 
to 
pass 
that 
the 
cadent 
stone 
might 
in 
its 
descent, 
race 
the 
Tower 
as 
well 
when 
it 
moved 
as 
when 
it 
stood 
still; 
and 
consequently 
he 
must 
have 
perceived, 
that 
from 
this 
grating 
nothing 
could 
be 
inferred 
touching 
the 
mobility 
or 
immobility 
of 
the 
Earth. 
But 
this 
doth 
not 
any 
way 
excuse 
Aristotle; 
aswell 
because 
he 
ought 
to 
have 
exprest 
it, 
if 
he 
had 
had 
such 
a 
conceit, 
it 
being 
so 
material 
a 
part 
of 
his 
Argument; 
as 
also 
because 
it 
can 
neither 
be 
said 
that 
such 
an 
effect 
is 
impossible, 
nor 
that 
Aristotle 
did 
esteem 
it 
so. 
The 
first 
cannot 
be 
affirmed, 
for 
that 
by 
and 
by 
I 
shall 
shew 
that 
it 
is 
not 
onely 
possible, 
but 
necessary: 
nor 
much 
less 
can 
the 
second 
be 
averred, 
Aristotle 
admitteth 
that 
the 
Fire 
moveth 
directly 
upwards 
by 
nature, 
and 
round 
abent 
by 
participation. 
for 
that 
Aristotle 
himself 
granteth 
fire 
to 
move 
naturally 
upwards 
in 
a 
right 
line, 
and 
to 
move 
about 
with 
the 
diurnal 
motion, 
imparted 
by 
Heaven 
to 
the 
whole 
Element 
of 
Fire, 
and 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
Air: 
If 
therefore 
he 
held 
it 
not 
impossible 
to 
mix 
the 
right 
motion 
upwards, 
with 
the 
circular 
communicated 
to 
the 
Fire 
and 
Air 
from 
the 
concave 
of 
the 
Moon, 
much 
less 
ought 
he 
to 
account 
impossible 
the 
mixture 
of 
the 
right 
motion 
downwards 
of 
the 
stone, 
with 
the 
circular 
which 
we 



presuppose 
natural 
to 
the 
whole 
Terrestrial 
Globe, 
of 
which 
the 
stone 
is 
a 
part. 


SIMPL. 


I 
see 
no 
such 
thing: 
for 
if 
the 
element 
of 
Fire 
revolve 
round 
together 
with 
the 
Air, 
it 
is 
a 
very 
easie, 
yea 
a 
necessary 
thing, 
that 
a 
spark 
of 
fire 
which 
from 
the 
Earth 
mounts 
upwards, 
in 
passing 
thorow 
the 
moving 
air, 
should 
receive 
thesamemotion,beingabodyso

easie

very

or 
a 
Canon 
bullet,

descendeth 
from 
on 
high, 
and 
that 
is 
at 
liberty 
to 
move 
whither 
it 
will, 
should 
suffer 
it 
self 
to 
be 
transported 
either 
by 
the 
air 
or 
any 
other 
thing, 
is 
altogether 
incredible. 
Besides 
that, 
we 
have 
the 
Experiment, 
which 
is 
so 
proper 
to 
our 
purpose, 
of 
the 
stone 
let 
fall 
from 
the 
round 
top 
of 
the 
Mast 
of 
a 
ship, 
which 
when 
the 
ship 
lyeth 
still, 
falleth 
at 
the 
Partners 
of 
the 
Mast; 
but 
when 
the 
ship 
saileth, 
falls 
so 
far 
distant 
from 
that 
place, 
by 
how 
far 
the 
ship 
in 
the 
time 
of 
the 
stones 
falling 
had 
run 
forward;whichwill

SALV. 


There 
is 
a 
great 
disparity 
between 
the 
case 
of 
the 
Ship 
and 
that 
of 
the 
Earth, 
The 
disparity 
between 
the 
fall 
of 
a 
stone 
from 
the 
round 
top 
of 
a 
ship, 
and 
from 
the 
top 
of 
a 
tower. 
if 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
be 
supposed 
to 
have 
a 
diurnal 
motion. 
For 
it 
is 
a 
thing 
very 
manifest, 
that 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Ship, 
as 
it 
is 
not 
natural 
to 
it, 
so 
the 
motion 
of 
all 
those 
things 
that 
are 
in 
it 
is 
accidental, 
whence 
it 
is 
no 
wonder 
that 
the 
stone 
which 
was 
retained 
in 
the 
round 
top, 
being 
left 
at 
liberty, 
descendeth 
downwards 
without 
any 
obligation 
to 
follow 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Ship. 
But 
the 
diurnal 
conversion 
is 
ascribed 
to 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
for 
its 
proper 
and 
natural 
motion, 
and 
consequently, 
it 
is 
so 
to 
all 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
said 
Globe; 
and, 
as 
being 
impress’d 
by 
nature, 
is 
indelible 
in 
them; 
and 
therefore 
that 
stone 
that 
is 
on 
the 
top 
of 
the 
Tower 
hath 
an 
intrinsick 
inclination 
of 
revolving 
about 
the 
Centre 
of 
its 
Whole 
in 
twenty 
four 
hours, 
and 
this 
same 
natrual 
instinct 
it 
exerciseth 
eternally, 
be 
it 
placed 
in 
any 
state 
whatsoever. 
And 
to 
be 
assured 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
this, 
you 
have 
no 
more 
to 
do 
but 
to 
alter 
an 
antiquated 
impression 
made 
in 
your 
mind; 
and 
to 
say, 
Like 
as 
in 
that 
I 
hitherto 
holding 
it 
to 
be 
the 
property 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
to 
rest 
immoveable 
about 
its 
Centre, 
did 
never 
doubt 
or 
question 
but 
that 
all 
whatsoever 
particles 
thereof 
do 
also 
naturally 
remain 
in 
the 
same 
state 



of 
rest: 
So 
it 
is 
reason, 
in 
case 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
did 
move 
round 
by 
natural 
instinct 
in 
twenty 
four 
hours, 
that 
the 
intrinsick 
and 
natural 
inclination 
of 
all 
its 
parts 
should 
also 
be, 
not 
to 
stand 
still, 
but 
to 
follow 
the 
same 
revolution. 
And 
thus 
without 
running 
into 
any 
inconvenience, 
one 
may 
conclude, 
that 
in 
regard 
the 
motion 
conferred 
by 
the 
force 
ofThat 
you 
may 
not 
suspect 
my 
translation, 
or 
wonder 
what 
Oars 
have 
to 
do 
with 
a 
ship, 
you 
are 
to 
know 
that 
the 
Author 
intends 
the 
Gallies 
used 
in 
the 
Mediterrane. 
Oars 
on 
the 
Ship, 
and 
by 
it 
on 
all 
the 
things 
that 
are 
contained 
within 
her, 
is 
not 
natural 
but 
forreign, 
it 
is 
very 
reasonable 
that 
that 
stone, 
it 
being 
separated 
from 
the 
ship, 
do 
reduce 
its 
self 
to 
its 
natural 
disposure, 
and 
return 
to 
exercise 
its 
pure 
simple 
instinct 
given 
it 
by 
nature. 
The 
part 
of 
the 
Air 
inferiour 
to 
the 
higher 
mountains 
doth 
follow 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth. 
To 
this 
I 
add, 
that 
it’s 
necessary, 
that 
at 
least 
that 
part 
of 
the 
Air 
which 
is 
beneath 
the 
greater 
heights 
of 
mountains, 
should 
be 
transported 
and 
carried 
round 
by 
the 
roughness 
of 
the 
Earths 
surface; 
or 
that, 
as 
being 
mixt 
with 
many 
Vapours, 
and 
terrene 
Exhalations, 
it 
do 
naturally 
follow 
the 
diurnal 
motion, 
which 
occurreth 
not 
in 
the 
Air 
about 
the 
ship 
rowed 
by 
Oars: 
So 
that 
your 
arguing 
from 
the 
ship 
to 
the 
Tower 
hathnot 
the 
forceof 
an 
illation; 
because 
that 
stone 
which 
falls 
from 
the 
round 
top 
of 
the 
Mast, 
entereth 
into 
a 
medium, 
which 
is 
unconcern’d 
in 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
ship: 
but 
that 
which 
departeth 
from 
the 
top 
of 
the 
Tower, 
finds 
a 
medium 
that 
hath 
a 
motion 
in 
common 
with 
the 
whole 
Terrestrial 
Globe; 
so 
that 
without 
being 
hindred, 
rather 
being 
assisted 
by 
the 
motionof 
theair, 
itmay 
followtheuniversalcourse

SIMPL. 


I 
cannot 
conceive 
that 
the 
air 
can 
imprint 
in 
a 
very 
great 
stone, 
The 
motion 
of 
the 
Air 
apt 
to 
carry 
with 
it 
light 
things 
but 
not 
heavy. 
or 
in 
a 
gross 
Globe 
of 
Wood 
or 
Ball 
of 
Lead, 
as 
suppose 
of 
two 
hundred 
weight, 
the 
motion 
wherewith 
its 
self 
is 
moved, 
and 
which 
it 
doth 
perhaps 
communicate 
to 
feathers, 
snow, 
and 
other 
very 
light 
things: 
nay, 
I 
see 
that 
a 
weight 
of 
that 
nature, 
being 
exposed 
to 
any 
the 
most 
impetuous 
wind, 
is 
not 
thereby 
removed 
an 
inch 
from 
its 
place; 
now 
consider 
with 
your 
self 
whether 
the 
air 
willcarryitalongtherewith. 


SALV. 



There 
is 
great 
difference 
between 
your 
experiment 
and 
our 
case. 
You 
introduce 
the 
wind 
blowing 
against 
that 
stone, 
supposed 
in 
a 
state 
of 
rest, 
and 
we 
expose 
to 
the 
air, 
which 
already 
moveth, 
the 
stone 
which 
doth 
also 
move 
with 
the 
same 
velocity; 
so 
that 
the 
air 
is 
not 
to 
conferr 
a 
new 
motion 
upon 
it, 
but 
onely 
to 
maintain, 
or 
to 
speak 
better, 
not 
to 
hinder 
the 
motion 
already 
acquired: 
you 
would 
drive 
the 
stone 
with 
a 
strange 
and 
preternatural 
motion, 
and 
we 
desire 
to 
conserve 
it 
in 
its 
natural. 
If 
you 
would 
produce 
a 
more 
pertinent 
experiment, 
you 
should 
say, 
that 
it 
is 
observed, 
if 
not 
with 
the 
eye 
of 
the 
forehead, 
yet 
with 
that 
of 
the 
mind, 
what 
would 
evene, 
if 
an 
eagle 
that 
is 
carried 
by 
the 
course 
of 
the 
wind, 
should 
let 
a 
stone 
fall 
from 
its 
talons; 
which, 
in 
regard 
that 
at 
its 
being 
let 
go, 
it 
went 
along 
with 
the 
wind, 
and 
after 
it 
was 
let 
fall 
it 
entered 
into 
a 
medium 
that 
moved 
with 
equal 
velocity, 
I 
am 
very 
confident 
that 
it 
would 
not 
be 
seen 
to 
descend 
in 
its 
fall 
perpendicularly, 
but 
that 
following 
the 
course 
of 
the 
wind, 
and 
adding 
thereto 
that 
of 
its 
particulargravity,itwould 
movewith

But 
it 
would 
first 
be

Well

And 
that

may 
no

hold

tell 
me,

do 
you 
really

the

squares 
so 
very 
well 
with

though

I

I 
rather 
desire 
that 
you 
would 
continue 
therein, 
and 
hold 
for 
certain, 
that 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
Earth 
would 
exactly 
answer 
that 
of

provided, 
that 
when 
it 
shall 
appearprejudicialto 
your 
cause, 
you 
would 
notbe 
humorous 
and 
alter 
your 
thoughts. 
You 
may 
haply 
say, 
Forasmuch 
as 
when 
the 
ship 
stands 
still, 
the 
stone 
falls 
at 
the 
foot 
of 
the 
Mast, 
and 
when 
she 
is 
under 
sail, 
it 
lights 
far 
from 
thence, 
that 
therefore 
by 
conversion, 
from 
the 
stones 
falling 
at 
the 
foot 
is 
argued 
the 
ships 
standing 
still, 
and 
from 
its 
falling 
far 
from 
thence 
is 
argued 
her 
moving; 
and 
because 
that 
which 
occurreth 
to 
the 
ship, 
ought 
likewise 
to 
befall 
the 
Earth: 
that 
therefore 
from 
the 
falling 
of 
the 
stone 
at 
the 
foot 
of 
the 
Tower 
is 
necessarily 
inferred 
the 
immobility 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe. 
Isnotthisyourargumentation?

It 
is, 
and 
reduced

conciseness, 
as 
that

most 
easie 
to 
be 
apprehended.

Now 
tell 
me; 
if 
the 
stone 
let 
fall 
from 
the 
Round-top, 
when 
the 
ship 
is 
in 
a 
swift 
course, 
should 
fall 
exactly 
in 
the 
same 
place 
of 
the

in 
which 
it 
falleth 
when 
the

a 
ship 
lights 
in 
the

place, 
whether 
the

doth 
move

So 
that 
the

holding 
true 
in

in

one 
cannot 
from

This 
is 
a 
subtilty 
worthy 
of 
Sagredus: 
But 
whether 
this 
variation 
be 
to 
be 
observed 
in 
the 
motion, 
or 
in 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
Earth, 
it 
must 
needs 
be 
very 
small, 
it 
must 
needs 
be 
swallowed 
up 
in 
those 
very 
great 
ones 
which 
sundry 
accidents 
continually 
produce. 
It 
is 
requisite 
to 
be 
very 
cautious 
in 
admitting 
experim 
nts 
for 
true, 
to 
those 
who 
never 
tried 
them. 
And 
all 
this 
hath 
been 
spoken 
and 
granted 
on 
good 
grounds 
to 
Simplicius, 
and 
only 
with 
n 
intent 
to 
advertise 
him 
how 
much 
it 
importeth 
to 
be 
cautious 
in 
granting 
many 
experiments 
for 
true 
to 
those 
who 
never 
had 
tried 
them, 
but 
only 
eagerly 
alledged 
them 
just 
as 
they 
ought 
to 
be 
for 
the 
serving 
their 
purpose: 
This 
is 
spoken, 
I 
say, 
by 
way 
of 
surplussage 
and 
Corollary 
to 
Simplicius, 
for 
the 
real 
truth 
is, 
Experiments 
and 
arguments 
against 
the 
Earths 
motion 
seem 
so 
far 
concluding, 
as 
they 
lie 
hid 
under 
equivokes. 
that 
as 
concerning 
these 
shots, 
the 
same 
ought 
exactly 
to 
befall 
aswell 
in 
the 
motion 
as 
in 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe; 
as 
likewise 
it 
will 
happen 
in 
all 
the 
other 
experiments 
that 
either 
have 
been 
or 
can 
be 
produced, 
which 
have 
at 
first 
blush 
so 
much 
semblance 
of 
truth, 
as 
the 
antiquated 
opinion 
of 
the 
Earths 
motion 
hath 
of 
equivocation. 


SAGR. 


As 
for 
my 
part 
I 
am 
fully 
satisfied, 
and 
very 
well 
understand 
that 
who 
so 
shall 
imprint 
in 
his 
fancy 
this 
general 
community 
of 
the 
diurnal 
conversion 
amongst 
all 
things 
Terrestrial, 
to 
all 
which 
it 
naturally 
agreeth, 
aswell 
as 
in 
the 
old 
conceit 
of 
its 
rest 
about 
the 
centre, 
shall 
doubtlesse 
discern 
the 
fallacy 
and 
equivoke 
which 
made 
the 
arguments 
produced 
seem 
eoncluding. 
There 
yet 
remains 
in 
me 
some 
haesitancy 
(as 
I 
have 
hinted 
before) 
touching 
the 
flight 
of 
birds; 
the 
which 
having 
as 
it 
were 
an 
animate 
faculty 
of 
moving 
at 
their 
pleasure 
with 
a 
thousand 
motions, 
and 
to 
stay 
long 
in 
the 
Air 
separated 
from 
the 
Earth, 
and 
therein 
with 
most 
irregular 
windings 
to 
go 
fluttering 
to 
and 
again, 
I 
cannot 
conceive 
how 
amongst 
so 
great 
a 
confusion 
of 
motions, 
they 
should 
be 
able 
to 
retain 
the 
first 
commune 
motion; 
and 
in 
what 
manner, 
having 
once 
made 
any 
stay 
behind, 
they 
can 
get 
it 
up 
again, 
and 
overtake 
the 
same 
with 
flying, 
and 
keep 
pace 
with 
the 
Towers 
and 
trees 
which 
hurry 
with 
so 
precipitant 
a 
course 
towards 
the 
East; 
I 
say 
so 
precipitant, 
for 
in 
the 
great 
circle 
of 
the 
Globe 
it 
is 
little 
lesse 
than 
a 
thousand 
miles 
an 
hour, 
whereof 
the 
flightoftheswallowI

SALV. 


If 
the 
birds 
were 
to 
keep 
pace 
with 
the 
course 
of 
the 
trees 
by 
help 
of 
their 
wings, 
they 
would 
of 
necessity 
flie 
very 
fast; 
and 
if 
they 
were 
deprived 
of 
the 
universal 
conversion, 
they 
would 
lag 
as 
far 
behind; 
and 
their 
flight 
would 
seem 
as 
furious 
towards 
the 
West, 
and 
to 
him 
that 
could 
discern 
the 
same, 
it 
would 
much 
exceed 
the 
flight 
of 
an 
arrow; 
but 
I 
think 
we 
could 
not 
be 
able 
to 
perceive 
it, 
no 
more 
than 
we 
see 
a 
Canon 
bullet, 
whil’st 
driven 
by 
the 
fury 
of 
the 
fire, 
it 
flieth 
through 
the 
Air: 
But 
the 
truth 
is 
that 
the 
proper 
motion 
of 
birds, 
I 
mean 
of 
their 
flight, 
hath 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
universal 
motion, 
to 
which 
it 
is 
neither 
an 
help, 
nor 
an 
hinderance; 
and 
that 
which 
maintaineth 
the 
said 
motion 
unaltered 
in 
the 
birds, 
is 
the 
Air 
it 
self, 
thorough 
which 
they 
flie, 
which 
naturally 
follovving 
the 
Vertigo 
of 
the 
Earth, 
like 
as 
it 
carrieth 
the 
clouds 
along 
with 
it, 
so 
it 
transporteth

but 
for 
that

sleep 
perpetually. 


SAGR. 


That 
the 
Air 
can 
carry 
the 
clouds 
along 
with 
it, 
as 
being 
matters 
easie 
for 
their 
lightnesse 
to 
be 
moved 
and 
deprived 
of 
all 
other 
contrary 
inclination, 
yea 
more, 
as 
being 
matters 
that 
partake 
also 
of 
the 
conditions 
and 
properties 
of 
the 
Earth; 
I 
comprehend 
without 
any 
difficulty; 
but 
that 
birds, 
which 
as 
having 
life, 
may 
move 
with 
a 
motion 
quite 
contrary 
to 
the 
diurnal, 
once 
having 
surceased 
the 
said 
motion, 
the 
Air 
should 
restore 
them 
to 
it, 
seems 
to 
me 
a 
little 
strange, 
and 
the 
rather 
for 
that 
they 
are 
solid 
and 
weighty 
bodies; 
and 
withal, 
we 
see; 
as 
hath 
been 
said, 
stones 
and 
other 
grave 
bodies 
to 
lie 
unmoved 
against 
the 
impetus 
of 
the 
air; 
and 
when 
they 
suffer 
themselves 
to 
be 
overcome 
thereby, 
they 
never 
acquire 
so 
much 
velocity 
as 
the 
wind 
which 
carrieth 
them. 


SALV. 


We 
ascribe 
not 
so 
little 
force, 
Sagredus, 
to 
the 
moved 
Air, 
which 
is 
able 
to 
move 
and 
bear 
before 
it 
ships 
full 
fraught, 
to 
tear 
up 
trees 
by 
the 
roots, 
and 
overthrow 
Towers 
when 
it 
moveth 
swiftly; 
and 
yet 
we 
cannot 
say 
that 
the 



motion 
of 
the 
Air 
in 
these 
violent 
operations 
is 
neer 
so 
violent, 
as 
that 
of 
the 
diurnalrevolution. 


SIMP. 


You 
see 
then 
that 
the 
moved 
Air 
may 
also 
cotinue 
the 
motion 
of 
projects, 
according 
to 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
Aristotle; 
and 
it 
seemed 
to 
me 
very 
strange 
that 
heshouldhaveerredinthisparticular. 


SALV. 


It 
may 
without 
doubt, 
in 
case 
it 
could 
continue 
it 
self, 
but 
lik 
as 
when 
the 
wind 
ceasing 
neither 
ships 
go 
on, 
nor 
trees 
are 
blown 
down, 
so 
the 
motion 
in 
the 
Air 
not 
continuing 
after 
the 
stone 
is 
gone 
out 
of 
the 
hand, 
and 
the 
Air 
ceasing 
to 
move, 
it 
followeth 
that 
it 
must 
be 
something 
else 
besides 
the 
Air 
that 
maketh 
theprojectsto 
move. 


SIMP. 


But 
how 
upon 
the 
winds 
being 
laid, 
doth 
the 
ship 
cease 
to 
move? 
Nay 
you 
may 
see 
that 
when 
the 
wind 
is 
down, 
and 
the 
sails 
furl’d, 
the 
vessel 
continueth 
torunwhole 
miles. 


SALV. 


But 
this 
maketh 
against 
your 
self 
Simplicius, 
for 
that 
the 
wind 
being 
laid 
that 
filling 
thesails 
droveon

yet 
neverthelesse 
dothit

help 
of 
the

SIMP. 


It 
might 
be 
said 
that 
the 
water 
was 
the 
medium 
which 
carried 
forward 
the 
ship,and 
maintain’dit 
inmotion. 


SALV. 


It 
might 
indeed 
be 
so 
affirmed, 
if 
you 
would 
speak 
quite 
contrary 
to 
truth; 
for 
the 
truth 
is, 
that 
the 
water, 
by 
reason 
of 
its 
great 
resistance 
to 
the 
division 
made 
by 
the 
hull 
of 
the 
ship, 
doth 
with 
great 
noise 
resist 
the 
same; 
nor 
doth 
it 



permit 
it 
of 
a 
great 
while 
to 
acquire 
that 
velocity 
which 
the 
wind 
would 
confer 
upon 
it, 
were 
the 
obstacle 
of 
the 
water 
removed. 
Perhaps 
Simplicius 
you 
have 
never 
considered 
with 
what 
fury 
the 
water 
besets 
a 
bark, 
whil’st 
it 
forceth 
its 
way 
through 
a 
standing 
water 
by 
help 
of 
Oars 
or 
Sails: 
for 
if 
you 
had 
ever 
minded 
that 
effect, 
you 
would 
not 
now 
have 
produced 
such 
an 
absurdity. 
And 
I 
am 
thinking 
that 
you 
have 
hitherto 
been 
one 
of 
those 
who 
to 
find 
out 
how 
such 
things 
succeed, 
and 
to 
come 
to

of 
natural

do 
not 
betake 
themselves 
to 
a

a 
Crosse-bow,

a 
piece

but 
retire 
into 
their

and 
turn 
over 
Indexes

they 
are

be 
much

it. 
For 
if

be

by

and 
if 
to 
be 
wise, 
be 
to 
think 
ones

so, 
they 
enjoy 
a 
very 
great 
happinesse, 
for 
that 
they 
may

themselves 
that 
they

all

in 
soorn 
of 
those 
who 
knowing, 
that 
they 
understand 
not 
what 
these 
think 
they 
understand, 
and 
consequently 
seeking 
that 
they 
know 
not 
the 
very 
least 
particle 
of 
what

knowable, 
kill 
themselves 
with 
waking

consume 
their

in 
experiments

observations. 
But 
pray 
you 
let 
us 
return 
to 
our 
birds; 
touching 
which 
you 
have 
said, 
that 
the 
Air 
being 
moved 
with 
great 
velocity, 
might 
restore 
unto 
them 
that 
part 
of 
the 
diurnal 
motion 
which 
amongst 
the 
windings 
of 
their 
flight 
they 
might 
have 
lost; 
to 
which 
I 
reply, 
that 
the 
agitated 
Air 
seemeth 
unable 
to 
confer 
on 
a 
solid 
and 
grave 
body, 
so 
great 
a 
velocity 
as 
its 
own: 
And 
because 
that 
of 
the 
Air 
is 
as 
great 
as 
that 
of 
the 
Earth, 
I 
cannot 
think 
that 
the

to

Yourmaking 
agreater 
scrupleof 
thisthanof 
theother 
instances 
dependeth,if 
I 
mistake 
not, 
upon 
the 
birds 
being 
animated, 
and 
thereby 
enabled 
to 
use 
their 
strength 
at 
pleasure 
against 
the 
primary 
motion 
in-bred 
in 
terrene 
bodies: 
like 
as 
for 
example, 
we 
see 
them 
whil’st 
they 
are 
alive 
to 
fly 
upwards, 
a 
thing 
altogether 
impossible 
for 
them 
to 
do 
as 
they 
are 
grave 
bodies; 
whereas 
being 
dead 
they 
can 
onely 
fall 
downwards; 
and 
therefore 
you 
hold 
that 
the 
reasons 
that 
are 
of 
force 
in 
all 
the 
kinds 
of 
projects 
above 
named, 
cannot 
take 
place 
in 
birds: 
Now 
this 
is 
very 
true; 
and 
because 
it 
is 
so, 
Sagredus, 
that 
doth 
not 
appear 
to 
be 
done 
in 
those 
projects, 
The 
answer 
to 
the 
argument 
taken 
from 
the 
flight 
of 
birds 
contrary 
to 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth. 
which 
we 
see 
the 
birds 
to 
do. 
For 
if 
from 
the 
top 
of 
a 
Tower 
you 
let 
fall 
a 
dead 
bird 
and 
a 
live 
one, 
the 
dead 
bird 
shall 
do 
the 
same 
that 
a 
stone 
doth, 
that 
is, 
it 
shall 
first 
follow 
the 
general 
motion 
diurnal, 
and 
then 
the 
motion 
of 
descent, 
as 
grave; 
but 
if 
the 
bird 
let 
fall, 
be 
a 
live, 
what 
shall 
hinder 
it, 
(there 
ever 
remaining 
in 
it 
the 
diurnal 
motion) 
from 
soaring 
by 
help 
of 
its 
wings 
to 
what 
place 
of 
the 
Horizon 
it 
shall 
please? 
and 
this 
new 
motion, 
as 
being 
peculiar 
to 
the 
bird, 
and 
not 
participated 
by 
us, 
must 
of 
necessity 
be 
visible 
to 
us; 
and 
if 
it 
be 
moved 
by 
help 
of 
its 
wings 
towards 
the 
West, 
what 
shall 
hinder 
it 
from 
returning 
with 
a 
like 
help 
of 
its 
wings 
unto 
the 
Tower. 
And, 
because, 
in 
the 
last 
place, 
the 
bird 
swending 
its 
flight 
towards 
the 
West 
was 
no 
other 
than 
a 
withdrawing 
from 
the 
diurnal 
motion, 
(which 
hath, 
suppose 
ten 
degrees 
of 
velocity) 
one 
degree 
onely, 
there 
did 
thereupon 
remain 
to 
the 
bird 
whil’st 
it 
was 
in 
its 
flight 
nine 
degrees 
of 
velocity, 
and 
so 
soon 
as 
it 
did 
alight 
upon 
the 
the 
Earth, 
the 
ten 
common 
degrees 
returned 
to 
it, 
to 
which, 
by 
flying 
towards 
the 
East 
it 
might 
adde 
one, 
and 
with 
those 
eleven 
overtake 
the 
Tower. 
And 
in 
short, 
if 
we 
well 
consider, 
and 
more 
narrowly 
examine 
the 
effects 
of 
the 
flight 
of 
birds, 
they 
differ 
from 
the 
projects 
shot 
or 
thrown 
to 
any 
part 
of 
the 
World 
in 
nothing, 
save 
onely 
that 
the 
projects 
are 
moved 
by 
an 
external 
projicient, 
An 
experiment 
with 
which 
alone 
is 
shewn 
the 
nullity 
of 
all 
the 



objections 
produced 
against 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth. 
and 
the 
birds 
by 
an 
internal 
principle. 
And 
here 
for 
a 
final 
proof 
of 
the 
nullity 
of 
all 
the 
experiments 
before 
illedged, 
I 
conceive 
it 
now 
a 
time 
and 
place 
convenient 
to 
demonstrate 
a 
way 
how 
to 
make 
an 
exact 
trial 
of 
them 
all. 
Shut 
your 
self 
up 
with 
some 
friend 
in 
the 
grand 
Cabbin 
between 
the 
decks 
of 
some 
large 
Ship, 
and 
there 
procure 
gnats, 
flies, 
and 
such 
other 
small 
winged 
creatures: 
get 
also 
a 
great 
tub 
(or 
other 
vessel) 
full 
of 
water, 
and 
within 
it 
put 
certain 
fishes; 
let 
also 
a 
certain 
bottle 
be 
hung 
up, 
which 
drop 
by 
drop 
letteth 
forth 
its 
water 
into 
another 
bottle 
placed 
underneath, 
having 
a 
narrow 
neck: 
and, 
the 
Ship 
lying 
still, 
observe 
diligently 
how 
those 
small 
winged 
animals 
fly 
with 
like 
velocity 
towards 
all 
parts 
of 
the 
Cabin; 
how 
the 
fishes 
swim 
indifferently 
towards 
all 
sides; 
and 
how 
the 
distilling 
drops 
all 
fall 
into 
the 
bottle 
placed 
underneath. 
And 
casting 
any 
thing 
towards 
your 
friend, 
you 
need 
not 
throw 
it 
with 
more 
force 
one 
way 
then 
another, 
provided 
the 
distances 
be 
equal: 
and 
leaping, 
as 
the 
saying 
is, 
with 
your 
feet 
closed, 
you 
will 
reach 
as 
far 
one 
way 
as 
another. 
Having 
observed 
all 
these 
particulars, 
though 
no 
man 
doubteth 
that 
so 
long 
as 
the 
vessel 
stands 
still, 
they 
ought 
to 
succeed 
in 
this 
manner; 
make 
the 
Ship 
to 
move 
with 
what 
velocity 
you 
please; 
for 
(so 
long 
as 
the 
motion 
is 
uniforme, 
and 
not 
fluctuating 
this 
way 
and 
that 
way) 
you 
shall 
not 
discern 
any 
the 
least 
alteration 
in 
all 
the 
forenamed 
effects; 
nor 
can 
you 
gather 
by 
any 
of 
them 
whether 
the 
Ship 
doth 
move 
or 
stand 
still. 
In 
leaping 
you 
shall 
reach 
as 
far 
upon 
the 
floor, 
as 
before; 
nor 
for 
that 
the 
Ship 
moveth 
shall 
you 
make 
a 
greater 
leap 
towards 
the 
poop 
than 
towards 
the 
prow; 
howbeit 
in 
the 
time 
that 
you 
staid 
in 
the 
Air, 
the 
floor 
under 
your 
feet 
shall 
have 
run 
the 
contrary 
way 
to 
that 
of 
your 
jump; 
and 
throwing 
any 
thing 
to 
your 
companion 
you 
shall 
not 
need 
to 
cast 
it 
with 
more 
strength 
that 
it 
may 
reach 
him, 
if 
he 
shall 
be 
towards 
the 
prow, 
and 
you 
towards 
the 
poop, 
then 
if 
you 
stood 
in 
a 
contrary 
situation; 
the 
drops 
shall 
all 
distill 
as 
before 
into 
the 
inferiour 
bottle, 
and 
not 
so 
much 
as 
one 
shall 
fall 
towards 
the 
poop, 
albeit 
whil’st 
the 
drop 
is 
in 
the 
Air, 
the 
Ship 
shall 
have 
run 
many 
feet; 
the 
Fishes 
in 
their 
water 
shall 
not 
swim 
with 
more 
trouble 
towards 
the 
fore-part, 
than 
towards 
the 
hinder 
part 
of 
the 
tub; 
but 
shall 
with 
equal 
velocity 
make 
to 
the 
bait 
placed 
on 
any 
side 
of 
the 
tub; 
and 
lastly, 
the 
flies 
and 
gnats 
shall 
continue 
their 
flight 
indifferentlytowards 
allparts; 
nor 
shall 
they 
ever 
happen 
to 
be 
driven 
together 
towards 
the 
side 
of 
the 
Cabbin 
next 
the 
prow, 
as 
if 
they 
were 
wearied 
with 
following 
the 
swift 
course 
of 
the 
Ship, 
from 
which 
through 
their 
suspension 
in 
the 
Air, 
they 
had 
been 
long 
separated; 
and 
if 



burning 
a 
few 
graines 
of 
incense 
you 
make 
a 
little 
smoke, 
you 
shall 
see 
it 
ascend 
on 
high, 
and 
there 
in 
manner 
of 
a 
cloud 
suspend 
it 
self, 
and 
move 
indifferently, 
not 
inclining 
more 
to 
one 
side 
than 
another: 
and 
of 
this 
correspondence 
of 
effects 
the 
cause 
is 
for 
that 
the 
Ships 
motion 
is 
common 
to 
all 
the 
things 
contained 
in 
it, 
and 
to 
the 
Air 
also; 
I 
mean 
if 
those 
things 
be 
shut 
up 
in 
the 
Cabbin: 
but 
in 
case 
those 
things 
were 
above 
deck 
in 
the 
open 
Air, 
and 
not 
obliged 
to 
follow 
the 
course 
of 
the 
Ship, 
differences 
more 
or 
lesse 
notable 
would 
be 
observed 
in 
some 
of 
the 
fore-named 
effects, 
and 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
but 
that 
the 
smoke 
would 
stay 
behind 
as 
much 
as 
the 
Air 
it 
self; 
the 
flies 
also, 
and 
the 
gnats 
being 
hindered 
by 
the 
Air 
would 
not 
be 
able 
to 
follow 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Ship, 
if 
they 
were 
separated 
at 
any 
distance 
from 
it. 
But 
keeping 
neer 
thereto, 
because 
the 
Ship 
it 
self 
as 
being 
an 
unfractuous 
Fabrick, 
carrieth 
along 
with 
it 
part 
of 
its 
neerest 
Air, 
they 
would 
follow 
the 
said 
Ship 
without 
any 
pains 
or 
difficulty. 
And 
for 
the 
like 
reason 
we 
see 
sometimes 
in 
riding 
post, 
that 
the 
troublesome 
flies 
andTafaris, 
horse-flyes. 
hornets 
do 
follow 
the 
horses 
flying 
sometimes 
to 
one, 
sometimes 
to 
another 
part 
of 
the 
body, 
but 
in 
the 
falling 
drops 
the 
difference 
would 
be 
very 
small; 
and 
inthesalts, 
andprojections 
ofgravebodiesaltogetherimperceptible. 


SAGR. 


Though 
it 
came 
not 
into 
my 
thoughts 
to 
make 
triall 
of 
these 
observations, 
when 
I 
was 
at 
Sea, 
yet 
am 
I 
confident 
that 
they 
will 
succeed 
in 
the 
same 
manner, 
as 
you 
have 
related; 
in 
confirmation 
of 
which 
I 
remember 
that 
being 
in 
my 
Cabbin 
I 
have 
asked 
an 
hundred 
times 
whether 
the 
Ship 
moved 
or 
stood 
still; 
and 
sometimes 
I 
have 
imagined 
that 
it 
moved 
one 
way, 
when 
it 
steered 
quite 
another 
way. 
I 
am 
therefore 
as 
hitherto 
satisfied 
and 
convinced 
of 
the 
nullity 
of 
all 
those 
experiments 
that 
have 
been 
produced 
in 
proof 
of 
the 
negative 
part. 
There 
now 
remains 
the 
objection 
founded 
upon 
that 
which 
experience 
shews 
us, 
namely, 
that 
a 
swift 
Vertigo 
or 
whirling 
about 
hath 
a 
faculty 
to 
extrude 
and 
disperse 
the 
matters 
adherent 
to 
the 
machine 
that 
turns 
round; 
whereupon 
many 
were 
of 
opinion, 
and 
Ptolomy 
amongst 
the 
rest, 
that 
if 
the 
Earth 
should 
turn 
round 
with 
so 
great 
velocity, 
the 
stones 
and 
creatures 
upon 
it 
should 
be 
tost 
into 
the 
Skie, 
and 
that 
there 
could 
not 
be 
a 
morter 
strong 
enough 
to 
fasten 
buildings 
so 
to 
their 
foundations, 
but 
that 
they 
would 
likewise 
sufferalikeextrusion. 



SALV. 


Before 
I 
come 
to 
answer 
this 
objection, 
I 
cannot 
but 
take 
notice 
of 
that 
which 
I 
have 
an 
hundred 
times 
observed, 
and 
not 
without 
laughter, 
to 
come 
into 
the 
minds 
of 
most 
men 
so 
soon 
as 
ever 
they 
hear 
mention 
made 
of 
this 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth, 
which 
is 
believed 
by 
them 
so 
fixt 
and 
immoveable, 
that 
they 
not 
only 
never 
doubted 
of 
that 
rest, 
but 
have 
ever 
strongly 
believed 
that 
all 
other 
men 
aswell 
as 
they, 
have 
held 
it 
to 
be 
created 
immoveable, 
and 
so 
to 
have 
continued 
through 
all 
succeeding 
ages: 
The 
stupidity 
of 
some 
that 
think 
the 
Earth 
to 
have 
begun 
to 
move, 
when 
Pythagoras 
began 
to 
affirme 
that 
it 
did 
so. 
and 
being 
setled 
in 
this 
perswasion, 
they 
stand 
amazed 
to 
hear 
that 
any 
one 
should 
grant 
it 
motion, 
as 
if, 
after 
that 
he 
had 
held 
it 
to 
be 
immoveable, 
he 
had 
fondly 
thought 
it 
to 
commence 
its 
motion 
then 
(and 
not 
till 
then) 
when 
Pythagoras 
(or 
whoever 
else 
was 
the 
first 
hinter 
of 
its 
mobility) 
said 
that 
it 
did 
move. 
Now 
that 
such 
a 
foolish 
conceit 
(I 
mean 
of 
thinking 
that 
those 
who 
admit 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth, 
have 
first 
thought 
it 
to 
stand 
still 
from 
its 
creation, 
untill 
the 
time 
of 
Pythagoras, 
and 
have 
onely 
made 
it 
moveable 
after 
that 
Pythagoras 
esteemed 
it 
so) 
findeth 
a 
place 
in 
the 
mindes 
of 
the 
vulgar, 
and 
men 
of 
shallow 
capacities, 
I 
do 
not 
much 
wonder; 
but 
that 
such 
persons 
as 
Aristotle 
and 
Ptolomy 
should 
also 
run 
into 
this 
childish 
mistake, 
is 
to 
my 
thinkingamoreadmirableandunpardonablefolly. 


SAGR. 


You 
believe 
then, 
Salviatus, 
that 
Ptolomy 
thought, 
that 
in 
his 
Disputation 
he 
was 
to 
maintain 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
Earth 
against 
such 
persons, 
as 
granting 
it 
to 
have 
been 
immoveable, 
untill 
the 
time 
of 
Pythagoras, 
did 
affirm 
it 
to 
have 
been 
but 
then 
made 
moveable, 
when 
the 
said 
Pythagoras 
ascribed 
unto 
it 
motion. 


SALV. 


We 
can 
think 
no 
other, 
if 
we 
do 
but 
consider 
the 
way 
he 
taketh 
to 
confute 
their 
assertion; 
Aristotle 
and 
Ptolomy 
seem 
to 
confute 
the 
mobility 
of 
the 
Earth 
against 
those 
who 
thought 
that 
it 
having 
a 
long 
time 
stood 
still, 
did 
begin 
to 
move 
in 
the 
time 
of 
Pythagoras 
the 
confutation 
of 
which 
consists 
in 
the 
demolition 
of 
buildings, 
and 
the 
tossing 
of 
stones, 
living 
creatures 
and 
men 
themselves 
up 
into 
the 
Air. 
And 
because 
such 
overthrows 
and 
extrusions 



cannot 
be 
made 
upon 
buildings 
and 
men, 
which 
were 
not 
before 
on 
the 
Earth, 
nor 
can 
men 
be 
placed, 
nor 
buildings 
erected 
upon 
the 
Earth, 
unlesse 
when 
it 
standeth 
still; 
hence 
therefore 
it 
is 
cleer, 
that 
Ptolomy 
argueth 
against 
those, 
who 
having 
granted 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
Earth 
for 
some 
time, 
that 
is, 
so 
long 
as 
living 
creatures, 
stones, 
and 
Masons 
were 
able 
to 
abide 
there, 
and 
to 
build 
Palaces 
and 
Cities, 
make 
it 
afterwards 
precipitately 
moveable 
to 
the 
overthrow 
and 
destructiof 
Edifices, 
and 
living 
creatures, 
&c. 
For 
if 
he 
had 
undertook 
to 
dispute 
against 
such 
as 
had 
ascribed 
that 
revolution 
to 
the 
Earth 
from 
its 
first 
creation, 
he 
would 
have 
confuted 
them 
by 
saying, 
that 
if 
the 
Earth 
had 
alwayes 
moved, 
there 
could 
never 
have 
been 
placed 
upon 
it 
either 
men 
or 
stones; 
much 
less 
could 
buildings 
have 
been

SIMP. 


Idonotwellconceive 
these 
Aristotelick 
andPtolomaick 
inconveniences. 


SALV. 


Ptolomey 
either 
argueth 
against 
those 
who 
have 
esteemed 
the 
Earth 
always 
moveable; 
or 
against 
such 
as 
have 
held 
that 
it 
stood 
for 
some 
time 
still, 
and 
hath 
since 
been 
set 
on 
moving. 
If 
against 
the 
first, 
he 
ought 
to 
say, 
that 
the 
Earth 
did 
not 
always 
move, 
for 
that 
then 
there 
would 
never 
have 
been 
men, 
animals, 
or 
edifices 
on 
the 
Earth, 
its 
vertigo 
not 
permitting 
them 
to 
stay 
thereon. 
But 
in 
that 
he 
arguing, 
saith 
that 
the 
Earth 
doth 
not 
move, 
because 
that 
beasts, 
men, 
and 
houses 
before 
plac’d 
on 
the 
Earth 
would 
precipitate, 
he 
supposeth 
the 
Earth 
to 
havebeen 
once 
insuch 
astate, 
as 
that 
it 
did 
admit 
men 
and 
beasts 
to 
stay, 
and 
build 
thereon; 
the 
which 
draweth 
on 
the 
consequence, 
that 
it 
did 
for 
some 
time 
stand 
still, 
to 
wit, 
was 
apt 
for 
the 
abode 
of 
animals 
and 
erectionof 
buildings. 
Doyounow 
conceivewhatIwouldsay? 


SIMP. 


I 
do, 
and 
I 
do 
not: 
but 
this 
little 
importeth 
to 
the 
merit 
of 
the 
cause; 
nor 
can 
a 
small 
mistake 
of 
Ptolomey, 
committed 
through 
inadvertencie 
be 
sufficient 
to 
move 
the 
Earth, 
when 
it 
is 
immoveable. 
But 
omitting 
cavils, 
let 
us 
come 
to 
thesubstanceoftheargument, 
whichto 
me 
seemsunanswerable. 



SALV. 


And 
I, 
Simplicius, 
will 
drive 
it 
home, 
and 
re-inforce 
it, 
by 
shewing 
yet 
more 
sensibly, 
that 
it 
is 
true 
that 
grave 
bodies 
turn’d 
with 
velocity 
about 
a 
settled 
centre, 
do 
acquire 
an 
impetus 
of 
moving, 
and 
receding 
to 
a 
distance 
from 
that 
centre, 
even 
then 
when 
they 
are 
in 
a 
state 
of 
having 
a 
propension 
of 
moving 
naturally 
to 
the 
same. 
Tie 
a 
bottle 
that 
hath 
water 
in 
it, 
to 
the 
end 
of 
a 
cord, 
and 
holding 
the 
other 
end 
fast 
in 
your 
hand, 
and 
making 
the 
cord 
and 
your 
arm 
the 
semi-diameter, 
and 
the 
knitting 
of 
the 
shoulder 
the 
centre, 
swing 
the 
bottle 
very 
fast 
about, 
so 
as 
that 
it 
may 
describe 
the 
circumference 
of 
a 
circle, 
which, 
whether 
it 
be 
parallel 
to 
the 
Horizon, 
or 
perpendicular 
to 
it, 
or 
any 
way 
inclined, 
it 
shall 
in 
all 
cases 
follow, 
that 
the 
water 
will 
not 
fall 
out 
of 
the 
bottle: 
nay, 
he 
that 
shall 
swing 
it, 
shall 
find 
the 
cord 
always 
draw, 
and 
strive 
to 
go 
farther 
from 
the 
shoulder. 
And 
if 
you 
bore 
a 
hole 
in 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
bottle, 
you 
shall 
see 
the 
water 
spout 
forth 
no 
less 
upwards 
into 
the 
skie, 
than 
laterally, 
and 
downwards 
to 
the 
Earth; 
and 
if 
instead 
of 
water, 
you 
shall 
put 
little 
pebble 
stones 
into 
the 
bottle, 
and 
swing 
it 
in 
the 
same 
manner, 
you 
shall 
find 
that 
they 
will 
strive 
in 
the 
like 
manner 
against 
the 
cord. 
And 
lastly, 
we 
see 
boys 
throw 
stones 
a 
great 
way, 
by 
swinging 
round 
a 
piece 
of 
a 
stick, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
which 
the 
stone 
is 
let 
into 
a 
slit 
(which 
stick 
is 
called 
by 
them 
a 
sling;) 
all 
which 
are 
arguments 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
conclusion, 
to 
wit, 
that 
the 
vertigo 
or 
swing 
conferreth 
upon 
the 
moveable, 
a 
motion 
towards 
the 
circumference, 
in 
case 
the 
motion 
be 
swift: 
and 
therefore 
if 
the 
Earth 
revolve 
about 
its 
own 
centre, 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
superficies, 
and 
especially 
towards 
the 
great 
circle, 
as 
being 
incomparably 
more 
swift 
than 
those 
before 
named, 
oughttoextrudeallthingsupintotheair. 


SIMP. 


The 
Argument 
seemeth 
to 
me 
very 
well 
proved 
and 
inforced; 
and 
I 
believe 
it 
would 
beanhardmatter 
toanswerandoverthrowit. 


SALV. 


Its 
solution 
dependeth 
upon 
certain 
notions 
no 
less 
known 
and 
believed 
by 
you, 
than 
by 
my 
self: 
but 
because 
they 
come 
not 
into 
your 
mind, 
therefore 
it 
is 
that 
you 
perceive 
not 
the 
answer; 
wherefore, 
without 
telling 
you 
it 
(for 
that 



you 
know 
the 
same 
already) 
I 
shall 
with 
onely 
assisting 
your 
memory, 
make 
you 
torefutethisargument. 


SIMP. 


I 
have 
often 
thought 
of 
your 
way 
of 
arguing, 
which 
hath 
made 
me 
almost 
think 
that 
you 
lean 
to 
that 
opinion 
of 
Plato, 
Our 
knowledg 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
reminiscence 
according 
to 
Plato. 
Quòd 
nostrum 
scire 
sit 
quoddam 
reminisci; 
therefore 
I 
intreat 
you 
to 
free 
me 
from 
this 
doubt, 
by 
letting 
me 
know 
your 
judgment. 


SALV. 


What 
I 
think 
of 
the 
opinion 
of 
Plato, 
you 
may 
gather 
from 
my 
words 
and 
actions. 
Ihave 
already 
in 
the 
precedentconferences 
expresly 
declared 
my 
self 
more 
than 
once; 
I 
will 
pursue 
the 
same 
style 
in 
the 
present 
case, 
which 
may 
hereafter 
serve 
you 
for 
an 
example, 
thereby 
the 
more 
easily 
to 
gather 
what 
my 
opinion 
is 
touching 
the 
attainment 
of 
knowledg, 
when 
a 
time 
shall 
offer 
upon 
some 
other 
day: 
but 
I 
would 
not 
have 
Sagred 
s 
offended 
at 
this 
digression. 


SAGR. 


Iam 
ratherverymuch 
pleased 
with 
it, 
forthatIremember 
that 
when 
Istudied 
Logick, 
I 
could 
never 
comprehend 
that 
so 
much 
cry’d 
up 
and 
most 
potent 
demonstrationofAristotle. 


SALV. 


Let 
us 
go 
on 
therefore; 
and 
let 
Simplicius, 
tell 
me 
what 
that 
motion 
is 
which 
the 
stone 
maketh 
that 
is 
held 
fast 
in 
the 
slit 
of 
the 
sling, 
when 
the 
boy 
swings 
it 
abouttothrow 
itagreatway? 


SIMP. 


The 
motion 
of 
the 
stone, 
so 
long 
as 
it 
is 
in 
the 
slit, 
is 
circular, 
that 
is, 
moveth 
by 
the 
arch 
of 
a 
circle, 
whose 
stedfast 
centre 
is 
the 
knitting 
of 
the 
shoulder, 
and 
itssemi-diameterthe 
armandstick. 



SALV. 


And 
when 
the 
stone 
leaveth 
the 
sling, 
what 
is 
its 
motion? 
Doth 
it 
continue 
to 
followits 
formercircle, 
ordothitgoby 
anotherline? 
SIMP. 
It 
will 
continue 
no 
longer 
to 
swing 
round, 
for 
then 
it 
would 
not 
go 
farther 


fromthearmoftheprojicient,whereas 
we 
seeitgoagreatwayoff. 
SALV. 
Withwhatmotiondothitmovethen? 
SIMP. 
Givemealittletimetothink

SALV. 
Hark 
hither, 
Sagredus; 
this 
is 
the 
Quoddam 
reminisci 
in 
a 
subject 
well 


understood. 
Youhave 
pauseda 
great 
while, 
Simplicius. 
SIMP. 
As 
far 
as 
I 
can 
see, 
the 
motion 
received 
in 
going 
out 
of 
the 
sling, 
can 
be 
no 


other 
than 
by 
a 
right 
line; 
nay, 
it 
must 
necessarily 
be 
so, 
if 
we 
speak 
of 
the 
pure 
adventitious 
impetus. 
I 
was 
a 
little 
puzled 
to 
see 
it 
make 
an 
arch, 
but 
because 
that 
arch 
bended 
all 
the 
way 
upwards, 
and 
no 
other 
way, 
I 
conceive 
that 
that 
incurvation 
cometh 
from 
the 
gravity 
of 
the 
stone, 
Th 
motion 
impressed 
by 
the 
projicient 
is 
onely 
by 
a 
right 
line. 
vvhich 
naturally 
dravveth 
it 
dovvnvvards. 
The 
impressed 
impetus, 
I 
say, 
vvithout 
respecting 
the 
natural, 
is 
bya 
rightline. 


SALV. 
But 
by 
what 
right 
line? 
Because 
infinite, 
and 
towards 
every 
side 
may 
be 
producedfromtheslitof 
thesling,and 
fromthe 
pointofthestones 
separation 
fromthesling. 



SIMP. 


It 
moveth 
by 
that 
line 
which 
goeth 
directly 
from 
the 
motion 
which 
the 
stone 
madeinthesling. 


SALV. 


The 
motion 
of 
the 
stone 
whilst 
it 
was 
in 
the 
slit, 
you 
have 
affirmed 
already 
to 
be 
circular; 
now 
circularity 
opposeth 
directness, 
there 
not 
being 
in 
the 
circular 
lineanypartthatis 
director 
streight. 


SIMP. 


I 
mean 
not 
that 
the 
projected 
motion 
is 
direct 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
whole 
circle, 
but 
in 
reference 
to 
that 
ultimate 
point, 
where 
the 
circular 
motion 
determineth. 
IknowwhatIwould 
say,butdonotwellknowhowtoexpressmyself. 


SALV. 


And 
I 
also 
perceive 
that 
you 
understand 
the 
business, 
but 
that 
you 
have 
not 
the 
proper 
terms, 
wherewith 
to 
express 
the 
same. 
Now 
these 
I 
can 
easily 
teach 
you; 
teach 
you, 
that 
is, 
as 
to 
the 
words, 
but 
not 
as 
to 
the 
truths, 
which 
are 
things. 
And 
that 
you 
may 
plainly 
see 
that 
you 
know 
the 
thing 
I 
ask 
you, 
and 
onely 
want 
language 
to 
express 
it, 
tell 
me, 
when 
you 
shoot 
a 
bullet 
out 
of 
a 
gun, 
towards 
whatpartis 
it, 
thatitsacquiredimpetus 
carriethit? 


SIMP. 


Its 
acquired 
impetus 
carrieth 
it 
in 
a 
right 
line, 
which 
continueth 
the 
rectitude 
of 
the 
barrel, 
that 
is, 
which 
inclineth 
neither 
to 
the 
right 
hand 
nor 
to 
the 
left, 
norupwards 
nordownwards. 


SALV. 


Which 
in 
short 
is 
asmuch 
as 
to 
say, 
it 
maketh 
no 
angle 
with 
the 
line 
of 
streightmotionmadebythesling. 


SIMP. 



SoIwould

SALV. 
If 
then 
the 
line 
of 
the 
projects

be 
to 
continue 
without 
making 
an 
angle 


upon 
the 
circular 
line 
described 
by 
it, 
whilst 
it 
was 
with 
the 
projicient; 
and 
if 
from 
this 
circular 
motion 
it 
ought 
to 
pass 
to 
the 
right 
motion, 
what 
ought 
this 
rightlinetobe? 


SIMP. 
It 
must 
needs 
be 
that 
which 
toucheth 
the 
circle 
in 
the 
point 
of 
separation, 
for 


that 
all 
others, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
being 
prolonged 
would 
intersect 
the 
circumference,and 
bythatmeansmakesomeangle 
therewith. 
SALV. 
Youhave 
arguedverywell,and 
shewnyourselfhalf 
aGeometrician. 
Keep 
in 


mind 
therefore, 
that 
your 
true 
opinion 
is 
exprest 
in 
these 
words, 
namely, 
That 
the 
project 
acquireth 
an 
impetus 
of 
moving 
by 
the 
Tangent, 
the 
arch 
described 
by 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
projicient, 
in 
the 
point 
of 
the 
said 
projects 
separation 
fromtheprojicient. 


SIMP. 
Iunderstandyouvery 
well,andthisisthat 
whichIwould 
say. 
SALV. 
Of 
a 
right 
line 
which 
toucheth 
a 
circle, 
which 
of 
its 
points 
is 
the 
nearest 
to 
the 


centreofthatcircle? 
SIMP. 
That 
of 
the 
contact 
without 
doubt: 
for 
that 
is 
in 
the 
circumference 
of 
a 
circle, 


and 
the 
rest 
without: 
and 
the 
points 
of 
the 
circumference 
are 
all 
equidistant 
fromthecentre. 
SALV. 



Therefore 
a 
moveable 
departing 
from 
the 
contact, 
and 
moving 
by 
the 
streight 
Tangent, 
goeth 
continually 
farther 
and 
farther 
from 
the 
contact, 
and 
also 
from 
thecentreof 
the 
circle. 


SIMP. 


It 
dothsodoubtless. 


SALV. 


Now 
if 
you 
have 
kept 
in 
mind 
the 
propositions, 
which 
you 
have 
told 
me, 
lay 
themtogether,and 
tellmewhatyougather 
fromthem. 


SIMP. 


I 
think 
I 
am 
not 
so 
forgetful, 
but 
that 
I 
do 
remember 
them. 
The 
project 
moveth 
by 
the 
Tangent 
of 
the 
circle 
of 
the 
motion 
precedent 
in 
the 
point 
of 
separation. 
From 
the 
things 
premised 
I 
gather 
that 
the 
project 
swiftly 
swinged 
round 
by 
the 
projicient, 
in 
its 
separating 
from 
it, 
doth 
retain 
an 
impetus 
of 
continuing 
its 
motion 
by 
the 
right 
line, 
which 
toucheth 
the 
circle 
described 
by 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
projicient 
in 
the 
point 
of 
separation, 
by 
which 
motion 
the 
project 
goeth 
continually 
receding 
from 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
circle 
described 
by 
themotionoftheprojicient. 


SALV. 


You 
know 
then 
by 
this 
time 
the 
reason 
why 
grave 
bodies 
sticking 
to 
the 
rim 
of 
a 
wheele, 
swiftly 
moved, 
are 
extruded 
and 
thrown 
beyond 
the 
circumference 
toyetafartherdistance 
from 
the 
centre. 


SIMP. 


I 
think 
I 
understand 
this 
very 
well; 
but 
this 
new 
knowledg 
rather 
increaseth 
than 
lesseneth 
my 
incredulity 
that 
the 
Earth 
can 
turn 
round 
with 
so 
great 
velocity,withoutextrudingupintothesky,stones,animals,&c. 


SALV. 



In 
the 
same 
manner 
that 
you 
have 
understood 
all 
this, 
you 
shall, 
nay 
you 
do 
understand 
the 
rest: 
and 
with 
recollecting 
your 
self, 
you 
may 
remember 
the 
same 
without 
the 
help 
of 
others: 
but 
that 
we 
may 
lose 
no 
time, 
I 
will 
help 
your 
memory 
therein. 
You 
do 
already 
know 
of 
your 
self, 
that 
the 
circular 
motion 
of 
the 
projicient 
impresseth 
on 
the 
project 
an 
impetus 
of 
moving 
(when 
they 
come 
to 
separate) 
by 
the 
right 
Tangent, 
the 
circle 
of 
the 
motion 
in 
the 
point 
of 
separation, 
and 
continuing 
along 
by 
the 
same 
the 
motion 
ever 
goeth 
receding 
farther 
and 
farther 
from 
the 
projicient: 
and 
you 
have 
said, 
that 
the 
project 
would 
continue 
to 
move 
along 
by 
that 
right 
line, 
if 
there 
were 
not 
by 
its 
proper 
weight 
an 
inclination 
of 
descent 
added 
unto 
it; 
from 
which 
the 
incurvation 
of 
the 
line 
of 
motion 
is 
derived. 
It 
seems 
moreover 
that 
you 
knew 
of 
your 
self, 
that 
this 
incurvation 
always 
bended 
towards 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
for 
thither 
do 
all 
grave 
bodies 
tend. 
Now 
I 
proceed 
a 
little 
farther, 
and 
ask 
you, 
whether 
the 
moveable 
after 
its 
separation, 
in 
continuing 
the 
right 
motion 
goeth 
always 
equally 
receding 
from 
the 
centre, 
or 
if 
you 
will, 
from 
the 
circumference 
of 
that 
circle, 
of 
which 
the 
precedent 
motion 
was 
a 
part; 
which 
is 
as 
much 
as 
to 
say, 
Whether 
a 
moveable, 
that 
forsaking 
the 
point 
of 
a 
Tangent, 
and 
moving 
along 
by 
the 
said 
Tangent, 
doth 
equally 
recede 
from 
the 
pointofcontact, 
andfrom 
thecircumferenceofthecircle? 


SIMP. 


No, 
Sir: 
for 
the 
Tangent 
near 
to 
the 
point 
of 
contact, 
recedeth 
very 
little 
from 
the 
circumference, 
wherewith 
it 
keepeth 
a 
very 
narrow 
angle, 
but 
in 
its 
going 
farther 
and 
farther 
off, 
the 
distance 
always 
encreaseth 
with 
a 
greater 
proportion; 
so 
that 
in 
a 
circle 
that 
should 
have 
v. 
g. 
ten 
yards 
of 
diameter, 
a 
point 
of 
the 
Tangent 
that 
was 
distant 
from 
the 
contact 
but 
two 
palms, 
would 
be 
three 
or 
four 
times 
as 
far 
distant 
from 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
circle, 
as 
a 
point 
that 
was 
distant 
from 
the 
contaction 
one 
palm, 
and 
the 
point 
that 
was 
distant 
half 
a 
palm, 
I 
likewise 
believe 
would 
fearse 
recede 
the 
fourth 
part 
of 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
second: 
so 
that 
within 
an 
inch 
or 
two 
of 
the 
contact, 
the 
separation 
oftheTangent 
fromthe 
circumferenceisscarsediscernable. 


SALV. 


So 
that 
the 
recession 
of 
the 
project 
from 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
precedent 
circular 
motionisverysmallinthebegining? 



SIMP. 


Almostinsensible. 


SALV. 


Now 
tell 
me 
a 
little; 
the 
project, 
which 
from 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
projicient 
receiveth 
an 
impetus 
of 
moving 
along 
the 
Tangent 
in 
a 
right 
line, 
and 
that 
would 
keep 
unto 
the 
same, 
did 
not 
its 
own 
weight 
depress 
it 
downwards, 
how 
longisit 
after 
theseparation,ereitbegin 
todeclinedownwards. 


SIMP. 


I 
believe 
that 
it 
beginneth 
presently; 
for 
it 
not 
having 
any 
thing 
to 
uphold 
it, 
its 
proper 
gravity 
cannot 
but 
operate. 
A 
grave 
project, 
as 
s 
on 
as 
it 
is 
separatedfromtheprojicientbegineth 
todecline. 


SALV. 


So 
that, 
if 
that 
same 
stone, 
which 
being 
extruded 
from 
that 
wheel 
turn’d 
about 
very 
fast, 
had 
as 
great 
a 
natural 
propension 
of 
moving 
towards 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
said 
wheel, 
as 
it 
hath 
to 
move 
towards 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
it 
would

regard 
that 
upon 
the 
begining 
of 
theseparation, 
therecession 
being 
so 
small, 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
infinite 
acuteness 
of 
the 
angle 
of 
contact, 
every 
very 
little 
of 
inclination 
that 
draweth 
it 
back 
towards 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
wheel, 
would

Iquestionnot, 
butthatif

thatwhichneither

that 
the 
inclination 
of

was

go 
towards 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
wheel,theywouldnever 
come 
tobeextruded 
orshakenoff. 


SALV. 


But 
I 
neither 
do, 
nor 
need 
to 
suppose 
that 
which 
is 
not; 
for 
I 
will 
not 
deny 
but 
that 
the 
stones 
are 
extruded. 
Yet 
I 
speak 
this 
by 
way 
of 
supposition, 
to 
the 
end 
that 
you 
might 
grant 
me 
the 
rest. 
Now 
fancy 
to 
your 
self, 
that 
the 
Earth 
is 



that 
great 
wheel, 
which 
moved 
with 
so 
great 
velocity 
is 
to 
extrude 
the 
stones. 
You 
could 
tell 
me 
very 
well 
even 
now, 
that 
the 
motion 
of 
projection 
ought 
to 
be 
by 
that 
right 
line 
which 
toucheth 
the 
Earth 
in 
the 
point 
of 
separation: 
and 
this 
Tangent, 
how 
doth 
it 
notably 
recede 
from 
the 
superficies 
of 
the 
TerrestrialGlobe? 


SIMP. 


Ibelieve,that 
inathousandyards,

SALV. 


And 
did 
you 
not 
say, 
that 
the 
project 
being 
drawn 
by 
its 
own 
weight, 
declinethfromtheTangenttowards 
the 
centreoftheEarth? 


SIMP. 


I 
said 
so, 
and 
also 
confesse 
the 
rest: 
and 
do 
now 
plainly 
understand 
that 
the 
stone 
will 
not 
separate 
from 
the 
Earth, 
for 
that 
its 
recession 
in 
the 
beginning 
would 
be 
such, 
and 
so 
small, 
that 
it 
is 
a 
thousand 
times 
exceeded 
by 
the 
inclination 
which 
the 
stone 
hath 
to 
move 
towards 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
which 
centre 
in 
this 
case 
is 
also 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
wheel. 
And 
indeed 
it 
must 
be 
confessed 
that 
the 
stones, 
the 
living 
creatures, 
and 
the 
other 
grave 
bodies 
cannot 
beextruded; 
buthere 
againthe

they 
having 
but 
a 
very 
weak 
propension 
of 
descent 
towards 
the 
centre; 
so 
that 
there 
being 
wanting 
in 
them 
that 
faculty 
of 
withdrawing 
from 
the 
superficies, 
I 
see 
not, 
but 
that 
they 
may 
be 
extruded; 
and 
you 
know 
the 
rule, 
that 
ad

SAVL. 


We 
will 
also 
give 
you 
satisfaction 
in 
this. 
Tell 
me 
therefore 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
what 
you 
understand 
by 
light 
matters, 
that 
is, 
whether 
you 
thereby 
mean 
things 
really 
so 
light, 
as 
that 
they 
go 
upvvards, 
or 
else 
not 
absolutely 
light, 
but 
of 
so 
small 
gravity, 
that 
though 
they 
descend 
downwards, 
it 
is 
but 
very 
slowly; 
for 
if 
you 
mean 
the 
absolutely 
light, 
I 
will 
be 
readier 
than 
your 
self 
to 
admittheirextrusion.

SALV. 
This 
pen, 
as 
it 
hath 
a 
natural 
propension 
to 
descend 
towards 
the 
superficies 
of 


the 
Earth, 
though 
it 
be 
very 
small, 
yet 
I 
must 
tell 
you 
that 
it 
sufficeth 
to 
keep 
it 
from 
mounting 
upwards: 
and 
this 
again 
is 
not 
unknown 
to 
you 
your 
self; 
therefore 
tell 
me 
if 
the 
pen 
were 
extruded 
by 
the 
Vertigo 
of 
the 
Earth, 
by 
whatline 
woulditmove? 


SIMP. 
Bythetangentinthepointof

SALV. 
And 
when 
it 
should 
be 
to 
return, 
and 
re-unite 
it 
self 
to 
the 
Earth, 
by 
what 
line 


would

SIMP. 
Bythat

SALV. 
So 
then 
here 
falls 
under 
our 
consideration 
two 
motions; 
one 
the 
motion 
of 


projection, 
which 
beginneth 
from 
the 
point 
of 
contact, 
and 
proceedeth 
along 
the 
tangent; 
and 
the 
other 
the 
motion 
of 
inclination 
downwards, 
which 
beginneth 
from 
the 
project 
it 
self, 
and 
goeth 
by 
the 
secant 
towards 
the 
centre; 
and 
if 
you 
desire 
that 
the 
projection 
follow, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
the 
impetus 
by 
thetangentovercometheinclinationbythesecant: 
isit 
not 
so? 


SIMP. 
Soitseemethtome. 



SALV. 


But 
what 
is 
it 
that 
you 
think 
necessary 
in 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
projicient, 
to 
make 
that 
it 
may 
prevail 
over 
that 
inclination, 
from 
which 
ensueth 
the 
separation 
andelongationofthepenfromtheEarth? 


SIMP. 


Icannottell. 


SALV. 


How, 
do 
you 
not 
know 
that? 
The 
moveable 
is 
here 
the 
same, 
that 
is, 
the 
same 
pen;nowhowcanthesamemoveablesuperateandexceeditself 
inmotion? 


SIMP. 


I 
do 
not 
see 
how 
it 
can 
overcome 
or 
yield 
to 
it 
self 
in 
motion, 
unlesse 
by 
movingonewhile 
faster, 
andanotherwhileslower. 


SALV. 


You 
see 
then, 
that 
you 
do 
know 
it. 
If 
therefore 
the 
projection 
of 
the 
pen 
ought 
to 
follow, 
and 
its 
motion 
by 
the 
tangent 
be 
to 
overcome 
its 
motion 
by 
the 
secant, 
whatisitrequisitethattheirvelocitiesshould 
be? 


SIMP. 


It 
is 
requisite 
that 
the 
motion 
by 
the 
tangent 
be 
greater 
than 
that 
other 
by 
the 
secant. 
But 
wretch 
that 
I 
am! 
Is 
it 
not 
only 
many 
thousand 
times 
greater 
than 
the 
descending 
motion 
of 
the 
pen, 
but 
than 
that 
of 
the 
stone? 
And 
yet 
like 
a 
simplefellowI 
hadsufferedmyselftobeperswaded,that 
stonescouldnotbe 
extruded 
by 
the 
revolution 
of 
the 
Earth. 
I 
do 
therefore 
revoke 
my 
former 
sentence, 
and 
say, 
that 
if 
the 
Earth 
should 
move, 
stones, 
Elephants, 
Towers, 
and 
whole 
Cities 
would 
of 
necessity 
be 
tost 
up 
into 
the 
Air; 
and 
because 
that 
that 
dothnotevene,I 
concludethat 
theEarthdoth 
not 
move. 


SALV. 



Softly 
Simplicius, 
you 
go 
on 
so 
fast, 
that 
I 
begin 
to 
be 
more 
afraid 
for 
you, 
than 
for 
the 
pen. 
Rest 
a 
little, 
and 
observe 
what 
I 
am 
going 
to 
speap. 
If 
for 
the 
reteining 
of 
the 
stone 
or 
pen 
annexed 
to 
the 
Earths 
surface 
it 
were 
necessary 
that 
its 
motion 
of 
descent 
were 
greater, 
or 
as 
much 
as 
the 
motion 
made 
by 
the 
tangent; 
you 
would 
have 
had 
reason 
to 
say, 
that 
it 
ought 
of 
necessity 
to 
move 
as 
fast, 
or 
faster 
by 
thesecantdownwards,than 
by 
thetangent 
Eastwards: 
But 
didnot 
you 
tell 
meeven 
now, 
that 
a 
thousand 
yardsof 
distanceby 
thetangent 
from 
the 
contact, 
do 
remove 
hardly 
an 
inch 
from 
the 
circumference? 
It 
is 
not 
sufficient 
therefore 
that 
the 
motion 
by 
the 
tangent, 
which 
is 
the 
same 
with 
that 
of 
the 
diurnall 
Vertigo, 
(or 
hasty 
revolution) 
be 
simply 
more 
swift 
than 
the 
motion 
by 
the 
secant, 
which 
is 
the 
same 
with 
that 
of 
the 
pen 
in 
descending; 
but 
it 
is 
requisite 
that 
the 
same 
be 
so 
much 
more 
swift 
as 
that 
the 
time 
which 
sufficeth 
for 
the 
pen 
to 
move 
v. 
g. 
a 
thousand 
yards 
by 
the 
tangent, 
be 
insufficient 
for 
it 
to 
move 
one 
sole 
inch 
by 
the 
secant. 
The 
which 
I 
tell 
you 
shall 
never 
be, 
though 
you 
should 
make 
that 
motion 
never 
so 
swift, 
and 
thisneverso 
slow. 


SIMP. 


And 
why 
might 
not 
that 
by 
thetangent 
be 
so 
swift, 
as 
not 
to 
give 
the 
pen 
time 
toreturntothesurfaceof 
the 
Earth? 


SALV. 


Try 
whether 
you 
can 
state 
the 
case 
in 
proper 
termes, 
and 
I 
will 
give 
you 
an 
answer. 
Tell 
me 
therefore, 
how 
much 
do 
you 
think 
sufficeth 
to 
make 
that 
motionswifterthanthis? 


SIMP. 


I 
will 
say 
for 
example, 
that 
if 
that 
motion 
by 
the 
tangent 
were 
a 
million 
of 
times 
swifter 
than 
this 
by 
the 
secant, 
the 
pen, 
yea, 
and 
the 
stone 
also 
would 
cometobeextruded. 


SALV. 


You 
say 
so, 
and 
say 
that 
which 
is 
false, 
onely 
for 
want, 
not 
of 
Logick, 
Physicks, 
or 
Metaphysicks, 
but 
of 
Geometry; 
for 
if 
you 
did 
but 
understand 
its 



first 
elements, 
you 
would 
know, 
that 
from 
the 
centre 
of 
a 
circle 
a 
right 
line 
maybe 
drawnto 
meet 
thetangent,whichintersectethitinsuchamanner, 
that 
the 
part 
of 
the 
tangent 
between 
the 
contact 
and 
the 
secant, 
may 
be 
one, 
two, 
or 
three 
millions 
of 
times 
greater 
than 
that 
part 
of 
the 
secant 
which 
lieth 
between 
the 
tangent 
and 
the 
circumference, 
and 
that 
the 
neerer 
and 
neerer 
the 
secant 
shall 
be 
to 
the 
contact, 
this 
proportion 
shall 
grow 
greater 
and 
greater 
in 
infinitum; 
so 
that 
it 
need 
not 
be 
feared, 
though 
the 
vertigo 
be 
swift, 
and 
the 
motion 
downwards 
slow, 
that 
the 
pen 
or 
other 
lighter 
matter 
can 
begin 
to 
rise 
upwards, 
for 
that 
the

downwards 
always 
exceedeth

SALV. 


I 
will 
give 
you 
a 
most 
universal 
yet 
very 
easie 
demonstration 
thereof. 
A 
geometrical 
demonstration 
to 
prove 
the 
impossibility 
of 
extrusion 
by 
means 
of 
the 
terrestrial 
vertigo. 
Let 
a 
proportion 
be 
given 
between 
BA 
[in 
Fig. 
3. 
] 
and 
C: 
And 
let 
BA 
be 
greater 
than 
C 
at 
pleasure. 
And 
let 
there 
be 
described 
a 
circle, 
whose 
centre 
is 
D. 
From 
which 
it 
is 
required 
to 
draw 
a 
secant, 
in 
such 
manner, 
that 
the 
tangent 
may 
be 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
said 
secant, 
as 
BA 
to 
C. 
Let 
AI 
be 
supposed 
a 
third 
proportional 
to 
BA 
and 
C. 
And 
as 
BI 
is 
to 
IA, 
so 
let 
the 
diameter 
FE 
be 
to 
EG; 
and 
from 
the

G, 
let 
there 
be 
drawn

And 
in

so

therefore 
by 
composition, 
as

so 
shall

And 
because

between

and

is 
a

BA 
is 
to 
C, 
so 
shall 
FG 
be 
to 
GH; 
that 
is 
HG 
to

SAGR. 


I 
apprehend 
this 
demonstration; 
yet 
neverthelesse, 
I 
am 
not 
left 
wholly 
without 
haesitation; 
for 
I 
find 
certain 
confused 
scruples 
role 
to 
and 
again 
in 
my 
mind, 
which 
like 
thick 
and 
dark 
clouds, 
permit 
me 
not 
to 
discern 
the 
cleernesse 
and 
necessity 
of 
the 
conclusion 
with 
that 
perspicuity, 
which 
is 



usual 
in 
Mathematical 
Demonstrations. 
And 
that 
which 
I 
stick 
at 
is 
this. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
spaces 
between 
the 
tangent 
and 
the 
circumference 
do 
gradually 
diminish 
in 
infinitum 
towards 
the 
contact; 
but 
it 
is 
also 
true 
on 
the 
contrary, 
that 
the 
propension 
of 
the 
moveable 
to 
descending 
groweth 
less 
& 
less 
in 
it, 
the 
nearer 
it 
is 
to 
the 
first 
term 
of 
its 
descent; 
that 
is, 
to 
the 
state 
of 
rest; 
as 
is 
manifest 
from 
that 
which 
you 
declare 
unto 
us, 
demonstrating 
that 
the 
descending 
grave 
body 
departing 
from 
rest, 
ought 
to 
passe 
thorow 
all 
the 
degrees 
of 
tardity 
comprehended 
between 
the 
said 
rest, 
& 
any 
assigned 
degree 
of 
velocity, 
the 
which 
grow 
less 
and 
in 
infinitum. 
To 
which 
may 
be 
added, 
that 
the 
said 
velocity 
and 
propension 
to 
motion, 
doth 
for 
another 
reason 
diminish 
to 
infinity; 
and 
it 
is 
because 
the 
gravity 
of 
the 
said 
moveable 
may 
infinitely 
diminish. 
So 
that 
the 
causes 
which 
diminish 
the 
propension 
of 
ascending, 
and 
consequently 
favour 
the 
projection, 
are 
two; 
that 
is, 
the 
levity 
of 
the 
moveable, 
and 
its 
vicinity 
to 
the 
state 
of 
rest; 
both 
which 
are 
augmentable 
in 
infinit. 
and 
these 
two 
on 
the 
contrary 
being 
to 
contract 
but 
with 
one 
sole 
cause 
of 
making 
the 
projection, 
I 
cannot 
conceive 
how 
it 
alone, 
although 
it 
also 
do 
admit 
of 
infinite 
augmentation, 
should 
be 
able 
to 
remain 
invincible 
against 
the 
union 
& 
confederacy 
of 
the 
others, 
wch 
are 
two, 
and 
are 
inlikemannercapableofinfiniteaugmentation. 


SALV. 


This 
is 
a 
doubt 
worthy 
of 
Sagredus; 
and 
to 
explain 
it 
so 
as 
that 
we 
may 
more 
cleerly 
apprehend 
it, 
for 
that 
you 
say 
that 
you 
your 
self 
have 
but 
a 
confused 
Idea 
of 
it, 
we 
will 
distinguish 
of 
the 
same 
by 
reducing 
it 
into 
figure; 
which 
may 
also 
perhaps 
afford 
us 
some 
ease 
in 
resolving 
the 
same. 
Let 
us 
therefore 
[in 
Fig. 
4. 
] 
draw 
a 
perpendicular 
line 
towards 
the 
centre, 
and 
let 
it 
be 
AC, 
and 
to 
it 
at 
right 
angles 
let 
there 
be 
drawn 
the 
Horizontal 
line 
AB, 
upon 
which 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
projection 
ought 
to 
be 
made; 
now 
the 
project 
would 
continue 
to 
move 
along 
the 
same 
with 
an 
even 
motion, 
if 
so 
be 
its 
gravity 
did 
not 
incline 
it 
downwards. 
Let 
us 
suppose 
from 
the 
point 
A 
a 
right 
line 
to 
be 
drawn, 
that 
may 
make 
any 
angle 
at 
pleasure 
with 
the 
line 
AB; 
which 
let 
be 
AE,and 
uponABlet 
us 
mark 
some 
equal 
spaces 
AF, 
FH, 
HK,andfrom 
them 
let 
us 
let 
fall 
the 
perpendiculars 
FG, 
HI, 
KL, 
as 
far 
as 
AE. 
And 
because, 
as 
already 
hath 
been 
said, 
the 
descending 
grave 
body 
departing 
from 
rest, 
goeth 
from 
time 
to 
time 
acquiring 
a 
greater 
degrees 
of 
velocity, 
according 
as 
the 
said 
time 
doth 
successively 
encrease; 
we 
may 
conceive 
the 
spaces 
AF, 
FH, 



HK, 
to 
represent 
unto 
us 
equal 
times; 
and 
the 
perpendiculars 
FG, 
HI, 
KL, 
degrees 
of 
velocity 
acquired 
in 
the 
said 
times; 
so 
that 
the 
degree 
of 
velocity 
acquired 
in 
the 
whole 
time 
AK, 
is 
as 
the 
line 
KL, 
in 
respect 
to 
the 
degree 
HI, 
acquired 
in 
the 
time 
AH, 
and 
the 
degree 
FG 
in 
the 
time 
AF; 
the 
which 
degrees 
KL, 
HI, 
FG, 
are 
(as 
is 
manifest) 
the 
same 
in 
proportion, 
as 
the 
times 
KA, 
HA, 
FA, 
and 
if 
other 
perpendiculars 
were 
drawn 
from 
the 
points 
marked 
at 
pleasure 
in 
the 
line 
FA, 
one 
might 
successively 
find 
degrees 
lesse 
and 
lesse 
in 
infinitum, 
proceeding 
towards 
the 
point 
A, 
representing 
the 
first 
instant 
of 
time, 
and 
the 
first 
state 
of 
rest. 
And 
this 
retreat 
towards 
A, 
representeth 
the 
first 
propension 
to 
the 
motion 
of 
descent, 
diminished 
in 
infinitum 
by 
the 
approach 
of 
the 
moveable 
to 
the 
first 
state 
of 
rest, 
which 
approximation 
is 
augmentable 
in 
infinitum. 
Now 
let 
us 
find 
the 
other 
diminution 
of 
velocity, 
which 
likewise 
may 
proceed 
to 
infinity, 
by 
the 
diminution 
of 
the 
gravity 
of 
the 
moveable, 
and 
this 
shall 
be 
represented 
by 
drawing 
other 
lines 
from 
the 
point 
A, 
which 
contein 
angles 
lesse 
than 
the 
angle 
BAE, 
which 
would 
be 
this 
line 
AD, 
the 
which 
intersecting 
the 
parallels 
KL, 
HI, 
FG, 
in 
the 
points 
M, 
N, 
and 
O, 
represent 
unto 
us 
the 
degrees 
FO, 
HN, 
KM, 
acquired 
in 
the 
times 
AF, 
AH, 
AK, 
lesse 
than 
the 
other 
degrees 
FG, 
HI, 
KL, 
acquired 
in 
the 
same 
times; 
but 
these 
latter 
by 
a 
moveable 
more 
ponderous, 
and 
those 
other 
by 
a 
moveable 
more 
light. 
And 
it 
is 
manifest, 
that 
by 
the 
retreat 
of 
the 
line 
EA 
towards 
AB, 
contracting 
the 
angle 
EAB 
(the 
which 
may 
be 
done 
in 
infinitum, 
like 
as 
the 
gravity 
may 
in 
infinitum 
be 
diminished) 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
cadent 
moveable 
may 
in 
like 
manner 
be 
diminished 
in 
infinitum, 
and 
so 
consequently 
the 
cause 
that 
impeded 
the 
projection; 
and 
therefore 
my 
thinks 
that 
the 
union 
of 
these 
two 
reasons 
against 
the 
projection, 
diminished 
to 
infinity, 
cannot 
be 
any 
impediment 
to 
the 
said 
projection. 
And 
couching 
the 
whole 
argument 
in 
its 
shortest 
terms, 
we 
will 
say, 
that 
by 
contracting 
the 
angle 
EAB, 
the 
degrees 
of 
velocity 
LK, 
IH, 
GF, 
are 
diminished; 
and 
moreover 
by 
the 
retreat 
of 
the 
parallels 
KL, 
HI, 
FG, 
towards 
the 
angle 
A, 
the 
same 
degrees 
are 
again 
diminished; 
and 
both 
these 
diminutions 
extend 
to 
infinity: 
Therefore 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
descent 
may 
very 
well 
diminish 
so 
much, 
(it 
admitting 
of 
a 
twofold 
diminution 
in 
infinitum) 
as 
that 
it 
may 
not 
suffice 
to 
restore 
the 
moveable 
to 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
wheel, 
and 
thereupon 
may 
occasion 
the 
projection 
to 
be 
hindered 
and 
wholly 
obviated. 



Again 
on 
the 
contrary, 
to 
impede 
the 
projection, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
the 
spaces 
by 
which 
the 
project 
is 
to 
descend 
for 
the 
reuniting 
it 
self 
to 
the 
Wheel, 
be 
made 
so 
short 
and 
close 
together, 
that 
though 
the 
descent 
of 
the 
moveable 
be 
retarded, 
yea 
more, 
diminished 
in 
infinitum, 
yet 
it 
sufficeth 
to 
reconduct 
it 
thither: 
and 
therefore 
it 
would 
be 
requisite, 
that 
you 
find 
out 
a 
diminution 
of 
the 
said 
spaces, 
not 
only 
produced 
to 
infinity, 
but 
to 
such 
an 
infinity, 
as 
that 
it 
may 
superate 
the 
double 
infinity 
that 
is 
made 
in 
the 
diminution 
of 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
descending 
moveable. 
But 
how 
can 
a 
magnitude 
be 
diminished 
more 
than 
another, 
which 
hath 
a 
twofold 
diminution 
in 
infinitum? 
Now 
let 
Simplicius 
observe 
how 
hard 
it 
is 
to 
philosophate 
well 
in 
nature, 
without 
Geometry. 
The 
degrees 
of 
velocity 
diminished 
in 
infinitum, 
as 
well 
by 
the 
diminution 
of 
the 
gravity 
of 
the 
moveable, 
as 
by 
the 
approxination 
to 
the 
first 
term 
of 
the 
motion, 
that 
is, 
to 
the 
state 
of 
rest, 
are 
alwayes 
determinate, 
and 
answer 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
parallels 
comprehended 
between 
two 
right 
lines 
that 
concur 
in 
an 
angle, 
like 
to 
the 
angle 
BAE, 
or 
BAD, 
or 
any 
other 
infinitely 
more 
acute, 
alwayes 
provided 
it 
be 
rectilineall. 
But 
the 
diminution 
of 
the 
spaces 
thorow 
which 
the 
moveable 
is 
to 
be 
conducted 
along 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
wheel, 
is 
proportionate 
to 
another 
kind 
of 
diminution, 
comprehended 
between 
lines 
that 
contain 
an 
angle 
infinitely 
more 
narrow 
and 
acute, 
than 
any 
rectilineal 
angle, 
how 
acute 
soever, 
which 
is 
that 
in 
our 
present 
case. 
Let 
any 
point 
be 
taken 
in 
the 
perpendicular 
AC, 
and 
making 
it 
the 
centre, 
describe 
at 
the 
distance 
CA, 
an 
arch 
AMP, 
the 
which 
shall 
intersect 
the 
parallels 
that 
determine 
the 
degrees 
of 
velocity, 
though 
they 
be 
very 
minute, 
and 
comprehended 
within 
a 
most 
acute 
rectilineal 
angle; 
of 
which 
parallels 
the 
parts 
that 
lie 
between 
the 
arch 
and 
the 
tangent 
AB, 
are 
the 
quantities 
of 
the 
spaces, 
and 
of 
the 
returns 
upon 
the 
wheel, 
alwayes 
lesser 
(and 
with 
greater 
proportion 
lesser, 
by 
how 
much 
neerer 
they 
approach 
to 
the 
contact) 
than 
the 
said 
parallels 
of 
which 
they 
are 
parts. 
The 
parallels 
comprehended 
between 
the 
right 
lines 
in 
retiring 
towards 
the 
angle 
diminish 
alwayes 
at 
the 
same 
rate, 
as 
v. 
g. 
AH 
being 
divided 
in 
two 
equal 
parts 
in 
F, 
the 
parallel 
HI 
shall 
be 
double 
to 
FG, 
and 
sub-dividing 
FA, 
in 
two 
equal 
parts, 
the 
parallel 
produced 
from 
the 
point 
of 
the 
division 
shall 
be 
the 
half 
of 
FG; 
and 
continuing 
the 
subdivision 
in 
infinitum, 
the 
subsequent 
parallels 
shall 
be 
alwayes 
half 
of 
the 
next 
preceding; 
but 
it 
doth 
not 
so 
fall 
out 
in 
the 
lines 
intercepted 
between 
the 
tangent 
and 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
circle: 
For 
if 
the 
same 
sub-division 
be 
made 
in 
FA; 
and 
supposing 
for 
example, 
that 
the 
parallel 
which 
cometh 
from 



the 
point 
H, 
were 
double 
unto 
that 
which 
commeth 
from 
F, 
this 
shall 
be 
more 
then 
double 
to 
the 
next 
following, 
and 
c 
inually 
the 
neerer 
we 
come 
towards 
the 
contact 
A, 
we 
shall 
fi 
the 
precedent 
lines 
contein 
the 
next 
following 
three, 
four, 
ten, 
an 
hundred, 
a 
thousand, 
an 
hundred 
thousand, 
an 
hundred 
millions 
of 
times, 
and 
more 
in 
infinitum. 
The 
brevity 
therefore 
of 
such 
lines 
is 
so 
reduced, 
that 
it 
far 
exceeds 
what 
is 
requisite 
to 
make 
the 
project, 
though 
never 
so 
light, 
return, 
nay 
more, 
continue 
unremoveable 
upon 
the 
circumference.

I 
very 
well 
comprehend 
the 
whole 
discourse, 
and 
upon 
what 
it 
layeth 
all 
its 
stresse, 
yet 
neverthelesse 
methinks 
that 
he 
that 
would 
take

to 
pursue

might 
yet 
start 
some 
further 
questions,

saying, 
that 
of 
those 
two 
causes 
which 
render

itis

that 
that 
which 
dependeth 
on

to

increaseth 
alwayes 
in 
the

like 
as 
the 
parallels 
alwayes 
retain 
the

proportion 
to

&c. 
but 
that 
the 
diminution

on

diminution 
of 
the 
gravity 
of

SALV. 


I 
have 
assumed 
for 
a 
truth, 
that 
the 
velocities 
of 
moveables 
descending 
naturally, 
vvill 
follovv 
the 
proportion 
of 
their 
gravities, 
with 
the 
favour 
of 
Simplicius, 
and 
of 
Aristotle, 
who 
doth 
in 
many 
places 
affirm 
the 
same, 
as 
a 
proposition 
manifest: 
You, 
in 
favour 
of 
my 
adversary, 
bring 
the 
same 
into 
question, 
and 
say 
that 
its 
possible 
that 
the 
velocity 
increaseth 
with 
greater 
proportion, 
yea 
and 
greater 
in 
infinitum 
than 
that 
of 
the 
gravity; 
so 
that 
all 
that 
hath 
been 
said 
falleth 
to 
the 
ground: 
For 
maintaining 
whereof, 
I 
say, 
that 
the 
proportion 
of 
the 
velocities 
is 
much 
lesse 
than 
that 
of 
the 
gravities; 
and 
thereby 
I 
do 
not 
onely 
support 
but 
confirme 
the 
premises. 
And 
for 
proof 
of 
this 
I 
appeal 
unto 
experience, 
which 
will 
shew 
us, 
that 
a 
grave 
body, 
howbeit 
thirty 
or 
fourty 
times 
bigger 
then 
another; 
as 
for 
example, 
a 
ball 
of 
lead, 
and 
another 
of 
sugar, 
will 
not 
move 
much 
more 
than 
twice 
as 
fast. 
Now 
if 
the 



projection 
would 
not 
be 
made, 
albeit 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
cadent 
body 
should 
diminish 
according 
to 
the 
proportion 
of 
the 
gravity, 
much 
lesse 
would 
it 
be 
made 
so 
long 
as 
the 
velocity 
is 
but 
little 
diminished, 
by 
abating 
much 
from 
the 
gravity. 
But 
yet 
supposing 
that 
the 
velocity 
diminisheth 
with 
a 
proportion 
much 
greater 
than 
that 
wherewith 
the 
gravity 
decreaseth, 
nay 
though 
it 
were 
the 
self-same 
wherewith 
those 
parallels 
conteined 
between 
the 
tangent 
and 
circumference 
do 
decrease, 
yet 
cannot 
I 
see 
any 
necessity 
why 
I 
should 
grant 
the 
projection 
of 
matters 
of 
never 
so 
great 
levity; 
yea 
I 
farther 
averre, 
that 
there 
could 
no 
such 
projection 
follow, 
meaning 
alwayes 
of 
matters 
not 
properly 
and 
absolutely 
light, 
that 
is, 
void 
of 
all 
gravity, 
and 
that 
of 
their 
own 
natures 
move 
upwards, 
but 
that 
descend 
very 
slowly, 
and 
have 
very 
small 
gravity. 
And 
that 
which 
moveth 
me 
so 
to 
think 
is, 
that 
the 
diminution 
of 
gravity, 
made 
according 
to 
the 
proportion 
of 
the 
parallels 
between 
the 
tangent 
and 
the 
circumference, 
hath 
for 
its 
ultimate 
and 
highest 
term 
the 
nullity 
of 
weight, 
as 
those 
parallels 
have 
for 
their 
last 
term 
of 
their 
diminution 
the 
contact 
it 
self, 
which 
is 
an 
indivisible 
point: 
Now 
gravity 
never 
diminisheth 
so 
far 
as 
to 
its 
last 
term, 
for 
then 
the 
moveable 
would 
cease 
to 
be 
grave; 
but 
yet 
the 
space 
of 
the 
reversion 
of 
the 
project 
to 
the 
circumference 
is 
reduced 
to 
the 
ultimate 
minuity, 
which 
is 
when 
the 
moveable 
resteth 
upon 
the 
circumference 
in 
the 
very 
point 
of 
contact; 
so 
as 
that 
to 
return 
thither 
it 
hath 
no 
need 
of 
space: 
and 
therefore 
let 
the 
propension 
to 
the 
motion 
of 
descent 
be 
never 
so 
small, 
yet 
is 
it 
alwayes 
more 
than 
sufficient 
to 
reconduct 
the 
moveable 
to 
the 
circumference, 
from 
which 
it 
is 
distant 
but 
its 
least 
space, 
that 
is,nothingatall. 


SAGR. 


Your 
discourse, 
I 
must 
confess, 
is 
very 
accurate; 
and 
yet 
no 
less 
concluding 
than 
it 
is 
ingenuous; 
and 
it 
must 
be 
granted 
that 
to 
go 
about 
to 
handle 
natural 
questions, 
without 
Geometry, 
isto 
attemptan 
impossibility. 


SALV. 


But 
Simplicius 
will 
not 
say 
so; 
and 
yet 
I 
do 
not 
think 
that 
he 
is 
one 
of 
those 
Peripateticks 
that 
disswade 
their 
Disciples 
from 
studying 
the 
Mathematicks,

SIMP. 



Iwould 
notdo 
somuchwrong 
toPlato,butyetImaytrulysaywith 
Aristotle, 
that 
he 
too 
much 
lost 
himself 
in, 
and 
too 
much 
doted 
upon 
that 
his 
Geometry: 
for 
that 
in 
conclusion 
these 
Mathematical 
subtilties 
Salviatus 
are 
true 
in 
abstract, 
but 
applied 
to 
sensible 
and 
Physical 
matter, 
they 
hold 
not 
good. 
For 
the 
Mathematicians 
will 
very 
well 
demonstrate 
for 
example, 
that 
Sphaera 
tangit 
planum 
in 
puncto; 
a 
position 
like 
to 
that 
in 
dispute, 
but 
when 
one 
cometh 
to 
the 
matter, 
things 
succeed 
quite 
another 
way. 
And 
so 
I 
may 
say 
of 
these 
angles 
of 
contact, 
and 
these 
proportions; 
which 
all 
evaporate 
into 
Air, 
whentheyareappliedto 
thingsmaterialandsensible. 


SALV. 


You 
do 
not 
think 
then, 
that 
the 
tangent 
toucheth 
the 
superficies 
of 
the 
terrestrialGlobeinone 
point 
only? 


SIMP. 


No, 
not 
in 
one 
sole 
point; 
but 
I 
believe 
that 
a 
right 
line 
goeth 
many 
tens 
and 
hundreds 
of 
yards 
touching 
the 
surface 
not 
onely 
of 
the 
Earth, 
but 
of 
the 
water,beforeitseparatefrom 
thesame. 


SALV. 


But 
if 
I 
grant 
you 
this, 
do 
not 
you 
perceive 
that 
it 
maketh 
so 
much 
the 
more 
against 
your 
cause? 
For 
if 
it 
be 
supposed 
that 
the 
tangent 
was 
separated 
from 
the 
terrestrial 
superficies, 
yet 
it 
hath 
been 
however 
demonstrated 
that 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
great 
acuity 
of 
the 
angle 
of 
contingence 
(if 
happily 
it 
may 
be 
call’d 
an 
angle) 
the 
project 
would 
not 
separate 
from 
the 
same; 
how 
much 
lesse 
cause 
of 
separation 
would 
it 
have, 
if 
that 
angle 
should 
be 
wholly 
closed, 
The 
truth 
sometimes 
gaines 
strength 
by 
contradiction. 
and 
the 
superficies 
and 
thetangentbecomeallone?Perceiveyounotthat 
theProjectionwoulddothe 
same 
thing 
upon 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
Earth, 
which 
is 
asmuch 
as 
to 
say, 
it 
would 
do 
just 
nothing 
at 
all? 
You 
see 
then 
the 
power 
of 
truth, 
which 
while 
you 
strive 
to 
oppose 
it, 
your 
own 
assaults 
themselves 
uphold 
and 
defend 
it. 
But 
in 
regard 
that 
you 
have 
retracted 
this 
errour, 
I 
would 
be 
loth 
to 
leave 
you 
in 
that 
other 
which 
you 
hold, 
namely, 
that 
a 
material 
Sphere 
doth 
not 
touch 
a 
plain 
in 
one 
sole 
point: 
and 
I 
could 
wish 
some 
few 
hours 
conversation 
with 
some 
persons 
conversant 
in 
Geometry, 
might 
make 
you 
a 
little 
more 
intelligent 



amongst 
those 
who 
know 
nothing 
thereof. 
Now 
to 
shew 
you 
how 
great 
their 
errour 
is 
who 
say, 
that 
a 
Sphere 
v. 
g. 
of 
brasse, 
doth 
not 
touch 
a 
plain 
v. 
g. 
of 
steel 
in 
one 
sole

Tell 
me 
what 
conceipt 
you 
would 
entertain 
of

that

constantlyaver,thattheSphere

SIMP. 
Iwould 
esteem 
himwholly 
devoidofreason. 
SALV. 
He 
is 
in 
the 
same 
case 
who 
saith 
that 
the 
material 
Sphere 
doth 
not 
touch 
a 


plain, 
The 
sphere 
although 
material, 
toucheth 
the 
material 
plane 
but 
in 
one 
point 
onely. 
also 
material, 
in 
one 
onely 
point; 
for 
to 
say 
this 
is 
the 
same, 
as 
to 
affirm 
that 
the 
Sphere 
is 
not 
a 
Sphere. 
And 
that 
this 
is 
true, 
tell 
me 
in 
what 
it 
is 
that 
you 
constitute 
the 
Sphere 
to 
consist, 
that 
is, 
what 
it 
is 
that 
maketh 
the 
Spheredifferfromallothersolidbodies. 


SIMP. 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
essence 
of 
a 
Sphere 
consisteth 
in 
having 
all 
the 
right 
lines 


produced 
from 
its 
centre 
to 
the 
circumference, 
The 
definition 
of 
the

equal. 
SALV. 
So 
that, 
if 
those 
lines 
should 
not 
be 
equal, 
that 
same 
solidity 
would 
be 
no 


longerasphere? 
SIMP. 
True. 
SALV. 
Go 
to; 
tell 
me 
whether 
you 
believe 
that 
amongst 
the 
many

SALV. 


But 
yet 
you 
understand 
that 
this 
onely 
right

shall 
again 
of 
necessity 
be

SIMP. 


I 
know 
it, 
and 
also 
have 
a 
demonstration 
thereof, 
produced 
by 
a 
great 
Peripatetick 
Philosopher, 
and 
as 
I 
take 
it, 
if 
my 
memory 
do 
not 
deceive 
me, 
he 
alledgeth 
it 
by 
way 
of 
reprehending 
Archimedes, 
that 
supposeth 
it

when 
itmay

Thismust 
needsbe 
agreatMathematician,that

howtodemonstratethat 
which 
Archimedes 
neither 
did, 
nor 
could 
demonstrate. 
And 
if 
you 
remember 
his 
demonstration, 
I 
would 
gladly 
hear 
it: 
for 
I 
remember 
very 
well, 
that 
Archimedes 
in 
his

The

SIMP. 


I 
will 
describe 
the 
Figure 
of 
it. 
Between 
the 
points 
A 
and 
B, 
The 
demonstration 
of 
a 
Peripatetick▪ 
to 
prove 
the 
right

to 
be 
t 
e 
shortest 
of 
all 
lines. 
[in 
Fig. 
5.

draw 
the 
right 
line 
AB, 
and 
the 
curve 
line 
ACB, 
of 
which 
we 
will 
prove 
the 
right 
to 
be 
the 
shorter: 
and 
the 
proof 
is 
this; 
take 
a 
point 
in 
the 
curve-line, 
which 
let 
be 
C, 
and 
draw 
two 
other 
lines, 
AC 
and 
CB, 
which 
two 
lines 
together, 
are 
longer 
than 
the 
sole 
line 
AB, 
for 
so 
demonstrateth 



Euclid. 
But 
the 
curve-line 
ACB, 
is 
greater 
than 
the 
two 
right-lines 
AC, 
and 
CB; 
therefore, 
à

the 
curve-line 
ACB, 
is 
much 
greater 
than 
the

SALV. 


I 
do 
not 
think 
that 
if 
one 
should 
ransack 
all 
the 
Paralogisms 
of 
the 
world, 
The 
Paralogism 
of 
the

Peripatetick▪ 
which

per

there 
could 
be 
found 
one 
more 
commodious 
than 
this, 
to 
give 
an 
example 
of 
the 
most 
solemn 
fallacy 
of 
all 
fallacies, 
namely, 
than 
that 
which

SIMP. 


Howso? 


SALV. 


Do 
you 
ask 
me 
how 
so? 
The 
unknown 
conclusion 
which 
you 
desire 
to 
prove, 
is 
it 
not, 
that 
the 
curved 
line 
ACB, 
is 
longer 
than 
the 
right 
line 
AB; 
the 
middle 
term 
which 
is 
taken 
for 
known, 
is 
that 
the 
curve-line 
ACB, 
is 
greater 
than 
the 
two 
lines 
AC 
and 
CB, 
the 
which 
are 
known 
to 
be 
greater 
than 
AB; 
And 
if 
it 
be 
unknown 
whether 
the 
curve-line 
be 
greater 
than 
the 
single 
right-
line 
AB, 
shall 
it 
not 
be 
much 
more 
unknown 
whether 
it 
be 
greater 
than 
the 
two

which

SIMP. 


Idonotyetverywell 
perceivewherein 
lyeth 
the 
fallacy. 


SALV. 


As 
the 
two 
right 
lines 
are 
greater 
than 
AB, 
(as 
may 
be 
known 
by 
Euclid) 
and 
in 
as 
much 
as 
the 
curve 
line 
is 
longer 
than 
the 
two 
right 
lines 
AC 
and 
BC,

SIMP. 



It 
shallso. 


SALV. 


That 
the 
curve-line 
ACB, 
is 
greater 
than 
the 
right 
line 
AB, 
is 
the 
conclusion 
more 
known 
than 
the 
middle 
term, 
which 
is, 
that 
the 
same 
curve-line 
is 
greater 
than 
the 
two 
right-lines 
AC 
and 
CB. 
Now 
when 
the 
middle 
term 
is 
less 
known 
than 
the 
conclusion, 
it 
is 
called 
a 
proving 
ignotum 
per 
ignotius. 
But 
to 
return 
to 
our 
purpose, 
it 
is 
sufficient 
that 
you 
know 
the 
right 
line 
to 
be 
the 
shortest 
of 
all 
the 
lines 
that 
can 
be 
drawn 
between 
two 
points. 
And 
as 
to 
the 
principal 
conclusion, 
you 
say, 
that 
the 
material 
sphere 
doth 
not 
touch 
the

Whatthen

SIMP.

And 
the

likewise 
of 
another 
sphere 
equal 
to 
the 
first, 
shall 
be 
also 
a

Then 
the 
tvvo

vvhich

shall 
touch 
vvith 
the 
tvvo 
same 
particles 
of 
a 
superficies, 
for 
each 
of 
them 
agreeing 
to 
one 
and 
the 
same 
plane, 
they 
must 
of 
necessity 
agree 
in 
like 
manner 
to 
each 
other. 
A 
demonstration 
that 
the 
sphere 
toucheth 
the 
plane 
but 
in 
one 
point. 
Imagine 
now 
that 
the 
two 
spheres 
[in 
Fig. 
6. 
] 
whose 
centres 
are 
A 
and 
B, 
do 
touch 
one 
another: 
and 
let 
their 
centres 
be 
conjoyned 
by 
the 
right 
line 
AB, 
which 
passeth 
through 
the 
contact. 
It 
passeth 
thorow 
the 
point 
C, 
and 
another 
point 
in 
the 
contact 
being 
taken 
as 
D, 
conjoyn 
the 
two 
right 
lines 
AD 
and 
BD, 
so 
as 
that 
they 
make 
the 
triangle 
ADB; 
of 
which 
the 
two 
sides 
AD 
and 
DB 
shall 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
other 
one 
ACB, 
both 
those 
and 
this 
containing 
two 



semidiameters, 
which 
by 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
sphere 
are 
all 
equal: 
and 
thus 
the 
right 
line 
AB, 
drawn 
between 
the 
two 
centres 
A 
and 
B, 
shall 
not 
be 
the 
shortest 
of 
all, 
the 
two 
lines 
AD 
and 
DB 
being 
equal 
to 
it: 
which 
by 
your 
own 
concession 
isabsurd. 


SIMP. 


Thisdemonstrationholdethintheabstracted, 
but

SALV. 


Instance 
then 
wherein 
the 
fallacy 
of 
my 
argument 
consisteth, 
if 
as 
you 
say 
it 
is 
not 
concluding 
in 
the 
material 
spheres, 
but 
holdeth 
good 
in 
the 
immaterial 
and 
abstracted. 


SIMP. 


The 
material 
spheres 
are 
subject 
to 
many 
accidents, 
Why 
the 
sphere 
in 
abstract, 
toucheth 
the 
plane 
onely 
in 
one 
point, 
and 
not 
the 
material 
in 
concrete. 
which 
the 
immaterial 
are 
free 
from. 
And 
because 
it 
cannot 
be, 
that 
a 
sphere 
of 
metal 
passing 
along 
a 
plane, 
its 
own 
weight 
should 
not 
so 
depress 
it,asthatthe 
plain 
shouldyieldsomewhat,orthatthesphere 
itselfshouldnot 
in 
the 
contact 
admit 
of 
some 
impression. 
Moreover, 
it 
is 
very 
hard 
for 
that 
planeto 
be 
perfect,iffor 
nothing 
else,yetatleast 
forthatits 
matterisporous: 
and 
perhaps 
it 
will 
be 
no 
less 
difficult 
to 
find 
a 
sphere 
so 
perfect, 
as 
that 
it 
hathallthelines 
from

SALV. 


I 
very 
readily 
grant 
you 
all 
this 
that 
you 
have 
said; 
but 
it 
is 
very 
much 
beside 
our 
purpose: 
for 
whilst 
you 
go 
about 
to 
shew 
me 
that 
a 
material 
sphere 
toucheth 
not 
a 
material 
plane 
in 
one 
point 
alone, 
you 
make 
use 
of 
a 
sphere 
that 
is 
not 
a 
sphere, 
and 
of 
a 
plane 
that 
is 
not 
a 
plane; 
for 
that, 
according 
to 
what 
you 
say, 
either 
these 
things 
cannot 
be 
found 
in 
the 
world, 
or 
if 
they 
may 
be 
found, 
they 
are 
spoiled 
in 
applying 
them 
to 
work 
the 
effect. 
It 
had 
been 
therefore 
a 
less 
evil, 
for 
you 
to 
have 
granted 
the 
conclusion, 
but 
conditionally, 
to 
wit, 
that 
if 
there 
could 
be 
made 
of 
matter 
a 
sphere 
and 
a

that 
were

they

SIMP. 


I 
believe 
that 
the 
proposition 
of 
Philosophers 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
in 
this 
sense; 
for 
it 
is 
not 
to 
be 
doubted, 
but 
that 
the 
imperfection 
of 
the 
matter, 
makeththematterstaken

What, 
do 
they

Why,

you

Howcanthatbe? 


SALV. 


Do 
you 
not 
say, 
that 
through 
the 
imperfection 
of 
the 
matter, 
that 
body 
which 
ought 
to 
be 
perfectly 
spherical, 
and 
that 
plane 
which 
ought 
to 
be 
perfectly 
level, 
do 
not 
prove 
to 
be 
the 
same 
in 
concrete, 
as 
they 
are 
imagined 
to 
be 
in 
abstract? 


SIMP. 


ThisIdoaffirm. 


SALV. 


Then 
when 
ever 
in 
concrete 
you 
do 
apply 
a 
material 
Sphere 
to 
a 
material 
plane, 
Things 
are 
exactly 
the 
same 
in 
abstract 
as 
in 
concrete. 
you 
apply 
an 
imperfect 
Sphere 
to 
an 
imperfect 
plane, 
& 
these 
you 
say 
do 
not 
touch 
only 
in 
one 
point. 
But 
I 
must 
tell 
you, 
that 
even 
in 
abstract 
an 
immaterial 
Sphere, 
that 
is, 
not 
a 
perfect 
Sphere, 
may 
touch 
an 
immaterial 
plane, 
that 
is, 
not 
a 
perfect 
plane, 
not 
in 
one 
point, 
but 
with 
part 
of 
its 
superficies, 
so 
that 
hitherto 
that 
which 
falleth 
out 
in 
concrete, 
doth 
in 
like 
manner 
hold 
true 
in 
abstract. 
And 
it 
would 
be 
a 
new 
thing 
that 
the 
computations 
and 
rates 
made 
in 
abstract 



numbers, 
should 
not 
afterwards 
answer 
to 
the 
Coines 
of 
Gold 
and 
Silver, 
and 
to 
the 
merchandizes 
in 
concrete. 
But 
do 
you 
know 
Simplicius, 
how 
this 
commeth 
to 
passe? 
Like 
as 
to 
make 
that 
the 
computations 
agree 
with 
the 
Sugars, 
the 
Silks, 
the 
Wools, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
the 
accomptant 
reckon 
his 
tares 
of 
chests, 
bags, 
and 
such 
other 
things▪ 
So 
when 
the 
Geometricall 
Philosopher 
would 
observe 
in 
concrete 
the 
effects 
demonstrated 
in 
abstract, 
he 
must 
defalke 
the 
impediments 
of 
the 
matter, 
and 
if 
he 
know 
how 
to 
do 
that, 
I 
do 
assure 
you, 
the 
things 
shall 
jump 
no 
lesse 
exactly, 
than 
Arithmetical 
computations. 
The 
errours 
therefore 
lyeth 
neither 
in 
abstract, 
nor 
in 
concrete, 
norinGeometry,norin 
Physicks,butinthe 
Calculator, 
thatknoweth 
not 
how 
to 
adjust 
his 
accompts. 
Therefore 
if 
you 
had 
a 
perfect 
Sphere 
and 
plane, 
though 
they 
were 
material, 
you 
need 
not 
doubt 
but 
that 
they 
would 
touch 
onely 
in 
one 
point. 
And 
if 
such 
a 
Sphere 
was 
and 
is 
impossible 
to 
be 
procured, 
it 
was 
much 
besides 
the 
purpose 
to 
say, 
Quod 
Sphaera 
aenea 
non 
tangit 
in 
puncto. 
Furthermore, 
if 
I 
grant 
you 
Simplicius, 
that 
in 
matter 
a 
figure 
cannot 
be 
procured 
that 
is 
perfectly 
spherical, 
or 
perfectly 
level: 
Do 
you 
think 
there 
may 
be 
had 
two 
materiall 
bodies, 
whose

OftheseIbelievethatthereisnowant. 


SALV. 


If 
such 
there 
be, 
Contact 
in 
a 
single 
point 
is 
not 
peculiar 
to 
the 
perfect 
Spheres 
onely, 
but 
belongeth 
to 
all 
curved 
figures. 
then 
they 
also 
will 
touch 
in 
one 
sole 
point; 
for 
this 
contact 
in 
but 
one 
point 
alone 
is 
not 
the 
sole 
and 
peculiar 
priviledge 
of 
the 
perfect 
Sphere 
and 
perfect 
plane. 
Nay, 
he 
that 
should 
prosecute 
this 
point 
with 
more 
subtil 
contemplations 
would 
finde 
that 
it 
is 
much 
harder 
to 
procure 
two

that 
touch 
with

It 
is 
more

with 
one 
point 
onely. 
For 
if 
two 
superficies 
be 
required 
to 
combine 
well 
together, 
it 
is 
necessary 
either, 
that 
they 
be 
both 
exactly 
plane, 
or 
that 
if 
one 
be 
convex, 
the 
other 
be 
concave; 
but 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
concave, 
that 
the 
concavity 
do 
exactly 
answer 
to 
the 
convexity 
of 
the 
other: 
the 
which 
conditions 
are 
much 
harder 
to 
be 
found, 
in 



regard 
of 
their 
too 
narrow 
determination, 
than 
those 
others, 
which 
in 
their 
casualllatitudeareinfinite.

You

SALV. 


In 
casual 
encounters, 
I 
do 
not 
think 
they 
do; 
as 
well 
because 
for 
the 
most 
part 
there 
will 
be 
some 
small 
yielding 
filth 
upon 
them, 
as 
because 
that 
no 
diligence 
is 
used 
in 
applying 
them 
without 
striking 
one 
another; 
and 
every 
small 
matter 
sufficeth 
to 
make 
the 
one 
superficies 
yield 
somewhat 
to 
the 
other; 
so 
that 
they 
interchangeably, 
at 
least 
in 
some 
small 
particle, 
receive 
figure 
from 
the 
impression 
of 
each 
other. 
But 
in 
case 
their 
superficies 
were 
very 
terse 
and 
polite, 
and 
that 
they 
were 
both 
laid 
upon 
a 
table, 
that 
so 
one 
might 
not 
presse 
upon 
the 
other, 
and 
gently 
put 
towards 
one 
another, 
I 
question 
not, 
but 
that 
they 
might 
be 
brought 
to 
the 
simple 
contact 
in

onelypoint. 


SAGR. 


It 
is 
requisite, 
with 
your 
permission, 
that 
I 
propound 
a 
certain 
scruple 
of 
mine, 
which 
cameintomy 
minde, 
whil’st 
Iheard 
proposed 
bySimplicius, 
the 
impossibility 
of 
finding 
a 
materiall 
and 
solid 
body, 
that 
is, 
perfectly 
of 
a 
Spherical 
figure, 
and 
whil’st 
I 
saw 
Salviatus 
in 
a 
certain 
manner, 
not 
gainsaying, 
to 
give 
his 
consent 
thereto; 
therefore 
I 
would 
know, 
whether 
there 
would 
be 
the 
same 
difficulty 
in 
forming 
a 
solid 
of 
some 
other 
figure, 
that 
is, 
to 
expresse 
my 
self 
better, 
whether 
there 
is 
more 
difficulty 
in 
reducing 
a 
piece 
of 
Marble 
into 
the 
figure 
of 
a 
perfect 
Sphere, 
than 
into 
a 
perfect 
Pyramid,orintoaperfect 
Horse,orintoaperfectGrasse-hopper? 


SALV. 


To 
this 
I 
will 
make 
you 
the 
first 
answer: 
and 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
I 
will 
acquit 
my 
self 
of 
the 
assent 
which 
you 
think 
I 
gave 
to 
Simplicius, 
which 
was 
only 
for 
a 
time; 
for 
I 
had 
it 
also 
in 
my 
thoughts, 
before 
I 
intended 
to 
enter 
upon 



any 
other 
matter, 
to 
speak 
that, 
which, 
it 
may 
be, 
is 
the 
same, 
or 
very 
like 
to 
that 
which 
you 
are 
about 
to 
say; 
The 
Sphericall 
Figure 
is 
easier 
to 
be 
made 
than 
any 
other. 
And 
answering 
to 
your 
first 
question, 
I 
say, 
that 
if 
any 
figure 
can 
be 
given 
to 
a 
Solid, 
the 
Spherical 
is 
the 
easiest 
of 
all 
others, 
as 
it 
is 
likewise 
the 
most 
simple, 
and 
holdeth 
the 
same 
place 
amongst 
solid 
figures, 
The 
circular 
Figure 
only 
is 
placed 
amongst 
the 
postulat 
of 
Mathematicians. 
as 
the 
Circle 
holdeth 
amongst 
the 
superficial. 
The 
description 
of 
which 
Circle, 
as 
being 
more 
easie 
than 
all 
the 
rest, 
hath 
alone 
been 
judged 
by 
Mathematicians 
worthy 
to 
be 
put 
amongst 
theDemands 
or 
Petitions. 
postulata 
belonging 
to 
the 
description 
of 
all 
other 
figures. 
And 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
Sphere 
is 
so 
very 
easie, 
that 
if 
in 
a 
plain 
plate 
of 
hard 
metal 
you 
take 
an 
empty 
or 
hollow 
circle, 
within 
which 
any 
Solid 
goeth 
casually 
revolving 
that 
was 
before 
but 
grosly 
rounded, 
it 
shall, 
without 
any 
other 
artifice 
be 
reduced 
to 
a 
Spherical 
figure, 
as 
perfect 
as 
is 
possible 
for 
it 
to 
be; 
provided, 
that 
that 
same 
Solid 
be 
not 
lesse 
than 
the 
Sphere 
that 
would 
passe 
thorow 
that 
Circle. 
And 
that 
which 
is 
yet 
more 
worthy 
of 
our 
consideration 
is, 
that 
within 
the 
self-same 
incavity 
one 
may 
form 
Spheres 
of 
several 
magnitudes. 
Sphericall 
Figures 
of 
sundry 
magnitudes 
may 
be 
made 
with 
one 
onely 
instrument. 
But 
whatis 
requiredto 
the 
making 
ofanHorse,or(asyousay) 
ofa 
Grass-hopper, 
I 
leave 
to 
you 
to 
judge, 
who 
know 
that 
there 
are 
but 
few 
statuaries 
in 
the 
world 
able 
to 
undertake 
such 
a 
piece

And 
I

that

I 
know 
not 
whether 
I 
do 
at 
all 
dissent 
from 
you; 
my 
opinion 
is 
this, 
that 
none 
of 
the 
afore-named 
figures 
can 
be 
perfectly 
obteined; 
but 
for 
the 
approaching 
as 
neer 
as 
is 
possible 
to 
the 
most 
perfect 
degree, 
I 
believe 
that 
it 
is 
incomparably 
more 
easie 
to 
reduce 
the 
Solid 
into 
a 
Spherical 
figure,

into

Like 
as 
the 
great

so

great

the

broken

be 
one 
of

Gentlemen, 
with 
your 
favour, 
I 
may 
say 
that 
we 
have 
sallied 
out 
into 
a 
dispute 
not 
much 
more 
worth 
than 
the 
wool 
of 
a 
goat; 
and 
whereas 
our 
argumentations 
should 
continually 
be 
conversant 
about 
serious 
and 
weighty 
points, 
we 
consume 
our 
time 
in 
frivolous 
and 
impertinent 
wranglings. 
The 
constitution 
of 
the 
Vniverse 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
noble 
Problems. 
Let 
us 
call 
to 
minde, 
I 
pray 
you, 
that 
the 
search 
of 
the 
worlds 
constitution, 
is 
one 
of 
the 



greatest 
and 
noblest 
Problems 
that 
are 
in 
nature; 
and 
so 
much 
the 
greater, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
is 
directed 
to 
the 
resolving 
of 
that 
other; 
to 
wit, 
of 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
Seas 
ebbing 
and 
flowing, 
enquired 
into 
by 
all 
the 
famous 
men, 
that 
have 
hithertobeenintheworld,andpossiblyfound 
out 
bynoneofthem. 
Therefore 
if 
we 
have 
nothing 
more 
remaining 
for 
the 
full 
confutation 
of 
the 
argument 
taken 
from 
the 
Earths 
vertigo, 
which 
was 
the 
last, 
alledged 
to 
prove 
its 
immobility 
upon 
its 
own 
centre, 
let 
us 
passe 
to 
the 
examination 
of 
those 
things 
thatarealledged 
for,andagainst 
the 
Annual 
Motion. 


SAGR. 


I 
would 
not 
have 
you, 
Salviatus, 
measure 
our 
wits 
by 
the 
scale 
of 
yours: 
you, 
who 
use 
to 
be 
continually 
busied 
about 
the 
sublimest 
contemplations, 
esteem 
those 
notions 
frivolous 
and 
below 
you, 
which 
we 
think 
matters 
worthy 
of 
our 
profoundest 
thoughts: 
yet 
sometimes 
for 
our 
satisfaction 
do 
not 
disdain 
to 
stoop 
so 
low 
as 
to 
give 
way 
a 
little 
to 
our 
curiosity. 
As 
to 
the 
refutation 
of 
the 
last 
argument, 
taken 
from 
the 
extrusions 
of 
the 
diurnal 
vertigo, 
far 
less 
than 
what 
hath 
been 
said, 
would 
have 
given 
me 
satisfaction: 
and 
yet 
the 
things 
superfluously 
spoken, 
seemed 
to 
me 
so 
ingenious, 
that 
they 
have 
been 
so 
far 
from 
wearying 
my 
fancy, 
as 
that 
they 
have, 
by 
reason 
of 
their 
novelty, 
entertained 
me 
all 
along 
with 
so 
great 
delight, 
that 
I 
know 
not 
how 
to 
desire 
greater: 
Therefore, 
if 
you 
have 
any 
other 
speculation 
to 
add, 
produce 
it,

SALV. 


I 
have 
always 
taken 
great 
delight 
in 
those 
things 
which 
I 
have 
had 
the 
fortune 
to 
discover, 
and 
next 
to 
that, 
which 
is 
my 
chief 
content, 
I 
find 
great 
pleasure 
in 
imparting 
them 
to 
some 
friends, 
that 
apprehendeth 
and 
seemeth 
to 
like 
them: 
Now, 
in 
regard 
you 
are 
one 
of 
these, 
slacking 
a 
little 
the 
reins 
of 
my 
ambition, 
which 
is 
much 
pleased 
when 
I 
shew 
my 
self 
more 
perspicacious, 
than 
some 
other 
that 
hath 
the 
reputation 
of 
a 
sharp 
sight, 
I 
will 
for 
a 
full 
and 
true 
measure 
of 
the 
past 
dispute, 
produce 
another 
fallacy 
of 
the 
Sectators 
of 
PtolomeyandAristotle,whichItakefromtheargumentalledged. 


SAGR. 


See

SALV. 


We 
have 
hitherto 
over-passed, 
and 
granted 
to 
Ptolomey, 
as 
an 
effect 
indubitable, 
that 
the 
extrusion 
of 
the 
stone 
proceeding 
from 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
wheel 
turn’d 
round 
upon 
its 
centre, 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
said 
extrusion 
encreaseth 
in 
proportion, 
as 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
vertigo 
(or 
whirling) 
is 
augmented: 
from 
whence 
it 
was 
inferred, 
that 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
Earth’s 
vertigo 
being 
very 
much 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
any 
machin 
whatsoever, 
that 
we 
can 
make 
to 
turn 
round 
artificially; 
the 
extrusion 
of 
stones, 
of 
animals, 
&c. 
would 
consequently 
be 
far 
more 
violent. 
Now, 
I 
observe 
that 
there 
is 
a 
great 
fallacy 
in 
this 
discourse, 
in 
that 
we 
do 
compare 
these 
velocities 
indifferently 
and 
absolutely 
to 
one 
another. 
It’s 
true, 
that 
if 
I 
compare 
the 
velocities 
of 
the 
same 
wheel, 
or 
of 
two 
wheels 
equal 
to 
each 
other, 
that 
which 
shall 
be 
more 
swiftly 
turn’d 
round, 
shall 
extrude 
the 
stone 
with 
greater 
violence; 
and 
the 
velocity 
encreasing, 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
projection 
shall 
likewise 
encrease: 
but 
when 
the 
velocity 
is 
augmented, 
not 
by 
encreasing 
the 
velocity 
in 
the 
same 
wheel, 
which 
would 
be 
by 
causing 
it 
to 
make 
a 
greater 
number 
of 
revolutions 
in 
equal 
times; 
but 
by 
encreasing 
the 
diameter, 
and 
making 
the 
wheel 
greater, 
so 
as 
that 
the 
conversion 
taking 
up 
the 
same 
time 
in 
the 
lesser 
wheel, 
as 
in 
the 
greater, 
The 
cause 
of 
the 
projection 
increaseth 
not 
according 
to 
the 
proportionof 
the 
velocity, 
increased 
by 
making 
the 
wheel 
bigger. 
the 
velocity 
is 
greater 
onely 
in 
the 
bigger 
wheel, 
for 
that 
its 
circumference 
is 
bigger; 
there 
is 
no 
man 
that 
thinketh 
that 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
extrusion 
in 
the 
great 
wheel 
will 
encrease 
according 
to 
the 
proportion 
of 
the 
velocity 
of 
its 
circumference, 
to 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
other 
lesser 
wheel; 
for 
that 
this 
is 
most 
false, 
as 
by 
a 
most 
expeditious 
experiment 
I 
shall 
thus 
grosly 
declare: 
We 
may 
sling 
a 
stone 
with 
a 
stick 
of 
a 
yard 
long, 
farther 
than 
we 
can 
do 
with 
a 
stick 
six 
yards 
long, 
though 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
end 
of 
the 
long 
stick, 
that 
is 
of 
the 
stone 
placed 
in 
the 
slit 
thereof, 
were 
more 
than 
double 
as 
swift 
as 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
end 
of 
the 
other 
shorter 
stick, 
as 
it 
would 
be 
if 
the 
velocities 
were 
such 
that 
the 
lesser 
stick 
should 
turn 
thrice 
round 
in 
the 
time 
whilst 
the 
greateris 
making 
oneonelyconversion. 


SAGR. 


This 
which 
you 
tell 
me, 
Salviatus, 
must, 
I 
see, 
needs 
succeed 
in 
this 
very 
manner; 
but 
I 
do 
not 
so 
readily 
apprehend 
the 
cause 
why 
equal 
velocities 



should 
not 
operate 
equally 
in 
extruding 
projects, 
but 
that 
of 
the 
lesser 
wheel 
much 
more 
than 
the 
other 
of 
the 
greater 
wheel; 
therefore 
I 
intreat 
you 
to 
tell 
mehowthiscomethto 
pass? 


SIMP. 


Herein, 
Sagredus, 
you 
seem 
to 
differ 
much 
from 
your 
self, 
for 
that 
you 
were 
wont 
to 
penetrate 
all 
things 
in 
an 
instant, 
and 
now 
you 
have 
overlook’d 
a 
fallacycouched 
intheexperimentof 
the 
stick,which 
Imyselfhavebeenable 
to 
discover: 
and 
this 
is 
the 
different 
manner 
of 
operating, 
in 
making 
the 
projection 
one 
while 
with 
the 
short 
sling 
and 
another 
while 
with 
the 
long 
one, 
for 
if 
you 
will 
have 
the 
stone 
fly 
out 
of 
the 
slit, 
you 
need 
not 
continue 
its 
motion 
uniformly, 
but 
at 
such 
time 
as 
it 
is 
at 
the 
swiftest, 
you 
are 
to 
stay 
your 
arm, 
and 
stop 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
stick; 
whereupon 
the 
stone 
which 
was 
in 
its 
swiftest 
motion, 
flyeth 
out, 
and 
moveth 
with 
impetuosity: 
but 
now 
that 
stop 
cannot 
be 
made 
in 
the 
great 
stick, 
which 
by 
reason 
of 
its 
length 
and 
flexibility, 
doth 
not 
entirely 
obey 
the 
check 
of 
the 
arm, 
but 
continueth 
to 
accompany 
the 
stone 
for 
some 
space, 
and 
holdeth 
it 
in 
with 
so 
much 
less 
force, 
and 
not 
as 
if 
you 
had 
with 
a 
stiff 
sling 
sent 
it 
going 
with 
a 
jerk: 
for 
if 
both 
the 
sticks 
or 
slings 
should 
be 
check’d 
by 
one 
and 
the 
same 
obstacle, 
I 
do 
believe 
they 
would 
fly 
aswell 
out 
of 
the 
one, 
as 
out 
of 
the 
other, 
howbeit 
their 
motionswereequallyswift. 


SAGR. 


With 
the 
permission 
of 
Salviatus, 
I 
will 
answer 
something 
to 
Simplicius, 
in 
regard 
he 
hath 
addressed 
himself 
to 
me; 
and 
I 
say, 
that 
in 
his 
discourse 
there 
is 
somewhat 
good 
and 
somewhat 
bad: 
good, 
because 
it 
is 
almost 
all 
true; 
bad, 
because 
it 
doth 
not 
agree 
with 
our 
case: 
Truth 
is, 
that 
when 
that 
which 
carrieth 
the 
stones 
with 
velocity, 
shall 
meet 
with 
a 
check 
that 
is 
immoveable, 
they 
shall 
fly 
out 
with 
great 
impetuosity: 
the 
same 
effect 
following 
in 
that 
case, 
which 
we 
see 
dayly 
to 
fall 
out 
in 
a 
boat 
that 
running 
a 
swift 
course, 
runs 
a-ground, 
or 
meets 
with 
some 
sudden 
stop, 
for 
all 
those 
in 
the 
boat, 
being 
surprized, 
Gran 
i 
g 
the 
diurnal 
vertigo 
of 
the 
Earth, 
& 
that 
by 
some 
sudden 
stop 
or 
obstacle 
it 
were 
arrested, 
houses, 
mountains 
themselves, 
and 
perhaps 
the 
whole 
Globe 
would 
be 
shake 
n 
pieces. 
stumble 
forwards, 
and 
fall 
towards 
thepartwhithertheboat 
steered. 
Andin 
casetheEarth 
shouldmeetwith 
such 
a 
check, 
as 
should 
be 
able 
to 
resist 
and 
arrest 
its 
vertigo, 
then 
indeed 
I 
do 



believe 
that 
not 
onely 
beasts, 
buildings 
and 
cities, 
but 
mountains, 
lakes 
and 
seas 
would 
overturn, 
and 
the 
globe 
it 
self 
would 
go 
near 
to 
shake 
in 
pieces; 
but 
nothing 
of 
all 
this 
concerns 
our 
present 
purpose, 
for 
we 
speak 
of 
what 
may 
follow 
to 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth, 
it 
being 
turn’d 
round 
uniformly, 
and 
quietly 
about 
its 
own 
centre, 
howbeit 
with 
a 
great 
velocity. 
That 
likewise 
which 
you 
say 
of 
the 
slings, 
is 
true 
in 
part; 
but 
was 
not 
alledged 
by 
Salviatus, 
as 
a 
thing 
that 
punctually 
agreed 
with 
the 
matter 
whereof 
we 
treat, 
but 
onely, 
as 
an 
example, 
for 
so 
in 
gross 
it 
may 
prompt 
us 
in 
the 
more 
accurate 
consideration 
of 
that 
point, 
whether, 
the 
velocity 
increasing 
at 
any 
rate, 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
projection 
doth 
increase 
at 
the 
same 
rate: 
so 
that 
v. 
g. 
if 
a 
wheel 
of 
ten 
yards 
diameter, 
moving 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
that 
a 
point 
of 
its 
circumference 
will 
pass 
an 
hundred 
yards 
in 
a 
minute 
of 
an 
hour, 
and 
so 
hath 
an 
impetus 
able 
to 
extrude 
a 
stone, 
that 
same 
impetus 
shall 
be 
increased 
an 
hundred 
thousand 
times 
in 
a 
wheel 
of 
a 
million 
of 
yards 
diameter; 
the 
which 
Salviatus 
denieth, 
and 
I 
incline 
to 
his 
opinion; 
but 
not 
knowing 
the 
reason 
thereof,Ihaverequesteditofhim,andstandimpatientlyexpectingit. 


SALV. 


I 
am 
ready 
to 
give 
you 
the 
best 
satisfaction, 
that 
my 
abilities 
will 
give 
leave: 
And 
though 
in 
my 
first 
discourse 
you 
thought 
that 
I 
had 
enquired 
into 
things 
estranged 
from 
our 
purpose, 
yet 
neverthelesse 
I 
believe 
that 
in 
the 
sequel 
of 
the 
dispute, 
you 
will 
find 
that 
they 
do 
not 
prove 
so. 
Therefore 
let 
Sagredus 
tell 
me 
wherein 
he 
hath 
observed 
that 
the 
resistance 
of 
any 
moveable 
to 
motiondoth 
consist. 


SAGR. 


I 
see 
not 
for 
the 
present 
that 
the 
moveable 
hath 
any 
internal 
resistance 
to 
motion, 
unlesse 
it 
be 
its 
natural 
inclination 
and 
propension 
to 
the 
contrary 
motion, 
as 
in 
grave 
bodies, 
that 
have 
a 
propension 
to 
the 
motion 
downwards, 
the 
resistance 
is 
to 
the 
motion 
upwards; 
and 
I 
said 
an 
internal 
resistance, 
because 
of 
this, 
I 
think, 
it 
is 
you 
intend 
to 
speak, 
and 
not 
of 
the 
external 
resistances, 
whicharemanyand 
accidental. 


SALV. 



It 
is 
that 
indeed 
I 
mean, 
and 
your 
nimblenesse 
of 
wit 
hath 
been 
too 
hard 
for 
my 
craftinesse, 
but 
if 
I 
have 
been 
too 
short 
in 
asking 
the 
question, 
I 
doubt 
whether 
Sagredus 
hath 
been 
full 
enough 
in 
his 
answer 
to 
satisfie 
the 
demand; 
and 
whether 
there 
be 
not 
in 
the 
moveable, 
besides 
the 
natural 
inclination 
to 
the 
contrary 
term, 
another 
intrinsick 
and 
natural 
quality, 
The 
inclination 
of 
grave 
bodies 
to 
the 
motion 
downwards, 
is 
equal 
to 
their 
resistance 
to 
the 
motion 
upwards. 
which 
maketh 
it 
averse 
to 
motion. 
Therefore 
tell 
me 
again; 
do 
you 
not 
think 
that 
the 
inclination 
v. 
g. 
of 
grave 
bodies 
to 
move 
downwards, 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
same 
to 
the 
motion 
of 
projection 
upwards? 


SAGR. 


I 
believe 
that 
it 
is 
exactly 
the 
same. 
And 
for 
this 
reason 
I 
see 
that 
two 
equal 
weights 
being 
put 
into 
a 
ballance, 
they 
do 
stand 
still 
in 
equilibrium, 
the 
gravity 
of 
the 
one 
resisting 
its 
being 
raised 
by 
the 
gravity 
wherewith 
the 
other 
pressingdownwardswouldraiseit. 


SALV. 


Very 
well; 
so 
that 
if 
you 
would 
have 
one 
raise 
up 
the 
other, 
you 
must 
encrease 
the 
weight 
of 
that 
which 
depresseth, 
or 
lessen 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
other. 
But 
if 
the 
resistance 
to 
ascending 
motion 
cunsist 
onely 
in 
gravity, 
how 
cometh 
it 
to 
passe, 
that 
in 
ballances 
of 
unequal 
arms, 
to 
wit 
in 
theA 
portable 
ballance 
wherewith 
market-people 
weigh 
their 
commodities, 
giving 
it 
gravity 
by 
removing 
the 
weight 
farther 
from 
the 
cock: 
call’d 
by 
the 
Latines, 
Campana 
trutina. 
Stiliard, 
a 
weight 
sometimes 
of 
an 
hundred 
pounds, 
with 
its 
pression 
downwards, 
doth 
not 
suffice 
to 
raise 
up 
on 
of 
four 
pounds; 
that 
shall 
counterpoise 
with 
it, 
nay 
this 
of 
four, 
descending 
shall 
raise 
up 
that 
of 
an 
hundred; 
for 
such 
is 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
pendant 
weight 
upon 
the 
weight 
which 
vve 
vvould 
vveigh? 
If 
the 
resistance 
to 
motion 
resideth 
onely 
in 
the 
gravity, 
hovv 
can 
the 
arm 
with 
its 
vveight 
of 
four 
pounds 
onely, 
resist 
the 
vveight 
of 
a 
sack 
of 
wool, 
or 
bale 
of 
silk, 
vvhich 
shall 
be 
eight 
hundred, 
or 
a

yea 
more, 
hovv 
can 
it 
overcome 
the 
sack 
vvith 
its 
moment, 
and 
raise 
it 
up? 
It 
must 
therefore 
be 
confest 
Sagredus, 
that 
here 
it

It

I 
think 
that 
your 
putting 
me 
to 
it 
a 
second 
time, 
hath 
made 
me 
remember 
something 
that 
may 
be 
to 
the 
purpose. 
In 
both 
these 
beams 
the 
business 
is 
done 
by 
the 
weight, 
and 
by 
the 
motion; 
in 
the 
ballance, 
the 
motions 
are 
equal, 
and 
therefore 
the 
one 
weight 
must 
exceed 
it 
in 
gravity 
before 
it 
can 
move 
it; 
in 
the 
stiliard, 
the 
lesser 
weight 
will 
not 
move 
the 
greater, 
unless 
when 
this 
latter 
moveth 
little, 
as 
being 
hung 
at 
a 
lesser 
distance, 
and 
the 
other 
much, 
as 
hanging 
at 
a 
greater 
distance 
from 
the 
lacquet 
or 
cock. 
It 
is 
necessary 
therefore 
to 
conclude, 
that 
the 
lesser 
weight 
overcometh 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
greater,by 
moving 
much, 
whilsttheotherismovedbutlittle. 


SALV. 


Which 
is 
as 
much 
as 
to 
say, 
that

But 
do 
you

SALV. 


Yes 
doubtless, 
as 
I 
am 
able 
by 
many 
experiments 
to 
demonstrate: 
but 
for 
the 
present, 
let 
this 
onely 
of 
the 
stiliard 
suffice: 
in 
which 
you 
see 
that 
the 
light 
end 
of 
the 
beam 
is 
then 
able 
to 
sustain 
and 
equilibrate 
the 
great 
Wool-sack, 



when 
its 
distance 
from 
the 
centre, 
upon 
which 
the 
stiliard 
resteth 
and 
turneth, 
shall 
so 
much 
exceed 
the 
lesser 
distance, 
by 
how 
much 
the 
absolute 
gravity 
of 
the 
Wool-sack 
exceedeth 
that 
of 
the 
pendent 
weight. 
And 
we 
see 
nothing 
that 
can 
cause 
this 
insufficiencie 
in 
the 
great 
sack 
of 
Wool, 
to 
raise 
with 
its 
weight 
the 
pendent 
weight 
so 
much 
less 
grave, 
save 
the 
disparity 
of 
the 
motions 
which 
the 
one 
and 
the 
other 
should 
make, 
whilst 
that 
the 
Wool-sack 
by 
descending 
but 
one 
inch 
onely, 
will 
raise 
the 
pendent 
weight 
an 
hundred 
inches: 
(supposing 
that 
the 
sack 
did 
weigh 
an 
hundred 
times 
as 
much, 
and 
that 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
small 
weight 
from 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
beam 
were 
an 
hundred 
times 
greater, 
than 
the 
distance 
between 
the 
said 
centre 
and 
the 
point 
of 
the 
sacks 
suspension.) 
And 
again, 
the 
pendent 
weight 
its 
moving 
the 
space 
of 
an 
hundred 
inches, 
in 
the 
time 
that 
the 
sack 
moveth 
but 
one 
inch 
onely, 
is 
the 
same 
as 
to 
say, 
that 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
little 
pendent 
weight, 
is 
an 
hundred 
times 
greater 
than 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
sack. 
Now 
fix 
it 
in 
your 
belief, 
as 
a 
true 
and 
manifest 
axiom, 
that 
the 
resistance 
which 
proceedeth 
from 
the 
velocity 
of 
motion, 
compensateth 
that 
which 
dependeth 
on 
the 
gravity 
of 
another 
moveable: 
So 
that 
consequently, 
a 
moveable 
of 
one 
pound, 
that 
moveth 
with 
an 
hundred 
degrees 
of 
velocity, 
doth 
as 
much 
resist 
all 
obstruction, 
as 
another 
moveable 
of 
an 
hundred 
weight, 
whose 
velocity 
is 
butone 
degreeonely. 
And 
twoequalmoveables 
willequallyresisttheirbeing 
moved, 
if 
that 
they 
shall 
be 
moved 
with 
equal 
velocity: 
but 
if 
one 
be 
to 
be 
moved 
more 
swiftly 
than 
the 
other, 
it 
shall 
make 
greater 
resistance, 
according 
to 
the 
greater 
velocity 
that 
shall 
be 
conferred 
on 
it. 
These 
things 
being 
premised, 
let 
us 
proceed 
to 
the 
explanation 
of 
our 
Problem; 
and 
for 
the 
better 
understanding 
of 
things, 
let 
us 
make 
a 
short 
Scheme 
thereof. 
Let 
two 
unequal 
wheels 
be 
described 
about 
this 
centre 
A, 
[in 
Fig. 
7. 
] 
and 
let 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
lesser 
be 
BG, 
and 
of 
the 
greater 
CEH, 
and 
let 
the 
semidiameter 
ABC, 
be 
perpendicular 
to 
the 
Horizon; 
and 
by 
the 
points 
B 
and 
C, 
let 
us 
draw 
the 
right 
lined 
Tangents 
BF 
and 
CD; 
and 
in 
the 
arches 
BG 
and 
CE, 
take 
two 
equal 
parts 
BG 
and 
CE: 
and 
let 
the 
two 
wheels 
be 
supposed 
to 
be 
turn’d 
round 
upon 
their 
centres 
with 
equal 
velocities, 
so 
as 
that 
two 
moveables, 
which 
suppose 
for 
example 
to 
be 
two 
stones 
placed 
in 
the 
points 
B 
and 
C, 
come 
to 
be 
carried 
along 
the 
circumferences 
BG 
and 
CE, 
with 
equal 
velocities; 
so 
that 
in 
the 
same 
time 
that 
the 
stone 
B 
shall 
have 
run 
the 
arch 
BG, 
the 
stone 
C 
will 
have 
past 
the 
arch 
CE. 
I 
say 
now, 
that 
the 
whirl 
or 
vertigo 
of 
the 
lesser 
wheel 
is 
much 
more 
potent 
to 
make 
the 
projection 
of 
the 
stone 
B, 
than 
the 
vertigo 
of 
the 
bigger 
wheel 
to 
make 
that 
of 
the 
stone 
C. 



Therefore 
the 
projection, 
as 
we 
have 
already 
declared, 
being 
to 
be 
made 
along 
the 
tangent, 
when 
the 
stones 
B 
and 
C 
are 
to 
separate 
from 
their 
wheel, 
and 
to 
begin 
the 
motion 
of 
projection 
from 
the 
points 
B 
and 
C, 
then 
shall 
they 
be 
extruded 
by 
the 
impetus 
conceived 
from 
the 
vertigo 
by 
(or 
along) 
the 
tangents 
BF 
and 
CD. 
The 
two 
stones 
therefore 
have 
equal 
impetuosities 
of 
running 
along 
the 
tangents 
BF 
and 
CD, 
and 
would 
run 
along 
the 
same, 
if 
they 
werenotturn’d 
aside 
bysomeotherforce:isit

But 
what 
force, 
think 
you, 
should 
that 
be 
which 
averts 
the 
stones 
from 
moving 
by 
the 
tangents, 
along 
which 
they 
are 
certainly 
driven 
by 
the 
impetus 
ofthevertigo. 


SAGR. 


It 
is 
either 
their 
own 
gravity, 
or 
else 
some 
glutinous 
matter 
that 
holdeth 
them 
fast 
andcloseto 
the 
wheels. 


SALV. 


But 
for 
the 
diverting 
of 
a 
moveable 
from 
the 
motion 
to 
which 
nature 
inciteth 
it, 
is 
there 
not 
required 
greater 
or 
lesser 
force, 
according 
as 
the 
deviation 
is 
intended 
to 
be 
greater 
or 
lesser? 
that 
is, 
according 
as

said

SAGR. 


Yes 
certainly: 
for 
it 
was 
concluded 
even 
now, 
that 
to 
make 
a 
moveable 
to 
move; 
the 
movent 
vertue 
must 
be 
increased 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
velocity 
wherewith 
itis 
tomove. 


SALV. 



Now 
consider, 
that 
for 
the 
deviating 
the 
stone 
upon 
the 
lesse 
wheel 
from 
the 
motion 
of 
projection, 
which 
it 
would 
make 
by 
the 
tangent 
BF, 
and 
for 
the 
holding 
of 
it 
fast 
to 
the 
wheel, 
it 
is 
required, 
that 
its 
own 
gravity 
draw 
it 
back 
the 
whole 
length 
of 
the 
secant 
FG, 
or 
of 
the 
perpendicular 
raised 
from 
the 
point 
G, 
to 
the 
line 
BF, 
whereas 
in 
the 
greater 
wheel 
the 
retraction 
needs 
to 
be 
no 
more 
than 
the 
secant 
DE, 
or 
the 
perpendicular 
let 
fall 
from 
the 
tangent 
DC 
to 
the 
point 
E, 
lesse 
by 
much 
than 
FG, 
and 
alwayes 
lesser 
and 
lesser 
according 
as 
the 
wheel 
is 
made 
bigger. 
And 
forasmuch 
as 
these 
retractions 
(asImaycallthem)arerequired 
tobemadein

thatis,whil’stthe

passe 
the

equal 
arches 
BG 
and

that 
of 
the 
stone 
B, 
that 
is, 
the 
retraction 
FG 
ought 
to 
be 
more 
swift 
than 
the 
other 
DE; 
and 
therefore 
much 
greater 
force 
will 
be 
required 
for 
holding 
fast 
the 
stone 
B 
to 
its 
little 
wheel, 
than 
for 
the 
holding 
the 
stone 
C 
to 
its 
great 
one, 
which 
is 
as 
much 
as 
to 
say, 
that 
such 
a 
small 
thing 
will 
impede 
the 
extrusion 
in 
the 
great 
wheel, 
as 
will 
not 
at 
all 
hinder 
it 
in 
the 
little 
one. 
It 
is 
manifest 
therefore 
that 
the 
more

SAGR. 


From 
this 
which 
I 
now 
understand, 
by 
help 
of 
your 
minute 
dissertation, 
I 
am 
induced 
to 
think, 
that 
I 
am 
able 
to 
satisfie 
my 
judgment 
in 
a 
very 
few 
words. 
For 
equal 
impetus 
being 
impressed 
on 
both 
the 
stones 
that 
move 
along 
the 
tangents, 
by 
the 
equal 
velocity 
of 
the 
two 
wheels, 
we 
see 
the 
great 
circumference, 
by 
means 
of 
its 
small 
deviation 
from 
the 
tangent, 
to 
go 
seconding, 
as 
it 
were, 
and 
in 
a 
fair 
way 
refraining 
in 
the 
stone 
the 
appetite, 
if 
I 
may 
so 
say, 
of 
separating 
from 
the 
circumference; 
so 
that 
any 
small 
retention, 
either 
of 
its 
own 
inclination, 
or 
of 
some 
glutination 
sufficeth 
to 
hold 
it 
fast 
to 
the 
wheel. 
Which, 
again, 
is 
not 
able 
to 
work 
the 
like 
effect 
in 
the 
little 
wheel, 
which 
but 
little 
prosecuting 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
tangent, 
seeketh 
with 
too 
much 
eagernesse 
to 
hold 
fast 
the 
stone; 
and 
the 
restriction 
and 
glutination 
not 
being 
stronger 
than 
that 
which 
holdeth 
the 
other 
stone 
fast 
tothegreaterwheel,itStrapparlacavezza,is 
tobreakthebridle. 
breaksloose, 
and 
runneth 
along 
the 
tangent. 
Therefore 
I 
do 
not 
only 
finde 
that 
all 
those 
have 
erred, 
who 
have 
believed 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
projection 
to 
increase 
according 
to 
the 
augmentation 
of 
the 
vertigo’s 
velocity; 
but 
I 
am 
further 
thinking, 
that 
the 
projection 
diminishing 
in 
the 
inlarging 
of 
the 
wheel, 
so 
long 
as 
the 
same 
velocity 
is 
reteined 
in 
those 
wheels; 
it 
may 
possibly 
be 
true, 
that 



he 
that 
would 
make 
the 
great 
wheel 
extrude 
things 
like 
the 
little 
one, 
would 
be 
forced 
to 
increase 
them 
as 
much 
in 
velocity; 
as 
they 
increase 
in 
diameter, 
which 
he 
might 
do, 
by 
making 
them 
to 
finish 
their 
conversions 
in 
equal 
times; 
and 
thus 
we 
may 
conclude, 
that 
the 
Earths 
revolution 
or 
vertigo 
would 
be 
no 
more 
able 
to 
extrude 
stones, 
than 
any 
little 
wheel 
that 
goeth 
so 
slowly, 
asthatitmaketh 
butoneturn

We 
will 
enquire

this

the

let 
it 
suffice 
that

have 
abundantly 
(if 
I 
deceive 
not 
my 
self) 
demonstrated 
the 
invalidity 
of 
the 
argument, 
which 
at 
first 
sight 
seemed 
very 
concluding, 
and 
was 
so 
held 
by 
very 
famous 
men: 
and 
I 
shall 
think 
my 
time

words 
well 
bestowed, 
if 
I 
have 
but 
gained 
some 
belief 
in 
the 
opinion 
of

I 
will 
not 
say 
of 
the 
Earths 
mobility,

only 
that 
the

six 
days 
in 
falling 
from 
the 
Concave 
of 
the 
Moon 
to 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
according 
to 
the 
opinion 
of 
that 
modern 
Author 
of 
the 
Conclusions. 
being 
placed 
in 
the 
concave 
of 
the 
Lunar 
Orb, 
supposing 
it 
also 
as 
big 
as 
Copernicus 
himself 
representeth 
it, 
to 
take 
away 
all 
subterfuges 
from 
his 
adversary. 
And 
having 
made 
this 
most 
ingenious 
and 
exquisite 
supputation, 
he 
sheweth, 
that 
a 
grave 
body 
falling 
from 
thence 
above 
would 
consume 
more 
than 
six 
dayes 
in 
attaining 
to 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
to 
which 
all 
grave 
bodies 
naturally 
move. 
Now 
if 
by 
the 
absolute 
Divine 
Power, 
or 
by 
some 
Angel, 
a 
very 
great 
Cannon 
bullet 
were 
carried 
up 
thither, 
and 
placed 
in 
our 
Zenith 
or 
vertical 
point, 
and 
from 
thence 
let 
go 
at 
liberty, 
it 
is 
in 
his, 
and 
also 
in 
my 
opinion, 
a 
most 
incredible 
thing 
that 
it, 
in 
descending 
downwards, 
should 
all 
the 
way 
maintain 
it 
self 
in 
our 
vertical 
line, 
continuing 
to 
turn 
round 
with 
the 
Earth, 
about 
its 
centre, 
for 
so 
many 
dayes, 
describing 
under 
the 
Equinoctial 
a 
Spiral 
line 
in 
the 
plain 
of 
the 
great 
circle 
it 
self; 
and 
under 
other 
Parallels, 
Spiral 
lines 
about 
Cones, 
and 
under 
the 
Poles 
falling 
by 
a 



simple 
right 
line. 
He, 
in 
the 
next 
place, 
stablisheth 
and 
confirmeth 
this 
great 
improbability 
by 
proving, 
in 
the 
way 
of 
interrogations, 
many 
difficulties 
impossible 
to 
be 
removed 
by 
the 
followers 
of 
Copernicus; 
and 
they 
are, 
if 
I 
dowell 
remember 
—. 


SALV. 


Take 
up 
a 
little, 
good 
Simplicius, 
and 
do 
not 
load 
me 
with 
so 
many 
novelties 
atonce:Ihavebutabad 
memory, 
andthereforeImustnotgo 
too 
fast. 
Andin 
regard 
it 
cometh 
into 
my 
minde, 
that 
I 
once 
undertook 
to 
calculate 
how 
long 
time 
such 
a 
grave 
body 
falling 
from 
the 
concave 
of 
the 
Moon, 
would 
be 
in 
passing 
to 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
and 
that 
I 
think 
I 
remember 
that 
the 
time 
would 
not 
be 
so 
long; 
it 
would 
be 
fit 
that 
you 
shew 
us 
by 
what 
rule 
this 
Authormadehiscalculation. 


SIMP. 


He 
hath 
done 
it 
by 
proving 
his 
intent 
à 
fortiori, 
a 
sufficient 
advantage 
for 
his 
adversaries, 
supposing 
that 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
body 
falling 
along 
the 
vertical 
line, 
towards 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
were 
equal 
to 
the 
velocity 
of 
its 
circular 
motion, 
which 
it 
made 
in 
the 
grand 
circle 
of 
the 
concave 
of 
the 
Lunar 
Orb. 
Which 
by 
equation 
would 
come 
to 
passe 
in 
an 
hour, 
twelve 
thousand 
six 
hundred 
German 
miles, 
a 
thing 
which 
indeed 
savours 
of 
impossibility: 
Yet 
neverthelesse, 
to 
shew 
his 
abundant 
caution, 
and 
to 
give 
all 
advantages 
to 
his 
adversaries, 
he 
supposeth 
it 
for 
true, 
and 
concludeth, 
that 
the 
time 
of 
the 
fall 
oughthowevertobemorethansix 
dayes. 


SALV. 


And 
is 
this 
the 
sum 
of 
his 
method? 
And 
doth 
he 
by 
this 
demonstration 
prove 
thetimeofthefalltobe 
abovesixdayes? 


SAGR. 


Me 
thinks 
that 
he 
hath 
behaved 
himself 
too 
modestly, 
for 
that 
having 
it 
in 
the 
power 
of 
his 
will 
to 
give 
what 
velocity 
he 
pleased 
to 
such 
a 
descending 
body, 
and 
might 
aswell 
have 
made 
it 
six 
moneths, 
nay, 
six 
years 
in 
falling 
to 
the 
Earth, 
he 
is 
content 
with 
six 
dayes. 
But, 
good 
Salviatus, 
sharpen 
my 
appetite 



a 
little, 
by 
telling 
me 
in 
what 
manner 
you 
made 
your 
computation, 
in 
regard 
you 
say, 
that 
you 
have 
heretofore 
cast 
it 
up: 
for 
I 
am 
confident 
that 
if 
the 
question 
had 
not 
required 
some 
ingenuity 
in 
working 
it, 
you 
would 
never 
haveappliedyour 
mindeunto 
it. 


SALV. 


It 
is 
not 
enough, 
Sagredus, 
that 
the 
subjects 
be 
noble 
and 
great, 
but 
the 
businesse 
consists 
in 
handling 
it 
nobly. 
And 
who 
knoweth 
not, 
that 
in 
the 
dissection 
of 
the 
members 
of 
a 
beast, 
there 
may 
be 
discovered 
infinite 
wonders 
of 
provident 
and 
prudent 
Nature; 
and 
yet 
for 
one, 
that 
the 
Anatomist 
dissects, 
the 
butcher 
cuts 
up 
a 
thousand. 
Thus 
I, 
who 
am 
now 
seeking 
how 
to 
satisfie 
your 
demand, 
cannot 
tell 
with 
which 
of 
the 
two 
shapes 
I 
had 
best 
to 
appear 
on 
the 
Stage; 
but 
yet, 
taking 
heart 
from 
the 
example 
of 
Simplicius, 
his 
Authour, 
I 
will, 
without 
more 
delays, 
give 
you 
an 
account 
(if 
I 
have 
not 
forgot) 
how 
I 
proceeded. 
But 
before 
I 
go 
any 
further, 
I 
must 
not 
omit 
to 
tell 
you, 
that 
I 
much 
fear 
that 
Simplicius 
hath 
not 
faithfully 
related 
the 
manner 
how 
this 
his 
Authour 
found, 
that 
the 
Cannon 
bullet 
in 
coming 
from 
the 
concave 
of 
the 
Moon 
to 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
would 
spend 
more 
than 
six 
dayes: 
for 
if 
he 
had 
supposed 
that 
its 
velocity 
in 
descending 
was 
equal 
to 
that 
of 
the 
concave 
(as 
Simplicius 
saith 
he 
doth 
suppose) 
he 
would 
have 
shewn 
himself 
ignorant 
of 
the 
first, 
and 
more 
simple 
principles 
of 
Geometry; 
yea, 
I 
admire 
that 
Simplicius, 
in 
admitting 
the 
supposition 
which 
he 
speaketh 
of, 
dothnotseethemonstrousabsurditythatiscouchedinit. 


SIMP. 


Its 
possible 
that 
I 
may 
have 
erred 
in 
relating 
it; 
but 
that 
I 
see 
any 
fallacy 
in 
it, 
Iamsureis 
not 
true. 


SALV. 


Perhaps 
I 
did 
not 
rightly 
apprehend 
that 
which 
you 
said, 
Do 
you 
not 
say, 
that 
this 
Authour 
maketh 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
bullet 
in 
descending 
equall 
to 
that 
which 
it 
had 
in 
turning 
round, 
being 
in 
the 
concave 
of 
the 
Moon, 
and 
that 
comming 
down 
with 
the 
same 
velocity, 
it 
would 
reach 
to 
the 
centre 
in 
six 
dayes? 



SIMP. 


So,asI 
think,hewriteth. 


SALV. 


And 
do 
not 
you 
pe 
ceive 
a 
shamefull 
errour 
therein? 
But 
questionlesse 
you 
dissembleit: 
Foritcannotbe, 
but 
that 
you 
should 
knowthatthe 
semidiameter 
of 
the 
Circle 
is 
lesse 
than 
the 
sixth 
part 
of 
the 
circumference; 
A 
shamefull 
errour 
in 
the 
Argument 
taken 
from 
the 
bullets 
falling 
out 
of 
the 
Moons 
concave. 
and 
that 
consequently, 
the 
time 
in 
which 
the 
moveable 
shall 
passe 
the 
semidiameter, 
shall 
be 
lesse 
than 
the 
sixth 
part 
of 
the 
time; 
in 
which, 
being 
moved 
with 
the 
same 
velocity, 
it 
would 
passe 
the 
circumference; 
and 
that 
therefore 
the 
bullet 
descending 
with 
the 
velocity, 
wherewith 
it 
moved 
in 
the 
concave, 
will 
arrive 
in 
lesse 
than 
four 
hours 
at 
the 
centre, 
supposing 
that 
in 
the 
concave 
one 
revolution 
should 
be 
consummate 
in 
twenty 
four 
hours, 
as 
he 
must 
of 
necessity 
have 
supposed 
it, 
for 
to 
keep 
it 
all 
the 
way 
in 
the 
same 
verticalline. 


SIMP. 


Now 
I 
thorowly 
perceive 
the 
mistake: 
but 
yet 
I 
would 
not 
lay 
it 
upon 
him 
undeservedly, 
for 
it’s 
possible 
that 
I 
may 
have 
erred 
in 
rehearsing 
his 
Argument, 
and 
to 
avoid 
running 
into 
the 
same 
mistakes 
for 
the 
future, 
I 
could 
wish 
I 
had 
his 
Book; 
and 
if 
you 
had 
any 
body 
to 
send 
for

I 
would 
take 
it 
fora 
great

I 
verily 
believe 
that 
this 
would 
be 
the 
answer 
of 
the 
Philosopher. 
Against 
which 
Imakeoppositionanotherway;andaskyou,whether 
youthinkthatby 
way 
of 
joynts 
and 
flexures 
one 
may 
adapt 
the 
terrestrial 
Globe 
to 
the 
participation 
of 
three 
different 
circular 
motions? 
Do 
you 
not 
answer 
me? 
Seeing 
you 
are 
speechlesse, 
I 
will 
undertake 
to 
answer 
for 
the 
Philosopher, 
who 
would 
absolutely 
reply 
that 
they 
might; 
for 
that 
otherwise 
it 
would 
have 
been 
superfluous, 
and 
besides 
the 
purpose 
to 
have 
proposed 
to 
consideration, 
that 
nature 
maketh 
the 
flexions, 
to 
the 
end, 
the 
moveable 
may 
move 
with 
different 
motions; 
and 
that 
therefore 
the 
terrestrial 
Globe 
having 
no 
flexures, 
it 
cannot 
have 
those 
three 
motions 
which 
are 
ascribed 
to 
it. 
For 
if 
he 
had 
thought, 
that 
neither 
by 
help 
of 
flexures, 
it 
could 
be 
rendered 
apt 
for 
such 
motions, 
he 
would 
have 
freely 
affirmed, 
that 
the 
Globe 
could 
not 
move 
with 
three 
motions. 
Now 
granting 
this, 
I 
intreat 
you, 
It 
is 
desired 
to 
know, 
by 
means 
of 
what 
flexures 
and 
joynts 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
might 
move 
with 
three 
diverse 
motions. 
and 
by 
you, 
if 
it 
were 
possible, 
that 
Philosopher, 
Author 
of 
the 
Argument, 
to 
be 
so 
courteous 
as 
to 
teach 
me 
in 
what 
manner 
those 
flexures 
should 
be 
accommodated, 
so 
that 
those 
three 
motions 
might 
commodiously 
be 
excercised; 
and 
I 
grant 
you 
four 
or 
six 
moneths 
time 
to 
think 
of 
an 
answer. 
As 
to 
me, 
it 
seemeth 
that 
one 
principle 
onely 
may 
cause 
a 
plurality 
of 
motions 
in 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe, 
One 
only 
principle 
may 
cause 
a 
plurality 
of 
motions 
in 
the 
Earth. 
just 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
that, 
as 
I 
told 
you 
before, 
one 
onely 
principle 
with 
the 
help 
of 
various 
instruments 
produceth 
sundry 
and 
divers 
motions 
in 
living 
creatures. 
And 
as 
to 
the 
flexures 
there 
is 
no 
need 
of 
them, 
the 
motions 
being 
of 
the 
whole, 
and 
not 
of 
some 
particular 
parts; 
and 
because 
they 
are 
to 
be 
circular, 
the 
meer 
spherical 
figure 
is 
the 
mostperfectarticulationor 
flectionthatcan 
bedesired. 


SIMP. 


The 
most 
that 
ought 
to 
be 
granted 
upon 
this, 
would 
be, 
that 
it 
may 
hold 
true 
in 
one 
single 
motion, 
but 
in 
three 
different 
motions, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
and 
that 
of 
the 
Author, 
it 
is 
impossible; 
as 
he 
going 
on, 
prosecuting 
the 
objection, 
writes 
inthefollowingwords. 
Let 
ussuppose,withCopernicus,thatthe 
Earth 
moveth 
of 
its 
own 
faculty, 
and 
upon 
an 
intrinsick 
principle 
from 
West 
to 
East 
in 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
Ecliptick; 
and 
again, 
that 
it 
also 
by 
an 
intrinsick 
principle 
revolveth 
about 
its 
centre, 
from 
East 
to 
West; 
and 
for 
a 
third 
motion, 
that 
it 
of 
its 
own 
inclination 
deflecteth 
from 
North 
to 
South, 
and 
so 
back 
again. 
It 



being 
a 
continuate 
body, 
and 
not 
knit 
together 
with 
joints 
and 
flections, 
our 
fancy 
and 
our 
judgment 
will 
never 
be 
able 
to 
comprehend, 
that 
one 
and 
the 
same 
natural 
and 
indistinct 
principle, 
that 
is, 
that 
one 
and 
the 
same 
propension, 
should 
actuate 
it 
at 
the 
same 
instant 
with 
different, 
and 
as 
it 
were 
of 
contrary 
motions. 
I 
cannot 
believe 
that 
any 
one

I 
had 
thought, 
Simplicius, 
that 
you 
might 
have 
erred 
in 
reciting 
the 
words 
of 
the 
Author, 
but 
now 
I 
see 
that 
he, 
and 
that 
very 
grossely, 
deceiveth 
himself; 
and 
to 
my 
grief, 
I 
find 
that 
he 
hath 
set 
himself 
to 
oppose 
a 
position, 
which 
he 
hath 
not 
well 
understood; 
for 
these 
are 
not 
the 
motions 
which 
Copernicus 
assignes 
to 
the 
Earth. 
Where 
doth 
he 
find 
that 
Copernicus 
maketh 
the 
annual 
motion 
by 
the 
Ecliptick 
contrary 
to 
the 
motion 
about 
its 
own 
centre? 
It 
must 
needs 
be 
that 
he 
never 
read 
his 
Book, 
which 
in 
an 
hundred 
places, 
and 
in 
the 
very 
first 
Chapters 
affirmeth 
those 
motions 
to 
be 
both 
towards 
the 
same 
parts, 
that 
is 
from 
West 
to 
East. 
But 
without 
others 
telling 
him, 
ought 
he 
not 
of 
himself 
to 
comprehend, 
that 
attributing 
to 
the 
Earth 
the 
motions 
that 
are 
taken, 
one 
of 
them 
from 
the 
Sun, 
and 
the 
other 
from 
the 
primummobile,they

SIMP. 


Take 
heed 
that 
you 
do 
not 
erre 
your 
self, 
A 
subtil 
and 
withal 
simple 
argument 
against 
Copernicus. 
and 
Copernicus 
also. 
The 
Diurnal 
motion 
of 
the 
primum 
mobile, 
is 
it 
not 
from 
East 
to 
West? 
And 
the 
annual 
motion 
of 
the 
Sun 
through 
the 
Ecliptick, 
is 
it 
not 
on 
the 
contrary 
from 
West 
to 
East? 
How 
then 
can 
you 
make 
these 
motions 
being 
conferred 
on 
the 
Earth, 
of 
contraries 
to 
becomeconsistents? 


SAGR. 



Certainly, 
Simplicius 
hath 
discovered 
to 
us 
the 
original 
cause 
of 
error 
of 
this 
Philosopher;and 
inallprobability 
hewouldhave 
saidtheverysame. 


SALV. 


Now 
if 
it 
be 
in 
our 
power, 
let 
us 
at 
least 
recover 
Simplicius 
from 
this 
errour, 
who 
seeing 
the 
Stars 
in 
their 
rising 
to 
appear 
above 
the 
Oriental 
Horizon, 
will 
make 
it 
no 
difficult 
thing 
to 
understand, 
that 
in 
case 
that 
motion 
should 
not 
belong 
to 
the 
Stars, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
confesse, 
that 
the 
Horizon, 
with 
a 
contrary 
motion 
would 
go 
down; 
and 
that 
consequently 
the 
Earth 
would 
reoolve 
in 
it 
self 
a 
contrary 
way 
to 
that 
wherewith 
the 
Stars 
seem 
to 
move, 
that 
is 
from 
West 
to 
East, 
which 
is 
according 
to 
the 
order 
of 
the 
Signes 
of 
the 
Zodiack. 
As, 
in 
the 
next 
place, 
to 
the 
other 
motion, 
the 
Sun 
being 
fixed 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Zodiack, 
and 
the 
Earth 
moveable 
about 
its 
circumference, 
to 
make 
the 
Sun 
seem 
unto 
us 
to 
move 
about 
the 
said 
Zodiack, 
according 
to 
the 
order 
of 
the 
Signes, 
it 
is 
necessary, 
that 
the 
Earth 
move 
according 
to 
the 
same 
order, 
to 
the 
end 
that 
the 
Sun 
may 
seem 
to 
us 
to 
possesse 
alwayes 
that 
degree 
in 
the 
Zodiack, 
that 
is 
opposite 
to 
the 
degree 
in 
which 
we 
find 
the 
Earth; 
and 
thus 
the 
Earth 
running, 
verbi 
gratia, 
through 
Aries, 
the 
Sun 
will 
appear 
to 
run 
thorow 
Libra; 
and 
the 
Earth 
passing 
thorow 
the 
signe 
Taurus, 
the 
Sun 
will 
passe 
thorow 
Scorpio, 
and 
so 
the 
Earth 
going 
thorow 
Gemini, 
the 
Sun 
seemeth 
to 
go 
thorow 
Sagittarius; 
but 
this 
is 
moving 
both 
the 
same 
way, 
that 
is 
according 
to 
the 
order 
of 
the 
signes; 
as 
also 
was 
the 
revolution 
of 
the 
Earth 
aboutitsown 
centre. 


SIMP. 


I 
understand 
you 
very 
well, 
and 
know 
not 
what 
to 
alledge 
in 
excuse 
of 
so 
grosse 
anerror. 


SALV. 


And 
yet, 
Simplicius, 
there 
is 
one 
yet 
worse 
then 
this; 
and 
it 
is, 
that 
he 
makes 
the 
Earth 
move 
by 
the 
diurnal 
motion 
about 
its 
own 
centre 
from 
East 
to 
West; 
and 
perceives 
not 
that 
if 
this 
were 
so, 
the 
motion 
of 
twenty 
four 
hours 
appropriated 
by 
him 
to 
the 
Universe, 
would, 
in 
our 
seeming, 
proceed 
from 
WesttoEast;thequitecontrarytothatwhichwebehold.

Oh

Why

Judg 
now 
what 
pains 
this 
Antagonist 
may 
be 
thought 
to 
have 
taken 
in 
the 
Books 
of 
Copernicus, 
By 
another 
error 
it 
is 
seen 
that 
the 
Autagonist 
had 
but 
little 
studied 
Copernicus. 
if 
he 
absolutely 
invert 
the 
sense 
of 
this 
grand 
and 
principal 
Hypothesis, 
upon 
which 
is 
founded 
the 
whole 
summe 
of 
those 
things 
whereinCopernicus

or 
that 
otherwise 
we 
should 
never

of

or 
that 
the 
Criterium 
of 
Philosophy 
would 
be 
overthrown. 
Never

As 
if 
that 
nature 
had

made 
mens 
brains, 
and 
then 
disposed 
all 
things 
in 
conformity 
to 
the 
capacity 
of 
their 
intellects. 
But 
I 
incline 
rather 
to 
think 
that 
Nature 
first 
made 
the 
things 
themselves, 
as 
she 
best 
liked, 
and 
afterwards 
framed 
the 
reason 
of 
men 
capable 
of 
conceiving 
(thoughnotwithoutgreatpains) 
some 
partofhersecrets. 


SALV. 


I 
am 
of 
the 
same 
opinion. 
But 
tell 
me, 
Simplicius, 
which 
are 
these 
different 
natures, 
to 
which, 
contrary 
to 
experience 
and 
reason, 
Copernicus 
assignes 
the 
samemotionsand 
operations. 


SIMP. 


They 
are 
these. 
The 
Water, 
the 
Air, 
(which 
doubtlesse 
are 
Natures 
different 
from 
the 
Earth) 
and 
all 
things 
that 
are 
in 
those 
elements 
comprised, 
shall 
each 
of 
them 
have 
those 
three 
motions, 
which 
Copernicus 
pretends 
to 
be 
in 
the 
Terrestriall 
Globe; 
Copernicus 
erroneously 
assigneth 
the 
same 
operations 
to 
different 
natures 
and 
my 
Authour 
proceedeth 
to 
demonstrate 
Geometrically, 



that, 
according 
to 
the 
Copernican 
Doctrine, 
a 
cloud 
that 
is 
suspended 
in 
the 
Air, 
and 
that 
hangeth 
a 
long 
time 
over 
our 
heads 
without 
changing 
place, 
must 
of 
necessity 
have 
all 
those 
three 
motions 
that 
belong 
to 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe. 
The 
demonstration 
is 
this, 
which 
you 
may 
read 
your 
self, 
for 
I 
cannot 
repeatitwithoutbook. 


SALV. 


I 
shall 
not 
stand 
reading 
of 
it, 
nay 
I 
think 
it 
an 
impertinency 
in 
him 
to 
have 
inserted 
it, 
for 
I 
am 
certain, 
that 
no 
Copernican 
will 
deny 
the 
same. 
Therefore 
admitting 
him 
what 
he 
would 
demonstrate, 
let 
us 
speak 
to 
the 
objection, 
which 
in 
my 
judgment 
hath 
no 
great 
strength 
to 
conclude 
any 
thing 
contrary 
to 
the 
Copernican 
Hypothesis, 
seeing 
that 
it 
derogates 
nothing 
from 
those 
motions, 
and 
those 
operations, 
whereby 
we 
come 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
natures, 
&c. 
Answer 
me, 
I 
pray 
you, 
Simplicius: 
Those 
accidents 
wherein 
some 
things 
exactly 
concur, 
can 
they 
serve 
to 
inform 
us 
of 
the 
different 
naturesofthosethings? 


SIMP. 


No 
Sir: 
From 
commune 
accidents 
one 
cannot 
know 
different 
natures. 
nay 
rather 
the 
contrary, 
for 
from 
the 
idendity 
of 
operations 
and 
of 
accidents 
nothingcanbeinferred,butanidendityofnatures. 


SALV. 


So 
that 
the 
different 
natures 
of 
the 
Water, 
Earth, 
Air, 
and 
other 
things 
conteined 
in 
these 
Elements, 
is 
not 
by 
you 
argued 
from 
those 
operations, 
wherein 
all 
these 
Elements 
and 
their 
affixes 
agree, 
but 
from 
other 
operations; 
is 
itso? 


SIMP. 


Theverysame. 


SALV. 



So 
that 
he 
who 
should 
leave 
in 
the 
Elements 
all 
those 
motions, 
operations, 
and 
other 
accidents, 
by 
which 
their 
natures 
are 
distinguished, 
would 
not 
deprive 
us 
of 
the 
power 
of 
coming 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
them; 
although 
he 
should 
remove 
those 
operations, 
inwhich 
theyunitedly 
concur,andwhich 
for 
that 
reasonareofnouseforthedistinguishingofthosenatures. 


SIMP. 


Ithinkyourdissertation

SALV. 


Butthatthe 
Earth, 
Water,Air, 
areof 
anatureequally

immoveable 
about 
the 
centre, 
is 
it 
not 
the 
opinion 
of

self, 
Aristotle, 
Prolomy, 
and 
all 
theirsectators? 


SIMP. 


Itsonallhandsgrantedas 
anundeniabletruth. 


SALV. 


Then 
from 
this 
common 
natural 
condition 
of 
quiescence 
about 
the 
centre, 
there 
is 
no 
argument 
drawn 
of 
the 
different 
natures 
of 
these 
Elements, 
and 
things 
elementary, 
but 
that 
knowledge 
must 
be 
collected 
from 
other 
qualities 
not 
common; 
and 
therefore 
whoso 
should 
deprive 
the 
Elements 
of 
this 
common 
rest 
only, 
and 
should 
leave 
unto 
them 
all 
their 
other 
operations, 
would 
not 
in 
the 
least 
block 
up 
the 
way 
that 
leadeth 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
their 
essences. 
But 
Copernicus 
depriveth 
them 
onely 
of 
this 
common 
rest, 
and 
changeth 
the 
same 
into 
a 
common 
motion, 
leaving 
them 
gravity, 
levity, 
the 
motions 
upwards, 
downwards, 
slower, 
The 
concurrence 
of 
the 
Elements 
in 
a 
common 
motion 
importeth 
no 
more 
or 
lesse, 
than 
their 
concurrence 
in 
a 
common 
rest. 
faster, 
rarity, 
density, 
the 
qualities 
of 
hot, 
cold, 
dry, 
moist, 
and 
in 
a 
word, 
all 
things 
besides. 
Therefore 
such 
an 
absurdity, 
as 
this 
Authour 
imagineth 
to 
himself, 
is 
no 
Copernican 
position; 
nor 
doth 
the 
concurrence 
in 
an 
identity 
of 
motion 
import 
any 
more 
or 
less, 
than 
the 
concurrence 
in 
an 
identity 
of 
rest 
about 
the 
diversifying, 
or 
not 
diversifying 
of 
natures. 
Now 
tell 
us, 
iftherebeanyargumentto

SIMP. 


There 
followeth 
a 
fourth 
objection, 
taken 
from 
a 
natural 
observation, 
which 
is, 
A 
fourth 
argument 
against 
Copernicus. 
That 
bodies 
of 
the 
same 
kind, 
have 
motions 
that 
agree 
in 
kinde, 
or 
else 
they 
agree 
in 
rest. 
But 
by 
the 
Copernican 
Hypothesis, 
Bodies 
of 
the 
same 
kinde 
have 
motions 
that 
agree 
in 
kinde. 
bodies 
that 
agree 
in 
kinde, 
and 
are 
most 
semblable 
to 
one 
another, 
would 
be 
very 
discrepant, 
yea 
diametrically 
repugnant 
as 
to 
motion; 
for 
that 
Stars 
so 
like 
to 
one 
another, 
would 
be 
neverthelesse 
so 
unlike 
in 
motion, 
as 
that 
six 
Planets 
would 
perpetually 
turn 
round; 
but 
the 
Sun 
and 
all 
the 
fixeed 
Stars 
would 
stand 
perpetuallyimmoveable. 


SALV. 


The 
forme 
of 
the 
argument 
appeareth 
good; 
but 
yet 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
application 
or 
matter 
is 
defective: 
and 
if 
the 
Authour 
will 
but 
persist 
in 
his 
assumption, 
the 
consequence 
shall 
make 
directly 
against 
him. 
The 
Argument 
runs 
thus; 
Amongst 
mundane 
bodies, 
From 
the 
Earths 
obscurity, 
and 
the 
splendour 
of 
the 
Sun, 
and 
fixed 
Stars, 
is 
argued, 
that 
it 
is 
moveable, 
and 
they 
immoveable. 
six 
there 
are 
that 
do 
perpetually 
move, 
and 
they 
are 
the 
six 
Planets; 
of 
the 
rest, 
that 
is, 
of 
the 
Earth, 
Sun, 
and 
fixed 
Stars, 
it 
is 
disputable 
which 
of 
them 
moveth, 
and 
which 
stands 
still, 
it 
being 
necessary, 
that 
if 
the 
Earth 
stand 
still, 
the 
Sun 
and 
fixed 
Stars 
do 
move; 
and 
it 
being 
also 
possible, 
that 
the 
Sun 
and 
fixed 
Stars 
may 
stand 
immoveable, 
in 
case 
the 
Earth 
should 
move: 
the 
matter 
of 
fact 
in 
dispute 
is, 
to 
which 
of 
them 
we 
may 
with 
most 
convenience 
ascribe 
motion, 
and 
to 
which 
rest. 
Natural 
reason 
dictates, 
that 
motion 
ought 
to 
be 
assigned 
to 
the 
bodies, 
which 
in 
kind 
and 
essence 
most 
agree 
with 
those 
bodies 
which 
do 
undoubtedly 
move, 
and 
rest 
to 
those 
which 
most 
dissent 
from 
them; 
and 
in 
regard 
that 
an 
eternal 
rest 
and 
perpetual 
motion 
are 
most 
different, 
it 
is 
manifest, 
that 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
body 
always 
moveableoughttobe 
mostdifferentfromthebodyalwayesstable. 
Therefore, 
in 
regard 
that 
we 
are 
dubious 
of 
motion 
and 
rest, 
let 
us 
enquire, 
whether 
by 
the 
help 
of 
some 
other 
eminent 
affection, 
we 
may 
discover, 
which 
most 
agreeth 
with 
the 
bodies 
certainly 
moveable, 
either 
the 
Earth, 
or 
the 
Sun 
and 
fixed 
Stars. 
But 
see 
how 
Nature, 
in 
favour 
of 
our 
necessity 
and 
desire, 
presents 
us 
with 
two 
eminent 
qualities, 
and 
no 
less 
different 
than 
motion 
and 
rest, 
and 
they 
are 
light 
and 
darkness, 
to 
wit, 
the 
being 
by 
nature 
most 
bright, 



and 
the 
being 
obscure, 
and 
wholly 
deprived 
of 
light: 
the 
bodies 
therefore 
adorned

an 
internal 
and 
eternal 
splendour,

most 
different 
in

from

The 
Earth 
is 
deprived 
of 
light, 
the 
Sun 
is 
most 
splendid 
in 
it 
self, 
and 
so 
are 
the 
fixed 
Stars. 
The 
six 
Planets 
do 
absolutely 
want 
light, 
as 
the 
Earth; 
therefore 
their 
essence 
agreeth 
with 
the 
Earth, 
and 
differeth 
from 
the

Therefore

the

amongst

I 
say, 
of 
such 
nobility, 
by 
the 
confession 
of 
every

and 
Copernicus 
himself, 
who 
affirmeth 
them 
to 
beordinate,

disposed 
in 
a 
perfect 
constitution,

removeth 
from 
them 
all 
inconstancy 
of 
vertue 
amongst, 
these 
bodies, 
I 
say 
once 
more, 
so 
pure, 
that 
is

much 
properer 
a

more 
with

with 
God

it,

It’s 
true

Again 
if 
this

infer 
the 
disparity 
of

between 
the

Celestial

from 
the 
incorruptibility 
of 
them, 
and 
the 
corruptibility 
of 
it 
in 
the 
method 
of 
Aristotle, 
from 
which 
disparity 
he 
concludeth 
motion

and 
the

he 
will 
flatter 
himself 
with 
a 
Paralogisme, 
supposing 
that 
which 
is 
in 
question; 
for 
Aristotle 
inferreth 
the 
incorruptibility 
of 
Celestial 
bodies 
from 
motion, 
which 
is 
in 
dispute, 
whether 
it 
belongeth 
to 
them 
or 
to 
the 
Earth. 
Of 
the 
vanity 
of 
these 
Rhetorical 
Illations 
enough 
hath 
been 
spoken. 
It 
seemeth 
a 
folly 
to 
affirm 
the 
Earth 
to 
be 
without 
the 
Heavens. 
And 
what 
can 
be 
more 
fond, 
than 
to 
say, 
that 
the 
Earth 
and 
Elements 
are 
banished 
and 
sequestred 
from 
the 
Celestial 
Spheres, 
and 
confined 
within 
the 
Lunar

Is, 
not 
then 
the

the 
Celestial

to

Its 
a 
new 
way 
to 
separate 
the 
pure

the 
impure, 
and 
the 
sick 
from

to

that 
theLazeretto.

ought 
to 
have 
been 
removed 
as 
far 
off 
as 
was 
possible. 
Copernicus 
admireth 
the 
disposition 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Universe, 
for 
that 
God 
hath 
constituted 
the

There 
is 
the 
sixth 
and 
last 
argument; 
A 
sixth 
argument 
against 
Copernicus, 
taken 
from 
animals, 
who 
have 
need 
of 
rest▪ 
though 
their 
motion 
be 
natural. 
wherein 
he 
maketh 
it 
a 
very 
improbale 
thing. 
[That 
a 
corruptible 
and 
dissipable 
body 
should 
move 
with 
a 
perpetual 
and 
regular 
motion; 
and 
this 
be 
confirmeth 
with 
the 
example 
of 
living 
creatures, 
which 
moving 
with 
a 
motion 



natural 
to 
them, 
yet 
grow 
weary, 
and 
have 
need 
of 
repose 
to 
restore 
their 
strength. 
] 
But 
what 
hath 
this 
motion 
to 
do 
with 
that 
of 
the 
Earth, 
that 
in 
comparision 
to 
theirs 
is 
immense? 
Besides, 
to 
make 
it 
move 
with 
three 
motions 
that 
run 
and 
draw 
several 
wayes: 
Who 
would 
ever 
assert 
such 
Paradoxes, 
unlesse 
he 
had 
sworn 
to 
be 
their 
defender? 
Nor 
doth 
that 
avail 
in 
this 
case,whichCopernicusalledgeth,thatbyreasonthismotionisnaturalto 
the 
Earth 
and 
not 
violent, 
it 
worketh 
contrary 
effects 
to 
violent 
motions; 
and 
that 
those 
things 
dissolve 
and 
cannot 
long 
subsist, 
to 
which 
impulse 
is 
conferred, 
but 
those 
so 
made 
by 
nature 
do 
continue 
in 
their 
perfect 
disposure; 
this 
answer 
sufficeth 
not, 
I 
say, 
for 
it 
is 
overthrown 
by 
that 
of 
ours. 
For 
the 
animal 
is 
a 
natural 
body, 
and 
not 
made 
by 
art, 
and 
its 
motion 
is 
natural, 
deriving 
it 
self 
from 
the 
soul, 
that 
is, 
from 
an 
intrinsick 
principle; 
and 
that 
motion 
is 
violent, 
whose 
beginning 
is 
without, 
and 
on 
which 
the 
thing 
moved 
conferreth 
nothing; 
however, 
if 
the 
animal 
continueth 
its 
motion 
any 
long 
time, 
it 
grows 
weary, 
and 
also 
dyeth, 
if 
it 
obstinately 
strive 
to 
persist 
therein. 
You 
see 
then 
that 
in 
nature 
we 
meet 
on 
all 
sides 
with 
notions 
contrary 
to 
the 
Copernican 
Hypothesis, 
and 
none 
in 
favour 
of 
it. 
And 
for 
that 
I 
have 
nothing 
more 
wherein 
to 
take 
the 
part 
of 
this 
Opponent, 
hear 
what 
he 
produceth 
against 
Keplerus 
(with 
whom 
he 
disputeth) 
upon 
that 
argument, 
which 
the 
said 
Kepler 
bringeth 
against 
those 
who 
think 
it 
an 
inconvenient, 
nay 
impossible 
thing, 
to 
augment 
the 
Starry 
Sphere 
immensely, 
as 
the 
Copernican 
Hypothesis 
requireth. 
Kepler 
therefore 
instanceth, 
saying: 
Difficilius 
est, 
An 
argument 
from 
Kepler 
in 
favour 
of 
Copernicus.

[Which 
makes 
this 
English. 
] 
Its 
harder 
to 
stretch 
the 
accident 
beyond 
the 
model 
of 
the 
subject 
than 
to 
augment 
the 
subject 
without 
the 
accident. 
Copernicus 
hath 
more 
probability 
on 
his 
side, 
who 
encreaseth 
the 
Orb 
of 
the 
fixed 
Stars 
without 
motion, 
than 
Ptolomy 
who 
augmenteth 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
fixed 
Stars 
to 
an 
immense 
degree 
of 
velocity. 
Which 
objection 
the 
Author 
answereth, 
The 
Author 
of 
theAnti-Tycho 
opposethKepler. 
wondering 
how 
muchKepler 
deceived 
himself, 
in 
saying, 
that 
in 
the 
Ptolomaick 
Hypothesis 
the 
motion 
encreaseth 
beyond 
the 
model 
of 
the 
subject, 
for 
in 
his 
judgment 
it 
doth 
not 
encrease, 
save 
onely 
in 
conformity 
to 
the 
model, 
and 
that 
according 
to 
its 
encreasement, 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
motion 
is 
augmented. 
The 
velocity 
of 
the 
circular 
motion 
increaseth, 
according 
to 
the 
encrease 
of 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 



circle. 
Which 
he 
proveth 
by 
supposing 
a 
machine 
to 
be 
framed, 
that 
maketh 
one 
revolution 
in 
twenty 
four 
hours, 
which 
motion 
shall 
be 
called 
most 
slow; 
afterwards 
supposing 
its 
semidiameter 
to 
be 
prolonged, 
as 
far 
as 
to 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
Sun, 
its 
extreme 
will 
equal 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
Sun; 
and 
it 
being 
continued 
out 
unto 
the 
Starry 
Sphere, 
it 
will 
equal 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
fixed 
Stars, 
though 
in 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
machine 
it 
be 
very 
slow. 
Now 
applying 
this 
consideration 
of 
the 
machine 
to 
the 
Starry 
Sphere, 
let 
us 
imagine 
any 
point 
in 
its 
semidiameter, 
as 
neer 
to 
the 
centre 
as 
is 
the 
semidiameter 
of 
the 
machine; 
the 
same 
motion 
that 
in 
the 
Starry 
Sphere 
is 
exceeding 
swift, 
shall 
in 
that 
point 
be 
exceeding 
slow; 
But 
the 
great 
magnitude 
of 
the 
body 
is 
that 
which 
maketh 
it 
of 
exceeding 
slow, 
to 
become 
exceeding 
swift, 
although 
it 
continueth 
still 
the 
same, 
and 
thus 
the 
velocity 
encreaseth, 
not 
beyond 
the 
model 
of 
the 
subject, 
but 
rather 
according 
to 
it, 
and 
toitsmagnitude;verydifferently 
from 
the 
imagination 
ofKepler. 


SALV. 


I 
do 
not 
believe 
that 
this 
Author 
hath 
entertained 
so 
mean 
and 
poor 
a 
conceit 
of 
Kepler, 
as 
to 
perswade 
himself 
that 
he 
did 
not 
understand, 
that 
the 
highest 
term 
of 
a 
line 
drawn 
from 
the 
centre 
unto 
the 
Starry 
Sphere, 
moveth 
more 
swiftly 
than 
a 
point 
of 
the 
same 
line 
taken 
within 
a 
yard 
or 
two 
of 
the 
centre. 
And 
therefore 
of 
necessity 
he 
must 
have 
conceived 
and 
comprehended 
that 
the 
mind 
and 
intention 
of 
Kepler 
was 
to 
have 
said, 
An 
explanation 
of 
the 
true 
sense 
of 
Kepler 
and 
his 
fence. 
that 
it 
is 
lesse 
inconvenient 
to 
encrease 
an 
immoveable 
body 
to 
an 
extraordinary 
magnitude, 
than 
to 
ascribe 
an 
extraordinary 
velocity 
to 
a 
body, 
though 
very 
bigge, 
having 
regard 
to 
the 
model, 
that 
is 
to 
the 
gauge, 
and 
to 
the 
example 
of 
other 
natural 
bodies; 
in 
which 
we 
see, 
that 
the 
distance 
from 
the 
centre 
encreasing, 
the 
velocity 
diminisheth; 
that 
is, 
that 
the 
periods 
of 
their 
circulations 
take 
up 
longer 
times. 
The 
greatnesse 
and 
smalnesse 
of 
the 
body 
make 
a 
differeuce 
in 
motion 
and 
not 
in 
rest. 
But 
in 
rest 
which 
is 
not 
capable 
of 
augmentation 
or 
diminution, 
the 
grandure 
or 
smalnesse 
of 
the 
body 
maketh 
no 
difference. 
So 
that 
if 
the 
answer 
of 
the 
Author 
would 
be 
directed 
against 
the 
argument 
of 
Kepler, 
it 
is 
necessary, 
that 
that 
Author 
doth 
hold, 
that 
to 
the 
movent 
principle 
its 
one 
and 
the 
same 
to 
move 
in 
the 
same 
time 
a 
body 
very 
small, 
or 
very 
immense, 
in 
regard 
that 
the 
augmentation 
of 
velocity 
inseparably 
attends 
the 
augmentation 
of 
the 
masse. 
The 
order 
of 
nature 
is 
to 
make 
the 
lesser 
Orbs 
to 
circulate 
in 



shorter 
times, 
and 
the 
bigger 
in 
longer 
times. 
But 
this 
again 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
Architectonical 
rule 
of 
nature, 
which 
doth 
in 
the 
lesser 
Spheres, 
as 
we 
see 
in 
the 
Planets, 
and 
most 
sensibly 
in 
the 
Medicean 
Stars, 
observe 
to 
make 
the 
lesser 
Orbs 
to 
circulate 
in 
shorter 
times: 
Whence 
the 
time 
of 
Saturns 
revolution 
is 
longer 
than 
all 
the 
times 
of 
the 
other 
lesser 
Spheres, 
it 
being 
thirty 
years; 
now 
the 
passing 
from 
this 
to 
a 
Sphere 
very 
much 
bigger, 
and 
to 
make 
it 
move 
in 
24. 
hours, 
may 
very 
well 
be 
said 
to 
exceed 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
model. 
So 
that 
if 
we 
would 
but 
attentively 
consider 
it, 
the 
Authors 
answer 
opposeth 
not 
the 
intent 
and 
sense 
of 
the 
argument, 
but 
the 
expressing 
and 
manner 
of 
delivering 
of 
it; 
where 
again 
the 
Author 
is 
injurious, 
and 
cannot 
deny 
but 
that 
he 
artificially 
dissembled 
his 
understanding 
of 
the 
words, 
that 
he 
might 
charge 
Kepler 
with 
grosse 
ignorance; 
but 
the 
imposture 
was 
so 
very 
dull 
and 
obvions, 
that 
he 
could 
not 
with 
all 
his 
craft 
alter 
the 
opinion 
which 
Kepler 
hath 
begot 
of 
his 
Doctrine 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
all 
the 
Learned. 
As 
in 
the 
next 
place, 
to 
the 
instance 
against 
the 
perpetual 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth, 
taken 
from 
the 
impossibility 
of 
its 
moving 
long 
without 
wearinesse, 
in 
regard 
that 
living 
creatures 
themselves, 
which 
yet 
move 
naturally,

Excuse 
me, 
Salviatus, 
this 
that 
I 
say 
is 
not 
so 
absolutely 
besides 
the 
business, 
as 
you 
perhaps 
make 
it; 
for 
a 
motion 
that 
serveth 
instead 
of 
rest, 
and 



removeth 
weariness 
from 
a 
body 
tired 
with 
travail, 
may 
much 
more 
easily 
serve 
to 
prevent 
the 
coming 
of 
that 
weariness, 
Animals 
would 
not 
grow 
weary 
of 
their 
motion, 
proceeding 
as 
that 
which 
is 
assigned 
to 
the 
terrestrial 
Globe. 
like 
as 
preventive 
remedies 
are 
more 
easie 
than 
curative. 
And 
I 
hold 
for 
certain, 
that 
if 
the 
motion 
of 
animals 
should 
proceed 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
this 
that 
is 
ascribed 
to 
the 
Earth, 
theywouldnever 
growweary; 
Seeing 
that 
the 
weariness 
of 
the 
living 
creature, 
deriveth 
it 
self, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
from 
the 
imployment 
of 
but 
one 
part 
alone 
in 
the 
moving 
of 
its 
self, 
The 
cause 
of 
the 
wearinesse 
of 
animals. 
and 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
body; 
as 
v. 
g. 
in 
walking, 
the 
thighs 
and 
the 
legs 
onely 
are 
imployed 
for 
carrying 
themselves 
and 
all 
the 
rest: 
on 
the 
contrary, 
you 
see 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
heart 
to 
be 
as 
it 
were 
indefatigable, 
because 
it 
moveth 
it 
self 
alone. 
Besides, 
I 
know 
not 
how 
true 
it 
may 
be, 
The 
motion 
of 
an 
animal 
is 
rather 
to 
be 
called 
violent 
than 
natural. 
that 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
animal 
is 
natural, 
and 
not 
rather 
violent: 
nay, 
I 
believe 
that 
one 
may 
truly 
say, 
that 
the 
soul 
naturally 
moveth 
the 
members 
of 
an 
animal 
with 
a 
motion 
preternatural, 
for 
if 
the 
motion 
upwards 
is 
preternatural 
to 
grave 
bodies, 
the 
lifting 
up 
of 
the 
legs, 
and 
the 
thighs, 
which 
are 
grave 
bodies, 
in 
walking, 
cannot 
be 
done 
without 
violence, 
and 
therefore 
not 
without 
labour 
to 
the 
mover. 
The 
climbing 
upwards 
by 
a 
ladder 
carrieth 
the 
grave 
body 
contrary 
to 
its 
natural 
inclination 
upwards, 
from 
whence 
followeth 
weariness, 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
bodies 
natural 
aversness 
to 
that 
motion: 
but 
in 
moving 
a 
moveable 
with 
a 
motion, 
to 
which 
it 
hath 
no 
aversion, 
what 
lassitude, 
The 
strength 
diminisheth 
not, 
where 
it 
is 
not 
imployed. 
what 
diminution 
of 
vertue 
and 
strength 
need 
we 
fear 
in 
the 
mover? 
and 
how 
should

SIMP. 


They 
are 
the 
contrary 
motions 
wherewith 
the 
Earth 
is 
pretended 
to 
move,

SAGR. 


It 
hath 
been 
said 
already, 
that 
they 
are 
no 
wise 
contraries, 
and 
that 
herein 
the 
Authour 
is 
extteamly 
deceived, 
so 
that 
the 
whole 
strength 
of 
the 
argument 
recoileth 
upon 
the 
Opponent 
himself, 
The 
argument 
of 
Chramontius, 
upon 
himself. 
whilst 
he 
will 
make 
the 
First 
Mover 
to 
hurry 
along 
with 
it 
all 
the 
inferiour 
Spheres, 
contrary 
to 
the 
motion 
which 
they 
themselves 
at 
the 
same 



time 
exercise. 
It 
belongs 
therefore 
to 
the 
Primum 
Mobile 
to 
grow 
weary, 
which 
besides 
the 
moving 
of 
its 
self 
is 
made 
to 
carry 
so 
many 
other 
Spheres, 
and 
which 
also 
strive 
against 
it 
with 
a 
contrary 
motion. 
So 
that 
the 
ultimate 
conclusion 
that 
the 
Authour 
inferred, 
saying, 
that 
discoursing 
of 
the 
effects 
of 
Nature, 
a 
man 
alwayes 
meets 
with 
things 
that 
favour 
the 
opinion 
of 
Aristotle 
and 
Ptolomy, 
and 
never 
any 
one 
that 
doth 
not 
interfer 
with 
Copernicus, 
stands 
in 
need 
of 
great 
consideration; 
and 
it 
is 
better 
to 
say, 
that 
one 
of 
these 
two 
Hypotheses 
being 
true, 
and 
the 
other 
necessarily 
false, 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
a 
man 
should 
ever 
be 
able 
to 
finde 
any 
argument, 
experience, 
or 
right 
reason, 
in 
favour 
of 
that 
which 
is 
false, 
True 
Propositions 
meet 
with 
many 
conclusive 
arguments, 
so 
do 
not 
the 
false. 
like 
as 
to 
the 
truth 
none 
of 
these 
things 
can 
be 
repugnant. 
Vast 
difference, 
therefore, 
must 
needs 
be 
found 
between 
the 
reasons 
and 
arguments 
produced 
by 
the 
one 
and 
other 
party, 
for 
and 
against 
these 
two 
opinions, 
the 
force 
of 
which 
I 
leave 
you 
your 
self 
to 
judgeof,Simplicius. 


SALV. 


But 
you, 
Sagredus, 
being 
transported 
by 
the 
velocity 
of 
your 
wit, 
have 
taken 
my 
words 
out 
of 
my 
mouth, 
whilst 
I 
was 
about 
to 
say 
something, 
touching 
this 
last 
argument 
of 
the 
Author; 
and 
although 
you 
have 
more 
then 
sufficiently 
refuted 
him, 
yet 
neverthelesse 
I 
will 
adde 
somewhat, 
which 
then 
ran 
in 
my 
minde. 
He 
proposeth 
it 
as 
a 
thing 
very 
unlikely, 
that 
a 
body 
dissipable 
and 
corruptible, 
as 
the 
Earth, 
should 
perpetually 
move 
with 
a 
regular 
motion, 
especially 
for 
that 
we 
see 
living 
creatures 
in 
the 
end 
to 
grow 
weary, 
and 
to 
stand 
in 
need 
of 
rest: 
and 
the 
improbability 
is 
increased, 
in 
that 
the 
said 
motion 
is 
required 
to 
be 
of 
velocity 
incomparable 
and 
immense, 
in 
respect 
to 
that 
of 
animals. 
Now, 
I 
cannot 
see 
why 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
Earth 
should,atpresent, 
trouble 
it;solong 
asthat 
ofthestarry 
Spheresovery 
much 
bigger 
doth 
not 
occasion 
in 
it 
any 
disturbance 
more 
considerable, 
than 
that 
which 
the 
velocity 
of 
a 
machine, 
that 
in 
24 
hours 
maketh 
but 
one 
sole 
revolution, 
produceth 
in 
the 
same. 
If 
the 
being 
of 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
Earths 
conversion, 
according 
to 
the 
model 
of 
that 
machine, 
inferreth 
things 
of 
no 
greater 
moment 
than 
that, 
let 
the 
Author 
cease 
to 
fear 
the 
Earths 
growing 
weary; 
for 
that 
not 
one 
of 
the 
most 
feeble 
and 
slow-pac’t 
animals, 
no 
not 
a 
Chamaeleon 
would 
tire

more

four 
or 
five 
yards 
in 
24

but 
if 
he 
please 
to 
consider 
the 



velocity 
to 
be 
no 
longer, 
Weariness 
more

in 
relation 
to 
the 
model 
of 
the 
machine, 
but 
absolutely, 
and 
inasmuch 
as 
the 
moveable 
in 
24 
hours 
is 
to 
pass 
a 
very 
great 
space, 
he 
ought 
to 
shew 
himself 
so 
much 
more 
reserved 
in 
granting 
it 
to 
the 
starry 
Sphere, 
which 
with 
a 
velocity 
incomparably 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
the 
Earth 
is 
to 
carry 
along 
with 
it 
a 
thousand 
bodies, 
each 
much 
bigger 
than 
the 
TerrestrialGlobe. 


Here 
it 
remains 
for 
us 
to 
see 
the 
proofs, 
whereby 
the 
Authour 
concludes 
the 
new 
stars 
Anno 
1572. 
and 
Anno 
1604. 
to 
be 
sublunary, 
and 
not 
coelestial, 
as 
the 
Astronomers 
of 
those 
times 
were 
generally 
perswaded; 
an 
enterprize 
very 
greatcertainly; 
butIhave 
considered,thatitwillbe 
better,in 
regard 
theBook 
is 
new 
and 
long,by 
reason 
of 
itsmany 
calculations,that 
between 
this 
evening 
and 
to 
morrow 
morning 
I 
make 
them 
as 
plain 
as 
I 
can, 
and 
so 
meeting 
you 
again 
to 
morrow 
to 
continue 
our 
wonted 
conferences, 
give 
you 
a 
brief 
of 
what 
I 
shall 
observe 
therein; 
and 
if 
we 
have 
time 
left, 
we 
will 
say 
something 
of 
the 
Annual 
motion 
ascribed 
to 
the 
Earth. 
In 
the 
mean 
time, 
if 
either 
of 
you, 
and 
Simplicius 
in 
particular, 
hath 
any 
thing 
to 
say 
more, 
touching 
what 
relates 
to 
the 
Diurnal 
motion, 
at 
large 
examined 
by 
me, 
we 
have 
a 
little 
time 
still 
leftto 
treatthereof. 


SIMP. 


I 
have 
no 
more 
to 
say, 
unlesse 
it 
be 
this, 
that 
the 
discourses 
that 
this 
day 
have 
falne 
under 
our 
debate, 
have 
appeared 
to 
me 
fraught 
with 
very 
acute 
and 
ingenious 
notions, 
alledged 
on 
Copernicus 
his 
side, 
in 
confirmation 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth, 
but 
yet 
I 
find 
not 
my 
self 
perswaded 
to 
believe 
it; 
for 
in 
short, 
the 
things 
that 
have 
been 
said 
conclude 
no 
more 
but 
this, 
that 
the 
reasons 
for 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
Earth 
are 
not 
necessary; 
but 
all 
the 
while 
no 
demonstration 
hath 
been 
produced 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
that 
doth 
necessarily 
convinceandproveitsmobility. 


SALV. 


I 
never 
undertook, 
Simplicius, 
to 
remove 
you 
from 
that 
your 
opinion; 
much 
less 
dare 
I 
presume 
to 
determine 
definitively 
in 
this 
controversie: 
it 
onely 
was, 
and 
still 
shall 
be 
in 
the 
ensuing 
disputations 
my 
intent, 
to 
make 
it 
appear 
to 
you, 
that 
those 
who 
have 
thought 
that 
most 
swift 
motion 
of 
24 
hours 
doth 



belong 
to 
the 
Earth 
alone, 
and 
not 
to 
the 
Universe, 
the 
Earth 
onely 
excluded, 
were 
not 
induced 
to 
believe, 
that 
so 
it 
might 
and 
ought 
to 
do 
out 
of 
any 
blind 
perswasion; 
but 
that 
they 
did 
very 
well 
see, 
try, 
and 
examine 
the 
reasons 
on 
the 
contrary 
side, 
and 
also 
not 
slightly 
answer 
them. 
With 
the 
same 
intention, 
if 
it 
stand 
with 
your 
liking, 
and 
that 
of 
Sagredus, 
we 
may 
passe 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
that 
other 
motion; 
first, 
by 
Aristarchus 
Samius, 
and 
afterwards 
by 
Nicholaus 
Copernicus 
ascribed 
to 
the 
said 
Terrestrial 
Globe, 
which 
is, 
as, 
I 
believe, 
you 
have 
heretofore 
heard, 
made 
under 
the 
Zodiack 
within 
the 
space 
of 
a 
year 
about 
the 
Sun, 
immoveably 
placed 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
thesaidZodiack. 


SIMP. 


The 
disquisition 
is 
so 
great, 
and 
so 
noble, 
that 
I 
shall 
gladly 
hearken 
to 
the 
discussion 
thereof, 
perswading 
my 
self 
that 
I 
shall 
hear 
what 
ever 
can 
be 
said 
of 
that 
matter. 
And 
I 
will 
afterwards 
by 
my 
self, 
according 
to 
my 
usual 
custome, 
make 
more 
deliberate 
reflexions 
upon 
what 
hath 
been, 
and 
is 
to 
be 
spoken; 
and 
if 
I 
should 
gain 
no 
more 
but 
this, 
it 
will 
be 
no 
small 
benefit 
that

SAGR. 


THE 
great 
desire 
wherewith 
I 
have 
expected 
your 
coming, 
that 
I 
might 
hear 
the 
novel 
conceits 
touching 
the 
annual 
conversion 
of 
this 
our 
Globe, 
hath 
made 
me 
think 
the 
houres 
of 
the 
last 
night, 
and 
those 
of 
this 
morning 
very 
tedious, 
although 
I 
spent 
them 
not 
idly, 
but 
lying 
awake 
I 
imployed 
a 
good 
part 
thereof 
in 
ruminating 
upon 
our 
yesterdayes 
discourses, 
weighing 
the 
reasons 
alledged 
by 
both 
parties, 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
two 
contrary 
Hypotheses, 
that 
of 
Aristotle 
and 
Ptolomy, 
and 
this 
of 
Aristarchus, 
and 
Copernicus. 
And 
really 
methinks, 
that 
which 
ever 
of 
these 
parties 
have 
been 
deceived, 
they 
are 
worthy 
of 
excuse, 
so 
specious 
and 
valid 
in 
appearance 
are 
the 
reasons 
that 
may 
have 
perswaded 
them 
either 
way; 
though 
neverthelesse 
we 
do 
for 
the 
most 
part 
close 
with 
those 
produced 
by 
the 
grave 
Authours 
first 
above 
mentioned. 
But 
albeit 
that 
the 
Peripatetick 
Hypothesis, 
by 
reason 
of 
its 
antiquity, 
hath 
had 
many 
followers 
and 
fautors, 
and 
the 
other 
very 
few; 
first, 
for 
its 
obscurity, 
and 
next, 
for 
its 
novelty, 
yet 
methinks 
I 
discover 
amongst 
those 
many, 
and 
particularly 
amongst 
the 
modernes 
some, 
who 
for 
the 
support 
of 
the 
opinion 
by 
them 
esteemed 
true, 
have 
introduced 
other 
reasons 
sufficientlychildish,Icouldsayridiculous. 


SALV. 


I 
have 
met 
with 
the 
like, 
and 
so 
much 
worse 
than 
yours, 
Some 
in 
arguing 
first 
fix 
in 
their 
minds 
the 
conclusion 
beleeved 
by 
them, 
and 
then 
adapt 
their 
reasons 
to 
that. 
that 
I 
blush 
to 
rehearse 
them, 
not 
so 
much 
to 
spare 
the 
fame 
of 
their 
Authours, 
the 
names 
of 
whom 
might 
be 
perpetually 
concealed, 
as 
because 
I 
am 
ashamed 
so 
much 
to 
stain 
the 
honour 
of 
mankinde. 
In 
observing 
of 
these 
men, 
I 
have 
found 
that 
some 
there 
are 
who 
preposterously 
reasoning, 
first 
stablish 
the 
conclusion 
in 
their 
fancy, 
and 
(either 
because 
it 
is 
their 
own, 
or 
else 
belongs 
to 
a 
person 
whom 
they 
much 
confide 
in) 
so 
firmly 
imprint 
it 
in 
their 
opinions, 
that 
it 
is 
altogether 
impossible 
ever 
wholly 
to 
efface 
it: 
and 
those 
reasons 
which 
they 
themselves 
stumble 
upon, 
or 
which 
they 
hear 
others 
to 
alledge 
in 
confirmation 
of 
the 
conceit 
entertained, 
though 
never 
so 
simple 
and 
insipid, 
instantly 
find 
credit 
and 
applause 
with 
them: 
but 
on 
the 
contrary, 



those 
which 
are 
brought 
against 
their 
opinion, 
though 
ingenuous 
and 
concluding, 
they 
receive 
not 
only 
with 
nauseating, 
but 
with 
disdain 
and 
bitter 
indignation, 
yea, 
you 
shall 
have 
one 
of 
these 
so 
inraged, 
as 
that 
he 
will 
not 
be 
backward 
to 
try 
all 
wayes 
to 
suppress 
and 
silence 
their 
adversaries: 
and 
of 
this 
I 
myselfhavehadsomeexperience. 


SAGR. 


Indeed 
these 
men 
deduce 
not 
the 
conclusion 
from 
the 
premises, 
nor 
confirme 
them 
with 
reasons, 
but 
accomodate, 
or 
to 
say 
better, 
discommodate 
and 
distort 
the 
premises 
and 
arguments 
to 
make 
them 
speak 
in 
favour 
of 
their 
preassumed 
and 
pertinacious 
conclusions. 
It 
is 
not 
good 
therefore 
to 
contract 
familiarity 
with 
these 
men; 
and 
the 
rather, 
for 
that 
their 
conversation 
is 
not 
only 
unpleasant, 
but 
also 
dangerous. 
Yet 
let 
us 
continue 
our 
conference 
with 
Simplicius 
however, 
whom 
I 
have 
known 
this 
long 
while 
for 
a 
man 
of 
great 
ingenuity; 
and 
altogether 
void 
of 
malice: 
besides 
he 
is 
well 
verst 
in 
the 
Peripatetick 
Doctrine; 
so 
that 
I 
may 
assure 
my 
self, 
that 
what 
shall 
not 
fall 
within 
the 
reach 
of 
his 
reason 
for 
the 
support 
of 
the 
Aristotelian 
Hypothesis, 
will 
not 
easily 
be 
found 
out 
by 
others. 
But 
see 
yonder 
he 
comes, 
quite 
out 
of 
winde, 
whose 
company 
we 
have 
so 
long 
desired: 
we 
were 
just 
now 
speaking

SIMP. 


You 
must 
not 
blame 
me, 
but 
Neptune, 
for 
this 
my 
long 
stay; 
which 
in 
the 
ebbe 
of 
this 
mornings 
tide 
hath 
in 
a 
manner 
drain’d 
away 
the 
waters, 
for 
the 
Gondola 
that 
brought 
me, 
being 
entered 
not 
far 
from 
hence 
into 
a 
certain 
Channel, 
wanting 
depth, 
where 
I 
was 
stranded, 
and 
forced 
to 
stay 
there 
more 
than 
a 
full 
hour, 
in 
expecting 
the 
return 
of 
the 
tide: 
and 
there 
waiting 
in 
this 
manner, 
without 
being 
able 
to 
get 
out 
of 
the 
boat, 
which 
on 
a 
sudden 
ran 
a 
ground, 
The 
motion 
of 
the 
water 
in 
ebbing 
and 
flowing 
not 
interrupted 
by 
rest. 
I 
observed 
a 
certain 
accident, 
which 
to 
me 
seemed 
very 
strange; 
and 
it 
was 
this, 
that 
in 
the 
waters 
ebbing 
I 
saw 
it 
retreat 
very 
fast 
by 
several 
small 
rivolets, 
the 
ouze 
being 
in 
many 
places 
discovered, 
and 
whilst 
I 
stood 
looking 
upon 
this 
effect, 
I 
saw 
this 
motion 
in 
an 
instant 
to 
cease, 
and 
without 
a 
minutes 
interval 
the 
same 
water 
to 
begin 
to 
return 
back 
again, 
and 
the 
tide 
from 
ebbing 
to 
become 
young 
flood, 
without 
standing 
still 
a 
moment: 
an 
effect 
thataslongasIhavedweltinVenice,I

It 
is 
very 
much, 
that 
you 
should 
be 
left 
thus 
on 
ground, 
amongst 
small 
Channels; 
in 
which 
rivolets, 
as

very 
little

the

This 
I 
know 
very 
well, 
but 
I 
should 
have 
thought, 
that 
between 
the 
ultimate 
terme 
of 
ebbing, 
and 
the 
first 
beginnng 
to

there 
should 
have 
interposed

This 
will 
appear 
unto 
you, 
if 
you 
cast 
your 
eye 
upon 
the 
bank 
or 
piles, 
where 
these 
mutations 
are 
made 
perpendicularly, 
but 
not 
that 
there 
is 
any 
real 
time 
ofcessation. 


SIMP. 


Idid 
think,thatbecause 
these 
two 
motionswere 
contrary,there 
ought 
to 
be 
in 
the

between

some 
kind 
of

I 
very 
well 
remember 
this 
place: 
but 
I 
bear 
in 
minde 
also, 
that 
when 
I 
read 
Philosophy, 
I 
was 
not 
thorowly 
satisfied 
with 
Aristotles 
demonstration; 
but 
that 
I 
had 
many 
experiments 
on 
the 
contrary, 
which 
I 
could 
still 
rehearse 
unto 
you, 
but 
I 
am 
unwilling 
to 
sally 
out 
into 
any 
other 
digressions, 
we 
being 
met 
here

And 
yet 
we 
may 
with 
convenience, 
if 
not-interrupt 
them, 
at 
least 
prolong 
them 
very 
much, 
for 
returning 
yesterday 
home, 
I 
set 
my 
self 
to 
read 
the 
Tractate 
of 
Conclusions, 
where 
I 
find 
Demonstrations 
against 
this 
annual 
motion 
ascribed 
to 
the 
Earth, 
very 
solid; 
and 
because 
I 
would 
not 
trust 
my 
memory 
with 
the 
punctual 
relation 
of 
them, 
I 
have 
brought 
back 
the

alongwithme. 


SAGR. 


You 
have 
done 
very 
well; 
but 
if 
we 
would 
re-assume 
our 
Disputations 
according 
to 
yesterdayes 
appointment, 
it 
is 
requisite 
that 
we 
first 
hear 
what 
account 
Salviatus 
hath 
to 
give 
us 
of 
the 
Book, 
De 
stellis 
novis, 
and 
then 
without 
interruption 
we 
may 
proceed 
to 
the 
Annual 
motion. 
Now 
what 
say 
you,Salviatus

SALV. 


I 
set 
my 
self 
last 
night 
to 
peruse 
his 
proceedings, 
and 
I 
have 
this 
morning 
had 
another 
view 
of 
him, 
to 
see 
whether 
that 
which 
he 
seemed 
over 
night 
to 
affirm, 
were 
really 
his 
sense, 
or 
my 
dreams 
and 
phantastical 
nocturnal 
imaginations; 
and 
in 
the 
close 
found 
to 
my 
great 
grief 
that 
those 
things 
were 
really 
written 
and 
printed, 
which 
for 
the 
reputation-sake 
of 
this 
Philosopher 
I 
was 
unwilling 
to 
believe. 
It 
is 
in 
my 
judgment 
impossible, 
but 
that 
he 
should 
perceive 
the 
vanity 
of 
his 
undertaking, 
aswell 
because 
it 
is 
too 
apert, 
as 
because 
I 
remember, 
that 
I 
have 
heard 
him 
mentioned 
with 
applause 
by 
the 
Academick 
our 
Friend: 
it 
seemeth 
to 
me 
also 
to 
be 
a 
thing 
very 
unlikely, 
that 
in 
complacency 
to 
others, 
he 
should 
be 
induced 
to 
set 
so 
low 
a 
value 
upon 
his 
reputation, 
as 
to 
give 
consent 
to 
the 
publication 
of 
a 
work, 
for 
which 
he 
could 
expectno 
other 
thanthecensureoftheLearned. 


SAGR. 


Yea, 
but 
you 
know, 
that 
those 
will 
be 
much 
fewer 
than 
one 
for 
an 
hundred, 
compared 
to 
those 
that 
shall 
celebrate 
and 
extoll 
him 
above 
the 
greatest 
wits 



that 
are, 
or 
ever 
have 
been 
in 
the 
world: 
He 
is 
one 
that 
hath 
mentioned 
the 
Peripatetick 
inalterability 
of 
Heaven 
against 
a 
troop 
of 
Astronomers, 
and 
that 
to 
their 
greater 
disgrace 
hath 
foiled 
them 
at 
their 
own 
weapons: 
and 
what 
do 
you 
think 
four 
or 
five 
in 
a 
Countrey 
that 
discern 
his 
triflings, 
can 
do 
against 
the 
innumerable 
multitude, 
that, 
not 
being 
able 
to 
discover 
or 
comprehend 
them, 
suffer 
themselves 
to 
be 
taken 
with 
words, 
and 
so 
much 
more 
applaud 
him, 
by 
how 
much 
the 
lesse 
they 
understand 
him? 
You 
may 
adde 
also, 
that 
those 
few 
who 
understand, 
scorn 
to 
give 
an 
answer 
to 
papers 
so 
trivial 
and 
unconcludent; 
and 
that 
upon 
very 
good 
reasons, 
because 
to 
the 
intelligent 
there 
is 
no 
need 
thereof, 
and 
to 
those 
that 
do 
not 
understand, 
it 
is 
but 
labour 
lost.

The 
most 
deserved 
punishment 
of 
theirdemerits 
would 
certainlybe 
silence, 
if 
there 
were 
not 
other 
reasons, 
for 
which 
it 
is 
haply 
no 
lesse 
than 
necessary 
to 
resent 
their 
timerity: 
one 
of 
which 
is, 
that 
we 
Italians 
thereby 
incur 
the 
censure 
of 
Illiterates, 
and 
attract 
the 
laughter 
of 
Forreigners; 
and 
especially 
to 
such 
who 
are 
separated 
from 
our 
Religion; 
and 
I 
could 
shew 
you 
many 
of 
those 
of 
no 
small 
eminency, 
who 
scoff 
at 
our 
Academick, 
and 
the 
many 
Mathematicians 
that 
are 
in 
Italic, 
for 
suffering 
the 
follies 
of 
such 
a 
Fabler 
against 
Astronomers 
to 
come 
into 
the 
light, 
and 
to 
be 
openly 
maintained 
without 
contradiction; 
but 
this 
also 
might 
be 
dispensed 
with, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
other 
greater 
occasions 
of 
laughter, 
wherewith 
we 
may 
confront 
them 
depending 
on 
the 
dissimulation 
of 
the 
intelligent, 
touching 
the 
follies 
of 
these 
opponentsoftheDoctrinesthattheywellenough 
understand.

I 
desire 
not 
a 
greater 
proof 
of 
those 
mens 
petulancy, 
and 
the 
infelicity 
of 
a

You 
will 
be 
no

But 
how 
could 
you 
in 
so 
short 
a 
time 
examine 
all 
this 
Book, 
which 
is 
so 
great 
a 
Volume,andmustneeds 
contain

demonstrations? 


SALV. 


I 
have 
confined 
my 
self 
to 
these 
his 
first 
confutations, 
in 
which 
with 
twelve 
demonstrations 
founded 
upon 
the 
observations 
of 
twelve 
Astronomers, 
(who 
all 
held, 
that 
the 
Star, 
Anno 
1572. 
which 
appeared 
in 
Cassiopeia, 
was

the 
meridian 
altitudes, 
proceeding 
in 
the 
method 
that 
you 
shall 
understand 
by 
and 
by. 
And 
because, 
I 
think, 
that 
in 
the 
examination 
of 
this 
his 
firstprogression, 
I 
have 
discovered 
in 
this 
Authour 
agreat 
unlikelihoodof 
his 
ability 
to 
conclude 
any 
thing 
against 
the 
Astronomers, 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
Peripatetick 
Philosophers, 
and 
that 
their 
opinion 
is 
more 
and 
more 
concludently 
confirmed, 
I 
could 
not 
apply 
my 
self 
with 
the 
like 
patience 
in 
examining 
his 
other 
methods, 
but 
have 
given 
a 
very 
slight 
glance 
upon 
them, 
and 
am 
certain, 
that 
the 
defect 
that 
is 
in 
these 
first 
impugnations, 
is 
likewise 
in 
the 
rest. 
And 
as 
you 
shall 
see, 
by 
experience, 
very 
few 
words 
will 
suffice 
to 
confute 
this 
whole 
Book, 
though 
compiled 
with 
so 
great 
a 
number 
of 
laborious 
calculations, 
The 
method 
observed 
by 
Clar. 
in 
confuting 
the 
Astronomers, 
and 
by 
Salviatus 
in 
confuting 
him. 
as 
here 
you 
see. 
Therefore 
observe 
my 
proceedings. 
This 
Authour 
undertaketh, 
as 
I 
say, 
to 
wound 
his 
adversaries 
with 
their 
own 
weapons, 
i. 
e. 
a 
great 
number 
of 
observations 
made 
by 
themselves, 
to 
wit, 
by 
twelve 
or 
thirteen 
Authours 
in 
number, 
and 
upon 
part 
of 
them 
he 
makes 
his 
supputations, 
and 
concludeth 
those 
stars 
to 
have 
been 
below 
the 
Moon. 
Now 
because 
the 
proceeding 
by 
interrogatories 
very 
much 
pleaseth 
me, 
in 
regard 
the 
Authour 
himself 
is 
not 
here, 
let 
Simplicius 
answer 
me 
to 
the 
questions 
that 
I 
shall 
ask 
him, 
as 
he 
thinks 
he 
himself 
would, 
if 
he 
were 
present. 
And 
presupposing 
that 
we 
speak 
of 
the 
foresaid 
Star, 
of 
Anno 
1572. 
appearing 
in 
Cassiopeia, 
tell 
me, 
Simplicius, 
whether 
you 
believe 
that 
it 
might 
be 
in 
the 
same 
time 
placed 
in 
divers 
places, 
that 
is, 
amongst 
the 
Elements, 
aud 
also 
amongst 
the

Orbs, 
and 
also 
above 
these 
amongstthefixedStars,

SIMP. 


There 
is 
no 
doubt, 
but 
that 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
confessed 
that 
it 
is 
but 
in 
one 
only 
place,andatonesoleanddeterminatedistance

SALV. 
Therefore 
if 
the 
observations 
made 
by 
the 
Astronomers 
were 
exact, 
and 
the 


calculations 
made 
by 
this 
Author 
were 
not 
erroneous, 
it 
were 
easie 
from 
all 
those 
and 
all 
these 
to 
recollect 
the 
same 
distances 
alwayes 
to 
an 
hair, 
is 
not 
this 
true? 


SIMP. 


My 
reason 
hitherto 
tells 
me 
that 
so 
it 
must 
needs 
be; 
nor 
do 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
Authorwouldcontradict 
it. 
SALV. 
But 
when 
of 
many 
and 
many 
computations 
that 
have 
been 
made, 
there 
should 


notbeso 
muchas 
twoonelythatprove 
true,what 
wouldyouthinkofthem? 
SIMP. 
I 
would 
think 
that 
they 
were 
all 
false, 
either 
through 
the 
fault 
of 
the 


computist, 
or 
through 
the 
defect 
of 
the 
observators, 
and 
at 
the 
most 
that 
could 
be 
said, 
I 
would 
say, 
that 
but 
onely 
one 
of 
them 
and 
no 
more 
was 
true; 
but 
as 
yetIknow 
not 
whichto 
choose. 


SALV. 
Would 
you 
then 
from 
false 
fundamentals 
deduce 
and 
establish 
a 
doubtful 
conclusion 
for 
true? 
Certainly 
no. 
Now 
the 
calculations 
of 
this 
Author 
are 


such, 
that 
no 
one 
of 
them 
agrees 
with 
another, 
you 
may 
see 
then 
what 
credit 
is 
tobegiventothem. 
SIMP. 
Indeed, 
ifit 
beso,thisisanotable 
failing. 



SAGR. 


But 
by 
the 
way 
I 
have 
a 
mind 
to 
help 
Simplicius, 
and 
the 
Author 
by 
telling 
Salviatus, 
that 
his 
arguments 
would 
hold 
good 
if 
the 
Author 
had 
undertook 
to 
go 
about 
to 
find 
out 
exactly 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
Star 
from 
the 
Earth, 
which 
I 
do 
not 
think 
to 
be 
his 
intention; 
but 
onely 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
from 
those 
observations 
he 
collected 
that 
the 
Star 
was 
sublunary. 
So 
that 
if 
from 
those 
observations, 
and 
from 
all 
the 
computations 
made 
thereon, 
the 
height 
of 
the 
Star 
be 
alwayes 
collected 
to 
be 
lesse 
than 
that 
of 
the 
Moon, 
it 
serves 
the 
Authors 
turn 
to 
convince 
all 
those 
Astronomers 
of 
most 
impardonable 
ignorance, 
that 
through 
the 
defect 
either 
of 
Geometry 
or 
Arithmetick, 
have 
not 
known 
how 
to 
draw 
true 
conclusions 
from 
their 
own 
observations 
themselves. 


SALV. 


It 
will 
be 
convenient 
therefore 
that 
I 
turn 
my 
self 
to 
you, 
Sagredus, 
who 
so 
cunningly 
aphold 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
this 
Author. 
And 
to 
see 
whether 
I 
can 
make 
Simplicius, 
though 
not 
very 
expert 
in 
calculations, 
and 
demonstrations 
to 
apprehend 
the 
inconclusivenesse 
at 
least 
of 
the 
demonstrations 
of 
this 
Author, 
first 
proposed 
to 
consideration, 
and 
how 
both 
he, 
and 
all 
the 
Astronomers 
with 
whom 
he 
contendeth, 
do 
agree 
that 
the 
new 
Star 
had 
not 
any 
motion 
of 
its 
own, 
and 
onely 
went 
round 
with 
the 
diurnal 
motion 
of 
the 
primum 
mobile; 
but 
dissent 
about 
the 
placing 
of 
it, 
the 
one 
party 
putting 
it 
in 
the 
Celestial 
Region, 
that 
is 
above 
the 
Moon, 
and 
haply 
above 
the 
fixed 
Stars, 
and 
the 
other 
judging 
it 
to 
be 
neer 
to 
the 
Earth, 
that 
is, 
under 
the 
concave 
of 
the 
Lunar 
Orb. 
And 
because 
the 
situation 
of 
the 
new 
star, 
of 
which 
we 
speak, 
was 
towards 
the 
North, 
and 
at 
no 
very 
great 
distance 
from 
the 
Pole, 
so 
that 
to 
us 
Septentrionals, 
it 
did 
never 
set, 
it 
was 
an 
easie 
matter 
with 
Astronomical 
instruments 
to 
have 
taken 
its 
several 
meridian 
altitudes, 
as 
well 
its 
smallest 
under 
the 
Pole, 
as 
its 
greatest 
above 
the 
same; 
from 
the 
comparing 
of 
which 
altitudes, 
made 
in 
several 
places 
of 
the 
Earth, 
situate 
at 
different 
distances 
from 
the 
North, 
that 
is, 
different 
from 
one 
another 
in 
relation 
to 
polar 
altitudes, 
the 
stars 
distance 
might 
be 
inferred: 
The 
greatest 
and 
least 
elevations 
of 
the 
new 
star 
differ 
not 
from 
each 
other 
more 
than 
the 
polar 
altitudes, 
the 
said 
star 
being 
in 
the 
Firmnment. 
For 
if 
it 
was 
in 
the 
Firmament 
amongst 
the 
other 
fixed 
stars, 
its 
meridian 
altitudes 
taken 
in 
divers 
elevations 



of 
the 
pole, 
ought 
necessarily 
to 
differ 
from 
each 
other 
with 
the 
same 
variations 
that 
are 
found 
amongst 
those 
elevations 
themselves; 
that 
is, 
for 
example, 
if 
the 
elevation 
of 
the 
star 
above 
the 
horizon 
was 
30 
degrees, 
taken 
intheplacewhere 
the 
polar 
altitudewasv. 
gr. 
45degrees,theelevationofthe 
same 
star 
ought 
to 
have 
been 
encreased 
4 
or 
5 
degrees 
in 
those 
more 
Northernly 
places 
where 
the 
pole 
was 
higher 
bythe 
said 
4 
or 
5 
degrees. 
Butif 
the 
stars 
distance 
from 
the 
Earth 
was 
but 
very 
little, 
in 
comparison 
of 
that 
of 
the 
Firmament; 
its 
meridian 
altitudes 
ought 
approaching 
to 
the 
North 
to 
encrease 
considerably 
more 
than 
the 
polar 
altitudes; 
and 
by 
that 
greater 
encrease, 
that 
is, 
by 
the 
excesse 
of 
the 
encrease 
of 
the 
stars 
elevation, 
above 
the 
encrease 
of 
the 
polar 
elevation 
(which 
is 
called 
the 
difference 
of 
Parallaxes) 
is 
readily 
calculated 
with 
a 
cleer 
and 
sure 
method, 
the 
stars 
distance 
from 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth. 
Now 
this 
Author 
taketh 
the 
observations 
made 
by 
thirteen 
Astronomers 
in 
sundry 
elevations 
of 
the 
pole, 
and 
conferring 
a 
part 
of 
them 
at 
his 
pleasure, 
he 
computeth 
by 
twelve 
collations 
the 
new 
stars 
height 
to 
have 
been 
alwayes 
beneath 
the 
Moon; 
but 
this 
he 
adventures 
to 
do 
in 
hopes 
to 
find 
so 
grosse 
ignorance 
in 
all 
those, 
into 
whose 
hands 
his 
book 
might 
come, 
that 
to 
speak 
the 
truth, 
it 
hath 
turn’d 
my 
stomack; 
and 
I 
wait 
to 
see 
how 
those 
other 
Astronomers, 
and 
particularly 
Kepler, 
against 
whom 
this 
Author 
principally 
inveigheth, 
can 
contein 
themselves 
in 
silence, 
for 
he 
doth 
not 
use 
to 
hold 
his 
tongue 
on 
such 
occasions; 
unlesse 
he 
did 
possibly 
think 
the 
enterprize 
too 
much 
below 
him. 
Now 
to 
give 
you 
to 
understand 
the 
same, 
I 
have 
upon 
this 
paper 
transcribed 
the 
conclusions 
that 
he 
inferreth 
from 
his 
twelve 
indagations;

the

at

I 
would 
know 
whether 
amongst 
the 
so 
many 
other 
indagations 
pretermitted 
by 
the 
Author, 
there 
were 
not 
some 
that 
made 
against 
him, 
that 
is, 
from 
which 
calculating 
one 
might 
find 
the 
new 
star 
to 
have 
been 
above 
the 
Moon, 
as 
at 
the 
very 
first 
sight 
I 
think 
we 
may 
reasonably 
question; 
in 
regard 
I 
see 
these 
already 
produced 
to 
be 
so 
different 
from 
one 
another, 
that 
some 
of 
them 
give 
me 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
said 
star 
from 
the 
Earth, 
4, 
6, 
10, 
100, 
a 
thousand, 
and 
an 
hundred 
thousand 
times 
bigger 
one 
than 
another; 
so 
that 
I 
may 
well 
suspect 
that 
amongst 
those 
that 
he 
did 
not 
calculate, 
there 
was 
some 
one 
in 
fauour 
of 
the 
adverse 
party. 
And 
I 
guesse 
this 
to 
be 
the 
more 
probable, 
for 
that 
I 
cannot 
conceive 
that 
those 
Astronomers 
the 
observators 
could 
want 
the 
knowledg 
and 
practice 
of 
rhese 
computations, 
which 
I 
think 
do 
not 
depend 
upon 
the 
abstrucest 
things 
in 
the 
World. 
And 
indeed 
it 
will 
seem 
to 
me 
a 
thing 
more 
than 
miraculous, 
if 
whilst 
in 
these 
twelve 
investigations 
onely, 
there 
are 
some 
that 
make 
the 
star 
to 
be 
distant 
from 
the 
Earth 
but 
a 
few 
miles, 
and 
others 
that 
make 
it 
to 
be 
but 
a 
very 
fmall 
matter 
below 
the 
Moon, 
there 
are 
none 
to 
be 
found 
that 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
contrary 
part 
do 
make 
it 
so 
much 
as 
twenty 
yards 
above 
the 
Lunar 
Orb. 
And 
that 
which 
shall 
be 
yet 
again 
more 
extravagant, 
that 
all 
those 
Astronomers 
should 
have 
been 
so 
blind 
as 
not 
to 
havediscovered 
thattheirsoapparentmistake.

Begin 
now 
to 
prepare 
your

to 
hear 
with 
infinite 
admiration 
to 
what 
excesses 
of 
confidence 
of 
ones 
own 
authority 
and 
others 
folly, 
the 
desire 
of 
contradicting 
and 
shewing

wiser 
than 
others, 
transports 
a 
man. 
Amongst 
the 
indagations 
omitted 
by 
the 
Author, 
there 
are 
such 
to 
be 
found 
as 
make 
the 
new 
star 
not 
onely 
above 
the 
Moon, 
but 
above 
the 
fixed 
stars 
also. 
And 
these 
are 
not 
a 
few, 
but 
the 
greater 
part, 
as 
you 
shall

in

upon 
which 
the

the

Tell

I 
believe 
that 
you 
do 
likewise 
comprehend,

in

the

is 
lower 
than 
C, 
the 
angle 
which 
is 
made

which 
departing 
from 
the 
two

And 
also, 
the

beine 
very 
little 
and 
almost 
insensible, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
Firmament 
(or 
Starry 
Sphere;) 
and 
consequently 
the 
space 
AE, 
paced 
on 
the 
Earth, 
being 
very 
small 
in 
comparison 
of 
the 
immense 
length 
of 
the 
lines 
EG 
and 
EF, 
passing 
from 
the 
Earth 
unto 
the 
Firmament, 
you 
thereby 
collect 
that 
the 
star 
C 
might 
rise 
and 
ascend 
so 
much 
and 
so 
much 
above 
the 
Earth, 
that 
the 
angle 
therein 
made 
by 
the 
rayes 
which 
depart 
from 
the 
said 
stationary 
points 
A 
and

might 
become 
most 
acute,

Now 
you 
know 
Simplicius 
that 
Astronomers 
and 
Mathematicians 
have 
found 
infallible 
rules 
by 
way 
of 
Geometry 
and 
Arithmetick, 
to 
be 
able 
by 
help 
of 
the 
quantity 
of 
these 
angles 
B 
and 
C, 
and 
of 
their 
differences, 
with 
the 
additional 
knowledg 
of 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
two 
places 
A 
and 
E, 
to 
find 
to 
a 
foot 
the 
remotenesse 
of 
sublime 
bodies; 
provided 
alwayes 
that 
the 
aforesaid 
distance,and 
anglesbeexactlytaken. 


SIMP. 


So 
that 
if 
the 
Rules 
dependent 
on 
Geometry 
and 
Astronomy 
be 
true, 
all 
the 
fallacies 
and 
errours 
that 
might 
be 
met 
with 
in 
attempting 
to 
investigate 
those 
altitudes 
of 
new 
Stars 
or 
Comets, 
or 
other 
things 
must 
of 
necessity 
depend 
on 
the 
distance 
AE, 
and 
on 
the 
angles 
B 
and 
C, 
not 
well 
measured. 
And 
thus 
all 
those 
differences 
which 
are 
found 
in 
these 
twelve 
workings 
depend, 
not 
on 
the 
defects 
of 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
Calculations, 
but 
on 
the 
errours 
committed 
in 
finding 
out 
those 
angles, 
and 
those 
distances, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
Instrumental 
Observations. 


SALV. 


True; 
and 
of 
this 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
to 
be 
made. 
Now 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
you 
observe 
intensely, 
how 
in 
removing 
the 
Star 
from 
B 
to 
C, 
whereupon 
the 
angle 
alwayes 
grows 
more 
acute, 
the 
ray 
EBG 
goeth 
farther 
and 
farther 
off 
from 
the 
ray 
ABD 
in 
the 
part 
beneath 
the 
angle, 
as 
you 
may 
see 
in 
the 
line 
ECF, 
whose 
inferiour 
part 
EC 
is 
more 
remote 
from 
the 
part 
AC, 
than 
is 
the 
part 
EB, 
but 
it 
can 
never 
happen, 
that 
by 
any 
whatsoever 
immense 
recession, 
the 
lines 
AD 
and 
EF 
should 
totally 
sever 
from 
each 
other, 
they 
being 
finally 
to 
go 
and 
conjoyn 
in 
the 
Star: 
and 
onely 
this 
may 
be 
said, 
that 
they 
would 
separate, 
and 
reduce 
themselves 
to 
parallels, 
if 
so 
be 
the 
recession 
should 
be 
infinite, 
which 
case 
is 
not 
to 
be 
supposed. 
But 
because 
(observe 
well) 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
Firmament, 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
smallnesse 
of 
the 
Earth, 
as 
hath 
been 
said, 
is 
to 
be 
accounted, 
as 
if 
it 
were 
infinite; 
therefore 
the 
angle 



conteined 
betwixt 
the 
two 
rayes, 
that 
being 
drawn 
from 
the 
points 
A 
and 
E, 
go 
to 
determine 
in 
a 
fixed 
Star, 
is 
esteemed 
nothing, 
and 
those 
rayes 
held 
to 
be 
two 
parallel 
lines; 
and 
therefore 
it 
is 
concluded, 
that 
then 
only 
may 
the 
New 
Starbe 
affirmed 
to 
have 
beenin 
the 
Firmament, 
when 
from 
the 
collating 
of 
the 
Observations 
made 
in 
divers 
places, 
the 
said 
angle 
is, 
by 
calculation, 
gathered 
to 
be 
insensible, 
and 
the 
lines, 
as 
it 
were, 
parallels. 
But 
if 
the 
angle 
be 
of 
a 
considerable 
quantity, 
the 
New 
Star 
must 
of 
necessity 
be 
lower 
than 
those 
fixed; 
and 
also 
than 
the 
Moon, 
in 
case 
the 
angle 
ABE 
should 
be 
greater 
thanthatwhich 
wouldbemadein 
the 
Moonscentre. 


SIMP. 


Then 
the 
remotenesse 
of 
the 
Moon 
is 
not 
so 
great, 
that 
a 
like 
angle 
should 
be 
insensibleinher?

NoSir; 
nayitissensible,notonelyin

But 
if 
this 
be 
so, 
it’s 
possible 
that 
the 
said 
angle 
may 
be 
observed 
in 
the 
New 
Star, 
without 
necessitatingittobeinferiourtotheSun,aswellastotheMoon. 


SALV. 


This 
may 
very 
well 
be, 
yea, 
and 
is 
in 
the 
present 
case, 
as 
you 
shall 
see 
in 
due 
place; 
that 
is, 
when 
I 
shall 
have 
made 
plain 
the 
way, 
in 
such 
manner 
that 
you 
also, 
though 
not 
very 
perfect 
in 
Astronomical 
calculations, 
may 
clearly 
see, 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
with 
your 
hands 
feel 
how 
that 
this 
Author 
had 
it 
more 
in 
his 
eye 
to 
write 
in 
complacency 
of 
the 
Peripateticks, 
by 
palliating 
and 
dissemblingsundry 
things, 
thantoestablishthetruth,byproducingthemwith 
naked 
sincerity: 
therefore 
let 
us 
proceed 
forwards. 
By 
the 
things 
hitherto 
spoken, 
I 
suppose 
that 
you 
comprehend 
very 
well 
how 
that 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
new 
Star 
can 
never 
be 
made 
so 
immense, 
that 
the 
angle 
so 
often 
named 
shall 
wholly 
disappear, 
and 
that 
the 
two 
rayes 
of 
the 
Observators 
at 
the 
places 
A 
and 
E, 
shall 
become 
altogether 
parallels: 
and 
you 
may 
consequently 
comprehend 
to 
the 
full, 
that 
if 
the 
calculations 
should 
collect 
from 
the 



observations, 
that 
that 
angle 
was 
totally 
null, 
or 
that 
the 
lines 
were 
truly 
parallels, 
we 
should 
be 
certain 
that 
the 
observations 
were 
at 
least 
in 
some 
small 
particular 
erroneous: 
But, 
if 
the 
calculations 
should 
give 
us 
the 
said 
lines 
to 
be 
separated 
not 
only 
to 
equidistance, 
that 
is, 
so 
as 
to 
be 
parallel, 
but 
to 
have 
past 
beyond 
that 
terme, 
and 
to 
be 
dilated 
more 
above 
than 
below, 
then 
must 
it 
be 
resolutely 
concluded, 
that 
the 
observations 
were 
made 
with 
lesse 
accuratenesse, 
and 
in 
a 
word, 
to 
be 
erroneous; 
as 
leading 
us 
to 
a 
manifest 
impossibility. 
In 
the 
next 
place, 
you 
must 
believe 
me, 
and 
suppose 
it 
for 
true, 
that 
two 
right 
lines 
which 
depart 
from 
two 
points 
marked 
upon 
another 
right 
line, 
are 
then 
wider 
above 
than 
below, 
when 
the 
angles 
included 
between 
them 
upon 
that 
right 
line 
are 
greater 
than 
two 
right 
angles; 
and 
if 
these 
angles 
should 
be 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles, 
the 
lines 
would 
be 
parallels; 
but 
if 
they 
were 
less 
than 
two 
right 
angles, 
the 
lines 
would 
be 
concurrent, 
and 
beingcontinuedoutwouldundoubtedly 
intersectthetriangle. 


SIMP. 


Without 
taking 
it 
upon 
trust 
from 
you, 
I 
know 
the 
same; 
and 
am 
not 
so 
very 
naked 
of 
Geometry, 
as 
not 
to 
know 
a 
Proposition, 
which 
I 
have 
had 
occasion 
of 
reading 
very 
often 
in 
Aristotle, 
that 
is, 
that 
the 
three 
angles 
of 
all 
triangles 
are 
equall 
to 
two 
right 
angles: 
so 
that 
if 
I 
take 
in 
my 
Figure 
the 
triangle 
ABE, 
it 
being 
supposed 
that 
the 
line 
EA 
is 
right; 
I 
very 
well 
conceive, 
that 
its 
three 
angles 
A, 
E, 
B, 
are 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles; 
and 
that 
consequently 
the 
two 
angles 
E 
and 
A 
are 
lesse 
than 
two 
right 
angles, 
so 
much 
as 
is 
the 
angle 
B. 
Whereupon 
widening 
the 
lines 
AB 
and 
EB 
(still 
keeping 
them 
from 
moving 
out 
of 
the 
points 
A 
and 
E) 
untill 
that 
the 
angle 
conteined 
by 
them 
towards 
the 
parts 
B, 
disappear, 
the 
two 
angles 
beneath 
shall 
be 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles, 
and 
those 
lines 
shall 
be 
reduced 
to 
parallels: 
and 
if 
one 
should 
proceed 
to 
enlarge 
them 
yet 
more, 
the 
angles 
at 
the 
points 
E 
and 
A 
would 
become 
greaterthantworightangles. 


SALV. 


You 
are 
an 
Archimedes, 
and 
have 
freed 
me 
from 
the 
expence 
of 
more 
words 
in 
declaring 
to 
you, 
that 
whensoever 
the 
calculations 
make 
the 
two 
angles 
A 
and 
E 
to 
be 
greater 
than 
two 
right 
angles, 
the 
observations 
without 
more 
adoe 
will 
prove 
erroneous. 
This 
is 
that 
which 
I 
had 
a 
desire 
that 
you 
should 
perfectly 
understand, 
and 
which 
I 
doubted 
that 
I 
was 
not 
able 
so 
to 
make 
out, 



as 
that 
a 
meer 
Peripatetick 
Philosopher 
might 
attain 
to 
the 
certain 
knowledg 
thereof. 
Now 
let 
us 
go 
on 
to 
what 
remains. 
And 
re-assuming 
that 
which 
even 
now 
you 
granted 
me, 
namely, 
that 
the 
new 
star 
could 
not 
possibly 
be 
in 
many 
places, 
but 
in 
one 
alone, 
when 
ever 
the 
supputations 
made 
upon 
the 
observations 
of 
these 
Astronomers 
do 
not 
assign 
it 
the 
same 
place, 
its 
necessary 
that 
it 
be 
an 
errour 
in 
the 
observations, 
that 
is, 
either 
in 
taking 
the 
altitudes 
of 
the 
pole, 
or 
in 
taking 
the 
elevations 
of 
the 
star, 
or 
in 
the 
one 
or 
other 
working. 
Now 
for 
that 
in 
the 
many 
workings 
made 
with 
the 
combinations 
two 
by 
two, 
there 
are 
very 
few 
of 
the 
observationsthatdo 
agree 
to 
place 
the 
star 
in 
the 
same 
situation; 
therefore 
these 
few 
onely 
may 
happily 
bethenon-erroneous,buttheothersare 
allabsolutely 
false. 


SAGR. 


It 
will 
be 
necessary 
then 
to 
give 
more 
credit 
to 
these 
few 
alone, 
than 
to 
all 
the 
rest 
together, 
and 
because 
you 
say, 
that 
these 
which 
accord 
are 
very 
few, 
and 
I 
amongst 
these 
12, 
do 
find 
two 
that 
so 
accord, 
which 
both 
make 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
star 
from 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth 
4 
semidiameters, 
which 
are 
these, 
the 
fifth 
and 
sixth, 
therefore 
it 
is 
more 
probable 
that 
the 
new 
star 
was 
elementary, 
thancelestial. 


SALV. 


You 
mistake 
the 
point; 
for 
if 
you 
note 
well 
it 
was 
not 
written, 
that 
the 
distance 
was 
exactly 
4 
semidiameters, 
but 
about 
4 
semidiameters; 
and 
yet 
you 
shall 
see 
that 
those 
two 
distances 
differed 
from 
each 
other 
many 
hundreds 
of 
miles. 
Here 
they 
are; 
you 
see 
that 
this 
fifth, 
which 
is

whichis

They 
are, 
to 
the 
disgrace 
of 
this

five 
workings, 
which 
all 
place 
it 
in 
the

as 
you 
shall 
see 
in 
this 
note, 
where 
I 
have 
set 
down 
many 
other 
combinations. 
But 
I 
will 
grant 
the 
Author 
more 
than 
peradventure 
he 



would 
demand 
of 
me, 
which 
is 
in 
sum, 
that 
in 
each 
combination 
of 
the 
observations 
there 
is 
some 
error; 
which 
I 
believe 
to 
be 
absolutely 
necessary; 
for 
the 
observations 
being 
four 
in 
number 
that 
serve 
for 
one 
working, 
that 
is, 
two 
different 
altitudes 
of 
the

and 
two 
different 
elevations 
of 
the

made 
by 
different

in 
different

Astronomical

errour. 
with 
different

who 
ever 
hath 
any

knowledg 
of

will

that 
amongst 
all

four, 
it 
is 
impossible 
but 
there 
will 
be 
some 
error; 
and 
especially 
since 
we 
see 
that 
in 
taking 
but 
one 
onely 
altitude 
of 
the 
Pole, 
with 
the 
same 
instrument, 
in 
the 
same 
place, 
by 
the 
same 
observer, 
that 
hath 
repeated 
the 
observation 
a 
thousand 
times, 
therewillstillbeatitubationofone,or 
sometimesof 
many 
minutes, 
asinthis 
same 
book 
you 
may 
see 
in 
several 
places. 
These 
things 
presupposed, 
I 
ask 
you 
Simplicius 
whether 
you 
believe 
that 
this 
Authour 
held 
these 
thirteen 
observators 
for 
wise, 
understanding 
and 
expert 
men 
in 
using 
those 
instruments, 
orelseforinexpert,andbunglers? 


SIMP. 


It 
must 
needs 
be 
that 
he 
esteemed 
them 
very 
acute 
and 
intelligent; 
for 
if 
he 
had 
thought 
them 
unskilful 
in 
the 
businesse, 
he 
might 
have 
omitted 
his 
sixth 
book 
as 
inconclusive, 
as 
being 
founded 
upon 
suppositions 
very 
erroneous; 
and 
might 
take 
us 
for 
excessively 
simple, 
if 
he 
should 
think 
he 
could 
with 
theirinexpertnesseperswade 
ustobelieveafalsepositionofhisfortruth. 


SALV. 


Therefore 
these 
observators 
being 
such, 
and 
that 
yet 
notwithstanding 
they 
did 
erre, 
and 
so 
consequently 
needed 
correction, 
that 
so 
one 
might 
from 
their 
observations 
infer 
the 
best 
hints 
that 
may 
be; 
it 
is 
convenient 
that 
we 
apply 
unto 
them 
the 
least 
and 
neerest 
emendations 
and 
corrections 
that 
may 
be; 
so 
that 
they 
do 
but 
suffice 
to 
reduce 
the 
observations 
from 
impossibility 
to 
possibility; 
so 
as 
v. 
gr. 
if 
one 
may 
but 
correct 
a 
manifest 
errour, 
and 
an 
apparent 
impossibility 
of 
one 
of 
their 
observations 
by 
the 
addition 
or 
substraction 
of 
two 
or 
three 
minutes, 
and 
with 
that 
amendment 
to 
reduce 
it 
to 
possibility, 
a 
man 
ought 
not 
to 
essay 
to 
adjust 
it 
by 
the 
addition 
or 
substractionoffifteen,twenty,orfifty. 


SIMP. 



I 
think 
the 
Author 
would 
not 
deny 
this: 
for 
granting 
that 
they 
are 
expert 
and 
judiciousmen,it 
oughttobethoughtthattheydidrather 
errelittlethanmuch. 


SALV. 


Observe 
again; 
The 
places 
where 
the 
new 
Star 
is 
placed, 
are 
some 
of 
them 
manifestly 
impossible, 
and 
others 
possible. 
Absolutely 
impossible 
it 
is, 
that 
it 
should 
be 
an 
infinite 
space 
superiour 
to 
the 
fixed 
Stars, 
for 
there 
is 
no 
such 
place 
in 
the 
world; 
and 
if 
there 
were, 
the 
Star 
there 
scituate 
would 
have 
been 
imperceptible 
to 
us: 
it 
is 
also 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
go 
creeping 
along 
the 
superficies 
of 
the 
Earth; 
and 
much 
lesse 
that 
it 
should 
be 
within 
the 
said 
Terrestrial 
Globe. 
Places 
possible 
are 
these 
that 
be 
in 
controversie, 
it 
not 
interferring 
vvith 
our 
understanding, 
that 
a 
visible 
object 
in 
the 
likenesse 
of 
a 
Star 
might 
be 
aswell 
above 
the 
Moon, 
as 
below 
it. 
Now 
whilst 
one 
goeth 
about 
to 
compute 
by 
the 
way 
of 
Observations 
and 
Calculations 
made 
with 
the 
utmostcertainty 
thathumanediligencecanattain 
untowhatitsplacewas,it 
is 
found 
that 
the 
greatest 
part 
of 
those 
Calculations 
make 
it 
more 
than 
infinitely 
superiour 
to 
the 
Firmament, 
others 
make 
it 
very 
neer 
to 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
Earth, 
and 
some 
also 
under 
the 
same; 
and 
of 
the 
rest, 
which 
place 
it 
in 
situations 
not 
impossible, 
none 
of 
them 
agree 
with 
each 
other; 
insomuch 
that 
it 
must 
be 
confessed, 
hat 
all 
those 
observations 
are 
necessarily 
false; 
so 
that 
if 
we 
would 
nevertheless 
collect 
some 
fruit 
from 
so 
many 
laborious 
calculations, 
we 
must 
have 
recourse 
to 
the 
corrections, 
amending 
all 
the 
observations. 


SIMP. 


But 
the 
Authour 
will 
say, 
that 
of 
the 
observations 
that 
assign 
to 
the 
Star 
impossible 
places, 
there 
ought 
no 
account 
to 
be 
made, 
as 
being 
extreamly 
erroneous 
and 
false; 
and 
those 
onely 
ought 
to 
be 
accepted, 
that 
constitute 
it 
in 
places 
not 
impossible: 
and 
amongst 
these 
a 
man 
ought 
to 
seek, 
by 
help 
of 
the 
most 
probable, 
and 
most 
numerous 
concurrences, 
not 
if 
the 
particular 
and 
exact 
situation, 
that 
is, 
its 
true 
distance 
from 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
at 
least, 
whether 
itwasamongst

SALV. 



The 
discourse 
which 
you 
now 
make, 
is 
the 
self 
same 
that 
the 
Author 
made, 
in 
favour 
of 
his 
cause, 
but 
with 
too 
unreasonable 
a 
disadvantage 
to 
his 
adversaries; 
and 
this 
is 
that 
principal 
point 
that 
hath 
made 
me 
excessively 
to 
wonder 
at 
the 
too 
great 
confidence 
that 
he 
expressed 
to 
have, 
no 
less 
of 
his 
own 
authority, 
than 
of 
the 
blindness 
and 
inadvertency 
of 
the 
Astronomers; 
in 
favour 
of 
whom 
I 
will 
speak, 
and 
you 
shall 
answer 
for 
the 
Author. 
And 
first, 
I 
ask 
you, 
whether 
the 
Astronomers, 
in 
observing 
with 
their 
Instruments, 
and 
seeking 
v. 
gr. 
how 
great 
the 
elevation 
of 
a 
Star 
is 
above 
the 
Horizon, 
may 
deviate 
from 
the 
truth, 
aswell 
in 
making 
it 
too 
great, 
as 
too 
little; 
that 
is, 
may 
erroneously 
compute, 
that 
itissometime 
higher 
than 
thetruth, 
and 
sometimes 
lower; 
or 
else 
whether 
the 
errour 
must 
needs 
be 
alwayes 
of 
one 
kinde, 
to 
wit, 
that 
erring 
they 
alwayes 
makeittoo 
much,andnever 
too 
little, 
or 
alwayes 
too 
little,andnevertoo 
much? 


SIMP. 


I 
doubt 
not, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
as 
easie 
to 
commit 
an 
errour 
the 
one 
way, 
as 
the 
other. 


SALV. 


I 
believe 
the 
Author 
would 
answer 
the 
same. 
Now 
of 
these 
two 
kinds 
of 
errours, 
which 
are 
contraries, 
and 
into 
which 
the 
observators 
of 
the 
new 
star 
may 
equally 
have 
fallen, 
applied 
to 
calculations, 
one 
sort 
will 
make 
the 
star 
higher, 
and 
the 
other 
lower 
than 
really 
it 
is. 
And 
because 
we 
have 
already 
agreed, 
that 
all 
the 
observations 
are 
false; 
upon 
what 
ground 
would 
this 
Author 
have 
us 
to 
accept 
those 
for 
most 
congruous 
with 
the 
truth, 
that 
shew 
the 
star 
to 
have 
been 
near 
at 
hand, 
than 
the 
others 
that 
shew 
it 
excessively 
remote? 


SIMP. 


By 
what 
I 
have, 
as 
yet, 
collected 
of 
the 
Authors 
mind, 
I 
see 
not 
that 
he 
doth 
refuse 
those 
observations, 
and 
indagations 
that 
might 
make 
the 
star 
more 
remote 
than 
the 
Moon, 
and 
also 
than 
the 
Sun, 
but 
only 
those 
that 
make 
it 
remote 
(as 
you 
your 
self 
have 
said) 
more 
than 
an 
infinite 
distance; 
the 
which 
distance, 
because 
you 
also 
do 
refuse 
it 
as 
impossible, 
he 
also 
passeth 
over, 
as 
being 
convicted 
of 
infinite 
falshood; 
as 
also 
those 
observations 
are 
of 



impossibility. 
Methinks, 
therefore, 
that 
if 
you 
would 
convince 
the 
Author, 
you 
ought 
to 
produce 
supputations, 
more 
exact, 
or 
more 
in 
number, 
or 
of 
more 
diligent 
observers, 
which 
constitute 
the 
star 
in 
such 
and 
such 
a 
distance 
above 
theMoon, 
or 
above 
the 
Sun, 
andto 
be 
brief,in 
aplacepossible 
for 
it 
to 
be 
in, 
like 
as 
he 
produceth 
these 
twelve, 
which 
all 
place 
the 
star 
beneath 
the 
Moon 
in 
places 
that 
have 
a 
being 
in 
the 
world, 
and 
where 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
it 
tobe. 


SALV. 


But 
Simplicius 
yours 
and 
the 
Authors 
Equivocation 
lyeth 
in 
this, 
yours 
in 
one 
respect, 
and 
the 
Authors 
in 
another; 
I 
discover 
by 
your 
speech 
that 
you 
have 
formed 
a 
conceit 
to 
your 
self, 
that 
the 
exorbitancies 
that 
are 
commited 
in 
the 
establishing 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
Star 
do 
encrease 
successively, 
according 
to 
the 
proportion 
of 
the 
errors 
that 
are 
made 
by 
the 
Instrument, 
in 
taking 
the 
observations, 
and 
that 
by 
conversion, 
from 
the 
greatness 
of 
the 
exorbitancies, 
may 
be 
argued 
the 
greatnesse 
of 
the 
error; 
and 
that 
thereforefore 
hearing 
it 
to 
be 
infered 
from 
such 
an 
observation, 
that 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
star 
is 
infinite, 
it 
is 
necessary, 
that 
the 
errour 
in 
observing 
was 
infinite, 
and 
therefore 
not 
to 
be 
amended, 
and 
as 
such 
to 
be 
refused; 
but 
the 
businesse 
doth 
not 
succeed 
in 
that 
manner, 
my 
Simplicius, 
and 
I 
excuse 
you 
for 
not 
having 
comprehended 
the 
matter 
as 
it 
is, 
in 
regard 
of 
your 
small 
experience 
in 
such 
affairs; 
but 
yet 
cannot 
I 
under 
that 
cloak 
palliate 
the 
error 
of 
the 
Author, 
who 
dissembling 
the 
knowledge 
of 
this 
which 
he 
did 
perswade 
himself 
that 
we 
in 
good 
earnest 
did 
not 
understand, 
hath 
hoped 
to 
make 
use 
of 
our 
ignorance, 
to 
gain 
the 
better 
credit 
to 
his 
Doctrine, 
among 
the 
multitude 
of 
illiterate 
men. 
Therefore 
for 
an 
advertisement 
to 
those 
who 
are 
more 
credulous 
then 
intelligent, 
and 
to 
recover 
you 
from 
error, 
know 
that 
its 
possible 
(and 
that 
for 
the 
most 
part 
it 
will 
come 
to 
passe) 
that 
an 
observation, 
that 
giveth 
you 
the 
star 
v. 
gr. 
at 
the 
distance 
of 
Saturn, 
by 
the 
adition 
or 
substraction 
of 
but 
one 
sole 
minute 
from 
the 
elevation 
taken 
with 
the 
instrument, 
shall 
make 
it 
to 
become 
infinitely 
distant; 
and 
therefore 
of 
possible, 
impossible, 
and 
by 
conversion, 
those 
calculations 
which 
being 
grounded 
upon 
those 
observations, 
make 
the 
star 
infinitely 
remote, 
may 
possibly 
oftentimes 
with 
the 
addition 
or 
subduction 
of 
one 
sole 
minute, 
reduce 
it 
to 
a 
possible 
scituation: 
and 
this 
which 
I 
say 
of 
a 
minute, 
may 
also 
happen 
in 
the 
correction 
of 
half 
a 
minute, 
a 
sixth 
part, 
and 
less. 
Now 
fix 
it 
well 
in 
your 
mind, 
that 
in 
the 
highest 
distances, 
that 
is 
v. 
g. 



the 
height 
of 
Saturn, 
or 
that 
of 
the 
fixed 
Stars, 
very 
small 
errors 
made 
by 
the 
Observator, 
with 
the 
instrument, 
render 
the 
scituation 
determinate 
and 
possible, 
infinite 
& 
impossible. 
This 
doth 
not 
so 
evene 
in 
the 
sublunary 
distances, 
and 
near 
the 
earth, 
where 
it 
may 
happen 
that 
the 
observation 
by 
which 
the 
Star 
is 
collected 
to 
be 
remote 
v. 
g. 
4. 
Semidiameters 
terrestrial, 
may 
encrease 
or 
diminish, 
not 
onely 
one 
minute 
but 
ten, 
and 
an 
hundred, 
and 
many 
more, 
without 
being 
rendred 
by 
the 
calculation 
either 
infinitely 
remote, 
or 
so 
much 
as 
superior 
to 
the 
Moon. 
You 
may 
hence 
comprehend 
that 
the 
greatnesse 
of 
the 
error 
(to 
so 
speak) 
instrumental, 
are 
not 
to 
be 
valued 
by 
the 
event 
of 
the 
calculation, 
but 
by 
the 
quantity 
it 
self 
of 
degrees 
and 
minutes 
numbred 
upon 
the 
instrument, 
and 
these 
observations 
are 
to 
be 
called 
more 
just 
or 
less 
erroneous, 
which 
with 
the 
addition 
or 
substraction 
of 
fewer 
minutes, 
restore 
the 
star 
to 
a 
possible 
situation; 
and 
amongst 
the 
possible 
places, 
the 
true 
one 
may 
be 
believed 
to 
have 
been 
that, 
about 
which 
a 
greater 
numberofdistances

SIMP. 


I 
do 
not 
very 
well 
apprehend 
this 
which 
you 
say: 
nor 
can 
I 
of 
my 
self 
conceive 
how 
it 
can 
be, 
that 
in 
greater 
distances, 
greater 
exorbitancies 
can 
arise 
from 
the 
errour 
of 
one 
minute 
only, 
than 
in 
the 
smaller 
from

You

not 
Theorically, 
yet 
at

Practically, 
by 
this 
short 
assumption, 
that 
I 
have 
made 
of 
all 
the 
combinations, 
and 
of 
part 
of 
the

pretermitted

I

refreshed 
my

both 
those

but 
truth 
is, 
make 
these 
supputations 
with 
great 
brevity; 
and, 
if 
I 
may 
speak 
the 
truth, 
I 
have 
much 
admired, 
that 
this

goeth 
so 
farre 
about,

introduceth 
so 
many 
computations 
no

necessary 
to 
the

in

And 
for 
a 
full 
knowledge 
of 
this, 
and 
also 
to 
the 
end 
it 
may 
soon 
be 
seen, 
how 
that 
from 
the 
observations 
of 
the 
Astronomers, 
whereof 
this 
Author 
makes 
use, 
it 
is 
more 
probably 
gathered, 
that 
the

have 
been 
above 
the

also 
above 
all 
the

Now 
to 
see 
my 
whole 
proceeding, 
we 
may 
begin 
from 
these 
calculations, 
which 
are 
four, 
omitted 
by 
the 
Author, 
perhaps 
because 
they 
make 
against 
him, 
in 
regard 
they 
place 
the 
star 
above 
the 
moon 
by 
many 
semidiameters 
of 
the 
Earth. 
The 
first 
of 
which 
is 
this, 
computed 
upon 
the 
observations 
of 
the 
Landgrave 
of 
Hassia, 
and 
Tycho; 
which 
are, 
even 
by 
the 
Authors 
concession, 
two 
ofthemostexactobservers:andinthis 
first,Iwill 
declare 
theorderthatI 
hold 
in 
the 
working; 
which 
shall 
serve 
for 
all 
the 
rest, 
in 
that 
they 
are 
all 
made 
by 
the 
same 
rule, 
not 
varying 
in 
any 
thing, 
save 
in 
the 
quantity 
of 
the 
given 
summes, 
that 
is, 
in 
the 
number 
of 
the 
degrees 
of 
the 
Poles 
altitude, 
and 
of 
the 
new 
Stars 
elevation 
above 
the 
Horizon, 
the 
distance 
of 
which 
from 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
semidiameter 
of 
the 
terrestrial 
Globe 
is 
sought, 
touching 
which 
it 
nothing 
imports 
in 
this 
case, 
to 
know 
how 
many 
miles 
that 
semidiameter 
conteineth; 
whereupon 
the 
resolving 
that, 
and 
the 
distance 
of 
places 
where 
the 
observations 
were 
made, 
as 
this 
Author 
doth, 
is 
but 
time 
and 
labour 
lost; 
nor 
do 
I 
know 
why 
he 
hath 
made 
the 
same, 
and 
especially 
why 
at 
the 
last 
he 
goeth 
about 
to 
reduce 
the 
miles 
found, 
into 
semidiametersoftheTerrestrialGlobe. 


SIMP. 


Perhaps 
he 
doth 
this 
to 
finde 
with 
such 
small 
measures, 
and 
with 
their 
fractions 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
Star 
terminated 
to 
three 
or 
four 
inches; 
for 
we 
that 
donotunderstandyour 
rulesofArithmetick,arestupifiedinhearingyour 
conclusions; 
as 
for 
instance, 
whilst 
we 
read; 
Therefore 
the 
new 
Star 
or 
Comet 
was 
distant 
from 
the 
Earths 
centre 
three 
hundred 
seventy 
and 
three 
thousand 
eight 
hundred 
and 
seven 
miles; 
and 
moreover, 
two 
hundred 
and 
eleven, 
four 
thousand 
ninety 
sevenths 
373807 
21 
/4097, 
and 
upon 
these 
precise 
punctualities, 
wherein 
you 
take 
notice 
of 
such 
small 
matters, 
we 
do 
conceive 



it 
to 
be 
impossible, 
that 
you, 
who 
in 
our 
calculations 
keep 
an 
account 
of 
an 
inch, 
canatthe 
close 
deceiveussomuchasan 
hundredmiles. 


SALV. 


This 
your 
reason 
and 
excuse 
would 
passe 
for 
currant, 
if 
in 
a 
distance 
of 
thousands 
ofmiles, 
a 
yard 
overorunderwere 
of 
any 
greatmoment, 
and 
if 
the 
suppositions 
that 
we 
take 
for 
true, 
were 
so 
certain, 
as 
that 
they 
could 
assure 
us 
of 
producing 
an 
indubitable 
truth 
in 
the 
conclusion; 
but 
here 
you 
see 
in 
the 
twelve 
workings 
of 
the 
Author, 
the 
distances 
of 
the 
Star, 
which 
from 
them 
one 
mayconcludetohavebeendifferent 
fromeachother,(andtherefore 
wide 
of 
the 
truth) 
for 
many 
hundreds 
and 
thousands 
of 
miles: 
now 
whilst 
that 
I 
am 
more 
than 
certain, 
that 
that 
which 
I 
seek 
must 
needs 
differ 
from 
the 
truth 
by 
hundreds 
of 
miles, 
to 
what 
purppse 
is 
it 
to 
be 
so 
curious 
in 
our 
calculations, 
for 
fear 
of 
missing 
the 
quantity 
of 
an 
inch? 
But 
let 
us 
proceed, 
at 
last, 
to 
the 
working, 
which 
I 
resolve 
in 
this 
manner. 
Tycho, 
as 
may 
be 
seen 
in 
that 
same 
note 
observed 
the 
star 
in 
the 
polar 
altitude 
of 
55 
degrees 
and 
58

And 
the 
polar 
altitude 
of 
the 
Landgrave 
was 
51 
degrees 
and 
18 
mi. 
pri. 
The 
altitude 
of 
the 
star 
in 
the

taken 
by 
Tycho

and 
the

And 
because 
the 
angle 
BAD, 
conteined 
between 
the 
vertical 
lines, 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
difference 
of 
the 
Polar 
altitudes, 
it 
shall 
be

which 
I 
note 
here 
apart; 
and 
I 
finde 
the

the

of

and

and 
set 
it

it, 
which 
is 
8142 
parts, 
of 
which 
the 
semidiameter 
AB 
is 
100000. 
Next, 
I 
finde 
the 
angle 
BDC 
with 
ease, 
for 
the 
half 
of 
the 
angle 
BAD, 
which 
is 
2gr. 
20 
m. 
added 
to 
a

giveth 
the 
angle 
BDF

to 
which 
adding 
the 
angle 
CDF, 
which 
is 
the 
distance 
from 
the 
vertical 
point 
of 
the 
greatest 
altitude 
of 
the 
Star, 
which 
here 
is 
62 
gr. 
15 
m. 
it 
giveth 
us 
the 
quantity 
of 
the 
angle 
BDC, 
154 
grad. 
45 
min. 
thewhichIsetdowntogetherwith 
itsSine, 
takenoutof 
the 
Table, 
which 
is

and 
under 
this 
I 
note 
the 
angle 
of 
the 
Parallax 
BCD 
0 
gr. 
2 
m. 
with 
its 
Sine 
58. 
And 
because 
in 
the 
Triangle 
BCD, 
the 
side 
DB 
is 
to 
the 
side 
BC; 
as 
the 
sine 
of 
the 
opposite 
angle 
BCD, 
to 
the 
sine 
of 
the 
opposite 
angle 
BDC: 
therefore, 
if 
the 
line 
BD 
were 
58. 
BC 
would 
be 
42657. 
And 
because 
the 
Chord 
DB 
is 
8142. 
of 
those 
parts 
whereof 
the 
semidiameter 
BA 
is 
100000. 
and 
we 
seek 
to 
know 
how 
many 
of 
those 
parts 
is 
BC; 
therefore 
we 
will 
say, 
by 
the 
Golden 
Rule, 
if 
when 
BD 
is 
58. 
BG 
is 
42657. 
in 
case 
the 
said 
DB 
were 
8142. 
how 
much 
would 
BC 
be? 
I 
multiply 
the 
second 
term 
by 
the 
third, 
and 
the 
product 
is 
347313294. 
which 
ought 
to 
be 
divided 
by 
the 
first, 
namely, 
by 
58. 
and 
the 
quotient 
shall 
be 
the 
number 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
line 
BC, 
whereof 
the 
semidiameter 
AB 
is 
100000. 
And 
to 
know 
how 
many 
semidiametersBA, 
the 
said 
line 
BC 
dothcontein, 
itwillbe 
necessaryanew 
to 
divide 
the 
said 
quotient 
so 
found 
by 
100000. 
and 
we 
shall 
have 
the 
number 
of 
semidiameters 
conteined 
in 
BC. 
Now 
the 
number 
347313294. 
divided 
by 
58. 
giveth 
5988160¼. 
as 
hereyou 
maysee. 


Andthisdividedby

theproductis59 
88160/100000 


But 
we 
may 
much 
abbreviate 
the 
operation, 
dividing 
the 
first 
quotient 
found, 
that 
is, 
347313294. 
by 
the 
product 
of 
the 
multiplication 
of 
the 
two 
numbers 


58. 
and100000. 
thatis, 

Andthisway 
alsotherewill 
comeforth 
595113294/500 


And 
so 
many 
semidiameters 
are 
contained 
in 
the 
line 
BC, 
to 
which 
one 
being 
added 
for 
the 
line 
AB, 
we 
shall 
have 
little 
lesse 
than 
61. 
semidiameters 
for 
the 
two 
lines 
ABC; 
and 
therefore 
the 
right 
distance 
from 
the 
centre 
A, 
to 
the 
Star 
C, 
shall 
be 
more 
than 
60. 
semidiameters, 
and 
therefore 
it 
is 
superiour 
to 
theMoon, 
according 
to 
Ptolomy, 
more 
than 
27. 
semidiameters, 
and 
according 
to 
Copernicus, 
more 
than 
8. 
supposing 
that 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
Moon 
from 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth 
by 
Copernicus 
his 
account 
is 
what 
the 
Author 
maketh 
it, 
52 
semidiameters. 
With 
this 
same 
working, 
I 
find 
by 
the 
observations 
of 
Camerarius, 
and 
of 
Munosius, 
that 
the 
Star 
was 
situate 
in 
that 
same 
distance, 
to 
wit, 
somewhat 
more 
than 
60. 
semidiameters. 
These 
are 
the 
observations, 
and 
these 
followingnextafterthemthecalculations. 


The 
next 
working 
is 
made 
upon 
two 
observations 
of 
Tycho, 
and 
of 
Munosius, 
from 
which 
the 
Star 
is 
calculated 
to 
be 
distant 
from 
the 
Centre 
of 
the 
Earth 
478 
Semidiametersandmore. 


These 
workings 
following 
make 
the 
Star 
remote 
from 
the 
Centre, 
more 
than 
358 
Semidiameters. 


From 
this 
other 
working 
the 
star 
is 
found 
to 
be 
distant 
from 
the 
centre 
more 
than716. 
semidiameters. 


These 
as 
you 
see 
are 
five 
workings 
which 
place 
the 
star 
very 
much 
above 
the 
Moon. 
And 
here 
I 
desire 
you 
to 
consider 
upon 
that 
particular, 
which 
even 
now 
I 
told 
you, 
namely, 
that 
in 
great 
distances, 
the 
mutations, 
or 
if 
you 
please 
corrections, 
of 
a 
very 
few 
minutes, 
removeth 
the 
star 
a 
very 
great 
way 
farther 
off. 
As 
for 
example, 
in 
the 
first 
of 
these 
workings, 
where 
the 
calculation 
made 
the 
star 
60. 
semidiameters 
remote 
from 
the 
centre, 
with 
the 
Parallax 
of 
2. 
minutes;he 
that 
would 
maintain 
that 
it 
was 
in 
the 
Firmament, 
is 
to 
correct 
in 
the 
observations 
but 
onely 
two 
minutes, 
nay 
lesse, 
for 
then 
the 
Parallax 
ceaseth, 
or 
becommeth 
so 
small, 
that 
it 
removeth 
the 
star 
to 
an 
immense 
distance, 
which 
by 
all 
is 
received 
to 
be 
the 
Firmament. 
In 
the 
second 
indagation, 
or 
working, 
the 
correction 
of 
lesse 
than 
4 
m. 
prim. 
d 
th 
the

In 
the 
third, 
and 
fourth, 
like 
as 
in 
the 
first, 
two 
minutes 
onely 
mount 
the 
star 
even 
above 
the 
Firmament. 
In 
the 
last 
preceding, 
a 
quarter 
of 
a 
minute, 
that 
is 
15. 
seconds, 
gives 
us 
the 
same. 
But 
it 
doth 
not 
so 
occur 
in 
the 



sublunary 
altitudes; 
for 
if 
you 
fancy 
to 
your 
self 
what 
distance 
you 
most 
like, 
and 
go 
about 
to 
correct 
the 
workings 
made 
by 
the 
Authour, 
and 
adjust 
them 
so 
as 
that 
they 
all 
answer 
in 
the

you

to

Do 
you 
assign 
any 
whatsoever 
determinate 
sublunary 
distance 
at 
pleasure 
in 
which 
to

the

with 
small

we 
may 
assertain 
our

whether 
corrections

To

we

be 
that

whilst 
it 
is 
in 
controversie 
between 
him 
and 
Astronomers, 
and 
that 
they 
affirm 
the 
star 
to

SALV. 


Let 
us 
therefore 
take 
the 
seventh 
working 
wrought 
upon 
the 
observations 
of 
Tycho 
and 
Thaddaeus 
Hagecius, 
by 
which 
the 
Authour 
found 
the 
star 
to 
have 
been 
distant 
from 
the 
centre 
32. 
semidiameters, 
which 
situation 
is 
most 
favourable 
to 
his 
purpose; 
and 
to 
give 
him 
all 
advantages, 
let 
us 
moreover 
place 
it 
in 
the 
distance 
most 
disfavouring 
the 
Astronomers, 
which 
is 
to 
situate 
it 
above 
the 
Firmament. 
That 
therefore 
being 
supposed, 
let 
us 
seek 
in 
the 
next 
place 
what 
corrections 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
apply 
to 
his 
other 
11 
workings. 
And 
let 
us 
begin 
at 
the 
first 
calculated 
upon 
the 
observations 
of 
Hainzelius 
and 
Mauroice; 
in 
which 
the 
Authour 
findeth 
the 
distance 
from 
the 
centre 
about 
3. 
semidiameters 
with 
the 
Parallax 
of 
4 
gr. 
42 
m. 
30. 
sec. 
Let 
us 
see 
whether 
by 
withdrawing 
it 
20. 
minutes 
onely, 
it 
will 
rise 
to 
the 
height 
of 



32. 
semidiameters: 
See 
the 
short 
and 
true 
operation. 
Multiply 
the 
sine 
of 
the 
angle 
BDC, 
by 
the 
sine 
of 
the 
chord 
BD, 
and 
divide 
the 
product, 
the 
five 
last 
figures 
being 
cut 
off 
by 
the 
sine 
of 
the 
Parallax, 
and 
the 
quotient 
will 
be 
28. 
semidiameters, 
and 
an 
half, 
so 
that 
though 
you 
make 
a 
correction 
of 
4 
gr. 
22 
min. 
30sec. 
taken 
from 
4 
gr. 
42 
min. 
30 
sec. 
it 
shall 
not 
elevate 
thestar 
to 
the 
altitude 
of 
32. 
semidiameters, 
which 
correction 
for 
Simplicius 
his 
understandingit,is 
of262. 
minutes,andanhalf. 
In 
the 
second 
operation 
made 
upon 
the 
observations 
of 
Hainzelius, 
and 
Sculerus, 
with 
the 
Parallax 
of 
0 
gr. 
8 
min. 
30 
sec. 
the 
star 
is 
found 
in 
the 
height 
of 
25. 
semidiameters 
or 
thereabouts, 
as 
may 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
subsequent 
working. 


And 
bringing 
back 
the 
Parallax 
0 
gr. 
8 
m. 
30 
sec. 
to 
7 
gr. 
7 
m. 
whose 
sine 
is 
204, 
the 
star 
elevateth 
to 
30 
semidiameters 
or 
thereabouts; 
therefore 
the 
correction 
of0gr. 
1mi. 
30 
sec. 
dothnotsuffice. 


Now 
let 
us 
see 
what 
correction 
is 
requisite 
for 
the 
third 
working 
made 
upon 
the 
observations 
of 
Hainzelius 
and 
Tycho, 
which 
rendereth 
the 
star 
about 
19 
semidiameters 
high, 
with 
the 
Parallax 
of 
10 
m. 
pri. 
The 
usual 
angles 
and 
their 
sines, 
and 
chord 
found 
by 
the 
Authour, 
are 
these 
next 
following; 
and 
they 
remove 
the 
star 
(as 
also 
in 
the 
Authours 
working) 
19 
semidiameters 
from 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth. 
It 
is 
necessary 
therefore 
for 
the 
raising 
of 
it, 
to 
diminish 
the 
Parallax 
according 
to 
the 
Rule 
which 
he 
likewise 
observeth 
in 
the 
ninth 
working. 
Let 
us 
therefore 
suppose 
the 
Parallax 
to 
be 
6 
m. 
prim. 
whose 
sine 
is 
175, 
and 
the 
division 
being 
made, 
there 
is 
found 
likewise 
lesse 
than 
31 
semidiameters 
for 
the 
stars 
distance. 
And 
therefore 
the 
correction 
of 
4 
min. 
prim. 
istoolittletoservetheAuthours 
purpose. 


Let 
us 
come 
to 
the 
fourth 
working, 
and 
the 
rest 
with 
the 
same 
rule, 
and 
with 
the 
chords 
and 
sines 
found 
out 
by 
the 
Authour 
himself; 
in 
this 
the 
Parallax 
is 
14 
m. 
prim. 
and 
the 
height 
found 
lesse 
than 
10 
semidiameters, 
and 
diminishing 
the 
Parallax 
from 
14 
min. 
to 
4 
min. 
yet 
neverthelesse 
you 
see 
that 
the 
star 
doth 
not 
elevate 
full 
31 
semidiameters. 
Therefore 
10 
min. 
in 
14 
min. 
dothnotsuffice. 


In 
the 
fifth 
operation 
of 
the 
Authour 
we 
have 
the 
sines 
and 
the 
chord 
as 
you 
see, 
and 
the 
Parallax 
is 
0 
gr. 
42 
m. 
30 
sec. 
which 
rendereth 
the 
height 
of 
the 



star 
about 
4 
semidiameters, 
and 
correcting 
the 
Parallax, 
with 
reducing 
it 
from 
0 
gr. 
42 
m. 
30 
sec. 
to 
0 
gr. 
5 
m. 
onely, 
doth 
not 
suffice 
to 
raise 
it 
to 
so 
much 
as 
28 
semidiameters, 
the 
correction 
therefore 
of 
0 
gr. 
37 
m. 
30 
sec. 
is 
too 
little. 


In 
the 
sixth 
operation 
the 
chord, 
the 
sines 
and 
Parallax 
are 
as 
followeth, 
and 
the 
star 
is 
found 
to 
be 
about 
4. 
semidiameters; 
let 
us 
see 
whether 
it 
will 
be 
reduced, 
abating 
the 
Parallax 
from 
8 
m. 
to 
1 
m. 
onely; 
Here 
is 
the 
operation, 
and 
the 
star 
raised 
but 
to 
27. 
semidiameters 
or 
thereabout; 
therefore 
the 
correction 
of7m. 
in8 
m. 
doth 
not 
suffice. 


In 
the 
eighth 
operation 
the 
chord, 
the 
sines, 
and 
the 
Parallax, 
as 
you 
see, 
are 
these 
ensuing, 
and 
hence 
the 
Authour 
calculates 
the 
height 
of 
the 
star 
to 
be 
1. 
semidiameter 
and 
an 
half, 
with 
the 
Parallax 
of 
43. 
min. 
which 
reduced 
to 
1 
min. 
yet 
notwithstanding 
giveth 
the 
star 
lesse 
remote 
than 
24. 
semidiameters, 
thecorrection 
therefore 
of42. 
min. 
isnotenough. 


Let 
us 
now 
see 
the 
ninth. 
Here 
is 
the 
chord, 
the 
sines 
and 
the 
Parallax 
which 
is 
15 
m. 
From 
whence 
the 
Authour 
calculates 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
star 
from 
the 
superficies 
of 
the 
Earthto 
be 
lesse 
thanaHerethe 
Latine 
version 
is 
erroneous, 
making 
it 
a 
fortieth 
part 
of, 
&c. 
seven 
and 
forteith 
part 
of 
a 
semidiameter, 
but 
this 
is 
an 
errour 
in 
the 
calculation, 
for 
it 
cometh 
forth 
truly, 
as 
we 
shall 
see 
here 
below, 
more 
than 
a 
fifth: 
See 
here 
the 
quotient 
is 
90/4 
, 
which 
is 
more 
thanonefifth. 


That 
which 
the 
Authour 
presently 
after 
subjoyns 
in 
way 
of 
amending 
the 
observations, 
that 
is, 
that 
it 
sufficeth 
not 
to 
reduce 
the 
difference 
of 
Parallax, 
neither 
to 
a 
minute, 
nor 
yet 
to 
the 
eighth 
part 
of 
a 
minute 
is 
true. 
But 
I 
say, 
that 
neither 
will 
the 
tenth 
part 
of 
a 
minute 
reduce 
the 
height 
of 
the 
star 
to 
32. 
semidiameters; 
for 
the 
sine 
of 
the 
tenth 
part 
of 
a 
minute, 
that 
is 
of 
six 
seconds, 
is 
3; 
by 
which 
if 
we 
according 
to 
our 
Rule 
should 
divide 
90. 
or 
we 
may 
say, 
if 
we 
should 
divide 
9058672. 
by 
300000. 
the 
quotient 
will 
be 
30 
58671/100000, 
thatislittlemorethan30. 
semidiameters 
andanhalf. 


Thetenth

onefifth

these 
angles, 
sines, 
and 
Parallax, 
that 
is, 
4 
gr. 
30 
m. 
which 
I 
see 
that 
being 
reduced 
from 
4 
gr. 
30 
min. 
to 
2 
min. 
yet 
neverthelesse 
it

not 
the 
star 
to 
29. 
semidiameters. 



The 
eleventh 
rendereth 
the 
star 
to 
the 
Authour 
remote 
about 
13. 
semidiameters, 
with 
the 
Parallax 
of 
55. 
min. 
let 
us 
see, 
reducing 
it 
to 
20 
min. 
whether 
it 
will 
exalt 
the 
star: 
See 
here 
the 
calculation 
elevates 
it 
to 
little 
lesse 
than 
33. 
semidiameters, 
the 
correction 
therefore 
is 
little 
lesse 
than 
35. 
min. 
in 


55. 
min. 
Thetwelfth

it 
carrieth 
the 
star 
to

distance, 
therefore 
the

These 
are 
the 
Corrections 
of 
the 
Parallaxes 
of 
the 
ten 
workings 
of 
the 
Author, 
to 
reduce 
the 
Star 
to 
the

From 
hence 
we 
see, 
that 
to 
reduce 
the 
Star 
to 
32. 
Semidiameters 
in 
altitude, 
it 
is 
requisite 
from 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
Parallaxes 
836. 
to 
subtract 
756. 
and 
to 
reduce 
themto80. 
noryetdoththatcorrectionsuffice. 


Here 
we 
see 
also, 
(as 
I 
have 
noted 
even 
now) 
that 
should 
the 
Authour 
consent 
to 
assign 
the 
distance 
of 
32. 
Semidiameters 
for 
the 
true 
height 
of 
the 
Star, 
the 
correction 
of 
those 
his 
10. 
workings, 
(I 
say 
10. 
because 
the 
second 
being 
very 
high, 
is 
reduced 
to 
the 
height 
of 
32. 
Semidiameters, 
with 
2. 
minutes 
correction) 
to 
make 
them 
all 
to 
restore 
the 
said 
Star 
to 
that 
distance, 
would 
require 
such 
a 
reduction 
of 
Parallaxes, 
that 
amongst 
the 
whole 
number 
of 
substractions 
they 
should 
make 
more 
than 
756 
m. 
pr. 
whereas 
in 
the 
5. 
calculated 
by 
me, 
which 
do 
place 
the 
Star 
above 
the 
Moon, 
to 
correct 
them 
in 



such 
sort, 
as 
to 
constitute 
it 
in 
the 
Firmament, 
the 
correction 
onely 
of 
10. 
minutes,andone 
fourthsufficeth. 


Now 
adde 
to 
these, 
other 
5. 
workings, 
that 
place 
the 
Star 
precisely 
in 
the 
Firmament, 
without 
need 
of 
any 
correction 
at 
all, 
and 
we 
shall 
have 
ten 
workings 
or 
indagations 
that 
agree 
to 
place 
it 
in 
the 
Firmament, 
with 
the 
correction 
onely 
of 
5. 
of 
them 
(as 
hath 
been 
seen) 
but 
10. 
m. 
and 
15 
sec. 
Whereas 
for 
the 
correction 
of 
those 
10. 
of 
the 
Authour, 
to 
reduce 
them 
to 
the 
altitude 
of 
32. 
semidiameters, 
there 
will 
need 
the 
emendations 
of 
756 
minutes 
in 
836. 
that 
is, 
there 
must 
from 
the 
summe 
836 
be 
substracted 
756. 
if 
you 
would 
have 
the 
Star 
elevated 
to 
the 
altitude 
of 
32. 
semidiameters, 
and 
yet 
that 
correction 
dothnotfullyserve. 


The 
workings 
that 
immediately 
without 
any 
correction 
free 
the 
Star 
from 
Parallaxes, 
and 
therefore 
place 
it

Of 
the 
remaining 
combinations 
that 
might 
be 
made 
of 
the 
Observations 
of 
all 
these 
Astronomers, 
those 
that 
make 
the 
Stars 
sublime 
to 
an 
infinite 
distance, 
are 
many 
in 
number, 
namely, 
about 
30. 
more 
than 
those 
who 
give 
the 
Star, 
by 
calculation, 
to 
be 
below 
the 
Moon; 
and 
because 
(as 
it 
was 
agreed 
upon 
between 
us) 
it 
is 
to 
be 
believed 
that 
the 
Observators 
have 
erred 
rather 
little 
than 
much, 
it 
is 
a 
manifest 
thing 
that 
the 
corrections 
to 
be 
applied 
to 
the 
Observaations, 
which 
make 
the 
star 
of 
an 
infinite 
altitude, 
to 
reduce 
it 
lower, 
do 
sooner, 
and 
with 
lesser 
amendment 
place 
it 
in 
the 
Firmament, 
than 
beneath

Moon; 
so 
that 
all 
these 
applaud 
the 
opinion 
of 
those 
who 
put 
it 
amongst 
the 
fixed 
Stars. 
You 
may 
adde, 
that 
the 
corrections 
required 
for 
those 
emendations, 
are 
much 
lesser 
than 
those, 
by 
which 
the 
Star 
from 
an 
unlikely 
proximity 
may 
be 
removed 
to 
the 
height 
more 
favourable 
for 
this 



Authour, 
as 
by 
the 
foregoing 
examples 
hath 
been 
seen; 
amongst 
which 
impossible 
proximities, 
there 
are 
three 
that 
seem 
to 
remove 
the 
Star 
from 
the 
Earths 
centre, 
a 
lesse 
distance 
than 
one 
Semidiameter, 
making 
it, 
as 
it 
were, 
to 
turn 
round 
under 
ground, 
and 
these 
are 
those 
combinations, 
wherein 
the 
Polar 
altitude 
of 
one 
of 
the 
Observators 
being 
greater 
than 
the 
Polar 
altitude 
of 
the 
other, 
the 
elevation 
of 
the 
Star 
taken 
by 
the 
first, 
is 
lesser 
than 
the 
elationof 
theStartaken 
bythelatter. 


The 
first 
of 
these 
is 
this 
of 
the 
Landgrave 
with 
Gemma, 
where 
the 
Polar 
altitude 
of 
the

is 
greater 
than 
the

From 
what 
I 
have 
hitherto 
demonstrated, 
you 
may 
guesse 
how 
much 
this 
first 
way 
of 
finding 
out 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
Star, 
and 
proving 
it 
sublunary 
introduced 
by 
the 
Authour, 
maketh 
against 
himself, 
and 
how 
much 
more 
probably 
and 
clearly 
the 
distance 
thereof 
is 
collected 
to 
have 
been 
amongst 
themoreremotefixedStars. 


SIMP. 


As 
to 
this 
particular, 
I 
think 
that 
the 
inefficacy 
of 
the 
Authors 
demonstrations 
is 
very 
plainly 
discovered; 
But 
I 
see 
that 
all 
this 
was 
comprised 
in 
but 
a 
few 
leaves 
of 
his 
Book, 
and 
it 
may 
be, 
that 
some 
other 
of 
his 
Arguments 
are 
more 
conclusive 
thenthesefirst. 


SALV. 


Rather 
they 
must 
needs 
be 
lesse 
valid, 
if 
we 
will 
take 
those 
that 
lead 
the 
way 
for 
a 
proof 
of 
the 
rest: 
For 
(as 
it 
is 
clear) 
the 
uncertainty 
and 
inconclusivenesse 
of 
those, 
is 
manifestly 
observed 
to 
derive 
it 
self 
from 
the 
errours 
committed 
in 
the 
instrumental 
observations, 
upon 
which 
the 
Polar 
Altitude, 
and 
height 
of 
the 
Star 
was 
thought 
to 
have 
been 
justly 
taken, 
all 
in 
effect 
having 
easily 
erred; 
And 
yet 
to 
find 
the 
Altitude 
of 
the 
Pole, 
Astronomers 
have 
had 
Ages 
of 
time 
to 
apply 
themselves 
to 
it, 
at 
their 
leasure: 
and 
the 
Meridian 
Altitudes 
of 
the 
Star 
are 
easier 
to 
be 
observed, 
as 
being 
most 
terminate, 
and 
yielding 
the 
Observator 
some 
time 
to 
continue 
the 
same, 
in 
regard 
theychange 
notsensibly, 
in 
a 
shorttime,as 
thosedo

Andif 
thisbeso,asitis 
mostcertain,whatcreditshallwe 
give 
to 
Calculations 
founded 
upon 
Observations 
more 
numerous, 
more 
difficult 
to 
be 
wrought, 
more 
momentary 
in 
variation, 
and 
we 
may 
add, 
with 
Instruments 
more 
incommodious 
and 
erroneous? 
Upon 
a 
slight 
perusal 
of 
the 



ensuing 
demonstrations, 
I 
see 
that 
the 
Computations 
are 
made 
upon 
Altitudes 
of 
the 
Star 
taken 
in 
different 
Vertical 
Circles, 
which 
are 
called 
by 
the 
Arabick 
name, 
Azimuths; 
in 
which 
observations 
moveable 
instruments 
are 
made 
use 
of, 
not 
only 
in 
the 
Vertical 
Circles, 
but 
in 
the 
Horizon 
also, 
at 
the 
same 
time; 
insomuch 
that 
it 
is 
requisite 
in 
the 
same 
moment 
that 
the 
altitude 
is 
taken, 
to 
have 
observed, 
in 
the 
Horizon, 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
Virtical 
point 
in 
which 
the 
Star 
is, 
from 
the 
Meridian; 
Moreover, 
after 
a 
considerable 
interval 
of 
time, 
the 
operation 
must 
be 
repeated, 
and 
exact 
account 
kept 
of 
the 
time 
that 
passed, 
trusting 
either 
to 
Dials, 
or 
to 
other 
observations 
of 
the 
Stars. 
Such 
an 
Olio 
of 
Observations 
doth 
he 
set 
befo 
you, 
comparing 
them 
with 
such 
another 
made 
by 
another 
observer 
in 
another 
place 
with 
another 
different 
instrument, 
and 
at 
another 
time; 
and 
from 
this 
the 
Authour 
seeks 
to 
collect 
what 
would 
have 
been, 
the 
Elevations 
of 
the 
Star, 
and 
Horizontal 
Latitudes 
happened

hourofthe 
other 
first 
observations,and 
uponsuch 
a 
coaequation 
he 
in 
the 
end 
grounds 
his 
account. 
Now 
I 
refer 
it 
to 
you, 
what 
credit 
is 
to 
be 
given 
to 
that 
which 
is 
deduced 
from 
such 
like 
workings. 
Moreover, 
I 
doubt 
not 
in 
the 
least, 
but 
that 
if 
any 
one 
would 
torture 
himself 
with 
such 
tedious 
computations, 
he 
would 
find, 
as 
in 
those 
aforegoing, 
that 
there 
were 
more 
that 
would 
favour 
the 
adverse 
party, 
than 
the 
Authour: 
But 
I 
think 
it 
not 
worth 
the 
while 
to 
take 
so 
much 
pains 
in 
a 
thing, 
which 
is 
not, 
amongstthose 
primaryones,byus

SAGR. 


I 
am 
of 
your 
Opinion 
in 
this 
particular: 
But 
this 
businesse 
being 
environed 
with 
so 
many 
intricacies, 
uncertainties, 
and 
errours, 
upon 
what 
confidence 
have 
so 
many 
Astronomers 
positively 
pronounced 
the 
new 
Star 
to 
have 
been 
sohigh? 


SALV. 


Upon 
two 
sorts 
of 
observations 
most 
plain, 
most 
easie, 
and 
most 
certain; 
one 
only 
of 
which 
is 
more 
than 
sufficient 
to 
assure 
us, 
that 
it 
was 
scituate 
in 
the 
Firmament, 
or 
at 
least 
by 
a 
great 
distance 
superiour 
to 
the 
Moon. 
One 
of 
which 
is 
taken 
from 
the 
equality, 
or 
little 
differing 
inequality 
of 
its 
distances 
fromthePole, 
aswellwhilst 
itwasinthelowestpartoftheMeridian, 
aswhen 
it 
was 
in 
the 
uppermost: 
The 
other 
is 
its 
having 
perpetually 
kept 
the 
same 
distances 
from 
certain 
of 
the 
fixed 
Stars, 
adjacent 
to 
it, 
and 
particularly 
from 



the 
eleventh 
of 
Cassiopea, 
no 
more 
remote 
from 
it 
than 
one 
degree 
and 
an 
half; 
from 
which 
two 
particulars 
is 
undoubtedly 
inferred, 
either 
the 
absolute 
want 
of 
Parallax, 
or 
such 
a 
smalnesse 
thereof,

it

Andfirst,thatwhich

the 
Polar 
distances 
of 
the 
Observators 
one 
by 
one, 
I 
have 
noted 
down 
in 
these 
brief 
Calculations; 
For 
a 
full 
understanding 
of 
which, 
I 
ought 
first 
to 
advertise 
you, 
that 
when 
ever 
the 
new 
Star, 
or 
other 
Phaenomenon 
is 
near 
to 
the 
earth, 
turning 
with 
a 
Diurnal 
motion 
about 
the 
Pole, 
it 
will 
seem 
to 
be 
farther 
off 
from 
the 
said 
Pole, 
whilst 
it 
is 
in 
the 
lower 
part 
of 
the 
Meridian, 
then 
whilst 
it 
is 
above, 
as 
in 
this 
Figure 
[being 
fig. 
third 
of 
this 
Dial. 
] 
may 
be 
seen. 
In 
which 
the 
point 
T. 
denotes 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth; 
O. 
the 
place 
of 
the 
Observator; 
the 
Arch 
VPC 
the 
Firmament; 
P. 
the 
Pole. 
The 
Phaenomenon, 
[or 
appearance] 
moving 
along 
the 
Circle 
FS. 
is 
seen 
one 
while 
under 
the 
Pole 
by 
the 
Ray 
OFC. 
and 
another 
while 
above, 
according 
to 
the 
Ray 
OSD. 
so 
that 
the 
places 
seen 
in 
the 
Firmament 
are 
D. 
and 
C. 
but 
the 
true 
places 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
Centre 
T, 
are 
B, 
and 
A, 
equidistant 
from 
the 
Pole. 
Where 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
the 
apparent 
place 
of 
the 
Phaenomenon 
S, 
that 
is 
the 
point 
D, 
is 
nearer 
to 
the 
Pole 
than 
the 
other 
apparent 
place 
C, 
seen 
along 
the 
Line 
or 
Ray 
OFC, 
which 
is 
the 
first 
thing 
to 
be 
noted. 
In 
the 
second 
place 
you 
must 
note 
that 
the 
exces 
of 
the 
apparent 
inferiour 
distance 
from 
the 
Pole, 
over 
and 
above 
the 
apparent 
superiour 
distance 
from 
the 
said 
Pole, 
is 
greater 
than 
the 
Inferiour 
Parallax 
of 
the 
Phaenomenon, 
that 
is, 
I 
say, 
that 
the 
excesse 
of 
the 
Arch 
CP, 
(the 
apparent 
inferior 
distance) 
over 
and 
above 
the 
Arch 
PD, 
(the 
apparent 
superior 
distance) 
is 
greater 
then 
the 
Arch 
CA, 
(that 
is 
the 
inferiour 
Paralax.) 
Which 
is 
easily 
proved; 
for 
the 
Arch 
CP. 
more 
exceedeth 
PD, 
then 
PB; 
PB, 



being 
bigger 
than 
PD, 
but 
PB. 
is 
equal 
to 
PA, 
and 
the 
excesse 
of 
CP, 
above 
PA, 
is 
the 
arch, 
CA, 
therefore 
the 
excesse 
of 
the 
arch 
CP 
above 
the 
arch 
PD, 
is 
greater 
than 
the 
arch 
CA, 
which 
is 
the 
parallax 
of 
the 
Phaenomenon 
placed 
inF,whichwas 
tobedemonstrated. 
Andto 
givealladvantages 
totheAuthor, 
let 
us 
suppose 
that 
the 
parallax 
of 
the 
star 
in 
F, 
is 
the 
whole 
excesse 
of 
the 
arch 
CP 
(that 
is 
of 
the 
inferiour 
distance 
from 
the 
pole) 
above 
the 
arch 
PD 
(the 
inferiour 
distance.) 
I 
proceed 
in 
the 
next 
place 
to 
examine 
that 
which 
the 
observations 
of 
all 
Astronomers 
cited 
by 
the 
Authour 
giveth 
us, 
amongst 
which, 
there 
is 
not 
one 
that 
maketh 
not 
against 
himself 
and 
his 
purpose. 
And 
let 
us 
begin 
with 
these 
of 
Buschius, 
who 
findeth 
the 
stars 
distance 
from 
the 
pole, 
when 
it 
was 
superiour, 
to 
be 
28 
gr. 
10 
m. 
and 
the 
inferiour 
to 
be 
28 
gr. 
30 
m. 
so 
that 
the 
excesse 
is 
0 
gr. 
20 
m. 
which 
let 
us 
take 
(in 
favour 
of 
the 
Author) 
as 
if 
it 
all 
were 
the 
parallax 
of 
the 
star 
in 
F, 
that 
is 
the 
angle 
TFO. 
Then 
the 
distance 
from 
the 
Vertex 
[or 
Zenith] 
that 
is 
the 
arch 
CV, 
is 
67 
gr. 
20 


m. 
These 
two 
things 
being 
found, 
prolong 
the 
line 
CO, 
and 
from 
it 
let 
fall 
the 
perpendicular 
TI, 
and 
let 
us 
consider 
the 
triangle 
TOI, 
of 
which 
the 
angle 
I 
is 
right 
angle, 
and 
the 
angle 
IOT 
known, 
as 
being 
vertical 
to 
the 
angle 
VOC, 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
star 
from 
the 
Vertex, 
Moreover 
in 
the 
triangle 
TIF, 
which 
is 
also 
rectangular, 
there 
is 
known 
the 
angle 
F, 
taken 
by 
the 
parallax. 
Then 
note 
in 
some 
place 
apart 
the 
two 
angles 
IOT 
and 
IFT, 
and 
of 
them 
take 
the 
sines, 
which 
are 
here 
set 
down 
to 
them, 
as 
you 
seen. 
And 
because 
in 
the 
triangle 
IOT, 
the 
sine 
TI 
is 
92276. 
of 
those 
parts, 
whereof 
the 
whole 
sine 
TO 
is 
100000; 
and 
moreover 
in 
the 
triangle 
IFT, 
the 
sine 
TI 
is 
582. 
of 
those 
parts, 
whereof 
the 
whole 
sine 
TF 
is 
100000, 
to 
find 
how 
many 
TF 
is 
of 
those 
parts, 
whereof 
TO 
is 
100000; 
we 
will 
say 
by 
the 
Rule 
of 
three: 
If 
TI 
be 
582. 
TF 
is 
an 
100000. 
but 
if 
T 
I 
were 
92276. 
how 
much 
would 
T 
F 
be. 
Let 
us 
multiply 
92276. 
by 
100000. 
and 
the 
product 
will 
be 
9227600000. 
and 
this 
must 
be 
divided 
by 
582. 
and 
the 
quotient 
will 
be 
15854982. 
and 
so 
many 
shall 
there 
be 
in 
TF 
of 
those 
parts, 
of 
which 
there 
are 
in 
TO 
an 
100000. 
So 
that 
if 
it 
were 
required 
to 
know 
how 
many 
lines 
TO, 
are 
in 
TF, 
we 
would 
divide 
15854982 
by 
100000. 
and 
there 
will 
comeforth 
158. 
andvery 
near 
anhalf; 
and 
so 
many 
diameters 
shall 
be 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
star 
F, 
from 
the 
centre 
T, 
and 
to 
abreviate 
the 
operation, 
we 
seeing, 
that 
the 
product 
of 
the 
multiplication 
of 
92276. 
by 
100000, 
ought 
to 
be 
divided 
first 
by 
582, 
and 
then 
the 
quotient 
of 
that 
division 
by 
100000. 
we 
may

From

following 
observation 
of 
the 
Landgrave, 
the

Two 
of 
the 
most 
favourable 
observations 
for 
the 
Authour 
being 
taken 
from 
Camerarius, 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
Star 
from 
the

is 
found 
to 
be 
3143 
Semidiameters. 


The 
Observation 
of 
Munosius 
giveth 
no 
Parallax, 
and 
therefore 
rendreth 
the 
new 
Star 
amongst 
the 
highest 
of 
the 
fixed. 
That 
of 
Hainzelius 
makes 
it 
infinitely 
remote,

with 
the 
correction 
of 
an 
half 
min. 
prim. 
placeth 
it

And 
the 
same

collected 
from 
Vrsinus, 
with 
the 
correction 
of 
12.

prim. 
The 
other 
Astronomers 
have 
not 
give 
us 
the 
distance 
above 
and 
below 
the 
Pole, 
so 
that 
nothing 
can 
be 
concluded 
from 
them. 
By 
this

Butwhatdefence

SALV. 


He 
betakes 
himself 
to 
one 
of 
those 
weak 
threads 
which 
I 
speak 
of; 
saying 
that 
the 
Parallaxes 
come 
to 
be 
lessened 
by 
means 
of 
the 
refractions, 
which 
opperating 
contrarily 
sublimate 
the 
Phaenomenon, 
whereas 
the 
Parallaxes 
abase 
it. 
Now 
of 
what 
little 
stead 
this 
lamentable 
refuge 
is, 
judge 
by 
this, 
that 
in 
case 
that 
effect 
of 
the 
refractions 
were 
of 
such 
an 
efficacy, 
as 
that 
which 
not 
long 
time 
since 
some 
Astronomers 
have 
introduced, 
the 
most 
that 
they 
could 
work 
touching 
the 
elevating 
a 
Phaeuomenon 
above 
the 
Horizon 
more 
than 
truth, 
when 
it 
is 
before 
hand 
23. 
or 
24. 
Degrees 
high, 
would 
be 
the 
lessening 
its 
Parallax 
about 
3. 
minutes, 
the 
which 
abatement 
is 
too 
small 
to 
pull 
down 
the 
Star 
below 
the 
Moon, 
and 
in 
some 
cases 
is 
lesse 
than 
the 
advantage 
given 
him 
by 
us 
in 
admitting 
that 
the 
excesse 
of 
the 
inferiour 
distance 
from 
the 
Pole 
above 
the 
Superiour, 
is 
all 
Parallax, 
the 
which 
advantage 
is 
far 
more 
clear 
and 
palpable 
than 
the 
effect 
of 
Refracton, 
of 
the 
greatnesse 
of 
which 
I 
stand 
in 
doubt, 
and 
not 
without 
reason. 
But 
besides, 
I 
demand 
of 
the 
Author, 
whether 
he 
thinks 
that 
those 
Astronomers, 
of 
whose 
observations 
he 
maketh 
use, 
had 
knowledge 
of 
these 
effects 
of 
Refractions, 
and 
considered 
the 
same, 
or 
no; 
if 
they 
did 
know 
and 
consider 
them, 
it 
is 
reasonable 
to 
think 
that 
the, 
kept 
account 
of 
them 
in 
assigning 
the 
true 
Elevationofthe 
Star, 
makinginthose 
degreesof 
Attitudediscoveredwiththe 
Instruments, 
such 
abatements 
as 
were 
convenient 
on 
the 
account 
of 
the 
alterations 
made 
by 
the 
Refractions; 
insomuch 
that 
the 
distances 
by 
them 
delivered, 
were 
in 
the 
end 
those 
corrected 
and 
exact, 
and 
not 
the 
apparent 
and 
falseones. 
ButifhethinkthatthoseAuthors 
made 
noreflection 
uponthesaid 
Refractions, 
it 
must 
be 
confessed, 
that 
they 
had 
in 
like 
manner 
erred 
in 
determining 
all 
those 
things 
which 
cannot 
be 
perfectly 
adjusted 
without 
allowance 
for 
the 
Refractions; 
amongst 
which 
things 
one 
is 
the 
precise 
investigation 
of 
the 
Polar 
Altitudes, 
which 
are 
commonly 
taken 
from 
the 
two 
Meridian 
Altitudes 
of 
some 
of 
the 
fixed 
Stars 
that 
are 
constantly 
visible, 
which 
Altitudes 
will 
come 
to 
be 
altered 
by 
Refraction 
in 
the 
same 
manner, 
just 
as 
those 
of 
the 
new 
Star; 
so 
that 
the 
Polar 
Altitude 
that 
is 
deduced 
from 
them, 
will 
prove 
to 
be 
defective, 
and 
to 
partake 
of 
the 
self 
same 
want 
which 
this 
Author 
assigns 
to 
the 
Altitudes 
ascribed 
to 
the 
new 
Star, 
to 
wit, 
both 
that 
and 
these 
will 
be 
with 
equal 
falshood 
placed 
higher 
than 
really 
they 
are. 
But 



any 
such 
errour, 
as 
far 
as 
concerns 
our 
present 
businesse, 
doth 
no 
prejudce 
at 
all: 
For 
we 
not 
needing 
to 
know 
any 
more, 
but 
onely 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
two 
distances 
of 
the 
new 
Star 
from 
the 
Pole 
at 
such 
time 
as 
it 
was 
inferiour 
and 
superiour, 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
such 
distances 
would 
be 
the 
same, 
taking 
the 
alteration 
of 
Refraction 
commonly 
for 
the 
Star 
and 
for 
the 
Pole, 
or 
for 
them 
when 
commonly 
amended. 
The 
Authors 
Argument 
would 
indeed 
have 
had 
some 
strength, 
though 
very 
small, 
if 
he 
had 
assured 
us 
that 
the 
Altitude 
of 
the 
Pole 
had 
been 
once 
precisely 
assigned, 
and 
corrected 
from 
the 
errour 
depending 
on 
refraction, 
from 
which 
again 
the 
Astronomers 
had 
not 
kept 
themselves 
in 
assigning 
the 
altitudes 
of 
the 
new 
Star; 
but 
he 
hath 
not 
ascertained 
us 
of 
that, 
nor 
perhaps 
could 
he 
have 
done, 
nor 
haply, 
(and 
this 
is 
moreprobable)was 
thatcautionwantingintheObservators. 


SAGR. 


This 
argument 
is 
in 
my 
judgment 
sufficiently 
answered; 
therefore 
tell 
me 
how 
he 
dis-ingageth 
himself 
in 
the 
next 
place 
from 
that 
particular 
of 
the 
Stars 
having 
constantly 
kept 
the 
same 
distance 
from 
the 
fixed 
Stars 
circumjacent 
to 
it. 


SALV. 


He 
betakes 
himself, 
in 
like 
manner, 
to 
two 
threads, 
yet 
more 
unable 
to 
uphold 
him 
than 
the 
former: 
one 
of 
which 
is 
likewise 
fastened 
to 
refraction, 
but 
so 
much 
less 
firmly, 
in 
that 
he 
saith, 
that 
refraction 
operating 
upon 
the 
new 
Star, 
and 
sublimating 
it 
higher 
than 
its 
true 
situation, 
maketh 
the 
seeming 
distances 
untain 
to 
be 
distinguished 
from 
the 
true, 
when 
compared 
to 
the 
circumposed 
fixed 
Stars 
that 
environ 
it. 
Nor 
can 
I 
sufficiently 
admire 
how 
he 
can 
dissemble 
his 
knowing 
how 
that 
the 
same 
refraction 
will 
work 
alike 
upon 
the 
new 
Star, 
as 
upon 
the 
antient 
one 
its 
neighbour, 
elevating 
both 
equally, 
so 
as 
that 
such 
a 
like 
accident 
altereth 
not 
the 
space 
betwixt 
them. 
His 
other 
subterfuge 
is 
yet 
more 
unhappy, 
and 
carryeth 
with 
it 
much 
of 
ridiculous, 
it 
being 
founded 
upon 
the 
errour 
that 
may 
arise 
in 
the 
instrumental 
operation 
it 
self; 
whilst 
that 
the 
Observator 
not 
being 
able 
to 
constitute 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
eyes 
pupil 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Sextant 
(an 
Instrument 
imployed 
in 
observing 
the 
distance 
between 
two 
Stars) 
but 
holding 
it 
elevated 
above 
that 
centre, 
as 
much 
as 
the 
said 
pupil 
is 
distant 
from 
I 
know 
not 
what 
bone 
of 
the 
cheek, 
against 
which 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Instrument 
resteth, 
there 
is 
formed 
in 
the 
eye 
an 



angle 
more 
acute 
than 
that 
which 
is 
made 
by 
the 
sides 
of 
the 
Instrument; 
which 
angle 
of 
rayes 
differeth 
also 
from 
it 
self, 
at 
such 
time 
as 
a 
man 
looketh 
upon 
Stars, 
not 
much 
elevated 
above 
the 
Horizon, 
and 
the 
same 
being 
afterwards 
placed 
at 
a 
great 
height; 
that 
angle, 
saith 
he, 
is 
made 
different, 
while 
the 
Instrument 
goeth 
ascending, 
the 
head 
standing 
still: 
but 
if 
in 
mounting 
the 
Instrument, 
the 
neck 
should 
bend 
backwards, 
and 
the 
head 
go 
rising, 
together 
with 
the 
Instrument, 
the 
angle 
would 
then 
continue 
the 
same. 
So 
that 
the 
Authours 
answer 
supposeth 
that 
the 
Observators 
in 
using 
the 
Instrument 
have 
not 
raised 
the 
head, 
as 
they 
ought 
to 
have 
done; 
a 
thing 
which 
hathnothingoflikelihoodinit. 
Butgrantingthat 
soithadbeen, 
Ileave 
you 
to 
judge 
what 
difference 
can 
be 
between 
two 
acute 
angles 
of 
two 
equicrural 
triangles, 
the 
sides 
of 
one 
of 
which 
triangles 
are 
each 
four 
[Italian] 
Braces 
[i. 
e. 
about 
three 
English 
yards] 
and 
those 
of 
the 
other, 
four 
braces 
within 
the 
quantity 
of 
the 
diameter 
of 
a 
Pea; 
for 
the 
differences 
cannot 
be 
absolutely 
greater 
between 
the 
length 
of 
the 
two 
visive 
rayes, 
whilst 
the 
line 
is 
drawn 
perpendicularly 
from 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
pupil, 
upon 
the 
plain 
of 
the 
Rule 
of 
the 
Sextant 
(which 
line 
is 
no 
bigger 
than 
the 
breath 
of 
the 
thumb) 
and 
the 
length 
of 
the 
same 
rayes, 
whilst 
elevating 
the 
Sextant, 
without 
raising 
the 
head 
together 
with 
it, 
that 
same 
line 
no 
longer 
falleth 
perpendicularly 
upon 
the 
said 
plane, 
but 
inclineth, 
making 
the 
angle 
towards 
the 
circumference 
something 
acute. 
But 
wholly 
to 
free 
this 
Authour 
from 
these 
unhappy 
lies, 
let 
him 
know, 
(in 
regard 
it 
appears 
that 
he 
is 
not 
very 
skilful 
in 
the 
use 
of 
Astronomicall 
Instruments) 
that 
in 
the 
sides 
of 
the 
Sextant

there 
are 
placed 
twoTraguardi. 
Sights, 
one

the 
opposite 
end, 
which 
are 
raised 
an 
inch 
or 
more 
above 
the 
plane 
of 
the

and 
through 
the 
tops 
of 
those 
sights 
the 
ray 
of 
the 
eye 
is 
made 
to 
passe, 
which 
eye 
likewise 
is 
held 
an 
hands 
breadth 
or 
two, 
or 
it 
may 
be 
more, 
from 
the 
Instrument; 
so 
that 
neither 
the 
pupil, 
nor 
any 
bone 
of 
the 
cheek, 
nor 
of 
the 
whole 
body 
toucheth 
or 
stayeth 
it 
self 
upon 
the 
Instrument, 
nor 
much 
lesse 
is 
the 
Instrument 
upheld 
or 
mounted 
in 
the 
armes, 
especially 
if 
it 
be 
one 
of 
those 
great 
ones, 
as 
is 
usual, 
which 
weighing 
tens, 
hundreds, 
and 
also 
thousands

are 
placed

very 
strong

so

vanisheth. 
These

Truly, 
this 
Authour 
came 
out 
too 
slenderly 
provided 
with 
armes 
against 
the 
assailants 
of 
the 
Heavens 
inalterability, 
and 
with 
too 
brittle 
a 
chain 
attempted 
to 
pull 
down 
the 
new 
star 
of 
Cassiopeia 
from 
the 
highest 
Regions, 
to 
these 
so 
low 
and 
elementary. 
And 
for 
that 
I 
think 
that 
we 
have 
sufficiently 
demonstrated 
the 
vast 
difference 
that 
is 
between

that 
we 
leave 
this 
particular, 
and 
return 
to 
our 
principal 
matter; 
in 
which 
there 
presents 
it 
self 
to 
our 
consideration 
the 
annual 
motion 
commonly 
ascribed 
to 
the 
Sun, 
but 
by 
Aristarchus 
Samius 
first 
of 
all, 
and 
after 
by 
Copernicus 
taken 
from 
the 
Sun, 
and 
transferred 
upon 
the 
Earth; 
against 
which 
Hypothesis, 
methinks 
I 
see 
Simplicius 
to 
come 
strongly 
provided, 
and 
particularly 
with 
the 
sword 
and 
buckler 
of 
the 
little 
Treatise 
of 
Conclusions, 
or 
Disquisitions 
Mathematical, 
the 
oppugnations 
of 
which 
it 
would 
be 
good 
to 
begin 
to 
produce. 


SIMP. 


I 
will, 
if 
you 
so 
please, 
reserve 
them 
to 
the 
last, 
as 
those 
that 
are 
of 
latest 
invention. 


SALV. 



It 
will 
therefore 
be 
necessary, 
that 
in 
conformity 
to 
the 
method 
hitherto 
observed, 
you 
do 
orderly, 
one 
by 
one, 
propound 
the 
arguments, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
aswell 
of 
Aristotle, 
as 
of 
the 
other 
ancients, 
which 
shall 
be 
my 
task 
also, 
that 
so 
nothing 
may 
escape 
our 
strict 
consideration 
and 
examination; 
and 
likewise 
Sagredus, 
with 
the 
vivacity 
of 
his 
wit, 
shall 
interpose 
his 
thoughts,ashe

SAGR. 


I 
will 
do 
it 
with 
my 
wonted 
freedome; 
and 
your

shall 
oblige 
you 
toexcuse 
me 
insodoing. 


SALV. 


The 
favour 
will 
challenge 
thanks, 
and 
not 
an 
excuse. 
But 
now 
let 
Simplicius 
begin 
to 
propose 
those 
doubts 
which 
disswade 
him 
from 
believing 
that 
the 
Earth, 
in 
like 
manner, 
as 
the 
other 
planets, 
may 
move 
round 
about 
a 
fixed 
centre. 


SIMP. 


The 
first 
and 
greatest 
difficulty 
is 
the 
repugnance 
and 
incompatibility 
that 
is 
between 
being 
in 
the 
centre, 
and 
being 
far 
from 
it; 
for 
if 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
were 
to 
move 
in 
a 
year 
by 
the 
circumference 
of 
a 
circle, 
that 
is, 
under 
the 
Zodiack, 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
it 
should, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
be 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Zodiack; 
but 
that 
the 
Earth 
is 
in 
the 
said 
centre 
Aristotle, 
Ptolomy, 
and 
others 
havemany 
wayesproved. 


SALV. 


You 
very 
well 
argue, 
and 
there 
is 
no 
question 
but 
that 
one 
that 
would 
make 
the 
Earth 
to 
move 
in 
the 
circumference 
of 
a 
circle, 
must 
first 
of 
necessity 
prove, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
that 
same 
circle; 
it 
now 
followeth, 
that 
we 
enquire, 
whether 
the 
Earth 
be, 
or 
benot 
in 
that 
centre, 
about 
which,I 
say, 
that 
it 
turneth, 
and 
you 
say 
that 
it 
is 
fixed; 
and 
before 
we 
speak 
of 
this, 
it 
is 
likewise 
necessary 
that 
we 
declare 
our 
selves, 
whether 
you 
and 
I 
have 
both 
the 
same 
conceit 
of 
this 
centre, 
or 
no. 
Therefore 
tell 
me, 
what 
and 
where 
is 
this 
yourintended 
centre? 



SIMP. 


When 
I 
speak 
of 
the 
centre, 
I 
mean 
that 
of 
the 
Universe, 
that 
of 
the 
World, 
that 
oftheStarrySphere. 


SALV. 


Although 
I 
might 
very 
rationally 
put 
it 
in 
dispute, 
whether 
there 
be 
any 
such 
centre 
in 
nature, 
In 
hath 
not 
been 
hitherto 
proved 
by 
any, 
whether 
the 
World 
be 
finite 
or 
infinite. 
or 
no; 
being 
that 
neither 
you 
nor 
any 
one 
else 
hath 
ever 
proved, 
whether 
the 
World 
be 
finite 
and 
figurate, 
or 
else 
infinite 
and 
interminate;yet 
nevertheless 
granting 
you, 
for 
the 
present,that 
it 
is 
finite, 
and 
of 
a 
terminateSpherical 
Figure, 
and 
that 
thereuponit 
hathits 
centre;it 
will 
be 
requisite 
to 
see 
how 
credible 
it 
is 
that 
the 
Earth, 
and 
not 
rather 
some 
other 
body,dothpossesse 
the 
saidcentre. 


SIMP. 


That 
the 
world 
is 
finite, 
terminate, 
and 
spherical, 
Aristotle 
proveth 
with 
an 
hundreddemonstrations. 


SALV. 


All 
which 
in 
the 
end 
are 
reduced 
to 
one 
alone, 
The 
Demonstrations 
of 
Aristotle 
to 
p 
ove 
that 
the 
Vniverse 
is 
finite, 
are 
all 
nullified 
by 
denying 
it 
to 
be 
moveable. 
and 
that 
one 
to 
none 
at 
all; 
for 
if 
I 
deny 
his 
assumption, 
to 
wit, 
that 
the 
Universe 
is 
moveable, 
all 
his 
demonstrations 
come 
to 
nothing, 
for 
he 
onely 
proveth 
the 
Universe 
to 
be 
finite 
and 
terminate, 
for 
that 
it 
is 
moveable. 
But 
that 
we 
may 
not 
multiply 
disputes, 
let 
it 
be 
granted 
for 
once, 
that 
the 
World 
is 
finite, 
spherical, 
and 
hath 
its 
centre. 
And 
seeing 
that 
that 
centre 
and 
figure 
is 
argued 
from 
its 
mobility, 
it 
will, 
without 
doubt, 
be 
very 
reasonable, 
if 
from 
the 
circular 
motions 
of 
mundane 
bodies 
we 
proceed 
to 
the 
particular 
investigation 
of 
that 
centres 
proper 
place: 
Aristotle 
makes 
that 
point 
to 
be 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Universe 
about 
which 
all 
the 
Celestial 
Spheres 
do 
revolve. 
Nay 
Aristotle 
himself 
hath 
argued 
and 
determined 
in 
the 
same 
manner, 
making 
that 
same 
to 
be 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Universe 
about 
which 
all 
the 
Coelelestial 
Spheres 
revolve, 
and 
in 
which 
he 
beleived 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
to 
have 
been 
placed. 
A 
question 
is 
put, 
in 
case 
that 
if 
Aristotle 
were 
forced 
to 
receive 
one 



of 
two 
propositions 
that 
make 
against 
his 
doctrine, 
which 
he 
would 
admit. 
Now 
tell 
me 
Simplicius, 
if 
Aristotle 
should 
be 
constrained 
by 
evident 
experience 
to 
alter 
in 
part 
this 
his 
disposure 
and 
order 
of 
the 
Universe, 
and 
confesse 
himself 
to 
have 
been 
deceived 
in 
one 
of 
these 
two 
propositions, 
namely, 
either 
in 
placing 
the 
Earth 
in 
the 
centre, 
or 
in 
saying, 
that 
the 
Coelestial 
Spheres 
do 
move 
about 
that 
centre, 
which 
of 
the 
two 
confessions 
thinkyouwouldhe 
choose? 


SIMP. 


Ibelieve,that

SALV. 


I 
do 
not 
ask 
the 
Peripateticks, 
I 
demand 
of 
Aristotle, 
for 
as 
to 
those, 
I 
know 
very 
well 
what 
they 
would 
reply; 
they, 
as 
observant 
and 
humble 
vassals 
of 
Aristotle, 
would 
deny 
all 
the 
experiments 
and 
all 
the 
observations 
in 
the 
World, 
nay, 
would 
also 
refuse 
to 
see 
them, 
that 
they 
might 
not 
be 
forced 
to 
acknowledg 
them, 
and 
would 
say 
that 
the 
World 
stands 
as 
Aristotle 
writeth, 
and 
not 
as 
nature 
will 
have 
it, 
for 
depriving 
them 
of 
the 
shield 
of 
his 
Authority, 
with 
what 
do 
you 
think 
they 
would 
appear 
in 
the 
field? 
Tell 
me 
thereforewhatyouareperswadedAristotlehimselfwoulddo 
inthecase. 


SIMP. 


To 
tell 
you 
the 
truth, 
I 
know 
not 
how 
to 
resolve 
which 
of 
the 
two 
inconveniences 
isto 
beesteemedthelesser. 


SALV. 


Apply 
not 
I 
pray 
you 
this 
term 
of 
inconvenience 
to 
a 
thing 
which 
possibly 
may 
of 
necessity 
be 
so. 
It 
was 
an 
inconvenience 
to 
place 
the 
Earth 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Coelestial 
revolutions; 
but 
seeing 
you 
know 
not 
to 
which 
part 
he 
would 
incline, 
I 
esteeming 
him 
to 
be 
a 
man 
of 
great 
judgment, 
let 
us 
examine 
which 
of 
the 
two 
choices 
is 
the 
more 
rational, 
and 
that 
we 
will 
hold 
that 
Aristotle 
would 
have 
received. 
Reassuming 
therefore 
our 
discourse 
from 
the 
beginning, 
we 
suppose 
with 
the 
good 
liking 
of 
Aristotle, 
that 
the 
World 
(of 
the 
magnitude 
of 
which 
we 
have 
no 
sensible 
notice 
beyond 
the 
fixed 
stars) 
as 



being 
of 
a 
spherical 
figure; 
and 
moveth 
circularly, 
hath 
necessarily, 
and 
in 
respect 
of 
its 
figure 
a 
centre; 
and 
we 
being 
moreover 
certain, 
that 
within 
the 
starry 
Sphere 
there 
are 
many 
Orbs, 
the 
one 
within 
another, 
with 
their 
stars, 
which 
likewise 
do 
move 
circulary, 
it 
is 
in 
dispute 
whether 
it 
is 
most 
reasonable 
to 
believe 
and 
to 
say 
that 
these 
conteined 
Orbs 
do 
move 
round 
the 
said 
centre 
of 
the 
World, 
or 
else 
about 
some 
other 
centre 
far 
remote 
from 
that?Tellmenow 
Simpliciuswhatyouthinkconcerning 
thisparticular. 


SIMP. 


If 
we 
could 
stay 
upon 
this 
onely 
supposition, 
Its 
more 
rational 
that 
the 
Orb 
containing, 
and 
the 
parts 
contained, 
do 
move 
all 
about 
one 
centre, 
than 
u 
on 
divers. 
and 
that 
we 
were 
sure 
that 
we 
might 
encounter 
nothing 
else 
that 
might 
disturb 
us, 
I 
would 
say 
that 
it 
were 
much 
more 
reasonable 
to 
affirm 
that 
the 
Orb 
containing, 
and 
the 
parts 
contained, 
do 
all 
move 
about 
one 
common 
centre, 
thanaboutdivers. 


SALV. 


Now 
if 
it 
were 
true 
that 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
World 
is 
the 
same 
about 
which 
the 
Orbs 
of 
mundane 
bodies, 
If 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
World 
be 
the 
that 
about 
which 
the 
planets 
move, 
the 
Sun 
and 
not 
the 
Earth 
is 
placed 
in 
it. 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
of 
the 
Planets, 
move, 
it 
is 
most 
certain 
that 
it 
is 
not 
the 
Earth, 
but 
the 
Sun 
rather 
that 
is 
fixed 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
World. 
So 
that 
as 
to 
this 
first 
simple 
and 
general 
apprehension, 
the 
middle 
place 
belongeth 
to 
the 
Sun, 
and 
the 
Earth 
is 
asfarremotefrom 
thecentre,asitis

SIMP. 


But 
from 
whence 
do 
you 
argue 
that 
not 
the 
Earth, 
but 
the 
Sun 
is 
in 
the 
centre 
ofthePlanetaryrevolutions? 


SALV. 


I 
infer 
the 
same 
from 
most 
evident, 
and 
therefore 
necessarily 
concludent 
observations, 
of 
which 
the 
most 
palpable

so 
great

that 
forexample, 
Venus 
when

six

more

from

neerest, 
and 
Mars 
riseth 
almost 
eight 
times 
as 
high 
at 
one 
time 
as 
at 
another. 
See 
therefore 
whether 
Aristotle 
was 
not 
somewhat 
mistaken 
in 
thinking 
that 
it 
was 
at 
all 
timesequidistantfromus.

inthatwe 
find

alwayes

to

and 
farthest 
off 
when 
they 
are

and 
this 
approximatian

importeth 
thus

appeareth 
very 
neer 
60

The 
mutation 
of 
figure 
in 
Venus 
argueth 
its 
motion 
to 
be 
about 
the

As 
to 
Venus 
in 
the 
next 
place, 
and 
to 
Mercury, 
we 
are 
certain 
that 
they 
revolve 
about 
the

in 
that 
they 
never 
move 
far 
from

in 
that 
we

The

cannot 
seperate

as 
the 
mutations

necessarily 
argueth. 
To

it 
is

All 
this 
is 
very 
well, 
nor 
can 
it 
be 
denied, 
but 
that 
Heaven 
may 
in 
greatnesse 
surpasse 
our 
imagination, 
as 
also 
that 
God 
might 
have 
created 
it 
thousands 
of 
times 
vaster 
than 
now 
it 
is; 
but 
we 
ought 
not 
to 
grant 
any

to 
have 
been 
made 
in 
vain, 
and 
to 
be 
idle 
in

Now, 
in

see 
this 
admirable

disposed 
about

SALV. 


Methinks 
we 
arrogate 
too 
much 
to 
our 
selves, 
Simplicius, 
whilst 
we 
will 
have 
it, 
that 
the 
onely 
care 
of 
us, 
is 
the 
adaequate 
work, 
and 
bound, 
beyond 
which 
the 
Divine 
Wisdome 
and 
Power 
doth, 
or 
disposeth 
of 
nothing. 
But 
I 
will 
not 
consent, 
that 
we 
should 
so 
much 
shorten 
its 
hand, 
but 
desire 
that 
we 
may 
content 
our 
selves 
with 
an 
assurance 
that 
God 
and 
Nature 
are 
so 
imployed 
in 
the 
governing 
of 
humane 
affairs, 
God 
& 
Nature 
do 
imploy 
themselves 
in 
caring 
formen,as 
if 
they 
mindednothing 
else. 
thatthey 
couldnot 
more 
apply 
themselves 
thereto, 
although 
they 
had 
no 
other 
care 
than 
onely 
that 
of 
mankind; 
and 
this, 
I 
think, 
I 
am 
able 
to 
make 
out 
by 
a 
most 
pertinent 
and 
most 
noble 
example, 
taken 
from 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
Suns 
light, 
which 
whilest 
it 
attracteth 
these 
vapours, 
An 
example 
of 
Gods 
care 
of 
mankind 
taken 
from 
the 
Sun. 
or 
scorcheth 
that 
plant, 
it 
attracteth, 
it 
scorcheth 
them, 
as 
if 
it 
had 
no 
more 
to 
do; 
yea, 
in 
ripening 
that 
bunch 
of 
grapes, 
nay 
that 
one 
single 
grape, 
it 
doth 
apply 
it 
self 
so, 
that 
it 
could 
not 
be 
more 
intense, 
if 
the 
sum 
of 
all 
its 
business 
had 
been 
the 
only 
maturation 
of 
that 
grape. 
Now 
if 
this 
grape 
receiveth 
all 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
it 
to 
receive 
from 
the 
Sun, 
not 
suffering 
the 
least 
injury 
by 
the 
Suns 
production 
of 
a 
thousand 
other 
effects 
at 
the 
same 
time; 
it 
would 
be 
either 
envy 
or 
folly 
to 
blame 
that 
grape, 
if 
it 
should 
think 
or 
wish 
that 
the 
Sun 
would 
onely 
appropriate 
its 
rayes 
to 
its 
advantage. 
I 
am 
confident 
that 
nothing 
is 
omitted 
by 
the 
Divine 
Providence, 
of 
what 
concernes 
the 
government 
of 
humane 
affairs; 
but 
that 
there 
may 
not 
be 
other 
things 
in 
the 
Universe, 
that 
depend 
upon 
the 
same 
infinite 
Wisdome, 
I 
cannot, 
of 
my 
self, 
by 
what 
my 
reason 
holds 
forth 
to 
me, 
bring 
my 
self 
to 
believe. 
However, 
if 
it 
were 
not 
so, 
yet 
should 
I 
not 
forbear 
to 
believe 
the 
reasons 
laid 
before 
me 
by 
some 
more 
sublime 
intelligence. 
In 
the 
mean 
time, 



if 
one 
should 
tell 
me, 
that 
an 
immense 
space 
interposed 
between 
the 
Orbs 
of 
the 
Planets 
and 
the 
Starry 
Sphere, 
deprived 
of 
stars 
and 
idle, 
would 
be 
vain 
and 
uselesse, 
as 
likewise 
that 
so 
great 
an 
immensity 
for 
receipt 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
as 
exceeds 
our 
utmost 
comprehension 
would 
be 
superfluous, 
I 
would 
reply, 
that 
it 
is 
rashnesse 
to 
go 
about 
to 
make 
our 
shallow 
reason 
judg 
of 
the 
Works 
of 
God, 
and 
to 
call 
vain 
and 
superfluous, 
whatsoever 
thing 
in 
the

SAGR. 


Say 
rather, 
It 
is 
great 
rashnesse 
to 
censure 
that 
to 
be 
superfluous 
in 
h 
ll 
verse, 
which 
we 
do 
not 
perceive 
to 
be 
made 
for 
us. 
and 
I 
believe 
you 
would 
say 
better, 
that 
we 
know 
not 
what 
is 
subservient 
to 
us; 
and 
I 
hold 
it 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
vanities, 
yea 
follies, 
that 
can 
be 
in 
the 
World, 
to 
say, 
because 
I 
know 
not 
of 
what 
use 
Jupiter 
or 
Saturn 
are 
to 
me, 
that 
therefore 
these 
Planets 
are 
superfluous, 
yea 
more, 
that 
there 
are 
no 
such 
things 
in 
rerum 
natura; 
when 
as, 
oh 
foolish 
man! 
I 
know 
not 
so 
much 
as 
to 
what 
purpose 
the

the 
gristles, 
the 
spleen, 
thegalldo

nay 
Ishouldnot 
know 
that 
Ihave 
a 
gall, 
spleen, 
or 
kidneys, 
if 
in

desected 
Corps, 
they

and 
thenonelyshallIbeable 
toknowwhatthespleen

To 
be 
able 
to 
know 
what 
this 
or 
that 
Coelestial 
body 
worketh 
in 
me 
(seeing 
you 
will 
have 
it 
that 
all 
their 
influences 
direct 
themselves 
to 
us) 
itwouldbe 
requisite 
to 
remove 
that 
body 
for 
some 
time; 
By 
depriving 
Heaven 
of 
some 
star, 
one 
might 
come 
to 
know 
what 
influence 
it 
hath 
upon 
us. 
and 
then 
whatsoever 
effect 
I 
should 
find 
wanting 
in 
me, 
I 
would 
say 
that 
it 
depended 
on 
that 
star. 
Moreover, 
who 
will 
presume 
to 
say 
that 
the 
space 
which 
they 
call 
too 
vast 
and 
uselesse 
between 
Saturn 
and 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
is 
void 
of 
other 
mundane 
bodies? 
Must 
it 
be 
so, 
Many 
things 
may 
be 
in 
Heaven, 
that 
are 
invisible 
to 
us. 
because 
we 
do 
not 
see 
them? 
Then 
the 
four 
Medicean 
Planets, 
and 
the 
companions 
of 
Saturn 
came 
first 
into 
Heaven, 
whenwebegan

Andbythisrule 
theinnumerable 
other 
fixed 
stars 
had 
no 
existence 
before 
that 
men 
did 
look 
on 
them? 
and 
the 
cloudy 
constellations 
called 
Nebulosae 
were 
at 
first 
only 
white 
flakes, 
but 
afterwards 
with 
the 
Telescope 
we 
made 
them 
to 
become 
constellations 
of 
many 
lucid 
and 
bright 
stars. 
Oh 
presumptious, 
rather 
oh 
rash 
ignorance 
of

It’s 
to

purpose 
Sagredus, 
to 
sally 
out 
any 
more 
into 
these 
unprofitable 
exaggerations: 
Let 
us 
pursue 
our 
intended 
designe 
of 
examining 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
reasons 
alledged 
on 
either 
side, 
without 
determining 
any 
thing, 
remitting 
the 
judgment 
thereof 
when 
we 
have 
done, 
to 
such 
as 
are 
more 
knowing. 
Returning 
therefore 
to 
our 
natural 
and 
humane 
disquisitions, 
I 
say, 
Great, 
small, 
immense, 
&c. 
are 
relative 
terms. 
that 
great, 
little, 
immense, 
small, 
&c. 
are 
not 
absolute, 
but 
relative 
terms, 
so 
that 
the 
self 
same 
thing 
compared 
with 
divers 
others, 
may 
one 
while 
be 
called 
immense, 
and 
another 
while 
imperceptible, 
not 
to 
say 
small. 
This 
being 
so, 
I 
demand 
in 
relation 
to 
what 
the 
Starry 
Sphere 
of 
Copernicus 
may 
be 
called 
over 
vast. 
In

judgmentitcannotbecompared, 
orsaidtobesuch,

Vanity 
of 
those 
mens 
discourse 
who 
judg 
the 
starry 
sphere 
too 
vast 
in 
the 
Copernican 
Hypothesis. 
now 
let 
us 
take 
the 
very 
least 
of 
the 
same 
kind, 
which 
shall 
be 
the 
Lunar 
Orb; 
and 
if 
the 
Starry 
Orb 
may 
be 
so 
censured 
to 
be 
too 
big 
in 
respect 
to 
that 
of 
the 
Moon, 
every 
other 
magnitude 
that 
with 
like 
or 
greater 
proportion 
exceedeth 
another 
of 
the 
same 
kind, 
ought 
to 
be 
adjudged 
too 
vast, 
and 
for 
the 
same 
reason 
to 
be 
denied 
that 
they 
are 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
World; 
and 
thus 
an 
Elephant, 
and 
a 
Whale, 
shall 
without 
more 
ado 
be 
condemned 
for 
Chymaera’s, 
and 
Poetical 
fictions, 
because 
that 
the 
one 
as 
being 
too 
vast 
in 
relation 
to 
an 
Ant, 
which 
is 
a 
Terrestrial 
animal, 
and 
the 
other 
in 
respect 
to 
theSpelloncola, 
which 
is 
here 
put 
for 
the 
l 
ast 
of 
Fishes. 
Gudgeon, 
which 
is 
a 
Fish, 
and 
are 
certainly 
seen 
to 
be 
in 
rerum 
natura, 
would 
be 
too 
immeasurable; 
for 
without 
all 
dispute, 
the 
Elephant 
and 
Whale 
exceed 
the 
Ant 
and 
Gudgeon 
in 
a 
much 
greater 
proportion 
than 
the 
Starry 
Sphere 
doth 
that 
of 
the 
Moon, 
although 
we 
should 
fancy 
the 
said 
Sphere 
to 
be 
as 
big 
as 
the 
Copernican 
Systeme 
maketh 
it. 
The 
space 
assigned 
to 
a 
fixed 
star, 
is 
much 
lesse 
than 
that 
of 
a 
Planet. 
Moreover, 
how 
hugely 
big 
is 
the 
Sphere 
of 
Jupiter, 
or 
that 
of 
Saturn, 
designed 
for 
a 
receptacle 
but 
for 
one 
single 
star; 
and 
that 
very 
small 
in 
comparison 
of 
one 
of 
the 
fixed? 
Certainly 
if 
we 
should 
assign 
to 
every 
one 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars 
for 
its 
receptacle 
so 
great 
a 
part 
of 
the 
Worlds 
space, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
make 
the 
Orb 
wherein 
such 
innumerable 
multitudes 
of 
them 
reside, 
very 
many 
thousands 
of 
times 
bigger 
than 
that 
which 
serveth 
the 
purpose 
of 
Copernicus. 
A 
star 
is 
called 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
space 
that 
environs 
it. 
Besides, 
do 
not 
you 
call 
a 
fixed 
star 
very 
small, 
I 
mean 
even 
one 
of 
the 
most 
apparent, 
and 
not 



one 
of 
those 
which 
shun 
our 
sight; 
and 
do 
we 
not 
call 
them 
so 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
vast 
space 
circumfused? 
Now 
if 
the 
whole 
Starry 
Sphere 
were 
one 
entire 
lucid 
body; 
The 
whole 
starry 
sphere

from 
a 
great 
distance 
might 
appear 
as 
small 
as 
one 
single 
star. 
who 
is 
there, 
that 
doth 
not 
know 
that 
in 
an 
infinite

there 
might 
be 
assigned 
a 
distance 
so 
great, 
as 
that 
the 
said 
lucid 
Sphere 
might 
from 
thence 
shew 
as 
little, 
yea 
lesse 
than 
a 
fixed 
star, 
now 
appeareth 
beheld 
from 
the 
Earth? 
From 
thence 
therefore 
we 
should 
then 
judg 
that 
self 
same 
thing 
to 
be 
little, 
which 
now 
from 
hence

All

that 
you 
say

very 
true;

that 
upon

the

makes

is, 
to

so 
much 
bigger

that 
in 
case 
the 
Heavens, 
the

and 
the 
quantity 
of 
their 
distances 
and 
magnitudes 
which 
he 
hath 
hitherto 
held, 
be 
let 
alone, 
(although 
he 
never 
certainly 
fancied 
to 
himself 
any 
conceivable 
magnitude 
thereof) 
he 
perfectly 
discerns 
and 
comprehends 
the 
benefits 
that 
flow 
from 
thence 
to 
the 
Earth, 
which 
is 
no 
longer 
an 



inconsiderable 
thing; 
nor 
are 
they 
any 
longer 
so 
remote 
as 
to 
appeare 
so 
very 
small, 
but 
big 
enough 
to 
be 
able 
to 
operate 
on 
the 
Earth; 
and 
that 
the 
distance 
between 
them 
and 
Saturn 
is 
very 
well 
proportioned, 
and 
that 
he, 
for 
all 
these 
things, 
hath 
very 
probable 
reasons; 
of 
which 
I 
would 
gladly 
have 
heard 
some 
one: 
The 
Authour 
of 
the 
Conclusions 
confound 
and 
contradicts 
himself 
in 
his 
interrogations. 
but 
being 
that 
in 
these 
few 
words 
he 
confounds 
and 
contradicts 
himself, 
it 
maketh 
me 
think 
that 
he 
is 
very 
poor 
and 
ill 
furnished 
with 
those 
probable 
reasons, 
and 
that 
those 
which 
he 
calls 
reasons, 
are 
rather 
fallacies, 
or 
dreams 
of 
an 
over-weening 
fancy. 
For 
I 
ask 
of 
him, 
whether 
these 
Celestial 
bodies 
truly 
operate 
on 
the 
Earth, 
Interrogatories 
put 
to 
the 
Authour 
of 
the 
Conclusions, 
by 
which 
the 
weaknesse 
of 
his 
is 
made 
appear. 
and 
whether 
for 
the 
working 
of 
those 
effects 
they 
were 
produced 
of 
such 
and 
such 
magnitudes, 
and 
disposed 
at 
such 
and 
such 
distances, 
or 
else 
whether 
they 
have 
nothing 
at 
all 
to 
do 
with 
Terrene 
mattets. 
If 
they 
have 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
Earth; 
it 
is 
a 
great 
folly 
for 
us 
that 
are 
Earth-born, 
to 
offer 
to 
make 
our 
selves 
arbitrators 
of 
their 
magnitudes, 
and 
regulators 
of 
their 
local 
dispositions, 
seeing 
that 
we 
are 
altogether 
ignorant 
of 
their 
whole 
businesse 
and 
concerns; 
but 
if 
he 
shall 
say 
that 
they 
do 
operate, 
and 
that 
they 
are 
directed 
to 
this 
end, 
he 
doth 
affirm 
the 
same 
thing 
which 
a 
little 
before 
he 
denied, 
and 
praiseth 
that 
which 
even 
now 
he 
condemned, 
in 
that 
he 
said, 
that 
the 
Celestial 
bodies 
situate 
so 
far 
remote 
as 
that 
they 
appear 
very 
small, 
cannot 
have 
any 
influence 
at 
all 
upon 
the 
Earth. 
But, 
good 
Sir, 
in 
the 
Starry 
Sphere 
pre-established 
at 
its 
present 
distance, 
and 
which 
you 
did 
acknowledg 
to 
be 
in 
your 
judgment, 
well 
proportioned 
to 
have 
an 
influence 
upon 
these 
Terrene 
bodies, 
many 
stars 
appear 
very 
small, 
and 
an 
hundred 
times 
as 
many 
more 
are 
wholly 
invisible 
unto 
us 
(which 
is 
an 
appearing 
yet 
lesse 
than 
very 
small) 
therefore 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
(contradicting 
your 
self) 
you 
do 
now 
deny 
their 
operation 
upon 
the 
Earth; 
or 
else 
that 
(still 
contradicting 
your 
self) 
you 
grant 
that 
their 
appearing 
very 
small 
doth 
not 
in 
the 
least 
lessen 
their 
influence; 
or 
else 
that 
(and 
this 
shall 
be 
a 
more 
sincere 
and 
modest 
concession) 
you 
acknowledg 
and 
freely 
confesse, 
that 
our 
passing 
judgment 
upon 
their 
magnitudes 
and 
distances 
is 
a 
vanity, 
not 
to 
say 
presumption 
or 
rashnesse. 


SIMP. 



Truth 
is, 
I 
my 
self 
did 
also, 
in 
reading 
this 
passage 
perceive 
the 
manifest 
contradiction, 
in 
saying, 
that 
the 
Stars 
(if 
one 
may 
so 
speak) 
of 
Copernicus 
appearing 
so 
very 
small, 
could 
not 
operate 
on 
the 
Earth, 
and 
not 
perceiving 
that 
he 
had 
granted 
an 
influence 
upon 
the 
Earth 
to 
those 
of 
Ptolomy, 
and 
his 
sectators, 
which 
appear 
not 
only 
very 
small, 
but 
are, 
for 
the 
most 
part, 
very 
invisible. 


SALV. 


But 
I 
proceed 
to 
another 
consideration: 
What 
is 
the 
reason, 
doth 
he 
say, 
why 
the 
stars 
appear 
so 
little? 
Is 
it 
haply, 
because 
they 
seem 
so 
to 
us?That 
remote 
objectsappearesosmall,isthedefectof 
theeye,asisdemonstrated. 
Dothnot 
he 
know, 
that 
this 
commeth 
from 
the 
Instrument 
that 
we 
imploy 
in 
beholding 
them, 
to 
wit, 
from 
our 
eye? 
And 
that 
this 
is 
true, 
by 
changing 
Instrument, 
we 
shall 
see 
them 
bigger 
and 
bigger, 
as 
much 
as 
we 
will. 
And 
who 
knows 
but 
that 
totheEarth,whichbeholdeth 
them 
without 
eyes,they 
maynotshewvery 
great, 
and 
such 
as 
in 
reality 
they 
are? 
But 
it’s 
time 
that, 
omitting 
these 
trifles, 
we 
come 
to 
things 
of 
more 
moment; 
and 
therefore 
I 
having 
already 
demonstrated 
these 
two 
things: 
First, 
how 
far 
off 
the 
Firmament 
ought 
to 
be 
placed 
to 
make, 
that 
the 
grand 
Orb 
causeth 
no 
greater 
difference 
than 
that 
which 
the 
Terrestrial 
Orb 
occasioneth 
in 
the 
remotenesse 
of 
the 
Sun; 
And 
next, 
how 
likewise 
to 
make 
that 
a 
star 
of 
the 
Firmament 
appear 
to 
us 
of 
the 
same 
bignesse, 
as 
now 
we 
see 
it, 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
to 
suppose 
it 
bigger 
than 
the 
Sun; 
I 
would 
know 
whether 
Tycho, 
or 
any 
of 
his 
adherents 
hath 
ever 
attempted 
to 
find 
out, 
by 
any 
means, 
whether 
any 
appearance 
be 
to 
be 
discovered 
in 
the 
starry 
Sphere, 
upon 
which 
one 
may 
the 
more 
resolutely 
denyor 
admittheannual 
motionoftheEarth. 


SAGR. 


I 
would 
answer 
for 
them, 
that 
there 
is 
not, 
no 
nor 
is 
there 
any 
need 
there 
should; 
Tycho 
nor 
his 
followers 
ever 
attempted 
to 
see 
whether 
there 
are 
any 
appearances 
in 
the 
Firmament 
for 
or 
against 
the 
annual 
m 
tion. 
seeing 
that 
it 
is 
Copernicus 
himself 
that 
saith, 
that 
no 
such 
diversity 
is 
there: 
and 
they, 
arguing 
ad 
hominem, 
admit 
him 
the 
same; 
and 
upon 
this 
assumption 
they 
demonstrate 
the 
improbability 
thatfolloweth 
thereupon, 
namely, 
that 
itwould 
be 
necessary 
to 
make 
the 
Sphere 
so 
immense, 
that 
a 
fixed 
star, 
to 
appear 
unto 
us 
as 
great 
as 
it 
now 
seems, 
ought 
of 
necessity 
to 
be 
of 
so 
immense 
a 



magnitude, 
as 
that 
it 
would 
exceed 
the 
bignesse 
of 
the 
whole 
grand 
Orb, 
a 
thing,whichnotwithstanding, 
astheysay,isaltogetherincredible. 


SALV. 


I 
am 
of 
the 
same 
judgment, 
and 
verily 
believe 
that 
they 
argue 
contra 
hominem, 
studying 
more 
to 
defend 
another 
man, 
than 
desiring 
to 
come 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
truth. 
And 
I 
do 
not 
only 
believe, 
Astronomers, 
perhaps, 
have 
not 
known 
what 
appearances 
ought 
to 
follow 
upon 
the 
annual 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth. 
that 
none 
of 
them 
ever 
applied 
themselves 
to 
make 
any 
such 
observation, 
but 
I 
am 
also 
uncertain, 
whether 
any 
of 
them 
do 
know 
what 
alteration 
the 
Earths 
annual 
motion 
ought 
to 
produce 
in 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
in 
case 
the 
starry 
Sphere 
were 
not 
so 
far 
distant, 
as 
that 
in 
them 
the 
said 
diversity, 
by 
reason 
of 
its 
minuity 
dis-appeareth; 
for 
their 
surceasing 
that 
inquisition, 
and 
referring 
themselves 
to 
the 
meer 
assertion 
of 
Copernicus, 
may 
very 
well 
serve 
to 
convict 
a 
man, 
but 
not 
to 
acquit 
him 
of 
the 
fact: 
Copernicus 
understood 
not 
some 
things 
for 
want 
of 
Instruments. 
For 
its 
possible 
that 
such 
a 
diversity 
may 
be, 
and 
yet 
not 
have 
been 
sought 
for; 
or 
that 
either 
by 
reason 
of 
its 
minuity, 
or 
for 
want 
of 
exact 
Instruments 
it 
was 
not 
discovered 
by 
Copernicus; 
for 
though 
it 
were 
so, 
this 
would 
not 
be 
the 
first 
thing, 
that 
he 
either 
for 
want 
of 
Instruments, 
or 
for 
some 
other 
defect 
hath 
not 
known; 
and 
yet 
he 
proceeding 
upon 
other 
solid 
and 
rational 
conjectures, 
affirmeth 
that, 
which 
the 
things 
by 
him 
not 
discovered 
do 
seem 
to 
contradict: 
for, 
as 
hath 
been 
said 
already, 
without 
the 
Telescope, 
neither 
could 
Mars 
be 
discerned 
to 
increase 
60. 
times; 
nor 
Venus 
40. 
more 
in 
that 
than 
in 
this 
position; 
yea, 
their 
differences 
appear 
much 
lesse 
than 
really 
they 
are 
and 
yet 
neverthelesse 
it 
is 
certainly 
discovered 
at 
length, 
that 
those 
mutations 
are 
the 
same, 
to 
an 
hair 
that 
the 
Copernican 
Systeme 
required. 
Tycho 
and 
others 
argue 
against 
the 
annual 
motion, 
from 
the 
invariable 
elevation 
of 
the 
Pole. 
Now 
it 
would 
be 
very 
well, 
if 
with 
the 
greatest 
accuratenesse 
possible 
one 
should 
enquire 
whether 
such 
a 
mutation 
as 
ought 
to 
be 
discoverable 
in 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
supposing 
the 
annual 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth, 
would 
be 
observed 
really 
and 
in 
effect, 
a 
thing 
which 
I 
verily 
believe 
hath 
never 
as 
yet 
been 
done 
by 
any; 
done, 
said 
I? 
no, 
nor 
haply 
(as 
I 
said 
before) 
by 
many 
well 
understood 
how 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
done. 
Nor 
speak 
I 
this 
at 
randome, 
for 
I 
have 
heretofore 
seen 
a 
certain 
Manuscript 
of 
one 
of 
these 
Anti-Copernicans, 
which 
said, 
that 
there 
would 
necessarily 
follow, 
in 
case 



that 
opinion 
were 
true, 
a 
continual 
rising 
and 
falling 
of 
the 
Pole 
from 
six 
moneths 
to 
six 
moneths, 
according 
as 
the 
Earth 
in 
such 
a 
time, 
by 
such 
a 
space 
as 
is 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
grand 
Orb, 
retireth 
one 
while 
towards 
the 
North, 
and 
another 
while 
towards 
the 
South; 
and 
yet 
it 
seemed 
to 
him 
reasonable, 
yea 
necessary, 
that 
we, 
following 
the 
Earth, 
when 
we 
were 
towards 
the 
North 
should 
have 
the 
Pole 
more 
elevated 
than 
when 
we 
are 
towards 
the 
South. 
In 
this 
very 
error 
did 
one 
fall 
that 
was 
otherwise 
a 
very 
skilful 
Mathematician, 
& 
a 
follower 
of 
Copernic. 
as 
Tycho 
relateth 
in 
hisChristophorus 
Rothmannus. 
Progymnasma. 
pag. 
684. 
which 
said, 
that 
he 
had 
observed 
the 
Polar 
altitude 
to 
vary, 
and 
to 
differ 
in 
Summer 
from 
what 
it 
is 
in 
Winter: 
and 
because 
Tycho 
denieth 
the 
merit 
of 
the 
cause, 
but 
findeth 
no 
fault 
with 
the 
method 
of 
it; 
that 
is, 
denieth 
that 
there 
is 
any 
mutation 
to 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
altitude 
of 
the 
Pole, 
but 
doth 
not 
blame 
the 
inquisition, 
for 
not 
being 
adapted 
to 
the 
finding 
of 
what 
is 
sought, 
he 
thereby 
sheweth, 
that 
he 
also 
esteeemed 
the 
Polar 
altitude 
varied, 
or 
not 
varied 
every 
six 
moneths, 
to 
beagoodtestimonyto

SIMP. 


In 
truth, 
Salviatus, 
my 
opinion 
also 
tells 
me, 
that 
the 
same 
must 
necessarily 
ensue: 
for 
I 
do 
not 
think 
that 
you 
will 
deny 
me, 
but 
that 
if 
we 
walk 
only 
60. 
miles 
towards 
the 
North, 
the 
Pole 
will 
rise 
unto 
us 
a 
degree 
higher, 
and 
that 
if 
we 
move 
60. 
miles 
farther 
Northwards, 
the 
Pole 
will 
be 
elevated 
to 
us 
a 
degree 
more, 
&c. 
Now 
if 
the 
approaching 
or 
receding 
60. 
miles 
onely, 
make 
so 
notable 
a 
change 
in 
the 
Polar 
altitudes, 
what 
alteration 
would 
follow, 
if 
the 
Earth 
and 
we 
with 
it, 
should 
be 
transported, 
I 
will 
not 
say 
60. 
miles, 
but 
60. 
thousand 
milesthatway. 


SALV. 


It 
would 
follow 
(if 
it 
should 
proceed 
in 
the 
same 
proportion) 
that 
the 
Pole 
shall 
be 
elevated 
a 
thousand 
degrees. 
See, 
Simplicius, 
what 
a 
long 
rooted 
opinion 
can 
do. 
Yea, 
by 
reason 
you 
have 
fixed 
it 
in 
your 
mind 
for 
so 
many 
years, 
that 
it 
is 
Heaven,thatrevolveth 
in 
twentyfourhours, 
and 
notthe 
Earth, 
and 
that 
consequently 
the 
Poles 
of 
that 
Revolution 
are 
in 
Heaven, 
and 
not 
in 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe, 
cannot 
now, 
in 
an 
hours 
time 
shake 
off 
this 
habituated 
conceipt, 
and 
take 
up 
the 
contrary, 
fancying 
to 
your 
self, 
that 
the 
Earth 
is 
that 
which 
moveth, 
only 
for 
so 
long 
time 
as 
may 
suffice 
to 
conceive 
of 
what 



would 
follow, 
thereupon 
should 
that 
lye 
be 
a 
truth. 
If 
the 
Earth 
Simplicius, 
be 
that 
which 
moveth 
in 
its 
self 
in 
twenty 
four 
hours, 
in 
it 
are 
the 
Poles, 
in 
it 
is 
the 
Axis, 
in 
it 
is 
the 
Equinoctial, 
that 
is, 
the 
grand 
Circle, 
described 
by 
the 
point, 
equidistant 
from 
the 
Poles, 
in 
it 
are 
the 
infinite 
Parallels 
bigger 
and 
lesser 
described 
by 
the 
points 
of 
the 
superficies 
more 
and 
lesse 
distant 
from 
the 
Poles, 
in 
it 
are 
all 
these 
things, 
and 
not 
in 
the 
starry 
Sphere, 
which, 
as 
being 
immoveable, 
wants 
them 
all, 
and 
can 
only 
by 
the 
imagination 
be 
conceived 
to 
be 
therein, 
prolonging 
the 
Axis 
of 
the 
Earth 
so 
far, 
till 
that 
determining, 
it 
shall 
mark 
out 
two 
points 
placed 
right 
over 
our 
Poles, 
and 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
Equinoctial 
being 
extended, 
it 
shall 
describe 
in 
Heaven 
a 
circle 
like 
it 
self. 
Now 
if 
the 
true 
Axis, 
the 
true 
Poles, 
the 
true 
Equinoctial, 
do 
not 
change 
in 
the 
Earth 
so 
long 
as 
you 
continue 
in 
the 
same 
place 
of 
the 
Earth, 
and 
though 
the 
Earth 
be 
transported, 
as 
you 
do 
please, 
yet 
you 
shall 
not 
change 
your 
habitude 
either 
to 
the 
Poles, 
or 
to 
the 
circles, 
or 
to 
any 
other 
Earthly 
thing; 
and 
this 
because, 
that 
that 
transposition 
being 
common 
to 
you 
and 
to 
all 
Terrestrial 
things; 
Motion 
it 
is 
common 
is 
as 
if 
it 
never 
were. 
and 
that 
motion 
where 
it 
is 
common, 
is 
as 
if 
it 
never 
were; 
and 
as 
you 
change 
not 
habitude 
to 
the 
Terrestrial 
Poles 
(habitude 
I 
say, 
whether 
that 
they 
rise, 
or 
descend) 
so 
neither 
shall 
you 
change 
position 
to 
the 
Poles 
imagined 
in 
Heaven; 
alwayes 
provided 
that 
by 
Celestial 
Poles 
we 
understand 
(as 
hath 
been 
already 
defined) 
those 
two 
points 
that 
come 
to 
be 
marked 
out 
by 
the 
prolongation 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Axis 
unto 
that 
length. 
Tis 
true 
those 
points 
in 
Heaven 
do 
change, 
when 
the 
Earths 
transportment 
is 
made 
after 
such 
a 
manner, 
that 
its 
Axis 
cometh 
to 
passe 
by 
other 
and 
other 
points 
of 
the

not, 
so 
as 
that 
the

should 
be 
more 
elevated 
to

than

If 
any 
one 
will 
have 
one 
of

points 
of

which 
do 
answer 
to 
the 
Poles 
of 
the 
Earth 
to 
ascend, 
and 
the 
other 
to 
descend, 
he 
must 
walk 
along 
the 
Earth 
towards 
the 
one, 
receding 
from

of

SAGR. 


Permit 
me, 
I 
beseech 
you 
Salviatus, 
to 
make 
this 
a 
little 
more 
clear 
by 
an 
example, 
which 
although 
grosse, 
is 
acommodated 
to 
this 
purpose. 
An 
example 
fitted 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
altitude 
of 
the 
Pole 
ought 
not 
to 
vary 
by 
means 
of 
the 
Earths 
annual 
motion. 
Suppose 
your 
self, 
Simplicius, 
to 
be 



aboard 
a 
Ship, 
and 
that 
standing 
in 
the 
Poope, 
or 
Hin-deck; 
you 
have 
directed 
a 
Quadrant, 
or 
some 
other 
Astronomical 
Instrument, 
towards 
the 
top 
of 
the 
Top-gallant-Mast, 
as 
if 
you 
would 
take 
its 
height, 
which 
suppose 
it 
were 
v. 
gr. 
40. 
degrees, 
there 
is 
no 
doubt, 
but 
that 
if 
you 
walk 
along 
theCorsia, 
the 
bank 
orbenchon 
whichslavessit 
in 
a 
Gally. 
Hatchestowards 
the 
Mast25. 
or 


30. 
paces; 
and 
then 
again 
direct 
the 
said 
Instrument 
to 
the 
same 
Top-Gallant-
Top. 
You 
shall 
find 
its 
elevation 
to 
be 
greater, 
and 
to 
be 
encreased 
v. 
gr. 
10. 
degrees; 
but 
if 
instead 
of 
walking 
those 
25. 
or 
30. 
paces 
towards 
the 
Mast, 
you 
stand 
still 
at 
the 
Sterne, 
and 
make 
the 
whole 
Ship 
to 
move 
thitherwards, 
do 
you 
believe 
that 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
25. 
or 
30. 
paces 
that 
it 
had 
past, 
the 
elevationof 
theTop-Gallant-Topwould 
shew10. 
degreesencreased? 
SIMP. 


I 
believe 
and 
know 
that 
it 
would 
not 
gain 
an 
hairs 
breadth 
in 
the 
passing 
of 


30. 
paces, 
nor 
of 
a 
thousand, 
no 
nor 
of 
an 
hundred 
thousand 
miles; 
but 
yet 
I 
believe 
withal 
that 
looking 
through 
the 
sights 
at 
the 
Top 
and 
Top-Gallant, 
if 
I 
should 
find 
a 
fixed 
Star 
that 
was 
in 
the 
same 
elevation, 
I 
believe 
I 
say, 
that, 
holding 
still 
the 
Quadrant, 
after 
I 
had 
sailed 
towards 
the 
star 
60. 
miles, 
the 
eye 
would 
meet 
with 
the 
top 
of 
the 
said 
Mast, 
as 
before, 
but 
not 
with 
the 
star, 
which 
wouldbeelevatedtomeonedegree. 
SAGR. 


Then 
you 
do 
not 
think 
that 
the 
sight 
would 
fall 
upon 
that 
point 
of 
the 
Starry 
Sphere,thatanswerethtothedirectionofthe 
Top-GallantTop? 


SIMP. 


No: 
For 
the 
point 
would 
be 
changed, 
and 
would 
be 
beneath 
the 
star 
first 
observed. 


SAGR. 


You 
are 
in 
the 
right. 
Now 
like 
as 
that 
which 
in 
this 
example 
answereth 
to 
the 
elevation 
of 
the 
Top-Gallant-Top, 
is 
not 
the 
star, 
but 
the 
point 
of 
the 
Firmament 
that 
lyeth 
in 
a 
right 
line 
with 
the 
eye, 
and 
the 
said 
top 
of 
the 
Mast, 
so 
in 
the 
case 
exemplified, 
that 
which 
in 
the 
Firmament 
answers 
to 
the 
Pole 



of 
the 
Earth, 
is 
not 
a 
star, 
or 
other 
fixed 
thing 
in 
the 
Firmament; 
but 
is 
that 
point 
in 
which 
the 
Axis 
of 
the 
Earth 
continued 
streight 
out, 
till 
it 
cometh 
thither 
doth 
determine, 
which 
point 
is 
not 
fixed, 
but 
obeyeth 
the 
mutations 
that 
the 
Pole 
of 
the 
Earth 
doth 
make. 
Upon 
the 
annual 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth, 
alteration 
may 
ensue 
in 
some 
fixed 
star, 
not 
in 
the 
Pole. 
And 
therefore 
Tycho, 
or 
who 
ever 
else 
that 
did 
alledg 
this 
objection, 
ought 
to 
have 
said 
that 
upon 
that 
same 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth, 
were 
it 
true, 
one 
might 
observe 
some 
difference 
in 
the 
elevation 
and 
depression 
(not 
of 
the 
Pole, 
but) 
of 
some 
fixed 
star 
towardthatpartwhich 
answerethto 
our 
Pole. 


SIMP. 


I 
already 
very 
well 
understand 
the 
mistake 
by 
them 
committed; 
but 
yet 
therefore 
(which 
to 
me 
seems 
very 
great) 
of 
the 
argument 
brought 
on 
the 
contrary 
is 
not 
lessened, 
supposing 
relation 
to 
be 
had 
to 
the 
variation 
of 
the 
stars, 
and 
not 
of 
the 
Pole; 
for 
if 
the 
moving 
of 
the 
Ship 
but 
60. 
miles, 
make 
a 
fixed 
star 
rise 
to 
me 
one 
degree, 
shall 
I 
not 
find 
alike, 
yea 
and 
very 
much 
greater 
mutation, 
if 
the 
Ship 
should 
sail 
towards 
the 
said 
star 
for 
so 
much 
space 
as 
is 
the 
Diameter 
of 
the 
Grand 
Orb, 
which 
you 
affirm 
to 
be 
double 
the 
distance 
thatis 
betweentheEarthand

SAGR. 


Herein 
Simplicius, 
there 
is 
another 
fallacy, 
which, 
truth 
is, 
The 
equivoke 
of 
those 
who 
believe 
that 
in 
the 
annual 
motion 
great 
mutations 
are 
to 
be 
made 
about 
the 
elevation 
of 
a 
fixed 
star, 
is 
confuted. 
you 
understand, 
but 
do 
not 
upon 
the 
sudden 
think 
of 
the 
same, 
but 
I 
will 
try 
to 
bring 
it 
to 
your 
remembrance: 
Tell 
me 
therefore; 
if 
when 
after 
you 
have 
directed 
the 
Quadrant 
to 
a 
fixed 
star, 
and 
found 
v. 
g. 
its 
elevation 
to 
be 
40. 
degrees, 
you 
should 
without 
stirring 
from 
the 
place, 
incline 
the 
side 
of 
the 
Quadrant, 
so 
as 
that 
the 
star 
might 
remain 
elevated 
above 
that 
direction, 
would 
you 
thereupon 
saythatthestarhad 
acquiredgreaterelevation? 


SIMP. 


Certainly 
no: 
For 
the 
mutation 
was 
made 
in 
the 
Instrument 
and 
not 
in 
the 
Observer,

Butif 
you 
sail 
or 
walk 
along 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe, 
will 
you 
say 
that 
there 
is 
no 
alteration 
made 
in 
the 
said 
Quadrant, 
but 
that 
the 
same 
elevation 
is 
still 
retained 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
Heavens, 
so 
long 
as

SIMP. 


Give 
me 
leave 
to 
think 
of 
it. 
I 
would 
say 
without 
more 
ado, 
that 
it 
would 
not 
retain 
the 
same, 
in 
regard 
the 
progresse 
I 
make 
is 
not 
in 
plano, 
but 
about 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe, 
which 
at 
every 
step 
changeth 
inclination 
in 
respect 
to 
Heaven, 
and 
consequently 
maketh 
the 
same 
change 
intheInstrumentwhichiserecteduponthesame. 


SAGR. 


You 
say 
very 
well: 
And 
you 
know 
withal, 
that 
by 
how 
much 
the 
bigger 
that 
circle 
shall 
be 
upon 
which 
you 
move, 
so 
many 
more 
miles 
you 
are 
to 
walk, 
to 
make 
the 
said 
star 
to 
rise 
that 
same 
degree 
higher; 
and 
that 
finally 
if 
the 
motion 
towards 
the 
star 
should 
be 
in 
a 
right 
line, 
you 
ought 
to 
move 
yet 
farther,thanifitwereaboutthe 
circumferenceofnever 
sogreata 
circle? 


SALV. 


True: 
The 
right 
line, 
and 
circumference 
of 
an 
infinite 
circle, 
are 
the 
same 
thing. 
For 
in 
short 
the 
circumference 
of 
an 
infinite 
circle, 
and 
a 
right 
line 
are 
thesamething. 


SAGR. 


But 
this 
I 
do 
not 
understand, 
nor 
as 
I 
believe, 
doth 
Simplicius 
apprehend 
the 
same; 
and 
it 
must 
needs 
be 
concealed 
from 
us 
under 
some 
mistery, 
for 
we 
know 
that 
Salviatus 
never 
speaks 
at 
random, 
nor 
proposeth 
any 
Paradox, 
which 
doth 
not 
break 
forth 
into 
some 
conceit, 
not 
trivial 
in 
the 
least. 
Therefore 
in 
due 
time 
and 
place 
I 
will 
put 
you 
in 
mind 
to 
demonstrate 
this, 
that 
the 
right 
line 
is 
the 
same 
with 
the 
circumference 
of 
an 
infinite 
circle, 
but 
at 
present 
I 
am 
unwilling 
that 
we 
should 
interrupt 
the 
discourse 
in 
hand. 



Returning 
then 
to 
the 
case, 
I 
propose 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
Simplicius, 
how 
the 
accession 
and 
recession 
that 
the 
Earth 
makes 
from 
the 
said 
fixed 
star 
which 
is 
neer 
the 
Pole 
can 
be 
made 
as 
it 
were 
by 
a 
right 
line, 
for 
such 
is 
the 
Diameter 
of 
the 
Grand 
Orb, 
so 
that 
the 
attempting 
to 
regulate 
the 
elevation 
and 
depressionof 
thePolar 
star 
bythe 
motionalong 
the 
said 
Diameter, 
asifit 
were 
by 
the 
motion 
about 
the 
little 
circle 
of 
the 
Earth, 
is 
a 
great 
argument 
of 
butlittlejudgment. 


SIMP. 


But 
we 
continue 
still 
unsatisfied, 
in 
regard 
that 
the 
said 
small 
mutation 
that 
should 
be 
therein, 
would 
not 
be 
discerned; 
and 
if 
this 
be 
null, 
then 
must 
the 
annualmotion 
abouttheGrandOrb 
ascribedtotheEarth,be 
nullalso. 


SAGR. 


Here 
now 
I 
give 
Salviatus 
leave 
to 
go 
on, 
who 
as 
I 
believe 
will 
not 
overpasse 
the 
elevation 
and 
depression 
of 
the 
Polar 
star 
or 
any 
other 
of 
those 
that 
are 
fixed 
as 
null, 
although 
not 
discovered 
by 
any 
one, 
and 
affirmed 
by 
Copernicus 
himself 
to 
be, 
I 
will 
not 
say 
null, 
but 
unobservable 
by 
reason 
of 
itsminuity. 


SALV. 


I 
have 
already 
said 
above, 
that 
I 
do 
not 
think 
that 
any 
one 
did 
ever 
set 
himself 
to 
observe, 
Enquiry 
is 
made 
what 
mutations, 
& 
in 
what 
stars, 
are 
to 
be 
discovered, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
annual 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth. 
whether 
in 
different 
times 
of 
the 
year 
there 
is 
any 
mutation 
to 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
that 
may 
have 
a 
dependanceon 
theannual 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth,and 
added 
withal, 
that 
I 
doubted 
least 
haply 
some 
might 
never 
have 
understood 
what 
those 
mutations 
are, 
and 
amongst 
what 
stars 
they 
should 
be 
discerned; 
therefore 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
that 
we 
in 
the 
next 
place 
narrowly 
examine 
this 
particular. 
Astronomers 
having 
omitted 
to 
instance 
what 
alterations 
those 
are 
that 
may 
be 
derived 
from 
the 
annual 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth, 
do 
thereby 
testifie 
that 
they 
never 
rightly 
understood 
the 
same. 
My 
having 
onely 
found 
written 
in 
general 
terms 
that 
the 
annual 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth 
about 
the 
Grand 
Orb, 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
admitted, 
because 
it 
is 
not 
probable 
but 
that 
by 
means 
of 
the 
same 
there 
would 
be 
discoverd 
some 
apparent 
mutation 
in 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
and 
not 



hearing 
say 
what 
those 
apparent 
mutations 
ought 
to 
be 
in 
particular, 
and 
in 
what 
stars, 
maketh 
me 
very 
reasonably 
to 
infer 
that 
they 
who 
rely 
upon 
that 
general 
position, 
have 
not 
understood, 
no 
nor 
possibly 
endeavoured 
to 
understand, 
how 
the 
businesse 
of 
these 
mutations 
goeth, 
nor 
what 
things 
those 
are 
which 
they 
say 
ought 
to 
be 
seen. 
The 
mutations 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars 
ought 
to 
be 
in 
some 
greater, 
in 
others 
lesser, 
and 
in 
others 
nothing 
at 
all. 
And 
to 
this 
judgment 
I 
am 
the 
rather 
induced; 
knowing 
that 
the 
annual 
motion 
ascribed 
by 
Copernicus 
to 
the 
Earth, 
if 
it 
should 
appear 
sensible 
in 
the 
Starry 
Sphere, 
is 
not 
to 
make 
apparent 
mutations 
equal 
in 
respect 
to 
all 
the 
stars, 
but 
those 
appearances 
ought 
to 
be 
made 
in 
some 
greater, 
in 
others 
lesser, 
and 
in 
others 
yet 
lesser; 
and 
lastly, 
in 
others 
absolutely 
nothing 
at 
all, 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
vast 
magnitude 
that 
the 
circle 
of 
this 
annual 
motion 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
of. 
As 
for 
the 
mutations 
that 
should 
b 
seen, 
they 
are 
of 
two 
kinds, 
one 
is 
the 
said 
stars 
changing 
apparent 
magnitude, 
and 
the 
other 
their 
variation 
of 
altitudes 
in 
the 
Meridian. 
Upon 
which 
necessarily 
followeth 
the 
mutation 
of 
risings 
and 
settings,and 
oftheirdistancesfrom 
theZenith,&c. 


SAGR. 


Methinks 
I 
see 
preparing 
for 
me 
such 
a 
skean 
of 
these 
revolutions, 
that 
I 
wish 
it 
may 
never 
be 
my 
task 
to 
dis-intangle 
them, 
for 
to 
confesse 
my 
infirmity 
to 
Salviatus, 
I 
have 
sometimes 
thought 
thereon, 
but 
could 
never 
find 
theBandola 
that 
end 
of 
a 
skeen 
wherewith 
housewives 
fasten 
their 
hankes 
of 
yarn, 
thread 
or 
silk. 
Lay-band 
of 
it, 
and 
I 
speak 
not 
so 
much 
of 
this 
which 
pertains 
to 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
as 
of 
another 
more 
terrible 
labour 
which 
you 
bring 
to 
my 
remembrance 
by 
maintaining 
these 
Meridian 
Altitudes, 
Ortive 
Latitudes 
and 
distances 
from 
the 
Vertex, 
&c. 
The 
grand 
difficulty 
in 
Copernicus 
his 
Doctrine, 
is 
that 
which 
concerns 
the 
Phaenomena 
of 
the 
Sun 
and 
fixed 
stars. 
And 
that 
which 
puzzleth 
my 
brains, 
ariseth 
from 
what 
I 
am 
now 
about 
to 
tell 
you. 
Copernicus 
supposeth 
the 
Starry 
Sphere 
immoveable, 
and 
the 
Sun 
in 
the 
centre 
thereof 
immoveable 
also. 
Therefore 
every 
mutation 
which 
seemeth 
unto 
us 
to 
be 
made 
in 
the 
Sun 
or 
in 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
must 
of 
necessity 
befall 
the 
Earth 
and 
be 
ous.

These 
are 
scruples 
worthy 
of 
the 
ingenuity 
of 
Sagredus, 
and 
this 
doubt 
is 
so 
intricate, 
that 
even 
Copernicus 
himself 
almost 
despaired 
of 
being 
able 
to 
explain 
the 
same, 
so 
as 
to 
render 
it 
intelligible, 
which 
we 
see 
as 
well 
by 
his 
own 
confession 
of 
its 
obscurity, 
as 
also 
by 
his, 
at 
two 
several 
times, 
taking 
two 
different 
wayes 
to 
make 
it 
out. 
And, 
I 
ingenuously 
confesse 
that 
I 
understood 
not 
his 
explanation, 
till 
such 
time 
as 
another 
method 
more 
plain

manifest, 
had 
rendred

that

The

made 
by

Earth 
under

and 
the 
diurnal 
motion 
made 
by 
the 
Earth 
about 
its 
own 
centre. 
the 
first 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
to 
be 
made 
by 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth 
in 
or 
about 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
grand 
Orb, 
that 
is 
of 
a 
very 
great 
circle 
described 
in 
the 
plain 
of 
the 
fixed 
and 
immutable 
Ecliptick; 
the 
other, 
namely 
the 
diurnal, 
is 
made 
by 
the 
Globe 
of 
the 
Earth 
in 
it 
self 
about 
its 
own

and 
own 
Axis, 
not

that 
which

especially 
to

alwayes

the

point 
of

in 
so 
much 
that 
the 
Axis 
of 
the 
diurnal 
motion 
doth 
alwayes 
remain 
parallel 
to 
it 
self; 
so 
that 
if 
we 
imagine 
that 
same 
Axis 
to 
be 
continued 
outuntil 
it 
reach 
thefixed 
stars, 
whilst 
thecentre 
of 
the 
Earthis 
encirclingthe 
whole 
Ecliptick 
in 
a 
year, 
the 
said 
Axis 
describeth 
the 
superficies 
of 
an 
oblique 
Cylinder, 
which 
hath 
for 
one 
of 
its 
bases 
the 
said 
annual 
circle, 
and 
for 
the 
other 
a

circle 
imaginarily 
described 
by 
its 
extremity,

(if 
you 
will)

amongst 
the 
fixed 
stars. 
And 
this 
same 
cylinder 
is 
oblique 
to 
the 
Plane 
of 
the 
Ecliptick, 
according 
to 
the 
inclination 
of 
the 
Axis 
that 
describeth

we 
have 
said 
to

whatsoever 
of 
the

as 
befalleth 
unto 
the

of

self; 
and 
therefore 
in 
the 
present 
explanations 
we 
will 
make 
use 
of 
the 
centre, 
as 
if 
it 
were 
any 
whatsoever 
point 
of 
the 
superficies. 
And 
for 
a 
more 
facile 
understanding 
of 
the 
whole, 
The 
fixed 
stars 
placed 
in 
the 
Ecliptick 
never 
elevate 
nor 
descend, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
annual 
motion, 
but 
yet 
approach 
and 
recede. 
let 
us 
design 
the 
same 
in 
lineal 
figures: 
And 
first 
of 
all 
let 
us 
describe 
in 
the 
Plane 
of 
the 
Ecliptick 
the 
circle 
ANBO 
[in 
Fig. 
7. 
] 
and 
let 
us 
understand 
the 
points 
A 
and 
B, 
to 
be 
the 
extreams 
towards 
the 
North 
and 
South; 
that 
is, 
the 
beginning 
of 
[or 
entrance 
into] 
Cancer 
or 
Capricorn, 
and 
let 
us 
prolong 
the 
Diameter 
AB, 



indeterminately 
by 
D 
and 
C 
towards 
the 
Starry 
Sphere. 
I 
say 
now 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
that 
none 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars 
placed 
in 
the 
Ecliptick, 
shall 
ever 
vary 
elevation, 
by 
reason 
of 
any 
whatsoever 
mutation 
made 
by 
the 
Earth 
along 
the 
said 
Plane 
of 
the 
Ecliptick, 
but 
shall 
alwayes 
appear 
in 
the 
same 
superficies, 
although 
the 
Earth 
shall 
approach 
and 
recede 
as 
great 
a 
space 
as 
is 
that 
of 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
Grand 
Orb, 
as 
may 
plainly 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
said 
figure. 
For 
whether 
the 
Earth 
be 
in 
the 
point 
A 
or 
in 
B, 
the 
star 
C 
alwayes 
appeareth 
in 
the 
same 
line 
ABC; 
although 
the 
distance 
BC, 
be 
lesse 
than 
AC, 
by 
the 
whole 
diameter 
AB. 
The 
most 
therefore 
that 
can 
be 
discovered 
in 
the 
star 
C, 
and 
in 
any 
other 
placed 
in 
the 
Ecliptick, 
is 
the 
augmented

SAGR. 


Stay 
a 
while 
I 
pray 
you, 
for 
I 
meet 
with 
a 
certain 
scruple, 
which 
much 
troubleth 
me, 
and 
it 
is 
this: 
That 
the 
star 
C 
may 
be 
seen 
by 
the 
same 
line 
ABC, 
as 
wel 
when 
the 
Earth 
is 
in 
A, 
as 
when 
it 
is 
in 
B, 
I 
understand 
very 
well, 
as 
also 
furthermore 
I 
apprehend 
that 
the 
same 
would 
happen 
in 
all 
the 
points 
oftheline 
AB,

so 
long 
as 
the 
Earth 
should 
passe 
from 
A 
to 
B 
bythe 
said 
line; 
but 
it 
passing 
thither, 
as 
isto 
besupposed, 
by 
the 
arch 
ANB, 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
when 
it 
shall 
be 
in 
the 
point 
N, 
and 
in 
any 
other 
except 
those 
two 
A 
and 
B, 
the 
said 
star 
shall 
no 
longer 
be 
observed 
in 
the 
line 
AB; 
but 
in 
others. 
So 
that, 
if 
the 
appearing 
under 
several 
lines 
ought 
to 
cause 
apparent 
mutations, 
some 
difference 
must 
needs 
appear 
in 
this 
case. 
Nay 
more, 
I 
will 
speak 
it 
with 
that 
Philosophical 
freedom, 
which 
ought 
to 
be 
allowed 
amongst 
Philosophick 
friends, 
methinks 
that 
you, 
contradicting 
your 
self, 
deny 
that 
now, 
which 
but 
even 
now 
to 
our 
admiration, 
you 
proved 
to 
be 
really 
true, 
and 
considerable; 
I 
mean 
that 
which 
happeneth 
in 
the 
Planets, 
and 
particularly 
in 
the 
three 
superiour 
ones,

I 
have

I 
say 
therefore 
that 
I 
had 
purposely 
dissembled 
this 
objection, 
but 
yet 
not 
with 
any 
intent 
to 
deceive 
you, 
and 
to 
put 
any 
falshood 
upon 
you, 
as 
it 
might 
have 
happened 
if 
the 
objection 
by 
me 
disguised, 
and 
by 
you 
over-lookt, 
had 
been 
the 
same 
in 
effect 
as 
it 
seemed 
to 
be 
in

that 
is, 
really

it 
is 
not 
so; 
nay 
I 
rather 
suspect 
that

try 
me, 
you 
make 
as

you 
did 
not 
see 
its 
nullity. 
But 
I 
will 
herein 
be 
too 
hard 
for 
you, 
and 
force 
from 
your 
tongue, 
that 
which 
you 
would 
so 
artificially 
conceal; 
and 
therefore 
tell 
me, 
what 
that 
thing 
should 
be, 
whereby 
you 
come 
to 
know 
the 
station 
and 
retrogradation 
of 
the

which 
is 
derived 
from 
the

aud 
which

so 
great, 
that 
at

some 
foot-steps 
of 
such

SAGR. 


This 
demand 
of 
yours 
containeth 
two 
questions, 
to 
which 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
I 
make 
reply; 
the 
first 
relates 
to 
the 
imputation 
which 
you 
lay 
upon 
me 
of 
a 
Dissembler; 
the 
other 
concerneth 
that 
which 
may 
appear 
in 
the 
stars, 
&c. 
As 
to 
the 
first, 
I 
will 
say 
with 
your 
permission, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
true, 
that 
I 
have 
dissembled 
my 
knowing 
the 
nullity 
of 
that 
objection; 
and

assure 
you 
of 
the 
same,Inow

But 
yet 
I 
do 
not 
understand 
how 
it 
can 
be, 
that 
you 
spake 
not 
friendly, 
when 
you 
said 
you 
did 
not 
know 
that 
same 
fallacy 
which 
you 
now 
confesse 
that 
you 
know 
verywell. 


SAGR. 


The 
very 
confession 
of 
knowing 
it 
may 
assure 
you 
that 
I 
did 
not 
dissemble, 
when 
I 
said 
that 
I 
did 
not 
understand 
it; 
for 
if 
I 
had 
had 
a 
mind, 
and 
would 
dissemble, 
who 
could 
hinder 
me 
from 
continuing 
in 
the 
same 
simulation, 
and 



denying 
still 
that 
I 
understand 
the 
fallacy? 
I 
say 
therefore 
that 
I 
understood 
not 
the 
same, 
at 
that 
time, 
but 
that 
I 
do 
now 
at 
this 
present 
apprehend 
it, 
for 
that 
you 
have 
prompted 
my 
intellect, 
first 
by 
telling 
me 
resolutely 
that 
it 
is 
null, 
and 
then 
by 
beginning 
to 
question 
me 
so 
at 
large 
what 
thing 
that 
might 
be, 
whereby 
I 
might 
come 
to 
know 
the 
station 
and 
retrogradation 
of 
the 
Planets; 
The 
station, 
direction 
and 
retrogradation 
of 
the 
Planets 
is 
known, 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
fixed 
stars. 
and 
because 
this 
is 
known 
by 
comparing 
them 
with 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
in 
relation 
to 
which, 
they 
are 
seen 
to 
vary 
their 
motions, 
one 
while 
towards 
the 
West, 
and 
another 
towards 
the 
East, 
and 
sometimes 
to 
abide 
immoveable; 
and 
because 
there 
is 
not 
any 
thing 
above 
the 
Starry 
Sphere, 
immensely 
more 
remote 
from 
us, 
and 
visible 
unto 
us, 
wherewith 
we 
may 
compare 
our 
fixed 
stars, 
therefore 
we 
cannot 
discover 
in 
the 
fixed 
stars 
any 
foot-steps 
of 
what 
appeareth 
to 
us 
in 
the 
Planets. 
This 
I 
believe 
is 
the 
substanceofthatwhich 
youwouldforcefromme.

so, 
An 
Indice 
is 
the 
fixed 
stars 
like 
to 
that 
which 
is 
in 
the 
Plane 
s, 
is 
an 
argument 
of 
the 
Earths 
annual 
motion. 
with 
the 
addition 
moreover 
of 
your 
admirable 
ingenuity; 
and 
if 
with 
half 
a 
word 
I 
did 
open 
your 
eyes, 
you 
by 
the 
like 
have 
remembred 
me 
that 
it 
is 
not 
altogether 
impossible, 
but 
that 
sometime 
or 
other 
something 
observable 
may 
be 
found 
amongst 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
by 
which 
it 
may 
be 
gathered 
wherein 
the 
annual 
conversion 
resides, 
so 
as 
that 
they 
also 
no 
lesse 
than 
the 
Planets 
and 
Sun 
it 
self, 
may 
appear 
in 
judgment 
to 
bear 
witnesse 
of 
that 
motion, 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
Earth; 
for 
I 
do 
not 
think 
that 
the 
sta 
s 
are 
spread 
in 
a 
spherical 
superficies 
equally 
remote 
from 
a 
common 
centre, 
but 
hold, 
that 
their 
distances 
from 
us 
are 
so 
various, 
that 
some 
of 
them 
may 
be 
twice 
and 
thrice 
as 
remote 
as 
others; 
so 
that 
if 
with 
the 
Telescope 
one 
should 
observe 
a 
very 
small 
star 
neer 
to 
one 
of 
the 
bigger, 
and 
which 
therefore 
was 
very 
exceeding 
high, 
it 
might 
happen, 
that 
some 
sensible 
mutation 
might 
fall 
out 
between 
them, 
correspondent 
to 
that 
of 
the 
superiour 
Planets. 
And 
so 
much 
shall 
serve 
to 
have 
spoken 
at 
this 
time 
touching 
the 
stars 
placed 
in 
the 
Ecliptick. 
The

Let 
us 
now 
come 
to 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
placed 
out 
of 
the 
Ecliptick, 
and 
let 
us 
suppose 
a

circle

upon 
[i.

to] 
the

same; 
and 
let 
it, 
for 
example, 
be 
a 
circle 
that 
in 
the 
Starry 
Sphere 



answers 
to 
the 
Solstitial 
Colure, 
and 
let 
us 
mark 
it 
CEH 
[in 
Fig. 
8. 
] 
which 
shall 
happen 
to 
be 
withal 
a 
Meridian, 
and 
in 
it 
we 
will 
take 
a 
star 
without 
the 
Ecliptick, 
which 
let 
be 
E. 
Now 
this 
star 
will 
indeed 
vary 
its 
elevation 
upon 
the 
Earths 
motion; 
for 
from 
the 
Earth 
in 
A 
it 
shall 
be 
seen 
according 
to 
the 
ray 
AE, 
with 
the 
elevation 
of 
the 
angle 
EAC; 
but 
from 
the 
Earth 
placed 
in 
B, 
it 
shall 
be 
seen 
according 
to 
the 
ray 
BE, 
with 
the 
elevation 
of 
the 
angle 
EBC, 
bigger 
than 
the 
other 
EAC, 
that 
being 
extern, 
and 
this 
intern 
and 
opposite 
in 
the 
triangle 
EAB, 
the 
distance 
therefore 
of 
the 
star

from

For 
in 
the 
triangle 
EAB, 
the 
side 
AB 
being 
continued 
to 
C, 
the 
exteriour 
angle 
EBC 
(as 
being 
equal 
to 
the 
two 
interiour 
and 
opposite 
E 
and 
A) 
exceedeth 
the 
said 
angle 
A, 
by 
the 
quantity 
of 
the 
angle 
E. 
And 
if 
we 
should 
take 
another 
star 
in 
thesameMeridian,moreremotefrom 
the 
Ecliptick,asforinstancethe 
starH, 
the 
diversity 
in 
it 
shall 
be 
greater 
by 
being 
observed 
from 
the 
two 
stations 
A 
and 
B, 
according 
as 
the 
angle 
AHB 
is 
greater 
than 
the 
other 
E; 
which 
angle 
shall 
encrease 
continually 
according 
as 
the 
observed 
star 
shall 
be 
farther 
and 
farther 
from 
the 
Ecliptick, 
till 
that 
at 
last 
the 
greatest 
mutation 
will 
appear 
in 
that 
star 
that 
should 
be 
placed 
in 
the 
very 
Pole 
of 
the 
Ecliptick. 
As 
for 
a 
full 
understanding 
thereof 
we 
thus 
demonstrate. 
Suppose 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
Grand 
Orb 
to 
be 
AB, 
whose 
centre 
[in 
the 
same 
Figure] 
is 
G, 
and 
let 
it 
be 
supposed 
to 
be 
continued 
out 
as 
far 
as 
the 
Starry 
Sphere 
in 
the 
points 
D 
and 
C, 
and 
from 
the 
centre 
G 
let 
there 
be 
erected 
the 
Axis 
of 
the 
Ecliptick 
GF, 
prolonged 
till 
it 
arrive 
at 
the 
said 
Sphere, 
in 
which 
a 
Meridian 
DFC 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
described, 
that 
shall 
be 
perpendicular 
to 
the 
Plane 
of 
the 
Ecliptick; 
and 
in 
the 
arch 
FC 
any 
points 
H 
and 
E, 
are 
imagined 
to 
be 
taken, 
as 
places 
of 
fixed 
stars: 
Let 
the 
lines 
FA, 
FB, 
AH, 
HG, 
HB, 
AE, 
GE, 
BE, 
be 
conjoyned. 
And 
let 
the 
angle 
of 
difference, 
or, 
if 
you 
will, 
the 
Parallax 
of 
the 
star 
placed 
in 
the 
Pole 
F, 
be 
AFB, 
and 
let 
that 
of 
the 
star 
placed 
in 
H, 
be 
the 
angle 
AHB, 
and 
let 
that 
of 
the 
star 
in 
E, 
be 
the 
angle 
AEB. 
I 
say, 
that 
the 
angle 
of 
difference 
of 
the 
Polar 
star 
F, 
is 
the 
greatest, 
and 
that 
of 
the 
rest, 
those 
that 
are 
nearer 
to 
the 
greatest 
are 
bigger 
than 
the 
more 
remote; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
that 
the 
angle 
F 
is 
bigger 
than 
the 
angle 
H, 
and 
this 
bigger 
than 
the 
angle 


E. 
Now 
about 
the 
triangle 
FAB, 
let 
us 
suppose 
a 
circle 
to 
be 
described. 
And 
because 
the 
angle 
F 
is 
acute, 
(by 
reason 
that 
its 
base 
AB 
is 
lesse 
than 
the 
diameter 
DC, 
of 
the 
semicircle 
DFC) 
it 
shall 
be 
placed 
in 
the 
greater 
portion 

of 
the 
circumscribed 
circle 
cut 
by 
the 
base 
AB. 
And 
because 
the 
said 
AB 
is 
divided 
in 
the 
midst, 
and 
at 
right 
angles 
by 
FG, 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
circumscribed 
circle 
shall 
be 
in 
the 
line 
FG, 
which 
let 
be 
the 
point 
I; 
and 
because 
that 
of 
such 
lines 
as 
are 
drawn 
from 
the 
point 
G, 
which 
is 
not 
the 
centre, 
unto 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
circumscribed 
circle, 
the 
biggest 
is 
that 
which 
passeth 
by 
the 
centre, 
GF 
shall 
be 
bigger 
than 
any 
other 
that 
is 
drawn 
from 
the 
point 
G, 
to 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
said 
circle; 
and 
therefore 
that 
circumference 
will 
cut 
the 
line 
GH 
(which 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
line 
GF) 
and 
cutting 
GH, 
it 
will 
also 
cut 
AH. 
Let 
it 
cut 
it 
in 
L, 
and 
conjoyn 
the 
line 
LB. 
These 
two 
angles, 
therefore, 
AFB 
and 
ALB 
shall 
be 
equal, 
as 
being 
in 
the 
same 
portion 
of 
the 
circle 
circumscribed. 
But 
ALB 
external, 
is 
bigger 
than 
the 
internal 
H; 
therefore 
the 
angle 
F 
is 
bigger 
than 
the 
angle 
H. 
And 
by 
the 
same 
method 
we 
might 
demonstrate 
the 
angle 
H 
to 
be 
bigger 
than 
the 
angle 
E, 
because 
that 
of 
the 
circle 
described 
about 
the 
triangle 
AHB, 
the 
centre 
is 
in 
the 
perpendicular 
GF, 
to 
which 
the 
line 
GH 
is 
nearer 
than 
the 
line 
GE, 
and 
therefore 
the 
circumference 
of 
it 
cutteth 
GE, 
and 
also 
AE, 
whereupon 
the 
proposition 
is 
manifest. 
We 
will 
conclude 
from 
hence, 
that 
the 
difference 
of 
appearance, 
(which 
with 
the 
proper 
term 
of 
art, 
we 
might 
call 
the 
Parallax 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars) 
is 
greater, 
or 
lesse, 
according 
as 
the 
Stars 
observed 
are 
more 
or 
lesse 
adjacent 
to 
the 
Pole 
of 
the 
Ecliptick, 
so 
that, 
in 
conclusion 
of 
those 
Stars 
that 
are 
in 
the 
Ecliptick 
it 
self, 
the 
said 
diversity 
is 
reduced 
to 
nothing. 
In 
the 
next 
place, 
The 
Earth 
approacheth 
or 
recedeth 
from 
the 
fixed 
starsofthe 
Ecliptick, 
the 
quantity 
of 
the 
Diameter 
of 
the 
Grand 
Orb. 
as 
to 
the 
Earths 
accession 
by 
that 
motion 
to, 
or 
recession 
from 
the 
Stars, 
it 
appeareth 
to, 
and 
recedeth 
from 
those 
that 
are 
in 
the 
Ecliptick, 
the 
quantity 
of 
the 
whole 
diameter 
of 
the 
grand 
Orb, 
as 
we 
did 
see 
even 
now, 
but 
that 
accession 
or 
recession 
to, 
or 
from 
the 
stars 
about 
the 
Pole 
of 
the 
Ecliptick, 
is 
almost 
nothing; 
and 
in 
going 
to 
and 
from 
others, 
this 
difference 
groweth 
greater, 
according 
as 
they 
are 
neerer 
to 
the 
Ecliptick. 
We 
may, 
The 
stars 
nearer 
to 
us 
make 
greater 
differences 
than 
the 
more 
remote. 
in 
the 
third 
place, 
know, 
that 
the 
said 
difference 
of 
Aspect 
groweth 
greater 
orlesser, 
accordingas 
the 
Starobservedshall 
be 
neerer 
to 
us, 
or 
farther 
from 
us. 
For 
if 
we 
draw 
another 
Meridian, 
lesse 
distant 
from 
the 
Earth; 
as 
for 
example, 
this 
DFI 
[in 
Fig. 
7.

a 
Star 
placed 
in 
F, 
and 
seen 
by 
the 
same 
ray 
AFE, 
the 
Earth 
being 
in 
A, 
would, 
in 
case 
it 
should 
be 
observed 
from 
the 
Earth 
in 
B, 
appear 
according 
to 
the 
ray 
BF, 
and 
would 
make 
the 
angle 
of 
difference, 
namely, 
BFA, 
bigger 
than 
the 
former 
AEB, 
being

SAGR. 


With 
great 
delight, 
and 
also 
benefit 
have 
I 
heard 
your 
discourse; 
The 
Epilogue 
of 
the 
Phaenomena 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars 
caused 
by 
the 
annual 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth. 
and 
that 
I 
may 
be 
certain, 
whether 
I 
have 
rightly 
understood 
the 
same, 
I 
shall 
give 
you 
the 
summe 
of 
the 
Conclusions 
in 
a 
few 
words. 
As 
I 
take 
it, 
you 
have 
explained 
to 
us 
the 
different 
appearances, 
that 
by 
means 
of 
the 
Earths 
annual 
motion, 
may 
be 
by 
us 
observed 
in 
the 
fixed 
stars 
to 
be 
of 
two 
kinds: 
The 
one 
is, 
that 
of 
their 
apparent 
magnitudes 
varied, 
according 
as 
we, 
transported 
by 
the 
Earth, 
approach 
or 
recede 
from 
the 
same: 
The 
other 
(which 
likewise 
dependeth 
on 
the 
same 
accession 
and 
recession) 
their 
appearing 
unto 
us 
in 
the 
same 
Meridian, 
one 
while 
more 
elevated, 
and 
another 
while 
lesse. 
Moreover, 
you 
tell 
us 
(and 
I 
understand 
it 
very 
well) 
that 
the 
one 
and 
other 
of 
these 
mutations 
are 
not 
made 
alike 
in 
all 
the 
stars, 
but 
in 
some 
greater, 
and 
in 
others 
lesser, 
and 
in 
others 
not 
at 
all. 
The 
accession 
and 
recession 
whereby 
the 
same 
star 
ought 
to 
appear, 
one 
while 
bigger, 
and 
another 
while 
lesser, 
is 
insensible, 
and 
almost 
nothing 
in 
the 
stars 
neer 
unto 
the 
pole 
of 
the 
Ecliptick, 
but 
is 
greatest 
in 
the 
stars 
placed 
in 
the 
Ecliptick 
it 
self, 
and 
indifferent 
in 
the 
intermediate: 
the 
contrary 
happens 
in 
the 
other 
difference, 
that 
is, 
the 
elevation 
or 
depression 
of 
the 
stars 
placed 
in 
the 
Ecliptick 
is 
nothing 
at 
all, 
greatest 
in 
those 
neerest 
to 
the 
Pole 
of 
the 
said 
Ecliptick, 
and 
indifferent 
in 
the 
intermediate. 
Besides, 
both 
these 
differences 
are 
more 
sensible 
in 
the 
Stars 
neerest 
to 
us, 
in 
the 
more 
remote 
lesse 
sensible, 
and 
in 
those 
that 
are 
very 
far 
distant 
wholly 
disappear. 
This 
is, 
as 
to 
what 
concerns 
my 
self; 
it 
remaineth 
now, 
as 
I 
conceive, 
that 
something 
be 
said 
for 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
Simplicius, 
who, 
as 
I 
believe, 
will 
not 
easily 
be 
made 
to 
over-passe 
those 
differences, 
as 
insensible 
that 
are 
derived 
from 
a 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth 
so 
vast, 
and 
from 
a 
mutation 
that 
transports 
the 
Earth 
into 
places 
twiceasfardistantfrom 
usastheSun. 


SIMP. 


Truth 
is, 
to 
speak 
freely, 
I 
am 
very 
loth 
to 
confesse, 
that 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
fixed 
Stars 
ought 
to 
be 
such, 
that 
in 
them 
the 
fore-mentioned 
differences 
should 
bewhollyimperceptible. 


SALV. 



Do 
not 
throw 
your 
self 
into 
absolute 
despair, 
Simplicius, 
for 
there 
may 
perhaps 
yet 
some 
qualification 
be 
found 
for 
your 
difficulties. 
And 
first, 
that 
the 
apparent 
magnitude 
of 
the 
stars 
is 
not 
seen 
to 
make 
any 
sensible 
alteration, 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
judged 
by 
you 
a 
thing 
improbable, 
in 
regard 
you 
see 
the 
guesses 
of 
men 
in 
this 
particular 
to 
be 
so 
grossely 
erroneous, 
especially 
in 
looking 
upon 
splendid 
objects; 
and 
you 
your 
self 
beholding 
v. 
g. 
a 
lighted 
Torch 
at 
the 
distance 
of 
200 
paces, 
In 
objects 
far 
remote, 
and 
luminous, 
a 
small 
approach 
or 
recession 
is 
imperceptible. 
if 
it 
approach 
nearer 
to 
you 
3. 
or 
4. 
yards, 
do 
you 
think 
that 
it 
will 
shew 
any 
whit 
encreased 
in 
magnitude? 
I 
for 
my 
part 
should 
not 
perceive 
it 
certainly, 
although 
it 
should 
approach 
20. 
or 
30. 
yards 
nearer; 
nay 
it 
hath 
sometimes 
happened 
that 
in 
seeing 
such 
a 
light 
at 
that 
distance 
I 
know 
not 
how 
to 
resolve 
whether 
it 
came 
towards 
me, 
or 
retreated 
from 
me, 
when 
as 
it 
did 
in 
reality 
approach 
nearer 
to 
me. 
But 
what 
need 
I 
speak 
of 
this? 
If 
the 
self 
same 
accession 
and 
recession 
(I

Pray 
Sir, 
put 
your 
self 
to 
no 
farther 
trouble 
in 
this 
particular, 
for 
I 
already 
conceive 
that 
what 
hath 
been 
spoken 
touching 
the 
unaltered 
apparent 
magnitude 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars 
may 
very 
well 
come 
to 
passe, 
but 
what 
shall 
we 
say 
of 
the 
other 
difficulty 
that 
proceeds 
from 
not 
perceiving 
any 
variation 
in

SALV. 


We 
will 
say 
that 
which 
peradventure 
may 
satisfie 
you 
also 
in 
this 
particular. 
And 
to 
make 
short, 
would 
you 
not 
be 
satisfied 
if 
there 
should 
be 
discovered 
in 
the 
stars 
face 
mutations 
that 
you 
think 
ought 
to 
be 
discovered, 
in

SALV. 


I 
could 
wish 
you 
would 
say 
that 
in 
case 
such 
a 
difference 
were 
discovered, 
If 
in 
the 
fixed 
stars 
one 
should 
discover 
any 
annual 
mutation, 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth 
would 
be 
undeniable. 
nothing 
more 
would 
remain 
behind, 
that 
might 
render 
the 
mobility 
of 
the 
Earth 
questionable. 
But 
although 
yet 
that 
should 
not 
sensibly 
appear▪ 
yet 
is 
not 
its 
mobility 
removed, 
nor 
its 
immobility 
necessarily 
proved, 
it 
being 
possible, 
(as 
Copernicus 
affirmeth) 
that 
the 
immense 
distance 
of 
the 
Starry 
Sphere 
rendereth 
such 
very 
small 
Phaenomenaunobservable;thewhichasalready

not 
have

hitherto 
so 
much 
as 
sought 
for, 
or 
if 
sought 
for, 
yet 
not 
sought 
for 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
they 
ought, 
It 
is 
proved 
what 
small 
credit 
is 
to 
be 
given 
to 
Astronomical 
Instruments 
in 
minute 
observations. 
to 
wit, 
with 
that 
exactnesse 
which 
to 
so 
minute 
a 
punctuality 
would 
be 
necessary; 
which 
exactnesse 
is 
very 
difficult 
to 
obtain, 
as 
well 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
deficiency 
of 
Astronomical 
Instruments, 
subject 
to 
many 
alterations, 
as 
also 
through 
the 
fault 
of 
those 
that 
manage 
them 
with 
less 
diligence 
then 
is 
requisite. 
A 
necessary 
argument 
how 
little 
credit 
is 
to 
be 
given 
to 
those 
observations 
may 
be 
deduced 
from 
the 
differences 
which 
we 
find 
amongst 
Astronomers 
in 
assigning 
the 
places, 
I 
will 
not 
say, 
of 
the 
new 
Stars 
or 
Comets, 
but 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars 
themselves, 
even 
to 
the 
altitudes 
of 
the 
very 
Poles, 
in 
which, 
most 
an 
end, 
they 
are 
found 
to 
differ 
from 
one 
another 
many 
minutes. 
And 
to 
speak 
the 
truth, 
who 
can

a 
Quadrant, 
or 
Sextant, 
that 
at 
most 
shall

himself 
in

of

perpendicular, 
or 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
sights, 
not 
to 
erre 
two 
or 
three

which 
in 
its 
circumference 
shall 
not 
amount 
to 
the 
breadth 
of 
a

of 
Or 
Mi 
Mylet? 
Besides 
that, 
it 
is 
almost 
impossible, 
that 
the 
Instrument 
should 
be 
made, 
and 
kept 
with 
absolute 
exactnesse.

did 
plainly 
observe 
the

upon

of

about 
60. 
miles 
from 
thence, 
leaving 
discovered 
of

a 
small 
streak 
or 
filament▪ 
towards 
the 
North, 
whose 
breadth 
was 
not 
the 
hundredth 
part 
of 
its 
Diameter; 
and 
the 
following 
Evening 
at 
the 
like 
setting, 
it 
shew’d 
such 
another 
part 
of 
it, 
but 
notably 
more 
small, 
a 
necessary 
argument, 
that 
it 
had 
begun 
to 
recede 
from 
the 
Tropick; 
and 
the 
regression 
of 
the 
Sun 
from 
the 
first 
to 
the 
second 
observation, 
doth 
not 
import 
doubtlesse 
a 
second 
minute 
in 
the 
East. 
A 
place 
accommodated 
for 
the 
observation 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
as 
to 
what 
concers 
the 
annual 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth. 
The 
observation 
made 
afterwards 
with 
an 
exquisite 
Telescope, 
andthatmultiplyeth 
the 
Discus 
of 
the 
Sun 
more 
than 
a 
thousand 
times, 
would 
prove 
easie, 
and 
with 
all 
delightful. 
Now 
with 
such 
an 
Instrument 
as 
this, 
I 
would 
have 
observations 
to 
be 
made 
in 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
making 
use 
of 
some 
of 
those 
wherein 
the 
mutation 
ought 
to 
appear 
more 
conspicuous, 
such 
as 
are 
(as 
hath 
already 
been 
declared) 
the 
more 
remote 
from 
the 
Ecliptick, 
amongst 
which 
the 
Harp 
a 
very 
great 
star, 
and 
near 
to 
the 
Pole 
of 
the 
Ecliptick, 
would 
be 
very 
proper 
in 
Countries 
far 
North, 
proceeding 
according 
to 
the 
manner 
that 
I 
shall 
shew 
by 
and 
by, 
but 
in 
theuseofanotherstar;andIhavealreadyfanciedtomyselfa 
placeverywell 
adapted 
for 
such 
an 
observation. 
The 
place 
is 
an 
open 
Plane, 
upon 
which 
towards 
the 
North 
there 
riseth 
a 
very 
eminent 
Mountain, 
in 
the 
apex 
or 
top 
whereof 
is 
built 
a 
little 
Chappel, 
situate 
East 
and 
West, 
so 
as 
that 
the 
ridg 
of 



its 
Roof 
may 
intersect 
at 
right 
angles, 
the 
meridian 
of 
some 
building 
standing 
in 
the 
Plane. 
I 
will 
place 
a 
beam 
parallel 
to 
the 
said 
ridg, 
or 
top 
of 
the 
Roof, 
and 
distant 
from 
it 
a 
yard 
or 
thereabouts. 
This 
being 
placed, 
I 
will 
seek 
in 
the 
Plain 
the 
place 
from 
whence 
one 
of 
the 
stars 
of 
Charls’s 
Waine, 
in 
passing 
by 
the 
Meridian, 
cometh 
to 
hide 
it 
self 
behind 
the 
beam 
so 
placed, 
or 
in 
case 
the 
beam 
should 
not 
be 
so 
big 
as 
to 
hide 
the 
star, 
I 
will 
finde 
a 
station 
where 
one 
may 
see 
the 
said 
beam 
to 
cut 
the 
said 
star 
into 
two 
equal 
parts; 
an 
effect 
that 
with 
an 
* 
exquisite 
Telescope 
may 
be 
perfectly 
discerned. 
And 
if 
in 
the 
place 
where 
the 
said 
accident 
is 
discovered, 
there 
were 
some 
building, 
it 
will 
be 
the 
more 
commodious; 
but 
if 
not, 
I 
will 
cause 
a 
Pole 
to 
be 
stuck 
very 
fast 
in 
the 
ground, 
withsomestanding 
mark 
todirect 
whereto 
placetheeyeanew,when 
ever 
I 
have 
a 
mindto 
repeat 
theobservation. 
Thefirstof 
which 
observationsI 
will 
make 
about 
the 
Summer 
Solstice, 
to 
continue 
afterwards 
from 
Moneth 
to 
Moneth, 
or 
when 
I 
shall 
so 
please, 
to 
the 
other 
Solstice; 
with 
which 
observation 
one 
may 
discover 
the 
elevation 
and 
depression 
of 
the 
star, 
though 
it 
be 
very 
small. 
And 
if 
in 
that 
operation 
it 
shall 
happen, 
that 
any 
mutation 
shall 
discover 
it 
self, 
what 
and 
how 
great 
benefit 
will 
it 
bring 
to 
Astronomy? 
Seeing 
that 
thereby, 
besides 
our 
being 
assured 
of 
the 
annual 
motion, 
we 
may

I 
very 
well 
comprehend 
your 
whole

and 
the 
operation 
seems 
to 
me 
so 
easie, 
and 
so 
commodious 
for 
the 
purpose, 
that 
it 
may 
very 
rationally 
be 
thought, 
that 
either 
Copernicus 
himself, 
or 
some 
other 
Astronomer 
had

But 
I 
judg 
the 
quite 
contrary, 
for 
it 
is 
not 
probable, 
that 
if 
any 
one 
had 
experimented 
it, 
he 
would 
nothave 
mentioned

whether 
itfellout 
in

or 
that 
opinion; 
besides 
that, 
no 
man 
that 
I 
can 
find, 
either 
for 
this, 
or 
any 
other 
end, 
did 
ever 
go 
about 
to 
make 
such 
an

I 
am 
fully 
satisfied 
with 
what

But 
seeing 
that 
it 
is 
a 
great 
while 
to

if 
you 
desire 
thatI 
shall

let 
it 
not

those

laying

proceed 
to 
shew 
us, 
that 
the 
motions 
which

assigns 
to 
the 
Earth 
being 
taken 
for 
granted, 
and 
supposing 
the

immoveable, 
theremay 
follow 
the

accidents 
touching

I 
neither 
ought,

deny 
any

that

request: 
And 
the 
delay 
by 
me 
desired 
was 
to 
no 
other 
end, 
save 
only 
that 
I 
might 
have 
time 
once 
again 
to 
methodize 
those 
prefatory 
points, 
in 
my 
fancy, 
that 
serve 
for 
a 
large 
and 
plain 
declaration 
of 
the 
manner 
how 
the 
forenamed 
accidents 
follow, 
as 
well 
in 
the

with 
much 
greater

difficult

Necessary 
prepositions 
for

conceiving 
of

consequences 
of

Earths 
motion. 
than 
that 
used 
by 
Copernicus, 
to 
render 
likewise 
the 
apprehending 
of 
it 
somewhat 
lesse 
obscure. 
Which 
that 
I 
may 
do, 
I 
will 
propose 
certain 
suppositions 
of 
themselvesknownand 
manifest,andtheyshall 
bethesethatfollow. 


First, 
I 
suppose 
that 
the 
Earth 
is 
a 
spherical 
body, 
turning 
round 
upon 
its 
own 
Axis 
and 
Poles, 
and 
that 
each 
point 
assigned 
in 
its 
superficies, 
describeth 
the 
circumference 
of 
a 
circle, 
greater 
or 
lesser, 
according 
as 
the 
point 
assigned 
shall 
be 
neerer 
or 
farther 
from 
the 
Poles: 
And 
that 
of 
these 
circles 
the 
greatest 
is 
that 
which 
is 
described 
by 
a 
point 
equidistant 
from 
the 
said 
Poles; 
and 
all 
thesecirclesareparalleltoeachother;and 
Parallelswewillcallthem. 


Secondly, 
The 
Earth 
being 
of 
a 
Spherical 
Figure, 
and 
of 
an 
opacous 
substance, 
it 
is 
continually 
illuminated 
by 
the 
Sun, 
according 
to 
the 
half 
of 
its 



surface, 
the 
other 
half 
remaining 
obscure, 
and 
the 
boundary 
that 
distinguisheth 
the 
illuminated 
part 
from 
the 
dark 
being 
a 
grand 
circle, 
we 
will 
call 
thatcircle 
the 
terminatorofthelight. 


Thirdly, 
If 
the 
Circle 
that 
is 
terminator 
of 
the 
light 
should 
passe 
by 
the 
Poles 
of 
the 
Earth, 
it 
would 
cut 
(being 
a 
grand 
and 
principal 
circle) 
all 
the 
parallels 
into 
equal 
parts; 
but 
not 
passing 
by 
the 
Poles, 
it 
would 
cut 
them 
all 
in 
parts 
unequal, 
except 
only 
the 
circle 
in 
the 
middle, 
which, 
as 
being 
a 
grand 
circle 
willbe 
cut 
intoequalparts. 


Fourthly, 
The 
Earth 
turning 
round 
upon 
its 
own 
Poles, 
the 
quantities 
of 
dayes 
and 
nights 
are 
termined 
by 
the 
arches 
of 
the 
Parallels, 
intersected 
by 
the 
circle, 
that 
is, 
the 
terminator 
of 
the 
light, 
and 
the 
arch 
that 
is 
scituate

These

being

A

Scheme 
representing

Copernican 
Hypothesis, 
and 
its 
consequences. 
for 
the 
more 
clear 
understanding 
of 
that 
which 
remaines 
to 
be 
said, 
we 
will 
lay 
it 
down 
in 
a 
Figure. 
And 
first, 
we 
will 
draw 
the 
circumference 
of 
a 
circle, 
that 
shall 
represent 
unto 
us 
that 
of 
the 
grand 
Orb 
described 
in 
the 
plain 
of 
the 
Ecliptick, 
and 
this 
we 
will 
divide 
into 
four 
equal 
parts 
with 
the 
two 
diameters 
Capricorn 
Cancer, 
and 
Libra 
Aries, 
which, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
shall 
represent 
unto 
us 
the 
four 
Cardinal 
points, 
that 
is, 
the 
two 
Solstices, 
and 
the 
two 
Equinoctials; 
and 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
that 
circle 
we 
will 
place 
the 
Sun 
O, 
fixed 
and 
immoveable.

Let 
usnextdrawaboutthefour 
points, 
Capricorn,Cancer,Libraand 
Aries, 
as 
centres, 
four 
equal 
circles, 
which 
represent 
unto 
us 
the 
Earth 
placed 
in 
them 
at 
four 
several 
times 
of 
the 
year. 
The 
which, 
with 
its 
centre, 
in 
the 
space 
of 
a 
year, 
passeth 
through 
the 
whole 
circumference, 
Capricorn, 
Aries, 
Cancer, 
Libra,moving 
fromEastto 
West, 
that 
is, 
accordingtothe 
order 
of 
the 
Signes. 
It 
is 
already 
manifest, 
that 
whilst 
the 
Earth 
is 
in 
Capricorn, 
The 
Suns 
annual 
motion, 
how 
it 
comes 
to 
passe, 
according 
to 
Copernicus. 
the 
Sun 
will 
appear 
in 
Cancer, 
and 
the 
Earth 
moving 
along 
the 
arch 
Capricorn 
Aries, 
the 
Sun 
will 
seem 
to 
move 
along 
the 
arch 
Cancer 
Libra, 
and 
in 
short, 
will 
run 
thorow 
the 



Zodiack 
according 
to 
the 
order 
of 
the 
Signes, 
in 
the 
space 
of 
a 
year; 
and 
by 
this 
first 
assumption, 
without 
all 
question, 
full 
satisfaction 
is 
given 
for 
the 
Suns 
apparent 
annual 
motion 
under 
the 
Ecliptick. 
Now, 
coming 
to 
the 
other, 
that 
is, 
the 
diurnal 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth 
in 
it 
self, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
establish 
its 
Poles 
and 
its 
Axis, 
the 
which 
must 
be 
understood 
not 
to 
be 
erect 
perpendicularly 
upon 
the 
plain 
of 
the 
Ecliptick, 
that 
is, 
not 
to 
be 
parallel 
to 
the 
Axis 
of 
the 
grand 
Orb, 
but 
declining 
from 
a 
right 
angle 
23 
degrees 
and 
an 
half, 
or 
thereabouts, 
with 
its 
North 
Pole 
towards 
the 
Axis 
of 
the 
grand 
Orb, 
the 
Earths 
centre 
being 
in 
the 
Solstitial 
point 
of 
Capricorn. 
Supposing 
therefore 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
to 
have 
its 
centre 
in 
the 
point 
Capricorn, 
we 
will 
describe 
its 
Poles 
and 
Axis 
AB, 
inclined 
upon 
the 
diameter 
Capricorn 
Cancer 
23 
degrees 
and 
an 
half; 
so 
that 
the 
angle 
A 
Capricorn 
Cancer 
cometh 
tobe 
the 
complementof 
aQuadrant 
orRadius, 
thatis,66degreesand 
anhalf; 
and 
thisinclinationmust 
be 
understood 
to 
be 
immutable, 
andwe 
will 
suppose 
the 
superiour 
Pole 
A 
to 
be 
Boreal, 
or 
North, 
and 
the 
other 
Austral, 
or 
South. 
Now 
imagining 
the 
Earth 
to 
revolve 
in 
it 
self 
about 
the 
Axis 
AB 
in 
twenty 
four 
hours, 
from 
West 
to 
East, 
there 
shall 
by 
all 
the 
points 
assigned 
in 
its 
superficies, 
be 
circles 
described 
parallel 
to 
each 
other. 
We 
will 
draw, 
in 
this 
first 
position 
of 
the 
Earth, 
the 
greatest 
CD, 
and 
those 
two 
distant 
from 
it 
gr. 


23. 
and 
an 
half, 
EF 
above, 
and 
GM 
beneath, 
and 
the 
other 
two 
extream 
ones 
IK 
and 
LM 
remote, 
by 
those 
intervals 
from 
the 
Poles 
A 
and 
B; 
and 
as 
we 
have 
marked 
these 
five, 
so 
we 
may 
imagine 
innumerable 
others, 
parallel 
to 
these, 
described 
by 
the 
innumerable 
points 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
surface. 
Next 
let 
us 
suppose 
the 
Earth, 
with 
the 
annual 
motion 
of 
its 
centre, 
to 
transferre 
it 
self 
into 
the 
other 
places 
already 
marked; 
but 
to 
passe 
thither 
in 
such 
a 
manner, 
that 
its 
own 
Axis 
AB 
shall 
not 
only 
not 
change 
inclination 
upon 
the 
plain 
of 
the 
Ecliptick, 
but 
shall 
also 
never 
vary 
direction; 
so 
that 
alwayes 
keeping 
parallel 
to 
it 
self, 
it 
may 
continually 
tend 
towards 
the 
same 
part 
of 
the 
Universe, 
or, 
if 
you 
will, 
of 
the 
Firmament, 
whereas, 
if 
we 
do 
but 
suppose 
it 
prolonged, 
it 
will, 
with 
its 
extream 
termes, 
designe 
a 
Circle 
parallel 
and 
equal 
to 
the 
grand 
Orb, 
Libra 
Capricorn 
Aries 
Cancer, 
as 
the 
superiour 
base 
of 
a 
Cylinder 
described 
by 
it 
self 
in 
the 
annual 
motion 
above 
the 
inferiour 
base, 
Libra 
Capricorn 
Aries 
Cancer. 
And 
therefore 
this 
immutability 
of 
inclination 
continuing, 
we 
will 
design 
these 
other 
three 
figures 
about 
the 
centres 
Aries, 
Cancer, 
and 
Libra, 
alike 
in 
every 
thing 
to 
that 
first 
described 
about 
the 
centre 
Capricorn. 
Now 
we 
will 
consider 
the 
first 
figure 
of 
the 
Earth, 
in 
which, 
in 
regard 
the 
Axis 
AB 
is 
declined 
from 
perpendicularity 
upon 
the 
diameter 

Capricorn 
Cancer 
23 
degrees 
and 
an 
half 
towards 
the 
Sun 
O, 
and 
the 
arch 
AI 
being 
also 
23 
degrees 
and 
an 
half, 
the 
illumination 
of 
the 
Sun 
will 
illustrate 
the 
Hemisphere 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
exposed 
towards 
the 
Sun 
(of 
which, 
in 
this 
place, 
half 
is 
to 
be 
seen) 
divided 
from 
the 
obscure 
part 
by 
the 
Terminator 
of 
the 
light 
IM, 
by 
which 
the 
parallel 
CD, 
as 
being 
a 
grand 
circle, 
shall 
come 
to 
be 
divided 
into 
equal 
parts, 
but 
all 
the 
rest 
into 
parts 
unequal; 
being 
that 
the 
terminator 
of 
the 
light 
IM 
passeth 
not 
by 
their 
Poles 
AB, 
and 
the 
parallel 
IK, 
together 
with 
all 
the 
rest 
described 
within 
the 
same, 
and 
neerer 
to 
the 
pole 
A, 
shall 
wholly 
be 
included 
in 
the 
illuminated 
part; 
as 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
opposite 
ones 
towards 
the 
Pole 
B, 
contained 
within 
the 
parallel 
LM, 
shall 
remain 
in 
the 
dark. 
Moreover, 
the 
arch 
AI 
being 
equal 
to 
the 
arch 
FD, 
and 
the 
arch 
AF, 
common 
to 
them 
both, 
the 
two 
arches 
IKF 
and 
AFD 
shall 
be 
equal, 
and 
each 
a 
quadrant 
or 
90 
degrees. 
And 
because 
the 
whole 
arch 
IFM 
is 
a 
semicircle, 
the 
arch 
FM 
shall 
be 
a 
quadrant, 
and 
equal 
to 
the 
other 
FKI; 
and 
therefore 
the 
Sun 
O 
shall 
be 
in 
this 
state 
of 
the 
Earth 
vertical 
to 
one 
that 
stands 
in 
the 
point 
F. 
But 
by 
the 
revolution 
diurnal 
about 
the 
standing 
Axis 
AB, 
all 
the 
points 
of 
the 
parallel 
EF 
passe 
by 
the 
same 
point 
F: 
and 
therefore 
in 
that 
same 
day 
the 
Sun, 
at 
noon, 
shall 
be 
vertical 
to 
all 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
Parallel 
EF, 
and 
will 
seem 
to 
them 
to 
describe 
in 
its 
apparent 
motion 
the 
circle 
which 
we 
call 
the 
Tropick 
of 
Cancer. 
But 
to 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
all 
the 
Parallels 
that 
are 
above 
the 
parallel 
EF, 
towards 
the 
North 
pole 
A, 
the 
Sun 
declineth 
from 
their 
Vertex 
or 
Zenith 
towards 
the 
South; 
and 
on 
the 
contrary, 
to 
all 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
Parallels 
that 
are 
beneath 
EF, 
towards 
the 
Equinoctial 
CD, 
and 
the 
South 
Pole 
B, 
the 
Meridian 
Sun 
is 
elevated 
beyond 
their 
Vertex 
towards 
the 
North 
Pole 
A. 
Next, 
it 
is 
visible 
that 
of 
all 
the 
Parallels, 
only 
the 
greatest 
CD 
is 
cut 
in 
equal 
parts 
by 
the 
Terminator 
of 
the 
light 
IM. 
But 
the 
rest, 
that 
are 
beneath 
and 
above 
the 
said 
grand 
circle, 
are 
all 
intersected 
in 
parts 
unequal: 
and 
of 
the 
superiour 
ones, 
the 
semidiurnal 
arches, 
namely 
those 
of 
the 
part 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
surface, 
illustrated 
by 
the 
Sun, 
are 
bigger 
than 
the 
seminocturnal 
ones 
that 
remain 
in 
the 
dark: 
and 
the 
contrary 
befalls 
in 
the 
remainder, 
that 
are 
under 
the 
great 
one 
CD, 
towards 
the 
pole 
B, 
of 
which 
the 
semidiurnal 
arches 
are 
lesser 
than 
the 
seminocturnal, 
It 
is 
likewise 
apparently 
manifest, 
that 
the 
differences 
of 
the 
said 
arches 
go 
augmenting, 
according 
as 
the 
Parallels 
are 
neerer 
to 
the 
Poles, 
till 
such 
time 
as 
the 
parallel 
IK 
comes 
to 
be 
wholly 
in 
the 
part 
illuminated, 
and 
the 
inhabitants 
thereof 
have 
a 
day 
of 
twenty 
four 
hours 
long, 
without 
any 
night; 
and 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
Parallel 
LM, 
remaining 
all 



in 
obscurity, 
hath 
a 
night 
of 
twenty 
four 
hours, 
without 
any 
day. 
Come 
we 
next 
to 
the 
third 
Figure 
of 
the 
Earth, 
placed 
with 
its 
centre 
in 
the 
point 
Cancer, 
where 
the 
Sun 
seemeth 
to 
be 
in 
the 
first 
point 
of 
Capricorn. 
We 
have 
already 
seen 
very 
manifestly, 
that 
by 
reason 
the 
Axis 
AB 
doth 
not 
change 
inclination, 
but 
continueth 
parallel 
to 
it 
self, 
the 
aspect 
and 
situation 
of 
the 
Earth 
is 
the 
same 
to 
an 
hair 
with 
that 
in 
the 
first 
Figure; 
save 
onely 
that 
that 
Hemisphere 
which 
in 
the 
first 
was 
illuminated 
by 
the 
Sun, 
in 
this 
remaineth 
obtenebrated, 
and 
that 
cometh 
to 
be 
luminous, 
which 
in 
the 
first 
was 
tenebrous: 
whereupon 
that 
which 
happened 
before 
concerning 
the 
differences 
of 
dayes 
and 
nights, 
touching 
the 
dayes 
being 
greater 
or 
lesser 
than 
the 
nights,nowfalls 
outquite 
contrary. 
And 
first,we 
see, 
that 
whereasin 
thefirst 
Figure 
the 
circle 
IK 
was 
wholly 
in 
the 
light, 
it 
is 
now 
wholly 
in 
the 
dark; 
and 
the 
opposite 
arch 
LM 
is 
now 
wholly 
in 
the 
light, 
which 
was 
before 
wholly 
in 
the 
dark. 
Of 
the 
parallels 
between 
the 
grand 
circle 
CD, 
and 
the 
Pole 
A, 
the 
semidiurnal 
arches 
are 
now 
lesser 
than 
the 
seminocturnal, 
which 
before 
were 
the 
contrary. 
Of 
the 
others 
likewise 
towards 
the 
Pole 
B, 
the 
semidiurnal 
arches 
are 
now 
bigger 
than 
the 
seminocturnal, 
the 
contrary 
to 
what 
happened 
in 
the 
other 
position 
of 
the 
Earth. 
We 
now 
see 
the 
Sun 
made 
vertical 
to 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
Tropick 
GN, 
and 
to 
be 
depressed 
towards 
the 
South, 
with 
those 
of 
the 
Parallel 
EF, 
by 
all 
the 
arch 
ECG, 
that 
is, 
47 
degrees; 
and 
in 
summe, 
to 
have 
passed 
from 
one 
to 
the 
other 
Tropick, 
traversing 
the 
Equinoctial, 
elevating 
and 
declining 
in 
the 
Meridians 
the 
said 
space 
of 
47 
degrees. 
And 
all 
this 
mutation 
is 
derived 
not 
from 
the 
inclination 
or 
elevation 
of 
the 
Earth, 
but 
on 
the 
contrary, 
from 
its 
not 
inclining 
or 
elevating 
at 
all; 
and 
in 
a 
word, 
by 
continuing 
always 
in 
the 
same 
position, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
Universe, 
onely 
with 
turning 
about 
the 
Sun 
situate 
iu 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
said 
plane, 
in 
which 
it 
moveth 
it 
self 
about 
circularly 
with 
its 
annual 
motion. 
And 
here 
is 
to 
be 
noted 
an 
admirable 
accident, 
An 
admirable 
accident 
depending 
on 
the 
not 
inclining 
of 
the 
Earths 
axis 
which 
is, 
that 
like 
as 
the 
Axis 
of 
the 
Earth 
conserving 
the 
same 
direction 
towards 
the 
Universe, 
or 
we 
may 
say, 
towards 
the 
highest 
Sphere 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
causeth 
the 
Sun 
to 
appear 
to 
elevate 
and 
incline 
so 
great 
a 
space, 
namely, 
for 
47 
degrees, 
and 
the 
fixed 
Stars 
to 
incline 
or 
elevate 
nothing 
at 
all; 
so, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
if 
the 
same 
Axis 
of 
the 
Earth 
should 
maintain 
it 
self 
continually 
in 
the 
same 
inclination 
towards 
the 
Sun, 
or, 
if 
you 
will, 
towards 
the 
Axis 
of 
the 
Zodiack, 
no 
mutation 
would 
appear 
to 
be 
made 
in 
the 
Sun 
about 
its 
elevating 
or 
declining, 



whereupon 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
one 
and 
the 
same 
place 
would 
alwayes 
have 
one 
and 
the 
same 
difference 
of 
dayes 
and 
nights, 
and 
one 
and 
the 
same 
constitution 
of 
Seasons, 
that 
is, 
some 
alwayes 
Winter, 
others 
alwayes 
Summer, 
others 
Spring, 
&c. 
but, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
alterations 
in 
the 
fixed 
Stars 
would 
appear 
very 
great, 
as 
touching 
their 
elevation, 
and 
inclination 
to 
us, 
which 
would 
amount 
to 
the 
same 
47 
degrees. 
For 
the 
understanding 
of 
which 
let 
us 
return 
to 
consider 
the 
position 
of 
the 
Earth, 
in 
its 
first 
Figure, 
where 
we 
see 
the 
Axis 
AB, 
with 
the 
superiour 
Pole 
A, 
to 
incline 
towards 
the 
Sun; 
but 
in 
its 
third 
Figure, 
the 
same 
Axis 
having 
kept 
the 
same 
direction 
towards 
the 
highest 
Sphere, 
by 
keeping 
parallel 
to 
it 
self, 
inclines 
no 
longer 
towards 
the 
Sun 
with 
its 
superiour 
Pole 
A, 
but 
on 
the 
contrary 
reclines 
from 
its 
former 
position 
gr. 
47. 
and 
inclineth 
towards 
the 
opposite 
part, 
so 
that 
to 
restore 
the 
same 
inclination 
of 
the 
said 
Pole 
A 
towards 
the 
Sun, 
it 
would 
be 
requisite 
by 
turning 
round 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe, 
according 
to 
the 
circumference 
ACBD, 
to 
transport 
it 
towards 
E 
those 
same 
gr. 
47. 
and 
for 
so 
many 
degrees, 
any 
whatsoever 
fixed 
star 
observed 
in 
the 
Meridian, 
would 
appear 
to 
be 
elevated, 
or 
inclined. 
Let 
us 
come 
now 
to 
the 
explanation 
of 
that 
which 
remains, 
and 
let 
us 
consider 
the 
Earth 
placed 
in 
the 
fourth 
Figure, 
that 
is, 
with 
its 
centre 
in 
the 
first 
point 
of 
Libra; 
upon 
which 
the 
Sun 
will 
appear 
inthebeginningof 
Aries. 
AndbecausetheAxisof 


[figure] 


the 
Earth, 
which 
in 
the 
first 
Figure 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
inclined 
upon 
the 
diameter 
Capricorn 
Cancer, 
and 
therefore 
to 
be 
in 
that 
same 
plane, 
which 
cutting 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
grand 
Orb, 
according 
to 
the 
line 
Capricorn 
Cancer, 
was 
erected 
perpendicularly 
upon 
the 
same, 
transposed 
into 
the 
fourth 
Figure, 
and 
maintained, 
as 
hath 
alwayes 
been 
said, 
parallel 
to 
it 
self, 
it 
shall 
come 
to 
be 
in 
a 
plane 
in 
like 
manner 
erected 
to 
the 
superficies 
of 
the 
Grand 
Orbe, 
and 
parallel 
to 
the 
plane, 
which 
at 
right 
angles 
cuts 
the 
same 
superficies, 
according 
to 
the 
diameter 
Capricorn 
Cancer. 
And 
therefore 
the 
line 
which 
goeth 
from 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Sunne 
to 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
that 
is, 
O 
Libra, 
shall 
be 
perpendicular 
to 
the 
Axis 
BA: 
but 
the 
same 
line 
which 
goeth 
from 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Sunne 
to 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
is 
also 
alwayes 
perpendicular 
to 
the 
circle 
that 
is 
the 
Terminator 
of 
the 
light; 
therefore 
this 
same 
circle 
shall 
passe 
by 
the 
Poles 
AB 
in 
the 
fourth 
figure, 
and 
in 
its 
plain 



the 
Axis 
AB 
shall 
fall, 
but 
the 
greatest 
circle 
passing 
by 
the 
Poles 
of 
the 
Parallels, 
divideth 
them 
all 
in 
equal 
parts; 
therefore 
the 
arches 
IK, 
EF, 
CD, 
GN, 
LM, 
shall 
be 
all 
semicircles, 
and 
the 
illumin’d 
Hemisphere 
shall 
be 
this 
which 
looketh 
towards 
us, 
and 
the 
Sun, 
and 
the 
Terminator 
of 
the 
light 
shall 
be 
one 
and 
the 
same 
circle 
ACBD, 
and 
the 
Earth 
being 
in 
this 
place 
shall 
make 
it 
Equinoctial 
to 
all 
its 
Inhabitants. 
And 
the 
same 
happeneth 
in 
the 
secondfigure,where 
the 
Earthhaving 
itsilluminatedHemispheretowardsthe 
Sun, 
sheweth 
us 
the 
other 
that 
is 
obscure, 
with 
its 
nocturnal 
arches, 
which 
in 
like 
manner 
are 
all 
semicircles, 
and 
consequently, 
here 
also 
it 
maketh 
the 
Equinoctial. 
And 
lastly 
in 
regard 
that 
the 
line 
produced 
from 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Sun 
to 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
is 
perpendicular 
to 
the 
Axis 
AB, 
to 
which 
the 
greatestcircleof 
the

likewiseerect,thesaid 
lineO 
Librashall 
passe 
of 
necessity 
by 
the

cutting 
its

CD;and 
thereforetheSunshall 
be 
vertical 
to 
any 
one 
that 
shall 
stand 
where 
that 
intersection 
is 
made; 
but 
all 
the 
Inhabitants 
of 
that 
Parallel 
shall 
passe 
the 
same, 
as 
being 
carried 
about 
by 
the 
Earths 
diurnal 
conversion; 
therefore 
all 
thes 
upon 
that 
day 
shall 
have 
the 
Meridian 
Sun 
in 
their 
vertex. 
And 
the 
Sun 
at 
the 
same 
time 
to 
all 
the 
Inhabitants 
of 
the 
Earth 
shall 
seem 
to 
describe 
the 
Grand 
Parallel 
called 
the 
Equinoctial. 
Furthermore, 
forasmuch 
as 
the 
Earth 
being 
in 
both 
the 
Solstitial 
points 
of 
the 
Polar 
circles 
IK 
and 
LM, 
the 
one 
is 
wholly 
in 
the 
light, 
and 
the 
other 
wholly 
in 
the 
dark; 
but 
when 
the 
Earth 
is 
in 
the 
Equinoctial 
points, 
the 
halves 
of 
those 
same 
polar 
circles 
are 
in 
the 
light, 
the 
remainder 
of 
them 
being 
in 
the 
dark; 
it 
should 
not 
be 
hard 
to 
understand, 
how 
that 
the 
Earth 
v. 
gr. 
from 
Cancer 
(where 
the 
parallel 
IK 
is 
wholly 
in 
the 
dark) 
to 
Leo, 
one 
part 
of 
the 
parallel 
towards 
the 
point 
I, 
beginneth 
to 
enter 
into 
the 
light, 
and 
that 
the 
Terminator 
of 
the 
light 
IM 
beginneth 
to 
retreat 
towards 
the 
Pole 
AB, 
intersecting 
the 
circle 
ACBD 
no 
longer 
in 
IM, 
but 
in 
two 
other 
points 
falling 
between 
the 
terms 
IA 
and 
MB, 
of 
the 
arches 
IA 
and 
MB; 
whereupon 
the 
Inhabitants 
of 
the 
circle 
begin 
to 
enjoy 
the 
light, 
and 
the 
other 
Inhabitants 
of 
the 
circle 
LM 
to 
partake 
of 
night. 
And 
thus 
you 
see 
that 
by 
two 
simple 
motions 
made 
in 
times 
proportionate 
to 
their 
bignesses, 
and 
not 
contrary 
to 
one 
another, 
but 
performed, 
as 
all 
others 
that 
belong 
to 
moveable 
mundane 
bodies, 
from 
West 
to 
East 
assigned 
to 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe, 
adequate 
reasons 
are 
rendred 
of 
all 
those 
Phaenomena 
or 
appearances, 
for 
the 
accommodating 
of 
which 
to 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
Earth 
it 
is 
necessary 
(forsaking 
that 
Symetry 
which 
is 
observed 
to 
be 
between 
the 
velocities 
and 
magnitudes 
of 
moveables) 



to 
ascribe 
to 
a 
Sphere, 
vast 
above 
all 
others, 
an 
unconceiveable 
celerity, 
whilst 
the 
other 
lesser 
Spheres 
move 
extream 
slowly; 
and 
which 
is 
more, 
to 
make 
that 
motion 
contrary 
to 
all 
their 
motions; 
and, 
yet 
again 
to 
adde 
to 
the 
improbability, 
to 
make 
that 
superiour 
Sphere 
forcibly 
to 
transport 
all 
the 
inferiour 
ones 
along 
with 
it 
contrary 
to 
their 
proper 
inclination. 
And 
here 
I 
referit

SAGR. 


To 
me, 
as 
far 
as 
concerneth 
sense, 
there 
appeareth 
no 
small 
difference 
betwixt 
the 
simplicity 
and 
facility 
of 
operating 
effects 
by 
the 
means 
assigned 
in 
this 
new 
constitution, 
and 
the 
multiplicity, 
confusion, 
and 
difficulty, 
that 
is 
found 
in 
the 
ancient 
and 
commonly 
received 
Hypothesis. 
For 
if 
the 
Universe 
were 
disposed 
according 
to 
this 
multiplicity, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
renounce 
many 
Maximes 
in 
Philosophy 
commonly 
received 
by 
Philosophers, 
Axiomes 
commonly 
admitted 
by 
all 
Philosophers. 
as 
for 
instance, 
That 
Nature 
doth 
not 
multiply 
things 
without 
necessity; 
and, 
That 
She 
makes 
use 
of 
the 
most 
facile 
and 
simple 
means 
in 
producing 
her 
effects; 
and, 
That 
She 
doth 
nothing 
in 
vain, 
and 
the 
like. 
I 
do 
confesse 
that 
I 
never 
heard 
any 
thing 
more 
admirable 
than 
this, 
nor 
can 
I 
believe 
that 
Humane 
Understanding 
ever 
penetrated 
a 
more 
sublime 
speculation. 
I 
know 
not 
what 
Simplicius 
may 
thinkofit. 


SIMP. 


These 
(if 
I 
may 
speak 
my 
judgment 
freely) 
do 
seem 
to 
me 
some 
of 
those 
Geometrical 
subtilties 
which 
Aristotle 
finds 
fault 
with 
in 
Plato, 
Aristotle 
taxeth 
Plato 
for 
being 
too 
studious 
of 
Geometry. 
when 
he 
accuseth 
him 
that 
by 
his 
too 
much 
studying 
of 
Geometry 
he 
forsook 
solid 
Philosophy; 
and 
I 
have 
known 
and 
heard 
very 
great 
Peripatetick 
Philosophers 
to 
disswade 
their 
Scholars 
from 
the 
Study 
of 
the 
Mathematicks, 
as 
those 
that 
render 
the 
wit 
cavilous, 
and 
unable 
to 
philosophate 
well; 
an 
Institute 
diametrically 
contrary 
to 
that 
of 
Plato, 
who 
admitted 
one 
to 
Philosophy, 
unlesse 
he 
was 
first 
well 
enteredinGeometry. 


SALV. 



I 
commend 
the 
policy 
of 
these 
your 
Peripateticks, 
Peripatetick 
Philosophers 
condemn 
the 
Study 
of 
Geometry, 
and 
why. 
in 
dehorting 
their 
Disciples 
from 
the 
Study 
of 
Geometry, 
for 
that 
there 
is 
not 
art 
more 
commodious 
for 
detecting 
their 
fallacies; 
but 
see 
how 
they 
differ 
from 
the 
Mathematical 
Philosophers, 
who 
much 
more 
willingly 
converse 
with 
those 
that 
are 
well 
verst 
in 
the 
commune 
Peripatetick 
Philosophy, 
than 
with 
those 
that 
are 
destitute 
of 
that 
knowledg, 
who 
for 
want 
thereof 
cannot 
distinguish 
between 
doctrine 
and 
doctrine. 
But 
passing 
by 
this, 
tell 
me 
I 
beseech 
you, 
what 
are 
those 
extravagancies 
and 
those 
too 
affected 
subtilties 
that 
make 
you 
think 
this 
CopernicanSystemethe 
lesseplausible? 


SIMP. 


To 
tell 
you 
true, 
I 
do 
not 
very 
well 
know; 
perhaps, 
because 
I 
have 
not 
so 
much 
as 
learnt 
the 
reasons 
that 
are 
by 
Ptolomy 
produced, 
of 
those 
effects, 
I 
mean 
of 
those 
stations, 
retrogradations, 
accessions, 
recessions 
of 
the 
Planets; 
lengthenings 
and 
shortnings 
of 
dayes, 
changes 
of 
seasons, 
&c. 
But 
omitting 
the 
consequences 
that 
depend 
on 
the 
first 
suppositions, 
I 
find 
in 
the 
suppositions 
themselves 
no 
small 
difficulties; 
which 
suppositions, 
if 
once 
they 
be 
overthrown, 
they 
draw 
along 
with 
them 
the 
ruine 
of 
the 
whole 
fabrick. 
Now 
forasmuch 
as 
because 
the 
whole 
module 
of 
Copernicus 
seemeth 
in 
my 
opinion 
to 
be 
built 
upon 
infirm 
foundations, 
in 
that 
it 
relyeth 
upon 
the 
mobility 
oftheearth,if 
thisshouldhappentobe 
disproved,therewould 
beno 
need 
of 
farther 
dispute. 
And 
to 
disprove 
this, 
the 
Axiom 
of 
Aristotle 
is 
in 
my 
judgement 
most 
sufficient, 
That 
of 
one 
simple 
body, 
one 
sole 
simple 
motion 
can 
be 
natural: 
but 
here 
in 
this 
case, 
to 
the 
Earth, 
Four 
several 
motions 
assigned 
to 
the 
Earth. 
a 
simple 
body, 
there 
are 
assigned 
3. 
if 
not 
4. 
motions, 
and 
all 
very 
different 
from 
each 
other. 
For 
besides 
the 
right 
motion, 
as 
a 
grave 
body 
towards 
its 
centre, 
which 
cannot 
be 
denied 
it, 
there 
is 
assigned 
to 
it 
a 
circular 
motion 
in 
a 
great 
circle 
about 
the 
Sun 
in 
a 
year, 
and 
a 
vertiginous 
conversion 
about 
its 
own 
centre 
in 
twenty 
four 
hours. 
And 
that 
in 
the 
next 
place 
which 
is 
more 
exorbitant, 
& 
which 
happly 
for 
that 
reason 
you 
pass 
over 
in 
silence, 
there 
is 
ascribed 
to 
it 
another 
revolution 
about 
its 
own 
centre, 
contrary 
to 
the 
former 
of 
twenty 
four 
hours, 
and 
which 
finisheth 
its 
period 
in 
a 
year. 
In 
thismyunderstanding 
apprehendetha 
verygreatcontradiction. 


SALV. 



As 
to 
the 
motion 
of 
descent, 
The 
motion 
of 
descent 
belongs 
not 
to 
the 
terrestrial 
Globe, 
but 
to 
its 
parts. 
it 
hath 
already 
been 
concluded 
not 
to 
belong 
to 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
which 
did 
never 
move 
with 
any 
such 
motion, 
nor 
never 
shall 
do; 
but 
is 
(if 
there 
be 
such 
a 
thing) 
that 
propension 
of 
its 
parts 
to 
reunite 
themselves 
to 
their 
whole. 
As, 
in 
the 
next 
place, 
to 
the 
Annual 
motion, 
and 
the 
Diurnal, 
The 
annual 
and 
diurnal 
motion 
are 
compatible 
in 
the 
Earth. 
these 
being 
both 
made 
towards 
one 
way, 
are 
very 
compatible, 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
just 
as 
if 
we 
should 
let 
a 
Ball 
trundle 
downwards 
upon 
a 
declining 
superficies, 
it 
would 
in 
its 
descent 
along 
the 
same 
spontaneously 
revolve 
in 
it 
self. 
As 
to 
the 
third 
motion 
assigned 
it 
by 
Copernicus, 
namely 
aboutitselfin 
ayear,onelytokeep 
its 
Axisinclinedand 
directed 
towards 
the 
same 
part 
of 
the 
Firmament, 
I 
will 
tell 
you 
a 
thing 
worthy 
of 
great 
consideration: 
namely 
ut 
tantum 
abest 
(although 
it 
be 
made 
contrary 
to 
the 
other 
annual) 
it 
is 
so 
far 
from 
having 
any 
repugnance 
or 
difficulty 
in 
it, 
Every 
pensil 
and 
librated, 
body 
carryed 
round 
in 
the 
circumference 
of 
a 
circle, 
acquireth 
of 
it 
self 
a 
motion 
in 
it 
self 
contrary 
to 
that. 
that 
naturally 
and 
without 
any 
moving 
cause, 
it 
agreeth 
to 
any 
whatsoever 
suspended 
and 
librated 
body, 
which 
if 
it 
shall 
be 
carried 
round 
in 
the 
circumference 
of 
a 
circle, 
immediate 
of 
it 
self, 
it 
acquireth 
a 
conversion 
about 
its 
own 
centre, 
contrary 
to 
that 
which 
carrieth 
it 
about, 
and 
of 
such 
velocity, 
that 
they 
both 
finish 
one 
revolution 
in 
the 
same 
time 
precisely. 
You 
may 
see 
this 
admirable, 
and 
to 
our 
purpose 
accommodate 
experience, 
An 
Experiment 
which 
sensibly 
shews 
that 
two 
contrary 
motions 
may 
naturally 
agree 
in 
the 
same 
moveable. 
if 
putting 
in 
a 
Bason 
of 
water 
a 
Ball 
that 
will 
swim; 
and 
holding 
the 
Bason 
in 
your 
hand, 
you 
turn 
round 
upon 
your 
toe, 
for 
you 
shall 
immediatly 
see 
the 
Ball 
begin 
to 
revolve 
in 
it 
self 
with 
a 
motion, 
contrary 
to 
that 
of 
the 
Bason, 
and 
it 
shall 
finish 
its 
revolution, 
when 
that 
of 
the 
Bason 
it 
shall 
finish. 
Now 
what 
other 
is 
the 
Earth 
than 
a 
pensil 
Globe 
librated 
in 
tenuous 
and 
yielding 
aire, 
which 
being 
carried 
about 
in 
a 
year 
along 
the 
circumference 
of 
a 
great 
circle, 
The 
third 
motion 
ascribed 
to 
the 
Earth 
is 
rather 
a 
resting 
immoveable. 
must 
needs 
acquire, 
without 
any 
other 
mover, 
a 
revolution 
about 
its 
own 
centre, 
annual, 
and 
yet 
contrary 
to 
the 
other 
motion 
in 
like 
manner 
annual? 
You 
shall 
see 
this 
effect 
I 
say, 
but 
if 
afterwards 
you 
more 
narrowly 
consider 
it, 
you 
shall 
find 
this 
to 
be

a

appearance; 
and 
that 
which 
you 
think 
to 
be 
a 
revolution 
in 
it 
self, 
you 
will 
find 
to 
be 
a 
not 
moving

a 
continuing

immoveable 
in

without

without

but 
comparing 
it 
to 
the 
vessel 
and 
to 
your 
self 
that 
are 
moveable, 
it 
will 
appear 
to 
go 
altering 
its 
direction, 
and 
with 
a 
motion 
contrary 
to 
yours, 
and 
that 
of 
the 
vessel, 
to 
go 
seeking 
all 
the 
points 
of 
its 
circumgyration; 
so 
that 
with 
more 
reason 
you 
and 
the 
bason 
may 
be 
said 
to 
turn 
round 
the 
immoveable 
Ball, 
than 
that 
it 
moveth 
round 
in 
the 
bason. 
In 
the 
same 
manner 
the 
Earth 
suspended 
and 
librated 
in 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
Grand 
Orbe, 
and 
scituate 
in 
such 
sort 
that 
one 
of 
its 
notes, 
as 
for 
example, 
its 
North 
Pole, 
looketh 
towards 
such 
a 
Star 
or 
other 
part 
of 
the 
Firmament, 
it 
always 
keepeth 
directed 
towards 
the 
same, 
although 
carried 
round 
by 
the 
annual 
motion 
about 
thecircumference 
of 
the 
said 
Grand 
Orbe. 
This 
alone 
is 
sufficient 
to 
make

what 
will 
Simplicius 
say, 
if 
to

the

Answer 
me 
then 
to 
the 
questions 
that 
I 
shall 
ask 
you. 
And 
first 
of 
all, 
Tell 
me 
whether 
you 
believe, 
that 
this 
our 
Globe, 
which 
we 
inhabit 
and 
call 
Earth, 
consisteth 
of 
one 
sole 
and 
simple 
matter, 
or 
else 
that 
it 
is 
an 
aggregate 
of 
mattersdifferentfromeach 
other. 


SIMP. 


I 
see 
it 
to 
be 
composed 
of 
substances 
and 
bodies 
very 
different; 
The 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
composed 
of 
sundry 
matters. 
and 
first, 
for 
the 
greatest 
parts 
of 
the 
composition, 
I 
see 
the 
Water 
and 
the 
Earth, 
which 
extreamly 
differ 
fromoneanother. 


SALV. 


Let 
us, 
for 
this 
once, 
lay 
aside 
the 
Seas 
and 
other 
Waters, 
and 
let 
us 
consider 
the 
solid 
parts, 
and 
tell 
me, 
if 
you 
think 
them 
one 
and 
the 
same 
thing, 
or 
else 
different. 


SIMP. 


As 
to 
appearance, 
I 
see 
that 
they 
are 
different 
things, 
there 
being 
very 
great 
heapsof 
unfruitful 
sands, 
and 
others 
of 
fruitfulsoiles;Thereare 
infinite 
sharp 
and 
steril 
mountains, 
full 
of 
hard 
stones 
and 
quarries 
of 
several 
kinds, 
as 
Porphyre, 
Alablaster, 
Jasper, 
and 
a 
thousand 
other 
kinds 
of 
Marbles: 
There 
are 
vast 
Minerals 
of 
so 
many 
kinds 
of 
metals; 
and 
in 
a 
word, 
such 
varieties 
of 
matters,thatawholedaywouldnotsuffice 
onlytoenumeratethem. 


SALV. 



Now 
of 
all 
these 
different 
matters, 
do 
you 
think, 
that 
in 
the 
composition 
of 
this 
grand 
masse,theredo 
concurportions,orelsethatamongstthemallthere 
is 
one 
part 
that 
far 
exceeds 
the 
rest, 
and 
is 
as 
it 
were 
the 
matter 
and 
substance 
oftheimmense 
lump? 


SIMP. 


I 
believe 
that 
the 
Stones, 
Marbles, 
Metals, 
Gems, 
and 
the 
so 
many 
other 
several 
matters 
are 
as 
it 
were 
Jewels, 
and 
exteriour 
and 
superficial 
Ornaments 
of 
the 
primary 
Globe, 
which 
in 
grosse, 
as 
I 
believe, 
doth 
without 
compare 
exceedallthesethingsputtogether. 


SALV. 


And 
this 
principal 
and 
vast 
masse, 
of 
which 
those 
things 
above 
named 
are 
as 
it 
were 
excressences 
and 
ornaments, 
of 
what 
matter 
do 
you 
think 
that 
it 
is 
composed? 


SIMP. 


Ithinkthatitis 
the 
simple,orlesse 
impureelementofEarth. 


SALV. 


But 
what 
do 
you 
understand 
by 
Earth? 
Is 
it 
haply 
that 
which 
is 
dispersed 
all 
over 
the 
fields, 
which 
is 
broke 
up 
with 
Mattocks 
and 
Ploughs, 
wherein 
we 
sowe 
corne, 
and 
plant 
fruits, 
and 
in 
which 
great 
boscages 
grow 
up, 
without 
the 
help 
of 
culture, 
and 
which 
is, 
in 
a 
word, 
the 
habitation 
of 
all 
animals, 
and 
thewomb 
ofallvegetables? 


SIMP. 


Tisthis 
thatIwould 
affirmtobe 
thesubstance 
ofthis 
ourGlobe. 


SALV. 


But 
in 
this 
you 
do, 
in 
my 
judgment, 
affirm 
that 
which 
is 
not 
right: 
for 
this 
Earth 
which 
is 
broke 
up, 
is 
sowed, 
and 
is 
fertile, 
is 
but 
one 
part, 
and 
that 
very 
small 
of 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
Globe, 
which 
doth 
not 
go 
very 
deep, 
yea, 
its 
depth 



is 
very 
small, 
in 
comparison 
of 
the 
distance 
to 
the 
centre: 
and 
experience 
sheweth 
us, 
that 
one 
shall 
not 
dig 
very 
low, 
but 
one 
shall 
finde 
matters 
very 
different 
from 
this 
exteriour 
scurf, 
more 
solid, 
and 
not 
good 
for 
the 
production 
of 
vegetables. 
Besides 
the 
interne 
parts, 
as 
being 
compressed 
by 
very 
huge 
weights 
that 
lie 
upon 
them, 
are, 
in 
all 
probability, 
slived, 
and 
made 
as 
hard 
as 
any 
hard 
rock. 
One 
may 
adde 
to 
this, 
that 
fecundity 
would 
be 
in 
vain 
conferred 
upon 
those 
matters 
which 
never 
were 
designed 
to 
bear 
fruit, 
buttoresteternallyburied 
intheprofoundanddark 
abysses 
oftheEarth. 


SIMP. 


But 
who 
shall 
assure 
us, 
that 
the 
parts 
more 
inward 
and 
near 
to 
the 
centre 
are 
unfruitful? 
They 
also 
may, 
perhaps, 
have 
their 
productions 
of 
things 
unknowntous? 


SALV. 


You 
may 
aswell 
be 
assured 
thereof, 
as 
any 
man 
else, 
as 
being 
very 
capable 
to 
comprehend, 
that 
if 
the 
integral 
bodies 
of 
the 
Universe 
be 
produced 
onely 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
Mankind, 
this 
above 
all 
the 
rest 
ought 
to 
be 
destin’d 
to 
the 
sole 
conveniences 
of 
us 
its 
inhabitants. 
But 
what 
benefit 
can 
we 
draw 
from 
matters 
so 
hid 
and 
remote 
from 
us, 
as 
that 
we 
shall 
never 
be 
able 
to 
make 
use 
of 
them?The 
interne 
parts 
of 
the 
terrestrial 
Globe 
must 
of 
necessity 
be 
solid. 
Therefore 
the 
interne 
substance 
of 
this 
our 
Globe 
cannot 
be 
a 
matter 
frangible, 
dissipable, 
and 
non-coherent, 
like 
this 
superficial 
part 
which 
we 
callOr 
MOULD. 
EARTH: 
but 
it 
must, 
of 
necessity, 
be 
a 
most 
dense 
and 
solid 
body, 
and 
in 
a 
word, 
a 
most 
hard 
stone. 
And, 
if 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
so, 
what 
reason 
is 
there 
that 
should 
make 
you 
more 
scrupulous 
to 
believe 
that 
it 
is 
a 
Loadstone 
than 
a 
Porphiry, 
a 
Jasper, 
or 
other 
hard 
Marble? 
Happily 
if 
Gilbert 
had 
written, 
that 
this 
Globe 
is 
all 
compounded

SIMP. 


That 
the 
parts 
of 
this

more 
intern 
are 
more 
compressed, 
and 
so 
more 
slived 
together 
and 
solid, 
and 
more 
and 
more 
so, 
according 
as 
they 
lie 
lower, 
I 
do 
grant, 
and 
so 
likewise 
doth 
Aristotle, 
but 
that 
they 
degenerate 
and 



become 
other 
than 
Earth, 
of 
the 
same 
sort 
with 
this 
of 
the 
superficial 
parts, 
I 
seenothingthatobliegeth

tobelieve. 


SALV. 


I 
undertook 
not 
this 
discourse 
with 
an 
intent 
to 
prove 
demonstratively 
that 
the 
primary 
and 
real 
substance 
of 
this 
our 
Globe 
is 
Load-stone; 
but 
onely 
to 
shew 
that 
no 
reason 
could 
be 
given 
why 
one 
should 
be 
more 
unwilling 
to 
grant 
that 
it 
is 
of 
Load-stone, 
Our 
Globe 
would 
have 
been 
called 
stone, 
in 
stead 
of 
Earth, 
of 
that 
name 
had 
been 
giuen 
it 
in 
the 
beginning. 
than 
of 
some 
other 
matter. 
And 
if 
you 
will 
but 
seriously 
consider, 
you 
shall 
find 
that 
it 
is 
not 
improbable, 
that 
one 
sole, 
pure, 
and 
arbitrary 
name, 
hath 
moved 
men 
to 
think 
that 
it 
consists 
of 
Earth; 
and 
that 
is 
their 
having 
made 
use 
commonly 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
this 
word 
Earth, 
as 
well 
to 
signifie 
that 
matter 
which 
is 
plowed 
and 
sowed, 
as 
to 
name 
this 
our 
Globe. 
The 
denomination 
of 
which 
if 
it 
had 
been 
taken 
from 
stone, 
as 
that 
it 
might 
as 
well 
have 
been 
taken 
from 
that 
as 
from 
the 
Earth; 
the 
saying 
that 
its 
primary 
substance 
was 
stone, 
would 
doubtlesse 
have 
found 
no 
scruple 
or 
opposition 
in 
any 
man. 
And 
is 
so 
much 
the 
more 
probable, 
in 
that 
I 
verily 
believe, 
that 
if 
one 
could 
but 
pare 
off 
the 
scurf 
of 
this 
great 
Globe, 
taking 
away 
but 
one 
full 
thousand 
or 
two 
thousand 
yards; 
and 
afterwards 
seperate 
the 
Stones 
from 
the 
Earth, 
the 
accumulation 
of 
the 
stones 
would 
be 
very 
much 
biger 
than 
that 
of 
the 
fertile 
Mould. 
But 
as 
for 
the 
reasons 
which 
concludently 
prove 
de 
facto, 
that 
is 
our 
Globe 
is 
a 
Magnet, 
I 
have 
mentioned 
none 
of 
them, 
nor 
is 
this 
a 
time 
to 
alledg 
them, 
and 
the 
rather, 
for 
that 
to 
your 
benefit 
you 
may 
read 
them 
in 
Gilbert; 
onely 
to 
encourage 
you 
to 
the 
perusal 
of 
them, 
I 
will 
set 
before 
you, 
in 
a 
similitude 
of 
my 
own, 
The 
method 
of 
Gilbert 
in 
his 
Philosophy. 
the 
method 
that 
he 
observed 
in 
his 
Philosophy. 
I 
know 
you 
understand 
very 
well 
how 
much 
the 
knowledg 
of 
the 
accidents 
is 
subservient 
to 
the 
investigation 
of 
the 
substance 
and 
essence 
of 
things; 
therefore 
I 
desire 
that 
you 
would 
take 
pains 
to 
informe 
your 
self 
well 
of 
many 
accidents 
and 
properties 
that 
are 
found 
in 
the 
Magnet, 
Manyproperties

andinno 
other

forinstance 
of 
attracting 
Iron, 
of 
conferring 
upon 
it 
by 
its 
sole 
presence 
the 
same 
virtue, 
of 
communicating 
likewise 
to 
it 
the 
property 
of 
looking 
towards 
the 
Poles, 
as 
it 
also 
doth 
it 
self; 
and 
moreover 
endeavour 
to 
know 
by 
trial, 
that 
it 
containeth 
in 
it 
a 
virtue 
of 
conferring 
upon 
the 
magnetick 
needle 
not 
onely 
the 
direction 
under 
a 
Meridian 
towards 
the 
Poles, 
with 
an 
Horizontal 
motion, 



(a 
property 
a 
long 
time 
ago 
known) 
but 
a 
new 
found 
accident, 
of 
declining 
(being 
ballanced 
under 
the 
Meridian 
before 
marked 
upon 
a 
little 
spherical 
Magnet) 
of 
declining 
I 
say 
to 
determinate 
marks 
more 
or 
lesse, 
according 
as 
that 
needle 
is 
held 
nearer 
or 
farther 
from 
the 
Pole, 
till 
that 
upon 
the 
Pole 
it 
self 
it 
erecteth 
perpendicularly, 
whereasin 
the 
middleparts 
it 
is 
parallelto 
the 
Axis. 
Furthermore 
procure 
a 
proof 
to 
be 
made, 
whether 
the 
virtue 
of 
attracting 
Iron, 
residing 
much 
more 
vigorously 
about 
the 
Poles, 
than 
about 
the 
middle 
parts, 
this 
force 
be 
not 
notably 
more 
vigorous 
in 
one 
Pole 
than 
in 
the 
other, 
and 
that 
in 
all 
pieces 
of 
Magnet; 
the 
stronger 
of 
which 
Poles 
is 
that 
which 
looketh 
towards 
the 
South. 
Observe, 
in 
the 
next 
place, 
that 
in 
a 
little 
Magnet 
this 
South 
and 
more 
vigorous 
Pole, 
becometh 
weaker, 
when 
ever 
it 
is 
to 
take 
up 
an 
iron 
in 
presence 
of 
the 
North 
Pole 
of 
another 
much 
bigger 
Magnet: 
and 
not 
to 
make 
any 
tedious 
discourse 
of 
it, 
assertain 
your 
self, 
by 
experience, 
of 
these 
and 
many 
other 
properties 
described 
by 
Gilbert, 
which 
are 
all 
so 
peculiar 
to 
the 
Magnet, 
as 
that 
none 
of 
them 
agree 
with 
any 
other 
matter. 
Tell 
me 
now, 
Simplicius, 
if 
there 
were 
laid 
before 
you 
a 
thousand 
pieces 
of 
several 
matters, 
but 
all 
covered 
and 
concealed 
in 
a 
cloth, 
under 
which 
it 
is 
hid, 
and 
you 
were 
required, 
without 
uncovering 
them, 
a 
guesse, 
by 
external 
signes, 
at 
the 
matter 
of 
each 
of 
them, 
and 
that 
in 
making 
trial, 
you 
should 
hit 
upon 
one 
that 
should 
openly 
shew 
it 
self 
to 
have 
all 
the 
properties 
by 
you 
already 
acknowledged 
to 
reside 
onely 
in 
the 
Magnet, 
and 
in 
no 
other 
matter, 
what 
judgment 
would 
you 
make 
of 
the

of 
such 
a

If 
it 
be 
so, 
say 
resolutely, 
that 
under 
this 
cover 
and 
scurf 
of 
Earth, 
stones, 
metals, 
water, 
&c. 
there 
is 
hid 
a 
great 
Magnet, 
forasmuch 
as 
about 
the 
same 
there 
may 
be 
seen 
by 
any 
one 
that 
will 
heedfully 
observe 
the 
same, 
all 
those 
very 
accidents 
that 
agree 
with 
a 
true 
and 
visible 
Globe 
of 
Magnet; 
but 
if 
no 
more 
were 
to 
be 
seen 
than 
that 
of 
the 
Declinatory 
Needle, 
which 
being 
carried 
about 
the 
Earth, 
more 
and 
more 
inclineth, 
as 
it 
approacheth 
to 
the 
North 
Pole, 
and 
declineth 
lesse 
towards 
the 
Equinoctial, 
under 
which 
it 
finally 
is 
brought 
to 
an 
Aequilibrium, 
it 
might 
serve 
to 
perswade 
even 
the 



most 
scrupulous 
judgment. 
I 
forbear 
to 
mention 
that 
other 
admirable 
effect, 
which 
is 
sensibly 
observed 
in 
every 
piece 
of 
Magnet, 
of 
which, 
to 
us 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
Northern 
Hemisphere, 
the 
Meridional 
Pole 
of 
the 
said 
Magnet 
is 
more 
vigorous 
than 
the 
other; 
and 
the 
difference 
is 
found 
greater, 
by 
how 
much 
one 
recedeth 
from 
the 
Equinoctial; 
and 
under 
the 
Equinoctial 
both 
the 
parts 
are 
of 
equal 
strength, 
but 
notably 
weaker. 
But, 
in 
the 
Meridional 
Regions, 
far 
distant 
from 
the 
Equinoctial, 
it 
changeth 
nature, 
and 
that 
part 
which 
to 
us 
was 
more 
weak, 
acquireth 
more 
strength 
than 
the 
other: 
and 
all 
this 
I 
confer 
with 
that 
which 
we 
see 
to 
be 
done 
by 
a 
small 
piece 
of 
Magnet, 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
great 
one, 
the 
vertue 
of 
which 
superating 
the 
lesser, 
maketh 
it 
to 
become 
obedient 
to 
it, 
and 
according 
as 
it 
is 
held, 
either 
on 
this 
or 
on 
that 
side 
the 
Equinoctial 
of 
the 
great 
one, 
maketh 
the 
self 
same 
mutations, 
which 
I 
have 
said 
are 
made 
by 
every 
Magnet, 
carried 
on 
this 
side, 
orthatsideofthe 
Equinoctiallofthe

I 
was 
perswaded, 
at 
the 
very 
first 
reading 
of 
the 
Book 
of 
Gilbertus; 
and 
having 
met 
with 
a 
most 
excellent 
piece 
of 
Magnet, 
The 
Magnet 
armed 
takes 
up 
much 
more 
Iron, 
than 
when 
armed. 
I, 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
made 
many 
Observations, 
and 
all 
worthy 
of 
extream 
wonder; 
but 
above 
all, 
that 
seemeth 
to 
me 
very 
stupendious 
of 
increasing 
the 
faculty 
of 
taking 
up 
Iron 
so 
much 
by 
arming 
it, 
like 
as 
the 
said 
Authour 
teacheth; 
and 
with 
arming 
that 
piece 
of 
mine, 
I 
multiplied 
its 
force 
in 
octuple 
proportion; 
and 
whereas 
unarmed 
it 
scarce 
took 
up 
nine 
ounces 
of 
Iron, 
it 
being 
armed 
did 
take 
up 
above 
six 
pounds:

that

In 
my 
opinion, 
this 
Stone 
offers 
to 
the 
wit 
of 
man 
a 
large 
Field 
to 
Phylosophate 
in; 
and 
I 
have 
many 
times 
thought 
with 
my 
self, 
how 
it 
can 
be 
that 
it 
conferreth 
on 
that 
Iron, 
which 
armeth 
it, 
a 
strength 
so 
superiour 
to 
its 
own; 
and 
finally, 
I 
finde 
nothing 
that 
giveth 
me 
satisfaction 
herein; 
nor 
do 
I 
find 
any 
thing 
extraordinary 
in 
that 
which 
Gilbert 
writes 
about 
this 
particular; 
Iknownotwhetherthesamemay

SALV. 


I 
extreamly 
praise, 
admire, 
and 
envy 
this 
Authour, 
for 
that 
a 
conceit 
so 
stupendious 
should 
come 
into 
his 
minde, 
touching 
a 
thing 
handled 
by 
infinite 
sublime 
wits, 
and 
hit 
upon 
by 
none 
of 
them: 
I 
think 
him 
moreover 
worthy 
of 
extraordinary 
applause 
for 
the 
many 
new 
and 
true 
Observations 
that 
he 
made, 
to 
the 
disgrace 
of 
so 
many 
fabulous 
Authours, 
that 
write 
not 
only 
what 
they 
do 
not 
know, 
but 
what 
ever 
they 
hear 
spoken 
by 
the 
foolish 
vulgar, 
never 
seeking 
to 
assure 
themselves 
of 
the 
same 
by 
experience, 
perhaps, 
because 
they 
are 
unwilling 
to 
diminish 
the 
bulk 
of 
their 
Books. 
That 
which 
I 
could 
have 
desired 
in 
Gilbert, 
is, 
that 
he 
had 
been 
a 
little 
greater 
Mathematician, 
and 
particularly 
well 
grounded 
in 
Geometry, 
the 
practice 
whereof 
would 
have 
rendered 
him 
less 
resolute 
in 
accepting 
those 
reasons 
for 
true 
Demonstrations, 
which 
he 
produceth 
for 
true 
causes 
of 
the 
true 
conclusions 
observed 
by 
himself. 
Which 
reasons 
(freely 
speaking) 
do 
not 
knit 
and 
bind 
so 
fast, 
as 
those 
undoubtedly 
ought 
to 
do, 
in 
that 
of 
natural, 
necessary, 
and 
lasting 
conclusions 
may 
be 
alledged. 
And 
I 
doubt 
not, 
but 
that 
in 
processe 
of 
time 
this 
new 
Science 
will 
be 
perfected 
with 
new 
observations, 
and, 
which 
is 
more, 
with 
true 
and 
necessary 
Demonstrations. 
The 
first 
observers 
and 
inventers 
of 
things 
ought 
to 
be 
admired. 
Nor 
ought 
the 
glory 
of 
the 
first 
Inventor 
to 
be 
thereby 
diminished; 
nor 
do 
I 
lesse 
esteem, 
but 
rather 
more 
admire, 
the 
Inventor 
of 
the 
Harp 
(although 
it 
may 
be 
supposed 
that 
the 
Instrument 
at 
first 
was 
but 
rudely 
framed, 
and 
more 
rudely 
fingered) 
than 
an 
hundred 
other 
Artists, 
that 
in 
the 
insuing 
Ages 
reduced 
that 
profession 
to 
great 
perfection. 
And 
methinks, 
that 
Antiquity 
had 
very 
good 
reason 
to 
enumerate 
the 
first 
Inventors 
of 
the 
Noble 
Arts 
amongst 
the 
Gods; 
seeing 
that 



thecommonwitshave 
so 
little 
curiosity,andare 
so 
little 
regardful 
ofrareand 
elegant 
things, 
that 
though 
they 
see 
and 
hear 
them 
exercitated 
by 
the 
exquisite 
professors 
of 
them, 
yet 
are 
they 
not 
thereby 
perswaded 
to 
a 
desire 
of 
learning 
them. 
Now 
judge, 
whether 
Capacities 
of 
this 
kind 
would 
ever 
have 
attempted 
to 
have 
found 
out 
the 
making 
of 
the 
Harp, 
or 
the 
invention 
of 
Musick, 
upon 
the 
hint 
of 
the 
whistling 
noise 
of 
the 
dry 
sinews 
of 
a 
Tortois, 
or 
from 
the 
striking 
of 
four 
Hammers. 
The 
application 
to 
great 
inventions 
moved 
by 
small 
hints, 
and 
the 
thinking 
that 
under 
a 
primary 
and 
childish 
appearance 
admirable 
Arts 
may 
lie 
hid, 
is 
not 
the 
part 
of 
a 
trivial, 
but 
of 
a 
super-humane 
spirit. 
Now 
answering 
to 
your 
demands, 
I 
say, 
that 
I 
also 
have 
long 
thought 
upon 
what 
might 
possibly 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
so 
tenacious 
and 
potent 
union, 
that 
we 
see 
to 
be 
made 
between 
the 
one 
Iron 
that 
armeth 
the 
Magnet, 
and 
the 
other 
that 
conjoyns 
it 
self 
unto 
it. 
And 
first, 
The 
true 
cause 
of 
the 
multiplication 
of 
vertue 
in 
the 
Magnet, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
arming. 
we 
are 
certain, 
that 
the 
vertue 
and 
strength 
of 
the 
stone 
doth 
not 
augment 
by 
being 
armed, 
for 
it 
neither 
attracts 
at 
greater 
distance, 
nor 
doth 
it 
hold 
an 
Iron 
the 
faster, 
if 
between 
it, 
and 
the 
arming 
or 
cap, 
a 
very 
fine 
paper, 
or 
a 
leaf 
of 
beaten 
gold, 
be 
interposed; 
nay, 
with 
that 
interposition, 
the 
naked 
stone 
takes 
up 
more 
Iron 
than 
the 
armed. 
There 
is 
therefore 
no 
alteration 
in 
the 
vertue, 
and 
yet 
there 
is 
an 
innovation 
in 
the 
effect. 
And 
because 
its 
necessary, 
Of 
a 
neweffectitsnecessarythatthe 
causebe 
likewisenew. 
thatanew 
effecthave 
a 
new 
cause, 
if 
it 
be 
inquired 
what 
novelty 
is 
introduced 
in 
the 
act 
of 
taking 
up 
with 
the 
cap 
or 
arming, 
there 
is 
no 
mutation 
to 
be 
discovered, 
but 
in 
the 
different 
contact; 
for 
whereas 
before 
Iron 
toucht 
Loadstone, 
now 
Iron 
toucheth 
Iron. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
conclude, 
It 
is 
proved, 
that 
Iron 
consists 
of 
parts 
more 
subtil, 
pure, 
and 
compact 
than 
the 
magnet. 
that 
the 
diversity 
of 
contacts 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
diversity 
of 
effects. 
And 
for 
the 
difference 
of 
contacts 
it 
cannot, 
as 
I 
see, 
be 
derived 
from 
any 
thing 
else, 
save 
from 
that 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
Iron 
is 
of 
parts 
more 
subtil, 
more 
pure, 
and 
more 
compacted 
than 
those 
of 
the 
Magnet, 
which 
are 
more 
grosse, 
impure, 
and 
rare. 
From 
whence 
it 
followeth, 
that 
the 
superficies 
of 
two 
Irons 
that 
are 
to 
touch, 
by 
being 
exquisitely 
plained, 
filed, 
and 
burnished, 
do 
so 
exactly 
conjoyn, 
that 
all 
the 
infinite 
points 
of 
the 
one 
meet 
with 
the 
infinite 
points 
of 
the 
other; 
so 
that 
the 
filaments, 
if 
I 
may 
so 
say, 
that 
collegate 
the 
two 
Irons, 
are 
many 
more 
than 
those 
that 
collegate 
the 
Magnet 
to 
the 
Iron, 
by 
reason 
that 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
Magnet 
is 
more 
porous, 
and 
lesse 
compact, 
which 
maketh 
that 
all 
the 
points 
and 
filaments 
of 
the 
Loadstone 
do 
not 
close 
with 



that 
which 
it 
unites 
unto. 
In 
the 
next 
place, 
that 
the 
substance 
of 
Iron 
(especiallythewell 
refined,asnamely,thepureststeel)isof 
partsmuch 
more 
dense, 
subtil, 
and 
pure 
than 
the 
matter 
of 
the 
Loadstone, 
is 
seen, 
in 
that 
one 
may 
bring 
its 
edge 
to 
an 
extraordinary 
sharpnesse, 
such 
as 
is 
that 
of 
the 
Rasor, 
which 
can 
never 
be 
in 
any 
great 
measure 
effected 
in 
a 
piece 
of 
Magnet. 
A 
sensible 
proof 
of 
the 
impurity 
of 
the 
Magnet. 
Then, 
as 
for 
the 
impurity 
of 
the 
Magnet, 
and 
its 
being 
mixed 
with 
other 
qualities 
of 
stone, 
it 
is 
first 
sensibly 
discovered 
by 
the 
colour 
of 
some 
little 
spots, 
for 
the 
most 
part 
white; 
and 
next 
by 
presenting 
a 
needle 
to 
it, 
hanging 
in 
a 
thread, 
which 
upon 
those 
stonynesses 
cannot 
find 
repose, 
but 
being 
attracted 
by 
the 
parts 
circumfused, 
seemeth 
to 
fly 
from 
The 
Author 
hereby 
meaneth 
that 
the 
stone 
doth 
not 
all 
consist 
of 
magnetick 
matter, 
but 
that 
the 
whiter 
specks 
being 
weak, 
those 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
Loadstone 
of 
a 
more 
dark 
& 
constant 
colour, 
contain 
all 
that 
vertue 
wherewith 
bodies 
are 
attracted. 
those, 
and 
to 
leap 
upon 
the 
Magnet 
contiguous 
to 
them: 
and 
as 
some 
of 
those 
Heterogeneal 
parts 
are 
for 
their 
magnitude 
very 
visible, 
so 
we 
may 
believe, 
that 
there 
are 
others, 
in 
great 
abundance, 
which, 
for 
their 
smallnesse, 
are 
imperceptible, 
that 
are 
disseminated 
throughoutthe 
whole 
masse. 
That 
whichI 
say,(namely, 
that 
the 
multitude 
of 
contacts 
that 
are 
made 
between 
Iron 
and 
Iron, 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
so 
solid 
conjunction) 
is 
confirmed 
by 
an 
experiment, 
which 
is 
this, 
that 
if 
we 
present 
the 
sharpned 
point 
of 
a 
needle 
to 
the 
cap 
of 
a 
Magnet, 
it 
will 
stick 
no 
faster 
to 
it, 
than 
to 
the 
same 
stone 
unarmed: 
which 
can 
proceed 
from 
no 
other 
cause, 
than 
from 
the 
equality 
of 
the 
contacts 
that 
are 
both 
of 
one 
sole 
point. 
But 
what 
then? 
Let 
a 
A 
common 
sewing 
needle. 
Needle 
be 
taken 
and 
placed 
upon 
a 
Magnet, 
so 
that 
one 
of 
its 
extremities 
hang 
somewhat 
over, 
and 
to 
that 
present 
a 
Nail; 
to 
which 
the 
Needle 
will 
instantly 
cleave, 
insomuch 
that 
withdrawing 
the 
Nail, 
the 
Needle 
will 
stand 
in 
suspense, 
and 
with 
its 
two 
ends 
touching 
the 
Magnet 
and 
the 
Iron; 
and 
withdrawing 
the 
Nail 
yet 
a 
little 
further, 
the 
Needle 
will 
forsake 
the 
Magnet; 
provided 
that 
the 
eye 
of 
the 
Needle 
be 
towards 
the 
Nail, 
and 
the 
point 
towards 
the 
Magnet; 
but 
if 
the 
eye 
be 
towards 
the 
Loadstone, 
in 
withdrawing 
the 
Nail 
the 
Needle 
will 
cleave 
to 
the 
Magnet; 
and 
this, 
in 
my 
judgment, 
for 
no 
other 
reason, 
save 
onely 
that 
the 
Needle, 
by 
reason 
it 
is 
bigger 
towards 
the 
eye, 
toucheth 
in 
much 
more 
points 
thanits 
sharp 
point 
doth.

Your

been 
in 
my 
judgment 
very 
concluding, 
and 
this 
experiment 
of 
the 
Needle 
hath 
made 
me 
think 
it 
little 
inferiour 
to 
a 
Mathematical 
Demonstration; 
and 
I 
ingenuously 
confesse, 
that 
in 
all 
the 
Magnetick 
Philosophy, 
I 
never 
heard 
or 
read 
any 
thing, 
that 
with 
such 
strong 
reasons 
gave 
account 
of 
its 
so 
many 
admirable 
accidents, 
of 
which, 
if 
the 
causes 
were 
with 
the 
same 
perspicuity 
laid 
open, 
I 
know 
not

SALV. 


In 
seeking 
the 
reasons 
of 
conclusions 
unknown 
unto 
us, 
it 
is 
requisite 
to 
have 
the 
good 
fortune 
to 
direct 
the 
discourse 
from 
the 
very 
beginning 
towards 
the 
way 
of 
truth; 
in 
which 
if 
any 
one 
walk, 
it 
will 
easily 
happen, 
that 
one 
shall 
meet 
with 
several 
other 
Propositions 
known 
to 
be 
true, 
either 
by 
disputes 
or 
experiments, 
from 
the 
certainty 
of 
which 
the 
truth 
of 
ours 
acquireth 
strength 
and 
evidence; 
asitdid 
in 
every 
respecthappen 
to 
me 
in 
thepresent 
Probleme, 
for 
being 
desirous 
to 
assure 
my 
self, 
by 
some 
other 
accident, 
whether 
the 
reason 
of 
the 
Proposition, 
by 
me 
found, 
were 
true; 
namely, 
whether 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
Magnet 
were 
really 
much 
lesse 
continuate 
than 
that 
of 
Iron 
or 
of 
Steel, 
I 
made 
the 
Artists 
that 
work 
in 
the 
Gallery 
of 
my 
Lord 
the 
Grand 
Duke, 
to 
smooth 
one 
side 
of 
that 
piece 
of 
Magnet, 
which 
formerly 
was 
yours, 
and 
then 
to 
polish 
and 
burnish 
it; 
upon 
which 
to 
my 
satisfaction 
I 
found 
what 
I 
desired. 
For 
I 
discovered 
many 
specks 
of 
colour 
different 
from 
the 
rest, 
but 
as 
splendid 
and 
bright, 
as 
any 
of 
the 
harder 
sort 
of 
stones; 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
Magnet 
was 
polite, 
but 
to 
the 
tact 
onely, 
not 
being 
in 
the 
least 
splendid; 
but 
rather 
as 
if 
it 
were 
smeered 
over 
with 
foot; 
and 
this 
was 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
Load-stone, 
and 
the 
shining 
part 
was 
the 
fragments 
of 
other 
stones 
intermixt 
therewith, 
as 
was 
sensibly 
made 
known 
by 
presenting 
the 
face 
thereof 
to 
filings 
of 
Iron, 
the 
which 
in 
great 
number 
leapt 
to 
the 
Load-stone, 
but 
not 
so 
much 
as 
one 
grain 
did 
stick 
to 
the 
said 
spots, 
which 
were 
many, 
some 
as 
big 
as 
the 
fourth 
part 
of 
the 
nail 
of 
a 
mans 
finger, 
others 
somewhat 
lesser, 
the 
least 
of 
all 
very 
many, 
and 
those 
that 
were 
scarce 
visible 
almost 
innumerable. 
So 
that 
I 
did 
assure 
my 
self, 
that 
my 
conjecture 
was 
true, 
when 
I 
first 
thought 
that 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
Magnet 
was 
not 
close 
and 
compact, 
but 
porous, 
or 
to 
say 
better, 
spongy; 
but 
with 
this 
difference, 
that 
whereas 
the 
sponge 
in 
its 
cavities 
and 
little 
cels 
conteineth 
Air 
or 
Water, 
the 
Magnet 
hath 
its 
pores 
full 
of 
hard 
and 
heavy 
stone, 
as 
appears 
by 
the 
exquisite 
lustre 
which 
those 



specks 
receive. 
Whereupon, 
as 
I 
have 
said 
from 
the 
beginning, 
applying 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
Iron 
to 
the 
superficies 
of 
the 
Magnet 
the 
minute 
particles 
of 
the 
Iron, 
though 
perhaps 
more 
continuate 
than 
these 
of 
any 
other 
body 
(as 
its 
shining 
more 
than 
any 
other 
matter 
doth 
shew) 
do 
not 
all, 
nay 
but 
very 
few 
of 
them 
incounter 
pure 
Magnet; 
and 
the 
contacts 
being 
few, 
the 
union 
is 
but 
weak. 
But 
because 
the 
cap 
of 
the 
Load-stone, 
besides 
the 
contact 
of 
a 
great 
part 
of 
its 
superficies, 
invests 
its 
self 
also 
with 
the 
virtue 
of 
the 
parts 
adjoyning, 
although 
they 
touch 
not; 
that 
side 
of 
it 
being 
exactly 
smoothed 
to 
which 
the 
other 
face, 
in 
like 
manner 
well 
polisht 
of 
the 
Iron 
to 
be 
attracted, 
is 
applyed, 
the 
contract 
is 
made 
by 
innumerable 
minute 
particles, 
if 
not 
haply 
by 
the 
infinite 
points 
of 
both 
the 
superficies, 
whereupon 
the 
union 
becometh 
very 
strong. 
This 
observation 
of 
smoothing 
the 
surfaces 
of 
the 
Irons 
that 
are 
to 
touch, 
came 
not 
into 
the 
thoughts 
of 
Gilbert, 
for 
he 
makes 
the 
Irons 
convex, 
so 
that 
their 
contact 
is 
very 
small; 
and 
thereupon 
it 
cometh 
to 
passe 
that 
thetenacity,wherewiththoseIronsconjoyn,is 
much 
lesser. 


SAGR. 


I 
am, 
as 
I 
told 
you 
before, 
little 
lesse 
satisfied 
with 
this 
reason, 
that 
if 
it 
were 
a 
pure 
Geometrical 
Demonstration; 
and 
because 
we 
speak 
of 
a 
Physical 
Problem, 
I 
believe 
that 
also 
Simplicius 
will 
find 
himself 
satisfied 
as 
far 
as 
natural 
science 
admits, 
in 
which 
he 
knows 
thatGeometricalevidence 
is 
not

I 
think 
indeed, 
Sympathy 
and 
Antipathy, 
terms 
used 
by 
Philosophers 
to 
give 
a 
reason 
easily 
of 
many 
natural 
effests▪ 
that 
Salviatus 
with 
a 
fine 
circumlocution 
hath 
so 
manifestly 
displayed 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
effect, 
that 
any 
indifferent 
wit, 
though 
not 
verst 
in 
the 
Sciences, 
may 
apprehend 
the 
same; 
butwe, 
confiningour 
selves 
to 
the 
terms 
of 
Art,reduce 
thecause 
ofthese 
and 
other 
the 
like 
natural 
effects 
to 
Sympathy, 
which 
is 
a 
certain 
agreemet 
and 
mutual 
appetite 
which 
ariseth 
between 
things 
that 
are 
semblable 
to

And 
thus 
with 
these 
two 
words 
men 
come 
to 
render 
reasons 
of 
a 
great 
number 
of 
accidents 
and 
effects 
which 
we 
see 
not 
without 
admiration 
to 
be 
produced 
in

But 
this 
kind 
of 
philosophating 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
have 
great 
sympathy 
with 
a 
certain 
way 
of 
Painting

and 
left 
the

for 
the

set 
forth 
with

thus 
he 
perswaded 
himself 
that

had 
painted

are 
we 
wandred

so 
long 
a 
digression, 
contrary 
to 
our 
former 
resolutions? 
I 
have 
almost 
forgot

the 
point 
was 
that 
we 
were 
upon

we 
fell

be 
no 
motion 
but 
a 
quiescence 
and 
maintaining 
of

immutably 
directed

and 
looking 
towards

such

which 
most

we

the

that

which 
I 
would 
have 
intimated, 
was 
a 
certain 
consideration 
touching 
the 
scruple 
and 
objection 
of 
Simplicius, 
which 
he 
propounded 
against 
the 
mobility 
of 
the

impossible 
to 
be 
assigned 
to 
a 
simple 
body, 
of 
which 
but 
one 
sole 
and 
simple 
motion, 
according 
to 
the 
doctrine 
of 
Aristotle, 
can 
be 
natural; 
and 
that 
which 
I 
would 
have 
proposed 
to 
consideration, 
was 
the 
Magnet, 
to 
which 
we 
manifestly 
see 
three 
motions 
naturally 
to 
agree: 
one 
towards 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
as 
a 
Grave; 
the 
second 
is 
the 
circular 
Horizontal 
Motion, 
whereby 
it 
restores 
and 
conserves 
its 
Axis 
towards 
determinate 
parts 
of 
the 
Universe; 
and 
the 
third 
is 
this, 
newly 
discovered 
by 
Gilbert, 
of 
inclining 
its 
Axis, 
being 
in 
the 
plane 
of 
a 
Meridian 
towards 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
Earth, 
and 
this 
more 
and 
lesse, 
according 
as 
it 
shall 
be 
distant 
from 
the 
Equinoctial, 
under 
which 
it 
is 
parallel 
to 
the 
Axis 
of 
the 
Earth. 
Besides 
these 
three, 
it 
is 
not 
perhaps 
improbable, 
but 
that

Stay 
a 
little, 
Simplicius, 
& 
answer 
me 
to 
the 
questions 
I 
shall 
ask 
you. 
Aristole 
grants 
a 
compound 
motion 
to 
mixt 
bodies. 
You 
say 
that 
the 
Load-
stone 
is 
no 
simple 
body, 
now 
I 
desire 
you 
to 
tell 
me 
what 
those 
simple 
bodies 
are,that 
mingleincomposingtheLoad-stone. 


SIMP. 


I 
know 
not 
how 
to 
tell 
you 
th’ingredients 
nor 
simples 
precisely, 
but 
it 
sufficeththattheyarethingselementary. 


SALV. 



So 
much 
sufficeth 
me 
also. 
And 
of 
these 
simple 
elementary 
bodies, 
what 
are 
thenaturalmotions? 


SIMP. 


Theyarethe

SAGR. 


Tell 
me 
in 
the 
next 
place? 
Do 
you 
believe 
that 
the 
motion, 
that 
shall 
remain 
natural 
to 
that 
same 
mixed 
body, 
should 
be 
one 
that 
may 
result 
from 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
two 
simple 
natural 
motions 
of 
the 
simple 
bodies 
compounding, 
or 
that 
it 
may 
be 
a 
motion 
impossible 
to 
be 
composed 
of 
them. 
The 
motion 
of 
mixt 
bodies 
ought 
to 
be 
such 
as 
may 
result 
from 
the 
compositionofthemotionsofthesimplebodiescompounding. 


SIMP. 


I 
believe 
that 
it 
shall 
move 
with 
the 
motion 
resulting 
from 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
simple 
bodies

and 
that 
with 
a 
motion 
impossible 
tobecomposedof 
these,itisimpossible 
thatitshouldmove. 


SAGR. 


But, 
Simplicius, 
with 
two 
right 
and 
simple 
motions, 
you 
shall 
never 
be 
able 
to 
compose 
a 
circular 
motion, 
With 
two 
right 
motions 
one 
cannot 
compose 
circular 
motions. 
such 
as 
are 
the 
two, 
or 
three 
circular 
motions 
that 
the 
magnet 
hath: 
you 
see 
then 
into 
what 
absurdities 
evil 
grounded 
Principles, 
or, 
to 
say 
better, 
Philosophers 
are 
forced 
to 
confesse 
that 
the 
Magnet 
is 
compounded 
of 
coelestial 
substances, 
and 
of 
elementary. 
the 
ill-inferred 
consequences 
of 
good 
Principles 
carry 
a 
man; 
for 
you 
are 
now 
forced 
to 
say, 
that 
the 
Magnet 
is 
a 
mixture 
compounded 
of 
substances 
elementary 
and 
coelestial, 
if 
you 
will 
maintain 
that 
the 
straight 
motion 
is 
a 
peculiar 
to 
the 
Elements, 
and 
the 
circular 
to 
the 
coelestial 
bodies. 
Therefore 
if 
you 
will 
more 
safely 
argue, 
you 
must 
say, 
that 
of 
the 
integral 
bodies 
of 
the 
Universe, 
those 
that 
are 
by 
nature 
moveable, 
do 
all 
move 
circularly, 
and 
that 
therefore

as 
a

THE 
FOURTH 
DIALOGUE. 


INTERLOCVTORS. 
SALVIATUS,SAGREDUS,&SIMPLICIUS. 


SAGR. 


I 
know 
not 
whether 
your 
return 
to 
our 
accustomed 
conferences 
hath 
really 
been 
later 
than 
usual, 
or 
whether 
the 
desire 
of 
hearing 
the 
thoughts 
of 
Salviatus, 
touching 
a 
matter 
so 
curious, 
hath 
made 
me 
think 
it 
so: 
But 
I 
have 
tarried 
a 
long 
hour 
at 
this 
window, 
expecting 
every 
moment 
when 
the 
Gondola 
wouldappear 
thatIsenttofetchyou. 


SALV. 


I 
verily 
believe 
that 
your 
imagination 
more 
than 
our 
tarriance 
hath 
prolonged 
the 
time: 
Nature 
in 
sport 
maketh 
the 
ebbing 
and 
flowing 
of 
the 
Sea, 
to 
approve 
the 
Earth 
mobility. 
and 
to 
make 
no 
longer 
demurre, 
it 
would 
be 
well, 
if 
without 
interposing 
more 
words, 
we 
came 
to 
the 
matter 
it 
self; 
and 
did 
shew, 
that 
nature 
hath 
permitted 
(whether 
the 
business 
in 
rei 
veritate 
be 
so, 
or 
else 
to 
play 
and 
sport 
with 
our 
Fancies) 
hath, 
The 
tide, 
and 
mobility 
of 
the 
Earth 
mutually 
confirm 
each 
other. 
I 
say, 
hath 
permitted 
that 
the 
motions 
for 
every 
other 
respect, 
except 
to 
resolve 
the 
ebbing 
and 
flowing 
of 
the 
Sea, 
assigned 
long 
since 
to 
the 
earth, 
should 
be 
found 
now 
at 
last 
to 
answer 
exactly 
to 
the 
cause 
thereof; 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
All 
terrene 
effects, 
indifferently 
confirm 
the 
motion 
or 
rest 
of 
the 
Earth, 
except 
the 
ebbing 
and 
flowing 
of 
the 
Sea. 
with 
mutual 
a 
emulation, 
the 
said 
ebbing 
and 
flowing 
to 
appear 
in 
confirmation 
oftheTerrestrialmotion:thejudiceswhereofhavehithertobeen 
taken 
from 
the 
coelestial 
Phaenomena, 
in 
regard 
that 
of 
those 
things 
that 
happen 
on 
Earth, 
not 
any 
one 
was 
of 
force 
to 
prove 
one 
opinion 
more 
than 
another, 
as 
we 
already 
have 
at 
large 
proved, 
by 
shewing 
that 
all 
the 
terrene 
occurrences 
upon 
which 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
Earth 
and 
mobility 
of 
the 
Sun 
and 
Firmament 
is 
commonly 
inferred, 
are 
to 
seem 
to 
us 
performed 
in 
the 
same 
manner, 
though 
we 
supposed 
the 
mobility 
of 
the 
Earth, 
and 
the 
immobility 
of 
them. 
The 
Element 
of 
Water 
onely, 
as 
being 
most 
vast, 
and 
which 
is 
not 
annexed 
and 
concatenated 
to 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
as 
all 
its 
other 
solid 
parts 
are; 
yea, 
rather 
which 
by 
reason 
of 
its 
fluidity 
remaineth 
apart 
sui 
juris, 
and 
free, 
is 
to 
be 
ranked 
amongst 
those 
sublunary 
things, 
from 
which 
we 
may 
collect 
some 
hinte 
and 
intimation 
of 
what 
the 
Earth 
doth 
in 
relation 
to 
motion 



and 
rest. 
After 
I 
had 
manyandmany 
a 
time 
examined 
with 
my 
self 
theeffects 
and 
accidents, 
partly 
seen 
and 
partly 
understood 
from 
others, 
that 
are 
to 
be 
observed 
in 
the 
motions 
of 
waters: 
and 
moreover 
read 
and 
heard 
the 
great 
vanities 
produced 
by 
many, 
as 
the 
causes 
of 
those 
accidents, 
The 
first 
general 
conclusion 
of 
the 
impossibility 
of 
the 
ebbing 
and 
flowing 
the 
immobility 
of 
the 
terrestrial 
Globe 
being 
granted. 
I 
have 
been 
induced 
upon 
no 
slight 
reasons 
to 
omit 
these 
two 
conclusions 
(having 
made 
withal 
the 
necessary 
presupposals) 
that 
in 
case 
the 
terrestrial 
Globe 
be 
immoveable, 
the 
flux 
and 
reflux 
of 
the 
Sea 
cannot 
be 
natural; 
and 
that, 
in 
case 
those 
motions 
be 
conferredupon 
thesaidGlobe, 
which 
havebeen 
long 
sinceassignedtoit, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
the 
Sea 
be 
subject 
to 
ebbing 
and 
flowing, 
according 
to 
all 
that 
which 
we 
observetohappenin 
thesame. 


SAGR. 


The 
Proposition 
is 
very 
considerable, 
as 
well 
for 
it 
self 
as 
for 
what 
followeth 
upon 
the 
same 
by 
way 
of 
consequence, 
so 
that

shall

more

SALV. 


Because 
in 
natural 
questions, 
The 
knowledge 
of 
the 
effests 
contributes 
to 
the 
investigation 
of 
the 
causes. 
of 
which 
number 
this 
which 
we 
have 
in 
hand 
is 
one, 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
effects 
is 
a 
means 
to 
guide 
us 
to 
the 
investigation 
and 
discovery 
of 
the 
causes, 
and 
without 
which 
we 
should 
walk 
in 
the 
dark, 
nay 
with 
more 
uncertainty, 
for 
that 
we 
know 
not 
whither 
we 
would 
go, 
whereas 
the 
blind, 
at 
least, 
know 
where 
they 
desire 
to 
arrive; 
therefore 
first 
of 
all 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
know 
the 
effects 
whereof 
we 
enquire 
the 
causes: 
of 
which 
effects 
you, 
Sagredus, 
ought 
more 
abundantly 
and 
more 
certainly 
to 
be 
informed 
than 
I 
am, 
as 
one, 
that 
besides 
your 
being 
born, 
and 
having, 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
dwelt 
in 
Venice, 
where 
the 
Tides 
are 
very 
notable 
for 
their 
greatnesse, 
have 
also 
sailed 
into 
Syria, 
and, 
as 
an 
ingenuous 
and 
apprehensive 
wit, 
must 
needs 
have 
made 
many 
Observations 
upon 
this 
subject: 
whereas 
I, 
that 
could 
onely 
for 
a 
time, 
and 
that 
very 
short, 
observe 
what 
happened 
in 
these 
extream 
parts 
of 
the 
Adriatick 
Gulph, 
and 
in 
our 
Seas 
below 
about 
the 
Tyrrhene 
shores, 
must 
needs 
take 
many 
things 
upon 
the 
relation 
of 
others, 
who, 
for 
the 
most 
part, 
not 
very 
well 
agreeing, 
and 
consequently 
being 
very 
uncertain, 
contribute 
more 
of 
confusion 
than 



confirmation 
to 
our 
speculations. 
Neverthelesse, 
from 
those 
that 
we 
are 
sure 
of, 
and 
which 
are 
the 
principal, 
I 
think 
I 
am 
able 
to 
attain 
to 
the 
true 
and 
primary 
causes; 
not 
that 
I 
pretend 
to 
be 
able 
to 
produce 
all 
the 
proper 
and 
adequate 
reasons 
of 
those 
effects 
that 
are 
new 
unto 
me, 
and 
which 
consequently 
I 
could 
never 
have 
thought 
upon. 
And 
that 
which 
I 
have 
to 
say, 
I 
propose 
only, 
as 
a 
key 
that 
openeth 
the 
door 
to 
a 
path 
never 
yet 
trodden 
by 
any, 
in 
certain 
hope, 
that 
some 
wits 
more 
speculative 
than 
mine, 
will 
make 
a 
further 
progresse 
herin, 
and 
penetrate 
much 
farther 
than 
I 
shall 
have 
done 
in 
this 
my 
first 
Discovery: 
And 
although 
that 
in 
other 
Seas, 
remote 
from 
us, 
there 
may 
appen 
several 
accidents, 
which 
do 
not 
happen 
in 
our 
Mediterranean 
Sea, 
yet 
doth 
not 
this 
invalidate 
the 
reason 
and 
cause 
that 
I 
shall 
produce, 
if 
so 
be 
that 
it 
verifie 
and 
fully 
resolve 
the 
accidents 
which 
evene 
in 
our 
Sea: 
for 
that 
in 
conclusion 
there 
can 
be 
but 
one 
true 
and 
primary 
cause 
of 
the 
effects 
that 
are 
of 
the 
same 
kind. 
I 
will 
relate 
unto 
you, 
therefore, 
theeffectsthat 
Iknowtobetrue,and 
assigne 
the 
causesthereofthat 
Ithink 
to 
be 
true, 
and 
you 
also, 
Gentlemen, 
shall 
produce 
such 
others 
as 
are 
known 
to 
you, 
besides 
mine, 
and 
then 
we 
will 
try 
whether 
the 
cause, 
by 
me 
alledged, 
may 
satisfie 
them 
also. 
Three 
Periods 
of 
ebbings 
and 
flowings, 
diurnal, 
monethly,andannual. 


I 
therefore 
affirm 
the 
periods 
that 
are 
observed 
in 
the 
fluxes 
and 
refluxes 
of 
the 
Sea-waters 
to 
be 
three: 
the 
first 
and 
principal 
is 
this 
great 
and 
most 
obvious 
one; 
namely, 
the 
diurnal, 
according 
to 
which 
the 
intervals 
of 
some 
hours 
with 
the 
waters 
flow 
and 
ebbe; 
and 
these 
intervals 
are, 
for 
the 
most 
part, 
in 
the 
Mediterrane 
from 
six 
hours 
to 
six 
hours, 
or 
thereabouts, 
that 
is, 
they 
for 
six 
hours 
flow, 
and 
for 
six 
hours 
ebbe. 
The 
second 
period 
is 
monethly, 
and 
it 
seemes 
to 
take 
its 
origen 
from 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Moon, 
not 
that 
it 
introduceth 
other 
motions, 
but 
only 
altereth 
the 
greatnesse 
of 
those 
before 
mentioned, 
with 
a 
notable 
difference, 
according 
as 
it 
shall 
wax 
or 
wane, 
or 
come 
to 
the 
Quadrature 
with 
the 
Sun. 
The 
third 
Period 
is 
annual, 
and 
is 
seen 
to 
depend 
on 
the 
Sunne, 
and 
onely 
altereth 
the 
diurnal 
motions, 
by 
making 
them 
different 
in 
the

We 
will 
speak 
(in 
the 
first 
place, 
of 
the 
diurnal 
motion, 
as

alterations. 
Three 
differences 
are 
observable 
in 
these 
horary 
mutations; 
for 
in 
some 
places 
the 
waters 
rise 
and 
fall, 
without 
making 
any 
progressive 
motion; 
in 
others, 
without 
rising 
or 
falling 
they 
run 
one 
while 
towards 
the 
East, 
and 
recur 
another 
while 
towards 
the 
West; 
and 
in 
others 
they 
vary 
the 
heights 
and 
course 
also, 
as 
happeneth 
here 
in 
Venice, 
where 
the 
Tides 
in 
coming 
in 
rise, 
and 
in 
going 
out 
fall; 
and 
this 
they 
do 
in 
the 
extermities 
of 
the 
lengths 
of 
Gulphs 
that 
distend 
from 
West 
to 
East, 
and 
terminate 
in 
open 
shores,

butif 
the 
course 
of

were 
intercepted 
by 
Cliffes 
and 
Banks 
of 
great 
height 
and 
steepnesse, 
there 
it 
will 
flow 
and 
ebbe 
without 
any 
progressive 
motion. 
Again, 
it 
runs 
to 
and 
again, 
without 
changing 
height 
in 
the 
middle 
parts 
of 
the 
Mediterrane, 
as 
notably 
happeneth 
in 
theA 
Strair, 
so 
called.

Messina,

Scylla 
and 
Carybdis,

the

by 
reason 
of 
the 
narrownesse 
of 
the

are 
very 
swift; 
but 
in 
the 
more 
open 
Seas, 
and 
about 
the 
Isles 
that 
stand 
farther 
into 
the 
Mediterranean 
Sea, 
as 
the 
Baleares, 
Corsica, 
Sardignia, 
Or

Elba, 
Sicily 
towards 
the 
Affrican 
Coasts, 
Malta, 
Or 
Crets. 
Candia, 
&c. 
the 
changes 
of 
watermark 
are 
very 
small; 
but 
the 
currents 
indeed 
are 
very 
notable, 
and 
especially 
when 
the 
Sea 
is 
pent 
between 
Islands, 
orbetweenthemandtheContinent. 


Now 
these 
onely 
true 
and 
certain 
effects, 
were 
there 
no 
more 
to 
be 
observed, 
do, 
in 
my

probably

contain

within 
the

grant 
the

for 
to 
make

it 
may 
be 
called)

stand 
still, 
and 
to 
make 
the

contained 
therein 
to 
do, 
as 
it 
doth,

These

begin 
not 
now, 
they 
are 
most 
ancient, 
and 
have 
been 
observed 
by 
very 
many, 
and 
several 
have 
attempted 
to 
assigne, 
some 
one, 
some 
another 
cause 
for 
the

and 
there 
dwelleth 
not

famous

Text 
of

by

from 
which 
Text 
he 
collecteth, 
that 
the 
true 
cause 
of 
these 



motions 
doth 
only 
proceed 
from 
the 
different 
profundities 
of 
Seas 
waters 
of 
greatest 
depth 
being 
greater 
in 
abundance, 
and 
therefore 
more 
grave, 
drive 
back 
the 
Waters 
of 
lesse 
depth, 
which 
being 
afterwards 
raised, 
desire 
to 
descend, 
and 
from 
this 
continual 
colluctation 
or 
contest 
proceeds 
the 
ebbing 
and 
flowing. 
The 
cause 
of 
the 
ebbing 
and 
flowing 
ascribed 
to 
the 
Moon 
by 
a 
certain 
Prelate. 
Again 
those 
that 
referre 
the 
same 
to 
the 
Moon 
are 
many, 
saying 
that 
she 
hath 
particular 
Domination 
over 
the 
Water; 
and 
at 
last 
a 
certain 
Prelate 
hath 
published 
a 
little 
Treatise, 
wher 
in 
he 
saith 
that 
the 
Moon 
wandering 
too 
and 
fro 
in 
the 
Heavens 
attracteth 
and 
draweth 
towards 
it 
a 
Masse 
of 
Water, 
which 
goeth 
continually 
following 
it, 
so 
that 
it 
is 
full 
Sea 
alwayes 
in 
that 
part 
which 
lyeth 
under 
the 
Moon; 
and 
because, 
that 
though 
she 
be 
under 
the 
Horizon, 
yet 
neverthelesse 
the 
Tide 
returneth, 
he 
saith 
that 
no 
more 
can 
be 
said 
for 
the 
salving 
of 
that 
particular, 
save 
onely, 
that 
the 
Moon 
doth 
not 
onely 
naturally 
retain 
this 
faculty 
in 
her 
self; 
but 
in 
this 
case 
hath 
power 
to 
confer 
it 
upon 
that 
degree 
of 
the 
Zodiack 
that 
is 
opposite 
unto 
it. 
Others, 
Hieronymus 
Borrius 
and 
other 
Peripateticks 
refer 
it 
to 
the 
temperate 
heat 
of 
the 
Moon, 
as 
I 
believe 
you 
know, 
do 
say 
that 
the 
Moon 
is 
able 
with 
her 
temperate 
heat 
to 
rarefie 
the 
Water, 
which 
being 
rarefied,

Sagredus, 
will 
spend 
a 
few 
words 
in 
favour 
of 
Simplicius, 
if 
haply 
he 
thinks 
that 
any 
probability 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
those 
things 
that 
he 
hath 
related. 
I 
say 
therefore: 
The 
Waters, 
Simplicius, 
that 
have 
their 
exteriour 
superficies 
higher, 
repel 
those 
that 
are 
inferiour 
to 
them,

lower;

so 
do 
not 
those 
Waters

opinion, 
that

that 
all 
the

where 
the 
ebbing 
and

is 
insensible, 
are 
level 
in 
their

but 
I 
was 
so 
simple, 
that 
I 
perswaded 
my 
self 
that 
had 
we 
no

the

had 
been 
a 
sufficient 
evidence 
of 
the 
unevennesse 
of 
their

for

bid 
them

of 
the

concerning

of

which 
are

because 
I 
know 
that 
of 
one

there 
is 
but 
one 
single 
cause 
that 
is 
true 
and 
primary, 
I 
understand 
very 
well,

am 
certain 
that 
but 
one 
alone 
at 
the 
most 
can 
be 
true, 
and 
for 
all 
the 
rest 
I 
am 
sure 
that 
they 
are

its 
possible 
that 
the 
true

this 
I

that 
the

seemeth 
to 
me 
as 
yet 
a 
conjecture 
no 
lesse 
fabulous 
than 
the 
rest 
of 
those 
that 
I 
have 
heard; 
and 
if 
there 
should 
not

proposed

me 
reasons 
more 
conformable 
to

matters, 
I 
would 
without 
any 
more 
ado 
proceed 
to 
believe 
this 
to 
be 
a 
supernatural 
effect,

therefore

You 
argue 
very 
prudently, 
Aristotle 
holdeth 
those 
effects 
to 
be 
miraculous, 
of 
which 
the 
causes 
are 
unknown. 
and 
according 
to 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
Aristotle, 
who 
you 
know 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
his 
mechanical 
questions 
referreth 
those 
things 
to 
a 
Miracle, 
the 
causes 
whereof 
are 
occult. 
But 
that 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
ebbing 
and 
flowing 
is 
one 
of 
those 
that 
are 
not 
to

there

one 
wherewith, 
working 
by 
what 
artifice 
you 
will, 
we 
are 
able 
to 
represent 
such 
an 
effect; 
in 
regard 
that 
neither 
with 
the 
light 
of 
the 
Moon 
nor 
of 
the 
Sun, 
nor 
with 
temperate 
heats, 
nor 
with 
different

shall 
one 
ever 
artificially 
make 
the

conteined 
in 
an 
immoveable

one 
way 
or 
another, 
and 
to 
ebbe 
and 
flow 
in 
one 
place, 
and 
not 
in 
another. 
But 
if 
without 
any 
other 
artifice, 
but 
with 
the 
onely 
moving 
of 
the

I 
am

you 
do 
not 
with

natural

besides 
that 
of 
the

of 
the

of 
the

disswade 
me 
from

I

move

Then 
Simplicius, 
seeing 
that 
to 
make 
the 
flux 
and 
reflux 
of 
the 
Sea, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
introduce 
a 
Miracle, 
let 
us 
suppose 
the 
Earth 
to 
move 
miraculously, 
upon 
the 
motion 
of 
which 
the 
Sea 
moveth 
naturally: 
and 
this 
effect 
shall 
be 
also 
the 
more 
simple, 
and 
I 
may 
say 
natural, 
amongst 
the 
miraculous 
operations, 
in 
that 
the 
making 
a 
Globe 
to 
move 
round, 
of 
which 
kind 
we 
see 
many 
others 
to 
move, 
is 
lesse 
difficult 
than 
to 
make 
an 
immense 
masse 
of 
water 
go 
forwards 
and 
backwards, 
in 
one 
place 
more 
swiftly, 
and 
in 
another 
lesse, 
and 
to 
rise 
and 
fall 
in 
some 
places 
more; 
in 
some 
lesse, 
and 
in 
some 
not 
at 
all: 
and 
to 
work 
all 
these 
different 
effects 
in 
one 
and 
the 
same 
Vessel 
that 
containeth 
it: 
besides, 
that 
these 
are 
several 
Miracles, 
and 
that 
is 
but 
one 
onely. 
And 
here 
it 
may 
be 
added, 
that 
the 
Miracle 
of 
making 
the 
water 
to 
move 
is 
accompanied 
with 
another, 
namely, 
the 
holding 
of 
the 
Earth 
stedfast 
against

of 
the

nor 
doth 
my 
saying, 
that 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth 
is 
the 
Natural 
cause 
of 
the 
ebbing 
and 
flowing, 
hinder, 
but 
that 
the 
said 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth 
may 
be 
miraculous. 
Now 
reassuming 
our 
Argument, 
I 
apply, 
and 
once 
again 
affirm, 
that 
it 
hath 
been 
hitherto 
unknown 
how 
it 
might 
be 
that 
the 
Waters 
contained 
in 
our 
Mediterranean 
Straights 
should 
make 
those 
motions, 
as 
we 
see 
it 
doth, 
if 
so 
be 
the 
said 
Straight, 
or 
containing 
Vessel 
were 
immoveable. 
And 
that 
which 
makes 
the 
difficulty, 
and 
rendreth 
this 
matter 
inextricable, 
are 
the 
things 
which 
I 
am 
about 
to 
speak 
of, 
and 
which 
aredailyobserved. 
Thereforelendmeyourattention. 



We 
are 
here 
in 
Venice, 
where 
at 
this 
time 
the 
Waters 
are 
low, 
the 
Sea 
calm, 
It 
is 
proved 
impossible 
that 
there 
should 
naturally 
be 
any 
ebbing 
and 
flowing, 
the 
Earth 
being 
immoveable. 
the 
Air 
tranquil; 
suppose 
it 
to 
be 
young 
flood, 
and 
that 
in 
the 
term 
of 
five 
or 
six 
hours 
the 
water 
do 
rise 
ten 
Palms. 
hand 
breadths 
and 
more; 
that 
rise 
is 
not 
made 
by 
the 
first 
water, 
which 
was 
said 
to 
be 
rarefied, 
but 
it 
is 
done 
by 
the 
accession 
of 
new 
Water: 
Water 
of 
the 
same 
sort 
with 
the 
former, 
of 
the 
same 
brackishness, 
of 
the 
same 
density, 
of 
the 
same 
weight: 
Ships, 
Simplicius, 
float 
therein 
as 
in 
the 
former, 
without 
drawing 
an 
hairs 
breadth 
more 
water; 
a 
Barrel 
of 
this 
second 
doth 
not 
weigh 
one 
single 
grain 
more 
or 
less 
than 
such 
another 
quantity 
of 
the 
other, 
and 
retaineth 
the 
same 
coldness 
without 
the 
least 
alteration: 
And 
it 
is, 
in 
a 
word, 
Water 
newly 
and 
visibly 
entred 
by 
the 
Channels 
and 
Mouth 
of 
theLio 
is 
a 
fair 
Port 
in 
the 
Venetian 
Gulph, 
lying 
N. 
E. 
from 
the 
City. 
Lio. 
Consider 
now, 
how 
and 
from 
whence 
it 
came 
thither. 
Are 
there 
happly 
hereabouts 
any 
Gulphs 
or 
Whirle-pools 
in 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
Sea, 
by 
which 
the 
Earth 
drinketh 
in 
and 
spueth 
out 
the 
Water, 
breathing 
as 
it 
were 
a 
great 
and 
monstruous 
Whale? 
But 
if 
this 
be 
so, 
how 
comes 
it 
that 
the 
Water 
doth 
not 
flow 
in 
the 
space 
of 
six 
hours 
in 
Ancona, 
in 
* 
Ragusa, 
in 
Corfu, 
where 
the 
Tide 
is 
very 
small, 
and 
happly 
unobservable? 
Who 
will 
invent 
a 
way 
to 
pour 
new 
Water 
into 
an 
immoveable 
Vessel, 
and 
to 
make 
that 
it 
rise 
onely 
in 
one 
determinate 
part 
of 
it, 
and 
in 
other 
places 
not? 
Will 
you 
say, 
that 
this 
new 
Water 
is 
borrowed 
from 
the 
Ocean, 
being 
brought 
in 
by 
the 
Straight 
of 
Gibraltar? 
This 
will 
not 
remove 
the 
doubt 
aforesaid, 
but 
will 
beget 
a 
greater. 
And 
first 
tell 
me 
what 
ought 
to 
be 
the 
current 
of 
that 
Water, 
that 
entering 
at 
the 
Straights 
mouth, 
is 
carried 
in 
six 
hours 
to 
the 
remotest 
Creeks 
of 
the 
Mediterrane, 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
two 
or 
three 
thousand 
Miles, 
and 
that 
returneth 
the 
same 
space 
again 
in 
a 
like 
time 
at 
its 
going 
back? 
What 
would 
Ships 
do 
that 
lye 
out 
at 
Sea? 
What 
would 
become 
of 
those 
that 
should 
be 
in 
the 
Straights-mough 
in 
a 
continual 
precipice 
of 
a 
vast 
accumulation 
of 
Waters, 
that 
entering 
in 
at 
a 
Channel 
but 
eight 
Miles 
broad, 
is 
to 
give 
admittance 
to 
so 
much 
Water 
as 
in 
six 
hours 
over-floweth 
a 
tract 
of 
many 
hundred 
Miles 
broad, 
& 
thousands 
in 
length? 
What 
Tygre, 
what 
Falcon 
runneth 
or 
flyeth 
with 
so 
much 
swiftness? 
With 
the 
swiftness, 
I 
say, 
of 
above 
400 
Miles 
an 
hour. 
The 
currents 
run 
(nor 
can 
it 
be 
denied) 
the 
long-wayes 
of 
the 
Gulph, 
but 
so 
slowly, 
as 
that 
a 
Boat 
with 
Oars 
will 
out-go 
them, 
though 
indeed 
not 
without 
defalking 
for 
their 
wanderings. 
Moreover, 
if 
this 
Water 
come 
in 
at 
the 
Straight, 
the 
other 
doubt 
yet 
remaineth, 
namely, 
how 
it 
cometh 
to 
flow 
here 
so 
high 
in 
a 
place 
so 



remote, 
without 
first 
rising 
a 
like 
or 
greater 
height 
in 
the 
parts 
more 
adjacent? 
In 
a 
word, 
I 
cannot 
think 
that 
either 
obstinacy, 
or 
sharpness 
of 
wit 
can 
ever 
find 
an 
answer 
to 
these 
Objections, 
nor 
consequently 
to 
maintain 
the 
stability 
oftheEarthagainstthem,keepingwithinthe 
boundsofNature. 


SAGR. 


I 
have 
all 
the 
while 
perfectly 
apprehended 
you 
in 
this; 
and 
I 
stand 
greedily 
attending 
to 
hear 
in 
what 
manner 
these 
wonders 
may 
occur 
without 
obstructionfrom 
themotion 
already 
assignedto 
the 
Earth. 


SALV. 


These 
effects 
being 
to 
ensue 
in 
consequence 
of 
the 
motions 
that 
naturally 
agree 
with 
the 
Earth, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
they 
not 
onely 
meet 
with 
no 
impediment 
or 
obstacle, 
but 
that 
they 
do 
follow 
easily, 
& 
not 
onely 
that 
they 
follow 
with 
facility, 
but 
with 
necessity, 
so 
as 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
succeed 
otherwise, 
for 
such 
is 
the 
property 
& 
condition 
of 
things 
natural 
& 
true. 
Having 
therefore 
shewen 
the 
impossibility 
of 
rendring 
a 
reasonofthe 
motions 
discerned 
intheWaters,Trueandnaturaleffectsfollow 
without 
difficulty. 
& 
at 
the 
same 
time 
to 
maintain 
the 
immobility 
of 
the 
vessel 
that 
containeth 
them 
we 
may 
proceed 
to 
enquire, 
whether 
the 
mobility 
of 
the 
Container 
may 
produce 
the 
required 
effect, 
in 
the 
manner 
that 
it 
is 
observedtoevene. 


Two 
kinds 
of 
motions 
may 
be 
conferred 
upon 
a 
Vessel, 
whereby 
the 
Water 
therein 
contained, 
Two 
sorts 
of 
motions 
of 
the 
containing 
Vessel, 
may 
make 
the 
contained 
water 
to 
rise 
and 
fall. 
may 
acquire 
a 
faculty 
of 
fluctuating 
in 
it, 
one 
whiletowards 
one 
side,and 
another 
whiletowards 
another; 
and 
there 
one 
whileto 
ebbe, 
and 
anotherwhile 
toflow. 
Thefirst 
is,when 
firstone, 
and 
then 
another 
of 
those 
sides 
is 
declined, 
for 
then 
the 
Water 
running 
towards 
the 
inclining 
side, 
will 
alternately 
be 
higher 
and 
lower, 
sometimes 
on 
one 
side, 
and 
sometimes 
on 
another. 
But 
because 
that 
thisrising 
and 
abatingisno 
other 
than 
a 
recession 
and 
accession 
to 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth, 
such 
a 
motion 
cannot 
be 
ascribed 
to 
the 
Cavities 
of 
the 
said 
Earth, 
that 
are 
the 
Vessels 
which 
contain 
the 
Waters; 
the 
parts 
of 
which 
Vessel 
cannot 
by 
any 
whatsoever 
motion 
assigned 
to 
the

The 
Cavities

be 
made 
to 
approach 
or 



recede 
from 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
same: 
The 
other 
sort 
of 
motion 
is, 
when 
the 
Vessel 
moveth 
(without 
inclining 
in 
the 
least) 
with 
a 
progressive 
motion, 
not 
uniform, 
but 
that 
changeth 
velocity, 
by 
sometimes 
accellerating, 
and 
other 
times 
retarding: 
from 
which 
disparity 
it 
would 
follow, 
The 
progpessive 
and 
uneven 
motion 
may 
make 
the 
water 
contained 
in 
a 
Vessel 
to 
run 
to 
and 
fro. 
that 
the 
Water 
contained 
in 
the 
Vessel 
its 
true, 
but 
not 
fixed 
fast 
to 
it, 
as 
its 
other 
solid 
parts, 
but 
by 
reason 
of 
its 
fluidity, 
as 
if 
it 
were 
separated 
and 
at 
liberty, 
and 
not 
obliged 
to 
follow 
all 
the 
mutations 
of 
its 
Container, 
in 
the 
retardation 
of 
the 
Vessel, 
it 
keeping 
part 
of 
the 
impetus 
before 
conceived, 
would 
run 
towards 
the 
the 
preceding 
part, 
whereupon 
it 
would 
of 
necessity 
come 
to 
rise; 
and 
on 
the 
contrary, 
if 
new 
velocity 
should 
be 
added 
to 
the 
Vessel, 
with 
retaining 
parts 
of 
its 
tardity, 
staying 
somewhat 
behind, 
before 
it 
could 
habituate 
it 
self 
to 
the 
new 
impetus, 
it 
would 
hang 
back 
towards 
the 
following 
part, 
where 
it 
would 
come 
to 
rise 
something. 
The 
which 
effects 
we 
mayplainly 
declare 
andmakeouttotheSensebytheexample 
ofoneofthose 
same 
Barks 
yonder, 
which 
continually 
come 
from 
A 
Town 
lying 
S. 
E. 
of 
Venice 
Lizza-Fusina, 
laden 
with 
fresh 
water, 
for 
the 
service 
of 
the 
City. 
Let 
us 
therefore 
fancy 
one 
of 
those 
Barks, 
to 
come 
from 
thence 
with 
moderate 
velocity 
along 
the 
Lake, 
carrying 
the 
water 
gently, 
of 
which 
it 
is 
full: 
and 
then 
either 
by 
running 
a 
ground, 
or 
by 
some 
other 
impediment 
that 
it 
shall 
meet 
with, 
let 
it 
be 
notably 
retarded. 
The 
water 
therein 
contained 
shall 
not, 
by 
that 
means, 
lose, 
as 
the 
Bark 
doth, 
its 
pre-conceived 
impetus, 
but 
retaining 
the 
same, 
shall 
run 
forwards 
towards 
the 
prow, 
where 
it 
shall 
rise 
notably, 
falling 
as 
much 
a 
stern. 
But 
if, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
said 
Bark, 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
its 
smooth 
course, 
shall 
have 
a 
new 
velocity, 
with 
notable 
augmentation 
added 
to 
it, 
the 
water 
contained 
before 
it 
can 
habituate 
it 
self 
thereto, 
continuing 
in 
its 
tardity, 
shall 
stay 
behinde, 
namely 
a 
stern, 
where 
of 
consequence 
it 
shall 
mount, 
and 
abate 
for 
the 
same 
at 
the 
prow. 
This 
effect 
is 
undoubted 
and 
manifest, 
and 
may 
hourly 
be 
experimented; 
in 
which 
I 
desire 
that 
for 
the 
present 
three 
particulars 
may 
be 
noted. 
The 
first 
is, 
that 
to 
make 
the 
water 
to 
rise 
on 
one 
side 
of 
the 
vessel, 
there 
is 
no 
need 
of 
new 
water, 
nor 
that 
it 
run 
thither, 
forsaking 
the 
other 
side. 
The 
second 
is, 
that 
the 
water 
in 
the 
middle 
doth 
not 
rise 
or 
fall 
notably, 
unlesse 
the 
course 
of 
the 
Bark 
were 
not 
before 
that 
very 
swift, 
and 
the 
shock 
or 
other 
arrest 
that 
held 
it 
exceeding 
strong 
and 
sudden, 
in 
which 
case 
its 
possible, 
that 
not 
only 
all 
the 
water 
might 
run 
forwards, 
but 
that 
the 
greater 
part 
thereof 
might 
issue 
forth 
of 
the 
Bark: 
and 
the 
same 
also 
would 
ensue, 
whilst 
that 
being 
under 
sail 
in 
a 
smooth 



course, 
a 
most 
violent 
impetus 
should, 
upon 
an 
instant, 
overtake 
it: 
But 
when 
to 
its 
calme 
motion 
there 
is 
added 
a 
moderate 
retardation 
or 
incitation, 
the 
middle 
parts 
(as 
I 
said) 
unobservedly 
rise 
and 
fall: 
and 
the 
other 
parts, 
according 
as 
they 
are 
neerer 
to 
the 
middle, 
rise 
the 
lesse; 
and 
the 
more 
remote, 
more. 
The 
third 
is, 
that 
whereas 
the 
parts 
about 
the 
midst 
do 
make 
little 
alteration 
in 
rising 
and 
falling, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
waters 
of 
the 
sides; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
they 
run 
forwards 
and 
backwards 
very 
much, 
in 
comparison 
of 
the 
extreams. 
Now, 
my 
Masters, 
that 
which 
the 
Bark 
doth, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
water 
by 
it 
contained, 
and 
that 
which 
the 
water 
contained 
doth, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
Bark 
its 
container, 
is 
the 
self-same, 
to 
an 
hair, 
with 
that 
which 
the 
Mediterranean 
Vessel 
doth, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
waters 
in 
it 
contained, 
and 
that 
which 
the 
waters 
contained 
do, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
Mediterranean 
Vessel 
their 
container. 
The 
parts 
of 
the 
terrestrial 
Globe 
accelerate 
and 
regard 
in 
their 
motion. 
It 
followeth 
now 
that 
we 
demonstrate 
how, 
and 
in 
what 
manner 
it 
is 
true, 
that 
the 
Mediterrane, 
and 
all 
the 
other 
Straits; 
and 
in 
a 
word, 
all 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Earth 
do 
all 
move, 
with 
a 
motion 
notably 
uneven, 
though 
no 
motion 
that 
is 
not 
regular 
and 
uniforme, 
is 
thereby 
assigned 
to 
all 
the 
said 
Globe 
takencollectively. 


SIMP. 


This 
Proposition, 
at 
first 
sight 
to 
me, 
that 
am 
neither 
Geometrician 
nor 
Astronomer, 
hath 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
very 
great 
Paradox; 
and 
if 
it 
should 
be 
true, 
that 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
whole, 
being 
regular, 
that 
of 
the 
parts, 
which 
are 
all 
united 
to 
their 
whole, 
may 
be 
irregular, 
the 
Paradox 
will 
overthrow 
the

Eandemesse

I 
will 
demonstrate 
my 
Paradox, 
and 
leave 
it 
to 
your 
care, 
Simplicius, 
to 
defend 
the 
Axiome 
from 
it, 
or 
else 
to 
reconcile 
them; 
and 
my 
demonstration 
shall 
be 
short 
and 
familiar, 
depending 
on 
the 
things 
largely 
handled 
in 
our 
precedent 
conferences, 
without 
introducing 
the 
least 
syllable, 
in 
favour 
of

four 
hours; 
and 
this 
likewise 
from 
West 
to 
East: 
though 
aboutan 
Axis 
somewhatinclined, 
and 
notequidistantfrom 
thatof 
the 
Annual 
conversion. 
From 
the 
mixture 
of 
these 
two 
motions, 
each 
of 
it 
self 
uniform, 
I 
say, 
that 
there 
doth 
result 
an 
uneven 
and 
deformed 
motion 
in 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Earth. 
Which, 
that 
it 
may 
the 
more 
easily 
be 
understood, 
I 
will 
explain, 
by 
drawing 
a 
Scheme 
thereof. 
And 
first, 
about 
the 
centre 
A 
[in 
Fig. 
1. 
of 
this 
Dialogue] 
I 
will 
describe 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
Grand 
Orb 
B 
C, 
The 
parts 
of 
a 
Circle 
regularly 
moved 
about 
its 
own 
centre 
move 
in 
divers 
times 
with 
contrary 
motions. 
in 
which 
any 
point 
being 
taken, 
as 
B, 
about 
it 
as 
a 
centre 
wewilldescribethis 
lesser 
circle 
D 
E 
F 
G,representing 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe; 
the 
which 
we 
will 
suppose 
to 
run 
thorow 
the 
whole 
circumference 
of 
the 
Grand 
Orb, 
with 
its 
centre 
B, 
from 
the 
West 
towards 
the 
East, 
that 
is, 
from 
the 
part 
B 
towards 
C; 
and 
moreover 
we 
will 
suppose 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
to 
turn 
about 
its 
own 
centre 
B 
likewise 
from 
West 
to 
East, 
that 
is, 
according 
to 
the 
succession 
of 
the 
points 
D 
E 
F 
G, 
in 
the 
space 
of 
twenty 
four 
hours. 
But 
here 
we 
ought 
carefully 
to 
note, 
that 
a 
circle 
turning 
round 
upon 
its 
own 
centre, 
each 
part 
of 
it 
must, 
at 
different 
times, 
move 
with 
contrary 
motions: 
the 
which 
is 
manifest, 
considering 
that 
whilst 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
circumference, 
about 
the 
point 
D 
move 
to 
the 
left 
hand, 
that 
is, 
towards 
E, 
the 
opposite 
parts 
that 
are 
about 
F, 
approach 
to 
the 
right 
hand, 
that 
is, 
towards 
G; 
so 
that 
when 
the 
parts 
D 
shall 
be 
in 
F, 
their 
motion 
shall 
be 
contrary 
to 
what 
it 
was 
before. 
when 
it 
was 
in 
D. 
Furthermore, 
the 
same 
time 
that 
the 
parts 
E 
descend, 
if 
I 
may 
so 
speak, 
towards 
F, 
those 
in 
G 
ascend 
towards 
D. 
It 
being 
therefore 
presupposed, 
that 
there 
are 
such 
contrarieties 
of 
motions 
in 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Surface, 
The 
mixture 
of 
the 
two 
motions 
annnal 
and 
diurnal, 
causeth 
the 
inequality 
in 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
terrestrial 
Globe. 
whilst 
it 
turneth 
round 
upon 
its 
own 
centre, 
it 
is 
necessary, 
that 
in 
conjoyning 
this 
Diurnal 
Motion, 
with 
the 
other 
Annual, 
there 
do 
result 
an 
absolute 
motion 
for 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
said 
Terrestrial 
Superficies, 
one 
while 
very 
accelerate, 
and 
another 
while 
as 
slow 
again. 
The 
which 
is 
manifest, 
considering 
first 
the 
parts 
about 
D, 
the 
absolute 
motion 
of 
which 
shall 
be 
extream 
swift, 
as 
that 
which 
proceedeth 
from 
two 
motions 
made 
both 
one 
way, 
namely, 
towards 
the 
left 
hand; 
the 
first 
of 
which 
is 
part 
of 
the 
Annual 
Motion, 
common 
to 
all 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Globe, 
the 
other 
is 
that 
of 
the 
said 
point 
D., 
carried 
likewise 
to 
the 
left, 
by 
the 
Diurnal 
Revolution; 
so 
that, 
in 



this 
case, 
the 
Diurnal 
motion 
increaseth 
and 
accelerateth 
the 
Annual. 
The 
contrary 
to 
which 
happeneth 
in 
the 
opposite 
part 
F, 
which, 
whilst 
it 
is 
by 
the 
common 
annual 
motion 
carried, 
together 
with 
the 
whole 
Globe, 
towards 
the 
left, 
it 
happeneth 
to 
be 
carried 
by 
the 
Diurnal 
conversion 
also 
towards 
the 
right: 
so 
that 
the 
Diurnal 
motion 
by 
that 
means 
detracteth 
from 
the 
Annual, 
whereupon 
the 
absolute 
motion, 
resulting 
from 
the 
composition 
of 
both 
the 
other, 
is 
much 
retarded. 
Again, 
about 
the 
points 
E 
and 
G, 
the 
absolute 
motion 
becometh 
in 
a 
manner 
equal 
to 
the 
simple 
Annual 
one, 
in 
regard 
that 
little 
or 
nothing 
increaseth 
or 
diminisheth 
it, 
as 
not 
tending 
either 
to 
the 
left 
hand, 
or 
to 
the 
right, 
but 
downwards 
and 
upwards. 
We 
will 
conclude 
therefore, 
that 
like 
as 
it 
is 
true, 
that 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
whole 
Globe, 
and 
of 
each 
of 
its 
parts, 
would 
be 
equal 
and 
uniforme, 
in 
case 
they 
did 
move 
with 
one 
single 
motion, 
whether 
it 
were 
the 
meer 
Annual, 
or 
the 
single 
Diurnal 
Revolution, 
so 
it 
is 
requisite, 
that 
mixing 
those 
two 
motions 
together, 
there 
do 
result 
thence 
for 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
said 
Globe 
irregular 
motions, 
one 
while 
accelerated, 
and 
another 
while 
retarded, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
additions 
or 
substractions 
of 
the 
Diurnal 
conversion 
from 
the 
annual 
circulation. 
So 
that, 
if 
it 
be 
true 
(and 
most 
true 
it 
is, 
as 
experience 
proves) 
that 
the 
acceleration 
and 
retardation 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Vessel, 
makes 
water 
contained 
therein 
to 
run 
to 
and 
again 
the 
long 
wayes 
of 
it, 
and 
to 
rise 
and 
fall 
in 
its 
extreames, 
who 
will 
make 
scruple 
of 
granting, 
that 
the 
said 
effect 
may, 
nay 
ought 
to 
succeed 
in 
the 
Seawaters, 
contained 
within 
their 
Vessels, 
subject 
to 
such 
like 
alterations, 
and 
especially 
in 
those 
that 
distend 
themselves 
long-wayes 
from 
West 
to 
East, 
which 
is 
the 
course 
that 
the 
motion 
of 
those 
same 
Vessels 
steereth?The 
most 
potent 
and 
primary 
cause 
of 
the 
ebbing 
and 
flowing. 
Now 
this 
is 
the 
most 
potent 
and 
primary 
cause 
of 
the 
ebbing 
and 
flowing, 
without 
the 
which 
no 
such 
effect 
would 
ensue. 
But 
because 
the 
particular 
accidents 
are 
many 
and 
various, 
that 
in 
several 
places 
and 
times 
are 
observed, 
which 
must 
of 
necessity 
have 
dependance 
on 
other 
different 
concomitant 
causes, 
although 
they 
ought 
all 
to 
have 
connexion 
with 
the 
primary; 
therefore 
it 
is 
convenient 
that 
we 
propoundand 
examinetheseveralaccidentsthat 
maybethecauses 
of 
suchdifferenteffects. 


The 
first 
of

is, 
Sundry 
accidents

&

Thefirstaccident. 
thatwheneverthewater,bymeansofanotableretardation 
or 
acceleration 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Vessel, 
its 
container, 
shall 
have 
acquired 
a 
cause 
of 
running 
towards 
this 
or 
that 
extream, 
The 
Water 
raised 
in 
one 
end 



of 
the 
Vessel 
returneth 
of 
its 
self 
to 
Aequilibrium. 
and 
shall 
be 
raised 
in 
the 
one, 
and 
abated 
in 
the 
other, 
it 
shall 
not 
neverthelesse 
continue, 
for 
any 
time 
in 
that 
state, 
when 
once 
the 
primary 
cause 
is 
ceased: 
but 
by 
vertue 
of 
its 
own 
gravity 
and 
natural 
inclination 
to 
level 
and 
grow, 
even 
it 
shall 
speedily 
return 
backwards 
of 
its 
own 
accord, 
and, 
as 
being 
grave 
and 
fluid, 
shall 
not 
only 
move 
towards 
Aequilibrium; 
but 
being 
impelled 
by 
its 
own 
impetus, 
shall 
go 
beyond 
it, 
rising 
in 
the 
part, 
where 
before 
it 
was 
lowest; 
nor 
shall 
it 
stay 
here, 
but 
returning 
backwards 
anew, 
with 
more 
reiterated 
reciprocations 
of 
its 
undulations, 
it 
shall 
give 
us 
to 
know, 
that 
it 
will 
not 
from 
a 
velocity 
of 
motion, 
once 
conceived, 
reduce 
it 
self, 
in 
an 
instant, 
to 
the 
privation 
thereof, 
and 
to 
thestate 
of 
rest, 
butwill 
successively, 
bydecreasingalittle 
and 
a 
little, 
reduce 
it 
self 
unto 
the 
same, 
just 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
we 
see 
a 
weight 
hanging 
at 
a 
cord, 
after 
it 
hath 
been 
once 
removed 
from 
its 
state 
of 
rest, 
that 
is, 
from 
its 
perpendicularity, 
of 
its 
own 
accord, 
to 
return 
thither 
and 
settle 
it 
self, 
but 
not 
till 
such 
time 
as 
it 
shall 
have 
often 
past 
to 
one 
side, 
and 
to 
the 
other,with 
itsreciprocallvibrations. 


The 
second 
accident 
to 
be 
observed 
is, 
In 
the 
shorter 
Vessels 
the 
undulations 
of 
waters 
are 
more 
frequent. 
that 
the 
before-declared 
reciprocationsof 
motion 
come 
to 
be 
made 
and 
repeated 
with 
greater 
or 
lesser 
frequency, 
that 
is, 
under 
shorter 
or 
longer 
times, 
according 
to 
the 
different 
lengths 
of 
the 
Vessels 
containing 
the 
waters; 
so 
that 
in 
the 
shorter 
spaces 
the 
reciprocations 
are 
more 
frequent, 
and 
in 
the 
longer 
more 
rare: 
just 
as 
in 
the 
former 
example 
of 
pendent 
bodies, 
the 
vibrations 
of 
those 
that 
are 
hanged 
to 
longer 
cords 
are 
seento 
belessefrequent,thanthoseof 
themthathangatshorterstrings. 


And 
here, 
The 
greater 
profundity 
maketh 
the 
undulations 
of 
waters 
more 
frequent. 
for 
a 
third 
observation, 
it 
is 
to 
be 
noted, 
that 
not 
onely 
the 
greater 
or 
lesser 
length 
of 
the 
Vessel 
is 
a 
cause 
that 
the 
water 
maketh 
its 
reciprocations 
under 
different 
times; 
but 
the 
greater 
or 
lesser 
profundity 
worketh 
the 
same 
effect. 
And 
it 
happeneth, 
that 
of 
waters 
contained 
in 
receptacles 
of 
equall 
length, 
but 
of 
unequal 
depth, 
that 
which 
shall 
be 
the 
deepest, 
maketh 
its 
undulations 
under 
shorter 
times, 
and 
the 
reciprocations 
of 
the 
shallower 
watersarelessefrequent. 


Fourthly, 
there 
are 
two 
effects 
worthy 
to 
be 
noted, 
and 
diligently 
observed, 
which 
the 
water 
worketh 
in 
those 
its 
vibrations; 
the 
one 
is 
its 
rising 
and 



falling 
alternately 
towards 
the 
one 
and 
other 
extremity; 
Water 
riseth 
& 
falleth 
in 
the 
extream 
parts 
of 
the 
Vessel, 
and 
runneth 
to 
and 
fro 
in 
the 
midst. 
the 
other 
is 
its 
moving 
and 
running, 
to 
so 
speak, 
Horizontally 
forwards 
and 
backwards. 
Which 
two 
different 
motions 
differently 
reside 
in 
divers 
parts 
of 
the 
Water: 
for 
its 
extream 
parts 
are 
those 
which 
most 
eminently 
rise 
and 
fall; 
those 
in 
the 
middle 
never 
absolutely 
moving 
upwards, 
and 
downwards; 
of 
the 
rest 
successively 
those 
that 
are 
neerest 
to 
the 
extreams 
rise 
and 
fall 
proportionally 
more 
than 
the 
remote: 
but 
on 
the 
contrary, 
touching 
the 
other 
progressive 
motion 
forwards 
and 
backwards, 
the 
middle 
parts 
move 
notably, 
going 
and 
returning, 
and 
the 
waters 
that 
are 
in 
the 
extream 
parts 
gain 
no 
ground 
at 
all; 
save 
onely 
in 
case 
that 
in 
their 
rising 
they 
overflow 
their 
banks, 
and 
break 
forth 
of 
their 
first 
channel 
and 
receptacle; 
but 
where 
there 
is 
the 
obstacle 
of 
banks 
to 
keep 
them 
in, 
they 
onely 
rise 
and 
fall; 
which 
yet 
hindereth 
not 
the 
waters 
in 
the 
middle 
from 
fluctuating 
to 
and 
again; 
which 
likewise 
the 
other 
parts 
do 
in 
proportion, 
undulating 
more 
or 
lesse, 
according 
asthey 
are 
neererormoreremotefromthemiddle. 


The 
fifth 
particular 
accident 
ought 
the 
more 
attentively 
to 
be 
considered, 
An 
accident 
of 
the 
Earths 
motions 
impossible 
to 
be 
reduced 
to 
practice 
by 
art. 
in 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
represent 
the 
effect 
thereof 
by 
an 
experiment 
or 
example; 
and 
the 
accident 
is 
this. 
In 
the 
vessels 
by 
us 
framed 
with 
art, 
and 
moved, 
as 
the 
abovenamed 
Bark, 
one 
while 
more, 
and 
another 
while 
lesse 
swiftly, 
the 
acceleration 
and 
retardation 
is 
imparted 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
to 
all 
the 
vessel, 
and 
to 
every 
part 
of 
it; 
so 
that 
whilst 
v. 
g. 
the 
Bark 
forbeareth 
to 
move, 
the 
parts 
precedent 
retard 
no 
more 
than 
the 
subsequent, 
but 
all 
equally 
partake 
of 
the 
same 
retardment; 
and 
the 
self-same 
holds 
true 
of 
the 
acceleration, 
namely, 
that 
conferring 
on 
the 
Bark 
a 
new 
cause 
of 
greater 
velocity, 
the 
Prow 
and 
Poop 
both 
accelerate 
in 
one 
and 
the 
same 
manner. 
But 
in 
huge 
great 
vessels, 
such 
as 
are 
the 
very 
long 
bottomes 
of 
Seas, 
albeit 
they 
also 
are 
no 
other 
than 
certain 
cavities 
made 
in 
the 
solidity 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe, 
it 
alwayes 
admirably 
happeneth, 
that 
their 
extreams 
do 
not 
unitedly 
equall, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
moments 
of 
time 
increase 
and 
diminish 
their 
motion, 
but 
it 
happeneth 
that 
when 
one 
of 
its 
extreames 
hath, 
by 
vertue 
of 
the 
commixtion 
of 
the 
two 
Motions, 
Diurnal, 
and 
Annual, 
greatly 
retarded 
its 
velocity, 
the 
other 
extream 
is 
animated 
with 
an 
extream 
swift 
motion. 
Which 
for 
the 
better 
understanding 
of 
it 
we 
will 
explain, 
reassuming 
a 
Scheme 
like 
to 
the 
former; 
in 
which 
if 
we 
do 
but 
suppose 
a 
tract 
of 
Sea 
to 
be 
long, 
v. 
g. 
a 



fourth 
part, 
as 
is 
the 
arch 
B 
C 
[in 
Fig. 
2. 
] 
because 
the 
parts 
B 
are, 
as 
hath 
been 
already 
declared, 
very 
swift 
in 
motion, 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
union 
of 
the 
two 
motions 
diurnal 
and 
annual, 
towards 
one 
and 
the 
same 
way, 
but 
the 
part 
C 
at 
the 
same 
time 
is 
retarded 
in 
its 
motion, 
as 
being 
deprived 
of 
the 
progression 
dependant 
on 
the 
diurnal 
motion: 
If 
we 
suppose, 
I 
say, 
a 
tract 
of 
Sea 
as 
long 
as 
the 
arch 
B 
C, 
we 
have 
already 
seen, 
that 
its 
extreams 
shall 
move 
in 
the 
same 
time 
with 
great 
inequality. 
And 
extreamly 
different 
would 
the 
velocities 
of 
a 
tract 
of 
Sea 
be 
that 
is 
in 
length 
a 
semicircle, 
and 
placed 
in 
the 
position 
B 
C 
D, 
in 
regard 
that 
the 
extream 
B 
would 
be 
in 
a 
most 
accelerate 
motion, 
and 
the 
other 
D, 
in 
a 
most 
slow 
one; 
and 
the 
intermediate 
parts 
towards 
C, 
would 
be 
in 
a 
moderate 
motion. 
And 
according 
as 
the 
said 
tracts 
of 
Sea 
shall 
be 
shorter, 
they 
shall 
lesse 
participate 
of 
this 
extravagant 
accident, 
of 
being 
in 
some 
hours 
of 
the 
day 
with 
their 
parts 
diversly 
affected 
by 
velocity 
and 
tardity 
of 
motion. 
So 
that, 
if, 
as 
in 
the 
first 
case, 
we 
see 
by 
experience 
that 
the 
acceleration 
and 
retardation, 
though 
equally 
imparted 
to 
all 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
conteining 
Vessel, 
is 
the 
cause 
that 
the 
water 
contained 
fluctuates 
too 
and 
again, 
what 
may 
we 
think 
would 
happen 
in 
a 
Vessel 
so 
admirably 
disposed, 
that 
retardationand 
accelerationof 
motionisveryunequallycontributedto 
its 
parts? 
Certainly 
we 
must 
needs 
grant 
that 
greater 
and 
more 
wonderful 
causes 
of 
the 
commotions 
in 
the 
Water 
ought 
to 
be 
looked 
for. 
And 
though 
it 
may 
seem 
impossible 
to 
some, 
that 
in 
artificial 
Machines 
and 
Vessels 
we 
should 
be 
able 
to 
experiment 
the 
effects 
of 
such 
an 
accident; 
yet 
neverthelesse 
it 
is 
not 
absolutely 
impossible 
to 
be 
done; 
and 
I 
have 
by 
me 
the 
model 
of 
an 
Engine, 
in 
which 
the 
effect 
of 
these 
admirable 
commixtions 
of 
motions 
may 
be 
particularly 
observed. 
But 
as 
to 
what 
concerns 
our 
present 
purpose, 
that 
which 
you 
may 
have 
hitherto 
comprehended 
with 
your 
imagination 
may 
suffice. 


SAGR. 


I 
for 
my 
own 
particular 
very 
well 
conceive 
that 
this 
admirable 
accident 
ought 
necessarily 
to 
evene 
in 
the 
Straights 
of 
Seas, 
and 
especially 
in 
those 
that 
distend 
themselves 
for 
a 
great 
length 
from 
West 
to 
East; 
namely 
according 
to 
the 
course 
of 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe; 
and 
as 
it 
is 
in 
a 
certain 
manner 
unthought 
of, 
and 
without 
a 
president 
among 
the 
motions 
possible 
to 
be 
made 
by 
us, 
so 
it 
is 
not 
hard 
for 
me 
to 
believe, 
that 
effects 
may 
be 
derived 
fromthesame,whichare

SALV. 


These 
things 
being 
declared, 
it 
is 
time 
that 
we 
proceed 
to 
examine 
the 
particular 
accidents, 
which, 
together 
with 
their 
diversities, 
are 
observed 
by 
experience 
in 
the 
ebbing 
and 
flowing 
of 
the 
waters. 
Reasons 
renewed 
of 
the 
particnlar 
accidents 
observed 
in 
the 
ebbings 
and 
flowings. 
And 
first 
we 
need 
not 
think 
it 
hard 
to 
guesse 
whence 
it 
happeneth, 
that 
in 
Lakes, 
Pooles, 
and 
also 
in 
the 
lesser 
Seas 
there 
is 
no 
notable 
flux 
and 
reflux; 
the 
which 
hath 
two 
very 
solid 
reasons. 
The 
one 
is, 
that 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
shortnesse 
of 
the 
Vessel, 
Second 
causes 
why 
in 
small 
Seas 
and 
in 
Lakes 
there 
are 
no 
ebbings 
and 
flowings. 
in 
its 
acquiring 
in 
several 
hours 
of 
the 
day 
several 
degrees 
of 
velocity, 
they 
are 
with 
very 
little 
difference 
acquired 
by 
all 
its 
parts; 
for 
as 
well 
the 
precedent 
as 
the 
subsequent, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
both 
the 
Eastern 
and 
Western 
parts, 
do 
accelerate 
and 
retard 
almost 
in 
the 
same 
manner; 
and 
withal 
making 
that 
alteration 
by 
little 
and 
little, 
and 
not 
by 
giving 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
conteining 
Vessel 
a 
sudden 
check, 
and 
retardment, 
or 
a 
sudden 
and 
great 
impulse 
or 
acceleration; 
both 
it 
and 
all 
its 
parts, 
come 
to 
be 
gently 
and 
equally 
impressed 
with 
the 
same 
degrees 
of 
velocity; 
from 
which 
uniformity 
it 
followeth, 
that 
also 
the 
conteined 
water 
with 
but 
small 
resistance 
and 
opposition, 
receiveth 
the 
same 
impressions, 
and 
by 
consequence 
doth 
give 
but 
very 
obscure 
signes 
of 
its 
rising 
or 
falling, 
or 
of 
its 
running 
towards 
one 
part 
or 
another. 
The 
which 
effect 
is 
likewise 
manifestly 
to 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
little 
artificial 
Vessels, 
wherein 
the 
contained 
water 
doth 
receive 
the 
self 
same 
impressions 
of 
velocity; 
when 
ever 
the 
acceleration 
and 
retardation 
is 
made 
by 
gentle 
and 
uniform 
proportion. 
But 
in 
the 
Straights 
and 
Bays 
that 
for 
a 
great 
length 
distend 
themselves 
from 
East 
to 
West, 
the 
acceleration 
and 
retardation 
is 
more 
notable 
and 
more 
uneven, 
for 
that 
one 
of 
its 
extreams 
shall 
be 
much 
retarded 
in 
motion, 
and 
the 
other 
shall 
at 
the 
same 
time 
move 
very 
swiftly: 
The 
reciprocal 
libration 
or 
levelling 
of 
the 
water 
proceeding 
from 
the 
impetus 
that 
it 
had 
conceived 
from 
the 
motion 
of 
its 
container. 
The 
which 
libration, 
as 
hath 
been 
noted, 
hath 
its 
undulations 
very 
frequent 
in 
small 
Vessels; 
from 
whence 
ensues, 
that 
though 
there 
do 
reside 
in 
the 
Terrestrial 
motions 
the 
cause 
of 
conferring 
on 
the 
waters 
a 
motion 
onely 
from 
twelve 
hours 
to 
twelve 
hours, 
for 
that 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
conteining 
Vessels 
do 
extreamly 
accelerate 
and 
extreamly 
retard 
but 
once 
every 
day, 
and 
no 
more; 
yet 
neverthelesse 
this 
same 
second 
cause 
depending 
on 
the 
gravity 
of 
the 
water 
which 
striveth 
to 
reduce 
it 
self 
to 
equilibration, 
and 
that 
according 
to 



the 
shortnesse 
of 
the 
Vessel 
hath 
its 
reciprocations 
of 
one, 
two, 
three, 
or 
more 
hours, 
this 
intermixing 
with 
the 
first, 
which 
also 
it 
self 
in 
small 
Vessels 
is 
very 
little, 
it 
becommeth 
upon 
the 
whole 
altogether 
insensible. 
For 
the 
primary 
cause, 
which 
hath 
the 
periods 
of 
twelve 
hours, 
having 
not 
made 
and 
end 
of 
imprinting 
the 
precedent 
commotion, 
it 
is 
overtaken 
and 
opposed 
by 
the 
other 
second, 
dependant 
on 
the 
waters 
own 
weight, 
which 
according 
to 
the 
brevity 
and 
profundity 
of 
the 
Vessel, 
hath 
the 
time 
of 
its 
undulations 
of 
one, 
two, 
three, 
four, 
or 
more 
hours; 
and 
this 
contending 
with 
the 
other 
former 
one, 
disturbeth 
and 
removeth 
it, 
not 
permitting 
it 
to 
come 
to 
the 
height, 
no 
nor 
to 
the 
half 
of 
its 
motion; 
and 
by 
this 
contestation 
the 
evidence 
of 
the 
ebbing 
and 
flowing 
is 
wholly 
annihilated, 
or 
at 
least 
very 
much 
obscured. 
I 
passe 
by 
the 
continual 
alteration 
of 
the 
air, 
which 
disquieting 
the 
water, 
permits 
us 
not 
to 
come 
to 
a 
certainty, 
whether 
any, 
though 
but 
small, 
encrease 
or 
abatement 
of 
half 
an 
inch, 
or 
losse, 
do 
reside 
in 
the 
Straights, 
or 
receptaclesofwaternotaboveadegreeortwoinlength. 


I 
come 
in 
the 
second 
place 
to 
resolve 
the 
question, 
The 
reason 
given, 
why 
the 
ebbings 
and 
flowings, 
for 
the 
most 
part, 
are 
every 
six 
hours. 
why, 
there 
not 
residing 
any 
vertue 
in 
the 
primary 
principle 
of 
commoving 
the 
waters, 
save 
onely 
every 
twelve 
hours, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
once 
by 
the 
greatest 
velocity, 
and 
once 
by 
the 
greatest 
tardity 
of 
motion; 
the 
ebbings 
and 
flowings 
should 
yet 
neverthelesse 
appear 
to 
be 
every 
six 
hours. 
To 
which 
is 
answered, 
that 
this 
determination 
cannot 
any 
wayes 
be 
taken 
from 
the 
primary 
cause 
onely; 
but 
thereisa 
necessity 
ofintroducing 
the 
secondary 
causes, 
as 
namely 
the 
greater 
or 
lesse 
length 
of 
the 
Vessels, 
and 
the 
greater 
or 
lesse 
depth 
of 
the 
waters 
in 
them 
conteined. 
Which 
causes 
although 
they 
have 
not 
any 
operation 
in 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
waters, 
those 
operations 
belonging 
to 
the 
sole 
primary 
cause, 
without 
which 
no 
ebbing 
or 
flowing 
would 
happen, 
yet 
neverthelesse 
they 
have 
a 
principal 
share 
in 
determining 
the 
times 
or 
periods 
of 
the 
reciprocations, 
and 
herein 
their 
influence 
is 
so 
powerful, 
that 
the 
primary 
cause 
must 
of 
force 
give 
way 
unto 
them. 
The 
period 
of 
six 
hours 
therefore 
is 
no 
more 
proper 
or 
natural 
than 
those 
of 
other 
intervals 
of 
times, 
though 
indeed 
its 
the 
most 
observed, 
as 
agreeing 
with 
our 
Mediterrane, 
which 
was 
the 
onely 
Sea 
that 
for 
many 
Ages 
was 
navigated: 
though 
neither 
is 
that 
period 
observed 
in 
all 
its 
parts; 
for 
that 
in 
some 
more 
angust 
places, 
such 
as 
are 
the 
Hellespont, 
and 
the 
Aegean 
Sea, 
the 
periods 
are 
much 
shorter, 
and 
also 
very 
divers 
amongst 
themselves; 
for 
which 
diversities, 
and 
their 
causes 



incomprehensible 
to 
Aristotle, 
some 
say, 
that 
after 
he 
had 
a 
long 
time 
observed 
it 
upon 
some 
cliffes 
of 
Negropont, 
being 
brought 
to 
desperation, 
he 
threw 
himself 
intotheadjoyningEuripus,andvoluntarily 
drownedhimself. 


In 
the 
third 
place 
we 
have 
the 
reason 
ready 
at 
hand, 
The 
cause 
why 
some 
Seas, 
though 
very 
long, 
suffer 
no 
ebbing 
and 
flowing. 
whence 
it 
commeth 
to 
passe, 
that 
some 
Seas, 
although 
very 
long, 
as 
is 
the 
Red 
Sea, 
are 
almost 
altogether 
exempt 
from 
Tides, 
which 
happeneth 
because 
their 
length 
extendeth 
not 
from 
East 
to 
West, 
but 
rather 
transversly 
from 
the 
Southeast 
to 
the 
Northwest; 
but 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
Earth 
going 
from 
West 
to 
East; 
the 
impulses 
of 
the 
water, 
bythatmeans, 
alwayes 
happentofallinthe 
Meridians, 
and 
do 
not 
move 
from 
parallel 
to 
parallel; 
insomuch 
that 
in 
the 
Seas 
that 
extend 
themselves 
athwart 
towards 
the 
Poles, 
and 
that 
the 
contrary 
way 
are 
narrow, 
there 
is 
no 
cause 
of 
ebbing 
and 
flowing, 
save 
onely 
by 
the 
participation 
of 
another 
Sea, 
wherewith 
it 
hath 
communication, 
that 
is 
subject 
togreatcommotions. 


In 
the 
fourth 
place 
we 
shall 
very 
easily 
find 
out 
the 
reason 
why 
the 
fluxes 
and 
refluxes 
are 
greatest, 
Ebbings 
and 
flowings 
why 
greatest 
in 
the 
extremities 
of 
Gulphs, 
and 
least 
in 
the 
middle 
parts. 
as 
to 
the 
waters 
rising 
and 
falling 
in 
the 
utmost 
extremities 
of 
Gulphs, 
and 
least 
in 
the 
intermediate 
parts; 
as 
daily 
experience 
sheweth 
here 
in 
Venice, 
lying 
in 
the 
farther 
end 
of 
the 
Adriatick 
Sea, 
where 
that 
difference 
commonly 
amounts 
to 
five 
or 
six 
feet; 
but 
in 
the 
places 
of 
the 
Mediterrane, 
far 
distant 
from 
the 
extreams, 
that 
mutation 
is 
very 
small, 
as 
in 
the 
Isles 
of 
Corsica 
and 
Sardinnia, 
and 
in 
the 
Strands 
of 
Rome 
and 
Ligorne, 
where 
it 
exceeds 
not 
half 
a 
foot; 
we 
shall 
understand 
also, 
why 
on 
the 
contrary, 
where 
the 
risings 
and 
fallings 
are 
small, 
the 
courses 
and 
recourses 
are 
great: 
I 
say 
it 
is 
an 
easie 
thing 
to 
understand 
the 
causes 
of 
these 
accidents, 
seeing 
that 
we 
meet 
with 
many 
manifest 
occurrences 
of 
the 
same 
nature 
in 
every 
kind 
of 
Vessel 
by 
us 
artificially 
composed, 
in 
which 
the 
same 
effects 
are 
observed 
naturally 
to 
follow 
upon 
our 
moving 
it 
unevenly, 
that 
is, 
one 
while 
faster,andanotherwhileflower. 


Moreover, 
Why 
in 
narrow 
places 
the 
course 
of 
the 
waters 
is 
more 
swift 
than 
in 
larger. 
considering 
in 
the 
fifth 
place, 
that 
the 
same 
quantity 
of 
Water 
being 
moved, 
though 
but 
gently, 
in 
a 
spatious 
Channel, 
comming 
afterwards 
to 
go 
through 
a 
narrow 
passage, 
will 
of 
necessity 
run, 
with 
great 
violence, 
we 
shall 



not 
finde 
it 
hard 
to 
comprehend 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
great 
Currents 
that 
are 
made 
in 
the 
narrow 
Channel 
that 
separateth 
Calabria 
from 
Sicilia: 
for 
that 
all 
the 
Waters 
that, 
by 
the 
spaciousnesse 
of 
the 
Isle, 
and 
by 
the 
Ionick 
Gulph, 
happens 
to 
be 
pent 
in 
the 
Eastern 
part 
of 
the 
Sea, 
though 
it 
do 
in 
that, 
by 
reason 
of 
its 
largeness, 
gently 
descend 
towards 
the 
West, 
yetneverthelesse,in 
that 
it 
is 
pent 
up 
in 
the 
Bosphorus, 
it 
floweth 
with 
great 
violence 
between 
Scilla 
and 
Caribdis, 
and 
maketh 
a 
great 
agitation. 
Like 
to 
which, 
and 
much 
greater, 
is 
said 
to 
be 
betwixt 
Africa 
and 
the 
great 
Isle 
of 
St. 
Lorenzo, 
where 
the 
Waters 
of 
the 
two 
vast 
Seas, 
Indian 
and 
Ethiopick, 
that 
lie 
round 
it, 
must 
needs 
be 
straightned 
into 
a 
lesse 
Channel 
between 
the 
said 
Isle 
and 
the 
Ethiopian 
Coast. 
And 
the 
Currents 
must 
needs 
be 
very 
great 
in 
the 
Straights 
of 
Megallanes, 
which 
joyne 
together 
the 
vast 
Oceans 
of 
Ethiopia, 
and 
Del 
Zur,calledalsothePacifickSea. 


It 
follows 
now, 
in 
the 
sixth 
place, 
A 
discussion 
of 
abstruce 
obse 
ved 
ebbing 
and 
wing. 
that 
to 
render 
a 
reason 
of 
some 
more 
abstruse 
and 
incredible 
accidents, 
which 
are 
observed 
upon 
this 
occasion, 
we 
make 
a 
considerable 
reflection 
upon 
the 
two 
principal 
causes 
of 
ebbings 
and 
flowings, 
afterwards 
compounding 
and 
mixing 
them 
together. 
The 
first 
and 
simplest 
of 
which 
is 
(as 
hath 
often 
been 
said) 
the 
determinate 
acceleration 
and 
retardation 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Earth, 
from 
whence 
the 
Waters 
have 
a 
determinate 
period 
put 
to 
their 
decursions 
towards 
the 
East, 
and 
return 
towards 
the 
West, 
in 
the 
time 
of 
twenty 
four 
hours. 
The 
other 
is 
that 
which 
dependeth 
on 
the 
proper 
gravity 
of 
the 
Water, 
which 
being 
once 
commoved 
by 
the 
primary 
cause, 
seeketh, 
in 
the 
next 
place, 
to 
reduce 
it 
self 
to 
Aequilibrium, 
with 
iterated 
reciprocations; 
which 
are 
not 
determined 
by 
one 
sole 
and 
prefixed 
time; 
but 
have 
as 
many 
varieties 
of 
times 
as 
are 
the 
different 
lengths 
and 
profundities 
of 
the 
receptacles, 
and 
Straights 
of 
Seas; 
and 
by 
what 
dependeth 
on 
this 
second 
principle, 
they 
would 
ebbe 
and 
flow, 
some 
in 
one 
hour, 
others 
in 
two, 
in 
four, 
in 
six, 
in 
eight, 
in 
ten, 
&c. 
Now 
if 
we 
begin 
to 
put 
together 
the 
first 
cause, 
which 
hath 
its 
set 
Period 
from 
twelve 
hours 
to 
twelve 
hours, 
with 
some 
one 
of 
the 
secondary, 
that 
hath 
its 
Period 
verb. 
grat. 
from 
five 
hours 
to 
five 
hours, 
it 
would 
come 
to 
passe, 
that 
at 
sometimes 
the 
primary 
cause 
and 
secondary 
would 
accord 
to 
make 
impulses 
both 
one 
the 
same 
way; 
and 
in 
this 
concurrency, 
and 
(as 
one 
may 
call 
it) 
unanimous 
conspiration 
the 
flowings 
shall 
be 
great. 
At 
other 
times 
it 
happening 
that 
the 
primary 
impulse 
doth, 
in 
a 
certain 
manner, 
oppose 
that 
which 
the 
secondary 
Period 
would 
make, 
and 
in 



this 
contest 
one 
of 
the 
Principles 
being 
taken 
away, 
that 
which 
the 
other 
would 
give, 
will 
weaken 
the 
commotion 
of 
the 
Waters, 
and 
the 
Sea 
will 
return 
to 
a 
very 
tranquil 
State, 
and 
almost 
immoveable. 
And 
at 
other 
times, 
according 
as 
the 
two 
aforesaid 
Principles 
shall 
neither 
altogether 
contest, 
nor 
altogether 
concur, 
there 
shall 
be 
other 
kinds 
of 
alterations 
made 
in 
the 
increase 
and 
diminution 
of 
the 
ebbing 
and 
flowing. 
It 
may 
likewise 
fall 
out 
that 
two 
Seas, 
considerably 
great 
and 
which 
communicate 
by 
some 
narrow 
Channel, 
may 
chance 
to 
have, 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
mixtion 
of 
the 
two 
Principles 
of 
motion, 
one 
cause 
to 
flow 
at 
the 
time 
that 
the 
other 
hath 
cause 
to 
move 
a 
contrary 
way; 
in 
which 
case 
in 
the 
Channel, 
whereby 
they 
disimbogue 
themselves 
into 
each 
other, 
there 
do 
extraordinary 
conturbations 
insue, 
with 
opposite 
and 
vortick 
motions, 
and 
most 
dangerous 
boilings 
and 
breakings, 
as 
frequent 
relations 
and 
experiences 
do 
assure 
us. 
From 
such 
like 
discordant 
motions, 
dependent 
not 
onely 
on 
the 
different 
positions 
and 
longitudes, 
but 
very 
much 
also 
upon 
the 
different 
profundities 
of 
the 
Seas, 
which 
have 
the 
said 
intercourse 
there 
do 
happen 
at 
sometimes 
different 
commotions 
in 
the 
Waters, 
irregular, 
and 
that 
can 
be 
reduced 
to 
no 
rules 
of 
observation, 
the 
reasons 
of 
which 
have 
much 
troubled, 
and 
alwayes 
do 
trouble 
Mariners, 
for 
that 
they 
meet 
with 
them 
without 
seeing 
either 
impulse 
of 
winds, 
or 
other 
eminent 
aereal 
alteration 
that 
might 
occasion 
the 
same; 
of 
which 
disturbance 
of 
the 
Air 
we 
ought 
to 
make 
great 
account 
in 
other 
accidents, 
and 
to 
take 
it 
fora 
third 
andaccidentalcause, 
able 
to 
alter 
very 
much 
theobservation 
of 
the 
effects 
depending 
on 
the 
secondaryand 
more 
essential 
causes. 
And 
itis 
not 
to 
be 
doubted, 
but 
that 
impetuous 
windes, 
continuing 
to 
blow, 
for 
example, 
from 
the 
East, 
they 
shall 
retein 
the 
Waters 
and 
prohibit 
the 
reflux 
or 
ebbing; 
whereupon 
the 
second 
and 
third 
reply 
of 
the 
flux 
or 
tide 
overtaking 
the 
former, 
at 
the 
hours 
prefixed, 
they 
will 
swell 
very 
high; 
and 
being 
thus 
born 
up 
for 
some 
dayes, 
by 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
Winds, 
they 
shall 
rise 
more 
than 
usual,makingextraordinary 
inundations. 


We 
ought 
also, 
(and 
this 
shall 
serve 
for 
a 
seventh 
Probleme) 
to 
take 
notice 
of 
another 
cause 
of 
motion 
dependant 
on 
the 
great 
abundance 
of 
the 
Waters 
of 
great 
Rivers 
that 
discharge 
themselves 
into 
Seas 
of 
no 
great 
capacity, 
The 
cause 
why, 
in 
some 
narrow 
Channels, 
we 
see 
the 
Sea-waters 
run 
alwayes 
one 
way. 
whereupon 
in 
the 
Straits 
or 
Bosphori 
that 
communicate 
with 
those 
Seas, 
the 
Waters 
are 
seen 
to 
run 
always 
one 
way: 
as 
it 
happeneth 
in 
the 
Thracian 
Bosphorus 
below 
Constantinople, 
where 
the 
water 
alwayes 
runneth 
from 
the 



Black-Sea, 
towards 
the 
Propontis: 
For 
in 
the 
said 
Black-Sea 
by 
reason 
of 
its 
shortnesse, 
the 
principal 
causes 
of 
ebbing 
and 
flowing 
are 
but 
of 
small 
force. 
But, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
very 
great 
Rivers 
falling 
into 
the 
same, 
those 
huge 
defluxions 
of 
water 
being 
to 
passe 
and 
disgorge 
themselves 
by 
the 
the 
straight, 
theOr 
current. 
course 
is 
there 
very 
notable 
and 
alwayes 
towards 
the 
South. 
Where 
moreover 
we 
ought 
to 
take 
notice, 
that 
the 
said 
Straight 
or 
Channel, 
albeit 
very 
narrow, 
is 
not 
subject 
to 
perturbations, 
as 
the 
Straight 
of 
Scilla 
andCarybdis;forthatthathaththeBlack-SeaabovetowardstheNorth, 
and 
the 
Propontis, 
the 
Aegean, 
and 
the 
Mediterranean 
Seas 
joyned 
unto 
it, 
though 
by 
a 
long 
tract 
towards 
the 
South; 
but 
now, 
as 
we 
have 
observed, 
the 
Seas, 
though 
of 
never 
so 
great 
length, 
lying 
North 
and 
South, 
are 
not 
much 
subject 
to 
ebbings 
and 
flowings; 
but 
because 
the 
Sicilian 
Straight 
is 
situate 
between 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Mediterrane 
distended 
for 
a 
long 
tract 
or 
distance 
from 
West 
to 
East, 
that 
is, 
according 
to 
the 
course 
of 
the 
fluxes 
and 
refluxes; 
therefore 
in 
this 
the 
agitations 
are 
very 
great; 
and 
would 
be 
much 
more 
violent 
between 
Hercules 
Pillars, 
in 
case 
the 
Straight 
of 
Gibraltar 
did 
open 
lesse; 
and 
those 
of 
the 
Straight 
of 
Magellanes 
are 
reported 
to 
be 
extraordinary 
violent. 


This 
is 
what, 
for 
the 
present, 
cometh 
into 
my 
mind 
to 
say 
unto 
you 
about 
the 
causes 
of 
this 
first 
period 
diurnal 
of 
the 
Tide, 
and 
its 
various 
accidents, 
touching 
which, 
if 
you 
have 
any 
thing 
to 
offer, 
you 
may 
let 
us 
hear 
it, 
that 
so 
wemayafterwardsproceed

SIMP. 


In 
my 
opinion, 
it 
cannot 
be 
denied, 
but 
that 
your 
discourse 
carrieth 
with 
it 
much 
of 
probability, 
arguing, 
as 
we 
say, 
ex 
suppositione, 
namely, 
granting 
that 
the 
Earth 
moveth 
with 
the 
two 
motions 
assigned 
it 
by 
Copernicus: 
The 
Hypothesis 
of 
the 
Earths 
mobility 
taken 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
Tide, 
opposed. 
but 
if 
that 
motion 
be 
disproved, 
all 
that 
you 
have 
said 
is 
vain, 
and 
insignificant: 
and 
for 
the 
disproval 
of 
that 
Hypothesis, 
it 
is 
very 
manifestly 
hinted 
by 
your 
Discourse 
it 
self. 
You, 
with 
the 
supposition 
of 
the 
two 
Terrestrial 
motions, 
give 
a 
reason 
of 
the 
ebbing 
and 
flowing; 
and 
then 
again, 
arguing 
circularly, 
from 
the 
ebbing 
and 
flowing, 
draw 
the 
reason 
and 
confirmation 
of 
those 
very 
motions; 
and 
so 
proceeding 
to 
a 
more 
specious 
Discourse, 
you 
say 
that 
the 
Water, 
as 
being 
a 
fluid 
body, 
and 
not 
tenaciously 
annexed 
to 
the 
Earth, 
is 
not 



constrained 
punctually 
to 
obey 
every 
of 
its 
motions, 
from 
which 
you 
afterwards 
infer 
its 
ebbing 
and 
flowing, 
Now 
I, 
according 
to 
your 
own 
method, 
argue 
the 
quite 
contrary, 
and 
say; 
the 
Air 
is 
much 
more 
tenuous, 
and 
fluid 
than 
the 
Water, 
and 
lesse 
annexed 
to 
the 
Earths 
superficies, 
to 
which 
the 
Water, 
if 
it 
be 
for 
nothing 
else, 
yet 
by 
reason 
of 
its 
gravity 
that 
presseth 
down 
upon 
the 
same 
more 
than 
the 
light 
Air, 
adhereth; 
therefore 
the 
Air 
is 
much 
obliged 
to 
follow 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
Earth: 
and 
therefore 
were 
it 
so, 
that 
the 
Earth 
did 
move 
in 
that 
manner, 
we 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
it, 
and 
carried 
round 
with 
like 
velocity 
by 
it, 
ought 
perpetually 
to 
feel 
a 
Winde 
from 
the 
East 
that 
beateth 
upon 
us 
with 
intolerable 
force. 
And 
that 
so 
it 
ought 
to 
fall 
out, 
quotidian 
experience 
assureth 
us: 
for 
if 
with 
onely 
riding 
post, 
at 
the 
speed 
of 
eight 
or 
ten 
miles 
an 
hour 
in 
the 
tranquil 
Air, 
the 
incountering 
of 
it 
with 
our 
face 
seemeth 
to 
us 
a 
Winde 
that 
doth 
not 
lightly 
blow 
upon 
us, 
what 
should 
we 
expect 
from 
our 
rapid 
course 
of 
800. 
or 
a 
thousand 
miles 
an 
hour, 
against 
the 
Air, 
that 
is, 
free 
from 
that 
motion? 
And 
yet, 
notwithstanding 
we 
cannot 
perceiveanythingof 
thatnature. 


SALV. 


To 
this 
objection 
that 
hath 
much 
of 
likelihood 
in 
it, 
The 
answer 
to 
the 
objections 
made 
against 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe. 
I 
reply, 
that 
its 
true, 
the 
Air 
is 
of 
greater 
tenuity 
and 
levity; 
and, 
by 
reason 
of 
its 
levity, 
lesse 
adherent 
to 
the 
Earth 
than 
Water 
so 
much 
more 
grave 
andCorpulenta 
bulky; 
but 
yet 
the 
consequence 
is 
false 
that 
you 
infer 
from 
these 
qualities; 
namely, 
that 
upon 
account 
of 
that 
its 
levity, 
tenuity, 
and 
lesse 
adherence 
to 
the 
Earth, 
it 
should 
be 
more 
exempt 
than 
the 
Water 
from 
following 
the 
Terrestrial 
Motions; 
so 
as 
that 
to 
us, 
who 
absolutely 
pertake 
of 
of 
them, 
the 
said 
exemption 
should 
be 
sensible 
and 
manifest; 
nay, 
it 
happeneth 
quite 
contrary; 
for, 
if 
you 
well 
remember, 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
ebbing 
and 
flowing 
of 
the 
Water 
assigned 
by 
us, 
consisteth 
in 
the 
Waters 
not 
following 
the 
unevennesse 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
its 
Vessel, 
but 
retaining 
the 
impetus 
conceived 
before, 
without 
diminishing 
or 
increasing 
it 
according 
to 
the 
precise 
rate 
of 
its 
diminishing 
or 
increasing 
in 
its 
Vessel. 
Because 
therefore 
that

and 
retentionof 
the

or

ofmotionconsisteth,thatmoveablethat 
shallbemostaptforsuch 
a

shall 
be 
also 
most 
commodious 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
effect 
that 



followeth 
in 
consequence 
of 
that 
retention. 
Now 
how 
much 
the 
Water 
is 
disposed 
to 
maintain 
such 
a 
conceived 
agitation; 
though 
the 
causes 
cease 
that 
impress 
the 
same, 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
Seas 
extreamly 
disturbed 
by 
impetuous 
Winds 
sheweth 
us; 
the 
Billows 
of 
which, 
though 
the 
Air 
be 
grown 
calm, 
and 
the 
Wind 
laid, 
for 
a 
long 
time 
after 
continue 
in 
motion: 
As 
the 
SacredPoet 
pleasantlysings, 
‘Quall’altoEgeo, 
&c.—’ 


And 
that 
long 
continuing 
rough 
after 
a 
storm,

to 
be

than 
heavy, 
but 
less 
apt 
to 
conserve 
the 
motion. 
dependeth 
on 
the 
gravity 
of 
the 
water: 
For, 
as 
I 
have 
elsewhere 
said, 
light 
bodies 
are 
much 
easier 
to 
be 
moved 
than 
the 
more 
grave, 
but 
yet 
are 
so 
much 
the 
less 
apt 
to 
conserve 
the 
motion 
imparted, 
when 
once 
the 
moving 
cause 
ceaseth. 
Whence 
it 
comes 
that 
the 
Aire, 
as 
being 
of 
it 
self 
very 
light 
and 
thin, 
is 
easily 
mov’d 
by 
any 
verysmall 
force,yet 
itiswithall 
very 
unabletohold 
on

Therefore, 
as 
to 
the 
Aire 
which 
environs 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe,I 
would 
fay, 
that

reason

then 
the 
Water; 
and 
especially 
that 
part 
which 
is

in

which 
vessels 
are

enclosed 
with

And 
we 
may 
with 
much 
more 
reason 
affirm 
that 
this 
same 
part 
of 
the 
Air 
is 
carried 
round, 
and 
born 
forwards 
by 
the 
rugged 
parts 
of 
the 
Earth, 
than 
that 
the

is 
whirl’d 
about 
by 
the

of

What 
hath 
been 
hitherto 
spoken, 
seems 
to 
me 
a 
sufficient 
answer 
to 
the 
allegation 
of 
Simplitius; 
The 
revolution 
of 
the 
Earth 
confirmed 
by 
a 
new 
argument 
taken 
from 
the 
Air. 
yet 
nevertheless 
with 
a 
new 
instance 
and 
solution, 
founded 
upon 
an 
admirable 
experiment, 
I 
will 
superabundantly 
satisfie 
him, 
and 
confirm 
to 
Sagredus 
the 
mobility 
of 
the 
Earth. 
I 
have 
told 
you 
that 
the 
Air, 
and 
in 
particular 
that 
part 
of 
it 
which 
ascendeth 
not 
above 
the 
tops 
of 
the 
highest 
Mountains, 
is 
carried 
round 
by 
the 
uneven 
parts 
of 
the 
Earths 
surface: 
from 
whence 
it 
should 
seem, 
that 
it 
must 
of 
consequence 
come 
to 
passe, 
that 
in 
case 
the 
superficies 
of 
the 
Earth 
were 
not 
uneven, 
but 
smooth 
and 
plain, 
no 
cause 
would 
remain 
for 
drawing 
the 
Air 
along 
with 
it, 
or 
at 
least 
for 
revolving 
it 
with 
so 
much 
uniformity. 
Now 
the 
surface 
of 
this 
our 
Globe, 
is 
not 
all 
craggy 
and 
rugged, 
but 
there 
are 
exceeding 
great 
tracts 
very 
even, 
to 
wit, 
the 
surfaces 
of 
very 
vast 
Seas, 
which 
being 
also 
far 
remote 



from 
the 
continuate 
ledges 
of 
Mountains 
which 
environ 
it, 
seem 
to 
have 
no 
faculty 
of 
carrying 
the 
super-ambient 
Air 
along 
therewith: 
and 
not 
carrying 
it 
about,wemayperceivewhatwillofconsequence 
ensueinthoseplaces. 


SIMP. 


I 
was 
about 
to 
propose 
the 
very 
same 
difficulty, 
which 
I 
think 
is 
of 
great 
validity. 


SALV. 


You 
say 
very 
well 
Simplicius, 
for 
from 
the 
not 
finding 
in 
the 
Air 
that 
which 
of 
consequence 
would 
follow, 
did 
this 
our 
Globe 
move 
round; 
you 
argue 
its 
immoveablenesse. 
But 
in 
case 
that 
this 
which 
you 
think 
ought 
of 
necessary 
consequence 
to 
be 
found, 
be 
indeed 
by 
experience 
proved 
to 
be 
so; 
will 
you 
accept 
it 
for 
a 
sufficient 
testimony 
and 
an 
argument 
for 
the 
mobility 
of 
the 
said 
Globe? 


SIMP. 


In 
this 
case 
it 
is 
not 
requisite 
to 
argue 
with 
me 
alone, 
for 
if 
it 
should 
so 
fall 
out, 
and 
that 
I 
could 
not 
comprehend 
the 
cause 
thereof, 
yet 
haply 
it 
might 
be 
knownby 
others. 


SALV. 


So 
that 
by 
playing 
with 
you, 
a 
man 
shall 
never 
get, 
but 
be 
alwayes 
on 
the 
losing 
hand; 
and 
therefore 
it 
would 
be 
better 
to 
give 
over: 
Nevertheless, 
that 
we 
may 
not 
cheat 
our 
third 
man 
we 
will 
play 
on. 
We 
said 
even 
now, 
and 
with 
some 
addition 
we 
reitterate 
it, 
that 
the 
Ayr 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
thin 
and 
fluid 
body, 
and 
not 
solidly 
conjoyned 
with 
the 
Earth, 
seem’d 
not 
to 
be 
necessitated 
to 
obey 
its 
motion; 
unlesse 
so 
far 
as 
the 
cragginess 
of 
the 
terrestrial 
superficies, 
transports 
and 
carries 
with 
it 
a 
part 
thereof 
contigious 
thereunto; 
which 
doth 
not 
by 
any 
great 
space 
exceed 
the 
greatest 
altitude 
of 
Mountains: 
the 
which 
portion 
of 
Air 
ought 
to 
be 
so 
much 
less 
repugnant 
to 
the 
terrestrial 
conversion,byhow 
muchitis

fumes, 
and 
exhalations, 
matters 
all 
participating 
of 
terrene 
qualities, 
and 
consequently 
apt 
of 
their 
own 
nature 
to 
the 
same 



motions. 
But 
where 
there 
are 
wanting 
the 
causes 
of 
motion, 
that 
is, 
where 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
Globe 
hath 
great 
levels, 
and 
where 
there 
is 
less 
mixture 
of 
the 
terrene 
vapours, 
there 
the 
cause 
whereby 
the 
ambient 
Air 
is 
constrained 
to 
give 
entire 
obedience 
to 
the 
terrestrial 
conversion 
will 
cease 
in 
part; 
so 
that 
in 
such 
places, 
whilst 
the 
Earth 
revolveth 
towards 
the 
East, 
there 
will 
be 
continually 
a 
wind 
perceived 
which 
will 
beat 
upon 
us, 
blowing 
from 
the 
East 
towards 
the 
West: 
and 
such 
gales 
will 
be 
the 
more 
sensible, 
where 
the 
revolution 
of 
the 
Globe 
is 
most 
swift; 
which 
will 
be 
in 
places 
more 
remote 
from 
the 
Poles, 
and 
approaching 
to 
the 
greatest 
Circle 
of 
the 
diurnal 
conversion. 
But 
now 
de 
facto 
experience 
much 
confirmeth 
this 
Phylosophical 
argumentation; 
for 
in 
the 
spatious 
Seas, 
and 
in 
their 
parts 
most 
remote 
from 
Land, 
and 
situate 
under 
the 
Torrid 
Zone, 
that 
is 
bounded 
by 
the 
Tropicks, 
where 
there 
are 
none 
of 
those 
same 
terrestrial 
evaporations, 
Constant 
gales 
within 
the 
Tropicks 
blow 
towards 
the 
West. 
we 
finde 
a 
perpetual 
gale 
move 
from 
the 
East 
with 
so 
constant 
a 
blast, 
that 
ships 
by 
favour 
thereof 
sail 
prosperously 
to 
the 
West-India’s. 
And 
from 
the 
same 
coasting 
along 
the 
Mexican 
shore, 
they 
with 
the 
same 
felicity 
pass 
the 
Pacifick 
Ocean 
towards 
the 
India’s; 
which 
to 
us 
are 
East, 
but 
to 
them 
are 
West. 
The 
course 
to 
the 
West-India’s 
easie, 
the 
return 
difficult. 
Whereas 
on 
the 
contrary 
the 
Course 
from 
thence 
towards 
the 
East 
is 
difficult 
and 
uncertain, 
and 
not 
to 
be 
made 
by 
the 
same 
Rhumb, 
but 
must 
vere 
more 
to 
Land-ward, 
to 
recover 
other 
Winds, 
which 
we 
may 
call 
accidentary 
and 
tumultuary, 
produced 
from 
other 
Principles, 
as 
those 
that 
inhabit 
the 
continent 
find 
by 
experience. 
Of 
which 
productions 
of 
Winds, 
the 
Causes 
are 
many 
and 
different, 
which 
shall 
not 
at 
this 
time 
be 
mentioned. 
Winds 
from 
Land 
make 
rough 
the 
Seas. 
And 
these 
accidentary 
Winds 
are 
those 
which 
blow 
indifferently 
from 
all 
parts 
of 
the 
Earth, 
and 
make 
rough 
the 
Seas 
remote 
from 
the 
Equinoctial, 
and 
environed 
by 
the 
rugged 
Surface 
of 
the 
Earth; 
which 
is 
as 
much 
as 
to 
say 
environ’d 
with 
those 
perturbations 
of 
Air, 
that 
confound 
that 
primary 
Gale. 
The 
which, 
in 
case 
these 
accidental 
impediments 
were 
removed, 
would 
be 
continually 
felt, 
and 
especially 
upon 
the 
Sea. 
Now 
see 
how 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
Water 
and 
Air 
seem 
wonderfully 
to 
accord 
with 
the 
Celestial 
observations, 
to 
confirm 
the 
mobility 
ofourTerrestrialGlobe. 


SAGR. 



I 
also 
for 
a 
final 
close 
will 
relate 
to 
you 
one 
particular, 
Another 
observation 
taken 
from 
the 
Air 
in 
confirmation 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth. 
which 
as 
I 
believe 
is 
unknown 
unto 
you, 
and 
which 
likewise 
may 
serve 
to 
confirm 
the 
same 
conclusion: 
You 
Salviatus 
alledged, 
That 
Accident 
which 
Sailers 
meet 
with 
between 
the 
Tropicks; 
I 
mean 
that 
perpetual 
Gale 
of 
Winde 
that 
beats 
upon 
them 
from 
the 
East, 
of 
which 
I 
have 
an 
account 
from 
those 
that 
have 
many 
times 
made 
the 
Voyage: 
And 
moreover 
(which 
is 
very 
observable) 
I 
understand 
that 
the 
Mariners 
do 
not 
call 
it 
a 
Wind, 
but 
by 
anotherWhich 
Wind 
with 
our 
English 
Mariners 
is 
called 
the 
Trade-wind. 
name, 
which 
I 
do 
not 
now 
remember, 
taken 
haply 
from 
its 
so 
fixed 
and 
constant 
Tenor; 
which 
when 
they 
have 
met 
with, 
they 
tie 
up 
their 
shrouds 
and 
other 
cordage 
belonging 
to 
the 
Sails, 
and 
without 
any 
more 
need 
of 
touching 
them, 
though 
they 
be 
in 
a 
sleep, 
they 
can 
continue 
their 
course. 
Now 
this 
constant 
Trade-
wind 
was 
known 
to 
be 
such 
by 
its 
continual 
blowing 
without 
interruptions; 
for 
if 
it 
were 
interrupted 
by 
other 
Windes, 
it 
would 
not 
have 
been 
acknowledged 
for 
a 
singular 
Effect, 
and 
different 
from 
the 
rest: 
from 
which 
I 
will 
infer, 
That 
it 
may 
be 
that 
also 
our 
Mediterranean 
Sea 
doth 
partake 
of 
the 
like 
accident; 
but 
it 
is 
not 
observed, 
as 
being 
frequently 
altered 
by 
the 
confluence 
of 
other 
windes. 
And 
this 
I 
say, 
not 
without 
good 
grounds, 
yea 
upon 
very 
probable 
conjectures 
whch 
came 
unto 
my 
knowledge, 
from 
that 
which 
tendred 
it 
self 
to 
my 
notice 
on 
occasion 
of 
the 
voyage 
that 
I 
made 
into 
Syria, 
going 
Consul 
for 
this 
Nation 
to 
Aleppo, 
The 
voiages 
in 
the 
Mediterrane 
from 
East 
to 
West 
are 
made 
in 
shorter 
times 
than 
from 
West 
to 
East. 
and 
this 
it 
is: 
That 
keeping 
a 
particular 
account 
and 
memorial 
of 
the 
dayes 
of 
the 
departure 
and 
arrival 
of 
the 
Ships 
in 
the 
Ports 
of 
Alexandria, 
of 
Alexandretta, 
and 
this 
of 
Venice; 
in 
comparing 
sundry 
of 
them, 
which 
I 
did 
formy 
curiosity, 
I 
foundthatinexactness 
of

the 
voiages

contrary

in

So

SALV. 


I 
am 
very 
glad 
I 
know 
this 
particular, 
which 
doth 
not 
a 
little 
make 
for 
the 
confirmation 
of 
the 
Earths 
mobility. 
And 
although 
it 
may 
be 
alledged, 
That 
all 
the 
Water 
of 
the 
Mediterrane 
runs 
perpetually 
towards 
the 
Straits-mouth, 
as 
being 
to 
disimbogue 
into 
the 
Ocean, 
the 
waters 
of 
as 
many 
Rivers, 
as 
do 



discharge 
themselves 
into 
the 
same; 
I 
do 
not 
think 
that 
that 
current 
can 
be 
so 
great, 
as 
to 
be 
able 
of 
it 
self 
alone 
to 
make 
so 
notable 
a 
difference: 
which 
is 
also 
manifest 
by 
observing 
that 
the 
water 
in 
the 
Pharo 
of 
Sicily 
runneth 
back 
againnoless 
towards 
theEast,thanitrunnethforwardstowardstheWest. 


SAGR. 


I, 
that 
have 
not 
as 
Simplicius, 
an 
inclination 
to 
satisfie 
any 
one 
besides 
my 
self,am 
satisfied 
withwhat 
hath 
been 
said 
astothis 
first 
particular: 
Therefore 
Salviatus, 
when 
you 
think 
it 
sit 
to 
proceed 
forward, 
I 
am 
prepared 
to 
hear 
you. 


SALV. 


I 
shall 
do 
as 
you 
command 
me, 
but 
yet 
I 
would 
fain 
hear 
the 
opinion 
also 
of 
Simplicius, 
from 
whose 
judgement 
I 
can 
argue 
how 
much 
I 
may 
promise 
to 
my 
self 
touching 
these 
discourses 
from 
the 
Peripatetick 
Schools, 
if 
ever 
they 
should 
cometotheirears. 


SIMP. 


I 
desire 
not 
that 
my 
opinion 
should 
serve 
or 
stand 
for 
a 
measure, 
whereby 
you 
should 
judge 
of 
others 
thoughts; 
for 
as 
I 
have 
often 
said, 
I 
am 
inconsiderable 
in 
these 
kinde 
of 
studies, 
and 
such 
things 
may 
come 
into 
the 
mindes 
of 
those 
that 
are 
entered 
into 
the 
deepest 
passages 
of 
Philosophy, 
as 
I 
could 
never 
think 
of; 
as 
having 
(according 
to 
the 
Proverb) 
scarce 
kist 
her 
Maid: 
yet 
nevertheless, 
to 
give 
you 
my 
sudden 
thoughts, 
I 
shall 
tell 
you, 
That 
of 
those 
effects 
by 
you 
recounted, 
and 
particularly 
the 
last, 
there 
may 
in 
my 
judgement 
very 
sufficient 
Reasons 
be 
given 
without 
the 
Earths 
mobility, 
by 
the 
mobility 
of 
the 
Heavens 
onely; 
never 
introducing 
any 
novelty 
more, 
than 
the 
inversion 
of 
that 
which 
you 
your 
self 
propose 
unto 
us. 
It 
hath 
been 
received 
by 
the 
Peripatetick 
Schools, 
It 
is 
demonstrated 
inverting 
the 
argument, 
that 
the 
perpetual 
motion 
of 
the 
Air 
from 
East 
to 
West 
cometh 
from 
the 
motion 
of 
Heaven▪ 
that 
the 
Element 
of 
Fire, 
and 
also 
a 
great 
part 
of 
the 
Aire 
is 
carried 
about 
according 
to 
the 
Diurnal 
conversion 
from 
East 
to 
West, 
by 
the 
contact 
of 
the 
Concave 
of 
the 
Lunar 
Orb, 
as 
by 
the 
Vessel 
their 
container. 
Now 
without 
going 
out 
of 
your 
track, 
I 
will 
that 
we 
determine 
the 
Quantity 
of 
the 
Aire 
which 
partaketh 
of 
that 
motion 
to 
distend 
so 
low 
as 
to 



the 
Tops 
of 
the 
highest 
Hills, 
It 
is 
demonstrated 
inverting 
the 
argument, 
that 
theperpetualmotionof 
theAirfromEast 
toWest,comethfromthemotion 
of 
Heaven. 
and 
that 
likewise 
they 
would 
reach 
to 
the 
Earth, 
if 
those 
Mountains 
didnot 
impedethem, 
which 
agreethwith 
what 
you 
say: 
For 
as 
you 
affirm, 
the 
Air, 
which 
is 
invironed 
by 
ledges 
of 
Mountains, 
to 
be 
carried 
about 
by 
the 
asperity 
of 
the 
moveable 
Earth; 
we 
on 
the 
contrary 
say, 
That 
the 
whole 
Element 
of 
Air 
is 
carried 
about 
by 
the 
motion 
of 
Heaven, 
that 
part 
only 
excepted 
which 
lyeth 
below 
those 
bodies, 
which 
is 
hindred 
by 
the 
asperity 
of 
the 
immoveable 
Earth. 
And 
whereas 
you 
said, 
That 
in 
case 
that 
asperity 
should 
be 
removed, 
the 
Air 
would 
also 
cease 
to 
be 
whirld 
about; 
we 
may 
say, 
That 
the 
said 
asperity 
being 
removed, 
the 
whole 
Aire 
would 
continue 
its 
motion. 
Whereupon, 
because 
the 
surfaces 
of 
spacious 
Seas 
are 
smooth, 
and 
even; 
the 
Airs 
motion 
shall 
continue 
upon 
those, 
alwaies 
blowing 
from 
the 
East: 
And 
this 
is 
more 
sensibly 
perceived 
in 
Climates 
lying 
under 
the 
Line, 
and 
within 
the 
Tropicks, 
where 
the 
motion 
of 
Heaven 
is 
swifter; 
and 
like 
as 
that 
Celestial 
motion 
is 
able 
to 
bear 
before 
it 
all 
the 
Air 
that 
is 
at 
liberty, 
so 
we 
may 
very 
rationally 
affirm 
that 
it 
contributeth 
the 
same 
motion 
to 
the 
Water 
moveable, 
as 
being 
fluid 
and 
not 
connected 
to 
the 
immobility 
of 
the 
Earth: 
The 
motion 
of 
the 
Water 
dependeth 
on 
the 
motion 
of 
Heaven. 
And 
with 
so 
much 
the 
more 
confidence 
may 
we 
affirm 
the 
same, 
in 
that 
by 
your 
confession, 
that 
motion 
ought 
to 
be 
very 
small 
in 
resect 
of 
the 
efficient 
Cause; 
which 
begirting 
in 
a 
natural 
day 
the 
whole 
Terrestrial 
Globe, 
passeth 
many 
hundreds 
of 
miles 
an 
hour, 
and 
especially 
towards 
the 
Equinoctial; 
whereas 
in 
the 
currents 
of 
the 
open 
Sea, 
it 
moveth 
but 
very 
few 
miles 
an 
hour. 
And 
thus 
the 
voiages 
towards 
the 
West 
shall 
come 
to 
be 
commodious 
and 
expeditious, 
not 
onely 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
perpetual 
Eastern 
Gale, 
but 
of 
the 
course 
also 
of 
the 
Waters; 
from 
which 
course 
also 
perhaps 
the 
Ebbing 
and 
Flowing 
may 
come, 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
different 
scituation 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Shores: 
The 
flux 
and 
reflux 
may 
depend 
on 
the 
diurnal 
motion 
of 
Heaven. 
against 
which 
the 
Water 
coming 
to 
beat, 
may 
also 
return 
backwards 
with 
a 
contrary 
motion, 
like 
as 
experience 
sheweth 
us 
in 
the 
course 
of 
Rivers; 
for 
according 
as 
the 
Water 
in 
the 
unevenness 
of 
the 
Banks, 
meeteth 
with 
some 
parts 
that 
stand 
out, 
or 
make 
with 
their 
Meanders 
some 
Reach 
or 
Bay, 
here 
the 
Water 
turneth 
again, 
and 
is 
seen 
to 
retreat 
back 
a 
considerable 
space. 
Upon 
this 
I 
hold, 
That 
of 
those 
effects 
from 
which 
you 
argue 
the 
Earths 
mobility, 
and 
alledge 
it 
as 
a 
cause 
of 
them, 
there 
may 
be 
assigned 
a 
cause 



sufficiently 
valid, 
retaining 
the 
Earth 
stedfast, 
and 
restoring 
the 
mobility 
of 
Heaven. 


SALV. 


It 
cannot 
be 
denied, 
but 
that 
your 
discourse 
is 
ingenious, 
& 
hath 
much 
of 
probability, 
I 
mean 
probability 
in 
appearance, 
but 
not 
in 
reality 
& 
existence: 
It 
consisteth 
of 
two 
parts: 
In 
the 
first 
it 
assignes 
a 
reason 
of 
the 
continual 
motion 
of 
the 
Eastern 
Winde, 
and 
also 
of 
a 
like 
motion 
in 
the 
Water. 
In 
the 
second, 
It 
would 
draw 
from 
the 
same 
Sourse 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
Ebbing 
and 
Flowing. 
The 
first 
part 
hath 
(as 
I 
have 
said) 
some 
appearance 
of 
probability, 
but 
yet 
extreamly 
less 
then 
that 
which 
we 
take 
from 
the 
Terrestrial 
motion. 
The 
second 
is 
not 
onely 
wholly 
improbable, 
but 
altogether 
impossible 
and 
false. 
A 
reason 
of 
the 
continual 
motion 
of 
the 
Air 
and 
Water 
may 
be 
given, 
making 
the 
Earth 
moveable, 
then 
by 
making 
it 
immoveable. 
And 
coming 
to 
the 
first, 
whereas 
it 
is 
said 
that 
the 
Concave 
of 
the 
Moon 
carrieth 
about 
the 
element 
of 
Fire, 
and 
the 
whole 
Air, 
even 
to 
the 
tops 
of 
the 
higher 
Mountains. 
I 
answer 
first, 
that 
it 
is 
dubious 
whether 
there 
be 
any 
element 
of 
Fire: 
But 
suppose 
there 
be, 
it 
is 
much 
doubted 
of 
the 
Orbe 
of 
the 
Moon, 
as 
also 
of 
all 
the 
rest; 
that 
is, 
Whether 
there 
be 
any 
such 
solid 
bodies 
and 
vast, 
or 
elss, 
Whether 
beyond 
the 
Air 
there 
be 
extended 
a 
continuate 
expansion 
of 
a 
substance 
of 
much 
more 
tenuity 
and 
purity 
than 
our 
Air, 
up 
and 
down 
which 
the 
Planets 
go 
wandring, 
as 
now 
at 
last 
a 
good 
part 
of 
those 
very 
Phylosophers 
begin 
to 
think: 
Its 
improbable 
that 
the 
element 
of 
Fire 
should 
be 
carried 
round 
by 
the 
Concave 
of 
the 
Moon. 
But 
be 
it 
in 
this 
or 
in 
that 
manner, 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
for 
which 
the 
Fire, 
by 
a 
simple 
contract 
to 
a 
superficies, 
which 
you 
your 
self 
grant 
to 
be 
smooth 
and 
terse, 
should 
be 
according 
to 
its 
whole 
depth 
carried 
round 
in 
a 
motion 
different 
from 
its 
natural 
inclination; 
as 
hath 
been 
defusely 
proved, 
and 
with 
sensible 
reasons 
demonstrated 
byA 
Treatise 
of 
our 
Author 
formerly 
cited. 
Il 
Saggiatore: 
Besides 
the 
other 
improbability 
of 
the 
said 
motions 
transfusing 
it 
self 
from 
the 
subtilest 
Fire 
throughout 
the 
Air, 
much 
more 
dense; 
and 
from 
that 
also 
again 
to 
the 
Water. 
But 
that 
a 
body 
of 
rugged 
and 
mountainous 
surface, 
by 
revolving 
in 
it 
self, 
should 
carry 
with 
it 
the 
Air 
contiguous 
to 
it, 
and 
against 
which 
its 
promontaries 
beat, 
is 
not 
onely 
probable 
but 
necessary, 
and 
experience 
thereof 
may 
be 
daily 
seen; 
though 
without 
seeing 
it, 
I 
believe 
that 
there 
is 
no 
judgement 
that 
doubts 
thereof. 
As 
to 
the 
other 
part, 
supposing 
that 



the 
motion 
of 
Heaven 
did 
carry 
round 
the 
Air, 
and 
also 
the 
Water; 
yet 
would 
that 
motion 
for 
all 
that 
have 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
Ebbing 
and 
Flowing. 
For 
being 
that 
from 
one 
onely 
and 
uniform 
cause, 
there 
can 
follow 
but 
one 
sole 
and 
uniform 
effect; 
The 
Ebbing 
and 
Flowing 
cannot 
depend 
on 
the 
motion 
of 
Heaven. 
that 
which 
should 
be 
discovered 
in 
the 
Water, 
would 
be 
a 
continuate 
and 
uniform 
coursefromEasttoWest;andin 
thataSeaonely, 
whichrunning 
compass 
environeth 
the 
whole 
Globe. 
But 
in 
determinate 
Seas, 
such 
as 
is 
the 
Mediterrane 
shut 
up 
in 
the 
East, 
there 
could 
be 
no 
such 
motion. 
For 
if 
its 
Water 
might 
be 
driven 
by 
the 
course 
of 
Heaven 
towards 
the 
West, 
it 
would 
have 
been 
dry 
many 
ages 
since: 
Besides 
that 
our 
Water 
runneth 
not 
onely 
towards 
the 
West, 
But 
returneth 
backwards 
towards 
the 
East, 
and 
that 
in 
ordinal 
Periods: 
And 
whereas 
you 
say 
by 
the 
example 
of 
Rivers, 
that 
though 
the 
course 
of 
the 
Sea 
were 
Originally 
that 
onely 
from 
East 
to 
West, 
yet 
nevertheless 
the 
different 
Position 
of 
the 
Shores 
may 
make 
part 
of 
the 
Water 
regurgitate, 
and 
return 
backwards: 
I 
grant 
it 
you, 
but 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
you 
take 
notice 
my 
Simplicius, 
that 
where 
the 
Water 
upon 
that 
account 
returneth 
backwards, 
it 
doth 
so 
there 
perpetually; 
and 
where 
it 
runneth 
straight 
forwards, 
it 
runneth 
there 
alwayes 
in 
the 
same 
manner; 
for 
so 
the 
example 
of 
the 
Rivers 
shewes 
you. 
But 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
ebbing 
and 
flowing, 
you 
must 
finde 
and 
give 
us 
some 
reason 
why 
it 
doth 
in 
the 
self 
same 
place 
run 
one 
while 
one 
way, 
and 
another 
while 
another; 
Effects 
that 
being 
contrary 
& 
irregular, 
can 
never 
be 
deduced 
from 
any 
uniform 
and 
constant 
Cause: 
And 
this 
Argument, 
that 
overthrows 
the 
Hypothesis 
of 
the 
motion 
contributed 
to 
the 
Sea 
from 
the 
Heavens 
diurnal 
motion, 
doth 
also 
confute 
that 
Position 
of 
those 
who 
would 
admit 
the 
sole 
diurnal 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth, 
and 
believe 
that 
they 
are 
able 
with 
that 
alone 
to 
give 
a 
reason 
of 
the 
Flux 
and 
Reflux: 
Of 
which 
effect 
since 
it 
is 
irregular, 
the 
cause 
must 
of 
necessity 
be 
irregular 
and 
alterable. 


SIMP. 


I 
have 
nothing 
to 
reply, 
neither 
of 
my 
own, 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
weakness 
of 
my 
understanding; 
nor 
of 
that 
of

for 
that 
the 
Opinion 
is

But 
I

SALV. 


All 
that 
which 
hath 
been 
said 
hitherto, 
pertaineth 
to 
the 
diurnal 
period 
of 
the 
ebbing 
and 
flowing; 
of 
which 
we 
have 
in 
the 
first 
place 
demonstrated 
in 
general 
the 
primary 
and 
universal 
Cause, 
without 
which, 
no 
such 
effect 
would 
follow: 
Afterw 
ds 
passing 
to 
the 
particular 
Accidents, 
various, 
and 
in 
a 
certain 
sort 
irregular, 
that 
are 
observed 
therein: 
We 
have 
handled 
the 
secondary 
and 
concommitant 
Causes 
upon 
which 
they 
depend. 
Now 
follow 
the 
two 
other 
Periods, 
Monethly, 
and 
Annual, 
which 
do 
not 
bring 
with 
them 
new 
and 
different 
Accidents, 
other 
than 
those 
already 
considered 
in 
the 
diurnal 
Period; 
but 
they 
operate 
on 
the 
same 
Accidents, 
by 
rendring 
them 
greater 
and 
lesser 
in 
several 
parts 
of 
the 
Lunar 
Moneth, 
and 
in 
several 
times 
of 
the 
Solar 
Year; 
as 
if 
that 
the 
Moon 
and 
Sun 
did 
each 
conceive 
it 
self 
apart 
in 
operating 
and 
producing 
of 
those 
Effects; 
a 
thing 
that 
totally 
clasheth 
with 
my 
understanding, 
which 
seeing 
how 
that

that 
are

that 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
Tide 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
them, 
that 
is, 
of 
bringing 
them 
into 
the 
brains 
more 
apt 
for 
loquacity 
and 
ostentation, 
than 
for 
the 
speculation 
and 
discovering 
of 
the 
more 
abstruse 
secrets 
of 
Nature; 
which 
kind 
of 
people, 
before 
they 
can 
be 
brought 
to 
pronounce 
that 
wise, 
ingenious, 
and 
modest 
sentence, 
I 
know 
it 
not, 
suffer 
to 
escape 
from 
their

all

of

but 
that 
to 
effect 
their

by

they 
must 
be 
reduced 
to 
little 
lesse 
than 
boiling, 
and 
in 
short, 
we 
not 
being 
able 
artificially 
to 
imitate 
any 
way 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
Tide, 
save 
only 
by 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Vessel, 
ought 
it 
not 
to 
satisfie 
every 
one, 
that 
all 
the 
other 
things 
alledged, 
as 
causes 
of 
those 
effects, 
are 
vaine 
fancies, 
and 
altogether 
estranged 
from 
the 
Truth. 
I 
say, 
The 
alterations 
in 
the 
effects 
argue 
alteration 
in 
the 
cause. 
therefore, 
that 
if 
it 
be 
true, 
that 
of 
one 
effect 
there 
is 
but 
one 
sole 
primary 
cause, 
and 
that 
between 
the 
cause 
and 
effect, 
there 
is 
a 
firm 
and 
constant 



connection; 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
whensoever 
there 
is 
seen 
a 
firm 
and 
constant 
alteration 
in 
the 
effect, 
there 
be 
a 
firm 
and 
constant 
alteration 
in 
the 
cause. 
And 
because 
the 
alterations 
that 
happen 
in 
the 
ebbing 
and 
flowing 
in 
several 
parts 
of 
the 
Year 
and 
Moneths, 
have 
their 
periods 
firm 
and 
constant, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
say, 
that 
a 
regular 
alteration 
in 
those 
same 
times 
happeneth 
in 
the 
primary 
cause 
of 
the 
ebbings 
and 
flowings. 
The 
causes 
as 
large 
assigned 
of 
the 
Periods 
Monethly 
and 
Annual 
of 
the 
ebbings 
and 
flowings. 
And 
as 
for 
the 
alteration 
that 
in 
those 
times 
happens 
in 
the 
ebbings 
and 
flowings 
consisteth 
onely 
in 
their 
greatness; 
that 
is, 
in 
the 
Waters 
rising 
and 
falling 
more 
or 
lesse, 
and 
in 
running 
with 
greater 
or 
lesse 
impetus; 
therefore 
it 
is 
necessary, 
that 
that 
which 
is 
the 
primary 
cause 
of 
the 
ebbing 
and 
flowing, 
doth 
in 
those 
same 
determinate 
times 
increase 
and 
diminish 
its 
force. 
But 
we 
have 
already 
concluded 
upon 
the 
inequality 
and 
irregularity 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Vessels 
containing 
the 
Water 
to 
be 
the 
primary 
cause 
of 
the 
ebbings 
and 
flowings. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
necessary, 
that 
that 
irregularity, 
from 
time 
to 
time, 
correspondently 
grow 
more 
irregular, 
that 
is, 
grow 
greater 
and 
lesser. 
Now 
it 
is 
requisite, 
that 
we 
call 
to 
minde, 
that 
the 
irregularity, 
that 
is, 
the 
different 
velocity 
of 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
Vessels, 
to 
wit, 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Superficies, 
dependeth 
on 
their 
moving 
with 
a 
compound 
motion, 
resulting 
from 
the 
commixtion 
of 
the 
two 
motions, 
Annual 
and 
Diurnal, 
proper 
to 
the 
whole 
Terrestrial 
Globe; 
of 
which 
the 
Diurnal 
conversion, 
by 
one 
while 
adding 
to, 
and 
another 
while 
substracting 
from, 
the 
Annual 
motion, 
is 
that 
which 
produceth 
the 
irregularity 
in 
the 
compound 
motion; 
so 
that, 
in 
the 
additions 
and 
substractions, 
that 
the 
Diurnal 
revolution 
maketh 
from 
the 
Annual 
motion, 
consisteth 
the 
original 
cause 
of 
the 
irregular 
motion 
of 
the 
Vessels, 
The 
monethly 
and 
annual 
alterations 
of 
the 
tide 
can 
depend 
upon 
nothing, 
save 
on 
the 
alteration 
of 
the 
additions 
& 
substractions 
of 
the 
diurnal 
period 
from 
the 
annual. 
and 
consequently 
of 
the 
Ebbing 
and 
Flowing: 
insomuch 
that 
if 
these 
additions 
and 
substractions 
should 
alwayes 
proceed 
in 
the 
same 
proportion, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
Annual 
motion, 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
Ebbing 
and 
Flowing 
would 
indeed 
continue, 
but 
yet 
so 
as 
that 
they 
would 
perpetually 
return 
in 
the 
self 
same 
manner: 
But 
we 
are 
to 
finde 
out 
the 
cause 
of 
making 
the 
same 
Ebbings 
and 
Flowings 
in 
divers 
times 
greater 
and 
lesser: 
Therefore 
wemust 
(ifwe 
will 
retain 
the 
identityofthecause)findthe 
alteration 
in 
these 
additions 
and 
substractions, 
that 
make 
them 
more 
& 
less 
potent, 
in 
producing 
those 
effects 
which 
depend 
thereupon. 
But 
I 
see 
not 
how 
that 
potency 
and 
impotence 
can 
be 
introduced, 
unlesse 
by 
making 
the 
same 
additions 
and 



substractions, 
one 
while 
greater, 
and 
another 
while 
lesser; 
so 
that 
the 
acceleration 
and 
the 
retardment 
of 
the 
compound 
motion, 
may 
be 
made, 
sometimes 
ingreater,andsometimes 
inlesserproportion.

Though 
there 
be 
a 
great 
difference 
between 
my 
slow 
pac’t 
Philosophy, 
and 
your 
more 
nimble 
Reason, 
yet 
neverthelesse, 
in 
this 
particular 
which 
we 
are 
now 
upon, 
I 
do 
not 
much 
wonder, 
if 
the 
apprehensivenesse 
of 
your 
wit 
be 
a 
little 
obscured 
by 
the 
dark 
and 
thick 
mist 
that 
hides 
the 
mark, 
at 
which 
we 
aime: 
and 
that 
which 
lesseneth 
my 
admiration 
is, 
the 
remembrance 
of 
the 
many 
hours, 
many 
dayes, 
yea 
more, 
many 
nights 
that 
I 
have 
consumed 
in 
this 
contemplation, 
and 
of 
the 
many 
times 
that, 
despairing 
to 
bring 
it 
to 
a 
period, 
I 
have, 
for 
an 
incouragement 
of 
my 
self, 
indeavoured 
to 
believe, 
by 
the 
example 
of 
the 
unfortunate 
Orlando, 
that 
that 
might 
not 
possibly 
be 
true, 
which 
yet 
the 
testimony 
of 
so 
many 
credible 
men 
set 
before 
my 
eyes: 
wonder 
not, 
therefore, 
if 
this 
once, 
contrary 
to 
your 
custome, 
you 
do 
not 
foresee 
what 
I 
intend: 
and 
if 
you 
will 
needs 
admire, 
I 
believe 
that 
the

as

I 
thank 
God, 
that 
he 
did 
not 
permit 
that 
desperation 
of 
yours 
to 
end 
in 
the 
Exit 
that 
is 
fabled 
of

in

that 
so 
neither 
my

of

of

SALV. 


I 
am 
ready 
to 
serve 
you: 
We 
were 
upon 
an 
inquiry 
in 
what 
manner 
the 
additions 
and 
substractions 
of 
the 
Terrestriall 
conversion 
from 
the 
Annual 



motion, 
could 
be 
made, 
one 
while 
in 
a 
greater, 
and 
another 
while 
in 
a 
lesser 
proportion; 
which 
diversity, 
and 
no 
other 
thing, 
could 
be 
assigned 
for 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
alterations, 
Monethly 
and 
Annual, 
that 
are 
seen 
in 
the 
greatnesse 
of 
the 
Ebbings 
and 
Flowings. 
I 
will 
now 
consider 
how 
this 
proportion 
of 
the 
additions 
and 
substractions 
of 
the 
Diurnal 
Revolution, 
Three 
wayes 
of 
altering 
the 
proportion 
of 
the 
additions 
of 
the 
diurnal 
Revolution 
to 
the 
annual 
motion. 
and 
Annual 
motion 
may 
grow 
greater 
and 
lesser 
three 
several 
wayes. 
One 
is 
by 
increasing 
and 
diminishing 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
Annual 
motion, 
retaining 
the 
additions 
and 
substractions 
made 
by 
the 
Diurnal 
conversion 
in 
the 
same 
greatnesse, 
because 
the 
Annual 
motion 
being 
about 
three 
times 
greater, 
that 
is, 
more 
velocious 
than 
the 
Diurnal 
motion 
(considered 
likewise 
in 
the 
Grand 
Circle) 
if 
we 
increase 
itanew, 
theadditions 
and 
substractions 
of 
the 
Diurnal 
motion 
will 
occasion 
lesse 
alteration 
therein: 
but, 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
making 
it 
more 
slow, 
it 
will 
be 
altered 
in 
greater 
proportion, 
by 
that 
same 
diurnal 
motion, 
just 
as 
the 
adding 
or 
substracting 
four 
degrees 
of 
velocity 
from 
one 
that 
moveth 
with 
twenty 
degrees, 
altereth 
his 
course 
lesse, 
than 
those 
very 
four 
degrees 
would 
do, 
added 
or 
substracted 
from 
one 
that 
should 
move 
onely 
with 
ten 
degrees. 
The 
second 
way 
would 
be, 
by 
making 
the 
additions 
and 
substractions 
greater 
and 
lesser, 
retaining 
the 
annual 
motion 
in 
the 
same 
velocity; 
which 
is 
as 
easie 
to 
be 
understood, 
as 
it 
is 
manifest, 
that 
a 
velocity 
v. 
gr. 
of 
20 
degr. 
is 
more 
altered 
by 
the 
addition 
or 
substraction 
of 
10. 
deg. 
than 
by 
the 
addition 
or 
substraction 
of 
4. 
The 
third 
way 
would 
be, 
in 
case 
these 
two 
were 
joyned 
together, 
diminishing 
the 
annual 
motion, 
& 
increasing 
the 
diurnal 
additions 
and 
substractions. 
Hitherto, 
as 
you 
see, 
it 
was 
no 
hard 
matter 
to 
attain, 
but 
yet 
it 
proved 
to 
me 
very 
hard 
to 
find 
by 
what 
means 
this 
might 
be 
effected 
in 
Nature. 
That 
which 
to 
us 
is 
hard 
to 
be 
understood, 
is 
with 
Nature 
easie 
to 
be 
effected. 
Yet 
in 
the 
end, 
I 
finde 
that 
she 
doth 
admirably 
make 
use 
thereof, 
and 
in 
wayes 
almost 
incredible: 
I 
mean, 
admirable 
and 
incredible 
to 
us, 
but 
not 
to 
her, 
who 
worketh 
even 
those 
very 
things, 
which, 
to 
our 
capacity, 
are 
of 
infinite 
wonder, 
with 
extraordinary 
facility 
and 
simplicity: 
and 
that 
which 
it 
is 
hard 
for 
us 
to 
understand, 
is 
easie 
for 
her 
to 
effect. 
Now 
to 
proceed, 
having 
shewn 
that 
the 
proportion 
between 
the 
additions 
and 
substractions 
of 
the 
Diurnal 
conversion 
and 
Annual 
motion 
may 
be 
made 
greater 
and 
lesser, 
two 
wayes, 
(and 
I 
say 
two, 
because 
the 
third 
is 
comprized 
in 
the 
two 
first) 
I 
adde, 
that 
Nature 
maketh 
use 
of 
them 
both: 
and 
farthermore, 
I 
subjoyn, 
that 
if 
she 
did 
make 
use 
but 
of 
one 
alone, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
take 
away 
one 
of 
the 
two 



Periodical 
alterations. 
If 
the 
Diurnal 
motion 
should 
not 
alter, 
the 
annual 
Period 
would 
cease 
That 
of 
the 
Monethly 
Period 
would 
cease, 
if 
the 
annual 
motion 
should 
not 
alter. 
And 
in 
case 
the 
additions 
and 
substractions 
of 
the 
diurnal 
revolution 
should 
continually 
be 
equal, 
the 
alterations 
of 
the 
annual 
Periodwouldfail. 


SAGR. 


It 
seems 
then,that 
the 
Monethly 
alteration 
of 
ebbings 
and 
flowings 
dependeth 
on 
the 
alteration 
of 
the 
annual 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth? 
And 
the 
annual 
alteration 
of 
those 
ebbings 
and 
flowings 
do, 
it 
seems, 
depend 
on 
the 
additions 
and 
substractions 
of 
the 
diurnal 
conversion? 
And 
here 
now 
I 
finde 
my 
self 
worse 
puzzled 
than 
before, 
and 
more 
out 
of 
hope 
of 
being 
able 
to 
comprehend 
how 
this 
intricacy 
may 
be, 
which 
is 
more 
inextricable, 
in 
my 
judgment, 
than 
the 
Gordian 
knot. 
AndI

I

verily,

that 
you

and 
I

I

also

of 
your 
confusion,

if 
I 
mistake 
not, 
riseth

part 
of 
those 
particulars 
but 
even 
now 
alledged 
by

and 
but 
a 
part. 
It 
is 
true 
likewise 
that 
I 
find 
my 
self 
free 
from 
the 
like 
confusion; 
but 
not 
for 
that 
cause 
as 
you 
think, 
to 
wit, 
because 
I 
apprehend 
the 
whole, 
nay 
it 
happens 
upon 
the 
quite 
contrary 
account; 
namely, 
from 
my

You 
see

how 
a 
few 
checks 
given

I 
will 
endeavour 
it 
to 
the 
utmost 
of 
my 
harsh 
way 
of 
expressing 
my 
self, 
the 
obtusenesse 
of 
which, 
the 
acutenesse 
of 
your 
wit 
shall 
supply. 
The 
accidents 
of 
which 
we 
are 
to 
enquire 
the 
causes 
are 
two: 
The 
first 
respecteth 
the 
varieties 
that 
happen 
in 
the 
ebbings 
and 
flowings 
in 
the 
Monethly 
Period; 
and 
the 
othr 
relateth 
to 
the 
Annual. 
We 
will 
first 
speak 
of 
the 
Monethly, 
and 
then 
treat 
of 
the 
Annual; 
and 
it 
is 
convenient 
that 
we 
resolve 
them 
all 
according 
to 
the 
Fundamentals 
and 
Hypothesis 
already 
laid 
down, 
without 
introducing 
any 
novelty 
either 
in 
Astronomy, 
or 
in 
the 
Universe, 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
ebbings 
and 
flowings; 
therefore 
let 
us 
demonstrate 
that 
of 
all 
the 
several 
accidents 
in 
them 
observed, 
the 
causes 
reside 
in 
the 
things 
already 
known, 
The 
true 
Hypothesis 
may 
dispatch 
its 
revolutions 
in 
a 
shorter 
time, 
in 
lesser 
circles 
than 
in 
greater; 
the 
which 
is 
proved 
by 
two 
examples. 
and 
received 
for 
true 
and 
undoubted. 
I 
say 
therefore, 
that 
it 
is 
a 
truly 
natural, 
yea 
necessary 
thing, 
that 
one 
and 
the 
same 
moveable 
made 
to 
move 
round 
by 
the 
same 
moving 
virtue 
in 
a 
longer 
time, 
do 
make 
its 
course 
by 
a 
greater 
circle, 
rather 
than 
by 
a 
lesser; 
and 
this 
is 
a 
truth 
received 
by 
all, 
and 
confirmed 
by 
all 
experiments, 
The 
first 
example. 
of 
which 
we 
will 
produce 
a 
few. 
In 
the 
wheel-clocks, 
and 
particularly 
in 
the 
great 
ones, 
to 
moderate 
the 
time, 
the 
Artificers 
that 
make 
them 
accomodate 
a 
certain 
voluble 
staffe 
horozontally, 
and 
at 
each 
end 
of 
it 
they 
fasten 
two 
Weights 
of 
Lead, 
and 
when 
the 
time 
goeth 
too 
slow, 
by 
the 
onely 
removing 
those 
Leads 
a 
little 
nearer 
to 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
staffe, 
they 
render 
its 
vibrations 
more 
frequent; 
and 
on 
the 
contrary 
to 
retard 
it, 
it 
is 
but 
drawing 
those 
Weights 
more 
towardstheends;forso 
the 
vibrations 
aremademoreseldome, 
and 
consequentlytheintervals 
ofthehoursare 
prolonged. 


Here 
the 
movent 
vertue 
is 
the 
same, 
The 
second 
example. 
namely 
the 
counterpoise, 
the 
moveables 
are 
those 
same 
Weights 
of 
lead, 
and 
their 
vibrations 
are 
more 
frequent 
when 
they 
are 
neerer 
to 
the 
centre, 
that 
is, 
when 
they 
move 
by 
lesser 
circles. 
Hanging 
equal 
Weights 
at 
unequal 
cords, 
and 
being 
removed 
from 
their 
perpendicularity, 
letting 
them 
go; 
we 
shall 
see 
those 
that 
are 
pendent 
at 
the 
shorter 
cords, 
to 
make 
their 
vibrations 
under 
shorter 
times, 
as 
those 
that 
move 
by 
lesser 
circles. 
Again, 
let 
such 
a 
kind 
of 
Weight 
be 
fastened 
to 
a 
cord, 
which 
cord 
let 
play 
upon 
a 
staple 
fastened 
in 
the 
Seeling, 
and 
do 
you 
hold 
the 
other 
end 
of 
the 
cord 
in 
your 
hand, 
and 
having 
given 
the 
motion 
to 
the 
pendent 
Weight, 
whilst 
it 
is 
making 
its 
vibrations, 
pull 
the 
end 
of 
the 
cord 
that 
you 
hold 
in 
your 
hand, 
so 
that 
the 
Weight 
may 
rise 
higher 
and 
higher: 
In 
its 
rising 
you 
shall 
see 
the 
frequency 



of 
its 
vibrations 
encrease, 
in 
regard 
that 
they 
are 
made 
successively 
by 
lesser 
and 
lesser 
circies. 
Two 
particular 
notable 
accidents 
in 
the 
penduli 
and 
their 
vibrations. 
And 
here 
I 
desire 
you 
to 
take 
notice 
of 
two 
particulars 
worthy 
to 
be 
observed. 
One 
is 
that 
the 
vibrations 
of 
one 
of 
those 
plummets 
are 
made 
with 
such 
a 
necessity 
under 
such 
determinate 
times, 
that 
it 
is 
altogether 
impossible 
to 
cause 
them 
to 
be 
made 
under 
other 
times, 
unlesse 
it 
be 
by 
prolonging, 
or 
abreviating 
the 
cord; 
of 
which 
you 
may 
also 
at 
this 
very 
instant 
ascertain 
your 
selves 
by 
experience, 
tying 
a 
stone 
to 
a 
pack-threed, 
and 
holding 
the 
other 
end 
in 
your 
hand, 
trying 
whether 
you 
can 
ever 
by 
any 
artifice 
be 
able 
to 
swing 
it 
this 
way 
and 
that 
way 
in 
other 
than 
one 
determinate 
time, 
unlesse 
by 
lengthening 
of 
shortening 
the 
string, 
which 
you 
will 
find 
to 
be 
absolutely 
impossible. 
The 
other 
particular 
truly 
admirable 
is, 
that 
the 
self 
same 
pendulum 
makes 
its 
vibrations 
with 
one 
and 
the 
same 
frequency, 
or 
very 
little, 
and 
as 
it 
were 
insensibly 
different, 
whether 
they 
be 
made 
by 
very 
great, 
or 
very 
small 
arches 
of 
the 
self-same 
circumference. 
I 
mean 
that 
whether 
we 
remove 
the 
pendulum 
from 
perpendicularity 
one, 
two, 
or 
three 
degrees 
onely, 
or 
whether 
we 
remove 
it 
70. 
80. 
nay 
to 
an 
entire 
quadrant, 
it 
being 
let 
go, 
will 
in 
the 
one 
case 
and 
in 
the 
other 
make 
its 
vibrations 
with 
the 
same 
frequency, 
as 
well 
the 
former 
where 
it 
is 
to 
move 
by 
an 
arch 
of 
but 
four 
or 
six 
degrees, 
as 
the 
second, 
where 
it 
is 
to 
passe 
arches 
of 


160. 
ormore 
degrees. 
Whichmaythebetterbeseen,byhangingtwoweights 
at 
two 
strings 
of 
equal 
length, 
and 
then 
removing 
themfrom 
perpendicularity, 
one 
a 
little 
way, 
and 
the 
other 
very 
far; 
the 
which 
being 
set 
at 
liberty, 
will 
go 
& 
return 
under 
the 
same 
times, 
the 
one 
by 
arches 
very 
small, 
& 
the 
other 
by 
very 
great 
ones, 
from 
whence 
followeth 
the 
conclusion 
of 
an 
admirable 
Problem; 
Admirable 
Problems 
of 
moveables 
descending 
by 
the 
Quadrant 
of 
a 
Circle, 
and 
of 
those 
descending 
by 
all 
the 
cords 
of 
the 
whole 
Circle. 
which 
is, 
That 
a 
Quadrant 
of 
a 
Circle 
being 
given 
(take 
a 
little 
diagram 
of 
the 
same, 
[in 
Fig. 
3. 
]) 
as 
for 
instance: 
AB 
erect 
to 
the 
Horizon, 
so 
as 
that 
it 
rest 
upon 
the 
plain 
touching 
in 
the 
point 
B. 
and 
an 
Arch 
being 
made 
with 
a 
Hoop 
well 
plained 
and 
smoothed 
in 
the 
concave 
part, 
bending 
it 
according 
to 
the 
curvity 
of 
the 
Circumference 
ADB. 
So 
that 
a 
Bullet 
very 
round 
and 
smooth 
may 
freely 
run 
to 
and 
again 
within 
it 
(the 
rim 
of 
a 
Sieve 
is 
very 
proper 
for 
the 
experiment) 
I 
say, 
that 
the 
Bullet 
being 
put 
in 
any 
what 
ever 
place, 
neer 
or 
far 
from 
the 
lowest 
term 
B. 
As 
for 
instance, 
putting 
it 
in 
the 
point 
C, 
or 
here 
in 
D, 
or 
in 
E; 
and 
then 
let 
go, 
it 
will 
in 
equal 
times, 
or 
insensibly 
different 
arrive 
at 
the 
term 
B, 
departing 
from 
C, 
or 
from 
D, 
or 
from 
E, 
or 
from 
whatever 

other 
place; 
an 
accident 
truly 
wonderfull. 
We 
may 
add 
another 
accident 
no 
less 
strange 
than 
this, 
which 
is, 
That 
moreover 
by 
all 
the 
cords 
drawn 
from 
the 
point 
B 
to 
the 
points 
C, 
D, 
E; 
and 
to 
any 
other 
whatsoever, 
taken 
not 
onely 
in 
the 
Quadrant 
BA, 
but 
in 
all 
the 
whole 
circumference 
of 
the 
Circle 
the 
said 
moveable 
shall 
descend 
in 
times 
absolutely 
equal; 
insomuch 
that 
it 
shall 
be 
no 
longer 
in 
descending 
by 
the 
whole 
Diameter 
erect 
perpendicularly 
upon 
the 
point 
B, 
then 
it 
shall 
in 
descending 
by 
B. 
C. 
although 
it 
do 
sublend 
but 
one 
sole 
degree, 
or 
a 
lesser 
Arch. 
Let 
us 
add 
the 
other 
wonder, 
which 
is, 
That 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
falling 
bodies 
made 
by 
the 
Arches 
of 
the 
Quadrant 
AB; 
are 
made 
in 
shorter 
times 
than 
those 
that 
are 
made 
by 
the 
cords 
of 
those 
same 
Arches; 
so 
that 
the 
swiftest 
motion, 
and 
made 
by 
a 
moveable 
in 
the 
shortest 
time, 
to 
arrive 
from 
the 
point 
A, 
to 
the 
term 
B, 
shall 
be 
that 
which 
is 
made, 
not 
by 
the 
right 
line 
A, 
B, 
(although 
it 
be 
the 
shortest 
of 
all 
those 
that 
can 
de 
drawn 
between 
the 
points 
A. 
B.) 
but 
by 
the 
circumference 
ADB. 
And 
any 
point 
being 
taken 
in 
the 
said 
Arch; 
as 
for 
example: 
The 
point 
D. 
and 
two 
cords 
drawn 
AD, 
and 
D. 
B. 
the 
moveable 
departing 
from 
the 
qoint 
A, 
shall 
in 
a 
less 
time 
come 
to 
B, 
moving 
by 
the 
two 
cords 
AD 
and 
DB. 
than 
by 
the 
sole 
cord 
A, 
B. 
But 
the 
shortestof 
all 
the 
timesshall 
be 
thatof 
the 
fallby 
the 
Arch 
ADB. 
And 
the 
self 
same 
accidents 
are 
to 
be 
understood 
of 
all 
the 
other 
lesser 
ArchestakenfromthelowermosttermB.

SALV. 


I 
shall 
be 
ready 
to 
serve 
you, 
but 
we 
must 
make 
more 
than 
one 
or 
two 
Sessions; 
if 
besides 
the 
other 
questions 
reserved 
to 
be 
handled 
apart, 
we 
would 
discusse 
those 
many 
that 
pertain 
to 
the 
local 
motion, 
as 
well 
of 
natural 



moveables, 
as 
of 
the 
rejected: 
an 
Argument 
largely 
treated 
of 
by 
our 
Lyncean 
Accademick. 
But 
turning 
to 
our 
first 
purpose, 
where 
we 
were 
about 
to 
declare, 
That 
the 
bodies 
moving 
circularly 
by 
a 
movent 
virtue, 
which 
continually 
remaineth 
the 
same, 
the 
times 
of 
the 
circulation 
were 
prefixt 
and 
determined, 
and 
impossible 
to 
be 
made 
longer 
or 
shorter, 
having 
given 
examples, 
and 
produced 
experiments 
thereof, 
sensible, 
and 
feasible, 
we 
may 
confirm 
the 
same 
truth 
by 
the 
experiences 
of 
the 
Celestial 
motions 
of 
the 
Planets; 
in 
which 
we 
see 
the 
same 
rule 
observed; 
for 
those 
that 
move 
by 
greater 
Circles, 
confirm 
longer 
times 
in 
passing 
them. 
A 
most 
pertinent 
observation 
of 
this 
we 
have 
from 
the 
Medicaean 
Planets, 
which 
in 
short 
times 
make 
their 
revolutions 
about 
Jupiter: 
Insomuch 
that 
it 
is 
not 
to 
be 
questioned, 
nay 
we 
may 
hold 
it 
for 
sure 
and 
certain, 
that 
if 
for 
example, 
the 
Moon 
continuing 
to 
be 
moved 
by 
the 
same 
movent 
faculty, 
should 
retire 
by 
little 
and 
little 
in 
lesser 
Circles, 
it 
would 
acquire 
a 
power 
of 
abreviating 
the 
times 
of 
its 
Periods, 
according 
to 
that 
Pendulum, 
of 
which 
in 
the 
course 
of 
its 
vibrations, 
we 
by 
degrees 
shortned 
the 
cord, 
that 
is 
contracted 
the 
Semidiameter 
of 
the 
circumferences 
by 
it 
passed. 
Know 
now 
that 
this 
that 
I 
have 
alledged 
anexample 
of 
it 
in 
theMoon, 
is 
seen 
and 
verified 
essentially 
in 
fact. 
Let 
us 
call 
to 
mind, 
that 
it 
hath 
been 
already 
concluded 
by 
us, 
together 
with 
Copernicus, 
The 
Earths 
annual 
motion 
by 
the 
Ecliptick, 
unequal 
by 
meansoftheMoonsmotion, 
Thatitisnotpossibletoseparatethe 
Moonfrom 
the 
Earth, 
about 
which 
it 
without 
dispute 
revolveth 
in 
a 
Moneth: 
Let 
us 
remember 
also 
that 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe, 
accompanyed 
alwayes 
by 
the 
Moon, 
goeth 
along 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
Grand 
Orb 
about 
the 
Sun 
in 
a 
year, 
in 
which 
time 
theMoon 
revolvethabout 
the 
Earthalmostthirteen 
times; 
from 
which 
revolution 
it 
followeth, 
that 
the 
said 
Moon 
sometimes 
is 
found 
near 
the 
Sun; 
that 
is, 
when 
it 
is 
between 
the 
Sun 
and 
the 
Earth, 
and 
sometimes 
much 
more 
remote, 
that 
is, 
when 
the 
Earth 
is 
situate 
between 
the 
Moon 
and 
Sun; 
neer, 
in 
a 
word, 
at 
the 
time 
of 
its 
conjunction 
and 
change; 
remote, 
in 
its 
Full 
and 
Opposition; 
and 
the 
greatest 
vicinity 
differ 
the 
quantity 
of 
the 
Diameter 
of 
the 
Lunar 
Orb. 
Now 
if 
it 
be 
true 
that 
the 
virtue 
which 
moveth 
the 
Earth 
and 
Moon, 
about 
the 
Sun, 
be 
alwayes 
maintained 
in 
the 
same 
vigour; 
and 
if 
it 
be 
true 
that 
the 
same 
moveable 
moved 
by 
the 
same 
virtue, 
but 
in 
circles 
unequal, 
do 
in 
shorter 
times 
passe 
like 
arches 
of 
lesser 
circles, 
it 
must 
needs 
be 
granted, 
that 
the 
Moon 
when 
it 
is 
at 
a 
lesse 
distance 
from 
the 
Sun, 
that 
is 
in 
the 
time 
of 
conjunction, 
passeth 
greater 
arches 
of 
the 
Grand 
Orb, 
than 
when 
it 
is 
at 
a 
greater 
distance, 
that 
is 
in 
its 
Opppsition 
and 



Full. 
And 
this 
Lunar 
inequality 
must 
of 
necessity 
be 
imparted 
to 
the 
Earth 
also; 
for 
if 
we 
shall 
suppose 
a 
right 
line 
produced 
from 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Sun 
by 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe, 
and 
prolonged 
as 
far 
as 
the 
Orb 
of 
the 
Moon, 
this 
shall 
be 
the 
semidiameter 
of 
the 
Grand 
Orb, 
in 
which 
the 
Earth, 
in 
case 
it 
were 
alone, 
would 
move 
uniformly, 
but 
if 
in 
the 
same 
semidiameter 
we 
should 
place 
another 
body 
to 
be 
carried 
about, 
placing 
it 
one 
while 
between 
the 
Earth 
and 
Sun, 
and 
another 
while 
beyond 
the 
Earth, 
at 
a 
greater 
distance 
from 
the 
Sun, 
it 
is 
necessary, 
that 
in 
this 
second 
case 
the 
motion 
common 
to 
both, 
according 
to 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
great 
Orb 
by 
means 
of 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
Moon, 
do 
prove 
a 
little 
slower 
than 
in 
the 
other 
case, 
when 
the 
Moon 
is 
between 
the 
Earth 
and 
Sun, 
that 
is 
at 
a 
lesser 
distance. 
So 
that 
in 
this 
businesse 
the 
very 
same 
happeneth 
that 
befals 
in 
the 
time 
of 
the 
clock; 
thatleadwhichis 
placedone 
whilefarther 
fromthe 
centre,to 
make 
the 
vibrationsofthe 
staffe 
or 
ballance 
lessefrequent, 
and 
anotherwhile 
nearer, 
to 
makethemthicker,representingtheMoon. 
Hence 
itmaybe 
manifest,thatthe 
annual 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth 
in 
the 
Grand 
Orb, 
and 
under 
the 
Ecliptick, 
is 
not 
uniform, 
and 
that 
its 
irregularity 
proceedeth 
from 
the 
Moon, 
and 
hath 
its 
Monethly 
Periods 
and 
Returns. 
And 
because 
it 
hath 
been 
concluded, 
that 
the 
Monethly 
and 
Annual 
Periodick 
alterations 
of 
the 
ebbings 
and 
flowings, 
cannot 
be 
deduced 
from 
any 
other 
cause 
than 
from 
the 
altered 
proportion 
between 
the 
annual 
motion 
and 
the 
additions 
and 
substractions 
of 
the 
diurnal 
conversion; 
and 
that 
those 
alterations 
might 
be 
made 
two 
wayes, 
that 
is 
by 
altering 
the 
annual 
motion, 
keeping 
the 
quantity 
of 
the 
additions 
unaltered, 
or 
by 
changing 
of 
the 
bignesse 
of 
these, 
reteining 
the 
uniformity 
of 
annual 
motion. 
We 
have 
already 
found 
the 
first 
of 
these, 
depending 
on 
the 
irregularity 
of 
the 
annual 
motion 
occasioned 
by 
the 
Moon, 
and 
which 
hath 
its 
Monethly 
Periods. 
It 
is 
therefore 
necessary, 
that 
upon 
that 
account 
the 
ebbings 
and 
flowings 
have 
a 
Monethly 
Period 
in 
which 
they 
do 
grow 
greater 
and 
lesser. 
Now 
you 
see 
that 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
Monethly 
Period 
resideth 
in 
the 
annual 
motion; 
and 
withal 
you 
see 
how 
much 
the 
Moon 
is 
concerned 
in 
this 
business, 
and 
how 
it 
is 
therewith 
interrupted 
apart, 
without 
having 
any 
thing 
todo

If 
one 
that 
never 
had 
seen 
any 
kinde 
of 
Stairs 
or 
Lader, 
were 
shewed 
a 
very 
high 
Tower, 
and 
asked 
if 
ever 
he 
hoped 
to 
climb 
to 
the 
top 
of 
it, 
I 
verily 



believe 
that 
he 
would 
answer 
he 
did 
not, 
not 
conceiving 
how 
one 
should 
come 
thither 
any 
way 
except 
by 
flying; 
but 
shewing 
him 
a 
stone 
of 
but 
a 
foot 
high, 
and 
asking 
him 
whether 
he 
thought 
he 
could 
get 
to 
the 
top 
of 
that, 
I 
am 
certain 
that 
he 
would 
answer 
he 
could; 
and 
farther, 
that 
he 
would 
not 
deny, 
but 
that 
it 
was 
not 
onely 
one, 
but 
ten, 
twenty, 
and 
an 
hundred 
times 
easier 
to 
climb 
that: 
But 
now 
if 
he 
should 
be 
shewed 
the 
Stairs, 
by 
means 
whereof, 
with 
the 
facility 
by 
him 
granted, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
get 
thither, 
whither 
he 
a 
little 
before 
had 
affirmed 
it 
was 
impossible 
to 
ascend, 
I 
do 
think 
that 
laughing 
at 
himself 
he 
would 
confess 
his 
dulness 
of 
apprehension. 
Thus, 
Salviatus, 
have 
you 
step 
by 
step 
so 
gently 
lead 
me, 
that, 
not 
without 
wonder, 
I 
finde 
that 
I 
am 
got 
with 
small 
pains 
to 
that 
height 
which 
I 
despaired 
of 
arriving 
at. 
’Tis 
true; 
that 
theStaircase 
havingbeendark, 
I 
didnotperceivethatIwasgotnearerto, 
or 
arrived 
at 
the 
top, 
till 
that 
coming 
into 
the 
open 
Air 
I 
discovered 
a 
great 
Sea, 
and 
spacious 
Country: 
And 
as 
in 
ascending 
one 
step, 
there 
is 
no 
labour; 
so 
each 
of 
your 
propositions 
by 
it 
self 
seemed 
to 
me 
so 
plain, 
that 
thinking 
I 
heard 
but 
little 
or 
nothing 
that 
was 
new 
unto 
me, 
I 
conceived 
that 
my 
benefit 
thereby 
had 
been 
little 
or 
none 
at 
all: 
Whereupon 
I 
was 
the 
more 
amazed 
at 
the 
unexpected 
exit 
of 
this 
discourse, 
that 
hath 
guided 
me 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
a 
thing 
which 
I 
held 
impossible 
to 
be 
demonstrated. 
One 
doubt 
onely 
remains, 
from 
which 
I 
desire 
to 
be 
freed, 
and 
this 
it 
is; 
Whether 
that 
if 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth 
together 
with 
that 
of 
the 
Moon 
under 
the 
Zodiack 
are 
irregular 
motions, 
those 
irregularities 
ought 
to 
have 
been 
observed 
and 
taken 
notice 
of 
by 
Astronomers, 
which 
I 
do 
not 
know 
that 
they 
are: 
Therefore 
I 
pray 
you, 
who 
are 
better 
acquainted 
with 
these 
things 
than 
I, 
to 
free 
me 
from 
this 
doubt,and 
tellmehow 
the 
asestands. 


SALV. 


You 
ask 
a 
rational 
question, 
and 
answering 
to 
the 
Objection, 
Many 
things 
may 
remain 
as 
yet 
unobserved 
in 
Astronomy. 
I 
say; 
That 
although 
Astronomy 
in 
the 
courses 
of 
many 
ages 
hath 
made 
a 
great 
progress 
in 
discovering 
the 
constitution 
and 
motions 
of 
the 
Celestial 
bodies, 
yet 
is 
it 
not 
hitherto 
arrived 
at 
that 
height, 
but 
that 
very 
many 
things 
remain 
undecided, 
and 
haply 
many 
others 
also 
undiscovered. 
It 
is 
to 
be 
supposed 
that 
the 
first 
observers 
of 
Heaven 
knew 
no 
more 
but 
one 
motion 
common 
to 
all 
the 
Stars, 
as 
is 
this 
diurnal 
one: 
yet 
I 
believe 
that 
in 
few 
dayes 
they 
perceived 
that 
the 
Moon 
was 
inconstant 
in 
keeping 
company 
with 
the 
other 
Stars; 
but 
yet 



withal, 
that 
many 
years 
past, 
before 
that 
they 
distinguished 
all 
the 
Planets: 
And 
in 
particular, 
Saturn 
for 
its 
slowness, 
and 
Mercury 
for 
its 
rareness 
of 
appearing 
were 
amongst 
those 
that 
were 
last 
observed. 
I 
conceit 
that 
Saturn 
by 
its 
slowness, 
and 
Mercury 
by 
reason 
of 
its 
seldom 
appearing, 
were 
the 
last 
that 
were 
observed 
to 
be 
wandring 
and 
errant. 
It 
is 
to 
be 
thought 
that 
many 
more 
years 
run 
out 
before 
the 
statio 
s 
and 
retrogradations 
of 
the 
three 
superiour 
Planets 
were 
known, 
as 
also 
their 
approximations 
and 
recessions 
from 
the 
Earth, 
necessary 
occasions 
of 
introducing 
the 
Eccentrix 
and 
Epicicles, 
things 
unknown 
even 
to 
Aristotle, 
for 
that 
he 
makes 
no 
mention 
thereof. 
Mercury, 
and 
Venus, 
with 
their 
admirable 
apparitions; 
how 
long 
did 
they 
keep 
Astronomers 
in 
suspence, 
before 
that 
they 
could 
resolve 
(not 
to 
speak 
of 
any 
other 
of 
their 
qualities) 
upon 
their 
situation? 
Insomuch 
that 
the 
very 
order 
onely 
of 
the 
Mundane 
bodies, 
and 
the 
integral 
structure 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Universe 
by 
us 
known, 
hath 
been 
doubted 
of 
untill 
the 
time 
of 
Copernicus, 
who 
hath 
at 
last 
given 
us 
notice 
of 
the 
true 
constitution, 
and 
real 
systeme, 
according 
to 
which 
those 
parts 
are 
disposed; 
so 
that 
at 
length 
we 
are 
certain 
that 
Mercury, 
Venus, 
and 
the 
other 
Planets 
do 
revolve 
about 
the 
Sun; 
and 
that 
the 
Moon 
revolveth 
about 
the 
Earth. 
But 
how 
each 
Planet 
governeth 
it 
self 
in 
its 
particular 
revolution, 
Particular 
structures 
of 
the 
Orbs 
of 
the 
Planets 
not 
yet 
well 
resolved. 
and 
how 
precisely 
the 
structure 
of 
its 
Orb 
is 
framed; 
which 
is 
that 
which 
is 
vulgarly 
called 
the 
Theory 
of 
the 
Planets, 
we 
cannot 
as 
yet 
undoubtedly 
resolve. 
Mars, 
that 
hath 
so 
much 
puzled 
our 
Modern 
Astronomers, 
is 
a 
proof 
of 
this: 
And 
to 
the 
Moon 
her 
self 
there 
have 
been 
assigned 
several 
Theories, 
after 
that 
the 
said 
Copernicus 
had 
much 
altered 
it 
from 
that 
of 
Ptolomy. 
And 
to 
descend 
to 
our 
particular 
case, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
to 
the 
apparent 
motion 
of 
the 
Sun 
and 
Moon; 
touching 
the 
former, 
there 
hath 
been 
observed 
a 
certain 
great 
irregularity, 
whereby 
it 
passeth 
the 
two 
semicircles 
of 
the 
Ecliptick, 
The 
Sun 
passeth 
one 
half 
of 
the 
Zodiack 
nine 
days 
sooner 
than 
the 
other. 
divided 
by 
the 
points 
of 
the 
Equinoxes 
in 
very 
different 
times; 
in 
passing 
one 
of 
which, 
it 
spendeth 
about 
nine 
dayes 
more 
than 
in 
passing 
the 
other; 
a 
difference, 
as 
you 
see, 
very 
great 
and 
notable. 
But 
if 
in 
passing 
small 
arches, 
such 
for 
example 
as 
are 
the 
twelve 
Signs, 
he 
maintain 
a 
most 
regular 
motion, 
or 
else 
proceed 
with 
paces, 
one 
while 
a 
little 
more 
swift, 
and 
another 
more 
slow, 
as 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
it 
do, 
in 
case 
the 
annual 
motion 
belong 
to 
the 
Sun 
onely 
in 
appearance, 
but 
in 
reality 
to 
the 
Earth 
in 
company 
with 
the 
Moon, 
it 
is 
what 
hath 
not 
hitherto 
been 
observed, 
The 
Moons 
motion 
principally 
sought 
in 
the 
account 
of 



Eclipses. 
nor 
it 
may 
be, 
sought. 
Touching 
the 
Moon 
in 
the 
next 
place, 
whose 
restitutions 
have 
been 
principally 
lookt 
into 
an 
account 
of 
the 
Eclipses, 
for 
which 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
have 
an 
exact 
knowledge 
of 
its 
motion 
about 
the 
Earth, 
it 
hath 
not 
been 
likewise 
with 
a 
perfect 
curiosity 
inquired, 
what 
it 
course 
is 
thorow 
the 
particular 
archesofthe 
Zodiack. 
That 
thereforethe 
Earth 
and 
Moon 
in 
running 
through 
the 
Zodiack, 
that 
is 
round 
the 
Grand 
Orb, 
do 
somewhat 
accellerate 
at 
the 
Moons 
change, 
and 
retard 
at 
its 
full, 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
doubted; 
for 
that 
the 
said 
difference 
is 
not 
manifest, 
which 
cometh 
to 
be 
unobserved 
upon 
two 
accounts; 
First, 
Because 
it 
hath 
not 
been 
lookt 
for. 
Secondly, 
Because 
that 
its 
possible 
it 
may 
not 
be 
very 
great. 
Nor 
is 
there 
any 
need 
that 
it 
should 
be 
great, 
for 
the 
producing 
the 
effect 
that 
we 
see 
in 
the 
alteration 
of 
the 
greatness 
of 
ebbings 
and 
flowings. 
Ebbings 
and 
flowings 
are 
petty 
things 
in 
comparison 
of 
the 
vastness 
of 
Seas 
and 
of 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe. 
For 
not 
onely 
those 
alterations, 
but 
the 
Tides 
themselves 
are 
but 
small 
matters 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
grandure 
of 
the 
subjects 
on 
which 
they 
work; 
albeit 
that 
to 
us, 
and 
to 
our 
littleness 
they 
seem 
great. 
For 
the 
addition 
or 
subduction 
of 
one 
degree 
of 
velocity 
where 
there 
are 
naturally 
700, 
or 
1000, 
can 
be 
called 
no 
great 
alteration, 
either 
in 
that 
which 
conferreth 
it, 
or 
in 
that 
Which 
receiveth 
it: 
the 
Water 
of 
our 
Mediterrane 
carried 
about 
by 
the 
diurnal 
revolution, 
maketh 
about 
700 
miles 
an 
hour, 
(which 
is 
the 
motion 
common 
to 
the 
Earth 
and 
to 
it, 
and 
therefore 
not 
perceptible 
to 
us) 
& 
that 
which 
we 
sensibly 
discern 
to 
be 
made 
in 
the 
streams 
or 
currents, 
is 
not 
at 
the 
rate 
of 
full 
one 
mile 
an 
hour, 
(I 
speak 
of 
the 
main 
Seas, 
and 
not 
of 
the 
Straights) 
and 
this 
is 
that 
which 
altereth 
the 
first, 
naturall, 
and 
grand 
motion; 
and 
this 
motion 
is 
very 
great 
in 
respect 
of 
us, 
and 
of 
Ships: 
for 
a 
Vessel 
that 
in 
a 
standing 
Water 
by 
the 
help 
of 
Oares 
can 
make 
v. 
g. 
three 
miles 
an 
hour, 
in 
that 
same 
current 
will 
row 
twice 
as 
far 
with 
the 
stream 
as 
against 
it: 
A 
notable 
difference 
in 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Boat, 
though 
but 
very 
small 
in 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Sea, 
which 
is 
altered 
but 
its 
seven 
hundredth 
part. 
The 
like 
I 
say 
of 
its 
rising, 
and 
falling 
one, 
two, 
or 
three 
feet; 
and 
scarcely 
four 
or 
five 
in 
the 
utmost 
bounds 
of 
a 
streight, 
two 
thousand, 
or 
more 
miles 
long, 
and 
where 
there 
are 
depths 
of 
hundreds 
of 
feet; 
this 
alteration 
is 
much 
less 
than 
if 
in 
one 
of 
the 
Boats 
that 
bring 
us 
fresh 
Water, 
the 
said 
Water 
upon 
the 
arrest 
of 
the 
Boat 
should 
rise 
at 
the 
Prow 
the 
thickness 
of 
a 
leaf. 
I 
conclude 
therefore 
that 
very 
small 
alterations 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
immense 
greatness, 
and 
extraordinary 
velocity 
of 
the 
Seas, 
is 
sufficient 
to 
make 
therein 
great 
mutationsinrelationto 
our 
smallness,and 
toouraccidents. 



SAGR. 


I 
am 
fully 
satisfied 
as 
to 
this 
particular; 
it 
remains 
to 
declare 
unto 
us 
how 
those 
additions 
and 
substractions 
derived 
from 
the 
diurnal 
Vertigo 
are 
made 
one 
while 
greater,and 
anotherwhilelesser; 
fromwhichalterationsyou 
hinted 
that 
the 
annual 
period 
of 
the 
augmentations 
and 
diminutions 
of 
the 
ebbings 
and 
flowingsdiddepend. 


SALV. 


I 
will 
use 
my 
utmost 
endeavours 
to 
render 
my 
self 
intelligible, 
The 
causes 
of 
the 
inequality 
of 
the 
additions 
and 
substractions 
of 
the 
diurnal 
conversion 
from 
the 
annual 
motion. 
but 
the 
difficulty 
of 
the 
accident 
it 
self, 
and 
the 
great 
attention 
of 
mind 
requisite 
for 
the 
comprehending 
of 
it, 
constrains 
me 
to 
be 
obscure. 
The 
unequalities 
of 
the 
additions 
and 
substractions, 
that 
the 
diurnal 
motion 
maketh 
to 
or 
from 
the 
annual 
dependeth 
upon 
the 
inclination 
of 
the 
Axis 
of 
the 
diurnal 
motion 
upon 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
Grand 
Orb, 
or, 
if 
you 
please, 
of 
the 
Ecliptick; 
by 
means 
of 
which 
inclination 
the 
Equinoctial 
intersecteth 
thesaidEcliptick,remaining 
inclined 
andoblique 
upon 
the 
same 
accordingto 
the 
said 
inclination 
of 
Axis. 
And 
the 
quantity 
of 
the 
additions 
importeth

but 
being 
out 
of 
them 
it 
importeth

and 
lesse, 
according 
as 
the 
said 
centre 
successively 
approacheth 
to 
the 
points 
of 
the

where 
those 
additions 
are

SALV. 


I 
have 
already 
foretold 
it. 
Neverthelesse 
we 
will 
try 
whether 
by 
drawing 
a 
Diagram 
thereof, 
we 
can 
give 
some 
small 
light 
to 
the 
same; 
though 
indeed 
it 
might 
better 
be 
set 
forth 
by 
solid 
bodies 
than 
by 
bare 
Schemes; 
yet 
we 
will 
help 
our 
selves 
with 
Perspective 
and 
fore-shortning. 
Let 
us 
draw 
therefore, 
as 
before, 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
Grand 
Orb, 
[as 
in 
Fig. 
4. 
] 
in 
which 
the 
point 
A 
is 
understood 
to 
be 
one 
of 
the 
Solstitials, 
and 
the 
diameter 
AP 
the 
common 



Section 
of 
the 
Solstitial 
Colure, 
and 
of 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
Grand 
Orb 
or 
Ecliptick; 
and 
in 
that 
same 
point 
A 
let 
us 
suppose 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe 
to 
be 
placed, 
the 
Axis 
of 
which 
CAB, 
inclined 
upon 
the 
Plane 
of 
the 
Grand 
Orb, 
falleth 
on 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
said 
Colure 
that 
passeth 
thorow 
both 
the 
Axis 
of 
the 
Equinoctial, 
and 
of 
the 
Ecliptick. 
And 
for 
to 
prevent 
confusion, 
let 
us 
only 
draw 
the 
Equinoctial 
circle, 
marking 
it 
with 
these 
characters 
DGEF, 
the 
common 
section 
of 
which, 
with 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
grand 
Orb, 
let 
be 
the 
line 
DE, 
so 
that 
half 
of 
the 
said 
Equinoctial 
DFE 
will 
remain 
inclined 
below 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
Grand 
Orb, 
and 
the 
other 
half 
DGE 
elevated 
above. 
Let 
now 
the 
Revolution 
of 
the 
said 
Equinoctial 
be 
made, 
according 
to 
theorder 
ofthe 
points 
DGEF, 
and 
themotion 
of 
the 
centre 
fromAtowards 
E. 
And 
because 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth 
being 
in 
A, 
the 
Axis 
CB 
(which 
is 
erect 
upon 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
Equinoctial 
DE) 
falleth, 
as 
hath 
been 
said, 
in 
the 
Solstitial 
Colure, 
the 
common 
Section 
of 
which 
and 
of 
the 
Grand 
Orb, 
is 
the 
diameter 
PA, 
the 
said 
line 
PA 
shall 
be 
perpendicular 
to 
the 
same 
DE, 
by 
reason 
that 
the 
Colure 
is 
erect 
upon 
the 
grand 
Orb; 
and 
therefore 
the 
said 
DE, 
shall 
be 
the 
Tangent 
of 
the 
grand 
Orb 
in 
the 
point 
A. 
So 
that 
in 
this 
Position 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Centre 
by 
the 
arch 
AE; 
that 
is, 
of 
one 
degree 
every 
day 
differeth 
very 
little; 
yea, 
is 
as 
if 
it 
were 
made 
by 
the 
Tangent 
DAE. 
And 
because 
by 
means 
of 
the 
diurnal 
motion 
the 
point 
D, 
carried 
about 
by 
G, 
unto 
E, 
encreaseth 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Centre 
moved 
almost 
in 
the 
same 
line 
DE, 
as 
much 
as 
the 
whole 
diameter 
DE 
amounts 
unto; 
and 
on 
the 
other 
side 
diminisheth 
as 
much, 
moving 
about 
the 
other 
semicircle 
EFD. 
The 
additions 
and 
subductions 
in 
this 
place 
therefore, 
that 
is 
in 
the 
time 
of 
the 
solstice, 
shall 
bemeasuredby 
thewholediameterDE. 


Let 
us 
in 
the 
next 
place 
enquire, 
Whether 
they 
be 
of 
the 
same 
bigness 
in 
the 
times 
of 
the 
Equinoxes; 
and 
transporting 
the 
Centre 
of 
the 
Earth 
to 
the 
point 
I, 
distant 
a 
Quadrant 
of 
a 
Circle 
from 
the 
point 
A. 
Let 
us 
suppose 
the 
said 
Equinoctial 
to 
be 
GEFD, 
its 
common 
section 
with 
the 
grand 
Orb 
DE, 
the 
Axis 
with 
the 
same 
inclination 
CB; 
but 
the 
Tangent 
of 
the 
grand 
Orb 
in 
the 
pointI 
shallbe 
no 
longer 
DE, 
butanother 
which 
shallcut 
that 
atright 
Angles; 
and 
let 
it 
be 
this 
marked 
HIL, 
according 
to 
which 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Centre 
I, 
shall 
make 
its 
progress, 
proceeding 
along 
the 
circumference 
of 
this 
grand 
Orb. 
Now 
in 
this 
state 
the 
Additions 
and 
Substractions 
are 
no 
longer 
measured 
by 
the 
diameter 
DE, 
as 
before 
was 
done; 
because 
that 
diameter 
not 
distending 
it 
self 
according 
to 
the 
line 
of 
the 
annual 
motion 
HL, 
rather 
cutting 



it 
at 
right 
angles, 
those 
terms 
DE, 
do 
neither 
add 
nor 
substract 
any 
thing; 
but 
the 
Additions 
and 
Substractons 
are 
to 
be 
taken 
from 
that 
diameter 
that 
falleth 
in 
the 
plane 
that 
is 
errect 
upon 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
grand 
Orb, 
and 
that 
intersects 
it 
according 
to 
the 
line 
HL; 
which 
diameter 
in 
this 
case 
shall 
be 
this 
GF 
and 
the 
Adjective, 
if 
I 
may 
so 
say, 
shall 
be 
that 
made 
by 
the 
point 
G, 
about 
the 
semicircle 
GEF, 
and 
the 
Ablative 
shall 
be 
the 
rest 
made 
by 
the 
other 
semicircle 
FDG. 
Now 
this 
diameter, 
as 
not 
being 
in 
the 
same 
line 
HL 
of 
the 
annual 
motion, 
but 
rather 
cutting 
it, 
as 
we 
see 
in 
the 
point 
I, 
the 
term 
G 
being 
elevated 
above, 
and 
E 
depressed 
below 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
grand 
Orb, 
doth 
not 
determine 
the 
Additions 
and 
Substractions 
according 
to 
its 
whole 
length, 
but 
the 
quantity 
of 
those 
first 
ought 
to 
be 
taken 
from 
the 
part 
of 
the 
line 
HL, 
that 
is 
intercepted 
between 
the 
perpendiculars 
drawn 
upon 
it 
from 
the 
terms 
GF; 
namely, 
these 
two 
GS, 
and 
FV: 
So 
that 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
additions 
is 
the 
line 
SV 
lesser 
then 
GF, 
or 
then 
DE; 
which 
was 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
additions 
in 
the 
Solstice 
A. 
And 
so 
successively, 
according 
as 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
Earth 
shall 
be 
constituted 
in 
other 
points 
of 
the 
Quadrant 
AI, 
drawing 
the 
Tangents 
in 
the 
said 
points, 
and 
the 
perpendiculars 
upon 
the 
same 
falling 
from 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
diameters 
of 
the 
Equinoctial 
drawn 
from 
the 
errect 
planes 
by 
the 
said 
Tangents 
to 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
grand 
Orb; 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
said 
Tangents 
(which 
shall 
continually 
be 
lesser 
towards 
the 
Equinoctials, 
and 
greater 
towards 
the 
Solstices) 
shall 
give 
us 
the 
quantities 
of 
the 
additions 
and 
substractions. 
How 
much 
in 
the 
next 
place 
the 
least 
additions 
differ 
from 
the 
greatest, 
is 
easie 
to 
be 
known, 
because 
there 
is 
the 
same 
difference 
betwixt 
them, 
as 
between 
the 
whole 
Axis 
or 
Diameter 
of 
the 
Sphere, 
and 
the 
part 
thereof 
that 
lyeth 
between 
the 
Polar-Circles; 
the 
which 
is 
less 
than 
the 
whole 
diameter 
by 
very 
near 
a 
twelfth 
part, 
supposing 
yet 
that 
we 
speak 
of 
the 
additions 
and 
substractions 
made 
in 
the 
Equinoctial; 
but 
in 
the 
other 
Parallels 
theyarelesser,accordingastheir 
diametersdo 
diminish. 


This 
is 
all 
that 
I 
have 
to 
say 
upon 
this 
Argument, 
and 
all 
perhaps 
that 
can 
fall 
under 
the 
comprehension 
of 
our 
knowledge, 
which, 
as 
you 
well 
know, 
may 
not 
entertain 
any 
conclusions, 
save 
onely 
those 
that 
are 
firm 
and 
constant, 
such 
as 
are 
the 
three 
kinds 
of 
Periods 
of 
the 
ebbings 
and 
flowings; 
for 
that 
they 
depend 
on 
causes 
that 
are 
invariabl 
, 
simple, 
and 
eternal. 
But 
because 
that 
secondary 
and 
particular 
causes, 
able 
to 
make 
many 
alterations, 
intermix 
with 
these 
that 
are 
the 
primary 
and 
universal; 
and 
these 
secondary 
causes 
being 
part 
of 
them 
inconstant, 
and 
not 
to 
be 
observed; 
as 
for 
example, 
The 



alteration 
of 
Winds, 
and 
part 
(though 
terminate 
and 
fixed) 
unobserved 
for 
their 
multiplicity, 
as 
are 
the 
lengths 
of 
the 
Straights, 
their 
various 
inclinations 
towards 
this 
or 
that 
part, 
the 
so 
many 
and 
so 
different 
depths 
of 
the 
Waters, 
who 
shall 
be 
able, 
unless 
after 
very 
long 
observations, 
and 
very 
certain 
relations, 
to 
frame 
so 
expeditious 
Histories 
thereof, 
as 
that 
they 
may 
serve 
for 
Hypotheses, 
and 
certain 
suppositions 
to 
such 
as 
will 
by 
their 
combinations 
give 
adequate 
reasons 
of 
all 
the 
appearances, 
and 
as 
I 
may 
say, 
Anomalie, 
and 
particular 
irregularities 
that 
may 
be 
discovered 
in 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
Waters? 
Iwillcontentmyselfwith 
advertisingyou,thatthe 
accidentalcauses 
are 
in 
nature, 
and 
are 
able 
to 
produce 
many 
alterations; 
for 
the 
more 
minute 
observations, 
I 
remit 
them 
to 
be 
made 
by 
those 
that 
frequent 
several 
Seas: 
and 
onely 
by 
way 
of 
a 
conclusion 
to 
this 
our 
conference, 
I 
will 
propose 
to 
be 
considered, 
how 
that 
the 
precise 
times 
of 
the 
fluxes 
and 
refluxes 
do 
not 
onely 
happen 
to 
be 
altered 
by 
the 
length 
of 
Straights, 
and 
by 
the 
difference 
of 
depths; 
but 
I 
believe 
that 
a 
notable 
alteration 
may 
also 
proceed 
from 
the 
comparing 
together 
of 
sundry 
tarcts 
of 
Sea, 
different 
in 
greatness; 
and 
in 
position, 
or, 
if 
you 
will, 
inclination; 
which 
difference 
happeneth 
exactly 
here 
in 
the 
Adriatick 
Gulph, 
lesse 
by 
far 
than 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
Mediterrane, 
and 
placed 
in 
so 
different 
an 
inclination, 
that 
whereas 
that 
hath 
its 
bounds 
that 
incloseth 
it 
on 
the 
Eastern 
part, 
as 
are 
the 
Coasts 
ofSyria, 
this 
is 
shutup 
in 
its 
more 
Westerly 
part: 
and 
because 
the 
ebbings 
and 
flowings 
are 
much 
greater 
towards 
the 
extremities, 
yea, 
because 
the 
Seas 
risings 
and 
fallings 
are 
there 
onely 
greatest, 
it 
may 
probably 
happen 
that 
the 
times 
of 
Flood 
at 
Venice 
may 
be 
the 
time 
of 
low 
Water 
in 
the 
other 
Sea, 
which, 
as 
being 
much 
greater, 
and 
distended 
more 
directly 
from 
West 
to 
East, 
cometh 
in 
a 
certain 
sort 
to 
have 
dominion 
overthe 
Adriatick: 
and 
therefore 
it 
would 
be 
nowonder,in 
case 
the 
effects 
depending 
on 
the 
primary 
causes, 
should 
not 
hold 
true 
in 
the 
times 
that 
they 
ought, 
and 
that 
correspond 
to 
the 
periods 
in 
the 
Adriatick, 
as 
it 
doth 
in 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
Mediterrane. 
But 
these 
Particularities 
require 
long 
Observations, 
which 
I 
neither 
have 
made 
as 
yet, 
nor 
shall 
I 
ever 
be 
able 
to 
makethesamefor 
the 
future. 


SAGR. 


You 
have, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
done 
enough 
in 
opening 
us 
the 
way 
to 
so 
lofty 
a 
speculation, 
of 
which, 
if 
you 
had 
given 
us 
no 
more 
than 
that 
first 
general 
Proposition 
that 
seemeth 
to 
me 
to 
admit 
of 
no 
reply, 
where 
you 
declare 
very 



rationally, 
that 
the 
Vessels 
containing 
the 
Sea-waters 
continuing 
stedfast, 
it 
would 
be 
impossible, 
according 
to 
the 
common 
course 
of 
Nature, 
that 
those 
motions 
should 
follow 
in 
them 
which 
we 
see 
do 
follow; 
and 
that, 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
granting 
the 
motions 
ascribed, 
for 
other 
respects, 
by 
Copernicus 
to 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe, 
these 
same 
alterations 
ought 
to 
ensue 
in 
the 
Seas, 
if 
I 
say 
you 
had 
told 
us 
no 
more, 
this 
alone 
in 
my 
judgment, 
so 
far 
exceeds 
the 
vanities 
introduced 
by 
so 
many 
others, 
that 
my 
meer 
looking 
on 
them 
makes 
me 
nauseate 
them, 
and 
I 
very 
much 
admire, 
that 
among 
men 
of 
sublime 
wit, 
of 
which 
nevertheless 
there 
are 
not 
a 
few, 
not 
one 
hath 
ever 
considered 
the 
incompatibility 
that 
is 
between 
the 
reciprocal 
motion 
of 
the 
Water 
contained, 
and 
the 
immobility 
of 
the 
Vessel 
containing, 
which 
contradiction 
seemeth 
to 
menowsomanifest. 


SALV. 


It 
is 
more 
to 
be 
admired, 
One 
single 
motion 
of 
the 
terrestrial 
Globe 
sufficeth 
not 
to 
produce 
the 
Ebbing 
& 
Flowing 
that 
it 
having 
come 
into 
the 
thoughts 
of 
some 
to 
refer 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
Tide 
to 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth, 
therein 
shewing 
a 
more 
than 
common 
apprehension, 
they 
should, 
in 
afterwards 
driving 
home 
the 
motion 
close 
with 
no 
side; 
and 
all, 
because 
they 
did 
not 
see 
that 
one 
simple 
and 
uniform 
motion, 
as 
v. 
gr. 
the 
sole 
diurnal 
motion 
of 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe, 
doth 
not 
suffice, 
but 
that 
there 
is 
required 
an 
uneven 
motion, 
one 
while 
accelerated, 
and 
another 
while 
retarded: 
for 
when 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Vessels 
are 
uniforme, 
the 
waters 
contained 
will 
habituate 
themselves 
thereto, 
without 
ever 
making 
any 
alteration. 
To 
say 
also 
(as 
it 
is 
related 
of 
an 
ancient 
Mathematician) 
that 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth 
meeting 
with 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Lunar 
Orb, 
The 
opinion 
of 
Seleucus 
the 
Mathematician 
censured. 
the 
concurrence 
of 
them 
occasioneth 
the 
Ebbing 
and 
Flowing, 
is 
an 
absolute 
vanity, 
not 
onely 
because 
it 
is 
not 
exprest, 
nor 
seen 
how 
it 
should 
so 
happen, 
but 
the 
falsity 
is 
obvious, 
for 
that 
the 
Revolution 
of 
the 
Earth 
is 
not 
contrary 
to 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Moon, 
but 
is 
towards 
the 
same 
way. 
So 
that 
all 
that 
hath 
been 
hitherto 
said, 
and 
imagined 
by 
others, 
is, 
in 
my 
judgment, 
altogether 
invalid. 
But 
amongst 
all 
the 
famous 
men 
that 
have 
philosophated 
upon 
this 
admirable 
effect 
of 
Nature, 
Kepler 
is 
with 
respect 
blamed. 
I 
more 
wonder 
at 
Kepler 
than 
any 
of 
the 
rest, 
who 
being 
of 
a 
free 
and 
piercing 
wit, 
and 
having 
the 
motion 
ascribed 
to 
the 
Earth, 
before 



him, 
hath 
for 
all 
that 
given 
his 
ear 
and 
assent 
to 
the 
Moons 
predominancy 
overtheWater,and 
tooccult 
properties, 
andsuch 
liketrifles. 


SAGR. 


I 
am 
of 
opinion, 
that 
to 
these 
more 
spaculative 
persons 
the 
same 
happened, 
that 
at 
present 
befalls 
me, 
namely, 
the 
not 
understanding 
the 
intricate 
commixtion 
of 
the 
three 
Periods 
Annual, 
Monethly, 
and 
Diurnal; 
And 
how 
their 
causes 
should 
seem 
to 
depend 
on 
the 
Sun, 
and 
on 
the 
Moon, 
without 
the 
Suns 
or 
Moons 
having 
any 
thing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
Water; 
a 
businesse, 
for 
the 
full 
understanding 
of 
which 
I 
stand 
in 
need 
of 
a 
little 
longer 
time 
to 
consider 
thereof, 
which 
the 
novelty 
and 
difficulty 
of 
it 
hath 
hitherto 
hindred 
me 
from 
doing: 
but 
I 
despair 
not, 
but 
that 
when 
I 
return 
in 
my 
solitude 
and 
silence 
to 
ruminate 
that 
which 
remaineth 
in 
my 
fancy, 
not 
very 
well 
digested, 
I 
shall 
make 
it 
my 
own. 
We 
have 
now, 
from 
these 
four 
dayes 
Discourse, 
great 
attestations, 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
Copernican 
Systeme, 
amongst 
which 
these 
three 
taken: 
the 
first, 
from 
the 
Stations 
and 
Retrogradations 
of 
the 
Planets, 
and 
from 
their 
approaches, 
and 
recessions 
from 
the 
Earth; 
the 
second, 
from 
the 
Suns 
revolving 
in 
it 
self, 
and 
from 
what 
is 
observed 
in 
its 
spots; 
the 
third, 
from 
the 
Ebbing 
and 
Flowing 
of 
the 
Sea 
do 
shew 
very 
rational 
and 
concluding. 


SALV. 


To 
which 
also 
haply, 
in 
short, 
one 
might 
adde 
a 
fourth, 
and 
peradventure 
a 
fifth; 
a 
fourth, 
I 
say, 
taken 
from 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
seeing 
that 
in 
them, 
upon 
exact 
observations, 
those 
minute 
mutations 
appear, 
that 
Copernicus 
thought 
to 
have 
been 
insensible. 
There 
starts 
up, 
at 
this 
instant, 
a 
fifth 
novelty, 
from 
which 
one 
may 
argue 
mobility 
in 
the 
Terrestrial 
Globe, 
by 
means 
of 
that 
which 
the 
most 
Illustrious 
Signore 
Caesare, 
Sig. 
Caesare 
Marsilius 
observeth 
the 
Meridian 
to 
be 
moveable. 
of 
the 
noble 
Family 
of 
the 
Marsilii 
of 
Bologna, 
and 
a 
Lyncean 
Academick, 
discovereth 
with 
much 
ingenuity, 
who 
in 
a 
very 
learned 
Tract 
of 
his, 
sheweth 
very 
particularly 
how 
that 
he 
had 
observed 
a 
continual 
mutation, 
though 
very 
slow 
in 
the 
Meridian 
line, 
of 
which 
Treatise, 
at 
length, 
with 
amazement, 
perused 
by 
me, 
I 
hope 
he 
will 
communicate 
Copiesto

This 
is 
not 
the 
first 
time 
that 
I 
have 
heard 
speak 
of 
the 
exquisite 
Learning 
of 
this 
Gentleman, 
and 
of 
his 
shewing 
himself 
a 
zealous 
Patron

if 
this, 
or 
any 
other 
of 
his 
Works 
shall 
come 
to 
appear 
in 
publique, 
we 
may 
be 
aforehand 
assured, 
that 
they 
will 
be 
received, 
as 
things 
ofgreatvalue. 


SALV. 


Now 
because 
it 
is 
time 
to 
put 
an 
end 
to 
our 
Discourses, 
it 
remaineth, 
that 
I 
intreat 
you, 
that 
if, 
at 
more 
leasure 
going 
over 
the 
things 
again 
that 
have 
been 
alledged 
you 
meet 
with 
any 
doubts, 
or 
scruples 
not 
well 
resolved, 
you 
will 
excuse 
my 
oversight, 
as 
well 
for 
the 
novelty 
of 
the 
Notion, 
as 
for 
the 
weaknesse 
of 
my 
wit, 
as 
also 
for 
the 
grandure 
of 
the 
Subject, 
as 
also 
finally, 
because 
I 
do 
not, 
nor 
have 
pretended 
to 
that 
assent 
from 
others, 
which 
I 
my 
self 
do 
not 
give 
to 
this 
conceit, 
which 
I 
could 
very 
easily 
grant 
to 
be 
a 
Chymaera, 
and 
a 
meer 
paradox; 
and 
you 
Sagredus, 
although 
in 
the 
Discourses 
past 
you 
have 
many 
times, 
with 
great 
applause, 
declared, 
that 
you 
were 
pleased 
with 
some 
of 
my 
conjectures, 
yet 
do 
I 
believe, 
that 
that 
was 
in 
part 
more 
occasioned 
by 
the 
novelty 
than 
by 
the 
certainty 
of 
them, 
but 
much 
more 
by 
your 
courtesie, 
which 
did 
think 
and 
desire, 
by 
its 
assent, 
to 
procure 
me 
that 
content 
which 
we 
naturally 
use 
to 
take 
in 
the 
approbation 
and 
applause 
of 
our 
own 
matters: 
and 
as 
your 
civility 
hath 
obliged

to 
you; 
so 
am 
I 
also 
pleased 
with 
the 
ingenuity 
of 
Simplicius. 
Nay, 
his 
constancy 
in 
maintaining 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
his 
Master, 
with 
so 
much 
strength 
& 
undauntedness, 
hath 
made 
me 
much 
to 
love 
him. 
And 
as 
I 
am 
to 
give 
you 
thanks,Sagredus,foryour 
courteousaffection; 
soofSimplicius,Iaskpardon, 
if 
I 
have 
sometimes 
moved 
him 
with 
my 
too 
bold 
and 
resolute 
speaking: 
and 
let 
him 
be 
assured 
that 
I 
have 
not 
done 
the 
same 
out 
of 
any 
inducement 
of 
sinister 
affection, 
but 
onely 
to 
give 
him 
occasion 
to 
set 
before 
us 
more 
lofty 
fanciesthat

There 
is 
no

why 
you

especially 
to

that

have 
an

the

not 
onely 
to 
grow 
hot 
and 
angry 
at 
one 
another, 
but 
likewise 
to 
break 
forth 
into 
injurious 
words,

sometimes 
to

DISCOURSES 
AND 
MATHEMATICAL 
DEMONSTRATIONS 
RELATING 
TO 
TWO 
NEW 
SCIENCES 



Translated 
by 
Henry 
Crew 
and 
Alfonso 
de 
Salvio 


The 
Discourses 
and 
Mathematical 
Demonstrations 
Relating 
to 
Two 
New 
Sciences 
was 
first 
published 
in 
Italian 
as 
Discorsi 
e 
Dimostrazioni 
Matematiche 
Intorno 
a 
Due 
Nuove 
Scienze 
in 
1638 
(see 
Figure 
1). 
But 
the 
circumstancesofitspublicationwerecomplex. 
Galileo,afterthejudgmentof 
the 
Inquisition, 
was 
under 
house 
arrest 
(which, 
ironically, 
had 
given 
him 
more 
time 
to 
write). 
Moreover, 
publication 
of 
his 
books 
was 
banned 
in 
Catholic 
countries, 
by 
1638 
he 
was 
completely 
blind, 
and 
his 
health 
was 
deteriorating. 
However, 
a 
visit 
to 
Venice 
from 
Louis 
Elsevier, 
from 
the 
protestant 
Netherlands, 
led 
to 
the 
book 
being 
published 
in 
Leiden. 
It 
was 
dedicated 
to 
the 
Comte 
de 
Noailles, 
who 
was 
instrumental 
in 
getting 
the 
manuscript 
from 
Italy 
to 
the 
Netherlands. 
“I 
had 
decided 
not 
to 
publish 
any 
more 
of 
my 
work. 
And 
yet, 
in 
order 
to 
save 
it 
from 
complete 
oblivion, 
it 
seemed 
to 
me 
wise 
to 
leave 
a 
manuscript 
copy 
in 
some 
place 
where 
it 
would 
be 
available 
at 
least 
to 
those 
who 
follow 
intelligently 
the 
subjects 
which 
I 
have 
treated. 
Accordingly 
I 
chose 
first 
to 
place 
my 
work 
in 
your 
Lordship’s 
hands, 
asking 
no 
more 
worthy 
depository, 
and 
believing 
that, 
on 
account 
of 
your 
affection 
for 
me, 
you 
would 
have 
at 
heart 
the 
preservation 
of 
my 
studies 
and 
labours. 
Therefore, 
when 
you 
were 
returning 
home 
from 
your 
mission 
to 
Rome, 
I 
came 
to 
pay 
my 
respects 
in 
person 
as 
I 
had 
already 
done 
many 
times 
before 
by 
letter. 
At 
this 
meeting, 
I 
presented 
to 
your 
Lordship 
a 
copy 
of 
these 
two 
works 
which 
at 
that 
time 
I 
happened 
to 
have 
ready. 
In 
the 
gracious 
reception 
which 
you 
gave 
these, 
I 
found 
assurance 
of 
their 
preservation. 
The 
fact 
of 
your 
carrying 
them 
to 
France 
and 
showing 
them 
to 
friends 
of 
yours 
who 
are 
skilled 
in 
these 
sciences 
gave 
evidence 
that 
my 
silence 
was 
not 
to 
be 
interpreted 
as 
complete 
idleness. 
A 
little 
later, 
just 
as 
I 
was 
on 
the 
point 
of 
sending 
other 
copies 
to 
Germany, 
Flanders, 
England, 
Spain 
and 
possibly 
to 
some 
places 
in 
Italy, 
I 
was 
notified 
by 
the 
Elzevirs 
that 
they 
had 
these 
works 
ofmineinpressand 
thatIoughttodecide 
upona 
dedication.” 



Two 
New 
Sciences, 
as 
it 
became 
popularly 
known, 
was 
to 
be 
Galileo’s 
final, 
and 
arguably 
most 
important, 
book. 
Appropriately, 
it 
discussed 
his 
key 
works 
over 
the 
previous 
four 
decades. 
Galileo 
did 
not 
like 
the 
published 
title 
of 
the 
book, 
preferring 
the 
more 
academic 
“Dialogues 
on 
Motion”, 
but 
he 
was 
given 
little 
choice 
by 
the 
publisher. 
The 
two 
new 
sciences 
discussed 
in 
the 
book 
are 
the 
mechanical 
strength 
of 
materials 
(including 
bone, 
laying 
foundations 
for 
modern 
biology) 
and 
kinematics. 
The 
clarity 
and 
rigour 
of 
his 
arguments, 
and 
his 
reliance 
on 
reproducible 
experimental 
data 
(made 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
a 
classical 
water 
clock), 
led 
to 
Einstein 
stating 
that 
“Propositions 
arrived 
at 
by 
purely 
logical 
means 
are 
completely 
empty 
as 
regards 
reality. 
Because 
Galileo 
realised 
this,and 
particularlybecause 
hedrummed 
itintothe 
scientific 
world, 
he 
is 
the 
father 
of 
modern 
physics 
— 
indeed, 
of 
modern 
sciencealtogether”. 


The 
book 
was 
constructed 
in 
a 
similar 
style 
to 
the 
earlier 
volume, 
The 
Dialogue 
Concerning 
the 
Two 
Chief 
World 
Systems. 
Galileo 
even 
used 
the 
same 
three 
proponents, 
(Salviati, 
Sagredo, 
and 
Simplicio, 
although 
now 
more 
mature 
and 
nuanced) 
to 
discuss, 
over 
four 
days, 
the 
key 
topics 
(see 
Figure 
2) 


– 
but 
now 
they 
are 
all 
clearly 
Galileo 
at 
different 
times 
of 
his 
life 
(Simplicio 
being 
his 
youngest 
self, 
and 
Salviati 
being 
the 
most 
mature). 
Topics 
discussed 
include 
a 
discussion 
of 
the 
concept 
of 
infinity, 
and 
detailed 
experimental 
and 
mathematical 
descriptions 
of 
bodies 
in 
motion, 
which 
anticipate 
the 
later 
work 
of 
Newton 
(who 
was 
born 
in 
the 
year 
that 
Galileo 
died, 
1642). 
This 
book 
has 
to 
be 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
works 
of 
science 
everpublished. 
As 
a 
postscript, 
Pope 
John 
Paul 
II 
stated, 
in 
1979, 
that 
the 
Church 
may 
have 
been 
in 
error 
when 
it 
condemned 
Galileo. 
Four 
years 
later, 
his 
commission 
reported 
that 
Galileo 
should 
not 
have 
been 
condemned, 
and 
in 
1992, 
the 
Pope 
endorsed 
the 
commission’s 
conclusion. 
Better 
late 
than 
never!

FOR 
more 
than 
a 
century 
English 
speaking 
students 
have 
been 
placed 
in 
the 
anomalous 
position 
of 
hearing 
Galileo 
constantly 
referred 
to 
as 
the 
founder 
of 
modern 
physical 
science, 
without 
having 
any 
chance 
to 
read, 
in 
their 
own 
language, 
what 
Galileo 
himself 
has 
to 
say. 
Archimedes 
has 
been 
made 
available 
by 
Heath; 
Huygens’ 
Light 
has 
been 
turned 
into 
English 
by 
Thompson, 
while 
Motte 
has 
put 
the 
Principia 
of 
Newton 
back 
into 
the 
language 
in 
which 
it 
was 
conceived. 
To 
render 
the 
Physics 
of 
Galileo 
also 
accessible 
to 
English 
and 
American 
students 
is 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
following 
translation. 


The 
last 
of 
the 
great 
creators 
of 
the 
Renaissance 
was 
not 
a 
prophet 
without 
honor 
in 
his 
own 
time; 
for 
it 
was 
only 
one 
group 
of 
his 
country-men 
that 
failed 
to 
appreciate 
him. 
Even 
during 
his 
life 
time, 
his 
Mechanics 
had 
been 
renderedintoFrenchbyoneoftheleadingphysicists 
oftheworld,Mersenne. 


Within 
twenty-five 
years 
after 
the 
death 
of 
Galileo, 
his 
Dialogues 
on 
Astronomy, 
and 
those 
on 
Two 
New 
Sciences, 
had 
been 
done 
into 
English 
by 
Thomas 
Salusbury 
and 
were 
worthily 
printed 
in 
two 
handsome 
quarto 
volumes. 
The 
Two 
New 
Sciences, 
which 
contains 
practically 
all 
that 
Galileo 
has 
to 
say 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
physics, 
issued 
from 
the 
English 
press 
in 
1665. 
It 
is 
supposed 
that 
most 
of 
the 
copies 
were 
destroyed 
in 
the 
great 
London 
fire 
which 
occurred 
in 
the 
year 
following. 
We 
are 
not 
aware 
of 
any 
copy 
in 
America:eventhatbelongingtotheBritishMuseumis 
animperfectone. 


Again 
in 
1730 
the 
Two 
New 
Sciences 
was 
done 
into 
English 
by 
Thomas 
Weston; 
but 
this 
book, 
now 
nearly 
two 
centuries 
old, 
is 
scarce 
and 
expensive. 
Moreover, 
the 
literalness 
with 
which 
this 
translation 
was 
made 
renders 
many 
passages 
either 
ambiguous 
or 
unintelligible 
to 
the 
modern 
reader. 
Other 
than 
thesetwo,noEnglishversionhasbeenmade. 


Quite 
recently 
an 
eminent 
Italian 
scholar, 
after 
spending 
thirty 
of 
the 
best 
years 
of 
his 
life 
upon 
the 
subject, 
has 
brought 
to 
completion 
the 
great 
National 
Edition 
of 
the 
Works 
of 
Galileo. 
We 
refer 
to 
the 
twenty 
superb 



volumes 
in 
which 
Professor 
Antonio 
Favaro 
of 
Padua 
has 
given 
a 
definitive 
presentation 
of 
the 
labors 
of 
the 
man 
who 
created 
the 
modern 
science 
of 
physics. 


The 
following 
rendition 
includes 
neither 
Le 
Mechaniche 
of 
Galileo 
nor 
his 
paper 
De 
Motu 
Accelerato, 
since 
the 
former 
of 
these 
contains 
little 
but 
the 
Statics 
which 
was 
current 
before 
the 
time 
of 
Galileo, 
and 
the 
latter 
is 
essentially 
included 
in 
the 
Dialogue 
of 
the 
Third 
Day. 
Dynamics 
was 
the 
one 
subject 
to 
which 
under 
various 
forms, 
such 
as 
Ballistics, 
Acoustics, 
Astronomy, 
he 
consistently 
and 
persistently 
devoted 
his 
whole 
life. 
Into 
the 
one 
volume 
here 
translated 
he 
seems 
to 
have 
gathered, 
during 
his 
last 
years, 
practically 
all 
that 
is 
of 
value 
either 
to 
the 
engineer 
or 
the 
physicist. 
The 
historian, 
the 
philosopher, 
and 
the 
astronomer 
will 
find 
the 
other 
volumes 
repletewithinterestingmaterial. 


It 
is 
hardly 
necessary 
to 
add 
that 
we 
have 
strictly 
followed 
the 
text 
of 
the 
National 
Edition 
—essentially 
the 
Elzeviredition 
of 
1638. 
All 
comments 
and 
annotations 
have 
been 
omitted 
save 
here 
and 
there 
a 
foot-note 
intended 
to 
economize 
thereader’s 
time. 
To 
each 
of 
these 
footnotes 
has 
been 
attached 
the 
signature 
[Trans.] 
in 
order 
to 
preserve 
the 
original 
as 
nearly 
intact 
as 
possible. 


Much 
of 
the 
value 
of 
any 
historical 
document 
lies 
in 
the 
language 
employed, 
and 
this 
is 
doubly 
true 
when 
one 
attempts 
to 
trace 
the 
rise 
and 
growth 
of 
any 
set 
of 
concepts 
such 
as 
those 
employed 
in 
modern 
physics. 
We 
have 
therefore 
made 
this 
translation 
as 
literal 
as 
is 
consistent 
with 
clearness 
and 
modernity. 
In 
cases 
where 
there 
is 
any 
important 
deviation 
from 
this 
rule, 
and 
in 
the 
case 
of 
many 
technical 
terms 
where 
there 
is 
no 
deviation 
from 
it, 
we 
have 
given 
the 
original 
Italian 
or 
Latin 
phrase 
in 
italics 
enclosed 
in 
square 
brackets. 
The 
intention 
here 
is 
to 
illustrate 
the 
great 
variety 
of 
terms 
employed 
by 
the 
early 
physicists 
to 
describe 
a 
single 
definite 
idea, 
and 
conversely, 
to 
illustrate 
the 
numerous 
senses 
in 
which, 
then 
as 
now, 
a 
single 
word 
is 
used. 
For 
the 
few 
explanatory 
English 
words 
which 
are 
placed 
in 
square 
brackets 
without 
italics, 
the 
translators 
alone 
are 
responsible. 
The 
paging 
of 
the 
National 
Edition 
is 
indicated 
in 
square 
brackets 
inserted 
along 
themedianlineofthe 
page. 


The 
imperfections 
of 
the 
following 
pages 
would 
have 
been 
many 
more 
but 
for 
the 
aid 
of 
three 
of 
our 
colleagues. 
Professor 
D. 
R. 
Curtiss 
was 
kind 
enough 
to 
assist 
in 
the 
translation 
of 
those 
pages 
which 
discuss 
the 
nature 
of 
Infinity: 
Professor 
O. 
H. 
Basquin 
gave 
valuable 
help 
in 
the

Introduction 


WRITING 
to 
his 
faithful 
friend 
Elia 
Diodati, 
Galileo 
speaks 
of 
the 
“New 
Sciences” 
which 
he 
had 
in 
mind 
to 
print 
as 
being 
“superior 
to 
everything 
else 
of 
mine 
hitherto 
published”; 
elsewhere 
he 
says 
“they 
contain 
results 
which 
I 
consider 
the 
most 
important 
of 
all 
my 
studies”; 
and 
this 
opinion 
which 
he 
expressed 
concerning 
his 
own 
work 
has 
been 
confirmed 
by 
posterity: 
the 
“New 
Sciences” 
are, 
indeed, 
the 
masterpiece 
of 
Galileo 
who 
at 
the 
time 
when 
he 
made 
the 
above 
remarks 
had 
spent 
upon 
them 
more 
than 
thirty 
laborious 
years. 


One 
who 
wishes 
to 
trace 
the 
history 
of 
this 
remarkable 
work 
will 
find 
that 
the 
great 
philosopher 
laid 
its 
foundations 
during 
the 
eighteen 
best 
years 
of 
his 
life 
— 
those 
which 
he 
spent 
at 
Padua. 
As 
we 
learn 
from 
his 
last 
scholar, 
Vincenzio 
Viviani, 
the 
numerous 
results 
at 
which 
Galileo 
had 
arrived 
while 
in 
this 
city, 
awakened 
intense 
admiration 
in 
the 
friends 
who 
had 
witnessed 
various 
experiments 
by 
means 
of 
which 
he 
was 
accustomed 
to 
investigate 
interesting 
questions 
in 
physics. 
Fra 
Paolo 
Sarpi 
exclaimed: 
To 
give 
us 
the 
Science 
of 
Motion, 
God 
and 
Nature 
have 
joined 
hands 
and 
created 
the 
intellect 
of 
Galileo. 
And 
when 
the 
“New 
Sciences” 
came 
from 
the 
press 
one 
of 
his 
foremost 
pupils, 
Paolo 
Aproino, 
wrote 
that 
the 
volume 
contained 
much 
which 
hehad 
“alreadyheard 
fromhisownlips” 
duringstudentdays 
atPadua. 


Limiting 
ourselves 
to 
only 
the 
more 
important 
documents 
which 
might 
be 
cited 
in 
support 
of 
our 
statement, 
it 
will 
suffice 
to 
mention 
the 
letter, 
written 
to 
Guidobaldo 
del 
Monte 
on 
the 
29th 
of 
November, 
1602, 
concerning 
the 
descent 
of 
heavy 
bodies 
along 
the 
arcs 
of 
circles 
and 
the 
chords 
subtended 
by 
them; 
that 
to 
Sarpi, 
dated 
16th 
of 
October, 
1604, 
dealing 
with 
the 
free 
fall 
of 
heavy 
bodies; 
the 
letter 
to 
Antonio 
de’ 
Medici 
on 
the 
11th 
of 
February, 
1609, 
in 
which 
he 
states 
that 
he 
has 
“completed 
all 
the 
theorems 
and 
demonstrations 
pertaining 
to 
forces 
and 
resistances 
of 
beams 
of 
various 
lengths, 
thicknesses 
and 
shapes, 
proving 
that 
they 
are 
weaker 
at 
the 
middle 
than 
near 
the 
ends, 
that 
they 
can 
carry 
a 
greater 
load 
when 
that 
load 
is 
distributed 
throughout 
the 
length 
of 
the 
beam 
than 
when 
concentrated 
at 
one 
point, 
demonstrating 
also 
what 
shape 
should 
be 
given 
to 
a 
beam 
in 
order 
that 
it 
may 
have 
the 
same 
bending 
strength 
at 
every 
point,” 
and 
that 
he 
was 
now 
engaged 
“upon 
some 
questions 
dealing 
with 
the 
motion 
of 
projectiles”; 
and 
finally 
in 
the 
letter 
to 
Belisario 
Vinta, 
dated 
7th 
of 
May, 
1610, 
concerning 
his 



return 
from 
Padua 
to 
Florence, 
he 
enumerates 
various 
pieces 
of 
work 
which 
were 
still 
to 
be 
completed, 
mentioning 
explicitly 
three 
books 
on 
an 
entirely 
new 
science 
dealing 
with 
the 
theory 
of 
motion. 
Although 
at 
various 
times 
afterthereturn 
tohisnative 
state 
hedevotedconsiderablethought 
tothework 
which, 
even 
at 
that 
date, 
he 
had 
in 
mind 
as 
is 
shown 
by 
certain 
fragments 
which 
clearly 
belong 
to 
different 
periods 
of 
his 
life 
and 
which 
have, 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
been 
published 
in 
the 
National 
Edition; 
and 
although 
these 
studies 
were 
always 
uppermost 
in 
his 
thought 
it 
does 
not 
appear 
that 
he 
gave 
himself 
seriously 
to 
them 
until 
after 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
Dialogue 
and 
the 
completion 
of 
that 
trial 
which 
was 
rightly 
described 
as 
the 
disgrace 
of 
the 
century. 
In 
fact 
as 
late 
as 
October, 
1630, 
he 
barely 
mentions 
to 
Aggiunti 
his 
discoveries 
in 
the 
theory 
of 
motion, 
and 
only 
two 
years 
later, 
in 
a 
letter 
to 
Marsili 
concerning 
the 
motion 
of 
projectiles, 
he 
hints 
at 
a 
book 
nearly 
ready 
forpublication 
in 
which 
he 
willtreat 
also 
of 
this 
subject;andonly 
ayear 
after 
this 
he 
writes 
to 
Arrighetti 
that 
he 
has 
in 
hand 
a 
treatise 
on 
the 
resistance 
of 
solids. 


But 
the 
work 
was 
given 
definite 
form 
by 
Galileo 
during 
his 
enforced 
residence 
at 
Siena: 
in 
these 
five 
months 
spent 
quietly 
with 
the 
Archbishop 
he 
himself 
writes 
that 
he 
has 
completed 
“a 
treatise 
on 
a 
new 
branch 
of 
mechanics 
full 
of 
interesting 
and 
useful 
ideas”; 
so 
that 
a 
few 
months 
later 
he 
was 
able 
to 
send 
word 
to 
Micanzio 
that 
the 
“work 
was 
ready”; 
as 
soon 
as 
his 
friends 
learned 
of 
this, 
they 
urged 
its 
publication. 
It 
was, 
however, 
no 
easy 
matter 
to 
print 
the 
work 
of 
a 
man 
already 
condemned 
by 
the 
Holy 
Office: 
and 
since 
Galileo 
could 
not 
hope 
to 
print 
it 
either 
in 
Florence 
or 
in 
Rome, 
he 
turned 
to 
the 
faithful 
Micanzio 
asking 
him 
to 
find 
out 
whether 
this 
would 
be 
possible 
in 
Venice, 
from 
whence 
he 
had 
received 
offers 
to 
print 
the 
Dialogue 
on 
the 
Principal 
Systems, 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
news 
had 
reached 
there 
that 
he 
was 
encountering 
difficulties. 
At 
first 
everything 
went 
smoothly; 
so 
that 
Galileo 
commenced 
sending 
to 
Micanzio 
some 
of 
the 
manuscript 
which 
was 
received 
by 
the 
latter 
with 
an 
enthusiasm 
in 
which 
he 
was 
second 
to 
none 
of 
the 
warmest 
admirers 
of 
the 
great 
philosopher. 
But 
when 
Micanzio 
consulted 
the 
Inquisitor, 
he 
received 
the 
answer 
that 
there 
was 
an 
express 
order 
prohibiting 
the 
printing 
or 
reprinting 
of 
any 
work 
of 
Galileo, 
either 
in 
Venice 
or 
in 
any 
otherplace, 
nullo 
excepto. 


As 
soon 
as 
Galileo 
received 
this 
discouraging 
news 
he 
began 
to 
look 
with 
more 
favor 
upon 
offers 
which 
had 
come 
to 
him 
from 
Germany 
where 
his 
friend, 
and 
perhaps 
also 
his 
scholar, 
Giovanni 
Battista 
Pieroni, 
was 
in 
the 



service 
of 
the 
Emperor, 
as 
military 
engineer; 
consequently 
Galileo 
gave 
to 
Prince 
Mattia 
de’ 
Medici 
who 
was 
just 
leaving 
for 
Germany 
the 
first 
two 
Dialogues 
to 
be 
handed 
to 
Pieroni 
who 
was 
undecided 
whether 
to 
publish 
them 
at 
Vienna 
or 
Prague 
or 
at 
some 
place 
in 
Moravia; 
in 
the 
meantime, 
however, 
he 
had 
obtained 
permission 
to 
print 
both 
at 
Vienna 
and 
at 
Olmütz. 
But 
Galileo 
recognized 
danger 
at 
every 
point 
within 
reach 
of 
the 
long 
arm 
of 
the 
Court 
of 
Rome; 
hence, 
availing 
himself 
of 
the 
opportunity 
offered 
by 
the 
arrival 
of 
Louis 
Elzevir 
in 
Italy 
in 
1636, 
also 
of 
the 
friendship 
between 
the 
latter 
and 
Micanzio, 
not 
to 
mention 
a 
visit 
at 
Arcetri, 
he 
decided 
to 
abandon 
all 
other 
plans 
and 
entrust 
to 
the 
Dutch 
publisher 
the 
printing 
of 
his 
new 
work 
the 
manuscript 
of 
which, 
although 
not 
complete, 
Elzevir 
took 
with 
him 
on 
his 
return 
home. 


In 
the 
course 
of 
the 
year 
1637, 
the 
printing 
was 
finished, 
and 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
following 
year 
there 
was 
lacking 
only 
the 
index, 
the 
title-
page 
and 
the 
dedication. 
This 
last 
had, 
through 
the 
good 
offices 
of 
Diodati, 
been 
offered 
to 
the 
Count 
of 
Noailles, 
a 
former 
scholar 
of 
Galileo 
at 
Padua, 
and 
since 
1634 
ambassador 
of 
France 
at 
Rome, 
a 
man 
who 
did 
much 
to 
alleviate 
the 
distressing 
consequences 
of 
the 
celebrated 
trial; 
and 
the 
offer 
was 
gratefully 
accepted. 
The 
phrasing 
of 
the 
dedication 
deserves 
brief 
comment. 
Since 
Galileo 
was 
aware, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
of 
the 
prohibition 
against 
the 
printing 
of 
his 
works 
and 
since, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
he 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
irritate 
the 
Court 
of 
Rome 
from 
whose 
hands 
he 
was 
always 
hoping 
for 
complete 
freedom, 
he 
pretends 
in 
the 
dedicatory 
letter 
(where, 
probably 
through 
excess 
of 
caution, 
he 
gives 
only 
main 
outlines) 
that 
he 
had 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
printing 
of 
his 
book, 
asserting 
that 
he 
will 
never 
again 
publish 
any 
of 
his 
researches, 
and 
will 
at 
most 
distribute 
here 
and 
there 
a 
manuscript 
copy. 
He 
even 
expresses 
great 
surprise 
that 
his 
new 
Dialogues 
have 
fallen 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
Elzevirs 
and 
were 
soon 
to 
be 
published; 
so 
that, 
having 
been 
asked 
to 
write 
a 
dedication, 
he 
could 
think 
of 
no 
man 
more 
worthy 
who 
couldalsoon 
thisoccasiondefendhimagainsthisenemies. 


As 
to 
the 
title 
which 
reads: 
Discourses 
and 
Mathematical 
Demonstrations 
concerning 
Two 
New 
Sciences 
pertaining 
to 
Mechanics 
and 
Local 
Motions, 
this 
only 
is 
known, 
namely, 
that 
the 
title 
is 
not 
the 
one 
which 
Galileo 
had 
devised 
and 
suggested; 
in 
fact 
he 
protested 
against 
the 
publishers 
taking 
the 
liberty 
of 
changing 
it 
and 
substituting 
“a 
low 
and 
common 
title 
for 
the 
noble 
and 
dignifiedonecarrieduponthetitle-page.” 



In 
reprinting 
this 
work 
in 
the 
National 
Edition, 
I 
have 
followed 
the 
Leyden 
text 
of 
1638 
faithfully 
but 
not 
slavishly, 
because 
I 
wished 
to 
utilize 
the 
large 
amount 
of 
manuscript 
material 
which 
has 
come 
down 
to 
us, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
correcting 
a 
considerable 
number 
of 
errors 
in 
this 
first 
edition, 
and 
also 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
inserting 
certain 
additions 
desired 
by 
the 
author 
himself. 
In 
the 
Leyden 
Edition, 
the 
four 
Dialogues 
are 
followed 
by 
an 
“Appendix 
containing 
some 
theorems 
and 
their 
proofs, 
dealing 
with 
centers 
of 
gravity 
of 
solid 
bodies, 
written 
by 
the 
same 
Author 
at 
an 
earlier 
date,” 
which 
has 
no 
immediate 
connection 
with 
the 
subjects 
treated 
in 
the 
Dialogues; 
these 
theorems 
were 
found 
by 
Galileo, 
as 
he 
tells 
us, 
“at 
the 
age 
of 
twenty-two 
and 
after 
two 
years 
study 
of 
geometry” 
and 
were 
here 
inserted 
only 
to 
save 
them 
fromoblivion. 


But 
it 
was 
not 
the 
intention 
of 
Galileo 
that 
the 
Dialogues 
on 
the 
New 
Sciences 
should 
contain 
only 
the 
four 
Days 
and 
the 
above-mentioned 
appendix 
which 
constitute 
the 
Leyden 
Edition; 
while, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
the 
Elzevirs 
were 
hastening 
the 
printing 
and 
striving 
to 
complete 
it 
at 
the 
earliest 
possible 
date, 
Galileo, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
kept 
on 
speaking 
of 
another 
Day, 
besides 
the 
four, 
thus 
embarrassing 
and 
perplexing 
the 
printers. 
From 
the 
correspondence 
which 
went 
on 
between 
author 
and 
publisher, 
it 
appears 
that 
this 
Fifth 
Day 
was 
to 
have 
treated 
“of 
the 
force 
of 
percussion 
and 
the 
use 
of 
the 
catenary”; 
but 
as 
the 
typographical 
work 
approached 
completion, 
the 
printer 
became 
anxious 
for 
the 
book 
to 
issue 
from 
the 
press 
without 
further 
delay; 
and 
thus 
it 
came 
to 
pass 
that 
the 
Discorsi 
e 
Dimostrazioni 
appeared 
containing 
only 
the 
four 
Days 
and 
the 
Appendix, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
April, 
1638, 
Galileo 
had 
plunged 
more 
deeply 
than 
ever 
“into 
the 
profound 
question 
ofpercussion” 
and 
“hadalmostreachedacompletesolution.” 


The 
“New 
Sciences” 
now 
appear 
in 
an 
edition 
following 
the 
text 
which 
I, 
after 
the 
most 
careful 
and 
devoted 
study, 
determined 
upon 
for 
the 
National 
Edition. 
It 
appears 
also 
in 
that 
language 
in 
which, 
above 
all 
others, 
I 
have 
desired 
to 
see 
it. 
In 
this 
translation, 
the 
last 
and 
ripest 
work 
of 
the 
great 
philosopher 
makes 
its 
first 
appearance 
in 
the 
New 
World: 
if 
toward 
this 
important 
result 
I 
may 
hope 
to 
have 
contributed 
in 
some 
measure 
I 
shall 
feel 
amply 
rewarded 
for 
having 
given 
to 
this 
field 
of 
research 
the 
best 
years 
of 
my 
life.

MOSTILLUSTRIOUSLORD: 
— 


In 
the 
pleasure 
which 
you 
derive 
from 
the 
possession 
of 
this 
work 
of 
mine 
I 
recognize 
your 
Lordship’s 
magnanimity. 
The 
disappointment 
and 
discouragement 
I 
have 
felt 
over 
the 
ill-fortune 
which 
has 
followed 
my 
other 
books 
are 
already 
known 
to 
you. 
Indeed, 
I 
had 
decided 
not 
to 
publish 
any 
more 
of 
my 
work. 
And 
yet 
in 
order 
to 
save 
it 
from 
complete 
oblivion, 
it 
seemed 
to 
me 
wise 
to 
leave 
a 
manuscript 
copy 
in 
some 
place 
where 
it 
would 
be 
available 
at 
least 
to 
those 
who 
follow 
intelligently 
the 
subjects 
which 
I 
have 
treated. 
Accordingly 
I 
chose 
first 
to 
place 
my 
work 
in 
your 
Lordship’s 
hands, 
asking 
no 
more 
worthy 
depository, 
and 
believing 
that, 
on 
account 
of 
your 
affection 
for 
me, 
you 
would 
have 
at 
heart 
the 
preservation 
of 
my 
studies 
and 
labors. 
Therefore, 
when 
you 
were 
returning 
home 
from 
your 
mission 
to 
Rome, 
I 
came 
to 
pay 
my 
respects 
in 
person 
as 
I 
had 
already 
done 
many 
times 
before 
by 
letter. 
At 
this 
meeting 
I 
presented 
to 
your 
Lordship 
a 
copy 
of 
these 
two 
works 
which 
at 
that 
time 
I 
happened 
to 
have 
ready. 
In 
the 
gracious 
reception 
which 
you 
gave 
these 
I 
found 
assurance 
of 
their 
preservation. 
The 
fact 
of 
your 
carrying 
them 
to 
France 
and 
showing 
them 
to 
friends 
of 
yours 
who 
are 
skilled 
in 
these 
sciences 
gave 
evidence 
that 
my 
silence 
was 
not 
to 
be 
interpreted 
as 
complete 
idleness. 
A 
little 
later, 
just 
as 
I 
was 
on 
the 
point 
of 
sending 
other 
copies 
to 
Germany, 
Flanders, 
England, 
Spain 
and 
possibly 
to 
some 
places 
in 
Italy, 
I 
was 
notified 
by 
the 
Elzevirs 
that 
they 
had 
these 
works 
of 
mine 
in 
press 
and 
that 
I 
ought 
to 
decide 
upon 
a 
dedication 
and 
send 
them 
a 
reply 
at 
once. 
This 
sudden 
and 
unexpected 
news 
led 
me 
to 
think 
that 
the 
eagerness 
of 
your 
Lordship 
to 
revive 
and 
spread 
my 
name 
by 
passing 
these 
works 
on 
to 
various 
friends 
was 
the 
real 
cause 
of 
their 
falling 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
printers 
who, 
because 
they 
had 
already 
published 
other 
works 
of 
mine, 
now 
wished 
to 
honor 
me 
with 
a 
beautiful 
and 
ornate 
edition 
of 
this 
work. 
But 
these 
writings 
of 
mine 
must 
have 
received 
additional 
value 
from 
the 
criticism 
of 
so 
excellent 
a 
judge 
as 
your 
Lordship, 
who 
by 
the 
union 
of 
many 
virtues 
has 
won 
the 
admiration 
of 
all. 
Your 
desire 
to 
enlarge 
the 
renown 
of 
my 
work 



shows 
your 
unparalleled 
generosity 
and 
your 
zeal 
for 
the 
public 
welfare 
which 
you 
thought 
would 
thus 
be 
promoted. 
Under 
these 
circumstances 
it 
is 
eminentlyfittingthatIshould, 
inunmistakableterms, 
gratefullyacknowledge 
this 
generosityon

your

famewings 
that 
have 
carried 
it 
into 
regions 
more 
distant 
than 
I 
had 
dared 
to 
hope. 
It 
is, 
therefore, 
proper 
that 
I 
dedicate 
to 
your 
Lordship 
this 
child 
of 
my 
brain. 
To 
this 
course 
I 
am 
constrained 
not 
only 
by 
the 
weight 
of 
obligation 
under 
which 
you 
have 
placed 
me, 
but 
also, 
if 
I 
may 
so 
speak, 
by 
the 
interest 
which 
I 
have 
in 
securing 
your 
Lordship 
as 
the 
defender 
of 
my 
reputation 
against

And 
now,

The 
Publisher 
to 
the 
Reader 


SINCE 
society 
is 
held 
together 
by 
the 
mutual 
services 
which 
men 
render 
one 
to 
another, 
and 
since 
to 
this 
end 
the 
arts 
and 
sciences 
have 
largely 
contributed, 
investigations 
in 
these 
fields 
have 
always 
been 
held 
in 
great 
esteem 
and 
have 
been 
highly 
regarded 
by 
our 
wise 
forefathers. 
The 
larger 
the 
utility 
and 
excellence 
of 
the 
inventions, 
the 
greater 
has 
been 
the 
honor 
and 
praise 
bestowed 
upon 
the 
inventors. 
Indeed, 
men 
have 
even 
deified 
them 
and 
have 
united 
in 
the 
attempt 
to 
perpetuate 
the 
memory 
of 
their 
benefactors 
by 
thebestowalof 
thissupremehonor. 


Praise 
and 
admiration 
are 
likewise 
due 
to 
those 
clever 
intellects 
who, 
confining 
their 
attention 
to 
the 
known, 
have 
discovered 
and 
corrected 
fallacies 
and 
errors 
in 
many 
and 
many 
a 
proposition 
enunciated 
by 
men 
of 
distinction 
and 
accepted 
for 
ages 
as 
fact. 
Although 
these 
men 
have 
only 
pointed 
out 
falsehood 
and 
have 
not 
replaced 
it 
by 
truth, 
they 
are 
nevertheless 
worthy 
of 
commendation 
when 
we 
consider 
the 
well-known 
difficulty 
of 
discovering 
fact, 
a 
difficulty 
which 
led 
the 
prince 
of 
orators 
to 
exclaim: 
Utinam 
tam 
facile 
possem 
vera 
reperire, 
quam 
falsa 
convincere.2 
And 
indeed, 
these 
latest 
centuries 
merit 
this 
praise 
because 
it 
is 
during 
them 
that 
the 
arts 
and 
sciences, 
discovered 
by 
the 
ancients, 
have 
been 
reduced 
to 
so 
great 
and 
constantly 
increasing 
perfection 
through 
the 
investigations 
and 
experiments 
of 
clear-seeing 
minds. 
This 
development 
is 
particularly 
evident 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
mathematical 
sciences. 
Here, 
without 
mentioning 
various 
men 
who 
have 
achieved 
success, 
we 
must 
without 
hesitation 
and 
with 
the 
unanimous 
approval 
of 
scholars 
assign 
the 
first 
place 
to 
Galileo 
Galilei, 
Member 
of 
the 
Academy 
of 
the 
Lincei. 
This 
he 
deserves 
not 
only 
because 
he 
has 
effectively 
demonstrated 
fallacies 
in 
many 
of 
our 
current 
conclusions, 
as 
is 
amply 
shown 
by 
his 
published 
works, 
but 
also 
because 
by 
means 
of 
the 
telescope 
(invented 
in 
this 
country 
but 
greatly 
perfected 
by 
him) 
he 
has 
discovered 
the 
four 
satellites 
of 
Jupiter, 
has 
shown 
us 
the 
true 
character 
of 
the 
Milky 
Way, 
and 
has 
made 
us 
acquainted 
with 
spots 
on 
the 
Sun, 
with 
the 
rough 
and 
cloudy 
portions 
of 
the 
lunar 
surface, 
with 
the 
threefold 
nature 
of 
Saturn, 
with 
the 
phases 
of 
Venus 
and 
with 
the 
physical 
character 
of 
comets. 
These 
matters 
were 
entirely 
unknown 
to 
the 
ancient 
astronomers 
and 
philosophers; 
so 
that 
we 
may 
truly 
say 
that 
he 
has 
restored 
to 
the 
world 
the 
scienceofastronomyandhas 
presented 
itin 
anewlight.

Remembering 
that 
the 
wisdom 
and 
power 
and 
goodness 
of 
the 
Creator 
are 
nowhere 
exhibited 
so 
well 
as 
in 
the 
heavens 
and 
celestial 
bodies, 
we 
can 
easily 
recognize 
the 
great 
merit 
of 
him 
who 
has 
brought 
these 
bodies 
to 
our 
knowledge 
and 
has, 
in 
spite 
of 
their 
almost 
infinite 
distance, 
rendered 
them 
easily 
visible. 
For, 
according 
to 
the 
common 
saying, 
sight 
can 
teachmore 
and 
with 
greater 
certainty 
in 
a 
single 
day 
than 
can 
precept 
even 
though 
repeated 
a 
thousand 
times; 
or, 
as 
another 
says, 
intuitive 
knowledge 
keeps 
pace 
with 
accuratedefinition. 


But 
the 
divine 
and 
natural 
gifts 
of 
this 
man 
are 
shown 
to 
best 
advantage 
in 
the 
present 
work 
where 
he 
is 
seen 
to 
have 
discovered, 
though 
not 
without 
many 
labors 
and 
long 
vigils, 
two 
entirely 
new 
sciences 
and 
to 
have 
demonstrated 
them 
in 
a 
rigid, 
that 
is, 
geometric, 
manner: 
and 
what 
is 
even 
more 
remarkable 
in 
this 
work 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
one 
of 
the 
two 
sciences 
deals 
with 
a 
subject 
of 
never-ending 
interest, 
perhaps 
the 
most 
important 
in 
nature, 
one 
which 
has 
engaged 
the 
minds 
of 
all 
the 
great 
philosophers 
and 
one 
concerning 
which 
an 
extraordinary 
number 
of 
books 
have 
been 
written. 
I 
refertomotion 
[moto 
locale], 
a 
phenomenon 
exhibiting 
very 
many 
wonderful 
properties, 
none 
of 
which 
has 
hitherto 
been 
discovered 
or 
demonstrated 
by 
any 
one. 
The 
other 
science 
which 
he 
has 
also 
developed 
from 
its 
very 
foundations 
deals 
with 
the 
resistance 
which 
solid 
bodies 
offer 
to 
fracture 
by 
external 
forces 
[per 
violenza], 
a 
subject 
of 
great 
utility, 
especially 
in 
the 
sciences 
and 
mechanical 
arts, 
and 
one 
also 
abounding 
in 
properties 
and 
theoremsnothithertoobserved. 


In 
this 
volume 
one 
finds 
the 
first 
treatment 
of 
these 
two 
sciences, 
full 
of 
propositions 
to 
which, 
as 
time 
goes 
on, 
able 
thinkers 
will 
add 
many 
more; 
also 
by 
means 
of 
a 
large 
number 
of 
clear 
demonstrations 
the 
author 
points 
the 
way 
to 
many 
other 
theorems 
as 
will 
be 
readily 
seen 
and 
understood 
by 
all 
intelligentreaders. 



First 
Day 


Interlocutors:Salviati,Sagredoand 
Simplicio 


Salv. 
The 
constant 
activity 
which 
you 
Venetians 
display 
in 
your 
famous 
arsenal 
suggests 
to 
the 
studious 
mind 
a 
large 
field 
for 
investigation, 
especially 
that 
part 
of 
the 
work 
which 
involves 
mechanics; 
for 
in 
this 
department 
all 
types 
of 
instruments 
and 
machines 
are 
constantly 
being 
constructed 
by 
many 
artisans, 
among 
whom 
there 
must 
be 
some 
who, 
partly 
by 
inherited 
experience 
and 
partly 
by 
their 
own 
observations, 
have 
become 
highly 
expertandcleverin 
explanation. 


Sagr. 
You 
are 
quite 
right. 
Indeed, 
I 
myself, 
being 
curious 
by 
nature, 
frequently 
visit 
this 
place 
for 
the 
mere 
pleasure 
of 
observing 
the 
work 
of 
those 
who, 
on 
account 
of 
their 
superiority 
over 
other 
artisans, 
we 
call 
“first 
rank 
men.” 
Conference 
with 
them 
has 
often 
helped 
me 
in 
the 
investigation 
of 
certain 
effects 
including 
not 
only 
those 
which 
are 
striking, 
but 
also 
those 
which 
are 
recondite 
and 
almost 
incredible. 
At 
times 
also 
I 
have 
been 
put 
to 
confusion 
and 
driven 
to 
despair 
of 
ever 
explaining 
something 
for 
which 
I 
could 
not 
account, 
but 
which 
my 
senses 
told 
me 
to 
be 
true. 
And 
notwithstanding 
the 
fact 
that 
what 
the 
old 
man 
told 
us 
a 
little 
while 
ago 
is 
proverbial 
and 
commonly 
accepted, 
yet 
it 
seemed 
to 
me 
altogether 
false, 
like 
many 
another 
saying 
which 
is 
current 
among 
the 
ignorant; 
for 
I 
think 
they 
introduce 
these 
expressions 
in 
order 
to 
give 
the 
appearance 
of 
knowing 
somethingaboutmatters 
whichthey 
donotunderstand. 


You 
refer, 
perhaps, 
to 
that 
last 
remark 
of 
his 
when 
we 
asked 
the 
reason 
why 
they 
employed 
stocks, 
scaffolding 
and 
bracing 
of 
larger 
dimensions 
for 
launchingabig 
vesselthan 
theydoforasmallone;andheansweredthatthey 
did 
this 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
the 
danger 
of 
the 
ship 
parting 
under 
its 
own 
heavy 
weight[vasta 
mole],a 
dangertowhichsmallboatsare 
not 
subject? 


Sagr. 
Yes, 
that 
is 
what 
I 
mean; 
and 
I 
refer 
especially 
to 
his 
last 
assertion 
which 
I 
have 
always 
regarded 
as 
a 
false, 
though 
current, 
opinion; 
namely, 
that 
in 
speaking 
of 
these 
and 
other 
similar 
machines 
one 
cannot 
argue 
from 
the 
small 
to 
the 
large, 
because 
many 
devices 
which 
succeed 
on 
a 
small 
scale 
do 
not 
work 
on 
a 
large 
scale. 
Now, 
since 
mechanics 
has 
its 
foundation 
in 



geometry, 
where 
mere 
size 
cuts 
no 
figure, 
I 
do 
not 
see 
that 
the 
properties 
of 
circles, 
triangles, 
cylinders, 
cones 
and 
other 
solid 
figures 
will 
change 
with 
their 
size. 
If, 
therefore, 
a 
large 
machine 
be 
constructed 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
its 
parts 
bear 
to 
one 
another 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
in 
a 
smaller 
one, 
and 
if 
the 
smaller 
is 
sufficiently 
strong 
for 
the 
purpose 
for 
which 
it 
was 
designed, 
I 
do 
not 
see 
whythelargeralsoshouldnotbeabletowithstandany 
severeanddestructive 
teststo 
whichitmaybe 
subjected. 


Salv. 
The 
common 
opinion 
is 
here 
absolutely 
wrong. 
Indeed, 
it 
is 
so 
far 
wrong 
that 
precisely 
the 
opposite 
is 
true, 
namely, 
that 
many 
machines 
can 
be 
constructed 
even 
more 
perfectly 
on 
a 
large 
scale 
than 
on 
a 
small; 
thus, 
for 
instance, 
a 
clock 
which 
indicates 
and 
strikes 
the 
hour 
can 
be 
made 
more 
accurate 
on 
a 
large 
scale 
than 
on 
a 
small. 
There 
are 
some 
intelligent 
people 
who 
maintain 
this 
same 
opinion, 
but 
on 
more 
reasonable 
grounds, 
when 
they 
cut 
loose 
from 
geometry 
and 
argue 
that 
the 
better 
performance 
of 
the 
large 
machine 
is 
owing 
to 
the 
imperfections 
and 
variations 
of 
the 
material. 
Here 
I 
trust 
you 
will 
not 
charge 
me 
with 
arrogance 
if 
I 
say 
that 
imperfections 
in 
the 
material, 
even 
those 
which 
are 
great 
enough 
to 
invalidate 
the 
clearest 
mathematical 
proof, 
are 
not 
sufficient 
to 
explain 
the 
deviations 
observed 
between 
machines 
in 
the 
concrete 
and 
in 
the 
abstract. 
Yet 
I 
shall 
say 
it 
and 
will 
affirm 
that, 
even 
if 
the 
imperfections 
did 
not 
exist 
and 
matter 
were 
absolutely 
perfect, 
unalterable 
and 
free 
from 
all 
accidental 
variations, 
still 
the 
mere 
fact 
that 
it 
is 
matter 
makes 
the 
larger 
machine, 
built 
of 
the 
same 
material 
and 
in 
the 
same 
proportion 
as 
the 
smaller, 
correspond 
with 
exactness 
to 
the 
smaller 
in 
every 
respect 
except 
that 
it 
will 
not 
be 
so 
strong 
or 
so 
resistant 
against 
violent 
treatment; 
the 
larger 
the 
machine, 
the 
greater 
its 
weakness. 
Since 
I 
assume 
matter 
to 
be 
unchangeable 
and 
always 
the 
same, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
we 
are 
no 
less 
able 
to 
treat 
this 
constant 
and 
invariable 
property 
in 
a 
rigid 
manner 
than 
if 
it 
belonged 
to 
simple 
and 
pure 
mathematics. 
Therefore, 
Sagredo, 
you 
would 
do 
well 
to 
change 
the 
opinion 
which 
you, 
and 
perhaps 
also 
many 
other 
students 
of 
mechanics, 
have 
entertained 
concerning 
the 
ability 
of 
machines 
and 
structures 
to 
resist 
external 
disturbances, 
thinking 
that 
when 
they 
are 
built 
of 
the 
same 
material 
and 
maintain 
the 
same 
ratio 
between 
parts,theyareableequally, 
orrather 
proportionally,toresistor 
yield 
to 
such 
external 
disturbances 
and 
blows. 
For 
we 
can 
demonstrate 
by 
geometry 
that 
the 
large 
machine 
is 
not 
proportionately 
stronger 
than 
the 
small. 
Finally, 
we 
may 
say 
that, 
for 
every 
machine 
and 
structure, 
whether 



artificial 
or 
natural, 
there 
is 
set 
a 
necessary 
limit 
beyond 
which 
neither 
art 
nor 
nature 
can 
pass; 
it 
is 
here 
understood, 
of 
course, 
that 
the 
material 
is 
the 
same 
and 
the 
proportionpreserved. 


Sagr. 
My 
brain 
already 
reels. 
My 
mind, 
like 
a 
cloud 
momentarily 
illuminated 
by 
a 
lightning-flash, 
is 
for 
an 
instant 
filled 
with 
an 
unusual 
light, 
which 
now 
beckons 
to 
me 
and 
which 
now 
suddenly 
mingles 
and 
obscures 
strange, 
crude 
ideas. 
From 
what 
you 
have 
said 
it 
appears 
to 
me 
impossible 
to 
build 
two 
similar 
structures 
of 
the 
same 
material, 
but 
of 
different 
sizes 
and 
have 
them 
proportionately 
strong; 
and 
if 
this 
were 
so, 
it 
would 
not 
be 
possible 
to 
find 
two 
single 
poles 
made 
of 
the 
same 
wood 
which 
shall 
be 
alike 
in 
strength 
and 
resistancebutunlikein 
size. 


Salv. 
So 
it 
is, 
Sagredo. 
And 
to 
make 
sure 
that 
we 
understand 
each 
other, 
I 
say 
that 
if 
we 
take 
a 
wooden 
rod 
of 
a 
certain 
length 
and 
size, 
fitted, 
say, 
into 
a 
wall 
at 
right 
angles, 
i. 
e., 
parallel 
to 
the 
horizon, 
it 
may 
be 
reduced 
to 
such 
a 
length 
that 
it 
will 
just 
support 
itself; 
so 
that 
if 
a 
hair’s 
breadth 
be 
added 
to 
its 
length 
it 
will 
break 
under 
its 
own 
weight 
and 
will 
be 
the 
only 
rod 
of 
the 
kind 
in 
the 
world.3 
Thus 
if, 
for 
instance, 
its 
length 
be 
a 
hundred 
times 
its 
breadth, 
you 
will 
not 
be 
able 
to 
find 
another 
rod 
whose 
length 
is 
also 
a 
hundred 
times 
its 
breadth 
and 
which, 
like 
the 
former, 
is 
just 
able 
to 
sustain 
its 
own 
weight 
and 
no 
more: 
all 
the 
larger 
ones 
will 
break 
while 
all 
the 
shorter 
ones 
will 
be 
strong 
enough 
to 
support 
something 
more 
than 
their 
own 
weight. 
And 
this 
which 
I 
have 
said 
about 
the 
ability 
to 
support 
itself 
must 
be 
understood 
to 
apply 
also 
to 
other 
tests; 
so 
that 
if 
a 
piece 
of 
scantling 
[corrente] 
will 
carry 
the 
weight 
of 
ten 
similar 
to 
itself, 
a 
beam 
[trave] 
having 
the 
same 
proportions 
willnotbe 
abletosupport 
tensimilar 
beams.

Please 
observe, 
gentlemen, 
how 
facts 
which 
at 
first 
seem 
improbable 
will, 
even 
on 
scant 
explanation, 
drop 
the 
cloak 
which 
has 
hidden 
them 
and 
stand 
forth 
in 
naked 
and 
simple 
beauty. 
Who 
does 
not 
know 
that 
a 
horse 
falling 
from 
a 
height 
of 
three 
or 
four 
cubits 
will 
break 
his 
bones, 
while 
a 
dog 
falling 
from 
the 
same 
height 
or 
a 
cat 
from 
a 
height 
of 
eight 
or 
ten 
cubits 
will 
suffer 
no 
injury? 
Equally 
harmless 
would 
be 
the 
fall 
of 
a 
grasshopper 
from 
a 
tower 
or 
the 
fall 
of 
an 
ant 
from 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
moon. 
Do 
not 
children 
fall 
with 



impunity 
from 
heights 
which 
would 
cost 
their 
elders 
a 
broken 
leg 
or 
perhaps 
a 
fractured 
skull? 
And 
just 
as 
smaller 
animals 
are 
proportionately 
stronger 
and 
more 
robust 
than 
the 
larger, 
so 
also 
smaller 
plants 
are 
able 
to 
stand 
up 
better 
than 
larger. 
I 
am 
certain 
you 
both 
know 
that 
an 
oak 
two 
hundred 
cubits 
[braccia] 
high 
would 
not 
be 
able 
to 
sustain 
its 
own 
branches 
if 
they 
were 
distributed 
as 
in 
a 
tree 
of 
ordinary 
size; 
and 
that 
nature 
cannot 
produce 
a 
horse 
as 
large 
as 
twenty 
ordinary 
horses 
or 
a 
giant 
ten 
times 
taller 
than 
an 
ordinary 
man 
unless 
by 
miracle 
or 
by 
greatly 
altering 
the 
proportions 
of 
his 
limbs 
and 
especially 
of 
his 
bones, 
which 
would 
have 
to 
be 
considerably 
enlarged 
over 
the 
ordinary. 
Likewise 
the 
current 
belief 
that, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
artificial 
machines 
the 
very 
large 
and 
the 
small 
are 
equally 
feasible 
and 
lasting 
is 
a 
manifest 
error. 
Thus, 
for 
example, 
a 
small 
obelisk 
or 
column 
or 
other 
solid 
figure 
can 
certainly 
be 
laid 
down 
or 
set 
up 
without 
danger 
of 
breaking, 
while 
the 
very 
large 
ones 
will 
go 
to 
pieces 
under 
the 
slightest 
provocation, 
and 
that 
purely 
on 
account 
of 
their 
own 
weight. 
And 
here 
I 
must 
relate 
a 
circumstance 
which 
is 
worthy 
of 
your 
attention 
as 
indeed 
are 
all 
eventswhichhappencontrarytoexpectation, 
especiallywhenaprecautionary 
measure 
turns 
out 
to 
be 
a 
cause 
of 
disaster. 
A 
large 
marble 
column 
was 
laid 
out 
so 
that 
its 
two 
ends 
rested 
each 
upon 
a 
piece 
of 
beam; 
a 
little 
later 
it 
occurred 
to 
a 
mechanic 
that, 
in 
order 
to 
be 
doubly 
sure 
of 
its 
not 
breaking 
in 
the 
middle 
by 
its 
own 
weight, 
it 
would 
be 
wise 
to 
lay 
a 
third 
support 
midway; 
this 
seemed 
to 
all 
an 
excellent 
idea; 
but 
the 
sequel 
showed 
that 
it 
was 
quite 
the 
opposite, 
for 
not 
many 
months 
passed 
before 
the 
column 
was 
found 
cracked 
andbrokenexactlyabovethenewmiddlesupport. 


Simp. 
A 
very 
remarkable 
and 
thoroughly 
unexpected 
accident, 
especially 
if 
causedby 
placing 
thatnew 
supportinthemiddle. 


Salv. 
Surely 
this 
is 
the 
explanation, 
and 
the 
moment 
the 
cause 
is 
known 
our 
surprise 
vanishes; 
for 
when 
the 
two 
pieces 
of 
the 
column 
were 
placed 
on 
level 
ground 
it 
was 
observed 
that 
one 
of 
the 
end 
beams 
had, 
after 
a 
long 
while, 
become 
decayed 
and 
sunken, 
but 
that 
the 
middle 
one 
remained 
hard 
and 
strong, 
thus 
causing 
one 
half 
of 
the 
column 
to 
project 
in 
the 
air 
without 
any 
support. 
Under 
these 
circumstances 
the 
body 
therefore 
behaved 
differently 
from 
what 
it 
would 
have 
done 
if 
supported 
only 
upon 
the 
first 
beams; 
because 
no 
matter 
how 
much 
they 
might 
have 
sunken 
the 
column 
would 
have 
gone 
with 
them. 
This 
is 
an 
accident 
which 
could 
not 
possibly 



have 
happened 
to 
a 
small 
column, 
even 
though 
made 
of 
the 
same 
stone 
and 
having 
a 
length 
corresponding 
to 
its 
thickness, 
i. 
e., 
preserving 
the 
ratio 
between 
thicknessand 
lengthfoundinthelargepillar. 


Sagr. 
I 
am 
quite 
convinced 
of 
the 
facts 
of 
the 
case, 
but 
I 
do 
not 
understand 
why 
the 
strength 
and 
resistance 
are 
not 
multiplied 
in 
the 
same 
proportion 
as 
the 
material; 
and 
I 
am 
the 
more 
puzzled 
because, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
I 
have 
noticed 
in 
other 
cases 
that 
the 
strength 
and 
resistance 
against 
breaking 
increase 
in 
a 
larger 
ratio 
than 
the 
amount 
of 
material. 
Thus, 
for 
instance, 
if 
two 
nails 
be 
driven 
into 
a 
wall, 
the 
one 
which 
is 
twice 
as 
big 
as 
the 
other 
will 
support 
not 
only 
twice 
as 
much 
weight 
as 
the 
other, 
but 
three 
or 
four 
times 
as 
much. 
Salv. 
Indeed 
you 
will 
not 
be 
far 
wrong 
if 
you 
say 
eight 
times 
as 
much; 
nor 
does 
this 
phenomenon 
contradict 
the 
other 
even 
though 
in 
appearance 
they 
seemsodifferent. 


Sagr. 
Will 
you 
not 
then, 
Salviati, 
remove 
these 
difficulties 
and 
clear 
away 
these 
obscurities 
if 
possible: 
for 
I 
imagine 
that 
this 
problem 
of 
resistance 
opens 
up 
a 
field 
of 
beautiful 
and 
useful 
ideas; 
and 
if 
you 
are 
pleased 
to 
make 
this 
the 
subject 
of 
to-day’s 
discourse 
you 
will 
place 
Simplicio 
and 
me 
under 
manyobligations. 


Salv. 
I 
am 
at 
your 
service 
if 
only 
I 
can 
call 
to 
mind 
what 
I 
learned 
from 
our 
Academician04 
who 
had 
thought 
much 
upon 
this 
subject 
and 
according 
to 
his 
custom 
had 
demonstrated 
everything 
by 
geometrical 
methods 
so 
that 
one 
might 
fairly 
call 
this 
a 
new 
science. 
For, 
although 
some 
of 
his 
conclusions 
had 
been 
reached 
by 
others, 
first 
of 
all 
by 
Aristotle, 
these 
are 
not 
the 
most 
beautiful 
and, 
what 
is 
more 
important, 
they 
had 
not 
been 
proven 
in 
a 
rigid 
manner 
from 
fundamental 
principles. 
Now, 
since 
I 
wish 
to 
convince 
you 
by 
demonstrative 
reasoning 
rather 
than 
to 
persuade 
you 
by 
mere 
probabilities, 
I 
shall 
suppose 
that 
you 
are 
familiar 
with 
present-day 
mechanics 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
needed 
in 
our 
discussion. 
First 
of 
all 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
consider 
what 
happens 
when 
a 
piece 
of 
wood 
or 
any 
other 
solid 
which 
coheres 
firmly 
is 
broken; 
for 
this 
is 
the 
fundamental 
fact, 
involving 
the 
first 
and 
simple 
principle 
which 
we 
musttake 
for 
grantedaswellknown.

[Trans.] 



To 
grasp 
this 
more 
clearly, 
imagine 
a 
cylinder 
or 
prism, 
AB, 
made 
of 
wood 
or 
other 
solid 
coherent 
material. 
Fasten 
the 
upper 
end, 
A, 
so 
that 
the 
cylinder 
hangs 
vertically. 
To 
the 
lower 
end, 
B, 
attach 
the 
weight 
C. 
It 
is 
clear 
that 
however 
great 
they 
may 
be, 
the 
tenacity 
and 
coherence 
[tenacità 
e 
coerenza] 
between 
the 
parts 
of 
this 
solid, 
so 
long 
as 
they 
are 
not 
infinite, 
can 
be 
overcome 
by 
the 
pull 
of 
the 
weight 
C, 
a 
weight 
which 
can 
be 
increased 
indefinitely 
until 
finally 
the 
solid 
breaks 
like 
a 
rope. 
And 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
rope 
whose 
strength 
we 
know 
to 
be 
derived 
from 
a 
multitude 
of 
hemp 
threads 
which 
compose 
it, 
so 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
wood, 
we 
observe 
its 
fibres 
and 
filaments 
run 
lengthwise 
and 
render 
it 
much 
stronger 
than 
a 
hemp 
rope 
of 
the 
same 
thickness. 
But 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
stone 
or 
metallic 
cylinder 
where 
the 
coherence 
seems 
to 
be 
still 
greater 
the 
cement 
which 
holds 
the 
parts 
together 
must 
be 
something 
other 
than 
filaments 
and 
fibres; 
and 
yet 
even 
this 
can 
be 
brokenby 
astrongpull. 


Simp. 
If 
this 
matter 
be 
as 
you 
say 
I 
can 
well 
understand 
that 
the 
fibres 
of 
the 
wood, 
being 
as 
long 
as 
the 
piece 
of 
wood 
itself, 
render 
it 
strong 
and 
resistant 
against 
large 
forces 
tending 
to 
break 
it. 
But 
how 
can 
one 
make 
a 
rope 
one 
hundred 
cubits 
long 
out 
of 
hempen 
fibres 
which 
are 
not 
more 
than 
two 
or 
three 
cubits 
long, 
and 
still 
give 
it 
so 
much 
strength? 
Besides, 
I 
should 
be 
glad 
to 
hear 
your 
opinion 
as 
to 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
the 
parts 
of 
metal, 
stone, 
and 
other 
materials 
not 
showing 
a 
filamentous 
structure 
are 
put 
together; 
for, 
if 
I 
mistakenot,theyexhibit 
evengreatertenacity. 



Salv. 
To 
solve 
the 
problems 
which 
you 
raise 
it 
will 
be 
necessary 
to 
make 
a 
digressioninto 
subjectswhichhavelittlebearinguponourpresentpurpose. 


Sagr. 
But 
if, 
by 
digressions, 
we 
can 
reach 
new 
truth, 
what 
harm 
is 
there 
in 
making 
one 
now, 
so 
that 
we 
may 
not 
lose 
this 
knowledge, 
remembering 
that 
such 
an 
opportunity, 
once 
omitted, 
may 
not 
return; 
remembering 
also 
that 
we 
are 
not 
tied 
down 
to 
a 
fixed 
and 
brief 
method 
but 
that 
we 
meet 
solely 
for 
our 
own 
entertainment? 
Indeed, 
who 
knows 
but 
that 
we 
may 
thus 
frequently 
discover 
something 
moreinteresting 
and 
beautiful 
than 
the 
solution 
originally 
sought? 
I 
beg 
of 
you, 
therefore, 
to 
grant 
the 
request 
of 
Simplicio, 
which 
is 
also 
mine; 
for 
I 
am 
no 
less 
curious 
and 
desirous 
than 
he 
to 
learn 
what 
is 
the 
binding 
material 
which 
holds 
together 
the 
parts 
of 
solids 
so 
that 
they 
can 
scarcely 
be 
separated. 
This 
information 
is 
also 
needed 
to 
understand 
the 
coherence 
ofthepartsoffibresthemselves 
ofwhich 
some 
solidsarebuiltup. 



Salv. 
I 
am 
at 
your 
service, 
since 
you 
desire 
it. 
The 
first 
question 
is, 
How 
are 
fibres, 
each 
not 
more 
than 
two 
or 
three 
cubits 
in 
length, 
so 
tightly 
bound 
together 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
rope 
one 
hundred 
cubits 
long 
that 
great 
force 
[violenza]isrequiredtobreakit? 


Now 
tell 
me, 
Simplicio, 
can 
you 
not 
hold 
a 
hempen 
fibre 
so 
tightly 
between 
your 
fingers 
that 
I, 
pulling 
by 
the 
other 
end, 
would 
break 
it 
before 
drawing 
it 
away 
from 
you? 
Certainly 
you 
can. 
And 
now 
when 
the 
fibres 
of 
hemp 
are 
held 
not 
only 
at 
the 
ends, 
but 
are 
grasped 
by 
the 
surrounding 
medium 
throughout 
their 
entire 
length 
is 
it 
not 
manifestly 
more 
difficult 
to 
tear 
them 
loose 
from 
what 
holds 
them 
than 
to 
break 
them? 
But 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
rope 
the 
very 
act 
of 
twisting 
causes 
the 
threads 
to 
bind 
one 
another 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
when 
the 
rope 
is 
stretched 
with 
a 
great 
force 
the 
fibres 
break 
rather 
thanseparatefrom 
each 
other. 


At 
the 
point 
where 
a 
rope 
parts 
the 
fibres 
are, 
as 
everyone 
knows, 
very 
short, 
nothing 
like 
a 
cubit 
long, 
as 
they 
would 
be 
if 
the 
parting 
of 
the 
rope 
occurred, 
not 
by 
the 
breaking 
of 
the 
filaments, 
but 
by 
their 
slipping 
one 
over 
theother. 


Sagr. 
In 
confirmation 
of 
this 
it 
may 
be 
remarked 
that 
ropes 
sometimes 
break 
not 
by 
a 
lengthwise 
pull 
but 
by 
excessive 
twisting. 
This, 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
is 
a 
conclusive 
argument 
because 
the 
threads 
bind 
one 
another 
so 
tightly 
that 
the 
compressing 
fibres 
do 
not 
permit 
those 
which 
are 
compressed 
to 
lengthen 
the 
spirals 
even 
that 
little 
bit 
by 
which 
it 
is 
necessary 
for 
them 
to 
lengthen 
in

Salv. 
You 
are 
quite 
right. 
Now 
see 
how 
one 
fact 
suggests 
another. 
The 
thread 
held 
between 
the 
fingers 
does 
not 
yield 
to 
one 
who 
wishes 
to 
draw 
it 
away 
even 
when 
pulled 
with 
considerable 
force, 
but 
resists 
because 
it 
is 
held 
back 
by 
a 
double 
compression, 
seeing 
that 
the 
upper 
finger 
presses 
against 
the 
lower 
as 
hard 
as 
the 
lower 
against 
the 
upper. 
Now, 
if 
we 
could 
retain 
only 
one 
of 
these 
pressures 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
only 
half 
the 
original 
resistance 
would 
remain; 
but 
since 
we 
are 
not 
able, 
by 
lifting, 
say, 
the 
upper 
finger, 
to 
remove 
one 
of 
these 
pressures 
without 
also 
removing 
the 
other, 
it 
becomes 
necessary 
to 
preserve 
one 
of 
them 
by 
means 
of 
a 
new 
device 
which 
causes 
the 
thread 
to 
press 
itself 
against 
the 
finger 
or 
against 
some 
other 
solid 
body 
upon 
which 
it 
rests; 
and 
thus 
it 
is 
brought 
about 
that 
the 
very 
force 
which 
pulls 
it 
in 
order 
to 
snatch 
it 
away 
compresses 
it 
more 
and 
more 
as 
the 
pull 



increases. 
This 
is 
accomplished 
by 
wrapping 
the 
thread 
around 
the 
solid 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
a 
spiral; 
and 
will 
be 
better 
understood 
by 
means 
of 
a 
figure. 
Let 
AB 
and 
CD 
be 
two 
cylinders 
between 
which 
is 
stretched 
the 
thread 
EF: 
and 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
greater 
clearness 
we 
will 
imagine 
it 
to 
be 
a 
small 
cord. 
If 
these 
two 
cylinders 
be 
pressed 
strongly 
together, 
the 
cord 
EF, 
when 
drawn 
by 
the 
end 
F, 
will 
undoubtedly 
stand 
a 
considerable 
pull 
before 
it 
slips 
between 
the 
two 
compressing 
solids. 
But 
if 
we 
remove 
one 
of 
these 
cylinders 
the 
cord, 
though 
remaining 
in 
contact 
with 
the 
other, 
will 
not 
thereby 
be 
prevented 
from 
slipping 
freely. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
if 
one 
holds 
the 
cord 
loosely 
against 
the 
top 
of 
the 
cylinder 
A, 
winds 
it 
in 
the 
spiral 
form 
AFLOTR, 
and 
then 
pulls 
it 
by 
the 
end 
R, 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
the 
cord 
will 
begin 
to 
bind 
the 
cylinder; 
the 
greater 
the 
number 
of 
spirals 
the 
more 
tightly 
will 
the 
cord 
be 
pressed 
against 
the 
cylinder 
by 
any 
given 
pull. 
Thus 
as 
the 
number 
of 
turns 
increases, 
the 
line 
of 
contactbecomeslongerand 
in 
consequence 
moreresistant; 
so

Sagr. 
What 
you 
say 
has 
cleared 
up 
two 
points 
which 
I 
did 
not 
previously 
understand. 
One 
fact 
is 
how 
two, 
or 
at 
most 
three, 
turns 
of 
a 
rope 
around 
the 
axle 
of 
a 
windlass 
cannot 
only 
hold 
it 
fast, 
but 
can 
also 
prevent 
it 
from 
slipping 
when 
pulled 
by 
the 
immense 
force 
of 
the 
weight 
[forza 
del 
peso] 
which 
it 
sustains; 
and 
moreover 
how, 
by 
turning 
the 
windlass, 
this 
same 
axle, 
by 
mere 
friction 
of 
the 
rope 
around 
it, 
can 
wind 
up 
and 
lift 
huge 
stones 
while 
a 
mere 
boy 
is 
able 
to 
handle 
the 
slack 
of 
the 
rope. 
The 
other 
fact 
has 
to 
do 
with 
a 
simple 
but 
clever 
device, 
invented 
by 
a 
young 
kinsman 
of 
mine, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
descending 
from 
a 
window 
by 
means 
of 
a 
rope 
without 
lacerating 
the 
palms 
of 
his 
hands, 
as 
had 
happened 
to 
him 
shortly 
before 
and 
greatly 
to 
his 
discomfort. 
A 
small 
sketch 
will 
make 
this 
clear. 
He 
took 
a 
wooden 
cylinder, 
AB, 
about 
as 
thick 
as 
a 
walking 
stick 
and 
about 
one 
span 
long: 
on 
this 
he 
cut 
a 
spiral 
channel 
of 
about 
one 
turn 
and 
a 
half, 
and 
large 



enough 
to 
just 
receive 
the 
rope 
which 
he 
wished 
to 
use. 
Having 
introduced 
the 
rope 
at 
the 
end 
A 
and 
led 
it 
out 
again 
at 
the 
end 
B, 
he 
enclosed 
both 
the 
cylinder 
and 
the 
rope 
in 
a 
case 
of 
wood 
or 
tin, 
hinged 
along 
the 
side 
so 
that 
it 
could 
be 
easily 
opened 
and 
closed. 
After 
he 
had 
fastened 
the 
rope 
to 
a 
firm 
support 
above, 
he 
could, 
on 
grasping 
and 
squeezing 
the 
case 
with 
both 
hands, 
hang 
by 
his 
arms. 
The 
pressure 
on 
the 
rope, 
lying 
between 
the 
case 
and 
the 
cylinder, 
was 
such 
that 
he 
could, 
at 
will, 
either 
grasp 
the 
case 
more 
tightly 
and 
hold 
himself 
from 
slipping, 
or 
slacken 
his 
hold 
and 
descend 
as 
slowly 
as 
hewished. 



A 
truly 
ingenious 
device! 
I 
feel, 
however, 
that 
for 
a 
complete 
explanation 
other 
considerations 
might 
well 
enter; 
yet 
I 
must 
not 
now 
digress 
upon 
this 
particular 
topic 
since 
you 
are 
waiting 
to 
hear 
what 
I 
think 
about 
the 
breaking 
strength 
of 
other 
materials 
which, 
unlike 
ropes 
and 
most 
woods, 
do 
not 
show 
a 
filamentous 
structure. 
The 
coherence 
of 
these 
bodies 
is, 
in 
my 
estimation, 



producedby 
other 
causeswhich 
maybegroupedundertwoheads. 
Oneis 
that 
much-talked-of 
repugnance 
which 
nature 
exhibits 
towards 
a 
vacuum; 
but 
this 
horror 
of 
a 
vacuum 
not 
being 
sufficient, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
introduce 
another 
cause 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
gluey 
or 
viscous 
substance 
which 
binds 
firmly 
together 
thecomponentparts 
ofthebody. 


First 
I 
shall 
speak 
of 
the 
vacuum, 
demonstrating 
by 
definite 
experiment 
the 
quality 
and 
quantity 
of 
its 
force 
[virtù]. 
If 
you 
take 
two 
highly 
polished 
and 
smooth 
plates 
of 
marble, 
metal, 
or 
glass 
and 
place 
them 
face 
to 
face, 
one 
will 
slide 
over 
the 
other 
with 
the 
greatest 
ease, 
showing 
conclusively 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
of 
a 
viscous 
nature 
between 
them. 
But 
when 
you 
attempt 
to 
separate 
them 
and 
keep 
them 
at 
a 
constant 
distance 
apart, 
you 
find 
the 
plates 
exhibit 
such 
a 
repugnance 
to 
separation 
that 
the 
upper 
one 
will 
carry 
the 
lower 
one 
with 
it 
and 
keep 
it 
lifted 
indefinitely, 
even 
when 
the 
latter 
is 
big 
and 
heavy. 


This 
experiment 
shows 
the 
aversion 
of 
nature 
for 
empty 
space, 
even 
during 
the 
brief 
moment 
required 
for 
the 
outside 
air 
to 
rush 
in 
and 
fill 
up 
the 
region 
between 
the 
two 
plates. 
It 
is 
also 
observed 
that 
if 
two 
plates 
are 
not 
thoroughly 
polished, 
their 
contact 
is 
imperfect 
so 
that 
when 
you 
attempt 
to 
separate 
them 
slowly 
the 
only 
resistance 
offered 
is 
that 
of 
weight; 
if, 
however,the 
pull 
besudden,thenthe 
lower 
platerises,but 
quicklyfalls 
back, 
having 
followed 
the 
upper 
plate 
only 
for 
that 
very 
short 
interval 
of 
time 
required 
for 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 
small 
amount 
of 
air 
remaining 
between 
the 
plates, 
in 
consequence 
of 
their 
not 
fitting, 
and 
for 
the 
entrance 
of 
the 
surrounding 
air. 
This 
resistance 
which 
is 
exhibited 
between 
the 
two 
plates 
is 
doubtless 
likewise 
present 
between 
the 
parts 
of 
a 
solid, 
and 
enters, 
at 
least 
in 
part, 
asaconcomitant 
causeoftheircoherence. 


Allow 
me 
to 
interrupt 
you 
for 
a 
moment, 
please; 
for 
I 
want 
to 
speak 
of 
something 
which 
just 
occurs 
to 
me, 
namely, 
when 
I 
see 
how 
the 
lower 
plate 
follows 
the 
upper 
one 
and 
how 
rapidly 
it 
is 
lifted, 
I 
feel 
sure 
that, 
contrary 
to 
the 
opinion 
of 
many 
philosophers, 
including 
perhaps 
even 
Aristotle 
himself, 
motion 
in 
a 
vacuum 
is 
not 
instantaneous. 
If 
this 
were 
so 
the 
two 
plates 
mentioned 
above 
would 
separate 
without 
any 
resistance 
whatever, 
seeing 
that 
the 
same 
instant 
of 
time 
would 
suffice 
for 
their 
separation 
and 
for 
the 
surrounding 
medium 
to 
rush 
in 
and 
fill 
the 
vacuum 
between 
them. 
The 
fact 
that 
the 
lower 
plate 
follows 
the 
upper 
one 
allows 
us 
to 
infer, 
not 
only 
that 
motion 
in 
a 
vacuum 
is 
not 
instantaneous, 
but 
also 
that, 
between 
the 
two 
plates, 
a 
vacuum 
really 
exists, 
at 
least 
for 
a 
very 
short 
time, 
sufficient 
to 



allow 
the 
surrounding 
medium 
to 
rush 
in 
and 
fill 
the 
vacuum; 
for 
if 
there 
were 
no 
vacuum 
there 
would 
be 
no 
need 
of 
any 
motion 
in 
the 
medium. 
One 
must 
admit 
then 
that 
a 
vacuum 
is 
sometimes 
produced 
by 
violent 
motion 
[violenza] 
or 
contrary 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
nature, 
(although 
in 
my 
opinion 
nothing 
occurscontrarytonatureexcepttheimpossible,and 
thatneveroccurs). 


But 
here 
another 
difficulty 
arises. 
While 
experiment 
convinces 
me 
of 
the 
correctness 
of 
this 
conclusion, 
my 
mind 
is 
not 
entirely 
satisfied 
as 
to 
the 
cause 
to 
which 
this 
effect 
is 
to 
be 
attributed. 
For 
the 
separation 
of 
the 
plates 
precedes 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
vacuum 
which 
is 
produced 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
this 
separation; 
and 
since 
it 
appears 
to 
me 
that, 
in 
the 
order 
of 
nature, 
the 
cause 
must 
precede 
the 
effect, 
even 
though 
it 
appears 
to 
follow 
in 
point 
of 
time, 
and 
since 
every 
positive 
effect 
must 
have 
a 
positive 
cause, 
I 
do 
not 
see 
how 
the 
adhesion 
of 
two 
plates 
and 
their 
resistance 
to 
separation 
— 
actual 
facts 
— 
can 
be 
referred 
to 
a 
vacuum 
as 
cause 
when 
this 
vacuum 
is 
yet 
to 
follow. 
According 
to 
the 
infallible 
maxim 
of 
the 
Philosopher, 
the 
nonexistentcan 
produceno 
effect. 


Simp. 
Seeing 
that 
you 
accept 
this 
axiom 
of 
Aristotle, 
I 
hardly 
think 
you 
will 
reject 
another 
excellent 
and 
reliable 
maxim 
of 
his, 
namely, 
Nature 
undertakes 
only 
that 
which 
happens 
without 
resistance; 
and 
in 
this 
saying, 
it 
appears 
to 
me, 
you 
will 
find 
the 
solution 
of 
your 
difficulty. 
Since 
nature 
abhors 
a 
vacuum, 
she 
prevents 
that 
from 
which 
a 
vacuum 
would 
follow 
as 
a 
necessary 
consequence. 
Thus 
it 
happens 
that 
nature 
prevents 
the 
separation 
of 
the 
two 
plates. 


Now 
admitting 
that 
what 
Simplicio 
says 
is 
an 
adequate 
solution 
of 
my 
difficulty,itseems 
tome,if 
Imaybeallowedtoresumemyformerargument, 
that 
this 
very 
resistance 
to 
a 
vacuum 
ought 
to 
be 
sufficient 
to 
hold 
together 
the 
parts 
either 
of 
stone 
or 
of 
metal 
or 
the 
parts 
of 
any 
other 
solid 
which 
is 
knit 
together 
more 
strongly 
and 
which 
is 
more 
resistant 
to 
separation. 
If 
for 
one 
effect 
there 
be 
only 
one 
cause, 
or 
if, 
more 
being 
assigned, 
they 
can 
be 
reduced 
to 
one, 
then 
why 
is 
not 
this 
vacuum 
which 
really 
exists 
a 
sufficient 
causeforallkindsofresistance? 


Salv. 
I 
do 
not 
wish 
just 
now 
to 
enter 
this 
discussion 
as 
to 
whether 
the 
vacuum 
alone 
is 
sufficient 
to 
hold 
together 
the 
separate 
parts 
of 
a 
solid 
body; 
but 
I 
assure 
you 
that 
the 
vacuum 
which 
acts 
as 
a 
sufficient 
cause 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
two 
plates 
is 
not 
alone 
sufficient 
to 
bind 
together 
the 
parts 
of 
a 
solid 
cylinder 



of 
marble 
or 
metal 
which, 
when 
pulled 
violently, 
separates 
and 
divides. 
And 
now 
if 
I 
find 
a 
method 
of 
distinguishing 
this 
well 
known 
resistance, 
depending 
upon 
the 
vacuum, 
from 
every 
other 
kind 
which 
might 
increase 
the 
coherence, 
and 
if 
I 
show 
you 
that 
the 
aforesaid 
resistance 
alone 
is 
not 
nearly 
sufficient 
for 
such 
an 
effect, 
will 
you 
not 
grant 
that 
we 
are 
bound 
to 
introduce 
another 
cause? 
Help 
him, 
Simplicio, 
since 
he 
does 
not 
know 
what 
reply 
to 
make. 


Simp. 
Surely, 
Sagredo’s 
hesitation 
must 
be 
owing 
to 
another 
reason, 
for 
there 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
concerning 
a 
conclusion 
which 
is 
at 
once 
so 
clear 
and 
logical. 


Sagr. 
You 
have 
guessed 
rightly, 
Simplicio. 
I 
was 
wondering 
whether, 
if 
a 
million 
of 
gold 
each 
year 
from 
Spain 
were 
not 
sufficient 
to 
pay 
the 
army, 
it 
might 
not 
be 
necessary 
to 
make 
provision 
other 
than 
small 
coin 
for 
the 
pay 
of 
thesoldiers.5

But 
go 
ahead, 
Salviati; 
assume 
that 
I 
admit 
your 
conclusion 
and 
show 
us 
your 
method 
of 
separating 
the 
action 
of 
the 
vacuum 
from 
other 
causes; 
and 
by 
measuring 
it 
show 
us 
how 
it 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
produce 
the 
effect 
in 
question. 


Salv. 
Your 
good 
angel 
assist 
you. 
I 
will 
tell 
you 
how 
to 
separate 
the 
force 
of 
the 
vacuum 
from 
the 
others, 
and 
afterwards 
how 
to 
measure 
it. 
For 
this 
purpose 
let 
us 
consider 
a 
continuous 
substance 
whose 
parts 
lack 
all 
resistance 
to 
separation 
except 
that 
derived 
from 
a 
vacuum, 
such 
as 
is 
the 
case 
with 
water, 
a 
fact 
fully 
demonstrated 
by 
our 
Academician 
in 
one 
of 
his 
treatises. 
Whenever 
a 
cylinder 
of 
water 
is 
subjected 
to 
a 
pull 
and 
offers 
a 
resistance 
to 
the 
separation 
of 
its 
parts 
this 
can 
be 
attributed 
to 
no 
other 
cause 
than 
the 
resistanceof 
thevacuum. 
In 
order 
to 
trysuch 
an 
experiment 
I 
have 
invented 
a 
device 
which 
I 
can 
better 
explain 
by 
means 
of 
a 
sketch 
than 
by 
mere 
words. 
Let 
CABD 
represent 
the 
cross 
section 
of 
a 
cylinder 
either 
of 
metal 
or, 
preferably, 
of 
glass, 
hollow 
inside 
and 
accurately 
turned. 
Into 
this 
is 
introduced 
a 
perfectly 
fitting 
cylinder 
of 
wood, 
represented 
in 
cross 
section 
by 
EGHF, 
and 
capable 
of 
up-and-down 
motion. 
Through 
the 
middle 
of 
this 
cylinder 
is 
bored 
a 
hole 
to 
receive 
an 
iron 
wire, 
carrying 
a 
hook 
at 
the 
end 
K, 



while 
the 
upper 
end 
of 
the 
wire, 
I, 
is 
provided 
with 
a 
conical 
head. 
The 
wooden 
cylinder 
is 
countersunk 
at 
the 
top 
so 
as 
to 
receive, 
with 
a 
perfect 
fit, 


theconicalheadIofthewire,IK,whenpulleddownbytheendK.
Now 
insert 
the 
wooden 
cylinder 
EH 
in 
the 
hollow 
cylinder 
AD, 
so 
as 
not 
to 
touch 
the 
upper 
end 
of 
the 
latter 
but 
to 
leave 
free 
a 
space 
of 
two 
or 
three 
finger-breadths; 
this 
space 
is 
to 
be 
filled 
with 
water 
by 
holding 
the 
vessel 
with 
the 
mouth 
CD 
upwards, 
pushing 
down 
on 
the 
stopper 
EH, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
keeping 
the 
conical 
head 
of 
the 
wire, 
I, 
away 
from 
the 
hollow 
portion 
of 
the 
wooden 
cylinder. 
The 
air 
is 
thus 
allowed 
to 
escape 
alongside 
the 
iron 
wire 
(which 
does 
not 
make 
a 
close 
fit) 
as 
soon 
as 
one 
presses 
down 
on 
the 
wooden 
stopper. 
The 
air 
having 
been 
allowed 
to 
escape 
and 
the 
iron 
wire 
having 
been 
drawn 
back 
so 
that 
it 
fits 
snugly 
against 
the 
conical 
depression 
in 
the 
wood, 
invert 
the 
vessel, 
bringing 
it 
mouth 
downwards, 
and 
hang 
on 
the 
hook 
K 
a 
vessel 
which 
can 
be 
filled 
with 
sand 
or 
any 
heavy 



material 
in 
quantity 
sufficient 
to 
finally 
separate 
the 
upper 
surface 
of 
the 
stopper, 
EF,from 
thelowersurface 
of 
the 
waterto 
which 
itwas 
attached 
only 
by 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
vacuum. 
Next 
weigh 
the 
stopper 
and 
wire 
together 
with 
the 
attached 
vessel 
and 
its 
contents; 
we 
shall 
then 
have 
the 
force 
of 
the 
vacuum 
[forza 
del 
vacuo]. 
If 
one 
attaches 
to 
a 
cylinder 
of 
marble 
or 
glass 
a 
weight 
which, 
together 
with 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
marble 
or 
glass 
itself, 
is 
just 
equal 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
weights 
before 
mentioned, 
and 
if 
breaking 
occurs 
we 
shall 
then 
be 
justified 
in 
saying 
that 
the 
vacuum 
alone 
holds 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
marble 
and 
glass 
together; 
but 
if 
this 
weight 
does 
not 
suffice 
and 
if 
breaking 
occurs 
only 
after 
adding, 
say, 
four 
times 
this 
weight, 
we 
shall 
then 
be 
compelled 
to 
say 
that 
the 
vacuum 
furnishes 
only 
one 
fifth 
of 
the 
total 
resistance[resistenza]. 
Simp. 
No 
one 
can 
doubt 
the 
cleverness 
of 
the 
device; 
yet 
it 
presents 
many 
difficulties 
which 
make 
me 
doubt 
its 
reliability. 
For 
who 
will 
assure 
us 
that 
the 
air 
does 
not 
creep 
in 
between 
the 
glass 
and 
stopper 
even 
if 
it 
is 
well 
packed 
with 
tow 
or 
other 
yielding 
material? 
I 
question 
also 
whether 
oiling 
with 
wax 
or 
turpentine 
will 
suffice 
to 
make 
the 
cone, 
I, 
fit 
snugly 
on 
its 
seat. 
Besides, 
may 
not 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
water 
expand 
and 
dilate? 
Why 
may 
not 
the 
air 
or 
exhalations 
or 
some 
other 
more 
subtile 
substances 
penetrate 
the 
pores 
ofthewood,orevenoftheglassitself? 


Salv. 
With 
great 
skill 
indeed 
has 
Simplicio 
laid 
before 
us 
the 
difficulties; 
and 
he 
has 
even 
partly 
suggested 
how 
to 
prevent 
the 
air 
from 
penetrating 
the 
wood 
or 
passing 
between 
the 
wood 
and 
the 
glass. 
But 
now 
let 
me 
point 
out 
that, 
as 
our 
experience 
increases, 
we 
shall 
learn 
whether 
or 
not 
these 
alleged 
difficulties 
really 
exist. 
For 
if, 
as 
is 
the 
case 
with 
air, 
water 
is 
by 
nature 
expansible, 
although 
only 
under 
severe 
treatment, 
we 
shall 
see 
the 
stopper 
descend; 
and 
if 
we 
put 
a 
small 
excavation 
in 
the 
upper 
part 
of 
the 
glass 
vessel, 
such 
as 
indicated 
by 
V, 
then 
the 
air 
or 
any 
other 
tenuous 
and 
gaseous 
substance, 
which 
might 
penetrate 
the 
pores 
of 
glass 
or 
wood, 
would 
pass 
through 
the 
water 
and 
collect 
in 
this 
receptacle 
V. 
But 
if 
these 
things 
do 
not 
happen 
we 
may 
rest 
assured 
that 
our 
experiment 
has 
been 
performed 
with 
proper 
caution; 
and 
we 
shall 
discover 
that 
water 
does 
not 
dilate 
and 
that 
glass 
doesnotallowanymaterial,howevertenuous,to 
penetrateit. 


Sagr. 
Thanks 
to 
this 
discussion, 
I 
have 
learned 
the 
cause 
of 
a 
certain 
effect 
which 
I 
have 
long 
wondered 
at 
and 
despaired 
of 
understanding. 
I 
once 
saw 
a 



cistern 
which 
had 
been 
provided 
with 
a 
pump 
under 
the 
mistaken 
impression 
that 
the 
water 
might 
thus 
be 
drawn 
with 
less 
effort 
or 
in 
greater 
quantity 
than 
bymeans 
oftheordinary 
bucket. 
The 
stock 
ofthepumpcarrieditssucker 
and 
valve 
in 
the 
upper 
part 
so 
that 
the 
water 
was 
lifted 
by 
attraction 
and 
not 
by 
a 
push 
as 
is 
the 
case 
with 
pumps 
in 
which 
the 
sucker 
is 
placed 
lower 
down. 
This 
pump 
worked 
perfectly 
so 
long 
as 
the 
water 
in 
the 
cistern 
stood 
above 
a 
certain 
level; 
but 
below 
this 
level 
the 
pump 
failed 
to 
work. 
When 
I 
first 
noticed 
this 
phenomenon 
I 
thought 
the 
machine 
was 
out 
of 
order; 
but 
the 
workman 
whom 
I 
called 
in 
to 
repair 
it 
told 
me 
the 
defect 
was 
not 
in 
the 
pump 
but 
in 
the 
water 
which 
had 
fallen 
too 
low 
to 
be 
raised 
through 
such 
a 
height; 
and 
he 
added 
that 
it 
was 
not 
possible, 
either 
by 
a 
pump 
or 
by 
any 
other 
machine 
working 
on 
the 
principle 
of 
attraction, 
to 
lift 
water 
a 
hair’s 
breadth 
above 
eighteen 
cubits; 
whether 
the 
pump 
be 
large 
or 
small 
this 
is 
the 
extreme 
limit 
of 
the 
lift. 
Up 
to 
this 
time 
I 
had 
been 
so 
thoughtless 
that, 
although 
I 
knew 
a 
rope, 
or 
rod 
of 
wood, 
or 
of 
iron, 
if 
sufficiently 
long, 
would 
break 
by 
its 
own 
weight 
when 
held 
by 
the 
upper 
end, 
it 
never 
occurred 
to 
me 
that 
the 
same 
thing 
would 
happen, 
only 
much 
more 
easily, 
to 
a 
column 
of 
water. 
And 
really 
is 
not 
that 
thing 
which 
is 
attracted 
in 
the 
pump 
a 
column 
of 
water 
attached 
at 
the 
upper 
end 
and 
stretched 
more 
and 
more 
until 
finally 
a 
point 
is 
reached 
whereitbreaks, 
likearope,on 
accountofitsexcessiveweight? 


Salv. 
That 
is 
precisely 
the 
way 
it 
works; 
this 
fixed 
elevation 
of 
eighteen 
cubits 
is 
true 
for 
any 
quantity 
of 
water 
whatever, 
be 
the 
pump 
large 
or 
small 
or 
even 
as 
fine 
as 
a 
straw. 
We 
may 
therefore 
say 
that, 
on 
weighing 
the 
water 
contained 
in 
a 
tube 
eighteen 
cubits 
long, 
no 
matter 
what 
the 
diameter, 
we 
shall 
obtain 
the 
value 
of 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
vacuum 
in 
a 
cylinder 
of 
any 
solid 
material 
having 
a 
bore 
of 
this 
same 
diameter. 
And 
having 
gone 
so 
far, 
let 
us 
see 
how 
easy 
it 
is 
to 
find 
to 
what 
length 
cylinders 
of 
metal, 
stone, 
wood, 
glass, 
etc., 
of 
any 
diameter 
can 
be 
elongated 
without 
breaking 
by 
their 
ownweight. 


Sagr. 
It 
still 
remains 
for 
you 
to 
tell 
us 
upon 
what 
depends 
the 
resistance 
to 
breaking, 
other 
than 
that 
of 
the 
vacuum; 
what 
is 
the 
gluey 
or 
viscous 
substance 
which 
cements 
together 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
solid? 
For 
I 
cannot 
imagine 
a 
glue 
that 
will 
not 
burn 
up 
in 
a 
highly 
heated 
furnace 
in 
two 
or 
three 
months, 
or 
certainlywithinten 
orahundred. 
For 
if 
gold, 
silverandglass 
are 
kept 
fora 
long 
while 
in 
the 
molten 
state 
and 
are 
removed 
from 
the 
furnace, 
their 
parts, 



on 
cooling, 
immediately 
reunite 
and 
bind 
themselves 
together 
as 
before. 
Not 
only 
so, 
but 
whatever 
difficulty 
arises 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
cementation 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
glass 
arises 
also 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
glue; 
in 
other 
words,whatis 
thatwhichholdsthesepartstogether 
sofirmly? 


A 
little 
while 
ago, 
I 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
your 
good 
angel 
might 
assist 
you. 
I 
now 
find 
myself 
in 
the 
same 
straits. 
Experiment 
leaves 
no 
doubt 
that 
the 
reason 
why 
two 
plates 
cannot 
be 
separated, 
except 
with 
violent 
effort, 
is 
that 
they 
are 
held 
together 
by 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
vacuum; 
and 
the 
same 
can 
be 
said 
of 
two 
large 
pieces 
of 
a 
marble 
or 
bronze 
column. 
This 
being 
so, 
I 
do 
not 
see 
why 
this 
same 
cause 
may 
not 
explain 
the 
coherence 
of 
smaller 
parts 
and 
indeed 
of 
the 
very 
smallest 
particles 
of 
these 
materials. 
Now, 
since 
each 
effect 
must 
have 
one 
true 
and 
sufficient 
cause 
and 
since 
I 
find 
no 
other 
cement, 
am 
I 
not 
justified 
in 
trying 
to 
discover 
whether 
the 
vacuum 
is 
not 
a 
sufficientcause? 


Simp. 
But 
seeing 
that 
you 
have 
already 
proved 
that 
the 
resistance 
which 
the 
large 
vacuum 
offers 
to 
the 
separation 
of 
two 
large 
parts 
of 
a 
solid 
is 
really 
very 
small 
in 
comparison 
with 
that 
cohesive 
force 
which 
binds 
together 
the 
most 
minute 
parts, 
why 
do 
you 
hesitate 
to 
regard 
this 
latter 
as 
something 
very 
differentfromtheformer? 


Salv. 
Sagredo 
has 
already 
[p. 
13 
above] 
answered 
this 
question 
when 
he 
remarked 
that 
each 
individual 
soldier 
was 
being 
paid 
from 
coin 
collected 
by 
a 
general 
tax 
of 
pennies 
and 
farthings, 
while 
even 
a 
million 
of 
gold 
would 
not 
suffice 
to 
pay 
the 
entire 
army. 
And 
who 
knows 
but 
that 
there 
may 
be 
other 
extremely 
minute 
vacua 
which 
affect 
the 
smallest 
particles 
so 
that 
that 
which 
binds 
together 
the 
contiguous 
parts 
is 
throughout 
of 
the 
same 
mintage? 
Let 
me 
tell 
you 
something 
which 
has 
just 
occurred 
to 
me 
and 
which 
I 
do 
not 
offer 
as 
an 
absolute 
fact, 
but 
rather 
as 
a 
passing 
thought, 
still 
immature 
and 
calling 
for 
more 
careful 
consideration. 
You 
may 
take 
of 
it 
what 
you 
like; 
and 
judge 
the 
rest 
as 
you 
see 
fit. 
Sometimes 
when 
I 
have 
observed 
how 
fire 
winds 
its 
way 
in 
between 
the 
most 
minute 
particles 
of 
this 
or 
that 
metal 
and, 
even 
though 
these 
are 
solidly 
cemented 
together, 
tears 
them 
apart 
and 
separates 
them, 
and 
when 
I 
have 
observed 
that, 
on 
removing 
the 
fire, 
these 
particles 
reunite 
with 
the 
same 
tenacity 
as 
at 
first, 
without 
any 
loss 
of 
quantity 
in 
the 
case 
of 
gold 
and 
with 
little 
loss 
in 
the 
case 
of 
other 
metals, 
even 
though 
these 
parts 
have 
been 
separated 
for 
a 
long 
while, 
I 
have 
thought 
that 
the 



explanation 
might 
lie 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
extremely 
fine 
particles 
of 
fire, 
penetrating 
the 
slender 
pores 
of 
the 
metal 
(too 
small 
to 
admit 
even 
the 
finest 
particles 
of 
air 
or 
of 
many 
other 
fluids), 
would 
fill 
the 
small 
intervening 
vacua 
and 
would 
set 
free 
these 
small 
particles 
from 
the 
attraction 
which 
these 
same 
vacua 
exert 
upon 
them 
and 
which 
prevents 
their 
separation. 
Thus 
the 
particles 
are 
able 
to 
move 
freely 
so 
that 
the 
mass 
[massa] 
becomes 
fluid 
and 
remains 
so 
as 
long 
as 
the 
particles 
of 
fire 
remain 
inside; 
but 
if 
they 
depart 
and 
leave 
the 
former 
vacua 
then 
the 
original 
attraction 
[attrazzione] 
returns 
and 
thepartsareagain 
cemented 
together. 


In 
reply 
to 
the 
question 
raised 
by 
Simplicio, 
one 
may 
say 
that 
although 
each 
particular 
vacuum 
is 
exceedingly 
minute 
and 
therefore 
easily 
overcome, 
yet 
their 
number 
is 
so 
extraordinarily 
great 
that 
their 
combined 
resistance 
is, 
so 
to 
speak, 
multipled 
almost 
without 
limit. 
The 
nature 
and 
the 
amount 
of 
force[forza]whichresults[risulta] 
from 
adding 
together 
an 
immense 
number 
of 
small 
forces 
[debolissimi 
momenti] 
is 
clearly 
illustrated 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
weight 
of 
millions 
of 
pounds, 
suspended 
by 
great 
cables, 
is 
overcome 
and 
lifted, 
when 
the 
south 
wind 
carries 
innumerable 
atoms 
of 
water, 
suspended 
in 
thin 
mist, 
which 
moving 
through 
the 
air 
penetrate 
between 
the 
fibres 
of 
the 
tense 
ropes 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
tremendous 
force 
of 
the 
hanging 
weight. 
When 
these 
particles 
enter

There 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
that 
any 
resistance, 
so 
long 
as 
it 
is 
not 
infinite, 
may 
be 
overcome 
by 
a 
multitude 
of 
minute 
forces. 
Thus 
a 
vast 
number 
of 
ants 
might 
carry 
ashore 
a 
ship 
laden 
with 
grain. 
And 
since 
experience 
shows 
us 
daily 
that 
one 
ant 
can 
easily 
carry 
one 
grain, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
number 
of 
grains 
in 
the 
ship 
is 
not 
infinite, 
but 
falls 
below 
a 
certain 
limit. 
If 
you 
take 
another 
number 
four 
or 
six 
times 
as 
great, 
and 
if 
you 
set 
to 
work 
a 
corresponding 
number 
of 
ants 
they 
will 
carry 
the 
grain 
ashore 
and 
the 
boat 
also. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
this 
will 
call 
for 
a 
prodigious 
number 
of 
ants, 
but 
in 
my 
opinion 
this 
is 
precisely 
the 
case 
with 
the 
vacua 
which 
bind 
together 
the 
least

But 
even 
if 
this

would 
you

Otherwise

Now 
since 
we 
have 
arrived 
at 
paradoxes 
let 
us 
see 
if 
we 
cannot 
prove 
that 
within 
a 
finite 
extent 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
discover 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
vacua. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
we 
shall 
at 
least 
reach 
a 
solution 
of 
the 
most 
remarkable 
of 
all 
that 
list 
of 
problems 
which 
Aristotle 
himself 
calls 
wonderful; 
I 
refer 
to 
his 
Questions 
in 
Mechanics. 
This 
solution 
may 
be 
no 
less 
clear 
and 
conclusive 
than 
that 
which 
he 
himself 
gives 
and 
quite 
different 
also 
from 
that 
so 
cleverly 
expounded 
by 
the 
most

First 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
consider 
a 
proposition, 
not 
treated 
by 
others, 
but 
upon 
which 
depends 
the 
solution 
of 
the 
problem 
and 
from 
which, 
if 
I 
mistake 
not, 
we 
shall 
derive 
other 
new 
and 
remarkable 
facts. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
clearness 
let 
us 
draw 
an 
accurate 
figure. 
About 
G 
as 
a 
center 
describe 
an 
equiangular 
and 
equilateral 
polygon 
of 
any 
number 
of 
sides, 
say 
the 
hexagon 
ABCDEF. 
Similar 
to 
this 
and 
concentric 
with 
it, 
describe 
another 
smaller 
one 
which 
we 
shall 
call 
HIKLMN. 
Prolong 
the 
side 
AB, 
of 
the 
larger 
hexagon, 
indefinitely 
toward 
S; 
in 
like 
manner 
prolong 
the 
corresponding 
side 
HI 
of 
the 
smaller 
hexagon, 
in 
the 
same 
direction, 
so 
that 
the 
line 
HT 
is 
parallel 
to 
AS; 
and 
through 
the 
center 
draw 
the 
line 
GV 
parallel 
to 
the 
other 
two. 
This 
done, 
imagine 
the 
larger 
polygon 
to 
roll 
upon 
the 
line 
AS, 
carrying 
with 
it 
the 
smaller 
polygon. 
It 
is 
evident 
that, 
if 
the 
point 
B, 
the 
end 
of 
the 
side 
AB, 
remains 
fixed 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
rotation, 
the 
point 
A 
will 
rise 
and 
the 
point 
C 
will 
fall 
describing 
the 
arc 
CQ 
until 
the 
side 
BC 
coincides 
with 
the 
line 
BQ, 
equal 
to 
BC. 
But 
during 
this 
rotation 
the 
point 
I, 
on 
the 
smaller 
polygon, 
will 
rise 
above 
the 
line 
IT 
because 
IB 
is 
oblique 
to 
AS; 
and 
it 
will 
notagain 
return 
tothe 
line 
ITuntil 
thepoint 
C 
shallhave 
reached 
theposition 


Q. 
The 
point 
I, 
having 
described 
the 
arc 
IO 
above 
the 
line 
HT, 
will 
reach 
the 
position 
O 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
side 
IK 
assumes 
the 
position 
OP; 
but 
in 
the 
meantime 
the 
center 
G 
has 
traversed 
a 
path 
above 
GV 
and 
does 
not 
return 
to 
it 
until 
it 
has 
completed 
the 
arc 
GC. 
This 
step 
having 
been 
taken, 
the 
larger 
polygon 
has 
been 
brought 
to 
rest 
with 
its 
side 
BC 
coinciding 
with 
the 
line 
BQ 
while 
the 
side 
IK 
of 
the 
smaller 
polygon 
has 
been 
made 
to 
coincide 
with 
the 
line 
OP, 
having 
passed 
over 
the 
portion 
IO 
without 
touching 
it; 
also 
the 
center 
G 
will 
have 
reached 
the 
position 
C 
after 
having 
traversed 
all 
its 
course 
above 
the 
parallel 
line 
GV. 
And 
finally 
the 
entire 
figure 
will 
assume 
a 

positionsimilar 
to 
the 
first, 
so 
that 
if 
we 
continue 
therotation 
and 
come 
to 
the 
next 
step, 
the 
side 
DC 
of 
the 
larger 
polygon 
will 
coincide 
with 
the 
portion 
QX 
and 
the 
side 
KL 
of 
the 
smaller 
polygon, 
having 
first 
skipped 
the 
arc 
PY, 
will 
fall 
on 
YZ, 
while 
the 
center 
still 
keeping 
above 
the 
line 
GV 
will 
return 
to 
it 
at 
R 
after 
having 
jumped 
the 
interval 
CR. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
one 
complete 
rotation 
the 
larger 
polygon 
will 
have 
traced 
upon 
the 
line 
AS, 
without 
break, 
six 
lines 
together 
equal 
to 
its 
perimeter; 
the 
lesser 
polygon 
will 
likewise 
have 
imprinted 
six 
lines 
equal 
to 
its 
perimeter, 
but 
separated 
by 
the 
interposition 
of 
five 
arcs, 
whose 
chords 
represent 
the 
parts 
of 
HT 
not 
touched 
by 
the 
polygon: 
the 
center 
G 
never 
reaches 
the 
line 
GV 
except 
at 
six 
points. 
From 
this 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
space 
traversed 
by 
the 
smaller 
polygon 
is 
almost 
equal 
to 
that 
traversed 
by 
the 
larger, 
that 
is, 
the 
line 
HT 
approximates 
the 
line 
AS, 
differing 
from 
it 
only 
by 
the 
length 
of 
one 
chord 
of 
one 
of 
these 
arcs, 


providedweunderstandthelineHTtoincludethefiveskippedarcs.
Now 
this 
exposition 
which 
I 
have 
given 
in 
the 
case 
of 
these 
hexagons 
must 
be 
understood 
to 
be 
applicable 
to 
all 
other 
polygons, 
whatever 
the 
number 
of 
sides, 
provided 
only 
they 
are 
similar, 
concentric, 
and 
rigidly 
connected, 
so 
that 
when 
the 
greater 
one 
rotates 
the 
lesser 
will 
also 
turn 
however 
small 
it 
may 
be. 
You 
must 
also 
understand 
that 
the 
lines 
described 
by 
these 
two 
are 
nearly 
equal 
provided 
we 
include 
in 
the 
space 
traversed 
by 



the 
smaller 
one 
the 
intervals 
which 
are 
not 
touched 
by 
any 
part 
of 
the 
perimeterofthissmallerpolygon. 


Let 
a 
large 
polygon 
of, 
say, 
one 
thousand 
sides 
make 
one 
complete 
rotation 
and 
thus 
lay 
off 
a 
line 
equal 
to 
its 
perimeter; 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
small 
one 
will 
pass 
over 
an 
approximately 
equal 
distance, 
made 
up 
of 
a 
thousand 
small 
portions 
each 
equal 
to 
one 
of 
its 
sides, 
but 
interrupted 
by 
a 
thousand 
spaces 
which, 
in 
contrast 
with 
the 
portions 
that 
coincide 
with 
the 
sides 
of 
the 
polygon, 
we 
may 
call 
empty. 
So 
far 
the 
matter 
is 
free 
from 
difficultyordoubt. 


But 
now 
suppose 
that 
about 
any 
center, 
say 
A, 
we 
describe 
two 
concentric 
and 
rigidly 
connected 
circles; 
and 
suppose 
that 
from 
the 
points 
C 
and 
B, 
on 
their 
radii, 
there 
are 
drawn 
the 
tangents 
CE 
and 
BF 
and 
that 
through 
the 
center 
A 
the 
line 
AD 
is 
drawn 
parallel 
to 
them, 
then 
if 
the 
large 
circle 
makes 
one 
complete 
rotation 
along 
the 
line 
BF, 
equal 
not 
only 
to 
its 
circumference 
butalsoto 
theother 
two 
linesCE 
and 
AD, 
tellmewhat 
thesmallercirclewill 
do 
and 
also 
what 
the 
center 
will 
do. 
As 
to 
the 
center 
it 
will 
certainly 
traverse 
and 
touch 
the 
entire 
line 
AD 
while 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
smaller 
circle 
will 
have 
measured 
off 
by 
its 
points 
of 
contact 
the 
entire 
line 
CE, 
just 
as 
was 
done 
by 
the 
above 
mentioned 
polygons. 
The 
only 
difference 
is 
that 
the 
line 
HT 
was 
not 
at 
every 
point 
in 
contact 
with 
the 
perimeter 
of 
the 
smaller 
polygon, 
but 
there 
were 
left 
untouched 
as 
many 
vacant 
spaces 
as 
there 
were 
spaces 
coinciding 
with 
the 
sides. 
But 
here 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
circles 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
smaller 
one 
never 
leaves 
the 
line 
CE, 
so 
that 
no 
part 
of 
the 
latter 
is 
left 
untouched, 
nor 
is 
there 
ever 
a 
time 
when 
some 
point 
on 
the 
circle 
is 
not 
in 
contact 
with 
the 
straight 
line. 
How 
now 
can 
the 
smaller 
circle 
traverse 
alengthgreaterthanits 
circumferenceunlessit 
gobyjumps? 


Sagr. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
one 
may 
say 
that 
just 
as 
the 
center 
of 
the 
circle, 
by 
itself, 
carried 
along 
the 
line 
AD 
is 
constantly 
in 
contact 
with 
it, 
although 
it 
is 
only 
a 
single 
point, 
so 
the 
points 
on 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
smaller 
circle, 
carried 
along 
by 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
larger 
circle, 
would 
slide 
over 
some 
small 
partsofthelineCE. 


There 
are 
two 
reasons 
why 
this 
cannot 
happen. 
First 
because 
there 
is 
no 
ground 
for 
thinking 
that 
one 
point 
of 
contact, 
such 
as 
that 
at 
C, 
rather 
than 
another, 
should 
slip 
over 
certain 
portions 
of 
the 
line 
CE. 
But 
if 
such 
slidings 
along 
CE 
did 
occur 
they 
would 
be 
infinite 
in 
number 
since 
the 
points 
of 
contact 
(being 
mere 
points) 
are 
infinite 
in 
number: 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 



finiteslips 
will 
however 
makean 
infinitely 
longline, 
while 
as 
a 
matter 
offact 
the 
line 
CE 
is 
finite. 
The 
other 
reason 
is 
that 
as 
the 
greater 
circle, 
in 
its 
rotation, 
changes 
its 
point 
of 
contact 
continuously 
the 
lesser 
circle 
must 
do 
the 
same 
because 
B 
is 
the 
only 
point 
from 
which 
a 
straight 
line 
can 
be 
drawn 
to 
A 
and 
pass 
through 
C. 
Accordingly 
the 
small 
circle 
must 
change 
its 
point 
of 
contact 
whenever 
the 
large 
one 
changes: 
no 
point 
of 
the 
small 
circle 
touches 
the 
straight 
line 
CE 
in 
more 
than 
one 
point. 
Not 
only 
so, 
but 
even 
in 
the 
rotation 
of 
the 
polygons 
there 
was 
no 
point 
on 
the 
perimeter 
of 
the 
smaller 
which 
coincided 
with 
more 
than 
one 
point 
on 
the 
line 
traversed 
by 
that 
perimeter; 
this 
is 
at 
once 
clear 
when 
you 
remember 
that 
the 
line 
IK 
is 
parallel 
to 
BC 
and 
that 
therefore 
IK 
will 
remain 
above 
IP 
until 
BC 
coincides 
with 
BQ, 
and 
that 
IK 
will 
not 
lie 
upon 
IP 
except 
at 
the 
very 
instant 
when 
BC 
occupies 
the 
position 
BQ; 
at 
this 
instant 
the 
entire 
line 
IK 
coincides 
with 
OP 
and 
immediatelyafterwardsrisesaboveit.

Let 
us 
return 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
above 
mentioned 
polygons 
whose 
behavior 
we 
already 
understand. 
Now 
in 
the 
case 
of 
polygons 
with 
100000 
sides, 
the 
line 
traversed 
by 
the 
perimeter 
of 
the 
greater, 
i. 
e., 
the 
line 
laid 
down 
by 
its 
100000 
sides 
one 
after 
another, 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
line 
traced 
out 
by 
the 
100000 
sides 
of 
the 
smaller, 
provided 
we 
include 
the 
100000 
vacant 
spaces 
interspersed. 
So 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
circles, 
polygons 
having 
an 
infinitude 
of 
sides, 
the 
line 
traversed 
by 
the 
continuously 
distributed 
[continuamente 
disposti]infinitudeofsides 
isin 
thegreatercircleequaltothe 
line 
laid 
down 
by 
the 
infinitude 
of 
sides 
in 
the 
smaller 
circle 
but 
with 
the 
exception 
that 
these 
latter 
alternate 
with 
empty 
spaces; 
and 
since 
the 
sides 
are 
not 
finite 
in 
number, 
but 
infinite, 
so 
also 
are 
the 
intervening 
empty 
spaces 
not 
finite 
but 
infinite. 
The 
line 
traversed 
by 
the 
larger 
circle 
consists 
then 
of 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
points 
which 
completely 
fill 
it; 
while 
that 
which 
is 
traced 
by 
the 
smaller 
circle 
consists 
of 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
points 
which 
leave 
empty 
spaces 
and 
only 
partly 
fill 
the 
line. 
And 
here 
I 
wish 
you 
to 
observe 
that 
after 
dividing 
and 
resolving 
a 
line 
into 
a 
finite 
number 
of 
parts, 
that 
is, 
into 
a 
number 
which 
can 
be 
counted, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
arrange 
them 
again 
into 
a 
greater 
length 
than 
that 
which 
they 
occupied 
when 
they 
formed 
a 
continuum 
[continuate] 
and 
were 
connected 
without 
the 
interposition 
of 
as 
many 
empty 
spaces. 
But 
if 
we 
consider 
the 
line 
resolved 
into 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
infinitely 
small 
and 
indivisible 
parts, 
we 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
conceive 
the 
line 



extended 
indefinitely 
by 
the 
interposition, 
not 
of 
a 
finite, 
but 
of 
an 
infinite 
numberofinfinitelysmallindivisibleempty 
spaces. 


Now 
this 
which 
has 
been 
said 
concerning 
simple 
lines 
must 
be 
understood 
to 
hold 
also 
in 
the 
case 
of 
surfaces 
and 
solid 
bodies, 
it 
being 
assumed 
that 
they 
are 
made 
up 
of 
an 
infinite, 
not 
a 
finite, 
number 
of 
atoms. 
Such 
a 
body 
once 
divided 
into 
a 
finite 
number 
of 
parts 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
reassemble 
them 
so 
as 
to 
occupy 
more 
space 
than 
before 
unless 
we 
interpose 
a 
finite 
number 
of 
empty 
spaces, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
spaces 
free 
from 
the 
substance 
of 
which 
the 
solid 
is 
made. 
But 
if 
we 
imagine 
the 
body, 
by 
some 
extreme 
and 
final 
analysis, 
resolved 
into 
its 
primary 
elements, 
infinite 
in 
number, 
then 
we 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
think 
of 
them 
as 
indefinitely 
extended 
in 
space, 
not 
by 
the 
interposition 
of 
a 
finite, 
but 
of 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
empty 
spaces. 
Thus 
one 
can 
easily 
imagine 
a 
small 
ball 
of 
gold 
expanded 
into 
a 
very 
large 
space 
without 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
finite 
number 
of 
empty 
spaces, 
always 
provided 
thegoldismade 
upofan 
infinite 
number 
ofindivisible 
parts. 


Simp. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
you 
are 
travelling 
along 
toward 
those 
vacua 
advocatedbyacertainancientphilosopher. 


Salv. 
But 
you 
have 
failed 
to 
add, 
“who 
denied 
Divine 
Providence,” 
an 
inapt 
remark 
made 
on 
a 
similar 
occasion 
by 
a 
certain 
antagonist 
of 
our 
Academician. 


Simp. 
I 
noticed, 
and 
not 
without 
indignation, 
the 
rancor 
of 
this 
ill-natured 
opponent; 
further 
references 
to 
these 
affairs 
I 
omit, 
not 
only 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
good 
form, 
but 
also 
because 
I 
know 
how 
unpleasant 
they 
are 
to 
the 
good 
tempered 
and 
well 
ordered 
mind 
of 
one 
so 
religious 
and 
pious, 
so 
orthodox 
and 
God-fearing 
asyou. 


But 
to 
return 
to 
our 
subject, 
your 
previous 
discourse 
leaves 
with 
me 
many 
difficulties 
which 
I 
am 
unable 
to 
solve. 
First 
among 
these 
is 
that, 
if 
the 
circumferences 
of 
the 
two 
circles 
are 
equal 
to 
the 
two 
straight 
lines, 
CE 
and 
BF, 
the 
latter 
considered 
as 
a 
continuum, 
the 
former 
as 
interrupted 
with 
an 
infinity 
of 
empty 
points, 
I 
do 
not 
see 
how 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
say 
that 
the 
line 
AD 
described 
by 
the 
center, 
and 
made 
up 
of 
an 
infinity 
of 
points, 
is 
equal 
to 
this 
center 
which 
is 
a 
single 
point. 
Besides, 
this 
building 
up 
of 
lines 
out 
of 
points, 
divisibles 
out 
of 
indivisibles, 
andfinites 
out 
of 
infinites, 
offers 
me 
an 
obstacle 



difficult 
to 
avoid; 
and 
the 
necessity 
of 
introducing 
a 
vacuum, 
so 
conclusively 
refutedbyAristotle,presents 
the 
same 
difficulty. 


These 
difficulties 
are 
real; 
and 
they 
are 
not 
the 
only 
ones. 
But 
let 
us 
remember 
that 
we 
are 
dealing 
with 
infinities 
and 
indivisibles, 
both 
of 
which 
transcend 
our 
finite 
understanding, 
the 
former 
on 
account 
of 
their 
magnitude, 
the 
latter 
because 
of 
their 
smallness. 
In 
spite 
of 
this, 
men 
cannot 
refrain 
from 
discussingthem,eventhoughitmust 
bedonein 
around-aboutway. 


Therefore 
I 
also 
should 
like 
to 
take 
the 
liberty 
to 
present 
some 
of 
my 
ideas 
which,thoughnotnecessarily 
convincing,would,onaccountof 
theirnovelty, 
at 
least, 
prove 
somewhat 
startling. 
But 
such 
a 
diversion 
might 
perhaps 
carry 
us 
too 
far 
away 
from 
the 
subject 
under 
discussion 
and 
might 
therefore 
appear 
toyouinopportuneandnotverypleasing. 


Sagr. 
Pray 
let 
us 
enjoy 
the 
advantages 
and 
privileges 
which 
come 
from 
conversation 
between 
friends, 
especially 
upon 
subjects 
freely 
chosen 
and 
not 
forced 
upon 
us, 
a 
matter 
vastly 
different 
from 
dealing 
with 
dead 
books 
which 
give 
rise 
to 
many 
doubts 
but 
remove 
none. 
Share 
with 
us, 
therefore, 
the 
thoughts 
which 
our 
discussion 
has 
suggested 
to 
you; 
for 
since 
we 
are 
free 
from 
urgent 
business 
there 
will 
be 
abundant 
time 
to 
pursue 
the 
topics 
already 
mentioned; 
and 
in 
particular 
the 
objections 
raised 
by 
Simplicio 
ought 
not 
in 
any 
wisetobe 
neglected. 


Salv. 
Granted, 
since 
you 
so 
desire. 
The 
first 
question 
was, 
How 
can 
a 
single 
point 
be 
equal 
to 
a 
line? 
Since 
I 
cannot 
do 
more 
at 
present 
I 
shall 
attempt 
to 
remove, 
or 
at 
least 
diminish, 
one 
improbability 
by 
introducing 
a 
similar 
or 
a 
greaterone,justassometimes 
awonderisdiminished 
bya

[Trans.] 


And 
this 
I 
shall 
do 
by 
showing 
you 
two 
equal 
surfaces, 
together 
with 
two 
equal 
solids 
located 
upon 
these 
same 
surfaces 
as 
bases, 
all 
four 
of 
which 
diminish 
continuously 
and 
uniformly 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
their 
remainders 
always 
preserve 
equality 
among 
themselves, 
and 
finally 
both 
the 
surfaces 
and 
the 
solids 
terminate 
their 
previous 
constant 
equality 
by 
degenerating, 
the 
one 
solid 
and 
the 
one 
surface 
into 
a 
very 
long 
line, 
the 
other 
solid 
and 
the 
other 
surface 
into 
a 
single 
point; 
that 
is, 
the 
latter 
to 
one 
point, 
the 
former 
to 
an 
infinitenumberofpoints. 



This 
proposition 
appears 
to 
me 
wonderful, 
indeed; 
but 
let 
us 
hear 
the 
explanationanddemonstration. 


Salv. 
Since 
the 
proof 
is 
purely 
geometrical 
we 
shall 
need 
a 
figure. 
Let 
AFB 
be 
a 
semicircle 
with 
center 
at 
C; 
about 
it 
describe 
the 
rectangle 
ADEB 
and 
from 
the 
center 
draw 
the 
straight 
lines 
CD 
and 
CE 
to 
the 
points 
D 
and 
E. 
Imagine 
the 
radius 
CF 
to 
be 
drawn 
perpendicular 
to 
either 
of 
the 
lines 
AB 
or 
DE, 
and 
the 
entire 
figure 
to 
rotate 
about 
this 
radius 
as 
an 
axis. 
It 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
rectangle 
ADEB 
will 
thus 
describe 
a 
cylinder, 
the 
semicircle 
AFB 
a 
hemisphere, 
and 
the 
triangle 
CDE, 
a 
cone. 
Next 
let 
us 
remove 
the 
hemisphere 
but 
leave 
the 
cone 
and 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
cylinder, 
which, 
on 
account 
of 
its 
shape, 
we 
will 
call 
a 
“bowl.” 
First 
we 
shall 
prove 
that 
the 
bowl 
and 
the 
cone 
are 
equal; 
then 
we 
shall 
show 
that 
a 
plane 
drawn 
parallel 
to 
the 
circle 
which 
forms 
the 
baseofthebowlandwhich 
has 
thelineDEfor 
diameterand 
Ffora 
center 
— 
a 
plane 
whose 
trace 
is 
GN 
— 
cuts 
the 
bowl 
in 
the 
points 
G, 
I, 
O, 
N, 
and 
the 
cone 
in 
the 
points 
H, 
L, 
so 
that 
the 
part 
of 
the 
cone 
indicated 
by 
CHL 
is 
always 
equal 
to 
the 
part 
of 
the 
bowl 
whose 
profile 
is 
represented 
by 
the 
triangles 
GAI 
and 
BON. 
Besides 
this 
we 
shall 
prove 
that 
the 
base 
of 
the 
cone, 


i. 
e., 
the 
circle 
whose 
diameter 
is 
HL, 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
circular 
surface 
which 
forms 
the 
base 
of 
this 
portion 
of 
the 
bowl, 
or 
as 
one 
might 
say, 
equal 
to 
a 
ribbon 
whose 
width 
is 
GI. 
(Note 
by 
the 
way 
the 
nature 
of 
mathematical 
definitions 
which 
consist 
merely 
in 
the 
imposition 
of 
names 
or, 
if 
you 
prefer, 
abbreviations 
of 
speech 
established 
and 
introduced 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
the 
tedious 
drudgery 
which 
you 
and 
I 
now 
experience 
simply 
because 
we 
have 
not 
agreed 
to 
call 
this 
surface 
a 
“circular 
band” 
and 
that 
sharp 
solid 
portion 
of 
the 
bowl 
a 
“round 
razor.”) 
Now 
call 
them 
by 
what 
name 
you 
please, 
it 
suffices 
to 
understand 
that 
the 
plane, 
drawn 
at 
any 
height 
whatever, 
so 
long 
as 
it 
is 
parallel 
to 
the 
base, 
i. 
e., 
to 
the 
circle 
whose 
diameter 
is 
DE, 
always 
cuts 
the 
two 
solids 
so 
that 
the 
portion 
CHL 
of 
the 
cone 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
upper 
portion 
of 
the 
bowl; 
likewise 
the 
two 
areas 
which 
are 
the 
bases 
of 
these 
solids, 
namely 
the 
band 
and 
the 
circle 
HL, 
are 
also 
equal. 
Here 
we 
have 
the 
miracle 
mentioned 
above; 
as 
the 
cutting 
plane 
approaches 
the 
line 
AB 
the 
portions 
of 
the 
solids 
cut 
off 
are 
always 
equal, 
so 
also 
the 
areas 
of 
their 
bases. 
And 
as 
the 
cutting 
plane 
comes 
near 
the 
top, 
the 
two 
solids 
(always 
equal) 
as 
well 
as 
their 
bases 
(areas 
which 
are 
also 
equal) 
finally 
vanish, 
one 
pair 
of 
them 
degenerating 
into 
the 
circumference 
of 
a 
circle, 
the 
other 
into 
a 
single 
point, 
namely, 
the 
upper 
edge 
of 
the 
bowl 
and 
the 
apex 
of 
the 
cone. 
Now, 

since 
as 
these 
solids 
diminish 
equality 
is 
maintained 
between 
them 
up 
to 
the 
very 
last, 
we 
are 
justified 
in 
saying 
that, 
at 
the 
extreme 
and 
final 
end 
of 
this 
diminution, 
they 
are 
still 
equal 
and 
that 
one 
is 
not 
infinitely 
greater 
than 
the 
other. 
It 
appears 
therefore 
that 
we 
may 
equate 
the 
circumference 
of 
a 
large 
circle 
to 
a 
single 
point. 
And 
this 
which 
is 
true 
of 
the 
solids 
is 
true 
also 
of 
the 
surfaces 
which 
form 
their 
bases; 
for 
these 
also 
preserve 
equality 
between 
themselves 
throughout 
their 
diminution 
and 
in 
the 
end 
vanish, 
the 
one 
into 
the 
circumference 
of 
a 
circle, 
the 
other 
into 
a 
single 
point. 
Shall 
we 
not 
then 
call 
them 
equal 
seeing 
that 
they 
are 
the 
last 
traces 
and 
remnants 
of 
equal 
magnitudes? 
Note 
also 
that, 
even 
if 
these 
vessels 
were 
large 
enough 
to 
contain 
immense 
celestial 
hemispheres, 
both 
their 
upper 
edges 
andthe 
apexes 
of 
the 
cones 
therein 
contained 
would 
always 
remain 
equal 
and 
would 
vanish, 
the 
former 
into 
circles 
having 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
largest 
celestial 
orbits, 
the 
latter 
into 
single 
points. 
Hence 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
preceding 
we 
may 
say 
that 
all 
circumferences 
of 
circles, 
however 
different, 
are 
equal 
to 
each 


other,andareeachequaltoasinglepoint.
Sagr. 
This 
presentation 
strikes 
me 
as 
so 
clever 
and 
novel 
that, 
even 
if 
I 
were 
able, 
I 
would 
not 
be 
willing 
to 
oppose 
it; 
for 
to 
deface 
so 
beautiful 
a 
structure 
by 
a 
blunt 
pedantic 
attack 
would 
be 
nothing 
short 
of 
sinful. 
But 
for 
our 



complete 
satisfaction 
pray 
give 
us 
this 
geometrical 
proof 
that 
there 
is 
always 
equality 
between 
these 
solids 
and 
between 
their 
bases; 
for 
it 
cannot, 
I 
think, 
fail 
to 
be 
very 
ingenious, 
seeing 
how 
subtle 
is 
the 
philosophical 
argument 
baseduponthisresult. 


Salv. 
The 
demonstration 
is 
both 
short 
and 
easy. 
Referring 
to 
the 
preceding 
figure, 
since 
IPC 
is 
a 
right 
angle 
the 
square 
of 
the 
radius 
IC 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
squares 
on 
the 
two 
sides 
IP, 
PC; 
but 
the 
radius 
IC 
is 
equal 
to 
AC 
and 
also 
to 
GP, 
while 
CP 
is 
equal 
to 
PH. 
Hence 
the 
square 
of 
the 
line 
GP 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
squares 
of 
IP 
and 
PH, 
or 
multiplying 
through 
by 
4, 
we 
have 
the 
square 
of 
the 
diameter 
GN 
equal 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
squares 
on 
IO 
and 
HL. 
And, 
since 
the 
areas 
of 
circles 
are 
to 
each 
other 
as 
the 
squares 
of 
their 
diameters, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
area 
of 
the 
circle 
whose 
diameter 
is 
GN 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
areas 
of 
circles 
having 
diameters 
IO 
and 
HL, 
so 
that 
if 
we 
remove 
the 
common 
area 
of 
the 
circle 
having 
IO 
for 
diameter 
the 
remaining 
area 
of 
the 
circle 
GN 
will 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
area 
of 
the 
circle 
whose 
diameter 
is 
HL. 
So 
much 
for 
the 
first 
part. 
As 
for 
the 
other 
part, 
we 
leave 
its 
demonstration 
for 
the 
present, 
partly 
because 
those 
who 
wish 
to 
follow 
it 
will 
find 
it 
in 
the 
twelfth 
proposition 
of 
the 
second 
book 
of 
De 
centro 
gravitatis 
solidorum 
by 
the 
Archimedes 
of 
our 
age, 
Luca 
Valerio,8 
who 
made 
use 
of 
it 
for 
a 
different 
object, 
and 
partly 
because, 
for 
our 
purpose, 
it 
suffices 
to 
have 
seen 
that 
the 
above-mentioned 
surfaces 
are 
always 
equal 
and 
that, 
as 
they 
keep 
on 
diminishing 
uniformly, 
they 
degenerate, 
the 
one 
into 
a 
single 
point, 
the 
other 
into 
the 
circumference 
of 
a 
circle 
larger 
than 
any 
assignable;

The 
demonstration 
is 
ingenious 
and 
the 
inferences 
drawn 
from 
it 
are 
remarkable. 
And 
now 
let 
us 
hear 
something 
concerning 
the 
other 
difficulty 
raised 
by 
Simplicio, 
if 
you 
have 
anything 
special 
to 
say, 
which, 
however, 
seems 
to 
me 
hardly 
possible, 
since 
the 
matter 
has 
already 
been 
so 
thoroughly 
discussed. 


Salv. 
But 
I 
do 
have 
something 
special 
to 
say, 
and 
will 
first 
of 
all 
repeat 
what 
I 
said 
a 
little 
while 
ago, 
namely, 
that 
infinity 
and 
indivisibility 
are 
in 
their 
very 



nature 
incomprehensible 
to 
us; 
imagine 
then 
what 
they 
are 
when 
combined. 
Yet 
if 
we 
wish 
to 
build 
up 
a 
line 
out 
of 
indivisible 
points, 
we 
must 
take 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
them, 
and 
are, 
therefore, 
bound 
to 
understand 
both 
the 
infinite 
and 
the 
indivisible 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
Many 
ideas 
have 
passed 
through 
my 
mind 
concerning 
this 
subject, 
some 
of 
which, 
possibly 
the 
more 
important, 
I 
may 
not 
be 
able 
to 
recall 
on 
the 
spur 
of 
the 
moment; 
but 
in 
the 
course 
of 
our 
discussion 
it 
may 
happen 
that 
I 
shall 
awaken 
in 
you, 
and 
especially 
in 
Simplicio, 
objections 
and 
difficulties 
which 
in 
turn 
will 
bring 
to 
memory 
that 
which, 
without 
such 
stimulus, 
would 
have 
lain 
dormant 
in 
my 
mind. 
Allow 
me 
therefore 
the 
customary 
liberty 
of 
introducing 
some 
of 
our 
human 
fancies, 
for 
indeed 
we 
may 
so 
call 
them 
in 
comparison 
with 
supernatural 
truth 
which 
furnishes 
the 
one 
true 
and 
safe 
recourse 
for 
decision 
in 
our 
discussions 
and 
which 
is 
an 
infallible 
guide 
in 
the 
dark 
and 
dubious 
pathsofthought. 


One 
of 
the 
main 
objections 
urged 
against 
this 
building 
up 
of 
continuous 
quantities 
out 
of 
indivisible 
quantities 
[continuo 
d’ 
indivisibili] 
is 
that 
the 
addition 
of 
one 
indivisible 
to 
another 
cannot 
produce 
a 
divisible, 
for 
if 
this 
were 
so 
it 
would 
render 
the 
indivisible 
divisible. 
Thus 
if 
two 
indivisibles, 
say 
two 
points, 
can 
be 
united 
to 
form 
a 
quantity, 
say 
a 
divisible 
line, 
then 
an 
even 
more 
divisible 
line 
might 
be 
formed 
by 
the 
union 
of 
three, 
five, 
seven, 
or 
any 
other 
odd 
number 
of 
points. 
Since 
however 
these 
lines 
can 
be 
cut 
into 
two 
equal 
parts, 
it 
becomes 
possible 
to 
cut 
the 
indivisible 
which 
lies 
exactly 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
line. 
In 
answer 
to 
this 
and 
other 
objections 
of 
the 
same 
type 
we 
reply 
that 
a 
divisible 
magnitude 
cannot 
be 
constructed 
out 
of 
two 
or 
ten 
or 
a 
hundredorathousandindivisibles,butrequires 
aninfinitenumberofthem. 


Simp. 
Here 
a 
difficulty 
presents 
itself 
which 
appears 
to 
me 
insoluble. 
Since 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
we 
may 
have 
one 
line 
greater 
than 
another, 
each 
containing 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
points, 
we 
are 
forced 
to 
admit 
that, 
within 
one 
and 
the 
same 
class, 
we 
may 
have 
something 
greater 
than 
infinity, 
because 
the 
infinity 
of 
points 
in 
the 
long 
line 
is 
greater 
than 
the 
infinity 
of 
points 
in 
the 
short 
line. 
This 
assigning 
to 
an 
infinite 
quantity 
a 
value 
greater 
than 
infinity 
is 
quite 
beyondmycomprehension. 


Salv. 
This 
is 
one 
of 
the 
difficulties 
which 
arise 
when 
we 
attempt, 
with 
our 
finite 
minds, 
to 
discuss 
the 
infinite, 
assigning 
to 
it 
those 
properties 
which 
we 
give 
to 
the 
finite 
and 
limited; 
but 
this 
I 
think 
is 
wrong, 
for 
we 
cannot 
speak 
of 



infinite 
quantities 
as 
being 
the 
one 
greater 
or 
less 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
another. 
To 
prove 
this 
I 
have 
in 
mind 
an 
argument 
which, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
clearness, 
I 
shall 
putintheformof 
questionstoSimpliciowhoraisedthisdifficulty. 


I 
take 
it 
for 
granted 
that 
you 
know 
which 
of 
the 
numbers 
are 
squares 
and 
which 
arenot. 
Simp. 
I 
am 
quite 
aware 
that 
a 
squared 
number 
is 
one 
which 
results 
from 
the 
multiplication 
of 
another 
number 
by 
itself; 
thus 
4, 
9, 
etc., 
are 
squared 
numbers 
whichcomefrommultiplying2,3,etc.,bythemselves. 


Salv. 
Very 
well; 
and 
you 
also 
know 
that 
just 
as 
the 
products 
are 
called 
squares 
so 
the 
factors 
are 
called 
sides 
or 
roots; 
while 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
those 
numbers 
which 
do 
not 
consist 
of 
two 
equal 
factors 
are 
not 
squares. 
Therefore 
if 
I 
assert 
that 
all 
numbers, 
including 
both 
squares 
and 
non-squares, 
are 
more 
thanthesquaresalone,Ishallspeakthetruth, 
shallI 
not? 


Simp. 
Most 
certainly. 


Salv. 
If 
I 
should 
ask 
further 
how 
many 
squares 
there 
are 
one 
might 
reply 
truly 
that 
there 
are 
as 
many 
as 
the 
corresponding 
number 
of 
roots, 
since 
every 
square 
has 
its 
own 
root 
and 
every 
root 
its 
own 
square, 
while 
no 
square 
has 
morethanoneroot 
andno 
rootmorethanonesquare. 


Simp. 
Precisely 
so. 


Salv. 
But 
if 
I 
inquire 
how 
many 
roots 
there 
are, 
it 
cannot 
be 
denied 
that 
there 
are 
as 
many 
as 
there 
are 
numbers 
because 
every 
number 
is 
a 
root 
of 
some 
square. 
This 
being 
granted 
we 
must 
say 
that 
there 
are 
as 
many 
squares 
as 
there 
are 
numbers 
because 
they 
are 
just 
as 
numerous 
as 
their 
roots, 
and 
all 
the 
numbers 
are 
roots. 
Yet 
at 
the 
outset 
we 
said 
there 
are 
many 
more 
numbers 
than 
squares, 
since 
the 
larger 
portion 
of 
them 
are 
not 
squares. 
Not 
only 
so, 
but 
the 
proportionate 
number 
of 
squares 
diminishes 
as 
we 
pass 
to 
larger 
numbers. 
Thus 
up 
to 
100 
we 
have 
10 
squares, 
that 
is, 
the 
squares 
constitute 
1/10 
part 
of 
all 
the 
numbers; 
up 
to 
10000, 
we 
find 
only 
1/100 
part 
to 
be 
squares; 
and 
up 
to 
a 
million 
only 
1/1000 
part; 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
in 
an 
infinite 
number, 
if 
one 
could 
conceive 
of 
such 
a 
thing, 
he 
would 
be 
forced 
to 
admit 
that 
there 
areas 
many 
squares 
asthereare 
numbersalltakentogether. 


Sagr. 
Whatthenmustoneconcludeunderthesecircumstances? 



Salv. 
So 
far 
as 
I 
see 
we 
can 
only 
infer 
that 
the 
totality 
of 
all 
numbers 
is 
infinite, 
that 
the 
number 
of 
squares 
is 
infinite, 
and 
that 
the 
number 
of 
their 
roots 
is 
infinite; 
neither 
is 
the 
number 
of 
squares 
less 
than 
the 
totality 
of 
all 
numbers, 
nor 
the 
latter 
greater 
than 
the 
former; 
and 
finally 
the 
attributes 
“equal,” 
“greater,” 
and 
“less,” 
are 
not 
applicable 
to 
infinite, 
but 
only 
to 
finite, 
quantities. 
When 
therefore 
Simplicio 
introduces 
several 
lines 
of 
different 
lengths 
and 
asks 
me 
how 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
longer 
ones 
do 
not 
contain 
more 
points 
than 
the 
shorter, 
I 
answer 
him 
that 
one 
line 
does 
not 
contain 
more 
or 
less 
or 
just 
as 
many 
points 
as 
another, 
but 
that 
each 
line 
contains 
an 
infinite 
number. 
Or 
if 
I 
had 
replied 
to 
him 
that 
the 
points 
in 
one 
line 
were 
equal 
in 
number 
to 
the 
squares; 
in 
another, 
greater 
than 
the 
totality 
of 
numbers; 
and 
in 
the 
little 
one, 
as 
many 
as 
the 
number 
of 
cubes, 
might 
I 
not, 
indeed, 
have 
satisfied 
him 
by 
thus 
placing 
more 
points 
in 
one 
line 
than 
in 
another 
and 
yet 
maintaining 
an 
infinite 
number 
in 
each? 
So 
much 
for 
the 
first 
difficulty. 


Sagr. 
Pray 
stop 
a 
moment 
and 
let 
me 
add 
to 
what 
has 
already 
been 
said 
an 
idea 
which 
just 
occurs 
to 
me. 
If 
the 
preceding 
be 
true, 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
impossible 
to 
say 
either 
that 
one 
infinite 
number 
is 
greater 
than 
another 
or 
even 
that 
it 
is 
greater 
than 
a 
finite 
number, 
because 
if 
the 
infinite 
number 
were 
greater 
than, 
say, 
a 
million 
it 
would 
follow 
that 
on 
passing 
from 
the 
million 
to 
higher 
and 
higher 
numbers 
we 
would 
be 
approaching 
the 
infinite; 
but 
this 
is 
not 
so; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
larger 
the 
number 
to 
which 
we 
pass, 
the 
more 
we 
recede 
from 
[this 
property 
of] 
infinity, 
because 
the 
greater 
the 
numbers 
the 
fewer 
[relatively] 
are 
the 
squares 
contained 
in 
them; 
but 
the 
squares 
in 
infinity 
cannot 
be 
less 
than 
the 
totality 
of 
all 
the 
numbers, 
as 
we 
have 
just 
agreed; 
hence 
the 
approach 
to 
greater 
and 
greater 
numbers 
means 
a 
departurefrominfinity.10 


10 
Acertain 
confusion 
of 
thoughtappears 
to 
be 
introduced 
here 
through 
a 
failure 
todistinguishbetween 
the 
number 
n 
and 
the 
class 
of 
the 
first 
n 
numbers; 
and 
likewise 
from 
a 
failure 
to 
distinguish 
infinity 
as 
a 
number 
frominfinityas 
the 
classof 
all 
numbers. 
[Trans.] 


Salv. 
And 
thus 
from 
your 
ingenious 
argument 
we 
are 
led 
to 
conclude 
that 
the 
attributes 
“larger,” 
“smaller,” 
and 
“equal” 
have 
no 
place 
either 
in 
comparing 
infinite 
quantities 
with 
each 
other 
or 
in 
comparing 
infinite 
with 
finite 
quantities. 



I 
pass 
now 
to 
another 
consideration. 
Since 
lines 
and 
all 
continuous 
quantities 
are 
divisible 
into 
parts 
which 
are 
themselves 
divisible 
without 
end, 
Ido 
notseehowitispossibletoavoidthe 
conclusion 
that 
theselines 
are 
built 
up 
of 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
indivisible 
quantities 
because 
a 
division 
and 
a 
subdivision 
which 
can 
be 
carried 
on 
indefinitely 
presupposes 
that 
the 
parts 
are 
infinite 
in 
number, 
otherwise 
the 
subdivision 
would 
reach 
an 
end; 
and 
if 
the 
parts 
are 
infinite 
in 
number, 
we 
must 
conclude 
that 
they 
are 
not 
finite 
in 
size, 
because 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
finite 
quantities 
would 
give 
an 
infinite 
magnitude. 
And 
thus 
we 
have 
a 
continuous 
quantity 
built 
up 
of 
an 
infinite 
numberofindivisibles. 


Simp. 
But 
if 
we 
can 
carry 
on 
indefinitely 
the 
division 
into 
finite 
parts 
what 
necessityistherethenfortheintroductionofnon-finiteparts? 


Salv. 
The 
very 
fact 
that 
one 
is 
able 
to 
continue, 
without 
end, 
the 
division 
into 
finite 
parts 
[in 
parti 
quante] 
makes 
it 
necessary 
to 
regard 
the 
quantity 
as 
composed 
of 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
immeasurably 
small 
elements 
[di 
infiniti 
non 
quanti]. 
Now 
in 
order 
to 
settle 
this 
matter 
I 
shall 
ask 
you 
to 
tell 
me 
whether, 
in 
your 
opinion, 
a 
continuum 
is 
made 
up 
of 
a 
finite 
or 
of 
an 
infinite 
numberoffiniteparts[parti 
quante]. 


Simp. 
My 
answer 
is 
that 
their 
number 
is 
both 
infinite 
and 
finite; 
potentially 
infinite 
but 
actually 
finite 
[infinite, 
in 
potenza; 
e 
finite, 
in 
atto]; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
potentially 
infinite 
before 
division 
and 
actually 
finite 
after 
division; 
because 
parts 
cannot 
be 
said 
to 
exist 
in 
a 
body 
which 
is 
not 
yet 
divided 
or 
at 
least 
markedout; 
ifthisisnotdonewesaythattheyexistpotentially. 


Salv. 
So 
that 
a 
line 
which 
is, 
for 
instance, 
twenty 
spans 
long 
is 
not 
said 
to 
contain 
actually 
twenty 
lines 
each 
one 
span 
in 
length 
except 
after 
division 
into 
twenty 
equal 
parts; 
before 
division 
it 
is 
said 
to 
contain 
them 
only 
potentially. 
Suppose 
the 
facts 
are 
as 
you 
say; 
tell 
me 
then 
whether, 
when 
the 
division 
is 
once 
made, 
the 
size 
of 
the 
original 
quantity 
is 
thereby 
increased, 
diminished,orunaffected. 


Simp. 
Itneitherincreasesnordiminishes. 
Salv. 
That 
is 
my 
opinion 
also. 
Therefore 
the 
finite 
parts 
[parti 
quante] 
in 
a 
continuum, 
whether 
actually 
or 
potentially 
present, 
do 
not 
make 
the 
quantity 



either 
larger 
or 
smaller; 
but 
it 
is 
perfectly 
clear 
that, 
if 
the 
number 
of 
finite 
parts 
actually 
contained 
in 
the 
whole 
is 
infinite 
in 
number, 
they 
will 
make 
the 
magnitude 
infinite. 
Hence 
the 
number 
of 
finite 
parts, 
although 
existing 
only 
potentially, 
cannot 
be 
infinite 
unless 
the 
magnitude 
containing 
them 
be 
infinite; 
and 
conversely 
if 
the 
magnitude 
is 
finite 
it 
cannot 
contain 
an 
infinite 
numberoffinitepartseitheractually 
orpotentially. 


Sagr. 
How 
then 
is 
it 
possible 
to 
divide 
a 
continuum 
without 
limit 
into 
parts 
which 
arethemselvesalwayscapableofsubdivision? 


Salv. 
This 
distinction 
of 
yours 
between 
actual 
and 
potential 
appears 
to 
render 
easy 
by 
one 
method 
what 
would 
be 
impossible 
by 
another. 
But 
I 
shall 
endeavor 
to 
reconcile 
these 
matters 
in 
another 
way; 
and 
as 
to 
the 
query 
whether 
the 
finite 
parts 
of 
a 
limited 
continuum 
[continuo 
terminato] 
are 
finite 
or 
infinite 
in 
number 
I 
will, 
contrary 
to 
the 
opinion 
of 
Simplicio, 
answer 
that 
theyareneitherfinitenorinfinite. 


Simp. 
This 
answer 
would 
never 
have 
occurred 
to 
me 
since 
I 
did 
not 
think 
that 
there 
existed 
any 
intermediate 
step 
between 
the 
finite 
and 
the 
infinite, 
so 
that 
the 
classification 
or 
distinction 
which 
assumes 
that 
a 
thing 
must 
be 
either 
finiteorinfiniteis 
faultyanddefective. 


Salv. 
So 
it 
seems 
to 
me. 
And 
if 
we 
consider 
discrete 
quantities 
I 
think 
there 
is, 
between 
finite 
and 
infinite 
quantities, 
a 
third 
intermediate 
term 
which 
corresponds 
to 
every 
assigned 
number; 
so 
that 
if 
asked, 
as 
in 
the 
present 
case, 
whether 
the 
finiteparts 
ofa 
continuum 
arefiniteorinfinitein 
numberthe 
best 
reply 
is 
that 
they 
are 
neither 
finite 
nor 
infinite 
but 
correspond 
to 
every 
assigned 
number. 
In 
order 
that 
this 
may 
be 
possible, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
those 
parts 
should 
not 
be 
included 
within 
a 
limited 
number, 
for 
in 
that 
case 
they 
would 
not 
correspond 
to 
a 
number 
which 
is 
greater; 
nor 
can 
they 
be 
infinite 
in 
numbersince 
noassignednumber 
is 
infinite; 
and 
thus 
at 
thepleasureof 
the 
questioner 
we 
may, 
to 
any 
given 
line, 
assign 
a 
hundred 
finite 
parts, 
a 
thousand, 
a 
hundred 
thousand, 
or 
indeed 
any 
number 
we 
may 
please 
so 
long 
as 
it 
be 
not 
infinite. 
I 
grant, 
therefore, 
to 
the 
philosophers, 
that 
the 
continuum 
contains 
as 
many 
finite 
parts 
as 
they 
please 
and 
I 
concede 
also 
that 
it 
contains 
them, 
either 
actually 
or 
potentially, 
as 
they 
may 
like; 
but 
I 
must 
add 
that 
just 
as 
a 
line 
ten 
fathoms 
[canne] 
in 
length 
contains 
ten 
lines 
each 
of 
one 
fathom 



and 
forty 
lines 
each 
of 
one 
cubit 
[braccia] 
and 
eighty 
lines 
each 
of 
half 
a 
cubit, 
etc., 
so 
it 
contains 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
points; 
call 
them 
actual 
or 
potential, 
as 
you 
like, 
for 
as 
to 
this 
detail, 
Simplicio, 
I 
defer 
to 
your 
opinion 
and 
toyourjudgment. 


I 
cannot 
help 
admiring 
your 
discussion; 
but 
I 
fear 
that 
this 
parallelism 
between 
the 
points 
and 
the 
finite 
parts 
contained 
in 
a 
line 
will 
not 
prove 
satisfactory, 
and 
that 
you 
will 
not 
find 
it 
so 
easy 
to 
divide 
a 
given 
line 
into 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
points 
as 
the 
philosophers 
do 
to 
cut 
it 
into 
ten 
fathoms 
or 
forty 
cubits; 
not 
only 
so, 
but 
such 
a 
division 
is 
quite 
impossible 
to 
realize 
in 
practice, 
so 
that 
this 
will 
be 
one 
of 
those 
potentialities 
which 
cannot 
be 
reducedtoactuality. 


Salv. 
The 
fact 
that 
something 
can 
be 
done 
only 
with 
effort 
or 
diligence 
or 
with 
great 
expenditure 
of 
time 
does 
not 
render 
it 
impossible; 
for 
I 
think 
that 
you 
yourself 
could 
not 
easily 
divide 
a 
line 
into 
a 
thousand 
parts, 
and 
much 
less 
if 
the 
number 
of 
parts 
were 
937 
or 
any 
other 
large 
prime 
number. 
But 
if 
I 
were 
to 
accomplish 
this 
division 
which 
you 
deem 
impossible 
as 
readily 
as 
another 
person 
would 
divide 
the 
line 
into 
forty 
parts 
would 
you 
then 
be 
more 
willing,inour 
discussion,toconcedethepossibility 
ofsuchadivision? 


Simp. 
In 
general 
I 
enjoy 
greatly 
your 
method; 
and 
replying 
to 
your 
query, 
I 
answer 
that 
it 
would 
be 
more 
than 
sufficient 
if 
it 
prove 
not 
more 
difficult 
to 
resolvealineintopoints 
thantodivideit 
intoathousandparts. 


Salv. 
I 
will 
now 
say 
something 
which 
may 
perhaps 
astonish 
you; 
it 
refers 
to 
the 
possibility 
of 
dividing 
a 
line 
into 
its 
infinitely 
small 
elements 
by 
following 
the 
same 
order 
which 
one 
employs 
in 
dividing 
the 
same 
line 
into 
forty, 
sixty, 
or 
a 
hundred 
parts, 
that 
is, 
by 
dividing 
it 
into 
two, 
four, 
etc. 
He 
who 
thinks 
that, 
by 
following 
this 
method, 
he 
can 
reach 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
points 
is 
greatly 
mistaken; 
for 
if 
this 
process 
were 
followed 
to 
eternity 
there 
would 
stillremainfinitepartswhichwereundivided. 


Indeed 
by 
such 
a 
method 
one 
is 
very 
far 
from 
reaching 
the 
goal 
of 
indivisibility; 
on 
the 
contrary 
he 
recedes 
from 
it 
and 
while 
he 
thinks 
that, 
by 
continuing 
this 
division 
and 
by 
multiplying 
the 
multitude 
of 
parts, 
he 
will 
approach 
infinity, 
he 
is, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
getting 
farther 
and 
farther 
away 
from 
it. 
My 
reason 
is 
this. 
In 
the 
preceding 
discussion 
we 
concluded 
that, 
in 
an 
infinite 
number, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
the 
squares 
and 
cubes 
should 
be 
as 



numerous 
as 
the 
totality 
of 
the 
natural 
numbers 
[tutti 
i 
numeri], 
because 
both 
of 
these 
are 
as 
numerous 
as 
their 
roots 
which 
constitute 
the 
totality 
of 
the 
natural 
numbers. 
Next 
we 
saw 
that 
the 
larger 
the 
numbers 
taken 
the 
more 
sparsely 
distributed 
were 
the 
squares, 
and 
still 
more 
sparsely 
the 
cubes; 
therefore 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
larger 
the 
numbers 
to 
which 
we 
pass 
the 
farther 
we 
recede 
from 
the 
infinite 
number; 
hence 
it 
follows 
that, 
since 
this 
process 
carries 
us 
farther 
and 
farther 
from 
the 
end 
sought, 
if 
on 
turning 
back 
we 
shall 
find 
that 
any 
number 
can 
be 
said 
to 
be 
infinite, 
it 
must 
be 
unity. 
Here 
indeed 
are 
satisfied 
all 
those 
conditions 
which 
are 
requisite 
for 
an 
infinite 
number; 
I 
mean 
that 
unity 
contains 
in 
itself 
as 
many 
squares 
as 
there 
are 
cubes 
and 
naturalnumbers 
[tutti 
i 
numeri]. 


Simp. 
Idonotquitegraspthemeaningofthis. 


Salv. 
There 
is 
no 
difficulty 
in 
the 
matter 
because 
unity 
is 
at 
once 
a 
square, 
a 
cube, 
a 
square 
of 
a 
square 
and 
all 
the 
other 
powers 
[dignitā]; 
nor 
is 
there 
any 
essential 
peculiarity 
in 
squares 
or 
cubes 
which 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
unity; 
as, 
for 
example, 
the 
property 
of 
two 
square 
numbers 
that 
they 
have 
between 
them 
a 
mean 
proportional; 
take 
any 
square 
number 
you 
please 
as 
the 
first 
term 
and 
unity 
for 
the 
other, 
then 
you 
will 
always 
find 
a 
number 
which 
is 
a 
mean 
proportional. 
Consider 
the 
two 
square 
numbers, 
9 
and 
4; 
then 
3 
is 
the 
meanproportionalbetween9and1;while2isameanproportionalbetween4 
and 
1; 
between 
9 
and 
4 
we 
have 
6 
as 
a 
mean 
proportional. 
A 
property 
of 
cubes 
is 
that 
they 
must 
have 
between 
them 
two 
mean 
proportional 
numbers; 
take 
8 
and 
27; 
between 
them 
lie 
12 
and 
18; 
while 
between 
1 
and 
8 
we 
have 
2 
and 
4 
intervening; 
and 
between 
1 
and 
27 
there 
lie 
3 
and 
9. 
Therefore 
we 
conclude 
that 
unity 
is 
the 
only 
infinite 
number. 
These 
are 
some 
of 
the 
marvels 
which 
our 
imagination 
cannot 
grasp 
and 
which 
should 
warn 
us 
against 
the 
serious 
error 
of 
those 
who 
attempt 
to 
discuss 
the 
infinite 
by 
assigning 
to 
it 
the 
same 
properties 
which 
we 
employ 
for 
the 
finite, 
the 
natures 
ofthetwohavingnothingincommon. 


With 
regard 
to 
this 
subject 
I 
must 
tell 
you 
of 
a 
remarkable 
property 
which 
just 
now 
occurs 
to 
me 
and 
which 
will 
explain 
the 
vast 
alteration 
and 
change 
of 
character 
which 
a 
finite 
quantity 
would 
undergo 
in 
passing 
to 
infinity. 
Let 
us 
draw 
the 
straight 
line 
AB 
of 
arbitrary 
length 
and 
let 
the 
point 
C 
divide 
it 
into 
two 
unequal 
parts; 
then 
I 
say 
that, 
if 
pairs 
of 
lines 
be 
drawn, 
one 
from 
each 
of 
the 
terminal 
points 
A 
and 
B, 
and 
if 
the 
ratio 
between 
the 
lengths 
of 



these 
lines 
is 
the 
same 
as 
that 
between 
AC 
and 
CB, 
their 
points 
of 
intersection 
will 
all 
lie 
upon 
the 
circumference 
of 
one 
and 
the 
same 
circle. 
Thus, 
for 
example, 
AL 
and 
BL 
drawn 
from 
A 
and 
B, 
meeting 
at 
the 
point 
L, 
bearing 
to 
one 
another 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
AC 
to 
BC, 
and 
the 
pair 
AK 
and 
BK 
meeting 
at 
K 
also 
bearing 
to 
one 
another 
the 
same 
ratio, 
and 
likewise 
the 
pairs 
AI, 
BI, 
AH, 
BH, 
AG, 
BG, 
AF, 
BF, 
AE, 
BE, 
have 
their 
points 
of 
intersection 
L, 
K, 
I, 
H, 
G, 
F, 
E, 
all 
lying 
upon 
the 
circumference 
of 
one 
and 
the 
same 
circle. 
Accordingly 
if 
we 
imagine 
the 
point 
C 
to 
move 
continuously 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
that 
the 
lines 
drawn 
from 
it 
to 
the 
fixed 
terminal 
points, 
A 
and 
B, 
always 
maintain 
the 
same 
ratio 
between 
their 
lengths 
as 
exists 
between 
the 
original 
parts, 
AC 
and 
CB, 
then 
the 
point 
C 
will, 
as 
I 
shall 
presently 
prove, 
describe 
a 
circle. 
And 
the 
circle 
thus 
described 
will 
increase 
in 
size 
without 
limit 
as 
the 
point 
C 
approaches 
the 
middle 
point 
which 
we 
may 
call 
O; 
but 
it 
will 
diminish 
in 
size 
as 
C 
approaches 
the 
end 
B. 
So 
that 
the 
infinite 
number 
of 
points 
located 
in 
the 
line 
OB 
will, 
if 
the 
motion 
be 
as 
explainedabove,describecircles 
ofeverysize, 
some 
smaller 
thanthepupilof 
the 
eye 
of 
a 
flea, 
others 
larger 
than 
the 
celestial 
equator. 
Now 
if 
we 
move 
any 
of 
the 
points 
lying 
between 
the 
two 
ends 
O 
and 
B 
they 
will 
all 
describe 
circles, 
those 
nearest 
O, 
immense 
circles; 
but 
if 
we 
move 
the 
point 
O 
itself, 
and 
continue 
to 
move 
it 
according 
to 
the 
aforesaid 
law, 
namely, 
that 
the 
lines 
drawn 
from 
O 
to 
the 
terminal 
points, 
A 
and 
B, 
maintain 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
original 
lines 
AO 
and 
OB, 
what 
kind 
of 
a 
line 
will 
be 
produced? 
A 
circle 
will 
be 
drawn 
larger 
than 
the 
largest 
of 
the 
others, 
a 
circle 
which 
is 
therefore 
infinite. 
But 
from 
the 
point 
O 
a 
straight 
line 
will 
also 
be 
drawn 
perpendicular 
to 
BA 
and 
extending 
to 
infinity 
without 
ever 
turning, 
as 
did 
the 
others, 
to 
join 
its 
last 
end 
with 
its 
first; 
for 
the 
point 
C, 
with 
its 
limited 
motion, 
having 
described 
the 
upper 
semi-circle, 
CHE, 
proceeds 
to 
describe 
the 
lower 
semicircle 
EMC, 
thus 
returning 
to 
the 
starting 
point. 
But 
the 
point 
O 
having 
started 
to 
describe 
its 
circle, 
as 
did 
all 
the 
other 
points 
in 
the 
line 
AB, 
(for 
the 
points 
in 
the 
other 
portion 
OA 
describe 
their 
circles 
also, 
the 
largest 
being 
those 
nearest 
the 
point 
O) 
is 
unable 
to 
return 
to 
its 
starting 
point 
because 
the 
circle 
it 
describes, 
being 
the 
largest 
of 
all, 
is 
infinite; 
in 
fact, 
it 
describes 
an 
infinite 
straight 
line 
as 
circumference 
of 
its 
infinite 
circle. 
Think 
now 
what 
a 
difference 
there 
is 
between 
a 
finite 
and 
an 
infinite 
circle 
since 
the 
latter 
changes 
character 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
that 
it 
loses 
not 
only 
its 
existence 
but 
also 
its 
possibility 
of 
existence; 
indeed, 
we 
already 
clearly 
understand 
that 
there 
can 
be 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
an 
infinite 
circle; 
similarly 
there 
can 
be 
no 
infinite 



sphere, 
no 
infinite 
body, 
and 
no 
infinite 
surface 
of 
any 
shape. 
Now 
what 
shall 
wesayconcerningthismetamorphosis 
inthetransitionfromfinitetoinfinite? 
And 
why 
should 
we 
feel 
greater 
repugnance, 
seeing 
that, 
in 
our 
search 
after 
the 
infinite 
among 
numbers 
we 
found 
it 
in 
unity? 
Having 
broken 
up 
a 
solid 
into 
many 
parts, 
having 
reduced 
it 
to 
the 
finest 
of 
powder 
and 
having 
resolved 
it 
into 
its 
infinitely 
small 
indivisible 
atoms 
why 
may 
we 
not 
say 
that 
this 
solid 
has 
been 
reduced 
to 
a 
single 
continuum 
[un 
solo 
continuo] 
perhaps 
a 
fluid 
like 
water 
or 
mercury 
or 
even 
a 
liquified 
metal? 
And 
do 
we 
not 
see 
stones 
melt 
into 
glass 
and 
the 
glass 
itself 
under 
strong 
heat 
become 
more 
fluidthan 
water? 



Sagr. 
Are 
we 
then 
to 
believe 
that 
substances 
become 
fluid 
in 
virtue 
of 
being 
resolved

Salv. 
I 
am 
not 
able 
to 
find 
any 
better 
means 
of 
accounting 
for 
certain 
phenomena 
of 
which 
the 
following 
is 
one. 
When 
I 
take 
a 
hard 
substance 
such 
as 
stone 
or 
metal 
and 
when 
I 
reduce 
it 
by 
means 
of 
a 
hammer 
or 
fine 
file 
to 
the 
most 
minute 
and 
impalpable 
powder, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
its 
finest 
particles, 
although 
when 
taken 
one 
by 
one 
are, 
on 
account 
of 
their 
smallness, 
imperceptible 
to 
our 
sight 
and 
touch, 
are 
nevertheless 
finite 
in 
size, 
possess 
shape, 
and 
capability 
of 
being 
counted. 
It 
is 
also 
true 
that 
when 
once 
heaped 



up 
they 
remain 
in 
a 
heap; 
and 
if 
an 
excavation 
be 
made 
within 
limits 
the 
cavity 
will 
remain 
and 
the 
surrounding 
particles 
will 
not 
rush 
in 
to 
fill 
it; 
if 
shaken 
the 
particles 
come 
to 
rest 
immediately 
after 
the 
external 
disturbing 
agent 
is 
removed; 
the 
same 
effects 
are 
observed 
in 
all 
piles 
of 
larger 
and 
larger 
particles, 
of 
any 
shape, 
even 
if 
spherical, 
as 
is 
the 
case 
with 
piles 
of 
millet, 
wheat, 
lead 
shot, 
and 
every 
other 
material. 
But 
if 
we 
attempt 
to 
discover 
such 
properties 
in 
water 
we 
do 
not 
find 
them; 
for 
when 
once 
heaped 
up 
it 
immediately 
flattens 
out 
unless 
held 
up 
by 
some 
vessel 
or 
other 
external 
retaining 
body; 
when 
hollowed 
out 
it 
quickly 
rushes 
in 
to 
fill 
the 
cavity; 
and 
when 
disturbed 
it 
fluctuates 
for 
a 
long 
time 
and 
sends 
out 
its 
waves 
through 
greatdistances. 


Seeingthatwater 
haslessfirmness 
[consistenza]than 
thefinestof 
powder, 
in 
fact 
has 
no 
consistence 
whatever, 
we 
may, 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
very 
reasonably 
conclude 
that 
the 
smallest 
particles 
into 
which 
it 
can 
be 
resolved 
are 
quite 
different 
from 
finite 
and 
divisible 
particles; 
indeed 
the 
only 
difference 
I 
am 
able 
to 
discover 
is 
that 
the 
former 
are 
indivisible. 
The 
exquisite 
transparency 
of 
water 
also 
favors 
this 
view; 
for 
the 
most 
transparent 
crystal 
when 
broken 
and 
ground 
and 
reduced 
to 
powder 
loses 
its 
transparency; 
the 
finer 
the 
grinding 
the 
greater 
the 
loss; 
but 
in 
the 
case 
of 
water 
where 
the 
attrition 
is 
of 
the 
highest 
degree 
we 
have 
extreme 
transparency.

any

still 
remain

and 
do 
not

until 
the 
finest 
particles 
[gl’

of

the 
rays

the

dissolve

It 
is

Sagr. 
This 
phenomenon 
of 
light 
which 
you 
mention 
is 
one 
which 
I 
have 
many 
times 
remarked 
with 
astonishment. 
I 
have, 
for 
instance, 
seen 
lead 
melted 
instantly 
by 
means 
of 
a 
concave 
mirror 
only 
three 
hands 
[palmi] 
in 
diameter. 
Hence 
I 
think 
that 
if 
the 
mirror 
were 
very 
large, 
well-polished 
and 
of 
a 
parabolic 
figure, 
it 
would 
just 
as 
readily 
and 
quickly 
melt 
any 
other 
metal, 
seeing 
that 
the 
small 
mirror, 
which 
was 
not 
well 
polished 
and 
had 
only 
a 
spherical 
shape, 
was 
able 
so 
energetically 
to 
melt 
lead 
and 
burn 
every 
combustible 
substance. 
Such 
effects 
as 
these 
render 
credible 
to 
me 
the 
marvels 
accomplishedbythemirrorsof 
Archimedes. 



Salv. 
Speaking 
of 
the 
effects 
produced 
by 
the 
mirrors 
of 
Archimedes, 
it 
was 
his 
own 
books 
(which 
I 
had 
already 
read 
and 
studied 
with 
infinite 
astonishment) 
that 
rendered 
credible 
to 
me 
all 
the 
miracles 
described 
by 
various 
writers. 
And 
if 
any 
doubt 
had 
remained 
the 
book 
which 
Father 
BuonaventuraCavalieri12 
has 
recently 
published 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
burning 
glass 
[specchio

which 
I 
have 
read 
with

I 
also 
have 
seen 
this 
treatise 
and 
have 
read 
it 
with 
pleasure 
and 
astonishment; 
and 
knowing 
the 
author 
I 
was 
confirmed 
in 
the 
opinion 
which 
I 
had 
already 
formed 
of 
him 
that 
he 
was 
destined 
to 
become 
one 
of 
the 
leading 
mathematicians 
of 
our 
age. 
But 
now, 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
surprising 
effect 
of 
solar 
rays 
in 
melting 
metals, 
must 
we 
believe 
that 
such 
a 
furious 
action 
is 
devoidofmotionorthatitisaccompaniedby 
the 
mostrapidofmotions? 


Salv. 
We 
observe 
that 
other 
combustions 
and 
resolutions 
are 
accompanied 
by 
motion, 
and 
that, 
the 
most 
rapid; 
note 
the 
action 
of 
lightning 
and 
of 
powder 
as 
used 
in 
mines 
and 
petards; 
note 
also 
how 
the 
charcoal 
flame, 
mixed 
as 
it 
is 
with 
heavy 
andimpure 
vapors,increases 
its 
power 
to 
liquify 
metals 
whenever 
quickened 
by 
a 
pair 
of 
bellows. 
Hence 
I 
do 
not 
understand 
how 
the 
action 
of 
light, 
although 
very 
pure, 
can 
be 
devoid 
of 
motion 
and 
that 
of 
the 
swiftest 
type. 


Sagr. 
But 
of 
what 
kind 
and 
how 
great 
must 
we 
consider 
this 
speed 
of 
light 
to 
be? 
Is 
it 
instantaneous 
or 
momentary 
or 
does 
it 
like 
other 
motions 
require 
time? 
Canwenotdecidethisbyexperiment? 


Simp. 
Everyday 
experience 
shows 
that 
the 
propagation 
of 
light 
is 
instantaneous; 
for 
when 
we 
see 
a 
piece 
of 
artillery 
fired, 
at 
great 
distance, 
the 
flash 
reaches 
our 
eyes 
without 
lapse 
of 
time; 
but 
the 
sound 
reaches 
the 
ear 
onlyafteranoticeableinterval. 



Sagr. 
Well, 
Simplicio, 
the 
only 
thing 
I 
am 
able 
to 
infer 
from 
this 
familiar 
bit 
of 
experience 
is 
that 
sound, 
in 
reaching 
our 
ear, 
travels 
more 
slowly 
than 
light; 
it 
does 
not 
inform 
me 
whether 
the 
coming 
of 
the 
light 
is 
instantaneous 
or 
whether,although 
extremely 
rapid, 
it 
still 
occupies 
time. 
An 
observationof 
this 
kind 
tells 
us 
nothing 
more 
than 
one 
in 
which 
it 
is 
claimed 
that 
“As 
soon 
as 
the 
sun 
reaches 
the 
horizon 
its 
light 
reaches 
our 
eyes”; 
but 
who 
will 
assure 
me 
that 
these 
rays 
had 
not 
reached 
this 
limit 
earlier 
than 
they 
reached 
our 
vision? 


Salv. 
The 
small 
conclusiveness 
of 
these 
and 
other 
similar 
observations 
once 
led 
me 
to 
devise 
a 
method 
by 
which 
one 
might 
accurately 
ascertain 
whether 
illumination, 
i. 
e., 
the 
propagation 
of 
light, 
is 
really 
instantaneous. 
The 
fact 
that 
the 
speed 
of 
sound 
is 
as 
high 
as 
it 
is, 
assures 
us 
that 
the 
motion 
of 
light 
cannotfailtobe 
extraordinarilyswift. 
TheexperimentwhichIdevisedwasas 
follows: 


Let 
each 
of 
two 
persons 
take 
a 
light 
contained 
in 
a 
lantern, 
or 
other 
receptacle, 
such 
that 
by 
the 
interposition 
of 
the 
hand, 
the 
one 
can 
shut 
off 
or 
admit 
the 
light 
to 
the 
vision 
of 
the 
other. 
Next 
let 
them 
stand 
opposite 
each 
other 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
a 
few 
cubits 
and 
practice 
until 
they 
acquire 
such 
skill 
in 
uncovering 
and 
occulting 
their 
lights 
that 
the 
instant 
one 
sees 
the 
light 
of 
his 
companion 
he 
will 
uncover 
his 
own. 
After 
a 
few 
trials 
the 
response 
will 
be 
so 
prompt 
that 
without 
sensible 
error 
[svario] 
the 
uncovering 
of 
one 
light 
is 
immediately 
followed 
by 
the 
uncovering 
of 
the 
other, 
so 
that 
as 
soon 
as 
one 
exposes 
his 
light 
he 
will 
instantly 
see 
that 
of 
the 
other. 
Having 
acquired 
skill 
at 
this 
short 
distance 
let 
the 
two 
experimenters, 
equipped 
as 
before, 
take 
up 
positions 
separated 
by 
a 
distance 
of 
two 
or 
three 
miles 
and 
let 
them 
perform 
the 
same 
experiment 
at 
night, 
noting 
carefully 
whether 
the 
exposures 
and 
occultations 
occur 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
at 
short 
distances; 
if 
they 
do, 
we 
may 
safely 
conclude 
that 
the 
propagation 
of 
light 
is 
instantaneous; 
but 
if 
time 
is 
required 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
three 
miles 
which, 
considering 
the 
going 
of 
one 
light 
and 
the 
coming 
of 
the 
other, 
really 
amounts 
to 
six, 
then 
the 
delay 
ought 
to 
be 
easily 
observable. 
If 
the 
experiment 
is 
to 
be 
made 
at 
still 
greater 
distances, 
say 
eight 
or 
ten 
miles, 
telescopes 
may 
be 
employed, 
each 
observer 
adjusting 
one 
for 
himself 
at 
the 
place 
where 
he 
is 
to 
make 
the 
experiment 
at 
night; 
then 
although 
the 
lights 
are 
not 
large 
and 
are 
therefore 
invisible 
to 
the 
naked 
eye 
at 
so 
great 
a 
distance, 
they 
can 
readily 
be 
covered 
and 
uncovered 



since 
by 
aid 
of 
the 
telescopes, 
once 
adjusted 
and 
fixed, 
they 
will 
become 
easily 
visible. 


Sagr. 
This 
experiment 
strikes 
me 
as 
a 
clever 
and 
reliable 
invention. 
But 
tell 
uswhat 
youconclude 
fromthe 
results. 


Salv. 
In 
fact 
I 
have 
tried 
the 
experiment 
only 
at 
a 
short 
distance, 
less 
than 
a 
mile, 
from 
which 
I 
have 
not 
been 
able 
to 
ascertain 
with 
certainty 
whether 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
opposite 
light 
was 
instantaneous 
or 
not; 
but 
if 
not 
instantaneous 
it 
is 
extraordinarily 
rapid 
— 
I 
should 
call 
it 
momentary; 
and 
for 
the 
present 
I 
should 
compare 
it 
to 
motion 
which 
we 
see 
in 
the 
lightning 
flash 
between 
clouds 
eight 
or 
ten 
miles 
distant 
from 
us. 
We 
see 
the 
beginning 
of 
this 
light 
— 
I 
might 
say 
its 
head 
and 
source 
— 
located 
at 
a 
particular 
place 
among 
the 
clouds; 
but 
it 
immediately 
spreads 
to 
the 
surrounding 
ones, 
which 
seems 
to 
be 
an 
argument 
that 
at 
least 
some 
time 
is 
required 
for 
propagation; 
for 
if 
the 
illumination 
were 
instantaneous 
and 
not 
gradual, 
we 
should 
not 
be 
able 
to 
distinguish 
its 
origin 
— 
its 
center, 
so 
to 
speak 
— 
from 
its 
outlying 
portions. 
What 
a 
sea 
we 
are 
gradually 
slipping 
into 
without 
knowing 
it! 
With 
vacua 
and 
infinities 
and 
indivisibles 
and 
instantaneous 
motions, 
shall 
we 
ever 
beable,evenbymeans 
ofathousanddiscussions,to 
reachdryland? 
Sagr. 
Really 
these 
matters 
lie 
far 
beyond 
our 
grasp. 
Just 
think; 
when 
we 
seek 
the 
infinite 
among 
numbers 
we 
find 
it 
in 
unity; 
that 
which 
is 
ever 
divisible 
is 
derived 
from 
indivisibles; 
the 
vacuum 
is 
found 
inseparably 
connected 
with 
the 
plenum; 
indeed 
the 
views 
commonly 
held 
concerning 
the 
nature 
of 
these 
matters 
are 
so 
reversed 
that 
even 
the 
circumference 
of 
a 
circle 
turns 
out 
to 
be 
an 
infinite 
straight 
line, 
a 
fact 
which, 
if 
my 
memory 
serves 
me 
correctly, 
you, 
Salviati, 
were 
intending 
to 
demonstrate 
geometrically. 
Please 
therefore 
proceedwithoutfurtherdigression. 


Salv. 
I 
am 
at 
your 
service; 
but 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
greater 
clearness 
let 
me 
first 
demonstratethefollowingproblem: 


Given 
a 
straight 
line 
divided 
into 
unequal 
parts 
which 
bear 
to 
each 
other 
any 
ratio 
whatever, 
to 
describe 
a 
circle 
such 
that 
two 
straight 
lines 
drawn 
from 
the 
ends 
of 
the 
given 
line 
to 
any 
point 
on 
the 
circumference 
will 
bear 
to 
each 
other 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
two 
parts 
of 
the 
given 
line, 
thus 
making 
those 
lineswhichare 
drawnfromthesameterminal 
pointshomologous. 



Let 
ABrepresent 
the 
given 
straightlinedivided 
into 
anytwo 
unequal 
parts 
by 
the 
point 
C; 
the 
problem 
is 
to 
describe 
a 
circle 
such 
that 
two 
straight 
lines 
drawn 
from 
the 
terminal 
points, 
A 
and 
B, 
to 
any 
point 
on 
the 
circumference 
will 
bear 
to 
each 
other 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
part 
AC 
bears 
to 
BC, 
so 
that 
lines 
drawn 
from 
the 
same 
terminal 
points 
are 
homologous. 
About 
C 
as 
center 
describe 
a 
circle 
having 
the 
shorter 
part 
CB 
of 
the 
given 
line, 
as 
radius. 
Through 
A 
draw 
a 
straight 
line 
AD 
which 
shall 
be 
tangent 
to 
the 
circle 
at 
D 
and 
indefinitely 
prolonged 
toward 
E. 
Draw 
the 
radius 
CD 
which 
will 
be 
perpendicular 
to 
AE. 
At 
B 
erect 
a 
perpendicular 
to 
AB; 
this 
perpendicular 
will 
intersect 
AE 
at 
some 
point 
since 
the 
angle 
at 
A 
is 
acute; 
call 
this 
point 
of 
intersection 
E, 
and 
from 
it 
draw 
a 
perpendicular 
to 
AE 
which 
will 
intersect 
AB 
prolonged 
in 
F. 
Now 
I 
say 
the 
two 
straight 
lines 
FE 
and 
FC 
are 
equal. 
For 
if 
we 
join 
E 
and 
C, 
we 
shall 
have 
two 
triangles, 
DEC 
and 
BEC, 
in 
which 
the 
two 
sides 
of 
the 
one, 
DE 
and 
EC, 
are 
equal 
to 
the 
two 
sides 
of 
the 
other, 
BE 
and 
EC, 
both 
DE 
and 
EB 
being 
tangents 
to 
the 
circle 
DB 
while 
the 
bases 
DC 
and 
CB 
are 
likewise 
equal; 
hence 
the 
two 
angles, 
DEC 
and 
BEC, 
will 
be 
equal. 
Now 
since 
the 
angle 
BCE 
differs 
from 
a 
right 
angle 
by 
the 
angle 
CEB, 
and 
the 
angle 
CEF 
also 
differs 
from 
a 
right 
angle 
by 
the 
angle 
CED, 
and 
since 
these 
differences 
are 
equal, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
angle 
FCE 
is 
equal 
to 
CEF;consequently 
thesides 
FE 
andFCareequal. 
If 
we 
describeacirclewith 
F 
as 
center 
and 
FE 
as 
radius 
it 
will 
pass 
through 
the 
point 
C; 
let 
CEG 
be 
such 
a 
circle. 
This 
is 
the 
circle 
sought, 
for 
if 
we 
draw 
lines 
from 
the 
terminal 
points 
A 
and 
B 
to 
any 
point 
on 
its 
circumference 
they 
will 
bear 
to 
each 
other 
thesameratioasthetwoportions 
AC 
andBCwhich 
meetatthepointC. 
This 
is 
manifest 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
two 
lines 
AE 
and 
BE, 
meeting 
at 
the 
point 
E, 
because 
the 
angle 
E 
of 
the 
triangle 
AEB 
is 
bisected 
by 
the 
line 
CE, 
and 
therefore 
AC:CB=AE:BE. 
The 
same 
may 
be 
proved 
of 
the 
two 
lines 
AG 
and 
BG 
terminating 
in 
the 
point 
G. 
For 
since 
the 
triangles 
AFE 
and 
EFB 
are 
similar, 
we 
have 
AF:FE=EF:FB, 
or 
AF:FC=CF:FB, 
and 
dividendo 
AC:CF=CB:BF, 
or 
AC:FG=CB:BF; 
also 
componendo 
we 
have 
both 
AB:BG=CB:BFandAG:GB=CF:FB=AE:EB=AC:BC. 


q. 
e. 
d. 

Besides, 
I 
may 
add, 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
lines 
which 
maintain 
this 
same 
ratio 
and 
which 
are 
drawn 
from 
the 
terminal 
points, 
A 
and 
B, 
to 
meet 
at 
any 
point 
either 
inside 
or 
outside 
the 
circle, 
CEG. 
For 
suppose 
this 
were 
possible; 
let 
AL 
and 
BL 
be 
two 
such 
lines 
intersecting 
at 
the 
point 
L 
outside 
the 
circle: 
prolong 
LB 
till 
it 
meets 
the 
circumference 
at 
M 
and 
join 
MF. 
If 
AL:BL=AC:BC=MF:FB, 
then 
we 
shall 
have 
two 
triangles 
ALB 
and 
MFB 
which 
have 
the 
sides 
about 
the 
two 
angles 
proportional, 
the 
angles 
at 
the 
vertex, 
B, 
equal, 
and 
the 
two 
remaining 
angles, 
FMB 
and 
LAB, 
less 
than 
right 
angles 
(because 
the 
right 
angle 
at 
M 
has 
for 
its 
base 
the 
entire 
diameter 
CG 
and 
not 
merely 
a 
part 
BF: 
and 
the 
other 
angle 
at 
the 
point 
A 
is 
acute 
because 
the 
line 
AL, 
the 
homologue 
of 
AC, 
is 
greater 
than 
BL, 
the 
homologue 
of 
BC). 
From 
this 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
triangles 
ABL 
and 
MBF 
are 
similar 
and 
therefore 
AB:BL=MB:BF, 
making 
the 
rectangle 
AB.BF=MB.BL; 
but 
it 
has 
been 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
rectangle 
AB.BF 
is 
equal 
to 
CB.BG; 
whence 
it 
would 
follow 
that 
the 
rectangle 
MB.BL 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
rectangle 
CB.BG 
which 
is 
impossible; 
therefore 
the 
intersection 
cannot 
fall 
outside 
the 



circle. 
And 
in 
like 
manner 
we 
can 
show 
that 
it 
cannot 
fall 
inside; 
hence 
all 
theseintersections 
fallon 
thecircumference. 


But 
now 
it 
is 
time 
for 
us 
to 
go 
back 
and 
grant 
the 
request 
of 
Simplicio 
by 
showing 
him 
that 
it 
is 
not 
only 
not 
impossible 
to 
resolve 
a 
line 
into 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
points 
but 
that 
this 
is 
quite 
as 
easy 
as 
to 
divide 
it 
into 
its 
finite 
parts. 
This 
I 
will 
do 
under 
the 
following 
condition 
which 
I 
am 
sure, 
Simplicio, 
you 
will 
not 
deny 
me, 
namely, 
that 
you 
will 
not 
require 
me 
to 
separate 
the 
points, 
one 
from 
the 
other, 
and 
show 
them 
to 
you, 
one 
by 
one, 
on 
this 
paper; 
for 
I 
should 
be 
content 
that 
you, 
without 
separating 
the 
four 
or 
six 
parts 
of 
a 
line 
from 
one 
another, 
should 
show 
me 
the 
marked 
divisions 
or 
at 
most 
that 
you 
should 
fold 
them 
at 
angles 
forming 
a 
square 
or 
a 
hexagon: 
for, 
then, 
I 
am 
certain 
you 
would 
consider 
the 
division 
distinctly 
and 
actually 
accomplished. 


Simp. 
Icertainlyshould. 


Salv. 
If 
now 
the 
change 
which 
takes 
place 
when 
you 
bend 
a 
line 
at 
angles 
so 
as 
to 
form 
now 
a 
square, 
now 
an 
octagon, 
now 
a 
polygon 
of 
forty, 
a 
hundred 
or 
a 
thousand 
angles, 
is 
sufficient 
to 
bring 
into 
actuality 
the 
four, 
eight, 
forty, 
hundred, 
and 
thousand 
parts 
which, 
according 
to 
you, 
existed 
at 
first 
only 
potentially 
in 
the 
straight 
line, 
may 
I 
not 
say, 
with 
equal 
right, 
that, 
when 
I 
have 
bent 
the 
straight 
line 
into 
a 
polygon 
having 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
sides, 


i. 
e., 
into 
a 
circle, 
I 
have 
reduced 
to 
actuality 
that 
infinite 
number 
of 
parts 
which 
you 
claimed, 
while 
it 
was 
straight, 
were 
contained 
in 
it 
only 
potentially? 
Nor 
can 
one 
deny 
that 
the 
division 
into 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
points 
is 
just 
as 
truly 
accomplished 
as 
the 
one 
into 
four 
parts 
when 
the 
square 
is 
formed 
or 
into 
a 
thousand 
parts 
when 
the 
millagon 
is 
formed; 
for 
in 
such 
a 
division 
the 
same 
conditions 
are 
satisfied 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
polygon 
of 
a 
thousand 
or 
a 
hundred 
thousand 
sides. 
Such 
a 
polygon 
laid 
upon 
a 
straight 
line 
touches 
it 
with 
one 
of 
its 
sides, 
i. 
e., 
with 
one 
of 
its 
hundred 
thousand 
parts; 
while 
the 
circle 
which 
is 
a 
polygon 
of 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
sides 
touches 
the 
same 
straight 
line 
with 
one 
of 
its 
sides 
which 
is 
a 
single 
point 
different 
from 
all 
its 
neighbors 
and 
therefore 
separate 
and 
distinct 
in 
no 
less 
degree 
than 
is 
one 
side 
of 
a 
polygon 
from 
the 
other 
sides. 
And 
just 
as 
a 
polygon, 
when 
rolled 
along 
a 
plane, 
marks 
out 
upon 
this 
plane, 
by 
the 
successive 
contacts 
of 
its 
sides, 
a 
straight 
line 
equal 
to 
its 
perimeter, 
so 
the 
circle 
rolled 
upon 
such 
a 
plane 
also 
traces 
by 
its 
infinite 
succession 
of 

contacts 
a 
straight 
line 
equal 
in 
length 
to 
its 
own 
circumference. 
I 
am 
willing, 
Simplicio, 
at 
the 
outset, 
to 
grant 
to 
the 
Peripatetics 
the 
truth 
of 
their 
opinion 
that 
a 
continuous 
quantity 
[il 
continuo] 
is 
divisible 
only 
into 
parts 
which 
are 
still 
further 
divisible 
so 
that 
however 
far 
the 
division 
and 
subdivision 
be 
continued 
no 
end 
will 
be 
reached; 
but 
I 
am 
not 
so 
certain 
that 
they 
will 
concede 
to 
me 
that 
none 
of 
these 
divisions 
of 
theirs 
can 
be 
a 
final 
one, 
as 
is 
surely 
the 
fact,becausetherealwaysremains 
“another”;thefinal 
andultimate 
division 
is 
rather 
one 
which 
resolves 
a 
continuous 
quantity 
into 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
indivisible 
quantities, 
a 
result 
which 
I 
grant 
can 
never 
be 
reached 
by 
successive 
division 
into 
an 
ever-increasing 
number 
of 
parts. 
But 
if 
they 
employ 
the 
method 
which 
I 
propose 
for 
separating 
and 
resolving 
the 
whole 
of 
infinity[tutta 
la 
infinità], 
at 
a 
singlestroke 
(an 
artifice 
which 
surely 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
denied 
me), 
I 
think 
that 
they 
would 
be 
contented 
to 
admit 
that 
a 
continuous 
quantity 
is 
built 
up 
out 
of 
absolutely 
indivisible 
atoms, 
especially 
since 
this 
method, 
perhaps 
better 
than 
any 
other, 
enables 
us 
to 
avoid 
many 
intricate 
labyrinths, 
such 
as 
cohesion 
in 
solids, 
already 
mentioned, 
and 
the 
question 
of 
expansion 
and 
contraction, 
without 
forcing 
upon 
us 
the 
objectionable 
admission 
of 
empty 
spaces 
[in 
solids] 
which 
carries 
with 
it 
the 
penetrability 
ofbodies. 
Bothoftheseobjections,itappearstome,areavoided 
if 
weacceptthe 
above-mentionedview 
ofindivisible 
constituents. 


Simp. 
I 
hardly 
know 
what 
the 
Peripatetics 
would 
say 
since 
the 
views 
advanced 
by 
you 
would 
strike 
them 
as 
mostly 
new, 
and 
as 
such 
we 
must 
consider 
them. 
It 
is 
however 
not 
unlikely 
that 
they 
would 
find 
answers 
and 
solutions 
for 
these 
problems 
which 
I, 
for 
want 
of 
time 
and 
critical 
ability, 
am 
at 
present 
unable 
to 
solve. 
Leaving 
this 
to 
one 
side 
for 
the 
moment, 
I 
should 
like 
to 
hear 
how 
the 
introduction 
of 
these 
indivisible 
quantities 
helps 
us 
to 
understand 
contraction 
and 
expansion 
avoiding 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
vacuum 
and 
the 
penetrabilityof 
bodies. 


Sagr. 
I 
also 
shall 
listen 
with 
keen 
interest 
to 
this 
same 
matter 
which 
is 
far 
from 
clear 
in 
my 
mind; 
provided 
I 
am 
allowed 
to 
hear 
what, 
a 
moment 
ago, 
Simplicio 
suggested 
we 
omit, 
namely, 
the 
reasons 
which 
Aristotle 
offers 
against 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
vacuum 
and 
the 
arguments 
which 
you 
must 
advance 
inrebuttal. 



Salv. 
I 
will 
do 
both. 
And 
first, 
just 
as, 
for 
the 
production 
of 
expansion, 
we 
employ 
the 
line 
described 
by 
the 
small 
circle 
during 
one 
rotation 
of 
the 
large 
one 
— 
a 
line 
greater 
than 
the 
circumference 
of 
the 
small 
circle 
— 
so, 
in 
order 
to 
explain 
contraction, 
we 
point 
out 
that, 
during 
each 
rotation 
of 
the 
smaller 
circle, 
the 
larger 
one 
describes 
a 
straight 
line 
which 
is 
shorter 
than 
its 
circumference. 


For 
the 
better 
understanding 
of 
this 
we 
proceed 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
what 
happens 
in 
the 
case 
of 
polygons. 
Employing 
a 
figure 
similar 
to 
the 
earlier 
one, 
construct 
the 
two 
hexagons, 
ABC 
and 
HIK, 
about 
the 
common 
center 
L, 
and 
let 
them 
roll 
along 
the 
parallel 
lines 
HOM 
and 
ABc. 
Now 
holding 
the 
vertex 
I 
fixed, 
allow 
the 
smaller 
polygon 
to 
rotate 
until 
the 
side 
IK 
lies 
upon 
the 
parallel, 
during 
which 
motion 
the 
point 
K 
will 
describe 
the 
arc 
KM, 
and 
the 
side 
KI 
will 
coincide 
with 
IM. 
Let 
us 
see 
what, 
in 
the 
meantime, 
the 
side 
CB 
of 
the 
larger 
polygon 
has 
been 
doing. 
Since 
the 
rotation 
is 
about 
the 
point 
I, 
the 
terminal 
point 
B, 
of 
the 
line 
IB, 
moving 
backwards, 
will 
describe 
the 
arc 
Bb 
underneath 
the 
parallel 
cA 
so 
that 
when 
the 
side 
KI 
coincides 
with 
the 
line 
MI, 
the 
side 
BC 
will 
coincide 
with 
bc, 
having 
advanced 
only 
through 
the 
distance 
Bc, 
but 
having 
retreated 
through 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
line 
BA 
which 
subtends 
the 
arc 
Bb. 
If 
we 
allow 
the 
rotation 
of 
the 
smaller 
polygon 
to 
go 
on 
it 
will 
traverse 
and 
describe 
along 
its 
parallel 
a 
line 
equal 
to 
its 
perimeter; 
while 
the 
larger 
one 
will 
traverse 
and 
describe 
a 
line 
less 
than 
its 
perimeter 
by 
as 
many 
times 
the 
length 
bB 
as 
there 
are 
sides 
less 
one; 
this 
line 
is 
approximately 
equal 
to 
that 
described 
by 
the 
smaller 
polygon 
exceeding 
it 
only 
by 
the 
distance 
bB. 
Here 
now 
we 
see, 
without 
any 
difficulty, 
why 
the 
larger 
polygon, 
when 
carried 
by 
the 
smaller, 
does 
not 
measure 
off 
with 
its 
sides 
a 
line 
longer 
than 
that 
traversed 
by 
the 
smaller 
one; 
this 
is 
because 
a 
portion 
of 
each 
side 
is 
superposed 
upon 
its 
immediately 
precedingneighbor. 


Let 
us 
next 
consider 
two 
circles, 
having 
a 
common 
center 
at 
A, 
and 
lying 
upon 
their 
respective 
parallels, 
the 
smaller 
being 
tangent 
to 
its 
parallel 
at 
the 
point 
B; 
the 
larger, 
at 
the 
point 
C. 
Here 
when 
the 
small 
circle 
commences 
to 
roll 
the 
point 
B 
does 
not 
remain 
at 
rest 
for 
a 
while 
so 
as 
to 
allow 
BC 
to 
move 
backward 
and 
carry 
with 
it 
the 
point 
C, 
as 
happened 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
polygons, 
where 
the 
point 
I 
remained 
fixed 
until 
the 
side 
KI 
coincided 
with 
MI 
and 
the 
line 
IB 
carried 
the 
terminal 
point 
B 
backward 
as 
far 
as 
b, 
so 
that 
the 
side 
BC 
fell 
upon 
bc, 
thus 
superposing 
upon 
the 
line 
BA, 
the 
portion 
Bb, 
and 
advancing 
by 
an 
amount 
Bc, 
equal 
to 
MI, 
that 
is, 
to 
one 
side 
of 
the 



smaller 
polygon. 
On 
account 
of 
these 
superpositions, 
which 
are 
the 
excesses 
of 
the 
sides 
of 
the 
larger 
over 
the 
smaller 
polygon, 
each 
net 
advance 
is 
equal 
to 
one 
side 
of 
the 
smaller 
polygon 
and, 
during 
one 
complete 
rotation, 
these 
amount 
to 
a 
straight 
line 
equal 
in 
length 
to 
the 
perimeter 
of 
the 
smaller 
polygon. 



But 
now 
reasoning 
in 
the 
same 
way 
concerning 
the 
circles, 
we 
must 
observe 
that 
whereas 
the 
number 
of 
sides 
in 
any 
polygon 
is 
comprised 
within 
a 
certain 
limit, 
the 
number 
of 
sides 
in 
a 
circle 
is 
infinite; 
the 
former 
are 
finite 
and 
divisible; 
the 
latter 
infinite 
and 
indivisible. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
the 
polygon, 
the 
vertices 
remain 
at 
rest 
during 
an 
interval 
of 
time 
which 
bears 
to 
the 
period 
of 
one 
complete 
rotation 
the 
same 
ratio 
which 
one 
side 
bears 
to 
the 
perimeter; 
likewise, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
circles, 
the 
delay 
of 
each 
of 
the 
infinite 
number 
of 
vertices 
is 
merely 
instantaneous, 
because 
an 
instant 
is 
such 
a 
fraction 
of 
a 
finite 
interval 
as 
a 
point 
is 
of 
a 
line 
which 
contains 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 



points. 
The 
retrogression 
of 
the 
sides 
of 
the 
larger 
polygon 
is 
not 
equal 
to 
the 
length 
of 
one 
of 
its 
sides 
but 
merely 
to 
the 
excess 
of 
such 
a 
side 
over 
one 
side 
of 
the 
smaller 
polygon, 
the 
net 
advance 
being 
equal 
to 
this 
smaller 
side; 
but 
in 
the 
circle, 
the 
point 
or 
side 
C, 
during 
the 
instantaneous 
rest 
of 
B, 
recedes 
by 
an 
amount 
equal 
to 
its 
excess 
over 
the 
side 
B, 
making 
a 
net 
progress 
equal 
to 
B 
itself. 
In 
short 
the 
infinite 
number 
of 
indivisible 
sides 
of 
the 
greater 
circle 
withtheirinfinitenumberofindivisibleretrogressions, 
madeduringthe 
infinite 
number 
of 
instantaneous 
delays 
of 
the 
infinite 
number 
of 
vertices 
of 
the 
smaller 
circle, 
together 
with 
the 
infinite 
number 
of 
progressions, 
equal 
to 
the 
infinite 
number 
of 
sides 
in 
the 
smaller 
circle 
— 
all 
these, 
I 
say, 
add 
up 
to 
a 
line 
equal 
to 
that 
described 
by 
the 
smaller 
circle, 
a 
line 
which 
contains 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
infinitely 
small 
superpositions, 
thus 
bringing 
about 
a 
thickening 
orcontractionwithoutanyoverlappingorinterpenetration 
offinite 
parts. 
This 
result 
could 
not 
be 
obtained 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
line 
divided 
into 
finite 
parts 
such 
as 
is 
the 
perimeter 
of 
any 
polygon, 
which 
when 
laid 
out 
in 
a 
straight 
line 
cannot 
be 
shortened 
except 
by 
the 
overlapping 
and 
interpenetration 
of 
its 
sides. 
This 
contraction 
of 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
infinitely 
small 
parts 
without 
the 
interpenetration 
or 
overlapping 
of 
finite 
parts 
and 
the 
previously 
mentioned 
[p. 
70, 
Nat. 
Ed.] 
expansion 
of 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
indivisible 
parts 
by 
the 
interposition 
of 
indivisible 
vacua 
is, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
the 
most 
that 
can 
be 
said 
concerning 
the 
contraction 
and 
rarefaction 
of 
bodies, 
unless 
we 
give 
up 
the 
impenetrability 
of 
matter 
and 
introduce 
empty 
spaces 
of 
finite 
size. 
If 
you 
find 
anything 
here 
that 
you 
consider 
worth 
while, 
pray 
use 
it; 
if 
not 
regard 
it, 
together 
with 
my 
remarks, 
as 
idle 
talk; 
but 
this 
remember, 
we 
aredealingwith 
the 
infinite 
andtheindivisible. 


Sagr. 
I 
frankly 
confess 
that 
your 
idea 
is 
subtle 
and 
that 
it 
impresses 
me 
as 
new 
and 
strange; 
but 
whether, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
nature 
actually 
behaves 
according 
to 
such 
a 
law 
I 
am 
unable 
to 
determine; 
however, 
until 
I 
find 
a 
more 
satisfactory 
explanation 
I 
shall 
hold 
fast 
to 
this 
one. 
Perhaps 
Simplicio 
can 
tell 
us 
something 
which 
I 
have 
not 
yet 
heard, 
namely, 
how 
to 
explain 
the 
explanation 
which 
the 
philosophers 
have 
given 
of 
this 
abstruse 
matter; 
for, 
indeed, 
all 
that 
I

Simp. 
I 
am 
all 
at 
sea 
and 
find 
difficulties 
in 
following 
either 
path, 
especially 
this 
new 
one; 
because 
according 
to 
this 
theory 
an 
ounce 
of 
gold 
might 
be 
rarefied 
and 
expanded 
until 
its 
size 
would 
exceed 
that 
of 
the 
earth, 
while 
the 
earth, 
in 
turn, 
might 
be 
condensed 
and 
reduced 
until 
it 
would 
become 
smaller 
than 
a 
walnut, 
something 
which 
I 
do 
not 
believe; 
nor 
do 
I 
believe 
that 
you 
believe 
it. 
The 
arguments 
and 
demonstrations 
which 
you 
have 
advanced 
are 
mathematical, 
abstract, 
and 
far 
removed 
from 
concrete 
matter; 
and 
I 
do 
not 
believe 
that 
when 
applied 
to 
the 
physical 
and 
natural 
world 
these 
laws 
will 
hold. 


Salv. 
I 
am 
not 
able 
to 
render 
the 
invisible 
visible, 
nor 
do 
I 
think 
that 
you 
will 
ask 
this. 
But 
now 
that 
you 
mention 
gold, 
do 
not 
our 
senses 
tell 
us 
that 
that 
metal 
can 
be 
immensely 
expanded? 
I 
do 
not 
know 
whether 
you 
have 
observed 
the 
method 
employed 
by 
those 
who 
are 
skilled 
in 
drawing 
gold 
wire, 
of 
which 
really 
only 
the 
surface 
is 
gold, 
the 
inside 
material 
being 
silver. 
The 
way 
they 
draw 
it 
is 
as 
follows: 
they 
take 
a 
cylinder 
or, 
if 
you 
please, 
a 
rod 
of 
silver, 
about 
half 
a 
cubit 
long 
and 
three 
or 
four 
times 
as 
wide 
as 
one’s 
thumb; 
this 
rod 
they 
cover 
with 
gold-leaf 
which 
is 
so 
thin 
that 
it 
almost 
floats 
in 
air, 
putting 
on 
not 
more 
than 
eight 
or 
ten 
thicknesses. 
Once 
gilded 
they 
begin 
to 
pull 
it, 
with 
great 
force, 
through 
the 
holes 
of 
a 
draw-plate; 
again 
and 
again 
it 
is 
made 
to 
pass 
through 
smaller 
and 
smaller 
holes, 
until, 
after 
very 
many 
passages, 
it 
is 
reduced 
to 
the 
fineness 
of 
a 
lady’s 
hair, 
or 
perhaps 
even 
finer; 
yet 
the 
surface 
remains 
gilded. 
Imagine 
now 
how 
the 
substance 
of 
this 
goldhasbeenexpanded 
andto 
whatfineness 
ithasbeenreduced. 


Simp. 
I 
do 
not 
see 
that 
this 
process 
would 
produce, 
as 
a 
consequence, 
that 
marvellous 
thinning 
of 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
gold 
which 
you 
suggest: 
first, 
because 
the 
original 
gilding 
consisting 
of 
ten 
layers 
of 
gold-leaf 
has 
a 
sensible 
thickness; 
secondly, 
because 
in 
drawing 
out 
the 
silver 
it 
grows 
in 
length 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
diminishes 
proportionally 
in 
thickness; 
and, 
since 
one 
dimension 
thus 
compensates 
the 
other, 
the 
area 
will 
not 
be 
so 
increased 
as 
to 
make 
it 
necessary 
during 
the 
process 
of 
gilding 
to 
reduce 
the 
thinness 
of 
thegoldbeyond 
thatoftheoriginalleaves. 


Salv. 
You 
are 
greatly 
mistaken, 
Simplicio, 
because 
the 
surface 
increases 
directly 
as 
the 
square 
root 
of 
the 
length, 
a 
fact 
which 
I 
can 
demonstrate 
geometrically. 



Sagr. 
Please 
give 
us 
the 
demonstration 
not 
only 
for 
my 
own 
sake 
but 
also 
for 
Simplicioprovidedyouthinkwecanunderstand 
it. 


Salv. 
I’ll 
see 
if 
I 
can 
recall 
it 
on 
the 
spur 
of 
the 
moment. 
At 
the 
outset, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
original 
thick 
rod 
of 
silver 
and 
the 
wire 
drawn 
out 
to 
an 
enormous 
length 
are 
two 
cylinders 
of 
the 
same 
volume, 
since 
they 
are 
the 
same 
body 
of 
silver. 
So 
that, 
if 
I 
determine 
the 
ratio 
between 
the 
surfaces 
of 
cylindersof 
thesamevolume,the 
problemwillbesolved. 
I 
say 
then, 


The 
areas 
of 
cylinders 
of 
equal 
volumes, 
neglecting 
the 
bases, 
bear 
to 
each 
othera 
ratiowhichisthesquarerootoftheratioof 
theirlengths. 


Take 
two 
cylinders 
of 
equal 
volume 
having 
the 
altitudes 
AB 
and 
CD, 
between 
which 
the 
line 
E 
is 
a 
mean 
proportional. 
Then 
I 
claim 
that, 
omitting 
the 
bases 
of 
each 
cylinder, 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
cylinder 
AB 
is 
to 
that 
of 
the 
cylinder 
CD 
as 
the 
length 
AB 
is 
to 
the 
line 
E, 
that 
is, 
as 
the 
square 
root 
of 
AB 
is 
to 
the 
square 
root 
of 
CD. 
Now 
cut 
off 
the 
cylinder 
AB 
at 
F 
so 
that 
the 
altitude 
AF 
is 
equal 
to 
CD. 
Then 
since 
the 
bases 
of 
cylinders 
of 
equal 
volume 
bearto 
oneanothertheinverseratio 
oftheirheights,itfollowsthat 
the 
areaof 
the 
circular 
base 
of 
the 
cylinder 
CD 
will 
be 
to 
the 
area 
of 
the 
circular 
base 
of 
AB 
as 
the 
altitude 
BA 
is 
to 
DC: 
moreover, 
since 
circles 
are 
to 
one 
another 
as 
the 
squares 
of 
their 
diameters, 
the 
said 
squares 
will 
be 
to 
each 
other 
as 
BA 
is 
to 
CD. 
But 
BA 
is 
to 
CD 
as 
the 
square 
of 
BA 
is 
to 
the 
square 
of 
E: 
and, 
therefore, 
these 
four 
squares 
will 
form 
a 
proportion; 
and 
likewise 
their 
sides; 
so 
the 
line 
AB 
is 
to 
E 
as 
the 
diameter 
of 
circle 
C 
is 
to 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
circle 
A. 
But 
the 
diameters 
are 
proportional 
to 
the 
circumferences 
and 
the 
circumferences 
are 
proportional 
to 
the 
areas 
of 
cylinders 
of 
equal 
height; 
hence 
the 
line 
AB 
is 
to 
E 
as 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
cylinder 
CD 
is 
to 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
cylinder 
AF. 
Now 
since 
the 
height 
AF 
is 
to 
AB 
as 
the 
surface 
of 
AF 
is 
to 
the 
surface 
of 
AB; 
and 
since 
the 
height 
AB 
is 
to 
the 
line 
E 
as 
the 
surface 
CD 
is 
to 
AF, 
it 
follows, 
ex 
oequali 
in

that 
the

AF 
is

the

If 
now 
we 
apply 
these 
results 
to 
the 
case 
in 
hand, 
and 
assume 
that 
the 
silver 
cylinder 
at 
the 
time 
of 
gilding 
had 
a 
length 
of 
only 
half 
a 
cubit 
and 
a 
thickness 
three 
or 
four 
times 
that 
of 
one’s 
thumb, 
we 
shall 
find 
that, 
when 
the 
wire 
has 
been 
reduced 
to 
the 
fineness 
of 
a 
hair 
and 
has 
been 
drawn 
out 
to 
a 
length 
of 
twenty 
thousand 
cubits 
(and 
perhaps 
more), 
the 
area 
of 
its 
surface 
will 
have 
been 
increased 
not 
less 
than 
two 
hundred 
times. 
Consequently 
the 
ten 
leaves 
of 
gold 
which 
were 
laid 
on 
have 
been 
extended 
over 
a 
surface 
two 
hundred 
times 
greater, 
assuring 
us 
that 
the 
thickness 
of 
the 
gold 
which 
now 
covers 
the 
surface 
of 
so 
many 
cubits 
of 
wire 
cannot 
be 
greater 
than 
one 
twentieth 
that 
of 
an 
ordinary 
leaf 
of 
beaten 
gold. 
Consider 
now 
what 
degree 
of 
fineness 
it 
must 
have 
and 
whether 
one 
could 
conceive 
it 
to 
happen 
in 
any 
other 
way 
than 
by 
enormous 
expansion 
of 
parts; 
consider 
also 
whether 
this 
experiment 
does 
not 
suggest 
that 
physical 
bodies 
[materie 
fisiche] 
are 



composed 
of 
infinitely 
small 
indivisible 
particles, 
a 
view 
which 
is 
supported 
byothermorestrikingandconclusive 
examples.

This 
demonstration 
is 
so 
beautiful 
that, 
even 
if 
it 
does 
not 
have 
the 
cogency 
originally 
intended, 
— 
although 
to 
my

it 
is

Since 
you 
are 
so 
fond 
of 
these 
geometrical 
demonstrations, 
which 
carry 
with 
them 
distinct 
gain, 
I 
will 
give 
you 
a 
companion 
theorem 
which 
answers 
an 
extremely 
interesting 
query. 
We 
have 
seen 
above 
what 
relations 
hold 
between 
equal 
cylinders 
of 
different 
height 
or 
length; 
let 
us 
now 
see 
what 
holds 
when 
the 
cylinders 
are 
equal 
in 
area 
but 
unequal 
in 
height, 
understanding 
area 
to 
include 
the 
curved 
surface, 
but 
not 
the 
upper 
and 
lower 
bases. 
The 
theoremis: 


The 
volumes 
of 
right 
cylinders 
having 
equal 
curved 
surfaces 
are 
inversely 
proportionaltotheiraltitudes. 


Let 
the 
surfaces 
of 
the 
two 
cylinders, 
AE 
and 
CF, 
be 
equal 
but 
let 
the 
height 
of 
the 
latter, 
CD, 
be 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
the 
former, 
AB: 
then 
I 
say 
that 
the 
volume 
of 
the 
cylinder 
AE 
is 
to 
that 
of 
the 
cylinder 
CF 
as 
the 
height 
CD 
is 
toAB. 
NowsincethesurfaceofCFisequaltothesurfaceofAE,itfollows 
that 
the 
volume 
of 
CF 
is 
less 
than 
that 
of 
AE; 
for, 
if 
they 
were 
equal, 
the 
surface 
of 
CF 
would, 
by 
the 
preceding 
proposition, 
exceed 
that 
of 
AE, 
and 
the 
excess 
would 
be 
so 
much 
the 
greater 
if 
the 
volume 
of 
the 
cylinder 
CF 
were 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
AE. 
Let 
us 
now 
take 
a 
cylinder 
ID 
having 
a 
volume 
equal 
to 
that 
of 
AE; 
then, 
according 
to 
the 
preceding 
theorem, 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
cylinder 
ID 
is 
to 
the 
surface 
of 
AE 
as 
the 
altitude 
IF 
is 
to 
the 
mean 
proportional 
between 
IF 
and 
AB. 
But 
since 
one 
datum 
of 
the 
problem 
is 
that 
the 
surface 
of 
AE 
is 
equal 
to 
that 
of 
CF, 
and 
since 
the 
surface 
ID 
is 
to 
the 
surface 
CF 
as 
the 
altitude 
IF 
is 
to 
the 
altitude 
CD, 
it 
follows 
that 
CD 
is 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
IF 
and 
AB. 
Not 
only 
so, 
but 
since 
the 
volume 
of 
the 
cylinder 
ID 
is 
equal 
to 
that 
of 
AE, 
each 
will 
bear 
the 
same 
ratio 
to 
the 
volume 
of 
the 
cylinder 
CF; 
but 
the 
volume 
ID 
is 
to 
the 
volume 
CF 
as 
the 
altitude 
IF 
is 
to 
the 
altitude 
CD; 
hence 
the 
volume 
of 
AE 
is 
to 
the 
volume 
of 
CF 
as 
the 
length 
IF 
is 
to 
the 
length 
CD, 
that 
is, 
as 
the 
length 
CD 
is 
to 
the 
length 
AB.

This

a 
phenomenon

wonder, 
namely, 
if 
we 
have 
a 
piec

the

we

Salv. 
Your 
illustration 
makes 
my 
meaning 
clear 
and 
is 
quite 
as 
well 
fitted, 
as 
what 
I 
have 
just 
said, 
to 
explain 
the 
wonderful 
phenomenon 
of 
the 
strings 
of 
thecittern[cetera] 
or 
of 
the 
spinet 
[cimbalo], 
namely, 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
vibrating 
string 
will 
set 
another 
string 
in 
motion 
and 
cause 
it 
to 
sound 
not 
only 
when 
thelatterisinunisonbuteven 
whenitdiffers 
from 
the 
formerby 
an 
octaveor 
a 
fifth. 
A 
string 
which 
has 
been 
struck 
begins 
to 
vibrate 
and 
continues 
the 
motion 
as 
long 
as 
one 
hears 
the 
sound 
[risonanza]; 
these 
vibrations 
cause 
the 
immediately 
surrounding 
air 
to 
vibrate 
and 
quiver; 
then 
these 
ripples 
in 
the 
air 
expand 
far 
into 
space 
and 
strike 
not 
only 
all 
the 
strings 
of 
the 
same 
instrument 
but 
even 
those 
of 
neighboring 
instruments. 
Since 
that 
string 
which 
is 
tuned 
to 
unison 
with 
the 
one 
plucked 
is 
capable 
of 
vibrating 
with 
the 
same 
frequency, 
it 
acquires, 
at 
the 
first 
impulse, 
a 
slight 
oscillation; 
after 
receiving 
two, 
three, 
twenty, 
or 
more 
impulses, 
delivered 
at 
proper 
intervals, 
it 
finally 
accumulates 
a 
vibratory 
motion 
equal 
to 
that 
of 
the 
plucked 
string, 
as 
is 
clearly 
shown 
by 
equality 
of 
amplitude 
in 
their 
vibrations. 
This 
undulation 
expands 
through 
the 
air 
and 
sets 
into 
vibration 
not 
only 
strings, 
but 
also 
any 
other 
body 
which 
happens 
to 
have 
the 
same 
period 
as 
that 
of 
the 
plucked 
string. 
Accordingly 
if 
we 
attach 
to 
the 
side 
of 
an 
instrument 
small 
pieces 
of 
bristle 
or 
other 
flexible 
bodies, 
we 
shall 
observe 
that, 
when 
a 
spinet 
is 
sounded, 
only 
those 
pieces 
respond 
that 
have 
the 
same 
period 
as 
the 
string 
which 
has 
been 
struck; 
the 
remaining 
pieces 
do 
not 
vibrate 
in 
response 
to 
this 
string,nordotheformerpieces 
respond 
toanyothertone. 


If 
one 
bows 
the 
base 
string 
on 
a 
viola 
rather 
smartly 
and 
brings 
near 
it 
a 
goblet 
of 
fine, 
thin 
glass 
having 
the 
same 
tone 
[tuono] 
as 
that 
of 
the 
string, 
this 
goblet 
will 
vibrate 
and 
audibly 
resound. 
That 
the 
undulations 
of 
the 
medium 
are 
widely 
dispersed 
about 
the 
sounding 
body 
is 
evinced 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
glass 
of 
water 
may 
be 
made 
to 
emit 
a 
tone 
merely 
by 
the 
friction 
of 
the 
finger-tip 
upon 
the 
rim 
of 
the 
glass; 
for 
in 
this 
water 
is 
produced 
a 
series 
of 
regular 
waves. 
The 
same 
phenomenon 
is 
observed 
to 
better 
advantage 
by 
fixing 
the 
base 
of 
the 
goblet 
upon 
the 
bottom 
of 
a 
rather 
large 
vessel 
of 
water 
filled 
nearly 
to 
the 
edge 
of 
the 
goblet; 
for 
if, 
as 
before, 
we 
sound 
the 
glass 
by 
frictionofthefinger,weshallseeripplesspreadingwith 
the 
utmostregularity 
and 
with 
high 
speed 
to 
large 
distances 
about 
the 
glass. 
I 
have 
often 
remarked, 
in 
thus 
sounding 
a 
rather 
large 
glass 
nearly 
full 
of 
water, 
that 
at 
first 
the 
waves 
are 
spaced 
with 
great 
uniformity, 
and 
when, 
as 
sometimes 
happens, 
the 
tone 
of 
the 
glass 
jumps 
an 
octave 
higher 
I 
have 
noted 
that 
at 
this 
moment 



each 
of 
the 
aforesaid 
waves 
divides 
into 
two; 
a 
phenomenon 
which 
shows 
clearlythat 
the 
ratio

Sagr. 
More 
than 
once 
have 
I 
observed 
this 
same 
thing, 
much 
to 
my 
delight 
and 
also 
to 
my 
profit. 
For 
a 
long 
time 
I 
have 
been 
perplexed 
about 
these 
different 
harmonies 
since 
the 
explanations 
hitherto 
given 
by 
those 
learned 
in 
music 
impress 
me 
as 
not 
sufficiently 
conclusive. 
They 
tell 
us 
that 
the 
diapason, 
i. 
e. 
the 
octave, 
involves 
the 
ratio 
of 
two, 
that 
the 
diapente 
which 
we 
call 
the 
fifth 
involves 
a 
ratio 
of 
3:2, 
etc.; 
because 
if 
the 
open 
string 
of 
a 
monochord 
be 
sounded 
and 
afterwards 
a 
bridge 
be 
placed 
in 
the 
middle 
and 
the 
half 
length 
be 
sounded 
one 
hears 
the 
octave; 
and 
if 
the 
bridge 
be 
placed 
at 
1/3 
the 
length 
of 
the 
string, 
then 
on 
plucking 
first 
the 
open 
string 
and 
afterwards 
2/3 
of 
its 
length 
the 
fifth 
is 
given; 
for 
this 
reason 
they 
say 
that 
the 
octave 
depends 
upon 
the 
ratio 
of 
two 
to 
one 
[contenuta 
tra’l 
due 
e 
l’uno] 
and 
the 
fifth 
upon 
the 
ratio 
of 
three 
to 
two. 
This 
explanation 
does 
not 
impress 
me 
as 
sufficient 
to 
establish 
2 
and 
3/2 
as 
the 
natural 
ratios 
of 
the 
octave 
and 
the 
fifth; 
and 
my 
reason 
for 
thinking 
so 
is 
as 
follows. 
There 
are 
three 
different 
ways 
in 
which 
the 
tone 
of 
a 
string 
may 
be 
sharpened, 
namely, 
by 
shortening 
it, 
by 
stretching 
it 
and 
by 
making 
it 
thinner. 
If 
the 
tension 
and 
size 
of 
the 
stringremain 
constant 
oneobtains 
the 
octaveby 
shorteningit 
toone-half, 
i.e., 
by 
sounding 
first 
the 
open 
string 
and 
then 
one-half 
of 
it; 
but 
if 
length 
and 
size 
remain 
constant 
and 
one 
attempts 
to 
produce 
the 
octave 
by 
stretching 
he 
will 
find 
that 
it 
does 
not 
suffice 
to 
double 
the 
stretching 
weight; 
it 
must 
be 
quadrupled; 
so 
that, 
if 
the 
fundamental 
note 
is 
produced 
by 
a 
weight 
of 
one 
pound,fourwillberequired 
tobringouttheoctave. 


And 
finally 
if 
the 
length 
and 
tension 
remain 
constant, 
while 
one 
changes 
thesize15 
of 
the 
string 
he 
will 
find 
that 
in 
order 
to 
produce 
the 
octave 
the 
size 
must 
be 
reduced 
to 
¼ 
that 
which 
gave 
the 
fundamental. 
And 
what 
I 
have 
said 
concerning 
the 
octave, 
namely, 
that 
its 
ratio 
as 
derived 
from 
the 
tension 
and 
size 
of 
the 
string 
is 
the 
square 
of 
that 
derived 
from 
the 
length, 
applies 
equally 
well 
to 
all 
other 
musical 
intervals 
[intervalli 
musici]. 
Thus 
if 
one 
wishes 
to 
produce 
a 
fifth 
by 
changing 
the 
length 
he 
finds 
that 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
lengths 
must 
be 
sesquialteral, 
in 
other 
words 
he 
sounds 
first 
the 
open 
string, 
then 
two-thirds 
of 
it; 
but 
if 
he 
wishes 
to 
produce 
this 
same 
result 
by 
stretching 
or 
thinning 
the 
string 
then 
it 
becomes 
necessary 
to 
square 
the 
ratio 
3/2 
that 
is 
by 
taking 
9/4 
[dupla 
sesquiquarta]; 
accordingly, 
if 
the 
fundamental 
requires 
a 
weight 
of 
4 
pounds, 
the 
higher 
note 
will 
be 
produced 
not 
by 
6, 
but 
by 
9 



pounds; 
the 
same 
is 
true 
in 
regard 
to 
size, 
the 
string 
which 
gives 
the 
fundamentalislargerthanthatwhichyieldsthefifthin 
the 
ratioof9to4.

[Trans.] 


In 
view 
of 
these 
facts, 
I 
see 
no 
reason 
why 
those 
wise 
philosophers 
should 
adopt 
2 
rather 
than 
4 
as 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
octave, 
or 
why 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
fifth 
they 
should 
employthe 
sesquialteral 
ratio, 
3/2,ratherthanthatof9/4. 
Since 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
count 
the 
vibrations 
of 
a 
sounding 
string 
on 
account 
of 
its 
high 
frequency, 
I 
should 
still 
have 
been 
in 
doubt 
as 
to 
whether 
a 
string, 
emitting 
the 
upper 
octave, 
made 
twice 
as 
many 
vibrations 
in 
the 
same 
time 
as 
one 
giving 
the 
fundamental, 
had 
it 
not 
been 
for 
the 
following 
fact, 
namely, 
that 
at 
the 
instant 
when 
the 
tone 
jumps 
to 
the 
octave, 
the 
waves 
which 
constantly 
accompany 
the 
vibrating 
glass 
divide 
up 
into 
smaller 
ones 
which 
arepreciselyhalf 
aslongas 
the 
former. 


Salv. 
This 
is 
a 
beautiful 
experiment 
enabling 
us 
to 
distinguish 
individually 
the 
waves 
which 
are 
produced 
by 
the 
vibrations 
of 
a 
sonorous 
body, 
which 
spread 
through 
the 
air, 
bringing 
to 
the 
tympanum 
of 
the 
ear 
a 
stimulus 
which 
the 
mind 
translates 
into 
sound. 
But 
since 
these 
waves 
in 
the 
water 
last 
only 
so 
long 
as 
the 
friction 
of 
the 
finger 
continues 
and 
are, 
even 
then, 
not 
constant 
but 
are 
always 
forming 
and 
disappearing, 
would 
it 
not 
be 
a 
fine 
thing 
if 
one 
had 
the 
ability 
to 
produce 
waves 
which 
would 
persist 
for 
a 
long 
while, 
even 
monthsandyears,soastoeasilymeasureandcountthem?

Salv. 
The 
device 
is 
one 
which 
I 
hit 
upon 
by 
accident; 
my 
part 
consists 
merely 
in 
the 
observation 
of 
it 
and 
in 
the 
appreciation 
of 
its 
value 
as 
a 
confirmation 
of 
something 
to 
which 
I 
had 
given 
profound 
consideration; 
and 
yet 
the 
device 
is, 
in 
itself, 
rather 
common. 
As 
I 
was 
scraping 
a 
brass 
plate 
with 
a 
sharp 
iron 
chisel 
in 
orderto 
remove 
some 
spots 
fromitandwasrunning 
thechiselrather 
rapidly 
over 
it, 
I 
once 
or 
twice, 
during 
many 
strokes, 
heard 
the 
plate 
emit 
a 
rather 
strong 
and 
clear 
whistling 
sound; 
on 
looking 
at 
the 
plate 
more 
carefully, 
I 
noticed 
a 
long 
row 
of 
fine 
streaks 
parallel 
and 
equidistant 
from 
one 
another. 
Scraping 
with 
the 
chisel 
over 
and 
over 
again, 
I 
noticed 
that 
it 
was 
only 
when 
the 
plate 
emitted 
this 
hissing 
noise 
that 
any 
marks 
were 
left 
upon 
it; 
when 
the 
scraping 
was 
not 
accompanied 
by 
this 
sibilant 
note 
there 
was 
not 
the 
least 
trace 
of 
such 
marks. 
Repeating 
the 
trick 
several 
times 
and 



making 
the 
stroke, 
now 
with 
greater 
now 
with 
less 
speed, 
the 
whistling 
followed 
with 
a 
pitch 
which 
was 
correspondingly 
higher 
and 
lower. 
I 
noted 
also 
that 
the 
marks 
made 
when 
the 
tones 
were 
higher 
were 
closer 
together; 
but 
when 
the 
tones 
were 
deeper, 
they 
were 
farther 
apart. 
I 
also 
observed 
that 
when, 
during 
a 
single 
stroke, 
the 
speed 
increased 
toward 
the 
end 
the 
sound 
became 
sharper 
and 
the 
streaks 
grew 
closer 
together, 
but 
always 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
remain 
sharply 
defined 
and 
equidistant. 
Besides 
whenever 
the 
stroke 
was 
accompanied 
by 
hissing 
I 
felt 
the 
chisel 
tremble 
in 
my 
grasp 
and 
a 
sort 
of 
shiver 
run 
throughmy 
hand. 
Inshort 
we 
seeandhear 
in 
the 
case 
ofthe 
chisel 
precisely 
that 
which 
is 
seen 
and 
heard 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
whisper 
followed 
by 
a 
loud 
voice; 
for, 
when 
the 
breath 
is 
emitted 
without 
the 
production 
of 
a 
tone, 
one 
does 
not 
feel 
either 
in 
the 
throat 
or 
mouth 
any 
motion 
to 
speak 
of 
in 
comparison 
with 
that 
which 
is 
felt 
in 
the 
larynx 
and 
upper 
part 
of 
the 
throat 
when 
the 
voice 
is 
used, 
especially 
when 
the 
tones 
employedarelowandstrong. 


At 
times 
I 
have 
also 
observed 
among 
the 
strings 
of 
the 
spinet 
two 
which 
were 
in 
unison 
with 
two 
of 
the 
tones 
produced 
by 
the 
aforesaid 
scraping; 
and 
among 
those 
which 
differed 
most 
in 
pitch 
I 
found 
two 
which 
were 
separated 
by 
an 
interval 
of 
a 
perfect 
fifth. 
Upon 
measuring 
the 
distance 
between 
the 
markings 
produced 
by 
the 
two 
scrapings 
it 
was 
found 
that 
the 
space 
which 
contained 
45 
of 
one 
contained 
30 
of 
the 
other, 
which 
is 
precisely 
the 
ratio 
assigned 
tothefifth. 


But 
now 
before 
proceeding 
any 
farther 
I 
want 
to 
call 
your 
attention 
to 
the 
fact 
that, 
of 
the 
three 
methods 
for 
sharpening 
a 
tone, 
the 
one 
which 
you 
refer 
to 
as 
the 
fineness 
of 
the 
string 
should 
be 
attributed 
to 
its 
weight. 
So 
long 
as 
the 
material 
of 
the 
string 
is 
unchanged, 
the 
size 
and 
weight 
vary 
in 
the 
same 
ratio. 
Thus 
in 
the 
case 
of 
gut-strings, 
we 
obtain 
the 
octave 
by 
making 
one 
string 
4 
times 
as 
large 
as 
the 
other; 
so 
also 
in 
the 
case 
of 
brass 
one 
wire 
must 
have 
4 
times 
the 
size 
of 
the 
other; 
but 
if 
now 
we 
wish 
to 
obtain 
the 
octave 
of 
a 
gut-string, 
by 
use 
of 
brass 
wire, 
we 
must 
make 
it, 
not 
four 
times 
as 
large, 
but 
four 
times 
as 
heavy 
as 
the 
gut-string: 
as 
regards 
size 
therefore 
the 
metal 
stringisnotfourtimes 
asbig 
but 
four 
timesas 
heavy. 
Thewire 
may 
therefore 
be 
even 
thinner 
than 
the 
gut 
notwithstanding 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
latter 
gives 
the 
higher 
note. 
Hence 
if 
two 
spinets 
are 
strung, 
one 
with 
gold 
wire 
the 
other 
with 
brass, 
and 
if 
the 
corresponding 
strings 
each 
have 
the 
same 
length, 
diameter, 
and 
tension 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
instrumentstrungwithgold 
will 
have 
a 
pitch 
about 
one-fifth 
lower 
than 
the 
other 
because 
gold 
has 
a 
density 
almost 



twice 
that 
of 
brass. 
And 
here 
it 
is 
to 
be 
noted 
that 
it 
is 
the 
weight 
rather 
than 
the 
size 
of 
a 
moving 
body 
which 
offers 
resistance 
to 
change 
of 
motion 
[velocità 
del 
moto] 
contrary 
to 
what 
one 
might 
at 
first 
glance 
think. 
For 
it 
seems 
reasonable 
to 
believe 
that 
a 
body 
which 
is 
large 
and 
light 
should 
suffer 
greater 
retardation 
of 
motion 
in 
thrusting 
aside 
the 
medium 
than 
would 
one 
which 
isthinandheavy;yethereexactlytheopposite 
istrue. 


Returning 
now 
to 
the 
original 
subject 
of 
discussion, 
I 
assert 
that 
the 
ratio 
of 
a 
musical 
interval 
is 
not 
immediately 
determined 
either 
by 
the 
length, 
size, 
or 
tension 
of 
the 
strings 
but 
rather 
by 
the 
ratio 
of 
their 
frequencies, 
that 
is, 
by 
the 
number 
of 
pulses 
of 
air 
waves 
which 
strike 
the 
tympanum 
of 
the 
ear, 
causing 
it 
also 
to 
vibrate 
with 
the 
same 
frequency. 
This 
fact 
established, 
we 
may 
possibly 
explain 
why 
certain 
pairs 
of 
notes, 
differing 
in 
pitch 
produce 
a 
pleasing 
sensation, 
others 
a 
less 
pleasant 
effect, 
and 
still 
others 
a 
disagreeable 
sensation. 
Such 
an 
explanation 
would 
be 
tantamount 
to 
an 
explanation 
of 
the 
more 
or 
less 
perfect 
consonances 
and 
of 
dissonances. 
The 
unpleasant 
sensation 
produced 
by 
the 
latter 
arises, 
I 
think, 
from 
the 
discordant 
vibrations 
of 
two 
different 
tones 
which 
strike 
the 
ear 
out 
of 
time 
[sproporzionatamente]. 
Especially 
harsh 
is 
the 
dissonance 
between 
notes 
whose 
frequencies 
are 
incommensurable; 
such 
a 
case 
occurs 
when 
one 
has 
two 
strings 
in 
unison 
and 
sounds 
one 
of 
them 
open, 
together 
with 
a 
part 
of 
the 
other 
which 
bears 
the 
same 
ratio 
to 
its 
whole 
length 
as 
the 
side 
of 
a 
square 
bears 
to 
the 
diagonal; 
this 
yields 
a 
dissonance 
similar 
to 
the 
augmented 
fourth 
or 
diminished 
fifth 
[tritono 
o 
semidiapente]. 


Agreeable 
consonances 
are 
pairs 
of 
tones 
which 
strike 
the 
ear 
with 
a 
certain 
regularity; 
this 
regularity 
consists 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
pulses 
delivered 
by 
the 
two 
tones, 
in 
the 
same 
interval 
of 
time, 
shall 
be 
commensurable 
in 
number, 
so 
as 
not 
to 
keep 
the 
ear 
drum 
in 
perpetual 
torment, 
bending 
in 
two 
differentdirectionsin 
order 
toyieldtotheever-discordantimpulses. 


The 
first 
and 
most 
pleasing 
consonance 
is, 
therefore, 
the 
octave 
since, 
for 
every 
pulse 
given 
to 
the 
tympanum 
by 
the 
lower 
string, 
the 
sharp 
string 
delivers 
two; 
accordingly 
at 
every 
other 
vibration 
of 
the 
upper 
string 
both 
pulses 
are 
delivered 
simultaneously 
so 
that 
one-half 
the 
entire 
number 
of 
pulses 
are 
delivered 
in 
unison. 
But 
when 
two 
strings 
are 
in 
unison 
their 
vibrations 
always 
coincide 
and 
the 
effect 
is 
that 
of 
a 
single 
string; 
hence 
we 
do 
not 
refer 
to 
it 
as 
consonance. 
The 
fifth 
is 
also 
a 
pleasing 
interval 
since 
for 
every 
two 
vibrations 
of 
the 
lower 
string 
the 
upper 
one 
gives 
three, 
so 
that 
considering 
the 
entire 
number 
of 
pulses 
from 
the 
upper 
string 
one-third 
of 



them 
will 
strike 
in 
unison, 
i. 
e., 
between 
each 
pair 
of 
concordant 
vibrations 
there 
intervene 
two 
single 
vibrations; 
and 
when 
the 
interval 
is 
a 
fourth, 
three 
single 
vibrations 
intervene. 
In 
case 
the 
interval 
is 
a 
second 
where 
the 
ratio 
is 
9/8 
it 
is 
only 
every 
ninth 
vibration 
of 
the 
upper 
string 
which 
reaches 
the 
ear 
simultaneously 
with 
one 
of 
the 
lower; 
all 
the 
others 
are 
discordant 
and 
produce 
a 
harsh 
effect 
upon 
the 
recipient 
ear 
which 
interprets 
them 
as 
dissonances. 


Simp. 
Won’t 
you 
be 
good 
enough 
to 
explain 
this 
argument 
a 
little 
more 
clearly? 


Salv. 
Let 
AB 
denote 
the 
length 
of 
a 
wave 
[lo 
spazio 
e 
la 
dilatazione 
d’una 
vibrazione] 
emitted 
by 
the 
lower 
string 
and 
CD 
that 
of 
a 
higher 
string 
which 
is 
emitting 
the 
octave 
of 
AB; 
divide 
AB 
in 
the 
middle 
at 
E. 
If 
the 
two 
strings 
begin 
their 
motions 
at 
A 
and 
C, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
when 
the 
sharp 
vibration 
has 
reached 
the 
end 
D, 
the 
other 
vibration 
will 
have 
travelled 
only 
as 
far 
as 
E, 
which, 
not 
being 
a 
terminal 
point, 
will 
emit 
no 
pulse; 
but 
there 
is 
a 
blow 
delivered 
at 
D. 
Accordingly 
when 
the 
one 
wave 
comes 
back 
from 
D 
to 
C, 
the 
other 
passes 
on 
from 
E 
to 
B; 
hence 
the 
two 
pulses 
from 
B 
and 
C 
strike 
the 
drum 
of 
the 
ear 
simultaneously. 
Seeing 
that 
these 
vibrations 
are 
repeated 
again 
and 
again 
in 
the 
same 
manner, 
we 
conclude 
that 
each 
alternate 
pulse 
from 
CD 
falls 
in 
unison 
with 
one 
from 
AB. 
But 
each 
of 
the 
pulsations 
at 
the 
terminal 
points, 
A 
and 
B, 
is 
constantly 
accompanied 
by 
one 
which 
leaves 
always 
from 
C 
or 
always 
from 
D. 
This 
is 
clear 
because 
if 
we 
suppose 
the 
waves 
to 
reach 
A 
and 
C 
at 
the 
same 
instant, 
then, 
while 
one 
wave 
travels 
from 
A 
to 
B, 
the 
other 
will 
proceed 
from 
C 
to 
D 
and 
back 
to 
C, 
so 
that 
waves 
strikeat 
C 
and 
Bsimultaneously; 
during 
thepassage 
of 
the 
wavefrom 
B 
back 
to 
A 
the 
disturbance 
at 
C 
goes 
to 
D 
and 
again 
returns 
to 
C, 
so 
that 
once 
more 
thepulses 
atAandCaresimultaneous. 



Next 
let 
the 
vibrations 
AB 
and 
CD 
be 
separated 
by 
an 
interval 
of 
a 
fifth, 
that 
is, 
by 
a 
ratio 
of 
3/2; 
choose 
the 
points 
E 
and 
O 
such 
that 
they 
will 
divide 
the 
wave 
length 
of 
the 
lower 
string 
into 
three 
equal 
parts 
and 
imagine 
the 
vibrations 
to 
start 
at 
the 
same 
instant 
from 
each 
of 
the 
terminals 
A 
and 
C. 
It 
is 
evident 
that 
when 
the 
pulse 
has 
been 
delivered 
at 
the 
terminal 
D, 
the 
wave 
in 
AB 
has 
travelled 
only 
as 
far 
as 
O; 
the 
drum 
of 
the 
ear 
receives, 
therefore, 
only 
the 
pulse 
from 
D. 
Then 
during 
the 
return 
of 
the 
one 
vibration 
from 
D 
to 
C, 
the 
other 
will 
pass 
from 
O 
to 
B 
and 
then 
back 
to 
O, 
producing 
an 
isolated 
pulse 
at 
B 
— 
a 
pulse 
which 
is 
out 
of 
time 
but 
one 
which 
must 
be 
taken 
into 
consideration. 


Now 
since 
we 
have 
assumed 
that 
the 
first 
pulsations 
started 
from 
the 
terminals 
A 
and 
C 
at 
the 
same 
instant, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
second 
pulsation, 
isolated 
at 
D, 
occurred 
after 
an 
interval 
of 
time 
equal 
to 
that 
required 
for 
passage 
from 
C 
to 
D 
or, 
what 
is 
the 
same 
thing, 
from 
A 
to 
O; 
but 
the 
next 



pulsation, 
the 
one 
at 
B, 
is 
separated 
from 
the 
preceding 
by 
only 
half 
this 
interval, 
namely, 
the 
time 
required 
for 
passage 
from 
O 
to 
B. 
Next 
while 
the 
one 
vibration 
travels 
from 
O 
to 
A, 
the 
other 
travels 
from 
C 
to 
D, 
the 
result 
of 
which 
is 
that 
two 
pulsations 
occur 
simultaneously 
at 
A 
and 
D. 
Cycles 
of 
this 
kind 
follow 
one 
after 
another, 
i. 
e., 
one 
solitary 
pulse 
of 
the 
lower 
string 
interposed 
between 
two 
solitary 
pulses 
of 
the 
upper 
string. 
Let 
us 
now 
imagine 
time 
to 
be 
divided 
into 
very 
small 
equal 
intervals; 
then 
if 
we 
assume 
that, 
during 
the 
first 
two 
of 
these 
intervals, 
the 
disturbances 
which 
occurred 
simultaneously 
at 
A 
and 
C 
have 
travelled 
as 
far 
as 
O 
and 
D 
and 
have 
produced 
a 
pulse 
at 
D; 
and 
if 
we 
assume 
that 
during 
the 
third 
and 
fourth 
intervals 
one 
disturbance 
returns 
from 
D 
to 
C, 
producing 
a 
pulse 
at 
C, 
while 
the 
other,passing 
on 
from 
O 
to 
B 
and 
back 
to 
O,produces 
a 
pulse 
at 
B; 
and 
if 
finally, 
during 
the 
fifth 
and 
sixth 
intervals, 
the 
disturbances 
travel 
from 
O 
and 
C 
to 
A 
and 
D, 
producing 
a 
pulse 
at 
each 
of 
the 
latter 
two, 
then 
the 
sequence 
in 
which 
the 
pulses 
strike 
the 
ear 
will 
be 
such 
that, 
if 
we 
begin 
to 
count 
time 
from 
any 
instant 
where 
two 
pulses 
are 
simultaneous, 
the 
ear 
drum 
will, 
after 
thelapse 
oftwoofthesaidintervals,receive 
a 
solitarypulse;at 
theendofthe 
third 
interval, 
another 
solitary 
pulse; 
so 
also 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
fourth 
interval; 
and 
two 
intervals 
later, 
i. 
e., 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
sixth 
interval, 
will 
be 
heard 
two 
pulses 
in 
unison. 
Here 
ends 
the 
cycle 
— 
the 
anomaly, 
so 
to 
speak 
— 
which 
repeatsitselfoverandoveragain. 


Sagr. 
I 
can 
no 
longer 
remain 
silent; 
for 
I 
must 
express 
to 
you 
the 
great 
pleasure 
I 
have 
in 
hearing 
such 
a 
complete 
explanation 
of 
phenomena 
with 
regard 
to 
which 
I 
have 
so 
long 
been 
in 
darkness. 
Now 
I 
understand 
why 
unison 
does 
not 
differ 
from 
a 
single 
tone; 
I 
understand 
why 
the 
octave 
is 
the 
principal 
harmony, 
but 
so 
like 
unison 
as 
often 
to 
be 
mistaken 
for 
it 
and 
also 
why 
it 
occurs 
with 
the 
other 
harmonies. 
It 
resembles 
unison 
because 
the 
pulsations 
of 
strings 
in 
unison 
always 
occur 
simultaneously, 
and 
those 
of 
the 
lower 
string 
of 
the 
octave 
are 
always 
accompanied 
by 
those 
of 
the 
upper 
string; 
and 
among 
the 
latter 
is 
interposed 
a 
solitary 
pulse 
at 
equal 
intervals 
and 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
as 
to 
produce 
no 
disturbance; 
the 
result 
is 
that 
such 
a 
harmony 
is 
rather 
too 
much 
softened 
and 
lacks 
fire. 
But 
the 
fifth 
is 
characterized 
by 
its 
displaced 
beats 
and 
by 
the 
interposition 
of 
two 
solitary 
beats 
of 
the 
upper 
string 
and 
one 
solitary 
beat 
of 
the 
lower 
string 
between 
each 
pair 
of 
simultaneous 
pulses; 
these 
three 
solitary 
pulses 
are 
separated 
by 
intervals 
of 
time 
equal 
to 
half 
the 
interval 
which 
separates 
each 
pair 
of 



simultaneous 
beats 
from 
the 
solitary 
beats 
of 
the 
upper 
string. 
Thus 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
fifth 
is 
to 
produce 
a 
tickling 
of 
the 
ear 
drum 
such 
that 
its 
softness 
is 
modified 
with 
sprightliness, 
giving 
at 
the 
same 
moment 
the 
impression 
of 
a 
gentle 
kissandofabite. 


Salv. 
Seeing 
that 
you 
have 
derived 
so 
much 
pleasure 
from 
these 
novelties, 
I 
must 
show 
you 
a 
method 
by 
which 
the 
eye 
may 
enjoy 
the 
same 
game 
as 
the 
ear. 
Suspend 
three 
balls 
of 
lead, 
or 
other 
heavy 
material, 
by 
means 
of 
strings 
of 
different 
length 
such 
that 
while 
the 
longest 
makes 
two 
vibrations 
the 
shortest 
will 
make 
four 
and 
the 
medium 
three; 
this 
will 
take 
place 
when 
the 
longest 
string 
measures 
16, 
either 
in 
hand 
breadths 
or 
in 
any 
other 
unit, 
the 
medium9andtheshortest4,allmeasuredin 
thesameunit. 


Now 
pull 
all 
these 
pendulums 
aside 
from 
the 
perpendicular 
and 
release 
them 
at 
the 
same 
instant; 
you 
will 
see 
a 
curious 
interplay 
of 
the 
threads 
passing 
each 
other 
in 
various 
manners 
but 
such 
that 
at 
the 
completion 
of 
every 
fourth 
vibration 
of 
the 
longest 
pendulum, 
all 
three 
will 
arrive 
simultaneously 
at 
the 
same 
terminus, 
whence 
they 
start 
over 
again 
to 
repeat 
the 
same 
cycle. 
This 
combination 
of 
vibrations, 
when 
produced 
on 
strings 
is 
precisely 
that 
which 
yields 
the 
interval 
of 
the 
octave 
and 
the 
intermediate 
fifth. 
If 
we 
employ 
the 
same 
disposition 
of 
apparatus 
but 
change 
the 
lengths 
of 
the 
threads, 
always 
however 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
their 
vibrations 
correspond 
to 
those 
of 
agreeable 
musical 
intervals, 
we 
shall 
see 
a 
different 
crossing 
of 
these 
threads 
but 
always 
such 
that, 
after 
a 
definite 
interval 
of 
time 
and 
after 
a 
definite 
number 
of 
vibrations, 
all 
the 
threads, 
whether 
three 
or 
four, 
will 
reach 
the 
same 
terminus 
at 
the 
same 
instant, 
and 
then 
begin 
a 
repetition 
of 
the 
cycle. 


If 
however 
the 
vibrations 
of 
two 
or 
more 
strings 
are 
incommensurable 
so 
that 
they 
never 
complete 
a 
definite 
number 
of 
vibrations 
at 
the 
same 
instant, 
or 
if 
commensurable 
they 
return 
only 
after 
a 
long 
interval 
of 
time 
and 
after 
a 
large 
number 
of 
vibrations, 
then 
the 
eye 
is 
confused 
by 
the 
disorderly 
succession 
of 
crossed 
threads. 
In 
like 
manner 
the 
ear 
is 
pained 
by 
an 
irregular 
sequenceof 
air 
waveswhichstrike 
thetympanumwithoutanyfixedorder. 


But, 
gentlemen, 
whither 
have 
we 
drifted 
during 
these 
many 
hours 
lured 
on 
by 
various 
problems 
and 
unexpected 
digressions? 
The 
day 
is 
already 
ended 
and 
we 
have 
scarcely 
touched 
the 
subject 
proposed 
for 
discussion. 
Indeed 
we 
have 
deviated 
so 
far 
that 
I 
remember 
only 
with 
difficulty 
our 
early 



introduction 
and 
the 
little 
progress 
made 
in 
the 
way 
of

and

Sagr. 
Let 
us 
then 
adjourn 
for 
to-day 
in 
order 
that 
our

may 
find

in 
sleep

that

Second 
Day 


SAGR. 
While 
Simplicio 
and 
I 
were 
awaiting 
your 
arrival 
we 
were 
trying 
to 
recall 
that 
last 
consideration 
which 
you 
advanced 
as 
a 
principle 
and 
basis 
for 
the 
results 
you 
intended 
to 
obtain; 
this 
consideration 
dealt 
with 
the 
resistance 
which 
all 
solids 
offer 
to 
fracture 
and 
depended 
upon 
a 
certain 
cement 
which 
held 
the 
parts 
glued 
together 
so 
that 
they 
would 
yield 
and 
separate 
only 
under 
considerable 
pull 
[potente 
attrazzione]. 
Later 
we 
tried 
to 
find 
the 
explanation 
of 
this 
coherence, 
seeking 
it 
mainly 
in 
the 
vacuum; 
this 
was 
the 
occasion 
of 
ourmany 
digressionswhichoccupiedtheentiredayandledusfarafieldfrom 
the 
original 
question 
which, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
stated, 
was 
the 
consideration 
of 
theresistance 
[resistenza]that 
solidsoffertofracture. 


Salv. 
I 
remember 
it 
all 
very 
well. 
Resuming 
the 
thread 
of 
our 
discourse, 
whatever 
the 
nature 
of 
this 
resistance 
which 
solids 
offer 
to 
large 
tractive 
forces 
[violenta 
attrazzione] 
there 
can 
at 
least 
be 
no 
doubt 
of 
its 
existence; 
and 
though 
this 
resistance 
is 
very 
great 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
direct 
pull, 
it 
is 
found, 
as 
a 
rule, 
to 
be 
less 
in 
the 
case 
of 
bending 
forces 
[nel 
violentargli 
per 
traverso]. 
Thus, 
for 
example, 
a 
rod 
of 
steel 
or 
of 
glass 
will 
sustain 
a 
longitudinal 
pull 
of 
a 
thousand 
pounds 
while 
a 
weight 
of 
fifty 
pounds 
would 
be 
quite 
sufficient 
to 
break 
it 
if 
the 
rod 
were 
fastened 
at 
right 
angles 
into 
a 
vertical 
wall. 
It 
is 
this 
second 
type 
of 
resistance 
which 
we 
must 
consider, 
seeking 
to 
discover 
in 
what 
proportion 
it 
is 
found 
in 
prisms 
and 
cylinders 
of 
the 
same 
material, 
whether 
alike 
or 
unlike 
in 
shape, 
length, 
and 
thickness. 
In 
this 
discussion 
I 
shall 
take 
for 
granted 
the 
well-known 
mechanical 
principle 
which 
has 
been 
shown 
to 
govern 
the 
behavior 
of 
a 
bar, 
which 
we 
call 
a 
lever, 
namely, 
that 
the 
force 
bears 
to 
the 
resistance 
the 
inverse 
ratio 
of 
the 
distances 
which

Yes,

but 
as 
regards 
rigor 
of 
demonstration 
the

must 
be 
given 
to 
Archimedes,

Sagr. 
Since 
now 
this 
principle 
is 
fundamental 
to 
all 
the 
demonstrations 
which 
you 
propose 
to 
set 
forth 
would 
it 
not 
be 
advisable 
to 
give 
us 
a 
complete 
and 
thorough 
proof 
of 
this 
proposition 
unless 
possibly 
it 
would 
take 
too 
much 
time? 


Salv. 
Yes, 
that 
would 
be 
quite 
proper, 
but 
it 
is 
better 
I 
think 
to 
approach 
our 
subject 
in 
a 
manner 
somewhat 
different 
from 
that 
employed 
by 
Archimedes, 
namely, 
by 
first 
assuming 
merely 
that 
equal 
weights 
placed 
in 
a 
balance 
of 
equal 
arms 
will 
produce 
equilibrium 
— 
a 
principle 
also 
assumed 
by 
Archimedes 
— 
and 
then 
proving 
that 
it 
is 
no 
less 
true 
that 
unequal 
weights 
produce 
equilibrium 
when 
the 
arms 
of 
the 
steelyard 
have 
lengths 
inversely 
proportional 
to 
the 
weights 
suspended 
from 
them; 
in 
other 
words, 
it 
amounts 
to 
the 
same 
thing 
whether 
one 
places 
equal 
weights 
at 
equal 
distances 
or 
unequal 
weights 
at 
distances 
which 
bear 
to 
each 
other 
the 
inverse 
ratio 
of 
the 
weights. 


In 
order 
to 
make 
this 
matter 
clear 
imagine 
a 
prism 
or 
solid 
cylinder, 
AB, 
suspendedateachendto 
the 
rod[linea] 
HI,and 
supportedbytwo 
threadsHA 
and 
IB; 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
if 
I 
attach 
a 
thread, 
C, 
at 
the 
middle 
point 
of 
the 
balance 
beam 
HI, 
the 
entire 
prism 
AB 
will, 
according 
to 
the 
principle 
assumed, 
hang 
in 
equilibrium 
since 
one-half 
its 
weight 
lies 
on 
one 
side, 
and 
the 
other 
half 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
of 
the 
point 
of 
suspension 
C. 
Now 
suppose 
the 
prism 
to 
be 
divided 
into 
unequal 
parts 
by 
a 
plane 
through 
the 
line 
D, 
and 
let 
the 
part 
DA 
be 
the 
larger 
and 
DB 
the 
smaller: 
this 
division 
having 
been 
made, 
imagine 
a 
thread 
ED, 
attached 
at 
the 
point 
E 
and 
supporting 
the 
parts 
AD 
andDB,inorderthatthesepartsmayremaininthesamepositionrelative 
to 
line 
HI: 
and 
since 
the 
relative 
position 
of 
the 
prism 
and 
the 
beam 
HI 
remains 
unchanged, 
there 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
but 
that 
the 
prism 
will 
maintain 
its 
former 
state 
of 
equilibrium. 
But 
circumstances 
would 
remain 
the 
same 
if 
that 
part 
of 
the 
prism 
which 
is 
now 
held 
up, 
at 
the 
ends, 
by 
the 
threads 
AH 
and 
DE 
were 
supported 
at 
the 
middle 
by 
a 
single 
thread 
GL; 
and 
likewise 
the 
other 
part 
DB 
would 
not 
change 
position 
if 
held 
by 
a 
thread 
FM 
placed 
at 
its 
middle 
point. 
Suppose 
now 
the 
threads 
HA, 
ED, 
and 
IB 
to 
be 
removed, 
leaving 
only 
the 
two 
GL 
and 
FM, 
then 
the 
same 
equilibrium 
will 
be 
maintained 
so 
long 
as 
the 
suspension 
is 
at 
C. 
Now 
let 
us 
consider 
that 
we 
have 
here 
two 
heavy 
bodies 
AD 
and 
DB 
hung 
at 
the 
ends 
G 
and 
F, 
of 
a 



balance 
beam 
GF 
in 
equilibrium 
about 
the 
point 
C, 
so 
that 
the 
line 
CG 
is 
the 
distance 
fromCto 
the 
pointofsuspensionoftheheavy 
bodyAD,whileCFis 
the 
distance 
at 
which 
the 
other 
heavy 
body, 
DB, 
is 
supported. 
It 
remains 
now 
only 
to 
show 
that 
these 
distances 
bear 
to 
each 
other 
the 
inverse 
ratio 
of 
the 
weights 
themselves, 
that 
is, 
the 
distance 
GC 
is 
to 
the 
distance 
CF 
as 
the 
prism 
DB 
is 
to 
the 
prism 
DA 
— 
a 
proposition 
which 
we 
shall 
prove 
as 
follows: 
Since 
the 
line 
GE 
is 
the 
half 
of 
EH, 
and 
since 
EF 
is 
the 
half 
of 
EI, 
the 
whole 
length 
GF 
will 
be 
half 
of 
the 
entire 
line 
HI, 
and 
therefore 
equal 
to 
CI: 
if 
now 
we 
subtract 
the 
common 
part 
CF 
the 
remainder 
GC 
will 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
remainder 
FI, 
that 
is, 
to 
FE, 
and 
if 
to 
each 
of 
these 
we 
add 
CE 
we 
shall 
have 
GE 
equal 
to 
CF: 
hence 
GE:EF=FC:CG. 
But 
GE 
and 
EF 
bear 
the 
same 
ratio 
to 
each 
other 
as 
do 
their 
doubles 
HE 
and 
EI, 
that 
is, 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
prism 
AD 
to 
DB. 
Therefore, 
by 
equating 
ratios 
we 
have, 
convertendo, 
the 
distance 
GCis 
to 
the 
distance 
CF 
as 
the 
weight 
BD 
is 
to 
the 
weight 
DA, 
which 
is 
what 


Idesiredtoprove.
This 
principle 
established, 
I 
desire, 
before 
passing 
to 
any 
other 
subject, 
to 
call 
your 
attention 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
these 
forces, 
resistances, 
moments, 
figures, 
etc., 
may 
be 
considered 
either 
in 
the 
abstract, 
dissociated 
from 
matter, 
or 
in 
the 
concrete, 
associated 
with 
matter. 
Hence 
the 
properties 
which 
belong 
to 
figures 
that 
are 
merely 
geometrical 
and 
non-material 
must 
be 
modified 
when 
we 
fill 
these 
figures 
with 
matter 
and 
therefore 
give 
them 
weight. 
Take, 
for 
example, 
the 
lever 
BA 
which, 
resting 
upon 
the 
support 
E, 
is 
used 
to 
lift 
a 
heavy 
stone 
D. 
The 
principle 
just 
demonstrated 
makes 
it 
clear 
that 
a 
force 
appliedattheextremityBwilljustsufficeto 
equilibratetheresistanceoffered 
by 
the 
heavy 
body 
D 
provided 
this 
force 
[momento] 
bears 
to 
the 
force 
[momento] 
at 
D 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
distance 
AC 
bears 
to 
the 
distance 
CB; 
and 
this 
is 
true 
so 
long 
as 
we 
consider 
only 
the 
moments 
of 
the 
single 
force 
at 
B 
and 
of 
the 
resistance 
at 
D, 
treating 
the 
lever 
as 
an 
immaterial 
body 
devoid 
of 
weight. 
But 
if 
we 
take 
into 
account 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
lever 
itself 
— 
an 



instrument 
which 
may 
be 
made 
either 
of 
wood 
or 
of 
iron 
— 
it 
is 
manifest 
that, 
when 
this 
weight 
has 
been 
added 
to 
the 
force 
at 
B, 
the 
ratio 
will 
be 
changed 
and 
must 
therefore 
be 
expressed 
in 
different 
terms. 
Hence 
before 
going 
further 
let 
us 
agree 
to 
distinguish 
between 
these 
two 
points 
of 
view; 
when 
we 
consider 
an 
instrument 
in 
the 
abstract, 
i. 
e., 
apart 
from 
the 
weight 
of 
its 
own 
material, 
we 
shall 
speak 
of 
“taking 
it 
in 
an 
absolute 
sense” 
[prendere 
assolutamente]; 
but 
if 
we 
fill 
one 
of 
these 
simple 
and 
absolute 
figures 
with 
matter 
and 
thus 
give 
it 
weight, 
we 
shall 
refer 
to 
such 
a 
material 
figure 
as 
a 


“moment”or“compoundforce”[momentooforzacomposta].

I 
must 
break 
my 
resolution 
about 
not 
leading 
you 
off 
into 
a 
digression; 
for 
I 
cannot 
concentrate 
my 
attention 
upon 
what 
is 
to 
follow 
until 
a 
certain 
doubt 
is 
removed 
from 
my 
mind, 
namely, 
you 
seem 
to 
compare 
the 
force 
at 
B 
with 
the 
total 
weight 
of

Salv. 
I 
understand 
perfectly: 
you 
need 
go 
no 
further. 
However 
please 
observe 
that 
I 
have 
not 
mentioned 
the 
total 
weight 
of 
the 
stone; 
I 
spoke 
only 
of 
its 
force[momento] 
at 
the 
point 
A, 
the 
extremity 
of 
the 
lever 
BA, 
which 
force 
is 
always 
less 
than 
the 
total 
weight 
of 
the 
stone, 
and 
varies 
with 
its 
shape 
and 
elevation. 


Sagr. 
Good: 
but 
there 
occurs 
to 
me 
another 
question 
about 
which 
I 
am 
curious. 
For 
a 
complete 
understanding 
of 
this 
matter, 
I 
should 
like 
you 
to 
show 
me, 
if 
possible, 
how 
one 
can 
determine 
what 
part 
of 
the 
total 
weight 
is 
supportedbytheunderlyingplaneandwhat 
partbytheendAofthe 
lever. 


Salv. 
The 
explanation 
will 
not 
delay 
us 
long 
and 
I 
shall 
therefore 
have 
pleasure 
in 
granting 
your 
request. 
In 
the 
accompanying 
figure, 
let 
us 
understand 
that 
the 
weight 
having 
its 
center 
of 
gravity 
at 
A 
rests 
with 
the 
end 



B 
upon 
the 
horizontal 
plane 
and 
with 
the 
other 
end 
upon 
the 
lever 
CG. 
Let 
N 
be 
the 
fulcrum 
of 
a 
lever 
to 
which 
the 
force 
[potenza] 
is 
applied 
at 
G. 
Let 
fall 
the 
perpendiculars, 
AO 
and 
CF, 
from 
the 
center 
A 
and 
the 
end 
C. 
Then 
I 
say, 
the 
magnitude 
[momento] 
of 
the 
entire 
weight 
bears 
to 
the 
magnitude 
of 
the 
force 
[momento 
della 
potenza] 
at 
G 
a 
ratio 
compounded 
of 
the 
ratio 
between 
the 
two 
distances 
GN 
and 
NC 
and 
the 
ratio 
between 
FB 
and 
BO. 
Lay 
off 
a 
distance 
X 
such 
that 
its 
ratio 
to 
NC 
is 
the 
same 
as 
that 
of 
BO 
to 
FB; 
then, 
since 
the 
total 
weight 
A 
is 
counterbalanced 
by 
the 
two 
forces 
at 
B 
and 
at 
C, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
force 
at 
B 
is 
to 
that 
at 
C 
as 
the 
distance 
FO 
is 
to 
the 
distance 
OB. 
Hence, 
componendo, 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
forces 
at 
B 
and 
C, 
that 
is, 
the 
total 
weightA[momento 
di 
tutto 
‘l 
peso 
A], 
is 
to 
the 
force 
at 
C 
as 
the 
line 
FB 
is 
to 
the 
line 
BO, 
that 
is, 
as 
NC 
is 
to 
X: 
but 
the 
force 
[momento 
della 
potenza] 
applied 
at 
C 
is 
to 
the 
force 
applied 
at 
G 
as 
the 
distance 
GN 
is 
to 
the 
distance 
NC; 
hence 
it 
follows, 
ex 
æquali 
in 
proportione 
perturbata,17 
that 
the 
entire 
weight 
A 
is 
to 
the 
force 
applied 
at 
G 
as 
the 
distance 
GN 
is 
to 
X. 
But 
the 
ratio 
of 
GN 
to 
X 
is 
compounded 
of 
the 
ratio 
of 
GN 
to 
NC 
and 
of 
NC 
to 
X, 
that 
is, 
of 
FB 
to 
BO; 
hence 
the 
weight 
A 
bears 
to 
the 
equilibrating 
force 
at 
G 
a 
ratio 
compoundedofthatofGNtoNCandofFBto 
BO:which 
wasto 
beproved.

Let 
us 
now 
return 
to 
our 
original 
subject; 
then, 
if 
what 
has 
hitherto 
been 
said 
isclear,itwillbe 
easilyunderstoodthat, 


PropositionI 


A 
prism 
or 
solid 
cylinder 
of 
glass, 
steel, 
wood 
or 
other 
breakable 
material 
which 
is 
capable 
of 
sustaining 
a 
very 
heavy 
weight 
when 
applied 
longitudinally 
is, 
as 
previously 
remarked, 
easily 
broken 
by 
the 
transverse 
application 
of 
a 
weight 
which 
may 
be 
much 
smaller 
in 
proportion 
as 
the 
length 
ofthecylinderexceedsitsthickness. 



Let 
us 
imagine 
a 
solid 
prism 
ABCD 
fastened 
into 
a 
wall 
at 
the 
end 
AB, 
and 
supporting 
a 
weight 
E 
at 
the 
other 
end; 
understand 
also 
that 
the 
wall 
is 
vertical 
and 
that 
the 
prism 
or 
cylinder 
is 
fastened 
at 
right 
angles 
to 
the 
wall. 
It 
is 
clear 
that, 
if 
the 
cylinder 
breaks, 
fracture 
will 
occur 
at 
the 
point 
B 
where 
the 
edge 
of 
the 
mortise 
acts 
as 
a 
fulcrum 
for 
the 
lever 
BC, 
to 
which 
the 
force 
is 
applied; 
the 
thickness 
of 
the 
solid 
BA 
is 
the 
other 
arm 
of 
the 
lever 
along 
which 
is 
located 
the 
resistance. 
This 
resistance 
opposes 
the 
separation 
of 
the 
part 
BD, 
lying 
outside 
the 
wall, 
from 
that 
portion 
lying 
inside. 
From 
the 
preceding, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
magnitude 
[momento] 
of 
the 
force 
applied 
at 
C 
bears 
to 
the 
magnitude 
[momento] 
of 
the 
resistance, 
found 
in 
the 
thickness 
of 
the 
prism, 
i. 
e., 
in 
the 
attachment 
of 
the 
base 
BA 
to 
its 
contiguous 
parts, 
the 
same 
ratio 
which 
the 
length 
CB 
bears 
to 
half 
the 
length 
BA; 
if 
now 
we 
define 
absolute 
resistance 
to 
fracture 
as 
that 
offered 
to 
a 
longitudinal 
pull 
(in 
which 
case 
the 
stretching 
force 
acts 
in 
the 
same 
direction 
as 
that 
through 
which 
the 
body 
is 
moved),then 
itfollows 
that 
the 
absolute 
resistanceofthe 
prism 
BD 
is 
to 
the 
breaking 
load 
placed 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
lever 
BC 
in 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
length 
BC 
is 
to 
the 
half 
of 
AB 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
prism, 
or 
the 
semidiameter 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
cylinder. 
This 
is 
our 
first 
proposition.18 
Observe 
that 
in 
what 
has 
here 
been 
said 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
solid 
BD 
itself 
has 
been 
left 
out 
of 
consideration, 
or 
rather, 
the 
prism 
has 
been 
assumed 
to 
be 
devoid 
of 
weight. 
But 
if 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
prism 
is 
to 
be 
taken 
account 
of 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
weight 
E, 
we 
must 
add 
to 
the 
weight 
E 
one 
half 
that 
of 
the 
prism 
BD: 
so 
that 
if, 
for 
example, 
the 
latter 
weighs 
two 
pounds 
and 
the 
weight 
E 
is 
ten 
poundswemust 
treatthe 
weightEas

The 
one 
fundamental 
error 
which 
is 
implicitly 
introduced 
into 
this 
proposition 
and 
which 
is 
carried 
through 
the 
entire 
discussion 
of 
the 
Second 
Day 
consists 
in 
a 
failure 
to 
see 
that, 
in 
such 
a 
beam, 
there 
must 
be 
equilibrium 
between 
the 
forces 
of 
tension 
and 
compression 
over 
any 
cross-section. 
The 
correct 
point 
of 
view 
seems 
first 
to 
have 
been 
found 
by 
E. 
Mariotte 
in 
1680 
and 
by 
A. 
Parent 
in 
1713. 
Fortunately 
this 
error 
does 
not 
vitiate 
the 
conclusions 
of 
the 
subsequent 
propositions 
which 
deal 
only 
with 
proportions 
— 
not 
actual 
strength 
— 
of 
beams. 
Following 
K. 
Pearson 
(Todhunter’s 
History 
of 
Elasticity) 
one 
might 
say 
that 
Galileo’s 
mistake 
lay 
in 
supposing 
the 
fibres 
of 
the 
strained 
beam 
to 
be 
inextensible. 
Or,confessingtheanachronism, 
one 
might 
say 
that 
the 
errorconsistedintakingthelowest 
fibreof 
the 
beamastheneutral 
axis.

Simp. 
Why 
not 
twelve? 


Salv. 
The 
weight 
E, 
my 
dear 
Simplicio, 
hanging 
at 
the 
extreme 
end 
C 
acts 
upon 
the 
lever 
BC 
with 
its 
full 
moment 
of 
ten 
pounds: 
so 
also 
would 
the 
solid 



BD 
if 
suspended 
at 
the 
same 
point 
exert 
its 
full 
moment 
of 
two 
pounds; 
but, 
as 
you 
know, 
this 
solid 
is 
uniformly 
distributed 
throughout 
its 
entire 
length, 
BC, 
so 
that 
the 
parts 
which 
lie 
near 
the 
end 
B 
are 
less 
effective 
than 
those 
moreremote. 



Accordingly 
if 
we 
strike 
a 
balance 
between 
the 
two, 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
entire 
prism 
may 
be 
considered 
as 
concentrated 
at 
its 
center 
of 
gravity 
which 
lies 
midway 
of 
the 
lever 
BC. 
But 
a 
weight 
hung 
at 
the 
extremity 
C 
exerts 
a 
moment 
twice 
as 
great 
as 
it 
would 
if 
suspended 
from 
the 
middle: 
therefore 
if 
we 
consider 
the 
moments 
of 
both 
as 
located 
at 
the 
end 
C 
we 
must 
add 
to 
the 
weightEone-halfthatoftheprism. 


Simp. 
I 
understand 
perfectly; 
and 
moreover, 
if 
I 
mistake 
not, 
the 
force 
of 
the 
two 
weights 
BD 
and 
E, 
thus 
disposed, 
would 
exert 
the 
same 
moment 
as 



would 
the 
entire 
weight 
BD 
together 
with 
twice 
the 
weight 
E 
suspended 
at 
themiddleoftheleverBC. 


Salv. 
Precisely 
so, 
and 
a 
fact 
worth 
remembering. 
Now 
we 
can 
readily 
understand 


PropositionII 


How 
and 
in 
what 
proportion 
a 
rod, 
or 
rather 
a 
prism, 
whose 
width 
is 
greater 
than 
its 
thickness 
offers 
more 
resistance 
to 
fracture 
when 
the 
force 
is 
applied 
inthedirection 
ofitsbreadththan 
inthedirectionofits 
thickness. 



For 
the 
sake 
of 
clearness, 
take 
a 
ruler 
ad 
whose 
width 
is 
ac 
and 
whose 
thickness, 
cb, 
is 
much 
less 
than 
its 
width. 
The 
question 
now 
is 
why 
will 
the 
ruler, 
if 
stood 
on 
edge, 
as 
in 
the 
first 
figure, 
withstand 
a 
great 
weight 
T, 
while, 
when 
laid 
flat, 
as 
in 
the 
second 
figure, 
it 
will 
not 
support 
the 
weight 
X 
which 
is 
less 
than 
T. 
The 
answer 
is 
evident 
when 
we 
remember 
that 
in 
the 
one 
case 
the 
fulcrum 
is 
at 
the 
line 
bc, 
and 
in 
the 
other 
case 
at 
ca, 
while 
the 
distance 
at 
which 
the 
force 
is 
applied 
is 
the 
same 
in 
both 
cases, 
namely, 
the 
length 
bd: 
but 
in 
the 
first 
case 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
resistance 
from 
the 
fulcrum 


— 
half 
the 
line 
ca 
— 
is 
greater 
than 
in 
the 
other 
case 
where 
it 
is 
only 
half 
of 
bc. 
Therefore 
the 
weight 
T 
is 
greater 
than 
X 
in 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
half 
the 
width 
ca 
is 
greater 
than 
half 
the 
thickness 
bc, 
since 
the 
former 
acts 
as 
a 
lever 

arm 
for 
ca, 
and 
the 
latter 
for 
cb, 
against 
the 
same 
resistance, 
namely, 
the 
strength 
of 
all 
the 
fibres 
in 
the 
cross-section 
ab. 
We 
conclude, 
therefore, 
that 
any 
given 
ruler, 
or 
prism, 
whose 
width 
exceeds 
its 
thickness, 
will 
offer 
greater 
resistance 
to 
fracture 
when 
standing 
on 
edge 
than 
when 
lying 
flat, 
and 
this 
intheratioof 
thewidthto 
the 
thickness. 


PropositionIII 


Considering 
now 
the 
case 
of 
a 
prism 
or 
cylinder 
growing 
longer 
in 
a 
horizontal 
direction, 
we 
must 
find 
out 
in 
what 
ratio 
the 
moment 
of 
its 
own 
weight 
increases 
in 
comparison 
with 
its 
resistance 
to 
fracture. 
This 
moment 
I 
find 
increases 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
square 
of 
the 
length. 
In 
order 
to 
prove 
this 
let 
AD 
be 
a 
prism 
or 
cylinder 
lying 
horizontal 
with 
its 
end 
A 
firmly 
fixed 
in 
a 
wall. 
Let 
the 
length 
of 
the 
prism 
be 
increased 
by 
the 
addition 
of 
the 
portion 
BE. 
It 
is 
clear 
that 
merely 
changing 
the 
length 
of 
the 
lever 
from 
AB 
to 
AC 
will, 
if 
we 
disregard 
its 
weight, 
increase 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
force 
[at 
the 
end] 
tending 
to 
produce 
fracture 
at 
A 
in 
the 
ratio 
of 
CA 
to 
BA. 
But, 
besides 
this, 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
solid 
portion 
BE, 
added 
to 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
solid 
AB 
increases 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
total 
weight 
in 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
prism 
AE 
to 
that 
of 
the 
prism 
AB, 
which 
is 
the 
same 
as 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
length 
ACtoAB. 


It 
follows, 
therefore, 
that, 
when 
the 
length 
and 
weight 
are 
simultaneously 
increased 
in 
any 
given 
proportion, 
the 
moment, 
which 
is 
the 
product 
of 
these 
two, 
is 
increased 
in 
a 
ratio 
which 
is 
the 
square 
of 
the 
preceding 
proportion. 
The 
conclusion 
is 
then 
that 
the 
bending 
moments 
due 
to 
the 
weight 
of 
prisms 
and 
cylinders 
which 
have 
the 
same 
thickness 
but 
different 
lengths, 
bear 
to 
each 
other 
a 
ratio 
which 
is 
the 
square 
of 
the 
ratio 
of 
their 
lengths, 
or, 
what 
is 
thesamething,theratioof 
thesquares 
oftheirlengths. 


We 
shall 
next 
show 
in 
what 
ratio 
the 
resistance 
to 
fracture 
[bending 
strength], 
in 
prisms 
and 
cylinders, 
increases 
with 
increase 
of 
thickness 
while 
thelengthremainsunchanged. 
HereIsaythat 



PropositionIV 


In 
prisms 
and 
cylinders 
of 
equal 
length, 
but 
of 
unequal 
thicknesses, 
the 
resistancetofractureincreasesinthesameratioasthecubeofthediameterof 
thethickness,i. 
e.,ofthebase. 



Fromtheprecedingwe 
are 
abletoconclude 
that 


Corollary 


The 
resistance 
[strength] 
of 
a 
prism 
or 
cylinder 
of 
constant 
length 
varies 
in 
thesesquialteral 
ratio 
ofitsvolume. 


This 
is 
evident 
because 
the 
volume 
of 
a 
prism 
or 
cylinder 
of 
constant 
altitude 
varies 
directly 
as 
the 
area 
of 
its 
base, 
i. 
e., 
as 
the 
square 
of 
a 
side 
or 
diameter 
of 
this 
base; 
but, 
as 
just 
demonstrated, 
the 
resistance 
[strength] 
varies 
as 
the 
cube 
of 
this 
same 
side 
or 
diameter. 
Hence 
the 
resistance 
varies 
in 
the 
sesquialteral 
ratio 
of 
the 
volume 
— 
consequently 
also 
of 
the 
weight 
— 
ofthesoliditself. 


Simp. 
Before 
proceeding 
further 
I 
should 
like 
to 
have 
one 
of 
my 
difficulties 
removed. 
Up 
to 
this 
point 
you 
have 
not 
taken 
into 
consideration 
a 
certain 
otherkindofresistance 
which,itappearstome,diminishesasthesolid 
grows 
longer, 
and 
this 
is 
quite 
as 
true 
in 
the 
case 
of 
bending 
as 
in 
pulling; 
it 
is 
preciselythusthatin 
the 
caseofaropeweobservethataverylongoneisless 
able 
to 
support 
a 
large 
weight 
than 
a 
short 
one. 
Whence, 
I 
believe, 
a 
short 
rod 
of 
wood 
or 
iron 
will 
support 
a 
greater 
weight 
than 
if 
it 
were 
long, 
provided 
the 
force 
be 
always 
applied 
longitudinally 
and 
not 
transversely, 
and 
provided 



also 
that 
we 
take 
into 
account 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
rope 
itself 
which 
increases 
withits 
length. 


Salv. 
Ifear,Simplicio,ifIcorrectlycatchyourmeaning,thatinthis 
particular 
you 
are 
making 
the 
same 
mistake 
as 
many 
others; 
that 
is 
if 
you 
mean 
to 
say 
that 
a 
long 
rope, 
one 
of 
perhaps 
40 
cubits, 
cannot 
hold 
up 
so 
great 
a 
weight 
as 
a 
shorterlength, 
say 
oneor 
twocubits,of 
thesamerope. 
Simp. 
That 
is 
what 
I 
meant, 
and 
as 
far 
as 
I 
see 
the 
proposition 
is 
highly 
probable. 


Salv. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
I 
consider 
it 
not 
merely 
improbable 
but 
false; 
and 
I 
think 
I 
can 
easily 
convince 
you 
of 
your 
error. 
Let 
AB 
represent 
the 
rope, 
fastened 
at 
the 
upperendA: 
at 
the 
lower 
endattach 
aweight 
C 
whose 
force 
is 
just 
sufficient 
to 
break 
the 
rope. 
Now, 
Simplicio, 
point 
out 
the 
exact 
place 
where 
youthinkthebreakoughttooccur. 


Let 
ussayD. 


Salv. 
Andwhy 
atD? 


Simp. 
Because 
at 
this 
point 
the 
rope 
is 
not 
strong 
enough 
to 
support, 
say, 
100 
pounds,

Accordingly

stretched 
[violentata] 
with 
the 
weight 
of100poundsatDitwillbreakthere. 


Simp. 
Ithinkso. 


Salv. 
But 
tell 
me, 
if 
instead 
of 
attaching 
the 
weight 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
rope, 
B, 
one 
fastens 
it 
at 
a 
point 
nearer 
D, 
say, 
at 
E: 
or 
if, 
instead 
of 
fixing 
the 
upper 
end 
of 
the 
rope 
at 
A, 
one 
fastens 
it 
at

Let

therefore 
suppose 
that 
the 
rope 
is 
stretched 
at 
the

D 
with 
a 
weight 
of 
100 
pounds, 
then 
according 
to 
your 
own 
admission 
it 
will 
break; 
but 
FE 
is 
only 
a 
small 
portion 
of 
AB; 
how 
can 
you 
therefore 
maintain 
that 
the 



long 
rope 
is 
weaker 
than 
the 
short 
one? 
Give 
up 
then 
this 
erroneous 
view 
which

Now 
having 
demonstrated 
that, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
[uniformly 
loaded] 
prisms 
and 
cylinders 
of 
constant 
thickness, 
the 
moment 
of 
force 
tending 
to 
produce 
fracture 
[momento 
sopra 
le 
proprie 
resistenze] 
varies 
as 
the 
square 
of 
the 
length; 
and 
having 
likewise 
shown 
that, 
when 
the 
length 
is 
constant 
and 
the 
thickness 
varies, 
the 
resistance 
to 
fracture 
varies 
as 
the 
cube 
of 
the 
side, 
or 
diameter, 
of 
the 
base, 
let 
us 
pass 
to 
the 
investigation 
of 
the 
case 
of 
solids 


whichsimultaneouslyvaryinbothlengthandthickness.HereIobservethat,
Proposition 
V 


Prisms 
and

which

in 
both

and

offer

[i.

proportional 
to 
the 
cubes 
of 
the 
diameters 
of 
their 
bases 
and 
inversely 
proportionaltotheirlengths. 



This 
proposition 
having 
been 
demonstrated, 
let 
us 
next 
consider 
the 
case 
of 
prisms 
and 
cylinders 
which 
are 
similar. 
Concerning 
these 
we 
shall 
show 
that, 


PropositionhiVI 


In 
the 
case 
of 
similar 
cylinders 
and 
prisms, 
the 
moments 
[stretching 
forces] 
which 
result 
from 
multiplying 
together 
their 
weight 
and 
length 
[i. 
e., 
from 
the 
moments 
produced 
by 
their 
own 
weight 
and 
length], 
which 
latter 
acts 
as 
a 
lever-arm, 
bear 
to 
each 
other 
a 
ratio 
which 
is 
the 
sesquialteral 
of 
the 
ratio 
between 
theresistancesoftheirbases. 



In 
order 
to 
prove 
this 
let 
us 
indicate 
the 
two 
similar 
cylinders 
by 
AB 
and 
CD: 
then 
the 
magnitude 
of 
the 
force 
[momento] 
in 
the 
cylinder 
AB, 
opposing 
the 
resistance 
of 
its 
base 
B, 
bears 
to 
the 
magnitude 
[momento] 
of 
the 
force 
at 
CD, 
opposing 
the 
resistance 
of 
its 
base 
D, 
a 
ratio 
which 
is 
the 
sesquialteral 
of 
theratiobetween 
theresistanceof 
the 
baseBandtheresistanceofthebaseD. 
And 
since 
the 
solids 
AB 
and 
CD, 
are 
effective 
in 
opposing 
the 
resistances 
of 
their 
bases 
B 
and 
D, 
in 
proportion 
to 
their 
weights 
and 
to 
the 
mechanical 
advantages 
[forze] 
of 
their 
lever 
arms 
respectively, 
and 
since 
the 
advantage 
[forza] 
of 
the 
lever 
arm 
AB 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
advantage 
[forza] 
of 
the 
lever 
arm 
CD 
(this 
is 
true 
because 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
similarity 
of 
the 
cylinders 
the 
length 
AB 
is 
to 
the 
radius 
of 
the 
base 
B 
as 
the 
length 
CD 
is 
to 
the 
radius 
of 
the 
base 
D), 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
total 
force 
[momento] 
of 
the 
cylinder 
AB 
is 
to 
the 
total 
force[momento] 
of 
the 
cylinder 
CD 
as 
the 
weight 
alone 
of 
the 
cylinder 
AB 
is 
to 
the 
weight 
alone 
of 
the 
cylinder 
CD, 
that 
is, 
as 
the

of 
the 
cylinder 
AB[l’istesso

is 
to 
the

CD 
[all’istesso

but 
these 
are 
as 
the

of 
the

their

and 
the

of

The 
preceding 
paragraph 
beginning 
with 
Prop. 
VI 
is 
of 
more 
than 
usual 
interest 
as 
illustrating 
the 
confusion 
of 
terminology 
current 
in 
the

This

strikes 
me 
asbothnewand 
surprising: 
at 
first 
glance 
it 
is 
very 
different 
from 
anything 
which 
I 
myself 
should 
have 
guessed: 
for 
since 
these 
figures 
are 
similar 
in 
all 
other 
respects, 
I 
should 
have 
certainly 
thought 
that 
the 
forces 
[momenti] 
and 
the 
resistances 
of 
these 
cylinders 
would 
have 
bornetoeachotherthesameratio.

This 
is 
the 
proof 
of 
the 
proposition 
to 
which 
I 
referred, 
at 
the 
very 
beginningofourdiscussion,asone 
imperfectly 
understoodbyme. 


Salv. 
For 
a 
while, 
Simplicio, 
I 
used 
to 
think, 
as 
you 
do, 
that 
the 
resistances 
of 
similar 
solids 
were 
similar; 
but 
a 
certain 
casual 
observation 
showed 
me 
that 
similar 
solids 
do 
not 
exhibit 
a 
strength 
which 
is 
proportional 
to 
their 
size, 
the 
larger 
ones 
being 
less 
fitted 
to 
undergo 
rough 
usage 
just 
as 
tall 
men 
are 
more 
apt 
than 
small 
children 
to 
be 
injured 
by 
a 
fall. 
And, 
as 
we 
remarked 
at 
the 
outset, 
a 
large 
beam 
or 
column 
falling 
from 
a 
given 
height 
will 
go 
to 
pieces 
when 
under 
the 
same 
circumstances 
a 
small 
scantling 
or 
small 
marble 
cylinder 
will 
not 
break. 
It 
was 
this 
observation 
which 
led 
me 
to 
the 
investigation 
of 
the 
fact 
which 
I 
am 
about 
to 
demonstrate 
to 
you: 
it 
is 
a 
very 
remarkable 
thing 
that, 
among 
the 
infinite 
variety 
of 
solids 
which 
are 
similar 
one 
to 
another, 
there 
are 
no 
two 
of 
which 
the 
forces 
[momenti], 
and 
the 
resistancesofthesesolids 
arerelated 
inthesameratio. 
Simp. 
You 
remind 
me 
now 
of 
a 
passage 
in 
Aristotle’s 
Questionsin 
Mechanics 
in 
which 
he 
tries 
to 
explain 
why 
it 
is 
that 
a 
wooden 
beam 
becomes 
weaker 
and 
can 
be 
more 
easily 
bent 
as 
it 
grows 
longer, 
notwithstanding 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
shorter 
beam 
is 
thinner 
and 
the 
longer 
one 
thicker: 
and, 
if 
I 
remember 
correctly,he 
explainsitintermsofthesimple 
lever. 


Salv. 
Very 
true: 
but, 
since 
this 
solution 
seemed 
to 
leave 
room 
for 
doubt, 
BishopdiGuevara,20 
whosetrulylearnedcommentarieshavegreatly

nevertheless 
even 
he 
is 
confused 
as 
regards 
this 
particular 
point, 
namely, 
whether, 
when 
the 
length 
and 
thickness 
of 
these 
solid 
figures 
increase 
in 
the

ratio, 
their 
strength 
and

as 
well 
as 
to 
bending, 
remain 
constant.

PropositionVII 


Among 
heavy 
prisms 
and 
cylinders 
of 
similar 
figure, 
there 
is 
one 
and 
only 
one 
which 
under 
the 
stress 
of 
its 
own 
weight 
lies 
just 
on 
the 
limit 
between 
breaking 
and 
not 
breaking: 
so 
that 
every 
larger 
one 
is 
unable 
to 
carry 
the 
load 
of 
its 
own 
weight 
and 
breaks; 
while 
every 
smaller 
one 
is 
able 
to 
withstand 
someadditionalforcetendingtobreakit. 


Let 
AB 
be 
a 
heavy 
prism, 
the 
longest 
possible 
that 
will 
just 
sustain 
its 
own 
weight, 
so 
that 
if 
it 
be 
lengthened 
the 
least 
bit 
it 
will 
break. 
Then, 
I 
say, 
this 
prism 
is 
unique 
among 
all 
similar 
prisms 
— 
infinite 
in 
number 
— 
in 
occupying 
that 
boundary 
line 
between 
breaking 
and 
not 
breaking; 
so 
that 
every 
larger 
one 
will 
break 
under 
its 
own 
weight, 
and 
every 
smaller 
one 
will 
not 
break, 
but 
will 
be 
able 
to 
withstand 
some 
force 
in 
addition 
to 
its 
own 
weight. 


Let 
the 
prism 
CE 
be 
similar 
to, 
but 
larger 
than, 
AB: 
then, 
I 
say, 
it 
will 
not 
remain 
intact 
but 
will 
break 
under 
its 
own 
weight. 
Lay 
off 
the 
portion 
CD, 
equal 
in 
length 
to 
AB. 
And, 
since, 
the 
resistance 
[bending 
strength] 
of 
CD 
is 
to 
that 
of 
AB 
as 
the 
cube 
of 
the 
thickness 
of 
CD 
is 
to 
the 
cube 
of 
the 
thickness 
ofAB, 
that 
is, 
as 
the 
prismCEistothesimilar 
prismAB, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
weight 
of 
CE 
is 
the 
utmost 
load 
which 
a 
prism 
of 
the 
length 
CD 
can 
sustain; 
but 
the 
length 
of 
CE 
is 
greater; 
therefore 
the 
prism 
CE 
will 
break. 
Now 
take 
another 
prism 
FG 
which 
is 
smaller 
than 
AB. 
Let 
FH 
equal 
AB, 
then 
it 
can 
be 
shown 
in 
a 
similar 
manner 
that 
the 
resistance 
[bending 
strength] 
of 
FG 
is 
to 
that 
of 
AB 
as 
the 
prism 
FG 
is 
to 
the 
prism 
AB 
provided 
the 
distance 
AB 
that 
is 
FH, 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
distance 
FG; 
but 
AB 
is 
greater 
than 
FG, 
and 
therefore 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
prism 
FG 
applied 
at 
G 
is 
not 
sufficient 
tobreaktheprismFG. 



Sagr. 
The 
demonstration 
is 
short 
and 
clear; 
while 
the 
proposition 
which, 
at 
first 
glance, 
appeared 
improbable 
is 
now 
seen 
to 
be 
both 
true 
and 
inevitable. 
In 
order 
therefore 
to 
bring 
this 
prism 
into 
that 
limiting 
condition 
which 
separates 
breaking 
from 
not 
breaking, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
change 
the 
ratio 
between 
thickness 
and 
length 
either 
by 
increasing 
the 
thickness 
or 
by 
diminishing 
the 
length. 
An 
investigation 
of 
this 
limiting 
state 
will, 
I 
believe, 
demandequalingenuity. 


Salv. 
Nay, 
even 
more; 
for 
the 
question 
is 
more 
difficult; 
this 
I 
know 
because 
I 
spent 
no 
small 
amount 
of 
time 
in 
its 
discovery 
which 
I 
now 
wish 
to 
share 
withyou. 


PropositionVIII 


Given 
a 
cylinder 
or 
prism 
of 
the 
greatest 
length 
consistent 
with 
its 
not 
breaking 
under 
its 
own 
weight; 
and 
having 
given 
a 
greater 
length, 
to 
find 
the 
diameter 
of 
another 
cylinder 
or 
prism 
of 
this 
greater 
length 
which 
shall 
be 
the 
onlyandlargestonecapableofwithstandingitsown 
weight. 


Let 
BC 
be 
the 
largest 
cylinder 
capable 
of 
sustaining 
its 
own 
weight; 
and 
let 
DE 
be 
a 
length 
greater 
than 
AC: 
the 
problem 
is 
to 
find 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
cylinder 
which, 
having 
the 
length 
DE, 
shall 
be 
the 
largest 
one 
just 
able 
to 
withstand 
its 
own 
weight. 
Let 
I 
be 
a 
third 
proportional 
to 
the 
lengths 
DE 
and 



AC; 
let 
the 
diameter 
FD 
be 
to 
the 
diameter 
BA 
as 
DE 
is 
to 
I; 
draw 
the 
cylinder 
FE; 
then, 
among 
all 
cylinders 
having 
the 
same 
proportions, 
this 
is 
thelargestandonlyonejustcapable 
ofsustainingitsown 
weight. 


Let 
M 
be 
a 
third 
proportional 
to 
DE 
and 
I: 
also 
let 
O 
be 
a 
fourth 
proportional 
to 
DE, 
I, 
and 
M; 
lay 
off 
FG 
equal 
to 
AC. 
Now 
since 
the 
diameter 
FD 
is 
to 
the 
diameter 
AB 
as 
the 
length 
DE 
is 
to 
I, 
and 
since 
O 
is 
a 
fourth 
proportional 
to 
DE, 
I 
and 
M, 
it 
follows 
that 
:=DE:O. 
But 
the 
resistance 
[bending 
strength] 
of 
the 
cylinder 
DG 
is 
to 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
cylinder 
BC 
as 
the 
cube 
of 
FD 
is 
to 
the 
cube 
of 
BA: 
hence 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
cylinder 
DG 
is 
to 
that 
of 
cylinder 
BC 
as 
the 
length 
DE 
is 
to 
O. 
And 
since 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
cylinder 
BC 
is 
held 
in 
equilibrium 
by 
[è 
equale 
alla] 
its 
resistance, 
we 
shall 
accomplish 
our 
end 
(which 
is 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
cylinder 
FE 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
resistance 
located 
at 
FD), 
if 
we 
show 
that 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
cylinder 
FE 
is 
to 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
cylinder 
BC 
as 
the 
resistance 
DF 
is 
to 
the 
resistance 
BA, 
that 
is, 
as 
the 
cube 
of 
FD 
is 
to 
the 
cube 
of 
BA, 
or 
as 
the 
length 
DE 
is 
to 
O. 
The 
moment 
of 
the 
cylinder 
FE 
is 
to 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
cylinder 
DG 
as 
the 
square 
of 
DE 
is 
to 
the 
square 
of 
AC, 
that 
is, 
as 
the 
length 
DE 
is 
to 
I; 
but 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
cylinder 
DG 
is 
to 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
cylinder 
BC, 
as 
the 
square 
of 
DF 
is 
to 
the 
square 
of 
BA, 
that 
is, 
as 
the 
square 
of 
DE 
is 
to 
the 
square 
of 
I, 
or 
as 
the 
square 
of 
I 
is 
to 
the 
square 
of 
M, 
or, 
as 
I 
is 
to 
O. 
Therefore 
by 
equating 
ratios, 
it 
results 
that 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
cylinder 
FE 
is 
to 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
cylinder 
BC 
as 
the 
length 
DE 
is 
to 
O, 
that 
is, 
as 
the 
cube 
of 
DF 
is 
to 
the 
cube 
of 
BA, 
or 
as 
the 
resistance 
of 
the

the

given 
so 
that 
I 
may 
study 
it 
atmyleisure. 


Salv. 
I 
shall 
gladly 
do 
so. 
Let 
A 
denote 
a 
cylinder 
of 
diameter 
DC 
and 
the 
largest 
capable 
of 
sustaining 
its 
own 
weight: 
the 
problem 
is 
to 
determine 
a 
larger 
cylinder 
which 
shall 
be 
at 
once 
the 
maximum 
and 
the 
unique 
one 
capableofsustainingitsownweight. 


Let 
E 
be 
such 
a 
cylinder, 
similar 
to 
A, 
having 
the 
assigned 
length, 
and 
having 
a 
diameter 
KL. 
Let 
MN 
be 
a 
third 
proportional 
to 
the 
two 
lengths 
DC 
and 
KL: 
let 
MN 
also 
be 
the 
diameter 
of 
another 
cylinder, 
X, 
having 
the 
same 
length 
as 
E: 
then, 
I 
say, 
X 
is 
the 
cylinder 
sought. 
Now 
since 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
base 
DC 
is 
to 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
base 
KL 
as 
the 
square 
of 
DC 
is 
to 
the 
square 
of 
KL, 
that 
is, 
as 
the 
square 
of 
KL 
is 
to 
the 
square 
of 
MN, 
or, 
as 
the 
cylinder 
E 
is 
to 
the 
cylinder 
X, 
that 
is, 
as 
the 
moment 
E 
is 
to 
the 
moment 
X; 



and 
since 
also 
the 
resistance 
[bending 
strength] 
of 
the 
base 
KL 
is 
to 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
base 
MN 
as 
the 
cube 
of 
KL 
is 
to 
the 
cube 
of 
MN, 
that 
is, 
as 
the 
cube 
of 
DC 
is 
to 
the 
cube 
of 
KL, 
or, 
as 
the 
cylinder 
A 
is 
to 
the 
cylinder 
E, 
that 
is, 
as 
the 
moment 
of 
A 
is 
to 
the 
moment 
of 
E; 
hence 
it 
follows, 
ex

in 
proportione

that 
the 
moment 
of 
A 
is 
to 
the 
moment 
of 
X 
as 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
base 
DC 
is 
to 
the 
resistance 
of 
the

therefore 
moment

Let 
usnow 
generalizetheproblem;then 
itwillreadasfollows: 


Given 
a 
cylinder 
AC 
in 
which 
moment 
and 
resistance 
[bending 
strength] 
are 
related 
in 
any 
manner 
whatsoever; 
let 
DE 
be 
the 
length 
of 
another 
cylinder; 
then 
determine 
what 
its 
thickness 
must 
be 
in 
order 
that 
the 
relation 



between 
its 
moment 
and 
resistance 
shall 
be 
identical 
with 
that 
of 
the 
cylinder 
AC. 


Using 
Fig. 
25 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
above, 
we 
may 
say 
that, 
since 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
cylinder 
FE 
is 
to 
the 
moment 
of 
the

DG 
as 
the

the

that 
is, 
as 
the

DE 
is

and 
since 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
cylinder 
FG 
is 
to 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
cylinder 
AC 
as 
the

is

the

of 
AB, 
or, 
as 
the 
square 
of

is 
to 
the 
square 
of

or, 
as 
the 
square 
of 
I 
is 
to 
the 
square 
of 
M, 
that 
is, 
as 
the 
length 
I 
is 
to 
O; 
it 
follows, 
ex 
æquali, 
that 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
cylinder 
FE 
is 
to 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
cylinder 
AC 
as 
the

that

or, 
as

of

that

From 
what 
has 
already 
been 
demonstrated, 
you 
can 
plainly 
see 
the 
impossibility 
of 
increasing 
the 
size 
of 
structures 
to 
vast 
dimensions 
either 
in 
art 
or 
in 
nature; 
likewise 
the 
impossibility 
of 
building 
ships, 
palaces, 
or 
temples 
of 
enormous 
size 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
their 
oars, 
yards, 
beams, 
iron-
bolts, 
and, 
in 
short, 
all 
their 
other 
parts 
will 
hold 
together; 
nor 
can 
nature 
produce 
trees 
of 
extraordinary 
size 
because 
the 
branches 
would 
break 
down 
under 
their 
own 
weight; 
so 
also 
it 
would 
be 
impossible 
to 
build 
up 
the 
bony 
structures 
of 
men, 
horses, 
or 
other 
animals 
so 
as 
to 
hold 
together 
and 
perform 
their 
normal 
functions 
if 
these 
animals 
were 
to 
be 
increased 
enormously 
in 
height; 
for 
this 
increase 
in 
height 
can 
be 
accomplished 
only 
by 
employing 
a 
material 
which 
is 
harder 
and 
stronger 
than 
usual, 
or 
by 
enlarging 
the 
size 
of 
the 
bones, 
thus 
changing 
their 
shape 
until 
the 
form 
and 
appearance 
of 
the 
animals 
suggest 
a 
monstrosity. 
This 
is 
perhaps 
what 
our 
wise 
Poet 
had 
in 
mind,whenhe 
says,in 
describingahugegiant: 


“Impossibleit

Ariosto’s 
Orlando 
Furioso, 
XVII,30 
[Trans.] 


To 
illustrate 
briefly, 
I 
have 
sketched 
a 
bone 
whose 
natural 
length 
has 
been 
increased 
three 
times 
and 
whose 
thickness 
has 
been 
multiplied 
until, 
for 
a 
correspondingly 
large 
animal, 
it 
would 
perform 
the 
same 
function 
which 
the 



small 
bone 
performs 
for 
its 
small 
animal. 
From 
the 
figures 
here 
shown 
you 
can 
see 
how 
out 
of 
proportion 
the 
enlarged 
bone 
appears. 
Clearly 
then 
if 
one 
wishes 
to 
maintain 
in 
a 
great 
giant 
the 
same 
proportion 
of 
limb 
as 
that 
found 
in 
an 
ordinary 
man 
he 
must 
either 
find 
a 
harder 
and 
stronger 
material 
for 
making 
the 
bones, 
or 
he 
must 
admit 
a 
diminution 
of 
strength 
in 
comparison 
with 
men 
of 
medium 
stature; 
for 
if 
his 
height 
be 
increased 
inordinately 
he 
will 
fall 
and 
be 
crushed 
under 
his 
own 
weight. 
Whereas, 
if 
the 
size 
of 
a 
body 
be 
diminished, 
the 
strength 
of 
that 
body 
is 
not 
diminished 
in 
the 
same 
proportion; 
indeed 
the 
smaller 
the 
body 
the 
greater 
its 
relative 
strength. 
Thus 
a 
small 
dog 
could 
probably 
carry 
on 
his 
back 
two 
or 
three 
dogs 
of 
his 
own 


size;butIbelievethatahorsecouldnotcarryevenoneofhisownsize.
Simp. 
This 
may 
be 
so; 
but 
I 
am 
led 
to 
doubt 
it 
on 
account 
of 
the 
enormous 
size 
reached 
by 
certain 
fish, 
such 
as 
the 
whale 
which, 
I 
understand, 
is 
ten 
timesaslargeas 
an 
elephant;yettheyallsupportthemselves. 


Salv. 
Your 
question, 
Simplicio, 
suggests 
another 
principle, 
one 
which 
had 
hitherto 
escaped 
my 
attention 
and 
which 
enables 
giants 
and 
other 
animals 
of 
vast 
size 
to 
support 
themselves 
and 
to 
move 
about 
as 
well 
as 
smaller 
animals 
do. 
This 
result 
may 
be 
secured 
either 
by 
increasing 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
bones 



and 
other 
parts 
intended 
to 
carry 
not 
only 
their 
weight 
but 
also 
the 
superincumbent 
load; 
or, 
keeping 
the 
proportions 
of 
the 
bony 
structure 
constant, 
the 
skeleton 
will 
hold 
together 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
or 
even 
more 
easily, 
provided 
one 
diminishes, 
in 
the 
proper 
proportion, 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
bony 
material, 
of 
the 
flesh, 
and 
of 
anything 
else 
which 
the 
skeleton 
has 
to 
carry. 
It 
is 
this 
second 
principle 
which 
is 
employed 
by 
nature 
in 
the 
structure 
of 
fish, 
making 
their 
bones 
and 
muscles 
not 
merely 
light 
but 
entirely 
devoid 
ofweight. 


Simp. 
Thetrendofyour 
argument,Salviati,is 
evident. 
Since 
fishliveinwater 
which 
on 
account 
of 
its 
density 
[corpulenza] 
or, 
as 
others 
would 
say, 
heaviness 
[gravità] 
diminishes 
the 
weight 
[peso] 
of 
bodies 
immersed 
in 
it, 
you 
mean 
to 
say 
that, 
for 
this 
reason, 
the 
bodies 
of 
fish 
will 
be 
devoid 
of 
weight 
and 
will 
be 
supported 
without 
injury 
to 
their 
bones. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
all; 
for 
although 
the 
remainder 
of 
the 
body 
of 
the 
fish 
may 
be 
without 
weight, 
there 
can 
be 
no 
question 
but 
that 
their 
bones 
have 
weight. 
Take 
the 
case 
of 
a 
whale’s 
rib, 
having 
the 
dimensions 
of 
a 
beam; 
who 
can 
deny 
its 
great 
weight 
or 
its 
tendency 
to 
go 
to 
the 
bottom 
when 
placed 
in 
water? 
One 
would, 
therefore,hardlyexpectthesegreatmassestosustainthemselves. 


Salv. 
A 
very 
shrewd 
objection! 
And 
now, 
in 
reply, 
tell 
me 
whether 
you 
have 
ever 
seen 
fish 
stand 
motionless 
at 
will 
under 
water, 
neither 
descending 
to 
the 
bottomnorrisingtothetop,withouttheexertionofforcebyswimming? 


Simp. 
This 
isawell-knownphenomenon. 


Salv. 
The 
fact 
then 
that 
fish 
are 
able 
to 
remain 
motionless 
under 
water 
is 
a 
conclusive 
reason 
for 
thinking 
that 
the 
material 
of 
their 
bodies 
has 
the 
same 
specific 
gravity 
as 
that 
of 
water; 
accordingly, 
if 
in 
their 
make-up 
there 
are 
certain 
parts 
which 
are 
heavier 
than 
water 
there 
must 
be 
others 
which 
are 
lighter, 
for 
otherwise 
theywould 
notproduceequilibrium. 


Hence, 
if 
the 
bones 
are 
heavier, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
the 
muscles 
or 
other 
constituents 
of 
the 
body 
should 
be 
lighter 
in 
order 
that 
their 
buoyancy 
may 
counterbalance 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
bones. 
In 
aquatic 
animals 
therefore 
circumstances 
are 
just 
reversed 
from 
what 
they 
are 
with 
land 
animals 
inasmuch 
as, 
in 
the 
latter, 
the 
bones 
sustain 
not 
only 
their 
own 
weight 
but 
also 
that 
of 
the 
flesh, 
while 
in 
the 
former 
it 
is 
the 
flesh 
which 
supports 
not 



only 
its 
own 
weight 
but 
also 
that 
of 
the 
bones. 
We 
must 
therefore 
cease 
to 
wonder 
why 
these 
enormously 
large 
animals 
inhabit 
the 
water 
rather 
than 
the 
land, 
thatis 
tosay,theair. 


Simp. 
I 
am 
convinced 
and 
I 
only 
wish 
to 
add 
that 
what 
we 
call 
land 
animals 
ought 
really 
to 
be 
called 
air 
animals, 
seeing 
that 
they 
live 
in 
the 
air, 
are 
surrounded 
byair,andbreathe 
air. 


Sagr. 
I 
have 
enjoyed 
Simplicio’s 
discussion 
including 
both 
the 
question 
raised 
and 
its 
answer. 
Moreover 
I 
can 
easily 
understand 
that 
one 
of 
these 
giant 
fish, 
if 
pulled 
ashore, 
would 
not 
perhaps 
sustain 
itself 
for 
any 
great 
length 
of 
time, 
but 
would 
be 
crushed 
under 
its 
own 
mass 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
connectionsbetween 
the 
bonesgave 
way. 


Salv. 
I 
am 
inclined 
to 
your 
opinion; 
and, 
indeed, 
I 
almost 
think 
that 
the 
same 
thing 
would 
happen 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
very 
big 
ship 
which 
floats 
on 
the 
sea 
without 
going 
to 
pieces 
under 
its 
load 
of 
merchandise 
and 
armament, 
but 
which 
on 
dry 
land 
and 
in 
air 
would 
probably 
fall 
apart. 
But 
let 
us 
proceed 
and 
showhow: 


Given 
a 
prism 
or 
cylinder, 
also 
its 
own 
weight 
and 
the 
maximum 
load 
which 
itcancarry,it 
isthen 
possibletofindamaximumlengthbeyond 
which 
thecylinder 
cannotbeprolongedwithoutbreaking 
underits 
ownweight. 


Let 
ACindicateboth 
theprismanditsown 
weight; 
alsoletD 
representthe 
maximum 
load 
which 
the 
prism 
can 
carry 
at 
the 
end 
C 
without 
fracture; 
it 
is 
required 
to 
find 
the 
maximum 
to 
which 
the 
length 
of 
the 
said 
prism 
can 
be 
increased 
without 
breaking. 
Draw 
AH 
of 
such 
a 
length 
that 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
prism 
AC 
is 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
AC 
and 
twice 
the 
weight 
D 
as 
the 
length 
CA 
is 
to 
AH; 
and 
let 
AG 
be 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
CA 
and 
AH; 
then, 
I 
say, 
AG 
is 
the 
length 
sought. 
Since 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
weight 
[momento 
gravante]D 
attached 
at 
the 
point 
C 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
moment 
of 
a 
weight 
twice 
as 
large 
as 
D 
placed 
at 
the 
middle 
point 
AC, 
through 
which 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
prism 
AC 
acts, 
itfollows 
that 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
resistanceof 
theprism 
AC 
locatedat 
A 
is 
equivalent 
to 
twice 
the 
weight 
D 
plus 
the 
weight 
of 
AC, 
both 
acting 
through 
the 
middle 
point 
of 
AC. 
And 
since 
we 
have 
agreed 
that 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
weights 
thus 
located, 
namely, 
twice 
D 
plus 
AC, 
bears 
to 
the 
moment 
of 
AC 
the 
same 
ratio 
which 
the 
length 
HA 
bears 
to 
CA 
and 
since 
AG 
is 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
these 
two 
lengths, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
moment 
of 
twice 



D 
plus 
AC 
is 
to 
the 
moment 
of 
AC 
as 
the 
square 
of 
GA 
is 
to 
the 
square 
of 
CA. 
But 
the 
moment 
arising 
from 
the 
weight 
[momento 
premente] 
of 
the 
prism 
GA 
is 
to 
the 
moment 
of 
AC 
as 
thesquare 
of 
GA 
is 
to 
the 
square 
of 
CA; 
thence 
AG 
is 
the 
maximum 
length 
sought, 
that 
is, 
the 
length 
up 
to 
which 
the 
prism 
AC 
may 
be 
prolonged 
and 
still 
support 
itself, 
but 
beyond 
which 
it 
will 
break. 



Hitherto 
we 
have 
considered 
the 
moments 
and 
resistances 
of 
prisms 
and 
solid 
cylinders 
fixed 
at 
one 
end 
with 
a 
weight 
applied 
at 
the 
other 
end; 
three 
cases 
were 
discussed, 
namely, 
that 
in 
which 
the 
applied 
force 
was 
the 
only 
one 
acting, 
that 
in 
which 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
prism 
itself 
is 
also 
taken 
into 
consideration, 
and 
that 
in 
which 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
prism 
alone 
is 
taken 
into 
consideration. 
Let 
us 
now 
consider 
these 
same 
prisms 
and 
cylinders 
when 
supported 
at 
both 
ends 
or 
at 
a 
single 
point 
placed 
somewhere 
between 
the 
ends. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
I 
remark 
that 
a 
cylinder 
carrying 
only 
its 
own 
weight 
and 
having 
the 
maximum 
length, 
beyond 
which 
it 
will 
break, 
will, 
when 
supported 
either 
in 
the 
middle 
or 
at 
both 
ends, 
have 
twice 
the 
length 
of 
one 
which 
is 
mortised 
into 
a 
wall 
and 
supported 
only 
at 
one 
end. 
This 
is 
very 
evident 
because, 
if 
we 
denote 
the 
cylinder 
by 
ABC 
and 
if 
we 
assume 
that 
one-half 
of 
it, 
AB, 
is 
the 
greatest 
possible 
length 
capable 
of 
supporting 
its 
own 
weight 
with 
one 
end 
fixed 
at 
B, 
then, 
for 
the 
same 
reason, 
if 
the 
cylinder 
is 
carried 
on 
the 
point 
G, 
the 
first 
half 
will 
be 
counterbalanced 
by 
the 
other 
half 
BC. 
So 
also 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
cylinder 
DEF, 
if 
its 
length 
be 
such 
that 
it 
will 
support 
only 
one-half 
this 
length 
when 
the 
end 
D 
is 
held 
fixed, 
or 
the 
other 
half 
when 
the 
end 
F 
is 
fixed, 
then 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
when 
supports, 
such 



as 
H 
and 
I, 
are 
placed 
under 
the 
ends 
D 
and 
F 
respectively 
the 
moment 
of 
any 


additionalforceorweightplacedatEwillproducefractureatthispoint.
A 
more 
intricate 
and 
difficult 
problem 
is 
the 
following: 
neglect 
the 
weight 
of 
a 
solid 
such 
as 
the 
preceding 
and 
find 
whether 
the 
same 
force 
or 
weight 
which 
produces 
fracture 
when 
applied 
at 
the 
middle 
of 
a 
cylinder, 
supported 
at 
both 
ends, 
will 
also 
break 
the 
cylinder 
when 
applied 
at 
some 
other 
point 
neareroneendthantheother. 


Thus, 
for 
example, 
if 
one 
wished 
to 
break 
a 
stick 
by 
holding 
it 
with 
one 
hand 
at 
each 
end 
and 
applying 
his 
knee 
at 
the 
middle, 
would 
the 
same 
force 
be 
required 
to 
break 
it 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
if 
the 
knee 
were 
applied, 
not 
at 
the 
middle,butatsomepointnearerto 
oneend? 


Sagr. 
This 
problem, 
I 
believe, 
has 
been 
touched 
upon 
by 
Aristotle 
in 
his 
Questions 
in 
Mechanics. 


His 
inquiry 
however 
is 
not 
quite 
the 
same; 
for 
he 
seeks 
merely 
to 
discover 
why 
it 
is 
that 
a 
stick 
may 
be 
more 
easily 
broken 
by 
taking 
hold, 
one 
hand 
at 
each 
end 
of 
the 
stick, 
that 
is, 
far 
removed 
from 
the 
knee, 
than 
if 
the 
hands 
were 
closer 
together. 
He 
gives 
a 
general 
explanation, 
referring 
it 
to 
the 
lengthened 
lever 
arms 
which 
are 
secured 
by 
placing 
the 
hands 
at 
the 
ends 
of 
the 
stick. 
Our 
inquiry 
calls 
for 
something 
more: 
what 
we 
want 
to 
know 
is 
whether, 
when 
the 
hands 
are 
retained 
at 
the 
ends 
of 
the 
stick, 
the 
same 
force 
is 
requiredto 
breakitwhereverthekneebeplaced.

At 
first 
glance 
this 
would 
appear 
to 
be 
so, 
because

Now 
you 
see 
how 
readily 
one 
falls 
into 
error 
and 
what 
caution 
and 
circumspection 
are 
required 
to 
avoid 
it. 
What 
you 
have 
just 
said 
appears 
at 
first 
glance 
highly 
probable, 
but 
on 
closer 
examination 
it 
proves 
to 
be 
quite 
far 
from 
true; 
as 
will 
be 
seen 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
whether 
the 
knee 
— 
the 
fulcrum 
of 
the 
two 
levers 
— 
be 
placed 
in 
the 
middle 
or 
not 
makes 
such 
a 
difference 
that, 
if 
fracture 
is 
to 
be 
produced 
at 
any 
other 
point 
than 
the 
middle, 
the 
breaking 
force 
at 
the 
middle, 
even 
when 
multiplied 
four, 
ten, 
a 
hundred, 
or 
a 
thousand 
times 
would 
not 
suffice. 
To 
begin 
with 
we 
shall 
offer 
some 
general 
considerations 
and 
then 
pass 
to 
the 
determination 
of 
the 
ratio 
in 
which 
the 
breaking 
force 
must 
change 
in 
order 
to 
produce 
fracture 
at 
one 
pointrather 
thananother. 


Let 
AB 
denote 
a 
wooden 
cylinder 
which 
is 
to 
be 
broken 
in 
the 
middle, 
over 
the 
supporting 
point 
C, 
and 
let 
DE 
represent 
an 
identical 
cylinder 
which 
is 
to 
be 
broken 
just 
over 
the 
supporting 
point 
F 
which 
is 
not 
in 
the 
middle. 
First 
of 
all 
it 
is 
clear 
that, 
since 
the 
distances 
AC 
and 
CB 
are 
equal, 
the 
forces 
applied 
at 
the 
extremities 
B 
and 
A 
must 
also 
be 
equal. 
Secondly 
since 
the 
distance 
DF 
is 
less 
than 
the 
distance 
AC 
the 
moment 
of 
any 
force 
acting 
at 
D 
is 
less 
than 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
same 
force 
at 
A, 
that 
is, 
applied 
at 
the 
distance 
CA; 
and 
the 
moments 
are 
less 
in 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
length 
DF 
to 
AC; 
consequently 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
increase 
the 
force 
[momento] 
at 
D 
in 
order 
to 
overcome, 
or 
even 
to 
balance, 
the 
resistance 
at 
F; 
but 
in 
comparison 
with 
the 
length 
AC 
the 
distance 
DF 
can 
be 
diminished 
indefinitely: 
in 
order 
therefore 
to 
counterbalance 
the 
resistance 
at 
F 
it 
will 
be 
necessary 
to 
increase 
indefinitelytheforce[forza] 
applied 
at 
D. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
in 
proportion 
as 
we 
increase 
the 
distance 
FE 
over 
that 
of 
CB, 
we 
must 
diminish 
the 
force 
at 
E 
in 
order 
to 
counterbalance 
the 
resistance 
at 
F; 
but 
the 
distance 
FE, 
measured 
in 
terms 
of 
CB, 
cannot 
be 
increased 
indefinitely 
by 
sliding 
the 
fulcrum 
F 
toward 
the 
end 
D; 
indeed, 
it 
cannot 
even 
be 
made 
double 
the 
length 
CB. 
Therefore 
the 
force 
required 
at 
E 
to 
balance 
the 
resistance 
at 
F 
will 
always 
be 
more 
than 
half 
that 
required 
at 
B. 
It 
is 
clear 
then 
that, 
as 
the 
fulcrum 
F 
approaches 
the 
end 
D, 
we 
must 
of 
necessity 
indefinitely 
increase 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
forces 
applied 
at 
E 
and 
D 
in 
order 
to 
balance, 
or 
overcome, 
the 
resistance 
atF.

What 
shall 
we 
say, 
Simplicio? 
Must 
we 
not 
confess 
that 
geometry 
is 
the 
most 
powerful 
of 
all 
instruments 
for 
sharpening 
the 
wit 
and 
training 
the 
mind 
to 
think 
correctly? 
Was 
not 
Plato 
perfectly 
right 
when 
he 
wished 
that 
his 
pupils 
should 
be 
first 
of 
all 
well 
grounded 
in 
mathematics? 
As 
for 
myself, 
I 
quite 
understood 
the 
property 
of 
the 
lever 
and 
how, 
by 
increasing 
or 
diminishing 
its 
length, 
one 
can 
increase 
or 
diminish 
the 
moment 
of 
force 
and 
of 
resistance; 
and 
yet, 
in 
the 
solution 
of 
the 
present 
problem 
I 
was 
not 
slightly,butgreatly, 
deceived. 
Simp. 
Indeed 
I 
begin 
to 
understand 
that 
while 
logic 
is 
an 
excellent 
guide 
in 
discourse, 
it 
does 
not, 
as 
regards 
stimulation 
to 
discovery, 
compare 
with 
the 
power 
ofsharpdistinction 
whichbelongsto 
geometry. 


Sagr. 
Logic, 
it 
appears 
to 
me, 
teaches 
us 
how 
to 
test 
the 
conclusiveness 
of 
any 
argument 
or 
demonstration 
already 
discovered 
and 
completed; 
but 
I 
do 
not 
believe 
that 
it 
teaches 
us 
to 
discover 
correct 
arguments 
and 
demonstrations. 
But 
it 
would 
bebetterifSalviati 
were 
to 
show 
usin 
justwhat 
proportion 
the 
forces 
must 
be 
increased 
in 
order 
to 
produce 
fracture 
as 
the 



fulcrum 
is 
moved 
from 
one 
point 
to 
another 
along 
one 
and 
the 
same 
wooden 


rod. 


Theratio 
whichyoudesire 
isdeterminedasfollows: 


If 
upon 
a 
cylinder 
one 
marks 
two 
points 
at 
which 
fracture 
is 
to 
be 
produced, 
then 
the 
resistances 
at 
these 
two 
points 
will 
bear 
to 
each 
other 
the 
inverse 
ratio 
of 
the 
rectangles 
formed 
by 
the 
distances 
from 
the 
respective 
points 
totheendsof 
the 
cylinder. 


Let 
A 
and 
B 
denote 
the 
least 
forces 
which 
will 
bring 
about 
fracture 
of 
the 
cylinder 
at 
C; 
likewise 
E 
and 
F 
the 
smallest 
forces 
which 
will 
break 
it 
at 
D. 
Then, 
I 
say, 
that 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
forces 
A 
and 
B 
is 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
forces 
E 
and 
F 
as 
the 
area 
of 
the 
rectangle 
AD.DB 
is 
to 
the 
area 
of 
the 
rectangle 
AC.CB. 
Because 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
forces 
A 
and 
B 
bears 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
forces 
E 
and 
F 
a 
ratio 
which 
is 
the 
product 
of 
the 
three 
following 
ratios, 
namely, 
(A+B)/B, 
B/F, 
and 
F/(F+E); 
but 
the 
length 
BA 
is 
to 
the 
length 
CA 
as 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
forces 
A 
and 
B 
is 
to 
the 
force 
B; 
and, 
as 
the 
length 
DB 
is 
to 
the 
length 
CB, 
so 
is 
the 
force 
B 
to 
the 
force 
F; 
also 
as 
the 
length 
AD 
is 
to 
AB, 
so 
is 
the 
forceF 
tothesumofthe 
forcesFand 
E. 



Hence 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
sum 
ofthe 
forces 
A 
and 
B 
bears 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
forces 
E 
and 
F 
a 
ratio 
which 
is 
the 
product 
of 
the 
three 
following 
ratios, 
namely, 
BA/CA, 
BD/BC, 
and 
AD/AB. 
But 
DA/CA 
is 
the 
product 
of 
DA/BA 
and 
BA/CA. 
Therefore 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
forces 
A 
and 
B 
bears 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
forces 
E 
and 
F 
a 
ratio 
which 
is 
the 
product 
of 
DA:CA 
and 
DB:CB. 
But 
the 
rectangle 
AD.DB 
bears 
to 
the 
rectangle 
AC.CB 
a 
ratio 
which 
is 
the 
product 
of 
DA/CA 
and 
DB/CB. 
Accordingly 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
forces 
A 
and 
B 
is 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
forces 
E 
and 
F 
as 
the 
rectangle 
AD.DB 
is 
to 
the 
rectangle 
AC.CB, 
that 
is, 
the 
resistance 
to 
fracture 
at 
C 
is 
to 
the 
resistance 
to 
fracture 
at 
D 
as 
the 
rectangleAD.DB

q. 
e. 
d. 
Let 
that 
one 
of 
the 
given 
weights 
which 
is 
larger 
than 
the 
maximum 
weight 
supported 
at 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
cylinder 
AB 
bear 
to 
this 
maximum 
weight 
the 
same 
ratio 
which 
the 
length 
E 
bears 
to 
the 
length 
F. 
The 
problem 
is 
to 
find 
that 
point 
in 
the 
cylinder 
at 
which 
this 
larger 
weight 
becomes 
the 
maximum 
that 
can 
be 
supported. 
Let 
G 
be 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
the 
lengths 
E 
and 
F. 
Draw 
AD 
and 
S 
so 
that 
they 
bear 
to 
each 
other 
the 
same 
ratioas 
EtoG; 
accordingly 
Swillbeless 
thanAD. 


Let 
AD 
be 
the 
diameter 
of 
a 
semicircle 
AHD, 
in 
which 
take 
AH 
equal 
to 
S; 
join 
the 
points 
H 
and 
D 
and 
lay 
off 
DR 
equal 
to 
HD. 
Then, 
I 
say, 
R 
is 
the 
point 
sought, 
namely, 
the 
point 
at 
which 
the 
given 
weight, 
greater 
than 
the 
maximum 
supported 
at 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
cylinder 
D, 
would 
become 
the 
maximumload. 


On 
AB 
as 
diameter 
draw 
the 
semicircle 
ANB: 
erect 
the 
perpendicular 
RN 
and 
join 
the 
points 
N 
and 
D. 
Now 
since 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
squares 
on 
NR 
and 
RD 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
square 
of 
ND, 
that 
is, 
to 
the 
square 
of 
AD, 
or 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
squares 
of 
AH 
and 
HD; 
and, 
since 
the 
square 
of 
HD 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
square 
of 
DR, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
square 
of 
NR, 
that 
is, 
the 
rectangle 
AR.RB, 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
square 
of 
AH,also 
thereforeto 
the 
square 
of 
S;but 
the 
square 
of 
S 
is 
to 
the 
square 
of 
AD 
as 
the 
length 
F 
is 
to 
the 
length 
E, 
that 
is, 
as 
the 
maximum 
weight 
supported 
at 
D 
is 
to 
the 
larger 
of 
the 
two 
given 
weights. 
Hence 
the 
latter 
will 
be 
the 
maximum 
load 
which 
can 
be 
carried 
at 
the 
point 
R; 
which 
is 
thesolutionsought. 


Sagr. 
Now 
I 
understand 
thoroughly; 
and 
I 
am 
thinking 
that, 
since 
the 
prism 
AB 
grows 
constantly 
stronger 
and 
more 
resistant 
to 
the 
pressure 
of 
its 
load 
at 
points 
which 
are 
more 
and 
more 
removed 
from 
the 
middle, 
we 
could 
in 
the 
case 
of 
large 
heavy 
beams 
cut 
away 
a 
considerable 
portion 
near 
the 
ends 
which 
would 
notably 
lessen 
the 
weight, 
and 
which, 
in 
the 
beam 
work 
of 
large 
rooms,would 
provetobeofgreatutilityand 
convenience. 



Salv. 
I 
was 
just 
on 
the 
point 
of 
mentioning 
an 
interesting 
and 
remarkable 
fact 
connected 
with 
this 
very 
question. 
My 
meaning 
will 
be 
clearer 
if 
I 
draw 
a 
figure. 
Let 
DB 
represent 
a 
prism; 
then, 
as 
we 
have 
already 
shown, 
its 
resistance 
to 
fracture 
[bending 
strength] 
at 
the 
end 
AD, 
owing 
to 
a 
load 
placed 
at 
the 
end 
B, 
will 
be 
less 
than 
the 
resistance 
at 
CI 
in 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
length 
CB 
to 
AB. 
Now 
imagine 
this 
same 
prism 
to 
be 
cut 
through 
diagonally 
along 
the 
line 
FB 
so 
that 
the 
opposite 
faces 
will 
be 
triangular; 
the 
side 
facing 
us 
will 
be 
FAB. 
Such 
a 
solid 
will 
have 
properties 
different 
from 
those 
of 
the 
prism; 
for, 
if 
the 
load 
remain 
at 
B, 
the 
resistance 
against 
fracture 
[bending 
strength] 
at 
C 
will 
be 
less 
than 
that 
at 
A 
in 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
length 
CB 
to 
the 
length 
AB. 
This 
is 
easily 
proved: 
for 
if 
CNO 
represents 
a 
cross-section 
parallel 
to 
AFD, 
then 
the 
length 
FA 
bears 
to 
the 
length 
CN, 
in 
the 
triangle 
FAB, 
the 
same 
ratio 
which 
the 
length 
AB 
bears 
to 
the 
length 
CB. 
Therefore, 
if 
we 
imagine 
A 
and 
C 
to 
be 
the 
points 
at 
which 
the 
fulcrum 
is 
placed, 
the 
lever 
arms 
in 
the 
two 
cases 
BA, 
AF 
and 
BC, 
CN 
will 
be 
proportional 
[simili]. 
Hence 
the 
moment 
of 
any 
force 
applied 
at 
B 
and 
acting 
through 
the 
arm 
BA, 



against 
a 
resistance 
placed 
at 
a 
distance 
AF 
will 
be 
equal 
to 
that 
of 
the 
same 
force 
at 
B 
acting 
through 
the 
arm 
BC 
against 
the 
same 
resistance 
located 
at 
a 
distance 
CN. 
But 
now, 
if 
the 
force 
still 
be 
applied 
at 
B, 
the 
resistance 
to 
be 
overcome 
when 
the 
fulcrum 
is 
at 
C, 
acting 
through 
the 
arm 
CN, 
is 
less 
than 
the 
resistance 
with 
the 
fulcrum 
at 
A 
in 
the 
same 
proportion 
as 
the 
rectangular 
cross-section 
CO 
is 
less 
than 
the 
rectangular 
cross-section 
AD, 
that 
is, 
as 
the 


lengthCNislessthanAF,orCBthanBA.
Consequently 
the 
resistance 
to 
fracture 
at 
C, 
offered 
by 
the 
portion 
OBC, 
is 
less 
than 
the 
resistancetofractureat 
A,offered 
bythe 
entire 
block 
DAB, 
in 
thesameproportion 
asthelengthCBissmallerthanthelength 
AB. 


By 
this 
diagonal 
saw-cut 
we 
have 
now 
removed 
from 
the 
beam, 
or 
prism 
DB, 
a 
portion, 
i. 
e., 
a 
half, 
and 
have 
left 
the 
wedge, 
or 
triangular 
prism, 
FBA. 
We 
thus 
have 
two 
solids 
possessing 
opposite 
properties; 
one 
body 
grows 
stronger 
as 
it 
is 
shortened 
while 
the 
other 
grows 
weaker. 
This 
being 
so 
it 
would 
seem 
not 
merely 
reasonable, 
but 
inevitable, 
that 
there 
exists 
a 
line 
of 
section 
such 
that, 
when 
the 
superfluous 
material 
has 
been 
removed, 
there 
will 
remain 
a 
solid 
of 
such 
figure 
that 
it 
will 
offer 
the 
same 
resistance 
[strength] 
at 
allpoints. 
Simp. 
Evidentlyonemust,

Sagr. 
But 
now 
the 
question 
is 
what 
path 
the 
saw 
should 
follow 
in 
making 
the 
cut. 



Simp. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
this 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
a 
difficult 
task: 
for 
if 
by 
sawing 
the 
prism 
along 
the 
diagonal 
line 
and 
removing 
half 
of 
the 
material, 
the 
remainder 
acquires 
a 
property 
just 
the 
opposite 
to 
that 
of 
the 
entire 
prism, 
so 
that 
at 
every 
point 
where 
thelatter 
gains 
strength 
the 
former 
becomes 
weaker, 
then 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
by 
taking 
a 
middle 
path, 
i. 
e., 
by 
removing 
half 
the 
former 
half, 
or 
one-quarter 
of 
the 
whole, 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
remaining 
figure 
will 
be 
constant 
at 
all 
those 
points 
where, 
in 
the 
two

You 
have 
missed 
the 
mark, 
Simplicio. 
For, 
as 
I 
shall 
presently 
show 
you, 
the 
amount 
which 
you 
can 
remove 
from 
the 
prism 
without 
weakening 
it 
is 
not 
a 
quarter 
but 
a 
third. 
It 
now 
remains, 
as 
suggested 
by 
Sagredo, 
to 
discover 
the 
path 
along 
which 
the 
saw 
must 
travel: 
this, 
as 
I 
shall 
prove, 
must

If 
the 
fulcrums 
are 
so 
placed 
under 
two 
levers 
or 
balances 
that 
the 
arms 
through 
which 
the 
forces 
act 
are 
to 
each 
other 
in 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
arms 
through 
which 
the 
resistances 
act, 
and 
if 
these 
resistances 
are 
to 
each 
other 
in 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
arms 
through 
which 
they 
act, 
then 
the 
forces 
willbeequal. 


Let 
AB 
and 
CD 
represent 
two 
levers 
whose 
lengths 
are 
divided 
by 
their 
fulcrums 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
make 
the 
distance 
EB 
bear 
to 
the 
distance 
FD 
a 
ratio 
which 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
square 
of 
the 
ratio 
between 
the 
distances 
EA 
and 
FC. 
Let 
the 
resistances 
located 
at 
A 
and 
C 
be 
to 
each 
other 
as 
EA 
is 
to 
FC. 
Then, 
I 
say, 
the 
forces 
which 
must 
be 
applied 
at 
B 
and 
D 
in 
order 
to 
hold 
in 
equilibrium 
the 
resistances 
at 
A 
and 
C 
are 
equal. 
Let 
EG 
be 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
EB 
and 
FD. 
Then 
we 
shall 
have 
BE:EG=EG:FD=AE:CF. 
But 
this 
last 
ratio 
is 
precisely 
that 
which 
we 
have 
assumed 
to 
exist 
between 
the 
resistances 
at 
A 
and 
C. 
And 
since 
EG:FD=AE:CF, 
it 
follows, 
permutando, 
that 
EG:AE=FD:CF. 
Seeing 
that 
the 
distances 
DC 
and 
GA 
are 
divided 
in 
the 
same 
ratio 
by 
the 
points 
F 
and 
E, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
same 
force 
which, 
when 
applied 
at 
D, 
will 
equilibrate 
the 
resistance 
at 
C, 
would 
if 
applied 
at 
G 
equilibrate 
at 
A 
a 
resistance 
equal 
to 
that 
foundatC. 



Butone 
datum 
of 
the 
problem 
is 
that 
the 
resistance 
at 
A 
is 
to 
the 
resistance 
at 
C 
as 
the 
distance 
AE 
is 
to 
the 
distance 
CF, 
or 
as 
BEis 
to 
EG. 
Therefore 
the 
force 
applied 
at 
G, 
or 
rather 
at 
D, 
will, 
when 
applied 
at 
B, 
just 
balance 
the 
resistancelocatedatA.

This 
being 
clear 
draw 
the 
parabola 
FNB 
in 
the 
face 
FB 
of 
the 
prism 
DB. 
Let 
the 
prism 
be 
sawed 
along 
this 
parabola 
whose 
vertex 
is 
at 
B. 
The 
portion 
of 
the 
solid 
which 
remains 
will 
be 
included 
between 
the 
base 
AD, 
the 
rectangular 
plane 
AG, 
the 
straight 
line 
BG 
and 
the 
surface 
DGBF, 
whose 
curvature 
is 
identical 
with 
that 
of 
the 
parabola 
FNB. 
This 
solid 
will 
have, 
I 
say, 
the 
same 
strength 
at 
every 
point. 
Let 
the 
solid 
be 
cut 
by 
a 
plane 
CO 
parallel 
to 
the 
plane 
AD. 
Imagine 
the 
points 
A 
and 
C 
to 
be 
the 
fulcrums 
of 
two 
levers 
of 
which 
one 
will 
have 
the 
arms 
BA 
and 
AF; 
the 
other 
BC 
and 
CN. 
Then 
since 
in 
the 
parabola 
FBA, 
we 
have 
BA:BC=:, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
arm 
BA 
of 
one 
lever 
is 
to 
the 
arm 
BC 
of 
the 
other 
lever 
as 
the 
square 
of 
the 
arm 
AF 
is 
to 
the 
square 
of 
the 
other 
arm 
CN. 
Since 
the 
resistance 
to 
be 
balanced 
by 
the 
lever 
BA 
is 
to 
the 
resistance 
to 
be 
balanced 
by 
the 
lever 
BC 
in 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
rectangle 
DA 
is 
to 
the 
rectangle 
OC, 
that 
is 
as 
the 
length 
AF 
is 
to 
the 
length 
CN, 
which 
two 
lengths 
are 
the 
other 
arms 
of 
the 
levers, 
it 
follows, 
by 
the 
lemma 
just 
demonstrated, 
that 
the 
same 
force 
which, 
when 
applied 
at 
BG 
will 
equilibrate 
the 
resistance 
at 
DA, 
will 
also 
balance 
the 
resistance 
at 
CO. 
The 
same 
is 
true 
for 
any 
other 
section. 
Therefore 
this 
parabolicsolidisequallystrong 
throughout. 



It 
can 
now 
be 
shown 
that, 
if 
the 
prism 
be 
sawed 
along 
the 
line 
of 
the 
parabola 
FNB, 
one-third 
part 
of 
it 
will 
be 
removed; 
because 
the 
rectangle 
FB 
and 
the 
surface 
FNBA 
bounded 
by 
the 
parabola 
are 
the 
bases 
of 
two 
solids 
included 
between 
two 
parallel 
planes, 
i. 
e., 
between 
the 
rectangles 
FB 
and 
DG; 
consequently 
the 
volumes 
of 
these 
two 
solids 
bear 
to 
each 
other 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
their 
bases. 
But 
the 
area 
of 
the 
rectangle 
is 
one 
and 
a 
half 
times 
as 
large 
as 
the 
area 
FNBA 
under 
the 
parabola; 
hence 
by 
cutting 
the 
prism 
along 
the 
parabola 
we 
remove 
one-third 
of 
the 
volume. 
It 
is 
thus 
seen 
how 
one 
can 
diminish 
the 
weight 
of 
a 
beam 
by 
as 
much 
as 
thirty-three 
per 
cent 
without 
diminishing 
its 
strength; 
a 
fact 
of 
no 
small 
utility 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
large 
vessels, 
and 
especially 
in 
supporting 
the 
decks, 
since

such 
structureslightnessisofprimeimportance. 


Sagr. 
The 
advantages 
derived 
from 
this 
fact 
are 
so 
numerous 
that 
it 
would 
be 
both 
wearisome 
and 
impossible 
to 
mention 
them 
all; 
but 
leaving 
this 
matter 
to 
one 
side, 
I 
should 
like 
to 
learn 
just 
how 
it 
happens 
that 
diminution 
of 
weight 
is 
possible 
in 
the 
ratio 
above 
stated. 
I 
can 
readily 
understand 
that, 
when 
a 
section 
is 
made 
along 
the 
diagonal, 
one-half 
the 
weight 
is 
removed; 
but, 
as 
for 
the 
parabolic 
section 
removing 
one-third 
of 
the 
prism, 
this 
I 
can 
only 
accept 
on 
the 
word 
of 
Salviati 
who 
is 
always 
reliable; 
however 
I 
prefer 
first-handknowledge 
tothewordofanother. 


Salv. 
You 
would 
like 
then 
a 
demonstration 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
excess 
of 
the 
volumeofaprism 
overthe 
volumeof 
what 
we 
have 
called 
the 
parabolic 
solid 
is 
one-third 
of 
the 
entire 
prism. 
This 
I 
have 
already 
given 
you 
on 
a 
previous 
occasion; 
however 
I 
shall 
now 
try 
to 
recall 
the 
demonstration 
in 
which 
I 
remember 
having 
used 
a 
certain 
lemma 
from 
Archimedes’ 
book 
On 
Spirals,24 



namely, 
Given 
any 
number 
of 
lines, 
differing 
in 
length 
one 
from 
another 
by 
a 
common 
difference 
which 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
shortest 
of 
these 
lines; 
and 
given 
also 
an 
equal 
number 
of 
lines 
each 
of 
which 
has 
the 
same 
length 
as 
the 
longest 
of 
the 
first-mentioned 
series; 
then 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
lines 
of 
this 
second 
group 
will 
be 
less 
than 
three 
times 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
lines 
in 
the 
first 
group. 
But 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
second 
group 
will 
be 
greater 
than 
three 
times 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
squares 
of 
all 
excepting 
the 
longestof 
thefirstgroup. 


24 
The 
reader 
will 
notice 
that 
two 
different 
problems 
are 
here 
involved. 
That 
which 
is 
suggested 
in 
the 
lastremarkof 
Sagredois 
the 
following: 


To 
find 
a 
beam 
whose 
maximum 
stress 
has 
the 
same 
value 
when 
a 
constant 
load 
moves 
from 
one 
end 
of 
the 
beam 
to 
the 
other. 
The 
second 
problem 
— 
the 
one 
which 
Salviati 
proceeds 
to 
solve 
— 
is 
the 
following: 
To 
find 
a 
beam 
in 
all 
cross-sections 
of 
which 
the 
maximum 
stress 
is 
the 
same 
for 
a

More 
slowly, 
please; 
for 
I 
do 
not 
see 
how

of

Salv. 
Does 
not 
the 
rectangle 
BO 
have 
an 
area 
which 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
areasofallthelittlerectanglesthroughwhich 
theparabolapasses?Imean 
the

HF,

and 
GA 
of 
which 
only 
a 
part 
lies 
outside 
the 
“mixed 
triangle.” 
Have 
we 
not 
taken 
the 
rectangle 
BO 
smaller 
than 
the 
area 
X? 
Therefore 
if, 
as 
our 
opponent 
might 
say, 
the 
triangle 
plus 
X 
is 
equal 
to 
a 
third 
part 
of 
this 
rectangle 
CP, 
the 
circumscribed 
figure, 
which 
adds 
to 
the 
triangle 
an 
area 
less 
than 
X, 
will 
still 
remain 
smaller 
than 
a 
third 
part 
of 
the 
rectangle, 
CP. 
But 
this 
cannot 
be, 
because 
this 
circumscribed 
figure 
is 
larger 
than 
a 
third 
of 
the 
area. 
Hence 
it 
is 
not 
true 
that 
our 
“mixed 
triangle” 
is 
less 
thanathirdof 
the 
rectangle. 


You 
have 
cleared 
up 
my 
difficulty; 
but 
it 
still 
remains 
to 
be 
shown 
that 
the 
circumscribed 
figure 
is 
larger 
than 
a 
third 
part 
of 
the 
rectangle 
CP, 
a 
task 
which

Salv. 
Thereis 
nothingverydifficultabout 
it. 
Sincein 
the 
parabola:=DA:AZ= 
rectangle 
KE: 
rectangle 
AG, 
seeing 
that 
the 
altitudes 
of 
these 
two 
rectangles, 
AK 
and 
KL, 
are 
equal, 
it 
follows 
that 
:=:=rectangle 
KE: 
rectangle 
KZ. 
In 
precisely 
the 
same 
manner 
it 
may 
be 
shown 
that 
the 
other 
rectangles 
LF, 
MH, 
NI, 
OB, 
stand 
to 
one 
another 
in 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
lines 
MA, 
NA,OA,PA. 


Let 
us 
now 
consider 
the 
circumscribed 
figure, 
composed 
of 
areas 
which 
bear 
to 
each 
other 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
squares 
of 
a 
series 
of 
lines 
whose 
common 
difference 
in 
length 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
shortest 
one 
in 
the 
series; 
note 
also 
that 
the 
rectangle 
CP 
is 
made 
up 
of 
an 
equal 
number 
of 
areas 
each 
equal 
to 
the 
largest 
and 
each 
equal 
to 
the 
rectangle 
OB. 
Consequently, 
according 
to 
the 
lemma 
of 
Archimedes, 
the 
circumscribed 
figure 
is 
larger 
than 
a 
third 
part 
of 
the 
rectangle 
CP; 
but 
it 
was 
also 
smaller, 
which 
is 
impossible. 
Hence 
the 
“mixedtriangle” 
isnotlessthana 
third 
partof 
therectangleCP. 


Likewise, 
I 
say, 
it 
cannot 
be 
greater. 
For, 
let 
us 
suppose 
that 
it 
is 
greater 
than 
a 
third 
part 
of 
the 
rectangle 
CP 
and 
let 
the 
area 
X 
represent 
the 
excess 
of 
the 
triangle 
over 
the 
third 
part 
of 
the 
rectangle 
CP; 
subdivide 
the 
rectangle 
into 
equal 
rectangles 
and 
continue 
the 
process 
until 
one 
of 
these 
subdivisions 
is 
smaller 
than 
the 
area 
X. 
Let 
BO 
represent 
such 
a 
rectangle 
smaller 
than 
X. 
Using 
the 
above 
figure, 
we 
have 
in 
the 
“mixed 
triangle” 
an 
inscribed 
figure, 
made 
up 
of 
the 
rectangles 
VO, 
TN, 
SM, 
RL, 
and 
QK, 
which 
will 
not 
be 
less 
thanathirdpartofthelargerectangleCP. 


For 
the 
“mixed 
triangle” 
exceeds 
the 
inscribed 
figure 
by 
a 
quantity 
less 
than 
that 
by 
which 
it 
exceeds 
the 
third 
part 
of 
the 
rectangle 
CP; 
to 
see 
that 
this 
is 
true 
we 
have 
only 
to 
remember 
that 
the 
excess 
of 
the 
triangle 
over 
the 
third 
part 
of 
the 
rectangle 
CP 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
area 
X, 
which 
is 
less 
than 
the 
rectangle 
BO, 
which 
in 
turn 
is 
much 
less 
than 
the 
excess 
of 
the 
triangle 
over 
the 
inscribed 
figure. 
For 
the 
rectangle 
BO 
is 
made 
up 
of 
the 
small 
rectangles 
AG, 
GE, 
EF, 
FH, 
HI, 
and 
IB; 
and 
the 
excess 
of 
the 
triangle 
over 
the 
inscribed 
figure 
is 
less 
than 
half 
the 
sum 
of 
these 
little 
rectangles. 
Thus 
since 
the 
triangle 
exceeds 
the 
third 
part 
of 
the 
rectangle 
CP 
by 
an 
amount 
X, 
which 
is 
more 
than 
that 
by 
which 
it 
exceeds 
the 
inscribed 
figure, 
the 
latter 
will 
also 
exceed 
the 
third 
part 
of 
the 
rectangle, 
CP. 
But, 
by 
the 
lemma 
which 
we 
have 
assumed, 
it 
is 
smaller. 
For 
the 
rectangle 
CP, 
being 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
largest 
rectangles, 
bears 
to 
the 
component 
rectangles 
of 
the 
inscribed 
figure 
the 
same 
ratio 
which 
the 
sum 
of 
all 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
lines 
equal 
to 
the 
longest 
bears 
to 



the 
squares 
of 
the 
lines 
which 
have 
a 
common 
difference, 
after 
the 
square 
of 
thelongesthasbeensubtracted. 


Therefore, 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
squares, 
the 
sum 
total 
of 
the 
largest 
rectangles, 


i. 
e., 
the 
rectangle 
CP, 
is 
greater 
than 
three 
times 
the 
sum 
total 
of 
those 
having 
a 
common 
difference 
minus 
the 
largest; 
but 
these 
last 
make 
up 
the 
inscribed 
figure. 
Hence 
the 
“mixed 
triangle” 
is 
neither 
greater 
nor 
less 
than 
thethirdpart 
ofrectangleCP;

A 
book 
which, 
indeed, 
is 
not 
to 
be 
placed 
second 
to 
any 
produced 
by 
themost 
eminentgeometerseitherof 
the

or

the 
past; 
a 
bookwhich, 
as 
soon 
as 
it 
fell 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
our 
Academician, 
led 
him 
to 
abandon 
his 
own 
researches 
along 
these 
lines; 
for 
he 
saw 
how 
happily 
everything 
had 
beentreatedanddemonstratedby 
Valerio. 


When 
I 
was 
informed 
of 
this 
event 
by 
the 
Academician 
himself, 
I 
begged 
of 
him 
to 
show 
the 
demonstrations 
which 
he 
had 
discovered 
before

Salv. 
I 
have 
a 
copy 
of 
them 
and 
will 
show 
them 
to 
you; 
for 
you 
will 
enjoy 
the 
diversity 
of 
method 
employed 
by 
these 
two 
authors 
in 
reaching 
and 
proving 
the 
same 
conclusions; 
you 
will 
also 
find 
that 
some 
of 
these 
conclusions 
are 
explainedindifferentways,although

Sagr. 
I 
shall 
be 
much 
pleased 
to 
see 
them 
and 
will 
consider 
it 
a 
great 
favor 
if 
you 
will 
bring 
them 
to 
our 
regular 
meeting. 
But 
in 
the 
meantime, 
considering 
the 
strength 
of 
a 
solid 
formed 
from 
a 
prism 
by 
means 
of 
a 
parabolic 
section, 
would 
it 
not, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
this 
result 
promises 
to 
be 
both 
interesting 
and 
useful 
in 
many 
mechanical 
operations, 
be 
a 
fine 
thing 
if 
you 
were 
to 
give 



some 
quick 
and 
easy 
rule 
by 
which 
a 
mechanician 
might 
draw 
a 
parabola 
uponaplanesurface? 


Salv. 
There 
are 
many 
ways 
of 
tracing 
these 
curves; 
I 
will 
mention 
merely 
the 
two 
which 
are 
the 
quickest 
of 
all. 
One 
of 
these 
is 
really 
remarkable; 
because 
by 
it 
I 
can 
trace 
thirty 
or 
forty 
parabolic 
curves 
with 
no 
less 
neatness 
and 
precision, 
and 
in 
a 
shorter 
time 
than 
another 
man 
can, 
by 
the 
aid 
of 
a 
compass, 
neatly 
draw 
four 
or 
six 
circles 
of 
different 
sizes 
upon 
paper. 
I 
take 
a 
perfectly 
round 
brass 
ball 
about 
the 
size 
of 
a 
walnut 
and 
project 
it 
along 
the 
surface 
of 
a 
metallic 
mirror 
held 
in 
a 
nearly 
upright 
position, 
so 
that 
the 
ball 
in 
its 
motion 
will 
press 
slightly 
upon 
the 
mirror 
and 
trace 
out 
a 
fine 
sharp 
parabolic 
line; 
this 
parabola27 
will 
grow 
longer 
and 
narrower 
as 
the 
angle 
of 
elevation 
increases. 
The 
above 
experiment 
furnishes 
clear 
and 
tangible 
evidence 
that 
the 
path 
of 
a 
projectile 
is 
a 
parabola; 
a 
fact 
firstobservedby 
our 
friend 
and 
demonstrated 
by 
him 
in 
his 
book 
on 
motion 
which 
we 
shall 
take 
up 
at 
our 
next 
meeting. 
In 
the 
execution 
of 
this 
method, 
it 
is 
advisable 
to 
slightly 
heat 
and 
moisten 
the 
ball 
by 
rolling 
in 
the 
hand 
in 
order 
that 
its 
trace

maybemoredistinct.

It 
is 
now 
well 
known 
that 
this 
curve 
is 
not 
a 
parabola 
but 
a 
catenary

equation 
of 
which 
was

By 
use 
of 
the 
geometrical 
lines 
drawn 
upon

Hitherto 
we 
have 
demonstrated 
numerous 
conclusions 
pertaining 
to 
the 
resistance 
which 
solids 
offer 
to 
fracture. 
As 
a 
starting 
point 
for 
this 
science, 
we 
assumed 
that 
the 
resistance 
offered 
by 
the 
solid 
to 
a 
straight-away 
pull 
was 
known; 
from 
this 
base 
one 
might 
proceed 
to 
the 
discovery 
of 
many 
other 
results 
and 
their 
demonstrations; 
of 
these 
results 
the 
number 
to 
be 
found 
in 
nature 
is 
infinite. 
But, 
in 
order 
to 
bring 
our 
daily 
conference 
to 
an 
end, 
I 
wish 
todiscuss 
the 
strengthofhollowsolids,whichare 
employed 
inart 
—andstill 
oftener 
in 
nature 
— 
in 
a 
thousand 
operations 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
greatly 
increasing 
strength 
without 
adding 
to 
weight; 
examples 
of 
these 
are 
seen 
in 
the 
bones 
of 
birds 
and 
in 
many 
kinds 
of 
reeds 
which 
are 
light 
and 
highly 



resistant 
both 
to 
bending 
and 
breaking. 
For 
if 
a 
stem 
of 
straw 
which 
carries 
a 
head 
of 
wheat 
heavier 
than 
the 
entire 
stalk 
were 
made 
up 
of 
the 
same 
amount 
of 
material 
in 
solid 
form 
it 
would 
offer 
less 
resistance 
to 
bending 
and 
breaking. 
This 
is 
an 
experience 
which 
has 
been 
verified 
and 
confirmed 
in 
practice 
where 
it 
is 
found 
that 
a 
hollow 
lance 
or 
a 
tube 
of 
wood 
or 
metal 
is 
much 
stronger 
than 
would 
be 
a 
solid 
one 
of 
the 
same 
length 
and 
weight, 
one 
which 
would 
necessarily 
be 
thinner; 
men 
have 
discovered, 
therefore, 
that 
in 
order 
to 
make 
lances 
strong 
as 
well 
as 
light 
they 
must 
make 
them 
hollow. 
We 
shallnow 
showthat: 


In 
the 
case 
of 
two 
cylinders, 
one 
hollow 
the 
other 
solid 
but 
having 
equal 
volumes 
and 
equal 
lengths, 
their 
resistances 
[bending 
strengths] 
are 
to 
each 
otherintheratiooftheirdiameters. 


Let 
AE 
denote 
a 
hollow 
cylinder 
and 
IN 
a 
solid 
one 
of 
the 
same 
weight 
and 
length; 
then, 
I 
say, 
that 
the 
resistance 
against 
fracture 
exhibited 
by 
the 
tube 
AE 
bears 
to 
that 
of 
the 
solid 
cylinder 
IN 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
diameter 
AB 
to 
the 
diameter 
IL. 
This 
is 
very 
evident; 
for 
since 
the 
tube 
and 
the 
solid 
cylinder 
IN 
have 
the 
same 
volume 
and 
length, 
the 
area 
of 
the 
circular 
base 
IL 
will 
be 
equal 
to 
that 
of 
the 
annulus 
AB 
which 
is 
the 
base 
of 
the 
tube 
AE. 
(By 
annulus 
is 
here 
meant 
the 
area 
which 
lies 
between 
two 
concentric 
circles 
of 
different 
radii.) 
Hence 
their 
resistances 
to 
a 
straight-away 
pull 
are 
equal; 
but 
in 
producing 
fracture 
by 
a 
transverse 
pull 
we 
employ, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
cylinder 
IN, 
the 
length 
LN 
as 
one 
lever 
arm, 
the 
point 
L 
as 
a 
fulcrum, 
and 
the 
diameter 
LI, 
or 
its 
half, 
as 
the 
opposing 
lever 
arm: 
while 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
tube, 
the 
length 
BE 
which 
plays 
the 
part 
of 
the 
first 
lever 
arm 
is 
equal 
to 
LN, 
the 
opposing 
lever 
arm 
beyond 
the 
fulcrum, 
B, 
is 
the 
diameter 
AB, 
or 
its 
half. 
Manifestly 
then 
the 
resistance 
[bending 
strength] 
of 
the 
tube 
exceeds 
that 
of 
the 
solid 
cylinder 
in 
the 
proportion 
in 
which 
the 
diameter 
AB 
exceeds 
the 
diameter 
IL 
which 
is 
the 
desired 
result. 
Thus 
the 
strength 
of 
a 
hollow 
tube 
exceeds 
that 
of 
a 
solid 
cylinder 
in 
the 
ratio 
of 
their 
diameters 
whenever 
the 
two 
aremadeof 
the 
same 
materialand 
havethesameweightand 
length. 



It 
may 
be 
well 
next 
to 
investigate 
the 
general 
case 
of 
tubes 
and 
solid 
cylinders 
of 
constant 
length, 
but 
with 
the 
weight 
and 
the 
hollow 
portion 
variable. 
Firstweshallshowthat: 


Given 
a 
hollow 
tube, 
a 
solid 
cylinder 
may 
be 
determined 
which 
will 
be 
equal[eguale]toit. 


The 
method 
is 
very 
simple. 
Let 
AB 
denote 
the 
external 
and 
CD 
the 
internal 
diameter 
of 
the 
tube. 
In 
the 
larger 
circle 
lay 
off 
the 
line 
AE 
equal 
in 
length 
to 
the 
diameter 
CD; 
join 
the 
points 
E 
and 
B. 
Now 
since 
the 
angle 
at 
E 
inscribed 
in 
a 
semicircle, 
AEB, 
is 
a 
right-angle, 
the 
area 
of 
the 
circle 
whose 
diameter 
is 
AB 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
areas 
of 
the 
two 
circles 
whose 
respective 
diameters 
are 
AE 
and 
EB. 
But 
AE 
is 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
hollow 
portion 
of 
the 
tube. 
Therefore 
the 
area 
of 
the 
circle 
whose 
diameter 
is 
EB 
is 
the 
same 
as 
the 
area 
of 
the 
annulus 
ACBD. 
Hence 
a 
solid 
cylinder 
of 
circular 
base 
havinga 
diameterEB 
willhave 
thesame 
volumeas 
thewalls 
ofthe 
tube

Let 
ABE 
denote 
a 
tube 
and 
RSM 
a 
cylinder 
of 
equal 
length: 
it 
is 
required 
to

the

(diameters

as

V:RS=RS:IL. 
Then, 
I

as

For, 
since

equal 
both 
in

and

to 
the

the

This 
discussion 
is 
divided 
into 
three 
parts; 
the 
first 
part 
deals 
with 
motion 
which 
is 
steady 
or 
uniform; 
the 
second 
treats 
of 
motion 
as 
we 
find 
it 
accelerated 
in 
nature; 
the 
third 
deals 
with 
the 
so-called 
violent 
motions 
and 
withprojectiles. 


UniformMotion 


In 
dealing 
with 
steady 
or 
uniform 
motion, 
we 
need 
a 
single 
definition 
which 
I 
giveas 
follows: 


Definition 


By 
steady 
or 
uniform 
motion, 
I 
mean 
one 
in 
which 
the 
distances 
traversed 
by 
themovingparticleduringanyequalintervalsof 
time,arethemselvesequal. 


Caution 


We 
must 
add 
to 
the 
old 
definition 
(which 
defined 
steady 
motion 
simply 
as 
one 
in 
which 
equal 
distances 
are 
traversed 
in 
equal 
times) 
the 
word 
“any,” 
meaning 
by 
this, 
all 
equal 
intervals 
of 
time; 
for 
it 
may 
happen 
that 
the 
moving 
body 
will 
traverse 
equal 
distances 
during 
some 
equal 
intervals 
of 
time 
and 
yet 
the 
distances 
traversed 
during 
some 
small 
portion 
of 
these 
timeintervalsmaynotbeequal,
eventhough 
the 
time-intervals 
beequal. 


Fromtheabove 
definition,fouraxiomsfollow,namely: 


AxiomI 


In 
the 
case 
of 
one 
and 
the

motion, 
the 
distance

interval 
of 
time 
is 
greater 
than 
the 
distance 
traversed 
during 
a 
shorter 
intervaloftime.

In 
the

In

Theorem 
I, 
PropositionI 


If 
a 
moving 
particle, 
carried 
uniformly 
at 
a 
constant 
speed, 
traverses 
two 
distances 
the 
time-intervals 
required 
are 
to 
each 
other 
in 
the 
ratio 
of 
these 
distances. 


Let 
a 
particle 
move 
uniformly 
with 
constant 
speed 
through 
two 
distances 
AB, 
BC, 
and 
let 
the 
time 
required 
to 
traverse 
AB 
be 
represented 
by 
DE; 
the 
time 
required 
to 
traverse 
BC, 
by 
EF; 
then 
I 
say 
that 
the 
distance 
AB 
is 
to 
the 
distance 
BCasthe 
timeDEisto 
the 
timeEF. 



Let 
the 
distances 
and 
times 
be 
extended 
on 
both 
sides 
towards 
G, 
H 
and 
I, 
K; 
let 
AG 
be 
divided 
into 
any 
number 
whatever 
of 
spaces 
each 
equal 
to 
AB, 
and 
in 
like 
manner 
lay 
off 
in 
DI 
exactly 
the 
same 
number 
of 
time-intervals 
each 
equal 
to 
DE. 
Again 
lay 
off 
in 
CH 
any 
number 
whatever 
of 
distances 
each 
equal 
to 
BC; 
and 
in 
FK 
exactly 
the 
same 
number 
of 
time-intervals 
each 
equal 
to 
EF; 
then

the 
distance

and 
the

EI 
be 
equal 
and

multiples 
of 
the 
distance 
BA 
and 
the 
time 
ED; 
and 
likewise 
the 
distance 
HB 
and 
the 
time 
KE 
are 
equal 
and 
arbitrary 
multiples 
of 
the 
distance 
CB 
and 
the 
timeFE. 


And 
since 
DE 
is 
the 
time 
required 
to 
traverse 
AB, 
the 
whole 
time 
EI 
will 
be 
required 
for 
the 
whole 
distance 
BG,

and 
likewise 
it 
follows 
that 
KE 
represents 
the 
time 
required 
totraverse 
HB. 


Since, 
however, 
the 
motion 
is 
uniform, 
it 
follows 
that 
if 
the 
distance 
GB 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
distance 
BH, 
then 
must 
also 
the 
time 
IE 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
time 
EK; 
and 
ifGBis 
greater 
thanBH,thenalsoIEwill 
begreaterthanEK; 
andifless,

There 
are 
then 
four 
quantities, 
the 
first 
AB, 
the 
second 
BC, 
the 
third 
DE, 
and 
the 
fourth 
EF; 
the 
time 
IE 
and 
the 
distance 
GB 
are 
arbitrary 
multiples 
of 
the 
first 
and 
the 
third, 
namely 
of 
the 
distance 
AB 
and 
the 
time 
DE.

Therefore 
the

Referring 
to

let

Then, 
I 
say, 
the

the

one 
may 
infer,

that

and 
let 
the

Then 
I

let

then, 
from

it

that 
the

the

it

if

as

Salv. 
The 
preceding 
is 
what 
our 
Author 
has 
written 
concerning 
uniform 
motion. 
We 
pass 
now 
to 
a 
new 
and 
more 
discriminating 
consideration 
of 
naturally 
accelerated 
motion, 
such 
as 
that 
generally 
experienced 
by 
heavy 
fallingbodies; 
following 
isthetitleandintroduction. 


Naturally 
AcceleratedMotion 


The 
properties 
belonging 
to 
uniform 
motion 
have 
been 
discussed 
in 
the 
precedingsection;but 
accelerated 
motionremains 
tobeconsidered. 


And 
first 
of 
all 
it 
seems 
desirable 
to 
find 
and 
explain 
a 
definition 
best 
fitting 
natural 
phenomena. 
For 
anyone 
may 
invent 
an 
arbitrary 
type 
of 
motion 
and 
discuss 
its 
properties; 
thus, 
for 
instance, 
some 
have 
imagined 
helices 
and 
conchoids 
as 
described 
by 
certain 
motions 
which 
are 
not 
met 
with 
in 
nature, 
and 
have 
very 
commendably 
established 
the 
properties 
which 
these 
curves 
possess 
in 
virtue 
of 
their 
definitions; 
but 
we 
have 
decided 
to 
consider 
the 
phenomena 
of 
bodies 
falling 
with 
an 
acceleration 
such 
as 
actually 
occurs 
in 
nature 
and 
to 
make 
this 
definition 
of 
accelerated 
motion 
exhibit 
the 
essential 



features 
of 
observed 
accelerated 
motions. 
And 
this, 
at 
last, 
after 
repeated 
efforts 
we 
trust 
we 
have 
succeeded 
in 
doing. 
In 
this 
belief 
we 
are 
confirmed 
mainly 
by 
the 
consideration 
that 
experimental 
results 
are 
seen 
to 
agree 
with 
and 
exactly 
correspond 
with 
those 
properties 
which 
have 
been, 
one 
after 
another, 
demonstrated 
by 
us. 
Finally, 
in 
the 
investigation 
of 
naturally 
accelerated 
motion 
we 
were 
led, 
by 
hand 
as 
it 
were, 
in 
following 
the 
habit 
and 
custom 
of 
nature 
herself, 
in 
all 
her 
various 
other 
processes, 
to 
employ 
onlythosemeanswhich 
aremost 
common,simple 
andeasy. 


For 
I 
think 
no 
one 
believes 
that 
swimming 
or 
flying 
can 
be 
accomplished 
in 
a 
manner 
simpler 
or 
easier 
than 
that 
instinctively 
employed 
by 
fishes 
and 
birds. 


When, 
therefore, 
I 
observe 
a 
stone 
initially 
at 
rest 
falling 
from 
an 
elevated 
position 
and 
continually 
acquiring 
new 
increments 
of 
speed, 
why 
should 
I 
not 
believe 
that 
such 
increases 
take 
place 
in 
a 
manner 
which 
is 
exceedingly 
simple 
and 
rather 
obvious 
to 
everybody? 
If 
now 
we 
examine 
the 
matter 
carefully 
we 
find 
no 
addition 
or 
increment 
more 
simple 
than 
that 
which 
repeats 
itself 
always 
in 
the 
same 
manner. 
This 
we 
readily 
understand 
when 
we 
consider 
the 
intimate 
relationship 
between 
time 
and 
motion; 
for 
just 
as 
uniformity 
of 
motion 
is 
defined 
by 
and 
conceived 
through 
equal 
times 
and 
equal 
spaces 
(thus 
we 
call 
a 
motion 
uniform 
when 
equal 
distances 
are 
traversed 
during 
equal 
time-intervals), 
so 
also 
we 
may, 
in 
a 
similar 
manner, 
through 
equal 
time-intervals, 
conceive 
additions 
of 
speed 
as 
taking 
place 
withoutcomplication; 
thus 
we 
may 
picture 
to 
our 
mind 
amotion 
as 
uniformly 
and 
continuously 
accelerated 
when, 
during 
any 
equal 
intervals 
of 
time 
whatever, 
equal 
increments 
of 
speed 
are 
given 
to 
it. 
Thus 
if 
any 
equal 
intervals 
of 
time 
whatever 
have 
elapsed, 
counting 
from 
the 
time 
at 
which 
the 
moving 
body 
left 
its 
position 
of 
rest 
and 
began 
to 
descend, 
the 
amount 
of 
speedacquired 
duringthe 
first 
two 
time-intervals 
will 
be 
doublethat 
acquired 
during 
the 
first 
time-interval 
alone; 
so 
the 
amount 
added 
during 
three 
of 
these 
time-intervals 
will 
be 
treble; 
and 
that 
in 
four, 
quadruple 
that 
of 
the 
first 
time-
interval. 
To 
put 
the 
matter 
more 
clearly, 
if 
a 
body 
were 
to 
continue 
its 
motion 
with 
the 
same 
speed 
which 
it 
had 
acquired 
during 
the 
first 
time-interval 
and 
were 
to 
retain 
this 
same 
uniform 
speed, 
then 
its 
motion 
would 
be 
twice 
as 
slow 
as 
that 
which 
it 
would 
have 
if 
its 
velocity 
had 
been 
acquired 
during 
two 
time-intervals. 


And 
thus, 
it 
seems, 
we 
shall 
not 
be 
far 
wrong 
if 
we 
put 
the 
increment 
of 
speed 
as 
proportional 
to 
the 
increment 
of 
time; 
hence 
the 
definition 
of 
motion 



which 
we 
are 
about 
to 
discuss 
may 
be 
stated 
as 
follows: 
A 
motion 
is 
said 
to 
be 
uniformly 
accelerated, 
when 
starting 
from 
rest, 
it 
acquires, 
during 
equal 
time-intervals,equalincrementsofspeed. 


Sagr. 
Although 
I 
can 
offer 
no 
rational 
objection 
to 
this 
or 
indeed 
to 
any 
other 
definition, 
devised 
by 
any 
author 
whomsoever, 
since 
all 
definitions 
are 
arbitrary, 
I 
may 
nevertheless 
without 
offense 
be 
allowed 
to 
doubt 
whether 
such 
a 
definition 
as 
the 
above, 
established 
in 
an 
abstract 
manner, 
corresponds 
to 
and 
describes 
that 
kind 
of 
accelerated 
motion 
which 
we 
meet 
in 
nature 
in 
the 
case 
of 
freely 
falling 
bodies. 
And 
since 
the 
Author 
apparently 
maintains 
that 
the 
motion 
described 
in 
his 
definition 
is 
that 
of 
freely 
falling 
bodies, 
I 
would 
like 
to 
clear 
my 
mind 
of 
certain 
difficulties 
in 
order 
that 
I 
may 
later 
applymyselfmoreearnestlytothe 
propositionsand 
their 
demonstrations. 


Salv. 
It 
is 
well 
that 
you 
and 
Simplicio 
raise 
these 
difficulties. 
They 
are, 
I 
imagine, 
the 
same 
which 
occurred 
to 
me 
when 
I 
first 
saw 
this 
treatise, 
and 
which 
were 
removed 
either 
by 
discussion 
with 
the 
Author 
himself, 
or 
by 
turningthematterover 
inmyown 
mind. 
Sagr. 
When 
I 
think 
of 
a 
heavy 
body 
falling 
from 
rest, 
that 
is, 
starting 
with 
zero 
speed 
and 
gaining 
speed 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
time 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
motion; 
such 
a 
motion 
as 
would, 
for 
instance, 
in 
eight 
beats 
of 
the 
pulse 
acquire 
eight 
degrees 
of 
speed; 
having 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
fourth 
beat 
acquired 
four 
degrees; 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
second, 
two; 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
first, 
one: 
and 
since 
time 
is 
divisible 
without 
limit, 
it 
follows 
from 
all 
these 
considerations 
that 
if 
the 
earlier 
speed 
of 
a 
body 
is 
less 
than 
its 
present 
speed 
in 
a 
constant 
ratio, 
then 
there 
is 
no 
degree 
of 
speed 
however 
small 
(or, 
one 
may 
say, 
no 
degree 
of 
slowness 
however 
great) 
with 
which 
we 
may 
not 
find 
this 
body 
travelling 
after 
starting 
from 
infinite 
slowness, 
i. 
e., 
from 
rest. 
So 
that 
if 
that 
speed 
which 
it 
had 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
fourth 
beat 
was 
such 
that, 
if 
kept 
uniform, 
the 
body 
would 
traverse 
two 
miles 
in 
an 
hour, 
and 
if 
keeping 
the 
speed 
which 
it 
had 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
second 
beat, 
it 
would 
traverse 
one 
mile 
an 
hour, 
we 
must 
infer 
that, 
as 
the 
instant 
of 
starting 
is 
more 
and 
more 
nearly 
approached, 
thebody 
moves 
so 
slowlythat, 
if 
it 
kepton 
moving 
atthisrate, 
it 
would 
not 
traverse 
a 
mile 
in 
an 
hour, 
or 
in 
a 
day, 
or 
in 
a 
year 
or 
in 
a 
thousand 
years; 
indeed, 
it 
would 
not 
traverse 
a 
span 
in 
an 
even 
greater 
time; 
a 
phenomenon 
which 
baffles 
the 
imagination, 
while 
our 
senses 
show 
us 
that 
a 
heavy 
fallingbodysuddenlyacquiresgreatspeed. 



Salv. 
Thisisone 
of 
the 
difficulties 
which 
Ialso 
atthe 
beginning, 
experienced, 
but 
which 
I 
shortly 
afterwards 
removed; 
and 
the 
removal 
was 
effected 
by 
the 
very 
experiment 
which 
creates 
the 
difficulty 
for 
you. 
You 
say 
the 
experiment 
appears 
to 
show 
that 
immediately 
after 
a 
heavy 
body 
starts 
from 
rest 
it 
acquires 
a 
very 
considerable 
speed: 
and 
I 
say 
that 
the 
same 
experiment 
makes 
clear 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
initial 
motions 
of 
a 
falling 
body, 
no 
matter 
how 
heavy, 
are 
very 
slow 
and 
gentle. 
Place 
a 
heavy 
body 
upon 
a 
yielding 
material, 
and 
leave 
it 
there 
without 
any 
pressure 
except 
that 
owing 
to 
its 
own 
weight; 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
if 
one 
lifts 
this 
body 
a 
cubit 
or 
two 
and 
allows 
it 
to 
fall 
upon 
the 
samematerial, 
itwill,withthisimpulse,exertanewandgreaterpressure 
than 
that 
caused 
by 
its 
mere 
weight; 
and 
this 
effect 
is 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
[weight 
of 
the] 
falling 
body 
together 
with 
the 
velocity 
acquired 
during 
the 
fall, 
an 
effect 
which 
will 
be 
greater 
and 
greater 
according 
to 
the 
height 
of 
the 
fall, 
that 
is 
according 
as 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
falling 
body 
becomes 
greater. 
From 
the 
quality 
and 
intensity 
of 
the 
blow 
we 
are 
thus 
enabled 
to 
accurately 
estimate 
the 
speed 
of 
a 
falling 
body. 
But 
tell 
me, 
gentlemen, 
is 
it 
not 
true 
that 
if 
a 
block 
be 
allowed 
to 
fall 
upon 
a 
stake 
from 
a 
height 
of 
four 
cubits 
and 
drives 
it 
into 
the 
earth, 
say, 
four 
finger-breadths, 
that 
coming 
from 
a 
height 
of 
two 
cubits 
it 
will 
drive 
the 
stake 
a 
much 
less 
distance, 
and 
from 
the 
height 
of 
one 
cubit 
a 
still 
less 
distance; 
and 
finally 
if 
the 
block 
be 
lifted 
only 
one 
finger-breadth 
how 
much 
more 
will 
it 
accomplish 
than 
if 
merely 
laid 
on 
top 
of 
the 
stake 
without 
percussion? 
Certainly 
very 
little. 
If 
it 
be 
lifted 
only 
the 
thickness 
of 
a 
leaf, 
the 
effect 
will 
be 
altogether 
imperceptible. 
And 
since 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
blow 
depends 
upon 
the 
velocity 
of 
this 
striking 
body, 
can 
any 
one 
doubt 
the 
motion 
is 
very 
slow 
and 
the 
speed 
more 
than 
small 
whenever 
the 
effect 
[of 
the 
blow] 
is 
imperceptible? 
See 
now 
the 
power 
of 
truth; 
the 
same 
experiment 
which 
at 
first 
glance 
seemed 
to 
show 
one 
thing, 
when 
more 
carefullyexamined,assures 
usofthecontrary. 


But 
without 
depending 
upon 
the 
above 
experiment, 
which 
is 
doubtless 
very 
conclusive, 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
it 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
difficult 
to 
establish 
such 
a 
fact 
by 
reasoning 
alone. 
Imagine 
a 
heavy 
stone 
held 
in 
the 
air 
at 
rest; 
the 
support 
is 
removed 
and 
the 
stone 
set 
free; 
then 
since 
it 
is 
heavier 
than 
the 
air 
it 
begins 
to 
fall, 
and 
not 
with 
uniform 
motion 
but 
slowly 
at 
the 
beginning 
and 
with 
a 
continuously 
accelerated 
motion. 
Now 
since 
velocity 
can 
be 
increased 
and 
diminished 
without 
limit, 
what 
reason 
is 
there 
to 
believe 
that 
such 
a 
moving 
body 
starting 
with 
infinite 
slowness, 
that 
is, 
from 
rest, 
immediately 
acquires 
a 
speed 
of 
ten 
degrees 
rather 
than 
one 
of 
four, 
or 
of 



two,orof 
one, 
orofahalf, 
orofahundredth;or,indeed,ofanyoftheinfinite 
number 
of 
small 
values 
[of 
speed]? 
Pray 
listen. 
I 
hardly 
think 
you 
will 
refuse 
to 
grant 
that 
the 
gain 
of 
speed 
of 
the 
stone 
falling 
from 
rest 
follows 
the 
same 
sequence 
as 
the 
diminution 
and 
loss 
of 
this 
same 
speed 
when, 
by 
some 
impellingforce, 
thestone 
is 
thrown 
toits 
former 
elevation: 
buteven 
if 
you 
do 
not 
grant 
this, 
I 
do 
not 
see 
how 
you 
can 
doubt 
that 
the 
ascending 
stone, 
diminishing 
in 
speed, 
must 
before 
coming 
to 
rest 
pass 
through 
every 
possible 
degreeof 
slowness. 


Simp. 
But 
if 
the 
number 
of 
degrees 
of 
greater 
and 
greater 
slowness 
is 
limitless, 
they 
will 
never 
be 
all 
exhausted, 
therefore 
such 
an 
ascending 
heavy 
body 
will 
never 
reach 
rest, 
but 
will 
continue 
to 
move 
without 
limit 
always 
at 
a 
slowerrate;butthisisnottheobserved 
fact. 


Salv. 
This 
would 
happen, 
Simplicio, 
if 
the 
moving 
body 
were 
to 
maintain 
its 
speed 
for 
any 
length 
of 
time 
at 
each 
degree 
of 
velocity; 
but 
it 
merely 
passes 
each 
point 
without 
delaying 
more 
than 
an 
instant: 
and 
since 
each 
time-
interval 
however 
small 
may 
be 
divided 
into 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
instants, 
these 
will 
always 
be 
sufficient 
[in 
number] 
to 
correspond 
to 
the 
infinite 
degreesofdiminishedvelocity. 


That 
such 
a 
heavy 
rising 
body 
does 
not 
remain 
for 
any 
length 
of 
time 
at 
any 
given 
degree 
of 
velocity 
is 
evident 
from 
the 
following: 
because 
if, 
some 
time-interval 
having 
been 
assigned, 
the 
body 
moves 
with 
the 
same 
speed 
in 
the 
last 
as 
in 
the 
first 
instant 
of 
that 
time-interval, 
it 
could 
from 
this 
second 
degree 
of 
elevation 
be 
in 
like 
manner 
raised 
through 
an 
equal 
height, 
just 
as 
it 
was 
transferred 
from 
the 
first 
elevation 
to 
the 
second, 
and 
by 
the 
same 
reasoning 
would 
pass 
from 
the 
second 
to 
the 
third 
and 
would 
finally 
continue 
inuniformmotionforever. 


Sagr. 
From 
these 
considerations 
it 
appears 
to 
me 
that 
we 
may 
obtain 
a 
proper 
solution 
of 
the 
problem 
discussed 
by 
philosophers, 
namely, 
what 
causes 
the 
acceleration 
in 
the 
natural 
motion 
of 
heavy 
bodies? 
Since, 
as 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
the 
force 
[virtù] 
impressed 
by 
the 
agent 
projecting 
the 
body 
upwards 
diminishes 
continuously, 
this 
force, 
so 
long 
asitwas 
greater 
than 
thecontrary 
force 
of 
gravitation, 
impelled 
the 
body 
upwards; 
when 
the 
two 
are 
in 
equilibrium 
the 
body 
ceases 
to 
rise 
and 
passes 
through 
the 
state 
of 
rest 
in 
which 
the 
impressed 
impetus 
[impeto] 
is 
not 
destroyed, 
but 
only 
its 
excess 



over 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
body 
has 
been 
consumed 
— 
the 
excess 
which 
caused 
the 
body 
to 
rise. 
Then 
as 
the 
diminution 
of 
the 
outside 
impetus 
[impeto] 
continues, 
and 
gravitation 
gains 
the 
upper 
hand, 
the 
fall 
begins, 
but 
slowly 
at 
first 
on 
account 
of 
the 
opposing 
impetus 
[virtù 
impressa], 
a 
large 
portion 
of 
which 
still 
remains 
in 
the 
body; 
but 
as 
this 
continues 
to 
diminish 
it 
also 
continues 
to 
be 
more 
and 
more 
overcome 
by 
gravity, 
hence 
the 
continuous 
acceleration 
ofmotion. 


Simp. 
The 
idea 
is 
clever, 
yet 
more 
subtle 
than 
sound; 
for 
even 
if 
the 
argument 
were 
conclusive, 
it 
would 
explain 
only 
the 
case 
in 
which 
a 
natural 
motion 
is 
preceded 
by 
a 
violent 
motion, 
in 
which 
there 
still 
remains 
active 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
external 
force 
[virtù 
esterna]; 
but 
where 
there 
is 
no 
such 
remaining 
portion 
and 
the 
body 
starts 
from 
an 
antecedent 
state 
of 
rest, 
the 
cogency 
of 
thewhole 
argument 
fails. 
Sagr. 
I 
believe 
that 
you 
are 
mistaken 
and 
that 
this 
distinction 
between 
cases 
which 
you 
make 
is 
superfluous 
or 
rather 
nonexistent. 
But, 
tell 
me, 
cannot 
a 
projectile 
receive 
from 
the 
projector 
either 
a 
large 
or 
a 
small 
force 
[virtù] 
such 
as 
will 
throw 
it 
to 
a 
height 
of 
a 
hundred 
cubits, 
and 
even 
twenty 
or 
four 
orone? 


Undoubtedly,yes. 


Sagr. 
So 
therefore 
this 
impressed 
force 
[virtù 
impressa] 
may 
exceed 
the 
resistance 
of 
gravity 
so 
slightly 
as 
to 
raise 
it 
only 
a 
finger-breadth; 
and 
finally 
the 
force 
[virtù] 
of 
the 
projector 
may 
be 
just 
large 
enough 
to 
exactly 
balance 
the 
resistance 
of 
gravity 
so 
that 
the 
body 
is 
not 
lifted 
at 
all 
but 
merely 
sustained. 
When 
one 
holds 
a 
stone 
in 
his 
hand 
does 
he 
do 
anything 
but 
give 
it 
a 
force 
impelling 
[virtù 
impellente] 
it 
upwards 
equal 
to 
the 
power 
[facoltà]of 
gravity 
drawing 
it 
downwards? 
And 
do 
you 
not 
continuously 
impress 
this 
force 
[virtù] 
upon 
the 
stone 
as 
long 
as 
you 
hold 
it 
in 
the 
hand? 
Does 
it 
perhapsdiminishwiththe 
timeduringwhichoneholdsthe 
stone? 


And 
what 
does 
it 
matter 
whether 
this 
support 
which 
prevents 
the 
stone 
from 
falling 
is 
furnished 
by 
one’s 
hand 
or 
by 
a 
table 
or 
by 
a 
rope 
from 
which 
it 
hangs? 
Certainly 
nothing 
at 
all. 
You 
must 
conclude, 
therefore, 
Simplicio, 
that 
it 
makes 
no 
difference 
whatever 
whether 
the 
fall 
of 
the 
stone 
is 
preceded 
by 
a 
period 
of 
rest 
which 
is 
long, 
short, 
or 
instantaneous 
provided 
only 
the 
fall 
does 
not 
take 
place 
so 
long 
as 
the 
stone 
is 
acted 
upon 
by 
a 
force

Salv. 
The 
present 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
be 
the 
proper 
time 
to 
investigate 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
acceleration 
of 
natural 
motion 
concerning 
which 
various 
opinions 
have 
been 
expressed 
by 
various 
philosophers, 
some 
explaining 
it 
by 
attraction 
to 
the 
center, 
others 
to 
repulsion 
between 
the 
very 
small 
parts 
of 
the 
body, 
while 
still 
others 
attribute 
it 
to 
a 
certain 
stress 
in 
the 
surrounding 
medium 
which 
closes 
in 
behind 
the 
falling 
body 
and 
drives 
it 
from 
one 
of 
its 
positions 
to 
another. 
Now, 
all 
these 
fantasies, 
and 
others 
too, 
ought 
to 
be 
examined; 
but 
it 
is 
not 
really 
worth 
while. 
At 
present 
it 
is 
the 
purpose 
of 
our 
Author 
merely 
to 
investigate 
and 
to 
demonstrate 
some 
of 
the 
properties 
of 
accelerated 
motion 
(whatever 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
acceleration 
may 
be) 
— 
meaning 
thereby 
a 
motion, 
such 
that 
the 
momentum 
of 
its 
velocity 
[i 
momenti 
della 
sua 
velocità] 
goes 
on 
increasing 
after 
departure 
from 
rest, 
in 
simple 
proportionality 
to 
the 
time, 
which 
is 
the 
same 
as 
saying 
that 
in 
equal 
time-intervals 
the 
body 
receives 
equal 
increments 
of 
velocity; 
and 
if 
we 
find 
the 
properties 
[of 
accelerated 
motion] 
which 
will 
be 
demonstrated 
later 
are 
realized 
in 
freely 
falling 
and 
accelerated 
bodies, 
we 
may 
conclude 
that 
the 
assumed 
definition 
includes 
such 
a 
motion 
of 
falling 
bodies 
and 
that 
their 
speed 
[accelerazione] 
goeson 
increasingas 
the 
timeand 
thedurationofthemotion. 


So 
far 
as 
I 
see 
at 
present, 
the 
definition 
might 
have 
been 
put 
a 
little 
more 
clearly 
perhaps 
without 
changing 
the 
fundamental 
idea, 
namely, 
uniformly 
accelerated 
motion 
is 
such 
that 
its 
speed 
increases 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
space 
traversed; 
so 
that, 
for 
example, 
the 
speed 
acquired 
by 
a 
body 
in 
falling 
four 
cubits 
would 
be 
double 
that 
acquired 
in 
falling 
two 
cubits 
and 
this 
latter 
speed 
would 
be 
double 
that 
acquired 
in 
the 
first 
cubit. 
Because 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
but 
that 
a 
heavy 
body 
falling 
from 
the 
height 
of 
six 
cubits 
has, 
and 
strikes 
with, 
a 
momentum 
[impeto] 
double 
that 
it 
had 
at 
the 
end 
of 
three 
cubits,triplethatwhichit 
hadat 
the 
endof 
one. 


Salv. 
It 
is 
very 
comforting 
to 
me 
to 
have 
had 
such 
a 
companion 
in 
error; 
and 
moreover 
let 
me 
tell 
you 
that 
your 
proposition 
seems 
so 
highly 
probable 
that 
our 
Author 
himself 
admitted, 
when 
I 
advanced 
this 
opinion 
to 
him, 
that 
he 
had 
for 
some 
time 
shared 
the 
same 
fallacy. 
But 
what 
most 
surprised 
me 
was 
to 
see 
two 
propositions 
so 
inherently 
probable 
that 
they 
commanded 
the 
assent 
of 
everyone 
to 
whom 
they 
were 
presented, 
proven 
in 
a 
few 
simple 
words 
tobenotonly 
false,butimpossible. 



Simp. 
I 
am 
one 
of 
those 
who 
accept 
the 
proposition, 
and 
believe 
that 
a 
falling 
body 
acquires 
force 
[vires] 
in 
its 
descent, 
its 
velocity 
increasing 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
space, 
and 
that 
the 
momentum 
[momento] 
of 
the 
falling 
body 
is 
doubled 
when 
it 
falls 
from 
a 
doubled 
height; 
these 
propositions, 
it 
appears 
to 
me,oughttobe 
concededwithouthesitationorcontroversy. 


Salv. 
And 
yet 
they 
are 
as 
false 
and 
impossible 
as 
that 
motion 
should 
be 
completed 
instantaneously; 
and 
here 
is 
a 
very 
clear 
demonstration 
of 
it. 
If 
the 
velocities 
are 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
spaces 
traversed, 
or 
to 
be 
traversed, 
then 
these 
spaces 
are 
traversed 
in 
equal 
intervals 
of 
time; 
if, 
therefore, 
the 
velocity 
with 
which 
the 
falling 
body 
traverses 
a 
space 
of 
eight 
feet 
were 
double 
that 
with 
which 
it 
covered 
the 
first 
four 
feet 
(just 
as 
the 
one 
distance 
is 
double 
the 
other) 
then 
the 
time-intervals 
required 
for 
these 
passages 
would 
be 
equal. 
But 
for 
one 
and 
the 
same 
body 
to 
fall 
eight 
feet 
and 
four 
feet 
in 
the 
same 
time 
is 
possible 
only 
in 
the 
case 
of 
instantaneous 
[discontinuous] 
motion; 
but 
observation 
shows 
us 
that 
the 
motion 
of 
a 
falling 
body 
occupies 
time, 
and 
less 
of 
it 
in 
covering 
a 
distance 
of 
four 
feet 
than 
of 
eight 
feet; 
therefore 
it 
is 
nottruethatitsvelocityincreasesinproportionto 
the 
space. 


The 
falsity 
of 
the 
other 
proposition 
may 
be 
shown 
with 
equal 
clearness. 
For 
if 
we 
consider 
a 
single 
striking 
body 
the 
difference 
of 
momentum 
in 
its 
blows 
can 
depend 
only 
upon 
difference 
of 
velocity; 
for 
if 
the 
striking 
body 
falling 
from 
a 
double 
height 
were 
to 
deliver 
a 
blow 
of 
double 
momentum, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
for 
this 
body 
to 
strike 
with 
a 
doubled 
velocity; 
but 
with 
this 
doubled 
speed 
it 
would 
traverse 
a 
doubled 
space 
in 
the 
same 
time-
interval; 
observation 
however 
shows 
that 
the 
time 
required 
for 
fall 
from 
the 
greaterheight 
islonger. 


Sagr. 
You 
present 
these 
recondite 
matters 
with 
too 
much 
evidence 
and 
ease; 
this 
great 
facility 
makes 
them 
less 
appreciated 
than 
they 
would 
be 
had 
they 
been 
presented 
in 
a 
more 
abstruse 
manner. 
For, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
people 
esteem 
more 
lightly 
that 
knowledge 
which 
they 
acquire 
with 
so 
little 
labor 
than 
that 
acquiredthroughlongand 
obscure 
discussion. 


Salv. 
If 
those 
who 
demonstrate 
with 
brevity 
and 
clearness 
the 
fallacy 
of 
many 
popular 
beliefs 
were 
treated 
with 
contempt 
instead 
of 
gratitude 
the 
injury 
would 
be 
quite 
bearable; 
but 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
it 
is 
very 
unpleasant 
and 
annoying 
to 
see 
men, 
who 
claim 
to 
be 
peers 
of 
anyone 
in 
a 
certain 
field 
of 



study, 
take 
for 
granted 
certain 
conclusions 
which 
later 
are 
quickly 
and 
easily 
shown 
by 
another 
to 
be 
false. 
I 
do 
not 
describe 
such 
a 
feeling 
as 
one 
of 
envy, 
which 
usually 
degenerates 
into 
hatred 
and 
anger 
against 
those 
who 
discover 
such 
fallacies; 
I 
would 
call 
it 
a 
strong 
desire 
to 
maintain 
old 
errors, 
rather 
than 
accept 
newly 
discovered 
truths. 
This 
desire 
at 
times 
induces 
them 
to 
unite 
against 
these 
truths, 
although 
at 
heart 
believing 
in 
them, 
merely 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
lowering 
the 
esteem 
in 
which 
certain 
others 
are 
held 
by 
the 
unthinking 
crowd. 
Indeed, 
I 
have 
heard 
from 
our 
Academician 
many 
such 
fallaciesheld 
astrue 
but 
easilyrefutable;someoftheseIhaveinmind. 
Sagr. 
You 
must 
not 
withhold 
them 
from 
us, 
but, 
at 
the 
proper 
time, 
tell 
us 
about 
them 
even 
though 
an 
extra 
session 
be 
necessary. 
But 
now, 
continuing 
the 
thread 
of 
our 
talk, 
it 
would 
seem 
that 
up 
to 
the 
present 
we 
have 
established 
the 
definition 
of 
uniformly 
accelerated 
motion 
which 
is 
expressed 
asfollows: 


A 
motion 
is 
said 
to 
be 
equally 
or 
uniformly 
accelerated 
when, 
starting 
from 
rest, 
its 
momentum 
(celeritatis 
momenta) 
receives 
equal 
increments 
in 
equaltimes. 


Salv. 
This 
definition 
established, 
the 
Author 
makes 
a 
single 
assumption, 
namely, 


The 
speeds 
acquired 
by 
one 
and 
the 
same 
body 
moving 
down 
planes 
of 
differentinclinationsareequalwhentheheightsof 
theseplanesareequal. 


By 
the 
height 
of 
an 
inclined 
plane 
we 
mean 
the 
perpendicular 
let 
fall 
from 
the 
upper 
end 
of 
the 
plane 
upon 
the 
horizontal 
line 
drawn 
through 
the 
lower 
end 
of 
the 
same 
plane. 
Thus, 
to 
illustrate, 
let 
the 
line 
AB 
be 
horizontal, 
and 
let 
the 
planes 
CA 
and 
CD 
be 
inclined 
to 
it; 
then 
the 
Author 
calls 
the 
perpendicular 
CB 
the 
“height” 
of 
the 
planes 
CA 
and 
CD; 
he 
supposes 
that 
the 
speeds 
acquired 
by 
one 
and 
the 
same 
body, 
descending 
along 
the 
planes 
CA 
and 
CD 
to 
the 
terminal 
points 
A 
and 
D 
are 
equal 
since 
the 
heights 
of 
these 
planes 
are 
the 
same, 
CB; 
and 
also 
it 
must 
be 
understood 
that 
this 
speed 
is 
that 
which 
wouldbeacquiredbythesamebodyfalling 
fromCto 
B. 


Sagr. 
Your 
assumption 
appears 
to 
me 
so 
reasonable 
that 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
conceded 
without 
question, 
provided 
of 
course 
there 
are 
no 
chance 
or 
outside 
resistances, 
and 
that 
the 
planes 
are 
hard 
and 
smooth, 
and 
that 
the 
figure 
of 
the 
moving 
body 
is 
perfectly 
round, 
so 
that 
neither 
plane 
nor 
moving 
body 
is 
rough. 
All 
resistance 
and 
opposition 
having 
been 
removed, 
my 
reason 
tells 



me 
at 
once 
that 
a 
heavy 
and 
perfectly 
round 
ball 
descending 
along 
the 
lines 
CA, 
CD, 
CB 
would 
reach 
the 
terminal 
points 
A, 
D, 
B, 
with 
equal 
momenta 


[impetieguali].
Salv. 
Your 
words 
are 
very 
plausible; 
but 
I 
hope 
by 
experiment 
to 
increase 
the 
probabilitytoanextent 
whichshallbe 
littleshortofarigiddemonstration. 



This 
experiment 
leaves 
no 
room 
for 
doubt 
as 
to 
the 
truth 
of 
our 
supposition; 
for 
since 
the 
two 
arcs 
CB 
and 
DB 
are 
equal 
and 
similarly 
placed, 
themomentum[momento]acquiredby 
thefallthroughthearcCB 
isthesame 
as 
that 
gained 
by 
fall 
through 
the 
arc 
DB; 
but 
the 
momentum 
[momento] 
acquired 
at 
B, 
owing 
to 
fall 
through 
CB, 
is 
able 
to 
lift 
the 
same 
body 
[mobile] 
through 
the 
arc 
BD; 
therefore, 
the 
momentum 
acquired 
in 
the 
fall 
BD 
is 
equal 
to 
that 
which 
lifts 
the 
same 
body 
through 
the 
same 
arc 
from 
B 
to 
D; 
so, 
in 
general, 
every 
momentum 
acquired 
by 
fall 
through 
an 
arc 
is 
equal 
to 
that 
which 
can 
lift 
the 
same 
body 
through 
the 
same 
arc. 
But 
all 
these 
momenta 
[momenti] 
which 
cause 
a 
rise 
through 
the 
arcs 
BD, 
BG, 
and 
BI 
are 
equal, 
since 
they 
are 
produced 
by 
the 
same 
momentum, 
gained 
by 
fall 
through 
CB, 
as 
experiment 
shows. 
Therefore 
all 
the 
momenta 
gained 
by 
fall 
through 
the 
arcsDB,GB,IB 
areequal. 


Sagr. 
The 
argument 
seems 
to 
me 
so 
conclusive 
and 
the 
experiment 
so 
well 
adapted 
to 
establish 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
we 
may, 
indeed, 
consider 
it 
as 
demonstrated. 


Salv. 
I 
do 
not 
wish, 
Sagredo, 
that 
we 
trouble 
ourselves 
too 
much 
about 
this 
matter, 
since 
we 
are 
going 
to 
apply 
this 
principle 
mainly 
in 
motions 
which 
occur 
on 
plane 
surfaces, 
and 
not 
upon 
curved, 
along 
which 
acceleration 



varies 
in 
a 
manner 
greatly 
different 
from 
that 
which 
we 
have 
assumed 
for 
planes. 


So 
that, 
although 
the 
above 
experiment 
shows 
us 
that 
the 
descent 
of 
the 
moving 
body 
through 
the 
arc 
CB 
confers 
upon 
it 
momentum 
[momento] 
just 
sufficient 
to 
carry 
it 
to 
the 
same 
height 
through 
any 
of 
the 
arcs 
BD, 
BG, 
BI, 
we 
are 
not 
able, 
by 
similar 
means, 
to 
show 
that 
the 
event 
would 
be 
identical 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
perfectly 
round 
ball 
descending 
along 
planes 
whose 
inclinations 
are 
respectively 
the 
same 
as 
the 
chords 
of 
these 
arcs. 
It 
seems 
likely, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
that, 
since 
these 
planes 
form 
angles 
at 
the 
point 
B, 
they 
will 
present 
an 
obstacle 
to 
the 
ball 
which 
has 
descended 
along 
the 
chord 
CB,andstarts 
torisealong 
the 
chordBD,BG,BI. 


In 
striking 
these 
planes 
some 
of 
its 
momentum 
[impeto] 
will 
be 
lost 
and 
it 
will 
not 
be 
able 
to 
rise 
to 
the 
height 
of 
the 
line 
CD; 
but 
this 
obstacle, 
which 
interferes 
with 
the 
experiment, 
once 
removed, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
momentum 
[impeto] 
(which 
gains 
in 
strength 
with 
descent) 
will 
be 
able 
to 
carry 
the 
body 
to 
the 
same 
height. 
Let 
us 
then, 
for 
the 
present, 
take 
this 
as 
a 
postulate, 
the 
absolute 
truth 
of 
which 
will 
be 
established 
when 
we 
find 
that 
the 
inferences 
from 
it 
correspond 
to 
and 
agree 
perfectly 
with 
experiment. 
The 
author 
having 
assumed 
this 
single 
principle 
passes 
next 
to 
the 
propositions 
which 
he 
clearly 
demonstrates;thefirst 
oftheseisas 
follows: 


Theorem 
I, 
PropositionI 


The 
time 
in 
which 
any 
space 
is 
traversed 
by 
a 
body 
starting 
from 
rest 
and 
uniformly 
accelerated 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
time 
in 
which 
that 
same 
space 
would 
be 
traversed 
by 
the 
same 
body 
moving 
at 
a 
uniform 
speed 
whose 
value 
is 
the 
meanofthehighestspeedandthe 
speed 
justbefore 
accelerationbegan. 


Let 
us 
represent 
by 
the 
line 
AB 
the 
time 
in 
which 
the 
space 
CD 
is 
traversed 
by 
a 
body 
which 
starts 
from 
rest 
at 
C 
and 
is 
uniformly 
accelerated; 
let 
the 
final 
and 
highest 
value 
of 
the 
speed 
gained 
during 
the 
interval 
AB 
be 
represented 
by 
the 
line 
EB 
drawn 
at 
right 
angles 
to 
AB; 
draw 
the 
line 
AE, 
then 
all 
lines 
drawn 
from 
equidistant 
points 
on 
AB 
and 
parallel 
to 
BE 
will 
represent 
the 
increasing 
values 
of 
the 
speed, 
beginning 
with 
the 
instant 
A. 
Let 
the 
point 
F 
bisect 
the 
line 
EB; 
draw 
FG 
parallel 
to 
BA, 
and 
GA 
parallel 
to 
FB, 
thus 
forming 
a 
parallel-ogram 
AGFB 
which 
will 
be 
equal 
in 
area 
to 
the 
triangle 
AEB, 
since 
the 
side 
GF 
bisects 
the 
side 
AE 
at 
the 
point 
I; 
for 
if 
the 
parallel 
lines 
in 
the 
triangle 
AEB 
are 
extended 
to 
GI, 
then 
the 
sum 
of 
all 
the 



parallels 
contained 
in 
the 
quadrilateral 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
those 
contained 
in 
the 
triangle 
AEB; 
for 
those 
in 
the 
triangle 
IEF 
are 
equal 
to 
those 
contained 
in 
the 
triangle 
GIA, 
while 
those 
included 
in 
the 
trapezium 
AIFB 
are 
common. 
Since 
each 
and 
every 
instant 
of 
time 
in 
the 
time-interval 
AB 
has 
its 
corresponding 
point 
on 
the 
line 
AB, 
from 
which 
points 
parallels 
drawn 
in 
and 
limited 
by 
the 
triangle 
AEB 
represent 
the 
increasing 
values 
of 
the 
growing 
velocity, 
and 
since 
parallels 
contained 
within 
the 
rectangle 
represent 
the 
values 
of 
a 
speed 
which 
is 
not 
increasing, 
but 
constant, 
it 
appears, 
in 
like 
manner, 
that 
the 
momenta 
[momenta] 
assumed 
by 
the 
moving 
body 
may 
also 
be 
represented, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
accelerated 
motion, 
by 
the 
increasing 
parallels 
of 
the 
triangle 
AEB, 
and, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
uniform 
motion, 
by 
the 
parallels 
of 
the 
rectangle 
GB. 
For, 
what 
the 
momenta 
may 
lack 
in 
the 
first 
part 
of 
the 
accelerated 
motion 
(the 
deficiency 
of 
the 
momenta 
being 
represented 
by 
the 
parallels 
of 
the 
triangle 
AGI) 
is 
made 
up 
by 
the 
momenta 
representedbytheparallels 
ofthetriangle 
IEF. 



Hence 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
equal 
spaces 
will 
be 
traversed 
in 
equal 
times 
by 
two 
bodies, 
one 
of 
which, 
starting 
from 
rest, 
moves 
with 
a 
uniform 
acceleration, 
while 
the 
momentum 
of 
the 
other, 
moving 
with 
uniform 
speed, 
is 
one-half 
its 
maximummomentumunderacceleratedmotion.

TheoremII, 
PropositionII 


The 
spaces 
describedby 
abody 
falling 
from 
rest 
with 
a 
uniformlyaccelerated 
motion 
are 
to 
each 
other 
as 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
time-intervals 
employed 
in 
traversingthesedistances. 


Let 
the 
time 
beginning 
with 
any 
instant 
A 
be 
represented 
by 
the 
straight 
line 
AB 
in 
which 
are 
taken 
any 
two 
time-intervals 
AD 
and 
AE. 
Let 
HI 
represent 
the 
distance 
through 
which 
the 
body, 
starting 
from 
rest 
at 
H, 
falls 



with 
uniform 
acceleration. 
If 
HL 
represents 
the 
space 
traversed 
during 
the 
time-intervalAD,andHM 
thatcoveredduring 
theintervalAE,then 
thespace 
MH 
stands 
to 
the 
space 
LH 
in 
a 
ratio 
which 
is 
the 
square 
of 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
time 
AE 
to 
the 
timeAD;or 
wemay 
saysimply 
thatthedistances 
HM 
and 
HL 


arerelatedasthesquaresofAEandAD.
Draw 
the 
line 
AC 
making 
any 
angle 
whatever 
with 
the 
line 
AB; 
and 
from 
the 
points 
D 
and 
E, 
draw 
the 
parallel 
lines 
DO 
and 
EP; 
of 
these 
two 
lines, 
DO 
represents 
the 
greatest 
velocity 
attained 
during 
the 
interval 
AD, 
while 
EP 
represents 
the 
maximum 
velocity 
acquired 
during 
the 
interval 
AE. 
But 
it 
has 
justbeenprovedthatsofarasdistances 
traversedare 
concerneditis 
precisely 
the 
same 
whether 
a 
body 
falls 
from 
rest 
with 
a 
uniform 
acceleration 
or 
whether 
it 
falls 
during 
an 
equal 
time-interval 
with 
a 
constant 
speed 
which 
is 
one-half 
the 
maximum 
speed 
attained 
during 
the 
accelerated 
motion. 
It 
follows 
therefore 
that 
the 
distances 
HM 
and 
HL 
are 
the 
same 
as 
would 
be 



traversed, 
during 
the 
time-intervals 
AE 
and 
AD, 
by 
uniform 
velocities 
equal 
to 
one-half 
those 
represented 
by 
DO 
and 
EP 
respectively. 
If, 
therefore, 
one 
can 
show 
that 
the 
distances 
HM 
and 
HL 
are 
in 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
squares 
ofthetime-intervalsAEand 
AD, 
our 
propositionwill 
beproven. 


q. 
e. 
d. 
Evidently 
then 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
distances 
is 
the 
square 
of 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
final 
velocities, 
that 
is, 
of 
the 
lines 
EP 
and 
DO, 
since 
these 
are 
to 
each 
other 
asAEto 
AD. 


CorollaryI 


Hence 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
if 
we 
take 
any 
equal 
intervals 
of 
time 
whatever, 
counting 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
motion, 
such 
as 
AD, 
DE, 
EF, 
FG, 
in 
which 
the 
spaces 
HL, 
LM, 
MN, 
NI 
are 
traversed, 
these 
spaces 
will 
bear 
to 
one 
another 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
series 
of 
odd 
numbers, 
1, 
3, 
5, 
7; 
for 
this 
is 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
differences 
of 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
lines 
[which 
represent 
time], 
differences 
which 
exceed 
one 
another 
by 
equal 
amounts, 
this 
excess 
being 
equal 
to 
the 
smallest 
line 
[viz. 
the 
one 
representing 
a 
single 
time-interval]: 
or 
we 
may 
say 
[that 
this 
is 
the 
ratio] 
of 
the 
differences 
of 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
naturalnumbers 
beginningwithunity. 


While, 
therefore, 
during 
equal 
intervals 
of 
time 
the 
velocities 
increase 
as 
the 
natural 
numbers, 
the 
increments 
in 
the 
distances 
traversed 
during 
these 
equal 
time-intervals 
are 
to 
one 
another 
as 
the 
odd 
numbers 
beginning 
with 
unity. 


Sagr. 
Please 
suspend 
the 
discussion 
for 
a 
moment 
since 
there 
just 
occurs 
to 
me 
an 
idea 
which 
I 
want 
to 
illustrate 
by 
means 
of 
a 
diagram 
in 
order 
that 
it 
maybe 
clearer 
bothtoyouandtome. 


Let 
the 
line 
AI 
represent 
the 
lapse 
of 
time 
measured 
from 
the 
initial 
instant 
A; 
through 
A 
draw 
the 
straight 
line 
AF 
making 
any 
angle 
whatever; 
join 
the 
terminal 
points 
I 
and 
F; 
divide 
the 
time 
AI 
in 
half 
at 
C; 
draw 
CB 
parallel 
to 
IF. 
Let 
us 
consider 
CB 
as 
the 
maximum 
value 
of 
the 
velocity 
which 
increases 
from 
zero 
at 
the 
beginning, 
in 
simple 
proportionality 
to 
the 
intercepts 
on 
the 
triangle 
ABC 
of 
lines 
drawn 
parallel 
to 
BC; 
or 
what 
is 
the 
same 
thing, 
let 
us 
suppose 
the 
velocity 
to 
increase 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
time; 
then 
I 
admit 
without 
question, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
preceding 
argument, 
that 
the 
space 
described 
by 
a 
body 
falling 
in 
the 
aforesaid 
manner 
will 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
space 
traversed 



by 
the 
same 
body 
during 
the 
same 
length 
of 
time 
travelling 
with 
a 
uniform 
speed 
equal 
to 
EC, 
the 
half 
of 
BC. 
Further 
let 
us 
imagine 
that 
the 
body 
has 
fallen 
with 
accelerated 
motion 
so 
that, 
at 
the 
instant 
C, 
it 
has 
the 
velocity 
BC. 
It 
is 
clear 
that 
if 
the 
body 
continued 
to 
descend 
with 
the 
same 
speed 
BC, 
without 
acceleration, 
it 
would 
in 
the 
next 
time-interval 
CI 
traverse 
double 
the 
distance 
covered 
during 
the 
interval 
AC, 
with 
the 
uniform 
speed 
EC 
which 
is 
half 
of 
BC; 
but 
since 
the 
falling 
body 
acquires 
equal 
increments 
of 
speed 
during 
equal 
increments 
of 
time, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
velocity 
BC, 
during 
the 
next 
time-interval 
CI 
will 
be 
increased 
by 
an 
amount 
represented 
by 
the 
parallels 
of 
the 
triangle 
BFG 
which 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
triangle 
ABC. 
If, 
then, 
one 
adds 
to 
the 
velocity 
GI 
half 
of 
the 
velocity 
FG, 
the 
highest 
speed 
acquired 
by 
the 
accelerated 
motion 
and 
determined 
by 
the 
parallels 
of 
the 
triangle 
BFG, 
he 
will 
have 
the 
uniform 
velocity 
with 
which 
the 
same 
space 
would 
have 
been 
described 
in 
the 
time 
CI; 
and 
since 
this 
speed 
IN 
is 
three 
times 
as 
great 
as 
EC 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
space 
described 
during 
the 
interval 
CI 
is 
three 
times 
as 
great 
as 
that 
described 
during 
the 
interval 
AC. 
Let 
us 
imagine 
the 
motion 
extended 
over 
another 
equal 
time-interval 
IO, 
and 
the 
triangle 
extended 
to 
APO; 
it 
is 
then 
evident 
that 
if 
the 
motion 
continues 
during 
the 
interval 
IO, 
at 
the 
constant 
rate 
IF 
acquired 
by 
acceleration 
during 
the 
time 
AI, 
the 
space 
traversed 
during 
the 
interval 
IO 
will 
be 
four 
times 
that 
traversed 
during 
the 
first 
interval 
AC, 
because 
the 
speed 
IF 
is 
four 
times 
the 
speed 
EC. 
But 
if 
we 
enlarge 
our 
triangle 
so 
as 
to 
include 
FPQ 
which 
is 
equal 
to 
ABC, 
still 
assuming 
the 
acceleration 
to 
be 
constant, 
we 
shall 
add 
to 
the 
uniform 
speed 
an 
increment 
RQ,equal 
to 
EC; 
thenthe 
value 
of 
theequivalent 
uniform 
speed 
during 
the 
time-interval 
IO 
will 
be 
five 
times 
that 
during 
the 
first 
time-
interval 
AC; 
therefore 
the 
space 
traversed 
will 
be 
quintuple 
that 
during 
the 
first 
interval 
AC. 
It 
is 
thus 
evident 
by 
simple 
computation 
that 
a 
moving 
body 
starting 
from 
rest 
and 
acquiring 
velocity 
at 
a 
rate 
proportional 
to 
the 
time, 
will, 
during 
equal 
intervals 
of 
time, 
traverse 
distances 
which 
are 
related 
to 
each 
other 
as 
the 
odd 
numbers 
beginning 
with 
unity, 
1, 
3, 
5;32 
or 
considering 
the 
total 
space 
traversed, 
that 
covered 
in 
double 
time 
will 
be 
quadruple 
that 
covered 
during 
unit 
time; 
in 
triple 
time, 
the 
space 
is 
nine 
times 
as 
great 
as 
in 
unit 
time. 
And 
in 
general 
the 
spaces 
traversed 
are 
in 
the 
duplicate 
ratio 
of 
the 
times,i. 
e.,intheratioofthesquaresof

As

the

and

of

Simp. 
In 
truth, 
I 
find 
more 
pleasure 
in 
this 
simple 
and 
clear 
argument 
of 
Sagredo 
than 
in 
the 
Author’s 
demonstration 
which 
to 
me 
appears 
rather 
obscure; 
so 
that 
I 
am 
convinced 
that 
matters 
are 
as 
described, 
once 
having 
accepted 
the 
definition 
of 
uniformly 
accelerated 
motion. 
But 
as 
to 
whether 
this 
acceleration 
is 
that 
which 
one 
meets 
in 
nature 
in 
the 
case 
of 
falling 
bodies, 
I 
am 
still 
doubtful; 
and 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
not 
only 
for 
my 
own 
sake 
but 



also 
for 
all 
those 
who 
think 
as 
I 
do, 
that 
this 
would 
be 
the 
proper 
moment 
to 
introduce 
one 
of 
those 
experiments 
— 
and 
there 
are 
many 
of 
them, 
I 
understand 
—whichillustrateinseveralwaystheconclusionsreached. 
Salv. 
The 
request 
which 
you, 
as 
a 
man 
of 
science, 
make, 
is 
a 
very 
reasonable 
one; 
for 
this 
is 
the 
custom 
— 
and 
properly 
so 
— 
in 
those 
sciences 
where 
mathematical 
demonstrations 
are 
applied 
to 
natural 
phenomena, 
as 
is 
seen 
in 
the 
case 
of 
perspective, 
astronomy, 
mechanics, 
music, 
and 
others 
where 
the 
principles, 
once 
established 
by 
well-chosen 
experiments, 
become 
the 
foundations 
of 
the 
entire 
superstructure. 
I 
hope 
therefore 
it 
will 
not 
appear 
to 
be 
a 
waste 
of 
time 
if 
we 
discuss 
at 
considerable 
length 
this 
first 
and 
most 
fundamentalquestionupon 
whichhingenumerousconsequences 
ofwhich 
we 
have 
in 
this 
book 
only 
a 
small 
number, 
placed 
there 
by 
the 
Author, 
who 
has 
done 
so 
much 
to 
open 
a 
pathway 
hitherto 
closed 
to 
minds 
of 
speculative 
turn. 
So 
far 
as 
experiments 
go 
they 
have 
not 
been 
neglected 
by 
the 
Author; 
and 
often, 
in 
his 
company, 
I 
have 
attempted 
in 
the 
following 
manner 
to 
assure 
myself 
that 
the 
acceleration 
actually 
experienced 
by 
falling 
bodies 
is 
that 
above 
described. 


A 
piece 
of 
wooden 
moulding 
or 
scantling, 
about 
12 
cubits 
long, 
half 
a 
cubit 
wide, 
and 
three 
finger-breadths 
thick, 
was 
taken; 
on 
its 
edge 
was 
cut 
a 
channela 
little 
more 
thanone 
fingerin 
breadth;having 
made 
thisgroove 
very 
straight, 
smooth, 
and 
polished, 
and 
having 
lined 
it 
with 
parchment, 
also 
as 
smooth 
and 
polished 
as 
possible, 
we 
rolled 
along 
it 
a 
hard, 
smooth, 
and 
very 
round 
bronze 
ball. 
Having 
placed 
this 
board 
in 
a 
sloping 
position, 
by 
lifting 
one 
end 
some 
one 
or 
two 
cubits 
above 
the 
other, 
we 
rolled 
the 
ball, 
as 
I 
was 
just 
saying, 
along 
the 
channel, 
noting, 
in 
a 
manner 
presently 
to 
be 
described, 
the 
time 
required 
to 
make 
the 
descent. 
We 
repeated 
this 
experiment 
more 
than 
once 
in 
order 
to 
measure 
the 
time 
with 
an 
accuracy 
such 
that 
the 
deviation 
between 
two 
observations 
never 
exceeded 
one-tenth 
of 
a 
pulse-
beat. 
Having 
performed 
this 
operation 
and 
having 
assured 
ourselves 
of 
its 
reliability, 
we 
now 
rolled 
the 
ball 
only 
one-quarter 
the 
length 
of 
the 
channel; 
and 
havingmeasuredthetimeof 
itsdescent,wefounditprecisely 
one-half’of 
the 
former. 
Next 
we 
tried 
other 
distances, 
comparing 
the 
time 
for 
the 
whole 
length 
with 
that 
for 
the 
half, 
or 
with 
that 
for 
two-thirds, 
or 
three-fourths, 
or 
indeed 
for 
any 
fraction; 
in 
such 
experiments, 
repeated 
a 
full 
hundred 
times, 
we 
always 
found 
that 
the 
spaces 
traversed 
were 
to 
each 
other 
as 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
times, 
and 
this 
was 
true 
for 
all 
inclinations 
of 
the 
plane, 
i. 
e., 
of 
the 
channel, 
along 
which 
we 
rolled 
the 
ball. 
We 
also 
observed 
that 
the 
times 
of 



descent, 
for 
various 
inclinations 
of 
the 
plane, 
bore 
to 
one 
another 
precisely 
that 
ratio 
which, 
as 
we 
shall 
see 
later, 
the 
Author 
had 
predicted 
and 
demonstratedforthem. 


For 
the 
measurement 
of 
time, 
we 
employed 
a 
large 
vessel 
of 
water 
placed 
in 
an 
elevated 
position; 
to 
the 
bottom 
of 
this 
vessel 
was 
soldered 
a 
pipe 
of 
small 
diameter 
giving 
a 
thin 
jet 
of 
water, 
which 
we 
collected 
in 
a 
small 
glass 
during 
the 
time 
of 
each 
descent, 
whether 
for 
the 
whole 
length 
of 
the 
channel 
or 
for 
a 
part 
of 
its 
length; 
the 
water 
thus 
collected 
was 
weighed, 
after 
each 
descent, 
on 
a 
very 
accurate 
balance; 
the 
differences 
and 
ratios 
of 
these 
weights 
gave 
us 
the 
differences 
and 
ratios 
of 
the 
times, 
and 
this 
with 
such 
accuracy 
that 
although 
the 
operation 
was 
repeated 
many, 
many 
times, 
there 
was 
noappreciablediscrepancyintheresults. 


Simp. 
I 
would 
like 
to 
have 
been 
present 
at 
these 
experiments; 
but 
feeling 
confidence 
in 
the 
care 
with 
which 
you 
performed 
them, 
and 
in 
the 
fidelity 
withwhichyou

Iamsatisfiedand

Then 
we 
canproceedwithoutdiscussion. 


Secondly, 
it 
follows 
that, 
startingfrom 
any 
initial 
point, 
if 
wetakeanytwo 
distances, 
traversed 
in 
any 
time-intervals 
whatsoever, 
these 
time-intervals 
bear 
to 
one 
another 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
one 
of 
the 
distances 
to 
the 
mean 
proportionalofthetwodistances. 


For 
if 
we 
take 
two 
distances 
ST 
and 
SY 
measured 
from 
the 
initial 
point 
S, 
the 
mean 
proportional 
of 
which 
is 
SX, 
the 
time 
of 
fall 
through 
ST 
is 
to 
the 
time 
of 
fall 
through 
SY 
as 
ST 
is 
to 
SX; 
or 
one 
may 
say 
the 
time 
of 
fall 
through 
SY 
is 
to 
the 
time 
of 
fall 
through 
ST 
as 
SY 
is 
to 
SX. 
Now 
since 
it 
has 
been 
shown 
that 
the 
spaces 
traversed 
are 
in 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
times; 
and 
since, 
moreover, 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
space 
SY 
to 
the 
space 
ST 
is 
the 
square 
of 
the 
ratio 
SY 
to 
SX, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
times 
of

ST 
istheratioof

The 
above 
corollary 
has 
been 
proven 
for 
the 
case 
of 
vertical 
fall; 
but 
it 
holds 
also 
for 
planes 
inclined 
at 
any 
angle; 
for 
it 
is 
to 
be 
assumed 
that 
along 
these 
planes 
the 
velocity 
increases 
in 
the 
same 
ratio, 
that 
is,

Here, 
Sagredo, 
I 
should 
like, 
if 
it 
be 
not 
too 
tedious 
to 
Simplicio, 
to 
interrupt 
for 
a 
moment 
the 
present 
discussion 
in 
order 
to 
make 
some 
additions 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
what 
has 
already 
been 
proved 
and 
of 
what 



mechanical 
principles 
we 
have 
already 
learned 
from 
our 
Academician. 
This 
addition 
I 
make 
for 
the 
better 
establishment 
on 
logical 
and 
experimental 
grounds, 
of 
the 
principle 
which 
we 
have 
above 
considered; 
and 
what 
is 
more 
important, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
deriving 
it 
geometrically, 
after 
first 
demonstrating 
a 
single 
lemma 
which 
is 
fundamental 
in 
the 
science 
of 
motion 
[impeti]. 


Sagr. 
If 
the 
advance 
which 
you 
propose 
to 
make 
is 
such 
as 
will 
confirm 
and 
fully 
establish 
these 
sciences 
of 
motion, 
I 
will 
gladly 
devote 
to 
it 
any 
length 
of 
time. 
Indeed, 
I 
shall 
not 
only 
be 
glad 
to 
have 
you 
proceed, 
but 
I 
beg 
of 
you 
at 
once 
to 
satisfy 
the 
curiosity 
which 
you 
have 
awakened 
in 
me 
concerning 
yourproposition; 
andIthinkthatSimplicio 
isof 
thesamemind. 


Simp. 
Quiteright. 


Salv. 
Since 
then 
I 
have 
your 
permission, 
let 
us 
first 
of 
all 
consider 
this 
notable 
fact, 
that 
the 
momenta 
or 
speeds 
[i 
momenti 
o 
le 
velocità] 
of 
one 
and 
thesamemovingbodyvary 
withtheinclinationof 
the 
plane. 


The 
speed 
reaches 
a 
maximum 
along 
a 
vertical 
direction, 
and 
for 
other 
directions 
diminishes 
as 
the 
plane 
diverges 
from 
the 
vertical. 
Therefore 
the 
impetus,ability, 
energy,[l’impeto, 
il 
talento, 
l’energia] 
or, 
one 
might 
say, 
the 
momentum[il 
momento] 
of 
descent 
of 
the 
moving 
body 
is 
diminished 
by 
the 
planeuponwhich 
itissupportedand 
along 
whichitrolls. 


For 
the 
sake 
of 
greater 
clearness 
erect 
the 
line 
AB 
perpendicular 
to 
the 
horizontal 
AC; 
next 
draw 
AD, 
AE, 
AF, 
etc., 
at 
different 
inclinations 
to 
the 
horizontal. 
Then 
I 
say 
that 
all 
the 
momentum 
of 
the 
falling 
body 
is 
along 
the 
vertical 
and 
is 
a 
maximum 
when 
it 
falls 
in 
that 
direction; 
the 
momentum 
is 
less 
along 
DA 
and 
still 
less 
along 
EA, 
and 
even 
less 
yet 
along 
the 
more 
inclined 
plane 
FA. 
Finally 
on 
the 
horizontal 
plane 
the 
momentum 
vanishes 
altogether; 
the 
body 
finds 
itself 
in 
a 
condition 
of 
indifference 
as 
to 
motion 
or 
rest; 
has 
no 
inherent 
tendency 
to 
move 
in 
any 
direction, 
and 
offers 
no 
resistance 
to 
being 
set 
in 
motion. 
For 
just 
as 
a 
heavy 
body 
or 
system 
of 
bodies 
cannot 
of 
itself 
move 
upwards, 
or 
recede 
from 
the 
common 
center 
[comun 
centro] 
toward 
which 
all 
heavy 
things 
tend, 
so 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
any 
body 
of 
its 
own 
accord 
to 
assume 
any 
motion 
other 
than 
one 
which 
carries 
it 
nearer 
to 
the 
aforesaid 
common 
center. 
Hence, 
along 
the 
horizontal, 



by 
which 
we 
understand 
a 
surface, 
every 
point 
of 
which 
is 
equidistant 
from 
this 
same 
commoncenter,thebodywill 
havenomomentumwhatever. 



It 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
impelling 
force 
[impeto] 
acting 
on 
a 
body 
in 
descent 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
resistance 
or 
least 
force 
[resistenza 
o 
forza 
minima] 
sufficient 
to 
hold 
it 
at 
rest. 
In 
order 
to 
measure 
this 
force 
and 
resistance 
[forza 
e 
resistenza] 
I 
propose 
to 
use 
the 
weight 
of 
another 
body. 
Let 
us 
place 
upon 
the 
plane 
FA 
a 
body 
G 
connected 
to 
the 
weight 
H 
by 
means 
of 
a 
cord 
passing 
over 
the 
point 
F; 
then 
the 
body 
H 
will 
ascend 
or 
descend, 
along 
the 
perpendicular, 
the 
same 
distance 
which 
the 
body 
G 
ascends 
or 
descends 
along 
the 
inclined 
plane 
FA; 
but 
this 
distance 
will 
not 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
rise 
or 
fall 
of 
G 
along 
the 
vertical 
in 
which 
direction 
alone 
G, 
as 
other 
bodies, 
exerts 
its 
force 
[resistenza]. 
This 
is 
clear. 
For 
if 
we 
consider 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
body 
G, 
from 
A 
to 
F, 
in 
the 
triangle 
AFC 
to 
be 
made 
up 
of 
a 
horizontal 
component 
AC 
and 
a 
vertical 
component 
CF, 
and 
remember 
that 
this 
body 
experiences 



no 
resistance 
to 
motion 
along 
the 
horizontal 
(because 
by 
such 
a 
motion 
the 
body 
neither 
gains 
nor 
loses 
distance 
from 
the 
common 
center 
of 
heavy 
things)itfollowsthat 
resistanceismetonlyinconsequenceofthebodyrising 
through 
the 
vertical 
distance 
CF. 
Since 
then 
the 
body 
G 
in 
moving 
from 
A 
to 
F 
offers 
resistance 
only 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
rises 
through 
the 
vertical 
distance 
CF, 
while 
the 
other 
body 
H 
must 
fall 
vertically 
through 
the 
entire 
distance 
FA, 
and 
since 
this 
ratio 
is 
maintained 
whether 
the 
motion 
be 
large 
or 
small, 
the 
two 
bodies 
being 
inextensibly 
connected, 
we 
are 
able 
to 
assert 
positively 
that, 
in 
case 
of 
equilibrium 
(bodies 
at 
rest) 
the 
momenta, 
the 
velocities, 
or 
their 
tendency 
to 
motion 
[propensioni 
al 
moto], 
i. 
e., 
the 
spaces 
which 
would 
be 
traversed 
by 
them 
in 
equal 
times, 
must 
be 
in 
the 
inverse 
ratio 
to 
their 
weights. 
This 
is 
what 
has 
been 
demonstrated 
in 
every 
case 
of 
mechanical 
motion.34 
So 
that, 
in 
order 
to 
hold 
the 
weight 
G 
at 
rest, 
one 
must 
give 
H 
a 
weight 
smaller 
in 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
distance 
CF 
is 
smaller 
than 
FA. 
If 
we 
do 
this, 
FA:FC=weight 
G:weight 
H; 
then 
equilibrium 
will 
occur, 
that 
is, 
the 
weights 
H 
and 
G 
will 
have 
the 
same 
impelling 
forces 
[momenti 
eguali], 
and 
the 
two 
bodies 
willcometorest.

And 
since 
we 
are 
agreed 
that 
the 
impetus, 
energy, 
momentum 
or 
tendency 
to 
motion 
of 
a 
moving 
body 
is 
as 
great 
as 
the 
force 
or 
least 
resistance 
[forza 
o 
resistenza 
minima] 
sufficient 
to 
stop 
it, 
and 
since 
we 
have 
found 
that 
the 
weight 
H 
is 
capable 
of 
preventing 
motion 
in 
the 
weight 
G, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
less 
weight 
H 
whose 
entire 
force 
[momento 
totale] 
is 
along 
the 
perpendicular, 
FC, 
will 
be 
an 
exact 
measure 
of 
the 
component 
of 
force 
[momento 
parziale] 
which 
the 
larger 
weight 
G 
exerts 
along 
the 
plane 
FA. 
But 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
total 
force 
[total 
momento] 
on 
the 
body 
G 
is 
its 
own 
weight, 
since 
to 
prevent 
its 
fall 
it 
is 
only 
necessary 
to 
balance 
it 
with 
an 
equal 
weight, 
provided 
this 
second 
weight 
be 
free 
to 
move 
vertically; 
therefore 
the 
component 
of 
the 
force 
[momento 
parziale] 
on 
G 
along 
the 
inclined 
plane 
FA 
will 
bear 
to 
the 
maximumand 
totalforceonthis 
same 
bodyGalongtheperpendicularFCthe 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
weight 
H 
to 
the 
weight 
G. 
This 
ratio 
is, 
by 
construction, 
the 
same 
which 
the 
height, 
FC, 
of 
the 
inclined 
plane 
bears 
to 
the 
length 
FA. 
We 
have 
here 
the 
lemma 
which 
I 
proposed 
to 
demonstrate 
and 
which, 
as 
you 
will 
see, 
has 
been 
assumed 
by 
our 
Author 
in 
the 
second 
part 
of 
the 
sixth 
propositionofthepresenttreatise. 



Sagr. 
From 
what 
you 
have 
shown 
thus 
far, 
it 
appears 
to 
me 
that 
one 
might 
infer, 
arguing 
ex 
aequali 
con 
la 
proportione 
perturbata, 
that 
the 
tendencies 
[momenti] 
of 
one 
and 
the 
same 
body 
to 
move 
along 
planes 
differently 
inclined, 
but 
having 
the 
same 
vertical 
height, 
as 
FA 
and 
FI, 
are 
to 
each 
other 
inverselyas 
thelengths 
oftheplanes. 


Perfectly 
right. 
This 
point 
established, 
I 
pass 
to 
the 
demonstration 
of 
the 
followingtheorem: 


If 
a 
body 
falls 
freely 
along 
smooth 
planes 
inclined 
at 
any 
angle 
whatsoever, 
but 
of 
the 
same 
height, 
the 
speeds 
with 
which 
it 
reaches 
the 
bottomarethesame. 


First 
we 
must 
recall 
the 
fact 
that 
on 
a 
plane 
of 
any 
inclination 
whatever 
a 
body 
starting 
from 
rest 
gains 
speed 
or 
momentum 
[la 
quantita 
dell’impeto]in 
direct 
proportion 
to 
the 
time, 
in 
agreement 
with 
the 
definition 
of 
naturally 
accelerated 
motion 
given 
by 
the 
Author. 
Hence, 
as 
he 
has 
shown 
in 
the 
preceding 
proposition, 
the 
distances 
traversed 
are 
proportional 
to 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
times 
and 
therefore 
to 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
speeds. 
The 
speed 
relations 
areherethesameasin 
the 
motionfirststudied[i. 
e., 
vertical 
motion],sincein 
eachcasethegain 
ofspeedisproportionaltothe 
time. 


Let 
AB 
be 
an 
inclined 
plane 
whose 
height 
above 
the 
level 
BC 
is 
AC. 
As 
we 
have 
seen 
above 
the 
force 
impelling 
[l’impeto] 
a 
body 
to 
fall 
along 
the 
vertical 
AC 
is 
to 
the 
force 
which 
drives 
the 
same 
body 
along 
the 
inclined 
plane 
AB 
as 
AB 
is 
to 
AC. 
On 
the 
incline 
AB, 
lay 
off 
AD 
a 
third 
proportional 
to 
AB 
and 
AC; 
then 
the 
force 
producing 
motion 
along 
AC 
is 
to 
that 
along 
AB 


(i. 
e., 
along 
AD) 
asthe 
length 
AC 
is 
to 
the 
length 
AD. 
And 
therefore 
the 
body 
will 
traverse 
the 
space 
AD, 
along 
the 
incline 
AB, 
in 
the 
same 
time 
which 
it 
would 
occupy 
in 
falling 
the 
vertical 
distance 
AC, 
(since 
the 
forces 
[momenti] 
are 
in 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
these 
distances); 
also 
the 
speed 
at 
C 
is 
to 
the 
speed 
at 
DasthedistanceACis 
tothedistance 
AD. 
But, 
accordingtothedefinitionof 
accelerated 
motion, 
the 
speed 
at 
B 
is 
to 
the 
speed 
of 
the 
same 
body 
at 
D 
as 
the 
time 
required 
to 
traverse 
AB 
is 
to 
the 
time 
required 
for 
AD; 
and, 
according 
to 
the 
last 
corollary 
of 
the 
second 
proposition, 
the 
time 
of 
passing 
through 
the 
distance 
AB 
bears 
to 
the 
time 
of 
passing 
through 
AD 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
distance 
AC 
(a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
AB 
and 
AD) 
to 
AD. 
Accordingly 
the 
two 
speeds 
at 
B 
and 
C 
each 
bear 
to 
the 
speed 
at 
D 
the 
same 
ratio, 
namely, 
that 
of 
the 
distances

they 
are

From 
the 
above 
we 
are 
better 
able 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
following 
third 
proposition 
of 
the 
Author 
in 
which 
he 
employs 
the 
following 
principle, 
namely, 
the 
time 
required 
to 
traverse 
an 
inclined 
plane 
is 
to 
that 
required 
to 
fall 
through 
the 
vertical 
height 
of 
the 
plane 
in 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
length 
of 
theplanetoitsheight. 


In 
like 
manner 
it 
can 
be 
shown 
that 
the 
time 
required 
to 
fall 
through 
AC 
is 
to 
the 
time 
required 
for 
any 
other 
incline 
AE 
as 
the 
length 
AC 
is 
to 
the 
length 
AE; 
therefore, 
ex 
aequali, 
the 
time 
of

along 
the

AB 
is

Putting

in

has

One 
might 
by

of 
this

theorem, 
as 
Sagredo 
will 
readily 
see, 
immediately 
demonstrate 
the

proposition 
of 
the 
Author;

let 
us 



here 
end 
this 
digression

If 
one 
and 
the 
same 
body, 
starting 
from 
rest, 
falls 
along 
an 
inclined 
plane 
and 
also 
along 
a 
vertical, 
each 
having 
the 
same 
height, 
the 
times 
of 
descent 
willbe 
toeachotheras 
the 
lengths 
oftheinclined 
planeandthevertical. 


Let 
AC 
be 
the 
inclined 
plane 
and 
AB 
the 
perpendicular, 
each 
having 
the 
same 
vertical 
height 
above 
the 
horizontal, 
namely, 
BA; 
then 
I 
say, 
the 
time 
of 
descentof 
oneandthe 
same 
body 
along 
theplaneAC 
bears 
a 
ratio 
tothe 
time 
of 
fall 
along 
the 
perpendicular 
AB, 
which 
is 
the 
same 
as 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
length 
AC 
to 
the 
length 
AB. 
Let 
DG, 
EI 
and 
LF 
be 
any 
lines 
parallel 
to 
the 
horizontal 
CB; 
then 
it 
follows 
from 
what 
has 
preceded 
that 
a 
body 
starting 
from 
A 
will 
acquire 
the 
same 
speed 
at 
the 
point 
G 
as 
at 
D, 
since 
in 
each 
case 
the 
vertical 
fall 
is 
the 
same; 
in 
like 
manner 
the 
speeds 
at 
I 
and 
E 
will 
be 
the 
same; 
so 
also 
those 
at 
L 
and 
F. 
And 
in 
general 
the 
speeds 
at 
the 
two 
extremities 
of 
any 
parallel 
drawn 
from 
any 
point 
on 
AB 
to 
the 
corresponding 
pointonACwill 
beequal. 



Thus 
the 
two 
distances 
AC 
and 
AB 
are 
traversed 
at 
the 
same 
speed. 
But 
it 
has 
already 
been 
proved 
that 
if 
two 
distances 
are 
traversed 
by 
a 
body 
moving 
with 
equal 
speeds, 
then 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
times 
of 
descent 
will 
be 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
distances 
themselves; 
therefore, 
the 
time 
of 
descent 
along 
AC 
is 
to 
that 
alongAB 
asthelengthofthe 
plane 
ACistotheverticaldistance 
AB. 


q. 
e. 
d. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
the 
above 
could 
have 
been 
proved 
clearly 
and 
briefly 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
proposition 
already 
demonstrated, 
namely, 
that 
the 
distance 
traversed 
in 
the 
case 
of 
accelerated 
motion 
along 
AC 
or 
AB 
is 
the 
same 
as 
that 
coveredby 
auniform 
speed 
whose 
valueis 
one-half 
the 
maximumspeed, 
CB; 
the 
two 
distances 
AC 
and 
AB 
having 
been 
traversed 
at 
the 
same 
uniform 
speed 
it 
is 
evident, 
from 
Proposition 
I, 
that 
the 
times 
of 
descent 
will 
be 
to 
eachotherasthedistances. 



Corollary 


Hence 
we 
may 
infer 
that 
the 
times 
of 
descent 
along 
planes 
having 
different 
inclinations, 
but 
the 
same 
vertical 
height 
stand 
to 
one 
another 
in 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
lengths 
of 
the 
planes. 
For 
consider 
any 
plane 
AM 
extending 
from 
A 
to 
the 
horizontal 
CB; 
then 
it 
may 
be 
demonstrated 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
that 
the 
time 
of 
descent 
along 
AM 
is 
to 
the 
time 
along 
AB 
as 
the 
distance 
AM 
is 
to 
AB; 
but 
since 
the 
time 
along 
AB 
is 
to 
that 
along 
AC 
as 
the 
length 
AB 
is 
to 
the 
length 
AC, 
it 
follows, 
ex 
æquali, 
that 
as 
AM 
is 
to 
AC 
so 
is 
the 
time 
along 
AM 
tothetimealongAC. 


TheoremIV, 
PropositionIV 


The 
times 
of 
descent 
along 
planes 
of 
the 
same 
length 
but 
of 
different 
inclinations 
are 
to 
each 
other 
in 
the 
inverse 
ratio 
of 
the 
square 
roots 
of 
their 
heights 


Froma 
single 
pointBdraw 
the 
planes 
BA 
andBC, 
having 
the 
same 
length 
but 
different 
inclinations; 
let 
AE 
and 
CD 
be 
horizontal 
lines 
drawn 
to 
meet 
the 
perpendicular 
BD; 
and 
let 
BE 
represent 
the 
height 
of 
the 
plane 
AB, 
and 
BD 
the 
height 
of 
BC; 
also 
let 
BI 
be 
a 
mean 
proportional 
to 
BD 
and 
BE; 
then 
the 
ratio 
of 
BD 
to 
BI 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
square 
root 
of 
the 
ratio 
of 
BD 
to 
BE. 
Now, 
I 
say, 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
times 
of 
descent 
along 
BA 
and 
BC 
is 
the 
ratio 
of 
BD 
to 
BI; 
so 
that 
the 
time 
of 
descent 
along 
BA 
is 
related 
to 
the 
height 
of 
the 
other 
plane 
BC, 
namely 
BD 
as 
the 
time 
along 
BC 
is 
related 
to 
the 
height 
BI. 
Now 
it 
must 
be 
proved 
that 
the 
time 
of 
descent 
along 
BA 
is 
to 
that 
along 
BC

and 
since 
it 
has

that 
the 
time 
of

along 
BA 
is 
to 
that 
along 
the 
vertical 
BE 
as 
BA 
is 
to 
BE; 
and 
also 
that 
the 
time 
along 
BE 
is 
to 
that 
along 
BD 
as 
BE 
is 
to 
BI; 
and 
likewise 
that 
the 
time 
along

is 
to 
that 
along 
BC 
as 
BD 
is 
to 
BC, 
or 
as

to

it 
follows, 
ex

that 
the 
time 
along

is 
to 
that 
along

as

vertical 
circle

drawn 
any

planes 
meeting 
the 
circumference 
the

these

By 
use 
of 
the 
principles 
of 
mechanics 
[ex 
mechanicis] 
one 
may 
obtain 
the 
same 
result, 
namely, 
that 
a 
falling 
body 
will 
require 
equal 
times 
to 
traverse 
thedistances 
CAand 
DA, 
indicated 
in 
the 
followingfigure. 
Lay 
off 
BAequal 
to 
DA, 
and 
let 
fall 
the 
perpendiculars 
BE 
and 
DF; 
it 
follows 
from 
the 
principles 
of 
mechanics 
that 
the 
component 
of 
the 
momentum 
[momentum 
ponderis] 
acting 
along 
the 
inclined 
plane 
ABC 
is 
to 
the 
total 
momentum 
[i. 
e., 
the 
momentum 
of 
the 
body 
falling 
freely] 
as 
BE 
is 
to 
BA; 
in 
like 
manner 
the 
momentum 
along 
the 
plane 
AD 
is 
to 
its 
total 
momentum 
[i. 
e., 
the 



momentum 
of 
the 
body 
falling 
freely] 
as 
DF 
is 
to 
DA, 
or 
to 
BA. 
Therefore 
the 
momentum 
of 
this 
same 
weight 
along 
the 
plane 
DA 
is 
to 
that 
along 
the 
plane 
ABC 
as 
the 
length 
DF 
is 
to 
the 
length 
BE; 
for 
this 
reason, 
this 
same 
weight 
will 
in 
equal 
times 
according 
to 
the 
second 
proposition 
of 
the 
first 
book, 
traverse 
spaces 
along 
the 
planes 
CA 
and 
DA 
which 
are 
to 
each 
other 
as 
the 
lengths 
BE 
and 
DF. 
But 
it 
can 
be 
shown 
that 
CA 
is 
to 
DA 
as 
BE 
is 
to 
DF. 


HencethefallingbodywilltraversethetwopathsCAandDAinequaltimes.
Moreover 
the 
fact 
that 
CA 
is 
to 
DA 
as 
BE 
is 
to 
DF 
may 
be 
demonstrated 
as 
follows: 
Join 
C 
and 
D; 
through 
D, 
draw 
the 
line 
DGL 
parallel 
to 
AF 
and 
cutting 
the 
line 
AC 
in 
I; 
through 
B 
draw 
the 
line 
BH, 
also 
parallel 
to 
AF. 
Then 
the 
angle 
ADI 
will 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
angle 
DCA, 
since 
they 
subtend 
equal 
arcs 
LA 
and 
DA, 
and 
since 
the 
angle 
DAC 
is 
common, 
the 
sides 
of 
the 
triangles, 
CAD 
and 
DAI, 
about 
the 
common 
angle 
will 
be 
proportional 
to 



each 
other; 
accordingly 
as 
CA 
is 
to 
DA 
so 
is 
DA 
to 
IA, 
that 
is 
as 
BA 
is 
to 
IA, 
oras 
HAistoGA,thatisasBE 
isto 
DF. 


e. 
d. 
The 
same 
proposition 
may 
be 
more 
easily 
demonstrated 
as 
follows: 
On 
the 
horizontal 
line 
AB 
draw 
a 
circle 
whose 
diameter 
DC 
is 
vertical. 
From 
the 
upper 
end 
of 
this 
diameter 
draw 
any 
inclined 
plane, 
DF, 
extending 
to 
meet 
the 
circumference; 
then, 
I 
say, 
a 
body 
will 
occupy 
the 
same 
time 
in 
falling 
along 
the 
plane 
DF 
as 
along 
the 
diameter 
DC. 
For 
draw 
FG 
parallel 
to 
AB 
and 
perpendicular 
to 
DC; 
join 
FC; 
and 
since 
the 
time 
of 
fall 
along 
DC 
is 
to 
that 
along 
DG 
as 
the 
mean 
proportional 
between 
CD 
and 
GD 
is 
to 
GD 
itself; 
and 
since 
also 
DF 
is 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
DC 
and 
DG, 
the 
angle 
DFC 
inscribed 
in 
a 
semicircle 
being 
a 
right-angle, 
and 
FG 
being 
perpendicular 
to 
DC, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
time 
of 
fall 
along 
DC 
is 
to 
that 
along 
DG 
as 
the 
length 
FD 
is 
to 
GD. 
But 
it 
has 
already 
been 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
time 
of 
descent 
along 
DF 
is 
to 
that 
along 
DG 
as 
the 
length 
DF 
is 
to 
DG; 
hence 
the 
times 
of 
descent 
along 
DF 
and 
DC 
each 
bear 
to 
the 
time 
of 
fall 
alongDG 
thesameratio;consequentlytheyareequal. 



In 
like 
manner 
it 
may 
be 
shown 
that 
if 
one 
draws 
the 
chord 
CE 
from 
the 
lower 
end 
of 
the 
diameter, 
also 
the 
line 
EH 
parallel 
to 
the 
horizon, 
and 
joins 
the 
points 
E 
and 
D, 
the 
time 
of 
descent 
along 
EC,will 
be 
the 
same 
as 
that 
alongthediameter,DC. 


CorollaryI 


From 
this 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
times 
of 
descent 
along 
all 
chords 
drawn 
through 
either 
Cor 
Dareequal 
onetoanother. 


CorollaryII 


It 
also 
follows 
that, 
if 
from 
any 
one 
point 
there 
be 
drawn 
a 
vertical 
line 
and 
an 
inclined 
one 
along 
which 
the 
time 
of 
descent 
is 
the 
same, 
the 
inclined 
line 
willbe

Corollary 
III 


Moreover 
the 
times 
of 
descent 
along 
inclined 
planes 
will 
be 
equal 
when 
the 
vertical 
heights 
of 
equal 
lengths 
of 
these 
planes 
are 
to 
each 
other 
as 
the 
lengths 
of 
the 
planes 
themselves; 
thus 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
times 
of 
descent 
along 
CA 
and 
DA, 
in 
the 
figure 
just 
before 
the 
last, 
are 
equal, 
provided 
the 
vertical 
height 
of 
AB 
(AB 
being 
equal 
to 
AD), 
namely, 
BE, 
is 
to 
the 
vertical 
height

Please 
allow 
me 
to 
interrupt 
the 
lecture 
for 
a 
moment 
in 
order 
that 
I 
may 
clear 
up 
an 
idea 
which 
just 
occurs 
to 
me; 
one 
which, 
if 
it 
involve 
no 
fallacy, 
suggests 
at 
least 
a 
freakish 
and 
interesting 
circumstance, 
such 
as 
oftenoccursinnatureandintherealmofnecessaryconsequences. 


If, 
from 
any 
point 
fixed 
in 
a 
horizontal 
plane, 
straight 
lines 
be 
drawn 
extending 
indefinitely 
in 
all 
directions, 
and 
if 
we 
imagine 
a 
point 
to 
move 
along 
each 
of 
these 
lines 
with 
constant 
speed, 
all 
starting 
from 
the 
fixed 
point 
at 
the 
same 
instant 
and 
moving 
with 
equal 
speeds, 
then 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
all 
of 
these 
moving 
points 
will 
lie 
upon 
the 
circumference 
of 
a 
circle 
which 
grows 
larger 
and 
larger, 
always 
having 
the 
aforesaid 
fixed 
point 
as 
its 
center; 
this 
circle 
spreads 
out 
in 
precisely 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
the 
little 
waves 
do 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
pebble 
allowed 
to 
drop 
into 
quiet 
water, 
where 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
stone 
starts 
the 
motion 
in 
all 
directions, 
while 
the 
point 
of 
impact 
remains 
the 
center 
of 
these 
ever-expanding 
circular 
waves. 
But 
imagine 
a 
vertical 
plane 
from 
the 
highest 
point 
of 
which 
are 
drawn 
lines 
inclined 
at 
every 
angle 
and 
extending 
indefinitely; 
imagine 
also 
that 
heavy 
particles 
descend 
along 
these 
lines 
each 
with 
a 
naturally 
accelerated 
motion 
and 
each 
with 
a 
speed 
appropriate 
to 
the 
inclination 
of 
its 
line. 
If 
these 
moving 
particles 
are 
always 
visible, 
what 
will 
be 
the 
locus 
of 
their 
positions 
at 
any 
instant? 
Now 
the 
answer 
to 
this 
question 
surprises 
me, 
for 
I 
am 
led 
by 
the 
preceding 
theorems 
to 
believe 
that 
these 
particles 
will 
always 
lie 
upon 
the 
circumference 
of 
a 
single 
circle, 
ever 
increasing 
in 
size 
as 
the 
particles 
recede 
farther 
and 
farther 
from 
the 
point 
at 
which 
their 
motion 
began. 
To 
be 
more 
definite, 
let 
A 
be 
the 
fixed 
point 
from 
which 
are 
drawn 
the 
lines 
AF 
and 
AH 
inclined 
at 
any 
angle 
whatsoever. 
On 
the 
perpendicular 
AB 
take 
any 
two 
points 
C 
and 
D 
about 
which, 
as 
centers, 
circles 
are 
described 
passing 
through 
the 
point 
A, 
and 
cutting 
the 
inclined 
lines 
at 
the 
points 
F, 
H, 
B, 
E, 
G, 
I. 
From 
the 
preceding 
theorems 
it 
is 
clear 
that, 
if 
particles 
start, 
at 
the 
same 
instant, 
from 
A 
and 
descend 
along 
these 
lines, 
when 
one 
is 
at 
E 
another 
will 
be 
at 
G 
and 
another 



at 
I; 
at 
a 
later 
instant 
they 
will 
be 
found 
simultaneously 
at 
F, 
H 
and 
B; 
these, 
and 
indeed 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
other 
particles 
travelling 
along 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
different 
slopes 
will 
at 
successive 
instants 
always 
lie 
upon 
a 
single 
ever-expanding 
circle. 
The 
two 
kinds 
of 
motion 
occurring 
in 
nature 
give 
rise 
therefore 
to 
two 
infinite 
series 
of 
circles, 
at 
once 
resembling 
and 
differing 
from 
each 
other; 
the 
one 
takes 
its 
rise 
in 
the 
center 
of 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
concentric 
circles; 
the 
other 
has 
its 
origin 
in 
the 
contact, 
at 
their 
highest 
points, 
of 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
eccentric 
circles; 
the 
former 
are 
produced 
by 
motions 
which 
are 
equal 
and 
uniform; 
the 
latter 
by 
motions 
which 
are 
neither 
uniform 
nor 
equal 
among 
themselves, 
but 
which 
vary 
from 
one 
to 
another 


accordingtotheslope.
Further, 
if 
from 
the 
two 
points 
chosen 
as 
origins 
of 
motion, 
we 
draw 
lines 
not 
only 
along 
horizontal 
and 
vertical 
planes 
but 
in 
all 
directions 
then 
just 
as 
in 
the 
former 
cases, 
beginning 
at 
a 
single 
point 
ever-expanding 
circles 
are 



produced, 
so 
in 
the 
latter 
case 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
spheres 
are 
produced 
about 
a 
single 
point, 
or 
rather 
a 
single 
sphere 
which 
expands 
in 
size 
without 
limit; 
and 
this 
in 
two 
ways, 
one 
with 
the 
origin 
at 
the 
center, 
the 
other 
on 
the 
surfaceofthespheres.

Simp. 
As 
for 
me, 
I 
understand 
in 
a 
general 
way 
how 
the 
two 
kinds 
of 
natural 
motions 
give 
rise 
to 
the 
circles 
and 
spheres; 
and 
yet 
as 
to 
the 
production 
of 
circles 
by 
accelerated 
motion 
and 
its 
proof, 
I 
am 
not 
entirely 
clear; 
but 
the 
fact 
that 
one 
can 
take 
the 
origin 
of 
motion 
either 
at 
the 
inmost 
center 
or 
at 
the 
very 
top 
of 
the 
sphere 
leads 
one 
to 
think 
that 
there 
may 
be 
some 
great 
mystery 
hidden 
in 
these 
true 
and 
wonderful 
results, 
a 
mystery 
related 
to 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
universe 
(which 
is 
said 
to 
be 
spherical 
in 
shape), 
and 
related 
also 
totheseatof 
the

Salv. 
I 
have 
no 
hesitation 
in 
agreeing 
with 
you. 
But 
profound 
considerations 
of 
this 
kind 
belong 
to 
a 
higher 
science 
than 
ours 
[a

alte

We 
must 
be 
satisfied 
to 
belong 
to 
that 
class 
of 
less 
worthy 
workmen 
who 
procure 
from 
the

the 
marble 
out 
of 
which, 
later, 
the

TheoremVII, 
PropositionVII 


If 
the 
heights 
of 
two 
inclined 
planes 
are 
to 
each 
other 
in 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
squares 
of 
their 
lengths, 
bodies 
starting 
from 
rest 
will 
traverse 
these 
planes 
in 
equaltimes. 


Take 
two 
planes 
of 
different 
lengths 
and 
different 
inclinations, 
AE 
and 
AB, 
whose 
heights 
are 
AF 
and 
AD: 
let 
AF 
be 
to 
AD 
as 
the 
square 
of 
AE 
is 
to 
the 
square 
of 
AB; 
then, 
I 
say, 
that 
a 
body, 
starting 
from 
rest 
at 
A, 
will 
traverse 
the 
planes 
AE 
and 
AB 
in 
equal 
times. 
From 
the 
vertical 
line, 
draw 
the 
horizontal 
parallel 
lines 
EF 
and 
DB, 
the 
latter 
cutting 
AE 
at 
G. 
Since 
FA:DA=:, 
and 
since 
FA:DA=EA:GA, 
it 
follows 
that 
EA:GA=:. 
Hence 
BA 
is 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
EA 
and 
GA. 
Now 
since 
the 
time 
of 
descent 
along 
AB 
bears 
to 
the 
time 
along 
AG 
the 
same 
ratio 
which 
AB 
bears 
to 
AG 
and 
since 
also 
the 
time 
of 
descent 
along 
AG 
is 
to 
the 
time 
along 
AE 
as 
AG 
is 



to 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
AG 
and 
AE, 
that 
is, 
to 
AB, 
it 
follows, 
ex 
æquali, 
that 
the 
time 
along 
AB 
is 
to 
the 
time 
along 
AE 
as 
AB 
is 
to 
itself. 
Thereforethe 
timesareequal. 


q.e.d.
TheoremVIII, 
PropositionVIII 


The 
times 
of 
descent 
along 
all 
inclined 
planes 
which 
intersect 
one 
and 
the 
same 
vertical 
circle, 
either 
at 
its 
highest 
or 
lowest 
point, 
are 
equal 
to 
the 
time 
of 
fall 
along 
the 
vertical 
diameter; 
for 
those 
planes 
which 
fall 
short 
of 
this 
diameter 
the 
times 
are 
shorter; 
for 
planes 
which 
cut 
this 
diameter, 
the 
times 
arelonger. 


TheoremIX, 
PropositionIX 



If 
from 
any 
point 
on 
a 
horizontal 
line 
two 
planes, 
inclined 
at 
any 
angle, 
are 
drawn, 
and 
if 
they 
are 
cut 
by 
a 
line 
which 
makes 
with 
them 
angles 
alternately 
equal 
to 
the 
angles 
between 
these 
planes 
and 
the 
horizontal, 
then 
the 
times 
required 
to 
traverse 
those 
portions 
of 
the 
plane 
cut 
off 
by 
the 
aforesaid 
line 
areequal. 


Through 
the 
point 
C 
on 
the 
horizontal 
line 
X, 
draw 
two 
planes 
CD 
and 
CE 
inclined 
at 
any 
angle 
whatever: 
at 
any 
point 
in 
the 
line 
CD 
lay 
off 
the 
angle 
CDF 
equal 
to 
the 
angle 
XCE; 
let 
the 
line 
DF 
cut 
CE 
at 
F 
so 
that 
the 
angles 
CDF 
and 
CFD 
are 
alternately 
equal 
to 
XCE 
and 
LCD; 
then, 
I 
say, 
the 
times 
of 
descent 
over 
CD 
and 
CF 
are 
equal. 
Now 
since 
the 
angle 
CDF 
is 
equal 
to 
theangle 
XCEby 
construction,itisevident 
that 
theangle 
CFDmust 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
angle 
DCL. 
For 
if 
the 
common 
angle 
DCF 
be 
subtracted 
from 
the 
three 
angles 
of 
the 
triangle 
CDF, 
together 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles, 
(to 
which 
are 
also 
equal 
all 
the 
angles 
which 
can 
be 
described 
about 
the 
point 
C 
on 
the 
lower 
side 
of 
the 
line 
LX) 
there 
remain 
in 
the 
triangle 
two 
angles, 
CDF 
and 
CFD, 
equal 
to 
the 
two 
angles 
XCE 
and 
LCD; 
but, 
by 
hypothesis, 
the 
angles 
CDF 
and 
XCE 
are 
equal; 
hence 
the 
remaining 
angle 
CFD 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
remainder 
DCL. 
Take 
CE 
equal 
to 
CD; 
from 
the 
points 
D 
and 
E 
draw 
DA 
and 
EB 
perpendicular 
to 
the 
horizontal 
line 
XL; 
and 
from 
the 
point 
C 
draw 
CGperpendicular 
to 
DF. 
Now 
sincethe 
angle 
CDG 
isequal 
to 
the 
angleECB 
and 
since 
DGC 
and 
CBE 
are 
right 
angles, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
triangles 
CDG 
and 
CBE 
are 
equiangular; 
consequently 
DC:CG=CE:EB. 
But 
DC 
is 
equal 
to 
CE, 
and 
therefore 
CG 
is 
equal 
to 
EB. 
Since 
also 
the 
angles 
at 
C 
and 
at 
A, 
in 
the 
triangle 
DAC, 
are 
equal 
to 
the 
angles 
at 
F 
and 
G 
in 
the 
triangle 
CGF, 
we 
have 
CD:DA=FC:CG 
and, 
permutando, 
DC:CF=DA:CG=DA:BE. 
Thus 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
heights 
of 
the 
equal 
planes 
CD 
and 
CE 
is 
the 
same 
as 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
lengths 
DC 
and 
CF. 
Therefore, 
by 
Corollary 
I 
of 
Prop. 
VI, 
the 
times 
of 
descentalongtheseplaneswillbeequal. 


q. 
e. 
d. 

An 
alternative 
proof 
is 
the 
following: 
Draw 
FS 
perpendicular 
to 
the 
horizontal 
line 
AS. 
Then, 
since 
the 
triangle 
CSF 
is 
similar 
to 
the 
triangle 
DGC, 
we 
have 
SF:FC=GC:CD; 
and 
since 
the 
triangle 
CFG 
is 
similar 
to 
the 
triangle 
DCA, 
we 
have 
FC:CG=CD:DA. 
Hence, 
ex 
æquali, 
SF:CG=CG:DA. 
Therefore 
CG 
is 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
SF 
and 
DA, 
while 
DA:SF=:. 
Again 
since 
the 
triangle 
ACD 
is 
similar 
to 
the 
triangle 
CGF, 
we 
have 
DA:DC=GC:CFand, 
permutando, 
DA:CG 
=DC:CF: 
also 
:=:. 
Butit 
has 
been 
shown 
that 
:=DA:SF. 
Therefore 
:=DA:FS. 
Hence 
from 
the 
above 
Prop. 
VII, 
since 
the 
heights 
DA 
and 
FS 
of 
the 
planes 
CD 
and 
CF 
are 
to 
each 
other 
as 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
lengths 
of 
the 
planes, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
times 
of 
descent 
along 
theseplaneswillbeequal. 



TheoremX, 
PropositionX 


The 
times 
of 
descent 
along 
inclined 
planes 
of 
the 
same 
height, 
but 
of 
different 
slope, 
are 
to 
each 
other 
as 
the 
lengths 
of 
these 
planes; 
and 
this 
is 
true 
whether 
the 
motion 
starts 
from 
rest 
or 
whether 
it 
is 
preceded 
by 
a

TheoremXI, 
PropositionXI 


If 
a 
plane 
be 
divided 
into 
any 
two 
parts 
and 
if 
motion 
along 
it 
starts 
from 
rest, 
then 
the 
time 
of 
descent 
along 
the 
first 
part 
is 
to 
the 
time 
of 
descent 
along 
the 
remainder 
as 
the 
length 
of 
this 
first 
part 
is 
to 
the 
excess 
of 
a 
mean 
proportionalbetweenthisfirst 
partandthe 
entirelengthoverthisfirstpart. 


Let 
the 
fall 
take 
place, 
from 
rest 
at 
A, 
through 
the 
entire 
distance 
AB 
which 
is 
divided 
at 
any 
point 
C; 
also 
let 
AF 
be 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
the 
entire 
length 
BA 
and 
the 
first 
part 
AC; 
then 
CF 
will 
denote 
the 
excess 
of 
the 
mean 
proportional 
FA 
over 
the 
first 
part 
AC. 
Now, 
I 
say, 
the 
time 
of 
descent 
along 
AC 
will 
be 
to 
the 
time 
of 
subsequent 
fall 
through 
CB 
as 
the 
length 
AC 
is 
to 
CF. 
This 
is 
evident, 
because 
the 
time 
along 
AC 
is 
to 
the 
time 
along 
the 
entire 
distance 
AB 
as 
AC 
is 
to 
the 
mean 
proportional 
AF. 



Therefore, 
dividendo, 
the 
time 
along 
AC 
will 
be 
to 
the 
time 
along 
the 
remainder 
CB 
as 
AC 
is

CF. 
If 
we

TheoremXII, 
PropositionXII 


If 
a 
vertical 
plane 
and 
any 
inclined 
plane 
are 
limited 
by 
two 
horizontals, 
and 
if 
we 
take 
mean 
proportionals 
between 
the 
lengths 
of 
these 
planes 
and 
those 
portions 
of 
them 
which 
lie 
between 
their 
point 
of 
intersection 
and 
the 
upper 
horizontal, 
then 
the 
time 
of 
fall 
along 
the 
perpendicular 
bears 
to 
the 
time 
required 
to 
traverse 
the 
upper 
part 
of 
the 
perpendicular 
plus 
the 
time 
required 
to 
traverse 
the 
lower 
part 
of 
the 
intersecting

the

ratio 
which 
the 
entire

bears 
to 
a

plus 
the

Let 
AF 
and 
CD 
be 
two 
horizontal 
planes 
limiting 
the 
vertical 
plane 
AC 
and 
the 
inclined 
plane 
DF; 
let 
the 
two 
last-mentioned 
planes 
intersect 
at 
B. 
Let 
AR 
be 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
the 
entire 
vertical 
AC 
and 
its 
upper 
part 
AB; 
and 
let 
FS 
be 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
FD 
and 
its 
upper 
part 



FB. 
Then, 
I 
say, 
the 
time 
of 
fall 
along 
the 
entire 
vertical 
path 
AC 
bears 
to 
the 
time 
of 
fall 
along

plus 
the 
time 
of 
fall 
along 
the 
lower 
part 
of 
the

namely, 
BD, 
the

which 
the

Join 
the

a

Now 
since 
the 
time 
of 
fall 
through 
the 
entire 
distance 
AC 
is 
to 
the 
time 
along 
the 
portion 
AB 
as 
CA 
is 
to 
the 
mean

AR 
it 
follows 
that, 
if 
we 
agree 
to 
represent 
the 
time 
of 
fall 
through 
AC 
by 
the 
distance 
AC, 
the 
time 
of 
fall 
through 
the

AB 
will 
be 
represented 
by 
AR; 
and 
the 
time 
of 
descent 
through 
the 
remainder, 
BC, 
will 
be 
represented 
by 
RC. 
But, 
if 
the 
time 
along 
AC 
is 
taken 
to 
be 
equal 
to 
the

AC, 
then 
the 
time 
along 
FD 
will 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
distance 
FD; 
and 
we 
may 
likewise 
infer 
that 
the 
time 
of 
descent 
along 
BD, 
when 
preceded 
by 
a 
fall 
along 
FB 
or 
AB, 
is 
numerically 
equal 
to 
the 
distance 
DS. 
Therefore 
the 
time 
required 
to 
fall 
along 
the 
path 
AC 
is 
equal 
to 
AR 
plus 
RC; 
while 
the 
time 
of 
descent 
along 
the 
broken 
line 
ABD 
will 
be 
equal 
to 
AR 
plus 
SD.

Fourth 
Day 


SALVIATI. 
Once 
more, 
Simplicio 
is 
here 
on 
time; 
so 
let 
us 
without 
delay 
takeup 
thequestionof 
motion. 
The 
textofourAuthor 
isasfollows: 


TheMotionofProjectiles 


In 
the 
preceding 
pages 
we 
have 
discussed 
the 
properties 
of 
uniform 
motion 
and 
of 
motion 
naturally 
accelerated 
along 
planes 
of 
all 
inclinations. 
I 
now 
propose 
to 
set 
forth 
those 
properties 
which 
belong 
to 
a 
body 
whose 
motion 
is 
compounded 
of 
two 
other 
motions, 
namely, 
one 
uniform 
and 
one 
naturally 
accelerated; 
these 
properties, 
well 
worth 
knowing, 
I 
propose 
to 
demonstrate 
in 
a 
rigid 
manner. 
This 
is 
the 
kind 
of 
motion 
seen 
in 
a 
moving 
projectile; 
its 
origin 
I 
conceivetobeasfollows: 


Imagine 
any 
particle 
projected 
along 
a 
horizontal 
plane 
without 
friction; 
then 
we 
know, 
from 
what 
has 
been 
more 
fully 
explained 
in 
the 
preceding 
pages, 
that 
this 
particle 
will 
move 
along 
this 
same 
plane 
with 
a 
motion 
which 
is 
uniform 
and 
perpetual, 
provided 
the 
plane 
has 
no 
limits. 
But 
if 
the 
plane 
is 
limited 
and 
elevated, 
then 
the 
moving 
particle, 
which 
we 
imagine 
to 
be 
a 
heavy 
one, 
will 
on 
passing 
over 
the 
edge 
of 
the 
plane 
acquire, 
in 
addition 
to 
its 
previous 
uniform 
and 
perpetual 
motion, 
a 
downward 
propensity 
due 
to 
its 
own 
weight; 
sothat 
the 
resulting 
motion 
which 
I 
call 
projection 
[projectio],is 
compounded 
of 
one 
which 
is 
uniform 
and 
horizontal 
and 
of 
another 
which 
is 
vertical 
and 
naturally 
accelerated. 
We 
now 
proceed 
to 
demonstrate 
some 
of 
itsproperties,thefirst 
ofwhich 
isas 
follows: 


Theorem 
I, 
PropositionI 


A 
projectile 
which 
is 
carried 
by 
a 
uniform 
horizontal 
motion 
compounded 
with 
a 
naturally 
accelerated 
vertical 
motion 
describes 
a 
path 
which 
is 
a 
semi-
parabola. 


Sagr. 
Here,Salviati,it 
willbenecessaryto 
stopalittlewhilefor 
my 
sakeand, 
I 
believe, 
also 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
Simplicio; 
for 
it 
so 
happens 
that 
I 
have 
not 
gone 
very 
far 
in 
my 
study 
of 
Apollonius 
and 
am 
merely 
aware 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
treats 
of 
the 
parabola 
and 
other 
conic 
sections, 
without 
an 
understanding 
of 
which 
I 
hardly 
think 
one 
will 
be 
able 
to 
follow 
the 
proof 
of 
other 



propositions 
depending 
upon 
them. 
Since 
even 
in 
this 
first 
beautiful 
theorem 
the 
author 
finds 
it 
necessary 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
path 
of 
a 
projectile 
is 
a 
parabola, 
and 
since, 
as 
I 
imagine, 
we 
shall 
have 
to 
deal 
with 
only 
this 
kind 
of 
curves, 
it 
will 
be 
absolutely 
necessary 
to 
have 
a 
thorough 
acquaintance, 
if 
not 
with 
all 
the 
properties 
which 
Apollonius 
has 
demonstrated 
for 
these 
figures, 
atleast 
withthosewhich 
areneededforthepresenttreatment. 


Salv. 
You 
are 
quite 
too 
modest, 
pretending 
ignorance 
of 
facts 
which 
not 
long 
ago 
you 
acknowledged 
as 
well 
known 
— 
I 
mean 
at 
the 
time 
when 
we 
were 
discussing 
the 
strength 
of 
materials 
and 
needed 
to 
use 
a 
certain 
theorem 
of 
Apollonius 
whichgaveyounotrouble. 


Sagr. 
I 
may 
have 
chanced 
to 
know 
it 
or 
may 
possibly 
have 
assumed 
it, 
so 
long 
as 
needed, 
for 
that 
discussion; 
but 
now 
when 
we 
have 
to 
follow 
all 
these 
demonstrations 
about 
such 
curves 
we 
ought 
not, 
as 
they 
say, 
to 
swallow 
it 
whole,and 
thuswastetimeandenergy. 
Simp. 
Now 
even 
though 
Sagredo 
is, 
as 
I 
believe, 
well 
equipped 
for 
all 
his 
needs, 
I 
do 
not 
understand 
even 
the 
elementary 
terms; 
for 
although 
our 
philosophers 
have 
treated 
the 
motion 
of 
projectiles, 
I 
do 
not 
recall 
their 
having 
described 
the 
path 
of 
a 
projectile 
except 
to 
state 
in 
a 
general 
way 
that 
it 
is 
always 
a 
curved 
line, 
unless 
the 
projection 
be 
vertically 
upwards. 
But 
if 
the 
little 
Euclid 
which 
I 
have 
learned 
since 
our 
previous 
discussion 
does 
not 
enable 
me 
to 
understand 
the 
demonstrations 
which 
are 
to 
follow, 
then 
I 
shall 
beobligedto 
acceptthetheoremsonfaith 
without 
fully 
comprehendingthem. 


Salv. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
I 
desire 
that 
you 
should 
understand 
them 
from 
the 
Author 
himself, 
who, 
when 
he 
allowed 
me 
to 
see 
this 
work 
of 
his, 
was 
good 
enough 
to 
prove 
for 
me 
two 
of 
the 
principal 
properties 
of 
the 
parabola 
because 
I 
did 
not 
happen 
to 
have 
at 
hand 
the 
books 
of 
Apollonius. 
These 
properties,which 
are 
theonlyonesweshallneed 
inthepresentdiscussion,he 
proved 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
no 
prerequisite 
knowledge 
was 
required. 
These 
theorems 
are, 
indeed, 
given 
by 
Apollonius, 
but 
after 
many 
preceding 
ones, 
to 
follow 
which 
would 
take 
a 
long 
while. 
I 
wish 
to 
shorten 
our 
task 
by 
deriving 
the 
first 
property 
purely 
and 
simply 
from 
the 
mode 
of 
generation 
of 
the 
parabolaandprovingthesecondimmediatelyfromthefirst. 


Beginning 
now 
with 
the 
first, 
imagine 
a 
right 
cone, 
erected 
upon 
the 
circular 
base 
ibkc 
with 
apex 
at 
l. 
The 
section 
of 
this 
cone 
made 
by 
a 
plane 



drawn 
parallel 
to 
the 
side 
lk 
is 
the 
curve 
which 
is 
called 
a 
parabola. 
The 
base 
of 
this 
parabola 
bc 
cuts 
at 
right 
angles 
the 
diameter 
ik 
of 
the 
circle 
ibkc, 
and 
theaxis 
ad 
is 
parallel 
to 
the 
side 
lk; 
now 
having 
taken 
any 
point 
f 
in 
the 
curve 
bfa 
draw 
the 
straight 
line 
fe 
parallel 
to 
bd; 
then, 
I 
say, 
the 
square 
of 
bd 
is 
to 
the 
square 
of 
fe 
in 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
axis 
ad 
is 
to 
the 
portion 
ae. 
Through 
the 
point 
e 
pass 
a 
plane 
parallel 
to 
the 
circle 
ibkc, 
producing 
in 
the 
cone 
a 
circular 
section 
whose 
diameter 
is 
the 
line 
geh. 
Since 
bd 
is 
at 
right 
angles 
to 
ik 
in 
the 
circle 
ibk, 
the 
square 
of 
bd 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
rectangle 
formed 
by 
id 
and 
dk; 
so 
also 
in 
the 
upper 
circle 
which 
passes 
through 
the 
points 
gfh 
the 
square 
of 
fe 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
rectangle 
formed 
by 
ge 
and 
eh; 
hence 
the 
square 
of 
bd 
is 
to 
the 
square 
of 
fe 
as 
the 
rectangle 
id.dk 
is 
to 
the 
rectangle 
ge.eh. 
And 
since 
the 
line 
ed 
is 
parallel 
to 
hk, 
the 
line 
eh, 
being 
parallel 
to 
dk, 
is 
equal 
to 
it; 
therefore 
the 
rectangle 
id.dk 
is 
to 
the 
rectangle 
ge.eh 
as 
id 
is 
to 
ge, 
that 
is, 
as 
da 
is 
to 
ae; 
whence 
also 
the 
rectangle 
id.dk 
is 
to 
the 
rectangle 
ge.eh, 
that 
is, 
thesquareof 
bd 
istothesquareof 
fe, 
as 
theaxis 
da 
is 
totheportion 
ae. 


q. 
e. 
d. 

The 
other 
proposition 
necessary 
for 
this 
discussion 
we 
demonstrate 
as 
follows. 
Let 
us 
draw 
a 
parabola 
whose 
axis 
ca 
is 
prolonged 
upwards 
to 
a 
point 
d; 
from 
anypoint 
b 
draw 
the 
line 
bc 
parallel 
to 
the 
base 
of 
the 
parabola; 
if 
now 
the 
point 
d 
is 
chosen 
so 
that 
da 
= 
ca, 
then, 
I 
say, 
the 
straight 
line 
drawn 
through 
the 
points 
b 
and 
d 
will 
be 
tangent 
to 
the 
parabola 
at 
b. 
For 
imagine, 
if 
possible, 
that 
this 
line 
cuts 
the 
parabola 
above 
or 
that 
its 
prolongation 
cuts 
it 
below, 
and 
through 
any 
point 
g 
in 
it 
draw 
the 
straight 
line 
fge. 
And 
since 
the 
square 
of 
fe 
is 
greater 
than 
the 
square 
of 
ge, 
the 
square 
of 
fe 
will 
bear 
a 
greater 
ratio 
to 
the 
square 
of 
bc 
than 
the 
square 
of 
ge 
to 
that 
of 
bc; 
and 
since, 
by 
the 
preceding 
proposition, 
the 
square 
of 
fe 
is 
to 
that 
of 
bc 
as 
the 
line 
ea 
is 
to 
ca, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
line 
ea 
will 
bear 
to 
the 
line 
ca 
a 
greater 
ratio 
than 
the 
square 
of 
ge 
to 
that 
of 
bc, 
or, 
than 
the 
square 
of 
ed 
to 
that 
of 
cd 
(the 
sides 
of 
the 
triangles 
deg 
and 
dcb 
being 
proportional). 
But 
the 
line 
ea 
is 
to 
ca, 
or 
da, 
in 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
four 
times 
the 
rectangle 
ea.ad 
is 
to 
four 



times 
the 
square 
of 
ad, 
or, 
what 
is 
the 
same, 
the 
square 
of 
cd, 
since 
this 
is 
four 
times 
the 
square 
of 
ad; 
hence 
four 
times 
the 
rectangle 
ea.ad 
bears 
to 
the 
square 
of 
cd 
a 
greater 
ratio 
than 
the 
square 
of 
ed 
to 
the 
square 
of 
cd; 
but 
that 
would 
make 
four 
times 
the 
rectangle 
ea.ad 
greater 
than 
the 
square 
of 
ed; 
which 
is 
false, 
the 
fact 
being 
just 
the 
opposite, 
because 
the 
two 
portions 
ea 
and 
ad 
of 
the 
line 
ed 
are 
not 
equal. 
Therefore 
the 
line 
db 
touches 
the 
parabola 
withoutcuttingit. 


q. 
e. 
d. 
Simp. 
Your 
demonstration 
proceeds 
too 
rapidly 
and, 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
you 
keep 
on 
assuming 
that 
all 
of 
Euclid’s 
theorems 
are 
as 
familiar 
and 
available 
to 
me 
as 
his 
first 
axioms, 
which 
is 
far 
from 
true. 
And 
now 
this 
fact 
which 
you 
spring 
upon 
us, 
that 
four 
times 
the 
rectangle 
ea.ad 
is 
less 
than 
the 
square 
of 



de 
because 
the 
two 
portions 
ea 
and 
ad 
of 
the 
line 
de 
are 
not 
equal 
brings 
me 
littlecomposure 
ofmind,butratherleavesmein 
suspense. 


Salv. 
Indeed, 
all 
real 
mathematicians 
assume 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
reader 
perfect 
familiarity 
with 
at 
least 
the 
elements 
of 
Euclid; 
and 
here 
it 
is 
necessary 
in 
your 
case 
only 
to 
recall 
a 
proposition 
of 
the 
Second 
Book 
in 
which 
he 
proves 
that 
when 
a 
line 
is 
cut 
into 
equal 
and 
also 
into 
two 
unequal 
parts, 
the 
rectangle 
formed 
on 
the 
unequal 
parts 
is 
less 
than 
that 
formed 
on 
the 
equal 
(i. 
e., 
less 
than 
the 
square 
on 
half 
the 
line), 
by 
an 
amount 
which 
is 
the 
square 
of 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
equal 
and 
unequal 
segments. 
From 
this 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
square 
of 
the 
whole 
line 
which 
is 
equal 
to 
four 
times 
the 
square 
of 
the 
half 
is 
greater 
than 
four 
times 
the 
rectangle 
of 
the 
unequal 
parts. 
In 
order 
to 
understand 
the 
following 
portions 
of 
this 
treatise 
it 
will 
be 
necessary 
to 
keep 
in 
mind 
the 
two 
elemental 
theorems 
from 
conic 
sections 
which 
we 
have 
just 
demonstrated; 
and 
these 
two 
theorems 
are 
indeed 
the 
only 
ones 
which 
the 
Author 
uses. 
We 
can 
now 
resume 
the 
text 
and 
see 
how 
he 
demonstrates 
his 
first 
proposition 
in 
which

Let 
us 
imagine 
an 
elevated 
horizontal 
line 
or 
plane 
ab 
along 
which 
a 
body 
moves 
with 
uniform 
speed 
from 
a 
to 
b. 
Suppose 
this 
plane 
to 
end 
abruptly 
at 
b; 
then 
at 
this 
point 
the 
body 
will, 
on 
account 
of 
its 
weight, 
acquire 
also 
a 
natural 
motion 
downwards 
along 
the 
perpendicular 
bn. 
Draw 
the 
line 
be 
along 
the 
plane 
ba 
to 
represent 
the 
flow, 
or 
measure, 
of 
time; 
divide 
this 
line 
into 
a 
number 
of 
segments, 
bc, 
cd, 
de, 
representing 
equal 
intervals 
of 
time; 
from 
the 
points 
b, 
c, 
d, 
e, 
let 
fall 
lines 
which 
are 
parallel 
to 
the 
perpendicular 
bn. 
On 
the 
first 
of 
these 
lay 
off 
any 
distance 
ci, 
on 
the 
second 
a 
distance 
four 
times 
as 
long, 
df; 
on 
the 
third, 
one 
nine 
times 
as 
long, 
eh; 
and 
so 
on, 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
squares 
of 
cb, 
db, 
eb, 
or, 
we 
may 
say, 
in 
the 
squared 
ratio 
of 
these 
same 
lines. 
Accordingly 
we 
see 
that 
while 
the 
body 
moves 
from 
b 
to 
c 
with 
uniform 
speed, 
it 
also 
falls 
perpendicularly 
through 
the 
distance 
ci, 
and 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
time-interval 
bc 
finds 
itself 
at 
the 
point 
i. 
In 
like 
manner 
at 
theend 
ofthetime-interval 
bd, 
which 
is 
the 
double 
of 
bc, 
the 
vertical 
fall 
will 
be 
four 
times 
the 
first 
distance 
ci; 
for 
it 
has 
been 
shown 
in 
a 
previous 
discussion 
that 
the 
distance 
traversed 
by 
a 
freely 
falling 
body 
varies 
as 
the 
square 
of 
the 
time; 
in 
like 
manner 
the 
space 
eh 
traversed 
during 
the 
time 
be 



will 
be 
nine 
times 
ci; 
thus 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
the 
distances 
eh, 
df, 
ci 
will 
be 
to 
one 
another 
as 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
lines 
be, 
bd, 
bc. 
Now 
from 
the 
points 
i, 
f, 
h 
drawthestraightlines 
io, 
fg, 
hl 
parallel 
to 
be; 
theselines 
hl, 
fg, 
io 
are 
equalto 
eb, 
db 
and 
cb, 
respectively; 
so 
also 
are 
the 
lines 
bo, 
bg, 
bl 
respectively 
equal 
to 
ci, 
df, 
and 
eh. 
Thesquareof 
hl 
is 
to 
that 
of 
fg 
as 
the 
line 
lb 
is 
to 
bg; 
andthe 
squareof 
fg 
is 
tothatof 
io 
as 
gb 
is 
to 
bo; 
thereforethepoints 
i, 
f, 
h, 
lie 
on 
one 
and 
the 
same 
parabola. 
In 
like 
manner 
it 
may 
be 
shown 
that, 
if 
we 
take 
equal 
time-intervals 
of 
any 
size 
whatever, 
and 
if 
we 
imagine 
the 
particle 
to 
be 
carried 
by 
a 
similar 
compound 
motion, 
the 
positions 
of 
this 
particle, 
at 
the 
endsof 
these 
time-intervals,willlieon

q.e.d.
Salv. 
This 
conclusion 
follows 
from 
the 
converse 
of 
the 
first 
of 
the 
two 
propositions 
given 
above. 
For, 
having 
drawn 
a 
parabola 
through 
the 
points 
b 
and 
h, 
any 
other 
two 
points, 
f 
and 
i, 
not 
falling 
on 
the 
parabola 
must 
lie 
either 
within 
or 
without; 
consequently 
the 
line 
fg 
is 
either 
longer 
or 
shorter 
than 
the 
line 
whichterminates 
ontheparabola. 
Thereforethesquare 
of 
hl 
willnotbear 
to 
the 
square 
of 
fg 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
line 
lb 
to 
bg, 
but 
a 
greater 
or 
smaller; 



the 
fact 
is, 
however, 
that 
the 
square 
of 
hl 
does 
bear 
this 
same 
ratio 
to 
the 
square 
of 
fg. 
Hence 
the 
point 
f 
does 
lie 
on 
the 
parabola, 
and 
so 
do 
all 
the 
others. 


Sagr. 
One 
cannot 
deny 
that 
the 
argument 
is 
new, 
subtle 
and 
conclusive, 
resting 
as 
it 
does 
upon 
this 
hypothesis, 
namely, 
that 
the 
horizontal 
motion 
remains 
uniform, 
that 
the 
vertical 
motion 
continues 
to 
be 
accelerated 
downwards 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
square 
of 
the 
time, 
and 
that 
such 
motions 
and 
velocities 
as 
these 
combine 
without 
altering, 
disturbing, 
or 
hindering 
each 
other,37 
so 
that 
as 
the 
motion 
proceeds 
the 
path 
of 
the 
projectile 
does 
not 
change 
into 
a 
different 
curve: 
but 
this, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
is 
impossible. 
For 
the 
axis 
of 
the 
parabola 
along 
which 
we 
imagine 
the 
natural 
motion 
of 
a 
falling 
bodyto 
takeplacestandsperpendicular 
toahorizontal 
surface 
andends 
atthe 
center 
of 
the 
earth; 
and 
since 
the 
parabola 
deviates 
more 
and 
more 
from 
its 
axis 
no 
projectile 
can 
ever 
reach 
the 
center 
of 
the 
earth 
or, 
if 
it 
does, 
as 
seems 
necessary,then

[Trans.] 


Simp. 
To 
these 
difficulties, 
I 
may 
add 
others. 
One 
of 
these 
is 
that 
we 
suppose 
the 
horizontal 
plane, 
which 
slopes 
neither 
up 
nor 
down, 
to 
be 
represented 
by 
a 
straight 
line 
as 
if 
each 
point 
on 
this 
line 
were 
equally 
distant 
from 
the 
center, 
which 
is 
not 
the 
case; 
for 
as 
one 
starts 
from 
the 
middle 
[of 
the 
line] 
and 
goes 
toward 
either 
end, 
he 
departs 
farther 
and 
farther 
from 
the 
center 
[of 
the 
earth] 
and 
is 
therefore 
constantly 
going 
uphill. 
Whence 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
motion 
cannot 
remain 
uniform 
through 
any 
distance 
whatever, 
but 
must 
continually 
diminish. 
Besides, 
I 
do 
not 
see 
how 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
avoid 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
medium 
which 
must 
destroy 
the 
uniformity 
of 
the 
horizontal 
motion 
and 
change 
the 
law 
of 
acceleration 
of 
falling 
bodies. 
These 
various 
difficulties 
render 
it 
highly 
improbable 
that 
a 
result 
derived 
from 
such 
unreliablehypothesesshouldholdtrueinpractice. 


Salv. 
All 
these 
difficulties 
and 
objections 
which 
you 
urge 
are 
so 
well 
founded 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
remove 
them; 
and, 
as 
for 
me, 
I 
am 
ready 
to 
admit 
them 
all, 
which 
indeed 
I 
think 
our 
Author 
would 
also 
do. 
I 
grant 
that 
these 
conclusions 
proved 
in 
the 
abstract 
will 
be 
different 
when 
applied 
in 
the 



concrete 
and 
will 
be 
fallacious 
to 
this 
extent, 
that 
neither 
will 
the 
horizontal 
motion 
be 
uniform 
nor 
the 
natural 
acceleration 
be 
in 
the 
ratio 
assumed, 
nor 
the 
path 
of 
the 
projectile 
a 
parabola, 
etc. 
But, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
I 
ask 
you 
not 
to 
begrudge 
our 
Author 
that 
which 
other 
eminent 
men 
have 
assumed 
even 
if 
not 
strictly 
true. 
The 
authority 
of 
Archimedes 
alone 
will 
satisfy 
everybody. 
In 
his 
Mechanics 
and 
in 
his 
first 
quadrature 
of 
the 
parabola 
he 
takes 
for 
granted 
that 
the 
beam 
of 
a 
balance 
or 
steelyard 
is 
a 
straight 
line, 
every 
point 
of 
which 
is 
equidistant 
from 
the 
common 
center 
of 
all 
heavy 
bodies, 
and 
that 
the 
cords 
bywhichheavy 
bodiesaresuspendedare 
paralleltoeachother. 


Some 
consider 
this 
assumption 
permissible 
because, 
in 
practice, 
our 
instruments 
and 
the 
distances 
involved 
are 
so 
small 
in 
comparison 
with 
the 
enormous 
distance 
fromthe 
center 
ofthe 
earth 
thatwe 
may 
consider 
a 
minute 
of 
arc 
on 
a 
great 
circle 
as 
a 
straight 
line, 
and 
may 
regard 
the 
perpendiculars 
let 
fall 
from 
its 
two 
extremities 
as 
parallel. 
For 
if 
in 
actual 
practice 
one 
had 
to 
consider 
such 
small 
quantities, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
first 
of 
all 
to 
criticise 
the 
architects 
who 
presume, 
by 
use 
of 
a 
plumbline, 
to 
erect 
high 
towers 
with 
parallel 
sides. 
I 
may 
add 
that, 
in 
all 
their 
discussions, 
Archimedes 
and 
the 
others 
considered 
themselves 
as 
located 
at 
aninfinite 
distance 
from 
thecenter 
of 
the 
earth, 
in 
which 
case 
their 
assumptions 
were 
not 
false, 
and 
therefore 
their 
conclusions 
were 
absolutely 
correct. 
When 
we 
wish 
to 
apply 
our 
proven 
conclusions 
to 
distances 
which, 
though 
finite, 
are 
very 
large, 
it 
is 
necessary 
for 
us 
to 
infer, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
demonstrated 
truth, 
what 
correction 
is 
to 
be 
made 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
our 
distance 
from 
the 
center 
of 
the 
earth 
is 
not 
really 
infinite, 
but 
merely 
very 
great 
in 
comparison 
with 
the 
small 
dimensions 
of 
our 
apparatus. 
The 
largest 
of 
these 
will 
be 
the 
range 
of 
our 
projectiles 
— 
and 
even 
here 
we 
need 
consider 
only 
the 
artillery 
— 
which, 
however 
great, 
will 
never 
exceed 
four 
of 
those 
miles 
of 
which 
as 
many 
thousand 
separate 
us 
from 
the 
center 
of 
the 
earth; 
and 
since 
these 
paths 
terminate 
upon 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
earth 
only 
very 
slight 
changes 
can 
take 
place 
in 
their 
parabolic 
figure 
which, 
it 
is 
conceded, 
would 
be 
greatly 
altered 
if 
they 
terminated 
at 
the 
center 
of 
the 
earth. 


As 
to 
the 
perturbation 
arising 
from 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
medium 
this 
is 
more 
considerable 
and 
does 
not, 
on 
account 
of 
its 
manifold 
forms, 
submit 
to 
fixed 
laws 
and 
exact 
description. 
Thus 
if 
we 
consider 
only 
the 
resistance 
which 
the 
air 
offers 
to 
the 
motions 
studied 
by 
us, 
we 
shall 
see 
that 
it 
disturbs 
them 
all 
and 
disturbs 
them 
in 
an 
infinite 
variety 
of 
ways 
corresponding 
to 
the 
infinite 
variety 
in 
the 
form, 
weight, 
and 
velocity 
of 
the 
projectiles. 
For 
as 
to 



velocity, 
the 
greater 
this 
is, 
the 
greater 
will 
be 
the 
resistance 
offered 
by 
the 
air; 
a 
resistance 
which 
will 
be 
greater 
as 
the 
moving 
bodies 
become 
less 
dense 
[men 
gravi]. 
So 
that 
although 
the 
falling 
body 
ought 
to 
be 
displaced 
[andare 
accelerandosi] 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
square 
of 
the 
duration 
of 
its 
motion, 
yet 
no 
matter 
how 
heavy 
the 
body, 
if 
it 
falls 
from 
a 
very 
considerable 
height, 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
air 
will 
be 
such 
as 
to 
prevent 
any 
increase 
in 
speed 
and 
will 
render 
the 
motion 
uniform; 
and 
in 
proportion 
as 
the 
moving 
body 
is 
less 
dense 
[men 
grave] 
this 
uniformity 
will 
be 
so 
much 
the 
more 
quickly 
attained 
and 
after 
a 
shorter 
fall. 
Even 
horizontal 
motion 
which, 
if 
no 
impediment 
were 
offered, 
would 
be 
uniform 
and 
constant 
is 
altered 
by 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
air 
and 
finally 
ceases; 
and 
here 
again 
the 
less 
dense 
[più 
leggiero] 
the 
body 
the 
quicker 
the 
process. 
Of 
these 
properties 
[accidenti] 
of 
weight, 
of 
velocity, 
and 
also 
of 
form 
[figura], 
infinite 
in 
number, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
give 
any 
exact 
description; 
hence, 
in 
order 
to 
handle 
this 
matter 
in 
a 
scientific 
way, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
cut 
loose 
from 
these 
difficulties; 
and 
having 
discovered 
and 
demonstrated 
the 
theorems, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
no 
resistance, 
to 
use 
them 
and 
apply 
them 
with 
such 
limitations 
as 
experience 
will 
teach. 
And 
the 
advantage 
of 
this 
method 
will 
not 
be 
small; 
for 
the 
material 
and 
shape 
of 
the 
projectile 
may 
be 
chosen, 
as 
dense 
and 
round 
as 
possible, 
so 
that 
it 
will 
encounter 
the 
least 
resistance 
in 
the 
medium. 
Nor 
will 
thespacesandvelocitiesingeneralbe 
sogreatbutthatweshall 
beeasilyable 
tocorrectthemwithprecision. 


In 
the 
case 
of 
those 
projectiles 
which 
we 
use, 
made 
of 
dense 
[grave] 
material 
and 
round 
in 
shape, 
or 
of 
lighter 
material 
and 
cylindrical 
in 
shape, 
such 
as 
arrows, 
thrown 
from 
a 
sling 
or 
crossbow, 
the 
deviation 
from 
an 
exact 
parabolic 
path 
is 
quite 
insensible. 
Indeed, 
if 
you 
will 
allow 
me 
a 
little 
greater 
liberty, 
I 
can 
show 
you, 
by 
two 
experiments, 
that 
the 
dimensions 
of 
our 
apparatus 
are 
so 
small 
that 
these 
external 
and 
incidental 
resistances, 
among 
which 
thatof 
themediumis 
the 
mostconsiderable, 
are 
scarcelyobservable. 


I 
now 
proceed 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
motions 
through 
the 
air, 
since 
it 
is 
with 
these 
that 
we 
are 
now 
especially 
concerned; 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
air 
exhibits 
itself 
in 
two 
ways: 
first 
by 
offering 
greater 
impedance 
to 
less 
dense 
than 
to 
very 
dense 
bodies, 
and 
secondly 
by 
offering 
greater 
resistance 
to 
a 
bodyin 
rapid 
motionthanto 
the 
same 
bodyinslow 
motion. 


Regardingthe 
firstofthese, 
consider 
thecaseof 
two 
balls 
having 
the 
same 
dimensions, 
but 
one 
weighing 
ten 
or 
twelve 
times 
as 
much 
as 
the 
other; 
one, 



say, 
of 
lead, 
the 
other 
of 
oak, 
both 
allowed 
to 
fall 
from 
an 
elevation 
of 
150 
or 
200 
cubits. 


Experiment 
shows 
that 
they 
will 
reach 
the 
earth 
with 
slight 
difference 
in 
speed,showing 
us 
that 
inbothcases 
the 
retardation 
causedby 
theair 
is 
small; 
for 
if 
both 
balls 
start 
at 
the 
same 
moment 
and 
at 
the 
same 
elevation, 
and 
if 
the 
leaden 
one 
be 
slightly 
retarded 
and 
the 
wooden 
one 
greatly 
retarded, 
then 
the 
former 
ought 
to 
reach 
the 
earth 
a 
considerable 
distance 
in 
advance 
of 
the 
latter, 
since 
it 
is 
ten 
times 
as 
heavy. 
But 
this 
does 
not 
happen; 
indeed, 
the 
gain 
in 
distance 
of 
one 
over 
the 
other 
does 
not 
amount 
to 
the 
hundredth 
part 
of 
the 
entire 
fall. 
And 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
ball 
of 
stone 
weighing 
only 
a 
third 
or 
half 
as 
much 
as 
one 
of 
lead, 
the 
difference 
in 
their 
times 
of 
reaching 
the 
earth 
will 
be 
scarcely 
noticeable. 
Now 
since 
the 
speed 
[impeto] 
acquired 
by 
a 
leaden 
ball 
in 
falling 
from 
a 
height 
of 
200 
cubits 
is 
so 
great 
that 
if 
the 
motion 
remained 
uniform 
the 
ball 
would, 
in 
an 
interval 
of 
time 
equal 
to 
that 
of 
the 
fall,traverse 
400 
cubits, 
and 
since 
this 
speed 
is 
so 
considerable 
in 
comparison 
with 
those 
which, 
by 
use 
of 
bows 
or 
other 
machines 
except 
fire 
arms, 
we 
are 
able 
to 
give 
to 
our 
projectiles, 
it 
follows 
that 
we 
may, 
without 
sensible 
error, 
regard 
as 
absolutely 
true 
those 
propositions 
which 
we 
are 
about 
to 
prove 
withoutconsideringtheresistanceofthemedium. 


Passing 
now 
to 
the 
second 
case, 
where 
we 
have 
to 
show 
that 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
air 
for 
a 
rapidly 
moving 
body 
is 
not 
very 
much 
greater 
than 
for 
one 
moving 
slowly, 
ample 
proof 
is 
given 
by 
the 
following 
experiment. 
Attach 
to 
two 
threads 
of 
equal 
length 
— 
say 
four 
or 
five 
yards 
— 
two 
equal 
leaden 
balls 
and 
suspend 
them 
from 
the 
ceiling; 
now 
pull 
them 
aside 
from 
the 
perpendicular, 
the 
one 
through 
80 
or 
more 
degrees, 
the 
other 
through 
not 
more 
than 
four 
or 
five 
degrees; 
so 
that, 
when 
set 
free, 
the 
one 
falls, 
passes 
through 
the 
perpendicular, 
and 
describes 
large 
but 
slowly 
decreasing 
arcs 
of 
160, 
150, 
140 
degrees, 
etc.; 
the 
other 
swinging 
through 
small 
and 
also 
slowly 
diminishingarcs 
of10,8,6,degrees, 
etc. 


In 
the 
first 
place 
it 
must 
be 
remarked 
that 
one 
pendulum 
passes 
through 
its 
arcs 
of 
180°, 
160°, 
etc., 
in 
the 
same 
time 
that 
the 
other 
swings 
through 
its 
10°, 
8°, 
etc., 
from 
which 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
speed 
of 
the 
first 
ball 
is 
16 
and 
18 
times 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
the 
second. 
Accordingly, 
if 
the 
air 
offers 
more 
resistance 
to 
the 
high 
speed 
than 
to 
the 
low, 
the 
frequency 
of 
vibration 
in 
the 
large 
arcs 
of 
180° 
or 
160°, 
etc., 
ought 
to 
be 
less 
than 
in 
the 
small 
arcs 
of 
10°, 
8°, 
4°, 
etc., 
and 
even 
less 
than 
in 
arcs 
of 
2°, 
or 
1°; 
but 
this 
prediction 
is 
not 
verified 
by 
experiment; 
because 
if 
two 
persons 
start 
to 
count 
the 
vibrations, 



the 
one 
the 
large, 
the 
other 
the 
small, 
they 
will 
discover 
that 
after 
counting 
tens 
and 
even 
hundreds 
they 
will 
not 
differ 
by 
a 
single 
vibration, 
not 
even 
by 
a 
fractionofone. 


Sagr. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
since 
we 
cannot 
deny 
that 
the 
air 
hinders 
both 
of 
these 
motions, 
both 
becoming 
slower 
and 
finally 
vanishing, 
we 
have 
to 
admit 
that 
the 
retardation 
occurs 
in 
the 
same 
proportion 
in 
each 
case. 
But 
how? 
How, 
indeed, 
could 
the 
resistance 
offered 
to 
the 
one 
body 
be 
greater 
than 
that 
offered 
to 
the 
other 
except 
by 
the 
impartation 
of 
more 
momentum 
and 
speed 
[impeto 
e 
velocità] 
to 
the 
fast 
body 
than 
to 
the 
slow? 
And 
if 
this 
is 
so 
the 
speed 
with 
which 
a 
body 
moves 
is 
at 
once 
the 
cause 
and 
measure 
[cagione 
e 
misura] 
of 
the 
resistance 
which 
it 
meets. 
Therefore, 
all 
motions, 
fast 
or 
slow, 
are 
hindered 
and 
diminished 
in 
the 
same 
proportion; 
a 
result, 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
ofno 
smallimportance. 


Salv. 
We 
are 
able, 
therefore, 
in 
this 
second 
case 
to 
say 
that 
the 
errors, 
neglecting 
those 
which 
are 
accidental, 
in 
the 
results 
which 
we 
are 
about 
to 
demonstrate 
are 
small 
in 
the 
case 
of 
our 
machines 
where 
the 
velocities 
employed 
are 
mostly 
very 
great 
and 
the 
distances 
negligible 
in 
comparison 
withthesemidiameterofthe 
earth 
orone 
ofitsgreatcircles. 


Simp. 
I 
would 
like 
to 
hear 
your 
reason 
for 
putting 
the 
projectiles 
of 
fire 
arms, 


i. 
e., 
those 
using 
powder, 
in 
a 
different 
class 
from 
the 
projectiles 
employed 
in 
bows, 
slings, 
and 
crossbows, 
on 
the 
ground 
of 
their 
not 
being 
equally 
subject 
tochange 
andresistancefromtheair. 
Salv. 
I 
am 
led 
to 
this 
view 
by 
the 
excessive 
and, 
so 
to 
speak, 
supernatural 
violence 
with 
which 
such 
projectiles 
are 
launched; 
for, 
indeed, 
it 
appears 
to 
me 
that 
without 
exaggeration 
one 
might 
say 
that 
the 
speed 
of 
a 
ball 
fired 
either 
from 
a 
musket 
or 
from 
a 
piece 
of 
ordnance 
is 
supernatural. 
For 
if 
such 
a 
ball 
be 
allowed 
to 
fall 
fromsome 
greatelevation 
itsspeed 
will, 
owing 
to 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
air, 
not 
go 
on 
increasing 
indefinitely; 
that 
which 
happens 
to 
bodies 
of 
small 
density 
in 
falling 
through 
short 
distances 
— 
I 
mean 
the 
reduction 
oftheir 
motion 
touniformity 
— 
will 
also 
happentoaballofiron 
or 
lead 
after 
it 
has 
fallen 
a 
few 
thousand 
cubits; 
this 
terminal 
or 
final 
speed 
[terminata 
velocità] 
is 
the 
maximum 
which 
such 
a 
heavy 
body 
can 
naturally 



acquire 
in 
falling 
through 
the 
air. 
This 
speed 
I 
estimate 
to 
be 
much 
smaller 
thanthatimpressedupontheball 
bythe 
burning 
powder. 


An 
appropriate 
experiment 
will 
serve 
to 
demonstrate 
this 
fact. 
From 
a 
height 
of 
one 
hundred 
or 
more 
cubits 
fire 
a 
gun 
[archibuso] 
loaded 
with 
a 
lead 
bullet, 
vertically 
downwards 
upon 
a 
stone 
pavement; 
with 
the 
same 
gun 
shoot 
against 
a 
similar 
stone 
from 
a 
distance 
of 
one 
or 
two 
cubits, 
and 
observe 
which 
of 
the 
two 
balls 
is 
the 
more 
flattened. 
Now 
if 
the 
ball 
which 
has 
come 
from 
the 
greater 
elevation 
is 
found 
to 
be 
the 
less 
flattened 
of 
the 
two, 
this 
will 
show 
that 
the 
air 
has 
hindered 
and 
diminished 
the 
speed 
initially 
imparted 
to 
the 
bullet 
by 
the 
powder, 
and 
that 
the 
air 
will 
not 
permit 
a 
bullet 
to 
acquire 
so 
great 
a 
speed, 
no 
matter 
from 
what 
height 
it 
falls; 
for 
if 
the 
speed 
impressed 
upon 
the 
ball 
by 
the 
fire 
does 
not 
exceed 
that 
acquired 
by 
it 
in 
falling 
freely 
[naturalmente] 
then 
its 
downward 
blow 
ought 
to 
be 
greaterrather 
thanless. 


This 
experiment 
I 
have 
not 
performed, 
but 
I 
am 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
a 
musket-ball 
or 
cannon-shot, 
falling 
from 
a 
height 
as 
great 
as 
you 
please, 
will 
not 
deliver 
so 
strong 
a 
blow 
as 
it 
would 
if 
fired 
into 
a 
wall 
only 
a 
few 
cubits 
distant, 
i. 
e., 
at 
such 
a 
short 
range 
that 
the 
splitting 
or 
rending 
of 
the 
air 
will 
not 
be 
sufficient 
to 
rob 
the 
shot 
of 
that 
excess 
of 
supernatural 
violence 
given 
it 
bythepowder. 


The 
enormous 
momentum 
[impeto] 
of 
these 
violent 
shots 
may 
cause 
some 
deformation 
of 
the 
trajectory, 
making 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
parabola 
flatter 
and 
less 
curved 
than 
the 
end; 
but, 
so 
far 
as 
our 
Author 
is 
concerned, 
this 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
small 
consequence 
in 
practical 
operations, 
the 
main 
one 
of 
which 
is 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
table 
of 
ranges 
for 
shots 
of 
high 
elevation, 
giving 
the 
distance 
attained 
by 
the 
ball 
as 
a 
function 
of 
the 
angle 
of 
elevation; 
and 
since 
shots 
of 
this 
kind 
are 
fired 
from 
mortars 
[mortari] 
using 
small 
charges 
and 
imparting 
no 
supernatural 
momentum 
[impeto 
sopranaturale] 
they 
follow 
theirprescribedpathsveryexactly. 


But 
now 
let 
us 
proceed 
with 
the 
discussion 
in 
which 
the 
Author 
invites 
us 
to 
the 
study 
and 
investigation 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
a 
body 
[impeto 
del 
mobile] 
when 
that 
motion 
is 
compounded 
of 
two 
others; 
and 
first 
the 
case 
in 
which 
thetwo 
areuniform,theonehorizontal,theothervertical. 


TheoremII,

When 
the 
motion 
of 
a 
body 
is 
the 
resultant 
of 
two 
uniform 
motions, 
one 
horizontal, 
the 
other 
perpendicular, 
the 
square 
of 
the 
resultant 
momentum 
is 
equaltothesumofthesquaresofthetwocomponentmomenta.38

In 
the 
original 
thistheorem 
reads 
asfollows: 


“Si

the 
justification 
of 
this 
translation 
of 
the 
word 
“potentia” 
and 
of 
the 
use 
oftheadjective

Let 
us 
imagine 
any 
body 
urged 
by 
two 
uniform 
motions 
and 
let 
ab 
represent 
the 
vertical 
displacement, 
while 
bc 
represents 
the 
displacement 
which, 
in 
the 
same 
interval 
of 
time, 
takes 
place 
in 
a 
horizontal 
direction. 
If 
thenthedistances 
ab 
and 
bc 
are 
traversed,duringthesametime-interval,with 
uniform 
motions 
the 
corresponding 
momenta 
will 
be 
to 
each 
other 
as 
the 
distances 
ab 
and 
bc 
are 
to 
each 
other; 
but 
the 
body 
which 
is 
urged 
by 
these 
two 
motions 
describes 
the 
diagonal 
ac; 
its 
momentum 
is 
proportional 
to 
ac. 
Also 
the 
square 
of 
ac 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
squares 
of 
ab 
and 
bc. 
Hence 
the 
square 
of 
the 
resultant 
momentum 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
squares 
of 
thetwo

just 
one 
slight 
difficulty

needs 
to 
be 
cleared 
up; 
for 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
the 
conclusion 
just 
reached 
contradicts 
a 
previous 
proposition39 
in 
which 
it 
is 
claimed 
that 
the

a

coming 
from

to

is 
equal 
to 
that

Both 
propositions, 
Simplicio, 
are 
true, 
yet 
there 
is 
a 
great 
difference 
between 
them. 
Here 
we 
are 
speaking 
of 
a 
body 
urged 
by 
a 
single 
motion 
which 
is 
the 
resultant 
of 
two 
uniform 
motions, 
while 
there 
we 
were 
speaking 
of 
two 
bodies

urged 
with 
naturally 
accelerated

along

the

Our 
Author 
next 
undertakes 
to 
explainwhat 
happenswhen 
a 
body 
is 
urged 
by 
a 
motion 
compounded 
of 
one 
which 
is 
horizontal 
and 
uniform 
and 
of 
another 
which 
is 
vertical 
but 
naturally 
accelerated; 
from 
these 
two 
components 
results 
the 
path 
of 
a 
projectile, 
which 
is 
a 
parabola. 
The 
problem 
is 
to 
determine 
the 
speed 
[impeto] 
of 
the 
projectile 
at 
each 
point. 
With 
this 
purpose 
in 
view 
our 
Author 
sets 
forth 
as 
follows 
the 
manner, 
or 
rather 
the 
method, 
of 
measuring 
such 
speed 
[impeto] 
along 
the 
path 
which 
is 
taken 
by 
a 
heavy 
bodystartingfromrest 
andfalling 
witha 
naturallyacceleratedmotion. 


TheoremIII, 
PropositionIII 


Let 
the 
motion 
take 
place 
along 
the 
line 
ab, 
starting 
from 
rest 
at 
a, 
and 
in 
this 
line 
choose 
any 
point 
c. 
Let 
ac 
represent 
the 
time, 
or 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
time, 
required 
for 
the 
body 
to 
fall 
through 
the 
space 
ac; 
let 
ac 
also 
represent 
the 
velocity 
[impetus 
seu 
momentum] 
at 
c 
acquired 
by 
a 
fall 
through 
the 
distance 
ac. 
In 
the 
line 
ab 
select 
any 
other 
point 
b. 
The 
problem 
now 
is 
to 
determine 
the 
velocity 
at 
b 
acquired 
by 
a 
body 
in 
falling 
through 
the 
distance 
ab 
and 
to 
express 
this 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
velocity 
at 
c, 
the 
measure 
of 
which 
is 
the 
length 
ac. 
Take 
as 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
ac 
and 
ab. 
We 
shall 
prove 
that 
the 
velocity 
at 
b 
is 
to 
that 
at 
c 
as 
the 
length 
as 
is 
to 
the 
length 
ac. 
Draw 
the 



horizontal 
line 
cd, 
having 
twice 
the 
length 
of 
ac, 
and 
be, 
having 
twice 
the 
length 
of 
ba. 
It 
then 
follows, 
from 
the 
preceding 
theorems, 
that 
a 
body 
falling 
through 
the 
distance 
ac, 
and 
turned 
so 
as 
to 
move 
along 
the 
horizontal 
cd 
with 
a 
uniform 
speed 
equal 
to 
that 
acquired 
on 
reaching 
c 
will 
traverse 
the 
distance 
cd 
in 
the 
same 
interval 
of 
time 
as 
that 
required 
to 
fall 
with 
accelerated 
motion 
from 
a 
to 
c. 
Likewise 
be 
will 
be 
traversed 
in 
the 
same 
time 
as 
ba. 
But 
the 
time 
of 
descent 
through 
ab 
is 
as; 
hence 
the 
horizontal 
distance 
be 
is 
also 
traversed 
in 
the 
time 
as. 
Take 
a 
point 
l 
such 
that 
the 
time 
as 
is 
to 
the 
time 
ac 
as 
be 
is 
to 
bl; 
since 
the 
motion 
along 
be 
is 
uniform, 
the 
distance 
bl, 
if 
traversed 
with 
the 
speed 
[momentum 
celeritatis] 
acquired 
at 
b, 
will 
occupy 
the 
time 
ac; 
but 
in 
this 
same 
time-interval, 
ac, 
the 
distance 
cd 
is 
traversed 
with 
the 
speed 
acquired 
in 
c. 
Now 
two 
speeds 
are 
to 
each 
other 
as 
the 
distances 
traversed 
in 
equal 
intervals 
of 
time. 
Hence 
the 
speed 
at 
c 
is 
to 
the 
speed 
at 
b 
as 
cd 
is 
to 
bl. 
But 
since 
dc 
is 
to 
be 
as 
their 
halves, 
namely, 
as 
ca 
is 
to 
ba, 
and 
since 
be 
is 
to 
bl 
as 
ba 
is 
to 
sa; 
it 
follows 
that 
dc 
is 
to 
bl 
as 
ca 
is 
to 
sa. 
In 
other 
words, 
the 
speed 
at 
c 
is 
to 
that 
at 
b 
as 
ca 
is 
to 
sa, 
that 
is, 
as 


thetimeoffallthroughab.
The 
methodofmeasuringthe 
speed 
of 
a 
body 
along 
thedirection 
of 
its 
fall 
is 
thusclear;the 
speedisassumed 
toincrease 
directlyas 
the 
time. 



But 
before 
we 
proceed 
further, 
since 
this 
discussion 
is 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
motion 
compounded 
of 
a 
uniform 
horizontal 
one 
and 
one 
accelerated 
vertically 
downwards 
— 
the 
path 
of 
a 
projectile, 
namely, 
a 
parabola 
— 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
we 
define 
some 
common 
standard 
by 
which 
we 
may 
estimate 
the 
velocity, 
or 
momentum 
[velocitatem, 
impetum 
seu 
momentum] 
of 
both 
motions; 
and 
since 
from 
the 
innumerable 
uniform 
velocities 
one 
only, 
and 
that 
not 
selected 
at 
random, 
is 
to 
be 
compounded 
with 
a 
velocity 
acquired 
by 
naturally 
accelerated 
motion, 
I 
can 
think 
of 
no 
simpler 
way 
of 
selecting 
and 
measuring 
this 
than 
to 
assume 
another 
of 
the 
same 
kind.40 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
clearness, 
draw 
the 
vertical 
line 
ac 
to 
meet 
the 
horizontal 
line 
bc. 
Ac 
is 
the 
height 
and 
bc 
the 
amplitude 
of 
the 
semi-parabola 
ab, 
which 
is 
the 
resultant 
of 
the 
two 
motions, 
one 
that 
of 
a 
body 
falling 
from 
rest 
at 
a, 
through 
the 
distance 
ac, 
with 
naturally 
accelerated 
motion, 
the 
other 
a 
uniform 
motion 
alongthehorizontal 
ad. 
The 
speed 
acquired 
at 
c 
by 
a 
fall 
through 
the 
distance 
ac 
is 
determined 
by 
the 
height 
ac; 
for 
the 
speed 
of 
a 
body 
falling 
from 
the 
same 
elevation 
is 
always 
one 
and 
the 
same; 
but 
along 
the 
horizontal 
one 
may 
give 
a 
body 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
uniform 
speeds. 
However, 
in 
order 
that 
I 
may 
select 
one 
out 
of 
this 
multitude 
and 
separate 
it 
from 
the 
rest 
in 
a 
perfectly 
definite 
manner, 
I 
will 
extend 
the 
height 
ca 
upwards 
to 
e 
just 
as 
far 
as 
is 
necessary 
and 
will 
call 
this 
distance 
ae 
the 
“sublimity.” 
Imagine 
a 
body 
to 
fall 
from 
rest 
at 
e; 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
we 
may 
make 
its 
terminal 
speed 
at 
a 
the 
same 
as 
that 
with 
which 
the 
same 
body 
travels 
along 
the 
horizontal 
line 
ad; 
this 
speed 
will 
be 
such 
that, 
in 
the 
time 
of 
descent 
along 
ea, 
it 
will 
describe 
a 
horizontal 
distance 
twice 
the 
length 
of 
ea. 
This 
preliminary 
remark 
seems 
necessary. 


40 
Galileo 
here 
proposes 
to 
employ 
as 
a 
standard 
of 
velocity 
the 
terminal 
speed 
of 
a 
body 
falling 
freely 
froma 
givenheight.

Sagr. 
Allow 
me, 
please,tointerruptin 
order 
that 
I 
may 
pointout 
the 
beautiful 
agreement 
between 
this 
thought 
of 
the 
Author 
and 
the 
views 
of 
Plato 
concerning 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
various 
uniform 
speeds 
with 
which 
the 
heavenly 
bodies 
revolve. 
The 
latter 
chanced 
upon 
the 
idea 
that 
a 
body 
could 
not 
pass 
from 
rest 
to 
any 
given 
speed 
and 
maintain 
it 
uniformly 
except 
by 
passing 
through 
all 
the 
degrees 
of 
speed 
intermediate 
between 
the 
given 
speed 
and 
rest. 
Plato 
thought 
that 
God, 
after 
having 
created 
the 
heavenly 
bodies, 
assigned 
them 
the 
proper 
anduniform 
speeds 
withwhich 
theywere 
forever 
to 



revolve; 
and 
that 
He 
made 
them 
start 
from 
rest 
and 
move 
over 
definite 
distances 
under 
a 
natural 
and 
rectilinear 
acceleration 
such 
as 
governs 
the 
motion 
of 
terrestrial 
bodies. 
He 
added 
that 
once 
these 
bodies 
had 
gained 
their 
proper 
and 
permanent 
speed, 
their 
rectilinear 
motion 
was 
converted 
into 
a 
circular 
one, 
the 
only 
motion 
capable 
of 
maintaining 
uniformity, 
a 
motion 
in 
which 
the 
body 
revolves 
without 
either 
receding 
from 
or 
approaching 
its 
desired 
goal. 
This 
conception 
is 
truly 
worthy 
of 
Plato; 
and 
it 
is 
to 
be 
all 
the 
more 
highly 
prized 
since 
its 
underlying 
principles 
remained 
hidden 
until 
discovered 
by 
our 
Author 
who 
removed 
from 
them 
the 
mask 
and 
poetical 
dress 
and 
set 
forth 
the 
idea 
in 
correct 
historical 
perspective. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
astronomical 
science 
furnishes 
us 
such 
complete 
information 
concerning 
the 
size 
of 
the 
planetary 
orbits, 
the 
distances 
of 
these 
bodies 
from 
their 
centers 
of 
revolution, 
and 
their 
velocities, 
I 
cannot 
help 
thinking 
that 
our 
Author 
(to 
whom 
this 
idea 
of 
Plato 
was 
not 
unknown) 
had 
some 
curiosity 
to 
discover 
whether 
or 
not 
a 
definite 
“sublimity” 
might 
be 
assigned 
to 
each 
planet, 
such 
that, 
if 
it 
were 
to 
start 
from 
rest 
at 
this 
particular 
height 
and 
to 
fall 
with 
naturally 
accelerated 
motion 
along 
a 
straight 
line, 
and 
were 
later 
to 
change 
the 
speed 
thus 
acquired 
into 
uniform 
motion, 
the 
size 
of 
its 
orbit 
and 
itsperiod 
ofrevolutionwould 
bethoseactuallyobserved. 


Salv. 
I 
think 
I 
remember 
his 
having 
told 
me 
that 
he 
once 
made 
the 
computation 
and 
found 
a 
satisfactory 
correspondence 
with 
observation. 
But 
he 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
speak 
of 
it, 
lest 
in 
view 
of 
the 
odium 
which 
his 
many 
new 
discoveries 
had 
already 
brought 
upon 
him, 
this 
might 
be 
adding 
fuel 
to 
the 
fire. 
But 
if 
any 
one 
desires 
such 
information 
he 
can 
obtain 
it 
for 
himself 
from 
thetheorysetforth 
inthepresenttreatment.

Problem 
I, 
PropositionIV 


To 
determine 
the 
momentum 
of 
a 
projectile 
at 
each 
particular 
point 
in 
its 
givenparabolicpath. 


Let 
bec 
be 
the 
semi-parabola 
whose 
amplitude 
is 
cd 
and 
whose 
height 
is 
db, 
which 
latter 
extended 
upwards 
cuts 
the 
tangent 
of 
the 
parabola 
ca 
in 
a. 
Through 
the 
vertex 
draw 
the 
horizontal 
line 
bi 
parallel 
to 
cd. 
Now 
if 
the 
amplitude 
cd 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
entire 
height 
da, 
then 
bi 
will 
be 
equal 
to 
ba 
and 
also 
to 
bd; 
and 
if 
we 
take 
ab 
as 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
time 
required 
for 
fall 



through 
the 
distance 
ab 
and 
also 
of 
the 
momentum 
acquired 
at 
b 
in 
consequence 
of 
its 
fall 
from 
rest 
at 
a, 
then 
if. 
we 
turn 
into 
a 
horizontal 
direction 
the 
momentum 
acquired 
by 
fall 
through 
ab 
[impetum 
ab] 
the 
space 
traversedin 
thesameintervalof 
timewillbe 
represented 
by 
dc 
which 
istwice 
bi. 
But 
a 
body 
which 
falls 
from 
rest 
at 
b 
along 
the 
line 
bd 
will 
during 
the 
same 
time-interval 
fall 
through 
the 
height 
of 
the 
parabola 
bd. 
Hence 
a 
body 
falling 
from 
rest 
at 
a, 
turned 
into 
a 
horizontal 
direction 
with 
the 
speed 
ab 
will 
traverse 
a 
space 
equal 
to 
dc. 
Now 
if 
one 
superposes 
upon 
this 
motion 
a 
fall 
along 
bd, 
traversing 
the 
height 
bd 
while 
the 
parabola 
bc 
is 
described, 
then 
the 
momentum 
of 
the 
body 
at 
the 
terminal 
point 
c 
is 
the 
resultant 
of 
a 
uniform 
horizontal 
momentum, 
whose 
value 
is 
represented 
by 
ab, 
and 
of 
another 
momentum 
acquired 
by 
fall 
from 
b 
to 
the 
terminal 
point 
d 
or 
c; 
these 
two 
momentaareequal. 
If,therefore,wetake 
ab 
to 
be 
the 
measure 
of 
one 
of 
these 
momenta, 
say, 
the 
uniform 
horizontal 
one, 
then 
bi, 
which 
is 
equal 
to 
bd, 
will 
represent 
the 
momentum 
acquired 
at 
d 
or 
c; 
and 
ia 
will 
represent 
the 
resultant 
of 
these 
two 
momenta, 
that 
is, 
the 
total 
momentum 
with 
which 
the 
projectile, 
travellingalongtheparabola,strikesat 
c. 


With 
this 
in 
mind 
let 
us 
take 
any 
point 
on 
the 
parabola, 
say 
e, 
and 
determine 
the 
momentum 
with 
which 
the 
projectile 
passes 
that 
point. 
Draw 
the 
horizontal 
ef 
and 
take 
bg 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
bd 
and 
bf. 
Now 
since 
ab, 
or 
bd, 
is 
assumed 
to 
be 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
time 
and 
of 
the 
momentum[momentum 
velocitatis] 
acquired 
by 
falling 
from 
rest 
at 
b 
through 
the 
distance 
bd, 
it 
follows 
that 
bg 
will 
measure 
the 
time 
and 
also 
the 
momentum 
[impetus] 
acquired 
at 
f 
by 
fall 
from 
b. 
If 
therefore 
we 
lay 
off 
bo, 
equal 
to 
bg, 
the 
diagonal 
line 
joining 
a 
and 
o 
will 
represent 
the 
momentum 
at 
the 
point 
e; 
because 
the 
length 
ab 
has 
been 
assumed 
to 
represent 
the 
momentum 
at 
b 
which, 
after 
diversion 
into 
a 
horizontal 
direction, 
remains 
constant; 
and 
because 
bo 
measures 
the 
momentum 
at 
f 
or 
e, 
acquired 
by 
fall, 
from 
rest 
at 
b, 
through 
the 
height 
bf. 
But 
the 
square 
of 
ao 
equals 
the 
sum 
of 
thesquaresof 
ab 
and 
bo.

Sagr. 
The 
manner 
in 
which 
you 
compound 
these 
different 
momenta 
to 
obtain 
their 
resultant 
strikes 
me 
as 
so 
novel 
that 
my 
mind 
is 
left 
in 
no 
small 
confusion. 
I 
do 
not 
refer 
to 
the 
composition 
of 
two 
uniform 
motions, 
even 
when 
unequal, 
and 
when 
one 
takes 
place 
along 
a 
horizontal, 
the 
other 
along 
a 
vertical 
direction; 
because 
in 
this 
case 
I 
am 
thoroughly 
convinced 
that 
the 
resultant 
is 
a 
motion 
whose 
square 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
two 
components. 
The 
confusion 
arises 
when 
one 
undertakes 
to 
compound 
a 
uniform 
horizontal 
motion 
with 
a 
vertical 
one 
which 
is 
naturally 
accelerated. 
Itrust,therefore,wemaypursue 
thisdiscussionmoreat 
length. 


And 
I 
need 
this 
even 
more 
than 
you 
since 
I 
am 
not 
yet 
as 
clear 
in 
my 
mind 
as 
I 
ought 
to 
be 
concerning 
those 
fundamental 
propositions 
upon 
which 
the 
others 
rest. 
Even 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
two 
uniform 
motions, 
one 
horizontal, 
the 
other 
perpendicular, 
I 
wish 
to 
understand 
better 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
you 



obtain 
the 
resultant 
from 
the 
components. 
Now, 
Salviati, 
you 
understand 
whatweneedandwhatwedesire. 
Salv. 
Your 
request 
is 
altogether 
reasonable 
and 
I 
will 
see 
whether 
my 
long 
consideration 
of 
these 
matters 
will 
enable 
me 
to 
make 
them 
clear 
to 
you. 
But 
you 
must 
excuse 
me 
if 
in 
the 
explanation 
I 
repeat 
many 
thingsalready 
said 
by 
theAuthor. 


Concerning 
motions 
and 
their 
velocities 
or 
momenta 
[movimenti 
e 
lor 
velocità 
o 
impeti] 
whether 
uniform 
or 
naturally 
accelerated, 
one 
cannot 
speak 
definitely 
until 
he 
has 
established 
a 
measure 
for 
such 
velocities 
and 
also 
for 
time. 
Asfor 
time 
we 
have 
the 
already 
widelyadopted 
hours,firstminutes 
and 
second 
minutes. 
So 
forvelocities, 
just 
as 
forintervals 
of 
time, 
thereisneed 
of 
a 
common 
standard 
which 
shall 
be 
understood 
and 
accepted 
by 
everyone, 
and 
which 
shall 
be 
the 
same 
for 
all. 
As 
has 
already 
been 
stated, 
the 
Author 
considers 
the 
velocity 
of 
a 
freely 
falling 
body 
adapted 
to 
this 
purpose, 
since 
this 
velocity 
increases 
according 
to 
the 
same 
law 
in 
all 
parts 
of 
the 
world; 
thus 
for 
instance 
the 
speed 
acquired 
by 
a 
leaden 
ball 
of 
a 
pound 
weight 
starting 
from 
rest 
and 
falling 
vertically 
through 
the 
height 
of, 
say, 
a 
spear’s 
length 
is 
the 
same 
in 
all 
places; 
it 
is 
therefore 
excellently 
adapted 
for 
representingthe 
momentum[impeto] 
acquiredinthecase 
ofnaturalfall. 


It 
still 
remains 
for 
us 
to 
discover 
a 
method 
of 
measuring 
momentum 
in 
the 
case 
of 
uniform 
motion 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
all 
who 
discuss 
the 
subject 
will 
form 
the 
same 
conception 
of 
its 
size 
and 
velocity 
[grandezza 
e 
velocità]. 
This 
will 
prevent 
one 
person 
from 
imagining 
it 
larger, 
another 
smaller, 
than 
it 
really 
is; 
so 
that 
in 
the 
composition 
of 
a 
given 
uniform 
motion 
with 
one 
which 
is 
accelerated 
different 
men 
may 
not 
obtain 
different 
values 
for 
the 
resultant. 
In 
order 
to 
determine 
and 
represent 
such 
a 
momentum 
and 
particular 
speed 
[impeto 
e 
velocità 
particolare] 
our 
Author 
has 
found 
no 
better 
method 
than 
to 
use 
the 
momentum 
acquired 
by 
a 
body 
in 
naturally 
accelerated 
motion. 
The 
speed 
of 
a 
body 
which 
has 
in 
this 
manner 
acquired 
any 
momentum 
whatever 
will, 
when 
converted 
into 
uniform 
motion, 
retain 
precisely 
such 
a 
speed 
as, 
during 
a 
time-interval 
equal 
to 
that 
of 
the 
fall, 
will 
carry 
the 
body 
through 
a 
distance 
equal 
to 
twice 
that 
of 
the 
fall. 
But 
since 
this 
matter 
is 
one 
which 
is 
fundamental 
in 
our 
discussionitiswell 
thatwemake 
it 
perfectlyclearbymeansofsomeparticularexample. 


Let 
us 
consider 
the 
speed 
and 
momentum 
acquired 
by 
a 
body 
falling 
through 
the 
height, 
say, 
of 
a 
spear 
[picca] 
as 
a 
standard 
which 
we 
may 
use 
in 
the 
measurement 
of 
other 
speeds 
and 
momenta 
as 
occasion 
demands; 
assume 



forinstance 
thatthetimeof 
sucha 
fallisfourseconds[minuti 
secondi 
d’ora]; 
now 
in 
order 
to 
measure 
the 
speed 
acquired 
from 
a 
fall 
through 
any 
other 
height, 
whether 
greater 
or 
less, 
one 
must 
not 
conclude 
that 
these 
speeds 
bear 
to 
one 
another 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
the 
heights 
of 
fall; 
for 
instance, 
it 
is 
not 
true 
that 
a 
fall 
through 
four 
times 
a 
given 
height 
confers 
a 
speed 
four 
times 
as 
great 
as 
that 
acquired 
by 
descent 
through 
the 
given 
height; 
because 
the 
speed 
of 
a 
naturally 
accelerated 
motion 
does 
not 
vary 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
time. 
As 
has 
been 
shown 
above, 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
spaces 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
square 
of 
the 
ratioof 
thetimes. 


If, 
then, 
as 
is 
often 
done 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
brevity, 
we 
take 
the 
same 
limited 
straight 
line 
as 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
speed, 
and 
of 
the 
time, 
and 
also 
of 
the 
space 
traversed 
during 
that 
time, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
duration 
of 
fall 
and 
the 
speed 
acquired 
by 
the 
same 
body 
in 
passing 
over 
any 
other 
distance, 
is 
not 
represented 
by 
this 
second 
distance, 
but 
by 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
the 
two 
distances. 
This 
I 
can 
better 
illustrate 
by 
an 
example. 
In 
the 
vertical 
line 
ac, 
lay 
off 
the 
portion 
ab 
to 
represent 
the 
distance 
traversed 
by 
a 
body 
falling 
freely 
with 
accelerated 
motion: 
the 
time 
of 
fall 
may 
be 
represented 
by 
any 
limited 
straight 
line, 
but 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
brevity, 
we 
shall 
represent 
it 
by 
the 
same 
length 
ab; 
this 
length 
may 
also 
be 
employed 
as 
a 
measure 
of 
the 
momentum 
and 
speed 
acquired 
during 
the 
motion; 
in 
short, 
let 
ab 
be 
a 
measure 
ofthevariousphysical 
quantities 
whichenterthisdiscussion. 



Having 
agreed 
arbitrarily 
upon 
ab 
as 
a 
measure 
of 
these 
three 
different 
quantities, 
namely, 
space, 
time, 
and 
momentum, 
our 
next 
task 
is 
to 
find 
the 
time 
required 
for 
fall 
through 
a 
given 
vertical 
distance 
ac, 
also 
the 
momentum 
acquired 
at 
the 
terminal 
point 
c, 
both 
of 
which 
are 
to 
be 
expressed 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
time 
and 
momentum 
represented 
by 
ab. 
These 
two 
required 
quantities 
are 
obtained 
by 
laying 
off 
ad, 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
ab 
and 
ac; 
in 
other 
words, 
the 
time 
of 
fall 
from 
a 
to 
c 
is 
represented 
by 
ad 
on 
the 
same 
scale 
on 
which 
we 
agreed 
that 
the 
time 
of 
fall 
from 
a 
to 
b 
should 
be 
represented 
by 
ab. 
In 
like 
manner 
we 
may 
say 
that 
the 
momentum 
[impeto 
o 
grado 
di 
velocità] 
acquired 
at 
c 
is 
related 
to 
that 
acquired 
at 
b, 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
that 
the 
line 
ad 
is 
related 
to 
ab, 
since 
the 
velocity 
varies 
directly 
as 
the 
time, 
a 
conclusion, 
which 
although 
employed 
as 
a 
postulate 
in 
PropositionIII, 
ishere 
amplified 
bythe 
Author. 



This 
point 
being 
clear 
and 
well-established 
we 
pass 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
momentum 
[impeto] 
in 
the 
case 
of 
two 
compound 
motions, 
one 
of 
which 
is 
compounded 
of 
a 
uniform 
horizontal 
and 
a 
uniform 
vertical 
motion, 
while 
the 
other 
is 
compounded 
of 
a 
uniform 
horizontal 
and 
a 
naturally 
accelerated 
vertical 
motion. 
If 
both 
components 
are 
uniform, 
and 
one 
at 
right 
angles 
to 
the 
other, 
we 
have 
already 
seen 
that 
the 
square 
of 
the 
resultant 
is 
obtained 
by 
adding 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
components 
[p. 
257] 
as 
will 
be 
clear 
from 
the 
followingillustration. 


Let 
us 
imagine 
a 
body 
to 
move 
along 
the 
vertical 
ab 
with 
a 
uniform 
momentum 
[impeto] 
of 
3, 
and 
on 
reaching 
b 
to 
move 
toward 
c 
with 
a 
momentum[velocità 
ed 
impeto] 
of 
4, 
so 
that 
during 
the 
same 
time-interval 
it 
will 
traverse 
3 
cubits 
along 
the 
vertical 
and 
4 
along 
the 
horizontal. 
But 
a 
particle 
which 
moves 
with 
the 
resultant 
velocity 
[velocità] 
will, 
in 
the 
same 
time, 
traverse 
the 
diagonal 
ac, 
whose 
length 
is 
not 
7 
cubits 
— 
the 
sum 
of 
ab 


(3) 
and 
bc 
(4) 
— 
but 
5, 
which 
is 
in 
potenza 
equal 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
3 
and 
4, 
that 
is, 
the 
squares 
of 
3 
and 
4 
when 
added 
make 
25, 
which 
is 
the 
square 
of 
ac, 
and 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
squares 
of 
ab 
and 
bc. 
Hence 
ac 
is 
represented 
by 
theside—orwemaysaytheroot—ofasquarewhoseareais25,namely5.
As 
a 
fixed 
and 
certain 
rule 
for 
obtaining 
the 
momentum 
which 
results 
from 
two 
uniform 
momenta, 
one 
vertical, 
the 
other 
horizontal, 
we 
have 
therefore 
the 
following: 
take 
the 
square 
of 
each, 
add 
these 
together, 
and 



extract 
the 
square 
root 
of 
the 
sum, 
which 
will 
be 
the 
momentum 
resulting 
from 
the 
two. 
Thus, 
in 
the 
above 
example, 
the 
body 
which 
in 
virtue 
of 
its 
vertical 
motion 
would 
strike 
the 
horizontal 
plane 
with 
a 
momentum 
[forza]of 
3, 
would 
owing 
to 
its 
horizontal 
motion 
alone 
strike 
at 
c 
with 
a 
momentum 
of 
4; 
but 
if 
the 
body 
strikes 
with 
a 
momentum 
which 
is 
the 
resultant 
of 
these 
two, 
its 
blow 
will 
be 
that 
of 
a 
body 
moving 
with 
a 
momentum 
[velocità 
e 
forza] 
of 
5; 
and 
such 
a 
blow 
will 
be 
the 
same 
at 
all 
points 
of 
the 
diagonal 
ac, 
sinceitscomponentsarealwaysthesameandneverincreaseor 
diminish. 


Let 
us 
now 
pass 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
a 
uniform 
horizontal 
motion 
compounded 
with 
the 
vertical 
motion 
of 
a 
freely 
falling 
body 
starting 
from 
rest. 
It 
is 
at 
once 
clear 
that 
the 
diagonal 
which 
represents 
the 
motion 
compoundedof 
these 
two 
is 
not 
astraight 
line, 
but, 
as 
has 
been 
demonstrated, 
a 
semi-parabola, 
in 
which 
the 
momentum 
[impeto] 
is 
always 
increasing 
because 
the 
speed 
[velocità] 
of 
the 
vertical 
component 
is 
always 
increasing. 
Wherefore, 
to 
determine 
the 
momentum 
[impeto] 
at 
any 
given 
point 
in 
the 
parabolic 
diagonal, 
it 
is 
necessary 
first 
to 
fix 
upon 
the 
uniform 
horizontal 
momentum 
[impeto] 
and 
then, 
treating 
the 
body 
as 
one 
falling 
freely, 
to 
find 
the 
vertical 
momentum 
at 
the 
given 
point; 
this 
latter 
can 
be 
determined 
only 
by 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
duration 
of 
fall, 
a 
consideration 
which 
does 
not 
enter 
into 
the 
composition 
of 
two 
uniform 
motions 
where 
the 
velocities 
and 
momenta 
are 
always 
the 
same; 
but 
here 
where 
one 
of 
the 
component 
motions 
has 
an 
initial 
value 
of 
zero 
and 
increases 
its 
speed 
[velocità] 
in 
direct 
proportion 
to 
the 
time, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
time 
must 
determine 
the 
speed 
[velocità] 
at 
the 
assigned 
point. 
It 
only 
remains 
to 
obtain 
the 
momentum 
resulting 
from 
these 
two 
components 
(as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
uniform 
motions) 
by 
placing 
the 
square 
of 
the 
resultant 
equal 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
two 
components.

On 
the 
vertical 
ac 
lay 
off 
any 
portion 
ab 
which 
we 
shall 
employ 
as 
a 
measure 
of 
the 
space 
traversed 
by 
a 
body 
falling 
freely 
along 
the 
perpendicular, 
likewise 
as 
a 
measure 
of 
the 
time 
and 
also 
of 
the 
speed 
[grado 
di 
velocità] 
or, 
we 
may 
say, 
of 
the 
momenta 
[impeti]. 
It 
is 
at 
once 
clear 
that 
if 
the 
momentum 
of 
a 
body 
at 
b, 
after 
having 
fallen 
from 
rest 
at 
a, 
be 
diverted 
along 
the 
horizontal 
direction 
bd, 
with 
uniform 
motion, 
its 
speed 
will 
be 
such 
that, 
during 
the 
time-interval 
ab, 
it 
will 
traverse 
a 
distance 
which 
is 
represented 
by 
the 
line 
bd 
and 
which 
is 
twice 
as 
great 
as 
ab. 
Now 
choose 
a 
point 
c, 
suchthat 
bc 
shall 
be 
equal 
to 
ab, 
andthrough 
c 
draw 
the 
line 
ce 
equal 



and 
parallel 
to 
bd; 
through 
the 
points 
b 
and 
e 
draw 
the 
parabola 
bei. 
And 
since, 
during 
the 
time-interval 
ab, 
the 
horizontal 
distance 
bd 
or 
ce, 
double 
the 
length 
ab, 
is 
traversed 
with 
the 
momentum 
ab, 
and 
since 
during 
an 
equal 
time-interval 
the 
vertical 
distance 
bc 
is 
traversed, 
the 
body 
acquiring 
at 
c 
a 
momentum 
represented 
by 
the 
same 
horizontal, 
bd, 
it 
follows 
that 
during 
the 
time 
ab 
the 
body 
will 
pass 
from 
b 
to 
e 
along 
the 
parabola 
be, 
and 
will 
reach 
e 
with 
a 
momentum 
compounded 
of 
two 
momenta 
each 
equal 
to 
ab. 
And 
since 
one 
of 
these 
is 
horizontal 
and 
the 
other 
vertical, 
the 
square 
of 
the 
resultant 
momentum 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
squares 
of 
these 
two 
components, 
i. 
e., 


equaltotwiceeitheroneofthem.
Therefore, 
if 
we 
lay 
off 
the 
distance 
bf, 
equal 
to 
ba, 
and 
draw 
the 
diagonal 
af, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
momentum 
[impeto 
e 
percossa] 
at 
e 
will 
exceed 
that 
of 
a 
body 
at 
b 
after 
having 
fallen 
from 
a, 
or 
what 
is 
the 
same 
thing, 
will 
exceed 



the 
horizontal 
momentum 
[percossa 
dell’impeto] 
along 
bd, 
in 
the 
ratio 
of 
af 
to 
ab. 


Suppose 
now 
we 
choose 
for 
the 
height 
of 
fall 
a 
distance 
bo 
which 
is 
not 
equal 
to 
but 
greater 
than 
ab, 
and 
suppose 
that 
bg 
represents 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
ba 
and 
bo; 
then, 
still 
retaining 
ba 
as 
a 
measure 
of 
the 
distance 
fallen 
through, 
from 
rest 
at 
a, 
to 
b, 
also 
as 
a 
measure 
of 
the 
time 
and 
of 
the 
momentum 
which 
the 
falling 
body 
acquires 
at 
b, 
it 
follows 
that 
bg 
will 
be 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
time 
and 
also 
of 
the 
momentum 
which 
the 
body 
acquires 
in 
falling 
from 
b 
to 
o. 
Likewise 
just 
as 
the 
momentum 
ab 
during 
the 
time 
ab 
carried 
the 
body 
a 
distance 
along 
the 
horizontal 
equal 
to 
twice 
ab, 
so 
now, 
during 
the 
time-interval 
bg, 
the 
body 
will 
be 
carried 
in 
a 
horizontal 
direction 
through 
a 
distance 
which 
is 
greater 
in 
the 
ratio 
of 
bg 
to 
ba. 
Lay 
off 
lb 
equal 
to 
bg 
and 
draw 
the 
diagonal 
al, 
from 
which 
we 
have 
a 
quantity 
compounded 
of 
two 
velocities 
[impeti] 
one 
horizontal, 
the 
other 
vertical; 
these 
determine 
the 
parabola. 
The 
horizontal 
and 
uniform 
velocity 
is 
that 
acquiredat 
b 
in 
falling 
from 
a; 
the 
other 
is 
that 
acquired 
at 
o, 
or, 
we 
may 
say, 
at 
i, 
by 
a 
body 
falling 
through 
the 
distance 
bo, 
during 
a 
time 
measured 
by 
the 
line 
bg, 
which 
line 
bg 
also 
represents 
the 
momentum 
of 
the 
body. 
And 
in 
like 
manner 
we 
may, 
by 
taking 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
the 
two 
heights, 
determine 
the 
momentum 
[impeto] 
at 
the 
extreme 
end 
of 
the 
parabola 
where 
the 
height 
is 
less 
than 
the 
sublimity 
ab; 
this 
mean 
proportional 
is 
to 
be 
drawn 
along 
the 
horizontal 
in 
place 
of 
bf, 
and 
also 
another 
diagonal 
in 
place 
of 
af, 
which 
diagonal 
will 
represent 
the 
momentum 
at 
the 
extreme 
end 
of 
the 
parabola. 


To 
what 
has 
hitherto 
been 
said 
concerning 
the 
momenta, 
blows 
or 
shocks 
of 
projectiles, 
we 
must 
add 
another 
very 
important 
consideration; 
to 
determine 
the 
force 
and 
energy 
of 
the 
shock 
[forza 
ed 
energia 
della 
percossa] 
it 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
consider 
only 
the 
speed 
of 
the 
projectiles, 
but 
we 
must 
also 
take 
into 
account 
the 
nature 
and 
condition 
of 
the 
target 
which, 
in 
no 
small 
degree, 
determines 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
blow. 
First 
of 
all 
it 
is 
well 
known 
that 
the 
target 
suffers 
violence 
from 
the 
speed 
[velocità] 
of 
the 
projectile 
in 
proportion 
as 
it 
partly 
or 
entirely 
stops 
the 
motion; 
because 
if 
the 
blow 
falls 
upon 
an 
object 
which 
yields 
to 
the 
impulse 
[velocità 
del 
percuziente] 
without 
resistance 
such 
a 
blow 
will 
be 
of 
no 
effect; 
likewise 
when 
one 
attacks 
his 
enemy 
with 
a 
spear 
and 
overtakes 
him 
at 
an 
instant 
when 
he 
is 
fleeing 
with 
equal 
speed 
there 
will 
be 
no 
blow 
but

then 
the 
blow 
will 
not 
have 
its 
full 
effect, 
but 
the 
damage 
will 
be 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
excess 
of 
the 
speed 
of 
the 
projectile 
over 
that 
of 
the 
receding 
body; 
thus, 
for 
example, 
if 
the 
shot 
reaches 
the 
target 
with 
a 
speed 
of 
10 
while 
the 
latter 
recedes 
with 
a 
speed 
of 
4, 
the 
momentum 
and 
shock 
[impeto 
e 
percossa] 
will 
be 
represented 
by 
6. 
Finally 
the 
blow 
will 
be 
a 
maximum, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
the 
projectile 
is 
concerned, 
when 
the 
target 
does 
not 
recede 
at 
all 
but 
if 
possible 
completely 
resists 
and 
stops 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
projectile. 
I 
have 
said 
in 
so 
far 
as 
the 
projectile 
is 
concerned 
because 
if 
the 
target 
should 
approach 
the 
projectile 
the 
shock 
of 
collision 
[colpo 
e 
l’incontro] 
would 
be 
greater 
in 
proportion 
as 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
two 
speeds 
is 
greaterthanthatoftheprojectilealone. 


Moreover 
it 
is 
to 
be 
observed 
that 
the 
amount 
of 
yielding 
in 
the 
target 
depends 
not 
only 
upon 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
material, 
as 
regards 
hardness, 
whether 
it 
be 
of 
iron, 
lead, 
wool, 
etc., 
but 
also 
upon 
its 
position. 
If 
the 
position 
is 
such 
that 
the 
shot 
strikes 
it 
at 
right 
angles, 
the 
momentum 
imparted 
by 
the 
blow 
[impeto 
del 
colpo] 
will 
be 
a 
maximum; 
but 
if 
the 
motion 
be 
oblique, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
slanting, 
the 
blow 
will 
be 
weaker; 
and 
more 
and 
more 
so 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
obliquity; 
for, 
no 
matter 
how 
hard 
the 
material 
of 
the 
target 
thus 
situated, 
the 
entire 
momentum 
[impeto 
e 
moto] 
of 
the 
shot 
will 
not 
be 
spent 
and 
stopped; 
the 
projectile 
will 
slide 
by 
and 
will, 
to 
someextent,continueits 
motionalong 
the 
surface 
oftheopposingbody. 


All 
that 
has 
been 
said 
above 
concerning 
the 
amount 
of 
momentum 
in 
the 
projectile 
at 
the 
extremity 
of 
the 
parabola 
must 
be 
understood 
to 
refer 
to 
a 
blow 
received 
on 
a 
line 
at 
right 
angles 
to 
this 
parabola 
or 
along 
the 
tangent 
to 
the 
parabola 
at 
the 
given 
point; 
for, 
even 
though 
the 
motion 
has 
two 
components, 
one 
horizontal, 
the 
other 
vertical, 
neither 
will 
the

Sagr. 
Your 
having 
mentioned 
these 
blows 
and 
shocks 
recalls 
to 
my 
mind 
a 
problem, 
or 
rather 
a 
question, 
in 
mechanics 
of 
which 
no 
author 
has 
given 
a 
solution 
or 
said 
anything 
which 
diminishes 
my 
astonishment 
or 
even 
partly 
relieves 
my 
mind. 


My 
difficulty 
and 
surprise 
consist 
in 
not 
being 
able 
to 
see 
whence 
and 
upon 
what 
principle 
is 
derived 
the 
energy 
and 
immense 
force 
[energia 
e 
forza 
immensa] 
which 
makes 
its 
appearance 
in 
a 
blow; 
for 
instance 
we 
see 
the 



simple 
blow 
of 
a 
hammer, 
weighing 
not 
more 
than 
8 
or 
10 
lbs., 
overcoming 
resistances 
which, 
without 
a 
blow, 
would 
not 
yield 
to 
the 
weight 
of 
a 
body 
producing 
impetus 
by 
pressure 
alone, 
even 
though 
that 
body 
weighed 
many 
hundreds 
of 
pounds. 
I 
would 
like 
to 
discover 
a 
method 
of 
measuring 
the 
force 
[forza] 
of 
such 
a 
percussion. 
I 
can 
hardly 
think 
it 
infinite, 
but 
incline 
rather 
to 
the 
view 
that 
it 
has 
its 
limit 
and 
can 
be 
counterbalanced 
and 
measured 
by 
other 
forces, 
such 
as 
weights, 
or 
by 
levers 
or 
screws 
or 
other 
mechanical 
instruments 
which 
are 
used 
to 
multiply 
forces 
in 
a 
manner 
which 
I 
satisfactorilyunderstand. 


Salv. 
You 
are 
not 
alone 
in 
your 
surprise 
at 
this 
effect 
or 
in 
obscurity 
as 
to 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
remarkable 
property. 
I 
studied 
this 
matter 
myself 
for 
a 
while 
in 
vain; 
but 
my 
confusion 
merely 
increased 
until 
finally 
meeting 
our 
Academician 
I 
received 
from 
him 
great 
consolation. 
First 
he 
told 
me 
that 
he 
also 
had 
for 
a 
long 
time 
been 
groping 
in 
the 
dark; 
but 
later 
he 
said 
that, 
after 
having 
spent 
some 
thousands 
of 
hours 
in 
speculating 
and 
contemplating 
thereon, 
he 
had 
arrived 
at 
some 
notions 
which 
are 
far 
removed 
from 
our 
earlier 
ideas 
and 
which 
are 
remarkable 
for 
their 
novelty. 
And 
since 
now 
I 
know 
that 
you 
would 
gladly 
hear 
what 
these 
novel 
ideas 
are 
I 
shall 
not 
wait 
for 
you 
to 
ask 
but 
promise 
that, 
as 
soon 
as 
our 
discussion 
of 
projectiles 
is 
completed, 
I 
will 
explain 
all 
these 
fantasies, 
or 
if 
you 
please, 
vagaries, 
as 
far 
as 
I 
can 
recall 
them 
from 
the 
words 
of 
our 
Academician. 
In 
the 
meantime 
we 
proceedwiththepropositionsoftheauthor. 


Proposition 
V,Problem 


Having 
given 
a 
parabola, 
find 
the 
point, 
in 
its 
axis 
extended 
upwards, 
from 
which 
aparticlemustfallinorderto

Corollary 


Hence 
it 
follows 
that 
half 
the 
base, 
or 
amplitude, 
of 
the 
semi-parabola 
(which 
is 
one-quarter 
of 
the 
entire 
amplitude) 
is 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
its 
altitude 
and 
the 
sublimity 
from 
which 
a 
falling 
body 
will 
describe 
this 
same 
parabola. 


PropositionVI,Problem 


Given 
the 
sublimity 
andthealtitudeof 
aparabola,tofinditsamplitude. 


Let 
the 
line 
ac, 
in 
which 
lie 
the 
given 
altitude 
cb 
and 
sublimity 
ab, 
be 
perpendicular 
to 
the 
horizontal 
line 
cd. 
The 
problem 
is 
to 
find 
the 
amplitude, 
along 
the 
horizontal 
cd, 
of 
the 
semi-parabola 
which 
is 
described 
with 
the 
sublimity 
ba 
and 
altitude 
bc. 
Lay 
off 
cd 
equal 
to 
twice 
the 
mean 
proportional 



between 
cb 
and 
ba. 
Then 
cd 
will 
be 
the 
amplitude 
sought, 
as 
is 
evident 
from 
theprecedingproposition. 



Theoremposition. 
Pro 
VII 


If 
projectiles 
describe 
semi-parabolas 
of 
the 
same 
amplitude, 
the 
momentum 
required 
to 
describe 
that 
one 
whose 
amplitude 
is 
double 
its 
altitude 
is 
less 
thanthatrequiredforanyother. 


Let 
gm 
be 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
ab 
and 
gl; 
then 
gm 
will 
[Prop. 
IV] 
represent 
the 
time 
and 
momentum 
acquired 
at 
g 
by 
a 
fall 
from 
l; 
for 
ab 
has 
been 
assumed 
as 
a 
measure 
of 
both 
time 
and 
momentum. 
Again 
let 
gn 
be 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
bc 
and 
cg; 
it 
will 
then 
represent 
the 
time 
and 
momentum 
which 
the 
body 
acquires 
at 
c 
in 
falling 
from 
g. 
If 
now 
we 
join 
m 
and 
n, 
this 
line 
mn 
will 
represent 
the 
momentum 
at 
d 
of 
the 
projectile 



traversingtheparabola 
dg; 
which 
momentum 
is, 
I 
say,greater 
than 
thatof 
the 
projectile 
travelling 
along 
the 
parabola 
bd 
whose 
measure 
was 
given 
by 
ae. 
For 
since 
gn 
has 
been 
taken 
as 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
bc 
and 
gc; 
and 
since 
bc 
is 
equal 
to 
be 
and 
also 
to 
kg 
(each 
of 
them 
being 
the 
half 
of 
dc) 
it 
follows 
that 
cg:gn=gn:gk, 
and 
as 
cg 
or 
(hg) 
is 
to 
gk 
so 
is 
to 
to: 
but 
by 
construction 
hg:gk=gk:gl. 
Hence 
:=gk:gl. 
But 
gk:gl=:, 
since 
gm 
is 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
kg 
and 
gl. 
Therefore 
the 
three 
squares 
ng, 
kg, 
mg 
form 
a 
continued 
proportion, 
:=: 
And 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
two 
extremes 
which 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
square 
of 
mn 
is 
greater 
than 
twice 
the 
square 
of 
gk; 
but 
the 
square 
of 
ae 
is 
double 
the 
square 
of 
gk. 
Hence 
the 
square 
of 
mn 
is 
greater 
than 
the 
square 
of 
ae 
and 
the 
length 
mn 
is 
greater 
than 
the 
length 
ae.

Corollary 


The 
force 
of 
rigid 
demonstrations 
such 
as 
occur 
only 
in 
mathematics 
fills 
me 
with 
wonder 
and 
delight. 
From 
accounts 
given 
by 
gunners, 
I 
was 
already 
aware 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
the 
use 
of 
cannon 
and 
mortars, 
the 
maximum 
range, 
that 
is 
the 
one 
in 
which 
the 
shot 
goes 
farthest, 
is 
obtained 
when 
the 
elevation 
is 
45° 
or, 
as 
they 
say, 
at 
the 
sixth 
point 
of 
the 
quadrant; 
but 
to 
understand 
why 
this 
happens 
far 
outweighs 
the 
mere 
information 
obtained 
by 
the 
testimonyofothersoreven 
byrepeatedexperiment. 


Salv. 
What 
you 
say 
is 
very 
true. 
The 
knowledge 
of 
a 
single 
fact 
acquired 
through 
a 
discovery 
of 
its 
causes 
prepares 
the 
mind 
to 
understand 
and 
ascertain 
other 
facts 
without 
need 
of 
recourse 
to 
experiment, 
precisely 
as 
in 
the 
present 
case, 
where 
by 
argumentation 
alone 
the 
Author 
proves 
with 
certainty 
that 
the 
maximum 
range 
occurs 
when 
the 
elevation 
is 
45°. 
He 
thus 
demonstrates 
what 
has 
perhaps 
never 
been 
observed 
in 
experience, 
namely, 
that 
of 
other 
shots 
those 
which 
exceed 
or 
fall 
short 
of 
45° 
by 
equal 
amounts 
have 
equal 
ranges; 
so 
that 
if 
the 
balls 
have 
been 
fired 
one 
at 
an 
elevation 
of 
7 
points, 
the 
other 
at 
5, 
they 
will 
strike 
the 
level 
at 
the 
same 
distance: 
the 
same 
is 
true 
if 
the 
shots 
are 
fired 
at 
8 
and 
at 
4 
points, 
at 
9 
and 
at 
3, 
etc. 
Now 
let 
us 
hearthedemonstrationof 
this. 


Theorem. 
Proposition 
VIII 



The 
amplitudes 
of 
two 
parabolas 
described 
by 
projectiles 
fired 
with 
the 
same 
speed, 
but 
at 
angles 
of 
elevation 
which 
exceed 
and 
fall 
short 
of 
45° 
by 
equal 
amounts,areequal 
toeachother. 


In 
the 
triangle 
mcb 
let 
the 
horizontal 
side 
bc 
and 
the 
vertical 
cm, 
which 
form 
a 
right 
angle 
at 
c, 
be 
equal 
to 
each 
other; 
then 
the 
angle 
mbc 
will 
be 
a 
semi-right 
angle; 
let 
the 
line 
cm 
be 
prolonged 
to 
d, 
such 
a 
point 
that 
the 
two 
angles 
at 
b, 
namely 
mbe 
and 
mbd, 
one 
above 
and 
the 
other 
below 
the 
diagonal 
mb, 
shall 
be 
equal. 
It 
is 
now 
to 
be 
proved 
that 
in 
the 
case 
of 
two 
parabolas 
described 
by 
two 
projectiles 
fired 
from 
b 
with 
the 
same 
speed, 
one 
at 
the 
angle 
of 
ebc, 
the 
other 
at 
the 
angle 
of 
dbc, 
their 
amplitudes 
will 
be 
equal. 
Now 
since 
the 
external 
angle 
bmc 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
internal 
angles 
mdb 
and 
dbm 
we 
may 
also 
equate 
to 
them 
the 
angle 
mbc; 
but 
if 
we 
replace 
the 
angle 
dbm 
by 
mbe, 
then 
this 
same 
angle 
mbc 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
two 
mbe 
and 
bdc: 
and 
if 
we 
subtract 
from 
each 
side 
of 
this 
equation 
the 
angle 
mbe, 
we 
have 
the 
remainder 
bdc 
equal 
to 
the 
remainder 
ebc. 
Hence 
the 
two 
triangles 
dcb 
and 
bce 
are 
similar. 
Bisect 
the 
straight 
lines 
dc 
and 
ec 
in 
the 
points 
h 
and 
f: 
and 
draw 
the 
lines 
hi 
and 
fg 
parallel 
to 
the 
horizontal 
cb, 
and 
choose 
l 
such 
that 
dh:hi=ih:hl. 
Then 
the 
triangle 
ihl 
will 
be 
similar 
to 
ihd, 
and 
also 
to 
the 
triangle 
egf; 
and 
since 
ih 
and 
gf 
are 
equal, 
each 
being 
half 
of 
bc, 
it 
follows 
that 
hl 
is 
equal 
to 
fe 
and 
also 
to 
fc; 
and 
if 
we 
add 
to 
each 
of 
these 
the 
common 
partfh, 
itwillbeseenthatchis 
equaltofl. 



Let 
us 
now 
imagine 
a 
parabola 
described 
through 
the 
points 
h 
and 
b 
whose 
altitude 
is 
hc 
and 
sublimity 
hl. 
Its 
amplitude 
will 
be 
cb 
which 
is 
double 
the 
length 
hi 
since 
hi 
is 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
dh 
(or 
ch) 
and 
hl. 
The 
line 
db 
is 
tangent 
to 
the 
parabola 
at 
b, 
since 
ch 
is 
equal 
to 
hd. 
If 
again 
we 
imagine 
a 
parabola 
described 
through 
the 
points 
f 
and 
b, 
with 
a 
sublimity 
fl 
and 
altitude 
fc, 
of 
which 
the 
mean 
proportional 
is 
fg, 
or 
one-half 
of 
cb, 
then, 
as 
before, 
will 
cb 
be 
the 
amplitude 
and 
the 
line 
eb 
a 
tangent 
at 
b; 
for 
ef 
and 
fc 
areequal. 


The 
amplitudes 
of 
two 
parabolas 
are 
equal 
when 
their 
altitudes 
and 
sublimitiesareinversely 
proportional.

Let 
the 
line 
ab 
be 
cut 
at 
c. 
Then 
I 
say 
that 
the 
square 
of 
the

between

plus 
the 
square 
of 
the

proportional 
between

and

is 
equal 
to 
the 
square 
of 
the 
whole

This 
is 
evident 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
describe 
a

upon 
the 
entire

ab, 
erect 
a 
perpendicular

at

is

In 
modern 
mechanics 
this 
well-known 
theorem 
assumes 
the 
following 
form: 
The 
speed 
of 
a 
projectile 
at 
any 
point 
is 
that 
produced 
by 
a 
fall 
from 
the 
directrix. 
[Trans.] 



And 
since 
dc 
has 
been 
cut 
at 
some 
point 
a 
and 
since 
cf 
and 
ce 
are 
mean 
proportionals 
between 
the 
whole 
of 
cd 
and 
its 
parts, 
da 
and 
ac, 
it 
follows, 
from 
the 
preceding 
lemma, 
that 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
squares 
of 
these 
mean 
proportionals 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
square 
of 
the 
whole: 
but 
the 
square 
of 
ef 
is 
also 
equal 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
these 
same 
squares; 
whence 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
line 
ef 
is 
equalto 
dc. 


Accordingly 
the 
momentum 
acquired 
at 
c 
by 
a

in 
falling 
from

is 
thesameasthatacquiredat

Hence 
it

the 
case 
of 
all 
parabolas 
where 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
sublimity

the

at

is 
a

Problem. 
Proposition 
XI 


Given 
the 
amplitude 
and 
the 
speed 
[impetus] 
at 
the 
terminal 
point 
of 
a 
semi-
parabola, 
tofind 
itsaltitude. 


Let 
the 
given 
speed 
be 
represented 
by 
the 
vertical 
line 
ab, 
and 
the 
amplitude 
by 
the 
horizontal 
line 
bc; 
it 
is 
required 
to 
find 
the 
sublimity 
of 
the 
semi-parabola 
whose 
terminal 
speed 
is 
ab 
and 
amplitude 
bc. 
From 
what 
precedes 
[Cor. 
Prop. 
V] 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
half 
the 
amplitude 
bc 
is 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
the 
altitude 
and 
sublimity 
of 
the 
parabola 
of 
which 
the 
terminal 
speed 
is 
equal, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
preceding 
proposition, 
to 
the 
speed 
acquired 
by 
a 
body 
in 
falling 
from 
rest 
at 
a 
through 
the 
distance 
ab. 
Therefore 
the 
line 
ba 
must 
be 
cut 
at 
a 
point 
such 
that 
the 
rectangle 
formed 
by 
its 
two 
parts 
will 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
square 
of 
half 
bc, 
namely 
bd. 
Necessarily, 
therefore, 
bd 
must 
not 
exceed 
the 
half 
of 
ba; 
for 
of 
all 
the 
rectangles 
formed 
by 
parts 
of 
a 
straight 
line 
the 
one 
of 
greatest 
area 
is 
obtained 
when 
the 
line 
is 
divided 
into 
two 
equal 
parts. 
Let 
e 
be 
the 
middle 
point 
of 
the 
line 
ab; 
and 
nowif 
bd 
be 
equal 
to 
be 
the 
problem 
is 
solved; 
for 
be 
will 
be 
the 
altitude 
and 
ea 
the 
sublimity 
of 
the 
parabola. 
(Incidentally 
we 
may 
observe 
a 
consequence 
already 
demonstrated, 
namely: 
of 
all 
parabolas 
described 
with 
any 
given 
terminal 
speed 
that 
for 
which 
the 
elevation 
is 
45° 
will 
have 
the 
maximum 
amplitude.) 



But 
suppose 
that 
bd 
is 
less 
than 
half 
of 
ba 
which 
is 
to 
be 
divided 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
the 
rectangle 
upon 
its 
parts 
may 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
square 
of 
bd. 
Upon 
ea 
as 
diameter 
describe 
a 
semicircle 
efa, 
in 
which 
draw 
the 
chord 
af, 
equal 
to 
bd: 
join 
fe 
and 
lay 
off 
the 
distance 
eg 
equal 
to 
fe. 
Then 
the 
rectangle 
bg.ga 
plus 
the 
square 
of 
eg 
will 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
square 
of 
ea, 
and 
hence 
also 
to 
the 
sum 
ofthesquaresof 
af 
and 
fe. 
If 
now 
we 
subtract 
the 
equal 
squares 
of 
fe 
and 
ge 
there 
remains 
the 
rectangle 
bg.ga 
equal 
to 
the 
square 
of 
af, 
that 
is, 
of 
bd, 
a 
line 
which 
is 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
bg 
and 
ga; 
from 
which 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
the 
semi-parabola 
whose 
amplitude 
is 
bc 
and 
whose 
terminal 
speed[impetus]is 
represented 
by 
ba 
hasanaltitude 
bg 
andasublimity 
ga. 


If 
however 
we 
lay 
off 
bi 
equal 
to 
ga, 
then 
bi 
will 
be 
the 
altitude 
of 
the 
semi-parabola 
ic, 
and 
ia 
will 
be 
its 
sublimity. 
From 
the 
preceding 
demonstrationweareableto 
solve 
the 
following 
problem. 



Problem. 
PropositionXII 


To 
compute 
and 
tabulate 
the 
amplitudes 
of 
all 
semi-parabolas 
which 
are 
describedbyprojectilesfiredwiththesameinitialspeed 
[impetus]. 


From 
the 
foregoing 
it 
follows 
that, 
whenever 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
altitude 
and 
sublimity 
is 
a 
constant 
vertical 
height 
for 
any 
set 
of 
parabolas, 
these 
parabolas 
are 
described 
by 
projectiles 
having 
the 
same 
initial 
speed; 
all 
vertical 
heights 
thus 
obtained 
are 
therefore 
included 
between 
two 
parallel 
horizontal 
lines. 
Let 
cb 
represent 
a 
horizontal 
line 
and 
ab 
a 
vertical 
line 
of 
equal 
length; 
draw 
the 
diagonal 
ac; 
the 
angle 
acb 
will 
be 
one 
of 
45°; 
let 
d 
be 
the 
middle 
point 
of 
the 
vertical 
line 
ab. 
Then 
the 
semi-parabola 
dc 
is 
the 
one 
which 
is 
determined 
by 
the 
sublimity 
ad 
and 
the 
altitude 
db, 
while 
its 
terminal 
speed 
at 
c 
is 
that 
which 
would 
be 
acquired 
at 
b 
by 
a 
particle 
falling 
from 
rest 
at 
a. 
If 
now 
ag 
be 
drawn 
parallel 
to 
bc, 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
altitude 
and 
sublimity 
for 
any 
other 
semi-parabola 
having 
the 
same 
terminal 
speed 
will, 
in 
the 
manner 
explained, 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
distance 
between 
the 
parallel 
lines 
ag 
and 
bc. 
Moreover, 
since 
it 
has 
already 
been 
shown 
that 
the 
amplitudes 
of 
two 
semi-parabolas 
arethesamewhentheiranglesofelevationdifferfrom45° 
by 
like 
amounts, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
same 
computation 
which 
is 
employed 
for 
the 
larger 
elevation 
will 
serve 
also 
for 
the 
smaller. 
Let 
us 
also 
assume 
10000 
as 
the 
greatest 
amplitude 
for 
a 
parabola 
whose 
angle 
of 
elevation 
is 
45°; 
this 
then 
will 
be 
the 
length 
of 
the 
line 
ba 
and 
the 
amplitude 
of 
the 
semi-parabola 
bc. 
This 
number, 
10000, 
is 
selected 
because 
in 
these 
calculations 
we 
employ 
a 
table 
of 
tangents 
in 
which 
this 
is 
the 
value 
of 
the 
tangent 
of 
45°. 
And 
now, 
coming 
down 
to 
business, 
draw 
the 
straight 
line 
ce 
making 
an 
acute 
angle 
ecb 
greater 
than 
acb: 
the 
problem 
now 
is 
to 
draw 
the 
semi-parabola 
to 
which 
the 
line 
ec 
is 
a 
tangent 
and 
for 
which 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
sublimity 
and 
the 
altitude 
is 
the 
distance 
ba. 
Take 
the 
length 
of 
the 
tangent42be 
from 
the 
table 
of 
tangents, 
usingtheangle 
bce 
asanargument:let 
f 
bethemiddlepointof 
be; 
nextfinda 
third 
proportional 
to 
bf 
and 
bi 
(the 
half 
of 
bc), 
which 
is 
of 
necessity 
greater 
than 
fa.43 
Call 
this 
fo. 
We 
have 
now 
discovered 
that, 
for 
the 
parabola 
inscribed 
in 
the 
triangle 
ecb 
having 
the 
tangent 
ce 
and 
the 
amplitude 
cb, 
the 
altitude 
is 
bf 
and 
the 
sublimity 
fo. 
But 
the 
total 
length 
of 
bo 
exceeds 
the 
distance 
between 
the 
parallels 
ag 
and 
cb, 
while 
our 
problem 
was 
to 
keep 
it 
equal 
to 
this 
distance: 
for 
both 
the 
parabola 
sought 
and 
the 
parabola 
dc 
are 
described 
by 
projectiles 
fired 
from 
c 
with 
the 
same 
speed. 
Now 
since 
an 



infinite 
number 
of 
greater 
and 
smaller 
parabolas, 
similar 
to 
each 
other, 
may 
be 
described 
within 
the 
angle 
bce 
we 
must 
find 
another 
parabola 
which 
like 
cd 
hasforthesumofitsaltitudeand 
sublimitytheheight 
ba, 
equal 
to 
bc. 


42 
The 
reader 
will 
observe 
that 
the 
word 
“tangent” 
is 
here 
used 
in 
a 
sense 
somewhat 
different 
from 
that 
of 
the 
preceding 
sentence. 
The 
“tangent 
ec” 
is 
a 
line 
which 
touches 
the 
parabola 
at 
c; 
but 
the 
“tangent 
eb” 
is 
the 
side 
of 
the 
right-angled 
triangle 
which 
lies 
opposite 
the 
angle 
ecb, 
a 
line 
whose 
length 
is 
proportional 
to 
the 
numerical 
valueofthetangent 
ofthis 
angle.

paragraph 
below. 
[Trans.] 



Therefore 
lay 
off 
cr 
so 
that, 
ob:ba=bc:cr; 
then 
cr 
will 
be 
the 
amplitude 
of 
a 
semi-parabola 
for 
which 
bce 
is 
the 
angle 
of 
elevation 
and 
for 
which 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
altitude 
and 
sublimity 
is 
the 
distance 
between 
the 
parallels 
ga 
and 
cb, 
as 
desired. 
The 
process 
is 
therefore 
as 
follows: 
One 
draws 
the 
tangent 
of 
the 



given 
angle 
bce; 
takes 
half 
of 
this 
tangent, 
and 
adds 
to 
it 
the 
quantity, 
fo, 
which 
is 
a 
third 
proportional 
to 
the 
half 
of 
this 
tangent 
and 
the 
half 
of 
bc; 
the 
desired 
amplitude 
cr 
is 
then 
found 
from 
the 
following 
proportion 
ob:ba=bc:cr. 
For 
example 
let 
the 
angle 
ecb 
be 
one 
of 
50°; 
its 
tangent 
is 
11918, 
half 
of 
which, 
namely 
bf, 
is 
5959; 
half 
of 
bc 
is 
5000; 
the 
third 
proportional 
of 
these 
halves 
is 
4195, 
which 
added 
to 
bf 
gives 
the 
value 
10154 
for 
bo. 
Further, 
as 
ob 
is 
to 
ab, 
that 
is, 
as 
10154 
is 
to 
10000, 
so 
is 
bc, 
or10000 
(each 
being 
the 
tangent 
of 
45°) 
to 
cr, 
which 
is 
the 
amplitude 
sought 
and 
which 
has 
the 
value 
9848, 
the 
maximum 
amplitude 
being 
bc, 
or 
10000. 
The 
amplitudes 
of 
the 
entire 
parabolas 
are 
double 
these, 
namely, 
19696 
and 
20000. 
This 
is 
also 
the 
amplitude 
of 
a 
parabola 
whose 
angle 
of 
elevation 
is 
40°,sinceitdeviates 
byanequalamountfromoneof45°. 


In 
order 
to 
thoroughly 
understand 
this 
demonstration 
I 
need 
to 
be 
shown 
how 
the 
third 
proportional 
of 
bf 
and 
bi 
is, 
as 
the 
Author 
indicates, 
necessarily 
greaterthan 
fa. 


Salv. 
This 
result 
can, 
I 
think, 
be 
obtained 
as 
follows. 
The 
square 
of 
the 
mean 
proportional 
between 
two 
lines 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
rectangle 
formed 
by 
these 
two 
lines. 
Therefore 
the 
square 
of 
bi 
(or 
of 
bd 
which 
is 
equal 
to 
bi) 
must 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
rectangle 
formed 
by 
fb 
and 
the 
desired 
third 
proportional. 
This 
third 
proportional 
is 
necessarily 
greater 
than 
fa 
because 
the 
rectangle 
formed 
by 
bf 
and 
fa 
is 
less 
than 
the 
square 
of 
bd 
by 
an 
amount 
equal 
to 
the 
square 
of 
df, 
as 
shown 
in 
Euclid, 
II. 
1. 
Besides 
it 
is 
to 
be 
observed 
that 
the 
point 
f, 
which 
is 
the 
middle 
point 
of 
the 
tangent 
eb, 
falls 
in 
general 
above 
a 
and 
only 
once 
at 
a; 
in 
which 
cases 
it 
is 
self-evident 
that 
the 
third 
proportional 
to 
the 
half 
of 
the 
tangent 
and 
to 
the 
sublimity 
bi 
lies 
wholly 
above 
a. 
But 
the 
Author 
has 
taken 
a 
case 
where 
it 
is 
not 
evident 
that 
the 
third 
proportional 
is 
always 
greater 
than 
fa, 
sothat 
when

Sagr. 
I 
shall 
be 
very 
glad 
to 
see 
this; 
for 
from 
it 
I 
shall 
learn 
the 
difference 
of 
speed 
and 
force 
[degl’

to 
fire 
projectiles 
over 
thesame 
range 
with 
whatwe 
call 
mortar 
shots. 
Thisdifferencewill, 
I 
believe, 
vary 
greatly 
with 
the 
elevation 
so 
that 
if, 
for 
example, 
one 
wished 
to 
employ 
an 
elevation 
of 
3° 
or 
4°, 
or 
87° 
or 
88° 
and 
yet 
give 
the 
ball 
the 
same 
range 



which 
it 
had 
with 
an

Proposition 
XIV 


To 
find 
for 
each 
degree 
of 
elevation 
the 
altitudes 
and 
sublimities 
of 
parabolas 
ofconstantamplitude. 


Here 
we 
see, 
first 
of 
all, 
how 
very 
true 
is 
the 
statement 
made 
above, 
that, 
for 
different 
angles 
of 
elevation, 
the 
greater 
the 
deviation 
from 
the 
mean, 
whether 
above 
or 
below, 
the 
greater 
the 
initial 
speed 
[impeto 
e 
violenza] 
required 
to 
carry 
the 
projectile 
over 
the 
same 
range. 
For 
since 
the 
speed 
is 
the 
resultant 
of 
two 
motions, 
namely, 
one 
horizontal 
and 
uniform, 
the 
other 
vertical 
and 
naturally 
accelerated; 
and 
since 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
altitude 
and 
sublimity 
represents 
this 
speed, 
it 
is 
seen 
from 
the 
preceding 
table 
that 
this 
sum 
is 
a 
minimum 
for 
an 
elevation 
of 
45° 
where 
the 
altitude 
and 
sublimity 
are 
equal, 
namely, 
each 
5000; 
and 
their 
sum 
10000. 
But 
if 
we 
choose 
a 
greater 
elevation, 
say 
50°, 
we 
shall 
find 
the 
altitude 
5959, 
and 
the 
sublimity 
4196, 
giving 
a 
sum 
of 
10155; 
in 
like 
manner 
we 
shall 
find 
that 
this 
is 
precisely 
the 
value 
of 
the 
speed 
at 
40° 
elevation, 
both 
angles 
deviating 
equallyfromthemean. 


Secondly 
it 
is 
to 
be 
noted 
that, 
while 
equal 
speeds 
are 
required 
for 
each 
of 
two 
elevations 
that 
are 
equidistant 
from 
the 
mean, 
there 
is 
this 
curious 
alternation, 
namely, 
that 
the 
altitude 
and 
sublimity 
at 
the 
greater 
elevation 



correspond 
inversely 
to 
the 
sublimity 
and 
altitude 
at 
the 
lower 
elevation. 
Thus 
in 
the 
preceding 
example 
an 
elevation 
of 
50° 
gives 
an 
altitude 
of 
5959 
and 
a 
sublimity 
of 
4196; 
while 
an 
elevation 
of 
40° 
corresponds 
to 
an 
altitude 
of 
4196 
and 
a 
sublimity 
of 
5959. 
And 
this 
holds 
true 
in 
general; 
but 
it 
is 
to 
be 
remembered 
that, 
in 
order 
to 
escape 
tedious 
calculations, 
no 
account 
has 
been 
taken 
of 
fractions 
which 
are 
of 
little 
moment 
in 
comparison 
with 
such 
large 
numbers. 


Sagr. 
I 
note 
also 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
two 
components 
of 
the 
initial 
speed 
[impeto] 
that 
the 
higher 
the 
shot 
the 
less 
is 
the 
horizontal 
and 
the 
greater 
the 
vertical 
component; 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
at 
lower 
elevations 
where 
the 
shot 
reaches 
only 
a 
small 
height 
the 
horizontal 
component 
of 
the 
initial 
speed 
must 
be 
great. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
a 
projectile 
fired 
at 
an 
elevation 
of 
90°, 
I 
quite 
understand 
that 
all 
the 
force 
[forza] 
in 
the 
world 
would 
not 
be 
sufficient 
to 
make 
it 
deviate 
a 
single 
finger’s 
breadth 
from 
the 
perpendicular 
and 
that 
it 
would 
necessarily 
fall 
back 
into 
its 
initial 
position; 
but 
in 
the 
case 
of 
zero 
elevation, 
when 
the 
shot 
is 
fired 
horizontally, 
I 
am 
not 
so 
certain 
that 
some 
force, 
less 
than 
infinite, 
would 
not 
carry 
the 
projectile 
some 
distance; 
thus 
not 
even 
a 
cannon 
can 
fire 
a 
shot 
in 
a 
perfectly 
horizontal 
direction, 
or 
as 
we 
say, 
point 
blank, 
that 
is, 
with 
no 
elevation 
at 
all. 
Here 
I 
admit 
there 
is 
some 
room 
for 
doubt. 
The 
fact 
I 
do 
not 
deny 
outright, 
because 
of 
another 
phenomenon 
apparently 
no 
less 
remarkable, 
but 
yet 
one 
for 
which 
I 
have 
conclusive 
evidence. 
This 
phenomenon 
is 
the 
impossibility 
of 
stretching 
a 
rope 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
it 
shall 
be 
at 
once 
straight 
and 
parallel 
to 
the 
horizon; 
the 
fact 
is 
that 
the 
cord 
always 
sags 
and 
bends 
and 
that 
no 
force 
is 
sufficient 
to 
stretch 
it 
perfectlystraight. 


Salv. 
In 
this 
case 
of 
the 
rope 
then, 
Sagredo, 
you 
cease 
to 
wonder 
at 
the 
phenomenon 
because 
you 
have 
its 
demonstration; 
but 
if 
we 
consider 
it 
with 
more 
care 
we 
may 
possibly 
discover 
some 
correspondence 
between 
the 
case 
of 
the 
gun 
and 
that 
of 
the 
string. 
The 
curvature 
of 
the 
path 
of 
the 
shot 
fired 
horizontally 
appears 
to 
result 
from 
two 
forces, 
one 
(that 
of 
the 
weapon) 
drives 
it 
horizontally 
and 
the 
other 
(its 
own 
weight) 
draws 
it 
vertically 
downward. 
So 
in 
stretching 
the 
rope 
you 
have 
the 
force 
which 
pulls 
it 
horizontally 
and 
its 
own 
weight 
which 
acts 
downwards. 
The 
circumstances 
in 
these 
two 
cases 
are, 
therefore, 
very 
similar. 
If 
then 
you 
attribute 
to 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
rope 
a 
power 
and 
energy 
[possanza 
ed 
energia] 
sufficient 
to 
oppose 



and 
overcome 
any 
stretching 
force, 
no 
matter 
how 
great, 
why 
deny 
this 
power 
tothebullet? 


BesidesImusttellyousomethingwhichwillbothsurprise 
andpleaseyou, 
namely, 
that 
a 
cord 
stretched 
more 
or 
less 
tightly 
assumes 
a 
curve 
which 
closely 
approximates 
the 
parabola. 
This 
similarity 
is 
clearly 
seen 
if 
you 
draw 
a 
parabolic 
curve 
on 
a 
vertical 
plane 
and 
then 
invert 
it 
so 
that 
the 
apex 
will 
lie 
at 
the 
bottom 
and 
the 
base 
remain 
horizontal; 
for, 
on 
hanging 
a 
chain 
below 
the 
base, 
one 
end 
attached 
to 
each 
extremity 
of 
the 
base, 
you 
will 
observe 
that, 
on 
slackening 
the 
chain 
more 
or 
less, 
it 
bends 
and 
fits 
itself 
to 
the 
parabola; 
and 
the 
coincidence 
is 
more 
exact 
in 
proportion 
as 
the 
parabola 
is 
drawn 
with 
less 
curvature 
or, 
so 
to 
speak, 
more 
stretched; 
so 
that 
using 
parabolas 
described 
with 
elevations 
less 
than 
45° 
the 
chain 
fits 
its 
parabola 
almostperfectly. 


Sagr. 
Then 
with 
a 
fine 
chain 
one 
would 
be 
able 
to 
quickly 
draw 
many 
paraboliclinesupon 
aplanesurface. 


Salv. 
Certainly 
andwithnosmalladvantage 
asIshallshowyoulater. 


Simp. 
But 
before 
going 
further, 
I 
am 
anxious 
to 
be 
convinced 
at 
least 
of 
that 
proposition 
of 
which 
you 
say 
that 
there 
is 
a 
rigid 
demonstration; 
I 
refer 
to 
the 
statement 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
by 
any 
force 
whatever 
to 
stretch 
a 
cord 
so 
that 
it 
willlieperfectlystraightandhorizontal. 


Sagr. 
I 
will 
see 
if 
I 
can 
recall 
the 
demonstration; 
but 
in 
order 
to 
understand 
it, 
Simplicio, 
it 
will 
be 
necessary 
for 
you 
to 
take 
for 
granted 
concerning 
machines 
what 
is 
evident 
not 
alone 
from 
experiment 
but 
also 
from 
theoretical 
considerations, 
namely, 
that 
the 
velocity 
of 
a 
moving 
body 
[velocità 
del 
movente], 
even 
when 
its 
force 
[forza] 
is 
small, 
can 
overcome 
a 
very 
great 
resistance 
exerted 
by 
a 
slowly 
moving 
body, 
whenever 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
moving 
body 
bears 
to 
that 
of 
the 
resisting 
body 
a 
greater 
ratio 
than 
the 
resistance[resistenza] 
of 
the 
resisting 
body 
to 
the 
force 
[forza] 
of 
the 
moving 
body. 


Simp. 
This 
I 
know 
very 
well 
for 
it 
has 
been 
demonstrated 
by 
Aristotle 
in 
his 
Questions 
in 
Mechanics; 
it 
is 
also 
clearly 
seen 
in 
the 
lever 
and 
the 
steelyard 
where 
a 
counterpoise 
weighing 
not 
more 
than 
4 
pounds 
will 
lift 
a 
weight 
of 



400 
provided 
that 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
counterpoise 
from 
the 
axis 
about 
which 
the 
steelyard 
rotates 
be 
more 
than 
one 
hundred 
times 
as 
great 
as 
the 
distance 
between 
this 
axis 
and 
the 
point 
of 
support 
for 
the 
large 
weight. 
This 
is 
true 
because 
the 
counterpoise 
in 
its 
descent 
traverses 
a 
space 
more 
than 
one 
hundred 
times 
as 
great 
as 
that 
moved 
over 
by 
the 
large 
weight 
in 
the 
same 
time; 
in 
other 
words 
the 
small 
counterpoise 
moves 
with 
a 
velocity 
which 
is 
morethanonehundredtimesasgreatasthatofthelargeweight. 


Sagr. 
You 
are 
quite 
right; 
you 
do 
not 
hesitate 
to 
admit 
that 
however 
small 
the 
force 
[forza] 
of 
the 
moving 
body 
it 
will 
overcome 
any 
resistance, 
however 
great, 
provided 
it 
gains 
more 
in 
velocity 
than 
it 
loses 
in 
force 
and 
weight 
[vigore 
e 
gravità]. 
Now 
let 
us 
return 
to 
the 
case 
of 
the 
cord. 
In 
the 
accompanying 
figure 
ab 
represents 
a 
line 
passing 
through 
two 
fixed 
points 
a 
and 
b; 
at 
the 
extremities 
of 
this 
line 
hang, 
as 
you 
see, 
two 
large 
weights 
c 
and 
d, 
which 
stretch 
it 
with 
great 
force 
and 
keep 
it 
truly 
straight, 
seeing 
that 
it 
is 
merely 
a 
line 
without 
weight. 
Now 
I 
wish 
to 
remark 
that 
if 
from 
the 
middle 
point 
of 
this 
line, 
which 
we 
may 
call 
e, 
you 
suspend 
any 
small 
weight, 
say 
h, 
the 
line 
ab 
will 
yield 
toward 
the 
point 
f 
and 
on 
account 
of 
its 
elongation 
will 
compel 
the 
two 
heavy 
weights 
c 
and 
d 
to 
rise. 
This 
I 
shall 
demonstrate 
as 
follows:withthepoints 
a 
and 
b 
ascentersdescribethetwoquadrants, 
eig 
and 
elm; 
now 
since 
the 
two 
semidiameters 
ai 
and 
bl 
are 
equal 
to 
ae 
and 
eb, 
the 
remainders 
fi 
and 
fl 
are 
the 
excesses 
of 
the 
lines 
af 
and 
fb 
over 
ae 
and 
eb; 
they 
therefore 
determine 
the 
rise 
of 
the 
weights 
c 
and 
d, 
assuming 
of 
course 
that 
the 
weight 
h 
has 
taken 
the 
position 
f. 
But 
the 
weight 
h 
will 
take 
the 
position 
f, 
whenever 
the 
line 
ef 
which 
represents 
the 
descent 
of 
h 
bears 
to 
the 
line 
fi 
— 
that 
is, 
to 
the 
rise 
of 
the 
weights 
c 
and 
d 
— 
a 
ratio 
which 
is 
greater 
than 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
two 
large 
bodies 
to 
thatof 
the 
body 
h. 
Even 
when 
the 
weights 
of 
c 
and 
d 
are 
very 
great 
and 
that 
of 
h 
very 
small 
this 
will 
happen; 
for 
the 
excess 
of 
the 
weights 
c 
and 
d 
over 
the 
weight 
of 
h 
can 
never 
be 
so 
great 
but 
that 
the 
excess 
of 
the 
tangent 
ef 
over 
the 
segment 
fi 
may 
be 
proportionally 
greater. 
This 
may 
be 
proved 
as 
follows: 
Draw 
a 
circle 
of 
diameter 
gai; 
draw 
the 
line 
bo 
such 
that 
the 
ratio 
of 
its 
length 
to 
another 
length 
c, 
c>d, 
is 
the 
same 
as 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
weights 
c 
and 
d 
to 
the 
weight 
h. 
Since 
c>d, 
the 
ratio 
of 
bo 
to 
d 
is 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
bo 
to 
c. 
Take 
be 
a 
third 
proportional 
to 
ob 
and 
d; 
prolong 
the 
diameter 
gi 
to 
a 
point 
f 
such 
that 
gi:if=oe:eb; 
and 
from 
the 
point 
f 
draw 
the 
tangent 
fn; 
then 
since 
we 
already 



have 
oe:eb=gi:if, 
we 
shall 
obtain, 
by 
compounding 
ratios, 
ob:eb=gf:if. 
But 
d 
is 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
ob 
and 
be; 
while 
nf 
is 
a 
mean 
proportional 
between 
gf 
and 
fi. 
Hence 
nf 
bears 
to 
fi 
the 
same 
ratio 
as 
that 
of 
cb 
to 
d, 
which 
is 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
the 
weights 
c 
and 
d 
to 
the 
weight 
h. 
Since 
then 
the 
descent, 
or 
velocity, 
of 
the 
weight 
h 
bears 
to 
the 
rise, 
or 
velocity, 
of 
the 
weights 
c 
and 
d 
a 
greater 
ratio 
than 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
bodies 
c 
and 
d 
bears 
to 
the 
weight 
of 
h, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
weight 
h 
will 
descend 
and 
the 
line 
ab 
will 


ceasetobestraightandhorizontal.
And 
now 
this 
which 
happens 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
weightless 
cord 
ab 
whenany

Simp. 
I 
am 
fully 
satisfied. 
So 
now 
Salviati 
can 
explain, 
as 
he 
promised, 
the 
advantage 
of 
such 
a 
chain 
and, 
afterwards, 
present 
the 
speculations 
of 
our 
Academicianon 
thesubject 
ofimpulsiveforces 
[forza 
della 
percossa]. 


Salv. 
Let 
the 
preceding 
discussions 
suffice 
for 
to-day; 
the 
hour 
is 
already 
late 
and 
the 
time 
remaining 
will 
not 
permit 
us 
to 
clear 
up 
the 
subjects 
proposed; 
we 
may 
therefore 
postpone 
our 
meeting 
until 
another 
and 
more 
opportune 
occasion. 


Sagr. 
I 
concur 
in 
your 
opinion, 
because 
after 
various 
conversations 
with 
intimate 
friends 
of 
our 
Academician 
I 
have 
concluded 
that 
this 
question 
of 
impulsive 
forces 
is 
very 
obscure, 
and 
I 
think 
that, 
up 
to 
the 
present, 
none 
of 
those 
who 
have 
treated 
this 
subject 
have 
been 
able 
to 
clear 
up 
its 
dark 
corners 
which 
lie 
almost 
beyond 
the 
reach 
of 
human 
imagination; 
among 
the 
various 
views 
which 
I 
have 
heard 
expressed 
one, 
strangely 
fantastic, 
remains 
in 
my 
memory, 
namely, 
that 
impulsive 
forces 
are 
indeterminate, 
if 
not 
infinite. 
Let 
us, 
therefore, 
await 
the 
convenience 
of 
Salviati. 
Meanwhile 
tell 
me 
what 
is 
this 
whichfollowsthediscussionof 
projectiles. 
Salv. 
These 
are 
some 
theorems 
pertaining 
to 
the 
centers 
of 
gravity 
of 
solids, 
discovered 
by 
our 
Academician 
in 
his 
youth, 
and 
undertaken 
by 
him 
because 
he 
considered 
the 
treatment 
of 
Federigo 
Comandino 
to 
be 
somewhat 
incomplete. 
The 
propositions 
which 
you 
have 
before 
you 
would, 
he 
thought, 
meet 
the 
deficiencies 
of 
Comandino’s 
book. 
The 
investigation 
was 
undertaken 
at 
the 
instance 
of 
the 
Illustrious 
Marquis 
Guid’ 
Ubaldo 
Dal 
Monte, 
a 
very 
distinguished 
mathematician 
of 
his 
day, 
as 
is 
evidenced 
by 
his 
various 
publications. 
To 
this 
gentleman 
our 
Academician 
gave 
a 
copy 
of 
this 
work, 
hoping 
to 
extend 
the 
investigation 
to 
other 
solids 
not 
treated 
by 
Comandino. 
But 
a 
little 
later 
there 
chanced 
to 
fall 
into 
his 
hands 
the 
book 
of 
the 
great 
geometrician, 
Luca 
Valerio, 
where 
he 
found 
the 
subject 
treated 
so 
completely 
that 
he 
left 
off 
his 
own 
investigations, 
although 
the 
methods 
which 
heemployedwerequitedifferentfromthoseofValerio. 


Sagr. 
Please 
be 
good 
enough 
to 
leave 
this 
volume 
with 
me 
until 
our 
next 
meeting 
so 
that 
I 
may 
be 
able 
to 
read 
and 
study 
these 
propositions 
in 
the 
orderinwhichtheyarewritten. 



Salv. 
It 
is 
a 
pleasure 
to 
comply 
with 
your 
request 
and 
I 
only 
hope 
that 
the 
propositionswill

The 
history 
of 
the 
life 
and 
labours 
of 
Galileo 
is 
pregnant 
with 
a 
peculiar 
interest 
to 
the 
general 
reader, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
the 
philosopher. 
His 
brilliant 
discoveries, 
the 
man 
of 
science 
regards 
as 
his 
peculiar 
property; 
the 
means 
by 
which 
they 
were 
made, 
and 
the 
development 
of 
his 
intellectual 
character, 
belong 
to 
the 
logician 
and 
to 
the 
philosopher; 
but 
the 
triumphs 
and 
the 
reverses 
of 
his 
eventful 
life 
must 
be 
claimed 
for 
our 
common 
nature, 
as 
a 
sourceofmorethanordinary 
instruction. 


The 
lengthened 
career 
which 
Providence 
assigned 
to 
Galileo 
was 
filled 
up 
throughout 
its 
rugged 
outline 
with 
events 
even 
of 
dramatic 
interest. 
But 
though 
it 
was 
emblazoned 
with 
achievements 
of 
transcendent 
magnitude, 
yet 
his 
noblest 
discoveries 
were 
the 
derision 
of 
his 
contemporaries, 
and 
were 
even 
denounced 
as 
crimes 
which 
merited 
the 
vengeance 
of 
Heaven. 
Though 
he 
was 
the 
idol 
of 
his 
friends, 
and 
the 
favoured 
companion 
of 
princes, 
yet 
he 
afterwards 
became 
the 
victim 
of 
persecution, 
and 
spent 
some 
of 
his 
last 
hours 
within 
the 
walls 
of 
a 
prison; 
and 
though 
the 
Almighty 
granted 
him, 
as 
it 
were, 
a 
new 
sight 
to 
descry 
unknown 
worlds 
in 
the 
obscurity 
of 
space, 
yet 
the 
eyes 
which 
were 
allowed 
to 
witness 
such 
wonders, 
were 
themselves 
doomed 
to 
be 
closedindarkness. 


Suchwerethelightsand

delineates 


“Thestarry

But, 
however 
powerful 
be 
their 
contrasts, 
they 
are 
not 
unusual 
in 
their 
proportions. 
Thebalancewhich

is 
that 
which 
regulates 
the 
lot 
of 
man, 
whether 
we 
study 
it 
in 
the 
despotic 
sway 
of 
the 
autocrat, 
in 
the 
peaceful 
inquiries 
of 
the 
philosopher, 
or

Galileo 
Galilei 
was 
born 
at 
Pisa, 
on 
the 
15th 
of 
February, 
1564, 
and 
was 
the 
eldest 
of 
a 
family 
of 
three 
sons 
and 
three 
daughters. 
Under 
the 
name 
of 
Bonajuti, 
his 
noble 
ancestors 
had 
filled 
high 
offices 
at 
Florence; 
but 
about 
the 
middle 
ofthe 
14th 
century 
they 
seem 
tohave 
abandonedthissurname 
for 
that 
of 
Galileo. 
Vincenzo 
Galilei, 
our 
author’s 
father, 
was 
himself 
a 
philosopher 
of 
no 
mean 
powers; 
and 
though 
his 
talents 
seem 
to 
have 
been 
exercised 
only 
in 
the 
composition 
of 
treatises 
on 
the 
theory 
and 
practice 
of 
music, 
yet 
he 
appears 
to 
have 
anticipated 
even 
his 
son 
in 
a 
just 
estimate 
of 
the 
philosophy 
of 
the 
age, 
and 
in 
a 
distinct 
perception 
of 
the 
true 
method 
of 
investigating 
truth. 


The 
earlyyears 
of 
Galileo 
were, 
like 
those 
of 
almostall 
greatexperimental 
philosophers, 
spent 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
instruments 
and 
pieces 
of 
machinery, 
which 
were 
calculated 
chiefly 
to 
amuse 
himself 
and 
his 
schoolfellows. 
This 
employment 
of 
his 
hands, 
however, 
did 
not 
interfere 
with 
his 
regular 
studies; 
and 
though, 
from 
the 
straitened 
circumstances 
of 
his 
father,he 
waseducatedunder 
considerable 
disadvantages, 
yet 
he 
acquired 
the 
elements 
of 
classical 
literature, 
and 
was 
initiated 
into 
all 
the 
learning 
of 
the 
times. 
Music, 
drawing, 
and 
painting 
were 
the 
occupations 
of 
his 
leisure 
hours; 
and 
such 
was 
his 
proficiency 
in 
these 
arts, 
that 
he 
was 
reckoned 
a 
skilful 
performer 
on 
several 
musical 
instruments, 
especially 
the 
lute; 
and 
his 
knowledge 
of 
pictures 
was 
held 
in 
great 
esteem 
by 
some 
of 
the 
best 
artists 
of 
hisday. 


Galileo 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
desirous 
of 
following 
the 
profession 
of 
a 
painter: 
but 
his 
father 
had 
observed 
decided 
indications 
of 
early 
genius; 
and, 
though 
by 
no 
means 
able 
to 
afford 
it, 
he 
resolved 
to 
send 
him 
to 
the 
university 
to 
pursue 
the 
study 
of 
medicine. 
He 
accordingly 
enrolled 
himself 
as 
a 
scholar 
in 
arts 
at 
the 
university 
of 
Pisa, 
on 
the 
5th 
of 
November, 
1581, 
and 
pursued 
his 
medical 
studies 
under 
the 
celebrated 
botanist 
Andrew 
Cæsalpinus, 
whofilledthechairofmedicinefrom1567 
to1592. 


In 
order 
to 
study 
the 
principles 
of 
music 
and 
drawing, 
Galileo 
found 
it 
necessary 
to 
acquire 
some 
knowledge 
of 
geometry. 
His 
father 
seems 
to 
have 
foreseen 
the 
consequences 
of 
following 
this 
new 
pursuit, 
and 
though 
he 
did 
not 
prohibit 
him 
from 
reading 
Euclid 
under 
Ostilio 
Ricci, 
one 
of 
the 
professors 
at 
Pisa, 
yet 
he 
watched 
his 
progress 
with 
the 
utmost 
jealousy, 
and 
had 
resolved 
that 
it 
should 
not 
interfere 
with 
his 
medical 
studies. 
The 
demonstrations, 
however, 
of 
the 
Greek 
mathematician 
had 
too 
many 
charms 
for 
the 
ardent 
mind 
of 
Galileo. 
His 
whole 
attention 
was 
engrossed 
with 
the 



new 
truths 
which 
burst 
upon 
his 
understanding; 
and 
after 
many 
fruitless 
attempts 
to 
check 
his 
ardour 
and 
direct 
his 
thoughts 
to 
professional 
objects, 
his 
father 
was 
obliged 
to 
surrender 
his 
parental 
control, 
and 
allow 
the 
fullest 
scopetothegenius 
ofhisson. 


From 
the 
elementary 
works 
of 
geometry, 
Galileo 
passed 
to 
the 
writings 
of 
Archimedes; 
and 
while 
he 
was 
studying 
the 
hydrostatical 
treatise 
of 
the 
Syracusan 
philosopher, 
he 
wrote 
his 
essay 
on 
the 
hydrostatical 
balance, 
in 
which 
he 
describes 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
instrument, 
and 
the 
method 
by 
which 
Archimedes 
detected 
the 
fraud 
committed 
by 
the 
jeweller 
in 
the 
composition 
of 
Hiero’s 
crown. 
This 
work 
gained 
for 
its 
author 
the 
esteem 
of 
Guido 
Ubaldi, 
who 
had 
distinguished 
himself 
by 
his 
mechanical 
and 
mathematical 
acquirements, 
and 
who 
engaged 
his 
young 
friend 
to 
investigate 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
centre 
of 
gravity 
in 
solid 
bodies. 
The 
treatise 
on 
this 
subject, 
which 
Galileo 
presented 
to 
his 
patron, 
proved 
the 
source 
of 
his 
future 
successinlife. 


Through 
the 
Cardinal 
del 
Monte, 
the 
brother-in-law 
of 
Ubaldi, 
the 
reigning 
Duke 
of 
Tuscany, 
Ferdinand 
de 
Medici 
was 
made 
acquainted 
with 
the 
merits 
of 
our 
young 
philosopher; 
and, 
in 
1589, 
he 
was 
appointed 
lecturer 
on 
mathematics 
at 
Pisa. 
As 
the 
salary, 
however, 
attached 
to 
this 
office 
was 
onlysixty 
crowns,hewascompelled 
toenlargethis 
inadequateincomebythe 
additional 
occupation 
of 
private 
teaching, 
and 
thus 
to 
encroach 
upon 
the 
leisurewhichhewas 
anxious 
todevotetoscience. 


With 
this 
moderate 
competency, 
Galileo 
commenced 
his 
philosophical 
career. 
At 
the 
early 
age 
of 
eighteen, 
when 
he 
had 
entered 
the 
university, 
his 
innate 
antipathy 
to 
the 
Aristotelian 
philosophy 
began 
to 
display 
itself. 
This 
feeling 
was 
strengthened 
by 
his 
earliest 
inquiries; 
and 
upon 
his 
establishment 
at 
Pisa 
he 
seems 
to 
have 
regarded 
the 
doctrines 
of 
Aristotle 
as 
the 
intellectual 
prey 
which, 
in 
his 
chace 
of 
glory, 
he 
was 
destined 
to 
pursue. 
Nizzoli, 
who 
flourished 
near 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
sixteenth 
century, 
and 
Giordano 
Bruno, 
who 
was 
burned 
at 
Rome 
in 
1600, 
led 
the 
way 
in 
this 
daring 
pursuit; 
but 
it 
was 
reserved 
for 
Galileo 
to 
track 
the 
Thracian 
boar 
through 
its 
native 
thickets,and,attheriskofhisownlife,tostrangleit 
initsden. 


With 
the 
resolution 
of 
submitting 
every 
opinion 
to 
the 
test 
of 
experiment, 
Galileo’s 
first 
inquiries 
at 
Pisa 
were 
directed 
to 
the 
mechanical 
doctrines 
of 
Aristotle. 
Theirincorrectnessand 
absurditysoonbecameapparent;andwitha 
zeal, 
perhaps, 
bordering 
on 
indiscretion, 
he 
denounced 
them 
to 
his 
pupils 
with 
an 
ardour 
of 
manner 
and 
of 
expression 
proportioned 
to 
his 
own 



conviction 
of 
the 
truth. 
The 
detection 
of 
long-established 
errors 
is 
apt 
to 
inspire 
the 
young 
philosopher 
with 
an 
exultation 
which 
reason 
condemns. 
The 
feeling 
of 
triumph 
is 
apt 
to 
clothe 
itself 
in 
the 
language 
of 
asperity; 
and 
the 
abettor 
of 
erroneous 
opinions 
is 
treated 
as 
a 
species 
of 
enemy 
to 
science. 
Like 
the 
soldier 
who 
fleshes 
his 
first 
spear 
in 
battle, 
the 
philosopher 
is 
apt 
to 
leave 
the 
stain 
of 
cruelty 
on 
his 
early 
achievements. 
It 
is 
only 
from 
age 
and 
experience, 
indeed, 
that 
we 
can 
expect 
the 
discretion 
of 
valour, 
whether 
it 
is 
called 
forth 
in 
controversy 
or 
in 
battle. 
Galileo 
seems 
to 
have 
waged 
this 
stern 
warfare 
against 
the 
followers 
of 
Aristotle; 
and 
such 
was 
the 
exasperation 
which 
was 
excited 
by 
his 
reiterated 
and 
successful 
attacks, 
that 
he 
was 
assailed, 
during 
the 
rest 
of 
his 
life, 
with 
a 
degree 
of 
rancour 
which 
seldom 
originates 
in 
a 
mere 
difference 
of 
opinion. 
Forgetting 
that 
all 
knowledge 
is 
progressive, 
and 
that 
the 
errors 
of 
one 
generation 
call 
forth 
the 
comments, 
and 
are 
replaced 
by 
the 
discoveries, 
of 
the 
next, 
Galileo 
did 
not 
anticipate 
that 
his 
own 
speculations 
and 
incompleted 
labours 
might 
one 
day 
provokeunmitigated 
censure; 
and 
hetherefore 
failedinmaking 
allowance 
for 
the 
prejudices 
and 
ignorance 
of 
his 
opponents. 
He 
who 
enjoys 
the 
proud 
lot 
of 
taking 
a 
position 
in 
advance 
of 
his 
age, 
need 
not 
wonder 
that 
his 
less 
gifted 
contemporaries 
are 
left 
behind. 
Men 
are 
not 
necessarily 
obstinate 
because 
they 
cleave 
to 
deeply 
rootedand 
venerable 
errors, 
nor 
arethey

It 
was 
one 
of 
the 
axioms 
of 
the 
Aristotelian 
mechanics, 
that 
the 
heavier 
of 
two 
falling 
bodies 
would 
reach 
the 
ground 
sooner 
than 
the 
other, 
and 
that 
their 
velocities 
would 
be 
proportional 
to 
their 
weights. 
Galileo 
attacked 
the 
arguments 
by 
which 
this 
opinion 
was 
supported; 
and 
when 
he 
found 
his 
reasoning 
ineffectual, 
he 
appealed 
to 
direct 
experiment. 
He 
maintained, 
that 
all 
bodies 
would 
fall 
through 
the 
same 
height 
in 
the 
same 
time, 
if 
they 
were 
not 
unequally 
retarded 
by 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
air: 
and 
though 
he 
performed 
the 
experiment 
with 
the 
most 
satisfactory 
results, 
by 
letting 
heavy 
bodies 
fall 
from 
the 
leaning 
tower 
of 
Pisa, 
yet 
the 
Aristotelians, 
who 
with 
their 
own 
eyes 
saw 
the 
unequal 
weights 
strike 
the 
ground 
at 
the 
same 
instant, 
ascribed 
the 
effect 
to 
some 
unknown 
cause, 
and 
preferred 
the 
decision 
of 
their 
master 
to 
that 
ofnatureherself. 


Galileo 
could 
not 
brook 
this 
opposition 
to 
his 
discoveries; 
nor 
could 
the 
Aristotelians 
tolerate 
the 
rebukes 
of 
their 
young 
instructor. 
The 
two 
parties 
were, 
consequently, 
marshalled 
in 
hostile 
array; 
when, 
fortunately 
for 
both, 



an 
event 
occurred, 
which 
placed 
them 
beyond 
the 
reach 
of 
danger. 
Don 
Giovanni 
de 
Medici, 
a 
natural 
son 
of 
Cosmo, 
had 
proposed 
a 
method 
of 
clearing 
out 
the 
harbour 
of 
Leghorn. 
Galileo, 
whose 
opinion 
was 
requested, 
gave 
such 
an 
unfavourable 
report 
upon 
it, 
that 
the 
disappointed 
inventor 
directed 
against 
him 
all 
the 
force 
of 
his 
malice. 
It 
was 
an 
easy 
task 
to 
concentrate 
the 
malignity 
of 
his 
enemies 
at 
Pisa; 
and 
so 
effectually 
was 
this 
accomplished, 
that 
Galileo 
resolved 
to 
accept 
another 
professorship, 
to 
which 
hehadbeenpreviouslyinvited. 


The 
chair 
of 
mathematics 
in 
the 
university 
of 
Padua 
having 
been 
vacant 
for 
five 
years, 
the 
republic 
of 
Venice 
had 
resolved 
to 
fill 
it 
up; 
and, 
on 
the 
recommendation 
of 
Guido 
Ubaldi, 
Galileo 
was 
appointed 
to 
it, 
in 
1592, 
for 
a 
periodofsixyears. 


Previous 
to 
this 
event, 
Galileo 
had 
lost 
his 
father, 
who 
died, 
in 
1591, 
at 
an 
advanced 
age. 
As 
he 
was 
the 
eldest 
son, 
the 
support 
of 
the 
family 
naturally 
devolved 
upon 
him; 
and 
this 
sacred 
obligation 
must 
have 
increased 
his 
anxiety 
to 
better 
his 
circumstances, 
and 
therefore 
added 
to 
his 
other 
inducements 
to 
quit 
Pisa. 
In 
September 
1592, 
he 
removed 
to 
Padua, 
where 
he 
had 
a 
salary 
of 
only 
180 
florins, 
and 
where 
he 
was 
again 
obliged 
to 
add 
to 
his 
income 
by 
the 
labours 
of 
tuition. 
Notwithstanding 
this 
fruitless 
occupation 
of 
histime, 
heappears 
tohavefoundleisureforcomposingseveralofhisworks, 
and 
completing 
various 
inventions, 
which 
will 
be 
afterwards 
described. 
His 
manuscripts 
were 
circulated 
privately 
among 
his 
friends 
and 
pupils; 
but 
some 
of 
them 
strayed 
beyond 
this 
sacred 
limit, 
and 
found 
their 
way 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
persons, 
who 
did 
not 
scruple 
to 
claim 
and 
publish, 
as 
their 
own, 
the 
discoveriesandinventionswhich 
theycontained. 


It 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
ascertain 
the 
exact 
time 
when 
Galileo 
became 
a 
convert 
to 
the 
doctrines 
of 
Copernicus, 
or 
the 
particular 
circumstances 
under 
which 
he 
was 
led 
to 
adopt 
them. 
It 
is 
stated 
by 
Gerard 
Voss, 
that 
a 
public 
lecture 
of 
Moestlin, 
the 
instructor 
of 
Kepler, 
was 
the 
means 
of 
making 
Galileo 
acquainted 
with 
the 
true 
system 
of 
the 
universe. 
This 
assertion, 
however, 
is 
by 
nomeansprobable; 
and 
it 
hasbeen 
ably 
shown, 
by 
thelatestbiographerof 
Galileo, 
that, 
in 
his 
dialogues 
on 
the 
Copernican 
system, 
our 
author 
gives 
the 
true 
account 
of 
his 
own 
conversion. 
This 
passage 
is 
so 
interesting, 
that 
we 
shallgive 
itentire. 


“I 
cannot 
omit 
this 
opportunity 
of 
relating 
to 
you 
what 
happened 
to 
myself 
at 
the 
time 
when 
this 
opinion 
(the 
Copernican 
system) 
began 
to 
be 
discussed. 
I 
was 
then 
a 
very 
young 
man, 
and 
had 
scarcely 
finished 
my 
course 
of 



philosophy, 
which 
other 
occupations 
obliged 
me 
to 
leave 
off, 
when 
there 
arrivedinthiscountry,from 
Rostoch, 
aforeigner,whosename,Ibelieve, 
was 
Christian 
Vurstisius 
(Wurteisen), 
a 
follower 
of 
Copernicus. 
This 
person 
delivered, 
on 
this 
subject, 
two 
or 
three 
lectures 
in 
a 
certain 
academy, 
and 
to 
a 
crowded 
audience. 
Believing 
that 
several 
were 
attracted 
more 
by 
the 
novelty 
of 
the 
subject 
than 
by 
any 
other 
cause, 
and 
being 
firmly 
persuaded 
that 
this 
opinion 
was 
a 
piece 
of 
solemn 
folly, 
I 
was 
unwilling 
to 
be 
present. 
Upon 
interrogating, 
however, 
some 
of 
those 
who 
were 
there, 
I 
found 
that 
they 
all 
made 
it 
a 
subject 
of 
merriment, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
one, 
who 
assured 
me 
that 
it 
was 
not 
a 
thing 
wholly 
ridiculous. 
As 
I 
considered 
this 
individual 
to 
be 
both 
prudent 
and 
circumspect, 
I 
repented 
that 
I 
had 
not 
attended 
the 
lectures; 
and, 
whenever 
I 
met 
any 
of 
the 
followers 
of 
Copernicus, 
I 
began 
to 
inquire 
if 
they 
had 
always 
been 
of 
the 
same 
opinion. 
I 
found 
that 
there 
was 
not 
one 
of 
them 
who 
did 
not 
declare 
that 
he 
had 
long 
maintained 
the 
very 
opposite 
opinions, 
and 
had 
not 
gone 
over 
to 
the 
new 
doctrines 
till 
he 
was 
driven 
by 
the 
force 
of 
argument. 
I 
next 
examined 
them 
one 
by 
one, 
to 
see 
if 
they 
were 
masters 
of 
the 
arguments 
on 
the 
opposite 
side; 
and 
such 
was 
the 
readiness 
of 
their 
answers, 
that 
I 
was 
satisfied 
they 
had 
not 
taken 
up 
this 
opinion 
from 
ignorance 
or 
vanity. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
whenever 
I 
interrogated 
the 
Peripatetics 
and 
the 
Ptolemeans 
— 
and, 
out 
of 
curiosity, 
I 
have 
interrogated 
not 
a 
few 
— 
respecting 
their 
perusal 
of 
Copernicus’s 
work, 
I 
perceived 
that 
there 
were 
few 
who 
had 
seen 
the 
book, 
and 
not 
one 
who 
understood 
it. 
Nor 
have 
I 
omitted 
to 
inquire 
among 
the 
followers 
of 
the 
Peripatetic 
doctrines, 
if 
any 
of 
them 
had 
ever 
stood 
on 
the 
opposite 
side; 
and 
the 
result 
was, 
that 
there 
was 
not 
one. 
Considering, 
then, 
that 
nobody 
followed 
the 
Copernican 
doctrine, 
who 
had 
not 
previously 
held 
the 
contrary 
opinion, 
and 
who 
was 
not 
well 
acquainted 
with 
the 
arguments 
of 
Aristotle 
and 
Ptolemy; 
while, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
nobody 
followed 
Ptolemy 
and 
Aristotle, 
who 
had 
before 
adhered 
to 
Copernicus, 
and 
had 
gone 
over 
from 
him 
into 
the 
camp 
of 
Aristotle; 
— 
weighing, 
I 
say, 
these 
things, 
I 
began 
to 
believe 
that, 
if 
any 
one 
who 
rejects 
an 
opinion 
which 
he 
has 
imbibed 
with 
his 
milk, 
and 
which 
has 
been 
embraced 
by 
an 
infinite 
number, 
shall 
take 
up 
an 
opinion 
held 
only 
by 
a 
few, 
condemned 
by 
all 
the 
schools, 
and 
really 
regarded 
as 
a 
great 
paradox, 
it 
cannot 
be 
doubted 
that 
he 
must 
have 
been 
induced, 
not 
to 
say 
driven, 
to 
embrace 
it 
by 
the 
most 
cogent 
arguments. 
On 
this 
account 
I 
have 
become 
verycurioustopenetratetothevery 
bottomofthesubject.” 



It 
appears, 
on 
the 
testimony 
of 
Galileo 
himself, 
that 
he 
taught 
the 
Ptolemaic 
system, 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
popular 
feeling, 
after 
he 
had 
convinced 
himself 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
Copernican 
doctrines. 
In 
the 
treatise 
on 
the 
sphere, 
indeed, 
which 
bears 
his 
name, 
and 
which 
must 
have 
been 
written 
soon 
after 
he 
went 
to 
Padua, 
and 
subsequently 
to 
1592, 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
earth, 
and 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
sun, 
are 
supported 
by 
the 
very 
arguments 
which 
Galileo 
afterwards 
ridiculed; 
but 
we 
have 
no 
means 
of 
determining 
whether 
ornothehadthen 
adoptedthetruesystemoftheuniverse. 
Although 
hemight 
have 
taught 
the 
Ptolemaic 
system 
in 
his 
lectures 
after 
he 
had 
convinced 
himself 
of 
its 
falsehood, 
yet 
it 
is 
not 
likely 
that 
he 
would 
go 
so 
far 
as 
to 
publish 
to 
the 
world, 
as 
true, 
the 
very 
doctrines 
which 
he 
despised. 
In 
a 
letter 
to 
Kepler, 
dated 
in 
1597, 
he 
distinctly 
states 
that 
he 
had, 
many 
years 
ago, 
adopted 
the 
opinions 
of 
Copernicus; 
but 
that 
he 
had 
not 
yet 
dared 
to 
publish 
his 
arguments 
in 
favour 
of 
them, 
and 
his 
refutation 
of 
the 
opposite 
opinions. 
These 
facts 
would 
leave 
us 
to 
place 
Galileo’s 
conversion 
somewhere 
between 
1593 
and 
1597, 
although 
many 
years 
cannot 
be 
said 
to 
have 
elapsed 
between 
thesetwo 
dates. 


At 
this 
early 
period 
of 
Galileo’s 
life, 
in 
the 
year 
1593, 
he 
met 
with 
an 
accident 
which 
had 
nearly 
proved 
fatal. 
A 
party 
at 
Padua, 
of 
which 
he 
was 
one, 
were 
enjoying, 
at 
an 
open 
window, 
a 
current 
of 
air, 
which 
was 
artificially 
cooled 
by 
a 
fall 
of 
water. 
Galileo 
unfortunately 
fell 
asleep 
under 
its 
influence; 
and 
so 
powerful 
was 
its 
effect 
upon 
his 
robust 
constitution, 
that 
he 
contracted 
a 
severe 
chronic 
disorder, 
accompanied 
with 
acute 
pains 
in 
his 
body, 
and 
loss 
of 
sleep 
and 
appetite, 
which 
attacked 
him 
at 
intervals 
during 
the 
rest 
of 
his 
life. 
Others 
of 
the 
party 
suffered 
still 
more 
severely, 
and 
perished 
bytheirownrashness. 


Galileo’sreputationwas 
nowwidelyextended 
overEurope. 
TheArchduke 
Ferdinand 
(afterwards 
Emperor 
of 
Germany), 
the 
Landgrave 
of 
Hesse, 
and 
the 
Princes 
of 
Alsace 
and 
Mantua, 
honoured 
his 
lectures 
with 
their 
presence; 
and 
Prince 
Gustavus 
Adolphus 
of 
Sweden 
also 
received 
instructions 
from 
him 
inmathematics,duringhissojourn 
inItaly. 


When 
Galileo 
had 
completed 
the 
first 
period 
of 
his 
engagement 
at 
Padua, 
he 
was 
re-elected 
for 
other 
six 
years, 
with 
an 
increased 
salary 
of 
320 
florins. 
This 
liberal 
addition 
to 
his 
income 
is 
ascribed 
by 
Fabbroni 
to 
the 
malice 
of 
one 
of 
his 
enemies, 
who 
informed 
the 
Senate 
that 
Galileo 
was 
living 
in 
illicit 
intercourse 
with 
Marina 
Gamba. 
Without 
inquiring 
into 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
accusation, 
the 
Senate 
is 
said 
to 
have 
replied, 
that 
if 
“he 
had 
a 
family 
to 



support, 
he 
had 
the 
more 
need 
of 
an 
increased 
salary.” 
It 
is 
more 
likely 
that 
the 
liberality 
of 
the 
republic 
had 
been 
called 
forth 
by 
the 
high 
reputation 
of 
their 
professor, 
and 
that 
the 
terms 
of 
their 
reply 
were 
intended 
only 
to 
rebuke 
the 
malignity 
of 
the 
informer. 
The 
mode 
of 
expression 
would 
seem 
to 
indicate 
that 
one 
or 
more 
of 
Galileo’s 
children 
had 
been 
born 
previous 
to 
his 
re-election 
in 
1598; 
but 
as 
this 
is 
scarcely 
consistent 
with 
other 
facts, 
we 
are 
disposed 
todoubttheauthenticityofFabbroni’sanecdote. 


The 
new 
star 
which 
attracted 
the 
notice 
of 
astronomers 
in 
1604, 
excited 
the 
particular 
attention 
of 
Galileo. 
The 
observations 
which 
he 
made 
upon 
it, 
and 
the 
speculations 
which 
they 
suggested, 
formed 
the 
subject 
of 
three 
lectures, 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
first 
of 
which 
only 
has 
reached 
our 
times. 
From 
the 
absence 
of 
parallax, 
he 
proved 
that 
the 
common 
hypothesis 
of 
its 
being 
a 
meteor 
was 
erroneous, 
and 
that, 
like 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
it 
was 
situated 
far 
beyond 
the 
bounds 
of 
our 
own 
system. 
The 
popularity 
of 
the 
subject 
attracted 
crowds 
to 
his 
lecture-room; 
and 
Galileo 
had 
the 
boldness 
to 
reproach 
his 
hearers 
for 
taking 
so 
deep 
an 
interest 
in 
a 
temporary 
phenomenon, 
while 
they 
overlooked 
thewonders 
ofcreation 
whichweredailypresentedto 
theirview. 


In 
the 
year 
1606, 
Galileo 
was 
again 
appointed 
to 
the 
professorship 
at 
Padua, 
with 
an 
augmented 
stipend 
of 
520 
florins. 
His 
popularity 
had 
now 
risen 
so 
high, 
that 
his 
audience 
could 
not 
be 
accommodated 
in 
his 
lecture-
room; 
and 
even 
when 
he 
had 
assembled 
them 
in 
the 
school 
of 
medicine, 
which 
contained 
1000 
persons, 
he 
was 
frequently 
obliged 
to 
adjourn 
to 
the 
openair. 


Among 
the 
variety 
of 
pursuits 
which 
occupied 
his 
attention, 
was 
the 
examination 
of 
the 
properties 
of 
the 
loadstone. 
In 
1607, 
he 
commenced 
his 
experiments; 
but, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
a 
method 
of 
arming 
loadstones, 
which, 
according 
to 
the 
report 
of 
Sir 
Kenelm 
Digby, 
enabled 
them 
to 
carry 
twiceas 
muchweight 
as 
before, 
he 
doesnot 
seemto 
have 
made 
any 
additions 
to 
our 
knowledge 
of 
magnetism. 
He 
appears 
to 
have 
studied 
with 
care 
the 
admirable 
work 
of 
our 
countryman, 
Dr 
Gilbert, 
“De 
Magnete,” 
which 
was 
published 
in 
1600; 
and 
he 
recognised 
in 
the 
experiments 
and 
reasonings 
of 
the 
English 
philosopher 
the 
principles 
of 
that 
method 
of 
investigating 
truth 
which 
he 
had 
himself 
adopted. 
Gilbert 
died 
in 
1603, 
in 
the 
63d 
year 
of 
his 
age, 
and 
probably 
never 
read 
the 
fine 
compliment 
which 
was 
paid 
to 
him 
by

October 
1610. 


In 
the 
preceding 
chapter 
we 
have 
brought 
down 
the 
history 
of 
Galileo’s 
labours 
to 
that 
auspicious 
year 
in 
which 
he 
first 
directed 
the 
telescope 
to 
the 
heavens. 
No 
sooner 
was 
that 
noble 
instrument 
placed 
in 
his 
hands, 
than 
Providence 
released 
him 
from 
his 
professional 
toils, 
and 
supplied 
him 
with 
the 
fullest 
leisure 
and 
the 
amplest 
means 
for 
pursuing 
and 
completing 
the 
grandest 
discoveries. 


Although 
he 
had 
quitted 
the 
service 
and 
the 
domains 
of 
his 
munificent 
patron, 
the 
Grand 
Duke 
of 
Tuscany, 
yet 
he 
maintained 
his 
connection 
with 
the 
family, 
by 
visiting 
Florence 
during 
his 
academic 
vacations, 
and 
giving 
mathematical 
instruction 
to 
the 
younger 
branches 
of 
that 
distinguished 
house. 
Cosmo, 
who 
had 
been 
one 
of 
his 
pupils, 
now 
succeeded 
his 
father 
Ferdinand; 
and 
having 
his 
mind 
early 
imbued 
with 
a 
love 
of 
knowledge, 
which 
had 
become 
hereditary 
in 
his 
family, 
he 
felt 
that 
the 
residence 
of 
Galileo 
within 
his 
dominions, 
and 
still 
more 
his 
introduction 
into 
his 
household, 
would 
do 
honour 
to 
their 
common 
country, 
and 
reflect 
a 
lustre 
upon 
his 
own 
name. 
In 
the 
year 
1609, 
accordingly, 
Cosmo 
made 
proposals 
to 
Galileo 
to 
return 
to 
his 
original 
situation 
at 
Pisa. 
These 
overtures 
were 
gratefully 
received; 
and 
in 
the 
arrangements 
which 
Galileo 
on 
this 
occasion 
suggested, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
they 
were 
urged, 
we 
obtain 
some 
insight 
into 
his 
temper 
and 
character. 
He 
informs 
the 
correspondent 
through 
whom 
Cosmo’s 
offer 
was 
conveyed, 
that 
his 
salary 
of 
520 
florins 
at 
Padua 
would 
be 
increased 
to 
as 
many 
crowns 
at 
his 
re-election, 
and 
that 
he 
could 
enlarge 
his 
income 
to 
any 
extent 
he 
pleased, 
by 
giving 
private 
lectures 
and 
receiving 
pupils. 
His 
public 
duties, 
he 
stated, 
occupied 
him 
only 
sixty 
half-hours 
in 
the 
year; 
but 
his 
studies 
suffered 
such 
interruptions 
from 
his 
domestic 
pupils 
and 
private 



lectures, 
that 
his 
most 
ardent 
wish 
was 
to 
be 
relieved 
from 
them, 
in 
order 
that 
he 
might 
have 
sufficient 
rest 
and 
leisure, 
before 
the 
close 
of 
his 
life, 
to 
finish 
and 
publish 
those 
great 
works 
which 
he 
had 
projected. 
In 
the 
event, 
therefore, 
of 
his 
returning 
to 
Pisa, 
he 
hoped 
that 
it 
would 
be 
the 
first 
objectof 
his 
serene 
highness 
to 
give 
him 
leisure 
to 
complete 
his 
works 
without 
the 
drudgery 
of 
lecturing. 
He 
expresses 
his 
anxiety 
to 
gain 
his 
bread 
by 
his 
writings, 
and 
he 
promises 
to 
dedicate 
them 
to 
his 
serene 
master. 
He 
enumerates, 
among 
these 
books, 
two 
on 
the 
system 
of 
the 
universe, 
three 
on 
local 
motion, 
three 
books 
of 
mechanics, 
two 
on 
the 
demonstration 
of 
principles, 
and 
one 
of 
problems; 
besides 
treatises 
on 
sound 
and 
speech, 
on 
light 
and 
colours, 
on 
the 
tides, 
on 
the 
composition 
of 
continuous 
quantity, 
on 
the 
motions 
of 
animals, 
and 
on 
the 
military 
art. 
On 
the 
subject 
of 
his 
salary, 
he 
makes 
the 
following 
curious 
observations: 
— 


“I 
say 
nothing,” 
says 
he, 
“on 
the 
amount 
of 
my 
salary; 
being 
convinced 
that, 
as 
I 
am 
to 
live 
upon 
it, 
the 
graciousness 
of 
his 
highness 
would 
not 
deprive 
me 
of 
any 
of 
those 
comforts, 
of 
which, 
however, 
I 
feel 
the 
want 
of 
less 
than 
many 
others; 
and, 
therefore, 
I 
say 
nothing 
more 
on 
the 
subject. 
Finally, 
on 
the 
title 
and 
profession 
of 
my 
service, 
I 
should 
wish 
that, 
to 
the 
title 
of 
mathematician, 
his 
highness 
would 
add 
that 
of 
philosopher, 
as 
I 
profess 
to 
have 
studied 
a 
greater 
number 
of 
years 
in 
philosophy, 
than 
months 
in 
pure 
mathematics; 
and 
how 
I 
have 
profited 
by 
it, 
and 
if 
I 
can 
or 
ought 
to 
deserve 
this 
title, 
I 
may 
let 
their 
highnesses 
see, 
as 
often 
as 
it 
shall 
please 
them 
to 
give 
me 
an 
opportunity 
of 
discussing 
such 
subjects 
in 
their 
presence 
withthosewhoare 
mostesteemedinthisknowledge.” 


During 
the 
progress 
of 
this 
negotiation, 
Galileo 
went 
to 
Venice, 
on 
a 
visit 
to 
a 
friend, 
in 
the 
month 
of 
April 
or 
May 
1609. 
Here 
he 
learned, 
from 
common 
rumour, 
that 
aDutchman 
had 
presented 
to 
prince 
Maurice 
of 
Nassau 
an 
optical 
instrument, 
which 
possessed 
the 
singular 
property 
of 
causing 
distant 
objects 
to 
appear 
nearer 
the 
observer. 
This 
Dutchman 
was 
Hans 
or 
John 
Lippershey, 
who, 
as 
has 
been 
clearly 
proved 
by 
the 
late 
Professor 
Moll 
of 
Utrecht, 
was 
in 
the 
possession 
of 
a 
telescope 
made 
by 
himself 
so 
early 
as 
2d 
October 
1608. 
A 
few 
days 
afterwards, 
the 
truth 
of 
this 
report 
was 
confirmed 
by 
a 
letter 
which 
Galileo 
received 
from 
James 
Badorere 
at 
Paris, 
and 
he 
immediately 
applied 
himself 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
subject. 
On 
the 
first 
night 
after 
his 
return 
to 
Padua, 
he 
found, 
in 
the 
doctrines 
of 
refraction, 
the 
principle 
which 
he 
sought. 
He 
placed 
at 
the 
ends 
of 
a 
leaden 
tube 
two 
spectacle 
glasses, 
both 
of 
which 
were 
plain 
on 
one 
side, 
while 
one 



of 
them 
had 
its 
other 
side 
convex, 
and 
the 
other 
its 
second 
side 
concave, 
and 
having 
applied 
his 
eye 
to 
the 
concave 
glass, 
he 
saw 
objects 
pretty 
large 
and 
pretty 
near 
him. 
This 
little 
instrument, 
which 
magnified 
only 
three 
times, 
he 
carried 
in 
triumph 
to 
Venice, 
where 
it 
excited 
the 
most 
intense 
interest. 
Crowds 
of 
the 
principal 
citizens 
flocked 
to 
his 
house 
to 
see 
the 
magical 
toy; 
and 
after 
nearly 
a 
month 
had 
been 
spent 
in 
gratifying 
this 
epidemical 
curiosity, 
Galileo 
was 
led 
to 
understand 
from 
Leonardo 
Deodati, 
the 
Doge 
of 
Venice, 
that 
the 
senate 
would 
be 
highly 
gratified 
by 
obtaining 
possession 
of 
so 
extraordinary 
an 
instrument. 
Galileo 
instantly 
complied 
with 
the 
wishes 
of 
his 
patrons, 
who 
acknowledged 
the 
present 
by 
a 
mandate 
conferring 
upon 
him 
for 
life 
his 
professorship 
at 
Padua, 
and 
generously 
raising 
his 
salary 
from 
520 
to1000florins. 


Although 
we 
cannot 
doubt 
the 
veracity 
of 
Galileo, 
when 
he 
affirms 
that 
he 
had 
never 
seen 
any 
of 
the 
Dutch 
telescopes, 
yet 
it 
is 
expressly 
stated 
by 
Fuccarius, 
that 
one 
of 
these 
instruments 
had 
at 
this 
time 
been 
brought 
to 
Florence; 
and 
Sirturus 
assures 
us 
that 
a 
Frenchman, 
calling 
himself 
a 
partner 
of 
the 
Dutch 
inventor, 
came 
to 
Milan 
in 
May 
1609, 
and 
offered 
a 
telescope 
to 
the 
Count 
de 
Fuentes. 
In 
a 
letter 
from 
Lorenzo 
Pignoria 
to 
Paolo 
Gualdo, 
dated 
from 
Padua, 
on 
the 
31st 
of 
August 
1609, 
it 
is 
expressly 
said, 
that, 
at 
the 
re-election 
of 
the 
professors, 
Galileo 
had 
contrived 
to 
obtain 
1000 
florins 
for 
life, 
which 
was 
alleged 
to 
be 
on 
account 
of 
an 
eye-glass 
like 
the 
one 
which 
was 
sentfromFlanders 
totheCardinalBorghese. 


In 
a 
memoir 
so 
brief 
and 
general 
as 
the 
present, 
it 
would 
be 
out 
of 
place 
to 
discuss 
the 
history 
of 
this 
extraordinary 
invention. 
We 
have 
no 
hesitation 
in 
asserting 
that 
a 
method 
of 
magnifying 
distant 
objects 
was 
known 
to 
Baptista 
Porta 
and 
others; 
but 
it 
seems 
to 
be 
equally 
certain 
that 
an 
instrument 
for 
producing 
these 
effects 
was 
first 
constructed 
in 
Holland, 
and 
that 
it 
was 
from 
that 
kingdom 
that 
Galileo 
derived 
the 
knowledge 
of 
its 
existence. 
In 
considering 
the 
contending 
claims, 
which 
have 
been 
urged 
with 
all 
the 
ardour 
and 
partiality 
of 
national 
feeling, 
it 
has 
been 
generally 
overlooked, 
that 
a 
single 
convex 
lens, 
whose 
focal 
length 
exceeds 
the 
distance 
at 
which 
we 
examine 
minute 
objects, 
performs 
the 
part 
of 
a 
telescope, 
when 
an 
eye, 
placed 
behind 
it, 
sees 
distinctly 
the 
inverted 
image 
which 
it 
forms. 
A 
lens, 
twenty 
feet 
in 
focal 
length, 
will 
in 
this 
manner 
magnify 
twenty 
times; 
and 
it 
was 
by 
the 
same 
principle 
that 
Sir 
William 
Herschel 
discovered 
a 
new 
satellite 
of 
Saturn, 
by 
using 
only 
the 
mirror 
of 
his 
forty-feet 
telescope. 
The 
instrument 
presented 
to 
Prince 
Maurice, 
and 
which 
the 
Marquis 
Spinola 



found 
in 
the 
shop 
of 
John 
Lippershey, 
the 
spectacle 
maker 
of 
Middleburg, 
must 
have 
been 
an 
astronomical 
telescope 
consisting 
of 
two 
convex 
lenses. 
Upon 
this 
supposition, 
it 
differed 
from 
that 
which 
Galileo 
constructed; 
and 
the 
Italian 
philosopher 
will 
be 
justly 
entitled 
to 
the 
honour 
of 
having 
invented 
that 
form 
ofthe 
telescopewhichstillbears 
his 
name, 
while 
wemust 
accord 
to 
the 
Dutch 
optician 
the 
honour 
of 
having 
previously 
invented 
the 
astronomical 
telescope. 


Theinterestwhichtheexhibitionofthetelescopeexcitedat 
Venice 
didnot 
soon 
subside: 
Sirturi 
describes 
it 
as 
amounting 
almost 
to 
phrensy. 
When 
he 
himself 
had 
succeeded 
in 
making 
one 
of 
these 
instruments, 
he 
ascended 
the 
tower 
of 
St 
Mark, 
where 
he 
might 
use 
it 
without 
molestation. 
He 
was 
recognised, 
however, 
by 
a 
crowd 
in 
the 
street; 
and 
such 
was 
the 
eagerness 
of 
their 
curiosity, 
that 
they 
took 
possession 
of 
the 
wondrous 
tube, 
and 
detained 
the 
impatient 
philosopher 
for 
several 
hours, 
till 
they 
had 
successively 
witnessed 
its 
effects. 
Desirous 
of 
obtaining 
the 
same 
gratification 
for 
their 
friends, 
they 
endeavoured 
to 
learn 
the 
name 
of 
the 
inn 
at 
which 
he 
lodged; 
but 
Sirturi 
fortunately 
overheard 
their 
inquiries, 
and 
quitted 
Venice 
early 
next 
morning, 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
a 
second 
visitation 
of 
this 
new 
school 
of 
philosophers. 
The 
opticians 
speedily 
availed 
themselves 
of 
the 
new 
instrument. 
Galileo’s 
tube, 
— 
or 
the 
double 
eye-glass, 
or 
the 
cylinder, 
or 
the 
trunk, 
as 
it 
was 
then 
called, 
for 
Demisiano 
had 
not 
yet 
given 
it 
the 
appellation 
of 
telescope, 
— 
was 
manufactured 
in 
great 
quantities, 
and 
in 
a 
very 
superior 
manner. 
The 
instruments 
were 
purchased 
merely 
as 
philosophical 
toys, 
and 
werecarriedbytravellersintoevery 
cornerofEurope. 


The 
art 
of 
grinding 
and 
polishing 
lenses 
was 
at 
this 
time 
very 
imperfect. 
Galileo, 
and 
those 
whom 
he 
instructed, 
were 
alone 
capable 
of 
making 
tolerable 
instruments. 
It 
appears, 
from 
the 
testimony 
of 
Gassendi 
and 
Gærtner, 
that, 
in 
1634, 
a 
good 
telescope 
could 
not 
be 
procured 
in 
Paris, 
Venice, 
or 
Amsterdam; 
and 
that, 
even 
in 
1637, 
there 
was 
not 
one 
in 
Holland 
which 
could 
shew 
Jupiter’sdisc 
welldefined. 


After 
Galileo 
had 
completed 
his 
first 
instrument, 
which 
magnified 
only 
three 
times, 
he 
executed 
a 
larger 
and 
a 
better 
one, 
with 
a 
power 
of 
about 
eight. 
“At 
length,” 
as 
he 
himself 
remarks, 
“sparing 
neither 
labour 
nor 
expense,” 
he 
constructed 
an 
instrument 
so 
excellent, 
that 
it 
bore 
a 
magnifying 
power 
ofmorethan 
thirty 
times. 


The 
first 
celestial 
object 
to 
which 
Galileo 
applied 
his 
telescope 
was 
the 
moon, 
which, 
to 
use 
his 
own 
words, 
appeared 
as 
near 
as 
if 
it 
had 
been 
distant 



only 
two 
semidiameters 
of 
the 
earth. 
He 
then 
directed 
it 
to 
the 
planets 
and 
the 
fixedstars,whichhefrequentlyobservedwith 
“incredibledelight.” 


The 
observations 
which 
he 
made 
upon 
the 
moon 
possessed 
a 
high 
degree 
of 
interest. 
The 
general 
resemblance 
of 
its 
surface 
to 
that 
of 
our 
own 
globe 
naturally 
fixed 
his 
attention; 
and 
he 
was 
soon 
able 
to 
trace, 
in 
almost 
every 
part 
of 
the 
lunar 
disc, 
ranges 
of 
mountains, 
deep 
hollows, 
and 
other 
inequalities, 
which 
reverberated 
from 
their 
summits 
and 
margins 
the 
rays 
of 
the 
rising 
sun, 
while 
the 
intervening 
hollows 
were 
still 
buried 
in 
darkness. 
The 
dark 
and 
luminous 
spaces 
he 
regarded 
as 
indicating 
seas 
and 
continents, 
which 
reflected, 
in 
different 
degrees, 
the 
incidental 
light 
of 
the 
sun; 
and 
he 
ascribed 
the 
phosphorescence, 
as 
it 
has 
been 
improperly 
called, 
or 
the 
secondary 
light, 
which 
is 
seen 
on 
the 
dark 
limb 
of 
the 
moon 
in 
her 
first 
and 
lastquarters, 
tothereflectionofthesun’slightfrom 
theearth. 


These 
discoveries 
were 
ill 
received 
by 
the 
followers 
of 
Aristotle. 
According 
to 
their 
preconceived 
opinions, 
the 
moon 
was 
perfectly 
spherical, 
and 
absolutely 
smooth; 
and 
to 
cover 
it 
with 
mountains, 
and 
scoop 
it 
out 
into 
valleys, 
was 
an 
act 
of 
impiety 
which 
defaced 
the 
regular 
forms 
which 
Nature 
herself 
had 
imprinted. 
It 
was 
in 
vain 
that 
Galileo 
appealed 
to 
the 
evidence 
of 
observation, 
and 
to 
the 
actual 
surface 
of 
our 
own 
globe. 
The 
very 
irregularities 
on 
the 
moon 
were, 
in 
his 
opinion, 
the 
proof 
of 
divine 
wisdom; 
and 
had 
its 
surface 
been 
absolutely 
smooth, 
it 
would 
have 
been 
“but 
a 
vast 
unblessed 
desert, 
void 
of 
animals, 
of 
plants, 
of 
cities, 
and 
of 
men 
— 
the 
abode 
of 
silence 
and 
inaction 
— 
senseless, 
lifeless, 
soulless, 
and 
stripped 
of 
allthoseornamentswhichnowrenderitsovariedandsobeautiful.” 


In 
examining 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
and 
comparing 
them 
with 
the 
planets, 
Galileo 
observed 
a 
remarkable 
difference 
in 
the 
appearance 
of 
their 
discs. 
All 
the 
planets 
appeared 
with 
round 
globular 
discs 
like 
the 
moon; 
whereas 
the 
fixed 
stars 
never 
exhibited 
any 
disc 
at 
all, 
but 
resembled 
lucid 
points 
sending 
forth 
twinklingrays. 
Starsofallmagnitudes 
hefound 
tohavethesameappearance; 
those 
of 
the 
fifth 
and 
sixth 
magnitude 
having 
the 
same 
character, 
when 
seen 
through 
a 
telescope, 
as 
Sirius, 
the 
largest 
of 
the 
stars, 
when 
seen 
by 
the 
naked 
eye. 
Upon 
directing 
his 
telescope 
to 
nebulæ 
and 
clusters 
of 
stars, 
he 
was 
delightedto 
findthattheyconsistedof 
great 
numbersof 
starswhich 
couldnot 
be 
recognised 
by 
unassisted 
vision. 
He 
counted 
no 
fewer 
than 
forty 
in 
the 
cluster 
called 
the 
Pleiades, 
or 
Seven 
Stars; 
and 
he 
has 
given 
us 
drawings 
of 
this 
constellation, 
as 
well 
as 
of 
the 
belt 
and 
sword 
of 
Orion, 
and 
of 
the 
nebula 
of 
Præsepe. 
In 
the 
great 
nebula 
of 
the 
Milky 
Way, 
he 
descried 
crowds 
of 



minute 
stars; 
and 
he 
concluded 
that 
this 
singular 
portion 
of 
the 
heavens 
derived 
its 
whiteness 
from 
still 
smaller 
stars, 
which 
his 
telescope 
was 
unable 
toseparate. 


Important 
and 
interesting 
as 
these 
discoveries 
were, 
they 
were 
thrown 
into 
the 
shade 
by 
those 
to 
which 
he 
was 
led 
during 
an 
accurate 
examination 
of 
the 
planets 
with 
a 
more 
powerful 
telescope. 
On 
the 
7th 
of 
January 
1610, 
at 
one 
o’clockinthe 
morning,when 
hedirected 
his 
telescope 
to 
Jupiter, 
he 
observed 
three 
stars 
near 
the 
body 
of 
the 
planet, 
two 
being 
to 
the 
east 
and 
one 
to 
the 
west 
of 
him. 
They 
were 
all 
in 
a 
straight 
line, 
and 
parallel 
to 
the 
ecliptic, 
and 
appeared 
brighter 
than 
other 
stars 
of 
the 
same 
magnitude. 
Believing 
them 
to 
be 
fixed 
stars, 
he 
paid 
no 
great 
attention 
to 
their 
distances 
from 
Jupiter 
and 
from 
one 
another. 
On 
the 
8th 
of 
January, 
however, 
when, 
from 
some 
cause 
or 
other, 
he 
had 
been 
led 
to 
observe 
the 
stars 
again, 
he 
found 
a 
very 
different 
arrangement 
of 
them: 
all 
the 
three 
were 
on 
the 
west 
side 
of 
Jupiter, 
nearer 
one 
another 
than 
before, 
and 
almost 
at 
equal 
distances. 
Though 
he 
had 
not 
turned 
his 
attention 
to 
the 
extraordinary 
fact 
of 
the 
mutual 
approach 
of 
the 
stars, 
yet 
he 
began 
to 
consider 
how 
Jupiter 
could 
be 
found 
to 
the 
east 
of 
the 
three 
stars, 
when 
but 
the 
day 
before 
he 
had 
been 
to 
the 
west 
of 
two 
of 
them. 
The 
only 
explanation 
which 
he 
could 
give 
of 
this 
fact 
was, 
that 
the 
motion 
of 
Jupiter 
was 
direct, 
contrary 
to 
astronomical 
calculations, 
and 
that 
he 
had 
got 
beforethesetwostarsby 
his 
ownmotion. 


In 
this 
dilemma 
between 
the 
testimony 
of 
his 
senses 
and 
the 
results 
of 
calculation, 
he 
waited 
for 
the 
following 
night 
with 
the 
utmost 
anxiety; 
but 
his 
hopes 
were 
disappointed, 
for 
the 
heavens 
were 
wholly 
veiled 
in 
clouds. 
On 
the 
10th, 
two 
only 
of 
the 
stars 
appeared, 
and 
both 
on 
the 
east 
of 
the 
planet. 
As 
it 
was 
obviously 
impossible 
that 
Jupiter 
could 
have 
advanced 
from 
west 
to 
east 
on 
the 
8th 
of 
January, 
and 
from 
east 
to 
west 
on 
the 
10th, 
Galileo 
was 
forced 
to 
conclude 
that 
the 
phenomenon 
which 
he 
had 
observed 
arose 
from 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
stars, 
and 
he 
set 
himself 
to 
observe 
diligently 
their 
change 
of 
place. 
On 
the 
11th, 
there 
were 
still 
only 
two 
stars, 
and 
both 
to 
the 
east 
of 
Jupiter; 
but 
the 
more 
eastern 
star 
was 
now 
twice 
as 
large 
as 
the 
other 
one, 
though 
on 
the 
preceding 
night 
they 
had 
been 
perfectly 
equal. 
This 
fact 
threw 
a 
new 
light 
upon 
Galileo’s 
difficulties, 
and 
he 
immediately 
drew 
the 
conclusion, 
which 
he 
considered 
to 
be 
indubitable, 
“that 
there 
were 
in 
the 
heavens 
three 
stars 
which 
revolved 
round 
Jupiter, 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
Venus 
and 
Mercury 
revolve 
round 
the 
sun.” 
On 
the 
12th 
of 
January, 
he 
again 
observed 
them 
in 
new 
positions, 
and 
of 
different 
magnitudes; 
and, 
on 
the 



13th, 
he 
discovered 
a 
fourth 
star, 
which 
completed 
the 
four 
secondaryplanets 
withwhichJupiterissurrounded. 


Galileo 
continued 
his 
observations 
on 
these 
bodies 
every 
clear 
night 
till 
the 
22d 
of 
March, 
and 
studied 
their 
motions 
in 
reference 
to 
fixed 
stars 
that 
were 
at 
the 
same 
time 
within 
the 
field 
of 
his 
telescope. 
Having 
thus 
clearly 
established 
that 
the 
four 
new 
stars 
were 
satellites 
or 
moons, 
which 
revolved 
round 
Jupiter 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
the 
moon 
revolves 
round 
our 
own 
globe, 
he 
drew 
up 
an 
account 
of 
his 
discovery, 
in 
which 
he 
gave 
to 
the 
four 
new 
bodies 
the 
names 
of 
the 
Medicean 
Stars, 
in 
honour 
of 
his 
patron, 
Cosmo 
de 
Medici, 
Grand 
Duke 
of 
Tuscany. 
This 
work, 
under 
the 
title 
of 
“Nuncius 
Sidereus,” 
or 
the 
“Sidereal 
Messenger,” 
was 
dedicated 
to 
the 
same 
prince; 
and 
the 
dedication 
bears 
the 
date 
of 
the 
24th 
of 
March, 
only 
two 
days 
after 
he 
concludedhisobservations. 


The 
importance 
of 
this 
great 
discovery 
was 
instantly 
felt 
by 
the 
enemies 
as 
well 
as 
by 
the 
friends 
of 
the 
Copernican 
system. 
The 
planets 
had 
hitherto 
been 
distinguished 
from 
the 
fixed 
stars 
only 
by 
their 
relative 
change 
of 
place, 
but 
the 
telescope 
proved 
them 
to 
be 
bodies 
so 
near 
to 
our 
own 
globe 
as 
to 
exhibit 
well-defined 
discs, 
while 
the 
fixed 
stars 
retained, 
even 
when 
magnified, 
the 
minuteness 
of 
remote 
and 
lucid 
points. 
The 
system 
of 
Jupiter, 
illuminated 
by 
four 
moons 
performing 
their 
revolutions 
in 
different 
and 
regular 
periods, 
exhibited 
to 
the 
proud 
reason 
of 
man 
the 
comparative 
insignificance 
of 
the 
globe 
he 
inhabits, 
and 
proclaimed 
in 
impressive 
languagethatthatglobewasnotthe 
centreoftheuniverse. 


The 
reception 
which 
these 
discoveries 
met 
with 
from 
Kepler 
is 
highly 
interesting, 
and 
characteristic 
of 
the 
genius 
of 
that 
great 
man. 
He 
was 
one 
day 
sitting 
idle, 
and 
thinking 
of 
Galileo, 
when 
his 
friend 
Wachenfels 
stopped 
his 
carriage 
at 
his 
door, 
to 
communicate 
to 
him 
the 
intelligence. 
“Such 
a 
fit 
of 
wonder,” 
says 
he, 
“seized 
me 
at 
a 
report 
which 
seemed 
to 
be 
so 
very 
absurd, 
and 
I 
was 
thrown 
into 
such 
agitation 
at 
seeing 
an 
old 
dispute 
between 
us 
decided 
in 
this 
way, 
that 
between 
his 
joy, 
my 
colouring, 
and 
the 
laughter 
of 
both, 
confounded 
as 
we 
were 
by 
such 
a 
novelty, 
we 
were 
hardly 
capable, 
he 
of 
speaking, 
or 
I 
of 
listening. 
On 
our 
parting, 
I 
immediately 
began 
to 
think 
how 
there 
could 
be 
any 
addition 
to 
the 
number 
of 
the 
planets 
without 
overturning 
my 
‘Cosmographic 
Mystery,’ 
according 
to 
which 
Euclid’s 
five 
regular 
solids 
do 
not 
allow 
more 
than 
six 
planets 
round 
the 
sun.... 
I 
am 
so 
far 
from 
disbelieving 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
four 
circumjovial 
planets, 
that 
I 
long 
for 
a 
telescope, 
to 
anticipate 
you, 
if 
possible, 
in 
discovering 
two 
round 
Mars, 



as 
the 
proportion 
seems 
to 
require, 
six 
or 
eight 
round 
Saturn, 
and 
perhaps 
one 
eachroundMercury 
andVenus.” 


In 
a 
very 
different 
spirit 
did 
the 
Aristotelians 
receive 
the 
“Sidereal 
Messenger” 
of 
Galileo. 
The 
principal 
professor 
of 
philosophy 
at 
Padua 
resisted 
Galileo’s 
repeated 
and 
urgent 
entreaties 
to 
look 
at 
the 
moon 
and 
planets 
through 
his 
telescope; 
and 
he 
even 
laboured 
to 
convince 
the 
Grand 
Duke 
that 
the 
satellites 
of 
Jupiter 
could 
not 
possibly 
exist. 
Sizzi, 
an 
astronomer 
of 
Florence, 
maintained 
that 
as 
there 
were 
only 
seven 
apertures 
in 
the 
head 
— 
two 
eyes, 
two 
ears, 
two 
nostrils, 
and 
one 
mouth 
— 
and 
as 
there 
were 
only 
seven 
metals, 
and 
seven 
days 
in 
the 
week, 
so 
there 
could 
be 
only 
seven 
planets. 
He 
seems, 
however, 
to 
have 
admitted 
the 
visibility 
of 
the 
four 
satellites 
through 
the 
telescope; 
but 
he 
argues, 
that 
as 
they 
are 
invisible 
to 
the 
naked 
eye, 
they 
can 
exercise 
no 
influence 
on 
the 
earth; 
and 
being 
useless, 
theydo 
not 
therefore 
exist. 


A 
protegé 
of 
Kepler’s, 
of 
the 
name 
of 
Horky, 
wrote 
a 
volume 
against 
Galileo’s 
discovery, 
after 
having 
declared, 
“that 
he 
would 
never 
concede 
his 
four 
new 
planets 
to 
that 
Italian 
from 
Padua, 
even 
if 
he 
should 
die 
for 
it.” 
This 
resolute 
Aristotelian 
was 
at 
no 
loss 
for 
arguments. 
He 
asserted 
that 
he 
had 
examined 
the 
heavens 
through 
Galileo’s 
own 
glass, 
and 
that 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
a 
satellite 
existed 
round 
Jupiter. 
He 
affirmed, 
that 
he 
did 
not 
more 
surely 
know 
that 
he 
had 
a 
soul 
in 
his 
body, 
than 
that 
reflected 
rays 
are 
the 
sole 
cause 
of 
Galileo’s 
erroneous 
observations; 
and 
that 
the 
only 
use 
of 
the 
new 
planets 
was 
to 
gratify 
Galileo’s 
thirst 
for 
gold, 
and 
afford 
to 
himself 
a 
subject 
of 
discussion. 


When 
Horky 
first 
presented 
himself 
to 
Kepler, 
after 
the 
publication 
of 
this 
work, 
the 
opinion 
of 
his 
patron 
was 
announced 
to 
him 
by 
a 
burst 
of 
indignation 
which 
overwhelmed 
the 
astonished 
author. 
Horky 
supplicated 
mercy 
for 
his 
offence; 
and, 
as 
Kepler 
himself 
informed 
Galileo, 
he 
took 
him 
again 
into 
favour, 
on 
the 
condition 
that 
Kepler 
was 
to 
show 
him 
Jupiter’s 
satellites, 
and 
that 
Horky 
was 
not 
only 
to 
see 
them, 
but 
to 
admit 
their 
existence. 


When 
the 
spirit 
of 
philosophy 
had 
thus 
left 
the 
individuals 
who 
bore 
so 
unworthily 
her 
sacred 
name, 
it 
was 
fortunate 
for 
science 
that 
it 
found 
a 
refuge 
among 
princes. 
Notwithstanding 
the 
reiterated 
logic 
of 
his 
philosophical 
professor 
at 
Padua, 
Cosmo 
de 
Medici 
preferred 
the 
testimony 
of 
his 
senses 
to 
the 
syllogisms 
of 
his 
instructor. 
He 
observed 
the 
new 
planets 
several 
times, 
along 
with 
Galileo, 
at 
Pisa; 
and 
when 
he 
parted 
with 
him, 
he 
gave 
him 
a 



present 
worth 
more 
than 
1000 
florins, 
and 
concluded 
that 
liberal 
arrangement 
towhichwehavealreadyreferred. 


As 
philosopher 
and 
principal 
mathematician 
to 
the 
Grand 
Duke 
of 
Tuscany,Galileonowtook

No 
official 
duties, 
excepting 
that 
of 
lecturing 
occasionally 
to 
sovereign 
princes, 
were 
attached 
to 
this 
appointment; 
and 
it 
was 
expressly 
stipulated 
that 
he 
should 
enjoy 
the 
most 
perfect 
leisure 
to 
complete 
his 
treatises 
on 
the 
constitution 
of 
the 
universe, 
on 
mechanics, 
and 
on 
local 
motion. 
Theresignationofhisprofessorshipinthe 
university 
ofPadua,which 
was 
the 
necessary 
consequence 
of 
his 
new 
appointment, 
created 
much 
dissatisfaction: 
but 
though 
many 
of 
his 
former 
friends 
refused 
at 
first 
to 
hold 
any 
communication 
with 
him, 
this 
excitement 
gradually 
subsided; 
and 
the 
Venetian 
senate 
at 
last 
appreciated 
the 
feelings, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
motives, 
which 
induceda

While 
Galileo 
was 
enjoying 
the 
reward 
and 
the 
fame 
of 
his 
great 
discovery, 
a 
new 
species 
of 
enmity 
was 
roused 
against 
him. 
Simon 
Mayer, 
an 
astronomer 
of 
no 
character, 
pretended 
that 
he 
had 
discovered 
the 
satellites 
of 
Jupiter 
before 
Galileo, 
and 
that 
his 
first 
observation 
was 
made 
on 
the 
29th 
of 
December, 
1609. 
Other 
astronomers 
announced 
the 
discovery 
of 
new 
satellites: 
Scheiner 
reckoned 
five, 
Rheita 
nine, 
and 
others 
found 
even 
so 
many 
as 
twelve: 
these 
satellites, 
however, 
were 
found 
to 
be 
only 
fixed 
stars. 
The 
names 
of 
Vladislavian, 
Agrippine, 
Uranodavian, 
and 
Ferdinandotertian, 
which 
were 
hastily 
given 
to 
these 
common 
telescopic 
stars, 
soon 
disappeared 
from 
the 
page 
of 
science, 
and 
even 
the 
splendid 
telescopes 
of 
modern 
times 
havenotbeenable

A 
modern 
astronomer 
of 
no 
mean 
celebrity 
has, 
even 
in 
the 
present 
day, 
endeavoured 
to 
rob 
Galileo 
of 
this 
staple 
article 
of 
his 
reputation. 
From 
a 
careless 
examination 
of 
the 
papers 
of 
our 
celebrated 
countryman, 
Thomas 
Harriot, 
which 
Baron 
Zach 
had 
made 
in 
1784, 
at 
Petworth, 
the 
seat 
of 
Lord 
Egremont, 
this 
astronomer 
has 
asserted 
that 
Harriot 
first 
observed 
the 
satellites 
of 
Jupiter 
on 
the 
16th 
of 
January, 
1610; 
and 
continued 
his 
observations 
till 
the 
25th 
of 
February, 
1612. 
Baron 
Zach 
adds 
the 
following 
extraordinary 
conclusion:— 
“Galileo 
pretends 
to 
have 
discovered 
them 
on 
the7thofJanuary,1610;so 
thatitisnotimprobable 
thatHarriotwas 
likewise 
the 
first 
discoverer 
of 
these 
attendants 
of 
Jupiter.” 
In 
a 
communication 
which 
I 
received 
from 
Dr 
Robertson, 
of 
Oxford, 
in 
1822, 
he 
informed 
me 
that 
he 
had 
examined 
a 
portion 
of 
Harriot’s 
papers, 
entitled, 
“De 
Jovialibus 



Planetis;” 
and 
that 
it 
appears, 
from 
two 
pages 
of 
these 
papers, 
that 
Harriot 
first 
observed 
Jupiter’s 
satellites 
on 
the 
17th 
of 
October, 
1610. 
These 
observations 
are 
accompanied 
with 
rough 
drawings 
of 
the 
positions 
of 
the 
satellites, 
and 
rough 
calculations 
of 
their 
periodical 
revolutions. 
My 
friend, 
Professor 
Rigaud, 
who 
has 
very 
recently 
examined 
the 
Harriot 
MSS., 
has 
confirmed 
the 
accuracy 
of 
Dr 
Robertson’s 
observations, 
and 
has 
thus 
restored 
to 
Galileo 
the 
honour 
of 
being 
the 
first 
and 
the 
sole 
discoverer 
of 
these 
secondaryplanets.

of 
Salviati 
— 
Composes 
his 
work 
on 
Floating 
Bodies, 
which 
involves 
him 
in 
new 
controversies. 


The 
great 
success 
which 
attended 
the 
first 
telescopic 
observations 
of 
Galileo, 
induced 
him 
to 
apply 
his 
best 
instruments 
to 
the 
other 
planets 
of 
our 
system. 
The 
attempts 
which 
had 
been 
made 
to 
deprive 
him 
of 
the 
honour 
of 
some 
of 
his 
discoveries, 
combined, 
probably, 
with 
a 
desire 
to 
repeat 
his 
observations 
with 
better 
telescopes, 
led 
him 
to 
announce 
his 
discoveries 
under 
the 
veil 
of 
an 
enigma, 
and 
to 
invite 
astronomers 
to 
declare, 
within 
a 
giventime,iftheyhadobservedanynew 
phenomenaintheheavens. 


Before 
the 
close 
of 
1610, 
Galileo 
excited 
the 
curiosity 
of 
astronomers 
by 
the 
publication 
of 
his 
first 
enigma. 
Kepler 
and 
others 
tried 
in 
vain 
to 
decipher 
it; 
but 
in 
consequence 
of 
the 
Emperor 
Rodolph 
requesting 
a 
solution 
of 
the 
puzzle, 
Galileosenthim 
thefollowing 
clue: 
— 


“Altissimamplanetamtergeminamobservavi.” 


Ihaveobservedthatthemostremoteplanetistriple. 


In 
explaining 
more 
fully 
the 
nature 
of 
his 
observation, 
Galileo 
remarked 
that 
Saturn 
was 
not 
a 
single 
star, 
but 
three 
together, 
nearly 
touching 
one 
another. 
He 
described 
them 
as 
having 
no 
relative 
motion, 
and 
as 
having 
the 
form 
of 
three 
o’s, 
namely, 
oOo, 
the 
central 
one 
being 
larger 
than 
those 
on 
eachside 
ofit. 


Although 
Galileo 
had 
announced 
that 
nothing 
new 
appeared 
in 
the 
other 
planets, 
yet 
he 
soon 
communicated 
to 
the 
world 
another 
discovery 
of 
no 
slight 
interest. 
The 
enigmatical 
letters 
in 
which 
it 
was 
concealed 
formed 
the 
followingsentence: 
— 


“Cynthiæfigurasæmulatur 
materAmorum.” 


Venus 
rivalsthephases 
ofthemoon. 


Hitherto, 
Galileo 
had 
observed 
Venus 
when 
her 
disc 
was 
largely 
illuminated; 
but 
having 
directed 
his 
telescope 
to 
her 
when 
she 
was 
not 
far 
removed 
from 
the 
sun, 
he 
saw 
her 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
crescent, 
resembling 



exactly 
the 
moon 
at 
the 
same 
elongation. 
He 
continued 
to 
observe 
her 
night 
after 
night, 
during 
the 
whole 
time 
that 
she 
could 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
course 
of 
her 
revolution 
round 
the 
sun, 
and 
he 
found 
that 
she 
exhibited 
the 
very 
same 
phaseswhichresultedfromhermotionroundthatluminary. 


Galileo 
had 
long 
contemplated 
a 
visit 
to 
the 
metropolis 
of 
Italy, 
and 
he 
accordingly 
carried 
his 
intentions 
into 
effect 
in 
the 
early 
part 
of 
the 
year 
1611. 
Here 
he 
was 
received 
with 
that 
distinction 
which 
was 
due 
to 
his 
great 
talents 
and 
his 
extended 
reputation. 
Princes, 
Cardinals, 
and 
Prelates 
hastened 
to 
do 
him 
honour; 
and 
even 
those 
who 
discredited 
his 
discoveries, 
and 
dreaded 
their 
results, 
vied 
with 
the 
true 
friends 
of 
science 
in 
their 
anxiety 
to 
seethe 
intellectualwonderoftheage. 


In 
order 
to 
show 
the 
new 
celestial 
phenomena 
to 
his 
friends 
at 
Rome, 
Galileo 
took 
with 
him 
his 
best 
telescope; 
and 
as 
he 
had 
discovered 
the 
spots 
on 
the 
sun’s 
surface 
in 
October 
or 
November 
1610, 
or 
evenearlier,he 
had 
the 
gratification 
of 
exhibiting 
them 
to 
his 
admiring 
disciples. 
He 
accordingly 
erected 
his 
telescope 
in 
the 
Quirinal 
garden, 
belonging 
to 
Cardinal 
Bandini; 
and 
in 
April 
1611 
he 
shewed 
them 
to 
his 
friends 
in 
many 
of 
their 
most 
interesting 
variations. 
Fromtheirchangeofpositionon 
thesun’s 
disc,Galileo 
at 
first 
inferred, 
either 
that 
the 
sun 
revolved 
about 
an 
axis, 
or 
that 
other 
planets, 
like 
Venus 
and 
Mercury, 
revolved 
so 
near 
the 
sun 
as 
to 
appear 
like 
black 
spots 
when 
they 
were 
opposite 
to 
his 
disc. 
Upon 
continuing 
his 
observations, 
however, 
he 
saw 
reason 
to 
abandon 
this 
hasty 
opinion. 
He 
found 
that 
the 
spots 
must 
be 
in 
contact 
with 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
sun, 
— 
that 
their 
figures 
were 
irregular, 
— 
that 
they 
had 
different 
degrees 
of 
darkness, 
— 
that 
one 
spot 
would 
often 
divide 
itself 
into 
three 
or 
four, 
— 
that 
three 
or 
four 
spots 
would 
often 
unite 
themselves 
into 
one, 
— 
and 
that 
all 
the 
spots 
revolved 
regularly 
with 
the 
sun, 
which 
appeared 
to 
complete 
its 
revolution 
in 
abouttwenty-eight 
days. 


Previous 
to 
the 
invention 
of 
the 
telescope, 
spots 
had 
been 
more 
than 
once 
seen 
on 
the 
sun’s 
disc 
with 
the 
unassisted 
eye. 
But 
even 
if 
these 
were 
of 
the 
same 
character 
as 
those 
which 
Galileo 
and 
others 
observed, 
we 
cannot 
consider 
them 
as 
anticipations 
of 
their 
discovery 
by 
the 
telescope. 
As 
the 
telescope 
was 
now 
in 
the 
possession 
of 
several 
astronomers, 
Galileo 
began 
to 
have 
many 
rivals 
in 
discovery; 
but 
notwithstanding 
the 
claims 
of 
Harriot, 
Fabricius, 
and 
Scheiner, 
it 
is 
now 
placed 
beyond 
the 
reach 
of 
doubt 
that 
he 
was 
the 
first 
discoverer 
of 
the 
solar 
spots. 
From 
the 
communication 
which 
I 
received 
in 
1822 
from 
the 
late 
Dr 
Robertson, 
of 
Oxford, 
it 
appeared 
that 



Thomas 
Harriot 
had 
observed 
the 
solar 
spots 
on 
the 
8th 
of 
December 
1610; 
but 
his 
manuscripts, 
in 
Lord 
Egremont’s 
possession, 
incontestably 
prove 
that 
his 
regular 
observations 
on 
the 
spots 
did 
not 
commence 
till 
December 
1, 
1611, 
although 
he 
had 
seen 
the 
spots 
at 
the 
date 
above 
mentioned, 
and 
that 
they 
were 
continued 
till 
the 
18th 
of 
January 
1613. 
The 
observations 
which 
he 
has 
recorded 
are 
199 
in 
number, 
and 
the 
accounts 
of 
them 
are 
accompanied 
with 
rough 
drawings 
representing 
the 
number, 
position, 
and 
magnitude 
of 
the 
spots. 
In 
the 
observation 
of 
Harriot, 
made 
on 
the 
8th 
December 
1610, 
before 
he 
knew 
of 
Galileo’s 
discovery, 
he 
saw 
three 
spots 
on 
the 
sun, 
which 
he 
has 
represented 
in 
a 
diagram. 
The 
sun 
was 
then 
7° 
or 
8° 
high, 
and 
there 
was 
a 
frost 
and 
a 
mist, 
which 
no 
doubt 
acted 
as 
a 
darkening 
glass. 
Harriot 
does 
not 
apply 
the 
name 
of 
spots 
to 
what 
he 
noticed 
in 
this 
observation, 
and 
he 
does 
not 
enumerate 
it 
among 
the 
199 
observations 
above 
mentioned. 
Professor 
Rigaud 
considers 
it 
“a 
misapplication 
of 
terms 
to 
call 
such 
an 
observation 
a 
discovery;” 
but, 
with 
all 
the 
respect 
which 
we 
feel 
for 
the 
candour 
of 
this 
remark, 
we 
are 
disposed 
to 
confer 
on 
Harriot 
the 
merit 
of 
an 
original 
discoverer 
ofthespotsonthesun. 


Another 
candidate 
for 
the 
honour 
of 
discovering 
the 
spots 
of 
the 
sun, 
was 
John 
Fabricius, 
who 
undoubtedly 
saw 
them 
previous 
to 
June 
1611. 
The 
dedication 
of 
the 
work 
in 
which 
he 
has 
recorded 
his 
observation, 
bears 
the 
date 
of 
the 
13th 
of 
June 
1611; 
and 
it 
is 
obvious, 
from 
the 
work 
itself, 
that 
he 
had 
seen 
the 
spots 
about 
the 
end 
of 
theyear 
1610; 
butas 
thereisno 
proofthat 
he 
saw 
them 
before 
October, 
we 
are 
compelled 
to 
assign 
the 
priority 
of 
the 
discoveryto 
theItalian 
astronomer. 


The 
claim 
of 
Scheiner, 
professor 
of 
mathematics 
at 
Ingolstadt, 
is 
more 
intimately 
connected 
with 
the 
history 
of 
Galileo. 
This 
learned 
astronomer 
having, 
early 
in 
1611, 
turned 
his 
telescope 
to 
the 
sun, 
necessarily 
discovered 
thespots 
which 
at 
that 
time 
covered 
hisdisc. 
Light 
flyingcloudshappened, 
at 
the 
time, 
to 
weaken 
the 
intensity 
of 
his 
light, 
so 
that 
he 
was 
able 
to 
show 
the 
spots 
to 
his 
pupils. 
These 
observations 
were 
not 
published 
till 
January 
1612; 
and 
they 
appeared 
in 
the 
form 
of 
three 
letters, 
addressed 
to 
Mark 
Velser, 
one 
of 
the 
magistrates 
of 
Augsburg, 
under 
the 
signature 
of 
Appelles 
post 
Tabulam. 
Scheiner, 
who, 
many 
years 
afterwards, 
published 
an 
elaborate 
work 
on 
the 
subject, 
adopted 
the 
same 
idea 
which 
had 
at 
first 
occurred 
to 
Galileo 


— 
that 
the 
spots 
were 
the 
dark 
sides 
of 
planets 
revolving 
round 
and 
near 
the 
sun. 

On 
the 
publication 
of 
Scheiner’s 
letters, 
Velser 
transmitted 
a 
copy 
of 
them 
to 
his 
friend 
Galileo, 
with 
the 
request 
that 
he 
would 
favour 
him 
with 
his 
opinion 
of 
the 
new 
phenomena. 
After 
some 
delay, 
Galileo 
addressed 
three 
letters 
to 
Velser, 
in 
which 
he 
combated 
the 
opinions 
of 
Scheiner 
on 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
spots. 
The 
first 
of 
these 
letters 
was 
dated 
the 
4th 
of 
May 
1612; 
but 
though 
the 
controversy 
was 
carried 
on 
in 
the 
language 
of 
mutual 
respect 
and 
esteem, 
it 
put 
an 
end 
to 
the 
friendship 
which 
had 
existed 
between 
the 
two 
astronomers. 
In 
these 
letters 
Galileo 
showed 
that 
the 
spots 
often 
dispersed 
like 
vapours 
or 
clouds; 
that 
they 
sometimes 
had 
a 
duration 
of 
only 
one 
or 
two 
days, 
and 
at 
other 
times 
of 
thirty 
or 
forty 
days; 
that 
they 
contracted 
in 
their 
breadth 
when 
they 
approached 
the 
sun’s 
limb, 
without 
any 
diminution 
of 
their 
length; 
that 
they 
describe 
circles 
parallel 
to 
each 
other; 
that 
the 
monthly 
rotation 
of 
the 
sun 
again 
brings 
the 
same 
spots 
into 
view; 
and 
that 
they 
are 
seldom 
seen 
at 
a 
greater 
distance 
than 
30° 
from 
the 
sun’s 
equator. 
Galileo 
likewise 
discovered 
on 
the 
sun’s 
disc 
faculæ, 
or 
luculi, 
as 
they 
were 
called, 
which 
differ 
in 
no 
respect 
from 
the 
common 
ones 
but 
in 
their 
being 
brighter 
thantherestofthesun’ssurface. 


In 
the 
last 
of 
the 
letters 
which 
our 
author 
addressed 
to 
Velser, 
and 
which 
was 
written 
in 
December 
1612, 
he 
recurs 
to 
his 
former 
discovery 
of 
the 
elongated 
shape, 
or 
rather 
the 
triple 
structure, 
of 
Saturn. 
The 
singular 
figure 
which 
he 
had 
observed 
in 
this 
planet 
had 
entirely 
disappeared; 
and 
he 
evidently 
announces 
the 
fact 
to 
Velser, 
lest 
it 
should 
be 
used 
by 
his 
enemies 
to 
discredit 
the 
accuracy 
of 
his 
observations. 
“Looking 
on 
Saturn,” 
says 
he, 
“within 
these 
few 
days, 
I 
found 
it 
solitary, 
without 
the 
assistance 
of 
its 
accustomed 
stars, 
and, 
in 
short, 
perfectly 
round 
and 
defined 
like 
Jupiter; 
and 
such 
it 
still 
remains. 
Now, 
what 
can 
be 
said 
of 
so 
strange 
a 
metamorphosis? 
Are 
the 
two 
smaller 
stars 
consumed 
like 
the 
spots 
on 
the 
sun? 
Have 
they 
suddenly 
vanished 
and 
fled? 
or 
has 
Saturn 
devoured 
his 
own 
children? 
or 
was 
the 
appearance 
indeed 
fraud 
and 
illusion, 
with 
which 
the 
glasses 
have 
for 
so 
long 
a 
time 
mocked 
me, 
and 
so 
many 
others 
who 
have 
often 
observed 
with 
me? 
Now, 
perhaps, 
the 
time 
is 
come 
to 
revive 
the 
withering 
hopes 
of 
those 
who, 
guided 
by 
more 
profound 
contemplations, 
have 
followed 
all 
the 
fallacies 
of 
the 
new 
observations, 
and 
recognised 
their 
impossibilities. 
I 
cannot 
resolve 
what 
to 
say 
in 
a 
chance 
so 
strange, 
so 
new, 
and 
so 
unexpected; 
the 
shortness 
of 
the 
time, 
the 
unexampled 
occurrence, 
the 
weakness 
of 
my 
intellect, 
and 
the 
terror 
of 
being 
mistaken, 
have 
greatly 
confounded 
me.” 
Although 
Galileo 
struggled 
to 
obtain 
a 
solution 
of 
this 
mystery, 
yet 
he 
had 



not 
the 
good 
fortune 
to 
succeed. 
He 
imagined 
that 
the 
two 
smaller 
stars 
would 
reappear, 
in 
consequence 
of 
the 
supposed 
revolution 
of 
the 
planet 
round 
its 
axis; 
but 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
ring 
of 
Saturn, 
and 
of 
the 
obliquity 
of 
its 
plane 
to 
the 
ecliptic, 
was 
necessary 
to 
explain 
the 
phenomena 
which 
were 
soperplexingtoourauthor. 


The 
ill 
health 
to 
which 
Galileo 
was 
occasionally 
subject, 
and 
the 
belief 
that 
the 
air 
of 
Florence 
was 
prejudicial 
to 
his 
complaints, 
induced 
him 
to 
spend 
much 
of 
his 
time 
at 
Selve, 
the 
villa 
of 
his 
friend 
Salviati. 
This 
eminent 
individual 
had 
ever 
been 
the 
warmest 
friend 
of 
Galileo, 
and 
seems 
to 
have 
delighted 
in 
drawing 
round 
him 
the 
scientific 
genius 
of 
the 
age. 
He 
was 
a 
member 
of 
the 
celebrated 
Lyncæan 
Society, 
founded 
by 
Prince 
Frederigo 
Cesi; 
and 
though 
he 
is 
not 
known 
as 
the 
author 
of 
any 
important 
discovery, 
yet 
he 
has 
earned, 
by 
his 
liberality 
to 
science, 
a 
glorious 
name, 
which 
will 
be 
indissolublyunited 
withtheimmortaldestinyof 
Galileo. 


The 
subject 
of 
floating 
bridges 
having 
been 
discussed 
at 
one 
of 
the 
scientific 
partieswhich 
had 
assembled 
at 
thehouse 
of 
Salviati, 
adifference 
of 
opinion 
arose 
respecting 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
shape 
of 
bodies 
on 
their 
disposition 
to 
float 
or 
to 
sink 
in 
a 
fluid. 
Contrary 
to 
the 
general 
opinion, 
Galileo 
undertook 
to 
prove 
that 
it 
depended 
on 
other 
causes; 
and 
he 
was 
thus 
led 
to 
compose 
his 
discourse 
on 
floating 
bodies, 
which 
was 
published 
in 
1612,anddedicatedto 
CosmodeMedici. 
Thisworkcontains 
many 
ingenious 
experiments, 
and 
much 
acute 
reasoning 
in 
support 
of 
the 
true 
principles 
of 
hydrostatics; 
and 
it 
is 
now 
chiefly 
remarkable 
as 
a 
specimen 
of 
the 
sagacity 
and 
intellectual 
power 
of 
its 
author. 
Like 
all 
his 
other 
works, 
it 
encountered 
the 
most 
violent 
opposition; 
and 
Galileo 
was 
more 
than 
once 
summoned 
into 
the 
field 
to 
repel 
the 
aggressions 
of 
his 
ignorant 
and 
presumptuous 
opponents. 
The 
first 
attack 
upon 
it 
was 
made 
by 
Ptolemy 
Nozzolini, 
in 
a 
letter 
to 
Marzemedici, 
Archbishop 
of 
Florence; 
and 
to 
this 
Galileo 
replied 
in 
a 
letter 
addressed 
to 
his 
antagonist. 
A 
more 
elaborate 
examination 
of 
it 
was 
published 
by 
Lodovico 
delle 
Colombe, 
and 
another 
by 
M. 
Vincenzo 
di 
Grazia. 
To 
these 
attacks, 
a 
minute 
and 
overwhelming 
answer 
was 
printed 
in 
the 
name 
of 
Benedetti 
Castelli, 
the 
friend 
and 
pupil 
of 
Galileo; 
but 
it 
was 
discovered, 
some 
years 
after 
Galileo’s 
death, 
that 
he 
was 
himself 
the 
author 
ofthiswork. 



CHAPTER 
IV. 


Galileo 
treats 
his 
opponents 
with 
severity 
and 
sarcasm 
— 
He 
is 
aided 
by 
the 
sceptics 
of 
the 
day 
— 
The 
Church 
party 
the 
most 
powerful 
— 
Galileo 
commences 
the 
attack, 
and 
is 
answered 
by 
Caccini, 
a 
Dominican 
— 
Galileo’s 
Letter 
to 
the 
Grand 
Duchess 
of 
Tuscany, 
in 
support 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
Earth 
and 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
Sun 
— 
Galileo 
visits 
Rome 
— 
Is 
summoned 
before 
the 
Inquisition, 
and 
renounces 
his 
opinions 
as 
heretical 
— 
The 
Inquisition 
denounces 
the 
Copernican 
System 
— 
Galileo 
has 
an 
audience 
of 
the 
Pope, 
but 
still 
maintains 
his 
opinions 
in 
private 
society 
— 
Proposes 
to 
find 
out 
the 
Longitude 
at 
Sea 
by 
means 
of 
Jupiter’s 
Satellites 
— 
His 
negociation 
on 
this 
subject 
with 
the 
Court 
of 
Spain 
— 
Its 
failure 
— 
He 
is 
unable 
to 
observe 
the 
three 
Comets 
of 
1618, 
but 
is 
involved 
in 
the 
controversy 
to 
which 
they 
gave 
rise. 


The 
current 
of 
Galileo’s 
life 
had 
hitherto 
flowed 
in 
a 
smooth 
and 
unobstructed 
channel. 
He 
had 
now 
attained 
the 
highest 
objects 
of 
earthly 
ambition. 
His 
discoveries 
had 
placed 
him 
at 
the 
head 
of 
the 
great 
men 
of 
the 
age; 
he 
possessed 
a 
professional 
income 
far 
beyond 
his 
wants, 
and 
even 
beyond 
his 
anticipations; 
and, 
what 
is 
still 
dearer 
to 
a 
philosopher, 
he 
enjoyed 
the 
most 
perfect 
leisure 
for 
carrying 
on 
and 
completing 
his 
discoveries. 
The 
opposition 
which 
these 
discoveries 
encountered, 
was 
to 
him 
more 
a 
subject 
for 
triumph 
than 
for 
sorrow. 
Prejudice 
and 
ignorance 
were 
his 
only 
enemies; 
and 
if 
they 
succeeded 
for 
a 
while 
in 
harassing 
his 
march, 
it 
was 
only 
to 
lay 
a 
foundation 
for 
fresh 
achievements. 
He 
who 
contends 
for 
truths 
which 
he 
has 
himself 
been 
permitted 
to 
discover, 
may 
well 
sustain 
the 
conflict 
in 
which 
presumption 
and 
error 
are 
destined 
to 
fall. 
The 
public 
tribunal 
may 
neither 
be 
sufficiently 
pure 
nor 
enlightened 
to 
decide 
upon 
the 
issue; 
but 
he 
can 
appeal 
toposterity,andreckonwithconfidenceon 
“itssuredecree.” 


The 
ardour 
of 
Galileo’s 
mind, 
the 
keenness 
of 
his 
temper, 
his 
clear 
perception 
of 
truth, 
and 
his 
inextinguishable 
love 
of 
it, 
combined 
to 
exasperate 
and 
prolong 
the 
hostility 
of 
his 
enemies. 
When 
argument 
failed 
to 
enlighten 
their 
judgment, 
and 
reason 
to 
dispel 
their 
prejudices, 
he 
wielded 
against 
them 
his 
powerful 
weapons 
of 
ridicule 
and 
sarcasm; 
and 
in 
this 
unrelenting 
warfare, 
he 
seems 
to 
have 
forgotten 
that 
Providence 
had 
withheld 
from 
his 
enemies 
those 
very 
gifts 
which 
he 
had 
so 
liberally 
received. 
He 
who 



is 
allowed 
to 
take 
the 
start 
of 
his 
species, 
and 
to 
penetrate 
the 
veil 
which 
conceals 
from 
common 
minds 
the 
mysteries 
of 
nature, 
must 
not 
expect 
that 
the 
world 
will 
be 
patiently 
dragged 
at 
the 
chariot 
wheels 
of 
his 
philosophy. 
Mind 
has 
its 
inertia 
as 
well 
as 
matter; 
and 
its 
progress 
to 
truth 
can 
only 
be 
insured 
by 
the 
gradual 
and 
patient 
removal 
of 
the 
obstructions 
which 
surround 
it. 


The 
boldness 
— 
may 
we 
not 
say 
the 
recklessness 
— 
with 
which 
Galileo 
insisted 
upon 
making 
proselytes 
of 
his 
enemies, 
served 
but 
to 
alienate 
them 
from 
the 
truth. 
Errors 
thus 
assailed 
speedily 
entrench 
themselves 
in 
general 
feelings, 
and 
become 
embalmed 
in 
the 
virulence 
of 
the 
passions. 
The 
various 
classes 
of 
his 
opponents 
marshalled 
themselves 
for 
their 
mutual 
defence. 
The 
Aristotelian 
professors, 
the 
temporising 
Jesuits, 
the 
political 
churchmen, 
and 
that 
timid 
but 
respectable 
body 
who 
at 
all 
times 
dread 
innovation, 
whether 
it 
be 
in 
religion 
or 
in 
science, 
entered 
into 
an 
alliance 
against 
the 
philosophical 
tyrant 
whothreatened 
themwiththepenaltiesof 
knowledge. 


The 
party 
of 
Galileo, 
though 
weak 
in 
numbers, 
was 
not 
without 
power 
and 
influence. 
Hehad 
trained 
around 
him 
adevoted 
band, 
who 
idolised 
his 
genius 
and 
cherished 
his 
doctrines. 
His 
pupils 
had 
been 
appointed 
to 
several 
of 
the 
principal 
professorships 
in 
Italy. 
The 
enemies 
of 
religion 
were 
on 
this 
occasion 
united 
with 
the 
Christian 
philosopher; 
and 
there 
were, 
even 
in 
these 
days, 
many 
princes 
and 
nobles 
who 
had 
felt 
the 
inconvenience 
of 
ecclesiastical 
jurisdiction, 
and 
who 
secretly 
abetted 
Galileo 
in 
his 
crusade 
againstestablished 
errors. 


Although 
these 
two 
parties 
had 
been 
long 
dreading 
each 
others 
power, 
and 
reconnoitring 
each 
others 
position, 
yet 
we 
cannot 
exactly 
determine 
which 
of 
them 
hoisted 
the 
first 
signal 
for 
war. 
The 
church 
party, 
particularly 
its 
highest 
dignitaries, 
were 
certainly 
disposed 
to 
rest 
on 
the 
defensive. 
Flanked 
on 
one 
side 
by 
the 
logic 
of 
the 
schools, 
and 
on 
the 
other 
by 
the 
popular 
interpretation 
of 
Scripture, 
and 
backed 
by 
the 
strong 
arm 
of 
the 
civil 
power, 
they 
were 
not 
disposed 
to 
interfere 
with 
the 
prosecution 
of 
science, 
however 
much 
they 
may 
have 
dreaded 
its 
influence. 
The 
philosophers, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
united 
the 
zeal 
of 
innovators 
with 
that 
firmness 
of 
purpose 
which 
truth 
alone 
can 
inspire. 
Victorious 
in 
every 
contest, 
they 
were 
flushed 
with 
success, 
and 
they 
pantedforastruggleinwhichtheyknewthey 
musttriumph. 


In 
this 
state 
of 
warlike 
preparation 
Galileo 
addressed 
a 
letter, 
in 
1613, 
to 
his 
friend 
and 
pupil, 
the 
Abbé 
Castelli, 
the 
object 
of 
which 
was 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
Scriptures 
were 
not 
intended 
to 
teach 
us 
science 
and 
philosophy. 
Hence 



he 
inferred, 
that 
the 
language 
employed 
in 
the 
sacred 
volume 
in 
reference 
to 
such 
subjects 
should 
be 
interpreted 
only 
in 
its 
common 
acceptation; 
and 
that 
it 
was 
in 
reality 
as 
difficult 
to 
reconcile 
the 
Ptolemaic 
as 
the 
Copernican 
systemto 
the 
expressionswhich 
occurinthe 
Bible. 


A 
demonstration 
was 
about 
this 
time 
made 
by 
the 
opposite 
party, 
in 
the 
person 
of 
Caccini, 
a 
Dominican 
friar, 
who 
made 
a 
personal 
attack 
upon 
Galileo 
from 
the 
pulpit. 
This 
violent 
ecclesiastic 
ridiculed 
the 
astronomer 
and 
his 
followers, 
by 
addressing 
them 
sarcastically 
in 
the 
sacred 
language 
of 
Scripture— 
“Ye 
men 
of 
Galilee, 
why 
stand 
ye 
here 
looking 
up 
into 
heaven?” 
But 
this 
species 
of 
warfare 
was 
disapproved 
of 
even 
by 
the 
church; 
and 
Luigi 
Maraffi, 
the 
general 
of 
the 
Dominicans, 
not 
only 
apologised 
to 
Galileo, 
who 
had 
transmitted 
to 
him 
a 
formal 
complaint 
against 
Caccini, 
but 
expressed 
the 
acuteness 
of 
his 
own 
feelings 
on 
being 
implicated 
in 
the 
“brutal 
conduct 
of 
thirtyorfortythousandmonks.” 


From 
the 
character 
of 
Caccini, 
and 
the 
part 
which 
he 
afterwards 
played 
in 
the 
persecution 
of 
Galileo, 
we 
can 
scarcely 
avoid 
the 
opinion 
that 
his 
attack 
from 
the 
pulpit 
was 
intended 
as 
a 
snare 
for 
the 
unwary 
philosopher. 
It 
roused 
Galileo 
from 
his 
wonted 
caution; 
and 
stimulated, 
no 
doubt, 
by 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
answer 
which 
he 
received 
from 
Maraffi, 
he 
published 
a 
long 
letter 
of 
seventy 
pages, 
defending 
and 
illustrating 
his 
former 
views 
respecting 
the 
influence 
of 
scriptural 
language 
on 
the 
two 
contending 
systems. 
As 
if 
to 
give 
the 
impress 
of 
royal 
authority 
to 
this 
new 
appeal, 
he 
addressed 
it 
to 
Christian, 
Grand 
Duchess 
of 
Tuscany, 
the 
mother 
of 
Cosmo; 
and 
in 
this 
form 
it 
seems 
to 
have 
excited 
a 
new 
interest, 
as 
if 
it 
had 
expressed 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
grand 
ducal 
family. 
These 
external 
circumstances 
gave 
additional 
weight 
to 
the 
powerful 
and 
unanswerable 
reasoning 
which 
this 
letter 
contains; 
and 
it 
was 
scarcely 
possible 
that 
any 
man, 
possessed 
of 
a 
sound 
mind, 
and 
willing 
to 
learn 
the 
truth, 
should 
refuse 
his 
assent 
to 
the 
judicious 
views 
of 
our 
author. 
He 
expresses 
his 
belief 
that 
the 
Scriptures 
were 
designed 
to 
instruct 
mankind 
respecting 
their 
salvation, 
and 
that 
the 
faculties 
of 
our 
minds 
were 
given 
us 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
investigating 
the 
phenomena 
of 
nature. 
He 
considers 
Scripture 
and 
nature 
as 
proceeding 
from 
the 
same 
divine 
author, 
and, 
therefore, 
incapable 
of 
speaking 
a 
different 
language; 
and 
he 
points 
out 
the 
absurdity 
of 
supposing 
that 
professors 
of 
astronomy 
will 
shut 
their 
eyes 
to 
the 
phenomena 
which 
they 
discover 
in 
the 
heavens, 
or 
will 
refuse 
to 
believe 
those 
deductions 
of 
reason 
which 
appeal 
to 
their 
judgment 
with 
all 
the 
power 
of 
demonstration. 
He 
supports 
these 
views 
by 
quotations 
from 
the 
ancient 



fathers; 
and 
he 
refers 
to 
the 
dedication 
of 
Copernicus’s 
own 
work 
to 
the 
Roman 
Pontiff, 
Paul 
III., 
as 
a 
proof 
that 
the 
Pope 
himself 
did 
not 
regard 
the 
new 
system 
of 
the 
world 
as 
hostile 
to 
the 
sacred 
writings. 
Copernicus, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
tells 
his 
Holiness, 
that 
the 
reason 
of 
inscribing 
to 
him 
his 
new 
system 
was, 
that 
the 
authority 
of 
the 
Pontiff 
might 
put 
to 
silence 
the 
calumnies 
of 
some 
individuals, 
who 
attacked 
it 
by 
arguments 
drawn 
from 
passages 
ofScripturetwistedfortheirown 
purpose. 


It 
was 
in 
vain 
to 
meet 
such 
reasoning 
by 
any 
other 
weapons 
than 
those 
of 
the 
civil 
power. 
The 
enemies 
of 
Galileo 
saw 
that 
they 
must 
either 
crush 
the 
dangerous 
innovation, 
or 
allow 
it 
the 
fullest 
scope; 
and 
they 
determined 
upon 
an 
appeal 
to 
the 
inquisition. 
Lorini, 
a 
monk 
of 
the 
Dominican 
order, 
had 
already 
denounced 
to 
this 
body 
Galileo’s 
letter 
to 
Castelli; 
and 
Caccini, 
bribed 
by 
the 
mastership 
of 
the 
convent 
of 
St 
Mary 
of 
Minerva, 
was 
invited 
tosettleat 
RomeforthepurposeofembodyingtheevidenceagainstGalileo. 


Though 
these 
plans 
had 
been 
carried 
on 
in 
secret, 
yet 
Galileo’s 
suspicions 
wereexcited; 
and 
heobtainedleave 
fromCosmo 
to 
go 
toRomeabout 
theend 
of 
1615. 
Here 
he 
was 
lodged 
in 
the 
palace 
of 
the 
Grand 
Duke’s 
ambassador, 
and 
kept 
up 
a 
constant 
correspondence 
with 
the 
family 
of 
his 
patron 
at 
Florence; 
but, 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
this 
external 
splendour, 
he 
was 
summoned 
before 
the 
inquisition 
to 
answer 
for 
the 
heretical 
doctrines 
which 
he 
had 
published. 
He 
was 
charged 
with 
maintaining 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
earth, 
and 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
sun 
— 
with 
teaching 
this 
doctrine 
to 
his 
pupils 
— 
with 
corresponding 
on 
the 
subject 
with 
several 
German 
mathematicians 
— 
and 
with 
having 
published 
it, 
and 
attempted 
to 
reconcile 
it 
to 
Scripture, 
in 
his 
letters 
to 
Mark 
Velser 
in 
1612. 
The 
inquisition 
assembled 
to 
consider 
these 
charges 
on 
the 
25th 
of 
February 
1615; 
and 
it 
was 
decreed 
that 
Galileo 
should 
be 
enjoined 
by 
Cardinal 
Bellarmine 
to 
renounce 
the 
obnoxious 
doctrines, 
and 
to 
pledge 
himself 
that 
he 
would 
neither 
teach, 
defend, 
nor 
publish 
them 
in 
future. 
In 
the 
event 
of 
his 
refusing 
to 
acquiesce 
in 
this 
sentence, 
it 
was 
decreed 
that 
he 
should 
be 
thrown 
into 
prison. 
Galileo 
did 
not 
hesitate 
to 
yield 
to 
this 
injunction. 
On 
the 
day 
following, 
the 
26th 
of 
February, 
he 
appeared 
before 
Cardinal 
Bellarmine, 
to 
renounce 
his 
heretical 
opinions; 
and, 
having 
declared 
that 
he 
abandoned 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
earth’s 
motion, 
and 
would 
neither 
defend 
nor 
teach 
it, 
in 
his 
conversation 
or 
in 
his 
writings, 
he 
was 
dismissedfromthebaroftheinquisition. 


Having 
thus 
disposed 
of 
Galileo, 
the 
inquisition 
conceived 
the 
design 
of 
condemning 
the 
whole 
system 
of 
Copernicus 
as 
heretical. 
Galileo, 
with 
more 



hardihood 
than 
prudence, 
remained 
at 
Rome 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
giving 
his 
assistance 
in 
frustrating 
this 
plan; 
but 
there 
is 
reason 
to 
think 
that 
he 
injured 
by 
his 
presence 
the 
very 
cause 
which 
he 
meant 
to 
support. 
The 
inquisitors 
had 
determined 
to 
put 
down 
the 
new 
opinions; 
and 
they 
now 
inserted 
among 
the 
prohibited 
books 
Galileo’s 
letters 
to 
Castelli 
and 
the 
Grand 
Duchess, 
Kepler’s 
epitome 
of 
the 
Copernican 
theory, 
and 
Copernicus’s 
own 
work 
on 
therevolutionsof 
the 
heavenlybodies. 


Notwithstanding 
these 
proceedings, 
Galileo 
had 
an 
audience 
of 
the 
Pope, 
PaulV.,in 
March1616. 
He 
wasreceived 
verygraciously,and 
spent 
nearlyan 
hour 
with 
his 
Holiness. 
When 
they 
were 
about 
to 
part, 
the 
Pope 
assured 
Galileo, 
that 
the 
congregation 
were 
not 
disposed 
to 
receive 
upon 
light 
grounds 
any 
calumnies 
which 
might 
be 
propagated 
by 
his 
enemies, 
and 
that, 
aslongasheoccupied 
the 
papalchair, 
hemight 
considerhimselfassafe. 


These 
assurances 
were 
no 
doubt 
founded 
on 
the 
belief 
that 
Galileo 
would 
adhere 
to 
his 
pledges; 
but 
so 
bold 
and 
inconsiderate 
was 
he 
in 
the 
expression 
of 
his 
opinions, 
that 
even 
in 
Rome 
he 
was 
continually 
engaged 
in 
controversial 
discussions. 
The 
following 
very 
interesting 
account 
of 
these 
disputesisgivenby 
Querenghi,ina 
lettertothe 
CardinalD’Este: 
— 


“Your 
eminence 
would 
be 
delighted 
with 
Galileo 
if 
you 
heard 
him 
holding 
forth, 
as 
he 
often 
does, 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
fifteen 
or 
twenty, 
all 
violently 
attacking 
him, 
sometimes 
in 
one 
house, 
sometimes 
in 
another. 
But 
he 
is 
armed 
after 
such 
fashion 
that 
he 
laughs 
all 
of 
them 
to 
scorn; 
and 
even 
if 
the 
novelty 
of 
his 
opinions 
prevents 
entire 
persuasion, 
he 
at 
least 
convicts 
of 
emptiness 
most 
of 
the 
arguments 
with 
which 
his 
adversaries 
endeavour 
to 
overwhelm 
him. 
He 
was 
particularly 
admirable 
on 
Monday 
last 
in 
the 
house 
of 
Signor 
Frederico 
Ghisilieri; 
and 
what 
especially 
pleased 
me 
was, 
that 
before 
replying 
to 
the 
contrary 
arguments, 
he 
amplified 
and 
enforced 
them 
with 
new 
grounds 
of 
great 
plausibility, 
so 
as 
to 
leave 
his 
adversaries 
in 
a 
moreridiculousplight,whenheafterwards 
overturnedthemall.” 


The 
discovery 
of 
Jupiter’s 
satellites 
suggested 
to 
Galileo 
a 
new 
method 
of 
finding 
the 
longitude 
at 
sea. 
Philip 
III. 
had 
encouraged 
astronomers 
to 
direct 
their 
attention 
to 
this 
problem, 
by 
offering 
a 
reward 
for 
its 
solution; 
and 
in 
those 
days, 
when 
new 
discoveries 
in 
science 
were 
sometimes 
rejected 
as 
injurious 
to 
mankind, 
it 
was 
no 
common 
event 
to 
see 
a 
powerful 
sovereign 
courting 
the 
assistance 
of 
astronomers 
in 
promoting 
the 
commercial 
interests 
of 
his 
empire. 
Galileo 
seems 
to 
have 
regarded 
the 
solution 
of 
this 
problem 
as 
an 
object 
worthy 
of 
his 
ambition; 
and 
he 
no 
doubt 
anticipated 
the 
triumph 



which 
he 
would 
obtain 
over 
his 
enemies, 
if 
the 
Medicean 
stars, 
which 
they 
had 
treated 
with 
such 
contempt, 
could 
be 
made 
subservient 
to 
the 
great 
interests 
of 
mankind. 
During 
his 
residence 
at 
Rome 
in 
1615 
and 
1616, 
Galileo 
had 
communicated 
his 
views 
on 
this 
subject 
to 
the 
Comte 
di 
Lemos, 
the 
Viceroy 
of 
Naples, 
who 
had 
presided 
over 
the 
council 
of 
the 
Spanish 
Indies. 
This 
nobleman 
advised 
him 
to 
apply 
to 
the 
Spanish 
minister 
the 
Duke 
of 
Lerma; 
and, 
through 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
Grand 
Duke 
Cosmo, 
his 
ambassador 
at 
the 
court 
of 
Madrid 
was 
engaged 
to 
manage 
the 
affair. 
The 
anxiety 
of 
Galileo 
on 
this 
subject 
was 
singularly 
great. 
He 
assured 
the 
Tuscan 
ambassador 
that, 
in 
order 
to 
accomplish 
this 
object, 
“he 
was 
ready 
to 
leave 
all 
his 
comforts, 
his 
country, 
his 
friends, 
and 
his 
family, 
to 
cross 
over 
into 
Spain, 
and 
to 
stay 
as 
long 
as 
he 
might 
be 
wanted 
at 
Seville 
or 
at 
Lisbon, 
or 
wherever 
it 
might 
be 
convenient 
to 
communicate 
a 
knowledge 
of 
his 
method.” 
The 
lethargy 
of 
the 
Spanish 
court 
seems 
to 
have 
increased 
with 
the 
enthusiasm 
of 
Galileo; 
and 
though 
the 
negotiations 
were 
occasionally 
revived 
for 
ten 
or 
twelve 
years, 
yet 
no 
steps 
were 
taken 
to 
bring 
them 
to 
a 
close. 
This 
strange 
procrastination 
has 
been 
generally 
ascribed 
to 
jealousy 
or 
indifference 
on 
the 
part 
of 
Spain; 
but 
Nelli, 
one 
of 
Galileo’s 
biographers, 
declares, 
on 
the 
authority 
of 
Florentine 
records, 
that 
Cosmo 
had 
privately 
requested 
from 
the 
government 
the 
privilege 
of 
sending 
annually 
to 
the 
Spanish 
Indies 
two 
Leghorn 
merchantmenfreeof 
duty,as 
acompensation 
for 
thelossofGalileo! 


The 
failure 
of 
this 
negotiation 
must 
have 
been 
a 
source 
of 
extreme 
mortification 
to 
the 
high 
spirit 
and 
sanguine 
temperament 
of 
Galileo. 
He 
had 
calculated, 
however, 
too 
securely 
on 
his 
means 
of 
putting 
the 
new 
method 
to 
a 
successful 
trial. 
The 
great 
imperfection 
of 
the 
time-keepers 
of 
that 
day, 
and 
the 
want 
of 
proper 
telescopes, 
would 
have 
baffled 
him 
in 
all 
his 
efforts, 
and 
he 
would 
have 
been 
subject 
to 
a 
more 
serious 
mortification 
from 
the 
failure 
and 
rejection 
of 
his 
plan, 
than 
that 
which 
he 
actually 
experienced 
from 
the 
avarice 
of 
his 
patron, 
or 
the 
indifference 
of 
Spain. 
Even 
in 
the 
present 
day, 
no 
telescope 
has 
been 
invented 
which 
is 
capable 
of 
observing 
at 
sea 
the 
eclipses 
of 
Jupiter’s 
satellites; 
and 
though 
this 
method 
of 
finding 
the 
longitude 
has 
great 
advantages 
on 
shore, 
yet 
it 
has 
been 
completely 
abandoned 
at 
sea, 
and 
superseded 
byeasierandmorecorrectmethods. 


In 
the 
year 
1618, 
when 
no 
fewer 
than 
three 
comets 
visited 
our 
system, 
and 
attracted 
the 
attention 
of 
all 
the 
astronomers 
of 
Europe, 
Galileo 
was 
unfortunately 
confined 
to 
his 
bed 
by 
a 
severe 
illness; 
but, 
though 
he 
was 
unable 
to 
make 
a 
single 
observation 
upon 
these 
remarkable 
bodies, 
he 



contrived 
to 
involve 
himself 
in 
the 
controversies 
which 
they 
occasioned. 
Marco 
Guiducci, 
an 
astronomer 
of 
Florence, 
and 
a 
friend 
of 
Galileo, 
had 
delivered 
a 
discourse 
on 
comets 
before 
the 
Florentine 
Academy. 
The 
heads 
of 
this 
discourse, 
which 
was 
published 
in 
1619, 
were 
supposed 
to 
have 
been 
communicated 
to 
him 
by 
Galileo, 
and 
this 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
universally 
admitted 
during 
the 
controversy 
to 
which 
it 
gave 
rise. 
The 
opinion 
maintained 
in 
this 
treatise, 
that 
comets 
are 
nothing 
but 
meteors 
which 
occasionally 
appear 
in 
our 
atmosphere, 
like 
halos 
and 
rainbows, 
savours 
so 
little 
of 
the 
sagacity 
of 
Galileo 
that 
we 
should 
be 
disposed 
to 
question 
its 
paternity. 
His 
inability 
to 
partake 
in 
the 
general 
interest 
which 
these 
three 
comets 
excited, 
and 
to 
employ 
his 
powerful 
telescope 
in 
observing 
their 
phenomena, 
and 
their 
movements, 
might 
have 
had 
some 
slight 
share 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
an 
opinion 
which 
deprived 
them 
of 
their 
importance 
as 
celestial 
bodies. 
But, 
however 
this 
may 
have 
been, 
the 
treatise 
of 
Guiducci 
afforded 
a 
favourable 
point 
of 
attack 
to 
Galileo’s 
enemies, 
and 
the 
dangerous 
task 
was 
entrusted 
to 
Horatio 
Grassi, 
a 
learned 
Jesuit, 
who, 
in 
a 
work 
entitled 
The 
Astronomical 
and 
Philosophical 
Balance, 
criticised 
the 
discourse 
on 
comets, 
underthe 
feigned 
name 
ofLotarioSarsi. 


Galileo 
replied 
to 
this 
attack 
in 
a 
volume 
entitled 
Il 
Saggiatore, 
or 
The 
Assayer, 
which, 
owing 
to 
the 
state 
of 
his 
health, 
was 
not 
published 
till 
the 
autumn 
of 
1623. 
This 
work 
was 
written 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
letter 
to 
Virginio 
Cesarini, 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Lyncæan 
Academy, 
and 
master 
of 
the 
chamber 
to 
Urban 
VIII., 
who 
had 
just 
ascended 
the 
papal 
throne. 
It 
was 
dedicated 
to 
the 
Pontiff 
himself, 
and 
has 
been 
long 
celebrated 
among 
literary 
men 
for 
the 
beauty 
of 
its 
language, 
though 
it 
is 
doubtless 
one 
of 
the 
least 
important 
of 
Galileo’swritings.

to 
return 
to 
his 
own 
house 
at 
Arcetri, 
as 
the 
place 
of 
his 
confinement. 


The 
succession 
of 
the 
Cardinal 
Maffeo 
Barberini 
to 
the 
papal 
throne, 
under 
the 
name 
of 
Urban 
VIII., 
was 
hailed 
by 
Galileo 
and 
his 
friends 
as 
an 
event 
favourable 
to 
the 
promotion 
of 
science. 
Urban 
had 
not 
only 
been 
the 
personal 
friend 
of 
Galileo 
and 
of 
Prince 
Cesi, 
the 
founder 
of 
the 
Lyncæan 
Academy, 
but 
had 
been 
intimately 
connected 
with 
that 
able 
and 
liberal 
association; 
and 
it 
was 
therefore 
deemed 
prudent 
to 
secure 
his 
favour 
and 
attachment. 
If 
Paul 
III. 
had, 
nearly 
a 
century 
before, 
patronised 
Copernicus, 
and 
accepted 
of 
the 
dedication 
of 
his 
great 
work, 
it 
was 
not 
unreasonable 
to 
expectthat,in 
more 
enlightened 
times,anotherPontiffmightexhibitthesame 
liberalityto 
science. 


The 
plan 
of 
securing 
to 
Galileo 
the 
patronage 
of 
Urban 
VIII. 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
devised 
by 
Prince 
Cesi. 
Although 
Galileo 
had 
not 
been 
able 
for 
some 
years 
to 
travel, 
excepting 
in 
a 
litter, 
yet 
he 
was 
urged 
by 
the 
Prince 
to 
perform 
a 
journey 
to 
Rome, 
for 
the 
express 
purpose 
of 
congratulating 
his 
friend 
upon 
his 
elevation 
to 
the 
papal 
chair. 
This 
request 
was 
made 
in 
October 
1623; 
and 
though 
Galileo’s 
health 
was 
not 
such 
as 
to 
authorise 
him 
to 
undergo 
so 
much 
fatigue, 
yet 
he 
felt 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
advice, 
and, 
after 
visiting 
Cesi 
at 
Acqua 
Sparta, 
he 
arrived 
at 
Rome 
in 
the 
spring 
of 
1624. 
The 
reception 
which 
he 
here 
experienced 
far 
exceeded 
his 
most 
sanguine 
expectations. 
During 
the 
two 
months 
which 
he 
spent 
in 
the 
capital 
he 
was 
permitted 
to 
have 
no 
fewer 
than 
six 
long 
and 
gratifying 
audiences 
of 
the 



Pope. 
The 
kindness 
of 
his 
Holiness 
was 
of 
the 
most 
marked 
description. 
He 
not 
only 
loaded 
Galileo 
with 
presents, 
and 
promised 
him 
a 
pension 
for 
his 
son 
Vincenzo, 
but 
he 
wrote 
a 
letter 
to 
Ferdinand, 
who 
had 
just 
succeeded 
Cosmo 
as 
Grand 
Duke 
of 
Tuscany, 
recommending 
Galileo 
to 
his 
particular 
patronage. 
“For 
we 
find 
in 
him,” 
says 
he, 
“not 
only 
literary 
distinction, 
but 
the 
love 
of 
piety; 
and 
he 
is 
strong 
in 
those 
qualities 
by 
which 
Pontifical 
goodwill 
is 
easily 
obtained. 
And 
now, 
when 
he 
has 
been 
brought 
to 
this 
city 
to 
congratulate 
us 
on 
our 
elevation, 
we 
have 
very 
lovingly 
embraced 
him; 
nor 
can 
we 
suffer 
him 
to 
return 
to 
the 
country 
whither 
your 
liberality 
recalls 
him, 
without 
an 
ample 
provision 
of 
Pontifical 
love. 
And 
that 
you 
may 
know 
how 
dear 
he 
is 
to 
us, 
we 
have 
willed 
to 
give 
him 
this 
honourable 
testimonial 
of 
virtue 
and 
piety. 
And 
we 
further 
signify, 
that 
every 
benefit 
which 
you 
shall 
confer 
upon 
him, 
imitating 
or 
even 
surpassing 
your 
father’s 
liberality, 
will 
conduce 
toourgratification.” 


Not 
content 
with 
thus 
securing 
the 
friendship 
of 
the 
Pope, 
Galileo 
endeavoured 
to 
bespeak 
the 
good-will 
of 
the 
Cardinals 
towards 
the 
Copernican 
system. 
He 
had, 
accordingly, 
many 
interviews 
with 
several 
of 
these 
dignitaries; 
and 
he 
was 
assured, 
by 
Cardinal 
Hohenzoller, 
that 
in 
a 
representation 
which 
he 
had 
made 
to 
the 
Pope 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
Copernicus, 
he 
stated 
to 
his 
Holiness, 
“that 
as 
all 
the 
heretics 
considered 
that 
system 
as 
undoubted, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
be 
very 
circumspect 
in 
coming 
to 
any 
resolution 
on 
the 
subject.” 
To 
this 
remark 
his 
Holiness 
replied— 
“that 
the 
church 
had 
not 
condemned 
this 
system; 
and 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be 
condemned 
as 
heretical, 
but 
only 
as 
rash;” 
and 
he 
added, 
“that 
there 
was 
no 
fear 
of 
any 
personundertaking 
toprovethatitmustnecessarily 
betrue.” 


The 
recent 
appointment 
of 
the 
Abbé 
Castelli, 
the 
friend 
and 
pupil 
of 
Galileo, 
to 
be 
mathematician 
to 
the 
Pope, 
was 
an 
event 
of 
a 
most 
gratifying 
nature; 
and 
when 
we 
recollect 
that 
it 
was 
to 
Castelli 
that 
he 
addressed 
the 
famous 
letter 
which 
was 
pronounced 
heretical 
by 
the 
Inquisition, 
we 
must 
regard 
it 
also 
as 
an 
event 
indicative 
of 
a 
new 
and 
favourable 
feeling 
towards 
the 
friends 
of 
science. 
The 
opinions 
of 
Urban, 
indeed, 
had 
suffered 
no 
change. 
He 
was 
one 
of 
the 
few 
Cardinals 
who 
had 
opposed 
the 
inquisitorial 
decree 
of 
1616, 
and 
his 
subsequent 
demeanour 
was 
in 
every 
respect 
conformable 
to 
the 
liberality 
of 
his 
early 
views. 
The 
sincerity 
of 
his 
conduct 
was 
still 
further 
evinced 
by 
the 
grant 
of 
a 
pension 
of 
one 
hundred 
crowns 
to 
Galileo, 
a 
few 
years 
after 
his 
visit 
to 
Rome; 
though 
there 
is 
reason 
to 
think 
that 
thisallowancewas 
notregularly 
paid. 



The 
death 
of 
Cosmo, 
whose 
liberality 
had 
given 
him 
both 
affluence 
and 
leisure, 
threatened 
Galileo 
with 
pecuniary 
difficulties. 
He 
had 
been 
involved 
in 
a 
“great 
load 
of 
debt,” 
owing 
to 
the 
circumstances 
of 
his 
brother’s 
family; 
and, 
in 
order 
to 
relieve 
himself, 
he 
had 
requested 
Castelli 
to 
dispose 
of 
the 
pension 
of 
his 
son 
Vincenzo. 
In 
addition 
to 
this 
calamity 
he 
was 
now 
alarmed 
at 
the 
prospect 
of 
losing 
his 
salary 
as 
an 
extraordinary 
professor 
at 
Pisa. 
The 
great 
youth 
of 
Ferdinand, 
who 
was 
scarcely 
of 
age, 
induced 
Galileo’s 
enemies, 
in 
1629, 
to 
raise 
doubts 
respecting 
the 
payment 
of 
a 
salary 
to 
a 
professor 
who 
neither 
resided 
nor 
lectured 
in 
the 
university; 
but 
the 
question 
was 
decided 
in 
his 
favour, 
and 
we 
have 
no 
doubt 
that 
the 
decision 
was 
facilitated 
by 
the 
friendly 
recommendation 
of 
the 
Pope, 
to 
which 
we 
have 
alreadyreferred. 


Although 
Galileo 
had 
made 
a 
narrow 
escape 
from 
the 
grasp 
of 
the 
Inquisition, 
yet 
he 
was 
never 
sufficiently 
sensible 
of 
the 
lenity 
which 
he 
experienced. 
When 
he 
left 
Rome 
in 
1616, 
under 
the 
solemn 
pledge 
of 
never 
again 
teaching 
the 
obnoxious 
doctrine, 
it 
was 
with 
a 
hostility 
against 
the 
church, 
suppressed 
but 
deeply 
cherished; 
and 
his 
resolution 
to 
propagate 
the 
heresy 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
coeval 
with 
the 
vow 
by 
which 
he 
renounced 
it. 
In 
the 
year 
1618, 
when 
he 
communicated 
his 
theory 
of 
the 
tides 
to 
the 
Archduke 
Leopold,healludesin 
the 
mostsarcasticmannerto 
theconductof 
thechurch. 
The 
same 
hostile 
tone, 
more 
or 
less, 
pervaded 
all 
his 
writings, 
and, 
while 
he 
laboured 
to 
sharpen 
the 
edge 
of 
his 
satire, 
he 
endeavoured 
to 
guard 
himself 
against 
its 
effects, 
by 
an 
affectation 
of 
the 
humblest 
deference 
to 
the 
decisions 
of 
theology. 
Had 
Galileo 
stood 
alone, 
his 
devotion 
to 
science 
might 
have 
withdrawn 
him 
from 
so 
hopeless 
a 
contest; 
but 
he 
was 
spurred 
on 
by 
the 
violence 
of 
a 
party. 
The 
Lyncæan 
Academy 
never 
scrupled 
to 
summon 
him 
from 
his 
researches. 
They 
placed 
him 
in 
the 
forlorn 
hope 
of 
their 
combat, 
and 
heat 
lastfella 
victimtotherashnessofhisfriends. 


But 
whatever 
allowance 
we 
may 
make 
for 
the 
ardour 
of 
Galileo’s 
temper, 
and 
the 
peculiarity 
of 
his 
position; 
and 
however 
we 
may 
justify 
and 
even 
approve 
of 
his 
past 
conduct, 
his 
visit 
to 
Urban 
VIII., 
in 
1624, 
placed 
him 
in 
a 
new 
relation 
to 
the 
church, 
which 
demanded 
on 
his 
part 
a 
new 
and 
corresponding 
demeanour. 
The 
noble 
and 
generous 
reception 
which 
he 
met 
with 
from 
Urban, 
and 
the 
liberal 
declaration 
of 
Cardinal 
Hohenzoller 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
Copernican 
system, 
should 
have 
been 
regarded 
as 
expressions 
of 
regret 
for 
the 
past, 
and 
offers 
of 
conciliation 
for 
the 
future. 
Thus 
honoured 
by 
the 
head 
of 
the 
church, 
and 
befriended 
by 
its 
dignitaries, 
Galileo 
must 



have 
felt 
himself 
secure 
against 
the 
indignities 
of 
its 
lesser 
functionaries, 
and 
in 
the 
possession 
of 
the 
fullest 
license 
to 
prosecute 
his 
researches 
and 
publish 
his 
discoveries, 
provided 
he 
avoided 
that 
dogma 
of 
the 
church 
which, 
even 
in 
the 
present 
day, 
it 
has 
not 
ventured 
to 
renounce. 
But 
Galileo 
was 
bound 
to 
the 
Romish 
hierarchy 
by 
even 
stronger 
ties. 
His 
son 
and 
himself 
were 
pensioners 
of 
the 
church, 
and, 
having 
accepted 
of 
its 
alms, 
they 
owed 
to 
it, 
at 
least, 
a 
decent 
and 
respectful 
allegiance. 
The 
pension 
thus 
given 
by 
Urban 
was 
not 
a 
remuneration 
which 
sovereigns 
sometimes 
award 
to 
the 
services 
of 
their 
subjects. 
Galileo 
was 
a 
foreigner 
at 
Rome. 
The 
sovereign 
of 
the 
papal 
state 
owed 
him 
no 
obligation; 
and 
hence 
we 
must 
regard 
the 
pension 
of 
Galileo 
as 
a 
donation 
from 
the 
Roman 
Pontiff 
to 
science 
itself, 
and 
as 
a 
declaration 
to 
the 
Christian 
world 
that 
religion 
was 
not 
jealous 
of 
philosophy, 
and 
that 
the 
church 
of 
Rome 
was 
willing 
to 
respect 
and 
foster 
even 
the 
genius 
of 
its 
enemies. 


Galileo 
viewed 
all 
these 
circumstances 
in 
a 
different 
light. 
He 
resolved 
to 
composeaworkin 
whichtheCopernicansystemshouldbe 
demonstrated; 
but 
he 
had 
not 
the 
courage 
to 
do 
this 
in 
a 
direct 
and 
open 
manner. 
He 
adopted 
the 
plan 
of 
discussing 
the 
subject 
in 
a 
dialogue 
between 
three 
speakers, 
in 
the 
hope 
of 
eluding 
by 
this 
artifice 
the 
censure 
of 
the 
church. 
This 
work 
was 
completed 
in 
1630, 
but, 
owing 
to 
some 
difficulties 
in 
obtaining 
a 
license 
to 
printit,it 
wasnotpublishedtill1632. 


In 
obtaining 
this 
license, 
Galileo 
exhibited 
considerable 
address, 
and 
his 
memory 
has 
not 
escaped 
from 
the 
imputation 
of 
having 
acted 
unfairly, 
and 
of 
havinginvolvedhispersonal 
friendsintheconsequencesofhisimprudence. 


The 
situation 
of 
master 
of 
the 
palace 
was, 
fortunately 
for 
Galileo’s 
designs, 
filled 
by 
Nicolo 
Riccardi, 
a 
friend 
and 
pupil 
of 
his 
own. 
This 
officer 
was 
a 
sort 
of 
censor 
of 
new 
publications, 
and 
when 
he 
was 
applied 
to 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
printing 
his 
work, 
Galileo 
soon 
found 
that 
attempts 
had 
previously 
been 
made 
to 
thwart 
his 
views. 
He 
instantly 
set 
off 
for 
Rome, 
and 
had 
an 
interview 
with 
his 
friend, 
who 
was 
in 
every 
respect 
anxious 
to 
oblige 
him. 
Riccardi 
examined 
the 
manuscript, 
pointed 
out 
some 
incautious 
expressions 
which 
he 
considered 
it 
necessary 
to 
erase, 
and 
returned 
it 
with 
his 
written 
approbation, 
on 
the 
understanding 
that 
the 
alterations 
he 
suggested 
would 
be 
made. 
Dreading 
to 
remain 
in 
Rome 
during 
the 
unhealthy 
season, 
which 
was 
fast 
approaching, 
Galileo 
returned 
to 
Florence, 
with 
the 
intention 
of 
completing 
the 
index 
and 
dedication, 
and 
of 
sending 
the 
MS. 
to 
Rome, 
to 
be 
printed 
under 
the 
care 
of 
Prince 
Cesi. 
The 
death 
of 
that 
distinguished 



individual, 
in 
August 
1630, 
frustrated 
Galileo’s 
plan, 
and 
he 
applied 
for 
leave 
to 
have 
the 
book 
printed 
in 
Florence. 
Riccardi 
was 
at 
first 
desirous 
to 
examine 
the 
MS. 
again, 
but, 
after 
inspecting 
only 
the 
beginning 
and 
the 
end 
of 
it, 
he 
gaveGalileo 
leave 
to 
printitwherever 
hechose, 
providingitborethe 
license 
of 
the 
Inquisitor-General 
of 
Florence, 
and 
one 
or 
two 
other 
persons 
whom 
henamed. 


Having 
overcome 
all 
these 
difficulties, 
Galileo’s 
work 
was 
published 
in 
1632, 
under 
the 
title 
of 
“The 
System 
of 
the 
World 
of 
Galileo 
Galilei, 
&c., 
in 
which, 
in 
four 
dialogues 
concerning 
the 
two 
principal 
systems 
of 
the 
world 


— 
the 
Ptolemaic 
and 
the 
Copernican 
— 
he 
discusses, 
indeterminately 
and 
firmly, 
the 
arguments 
proposed 
on 
both 
sides.” 
It 
is 
dedicated 
to 
Ferdinand, 
Grand 
Duke 
of 
Tuscany, 
and 
is 
prefaced 
by 
an 
“Address 
to 
the 
prudent 
reader,” 
which 
is 
itself 
characterised 
by 
the 
utmost 
imprudence. 
He 
refers 
to 
the 
decree 
of 
the 
Inquisition 
in 
the 
most 
insulting 
and 
ironical 
language. 
He 
attributes 
it 
to 
passion 
and 
to 
ignorance, 
not 
by 
direct 
assertion, 
but 
by 
insinuations 
ascribed 
to 
others; 
and 
he 
announces 
his 
intention 
to 
defend 
the 
Copernican 
system, 
as 
a 
pure 
mathematical 
hypothesis, 
and 
not 
as 
an 
opinion 
having 
an 
advantage 
over 
that 
of 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
earth 
absolutely. 
The 
dialogue 
is 
conducted 
by 
three 
persons, 
Salviati, 
Sagredo, 
and 
Simplicio. 
Salviati, 
who 
is 
the 
true 
philosopher 
in 
the 
dialogue, 
was 
the 
real 
name 
of 
a 
nobleman 
whom 
we 
have 
already 
had 
occasion 
to 
mention. 
Sagredo, 
the 
name 
of 
another 
noble 
friend 
of 
Galileo’s, 
performs 
a 
secondary 
part 
under 
Salviati. 
He 
proposes 
doubts, 
suggests 
difficulties, 
and 
enlivens 
the 
gravity 
of 
the 
dialogue 
with 
his 
wit 
and 
pleasantry. 
Simplicio 
is 
a 
resolute 
follower 
of 
Ptolemy 
and 
Aristotle, 
and, 
with 
a 
proper 
degree 
of 
candour 
and 
modesty, 
he 
brings 
forward 
all 
the 
common 
arguments 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
Ptolemaic 
system. 
Between 
the 
wit 
of 
Sagredo, 
and 
the 
powerful 
philosophy 
of 
Salviati, 
the 
peripatetic 
sage 
is 
baffled 
in 
every 
discussion; 
and 
there 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
that 
Galileo 
aimed 
a 
more 
fatal 
blow 
at 
the 
Ptolemaic 
system 
by 
this 
mode 
of 
discussingit,thanif 
hehad 
endeavouredtooverturnitbydirectarguments. 
The 
influence 
of 
this 
work 
on 
the 
public 
mind 
was 
such 
as 
might 
have 
been 
anticipated. 
The 
obnoxious 
doctrines 
which 
it 
upheld 
were 
eagerly 
received, 
and 
widely 
disseminated; 
and 
the 
church 
of 
Rome 
became 
sensible 
of 
the 
shock 
which 
was 
thus 
given 
to 
its 
intellectual 
supremacy. 
Pope 
Urban 
VIII., 
attached 
though 
he 
had 
been 
to 
Galileo, 
never 
once 
hesitated 
respecting 
the 
line 
of 
conduct 
which 
he 
felt 
himself 
bound 
to 
pursue. 
His 
mind 
was, 
nevertheless, 
agitated 
with 
conflicting 
sentiments. 
He 
entertained 
a 
sincere 



affection 
for 
science 
and 
literature, 
and 
yet 
he 
was 
placed 
in 
the 
position 
of 
their 
enemy. 
He 
had 
been 
the 
personal 
friend 
of 
Galileo, 
and 
yet 
his 
duty 
compelled 
him 
to 
become 
his 
accuser. 
Embarrassing 
as 
these 
feelings 
were, 
other 
considerations 
contributed 
to 
soothe 
him. 
He 
had, 
in 
his 
capacity 
of 
a 
Cardinal, 
opposed 
the 
first 
persecution 
of 
Galileo. 
He 
had, 
since 
his 
elevation 
to 
the 
pontificate, 
traced 
an 
open 
path 
for 
the 
march 
of 
Galileo’s 
discoveries; 
and 
he 
had 
finally 
endeavouredto 
bind 
the 
recusant 
philosopherby 
the 
chains 
of 
kindness 
and 
gratitude. 
All 
these 
means, 
however, 
had 
proved 
abortive, 
and 
he 
was 
now 
called 
upon 
to 
support 
the 
doctrine 
which 
he 
had 
subscribed, 
and 
administerthelawofwhichhewas 
theguardian. 


It 
has 
been 
supposed, 
without 
any 
satisfactory 
evidence, 
that 
Urban 
may 
have 
been 
influenced 
by 
less 
creditable 
motives. 
Salviati 
and 
Sagredo 
being 
well-known 
personages, 
it 
was 
inferred 
that 
Simplicio 
must 
also 
have 
a 
representative. 
The 
enemies 
of 
Galileo 
are 
said 
to 
have 
convinced 
his 
Holiness 
that 
Simplicio 
was 
intended 
as 
a 
portraiture 
of 
himself; 
and 
this 
opinion 
received 
some 
probability 
from 
the 
fact, 
that 
the 
peripatetic 
disputant 
had 
employed 
many 
of 
the 
arguments 
which 
Urban 
had 
himself 
used 
in 
his 
discussions 
with 
Galileo. 
The 
latest 
biographer 
of 
Galileo 
regards 
this 
motive 
as 
necessary 
to 
account 
for 
“the 
otherwise 
inexplicable 
change 
which 
took 
place 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
Urban 
to 
his 
old 
friend;” 
— 
but 
we 
cannot 
admit 
the 
truth 
of 
this 
supposition. 
The 
church 
had 
been 
placed 
in 
hostility 
to 
a 
powerful 
and 
liberal 
party, 
which 
was 
adverse 
to 
its 
interests. 
The 
dogmas 
of 
the 
Catholic 
faith 
had 
been 
brought 
into 
direct 
collision 
with 
the 
deductions 
of 
science. 
The 
leader 
of 
the 
philosophic 
band 
had 
broken 
the 
most 
solemn 
armistice 
with 
the 
Inquisition: 
he 
had 
renounced 
the 
ties 
of 
gratitude 
which 
bound 
him 
to 
the 
Pontiff; 
and 
Urban 
was 
thus 
compelled 
to 
entrench 
himself 
inapositiontowhichhehadbeendriven 
byhisopponents. 


The 
design 
of 
summoning 
Galileo 
before 
the 
Inquisition, 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
formed 
almost 
immediately 
after 
the 
publication 
of 
his 
book; 
for 
even 
in 
August 
1632, 
the 
preliminary 
proceedings 
had 
reached 
the 
ears 
of 
the 
Grand 
Duke 
Ferdinand. 
The 
Tuscan 
ambassador 
at 
Rome 
was 
speedily 
acquainted 
with 
the 
dissatisfaction 
which 
his 
Sovereign 
felt 
at 
these 
proceedings; 
and 
he 
was 
instructed 
to 
forward 
to 
Florence 
a 
written 
statement 
of 
the 
charges 
against 
Galileo, 
in 
order 
to 
enable 
him 
to 
prepare 
for 
his 
defence. 
Although 
this 
request 
was 
denied, 
Ferdinand 
again 
interposed, 
and 
transmitted 
a 
letter 
to 
his 
ambassador, 
recommending 
the 
admission 
of 
Campanella 
and 
Castelli 
into 
the 
congregation 
of 
ecclesiastics 
by 
whom 
Galileo 
was 
to 
be 
judged. 



Circumstances, 
however, 
rendered 
it 
prudent 
to 
withhold 
this 
letter. 
Castelli 
was 
sent 
away 
from 
Rome, 
and 
Scipio 
Chiaramonte, 
a 
bigotted 
ecclesiastic, 
was 
summonedfromPisatocompletethenumberof 
the 
judges. 


It 
appears 
from 
a 
despatch 
of 
the 
Tuscan 
minister, 
that 
Ferdinand 
was 
enraged 
at 
the 
transaction; 
and 
he 
instructed 
his 
ambassador, 
Niccolini, 
to 
make 
the 
strongest 
representations 
to 
the 
Pope. 
Niccolini 
had 
several 
interviews 
with 
his 
Holiness; 
but 
all 
his 
expostulations 
were 
fruitless. 
He 
found 
Urban 
highly 
incensed 
against 
Galileo; 
and 
his 
Holiness 
begged 
Niccolini 
to 
advise 
the 
Archduke 
not 
to 
interfere 
any 
farther, 
as 
he 
would 
not 
“get 
through 
it 
with 
honour.” 
On 
the 
15th 
of 
September 
the 
Pope 
caused 
it 
to 
be 
intimated 
to 
Niccolini, 
as 
a 
mark 
of 
his 
especial 
esteem 
for 
the 
Grand 
Duke, 
that 
he 
was 
obliged 
to 
refer 
the 
work 
to 
the 
Inquisition; 
but 
both 
the 
prince 
and 
his 
ambassador 
were 
declared 
liable 
to 
the 
usual 
censures 
if 
they 
divulged 
thesecret. 


From 
the 
measures 
which 
this 
tribunal 
had 
formerly 
pursued, 
it 
was 
not 
difficult 
to 
foresee 
the 
result 
of 
their 
present 
deliberations. 
They 
summoned 
Galileoto 
appear 
before 
thematRome, 
to 
answerin 
person 
thecharges 
under 
which 
he 
lay. 
The 
Tuscan 
ambassador 
expostulated 
warmly 
with 
the 
court 
of 
Rome 
on 
the 
inhumanity 
of 
this 
proceeding. 
He 
urged 
his 
advanced 
age, 
his 
infirm 
health, 
the 
discomforts 
of 
the 
journey, 
and 
the 
miseries 
of 
the 
quarantine, 
as 
motives 
for 
reconsidering 
their 
decision: 
But 
the 
Pope 
was 
inexorable, 
and 
though 
it 
was 
agreed 
to 
relax 
the 
quarantine 
as 
much 
as 
possible 
in 
his 
favour, 
yet 
it 
was 
declared 
indispensable 
that 
he 
should 
appear 
inpersonbeforetheInquisition. 


Worn 
out 
with 
age 
and 
infirmities, 
and 
exhausted 
with 
the 
fatigues 
of 
his 
journey, 
Galileo 
arrived 
at 
Rome 
on 
the 
14th 
of 
February, 
1633. 
The 
Tuscan 
ambassador 
announced 
his 
arrival 
in 
an 
official 
form 
to 
the 
commissary 
of 
the 
holy 
office, 
and 
Galileo 
awaited 
in 
calm 
dignity 
the 
approach 
of 
his 
trial. 
Among 
those 
who 
proffered 
their 
advice 
in 
this 
distressing 
emergency, 
we 
must 
enumerate 
the 
Cardinal 
Barberino, 
the 
Pope’s 
nephew, 
who, 
though 
he 
may 
have 
felt 
the 
necessity 
of 
an 
interference 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
church, 
was 
yet 
desirous 
that 
it 
should 
be 
effected 
with 
the 
least 
injury 
to 
Galileo 
and 
to 
science. 
He 
accordingly 
visited 
Galileo, 
and 
advised 
him 
to 
remain 
as 
much 
at 
home 
as 
possible, 
to 
keep 
aloof 
from 
general 
society, 
and 
to 
see 
only 
his 
most 
intimate 
friends. 
The 
same 
advice 
was 
given 
from 
different 
quarters; 
and 
Galileo, 
feeling 
its 
propriety, 
remained 
in 
strict 
seclusion 
in 
the 
palace 
of 
theTuscanambassador. 



During 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
trial 
which 
had 
now 
commenced, 
Galileo 
was 
treated 
with 
the 
most 
marked 
indulgence. 
Abhorring, 
as 
we 
must 
do, 
the 
principles 
and 
practice 
of 
this 
odious 
tribunal, 
and 
reprobatingits 
interference 
with 
the 
cautious 
deductions 
of 
science, 
we 
must 
yet 
admit 
that, 
on 
this 
occasion, 
its 
deliberations 
were 
not 
dictated 
by 
passion, 
nor 
its 
power 
directed 
by 
vengeance. 
Though 
placed 
at 
their 
judgment-seat 
as 
a 
heretic, 
Galileo 
stood 
there 
with 
the 
recognised 
attributes 
of 
a 
sage; 
and 
though 
an 
offender 
against 
the 
laws 
of 
which 
they 
were 
the 
guardian, 
yet 
the 
highest 
respect 
was 
yielded 
to 
his 
genius, 
and 
the 
kindest 
commiseration 
to 
his 
infirmities. 


In 
the 
beginning 
of 
April, 
when 
his 
examination 
in 
person 
was 
to 
commence, 
it 
became 
necessary 
that 
he 
should 
be 
removed 
to 
the 
holy 
office; 
but 
instead 
of 
committing 
him, 
as 
was 
the 
practice, 
to 
solitary 
confinement, 
he 
was 
provided 
with 
apartments 
in 
the 
house 
of 
the 
fiscal 
of 
the 
Inquisition. 
His 
table 
was 
provided 
by 
the 
Tuscan 
ambassador, 
and 
his 
servant 
was 
allowed 
to 
attend 
him 
at 
his 
pleasure, 
and 
to 
sleep 
in 
an 
adjoining 
apartment. 
Even 
this 
nominal 
confinement, 
however, 
Galileo’s 
high 
spirit 
was 
unable 
to 
brook. 
An 
attack 
of 
the 
disease 
to 
which 
he 
was 
constitutionally 
subject 
contributed 
to 
fret 
and 
irritate 
him, 
and 
he 
became 
impatient 
for 
a 
release 
from 
his 
anxiety 
as 
well 
as 
from 
his 
bondage. 
Cardinal 
Barberino 
seems 
to 
have 
received 
notice 
of 
the 
state 
of 
Galileo’s 
feelings, 
and, 
with 
a 
magnanimity 
which 
posterity 
will 
ever 
honour, 
he 
liberated 
the 
philosopher 
on 
his 
own 
responsibility; 
and 
in 
ten 
days 
after 
his 
first 
examination, 
and 
on 
the 
last 
day 
of 
April, 
he 
was 
restored 
to 
the 
hospitable 
roof 
of 
the 
Tuscan 
ambassador. 


Though 
this 
favour 
was 
granted 
on 
the 
condition 
of 
his 
remaining 
in 
strict 
seclusion, 
Galileo 
recovered 
his 
health, 
and 
to 
a 
certain 
degree 
his 
usual 
hilarity, 
amid 
the 
kind 
attentions 
of 
Niccolini 
and 
his 
family; 
and 
when 
the 
wantofexercisehad 
beguntoproduce 
symptoms 
ofindisposition,theTuscan 
minister 
obtained 
for 
him 
leave 
to 
go 
into 
the 
public 
gardens 
in 
a 
half-closed 
carriage. 


After 
the 
Inquisition 
had 
examined 
Galileo 
personally, 
they 
allowed 
him 
a 
reasonable 
time 
for 
preparing 
his 
defence. 
He 
felt 
the 
difficulty 
of 
adducing 
any 
thing 
like 
a 
plausible 
justification 
of 
his 
conduct; 
and 
he 
resorted 
to 
an 
ingenious, 
though 
a 
shallow 
artifice, 
which 
was 
regarded 
by 
the 
court 
as 
an 
aggravation 
of 
the 
crime. 
After 
his 
first 
appearance 
before 
the 
Inquisition 
in 
1616, 
he 
was 
publicly 
and 
falsely 
charged 
by 
his 
enemies 
with 
having 
then 



abjured 
his 
opinions; 
and 
he 
was 
taunted 
as 
a 
criminal 
who 
had 
been 
actually 
punished 
for 
his 
offences. 
As 
a 
refutation 
of 
these 
calumnies, 
Cardinal 
Bellarmine 
had 
given 
him 
a 
certificate 
in 
his 
own 
handwriting, 
declaring 
that 
he 
neither 
abjured 
his 
opinions, 
nor 
suffered 
punishment 
for 
them; 
and 
that 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
earth’s 
motion, 
and 
the 
sun’s 
stability, 
was 
only 
denounced 
to 
him 
as 
contrary 
to 
Scripture, 
and 
as 
one 
which 
could 
not 
be 
defended. 
To 
this 
certificate 
the 
Cardinal 
did 
not 
add, 
because 
he 
was 
not 
called 
upon 
to 
do 
it, 
that 
Galileo 
was 
enjoined 
not 
to 
teach 
in 
any 
manner 
the 
doctrine 
thus 
denounced; 
and 
Galileo 
ingeniously 
avails 
himself 
of 
this 
supposed 
omission, 
to 
account 
for 
his 
having, 
in 
the 
lapse 
of 
fourteen 
or 
sixteen 
years, 
forgotten 
the 
injunction. 
He 
assigned 
the 
same 
excuse 
for 
his 
having 
omitted 
to 
mention 
this 
injunction 
to 
Riccardi, 
and 
to 
the 
Inquisitor-
General 
at 
Florence, 
when 
he 
obtained 
the 
licence 
to 
print 
his 
Dialogues. 
The 
court 
held 
the 
production 
of 
this 
certificate 
to 
be 
at 
once 
a 
proof 
and 
an 
aggravation 
of 
his 
offence, 
because 
the 
certificate 
itself 
declared 
that 
the 
obnoxiousdoctrineshadbeenpronounced 
contrarytotheHoly 
Scriptures. 


Having 
duly 
weighed 
the 
confessions 
and 
excuses 
of 
their 
prisoner, 
and 
considered 
the 
general 
merits 
of 
the 
case, 
the 
Inquisition 
came 
to 
an 
agreement 
upon 
the 
sentence 
which 
they 
were 
to 
pronounce, 
and 
appointed 
the 
22d 
of 
June 
as 
the 
day 
on 
which 
it 
was 
to 
be 
delivered. 
Two 
days 
previous 
to 
this, 
Galileo 
was 
summoned 
to 
appear 
at 
the 
holy 
office; 
and 
on 
the 
morning 
of 
the 
21st, 
he 
obeyed 
the 
summons. 
On 
the 
22d 
of 
June 
he 
was 
clothed 
in 
a 
penitential 
dress, 
and 
conducted 
to 
the 
convent 
of 
Minerva, 
where 
the 
Inquisition 
was 
assembled 
to 
give 
judgment. 
A 
long 
and 
elaborate 
sentence 
was 
pronounced, 
detailing 
the 
former 
proceedings 
of 
the 
Inquisition, 
and 
specifying 
the 
offences 
which 
he 
had 
committed 
in 
teaching 
heretical 
doctrines, 
in 
violating 
his 
former 
pledges, 
and 
in 
obtaining 
by 
improper 
means 
a 
license 
for 
the 
printing 
of 
his 
Dialogues. 
After 
an 
invocation 
of 
the 
name 
of 
our 
Saviour, 
and 
of 
the 
Holy 
Virgin, 
Galileo 
is 
declared 
to 
have 
brought 
himself 
under 
strong 
suspicions 
of 
heresy, 
and 
to 
have 
incurred 
all 
the 
censures 
and 
penalties 
which 
are 
enjoined 
against 
delinquents 
of 
this 
kind; 
but 
from 
all 
these 
consequences 
he 
is 
to 
be 
held 
absolved, 
provided 
that 
with 
a 
sincere 
heart, 
and 
a 
faith 
unfeigned, 
he 
abjures 
and 
curses 
the 
heresies 
he 
has 
cherished, 
as 
wellas 
everyother 
heresy 
against 
the 
Catholic 
church. 
In 
order 
that 
his 
offence 
might 
not 
go 
altogether 
unpunished, 
that 
he 
might 
be 
more 
cautious 
in 
future, 
and 
be 
a 
warning 
to 
others 
to 
abstain 
from 
similar 
delinquencies, 
it 
was 
also 
decreed 
that 
his 
Dialogues 
should 
be 
prohibited 
by 



public 
edict; 
that 
he 
himself 
should 
be 
condemned 
to 
the 
prison 
of 
the 
Inquisition 
during 
their 
pleasure, 
and 
that, 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
next 
three 
years,heshouldrecite 
onceaweekthesevenpenitential 
psalms. 


The 
ceremony 
of 
Galileo’s 
abjuration 
was 
one 
of 
exciting 
interest, 
and 
of 
awful 
formality. 
Clothed 
in 
the 
sackcloth 
of 
a 
repentant 
criminal, 
the 
venerablesagefelluponhiskneesbeforetheassembledCardinals;andlaying 
his 
hands 
upon 
the 
Holy 
Evangelists, 
he 
invoked 
the 
Divine 
aid 
in 
abjuring 
and 
detesting, 
and 
vowing 
never 
again 
to 
teach, 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
earth’s 
motion, 
and 
of 
the 
sun’s 
stability. 
He 
pledged 
himself 
that 
he 
would 
never 
again, 
either 
in 
words 
or 
in 
writing, 
propagate 
such 
heresies; 
and 
he 
swore 
that 
he 
would 
fulfil 
and 
observe 
the 
penances 
which 
had 
been 
inflicted 
upon 
him. 
At 
the 
conclusion 
of 
this 
ceremony, 
in 
which 
he 
recited 
his 
abjuration 
word 
for 
word, 
and 
then 
signed 
it, 
he 
was 
conveyed, 
in 
conformity 
with 
his 
sentence, 
totheprison 
oftheInquisition. 


The 
account 
which 
we 
have 
now 
given 
of 
the 
trial 
and 
the 
sentence 
of 
Galileo, 
is 
pregnant 
with 
the 
deepest 
interest 
andinstruction. 
Human 
nature 
is 
here 
drawn 
in 
its 
darkest 
colouring; 
and 
in 
surveying 
the 
melancholy 
picture, 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
decide 
whether 
religion 
or 
philosophy 
has 
been 
most 
degraded. 
While 
we 
witness 
the 
presumptuous 
priest 
pronouncing 
infallible 
the 
decrees 
of 
his 
own 
erring 
judgment, 
we 
see 
the 
high-minded 
philosopher 
abjuring 
the 
eternal 
and 
immutable 
truths 
which 
he 
had 
himself 
the 
glory 
of 
establishing. 
In 
the 
ignorance 
and 
prejudices 
of 
the 
age 
— 
in 
a 
too 
literal 
interpretation 
of 
the 
language 
of 
Scripture 
— 
in 
a 
mistaken 
respect 
for 
the 
errors 
that 
had 
become 
venerable 
from 
their 
antiquity 
— 
and 
in 
the 
peculiar 
position 
which 
Galileo 
had 
taken 
among 
the 
avowed 
enemies 
of 
the 
church, 
we 
may 
find 
the 
elements 
of 
an 
apology, 
poor 
though 
it 
be, 
for 
the 
conduct 
of 
the 
Inquisition. 
But 
what 
excuse 
can 
we 
devise 
for 
the 
humiliating 
confession 
and 
abjuration 
of 
Galileo? 
Why 
did 
this 
master-spirit 
of 
the 
age 
— 
this 
high-
priest 
of 
the 
stars 
— 
this 
representative 
of 
science 
— 
this 
hoary 
sage, 
whose 
career 
of 
glory 
was 
near 
its 
consummation 
— 
why 
did 
he 
reject 
the 
crown 
of 
martyrdom 
which 
he 
had 
himself 
coveted, 
and 
which, 
plaited 
with 
immortal 
laurels, 
was 
about 
to 
descend 
upon 
his 
head? 
If, 
in 
place 
of 
disavowing 
the 
laws 
of 
Nature, 
and 
surrendering 
in 
his 
own 
person 
the 
intellectual 
dignity 
of 
his 
species, 
he 
had 
boldly 
asserted 
the 
truth 
of 
his 
opinions, 
and 
confided 
his 
character 
to 
posterity, 
and 
his 
cause 
to 
an 
all-ruling 
Providence, 
he 
would 
have 
strung 
up 
the 
hair-suspended 
sabre, 
and 
disarmed 
for 
ever 
the 
hostility 
which 
threatened 
to 
overwhelm 
him. 
The 
philosopher, 
however, 
was 



supported 
only 
by 
philosophy; 
and 
in 
the 
love 
of 
truth 
he 
found 
a 
miserable 
substitute 
for 
the 
hopes 
of 
the 
martyr. 
Galileo 
cowered 
under 
the 
fear 
of 
man, 
and 
his 
submission 
was 
the 
salvation 
of 
the 
church. 
The 
sword 
of 
the 
Inquisition 
descended 
on 
his 
prostrate 
neck; 
and 
though 
its 
stroke 
was 
not 
physical, 
yet 
it 
fell 
with 
a 
moral 
influence 
fatal 
to 
the 
character 
of 
its 
victim, 
and 
tothedignityof 
science. 


In 
studying 
with 
attention 
this 
portion 
of 
scientific 
history, 
the 
reader 
will 
not 
fail 
to 
perceive 
that 
the 
Church 
of 
Rome 
was 
driven 
into 
a 
dilemma, 
from 
which 
the 
submission 
and 
abjuration 
of 
Galileo 
could 
alone 
extricate 
it. 
He 
who 
confesses 
a 
crime 
and 
denounces 
its 
atrocity, 
not 
only 
sanctions 
but 
inflicts 
the 
punishment 
which 
is 
annexed 
to 
it. 
Had 
Galileo 
declared 
his 
innocence, 
and 
avowed 
his 
sentiments, 
and 
had 
he 
appealed 
to 
the 
past 
conduct 
of 
the 
Church 
itself, 
to 
the 
acknowledged 
opinions 
of 
its 
dignitaries, 
and 
even 
to 
the 
acts 
of 
its 
pontiffs, 
he 
would 
have 
at 
once 
confounded 
his 
accusers, 
and 
escaped 
from 
their 
toils. 
After 
Copernicus, 
himself 
a 
catholic 
priest, 
had 
openly 
maintained 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
earth, 
and 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
sun: 
— 
after 
he 
had 
dedicated 
the 
work 
which 
advocated 
these 
opinions 
to 
Pope 
Paul 
III., 
on 
the 
express 
ground 
that 
the 
authority 
of 
the 
pontiff 
might 
silence 
the 
calumnies 
of 
those 
who 
attacked 
these 
opinions 
by 
arguments 
drawn 
from 
Scripture: 
— 
after 
the 
Cardinal 
Schonberg 
and 
the 
Bishop 
of 
Culm 
had 
urged 
Copernicus 
to 
publish 
the 
new 
doctrines; 
— 
and 
after 
the 
Bishop 
of 
Ermeland 
had 
erected 
a 
monument 
to 
commemorate 
his 
great 
discoveries; 
— 
how 
could 
the 
Church 
of 
Rome 
have 
appealed 
to 
its 
pontifical 
decrees 
as 
the 
ground 
of 
persecuting 
and 
punishing 
Galileo? 
Even 
in 
later 
times, 
the 
same 
doctrines 
had 
been 
propagated 
with 
entire 
toleration: 
Nay, 
in 
the 
very 
year 
of 
Galileo’s 
first 
persecution, 
Paul 
Anthony 
Foscarinus, 
a 
learned 
Carmelite 
monk, 
wrote 
a 
pamphlet, 
in 
which 
he 
illustrates 
and 
defends 
the 
mobility 
of 
the 
earth, 
and 
endeavours 
to 
reconcile 
to 
this 
new 
doctrine 
the 
passages 
of 
Scripture 
which 
had 
been 
employed 
to 
subvert 
it. 
This 
very 
singular 
production 
was 
dated 
from 
the 
Carmelite 
convent 
at 
Naples; 
was 
dedicated 
to 
the 
very 
reverend 
Sebastian 
Fantoni, 
general 
of 
the 
Carmelite 
order; 
and, 
sanctioned 
by 
the 
ecclesiastical 
authorities, 
it 
was 
publishedat 
Naplesin1615, 
the 
veryyearof 
thefirstpersecutionofGalileo. 


Nor 
wasthistheonlydefenceoftheCopernicansystemwhichissuedfrom 
the 
bosom 
of 
the 
Church. 
Thomas 
Campanella, 
a 
Calabrian 
monk, 
published, 
in 
1622, 
“An 
Apology 
for 
Galileo,” 
and 
he 
even 
dedicates 
it 
to 
D. 
Boniface, 
Cardinal 
of 
Cajeta. 
Nay, 
it 
appears 
from 
the 
dedication, 
that 
he 
undertook 
the 



work 
at 
the 
command 
of 
the 
Cardinal, 
and 
that 
the 
examination 
of 
the 
question 
had 
been 
entrusted 
to 
the 
Cardinal 
by 
the 
Holy 
Senate. 
After 
an 
able 
defence 
of 
his 
friend, 
Campanella 
refers, 
at 
the 
conclusion 
of 
his 
apology, 
to 
the 
suppression 
of 
Galileo’s 
writings, 
and 
justly 
observes, 
that 
the 
effect 
of 
such 
a 
measure 
would 
be 
to 
make 
them 
more 
generally 
read, 
and 
more 
highly 
esteemed. 
The 
boldness 
of 
the 
apologist, 
however, 
is 
wisely 
tempered 
with 
the 
humility 
of 
the 
ecclesiastic, 
and 
he 
concludes 
his 
work 
with 
the 
declaration, 
that 
in 
all 
his 
opinions, 
whether 
written 
or 
to 
be 
written, 
he 
submits 
himself 
to 
the 
opinions 
of 
the 
Holy 
Mother 
Church 
of 
Rome 
and 
to 
thejudgmentofhis 
superiors. 


Bythese 
proceedingsofthe 
dignitaries, 
as 
well 
asthe 
clergy 
of 
the 
Church 
of 
Rome, 
whichhadbeen 
tolerated 
for 
more 
thana 
century, 
thedecrees 
of 
the 
pontiffs 
against 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
earth’s 
motion 
were 
virtually 
repealed; 
and 
Galileo 
might 
have 
pleaded 
them 
with 
success 
in 
arrest 
of 
judgment. 
Unfortunately, 
however, 
for 
himself 
and 
for 
science, 
he 
acted 
otherwise. 
By 
admitting 
their 
authority, 
he 
revived 
in 
fresh 
force 
these 
obsolete 
and 
obnoxious 
enactments; 
and, 
by 
yielding 
to 
their 
power, 
he 
riveted 
for 
another 
centurythealmostbroken 
chainsofspiritualdespotism. 


It 
is 
a 
curious 
fact 
in 
the 
annals 
of 
heresy 
and 
sedition, 
that 
opinions 
maintained 
with 
impunity 
by 
one 
individual, 
have, 
in 
the 
same 
age, 
brought 
others 
to 
the 
stake 
or 
to 
the 
scaffold. 
The 
results 
of 
deep 
research 
or 
extravagantspeculationseldom 
provokehostility,whenmeeklyannouncedas 
the 
deductions 
of 
reason 
or 
the 
convictions 
of

As 
the 
dreams 
of 
a 
recluse 
or 
of 
an 
enthusiast, 
they 
may 
excite 
pity 
or 
call 
forth 
contempt; 
but, 
like 
seed 
quietly 
cast 
into 
the 
earth, 
they 
will 
rot 
and 
germinate 
according 
to 
the 
vitality 
with 
which 
they 
are 
endowed. 
But, 
if 
new 
and 
startling 
opinions 
are 
thrown 
in 
the 
face 
of 
the 
community 
— 
if 
they 
are 
uttered 
in 
triumph 
or 
in 
insult 
— 
in 
contempt 
of 
public 
opinion, 
or 
in 
derision 
of 
cherished 
errors, 
they 
lose 
the 
comeliness 
of 
truth 
in 
the 
rancour 
of 
their 
propagation; 
and 
they 
are 
like 
seed 
scattered 
in 
a 
hurricane, 
which 
only 
irritates 
and 
blinds 
the 
husbandman. 
Had 
Galileo 
concluded 
his 
System 
of 
the 
World 
with 
the 
quiet 
peroration 
of 
his 
apologist 
Campanella, 
and 
dedicated 
it 
to 
the 
Pope, 
it 
might 
have 
stood 
in 
the 
library 
of 
the 
Vatican, 
beside 
the 
cherished 
though 
equally 
hereticalvolumeof 
Copernicus. 


In 
the 
abjuration 
of 
his 
opinions 
by 
Galileo, 
Pope 
Urban 
VII. 
did 
not 
fail 
to 
observe 
the 
full 
extent 
of 
his 
triumph; 
and 
he 
exhibited 
the 
utmost 
sagacity 
in 
the 
means 
which 
he 
employed 
to 
secure 
it. 
While 
he 
endeavoured 
to 



overawe 
the 
enemies 
of 
the 
church 
by 
the 
formal 
promulgation 
of 
Galileo’s 
sentence 
and 
abjuration, 
and 
by 
punishing 
the 
officials 
who 
had 
assisted 
in 
obtaining 
the 
license 
to 
print 
his 
work, 
he 
treated 
Galileo 
with 
the 
utmost 
lenity, 
and 
yielded 
to 
every 
request 
that 
was 
made 
to 
diminish, 
and 
almost 
suspend, 
the 
constraint 
under 
which 
he 
lay. 
The 
sentence 
of 
abjuration 
was 
ordered 
to 
be 
publicly 
read 
at 
several 
universities. 
At 
Florence 
the 
ceremonial 
was 
performed 
in 
the 
church 
of 
Santa 
Croce, 
and 
the 
friends 
and 
disciples 
of 
Galileo 
were 
especially 
summoned 
to 
witness 
the 
public 
degradation 
of 
their 
master. 
The 
inquisitor 
at 
Florence 
was 
ordered 
to 
be 
reprimanded 
for 
his 
conduct; 
and 
Riccardi, 
the 
master 
of 
the 
sacred 
palace, 
and 
Ciampoli, 
the 
secretaryofPope 
Urbanhimself,weredismissed 
from 
theirsituations. 


Galileohad 
remained 
only 
four 
days 
in 
theprison 
ofthe 
Inquisition, 
when, 
on 
the 
application 
of 
Niccolini, 
the 
Tuscan 
ambassador, 
he 
was 
allowed 
to 
reside 
with 
him 
in 
his 
palace. 
As 
Florence 
still 
suffered 
under 
the 
contagious 
disease 
which 
we 
have 
already 
mentioned, 
it 
was 
proposed 
that 
Sienna 
should 
bethe 
placeofGalileo’sconfinement,and 
thathisresidenceshouldbe 
in 
one 
of 
the 
convents 
of 
that 
city. 
Niccolini, 
however, 
recommended 
the 
palace 
of 
the 
Archbishop 
Piccolomoni 
as 
a 
more 
suitable 
residence; 
and 
though 
the 
Archbishop 
was 
one 
of 
Galileo’s 
best 
friends, 
the 
Pope 
agreed 
to 
the 
arrangement, 
and 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
July 
Galileo 
quitted 
Rome 
for 
Sienna. 


After 
having 
spent 
nearly 
six 
months 
under 
the 
hospitable 
roof 
of 
his 
friend, 
with 
no 
other 
restraint 
than 
that 
of 
being 
confined 
to 
the 
limits 
of 
the 
palace, 
Galileo 
was 
permitted 
to 
return 
to 
his 
villa 
near 
Florence 
under 
the 
same 
restrictions; 
and 
as 
the 
contagious 
disease 
had 
disappeared 
in 
Tuscany, 
he 
was 
able 
in 
the 
month 
of 
December 
to 
re-enter 
his 
own 
house 
at 
Arcetri, 
where 
hespentthe 
remainderof 
his 
days. 



CHAPTER 
VI. 


Galileo 
loses 
his 
favourite 
Daughter 
— 
He 
falls 
into 
a 
state 
of 
melancholy 
and 
ill 
health 
— 
Is 
allowed 
to 
go 
to 
Florence 
for 
its 
recovery 
in 
1638 
— 
But 
is 
prevented 
from 
leaving 
his 
House 
or 
receiving 
his 
Friends 
— 
His 
friend 
Castelli 
permitted 
to 
visit 
him 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
an 
Officer 
of 
the 
Inquisition 
— 
He 
composes 
his 
celebrated 
Dialogues 
on 
Local 
Motion 
— 
Discovers 
the 
Moon’s 
Libration 
— 
Loses 
the 
sight 
of 
one 
Eye 
— 
The 
other 
Eye 
attacked 
by 
the 
same 
Disease 
— 
Is 
struck 
blind 
— 
Negociates 
with 
the 
Dutch 
Government 
respecting 
his 
Method 
of 
finding 
the 
Longitude 
— 
He 
is 
allowed 


free 
intercourse 
with 
his 
Friends 
— 
His 
Illness 
and 
Death 
in 
1642 
— 
His 
Epitaph 
— 
His 
Social, 
Moral, 
and 
Scientific 
Character. 


Although 
Galileo 
had 
now 
the 
happiness 
of 
rejoining 
his 
family 
under 
their 
paternal 
roof, 
yet, 
like 
all 
sublunary 
blessings, 
it 
was 
but 
of 
short 
duration. 
His 
favourite 
daughter 
Maria, 
who 
along 
with 
her 
sister 
had 
joined 
the 
convent 
of 
St 
Matthew 
in 
the 
neighbourhood 
of 
Arcetri, 
had 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
arrival 
of 
her 
father 
with 
the 
most 
affectionate 
anticipations. 
She 
hoped 
that 
her 
filial 
devotion 
might 
form 
some 
compensation 
for 
the 
malignity 
of 
his 
enemies, 
and 
she 
eagerly 
assumed 
the 
labour 
of 
reciting 
weekly 
the 
seven 
penitentiary 
psalms 
which 
formed 
part 
of 
her 
father’s 
sentence. 
These 
sacred 
duties, 
however, 
were 
destined 
to 
terminate 
almost 
at 
the 
moment 
they 
were 
begun. 
She 
was 
seized 
with 
a 
fatal 
illness 
in 
the 
same 
month 
in 
which 
she 
rejoined 
her 
parent, 
and 
before 
the 
month 
of 
April 
she 
was 
no 
more. 
This 
heavy 
blow, 
so 
suddenly 
struck, 
overwhelmed 
Galileo 
in 
the 
deepest 
agony. 
Owing 
to 
the 
decline 
of 
his 
health, 
and 
the 
recurrence 
of 
his 
old 
complaints, 
he 
was 
unable 
to 
oppose 
to 
this 
mental 
suffering 
the 
constitutional 
energy 
of 
his 
mind. 
The 
bulwarks 
of 
his 
heart 
broke 
down, 
and 
a 
flood 
of 
grief 
desolated 
his 
manly 
and 
powerful 
mind. 
He 
felt, 
as 
he 
expressed 
it, 
that 
he 
was 
incessantly 
called 
by 
his 
daughter 
— 
his 
pulse 
intermitted 
— 
his 
heart 
was 
agitated 
with 
unceasing 
palpitations 
— 
his 
appetite 
entirely 
left 
him, 
and 
he 
considered 
his 
dissolution 
so 
near 
at 
hand, 
that 
he 
would 
not 
permit 
his 
son 
Vicenzo 
to 
set 
out 
upon 
a 
journey 
which 
he 
had 
contemplated. 


From 
this 
state 
of 
melancholy 
and 
indisposition, 
Galileo 
slowly, 
though 
partially, 
recovered, 
and, 
with 
the 
view 
of 
obtaining 
medical 
assistance, 
he 



requested 
leave 
to 
go 
to 
Florence. 
His 
enemies, 
however, 
refused 
this 
application, 
and 
he 
was 
given 
to 
understand 
that 
any 
additional 
importunities 
would 
be 
visited 
with 
a 
more 
vigilant 
surveillance. 
He 
remained, 
therefore, 
five 
years 
at 
Arcetri, 
from 
1634 
to 
1638, 
without 
any 
remission 
of 
his 
confinement, 
and 
pursuing 
his 
studies 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
a 
continued 
and 
generalindisposition. 


There 
is 
no 
reason 
to 
think 
that 
Galileo 
or 
his 
friends 
renewed 
their 
application 
to 
the 
Church 
of 
Rome; 
but, 
in 
1638, 
the 
Pope 
transmitted, 
through 
the 
Inquisitor 
Fariano, 
his 
permission 
that 
he 
might 
remove 
to 
Florence 
for 
the 
recovery 
of 
his 
health, 
on 
the 
condition 
that 
he 
should 
present 
himself 
at 
the 
office 
of 
the 
Inquisitor 
to 
learn 
the 
terms 
upon 
which 
this 
indulgence 
was 
granted. 
Galileo 
accepted 
of 
the 
kindness 
thus 
unexpectedly 
proffered. 
But 
the 
conditions 
upon 
which 
it 
was 
given 
were 
more 
severe 
than 
he 
expected. 
He 
was 
prohibited 
from 
leaving 
his 
house 
or 
admitting 
his 
friends; 
and 
so 
sternly 
was 
this 
system 
pursued, 
that 
he 
required 
a 
specialorderfor 
attendingmassduring 
passion 
week. 


The 
severity 
of 
this 
order 
was 
keenlyfelt 
byGalileo. 
While 
he 
remainedat 
Arcetri, 
his 
seclusion 
from 
the 
world 
would 
have 
been 
an 
object 
of 
choice, 
if 
it 
had 
not 
been 
the 
decree 
of 
a 
tribunal; 
but 
to 
be 
debarred 
from 
the 
conversation 
of 
his 
friends 
in 
Florence 
— 
in 
that 
city 
where 
his 
genius 
had 
been 
idolised, 
and 
where 
his 
fame 
had 
become 
immortal, 
was 
an 
aggravation 
of 
punishment 
which 
he 
was 
unable 
to 
bear. 
With 
his 
accustomed 
kindness, 
the 
Grand 
Duke 
made 
a 
strong 
representation 
on 
the 
subject 
to 
his 
ambassador 
at 
the 
Court 
of 
Rome. 
He 
stated 
that, 
from 
his 
great 
age 
and 
infirmities, 
Galileo’s 
career 
was 
near 
its 
close; 
that 
he 
possessed 
many 
valuable 
ideas, 
which 
the 
world 
might 
lose 
if 
they 
were 
not 
matured 
and 
conveyed 
to 
his 
friends; 
and 
that 
Galileo 
was 
anxious 
to 
make 
these 
communications 
to 
Father 
Castelli, 
who 
was 
then 
a 
stipendiary 
of 
the 
Court 
of 
Rome. 
The 
Grand 
Duke 
commanded 
his 
ambassador 
to 
see 
Castelli 
on 
the 
subject 
— 
to 
urge 
him 
to 
obtain 
leave 
from 
the 
Pope 
to 
spend 
a 
few 
months 
in 
Florence 
— 
and 
to 
supply 
him 
with 
money 
and 
every 
thing 
that 
was 
necessary 
for 
his 
journey. 
Influenced 
by 
this 
kind 
and 
liberal 
message, 
Castelli 
obtained 
an 
audience 
of 
the 
Pope, 
and 
requested 
leave 
to 
pay 
a 
visit 
to 
Florence. 
Urban 
instantly 
suspected 
the 
object 
of 
his 
journey; 
and, 
upon 
Castelli’s 
acknowledging 
that 
he 
could 
not 
possibly 
refrain 
from 
seeing 
Galileo, 
he 
received 
permission 
to 
visit 
him 
in 
the 
company 
of 
an 
officer 
of 



the 
Inquisition. 
Castelli 
accordingly 
went 
to 
Florence, 
and, 
a 
few 
months 
afterwards, 
Galileo 
wasorderedto 
returnto 
Arcetri. 


During 
Galileo’s 
confinement 
at 
Sienna 
and 
Arcetri, 
between 
1633 
and 
1638, 
his 
time 
was 
principally 
occupied 
in 
the 
composition 
of 
his 
“Dialogues 
on 
Local 
Motion,” 
in 
which 
he 
treats 
of 
the 
strength 
and 
cohesion 
of 
solid 
bodies, 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
uniform 
and 
accelerated 
motions, 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
projectiles, 
and 
of 
the 
centre 
of 
gravity 
of 
solids. 
This 
remarkable 
work, 
which 
was 
considered 
by 
its 
author 
as 
the 
best 
of 
his 
productions, 
was 
printed 
by 
Louis 
Elzevir, 
at 
Amsterdam, 
and 
dedicated 
to 
the 
Count 
de 
Noailles, 
the 
French 
ambassador 
at 
Rome. 
Various 
attempts 
to 
have 
it 
printed 
in 
Germany 
had 
failed; 
and, 
in 
order 
to 
save 
himself 
from 
the 
malignity 
of 
his 
enemies, 
he 
was 
obliged 
to 
pretend 
that 
the 
edition 
published 
in 
Holland 
had 
been 
printed 
fromaMS. 
entrustedto 
theFrench 
ambassador. 


Although 
Galileo 
had 
for 
a 
long 
time 
abandoned 
his 
astronomical 
studies, 
yet 
his 
attention 
was 
directed, 
about 
the 
year 
1636, 
to 
a 
curious 
appearance 
in 
the 
lunar 
disc, 
which 
is 
known 
by 
the 
name 
of 
the 
moon’s 
libration. 
When 
we 
examine 
with 
a 
telescope 
the 
outline 
of 
the 
moon, 
we 
observe 
that 
certain 
parts 
of 
her 
disc, 
which 
are 
seen 
at 
one 
time, 
are 
invisible 
at 
another. 
This 
change 
or 
libration 
is 
of 
four 
different 
kinds, 
viz. 
the 
diurnal 
libration, 
the 
libration 
in 
longitude, 
the 
libration 
in 
latitude, 
and 
the 
spheroidal 
libration. 
Galileo 
discovered 
the 
first 
of 
these 
kinds 
of 
libration, 
and 
appears 
to 
have 
had 
some 
knowledge 
of 
the 
second; 
but 
thethird 
wasdiscoveredby 
Hevelius, 
and 
the 
fourthbyLagrange. 


This 
curious 
discovery 
was 
the 
result 
of 
the 
last 
telescopic 
observations 
of 
Galileo. 
Although 
his 
right 
eye 
had 
for 
some 
years 
lost 
its 
power, 
yet 
his 
general 
vision 
was 
sufficiently 
perfect 
to 
enable 
him 
to 
carry 
on 
his 
usual 
researches. 
In 
1636, 
however, 
this 
affection 
of 
his 
eye 
became 
more 
serious; 
and, 
in 
1637, 
his 
left 
eye 
was 
attacked 
with 
the 
same 
disease. 
His 
medical 
friends 
at 
first 
supposed 
that 
cataractswere 
formedinthe 
crystalline 
lens, 
and 
anticipated 
a 
cure 
from 
the 
operation 
of 
couching. 
These 
hopes 
were 
fallacious. 
The 
disease 
turned 
out 
to 
be 
in 
the 
cornea, 
and 
every 
attempt 
to 
restore 
its 
transparency 
was 
fruitless. 
In 
a 
few 
months 
the 
white 
cloud 
covered 
the 
whole 
aperture 
of 
the 
pupil, 
and 
Galileo 
became 
totally 
blind. 
This 
sudden 
and 
unexpected 
calamity 
had 
almost 
overwhelmed 
Galileo 
and 
his 
friends. 
In 
writing 
to 
a 
correspondent 
he 
exclaims, 
“Alas! 
your 
dear 
friend 
and 
servant 
has 
become 
totally 
and 
irreparably 
blind. 
These 
heavens, 
this 
earth, 
this 
universe, 
which 
by 
wonderful 
observation 
I 
had 
enlarged 
a 



thousand 
times 
beyond 
the 
belief 
of 
past 
ages, 
are 
henceforth 
shrunk 
into 
the 
narrow 
space 
which 
I 
myself 
occupy. 
So 
it 
pleases 
God; 
it 
shall, 
therefore, 
please 
me 
also.” 
His 
friend, 
Father 
Castelli, 
deplores 
the 
calamity 
in 
the 
same 
tone 
of 
pathetic 
sublimity:— 
“The 
noblest 
eye,” 
says 
he, 
“which 
nature 
ever 
made, 
is 
darkened; 
an 
eye 
so 
privileged, 
and 
gifted 
with 
such 
rare 
powers, 
that 
it 
may 
truly 
be 
said 
to 
have 
seen 
more 
than 
the 
eyes 
of 
all 
that 
are 
gone, 
and 
tohaveopened 
theeyes 
ofallthataretocome.” 


Although 
Galileo 
had 
been 
thwarted 
in 
his 
attempt 
to 
introduce 
into 
the 
Spanish 
marine 
his 
new 
method 
of 
finding 
the 
longitude 
at 
sea, 
yet 
he 
never 
lost 
sight 
of 
an 
object 
to 
which 
he 
attached 
the 
highest 
importance. 
As 
the 
formation 
of 
correct 
tables 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
Jupiter’s 
satellites 
was 
a 
necessary 
preliminary 
to 
its 
introduction, 
he 
had 
occupied 
himself 
for 
twenty-
four 
years 
in 
observations 
for 
this 
purpose, 
and 
he 
had 
made 
considerable 
progress 
in 
this 
laborious 
task. 
After 
the 
publication 
of 
his 
“Dialogues 
on 
Motion,” 
in 
1636, 
he 
renewed 
his 
attempts 
to 
bring 
his 
method 
into 
actual 
use. 
Forthis 
purpose 
headdressedhimselftoLorenzo 
Real,who 
hadbeen 
the 
Dutch 
Governor-General 
in 
India, 
and 
offered 
the 
free 
use 
of 
his 
method 
to 
the 
States-General 
of 
Holland. 
The 
Dutch 
government 
received 
this 
proposal 
with 
an 
anxious 
desire 
to 
have 
it 
carried 
into 
effect. 
At 
the 
instigation 
of 
Constantine 
Huygens, 
the 
father 
of 
the 
illustrious 
Huygens, 
and 
the 
secretary 
to 
the 
Prince 
of 
Orange, 
they 
appointed 
commissioners 
to 
communicate 
with 
Galileo; 
and 
while 
they 
transmitted 
him 
a 
gold 
chain 
as 
a 
mark 
of 
their 
esteem, 
they 
at 
the 
same 
time 
assured 
him, 
that 
if 
his 
plan 
should 
prove 
successful 
it 
should 
not 
pass 
unrewarded. 
The 
commissioners 
entered 
into 
an 
active 
correspondence 
with 
Galileo, 
and 
had 
even 
appointed 
one 
of 
their 
number 
to 
communicate 
personally 
with 
him 
in 
Italy. 
Lest 
this, 
however, 
should 
excite 
the 
jealousy 
of 
the 
court 
of 
Rome, 
Galileo 
objected 
to 
the 
arrangement, 
so 
that 
the 
negociation 
was 
carried 
on 
solely 
by 
correspondence. 


It 
was 
at 
this 
time 
that 
Galileo 
was 
struck 
with 
blindness. 
His 
friend 
and 
pupil, 
Renieri, 
undertook 
in 
this 
emergency 
to 
arrange 
and 
complete 
his 
observations 
and 
calculations; 
but 
before 
he 
had 
made 
much 
progress 
in 
the 
arduous 
task, 
each 
of 
the 
four 
commissioners 
died 
in 
succession, 
and 
it 
was 
with 
great 
difficulty 
that 
Constantine 
Huygens 
succeeded 
in 
renewing 
the 
scheme. 
It 
was 
again 
obstructed, 
however, 
by 
the 
death 
of 
Galileo; 
and 
when 
Renieri 
was 
about 
to 
publish, 
by 
the 
order 
of 
the 
Grand 
Duke, 
the 
“Ephemeris,” 
and 
“Tables 
of 
the 
Jovian 
Planets,” 
he 
was 
attacked 
with 
a 



mortal 
disease, 
and 
the 
manuscripts 
of 
Galileo, 
which 
he 
was 
on 
the 
eve 
of 
publishing, 
were 
never 
more 
heard 
of. 
By 
such 
a 
series 
of 
misfortunes 
were 
the 
plans 
of 
Galileo 
and 
of 
the 
States-General 
completely 
overthrown. 
It 
is 
some 
consolation, 
however, 
to 
know 
that 
neither 
science 
nor 
navigation 
suffered 
any 
severe 
loss. 
Notwithstanding 
the 
perfection 
of 
our 
present 
tables 
of 
Jupiter’s 
satellites, 
and 
of 
the 
astronomical 
instruments 
by 
which 
their 
eclipses

Inconsequenceofthestrictseclusion 
towhich 
Galileo 
hadbeensubjected, 
he 
was 
in 
the 
practice 
of 
dating 
his 
letters 
from 
his 
prison 
at 
Arcetri; 
but 
after 
he 
had 
lost 
the 
use 
of 
his 
eyes, 
the 
Inquisition 
seems 
to 
have 
relaxed 
its 
severity, 
and 
to 
have 
allowed 
him 
the 
freest 
intercourse 
with 
his 
friends. 
The 
Grand 
Duke 
of 
Tuscany 
paid 
him 
frequent 
visits; 
and 
among 
the 
celebrated 
strangers 
who 
came 
from 
distant 
lands 
to 
see 
the 
ornament 
of 
Italy, 
were 
Gassendi, 
Deodati, 
and 
our 
illustrious 
countryman 
Milton. 
During 
the 
last 
three 
years 
of 
his 
life, 
his 
eminent 
pupil 
Viviani 
formed 
one 
of 
his 
family; 
and 
in 
October 
1641, 
the 
celebrated 
Torricelli, 
another 
of 
his 
pupils, 
was 
admittedtothe 
same 
distinction. 


Though 
the 
powerful 
mind 
of 
Galileo 
still 
retained 
its 
vigour, 
yet 
his 
debilitated 
frame 
was 
exhausted 
with 
mental 
labour. 
He 
often 
complained 
that 
his 
head 
was 
too 
busy 
for 
his 
body; 
and 
the 
continuity 
of 
his 
studies 
was 
frequently 
broken 
with 
attacks 
of 
hypochondria, 
want 
of 
sleep, 
and 
acute 
rheumatic 
pains. 
Along 
with 
these 
calamities, 
he 
was 
afflicted 
with 
another 
still 
more 
severe 
— 
with 
deafness 
almost 
total; 
but 
though 
he 
was 
now 
excluded 
from 
all 
communication 
with 
the 
external 
world, 
yet 
his 
mind 
still 
grappled 
with 
the 
material 
universe, 
and 
while 
he 
was 
studying 
the 
force 
of 
percussion, 
and 
preparing 
for 
a 
continuation 
of 
his 
“Dialogues 
on 
Motion,” 
he 
was 
attacked 
with 
fever 
and 
palpitation 
of 
the 
heart, 
which, 
after 
continuing 
two 
months, 
terminated 
fatally 
on 
the 
8th 
of 
January 
1642, 
in 
the 
78thyear 
ofhisage. 


Having 
died 
in 
the 
character 
of 
a 
prisoner 
of 
the 
Inquisition, 
this 
odious 
tribunal 
disputed 
his 
right 
of 
making 
a 
will, 
and 
of 
being 
buried 
in 
consecrated 
ground. 
These 
objections, 
however, 
were 
withdrawn; 
but 
though 
a 
large 
sum 
was 
subscribed 
for 
erecting 
a 
monument 
to 
him 
in 
the 
church 
of 
Santa 
Croce, 
in 
Florence, 
the 
Pope 
would 
not 
permit 
the 
design 
to 
be 
carried 
into 
execution. 
His 
sacred 
remains 
were, 
therefore, 
deposited 
in 
an 
obscure 
corner 
of 
the 
church, 
and 
remained 
for 
more 
than 
thirty 
years 
unmarked 
with 
any 
monumental 
tablet. 
The 
following 
epitaph, 
given 
without 
any 
remark 
in 



the 
Leyden 
edition 
of 
his 
Dialogues, 
is, 
we 
presume, 
the 
one 
which 
was

At 
his 
death, 
in 
1703, 
Viviani 
purchased 
his 
property, 
with 
the 
charge 
of 
erecting 
a 
monument 
over 
Galileo’s 
remains 
and 
his 
own. 
This 
design 
was 
not 
carried 
into 
effect 
till 
1737, 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
family 
of 
Nelli, 
when 
both 
their 
bodies 
were 
disinterred, 
and 
removed 
to 
the 
site 
of 
the 
splendid 
monument 
which 
now 
covers 
them. 
This 
monument 
contains 
the 
bust 
of 
Galileo, 
with 
figures 
of 
Geometry 
and 
Astronomy. 
It 
was 
designed 
by 
Giulio 
Foggini. 
Galileo’s 
bust 
was 
executed 
by 
Giovanni 
Battista 
Foggini; 
the 
figure 
of 
Astronomy 
by 
Vincenzio 
Foggini, 
his 
son; 
and 
that 
of 
Geometry 
by 
GirolamoTicciati. 


Galileo’s 
house 
at 
Arcetri 
still 
remains. 
In 
1821 
it 
belonged 
to 
one 
Signor 
Alimari, 
having 
been 
preserved 
in 
the 
state 
in 
which 
it 
was 
left 
by 
Galileo; 
it 
stands 
very 
near 
the 
convent 
of 
St 
Matthew, 
and 
about 
a 
mile 
to 
the 
S. 
E. 
of 
Florence. 
An

The 
character 
of 
Galileo, 
whether 
we 
view 
him 
as 
a 
member 
of 
the 
social 
circle,or 
as 
aman 
of 
science, 
presents 
manyinteresting 
and 
instructive 
points 
of 
contemplation. 
Unfortunate, 
and 
to 
a 
certain 
extent 
immoral, 
in 
his 
domestic 
relations, 
he 
did 
not 
derive 
from 
that 
hallowed 
source 
all 
the 
enjoyments 
which 
it 
generally 
yields; 
and 
it 
was 
owing 
to 
this 
cause, 
perhaps, 
that 
he 
was 
more 
fond 
of 
society 
than 
might 
have 
been 
expected 
from 
his 
studious 
habits. 
His 
habitual 
cheerfulness 
and 
gaiety, 
and 
his 
affability 
and 
frankness 
of 
manner, 
rendered 
him 
an 
universal 
favourite 
among 
his 
friends. 
Without 
any 
of 
the 
pedantry 
of 
exclusive 
talent, 
and 
without 
any 
of 
that 
ostentation 
which 
often 
marks 
the 
man 
of 
limited 
though 
profound 
acquirements, 
Galileo 
never 
conversed 
upon 
scientific 
or 
philosophical 
subjects 
except 
among 
those 
who 
were 
capable 
of 
understanding 
them. 
The 
extent 
of 
his 
general 
information, 
indeed, 
his 
great 
literary 
knowledge, 
but, 
above 
all, 
his 
retentive 
memory, 
stored 
with 
the 
legends 
and 
the 
poetry 
of 
ancienttimes,savedhim 
from 
the 
necessityofdrawinguponhisown 
peculiar 
studiesforthetopicsofhisconversation. 


Galileo 
was 
not 
less 
distinguished 
for 
his 
hospitality 
and 
benevolence; 
he 
was 
liberal 
to 
the 
poor, 
and 
generous 
in 
the 
aid 
which 
he 
administered 
to 
men 
of 
genius 
and 
talent, 
who 
often 
found 
a 
comfortable 
asylum 
under 
his 
roof. 
In 
his 
domestic 
economy 
he 
was 
frugal 
without 
being 
parsimonious. 
His 
hospitable 
board 
was 
ever 
ready 
for 
the 
reception 
of 
his 
friends; 
and, 
though 
he 
was 
himself 
abstemious 
in 
his 
diet, 
he 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
a 
lover 
of 
good 



wines, 
of 
which 
he 
received 
always 
the 
choicest 
varieties 
out 
of 
the 
Grand 
Duke’s 
cellar. 
This 
peculiar 
taste, 
together 
with 
his 
attachment 
to 
a 
country 
life, 
rendered 
him 
fond 
of 
agricultural 
pursuits, 
and 
induced 
him 
to 
devote 
his 
leisurehoursto 
the 
cultivationofhisvineyards. 


In 
his 
personal 
appearance 
Galileo 
was 
about 
the 
middle 
size, 
and 
of 
a 
square-built, 
but 
well-proportioned, 
frame. 
His 
complexion 
was 
fair, 
his 
eyes 
penetrating, 
and 
his 
hair 
of 
a 
reddish 
hue. 
His 
expression 
was 
cheerful 
and 
animated, 
and 
though 
his 
temper 
was 
easily 
ruffled, 
yet 
the 
excitement 
was 
transient, 
andthecauseofitspeedily 
forgotten. 


One 
of 
the 
most 
prominent 
traits 
in 
the 
character 
of 
Galileo 
was 
his 
invincible 
love 
of 
truth, 
and 
his 
abhorrence 
of 
that 
spiritual 
despotism 
which 
had 
so 
long 
brooded 
over 
Europe. 
His 
views, 
however, 
were 
too 
liberal, 
and 
too 
far 
in 
advance 
of 
the 
age 
which 
he 
adorned; 
and 
however 
much 
we 
may 
admire 
the 
noble 
spirit 
which 
he 
evinced, 
and 
the 
personal 
sacrifices 
which 
he 
made, 
in 
his 
struggle 
for 
truth, 
we 
must 
yet 
lament 
the 
hotness 
of 
his 
zeal 
and 
the 
temerity 
of 
his 
onset. 
In 
his 
contest 
with 
the 
Church 
of 
Rome, 
he 
fell 
under 
her 
victorious 
banner; 
and 
though 
his 
cause 
was 
that 
of 
truth, 
and 
hers 
that 
of 
superstition, 
yet 
the 
sympathy 
of 
Europe 
was 
not 
roused 
by 
his 
misfortunes. 
Under 
the 
sagacious 
and 
peaceful 
sway 
of 
Copernicus, 
astronomy 
had 
effected 
a 
glorious 
triumph 
over 
the 
dogmas 
of 
the 
Church; 
but 
under 
the 
bold 
and 
uncompromising 
sceptre 
of 
Galileo 
all 
her 
conquests 
wereirrecoverablylost. 


The 
scientific 
character 
of 
Galileo, 
and 
his 
method 
of 
investigating 
truth, 
demand 
our 
warmest 
admiration. 
The 
number 
and 
ingenuity 
of 
his 
inventions, 
the 
brilliant 
discoveries 
which 
he 
made 
in 
the 
heavens, 
and 
the 
depthand 
beautyofhis 
researches 
respecting 
the 
lawsofmotion,have 
gained 
him 
the 
admiration 
of 
every 
succeeding 
age, 
and 
have 
placed 
him 
next 
to 
Newton 
in 
the 
lists 
of 
original 
and 
inventive 
genius. 
To 
this 
high 
rank 
he 
was 
doubtless 
elevated 
by 
the 
inductive 
processes 
which 
he 
followed 
in 
all 
his 
inquiries. 
Under 
the 
sure 
guidance 
of 
observation 
and 
experiment, 
he 
advanced 
to 
general 
laws; 
and 
if 
Bacon 
had 
never 
lived, 
the 
student 
of 
nature 
Would 
have 
found, 
in 
the 
writings 
and 
labours 
of 
Galileo, 
not 
only 
the 
boasted 
principles 
of 
the 
inductive 
philosophy, 
but 
also 
their 
practical 
applicationto 
the

THE 
TRIAL 
OF 
GALILEO 
by 
A. 
Mézières 



From 
‘The 
Popular 
Science 
Monthly’, 
February, 
1877 


MANY 
points 
have 
been 
left 
obscure 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
double 
trial 
of 
Galileo, 
the 
details 
of 
which 
till 
lately 
were 
but 
imperfectly 
known. 
The 
important 
work 
published 
by 
Domenico 
Berti 
fills 
up 
some 
of 
these 
gaps, 
by 
placing 
before 
our 
eyes 
a 
collection 
of 
authentic 
documents 
taken 
from 
the 
secret 
archives 
of 
the 
Vatican. 
We 
have 
here 
no 
work 
of 
partisanship, 
undertaken 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
religious 
controversy, 
but 
an 
historical 
work 
executed 
with 
all 
the 
scrupulous 
care 
that 
is 
nowadays 
exacted 
in 
all 
historical 
researches. 
In 
France 
the 
question 
had 
already 
been 
handled 
by 
Libri, 
Biot, 
Joseph 
Bertrand, 
Trouessart, 
and 
Th. 
Henri 
Martin, 
the 
first 
two 
approaching 
it 
with 
preconceived 
opinions 
that 
aided 
but 
little 
in 
the 
discoveryofthetruth,while 
theothersbroughttothediscussionaremarkable 
spirit 
of 
impartiality. 
But 
all 
of 
these 
writers 
lacked 
the 
indispensable 
elements 
of 
information 
which 
now, 
thanks 
to 
the 
labors 
of 
Domenico 
Berti, 
are 
at 
the 
disposal 
of 
the 
future 
biographers 
of 
Galileo. 
If 
we 
have 
suffered 
ourselves 
to 
be 
anticipated 
by 
an 
Italian 
in 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
documents 
relatingtothisfamouscase, 
we 
mustattributethefact 
eitherto 
thenegligence 
or 
to 
the 
prudence 
of 
the 
French 
Government, 
for 
we 
were 
in 
possession, 
for 
nearly 
half 
a 
century, 
of 
the 
valuable 
manuscript 
the 
full 
text 
of 
which 
is 
now 
published 
by 
Berti. 
Having 
been 
taken 
out 
of 
the 
Vatican 
archives 
during 
the 
first 
empire 
and 
carried 
to 
Paris, 
this 
original 
collection 
was 
there 
seen 
by 
the 
historian 
Denina, 
but 
he 
thought 
it 
to 
be 
of 
no 
importance. 
Nevertheless 
Napoleon 
I. 
ordered 
it 
to 
be 
published, 
with 
a 
translation 
facing 
the 
text; 
but 
the 
publication, 
though 
begun, 
was 
not 
continued: 
only 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
work 
was 
then 
known, 
and 
of 
this 
Delambre, 
the 
astronomer,gave 
an 
account 
totheItalian 
Venturi. 


In 
December, 
1814, 
according 
to 
the 
Duke 
de 
Blacas, 
the 
private 
library 
of 
Louis 
XVIII. 
received 
the 
entire 
MS. 
in 
the 
same 
condition 
in 
which 
it 
had 
been 
found 
by 
the 
imperial 
government 
in 
Italy, 
and 
thence 
carried 
to 
France. 
During 
the 
early 
years 
of 
the 
Restoration, 
active 
negotiations 
were 
carried 
on 
by 
the 
court 
of 
Rome 
with 
the 
French 
Government, 
to 
secure 
the 
return 
of 
these 
important 
documents. 
The 
Government, 
though 
it 
did 
not 
positively 



refuse 
to 
comply, 
nevertheless 
delayed 
and 
procrastinated. 
It 
was 
not 
until 
1846, 
after 
thirty-two 
years 
of 
negotiation, 
that 
the 
MS. 
was 
sent 
back 
to 
Rome, 
at 
the 
instance, 
no 
doubt, 
of 
Rossi, 
who 
himself 
presented 
it 
to 
Pius 
IX., 
in 
behalf 
of 
Louis 
Philippe. 
By 
the 
pope 
it 
was 
restored 
in 
December, 
1848,tothesecretarchivesoftheVatican,andthereitstillremains. 


All 
that 
was 
known 
of 
this 
MS. 
before 
the 
publication 
of 
Berti’s 
work 
rested 
upon 
a 
selection 
of 
documents 
published 
at 
Rome 
in 
1850, 
with 
many 
precautions, 
by 
Monsignore 
Marino 
Marini, 
sometime 
Prefect 
of 
the 
Secret 
Archives 
of 
the 
Holy 
See, 
and 
upon 
a 
larger 
work, 
in 
some 
respects 
inexact, 
and 
in 
others 
imperfect, 
published 
in 
Paris 
in 
1867, 
by 
Henri 
de 
l’Épinois. 
Both 
of 
these 
writers 
take 
special 
points 
of 
view: 
they 
appear 
to 
be 
more 
intent 
upon 
justifying 
the 
judges 
that 
condemned 
Galileo 
than 
upon 
laying 
bare 
the 
whole 
truth 
with 
the 
boldness 
and 
freedom 
of 
an 
historian. 
Hence 
we 
can 
appreciate 
the 
motives 
which 
led 
them 
to 
publish 
only 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
MS. 
though 
the 
whole 
of 
it 
was 
in 
their 
hands. 
Did 
the 
court 
of 
Rome 
really 
suppose 
that 
these 
two 
publications 
contained 
all 
the 
documents 
pertaining 
to 
thedouble 
trial 
of 
Galileo, 
or 
did 
itthink 
that 
the 
timehad 
come 
for 
no 
longer 
hiding 
anything 
from 
the 
public? 
However 
that 
may 
be, 
at 
all 
events 
Domenico 
Berti, 
in 
February, 
1870, 
was 
permitted 
to 
examine 
the 
MS., 
and 
even 
to 
copy 
it 
at 
his 
leisure 
in 
the 
room 
of 
Father 
Theiner, 
who 
had 
been 
officially 
authorized 
to 
intrust 
it 
to 
him. 
The 
present 
publication, 
therefore, 
was 
not 
procured 
by 
fraud, 
and, 
if 
the 
Holy 
See 
should 
have 
any 
occasion 
to 
regret 
it, 
at 
least 
it 
could 
neither 
dispute 
its 
authenticity, 
nor 
complain 
that 
the 
workwas 
donewithoutitsconsent. 


I. 


The 
interesting 
history 
of 
the 
travels 
and 
of 
the 
final 
destiny 
of 
the 
Vatican 
MS. 
is 
merely 
the 
preface 
of 
a 
far 
more 
important 
history, 
whose 
events 
we 
will 
endeavor 
to 
record 
impartially, 
with 
the 
sole 
purpose 
of 
unveiling 
and 
bringing 
to 
light 
the 
truth. 
Galileo, 
celebrated 
from 
his 
early 
years 
for 
the 
value 
of 
his 
discoveries 
and 
the 
brilliancy 
of 
his 
lectures 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Padua,loadedwith 
honorsatVeniceandat 
Florence,andadmired 
throughout 
all 
Italy, 
was 
pursuing 
the 
course 
of 
his 
great 
researches 
with 
the 
boldness 
of 
a 
man 
confident 
of 
his 
strength 
and 
of 
his 
fame, 
when 
certain 
slight 
indications 
no 
doubt 
warned 
him 
that 
it 
would 
not 
be 
disadvantageous, 
if 
he 
would 
carry 
on 
his 
researches 
in 
safety, 
to 
win 
the 
favor 
of 
the 
Sacred 



College. 
Accordingly 
he 
set 
out 
in 
1611 
for 
the 
Eternal 
City, 
without 
confessed 
misgiving, 
but 
with 
the 
ambition 
and 
expectation 
of 
interesting 
the 
most 
influential 
personages 
of 
the 
Roman 
court 
in 
his 
discoveries. 
He 
was 
nearing 
the 
decisive 
moment 
of 
his 
career. 
He 
had 
not 
as 
yet 
been 
disquieted 
by 
the 
objections 
of 
the 
theologians, 
though 
in 
prosecuting 
his 
studies 
of 
the 
constitutionof 
theuniversehewastouchingupon 
delicatequestions 
whichhe 
could 
not 
expect 
to 
be 
permitted 
to 
discuss 
freely, 
without 
having 
first 
gained 
the 
sympathy, 
or 
at 
least 
the 
neutrality, 
of 
the 
Church. 
The 
court 
of 
Rome 
at 
that 
time 
exercised 
such 
moral 
authority 
in 
Italy, 
and 
especially 
at 
Florence, 
where 
Galileo 
resided, 
that 
people 
in 
some 
sense 
waited 
for 
her 
decision 
before 
they 
would 
accept 
the 
best-established 
conclusions 
in 
astronomy. 
The 
Grand-duke 
of 
Tuscany 
could 
not 
but 
be 
pleased 
at 
the 
discovery 
of 
Jupiter’s 
satellites, 
announced 
in 
the 
“Sidereus 
Nuncius;” 
and 
he 
was 
all 
the 
more 
ready 
to 
believe, 
because 
these 
new 
heavenly 
bodies 
had 
received 
his 
family 
name: 
yet 
his 
own 
secretary 
had 
to 
admit 
that 
the 
discovery 
would 
never 
receive 
the 
unanimous 
assent 
of 
the 
learned 
world 
until 
it 
was 
approved 
and 
verified 
at 
Rome. 
There 
sat 
the 
Roman 
College, 
a 
regular 
tribunal, 
scientific 
aswell 
astheological, 
whosedecreeswerelaw 
inCatholic 
countries. 


Galileo, 
who 
was 
a 
man 
of 
rare 
good 
sense, 
and 
perfectly 
conversant 
with 
the 
ways 
of 
the 
world, 
had 
in 
advance 
formed 
at 
Rome 
the 
best 
and 
the 
most 
powerful 
of 
relations. 
Besides, 
he 
came 
there 
in 
a 
sort 
of 
official 
capacity, 
at 
the 
grand-duke’s 
charges, 
and 
he 
was 
entertained 
there 
by 
the 
Tuscan 
embassador. 
Prelates, 
cardinals, 
princes, 
vied 
with 
one 
another 
for 
the 
honor 
of 
offering 
fétes 
and 
banquets 
to 
the 
most 
illustrious 
representative 
of 
Italian 
science. 
At 
the 
palace 
of 
Cardinal 
Bandini, 
in 
the 
beautiful 
gardens 
of 
the 
Quirinal, 
in 
the 
villa 
of 
the 
Marquis 
Cesi 
on 
the 
summit 
of 
the 
Janiculan, 
Galileo 
delighted 
a 
society 
of 
élite 
by 
having 
them 
contemplate, 
during 
the 
serene 
nights 
of 
April, 
the 
vault 
of 
heaven 
through 
the 
telescope 
which 
he 
had 
recently 
invented, 
and 
which 
bears 
his 
name. 
He 
awakened 
a 
genuine 
enthusiasm 
one 
day 
when, 
after 
dinner, 
he 
pointed 
his 
telescope 
toward 
St. 
John 
of 
Lateran, 
three 
miles 
distant, 
and 
enabled 
the 
guests 
to 
read 
the 
inscription 
uponthefaçadeofthatbasilica. 


His 
arguments 
did 
not 
equally 
convince 
all 
of 
those 
who 
were 
present 
at 
his 
astronomical 
observations, 
and 
who 
listened 
to 
the 
explanation 
he 
gave 
of 
the 
movement 
of 
Jupiter’s 
four 
satellites, 
the 
inequalities 
of 
the 
moon’s 
surface, 
and 
thephases 
of 
Venus 
andSaturn,and 
to 
the 
discussions 
he 
carried 
on 
with 
those 
who 
opposed 
his 
views. 
His 
doctrine 
implied 
the 
confirmation 



of 
the 
system 
of 
Copernicus 
and 
the 
demonstration 
of 
the 
earth’s 
motion, 
which 
were 
no 
longer 
reserved 
for 
mathematicians 
only, 
but 
made 
intelligible 
to 
all 
by 
a 
series 
of 
experiments. 
Here 
was 
an 
innovation 
calculated 
to 
alarm 
the 
theologians. 
A 
system 
that 
might 
be 
regarded 
as 
inoffensive 
so 
long 
as 
it 
was 
only 
a 
mathematical 
hypothesis, 
useful 
to 
men 
of 
science 
in 
their 
researches, 
became 
a 
very 
different 
thing 
on 
being 
transformed 
into 
a 
physical 
truth 
accessible 
to 
the 
senses 
and 
pregnant 
with 
consequences 
touching 
the 
plurality 
of 
worlds 
and 
the 
aim 
of 
creation. 
Hence 
the 
apparent 
triumph 
of 
Galileo 
hid 
from 
view 
perils 
the 
magnitude 
of 
which 
at 
first 
eluded 
his 
penetrating 
mind. 
While 
he 
was 
giving 
himself 
up, 
with 
perhaps 
over-much 
confidence, 
to 
the 
pleasure 
of 
success, 
and 
was 
yielding 
too 
easily 
to 
his 
habitual 
temptation 
to 
answer 
objections 
with 
sarcasm, 
the 
ecclesiastical 
authority 
quietly 
set 
on 
foot 
an 
inquiry 
into 
the 
orthodoxy 
of 
his 
opinions. 
Cardinal 
Bellarmin, 
probably 
in 
the 
name 
of 
his 
colleagues 
of 
the 
Inquisition, 
asked 
of 
the 
members 
of 
the 
Roman 
College 
(without 
mentioning 
Galileo’s 
name) 
what 
was 
to 
be 
thought 
of 
the 
astronomical 
observations 
that 
had 
recentlybeenpromulgatedby 
adistinguishedmathematician. 


This 
is 
the 
first 
symptom 
that 
we 
have 
been 
able 
to 
discover 
of 
the 
intervention 
of 
theology 
in 
the 
examination 
of 
Galileo’s 
scientific 
opinions. 
The 
response 
of 
the 
Roman 
College 
was 
favorable 
to 
him; 
but, 
from 
that 
moment 
forward, 
the 
alarm 
was 
sounded, 
and 
the 
Inquisition 
never 
lost 
sight 
of 
him. 
Though 
the 
sovereign 
pontiff, 
to 
whom 
he 
was 
presented 
by 
the 
Tuscan 
embassador, 
received 
him 
with 
great 
courtesy, 
not 
allowing 
him 
to 
utter 
even 
a 
word 
on 
bended 
knees, 
yet 
the 
Holy 
Office, 
even 
before 
he 
had 
quitted 
Rome, 
inquired 
of 
the 
tribunal 
at 
Padua 
whether, 
in 
the 
action 
brought 
against 
Cesare 
Cremonini 
for 
certain 
philosophical 
indiscretions, 
there 
might 
not 
be 
something 
to 
compromise 
Galileo. 
A 
direct 
personal 
attack, 
inspired 
by 
an 
over-weening 
zeal, 
quickly 
followed 
these 
early 
suspicions. 
On 
his 
return 
to 
Florence, 
Galileo 
took 
up 
his 
labors 
afresh 
in 
the 
pleasant 
solitudes 
of 
the 
Belvedere, 
placed 
at 
his 
service 
by 
the 
kind 
hospitality 
of 
the 
grand-
duke; 
there 
he 
received 
his 
friends 
and 
pupils, 
who, 
on 
departing 
from 
these 
conversaziones, 
propagated 
his 
doctrines. 
At 
this 
a 
Dominican 
friar, 
Thomas 
Caccini, 
took 
umbrage, 
and, 
in 
a 
sermon 
delivered 
at 
Santa 
Maria 
Nuova 
on 
the 
miracle 
of 
Joshua, 
he 
suddenly 
exclaimed, 
“Viri 
Galilæi, 
quid 
statis 
aspicientes 
in 
coelum?” 
The 
friar 
doubtless 
had 
heard 
of 
a 
conversation 
held 
at 
the 
court 
in 
presence 
of 
the 
grand-duchess 
dowager 
Christine 
of 
Lorraine, 
and 
the 
Archduchess 
Madeleine 
of 
Austria, 
in 
the 
course 
of 
which 
Father 



Castelli, 
a 
pupil 
of 
Galileo, 
had 
endeavored 
to 
prove, 
to 
the 
great 
satisfaction 
of 
his 
hearers, 
that 
one 
might 
believe 
in 
the 
earth’s 
motion 
without 
questioning 
the 
authenticity 
of 
Joshua’s 
miracle. 
Upon 
this 
subject 
Galileo 
addressed 
to 
his 
pupil 
a 
famous 
letter, 
in 
which 
he 
precisely 
set 
forth 
the 
rights 
of 
science, 
at 
the 
same 
time 
asserting 
for 
religion 
its 
own. 
Here, 
according 
to 
him, 
are 
two 
separate 
domains, 
which 
are 
not 
rashly 
to 
be 
confounded. 


“The 
Holy 
Scripture,” 
said 
he, 
“can 
neither 
lie 
nor 
err, 
but 
it 
needs 
to 
be 
interpreted; 
for, 
were 
we 
to 
insist 
upon 
the 
literal 
sense 
of 
the 
words, 
we 
should 
find 
not 
only 
contradictions, 
but 
heresies 
and 
blasphemies; 
we 
should 
have 
to 
give 
to 
God 
hands, 
feet, 
ears, 
to 
suppose 
him 
subject 
to 
like 
passions 
with 
men 
— 
to 
anger, 
remorse, 
hatred; 
and, 
again, 
to 
hold 
that 
he 
forgets 
the 
past 
and 
is 
ignorant 
of 
the 
future. 
. 
. 
. 
Inasmuch 
as 
the 
Bible 
constantly 
requires 
interpretation 
to 
explain 
how 
very 
different 
the 
true 
sense 
of 
the 
words 
is 
from 
their 
apparent 
signification, 
it 
appears 
to 
me 
that 
it 
should 
be 
quoted 
in 
scientific 
discussions 
only 
as 
the 
last 
resort. 
In 
truth, 
Holy 
Scripture 
and 
Nature 
both 
come 
from 
the 
Divine 
Word, 
the 
one 
being 
the 
dictation 
of 
the 
Holy 
Ghost, 
while 
the 
other 
is 
the 
executor 
of 
God’s 
decrees; 
but 
it 
was 
fitting 
that, 
in 
the 
Scriptures, 
the 
language 
should 
be 
adapted 
to 
the 
people’s 
understanding 
in 
many 
things 
where 
the 
appearance 
differs 
widely 
from 
the 
reality. 
Nature, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
is 
inexorable 
and 
immutable; 
she 
is 
not 
at 
all 
concerned 
whether 
the 
hidden 
reasons 
and 
means 
through 
which 
she 
works 
are 
or 
are 
not 
intelligible 
to 
man, 
because 
she 
never 
oversteps 
the 
limit 
of 
the 
laws 
imposed 
upon 
her. 
Hence 
it 
appears 
that 
when 
we 
have 
to 
do 
with 
natural 
effects 
brought 
under 
our 
eyes 
by 
the 
experience 
of 
our 
senses, 
or 
deduced 
from 
absolute 
demonstrations, 
these 
can 
in 
no 
wise 
be 
called 
in 
question 
on 
the 
strength 
of 
Scripture 
texts 
that 
are 
susceptible 
of 
a 
thousand 
different 
interpretations, 
for 
the 
words 
of 
Scripture 
are 
not 
so 
strictly 
limited 
in 
their 
significance 
as 
the 
phenomena 
of 
Nature. 
. 
. 
. 
I 
therefore 
think 
it 
would 
be 
wise 
to 
forbid 
persons 
from 
using 
texts 
of 
Holy 
Scripture, 
and 
from 
forcing 
them, 
as 
it 
were, 
to 
support 
as 
true 
certain 
propositions 
in 
natural 
science, 
whereof 
the 
contrary 
may 
to-morrow 
be 
demonstrated 
by 
the 
senses 
orby 
mathematicalreasoning.” 


This 
noble 
letter, 
the 
moderation 
of 
which 
would 
nowadays 
be 
admitted 
by 
every 
theologian, 
but 
which 
then 
gave 
out 
a 
dangerous 
odor 
of 
novelty, 
no 
doubt 
passed 
from 
hand 
to 
hand, 
was 
read 
by 
ill-disposed 
persons, 
perhaps 
fomented 
the 
agitation 
produced 
by 
Caccini’s 
vehement 
assault, 
and 



furnished 
to 
another 
Dominican, 
Niccola 
Lorini, 
an 
opportunity 
of 
denouncing 
Galileo 
to 
the 
Congregation 
of 
the 
Holy 
Office. 
“Here,” 
said 
the 
informer, 
“are 
propositions 
that 
seem 
to 
be 
suspect 
and 
rash, 
opinions 
that 
contradict 
the 
text 
of 
the 
Holy 
Scripture. 
Besides,” 
he 
added, 
“Galileo 
and 
his 
disciples 
speak 
with 
little 
respect 
of 
the 
fathers 
of 
the 
Church, 
of 
St. 
Thomas 
of 
Aquino, 
and 
of 
Aristotle, 
whose 
philosophy 
has 
rendered 
so 
much 
service 
to 
the 
scholastic 
theology.” 
The 
Inquisition, 
though 
search 
was 
made, 
was 
unabletoprocure 
the 
originalof 
the 
letter, 
for 
Castellihadgivenit 
backtohis 
master, 
and 
he 
prudently 
refused 
to 
part 
with 
it. 
The 
inquisitors 
contented 
themselves 
with 
an 
examination 
of 
the 
copy 
sent 
by 
Lorini, 
in 
which 
they 
discovered 
a 
few 
ill-sounding 
phrases, 
but, 
on 
the 
whole, 
nothing 
clearly 
contradictory 
of 
the 
language 
of 
Scripture. 
Still 
they 
continued 
to 
note 
the 
words 
of 
Galileo; 
they 
questioned 
two 
Tuscan 
ecclesiastics 
about 
the 
speeches 
that 
he 
might 
have 
uttered 
in 
their 
hearing; 
they 
scrutinized 
the 
lettershe 
hadpublished 
onthe 
subjectofobservingsun-spots. 


Galileo, 
though 
quite 
ignorant 
of 
the 
strict 
watch 
kept 
on 
him 
by 
the 
Inquisition, 
had 
a 
vague 
apprehension 
of 
imminent 
danger. 
To 
ward 
it 
off, 
he 
adopted 
the 
expedient 
of 
going 
again 
to 
Rome 
in 
1615, 
and 
of 
pleading 
his 
cause 
in 
person 
in 
the 
quarter 
where 
a 
successful 
defense 
was 
most 
to 
be 
desired. 
It 
has 
been 
asserted 
that 
Galileo 
was 
summoned 
before 
the 
bar 
of 
the 
Holy 
Office, 
but 
they 
who 
so 
assert 
are 
in 
error 
as 
to 
the 
date; 
it 
was 
not 
till 
a 
much 
later 
period, 
viz., 
the 
beginning 
of 
his 
second 
trial, 
that 
he 
was 
ordered 
to 
appear 
in 
Rome. 
On 
the 
present 
occasion 
he 
went 
of 
his 
own 
accord, 
no 
longer 
possessed 
of 
the 
fearless 
assurance 
with 
which 
he 
made 
his 
first 
journey, 
yet 
confidently 
hoping 
that 
he 
would 
disarm 
his 
opponents 
by 
the 
clearness 
of 
his 
explanations. 
Perchance 
he 
rested 
his 
expectation 
of 
convincing 
them 
as 
much 
upon 
the 
graces 
and 
charms 
of 
his 
wit, 
and 
the 
personal 
attractiveness 
which 
won 
for 
him 
all 
hearts, 
as 
upon 
the 
strength 
of 
hisarguments. 


Besides, 
he 
had 
taken 
more 
pains 
than 
even 
he 
did 
in 
1611 
to 
prepare 
the 
ground: 
he 
had, 
in 
urgent 
letters, 
rekindled 
the 
zeal 
of 
his 
friends, 
and 
had 
again 
obtained 
for 
himself 
all 
the 
external 
tokens 
of 
the 
official 
protection 
of 
the 
grand-duke. 
As 
before, 
he 
went 
down 
to 
the 
embassador’s 
palace, 
the 
villa 
ofthe 
Trinità, 
de’ 
Monti, 
wherenow 
theAcademy 
of 
Francehas 
itsseat, 
and, 
the 
day 
after 
his 
arrival, 
went 
into 
the 
country. 
What 
with 
detailed 
explanations 
made 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
numerous 
auditors, 
keen 
and 
lively 
disputations 
in 
which 
he 
plainly 
showed 
the 
weakness 
of 
his 
opponents, 



frequent 
visits 
to 
distinguished 
personages, 
brief 
tractates 
in 
which 
he 
demonstrated 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
Copernican 
system, 
he 
omitted 
nothing 
that 
could 
influence 
in 
his 
own 
favor 
those 
currents 
of 
opinion 
which 
judges 
themselvescannotwithstand. 


Unfortunately 
for 
Galileo, 
the 
tribunal 
of 
the 
Inquisition 
was 
but 
little 
affected 
by 
external 
influences; 
it 
imposed 
laws 
on 
opinion, 
and 
took 
no 
advice 
from 
it. 
The 
members 
of 
the 
Holy 
Office, 
heedless 
of 
the 
steps 
taken 
by 
the 
illustrious 
astronomer, 
and 
of 
the 
ardor 
with 
which 
his 
ideas 
were 
espoused 
by 
a 
portion 
of 
Roman 
society, 
went 
on 
quietly 
with 
their 
work. 
In 
examining 
the 
letters 
on 
the 
sun-spots, 
they 
found 
therein 
two 
propositions 
worthy 
of 
censure. 
On 
the 
24th 
of 
February, 
1616, 
they 
unanimously 
pronounced 
it 
absurd 
and 
heretical 
to 
assert 
that 
the 
sun 
is 
motionless, 
and 
that 
the 
earth 
revolves. 
The 
sovereign 
pontiff 
immediately 
ordered 
Cardinal 
Bellarmin 
to 
summon 
Galileo, 
and 
to 
have 
him 
promise 
that 
he 
would 
no 
longer 
uphold 
a 
proposition 
condemned 
by 
the 
Church. 
“If 
he 
refuses 
to 
obey,” 
said 
the 
pontifical 
letter, 
“the 
Father 
Commissary, 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
notary 
and 
witnesses, 
shall 
enjoin 
him 
absolutely 
to 
abstain 
from 
teaching 
that 
doctrine 
and 
that 
opinion, 
from 
upholding 
it 
or 
even 
speaking 
of 
it; 
in 
case 
he 
does 
not 
comply, 
he 
shall 
be 
cast 
into 
jail.” 
Accordingly, 
on 
the 
26th 
of 
February, 
1616, 
Cardinal 
Bellarmin, 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
commissary-
general 
of 
the 
Holy 
Office 
and 
two 
witnesses, 
invited 
Galileo 
to 
renounce 
the 
two 
condemned 
propositions. 
After 
Bellarmin, 
the 
commissary-general 
again 
intimated 
to 
him, 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
pope 
and 
the 
entire 
Congregation 
of 
the 
Holy 
Office, 
the 
formal 
order 
no 
longer 
to 
uphold, 
teach, 
and 
defend 
this 
opinion, 
whether 
by 
writing, 
by 
word 
of 
mouth, 
or 
in 
any 
manner 
whatsoever; 
if 
he 
failed 
to 
comply, 
he 
was 
to 
be 
prosecuted 
by 
the 
Holy 
Office. 
Galileo 
promised 
to 
obey. 
On 
the 
5th 
of 
March 
following, 
the 
Congregation 
of 
the 
Index 
condemned 
the 
work 
of 
Copernicus 
until 
it 
should 
becorrected. 


From 
these 
authentic 
facts 
it 
results 
that 
a 
certain 
number 
of 
modern 
historians 
are 
deceived 
themselves, 
or 
would 
deceive 
us, 
when 
they 
insinuate 
that 
the 
Holy 
Office 
meant 
to 
condemn, 
not 
the 
system 
of 
Copernicus, 
but 
Galileo’s 
theological 
interpretations 
of 
it. 
There 
was 
no 
question 
whatever 
about 
theological 
interpretations. 
In 
neither 
Copernicus’s 
book, 
nor 
in 
the 
letters 
on 
the 
sun-spots, 
is 
there 
a 
word, 
a 
single 
phrase, 
in 
which 
the 
Holy 
Scripturesare 
interpreted. 
If 
here 
and 
there 
in 
his 
correspondence 
Galileo, 
out 
of 
respect 
to 
religion, 
endeavored 
to 
reconcile 
the 
data 
of 
science 
with 
the 



text 
of 
the 
Bible, 
henever 
publishedthese 
explanations. 
Itwas 
not 
upon 
these 
private 
manuscript 
documents 
that 
he 
was 
tried, 
and 
the 
only 
document 
that 
furnished 
a 
basis 
for 
the 
charge 
was 
a 
printed 
work, 
purely 
scientific 
in 
character, 
and 
having 
nothing 
whatever 
to 
do 
with 
theology. 
By 
no 
manner 
of 
argumentation 
can 
the 
fact 
be 
negatived 
that 
a 
tribunal 
of 
theologians 
constituted 
itself 
a 
judge 
in 
a 
question 
of 
science, 
and 
decided 
it 
as 
an 
authority 
decides. 
The 
Holy 
Office 
did 
not 
forbid 
receiving 
and 
teaching 
the 
doctrine 
of 
Copernicus, 
on 
the 
ground 
that 
it 
was 
not 
yet 
demonstrated, 
as 
someoftheapologistsof 
theHoly 
Seewouldhaveusbelieve;they 
wouldnot 
permit 
it 
to 
be 
demonstrated; 
they 
pronounced 
it 
in 
advance 
to 
be 
“absurd, 
heretical, 
contrary 
to 
the 
text 
of 
the 
Scripture.” 
Such 
is 
the 
whole 
truth 
about 
Galileo’s 
first 
trial, 
and 
Domenico 
Berti 
sets 
it 
forth 
with 
much 
dialectic 
vigor. 


II. 


Galileo 
once 
reduced 
to 
silence 
by 
the 
act 
of 
submission 
to 
which 
he 
had 
subscribed, 
the 
object 
of 
the 
Inquisition 
was 
attained. 
No 
useless 
rigor 
followed 
the 
first 
procedure. 
Provided 
that 
the 
culprit 
spoke 
no 
more 
about 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
earth, 
the 
court 
of 
Rome 
would 
like 
nothing 
better 
than 
to 
make 
the 
most 
of 
a 
great 
mind 
that 
for 
a 
moment 
had 
gone 
astray, 
but 
whose 
genius 
and 
whose 
scientific 
fame 
were 
intact. 
After 
the 
trial, 
Galileo 
remained 
three 
months 
in 
Rome, 
and 
was 
kindly 
received 
by 
the 
sovereign 
pontiff. 
In 
fact, 
the 
rumor 
having 
spread 
that 
he 
had 
been 
punished 
by 
the 
Holy 
Office 
and 
obliged 
to 
retract 
and 
to 
do 
penance, 
he 
obtained 
from 
Cardinal 
Bellarmin 
a 
certificate 
to 
the 
contrary 
effect. 
All 
that 
was 
done, 
said 
the 
cardinal, 
was 
to 
forbid 
him 
defending 
or 
upholding 
the 
system 
of 
Copernicus. 
What 
advantage 
could 
it 
have 
been 
to 
drag 
Galileo 
down 
from 
the 
high 
position 
he 
occupied 
in 
the 
world’s 
opinion? 
It 
was 
enough, 
for 
the 
purposes 
ofhisjudges,ifthey 
could 
shuthismouth. 


In 
this 
they 
supposed 
they 
had 
succeeded, 
but 
here 
they 
failed 
to 
take 
account 
of 
the 
overmastering 
impulse 
to 
propagate 
truth, 
which 
is 
the 
very 
essence 
of 
scientific 
genius. 
Galileo 
could 
neither 
erase 
from 
his 
mind 
a 
belief 
that 
rested 
on 
a 
demonstration, 
nor 
refuse 
to 
employ 
it 
in 
advancing 
to 
fresh 
discoveries, 
nor 
abstain 
from 
speaking 
of 
it 
with 
those 
who 
consulted 
him 
with 
regard 
to 
their 
own 
astronomical 
labors, 
or 
took 
an 
interest 
in 
his. 
In 
his 
retirement 
at 
the 
Belvedere, 
where, 
since 
his 
return 
from 
Rome, 
he 
led 
a 



more 
secluded 
life 
than 
ever, 
he 
received, 
as 
in 
former 
times, 
numerous 
visits, 
nearly 
all 
prompted 
by 
the 
love 
of 
science. 
He 
was 
still 
the 
recognized 
and 
admired 
head 
of 
the 
scientific 
movement 
in 
Italy. 
Why 
should 
he 
not 
converse 
about 
the 
cardinal 
proposition 
of 
the 
earth’s 
motion 
with 
the 
young 
savants 
who 
came 
to 
ask 
his 
advice 
and 
to 
receive 
his 
instruction? 
A 
distinguished 
Italian 
narrates 
how, 
having 
spent 
a 
few 
days 
with 
him, 
after 
the 
close 
of 
his 
first 
trial, 
he 
heard 
from 
Galileo’s 
mouth 
the 
exposition 
of 
the 
Copernican 
system, 
was 
converted 
to 
his 
ideas, 
and 
himself 
then 
converted 
Campanellatothatdoctrine. 


Hence 
the 
submission 
of 
Galileo 
was 
only 
apparent. 
Later 
he 
was 
justly 
charged 
with 
having 
broken 
his 
promise. 
Still, 
he 
avoided 
compromising 
himself 
publicly, 
and 
in 
his 
first 
work, 
“Il 
Saggiatore,” 
which 
is 
a 
model 
of 
keen, 
clever 
irony, 
he 
hardly 
ventured 
to 
write 
anything 
touching 
on 
the 
system 
of 
Copernicus. 
Presently 
the 
election 
of 
a 
new 
pontiff 
inspired 
him 
with 
the 
hope 
that 
the 
court 
of 
Rome 
might 
relax 
its 
rigor. 
Urban 
VIII., 
of 
the 
family 
of 
Barberini, 
was 
a 
Florentine, 
a 
lover 
of 
letters, 
well 
disposed 
toward 
the 
Academy 
of 
the 
Lincei, 
and 
especially 
friendly 
to 
Galileo, 
to 
whom 
he 
had 
addressed, 
while 
yet 
a 
cardinal, 
some 
verses 
conceived 
in 
a 
vein 
of 
eulogy. 
Galileo 
went 
to 
Rome 
to 
see 
him, 
had 
six 
long 
audiences 
with 
him, 
was 
presented 
by 
him 
with 
a 
picture, 
medals, 
agnus 
deis, 
and 
a 
pension 
for 
his 
son, 
and 
doubtless 
talked 
with 
him 
about 
the 
great 
subject 
which 
filled 
his 
mind. 
We 
can 
only 
guess 
at 
what 
was 
said 
by 
the 
two 
friends: 
some 
authors 
assert 
that 
Urban 
VIII. 
then 
inclined 
toward 
the 
Copernican 
system; 
others, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
say 
that 
he 
demonstrated 
to 
Galileo 
the 
impossibility 
of 
maintaining 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
earth’s 
motion. 
The 
truth 
is, 
that 
we 
know 
nothing 
about 
the 
matter; 
neither 
the 
pope 
nor 
the 
astronomer 
has 
given 
out 
anything 
about 
the 
nature 
of 
their 
conversations. 
Perhaps 
even, 
as 
we 
shall 
shortly 
see, 
they 
believed 
that 
they 
could 
agree, 
while 
differing 
from 
one 
anotherwidely. 


At 
all 
events, 
it 
seems 
that, 
dating 
from 
the 
accession 
of 
Urban 
VIII. 
to 
the 
pontifical 
throne, 
Galileo 
felt 
more 
free 
to 
touch 
anew 
upon 
the 
forbidden 
subject, 
under 
a 
different 
form. 
Was 
this 
the 
result 
of 
an 
overweening 
confidence 
in 
the 
friendship 
of 
the 
sovereign 
pontiff, 
of 
a 
too 
favorable 
interpretation 
of 
some 
friendly 
speeches, 
or 
of 
the 
impossibility 
of 
being 
silent 
while 
Kepler 
was 
speaking 
boldly 
outside 
of 
Italy, 
while 
on 
Italian 
soil 
one 
was 
constantly 
harassed 
by 
ignorant 
opponents, 
and, 
though 
one’s 
hand 
were 
full 
of 
truths, 
one 
durst 
not 
open 
it 
and 
rout 
them. 
The 
“Dialogues 
on 



the 
Two 
Great 
Systems 
of 
the 
Universe,” 
which 
were 
destined 
to 
bring 
Galileo 
into 
so 
much 
trouble, 
show 
that, 
in 
writing 
them, 
he 
stood 
between 
the 
conflicting 
influences 
of 
a 
strong 
desire 
to 
speak 
and 
the 
fear 
of 
compromising 
himself. 
He 
rather 
insinuates 
his 
ideas 
with 
true 
Italian 
finesse 
than 
puts 
them 
forth 
boldly. 
He 
does 
not 
defend 
the 
Copernican 
system, 
but 
expounds 
it. 
He 
even 
takes 
the 
precaution 
of 
stating, 
in 
a 
preface, 
the 
rough 
draft 
of 
which 
had 
been 
sent 
to 
him 
from 
Rome, 
that 
the 
true 
aim 
of 
his 
work 
is 
to 
show 
that 
in 
Italy 
ideas 
are 
not 
condemned 
unknown, 
and 
that 
nowhere 
is 
this 
delicate 
matter 
better 
understood 
than 
in 
Italy. 
He 
carefully 
avoids 
drawing 
conclusions: 
the 
personage 
whom 
he 
introduces 
as 
the 
representative 
of 
the 
doctrine 
of 
Ptolemy 
and 
as 
the 
defender 
of 
the 
belief 
in 
the 
earth’s 
immobility, 
though 
clad 
in 
the 
strongest 
dialectical 
coat 
of 
mail, 
and 
though 
driven 
to 
his 
last 
ditch 
by 
the 
keen 
raillery 
and 
the 
copious 
logic 
of 
his 
interlocutors, 
replies 
to 
them 
unmoved: 
“Your 
arguments 
are 
the 
most 
ingenious 
that 
can 
be 
conceived, 
but 
I 
consider 
them 
to 
be 
neither 
true 
nor 
conclusive.” 
Father 
Riccardi, 
Master 
of 
the 
Sacred 
Palace, 
whose 
business 
it 
was 
to 
examine 
Galileo’s 
manuscript, 
suffered 
himself 
to 
be 
half-way 
won 
by 
these 
exhibitions 
of 
innocence, 
and 
gave 
a 
permit 
for 
the 
work 
to 
be 
printed, 
though 
not 
without 
resistance. 
He 
afterward 
protested 
that 
he 
had 
been 
deceived 
by 
the 
author, 
and 
that 
some 
of 
the 
conditions 
on 
which 
he 
had 
granted 
the 
imprimatur 
were 
not 
fulfilled. 
At 
first 
it 
was 
agreed 
that 
the 
“Dialogues” 
should 
be 
printed 
at 
Rome; 
but 
at 
the 
earnest 
entreaty 
of 
Galileo 
leave 
was 
granted 
to 
have 
the 
work 
done 
at 
Florence, 
where 
it 
would 
involve 
less 
trouble 
and 
cost 
to 
him, 
and 
where,aboveall,he 
couldmore 
easily 
evade 
the 
surveillance 
of 
the 
Sacred 
Palace. 
In 
this 
negotiation 
Galileo 
displayed 
a 
fecundity 
of 
resource 
and 
a 
force 
of 
will 
that 
show 
how 
important 
be 
considered 
the 
publication 
of 
his 
work 
to 
be. 
The 
chief 
fruit 
of 
his 
address 
was 
that 
he 
escaped 
a 
second 
revision 
of 
the 
text, 
which 
would 
have 
been 
made 
at 
Rome 
had 
the 
work 
been 
printed 
there. 
Galileo 
chose 
rather 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
inquisitor 
at 
Florence, 
to 
whom 
Father 
Riccardi 
had 
delegated 
his 
powers, 
but 
who, 
doubtless 
at 
the 
solicitation 
of 
the 
grand-duke, 
exercised 
these 
powers 
with 
less 
rigor 
than 
would 
have 
been 
used 
at 
the 
Sacred 
Palace. 
We 
can 
imagine 
the 
wrath 
manifested 
by 
the 
court 
of 
Rome; 
in 
fact, 
despite 
allits 
finesse, 
it 
hadbeen 
outwittedby 
an 
Italian 
shrewdereven 
than 
itself,by 
a 
fellow-countryman 
ofMacchiavelli. 


Would 
Galileo 
have 
been 
so 
eager 
for 
the 
publication 
of 
his 
work, 
if 
he 
had 
foreseen 
the 
dangers 
to 
which 
he 
exposed 
himself 
by 
publishing 
it? 
The 



sovereign 
pontiff, 
immediately 
upon 
receipt 
of 
the 
book, 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
August, 
1632, 
was 
highly 
incensed, 
charged 
Galileo 
with 
having 
made 
an 
unhandsome 
return 
for 
his 
kindness, 
and 
would 
on 
the 
spot 
have 
referred 
the 
author 
and 
the 
book 
to 
the 
tribunal 
of 
the 
Holy 
Office, 
had 
he 
not 
been 
restrained 
by 
the 
importunities 
of 
the 
embassador 
Niccolini, 
and 
his 
fear 
of 
offending 
the 
Grand-duke 
of 
Tuscany. 
“Galileo,” 
said 
Urban, 
“has 
not 
acted 
with 
outdeliberation, 
has 
not 
sinned 
through 
ignorance; 
he 
was 
perfectly 
well 
aware 
of 
the 
difficulties 
of 
the 
case, 
for 
I 
myself 
have 
made 
them 
clear 
to 
him.” 
These 
expressions 
of 
dissatisfaction 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
sovereign 
pontiff 
would 
seem 
to 
show 
that, 
in 
the 
interviews 
of 
which 
we 
have 
spoken, 
the 
two 
friends 
had 
touched 
on 
the 
delicate 
question 
of 
the 
earth’s 
motion, 
and 
that, 
by 
a 
process 
of 
self-illusion 
quite 
natural 
under 
the 
circumstances, 
each 
had 
supposed 
he 
had 
convinced 
the 
other. 
The 
pope 
was 
angry 
at 
Galileo, 
as 
at 
one 
in 
whom 
he 
had 
for 
a 
long 
time 
mistakenly 
reposed 
confidence 
— 
as 
though 
a 
fraud 
had 
been 
practised 
upon 
him; 
this 
feeling, 
which 
had 
broken 
the 
bond 
of 
their 
old 
friendship, 
explains 
the 
harshness 
with 
which 
Urban 
treated 
the 
friend 
of 
his 
youth. 
Nor 
had 
Galileo 
been 
less 
mistaken 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
disposition 
of 
the 
pope’s 
mind. 
He 
flattered 
himself 
that 
he 
should 
find 
in 
him 
an 
indulgent 
judge 
of 
his 
astronomical 
theories, 
while 
in 
point 
of 
fact 
he 
was 
wounding 
Urban 
in 
his 
most 
sacred 
convictions. 
Had 
he 
known 
that 
the 
pope 
was 
so 
opposed 
to 
the 
system 
of 
Copernicus, 
doubtless 
he 
never 
would 
have 
braved 
the 
wrath 
of 
one 
whose 
power 
was 
unlimited, 
or 
affrontedatribunalfromwhichtherewasnoappeal. 


On 
receipt 
of 
the 
“Dialogues,” 
Urban 
instructed 
a 
commission 
to 
examine 
the 
book 
and 
report 
to 
him. 
As 
soon 
as 
the 
report 
came 
into 
his 
hands, 
he 
commanded 
the 
inquisitor 
at 
Florence 
to 
communicate 
to 
Galileo 
a 
formal 
summons 
to 
appear 
in 
October 
before 
the 
commissary-general 
of 
the 
Holy 
Office 
in 
Rome. 
Galileo, 
then 
seventy 
years 
of 
age, 
and 
suffering 
from 
hernia, 
asked 
the 
authorities 
to 
take 
into 
consideration 
his 
age 
and 
his 
malady, 
and 
to 
dispense 
him 
from 
the 
journey. 
The 
Grand-duke 
of 
Tuscany 
interceded 
for 
him. 
But 
Urban 
would 
listen 
to 
nothing; 
fearing 
lest 
he 
should 
be 
deceived, 
ashe 
believed 
he 
had 
beenbefore, 
hewouldpermit 
no 
delay. 
He 
would 
not 
even 
believe 
the 
testimony 
of 
three 
physicians 
who 
attested 
the 
reality 
of 
Galileo’s 
malady; 
he 
sent 
the 
inquisitor 
in 
person 
to 
him, 
with 
orders 
to 
arrest 
and 
bring 
him 
in 
irons 
to 
Rome, 
if 
he 
was 
found 
to 
be 
in 
a 
condition 
to 
bear 
the 
journey. 
Poor 
Galileo 
had 
taken 
to 
his 
bed, 
and, 
as 
was 
said 
by 
one 
of 
his 
friends, 
“he 
was 
more 
in 
danger 
of 
going 
to 
the 
other 
world 



than 
to 
Rome.” 
He 
was 
not 
in 
a 
condition 
to 
be 
removed 
until 
January, 
1633. 
The 
good 
offices 
of 
the 
Grand-duke 
of 
Tuscany 
attended 
him 
to 
the 
presence 
of 
his 
judges, 
and 
there 
the 
friendship 
of 
Niccolini 
accompanied 
him 
— 
weak 
succors 
these 
in 
the 
face 
of 
such 
powerful 
adversaries. 
At 
first 
the 
embassador’s 
palace 
was 
appointed 
as 
his 
place 
of 
confinement, 
and 
he 
was 
commanded 
not 
to 
leave 
it; 
he 
went 
out 
only 
in 
order 
to 
submit 
to 
the 
interrogatoriesproposedto 
himbytheHoly 
Office. 


On 
the 
12th 
of 
April 
he 
was 
interrogated 
for 
the 
first 
time. 
To 
begin 
with, 
he 
was 
asked 
if 
he 
remembered 
what 
took 
place 
in 
1616, 
when 
he 
had 
to 
appear 
before 
Cardinal 
Bellarmin 
and 
the 
commissary-general 
of 
the 
Holy 
Office. 
Galileo 
admitted 
having 
heard 
it 
declared 
on 
that 
day 
that 
the 
system 
of 
Copernicus 
could 
not 
be 
maintained 
or 
defended, 
as 
being 
contrary 
to 
the 
Holy 
Scriptures. 
“It 
may 
be,” 
he 
added, 
“that 
at 
the 
same 
time 
I 
myself 
was 
forbidden 
to 
maintain 
or 
defend 
that 
opinion, 
but 
I 
do 
not 
recollect, 
it 
is 
now 
so 
long 
ago.” 
Whatever 
may 
be 
the 
interest 
now 
taken 
in 
a 
case 
so 
bound 
up 
with 
the 
question 
of 
the 
freedom 
of 
thought, 
it 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
believe 
with 
Berti 
that 
Galileo 
replied 
to 
this 
first 
interrogatory 
with 
entirely 
good 
faith. 
When 
a 
prohibition 
is 
issued 
in 
terms 
so 
formal 
as 
those 
we 
have 
given, 
upon 
so 
definite 
a 
point, 
neither 
the 
form 
nor 
the 
substance 
is 
ever 
forgotten. 
Ambiguity 
was 
out 
of 
the 
question 
after 
Bellarmin’s 
warning, 
and 
still 
more 
after 
the 
solemn 
injunction 
of 
the 
commissary-general. 
Domenico 
Berti 
is 
in 
error 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
psychological 
conditions 
of 
memory 
where 
he 
says 
that 
it 
must 
have 
been 
easier 
for 
Galileo 
to 
recollect 
the 
conciliatory 
words 
of 
Cardinal 
Bellarmin 
than 
the 
threats 
of 
the 
commissary-general. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
what 
strikes 
one 
most 
under 
such 
circumstances, 
what 
impresses 
itself 
deepest 
in 
the 
memory, 
is 
the 
threats. 
How 
could 
any 
one 
forget 
words 
so 
simple, 
so 
clear, 
so 
menacing, 
as 
these: 
“You 
are 
forbidden 
to 
maintain 
this 
opinion,toteachor 
todefendit,whetherbywritingor 
bywordofmouth, 
orinanyothermannerwhatsoever,elsetheHoly 
Officewilltake 
information 
against 
you!” 
These 
last 
words 
in 
particular 
must 
have 
buried 
themselves 
like 
an 
arrow 
in 
the 
memory 
of 
Galileo, 
nevermore 
to 
come 
out. 
He 
knew 
all 
too 
well 
what 
he 
had 
to 
fear 
from 
the 
Inquisition 
ever 
to 
forget 
on 
what 
conditions 
that 
tribunal 
agreed 
to 
take 
no 
further 
cognizance 
of 
him. 
The 
silence 
he 
kept 
in 
public 
for 
sixteen 
years 
upon 
the 
forbidden 
subject, 
and 
even 
the 
care 
he 
took 
in 
his 
“Dialogues” 
to 
give 
to 
his 
thoughts 
an 
inoffensiveturn,mightserveasevidenceofthe 
faithfulnessofhismemory. 



The 
fact 
is, 
that 
the 
reason 
of 
Galileo’s 
taking 
up 
his 
pen 
again 
to 
treat 
a 
forbidden 
subject 
was 
not 
that 
he 
had 
forgotten 
the 
formal 
prohibition. 
He 
might 
have 
made 
answer, 
with 
great 
frankness, 
that, 
though 
he 
had 
been 
ordered 
to 
hold 
his 
peace, 
yet 
he 
had 
not 
been 
convinced, 
and 
that, 
after 
so 
many 
years 
of 
silence, 
the 
need 
of 
proclaiming 
the 
truth 
had 
more 
power 
over 
him 
than 
the 
fear 
of 
disobeying. 
But 
it 
was 
not 
for 
a 
mind 
so 
subtile, 
nor 
for 
a 
character 
so 
wary 
as 
that 
of 
Galileo, 
to 
be 
tied 
down 
to 
a 
categorical 
declaration, 
and 
so 
to 
shut 
every 
portal 
of 
escape. 
He 
chose 
rather 
to 
use 
evasions 
with 
his 
judges, 
to 
plead 
extenuating 
circumstances, 
to 
produce 
the 
impression 
that 
he 
might 
have 
misunderstood, 
but 
that 
he 
had 
not 
acted 
with 
evil 
intent 
and 
with 
his 
eyes 
open. 
Even 
while 
undergoing 
the 
first 
interrogatory, 
he 
was 
still 
in 
hopes 
of 
finding 
in 
the 
sovereign 
pontiff 
some 
remnant 
of 
friendship, 
or, 
at 
least, 
of 
good-will; 
and 
this 
was 
another 
reason 
why 
he 
made 
an 
evasive 
reply, 
and 
did 
not 
compromise 
himself 
by 
an 
explicit 
admission 
of 
his 
offenses. 
He 
appears 
to 
have 
believed, 
at 
this 
first 
session, 
that 
it 
would 
be 
possible 
for 
him 
to 
have 
a 
private 
interview 
with 
the 
holy 
father. 
Being 
questioned 
as 
to 
what 
had 
been 
said 
to 
him 
by 
Cardinal 
Bellarmin 
in 
1616, 
he 
replied 
that 
some 
of 
the 
details 
of 
their 
conversation 
he 
could 
intrust 
only 
to 
the 
ear 
of 
the 
sovereign 
pontiff. 
This 
plainly 
was 
a 
request 
for 
an 
interview 
with 
Urban. 
His 
judges 
seemed 
not 
to 
understand 
him, 
or, 
if 
they 
carried 
his 
words 
to 
the 
holy 
father, 
they 
obtained 
from 
him 
no 
favorable 
answer; 
but, 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
trial, 
it 
became 
evident 
that 
Galileo 
could 
expect 
neither 
indulgence 
nor 
commiseration 
from 
his 
old 
friend. 


All 
of 
Galileo’s 
answers 
at 
the 
first 
interrogatory 
present 
the 
same 
character 
of 
ambiguity. 
On 
being 
asked 
whether, 
before 
he 
begged 
of 
Father 
Riccardi 
license 
to 
print 
his 
“Dialogues,” 
he 
had 
informed 
the 
master 
of 
the 
Sacred 
Palace 
of 
his 
having 
previously 
been 
forbidden 
to 
treat 
certain 
subjects, 
his 
reply 
was 
that 
he 
had 
not 
mentioned 
that 
to 
Father 
Riccardi, 
“for 
he 
did 
not 
think 
it 
necessary 
to 
do 
so, 
having 
no 
scruples, 
nor 
having 
supported 
or 
defended 
in 
his 
book 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
earth’s 
motion 
and 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
sun.” 
It 
is 
not 
altogether 
certain 
that, 
by 
thus 
altering 
the 
truth, 
Galileo 
chose 
the 
best 
line 
of 
defense; 
probably 
a 
little 
more 
of 
frankness 
would 
have 
served 
him 
better. 
He 
was 
simply 
trifling 
with 
his 
judges 
and 
taking 
them 
for 
fools, 
when 
he 
tried 
to 
make 
them 
believe 
that, 
in 
his 
“Dialogues,” 
his 
purpose 
had 
been 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
“weakness 
and 
insufficiency” 
of 
Copernicus’s 
arguments. 
The 
disguises 
in 
which 
the 
author 



clothes 
his 
thoughts 
fail 
to 
deceive 
the 
thoughtful 
reader. 
Throughout 
the 
work, 
the 
defender 
of 
Ptolemy’s 
theory, 
Simplicio 
(in 
whom 
it 
has 
been 
wrongfully 
supposed 
that 
some 
of 
the 
traits 
of 
Urban 
VIII. 
may 
be 
found), 
is 
overthrown 
by 
his 
opponents’ 
arguments, 
and 
made 
an 
object 
of 
ridicule 
by 
their 
irony. 
Surely, 
it 
was 
imprudent 
on 
the 
part 
of 
Galileo 
to 
deny 
the 
evidence, 
thusgiving 
tohisdefensetheappearanceofdouble-dealing. 


Nor 
did 
the 
resort 
to 
this 
course 
deceive 
any 
one. 
The 
three 
judges 
who 
had 
questioned 
him 
unanimously 
declared 
that 
in 
his 
book 
he 
had 
contravened 
the 
injunctions 
of 
Cardinal 
Bellarmin, 
and 
the 
decree 
of 
the 
Congregation 
of 
the 
Index. 
Two 
of 
them 
added 
that 
he 
was 
gravely 
suspect 
of 
adhering 
to 
the 
doctrine 
of 
Copernicus. 
After 
the 
close 
of 
his 
first 
interrogatory, 
he 
was 
removed 
to 
the 
palace 
of 
the 
Holy 
Office, 
and 
there 
he 
occupied 
a 
chamber 
in 
the 
sleeping-apartments 
of 
the 
wardens, 
with 
an 
express 
prohibition 
ofgoing 
outwithout 
leave. 
Here 
he 
had 
long 
and 
frequent 
interviews 
with 
Father 
Vincenzo 
Macolano, 
commissary 
of 
the 
Holy 
Office, 
an 
educated 
man 
of 
kindly 
disposition, 
and 
a 
friend 
of 
the 
grand-duke 
and 
of 
the 
Tuscan 
embassador; 
Father 
Macolano 
took 
it 
upon 
himself 
to 
warn 
Galileo 
of 
the 
dangers 
of 
the 
situation, 
and 
to 
aid 
him 
with 
his 
counsels. 
First 
of 
all, 
he 
induced 
Galileo 
to 
submit 
without 
reserve, 
to 
admit 
his 
offenses, 
and 
to 
repent. 
“I 
made 
his 
error 
patent 
to 
him,” 
wrote 
the 
father 
commissary, 
at 
the 
close 
of 
one 
of 
their 
interviews; 
“he 
clearly 
saw 
that 
he 
had 
made 
a 
mistake, 
that 
in 
his 
book 
he 
had 
gone 
too 
far, 
and 
he 
expressed 
to 
me 
his 
regret 
in 
words 
full 
of 
feeling, 
as 
though 
he 
drew 
comfort 
from 
the 
knowledge 
of 
his 
error, 
and 
was 
thinking 
of 
confessing 
it 
judicially; 
he 
only 
asked 
of 
me 
a 
little 
time 
to 
consider 
how 
he 
might 
best 
word 
his 
confession.” 
Father 
Macolano 
then 
looked 
for 
a 
speedy 
ending 
of 
the 
trial, 
and 
a 
less 
severe 
sentence. 
“When 
once 
we 
have 
Galileo’s 
confession,” 
said 
he, 
“the 
reputation 
of 
the 
tribunal 
will 
be 
safe, 
and 
the 
accused 
can 
be 
treated 
with 
indulgence.” 
Evidently 
he 
expected 
that 
the 
case 
would 
not 
be 
carried 
beyond 
the 
first 
stage 
of 
inquisition, 
and 
that 
it 
would 
terminate 
by 
a 
special 
form 
of 
interrogatory, 
knownas 
the 
“interrogatorywithregardto 
theintention.” 


If 
things 
were 
pushed 
further 
than 
the 
commissary 
of 
the 
Holy 
Office 
either 
wished 
or 
expected, 
the 
blame 
does 
not 
rest 
with 
the 
accused, 
who, 
once 
warned, 
immediately 
resolved 
to 
submit. 
On 
being 
interrogated 
again 
on 
the 
30th 
of 
April, 
Galileo 
confessed 
that, 
without 
meaning 
it, 
he 
had 
presentedtooforcibly 
the 
argumentsinfavor 
ofthesystemof 
Copernicus,his 
intention 
all 
the 
while 
being 
to 
refute 
them, 
and 
that 
thus 
he 
might 
have 
led 



the 
public 
into 
error. 
He 
declared 
that 
he 
was 
“ready 
to 
refute 
the 
opinion 
of 
Copernicus 
by 
all 
the 
most 
efficacious 
methods 
that 
God 
might 
place 
within 
his 
power.” 
These 
words, 
no 
doubt 
dictated 
to 
him 
by 
the 
humanity 
of 
the 
father 
commissary, 
had 
the 
effect 
of 
procuring 
for 
him 
some 
measure 
of 
liberty. 
That 
very 
evening 
he 
was 
sent 
back 
to 
the 
palace 
of 
the 
Tuscan 
embassador, 
so 
that 
there 
he 
might 
receive 
such 
care 
as 
the 
state 
of 
his 
health 
required. 


We 
must 
not 
forget 
that 
to 
the 
humiliation 
of 
repudiating 
his 
most 
cherished 
opinions, 
of 
belying 
his 
own 
thoughts, 
and 
of 
seeing 
himself 
treatedasacriminalafter 
hehad, 
byhis 
labors,done 
honor 
to 
hiscountry 
and 
to 
mankind, 
were 
added 
physical 
sufferings 
of 
the 
most 
grievous 
kind. 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
read 
without 
emotion 
the 
appeal 
he 
addressed 
to 
his 
judges 
at 
the 
end 
of 
his 
written 
defense: 
“It 
remains 
for 
me 
to 
urge 
one 
final 
consideration, 
viz., 
the 
pitiable 
state 
of 
bodily 
indisposition 
to 
which 
I 
have 
been 
reduced 
by 
incessant 
mental 
agony 
during 
ten 
whole 
months, 
together 
with 
the 
hardships 
of 
a 
long 
and 
toilsome 
journey, 
in 
the 
most 
inclement 
weather, 
at 
the 
age 
of 
threescore 
years 
and 
nine. 
. 
. 
. 
I 
confide 
in 
the 
mercy 
and 
goodness 
of 
the 
most 
eminent 
seigniors 
who 
are 
my 
judges, 
and 
I 
hope 
that 
if, 
in 
the 
integrity 
of 
their 
justice, 
they 
think 
that 
so 
great 
sufferings 
lack 
anything 
to 
make 
them 
equal 
to 
the 
punishment 
that 
my 
offenses 
deserve, 
they 
will 
be 
pleased, 
at 
my 
entreaty, 
to 
remit 
the 
difference 
in 
consideration 
ofthefailing 
strengthof 
my 
old 
age,whichIhumblycommendtothem.” 


Among 
the 
hitherto 
unpublished 
documents 
contained 
in 
Berti’s 
work 
there 
is 
one 
that 
is 
of 
the 
highest 
importance. 
This 
is 
a 
summary 
of 
the 
case, 
giving 
an 
enumeration 
not 
only 
of 
what 
was 
decreed 
but 
also 
of 
what 
was 
done. 
After 
reading 
a 
text 
so 
clear 
and 
so 
unambiguous 
on 
all 
points 
save 
one, 
while 
on 
that 
one 
it 
agrees 
perfectly 
with 
other 
authentic 
documents, 
we 
no 
longer 
find 
ground 
for 
supposing 
it 
was 
only 
on 
paper 
that 
Galileo 
was 
threatened 
with 
the 
torture, 
and 
forced 
to 
make 
abjuration. 
A 
decree 
of 
the 
pope, 
dated 
June 
16th, 
ordains 
that 
instead 
of 
a 
simple 
“examination 
as 
to 
intention,” 
such 
as 
the 
commissary 
of 
the 
Holy 
Office 
had 
expected, 
an 
interrogatory 
should 
be 
had 
with 
the 
threat 
of 
torture, 
if 
the 
accused 
could 
stand 
it; 
he 
is 
ordered 
to 
make 
abjuration, 
and 
condemned 
to 
imprisonment 
according 
to 
the 
good 
pleasure 
of 
the 
congregation. 
This 
decree 
was 
not, 
as 
has 
been 
supposed, 
a 
simple 
declaration 
designed 
to 
sustain 
the 
reputation 
of 
the 
tribunal 
for 
severity, 
while 
the 
culprit 
was 
treated 
leniently; 
on 
the 



contrary, 
it 
was 
executed 
literally, 
as 
is 
shown 
by 
the 
agreement 
of 
the 
documents 
concerningthisportionofthetrial. 


On 
being 
interrogated 
for 
the 
last 
time 
on 
the 
21st 
of 
June, 
Galileo 
was 
orderedto 
state 
whether 
hethenheld 
or 
everhad 
heldthe 
opinionthatthe 
sun 
is 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
world 
and 
that 
the 
earth 
moves. 
He 
humbly 
replied 
that 
ever 
since 
the 
decree 
of 
the 
Congregation 
of 
the 
Index, 
in 
1616, 
he 
had 
always 
held 
and 
still 
did 
hold 
the 
opinion 
of 
Ptolemy 
to 
be 
“most 
true 
and 
unquestionable.” 
This 
reply 
not 
appearing 
to 
be 
satisfactory, 
the 
father 
commissary 
insisted 
on 
knowing 
the 
truth, 
and 
wound 
up 
by 
declaring 
that, 
if 
the 
whole 
truth 
were 
not 
stated, 
recourse 
would 
be 
had 
to 
torture. 
“I 
am 
here 
in 
order 
to 
obey,” 
replied 
Galileo, 
with 
some 
show 
of 
terror. 
The 
text 
of 
the 
sentence 
shows 
that 
he 
was 
treated 
more 
rigorously 
yet. 
“Inasmuch 
as 
it 
appears 
to 
us 
that 
you 
have 
not 
told 
the 
whole 
truth 
as 
touching 
your 
intention, 
we 
have 
deemed 
it 
necessary 
to 
resort 
to 
the 
examen 
rigorosum.” 
Now, 
in 
the 
language 
of 
the 
Inquisition, 
examen 
rigorosum 
means 
just 
the 
torture 
and 
that 
alone: 
it 
is 
the 
law-term 
approved 
by 
jurists 
and 
regularly 
employed 
in 
sentences 
which 
condemn 
the 
accused 
to 
the 
cruel 
punishment 
of 
the 
strappado. 
“In 
case 
the 
accused,” 
say 
the 
treatises 
on 
inquisitorial 
law, 
“does 
not 
clear 
himself 
of 
the 
charges, 
recourse 
is 
to 
be 
had 
to 
the 
examen 
rigorosum, 
torture 
having 
been 
devised 
to 
supply 
the 
want 
of 
witnesses.” 
In 
two 
manuscripts 
of 
the 
first 
half 
of 
the 
seventeenth 
century, 
both 
of 
them 
relating 
to 
the 
forms 
of 
procedure 
of 
the 
Holy 
Office, 
the 
expression 
examen 
rigorosum 
is 
pointed 
out 
as 
the 
formula 
to 
be 
employed 
by 
judges 
in 
ordering 
theapplicationof 
torture. 


From 
the 
text 
of 
the 
sentence, 
from 
the 
pontifical 
decree 
already 
quoted, 
and 
from 
the 
summary 
of 
the 
acts 
of 
the 
trial, 
we 
might 
infer 
that 
Galileo 
was 
actually 
subjected 
to 
torture, 
if 
among 
the 
documents 
we 
found 
the 
official 
record 
(procès-verbal) 
of 
the 
examen 
rigorosum, 
as 
we 
find 
the 
official 
record 
of 
the 
previous 
examinations. 
The 
rule 
of 
the 
Inquisition 
was 
ever 
the 
same: 
the 
notary 
or 
registrar 
of 
the 
Holy 
Office 
was 
present 
at 
all 
interrogatories, 
and 
took 
down 
carefully 
the 
words 
of 
the 
sufferer; 
all 
the 
details 
of 
the 
examen 
rigorosum 
were 
recorded 
in 
a 
register, 
from 
the 
first 
intimation 
to 
the 
accused 
that 
he 
was 
to 
be 
taken 
to 
the 
place 
of 
punishment, 
down 
to 
the 
moment 
when 
he 
was 
released 
from 
the 
torture. 
On 
looking 
over 
the 
records 
of 
these 
dread 
sessions, 
we 
find 
all 
the 
words 
spoken 
by 
the 
sufferer 
while 
his 
clothes 
are 
being 
taken 
off 
and 
while 
he 
is 
being 
tied 
to 
the 
instrument 
of 
torture; 
all 
the 
replies 
he 
makes 
to 
his 
judges, 
all 
his 
pleas; 



every 
movement 
he 
makes 
is 
noted 
with 
cold 
precision, 
nay, 
even 
his 
sighs, 
his 
groans, 
while 
under 
the 
torture. 
“He 
was 
hoisted 
by 
the 
rope,” 
calmly 
writes 
the 
notary, 
“and 
while 
suspended 
he 
would 
cry 
out 
in 
a 
loud 
voice, 
‘O 
Lord 
God, 
have 
pity! 
O 
Our 
Lady, 
help 
me!’ 
repeating 
these 
words 
again 
and 
again. 
Then 
he 
was 
silent, 
and 
having 
for 
a 
little 
while 
thus 
held 
his 
peace, 
he 
began 
again 
tocryout, 
‘OGod,OGod!’” 


If 
Galileohad 
been 
subjected 
to 
thismode 
of 
trial, 
the 
procès-verbal 
ofthe 
proceedings 
would 
certainly 
have 
been 
preserved 
along 
with 
the 
other 
records 
of 
the 
case. 
But, 
then, 
might 
not 
the 
examen 
rigorosum 
have 
taken 
place 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
the 
registrar; 
or 
might 
not 
the 
registrar, 
though 
he 
was 
present, 
have 
omitted 
to 
make 
a 
record? 
Both 
of 
these 
suppositions 
appear 
to 
be 
equally 
inadmissible, 
for 
they 
are 
in 
flat 
contradiction 
to 
all 
the 
precedents 
and 
all 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
tribunal. 
Neither 
can 
we 
suppose 
that 
the 
agent 
of 
the 
Holy 
Office 
suppressed 
the 
procès-verbal 
of 
the 
torture 
in 
order 
that 
both 
he 
and 
his 
principals 
might 
escape 
the 
indignation 
of 
posterity. 
This 
were 
gratuitously 
to 
transform 
an 
obscure, 
an 
irresponsible 
personage 
into 
an 
humanitarian 
philosopher 
who 
is 
ages 
ahead 
of 
the 
thought 
of 
his 
time 
and 
who 
purposely 
destroys 
a 
sorrowful 
page 
of 
history. 
The 
most 
probable 
account 
of 
what 
took 
place 
would 
be 
this: 
According 
to 
all 
the 
treatises 
on 
inquisitorial 
law, 
the 
commissary 
was 
authorized 
not 
to 
inflict 
torture 
on 
aged 
men, 
or 
on 
persons 
suffering 
from 
disease, 
who 
might 
die 
under 
the 
punishment. 
The 
advanced 
age 
of 
Galileo, 
and 
his 
infirmities, 
aggravated 
as 
they 
were 
by 
so 
much 
mental 
suffering, 
naturally 
placed 
him 
in 
the 
category 
of 
culprits 
who 
were 
not 
subjected 
to 
torture. 
If 
he 
was 
spared 
that 
dreadful 
infliction, 
Berti 
gives 
all 
the 
credit 
to 
the 
humanity 
of 
the 
father 
commissary; 
he 
even 
appears 
to 
think 
that, 
but 
for 
the 
kindly 
intervention 
of 
Father 
Macolano, 
the 
sovereign 
pontiff 
and 
the 
Congregation 
of 
the 
Holy 
Office 
would 
havegiven 
overGalileototheexecutioner. 


Let 
us 
be 
more 
fair. 
It 
would 
be 
a 
libel 
on 
Urban 
VIII. 
to 
represent 
him 
as 
thirsting 
for 
the 
blood 
and 
pleased 
with 
the 
sufferings 
of 
his 
old 
friend. 
The 
pontifical 
decree 
of 
June 
16th 
has 
this 
important 
proviso 
regarding 
the 
employment 
of 
torture, 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be 
used 
unless 
the 
accused 
could 
endure 
it. 
When 
he 
expressed 
himself 
thus, 
the 
sovereign 
pontiff 
was 
perfectly 
well 
aware 
that 
Galileo 
could 
not 
stand 
such 
a 
trial, 
and 
he 
consented 
beforehand, 
without 
needing 
to 
be 
entreated 
by 
the 
commissary, 
to 
the 
omission 
of 
the 
torture. 
What, 
indeed, 
would 
have 
been 
the 
use 
of 
such 
extreme 
rigor? 
Urban 
did 
not 
desire 
the 
death 
of 
the 
culprit; 
he 
wanted 
to 



make 
certain 
that 
Galileo 
would 
never 
more 
speak 
or 
write 
about 
the 
question 
of 
the 
earth’s 
motion; 
and 
it 
was 
in 
order 
to 
so 
strike 
him 
with 
terror 
as 
to 
insure 
his 
silence 
that 
of 
all 
the 
agonies 
of 
the 
trial 
he 
saved 
him 
only 
from 
the 
last 
— 
the 
only 
one 
that 
would 
have 
been 
of 
no 
use. 
The 
pope 
was 
not 
so 
cruel 
as 
Berti 
thinks, 
but 
neither 
did 
he 
give 
any 
sign 
of 
that 
compassion 
and 
indulgence 
toward 
the 
accused 
with 
which 
he 
is 
too 
often 
credited. 
This 
point 
is 
worth 
repeating, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
is 
the 
clearest 
result 
of 
Berti’s 
publication: 
the 
various 
phases 
of 
the 
trial 
of 
Galileo 
were 
not 
arranged 
with 
a 
view 
to 
theatrical 
effect, 
and 
to 
make 
an 
outward 
show 
of 
great 
severity, 
so 
as 
to 
intimidate 
the 
adherents 
of 
Galileo’s 
doctrine, 
while, 
behind 
the 
scenes, 
the 
culprit 
was 
treated 
with 
kindness. 
The 
threat 
of 
torture, 
the 
abjuration, 
the 
sequestration, 
were 
realities, 
and 
not, 
as 
has 
been 
supposed, 
simply 
monitions 
addressed 
to 
overbold 
men 
of 
science. 
At 
first, 
the 
court 
of 
Rome 
did 
not 
concern 
itself 
so 
much 
about 
impressing 
the 
imagination 
of 
the 
public 
as 
about 
striking 
Galileo. 
Here 
was 
a 
rebellious 
subject 
who 
had 
once 
before 
been 
treated 
with 
the 
greatest 
lenience, 
but 
who 
repaid 
the 
indulgence 
of 
the 
Holy 
Office 
with 
the 
transparent 
irony 
of 
his 
“Dialogues;” 
who 
had 
set 
snares 
for 
the 
person 
appointed 
to 
examine 
his 
manuscript; 
who, 
at 
his 
first 
interrogatory, 
had 
made 
sport 
of 
his 
judges, 
nay, 
perhaps 
of 
the 
sovereign 
pontiff 
himself: 
he 
must 
now 
be 
reduced 
to 
silence 
for 
good 
and 
all, 
by 
conducting 
him, 
through 
a 
series 
of 
moral 
tortures, 
to 
the 
uttermost 
limits 
of 
terror. 


At 
the 
same 
time 
the 
solemn 
form 
of 
his 
abjuration 
was 
calculated 
to 
prevent 
him 
from 
ever 
again 
inclining 
toward 
the 
Copernican 
doctrine. 
How 
could 
he 
embrace 
that 
doctrine 
again 
after 
he 
had 
openly 
pronounced 
it 
heretical, 
and 
promised, 
as 
he 
was 
compelled 
to 
do, 
to 
inform 
upon 
all 
persons 
suspected 
of 
this 
heresy? 
His 
judges, 
however, 
were 
not 
yet 
satisfied; 
he 
was 
feared 
even 
after 
his 
abjuration. 
He 
was 
confined 
at 
first 
in 
the 
palace 
of 
the 
Archbishop 
Piccolomini, 
at 
Siena, 
then 
at 
his 
own 
villa 
of 
Arcetri, 
near 
Florence, 
with 
leave 
to 
receive 
a 
few 
visits 
of 
relatives 
and 
friends, 
but 
on 
condition 
that 
several 
persons 
should 
never 
meet 
there 
to 
hold 
conversation. 
It 
was 
particularly 
feared 
that 
he 
would 
communicate 
with 
learned 
men 
abroad 
and 
in 
Italy. 
Father 
Castelli, 
his 
old 
pupil, 
in 
vain 
begged 
leave 
to 
see 
him, 
though 
he 
promised 
not 
to 
talk 
with 
him 
about 
the 
earth’s 
motion. 
In 
order 
to 
protect 
all 
other 
Catholic 
countries 
against 
the 
contagion 
of 
his 
ideas, 
the 
pope 
dispatched 
to 
all 
apostolic 
nuncios 
and 
to 
all 
inquisitors 
copies 
of 
the 
sentence 
pronounced 
on 
Galileo, 
and 
of 
his 
act 
of 
abjuration. 
At 
Florence 



his 
chief 
disciples 
and 
friends, 
especially 
the 
professors 
of 
mathematics, 
were 
summoned 
bynametolistentothereadingof 
these 
twodocuments. 


In 
shutting 
the 
mouth 
of 
a 
writer 
so 
gifted, 
so 
full 
of 
resources, 
so 
admired 
by 
the 
public, 
it 
was 
hoped 
that 
an 
end 
was 
made 
of 
the 
doctrine 
of 
Copernicus 
— 
that 
dangerous 
doctrine 
which 
alarmed 
the 
theologians 
by 
displacing 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
universe, 
ousting 
the 
earth 
from 
its 
primacy 
and 
substituting 
the 
sun, 
and 
opening 
the 
way 
for 
hypotheses 
of 
the 
plurality 
of 
worlds 
and 
the 
end 
of 
creation. 
But 
the 
effort 
was 
vain. 
The 
theory 
of 
the 
earth’s 
motion 
has 
survived 
all 
condemnations. 
It 
was 
not 
Galileo, 
as 
tradition 
would 
have 
it, 
that 
uttered 
the 
famous 
saying, 
“Eppur 
si 
muove” 
but 
the 
general 
voice 
of 
mankind 
who, 
after 
his 
death, 
thus 
proclaimed 
the 
undyingtruthofhis 
belief. 


Here 
we 
will 
stop. 
We 
would 
not 
weaken, 
by 
any 
comments 
of 
ours, 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
documents 
we 
have 
been 
examining. 
It 
is 
a 
fixed 
historical 
fact 
that 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
seventeenth 
century 
the 
Roman 
congregations, 
assuming 
to 
represent 
the 
Church, 
and 
not 
disavowed 
by 
her, 
made 
themselves 
the 
judges 
of 
a 
scientific 
question, 
and 
decided 
it 
in 
a 
way 
contrary 
to 
the 
conclusions 
of 
science. 
The 
splendor 
of 
Galileo’s 
genius 
and 
the 
commiseration 
inspired 
by 
his 
sufferings 
impress 
upon 
this 
discussion 
a 
tragical 
and 
popular 
character; 
but 
the 
emotion 
produced 
by 
his 
cruel 
fate 
must 
not 
blind 
us 
to 
the 
gravity 
of 
the 
problem. 
The 
great 
question 
was 
whether, 
in 
countries 
that 
were 
then 
Catholic 
and 
destined 
so 
to 
remain, 
Science 
could 
free 
herself 
from 
the 
dominion 
of 
Faith. 
The 
trial 
of 
Galileo, 
so 
far 
from 
retarding 
this 
conclusion, 
as 
is 
commonly 
supposed, 
on 
the 
contrary 
made 
it 
inevitable 
and 
urgent. 
So 
soon 
as 
the 
court 
of 
Rome 
saw 
how 
unwisely 
she 
had 
acted 
in 
deciding 
a 
question 
beyond 
her 
competence, 
thus 
laying 
herself 
open 
to 
the 
danger 
of 
being 
the 
next 
day 
convicted 
of 
error, 
it 
became 
her 
interest, 
no 
less 
than 
the 
interest 
of 
Science, 
to 
distinguish 
clearly 
between 
the 
two 
domains, 
Science 
and 
Faith. 
If, 
nowadays, 
she 
avoids 
entering 
into 
scientific 
controversies, 
it 
is 
because 
she 
has 
been 
taught 
by 
experience 
that 
a 
decision 
might 
compromise 
her. 
Her 
authority 
could 
hardly 
stand 
after 
a 
second 
edition 
of 
the 
sentence 
in 
which 
she 
once 
forbade 
the 
sun 
tostandstilland 
the 
earth 
torevolve. 



GALILEO 
by 
Robert 
S. 
Ball 



From 
‘Great 
Astronomers’, 
1895 


Among 
the 
ranks 
of 
the 
great 
astronomers 
it 
would 
be 
difficult 
to 
find 
one 
whose 
lifepresentsmoreinteresting 
featuresandremarkablevicissitudesthan 
does 
that 
of 
Galileo. 
We 
may 
consider 
him 
as 
the 
patient 
investigator 
and 
brilliant 
discoverer. 
We 
may 
consider 
him 
in 
his 
private 
relations, 
especially 
to 
his 
daughter, 
Sister 
Maria 
Celeste, 
a 
woman 
of 
very 
remarkable 
character; 
and 
we 
have 
also 
the 
pathetic 
drama 
at 
the 
close 
of 
Galileo’s 
life, 
when 
the 
philosopherdrewdownupon 
himself 
thethundersoftheInquisition. 


The 
materials 
for 
the 
sketch 
of 
this 
astonishing 
man 
are 
sufficiently 
abundant. 
We 
make 
special 
use 
in 
this 
place 
of 
those 
charming 
letters 
which 
his 
daughter 
wrote 
to 
him 
from 
her 
convent 
home. 
More 
than 
a 
hundred 
of 
these 
have 
been 
preserved, 
and 
it 
may 
well 
be 
doubted 
whether 
any 
more 
beautiful 
and 
touching 
series 
of 
letters 
addressedtoa 
parentby 
adearlyloved 
child 
have 
ever 
been 
written. 
An 
admirable 
account 
of 
this 
correspondence 
is 
contained 
in 
a 
little 
book 
entitled 
“The 
Private 
Life 
of 
Galileo,” 
published 
anonymously 
by 
Messrs. 
Macmillan 
in 
1870, 
and 
I 
have 
been 
much 
indebted 
totheauthorofthatvolumefor 
many 
ofthefactscontainedinthischapter. 


Galileo 
was 
born 
at 
Pisa, 
on 
18th 
February, 
1564. 
He 
was 
the 
eldest 
son 
of 
Vincenzo 
de’ 
Bonajuti 
de’ 
Galilei, 
a 
Florentine 
noble. 
Notwithstanding 
his 
illustrious 
birth 
and 
descent, 
it 
would 
seem 
that 
the 
home 
in 
which 
the 
great 
philosopher’s 
childhood 
was 
spent 
was 
an 
impoverished 
one. 
It 
was 
obvious 
at 
least 
that 
the 
young 
Galileo 
would 
have 
to 
be 
provided 
with 
some 
profession 
by 
which 
he 
might 
earn 
a 
livelihood. 
From 
his 
father 
he 
derived 
both 
by 
inheritance 
and 
by 
precept 
a 
keen 
taste 
for 
music, 
and 
it 
appears 
that 
he 
became 
an 
excellent 
performer 
on 
the 
lute. 
He 
was 
also 
endowed 
with 
considerable 
artistic 
power, 
which 
he 
cultivated 
diligently. 
Indeed, 
it 
would 
seem 
that 
for 
some 
time 
the 
future 
astronomer 
entertained 
the 
idea 
of 
devoting 
himself 
to 
painting 
as 
a 
profession. 
His 
father, 
however, 
decided 
that 
he 
should 
study 
medicine. 
Accordingly, 
we 
find 
that 
when 
Galileo 
was 
seventeen 
years 
of 
age, 
and 
had 
added 
a 
knowledge 
of 
Greek 
and 
Latin 
to 
his 
acquaintancewith 
the 
finearts,hewasdulyenteredattheUniversityofPisa. 



Here 
the 
young 
philosopher 
obtained 
some 
inkling 
of 
mathematics, 
whereupon 
he 
became 
so 
much 
interested 
in 
this 
branch 
of 
science, 
that 
he 
begged 
to 
be 
allowed 
to 
study 
geometry. 
In 
compliance 
with 
his 
request, 
his 
father 
permitted 
a 
tutor 
to 
be 
engaged 
for 
this 
purpose; 
but 
he 
did 
so 
with 
reluctance, 
fearing 
that 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
young 
student 
might 
thus 
be 
withdrawn 
from 
that 
medical 
work 
which 
was 
regarded 
as 
his 
primary 
occupation. 
The 
event 
speedily 
proved 
that 
these 
anxieties 
were 
not 
without 
some 
justification. 
The 
propositions 
of 
Euclid 
proved 
so 
engrossing 
to 
Galileo 
that 
it 
was 
thought 
wise 
to 
avoid 
further 
distraction 
by 
terminating 
the 
mathematical 
tutor’s 
engagement. 
But 
it 
was 
too 
late 
for 
the 
desired 
end 
to 
be 
attained. 
Galileo 
had 
now 
made 
such 
progress 
that 
he 
was 
able 
to 
continue 
his 
geometrical 
studies 
by 
himself. 
Presently 
he 
advanced 
to 
that 
famous 
47th 
proposition 
which 
won 
his 
lively 
admiration, 
and 
on 
he 
went 
until 
he 
had 
mastered 
the 
six 
books 
of 
Euclid, 
which 
was 
a 
considerable 
achievement 
for 
those 
days. 


The 
diligence 
and 
brilliance 
of 
the 
young 
student 
at 
Pisa 
did 
not, 
however, 
bring 
him 
much 
credit 
with 
the 
University 
authorities. 
In 
those 
days 
the 
doctrines 
of 
Aristotle 
were 
regarded 
as 
the 
embodiment 
of 
all 
human 
wisdom 
in 
natural 
science 
as 
well 
as 
in 
everything 
else. 
It 
was 
regarded 
as 
the 
duty 
of 
every 
student 
to 
learn 
Aristotle 
off 
by 
heart, 
and 
any 
disposition 
to 
doubt 
or 
even 
to 
question 
the 
doctrines 
of 
the 
venerated 
teacher 
was 
regarded 
as 
intolerable 
presumption. 
But 
young 
Galileo 
had 
the 
audacity 
to 
think 
for 
himself 
about 
the 
laws 
of 
nature. 
He 
would 
not 
take 
any 
assertion 
of 
fact 
on 
the 
authority 
of 
Aristotle 
when 
he 
had 
the 
means 
of 
questioning 
nature 
directly 
as 
to 
its 
truth 
or 
falsehood. 
His 
teachers 
thus 
came 
to 
regard 
him 
as 
a 
somewhat 
misguided 
youth, 
though 
they 
could 
not 
but 
respect 
the 
unflagging 
industrywithwhichheamassed 
all 
the 
knowledgehecouldacquire. 



GALILEO’SPENDULUM. 


We 
are 
so 
accustomed 
to 
the 
use 
of 
pendulums 
in 
our 
clocks 
that 
perhaps 
we 
do 
not 
often 
realise 
that 
the 
introduction 
of 
this 
method 
of 
regulating 
time-pieces 
was 
really 
a 
notable 
invention 
worthy 
the 
fame 
of 
the 
great 
astronomer 
to 
whom 
it 
was 
due. 
It 
appears 
that 
sitting 
one 
day 
in 
the 
CathedralofPisa,Galileo’sattentionbecameconcentratedontheswingingof 
a 
chandelier 
which 
hung 
from 
the 
ceiling. 
It 
struck 
him 
as 
a 
significant 
point, 
that 
whether 
the 
arc 
through 
which 
the 
pendulum 
oscillated 
was 
a 
long 
one 
or 
a 
short 
one, 
the 
time 
occupied 
in 
each 
vibration 
was 
sensibly 
the 
same. 
This 
suggested 
to 
the 
thoughtful 
observer 
that 
a 
pendulum 
would 
afford 
the 
means 
by 
which 
a 
time-keeper 
might 
be 
controlled, 
and 
accordingly 
Galileo 
constructed 
for 
the 
first 
time 
a 
clock 
on 
this 
principle. 
The 
immediate 
object 
sought 
in 
this 
apparatus 
was 
to 
provide 
a 
means 
of 
aiding 
physicians 
in 
counting 
thepulsesoftheir 
patients. 



The 
talents 
of 
Galileo 
having 
at 
length 
extorted 
due 
recognition 
from 
the 
authorities, 
he 
was 
appointed, 
at 
the 
age 
of 
twenty-five, 
Professor 
of 
Mathematics 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Pisa. 
Then 
came 
the 
time 
when 
he 
felt 
himself 
strong 
enough 
to 
throw 
down 
the 
gauntlet 
to 
the 
adherents 
of 
the 
old 
philosophy. 
As 
a 
necessary 
part 
of 
his 
doctrine 
on 
the 
movement 
of 
bodies 
Aristotle 
had 
asserted 
that 
the 
time 
occupied 
by 
a 
stone 
in 
falling 
depends 
upon 
its 
weight, 
so 
that 
the 
heavier 
the 
stone 
the 
less 
time 
would 
it 
require 
to 
fall 
from 
a 
certain 
height 
to 
the 
earth. 
It 
might 
have 
been 
thought 
that 
a 
statement 
so 
easily 
confuted 
by 
the 
simplest 
experiments 
could 
never 
have 
maintained 
its 
position 
in 
any 
accepted 
scheme 
of 
philosophy. 
But 
Aristotle 
had 
said 
it, 
and 
to 
anyone 
who 
ventured 
to 
express 
a 
doubt 
the 
ready 
sneer 
was 
forthcoming, 
“Do 
you 
think 
yourself 
a 
cleverer 
man 
than 
Aristotle?” 
Galileo 
determinedtodemonstrate 
in 
the 
mostemphatic 
manner 
the 
absurdity 
ofadoctrine 
whichhadforcenturiesreceived 
thesanctionof 
thelearned. 
The 
summit 
of 
the 
Leaning 
Tower 
of 
Pisa 
offered 
a 
highly 
dramatic 
site 
for 
the 
great 
experiment. 
The 
youthful 
professor 
let 
fall 
from 
the 
overhanging 
top 
a 
large 
heavy 
body 
and 
a 
small 
light 
body 
simultaneously. 
According 
to 
Aristotle 
the 
large 
body 
ought 
to 
have 
reached 
the 
ground 
much 
sooner 
than 
the 
small 
one, 
but 
such 
was 
found 
not 
to 
be 
the 
case. 
In 
the 
sight 
of 
a 
large 
concourse 
of 
people 
the 
simple 
fact 
was 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
two 
bodies 
fell 
side 
by 
side, 
and 
reached 
the 
ground 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
Thus 
the 
first 
great 
step 
was 
taken 
in 
the 
overthrow 
of 
that 
preposterous 
system 
of 
unquestioning 
adhesion 
to 
dogma, 
which 
had 
impeded 
the 
development 
of 
the 
knowledge 
of 
naturefornearlytwo 
thousandyears. 


This 
revolutionary 
attitude 
towards 
the 
ancient 
beliefs 
was 
not 
calculated 
to 
render 
Galileo’s 
relations 
with 
the 
University 
authorities 
harmonious. 
He 
had 
also 
the 
misfortune 
to 
make 
enemies 
in 
other 
quarters. 
Don 
Giovanni 
de 
Medici, 
who 
was 
then 
the 
Governor 
of 
the 
Port 
of 
Leghorn, 
had 
designed 
some 
contrivance 
by 
which 
he 
proposed 
to 
pump 
out 
a 
dock. 
But 
Galileo 
showed 
up 
the 
absurdity 
of 
this 
enterprise 
in 
such 
an 
aggressive 
manner 
that 
Don 
Giovanni 
took 
mortal 
offence, 
nor 
was 
he 
mollified 
when 
the 
truths 
of 
Galileo’s 
criticisms 
were 
abundantly 
verified 
by 
the 
total 
failure 
of 
his 
ridiculous 
invention. 
In 
various 
ways 
Galileo 
was 
made 
to 
feel 
his 
position 
at 
Pisa 
so 
unpleasant 
that 
he 
was 
at 
length 
compelled 
to 
abandon 
his 
chair 
in 
the 
University. 
The 
active 
exertions 
of 
his 
friends, 
of 
whom 
Galileo 
was 
so 
fortunate 
as 
to 
have 
had 
throughout 
his 
life 
an 
abundant 
supply, 
then 
secured 



his 
election 
to 
the 
Professorship 
of 
Mathematics 
at 
Padua, 
whither 
he 
went 
in 
1592. 



PORTRAITOFGALILEO. 


It 
was 
in 
this 
new 
position 
that 
Galileo 
entered 
on 
that 
marvellous 
career 
of 
investigation 
which 
was 
destined 
to 
revolutionize 
science. 
The 
zeal 
with 
which 
he 
discharged 
his 
professorial 
duties 
was 
indeed 
of 
the 
most 
unremitting 
character. 
He 
speedily 
drew 
such 
crowds 
to 
listen 
to 
his 
discourses 
on 
Natural 
Philosophy 
that 
his 
lecture-room 
was 
filled 
to 
overflowing. 
He 
also 
received 
many 
private 
pupils 
in 
his 
house 
for 
special 
instruction. 
Every 
moment 
that 
could 
be 
spared 
from 
these 
labours 
was 
devotedtohisprivatestudyandto 
his 
incessantexperiments. 


Like 
many 
another 
philosopher 
who 
has 
greatly 
extended 
our 
knowledge 
of 
nature, 
Galileo 
had 
a 
remarkable 
aptitude 
for 
the 
invention 
of 
instruments 
designed 
for 
philosophical 
research. 
To 
facilitate 
his 
practical 
work, 
we 
find 



that 
in 
1599 
he 
had 
engaged 
a 
skilled 
workman 
who 
was 
to 
live 
in 
his 
house, 
and 
thus 
be 
constantly 
at 
hand 
to 
try 
the 
devices 
for 
ever 
springing 
from 
Galileo’s 
fertile 
brain. 
Among 
the 
earliest 
of 
his 
inventions 
appears 
to 
have 
been 
the 
thermometer, 
which 
he 
constructed 
in 
1602. 
No 
doubt 
this 
apparatus 
in 
its 
primitive 
form 
differed 
in 
some 
respects 
from 
the 
contrivance 
we 
call 
by 
the 
same 
name. 
Galileo 
at 
first 
employed 
water 
as 
the 
agent, 
by 
the 
expansion 
of 
which 
the 
temperature 
was 
to 
be 
measured. 
He 
afterwards 
saw 
theadvantage 
ofusing 
spirits 
forthe 
same 
purpose. 
It 
was 
not 
until 
about 
half 
a 
century 
later 
that 
mercury 
came 
to 
be 
recognised 
as 
the 
liquid 
most 
generallysuitableforthethermometer. 


The 
time 
was 
now 
approaching 
when 
Galileo 
was 
to 
make 
that 
mighty 
step 
in 
the 
advancement 
of 
human 
knowledge 
which 
followed 
on 
the 
application 
of 
the 
telescope 
to 
astronomy. 
As 
to 
how 
his 
idea 
of 
such 
an 
instrument 
originated, 
we 
had 
best 
let 
him 
tell 
us 
in 
his 
own 
words. 
The 
passageisgiveninaletterwhichhewrites 
tohisbrother-in-law,Landucci. 


“I 
write 
now 
because 
I 
have 
a 
piece 
of 
news 
for 
you, 
though 
whether 
you 
will 
be 
glad 
or 
sorry 
to 
hear 
it 
I 
cannot 
say; 
for 
I 
have 
now 
no 
hope 
of 
returning 
to 
my 
own 
country, 
though 
the 
occurrence 
which 
has 
destroyed 
that 
hope 
has 
had 
results 
both 
useful 
and 
honourable. 
You 
must 
know, 
then, 
that 
two 
months 
ago 
there 
was 
a 
report 
spread 
here 
that 
in 
Flanders 
some 
one 
had 
presented 
to 
Count 
Maurice 
of 
Nassau 
a 
glass 
manufactured 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
make 
distant 
objects 
appear 
very 
near, 
so 
that 
a 
man 
at 
the 
distance 
of 
two 
miles 
could 
be 
clearly 
seen. 
This 
seemed 
to 
me 
so 
marvellous 
that 
I 
began 
to 
think 
about 
it. 
As 
it 
appeared 
to 
me 
to 
have 
a 
foundation 
in 
the 
Theory 
of 
Perspective, 
I 
set 
about 
contriving 
how 
to 
make 
it, 
and 
at 
length 
I 
found 
out, 
and 
have 
succeeded 
so 
well 
that 
the 
one 
I 
have 
made 
is 
far 
superior 
to 
the 
Dutch 
telescope. 
It 
was 
reported 
in 
Venice 
that 
I 
had 
made 
one, 
and 
a 
week 
since 
I 
was 
commanded 
to 
show 
it 
to 
his 
Serenity 
and 
to 
all 
the 
members 
of 
the 
senate, 
to 
their 
infinite 
amazement. 
Many 
gentlemen 
and 
senators, 
even 
the 
oldest, 
have 
ascended 
at 
various 
times 
the 
highest 
bell-towers 
in 
Venice 
to 
spy 
out 
ships 
at 
sea 
making 
sail 
for 
the 
mouth 
of 
the 
harbour, 
and 
have 
seen 
them 
clearly, 
though 
without 
my 
telescope 
they 
would 
have 
been 
invisible 
for 
more 
than 
two 
hours. 
The 
effect 
of 
this 
instrument 
is 
to 
show 
an 
object 
ata 
distanceof 
sayfifty 
miles,asif 
itwerebutfivemiles.” 


The 
remarkable 
properties 
of 
the 
telescope 
at 
once 
commanded 
universal 
attention 
among 
intellectual 
men. 
Galileo 
received 
applications 
from 
several 



quarters 
for 
his 
new 
instrument, 
of 
which 
it 
would 
seem 
that 
he 
manufactured 
a 
large 
number 
tobedistributedasgifts 
tovariousillustriouspersonages. 


But 
it 
was 
reserved 
for 
Galileo 
himself 
to 
make 
that 
application 
of 
the 
instrument 
to 
the 
celestial 
bodies 
by 
which 
its 
peculiar 
powers 
were 
to 
inaugurate 
the 
new 
era 
in 
astronomy. 
The 
first 
discovery 
that 
was 
made 
in 
this 
direction 
appears 
to 
have 
been 
connected 
with 
the 
number 
of 
the 
stars. 
Galileo 
saw 
to 
his 
amazement 
that 
through 
his 
little 
tube 
he 
could 
count 
ten 
times 
as 
many 
stars 
in 
the 
sky 
as 
his 
unaided 
eye 
could 
detect. 
Here 
was, 
indeed, 
a 
surprise. 
We 
are 
now 
so 
familiar 
with 
the 
elementary 
facts 
of 
astronomy 
that 
it 
is 
not 
always 
easy 
to 
realise 
how 
the 
heavens 
were 
interpreted 
by 
the 
observers 
in 
those 
ages 
prior 
to 
the 
invention 
of 
the 
telescope. 
We 
can 
hardly, 
indeed, 
suppose 
that 
Galileo, 
like 
the 
majority 
of 
those 
who 
ever 
thought 
of 
such 
matters, 
entertained 
the 
erroneous 
belief 
that 
the 
stars 
were 
on 
the 
surface 
of 
a 
sphere 
at 
equal 
distances 
from 
the 
observer. 
No 
one 
would 
be 
likely 
to 
have 
retained 
his 
belief 
in 
such 
a 
doctrine 
when 
he 
saw 
how 
the 
number 
of 
visible 
stars 
could 
be 
increased 
tenfold 
by 
means 
of 
Galileo’s 
telescope. 
It 
would 
have 
been 
almost 
impossible 
to 
refuse 
to 
draw 
the 
inference 
that 
the 
stars 
thus 
brought 
into 
view 
were 
still 
more 
remote 
objects 
which 
the 
telescope 
was 
able 
to 
reveal, 
just 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
it 
showed 
certain 
ships 
to 
the 
astonished 
Venetians, 
when 
at 
the 
time 
these 
shipswerebeyondthereachofunaidedvision. 


Galileo’s 
celestial 
discoveries 
now 
succeeded 
each 
other 
rapidly. 
That 
beautiful 
Milky 
Way, 
which 
has 
for 
ages 
been 
the 
object 
of 
admiration 
to 
all 
lovers 
of 
nature, 
never 
disclosed 
its 
true 
nature 
to 
the 
eye 
of 
man 
till 
the 
astronomer 
of 
Padua 
turned 
on 
it 
his 
magic 
tube. 
The 
splendid 
zone 
of 
silvery 
light 
was 
then 
displayed 
as 
star-dust 
scattered 
over 
the 
black 
background 
of 
the 
sky. 
It 
was 
observed 
that 
though 
the 
individual 
stars 
were 
too 
small 
to 
be 
seen 
severally 
without 
optical 
aid, 
yet 
such 
was 
their 
incredible 
number 
that 
the 
celestial 
radiance 
produced 
that 
luminosity 
with 
which 
every 
stargazer 
was 
sofamiliar. 


But 
the 
greatest 
discovery 
made 
by 
the 
telescope 
in 
these 
early 
days, 
perhaps, 
indeed, 
the 
greatest 
discovery 
that 
the 
telescope 
has 
ever 
accomplished, 
was 
the 
detection 
of 
the 
system 
of 
four 
satellites 
revolving 
around 
the 
great 
planet 
Jupiter. 
This 
phenomenon 
was 
so 
wholly 
unexpected 
by 
Galileo 
that, 
at 
first, 
he 
could 
hardly 
believe 
his 
eyes. 
However, 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
system 
of 
four 
moons 
attending 
the 
great 
planet 
was 
soon 
established 
beyond 
all 
question. 
Numbers 
of 
great 
personages 
crowded 



to 
Galileo 
to 
see 
for 
themselves 
this 
beautiful 
miniature 
representing 
the 
sun 
withits 
systemofrevolvingplanets. 


Of 
course 
there 
were, 
as 
usual, 
a 
few 
incredulous 
people 
who 
refused 
to 
believe 
the 
assertion 
that 
four 
more 
moving 
bodies 
had 
to 
be 
added 
to 
the 
planetarysystem. 
They 
scoffed 
atthenotion;they 
saidthesatellitesmay 
have 
been 
in 
the 
telescope, 
but 
that 
they 
were 
not 
in 
the 
sky. 
One 
sceptical 
philosopher 
is 
reported 
to 
have 
affirmed, 
that 
even 
if 
he 
saw 
the 
moons 
of 
Jupiter 
himself 
he 
would 
not 
believe 
in 
them, 
as 
their 
existence 
was 
contrary 
totheprinciplesof 
common-sense! 


There 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
that 
a 
special 
significance 
attached 
to 
the 
new 
discovery 
at 
this 
particular 
epoch 
in 
the 
history 
of 
science. 
It 
must 
be 
remembered 
that 
in 
those 
days 
the 
doctrine 
of 
Copernicus, 
declaring 
that 
the 
sun, 
and 
not 
the 
earth, 
was 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
system, 
that 
the 
earth 
revolved 
on 
its 
axis 
once 
a 
day, 
and 
that 
it 
described 
a 
mighty 
circle 
round 
the 
sun 
once 
a 
year, 
had 
only 
recently 
been 
promulgated. 
This 
new 
view 
of 
the 
scheme 
of 
nature 
had 
been 
encountered 
with 
the 
most 
furious 
opposition. 
It 
may 
possibly 
have 
been 
that 
Galileo 
himself 
had 
not 
felt 
quite 
confident 
in 
the 
soundness 
of 
the 
Copernican 
theory, 
prior 
to 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
satellites 
of 
Jupiter. 
But 
when 
a 
picture 
was 
there 
exhibited 
in 
which 
a 
number 
of 
relatively 
small 
globes 
were 
shown 
to 
be 
revolving 
around 
a 
single 
large 
globe 
in 
the 
centre, 
it 
seemed 
impossible 
not 
to 
feel 
that 
the 
beautiful 
spectacle 
so 
displayed 
was 
an 
emblem 
of 
the 
relations 
of 
the 
planets 
to 
the 
sun. 
It 
was 
thus 
made 
manifest 
to 
Galileo 
that 
the 
Copernican 
theory 
of 
the 
planetary 
system 
must 
be 
the 
true 
one. 
The 
momentous 
import 
of 
this 
opinion 
uponthefuturewelfareofthegreatphilosopherwillpresently 
appear. 


It 
would 
seem 
that 
Galileo 
regarded 
his 
residence 
at 
Padua 
as 
a 
state 
of 
undesirable 
exile 
from 
his 
beloved 
Tuscany. 
He 
had 
always 
a 
yearning 
to 
go 
back 
to 
his 
own 
country 
and 
at 
last 
the 
desired 
opportunity 
presented 
itself. 
For 
now 
that 
Galileo’s 
fame 
had 
become 
so 
great, 
the 
Grand 
Duke 
of 
Tuscany 
desired 
to 
have 
the 
philosopher 
resident 
at 
Florence, 
in 
the 
belief 
that 
he 
would 
shed 
lustre 
on 
the 
Duke’s 
dominions. 
Overtures 
were 
accordingly 
made 
to 
Galileo, 
and 
the 
consequence 
was 
that 
in 
1616 
we 
find 
him 
residing 
at 
Florence, 
bearing 
the 
title 
of 
Mathematician 
and 
Philosopher 
totheGrandDuke. 


Two 
daughters, 
Polissena 
and 
Virginia, 
and 
one 
son, 
Vincenzo, 
had 
been 
born 
to 
Galileo 
in 
Padua. 
It 
was 
the 
custom 
in 
those 
days 
that 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
daughter 
of 
an 
Italian 
gentleman 
had 
grown 
up, 
her 
future 
career 
was 



somewhat 
summarily 
decided. 
Either 
a 
husband 
was 
to 
be 
forthwith 
sought 
out, 
or 
she 
was 
to 
enter 
the 
convent 
with 
the 
object 
of 
taking 
the 
veil 
as 
a 
professed 
nun. 
It 
was 
arranged 
that 
the 
two 
daughters 
of 
Galileo, 
while 
still 
scarcely 
more 
than 
children, 
should 
both 
enter 
the 
Franciscan 
convent 
of 
St. 
Matthew, 
at 
Arcetri. 
The 
elder 
daughter 
Polissena, 
took 
the 
name 
of 
Sister 
Maria 
Celeste, 
while 
Virginia 
became 
Sister 
Arcangela. 
The 
latter 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
always 
delicate 
and 
subject 
to 
prolonged 
melancholy, 
and 
she 
is 
of 
but 
little 
account 
in 
the 
narrative 
of 
the 
life 
of 
Galileo. 
But 
Sister 
Maria 
Celeste, 
though 
never 
leaving 
the 
convent, 
managed 
to 
preserve 
a 
close 
intimacy 
with 
her 
beloved 
father. 
This 
was 
maintained 
only 
partly 
by 
Galileo’s 
visits, 
which 
were 
very 
irregular 
and 
were, 
indeed, 
often 
suspended 
for 
long 
intervals. 
But 
his 
letters 
to 
this 
daughter 
were 
evidently 
frequent 
and 
affectionate, 
especially 
in 
the 
latter 
part 
of 
his 
life. 
Most 
unfortunately, 
however, 
all 
his 
letters 
have 
been 
lost. 
There 
are 
grounds 
for 
believing 
that 
they 
were 
deliberately 
destroyed 
when 
Galileo 
was 
seized 
by 
the 
Inquisition, 
lest 
they 
should 
have 
been 
used 
as 
evidence 
against 
him, 
or 
lest 
they 
should 
have 
compromised 
the 
convent 
where 
they 
were 
received. 
But 
Sister 
Maria 
Celeste’s 
letters 
to 
her 
father 
have 
happily 
been 
preserved, 
and 
most 
touching 
these 
letters 
are. 
We 
can 
hardly 
read 
them 
without 
thinking 
how 
the 
sweet 
and 
gentlenunwould

oftheirpublication. 


Her 
loving 
little 
notes 
to 
her 
“dearest 
lord 
and 
father,” 
as 
she 
used 
affectionately 
to 
call 
Galileo, 
were 
almost 
invariably 
accompanied 
by 
some 
gift, 
trifling 
it 
may 
be, 
but 
always 
the 
best 
the 
poor 
nun 
had 
to 
bestow. 
The 
tender 
grace 
of 
these 
endearing 
communications 
was 
all 
the 
more 
precious 
to 
him 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
rest 
of 
Galileo’s 
relatives 
were 
of 
quite 
a 
worthless 
description. 
He 
always 
acknowledged 
the 
ties 
of 
his 
kindred 
in 
the 
most 
generous 
way, 
but 
their 
follies 
and 
their 
vices, 
their 
selfishness 
and 
their 
importunities, 
were 
an 
incessant 
source 
of 
annoyance 
to 
him, 
almost 
to 
the 
lastdayofhislife. 


On19thDecember,1625,Sister 
MariaCelestewrites: 
— 


“I 
send 
two 
baked 
pears 
for 
these 
days 
of 
vigil. 
But 
as 
the 
greatest 
treat 
of 
all, 
I 
send 
you 
a 
rose, 
which 
ought 
to 
please 
you 
extremely, 
seeing 
what 
a 
rarity 
it 
is 
at 
this 
season; 
and 
with 
the 
rose 
you 
must 
accept 
its 
thorns, 
which 
represent 
the 
bitter 
passion 
of 
our 
Lord, 
whilst 
the 
green 
leaves 
represent 
the 
hope 
we 
may 
entertain 
that 
through 
the 
same 
sacred 
passion 
we, 
having 
passed 
through 
the 
darkness 
of 
the 
short 
winter 
of 
our 
mortal 
life, 
may 
attain 
tothebrightnessandfelicityofaneternal

When 
the 
wife 
and 
children 
of 
Galileo’s 
shiftless 
brother 
came 
to 
take 
up

MariaCelestefeelsglad 
tothink 
that 
her 
father 
has 
now 
some 
one 
who, 
however 
imperfectly, 
may 
fulfil 
the 
duty 
of 
looking 
after 
him. 
A 
graceful 
note 
on 
Christmas 
Eve 
accompanies 
her

Shehopesthat 
— 


“In 
these 
holy 
days 
the 
peace 
of 
God 
may 
rest 
on 
him 
and 
all 
the 
house. 
The 
largest 
collar 
and 
sleeves 
I 
mean 
for 
Albertino, 
the 
other 
two 
for 
the 
two 
younger 
boys, 
the 
little 
dog 
for

and 
the 
cakes 
for 
everybody, 
except 
the 
spice-cakes, 
which 
are 
for 
you. 
Accept 
the 
good-will 
which 
would 
readily 
do 
muchmore.” 


The 
extraordinary 
forbearance 
with 
which 
Galileo 
continually 
placed 
his 
time, 
his 
purse, 
and 
his 
influence 
at 
the 
service 
of 
those 
who 
had 
repeatedly 
proved 
themselves 
utterly 
unworthy 
of 
his 
countenance, 
is 
thus 
commented 
onbythegood 
nun. 
— 


“Now 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
dearest 
lord 
and 
father, 
that 
your 
lordship 
is 
walking 
in 
the 
right 
path, 
since 
you 
take 
hold 
of 
every 
occasion 
that 
presents 
itself 
to 
shower 
continual 
benefits 
on 
those 
who 
only 
repay 
you 
with 
ingratitude. 
This 
is 
an 
action 
which 
is 
all 
the 
more 
virtuous 
and 
perfect 
as 
it 
is 
the 
more 
difficult.” 


When 
the 
plague 
was 
raging 
in 
the 
neighbourhood, 
the 
loving 
daughter’s 
solicitudeis 
thusshown: 
— 


“I 
send 
you 
two 
pots 
of 
electuary 
as 
a 
preventive 
against 
the 
plague. 
The 
one 
without 
the 
label 
consists 
of 
dried 
figs, 
walnuts, 
rue, 
and 
salt, 
mixed 
together 
with 
honey.

of 
the 
size 
of 
a 
walnut 
to 
be 
taken 
in

little 
Greekwine.” 


The 
plague 
increasing 
still 
more, 
Sister 
Maria 
Celeste 
obtained 
with 
much 
difficulty, 
a 
smallquantity 
of 
a 
renownedliqueur,made

Ursula, 
an

nun.

“I

For 
if

Whether 
Galileo 
took 
the

we 
do 
not 
know, 
but 
at 
all 
events 
he 
escapedthe

THEVILLAARCETRI. 
Galileo’sresidence,where 
Miltonvisitedhim. 


From 
Galileo’s 
new 
home 
in 
Florence 
the 
telescope 
was 
again 
directed 
to 
the 
skies, 
and 
again 
did 
astounding 
discoveries 
reward 
the 
astronomer’s 
labours. 
The 
great 
success 
which 
he 
had 
met 
with 
in 
studying 
Jupiter 
naturally 
led 
Galileo 
to 
look 
at 
Saturn. 
Here 
he 
saw 
a 
spectacle 
which 
was 
sufficiently 
amazing, 
though 
he 
failed 
to 
interpret 
it 
accurately. 
It 
was 
quite 
manifest 
that 
Saturn 
did 
not 
exhibit 
a 
simple 
circular 
disc 
like 
Jupiter, 
or 
like 
Mars. 
It 
seemed 
to 
Galileo 
as 
if 
the 
planet 
consisted 
of 
three 
bodies, 
a 
large 
globe 
in 
the 
centre, 
and 
a 
smaller 
one 
on 
each 
side. 
The 
enigmatical 
nature 
of 
the 
discovery 
led 
Galileo 
to 
announce 
it 
in 
an 
enigmatical 
manner. 
He 
published 
a 
string 
of 
letters 
which, 
when 
duly 
transposed, 
made 
up 
a 
sentence 
which 
affirmed 
that 
the 
planet 
Saturn 
was 
threefold. 
Of 
course 
we 
now 
know 
that 
this 
remarkable 
appearance 
of 
the 
planet 
was 
due 
to 
the 
two 
projecting 
portions 
of 
the 
ring. 
With 
the 
feeble 
power 
of 
Galileo’s 
telescope, 
these 
seemedmerelylike 
smallglobesorappendages 
tothelargecentralbody. 


The 
last 
of 
Galileo’s 
great 
astronomical 
discoveries 
related 
to 
the 
libration 
of 
the 
moon. 
I 
think 
that 
the 
detection 
of 
this 
phenomenon 
shows 
his 
acuteness 
of 
observation 
more 
remarkably 
than 
does 
any 
one 
of 
his 
other 



achievements 
with 
the 
telescope. 
It 
is 
well 
known 
that 
the 
moon 
constantly 
keeps 
the 
same 
face 
turned 
towards 
the 
earth. 
When, 
however, 
careful 
measurements 
have 
been 
made 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
spots 
and 
marks 
on 
the 
lunar 
surface, 
it 
is 
found 
that 
there 
is 
a 
slight 
periodic 
variation 
which 
permits 
us 
to 
see 
now 
a 
little 
to 
the 
east 
or 
to 
the 
west, 
now 
a 
little 
to 
the 
north 
or 
to 
thesouthoftheaveragelunardisc. 


But 
the 
circumstances 
which 
make 
the 
career 
of 
Galileo 
so 
especially 
interesting 
from 
the 
biographer’s 
point 
of 
view, 
are 
hardly 
so 
much 
the 
triumphs 
that 
he 
won 
asthe 
sufferingsthathe 
endured. 
The 
sufferings 
and 
the 
triumphs 
were, 
however, 
closely 
connected, 
and 
it 
is 
fitting 
that 
we 
should 
give 
due 
consideration 
to 
what 
was 
perhaps 
the 
greatest 
drama 
in 
the 
history 
ofscience. 


On 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
immortal 
work 
of 
Copernicus, 
in 
which 
it 
was 
taught 
that 
the 
earth 
rotated 
on 
its 
axis, 
and 
that 
the 
earth, 
like 
the 
other 
planets, 
revolved 
round 
the 
sun, 
orthodoxy 
stood 
aghast. 
The 
Holy 
Roman 
Church 
submitted 
this 
treatise, 
which 
bore 
the 
name 
“De 
Revolutionibus 
Orbium 
Coelestium,” 
to 
the 
Congregation 
of 
the 
Index. 
After 
due 
examination 
it 
was 
condemned 
as 
heretical 
in 
1615. 
Galileo 
was 
suspected, 
on 
no 
doubt 
excellent 
grounds, 
of 
entertaining 
the 
objectionable 
views 
of 
Copernicus. 
He 
was 
accordingly 
privately 
summoned 
before 
Cardinal 
Bellarmine 
on 
26th 
February 
1616, 
and 
duly 
admonished 
that 
he 
was 
on 
no 
account 
to 
teach 
or 
to 
defend 
the 
obnoxious 
doctrines. 
Galileo 
was 
much 
distressed 
by 
this 
intimation. 
He 
felt 
it 
a 
serious 
matter 
to 
be 
deprived 
of 
the 
privilege 
of 
discoursing 
with 
his 
friends 
about 
the 
Copernican 
system, 
and 
of 
instructing 
his 
disciples 
in 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
great 
theory 
of 
whose 
truth 
he 
was 
perfectly 
convinced. 
It 
pained 
him, 
however, 
still 
more 
to 
think, 
devout 
Catholic 
as 
he 
was, 
that 
such 
suspicions 
of 
his 
fervent 
allegiance 
to 
his 
Church 
should 
ever 
have 
existed, 
as 
were 
implied 
by 
the 
words 
and 
monitionsofCardinalBellarmine. 


In 
1616, 
Galileo 
had 
an 
interview 
with 
Pope 
Paul 
V., 
who 
received 
the 
great 
astronomer 
very 
graciously, 
and 
walked 
up 
and 
down 
with 
him 
in 
conversation 
for 
three-quarters 
of 
an 
hour. 
Galileo 
complained 
to 
his 
Holiness 
of 
the 
attempts 
made 
by 
his 
enemies 
to 
embarrass 
him 
with 
the 
authorities 
of 
the 
Church, 
but 
the 
Pope 
bade 
him 
be 
comforted. 
His 
Holiness 
had 
himself 
no 
doubts 
of 
Galileo’s 
orthodoxy, 
and 
he 
assured 
him 
that 
the 
Congregation 
of 
the 
Index 
should 
give 
Galileo 
no 
further 
trouble 
so 
long 
as 
PaulV. 
was 
inthechairofSt. 
Peter. 



On 
the 
death 
of 
Paul 
V. 
in 
1623, 
Maffeo 
Barberini 
was 
elected 
Pope, 
as 
Urban 
VIII. 
This 
new 
Pope, 
while 
a 
cardinal, 
had 
been 
an 
intimate 
friend 
of 
Galileo’s, 
and 
had 
indeed 
written 
Latin 
verses 
in 
praise 
of 
the 
great 
astronomer 
and 
his 
discoveries. 
It 
was 
therefore 
not 
unnatural 
for 
Galileo 
to 
think 
that 
the 
time 
had 
arrived 
when, 
with 
the 
use 
of 
due 
circumspection, 
he 
might 
continue 
his 
studies 
and 
his 
writings, 
without 
fear 
of 
incurring 
the 
displeasure 
of 
the 
Church. 
Indeed, 
in 
1624, 
one 
of 
Galileo’s 
friends 
writing 
fromRome,urgesGalileotovisitthe 
cityagain,andadded 
that 
— 


“Under 
the 
auspices 
of 
this 
most 
excellent, 
learned, 
and 
benignant 
Pontiff, 
sciencemust 
flourish. 
Yourarrivalwill 
be 
welcome 
to 
his 
Holiness. 
He 
asked 
me 
if 
you 
were 
coming, 
and 
when, 
and 
in 
short, 
he 
seems 
to 
love 
and 
esteem 
you 
morethanever.” 


The 
visit 
was 
duly 
paid, 
and 
when 
Galileo 
returned 
to 
Florence, 
the 
Pope 
wrote 
a 
letter 
from 
which 
the 
following 
is 
an 
extract, 
commanding 
the 
philosopher 
to 
the 
good 
offices 
of 
the 
young 
Ferdinand, 
who 
had 
shortly 
beforesucceededhisfather 
intheGrand 
DuchyofTuscany. 


“We 
find 
in 
Galileo 
not 
only 
literary 
distinction, 
but 
also 
the 
love 
of 
piety, 
and 
he 
is 
also 
strong 
in 
those 
qualities 
by 
which 
the 
pontifical 
good-will 
is 
easily 
obtained. 
And 
now, 
when 
he 
has 
been 
brought 
to 
this 
city 
to 
congratulate 
us 
on 
our 
elevation, 
we 
have 
very 
lovingly 
embraced 
him; 
nor 
can 
we 
suffer 
him 
to 
return 
to 
the 
country 
whither 
your 
liberality 
calls 
him, 
without 
an 
ample 
provision 
of 
pontifical 
love. 
And 
that 
you 
may 
know 
how 
dear 
he 
is 
to 
us, 
we 
have 
willed 
to 
give 
him 
this 
honourable 
testimonial 
of 
virtue 
and 
piety. 
And 
we 
further 
signify 
that 
every 
benefit 
which 
you 
shall 
confer 
upon 
him, 
imitating 
or 
even 
surpassing 
your 
father’s 
liberality, 
will 
conduce 
toourgratification.” 


The 
favourable 
reception 
which 
had 
been 
accorded 
to 
him 
by 
Pope 
Urban 


VIII. 
seems 
to 
have 
led 
Galileo 
to 
expect 
that 
there 
might 
be 
some 
corresponding 
change 
in 
the 
attitude 
of 
the 
Papal 
authorities 
on 
the 
great 
question 
of 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
earth. 
He 
accordingly 
proceeded 
with 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
chief 
work 
of 
his 
life, 
“The 
Dialogue 
of 
the 
two 
Systems.” 
It 
was 
submitted 
for 
inspection 
by 
the 
constituted 
authorities. 
The 
Pope 
himself 
thought 
that, 
if 
a 
few 
conditions 
which 
he 
laid 
down 
were 
duly 
complied 
with, 
there 
could 
be 
no 
objection 
to 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
work. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
the 
title 
of 
the 
book 
was 
to 
be 
so 
carefully 
worded 
as 
to 
show 
plainly 
that 
the 
Copernican 
doctrine 
was 
merely 
to 
be 
regarded 
as 
an 
hypothesis, 
and 
not 
as 
a 
scientific 
fact. 
Galileo 
was 
also 
instructed 
to 

conclude 
the 
book 
with 
special 
arguments 
which 
had 
been 
supplied 
by 
the 
Pope 
himself, 
and 
which 
appeared 
to 
his 
Holiness 
to 
be 
quite 
conclusive 
againstthenewdoctrineofCopernicus. 


Formal 
leave 
for 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
Dialogue 
was 
then 
given 
to 
Galileo 
by 
the 
Inquisitor 
General, 
and 
it 
was 
accordingly 
sent 
to 
the 
press. 
It 
might 
be 
thought 
that 
the 
anxieties 
of 
the 
astronomer 
about 
his 
book 
would 
then 
have 
terminated. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
they 
had 
not 
yet 
seriously 
begun. 
Riccardi, 
the 
Master 
of 
the 
Sacred 
Palace, 
having 
suddenly 
had 
some 
further 
misgivings, 
sent 
to 
Galileo 
for 
the 
manuscript 
while 
the 
work 
was 
at 
the 
printer’s, 
in 
order 
that 
the 
doctrine 
it 
implied 
might 
be 
once 
again 
examined. 
Apparently, 
Riccardi 
had 
come 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
he 
had 
not 
given 
the 
matter 
sufficient 
attention, 
when 
the 
authority 
to 
go 
to 
press 
had 
been 
first 
and, 
perhaps, 
hastily 
given. 
Considerable 
delay 
in 
the 
issue 
of 
the 
book 
was 
the 
result 
of 
these 
further 
deliberations. 
At 
last, 
however, 
in 
June, 
1632, 
Galileo’s 
great 
work, 
“The 
Dialogue 
of 
the 
two 
Systems,” 
was 
produced 
for 
the 
instruction 
of 
the 
world, 
though 
the 
occasion 
was 
fraught 
with 
ruin 
to 
the 
immortalauthor. 



FACSIMILE 
SKETCH 
OFLUNARSURFACEBYGALILEO. 


The 
book, 
on 
its 
publication, 
was 
received 
and 
read 
with 
the 
greatest 
avidity. 
But 
presently 
the 
Master 
of 
The 
Sacred 
Palace 
found 
reason 
to 
regret 
that 
he 
had 
given 
his 
consent 
to 
its 
appearance. 
He 
accordingly 
issued 
a 
peremptory 
order 
to 
sequestrate 
every 
copy 
in 
Italy. 
This 
sudden 
change 
in 
the 
Papal 
attitude 
towards 
Galileo 
formed 
the 
subject 
of 
a 
strong 
remonstrance 
addressed 
to 
the 
Roman 
authorities 
by 
the 
Grand 
Duke 
of 
Tuscany. 
The 
Pope 
himself 
seemed 
to 
have 
become 
impressed 
all 
at 
once 
with 
the 
belief 
that 
the 
work 
contained 
matter 
of 
an 
heretical 
description. 
The 
general 
interpretation 
put 
upon 
the 
book 
seems 
to 
have 
shown 
the 
authorities 
that 
they 
had 
mistaken 
its 
true 
tendency, 
notwithstanding 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
had 
been 
examined 
again 
and 
again 
by 
theologians 
deputed 
for 
the 
duty. 
To 
the 
communication 
from 
the 
Grand 
Duke 
the 
Pope 
returned 
answer, 
that 
he 
had 
decided 
to 
submit 
the 
book 
to 
a 
congregation 
of 
“learned, 
grave, 
and 
saintly 



men,” 
who 
would 
weigh 
every 
word 
in 
it. 
The 
views 
of 
his 
Holiness 
personally 
on 
the 
subject 
were 
expressed 
in 
his 
belief 
that 
the 
Dialogue 
containedthemostperverse 
matterthatcouldcomeintoareader’shands. 


The 
Master 
of 
the 
Sacred 
Palace 
was 
greatly 
blamed 
by 
the 
authorities 
for 
having 
given 
his 
sanction 
to 
its 
issue. 
He 
pleaded 
that 
the 
book 
had 
not 
been 
printed 
in 
the 
precise 
terms 
of 
the 
original 
manuscript 
which 
had 
been 
submitted 
to 
him. 
It 
was 
also 
alleged 
that 
Galileo 
had 
not 
adhered 
to 
his 
promise 
of 
inserting 
properly 
the 
arguments 
which 
the 
Pope 
himself 
had 
given 
in 
support 
of 
the 
old 
and 
orthodox 
view. 
One 
of 
these 
had, 
no 
doubt, 
been 
introduced, 
but, 
so 
far 
from 
mending 
Galileo’scase, 
it 
had 
madematters 
really 
look 
worse 
for 
the 
poor 
philosopher. 
The 
Pope’s 
argument 
had 
been 
put 
into 
the 
mouth 
of 
one 
of 
the 
characters 
in 
the 
Dialogue 
named 
“Simplicio.” 
Galileo’s 
enemies 
maintained 
that 
by 
adopting 
such 
a 
method 
for 
the 
expression 
of 
his 
Holiness’s 
opinion, 
Galileo 
had 
intended 
to 
hold 
the 
Pope 
himself 
up 
to 
ridicule. 
Galileo’s 
friends 
maintained 
that 
nothing 
could 
have 
been 
farther 
from 
his 
intention. 
It 
seems, 
however, 
highly 
probable 
that 
the 
suspicions 
thus 
aroused 
had 
something 
to 
say 
to 
the 
sudden 
change 
of 
frontonthepartofthePapalauthorities. 


On 
1st 
October, 
1632, 
Galileo 
received 
an 
order 
to 
appear 
before 
the 
Inquisition 
at 
Rome 
on 
the 
grave 
charge 
of 
heresy. 
Galileo, 
of 
course, 
expressed 
his 
submission, 
but 
pleaded 
for 
a 
respite 
from 
compliance 
with 
the 
summons, 
on 
the 
ground 
of 
his 
advanced 
age 
and 
his 
failing 
health. 
The 
Pope 
was, 
however, 
inexorable; 
he 
said 
that 
he 
had 
warned 
Galileo 
of 
his 
danger 
while 
he 
was 
still 
his 
friend. 
The 
command 
could 
not 
be 
disobeyed. 
Galileo 
might 
perform 
the 
journey 
as 
slowly 
as 
he 
pleased, 
but 
it 
was 
imperatively 
necessaryforhim 
tosetforthandatonce. 


On 
20th 
January, 
1633, 
Galileo 
started 
on 
his 
weary 
journey 
to 
Rome, 
in 
compliance 
with 
this 
peremptory 
summons. 
On 
13th 
February 
he 
was 
received 
as 
the 
guest 
of 
Niccolini, 
the 
Tuscan 
ambassador, 
who 
had 
acted 
as 
his 
wise 
and 
ever-kind 
friend 
throughout 
the 
whole 
affair. 
It 
seemed 
plain 
that 
the 
Holy 
Office 
were 
inclined 
to 
treat 
Galileo 
with 
as 
much 
clemency 
and 
consideration 
as 
was 
consistent 
with 
the 
determination 
that 
the 
case 
against 
him 
should 
be 
proceeded 
with 
to 
the 
end. 
The 
Pope 
intimated 
that 
in 
consequence 
of 
his 
respect 
for 
the 
Grand 
Duke 
of 
Tuscany 
he 
should 
permit 
Galileo 
to 
enjoy 
the 
privilege, 
quite 
unprecedented 
for 
a 
prisoner 
charged 
with 
heresy, 
of 
remaining 
as 
an 
inmate 
in 
the 
ambassador’s 
house. 
He 
ought, 
strictly, 
to 
have 
been 
placed 
in 
the 
dungeons 
of 
the 
Inquisition. 
When 
the 



examination 
of 
the 
accused 
had 
actually 
commenced, 
Galileo 
was 
confined, 
not,indeed,inthedungeons, 
but 
incomfortablerooms 
attheHolyOffice. 


By 
the 
judicious 
and 
conciliatory 
language 
of 
submission 
which 
Niccolini 
had 
urged 
Galileo 
to 
use 
before 
the 
Inquisitors, 
they 
were 
so 
far 
satisfied 
that 
they 
interceded 
with 
the 
Pope 
for 
his 
release. 
During 
the 
remainder 
of 
the 
trialGalileowasaccordinglypermittedtogo 
back 
totheambassador’s, 
where 
he 
was 
most 
heartily 
welcomed. 
Sister 
Maria 
Celeste, 
evidently 
thinking 
this 
meant 
thatthewhole 
casewasatanend,thus 
expresses 
herself: 
— 


“The 
joy 
that 
your 
last 
dear 
letter 
brought 
me, 
and 
the 
having 
to 
read 
it 
over 
and 
over 
to 
the 
nuns, 
who 
made 
quite 
a 
jubilee 
on 
hearing 
its 
contents, 
put 
me 
into 
such 
an 
excited 
state 
that 
at 
last 
I 
got 
a 
severe 
attack 
of 
headache.” 


In 
his 
defence 
Galileo 
urged 
that 
he 
had 
already 
been 
acquitted 
in 
1616 
by 
Cardinal 
Bellarmine, 
when 
a 
charge 
of 
heresy 
was 
brought 
against 
him, 
and 
he 
contended 
that 
anything 
he 
might 
now 
have 
done, 
was 
no 
more 
than 
he 
had 
done 
on 
the 
preceding 
occasion, 
when 
the 
orthodoxy 
of 
his 
doctrines 
received 
solemn 
confirmation. 
The 
Inquisition 
seemed 
certainly 
inclined 
to 
clemency, 
but 
the 
Pope 
was 
not 
satisfied. 
Galileo 
was 
accordingly 
summoned 
again 
on 
the 
21st 
June. 
He 
was 
to 
be 
threatened 
with 
torture 
if 
he 
did 
not 
forthwith 
give 
satisfactory 
explanations 
as 
to 
the 
reasons 
which 
led 
him 
to 
write 
the 
Dialogue. 
In 
this 
proceeding 
the 
Pope 
assured 
the 
Tuscan 
ambassador 
that 
he 
was 
treating 
Galileo 
with 
the 
utmost 
consideration 
possible 
in 
consequence 
of 
his 
esteem 
and 
regard 
for 
the 
Grand 
Duke, 
whose 
servant 
Galileo 
was. 
It 
was, 
however, 
necessary 
that 
some 
exemplary 
punishment 
be 
meted 
out 
to 
the 
astronomer, 
inasmuch 
as 
by 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
Dialogue 
he 
had 
distinctly 
disobeyed 
the 
injunction 
of 
silence 
laid 
upon 
him 
by 
the 
decree 
of 
1616. 
Nor 
was 
it 
admissible 
for 
Galileo 
to 
plead 
that 
his 
book 
had 
been 
sanctioned 
by 
the 
Master 
of 
the 
Sacred 
College, 
to 
whose 
inspection 
it 
had 
been 
again 
and 
again 
submitted. 
It 
was 
held, 
that 
if 
the 
Master 
of 
the 
Sacred 
College 
had 
been 
unaware 
of 
the 
solemn 
warning 
the 
philosopher 
had 
already 
received 
sixteen 
years 
previously, 
it 
was 
the 
duty 
ofGalileoto 
havedrawnhisattentiontothatfact. 


On 
the 
22nd 
June, 
1633, 
Galileo 
was 
led 
to 
the 
great 
hall 
of 
the 
Inquisition, 
and 
compelled 
to 
kneel 
before 
the 
cardinals 
there 
assembled 
and 
hear 
his 
sentence. 
In 
a 
long 
document, 
most 
elaborately 
drawn 
up, 
it 
is 
definitely 
charged 
against 
Galileo 
that, 
in 
publishing 
the 
Dialogue, 
he 
committed 
the 
essentially 
grave 
error 
of 
treating 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
earth’s 



motion 
as 
open 
to 
discussion. 
Galileo 
knew, 
so 
the 
document 
affirmed, 
that 
the 
Church 
had 
emphatically 
pronounced 
this 
notion 
to 
be 
contrary 
to 
Holy 
Writ, 
and 
that 
for 
him 
to 
consider 
a 
doctrine 
so 
stigmatized 
as 
having 
any 
shadow 
of 
probability 
in 
its 
favour 
was 
an 
act 
of 
disrespect 
to 
the 
authority 
of 
the 
Church 
which 
could 
not 
be 
overlooked. 
It 
was 
also 
charged 
against 
Galileo 
that 
in 
his 
Dialogue 
he 
has 
put 
the 
strongest 
arguments 
into 
the 
mouth, 
not 
of 
those 
who 
supported 
the 
orthodox 
doctrine, 
but 
of 
those 
who 
held 
the 
theory 
as 
to 
the 
earth’s 
motion 
which 
the 
Church 
had 
so 
deliberately 
condemned. 


After 
due 
consideration 
of 
the 
defence 
made 
by 
the 
prisoner, 
it 
was 
thereupon 
decreed 
that 
he 
had 
rendered 
himself 
vehemently 
suspected 
of 
heresy 
by 
the 
Holy 
Office, 
and 
in 
consequence 
had 
incurred 
all 
the 
censures 
and 
penalties 
of 
the 
sacred 
canons, 
and 
other 
decrees 
promulgated 
against 
such 
persons. 
The 
graver 
portion 
of 
these 
punishments 
would 
be 
remitted, 
if 
Galileo 
would 
solemnly 
repudiate 
the 
heresies 
referred 
to 
by 
an 
abjuration 
to 
bepronounced 
byhiminthe 
termslaiddown. 


At 
the 
same 
time 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
mark, 
in 
some 
emphatic 
manner, 
the 
serious 
offence 
which 
had 
been 
committed, 
so 
that 
it 
might 
serve 
both 
as 
a 
punishment 
to 
Galileo 
and 
as 
a 
warning 
to 
others. 
It 
was 
accordingly 
decreed 
that 
he 
should 
be 
condemned 
to 
imprisonment 
in 
the 
Holy 
Office 
during 
the 
pleasure 
of 
the 
Papal 
authorities, 
and 
that 
he 
should 
recite 
once 
a 
week 
for 
threeyearstheseven 
PenitentialPsalms. 


Then 
followed 
that 
ever-memorable 
scene 
in 
the 
great 
hall 
of 
the 
Inquisition, 
in 
which 
the 
aged 
and 
infirm 
Galileo, 
the 
inventor 
of 
the 
telescope 
and 
the 
famous 
astronomer, 
knelt 
down 
to 
abjure 
before 
the 
most 
eminent 
and 
reverend 
Lords 
Cardinal, 
Inquisitors 
General 
throughout 
the 
Christian 
Republic 
against 
heretical 
depravity. 
With 
his 
hands 
on 
the 
Gospels, 
Galileo 
was 
made 
to 
curse 
and 
detest 
the 
false 
opinion 
that 
the 
sun 
was 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
universe 
and 
immovable, 
and 
that 
the 
earth 
was 
not 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
same, 
and 
that 
it 
moved. 
He 
swore 
that 
for 
the 
future 
he 
will 
never 
say 
nor 
write 
such 
things 
as 
may 
bring 
him 
under 
suspicion, 
and 
that 
if 
he 
does 
so 
he 
submits 
to 
all 
the 
pains 
and 
penalties 
of 
the 
sacred 
canons. 
This 
abjuration 
was 
subsequently 
read 
in 
Florence 
before 
Galileo’s 
disciples, 
who 
had 
beenspeciallysummonedtoattend. 


It 
has 
been 
noted 
that 
neither 
on 
the 
first 
occasion, 
in 
1616, 
nor 
on 
the 
second 
in 
1633, 
did 
the 
reigning 
Pope 
sign 
the 
decrees 
concerning 
Galileo. 
The 
contention 
has 
accordingly 
been 
made 
that 
Paul 
V. 
and 
Urban 
VIII. 
are 



both 
alike 
vindicated 
from 
any 
technical 
responsibility 
for 
the 
attitude 
of 
the 
Romish 
Church 
towards 
the 
Copernican 
doctrines. 
The 
significance 
of 
this 
circumstance 
has 
been 
commented 
on 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
infallibilityof 
thePope. 


We 
can 
judge 
of 
the 
anxiety 
felt 
by 
Sister 
Maria 
Celeste 
about 
her 
beloved 
father 
during 
these 
terrible 
trials. 
The 
wife 
of 
the 
ambassador 
Niccolini, 
Galileo’s 
steadfast 
friend, 
most 
kindly 
wrote 
to 
give 
the 
nun 
whatever 
quieting 
assurances 
the 
case 
would 
permit. 
There 
is 
a 
renewed 
flow 
of 
these 
touching 
epistles 
from 
the 
daughtertoherfather. 
Thusshesendsword 
— 


“The 
news 
of 
your 
fresh 
trouble 
has 
pierced 
my 
soul 
with 
grief 
all 
the 
morethat 
itcamequiteunexpectedly.” 


And 
again, 
on 
hearing 
that 
he 
had 
been 
permitted 
to 
leave 
Rome, 
she 
writes 
— 


“I 
wish 
I 
could 
describe 
the 
rejoicing 
of 
all 
the 
mothers 
and 
sisters 
on 
hearing 
of 
your 
happy 
arrival 
at 
Siena. 
It 
was 
indeed 
most 
extraordinary. 
On 
hearing 
the 
news 
the 
Mother 
Abbess 
and 
many 
of 
the 
nuns 
ran 
to 
me, 
embracing 
meandweepingforjoy 
andtenderness.” 


The 
sentence 
of 
imprisonment 
was 
at 
first 
interpreted 
leniently 
by 
the 
Pope. 
Galileo 
was 
allowed 
to 
reside 
in 
qualified 
durance 
in 
the 
archbishop’s 
house 
at 
Siena. 
Evidently 
the 
greatest 
pain 
that 
he 
endured 
arose 
from 
the 
forced 
separation 
from 
that 
daughter, 
whom 
he 
had 
at 
last 
learned 
to 
love 
with 
an 
affection 
almost 
comparable 
with 
that 
she 
bore 
to 
him. 
She 
had 
often 
told 
him 
that 
she 
never 
had 
any 
pleasure 
equal 
to 
that 
with 
which 
she 
rendered 
any 
service 
to 
her 
father. 
To 
her 
joy, 
she 
discovers 
that 
she 
can 
relieve 
him 
from 
the 
task 
of 
reciting 
the 
seven 
Penitential 
Psalms 
which 
had 
beenimposedasaPenance: 
— 


“I 
began 
to 
do 
this 
a 
while 
ago,” 
she 
writes, 
“and 
it 
gives 
me 
much 
pleasure. 
First, 
because 
I 
am 
persuaded 
that 
prayer 
in 
obedience 
to 
Holy 
Church 
must 
be 
efficacious; 
secondly, 
in 
order 
to 
save 
you 
the 
trouble 
of 
remembering 
it. 
If 
I 
had 
been 
able 
to 
do 
more, 
most 
willingly 
would 
I 
have 
entered 
a 
straiter 
prison 
than 
the 
one 
I 
live 
in 
now, 
if 
by 
so 
doing 
I 
could 
have 
setyouatliberty.” 



CRESTOFGALILEO’SFAMILY. 


Sister 
Maria 
Celeste 
was 
gradually 
failing 
in 
health, 
but 
the 
great 
privilege 
was 
accorded 
toher 
of 
being 
able 
onceagain 
toembraceher 
beloved 
lord 
and 
master. 
Galileo 
had, 
in 
fact, 
been 
permitted 
to 
return 
to 
his 
old 
home; 
but 
on 
the 
very 
day 
when 
he 
heard 
of 
his 
daughter’s 
death 
came 
the 
final 
decree 
directinghimtoremaininhisownhousein 
perpetualsolitude. 


Amid 
the 
advancing 
infirmities 
of 
age, 
the 
isolation 
from 
friends, 
and 
the 
loss 
of 
his 
daughter, 
Galileo 
once 
again 
sought 
consolation 
in 
hard 
work. 
He 
commenced 
his 
famous 
dialogue 
on 
Motion. 
Gradually, 
however, 
his 
sight 
began 
to 
fail, 
and 
blindness 
was 
at 
last 
added 
to 
his 
other 
troubles. 
On 
January2nd,1638,he 
writesto 
Diodati: 
— 


“Alas, 
your 
dear 
friend 
and 
servant, 
Galileo, 
has 
been 
for

perfectly

so 
that

this 
earth, 
this

I 
by

the 
end 
was 
approaching 
—

BRIEF 
BIOGRAPHY: 
GALILEO 
GALILIEI 



From 
1911 
Encyclopædia 
Britannica, 
Volume 
11 


GALILEO 
GALILIEI 
(1564–1642), 
Italian 
astronomer 
and 
experimental 
philosopher, 
was 
born 
at 
Pisa 
on 
the 
15th 
of 
February 
1564. 
His 
father, 
Vincenzio, 
was 
an 
impoverished 
descendant 
of 
a 
noble 
Florentine 
house, 
which 
had 
exchanged 
the 
surname 
of 
Bonajuti 
for 
that 
of 
Galilei, 
on 
the 
election, 
in 
1343, 
of 
one 
of 
its 
members, 
Tommaso 
de’ 
Bonajuti, 
to 
the 
college 
of 
the 
twelve 
Buonuomini. 
The 
family, 
which 
was 
nineteen 
times 
represented 
in 
the 
signoria, 
and 
in 
1445 
gave 
a 
gonfalonier 
to 
Florence, 
flourished 
with 
the 
republic 
and 
declined 
with 
its 
fall. 
Vincenzio 
Galilei 
was 
a 
man 
of 
better 
parts 
than 
fortune. 
He 
was 
a 
competent 
mathematician, 
wrote 
with 
considerable 
ability 
on 
the 
theory 
and 
practice 
of 
music, 
and 
was 
especially 
distinguished 
amongst 
his 
contemporaries 
for 
the 
grace 
and 
skill 
of 
his 
performance 
upon 
the 
lute. 
By 
his 
wife, 
Giulia 
Ammannati 
of 
Pescia, 
he 
had 
three 
sonsandfourdaughters. 


From 
his 
earliest 
childhood 
Galileo, 
the 
eldest 
of 
the 
family, 
was 
remarkable 
for 
intellectual 
aptitude 
as 
well 
as 
for 
mechanical 
invention. 
His 
favourite 
pastime 
was 
the 
construction 
of 
original 
and 
ingenious 
toy-
machines; 
but 
his 
application 
to 
literary 
studies 
was 
equally 
conspicuous. 
In 
the 
monastery 
of 
Vallombrosa, 
near 
Florence, 
where 
his 
education 
was 
principally 
conducted, 
he 
not 
only 
made 
himself 
acquainted 
with 
the 
best 
Latin 
authors, 
but 
acquired 
a 
fair 
command 
of 
the 
Greek 
tongue, 
thus 
laying 
the 
foundation 
of 
his 
brilliant 
and 
elegant 
style. 
From 
one 
of 
the 
monks 
he 
also 
received 
instruction 
in 
logic; 
but 
the 
subtleties 
of 
the 
scholastic 
science 
were 
thoroughly 
distasteful 
to 
him. 
A 
document 
published 
by 
F. 
Selmi 
in 
1864 
proves 
that 
he 
was 
at 
this 
time 
so 
far 
attracted 
towards 
a 
religious 
life 
as 
to 
have 
joined 
the 
novitiate; 
but 
his 
father, 
who 
had 
other 
designs 
for 
him, 
seized 
the 
opportunity 
of 
an 
attack 
of 
ophthalmia 
to 
withdraw 
him 
permanently 
from 
the 
care 
of 
the 
monks. 
Having 
had 
personal 
experience 
of 
the 
unremunerative 
character 
both 
of 
music 
and 
of 
mathematics, 
he 
desired 
that 
his 
son 
should 
apply 
himself 
to 
the 
cultivation 
of 
medicine, 
and, 
not 
without 
some 
straining 
of 
his 
slender 
resources, 
placed 
him, 
before 
he 
had 
completed 
his 
eighteenth 
year, 
at 
the 
university 
of 
Pisa. 
He 
accordingly 



matriculated 
there 
on 
the 
5th 
of 
November 
1581, 
and 
immediately 
entered 
upon 
attendance 
at 
the 
lectures 
of 
the 
celebrated 
physician 
and 
botanist, 
AndreaCesalpino. 


The 
natural 
gifts 
of 
the 
young 
student 
seemed 
at 
this 
time 
equally 
ready 
to 
develop 
in 
any 
direction 
towards 
which 
choice 
or 
hazard 
might 
incline 
them. 
In 
musical 
skill 
and 
invention 
he 
already 
vied 
with 
the 
best 
professors 
of 
the 
art 
in 
Italy; 
his 
personal 
taste 
would 
have 
led 
him 
to 
choose 
painting 
as 
his 
profession, 
and 
one 
of 
the 
most 
eminent 
artists 
of 
his 
day, 
Lodovico 
Cigoli, 
owned 
that 
to 
his 
judgment 
and 
counsel 
he 
was 
mainly 
indebted 
for 
the 
success 
of 
his 
works. 
In 
1581, 
while 
watching 
a 
lamp 
set 
swinging 
in 
the 
cathedral 
ofPisa, 
heobservedthat, 
whateverthe 
range 
of 
its 
oscillations, 
they 
were 
invariably 
executed 
in 
equal 
times. 
The 
experimental 
verification 
of 
this 
fact 
led 
him 
to 
the 
important 
discovery 
of 
the 
isochronism 
of 
the 
pendulum. 
He 
at 
first 
applied 
the 
new 
principle 
to 
pulse-measurement, 
and 
more 
than 
fifty 
years 
later 
turned 
it 
to 
account 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
an 
astronomical 
clock. 
Up 
to 
this 
time 
he 
was 
entirely 
ignorant 
of 
mathematics, 
his 
father 
having 
carefully 
held 
him 
aloof 
from 
a 
study 
which 
he 
rightly 
apprehended 
would 
lead 
to 
his 
total 
alienation 
from 
that 
of 
medicine. 
Accident, 
however, 
frustrated 
this 
purpose. 
A 
lesson 
in 
geometry, 
given 
by 
Ostilio 
Ricci 
to 
the 
pages 
of 
the 
grand-ducal 
court, 
chanced, 
tradition 
avers, 
to 
have 
Galileo 
for 
an 
unseen 
listener; 
his 
attention 
was 
riveted, 
his 
dormant 
genius 
was 
roused, 
and 
he 
threw 
all 
his 
energies 
into 
the 
new 
pursuit 
thus 
unexpectedly 
presented 
to 
him. 
With 
Ricci’s 
assistance, 
he 
rapidly 
mastered 
the 
elements 
of 
the 
science, 
and 
eventually 
extorted 
his 
father’s 
reluctant 
permission 
to 
exchange 
Hippocrates 
and 
Galen 
for 
Euclid 
and 
Archimedes. 
In 
1585 
he 
was 
withdrawn 
from 
the 
university, 
through 
lack 
of 
means, 
before 
he 
had 
taken 
a 
degree, 
and 
returned 
to 
Florence, 
where 
his 
family 
habitually 
resided. 
We 
next 
hear 
of 
him 
as 
lecturing 
before 
the 
Florentine 
Academy 
on 
the 
site 
and 
dimensions 
of 
Dante’s 
Inferno; 
and 
he 
shortly 
afterwards 
published 
an 
essay 
descriptive 
of 
his 
invention 
of 
the 
hydrostatic 
balance, 
which 
rapidly 
made 
his 
name 
known 
throughout 
Italy. 
His 
first 
patron 
was 
the 
Marchese 
Guidubaldo 
del 
Monte 
of 
Pesaro, 
a 
man 
equally 
eminent 
in 
science, 
and 
influential 
through 
family 
connexions. 
At 
the 
Marchese’s 
request 
he 
wrote, 
in 
1588, 
a 
treatise 
on 
the 
centre 
of 
gravity 
in 
solids, 
which 
obtained 
for 
him, 
together 
with 
thetitleof 
“the 
Archimedes 
ofhis 
time,” 
the 
honourable 
though 
not 
lucrative 
post 
of 
mathematical 
lecturer 
at 
the 
Pisan 
university. 
During 
the 
ensuing 
two 
years 
(1589–1591) 
he 
carried 
on 
that 
remarkable 
series 
of 



experiments 
by 
which 
he 
established 
the 
first 
principles 
of 
dynamics 
and 
earned 
the 
undying 
hostility 
of 
bigoted 
Aristotelians. 
From 
the 
leaning 
tower 
of 
Pisa 
he 
afforded 
to 
all 
the 
professors 
and 
students 
of 
the 
university 
ocular 
demonstration 
of 
the 
falsehood 
of 
the 
Peripatetic 
dictum 
that 
heavy 
bodies 
fall 
with 
velocities 
proportional 
to 
their 
weights, 
and 
with 
unanswerable 
logic 
demolished 
all 
the 
time-honoured 
maxims 
of 
the 
schools 
regarding 
the 
motion 
of 
projectiles, 
and 
elemental 
weight 
or 
levity. 
But 
while 
he 
convinced, 
he 
failed 
to 
conciliate 
his 
adversaries. 
The 
keen 
sarcasm 
of 
his 
polished 
rhetoric 
was 
not 
calculated 
to 
soothe 
the 
susceptibilities 
of 
men 
already 
smarting 
under 
the 
deprivation 
of 
their 
most 
cherished 
illusions. 
He 
seems, 
in 
addition, 
to 
have 
compromised 
his 
position 
with 
the 
grand-ducal 
family 
by 
the 
imprudent 
candour 
with 
which 
he 
condemned 
a 
machine 
for 
clearing 
the 
port 
of 
Leghorn, 
invented 
by 
Giovanni 
de’ 
Medici, 
an 
illegitimate 
son 
of 
Cosmo 
I. 
Princely 
favour 
being 
withdrawn, 
private 
rancour 
was 
free 
to 
show 
itself. 
He 
was 
publicly 
hissed 
at 
his 
lecture, 
and 
found 
it 
prudent 
to 
resign 
his 
professorship 
and 
withdraw 
to 
Florence 
in 
1591. 
Through 
the 
death 
of 
his 
father 
in 
July 
of 
that 
year 
family 
cares 
and 
responsibilities 
devolved 
upon 
him, 
and 
thus 
his 
nomination 
to 
the 
chair 
of 
mathematics 
at 
the 
university 
of 
Padua, 
secured 
by 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
Marchese 
Guidubaldo 
with 
the 
Venetian 
senate, 
was 
welcome 
both 
as 
affording 
a 
relief 
from 
pecuniary 
embarrassment 
and 
as 
opening 
a 
field 
for 
scientificdistinction. 


His 
residence 
at 
Padua, 
which 
extended 
over 
a 
period 
of 
eighteen 
years, 
from 
1592 
to 
1610, 
was 
a 
course 
of 
uninterrupted 
prosperity. 
His 
appointment 
was 
three 
times 
renewed, 
on 
each 
occasion 
with 
the 
expressions 
of 
the 
highest 
esteem 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
governing 
body, 
and 
his 
yearly 
salary 
was 
progressively 
raised 
from 
180 
to 
1000 
florins. 
His 
lectures 
were 
attended 
by 
persons 
of 
the 
highest 
distinction 
from 
all 
parts 
of 
Europe, 
and 
such 
was 
the 
charm 
of 
his 
demonstrations 
that 
a 
hall 
capable 
of 
containing 
2000 
people 
had 
eventually 
to 
be 
assigned 
for 
the 
accommodation 
of 
the 
overflowing 
audiences 
which 
they 
attracted. 
His 
invention 
of 
the 
proportional 
compass 
or 
sector 
— 
an 
implement 
still 
used 
in 
geometrical 
drawing 
— 
dates 
from 
1597; 
and 
about 
the 
same 
time 
he 
constructed 
the 
first 
thermometer, 
consisting 
of 
a 
bulb 
and 
tube 
filled 
with 
air 
and 
water, 
and 
terminating 
in 
a 
vessel 
of 
water. 
In 
this 
instrument 
the 
results 
of 
varying 
atmospheric 
pressure 
were 
not 
distinguishable 
from 
the 
expansive 
and 
contractive 
effects 
of 
heat 
and 
cold, 
and 
it 
became 
an 
efficient 
measure 
of 
temperature 
only 
when 
Rinieri, 
in 



1646, 
introduced 
the 
improvement 
of 
hermetically 
sealing 
the 
liquid 
in 
glass. 
The 
substitution, 
in 
1670, 
of 
mercury 
for 
water 
completed 
the 
modern 
thermometer. 


Galileo 
seems, 
at 
an 
early 
period 
of 
his 
life, 
to 
have 
adopted 
the 
Copernican 
theory 
of 
the 
solar 
system, 
and 
was 
deterred 
from 
avowing 
his 
opinions 
— 
as 
is 
proved 
by 
his 
letter 
to 
Kepler 
of 
August 
4, 
1597 
— 
by 
the 
fear 
of 
ridicule 
rather 
than 
of 
persecution. 
The 
appearance, 
in 
September 
1604, 
of 
a 
new 
star 
in 
the 
constellation 
Serpentarius 
afforded 
him 
indeed 
an 
opportunity, 
of 
which 
he 
eagerly 
availed 
himself, 
for 
making 
an 
onslaught 
upon 
the 
Aristotelian 
axiom 
of 
the 
incorruptibility 
of 
the 
heavens; 
but 
he 
continued 
to 
conform 
his 
public 
teachings 
in 
the 
main 
to 
Ptolemaic 
principles, 
until 
the 
discovery 
of 
a 
novel 
and 
potent 
implement 
of 
research 
in 
the 
shape 
of 
the 
telescope 
(q.v.) 
placed 
at 
his 
command 
startling 
and 
hitherto 
unsuspected 
evidence 
as 
to 
the 
constitution 
and 
mutual 
relations 
of 
the 
heavenly 
bodies. 
Galileo 
was 
not 
the 
original 
inventor 
of 
the 
telescope. 
That 
honour 
must 
be 
assigned 
to 
Johannes 
Lippershey, 
an 
obscure 
optician 
of 
Middleburg, 
who, 
on 
the 
2nd 
of 
October 
1608, 
petitioned 
the 
states-general 
of 
the 
Low 
Countries 
for 
exclusive 
rights 
in 
the 
manufacture 
of 
an 
instrument 
for 
increasing 
the 
apparent 
size 
of 
remote 
objects. 
A 
rumour 
of 
the 
new 
invention, 
which 
reached 
Venice 
in 
June 
1609, 
sufficed 
to 
set 
Galileo 
on 
the 
track; 
and 
after 
one 
night’s 
profound 
meditation 
on 
the 
principles 
of 
refraction, 
he 
succeeded 
in 
producing 
a 
telescope 
of 
threefold 
magnifying 
power. 
Upon 
this 
first 
attempt 
he 
rapidly 
improved, 
until 
he 
attained 
to 
a 
power 
of 
thirty-two, 
and 
his 
instruments, 
of 
which 
he 
manufactured 
hundreds 
with 
his 
own 
hands, 
were 
soon 
in 
request 
in 
every 
part 
of 
Europe. 
Two 
lenses 
only 
— 
a 
plano-convex 
and 
a 
plano-concave 
— 
were 
needed 
for 
the 
composition 
of 
each, 
and 
this 
simple 
principle 
is 
that 
still 
employed 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
opera-glasses. 
Galileo’s 
direction 
of 
his 
new 
instrument 
to 
the 
heavens 
formed 
an 
era 
in 
the 
history 
of 
astronomy. 
Discoveries 
followed 
upon 
it 
with 
astounding 
rapidity 
and 
in 
bewildering 
variety. 
The 
Sidereus 
Nuncius, 
published 
at 
Venice 
early 
in 
1610, 
contained 
the 
first-fruits 
of 
the 
new 
mode 
of 
investigation, 
which 
were 
sufficient 
to 
excite 
learned 
amazement 
on 
both 
sides 
of 
the 
Alps. 
The 
mountainous 
configuration 
of 
the 
moon’s 
surface 
was 
there 
first 
described, 
and 
the 
so-called 
“phosphorescence” 
of 
the 
dark 
portion 
of 
our 
satellite 
attributed 
to 
its 
true 
cause 
— 
namely, 
illumination 
by 
sunlight 
reflected 
from 
the 
earth. 
All 
the 
time-worn 
fables 
and 
conjectures 
regarding 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
Milky 



Way 
were 
at 
once 
dissipated 
by 
the 
simple 
statement 
that 
to 
the 
eye, 
reinforced 
by 
the 
telescope, 
it 
appeared 
as 
a 
congeries 
of 
lesser 
stars, 
while 
the 
great 
nebulae 
were 
equally 
declared 
to 
be 
resolvable 
into 
similar 
elements. 
But 
the 
discovery 
which 
was 
at 
once 
perceived 
to 
be 
most 
important 
in 
itself, 
and 
most 
revolutionary 
in 
its 
effects, 
was 
that 
of 
Jupiter’s 
satellites, 
first 
seen 
by 
Galileo 
on 
the 
7th 
of 
January 
1610, 
and 
by 
him 
named 
Sidera 
Medicea,in 
honourofthegrand-duke 
ofTuscany,CosmoII.,who 
had 
been 
his 
pupil, 
and 
was 
about 
to 
become 
hisemployer. 
An 
illustration 
is, 
with 
the 
general 
run 
of 
mankind, 
more 
powerful 
to 
convince 
than 
an 
argument; 
and 
the 
cogency 
of 
the 
visible 
plea 
for 
the 
Copernican 
theory 
offered 
by 
the 
miniature 
system, 
then 
first 
disclosed 
to 
view, 
was 
recognizable 
in 
the 
triumph 
of 
its 
advocates 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
increased 
acrimony 
of 
its 
opponents. 


In 
September 
1610 
Galileo 
finally 
abandoned 
Padua 
for 
Florence. 
His 
researches 
with 
the 
telescope 
had 
been 
rewarded 
by 
the 
Venetian 
senate 
with 
the 
appointment 
for 
life 
to 
his 
professorship, 
at 
an 
unprecedentedly 
high 
salary. 
His 
discovery 
of 
the 
“Medicean 
Stars” 
was 
acknowledged 
by 
his 
nomination 
(July 
12, 
1610) 
as 
philosopher 
and 
mathematician 
extraordinary 
to 
the 
grand-duke 
of 
Tuscany. 
The 
emoluments 
of 
this 
office, 
which 
involved 
no 
duties 
save 
that 
of 
continuing 
his 
scientific 
labours, 
were 
fixed 
at 
1000 
scudi; 
and 
it 
was 
the 
desire 
of 
increased 
leisure, 
rather 
than 
the 
promptings 
of 
local 
patriotism, 
which 
induced 
him 
to 
accept 
an 
offer 
the 
original 
suggestion 
of 
which 
had 
indeed 
come 
from 
himself. 
Before 
the 
close 
of 
1610 
the 
memorable 
cycle 
of 
discoveries 
begun 
in 
the 
previous 
year 
was 
completed 
by 
the 
observation 
of 
the 
ansated 
or, 
as 
it 
appeared 
to 
Galileo, 
triple 
form 
of 
Saturn 
(the 
ring-formation 
was 
first 
recognized 
by 
Christiaan 
Huygens 
in 
1655), 
of 
the 
phases 
of 
Venus, 
and 
of 
the 
spots 
upon 
the 
sun. 
As 
regards 
sunspots, 
however, 
Johann 
Fabricius 
of 
Osteel 
in 
Friesland 
can 
claim 
priority 
of 
publication, 
if 
not 
of 
actual 
detection. 
In 
the 
spring 
of 
1611 
Galileo 
visited 
Rome, 
and 
exhibited 
in 
the 
gardens 
of 
the 
Quirinal 
Palace 
the 
telescopic 
wonders 
of 
the 
heavens 
to 
the 
most 
eminent 
personages 
at 
the 
pontifical 
court. 
Encouraged 
by 
the 
flattering 
reception 
accorded 
to 
him, 
he 
ventured, 
in 
his 
Letters 
on 
the 
Solar 
Spots, 
printed 
at 
Rome 
in 
1613, 
to 
take 
up 
a 
more 
decided 
position 
towards 
that 
doctrine 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
which, 
as 
he 
avowed 
in 
a 
letter 
to 
Belisario 
Vinta, 
secretary 
to 
the 
grand-duke, 
“all 
his 
life 
and 
being 
henceforward 
depended.” 
Even 
in 
the 
time 
of 
Copernicus 
some 
well-meaning 
persons, 
especially 
those 
of 
the 
reformed 
persuasion, 
had 



suspected 
a 
discrepancy 
between 
the 
new 
view 
of 
the 
solar 
system 
and 
certain 
passages 
of 
Scripture 
— 
a 
suspicion 
strengthened 
by 
the 
anti-
Christian 
inferences 
drawn 
from 
it 
by 
Giordano 
Bruno; 
but 
the 
question 
was 
never 
formally 
debated 
until 
Galileo’s 
brilliant 
disclosures, 
enhanced 
by 
his 
formidable 
dialectic 
and 
enthusiastic 
zeal, 
irresistibly 
challenged 
for 
it 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
authorities. 
Although 
he 
had 
no 
desire 
to 
raise 
the 
theological 
issue, 
it 
must 
be 
admitted 
that, 
the 
discussion 
once 
set 
on 
foot, 
he 
threw 
himselfinto 
it 
with 
characteristicimpetuosity,and 
thus 
helped 
to 
precipitate 
a 
decision 
which 
it 
was 
his 
interest 
to 
avert. 
In 
December 
1613 
a 
Benedictine 
monk 
named 
Benedetto 
Castelli, 
at 
that 
time 
professor 
of 
mathematics 
at 
the 
universityof 
Pisa,wrote 
toinformGalileo 
of 
a 
recent 
discussion 
at 
thegrandducal 
table, 
in 
which 
he 
had 
been 
called 
upon 
to 
defend 
the 
Copernican 
doctrine 
against 
theological 
objections. 
This 
task 
Castelli, 
who 
was 
a 
steady 
friend 
and 
disciple 
of 
the 
Tuscan 
astronomer, 
seems 
to 
have 
discharged 
with 
moderation 
and 
success. 
Galileo’s 
answer, 
written, 
as 
he 
said 
himself, 
currente 
calamo, 
was 
an 
exposition 
of 
a 
formal 
theory 
as 
to 
the 
relations 
of 
physical 
science 
to 
Holy 
Writ, 
still 
further 
developed 
in 
an 
elaborate 
apology 
addressed 
by 
him 
in 
the 
following 
year 
(1614) 
to 
Christina 
of 
Lorraine, 
dowager 
grand-duchess 
of 
Tuscany. 
Not 
satisfied 
with 
explaining 
adverse 
texts, 
he 
met 
his 
opponents 
with 
unwise 
audacity 
on 
their 
own 
ground, 
and 
endeavoured 
to 
produce 
scriptural 
confirmation 
of 
a 
system 
which 
seemed 
to 
the 
ignorant 
many 
an 
incredible 
paradox, 
and 
to 
the 
scientific 
few 
a 
beautiful 
but 
daring 
innovation. 
The 
rising 
agitation 
on 
the 
subject, 
fomented 
for 
their 
own 
purposes 
by 
the 
rabid 
Aristotelians 
of 
the 
schools, 
was 
heightened 
rather 
than 
allayed 
by 
these 
manifestoes, 
and 
on 
the 
fourth 
Sunday 
of 
the 
following 
Advent 
found 
a 
voice 
in 
the 
pulpit 
of 
Santa 
Maria 
Novella. 
Padre 
Caccini’s 
denunciation 
of 
the 
new 
astronomy 
was 
indeed 
disavowed 
and 
strongly 
condemned 
by 
his 
superiors; 
nevertheless, 
on 
the 
5th 
of 
February 
1615, 
another 
Dominican 
monk 
named 
Lorini 
laid 
Galileo’s 
letter 
to 
Castelli 
before 
theInquisition. 


Cardinal 
Robert 
Bellarmin 
was 
at 
that 
time 
by 
far 
the 
most 
influential 
member 
of 
the 
Sacred 
College. 
He 
was 
a 
man 
of 
vast 
learning 
and 
upright 
piety, 
but, 
although 
personally 
friendly 
to 
Galileo, 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
he 
saw 
in 
his 
scientific 
teachings 
a 
danger 
to 
religion. 
The 
year 
1615 
seems 
to 
havebeenaperiod 
ofsuspense. 
Galileo 
received,as 
the 
resultof 
aconference 
between 
Cardinals 
Bellarmin 
and 
Del 
Monte, 
a 
semi-official 
warning 
to 
avoid 
theology, 
and 
limit 
himself 
to 
physical 
reasoning. 
“Write 
freely,” 
he 



was 
told 
by 
Monsignor 
Dini, 
“but 
keep 
outside 
the 
sacristy.” 
Unfortunately, 
he 
had 
already 
committed 
himself 
to 
dangerous 
ground. 
In 
December 
he 
repaired 
personally 
to 
Rome, 
full 
of 
confidence 
that 
the 
weight 
of 
his 
arguments 
and 
the 
vivacity 
of 
his 
eloquence 
could 
not 
fail 
to 
convert 
the 
entire 
pontifical 
court 
to 
his 
views. 
He 
was 
cordially 
received, 
and 
eagerly 
listened 
to, 
but 
his 
imprudent 
ardour 
served 
but 
to 
injure 
his 
cause. 
On 
the 
24th 
of 
February 
1616 
the 
consulting 
theologians 
of 
the 
Holy 
Office 
characterized 
the 
two 
propositions 
— 
that 
the 
sun 
is 
immovable 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
world, 
and 
that 
the 
earth 
has 
a 
diurnal 
motion 
of 
rotation 
— 
the 
first 
as 
“absurd 
in 
philosophy, 
and 
formally 
heretical, 
because 
expressly 
contrary 
to 
Holy 
Scripture,” 
and 
the 
second 
as 
“open 
to 
the 
same 
censure 
in 
philosophy, 
and 
at 
least 
erroneous 
as 
to 
faith.” 
Two 
days 
later 
Galileo 
was, 
by 
command 
of 
the 
pope 
(Paul 
V.), 
summoned 
to 
the 
palace 
of 
Cardinal 
Bellarmin, 
and 
there 
officially 
admonished 
not 
thenceforward 
to 
“hold, 
teach 
or 
defend” 
the 
condemned 
doctrine. 
This 
injunction 
he 
promised 
to 
obey. 
On 
the 
5th 
of 
March 
the 
Congregation 
of 
the 
Index 
issued 
a 
decree 
reiterating, 
with 
the 
omission 
of 
the 
word 
“heretical,” 
the 
censure 
of 
the 
theologians, 
suspending, 
usque 
corrigatur, 
the 
great 
work 
of 
Copernicus, 
De 
revolutionibus 
orbium 
coelestium, 
and 
absolutely 
prohibiting 
a 
treatise 
by 
a 
Carmelite 
monk 
named 
Foscarini, 
which 
treated 
the 
same 
subjectfrom 
a 
theological 
point 
ofview. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
it 
was 
given 
to 
be 
understood 
that 
the 
new 
theory 
of 
the 
solar 
system 
might 
be 
held 
ex 
hypothesi, 
and 
the 
trivial 
verbal 
alterations 
introduced 
into 
the 
Polish 
astronomer’s 
book 
in 
1620, 
when 
the 
work 
of 
revision 
was 
completed 
by 
Cardinal 
Gaetani, 
confirmed 
this 
interpretation. 
This 
edict, 
it 
is 
essential 
to 
observe, 
the 
responsibility 
for 
which 
rests 
with 
a 
disciplinary 
congregation 
in 
no 
sense 
representing 
the 
church, 
was 
never 
confirmed 
by 
the 
pope, 
and 
was 
virtually 
repealed 
in 
1757 
under 
Benedict 
XIV. 


Galileo 
returned 
to 
Florence 
three 
months 
later, 
not 
ill-pleased, 
as 
his 
letters 
testify, 
with 
the 
result 
of 
his 
visit 
to 
Rome. 
He 
brought 
with 
him, 
for 
the 
refutation 
of 
calumnious 
reports 
circulated 
by 
his 
enemies, 
a 
written 
certificate 
from 
Cardinal 
Bellarmin, 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
no 
abjuration 
had 
been 
required 
of 
or 
penance 
imposed 
upon 
him. 
During 
a 
prolonged 
audience 
he 
had 
received 
from 
the 
pope 
assurances 
of 
private 
esteem 
and 
personal 
protection; 
and 
he 
trusted 
to 
his 
dialectical 
ingenuity 
to 
find 
the 
means 
of 
presenting 
his 
scientific 
convictions 
under 
the 
transparent 
veil 
of 
an 
hypothesis. 
Although 
a 
sincere 
Catholic, 
he 
seems 
to 
have 
laid 
but 
little 
stress 



on 
the 
secret 
admonition 
of 
the 
Holy 
Office, 
which 
his 
sanguine 
temperament 
encouraged 
him 
gradually 
to 
dismiss 
from 
his 
mind. 
He 
preserved 
no 
written 
memorandum 
of 
its 
terms, 
and 
it 
was 
represented 
to 
him, 
according 
to 
his 
own 
deposition 
in 
1633, 
solely 
by 
Cardinal 
Bellarmin’s 
certificate, 
in 
which, 
for 
obvious 
reasons, 
it 
was 
glossed 
over 
rather 
than 
expressly 
recorded. 
For 
seven 
years, 
nevertheless, 
during 
which 
he 
led 
a 
life 
of 
studious 
retirement 
in 
the 
Villa 
Segni 
at 
Bellosguardo, 
near 
Florence, 
he 
maintained 
an 
almost 
unbroken 
silence. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
that 
time 
he 
appeared 
in 
public 
with 
his 
Saggiatore, 
a 
polemical 
treatise 
written 
in 
reply 
to 
the 
Libra 
astronomica 
of 
Padre 
Grassi 
(under 
the 
pseudonym 
of 
Lotario 
Sarsi), 
the 
Jesuit 
astronomer 
of 
the 
Collegio 
Romano. 
The 
subject 
in 
debate 
was 
the 
nature 
of 
comets, 
the 
conspicuous 
appearance 
of 
three 
of 
which 
bodies 
in 
the 
year 
1618 
furnished 
theoccasionof 
the 
controversy. 
Galileo’sviews,although 
erroneous,sincehe 
held 
comets 
to 
be 
mere 
atmospheric 
emanations 
reflecting 
sunlight 
after 
the 
evanescent 
fashion 
of 
a 
halo 
or 
a 
rainbow, 
were 
expressed 
with 
such 
triumphant 
vigour, 
and 
embellished 
with 
such 
telling 
sarcasms, 
that 
his 
opponent 
did 
not 
venture 
upon 
a 
reply. 
The 
Saggiatore 
was 
printed 
at 
Rome 
in 
October 
1623 
by 
the 
Academy 
of 
the 
Lincei, 
of 
which 
Galileo 
was 
a 
member,with 
a 
dedication 
to 
the 
new 
pope, 
UrbanVIII., 
and 
notwithstanding 
some 
passages 
containing 
a 
covert 
defence 
of 
Copernican 
opinions, 
was 
received 
with 
acclamation 
by 
ecclesiastical, 
no 
less 
than 
by 
scientific 
authorities. 


Everything 
seemed 
now 
to 
promise 
a 
close 
of 
unbroken 
prosperity 
to 
Galileo’s 
career. 
Maffeo 
Barberini, 
his 
warmest 
friend 
and 
admirer 
in 
the 
Sacred 
College, 
was, 
by 
the 
election 
of 
the 
8th 
of 
August 
1623, 
seated 
on 
the 
pontifical 
throne; 
and 
the 
marked 
distinction 
with 
which 
he 
was 
received 
on 
his 
visit 
of 
congratulation 
to 
Rome 
in 
1624 
encouraged 
him 
to 
hope 
for 
the 
realization 
of 
his 
utmost 
wishes. 
He 
received 
every 
mark 
of 
private 
favour. 
The 
pope 
admitted 
him 
to 
six 
long 
audiences 
in 
the 
course 
of 
two 
months, 
wrote 
an 
enthusiastic 
letter 
to 
the 
grand-duke 
praising 
the 
great 
astronomer, 
not 
only 
for 
his 
distinguished 
learning, 
but 
also 
for 
his 
exemplary 
piety, 
and 
granted 
a 
pension 
to 
his 
son 
Vincenzio, 
which 
was 
afterwards 
transferred 
to 
himself, 
and 
paid, 
with 
some 
irregularities, 
to 
the 
end 
of 
his 
life. 
But 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
decree 
of 
1616, 
the 
revocation 
of 
which 
Galileo 
had 
hoped 
to 
obtain 
through 
his 
personal 
influence, 
he 
found 
him 
inexorable. 
Yet 
there 
seemed 
reason 
to 
expect 
that 
it 
would 
at 
least 
be 
interpreted 
in 
a 
liberal 
spirit, 
and 
Galileo’s 
friends 
encouraged 
his 
imprudent 
confidence 
by 
eagerly 



retailing 
to 
him 
every 
papal 
utterance 
which 
it 
was 
possible 
to 
construe 
in 
a 
favourable 
sense. 
To 
Cardinal 
Hohenzollern, 
Urban 
was 
reported 
to 
have 
said 
that 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
earth’s 
motion 
had 
not 
been 
and 
could 
not 
be 
condemned 
as 
heretical, 
but 
only 
as 
rash; 
and 
in 
1630 
the 
brilliant 
Dominican 
monk 
Tommaso 
Campanella 
wrote 
to 
Galileo 
that 
the 
pope 
had 
expressed 
to 
him 
in 
conversation 
his 
disapproval 
of 
the 
prohibitory 
decree. 
Thus, 
in 
the 
full 
anticipation 
of 
added 
renown, 
and 
without 
any 
misgiving 
as 
to 
ulterior 
consequences, 
Galileo 
set 
himself, 
on 
his 
return 
to 
Florence, 
to 
complete 
his 
famous 
but 
ill-starred 
work, 
the 
Dialogo 
dei 
due 
massimi 
sistemi 
del 
mondo. 
Finished 
in 
1630, 
it 
was 
not 
until 
January 
1632 
that 
it 
emerged 
from 
the 
presses 
of 
Landini 
at 
Florence. 
The 
book 
was 
originally 
intended 
to 
appear 
in 
Rome, 
but 
unexpected 
obstacles 
interposed. 
The 
Lincean 
Academy 
collapsed 
with 
the 
death 
of 
Prince 
Federigo 
Cesi, 
its 
founder 
and 
president; 
an 
outbreak 
of 
plague 
impeded 
communication 
between 
the 
various 
Italian 
cities; 
and 
the 
imprimatur 
was 
finally 
extorted, 
rather 
than 
accorded, 
under 
the 
pressure 
of 
private 
friendship 
and 
powerful 
interest. 
A 
tumult 
of 
applause 
from 
every 
part 
of 
Europe 
followed 
its 
publication; 
and 
it 
would 
be 
difficult 
to 
find 
in 
any 
language 
a 
book 
in 
which 
animation 
and 
elegance 
of 
style 
are 
so 
happily 
combined 
with 
strength 
and 
clearness 
of 
scientific 
exposition. 
Three 
interlocutors, 
named 
respectively 
Salviati, 
Sagredo, 
and 
Simplicio, 
take 
part 
in 
the 
four 
dialogues 
of 
which 
the 
work 
is 
composed. 
The 
first-named 
expounds 
the 
views 
of 
the 
author; 
the 
second 
is 
an 
eager 
and 
intelligent 
listener; 
the 
third 
represents 
a 
well-meaning 
but 
obtuse 
Peripatetic, 
whom 
the 
others 
treat 
at 
times 
with 
undisguised 
contempt. 
Salviati 
and 
Sagredo 
took 
their 
names 
from 
two 
of 
Galileo’s 
early 
friends, 
the 
former 
a 
learned 
Florentine, 
the 
latter 
a 
distinguished 
Venetian 
gentleman; 
Simplicio 
ostensibly 
derived 
his 
from 
the 
Cilician 
commentator 
of 
Aristotle, 
but 
the 
choice 
was 
doubtless 
instigated 
by 
a 
sarcastic 
regard 
to 
the 
double 
meaning 
of 
the 
word. 
There 
were 
not 
wanting 
those 
who 
insinuated 
that 
Galileo 
intended 
to 
depict 
the 
pope 
himself 
in 
the 
guise 
of 
the 
simpleton 
of 
the 
party; 
and 
the 
charge, 
though 
preposterous 
in 
itself, 
was 
supported 
by 
certain 
imprudences 
ofexpression,which 
Urbanwasnotpermitted 
toignore. 


It 
was 
at 
once 
evident 
that 
the 
whole 
tenor 
of 
this 
remarkable 
work 
was 
in 
flagrant 
contradiction 
with 
the 
edict 
passed 
sixteen 
years 
before 
its 
publication, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
the 
author’s 
personal 
pledge 
of 
conformity 
to 
it. 
The 
ironical 
submission 
with 
which 
it 
opened, 
and 
the 
assumed 
indetermination 
with 
which 
it 
closed, 
were 
hardly 
intended 
to 
mask 
the 



vigorous 
assertion 
of 
Copernican 
principles 
which 
formed 
its 
substance. 
It 
is 
a 
singular 
circumstance, 
however, 
that 
the 
argument 
upon 
which 
Galileo 
mainly 
relied 
as 
furnishing 
a 
physical 
demonstration 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
new 
theory 
rested 
on 
a 
misconception. 
The 
ebb 
and 
flow 
of 
the 
tides 
were, 
he 
asserted, 
a 
visible 
proof 
of 
the 
terrestrial 
double 
movement, 
since 
they 
resulted 
from 
inequalities 
in 
the 
absolute 
velocities 
through 
space 
of 
the 
various 
parts 
of 
the 
earth’s 
surface, 
due 
to 
its 
rotation. 
To 
this 
notion, 
which 
took 
its 
rise 
in 
a 
confusion 
of 
thought, 
he 
attached 
capital 
importance, 
and 
he 
treated 
with 
scorn 
Kepler’s 
suggestion 
that 
a 
certain 
occult 
attraction 
of 
the 
moon 
was 
in 
some 
way 
concerned 
in 
the 
phenomenon. 
The 
theological 
censures 
which 
the 
book 
did 
not 
fail 
to 
incur 
were 
not 
slow 
in 
making 
themselves 
felt. 
Towards 
the 
end 
of 
August 
the 
sale 
was 
prohibited; 
on 
the 
1st 
of 
October 
the 
author 
was 
cited 
to 
Rome 
by 
the 
Inquisition. 
He 
pleaded 
his 
age, 
now 
close 
upon 
seventy 
years, 
his 
infirm 
health, 
and 
the 
obstacles 
to 
travel 
caused 
by 
quarantine 
regulations; 
but 
the 
pope 
was 
sternly 
indignant 
at 
what 
he 
held 
to 
be 
his 
ingratitude 
and 
insubordination, 
and 
no 
excuse 
was 
admitted. 
At 
length, 
on 
the 
13th 
of 
February 
1633, 
he 
arrived 
at 
the 
residence 
of 
Niccolini, 
the 
Tuscan 
ambassador 
to 
the 
pontifical 
court, 
and 
there 
abode 
in 
retirement 
for 
two 
months. 
From 
the 
12th 
to 
the 
30th 
of 
April 
he 
was 
detained 
in 
the 
palace 
of 
the 
Inquisition, 
where 
he 
occupied 
the 
best 
apartments 
and 
was 
treated 
with 
unexampled 
indulgence. 
On 
the 
30th 
he 
was 
restored 
to 
the 
hospitality 
of 
Niccolini, 
his 
warm 
partisan. 
The 
accusation 
against 
him 
was 
that 
he 
had 
written 
in 
contravention 
of 
the 
decree 
of 
1616, 
and 
in 
defiance 
of 
the 
command 
of 
the 
Holy 
Office 
communicated 
to 
him 
by 
Cardinal 
Bellarmin; 
and 
his 
defence 
consisted 
mainly 
in 
a 
disavowal 
of 
his 
opinions, 
and 
an 
appeal 
to 
his 
good 
intentions. 
On 
the 
21st 
of 
June 
he 
was 
finally 
examined 
under 
menace 
of 
torture; 
but 
he 
continued 
to 
maintain 
his 
assertion 
that 
after 
itscondemnation 
by 
the 
Congregation 
of 
theIndex, 
he 
had 
never 
held 
the 
Copernican 
theory. 
Since 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
documents 
relating 
to 
this 
memorable 
trial, 
there 
can 
no 
longer 
be 
any 
doubt, 
not 
only 
that 
the 
threat 
of 
torture 
was 
not 
carried 
into 
execution, 
but 
that 
it 
was 
never 
intended 
that 
it 
should 
be. 
On 
the 
22nd 
of 
June, 
in 
the 
church 
of 
Santa 
Maria 
sopra 
Minerva, 
Galileo 
read 
his 
recantation, 
and 
received 
his 
sentence. 
He 
was 
condemned, 
as 
“vehemently 
suspected 
of 
heresy,” 
to 
incarceration 
at 
the 
pleasure 
of 
the 
tribunal, 
and 
by 
way 
of 
penance 
was 
enjoined 
to 
recite 
once 
a 
week 
for 
three 
years 
the 
seven 
penitential 
psalms. 
This 
sentence 
was 
signed 
by 
seven 
cardinals, 
but 
did 
not 
receive 
the 
customary 
papal 
ratification. 
The 



legend 
according 
to 
which 
Galileo, 
rising 
from 
his 
knees 
after 
repeating 
the 
formula 
of 
abjuration, 
stamped 
on 
the 
ground, 
and 
exclaimed, 
“Eppur 
si 
muove!” 
is, 
as 
may 
readily 
be 
supposed, 
entirely 
apocryphal. 
Its 
earliest 
ascertained 
appearance 
is 
in 
the 
Abbé 
Irailh’s 
Querelles 
littéraires 
(vol. 
iii. 
, 
1761). 


Galileo 
remained 
in 
the 
custody 
of 
the 
Inquisition 
from 
the 
21st 
to 
the 
24th 
of 
June, 
on 
which 
day 
he 
was 
relegated 
to 
the 
Villa 
Medici 
on 
the 
Trinità 
de’ 
Monti. 
Thence, 
on 
the 
6th 
of 
July, 
he 
was 
permitted 
to 
depart 
for 
Siena, 
where 
he 
spent 
several 
months 
in 
the 
house 
of 
the 
archbishop, 
Ascanio 
Piccolomini, 
one 
of 
his 
numerous 
and 
trusty 
friends. 
It 
was 
not 
until 
December 
that 
his 
earnest 
desire 
of 
returning 
to 
Florence 
was 
realized, 
and 
the 
remaining 
eight 
years 
of 
his 
life 
were 
spent 
in 
his 
villa 
at 
Arcetri 
called 
“Il 
Giojello,” 
in 
the 
strict 
seclusion 
which 
was 
the 
prescribed 
condition 
of 
his 
comparative 
freedom. 
Domestic 
afflictions 
combined 
with 
numerous 
and 
painful 
infirmities 
to 
embitter 
his 
old 
age. 
His 
sister-in-law 
and 
her 
whole 
family, 
who 
came 
to 
live 
with 
him 
on 
his 
return 
from 
Rome, 
perished 
shortly 
afterwards 
of 
the 
plague; 
and 
on 
the 
2nd 
of 
April 
1634 
died, 
to 
the 
inexpressible 
grief 
of 
her 
father, 
his 
eldest 
and 
best-beloved 
daughter, 
a 
nun 
in 
the 
convent 
of 
San 
Matteo 
at 
Arcetri. 
Galileo 
was 
never 
married; 
but 
by 
a 
Venetian 
woman 
named 
Marina 
Gamba 
he 
had 
three 
children 
— 
a 
son 
who 
married 
and 
left 
descendants, 
and 
two 
daughters 
who 
took 
the 
veil 
at 
an 
early 
age. 
His 
prodigious 
mental 
activity 
continued 
undiminished 
to 
the 
last. 
In 
1636 
he 
completed 
his 
Dialoghi 
delle 
nuove 
scienze, 
in 
which 
he 
recapitulated 
the 
results 
of 
his 
early 
experiments 
and 
mature 
meditations 
on 
the 
principles 
of 
mechanics. 
This 
in 
many 
respects 
his 
most 
valuable 
work 
was 
printed 
by 
the 
Elzevirs 
at 
Leiden 
in 
1638, 
and 
excited 
admiration 
equally 
universal 
and 
more 
lasting 
than 
that 
accorded 
to 
his 
astronomical 
treatises. 
His 
last 
telescopic 
discovery 
— 
that 
of 
the 
moon’s 
diurnal 
and 
monthly 
librations 
— 
was 
made 
in 
1637, 
only 
a 
few 
months 
before 
his 
eyes 
were 
for 
ever 
closed 
in 
hopeless 
blindness. 
It 
was 
in 
this 
condition 
that 
Milton 
found 
him 
when 
he 
visited 
him 
at 
Arcetri 
in 
1638. 
But 
the 
fire 
of 
his 
genius 
was 
not 
even 
yet 
extinct. 
He 
continued 
his 
scientific 
correspondence 
with 
unbroken 
interest 
and 
undiminished 
logical 
acumen; 
he 
thought 
out 
the 
application 
of 
the 
pendulum 
to 
the 
regulation 
of 
clockwork, 
which 
Huygens 
successfully 
realized 
fifteen 
years 
later; 
and 
he 
was 
engaged 
in 
dictating 
to 
his 
disciples, 
Viviani 
and 
Torricelli, 
his 
latest 
ideas 
on 
the 
theory 
of 
impact 
when 
he 
was 
seized 
with 
the 
slow 
fever 
which 
in 
two 
months 
brought 
him 
to 
the 
grave. 
On 



the 
8th 
of 
January 
1642 
he 
closed 
his 
long 
life 
of 
triumph 
and 
humiliation, 
which 
just 
spanned 
the 
interval 
between 
the 
death 
of 
Michelangelo 
and 
the 
birthof 
IsaacNewton. 


The 
direct 
services 
which 
Galileo 
rendered 
to 
astronomy 
are 
virtually 
summed 
up 
in 
his 
telescopic 
discoveries. 
To 
the 
theoretical 
perfection 
of 
the 
science 
he 
contributed 
little 
or 
nothing. 
He 
pointed 
out 
indeed 
that 
the 
so-
called 
“third 
motion,” 
introduced 
by 
Copernicus 
to 
account 
for 
the 
constant 
parallelism 
of 
the 
earth’s 
axis, 
was 
a 
superfluous 
complication. 
But 
he 
substituted 
the 
equally 
unnecessary 
hypothesis 
of 
a 
magnetic 
attraction, 
and 
failed 
to 
perceive 
that 
the 
phenomenon 
to 
be 
explained 
was, 
in 
relation 
to 
absolute 
space, 
not 
a 
movement 
but 
the 
absence 
of 
movement. 
The 
circumstance, 
however, 
which 
most 
seriously 
detracts 
from 
his 
scientific 
reputation 
is 
his 
neglect 
of 
the 
discoveries 
made 
during 
his 
lifetime 
by 
the 
greatest 
of 
his 
contemporaries. 
Kepler’s 
first 
and 
second 
laws 
were 
published 
in 
1609, 
and 
his 
third 
ten 
years 
later. 
By 
these 
momentous 
inductions 
the 
geometrical 
theory 
of 
the 
solar 
system 
was 
perfected, 
and 
a 
hitherto 
unimagined 
symmetry 
was 
perceived 
to 
regulate 
the 
mutual 
relations 
of 
its 
members. 
But 
by 
Galileo 
they 
were 
passed 
over 
in 
silence. 
In 
his 
Dialogo 
dei 
massimi 
sistemi, 
printed 
not 
less 
than 
thirteen 
years 
after 
the 
last 
of 
the 
three 
laws 
had 
been 
given 
to 
the 
world, 
the 
epicycles 
by 
which 
Copernicus, 
adhering 
to 
the 
ancient 
postulate 
of 
uniform 
circular 
motion, 
had 
endeavoured 
to 
reduce 
to 
theory 
the 
irregularities 
of 
the 
planetary 
movements, 
were 
neither 
expressly 
adopted 
nor 
expressly 
rejected; 
and 
the 
conclusion 
seems 
inevitable 
that 
this 
grave 
defection 
from 
the 
cause 
of 
progress 
was 
due 
to 
his 
perhaps 
unconscious 
reluctance 
to 
accept 
discoveries 
which 
he 
had 
not 
originated. 
His 
name 
is 
nevertheless 
justly 
associated 
with 
that 
vast 
extension 
of 
the 
bounds 
of 
the 
visible 
universe 
which 
has 
rendered 
modern 
astronomy 
the 
most 
sublime 
of 
sciences, 
and 
his 
telescopic 
observationsare 
astandingmonumenttohissagacityand 
acumen. 


With 
the 
sure 
instinct 
of 
genius, 
he 
seized 
the 
characteristic 
features 
of 
the 
phenomena 
presented 
to 
his 
attention, 
and 
his 
inferences, 
except 
when 
distorted 
by 
polemical 
exigencies, 
have 
been 
strikingly 
confirmed 
by 
modern 
investigations. 
Of 
his 
two 
capital 
errors, 
regarding 
respectively 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
tides 
and 
the 
nature 
of 
comets, 
the 
first 
was 
insidiously 
recommended 
to 
him 
by 
his 
passionate 
desire 
to 
find 
a 
physical 
confirmation 
of 
the 
earth’s 
double 
motion; 
the 
second 
was 
adopted 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
rebutting 
an 
anti-
Copernican 
argument 
founded 
on 
the 
planetary 
analogies 
of 
those 
erratic 



subjects 
of 
the 
sun. 
Within 
two 
years 
of 
their 
first 
discovery, 
he 
had 
constructed 
approximately 
accurate 
tables 
of 
the 
revolutions 
of 
Jupiter’s 
satellites, 
and 
he 
proposed 
their 
frequent 
eclipses 
as 
a 
means 
of 
determining 
longitudes, 
not 
only 
on 
land, 
but 
at 
sea. 
This 
method, 
on 
which 
he 
laid 
great 
stress, 
and 
for 
the 
facilitation 
of 
which 
he 
invented 
a 
binocular 
glass, 
and 
devised 
some 
skilful 
mechanical 
contrivances, 
was 
offered 
by 
him 
in 
1616 
to 
the 
Spanish 
government, 
and 
afterwards 
to 
that 
of 
Tuscany, 
but 
in 
each 
case 
unsuccessfully; 
and 
the 
close 
of 
his 
life 
was 
occupied 
with 
prolonged 
but 
fruitless 
negotiations 
on 
the 
same 
subject 
with 
the 
states-general 
of 
Holland. 
Theidea,though 
ingenious,hasbeenfoundoflittlepracticalutilityatsea. 


A 
series 
of 
careful 
observations 
made 
him 
acquainted 
with 
the 
principal 
appearances 
revealed 
by 
modern 
instruments 
in 
the 
solar 
spots. 
He 
pointed 
out 
that 
they 
were 
limited 
to 
a 
certain 
defined 
zone 
on 
the 
sun’s 
surface; 
he 
noted 
the 
faculae 
with 
which 
they 
are 
associated, 
the 
penumbra 
by 
which 
they 
are 
bordered, 
their 
slight 
proper 
motions 
and 
their 
rapid 
changes 
of 
form. 
He 
inferred 
from 
the 
regularity 
of 
their 
general 
movements 
the 
rotation 
of 
the 
sun 
on 
its 
axis 
in 
a 
period 
of 
little 
less 
than 
a 
month; 
and 
he 
grounded 
on 
the 
varying 
nature 
of 
the 
paths 
seemingly 
traversed 
by 
them 
a 
plausible, 
though 
inconclusive, 
argument 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
earth’s 
annual 
revolution. 
Twice 
in 
the 
year, 
he 
observed, 
they 
seem 
to 
travel 
across 
the 
solar 
disk 
in 
straight 
lines; 
at 
other 
times, 
in 
curves. 
These 
appearances 
he 
referred 
with 
great 
acuteness 
to 
the 
slight 
inclination 
of 
the 
sun’s 
axis 
of 
rotation 
to 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
ecliptic. 
Thus, 
when 
the 
earth 
finds 
herself 
in 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
sun’s 
equator, 
which 
occurs 
at 
two 
opposite 
points 
of 
her 
orbit, 
the 
spots, 
travelling 
in 
circles 
parallel 
with 
that 
plane, 
necessarily 
appear 
to 
describe 
right 
lines; 
but 
when 
the 
earth 
is 
above 
or 
below 
the 
equatorial 
level, 
the 
paths 
of 
the 
spots 
open 
out 
into 
curves 
turned 
downwards 
or 
upwards, 
according 
to 
the 
direction 
in 
which 
they 
are 
seen. 
But 
the 
explanation 
of 
this 
phenomenon 
is 
equally 
consistent 
with 
the 
geocentric 
as 
with 
the 
heliocentric 
theory 
of 
the 
solar 
system. 
The 
idea 
of 
a 
universal 
force 
of 
gravitation 
seems 
to 
have 
hovered 
on 
the 
borders 
of 
this 
great 
man’s 
mind, 
without 
ever 
fully 
entering 
it. 
He 
perceived 
the 
analogy 
between 
the 
power 
which 
holds 
the 
moon 
in 
the 
neighbourhood 
of 
the 
earth, 
and 
compels 
Jupiter’s 
satellites 
to 
circulate 
round 
their 
primary, 
and 
the 
attraction 
exercised 
by 
the 
earth 
on 
bodies 
at 
its 
surface; 
but 
he 
failed 
to 
conceive 
the 
combination 
of 
central 
force 
with 
tangential 
velocity, 
and 
was 
disposed 
to 
connect 
the 
revolutions 
of 
the 
planets 
with 
the 
axial 
rotation 
of 
the 
sun. 
This 
notion, 
it 
is 
plain, 
tended 



rather 
towards 
Descartes’s 
theory 
of 
vortices 
than 
towards 
Newton’s 
theory 
of 
gravitation. 
More 
valid 
instances 
of 
the 
anticipation 
of 
modern 
discoveries 
may 
be 
found 
in 
his 
prevision 
that 
a 
small 
annual 
parallax 
would 
eventually 
be 
found 
forsome 
of 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
and 
that 
extra-Saturnian 
planetswouldat 
some 
future 
time 
be 
ascertained 
to 
exist, 
and 
in 
his 
conviction 
that 
light 
travelswith 
ameasurable, 
although, 
inrelationtoterrestrialdistances,infinite 
velocity. 


The 
invention 
of 
the 
microscope, 
attributed 
to 
Galileo 
by 
his 
first 
biographer, 
Vincenzio 
Viviani, 
does 
not 
in 
truth 
belong 
to 
him. 
Such 
an 
instrument 
was 
made 
as 
early 
as 
1590 
by 
Zacharias 
Jansen 
of 
Middleburg; 
and 
although 
Galileo 
discovered, 
in 
1610, 
a 
means 
of 
adapting 
his 
telescope 
to 
the 
examination 
of 
minute 
objects, 
he 
did 
not 
become 
acquainted 
with 
the 
compound 
microscope 
until 
1624 
when 
he 
saw 
one 
of 
Drebbel’s 
instruments 
in 
Rome, 
and, 
with 
characteristic 
ingenuity, 
immediately 
introduced 
some 
materialimprovements 
intoitsconstruction. 


The 
most 
substantial, 
if 
not 
the 
most 
brilliant 
part 
of 
his 
work 
consisted 
undoubtedly 
in 
his 
contributions 
towards 
the 
establishment 
of 
mechanics 
as 
a 
science. 
Some 
valuable 
but 
isolated 
facts 
and 
theorems 
had 
been 
previously 
discovered 
and 
proved, 
but 
it 
was 
he 
who 
first 
clearly 
grasped 
the 
idea 
of 
force 
as 
a 
mechanical 
agent, 
and 
extended 
to 
the 
external 
world 
the 
conception 
of 
the 
invariability 
of 
the 
relation 
between 
cause 
and 
effect. 
From 
the 
time 
of 
Archimedes 
there 
had 
existed 
a 
science 
of 
equilibrium, 
but 
the 
science 
of 
motion 
began 
with 
Galileo. 
It 
is 
not 
too 
much 
to 
say 
that 
the 
final 
triumph 
of 
the 
Copernican 
system 
was 
due 
in 
larger 
measure 
to 
his 
labours 
in 
this 
department 
than 
to 
his 
direct 
arguments 
in 
its 
favour. 
The 
problem 
of 
the 
heavens 
is 
essentially 
a 
mechanical 
one; 
and 
without 
the 
mechanical 
conceptions 
of 
the 
dependence 
of 
motion 
upon 
force 
which 
Galileo 
familiarized 
to 
men’s 
minds, 
that 
problem 
might 
have 
remained 
a 
sealed 
book 
even 
to 
the 
intelligence 
of 
Newton. 
The 
interdependence 
of 
motion 
and 
force 
was 
not 
indeed 
formulated 
into 
definite 
laws 
by 
Galileo, 
but 
his 
writings 
on 
dynamics 
are 
everywhere 
suggestive 
of 
those 
laws, 
and 
his 
solutions 
of 
dynamical 
problems 
involve 
their 
recognition. 
The 
extraordinary 
advances 
made 
by 
him 
in 
this 
branch 
of 
knowledge 
were 
owing 
to 
his 
happy 
method 
of 
applying 
mathematical 
analysis 
to 
physical 
problems. 
As 
a 
pure 
mathematician 
he 
was, 
it 
is 
true, 
surpassed 
in 
profundity 
by 
more 
than 
one 
among 
his 
pupils 
and 
contemporaries; 
and 
in 
the 
wider 
imaginative 
grasp 
of 
abstract 
geometrical 
principles 
he 
cannot 
be 
compared 
with 
Fermat, 



Descartes 
or 
Pascal, 
to 
say 
nothing 
of 
Newton 
or 
Leibnitz. 
Still, 
even 
in 
the 
regionofpuremathematics,hispowerfulandoriginalmindleft 
notable 
traces 
of 
its 
working. 
He 
studied 
the 
properties 
of 
the 
cycloid, 
and 
attempted 
the 
problem 
of 
its 
quadrature; 
and 
in 
the 
“infinitesimals,” 
which 
he 
was 
one 
of 
the 
first 
to 
introduce 
into 
geometrical 
demonstrations, 
was 
contained 
the 
fruitful 
germ 
of 
the 
differential 
calculus. 
But 
the 
method 
which 
was 
peculiarly 
his, 
and 
which 
still 
forms 
the 
open 
road 
to 
discoveries 
in 
natural 
science, 
consisted 
in 
the 
combinationofexperiment 
with 
calculation 
— 
in 
the 
transformationoftheconcreteintotheabstract,and 
theassiduouscomparison 
of 
results. 
The 
first-fruits 
of 
the 
new 
system 
of 
investigation 
was 
his 
determination 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
falling 
bodies. 
Conceiving 
that 
the 
simplest 
principle 
is 
the 
most 
likely 
to 
be 
true, 
he 
assumed 
as 
a 
postulate 
that 
bodies 
falling 
freely 
towards 
the 
earth 
descend 
with 
a 
uniformly 
accelerated 
motion, 
and 
deduced 
thence 
that 
the 
velocities 
acquired 
are 
in 
the 
direct, 
and 
the 
spaces 
traversed 
in 
the 
duplicate 
ratio 
of 
the 
times, 
counted 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
motion; 
finally, 
he 
proved, 
by 
observing 
the 
times 
of 
descent 
of 
bodies 
falling 
down 
inclined 
planes, 
that 
the 
postulated 
law 
was 
the 
true 
law. 
Even 
here, 
he 
was 
obliged 
to 
take 
for 
granted 
that 
the 
velocities 
acquired 
in 
descending 
from 
the 
same 
height 
along 
planes 
of 
every 
inclination 
are 
equal; 
and 
it 
was 
not 
until 
shortly 
before 
his 
death 
that 
he 
found 
the 
mathematical 
demonstrationofthisnotveryobviousprinciple. 


The 
first 
law 
of 
motion 
— 
that 
which 
expresses 
the 
principle 
of 
inertia 
— 
is 
virtually 
contained 
in 
the 
idea 
of 
uniformly 
accelerated 
velocity. 
The 
recognition 
of 
the 
second 
— 
that 
of 
the 
independence 
of 
different 
motions 
— 
must 
be 
added 
to 
form 
the 
true 
theory 
of 
projectiles. 
This 
was 
due 
to 
Galileo. 
Up 
to 
his 
time 
it 
was 
universally 
held 
in 
the 
schools 
that 
the 
motion 
of 
a 
body 
should 
cease 
with 
the 
impulse 
communicated 
to 
it, 
but 
for 
the 
“reaction 
of 
the 
medium” 
helping 
it 
forward. 
Galileo 
showed, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
that 
the 
nature 
of 
motion 
once 
impressed 
is 
to 
continue 
indefinitely 
in 
a 
uniform 
direction, 
and 
that 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
medium 
is 
a 
retarding, 
not 
an 
impelling 
one. 
Another 
commonly 
received 
axiom 
was 
that 
no 
body 
could 
be 
affected 
by 
more 
than 
one 
movement 
at 
one 
time, 
and 
it 
was 
thus 
supposed 
that 
a 
cannon 
ball, 
or 
other 
projectile, 
moves 
forward 
in 
a 
right 
line 
until 
its 
first 
impulse 
is 
exhausted, 
when 
it 
falls 
vertically 
to 
the 
ground. 
In 
the 
fourth 
of 
Galileo’s 
dialogues 
on 
mechanics, 
he 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
path 
described 
by 
a 
projectile, 
being 
the 
result 
of 
the 
combination 
of 
a 
uniform 
transverse 
motion 
with 
a 
uniformly 
accelerated 
vertical 
motion, 
must, 
apart 
from 
the 
resistance 



of 
the 
air, 
be 
a 
parabola. 
The 
establishment 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
composition 
of 
motions 
formed 
a 
conclusive 
answer 
to 
the 
most 
formidable 
of 
the 
arguments 
used 
against 
the 
rotation 
of 
the 
earth, 
and 
we 
find 
it 
accordingly 
triumphantly 
brought 
forward 
by 
Galileo 
in 
the 
second 
of 
his 
dialogues 
on 
the 
systems 
of 
the 
world. 
It 
was 
urged 
by 
anti-Copernicans 
that 
a 
body 
flung 
upward 
or 
cast 
downward 
would, 
if 
the 
earth 
were 
in 
motion, 
be 
left 
behind 
by 
the 
rapid 
translation 
of 
the 
point 
from 
which 
it 
started; 
Galileo 
proved 
on 
the 
contrary 
that 
the 
reception 
of 
a 
fresh 
impulse 
in 
no 
way 
interfered 
with 
the 
movement 
already 
impressed, 
and 
that 
the 
rotation 
of 
the 
earth 
was 
insensible, 
because 
shared 
equally 
by 
all 
bodies 
at 
its 
surface. 
His 
theory 
of 
the 
inclined 
plane, 
combined 
with 
his 
satisfactory 
definition 
of 
“momentum,” 
led 
him 
towards 
the 
third 
law 
of 
motion. 
We 
find 
Newton’s 
theorem, 
that 
“action 
and 
reaction 
are 
equal 
and 
opposite,” 
stated 
with 
approximate 
precision 
in 
his 
treatise 
Della 
scienza 
meccanica, 
which 
contains 
the 
substance 
of 
lectures 
delivered 
during 
his 
professorship 
at 
Padua; 
and 
thesame 
principle 
is 
involved 
in 
the 
axiom 
enunciated 
in 
the 
third 
of 
his 
mechanical 
dialogues, 
that 
“the 
propensity 
of 
a 
body 
to 
fall 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
least 
resistance 
which 
suffices 
to 
support 
it.” 
The 
problems 
of 
percussion, 
however,receivednodefinitivesolutionuntil 
after 
his 
death. 


His 
services 
were 
as 
conspicuous 
in 
the 
statical 
as 
in 
the 
kinetical 
division 
of 
mechanics. 
He 
gave 
the 
first 
satisfactory 
demonstration 
of 
equilibrium 
on 
an 
inclined 
plane, 
reducing 
it 
to 
the 
level 
by 
a 
sound 
and 
ingenious 
train 
of 
reasoning; 
while, 
by 
establishing 
the 
theory 
of 
“virtual 
velocities,” 
he 
laid 
down 
the 
fundamental 
principle 
which, 
in 
the 
opinion 
of 
Lagrange, 
contains 
the 
general 
expression 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
equilibrium. 
He 
studied 
with 
attention 
the 
still 
obscure 
subject 
of 
molecular 
cohesion, 
and 
little 
has 
been 
added 
to 
what 
he 
ascertained 
on 
the 
question 
of 
transverse 
strains 
and 
the 
strength 
of 
beams, 
first 
brought 
by 
him 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
mechanical 
theory. 
In 
his 
Discorso 
intorno 
alle 
cose 
che 
stanno 
su 
l’acqua, 
published 
in 
1612, 
he 
used 
the 
principle 
of 
virtual 
velocities 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
more 
important 
theorems 
of 
hydrostatics, 
deducing 
from 
it 
the 
equilibrium 
of 
fluid 
in 
a 
siphon, 
and 
proved 
against 
the 
Aristotelians 
that 
the 
floating 
of 
solid 
bodies 
in 
a 
liquid 
depends 
not 
upon 
their 
form, 
but 
upon 
their 
specific 
gravities 
relative 
to 
such 
liquid. 


In 
order 
to 
form 
an 
adequate 
estimate 
of 
the 
stride 
made 
by 
Galileo 
in 
natural 
philosophy, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
enumerate 
the 
confused 
and 
erroneous 
opinions 
prevailing 
on 
all 
such 
subjects 
in 
his 
time. 
His 
best 



eulogium, 
it 
has 
been 
truly 
said, 
consists 
in 
the 
fallacies 
which 
he 
exposed. 
The 
scholastic 
distinctions 
between 
corruptible 
and 
incorruptible 
substances, 
between 
absolute 
gravity 
and 
absolute 
levity, 
between 
natural 
and 
violent 
motions, 
if 
they 
did 
not 
wholly 
disappear 
from 
scientific 
phraseology, 
ceased 
thenceforward 
to 
hold 
the 
place 
of 
honour 
in 
the 
controversies 
of 
the 
learned. 
Discarding 
these 
obscure 
and 
misleading 
notions, 
Galileo 
taught 
that 
gravity 
and 
levity 
are 
relative 
terms, 
and 
that 
all 
bodies 
are 
heavy, 
even 
those 
which, 
like 
the 
air, 
are 
invisible; 
that 
motion 
is 
the 
result 
of 
force, 
instantaneous 
or 
continuous; 
that 
weight 
is 
a 
continuous 
force, 
attracting 
towards 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
earth; 
that, 
in 
a 
vacuum, 
all 
bodies 
would 
fall 
with 
equal 
velocities; 
that 
the 
“inertia 
of 
matter” 
implies 
the 
continuance 
of 
motion, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
permanence 
of 
rest; 
and 
that 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
heavenly 
bodies 
is 
equally 
“corruptible” 
with 
that 
of 
the 
earth. 
These 
simple 
elementary 
ideas 
were 
eminently 
capable 
of 
development 
and 
investigation, 
and 
were 
not 
only 
true 
but 
the 
prelude 
to 
further 
truth; 
while 
those 
they 
superseded 
defied 
inquiry 
by 
their 
vagueness 
and 
obscurity. 
Galileo 
was 
a 
man 
born 
in 
due 
time. 
He 
was 
superior 
to 
his 
contemporaries, 
but 
not 
isolated 
amongst 
them. 
He 
represented 
and 
intensified 
a 
growing 
tendency 
of 
the 
age 
in 
which 
he 
lived. 
It 
was 
beginning 
to 
be 
suspected 
that 
from 
Aristotle 
an 
appeal 
lay 
to 
nature, 
and 
some 
were 
found 
who 
no 
longer 
treated 
the 
ipse 
dixit 
of 
the 
Stagirite 
as 
the 
final 
authority 
in 
matters 
of 
science. 
A 
vigorous 
but 
ineffectual 
warfare 
had 
already 
been 
waged 
against 
the 
blind 
traditions 
of 
the 
schools 
by 
Ramus 
and 
Telesius, 
by 
Patricius 
and 
Campanella, 
and 
the 
revolution 
which 
Galileo 
completed 
had 
been 
prepared 
by 
his 
predecessors. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
task 
which 
he 
so 
effectually 
accomplished 
demanded 
the 
highest 
and 
rarest 
quality 
of 
genius. 
He 
struck 
out 
for 
himself 
the 
happy 
middle 
path 
between 
the 
a 
priori 
and 
the 
empirical 
systems, 
and 
exemplified 
with 
brilliant 
success 
the 
method 
by 
which 
experimental 
science 
has 
wrested 
from 
nature 
so 
many 
ofhersecrets. 
Hismindwaseminentlypractical. 
Heconcernedhimselfabove

with 
what 
fell 
within 
the

of

and

to

the 
larger 
but 
less 
fruitful 
speculations 
which 
can 
never 
be 
brought 
to 
the 
direct 
test 
of 
experiment. 
Thus, 
while 
far-reaching 
but 
hasty 
generalizations 
have 
had 
their 
day 
and 
been 
forgotten, 
his 
work 
has 
proved 
permanent, 
because 
he 
made 
sure 
of 
its 
foundations. 
His 
keen 
intuition 
of 
truth, 
his 
vigour 
and 
yet 
sobriety 
of 
argument, 
his 
fertility 
of 
illustration 
and 
acuteness 
of 
sarcasm, 
made 
him 
irresistible 
to 
his 
antagonists; 
and 
the 
evanescent 
triumphs 
of 



scornful 
controversy 
have 
given 
place 
to 
the 
sedate 
applause 
of 
a 
long-lived 
posterity. 


The 
first 
complete 
edition 
of 
Galileo’s 
writings 
was 
published 
at 
Florence 
(1842–1856), 
in 
16 
8vo 
vols., 
under 
the 
supervision 
of 
Signor 
Eugenio 
Albèri. 
Besides 
the 
works 
already 
enumerated, 
it 
contained 
the 
Sermones 
de 
motu 
gravium 
composed 
at 
Pisa 
between 
1589 
and 
1591; 
his 
letters 
to 
his 
friends, 
with 
many 
of 
their 
replies, 
as 
well 
as 
several 
of 
the 
essays 
of 
his 
scientific 
opponents; 
his 
laudatory 
comments 
on 
the 
Orlando 
Furioso, 
and 
depreciatory 
notes 
on 
the 
Gerusalemme 
Liberata, 
some 
stanzas 
and 
sonnets 
of 
no 
great 
merit, 
together 
with 
the 
sketch 
of 
a 
comedy; 
finally, 
a 
reprint 
of 
Viviani’s 
Life, 
with 
valuable 
notes 
and

The 
original 
documents 
from 
the 
archives 
of 
the 
Inquisition, 
relating 
to 
the 
events 
of 
1616 
and 
1633, 
recovered 
from 
Paris 
in 
1846 
by 
the 
efforts 
of 
Count 
Rossi, 
and 
now 
in 
the 
Vatican 
Library, 
were 
to 
a 
limited 
extent 
made 
public 
by 
Monsignor 
Marino-
Marini 
in 
1850, 
and 
more 
unreservedly 
by 
M. 
Henri 
de 
l’Épinois, 
in 
an 
essay 
entitled 
Galilée, 
son 
procès, 
sa 
condemnation,published 
in1867inthe 
Revue 
des 
questions 
historiques. 
He 
was 
followed 
by 
M. 
Karl 
von 
Gebler, 
who, 
in 
an 
able 
and 
exhaustive 
but 
somewhat 
prejudiced 
work, 
Galileo 
Galilei 
und 
die 
römische 
Curie 
(Stuttgart, 
1876), 
sought 
to 
impeach 
the 
authenticity 
of 
a 
document 
of 
prime 
importance 
in 
the 
trial 
of 
1633. 
He 
was 
victoriously 
answered 
by 
Signor 
Domenico 
Berti, 
in 
Il 
Processo 
originale 
di 
Galileo 
Galilei 
(Rome, 
1876), 
and 
by 
M. 
de 
l’Épinois, 
with 
Les 
pièces 
du 
procès 
de 
Galilée 
(Rome, 
Paris, 
1877). 
The 
touching 
letters 
of 
Galileo’s 
eldest 
daughter, 
Sister 
Maria 
Celeste, 
to 
her 
father 
were 
printed 
in 
1864 
by 
Professor 
Carlo 
Arduini, 
in 
a 
publication 
entitled 
La 
Primogenita 
di 
Galileo 
Galilei. 


The 
issue 
of 
a 
“national 
edition” 
of 
the 
Works 
of 
Galileo, 
in 
20 
large 
volumes, 
was 
begun 
at 
Florence 
in 
1890. 
It 
includes 
a 
mass 
of 
previously 
inedited 
correspondence 
and 
other 
documents, 
collected 
by 
the 
indefatigable 
director, 
Professor 
Antonio 
Favaro, 
among 
whose 
numerous 
publications 
on 
Galilean 
subjects 
may 
be 
mentioned: 
Galileo 
e 
lo 
studio 
di 
Padova 
(2 
vols., 
1883); 
Scampoli 
Galileani 
(12 
series, 
1886–1897);

of 
Galileo 
to 
the 
Church 
are 
temperately 
and 
ably 
discussed 
by 
F.R. 
Wegg-Prosser 
in 
Galileo 
and 
his 
Judges 
(1889), 
and 
in 
two 
articles 
published
