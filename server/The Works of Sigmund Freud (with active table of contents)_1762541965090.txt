INTRODUCTION 
TO 
TRANSLATION 


The 
somewhat 
famous 
"Three 
Essays," 
which 
Dr. 
Brill 
is 
here 
bringing 
to 
the 
attention 
of 
an 
English-reading 
public, 
occupy--brief 
as 
they 
are--an 
important 
position 
among 
the 
achievements 
of 
their 
author, 
a 
great 
investigator 
and 
pioneer 
in 
an 
important 
line. 
It 
is 
not 
claimed 
that 
the 
facts 
here 
gathered 
are 
altogether 
new. 
The 
subject 
of 
the 
sexual 
instinct 
and 
its 
aberrations 
has 
long 
been 
before 
the 
scientific 
world 
and 
the 
names 
of 
many 
effective 
toilers 
in 
this 
vast 
field 
are 
known 
to 
every 
student. 
When 
one 
passes 
beyond 
the 
strict 
domains 
of 
science 
and 
considers 
what 
is 
reported 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
in 
folkways 
and 
art-lore 
and 
the 
history 
of 
primitive 
culture 
and 
in 
romance, 
the 
sources 
of 
information 
are 
immense. 
Freud 
has 
made 
considerable 
additions 
to 
this 
stock 
of 
knowledge, 
but 
he 
has 
done 
also 
something 
of 
far 
greater 
consequence 
than 
this. 
He 
has 
worked 
out, 
with 
incredible 
penetration, 
the 
part 
which 
this 
instinct 
plays 
in 
every 
phase 
of 
human 
life 
and 
in 
the 
development 
of 
human 
character, 
and 
has 
been 
able 
to 
establish 
on 
a 
firm 
footing 
the 
remarkable 
thesis 
that 
psychoneurotic 
illnesses 
never 
occur 
with 
a 
perfectly 
normal 
sexual 
life. 
Other 
sorts 
of 
emotions 
contribute 
to 
the 
result, 
but 
some 
aberration 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
is 
always 
present, 
as 
the 
cause 
of 
especially 
insistent 
emotions 
and 
repressions. 
The 
instincts 
with 
which 
every 
child 
is 
born 
furnish 
desires 
or 
cravings 
which 
must 
be 
dealt 
with 
in 
some 
fashion. 
They 
may 
be 
refined 
("sublimated"), 
so 
far 
as 
is 
necessary 
and 
desirable, 
into 
energies 
of 
other 
sorts--as 
happens 
readily 
with 
the 
play-instinct--or 
they 
may 
remain 
as 
the 
source 
of 
perversions 
and 
inversions, 
and 
of 
cravings 
of 
new 
sorts 
substituted 
for 
those 
of 
the 
more 
primitive 
kinds 
under 
the 
pressure 
of 
a 
conventional 
civilization. 
The 
symptoms 
of 
the 
functional 
psychoneuroses 
represent, 
after 
a 
fashion, 
some 
of 
these 
distorted 
attempts 
to 
find 
a 
substitute 
for 
the 
imperative 
cravings 
born 
of 
the 
sexual 
instincts, 
and 
their 
form 
often 
depends, 
in 
part 
at 
least, 
on 
the 
peculiarities 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
in 
infancy 
and 
early 
childhood. 
It 
is 
Freud's 
service 
to 
have 
investigated 
this 
inadequately 
chronicled 
period 
of 
existence 
with 
extraordinary 
acumen. 
In 
so 
doing 
he 
made 
it 
plain 
that 
the 
"perversions" 
and 
"inversions," 
which 
reappear 
later 
under 
such 
striking 
shapes, 
belong 
to 
the 
normal 
sexual 
life 
of 
the 
young 
child 
and 
are 
seen, 
in 
veiled 
forms, 
in 
almost 
every 
case 
of 
nervous 
illness. 
It 
cannot 
too 
often 
be 
repeated 
that 
these 
discoveries 
represent 
no 
fanciful 
deductions, 
but 
are 
the 
outcome 
of 
rigidly 
careful 
observations 
which 
any 
one 
who 
will 
sufficiently 
prepare 
himself 
can 
verify. 
Critics 
fret 
over 
the 
amount 



of 
"sexuality" 
that 
Freud 
finds 
evidence 
of 
in 
the 
histories 
of 
his 
patients, 
and 
assume 
that 
he 
puts 
it 
there. 
But 
such 
criticisms 
are 
evidences 
of 
misunderstandings 
and 
proofs 
of 
ignorance. 
Freud 
had 
learned 
that 
the 
amnesias 
of 
hypnosis 
and 
of 
hysteria 
were 
not 
absolute 
but 
relative 
and 
that 
in 
covering 
the 
lost 
memories, 
much 
more, 
of 
unexpected 
sort, 
was 
often 
found. 
Others, 
too, 
had 
gone 
as 
far 
as 
this, 
and 
stopped. 
But 
this 
investigator 
determined 
that 
nothing 
but 
the 
absolute 
impossibility 
of 
going 
further 
should 
make 
him 
cease 
from 
urging 
his 
patients 
into 
an 
inexorable 
scrutiny 
of 
the 
unconscious 
regions 
of 
their 
memories 
and 
thoughts, 
such 
as 
never 
had 
been 
made 
before. 
Every 
species 
of 
forgetfulness, 
even 
the 
forgetfulness 
of 
childhood's 
years, 
was 
made 
to 
yield 
its 
hidden 
stores 
of 
knowledge; 
dreams, 
even 
though 
apparently 
absurd, 
were 
found 
to 
be 
interpreters 
of 
a 
varied 
class 
of 
thoughts, 
active, 
although 
repressed 
as 
out 
of 
harmony 
with 
the 
selected 
life 
of 
consciousness; 
layer 
after 
layer, 
new 
sets 
of 
motives 
underlying 
motives 
were 
laid 
bare, 
and 
each 
patient's 
interest 
was 
strongly 
enlisted 
in 
the 
task 
of 
learning 
to 
know 
himself 
in 
order 
more 
truly 
and 
wisely 
to 
"sublimate" 
himself. 
Gradually 
other 
workers 
joined 
patiently 
in 
this 
laborious 
undertaking, 
which 
now 
stands, 
for 
those 
who 
have 
taken 
pains 
to 
comprehend 
it, 
as 
by 
far 
the 
most 
important 
movement 
in 
psychopathology. 
It 
must, 
however, 
be 
recognized 
that 
these 
essays, 
of 
which 
Dr. 
Brill 
has 
given 
a 
translation 
that 
cannot 
but 
be 
timely, 
concern 
a 
subject 
which 
is 
not 
only 
important 
but 
unpopular. 
Few 
physicians 
read 
the 
works 
of 
v. 
Krafft-
Ebing, 
Magnus 
Hirschfeld, 
Moll, 
and 
others 
of 
like 
sort. 
The 
remarkable 
volumes 
of 
Havelock 
Ellis 
were 
refused 
publication 
in 
his 
native 
England. 
The 
sentiments 
which 
inspired 
this 
hostile 
attitude 
towards 
the 
study 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
are 
still 
active, 
though 
growing 
steadily 
less 
common. 
One 
may 
easily 
believe 
that 
if 
the 
facts 
which 
Freud's 
truth-seeking 
researches 
forced 
him 
to 
recognize 
and 
to 
publish 
had 
not 
been 
of 
an 
unpopular 
sort, 
his 
rich 
and 
abundant 
contributions 
to 
observational 
psychology, 
to 
the 
significance 
of 
dreams, 
to 
the 
etiology 
and 
therapeutics 
of 
the 
psychoneuroses, 
to 
the 
interpretation 
of 
mythology, 
would 
have 
won 
for 
him, 
by 
universal 
acclaim, 
the 
same 
recognition 
among 
all 
physicians 
that 
he 
has 
received 
from 
a 
rapidly 
increasing 
band 
of 
followers 
and 
colleagues. 
May 
Dr. 
Brill's 
translation 
help 
toward 
this 
end. 
There 
are 
two 
further 
points 
on 
which 
some 
comments 
should 
be 
made. 
The 
first 
is 
this, 
that 
those 
who 
conscientiously 
desire 
to 
learn 
all 
that 
they 
can 



from 
Freud's 
remarkable 
contributions 
should 
not 
be 
content 
to 
read 
any 
one 
of 
them 
alone. 
His 
various 
publications, 
such 
as 
"The 
Selected 
Papers 
on 
Hysteria 
and 
Other 
Psychoneuroses,"[1] 
"The 
Interpretation 
of 
Dreams,"[2] 
"The 
Psychopathology 
of 
Everyday 
Life,"[3] 
"Wit 
and 
its 
Relation 
to 
the 
Unconscious,"[4] 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
case 
of 
the 
little 
boy 
called 
Hans, 
the 
study 
of 
Leonardo 
da 
Vinci,[4a] 
and 
the 
various 
short 
essays 
in 
the 
four 
Sammlungen 
kleiner 
Schriften, 
not 
only 
all 
hang 
together, 
but 
supplement 
each 
other 
to 
a 
remarkable 
extent. 
Unless 
a 
course 
of 
study 
such 
as 
this 
is 
undertaken 
many 
critics 
may 
think 
various 
statements 
and 
inferences 
in 
this 
volume 
to 
be 
far 
fetched 
or 
find 
them 
too 
obscure 
for 
comprehension. 
The 
other 
point 
is 
the 
following: 
One 
frequently 
hears 
the 
psychoanalytic 
method 
referred 
to 
as 
if 
it 
was 
customary 
for 
those 
practicing 
it 
to 
exploit 
the 
sexual 
experiences 
of 
their 
patients 
and 
nothing 
more, 
and 
the 
insistence 
on 
the 
details 
of 
the 
sexual 
life, 
presented 
in 
this 
book, 
is 
likely 
to 
emphasize 
that 
notion. 
But 
the 
fact 
is, 
as 
every 
thoughtful 
inquirer 
is 
aware, 
that 
the 
whole 
progress 
of 
civilization, 
whether 
in 
the 
individual 
or 
the 
race, 
consists 
largely 
in 
a 
"sublimation" 
of 
infantile 
instincts, 
and 
especially 
certain 
portions 
of 
the 
sexual 
instinct, 
to 
other 
ends 
than 
those 
which 
they 
seemed 
designed 
to 
serve. 
Art 
and 
poetry 
are 
fed 
on 
this 
fuel 
and 
the 
evolution 
of 
character 
and 
mental 
force 
is 
largely 
of 
the 
same 
origin. 
All 
the 
forms 
which 
this 
sublimation, 
or 
the 
abortive 
attempts 
at 
sublimation, 
may 
take 
in 
any 
given 
case, 
should 
come 
out 
in 
the 
course 
of 
a 
thorough 
psychoanalysis. 
It 
is 
not 
the 
sexual 
life 
alone, 
but 
every 
interest 
and 
every 
motive, 
that 
must 
be 
inquired 
into 
by 
the 
physician 
who 
is 
seeking 
to 
obtain 
all 
the 
data 
about 
the 
patient, 
necessary 
for 
his 
reeducation 
and 
his 
cure. 
But 
all 
the 
thoughts 
and 
emotions 
and 
desires 
and 
motives 
which 
appear 
in 
the 
man 
or 
woman 
of 
adult 
years 
were 
once 
crudely 
represented 
in 
the 
obscure 
instincts 
of 
the 
infant, 
and 
among 
these 
instincts 
those 
which 
were 
concerned 
directly 
or 
indirectly 
with 
the 
sexual 
emotions, 
in 
a 
wide 
sense, 
are 
certain 
to 
be 
found 
in 
every 
case 
to 
have 
been 
the 
most 
important 
for 
the 
end-result.

AUTHOR'S 
PREFACE 
TO 
THE 
SECOND 
EDITION 
Although 
the 
author 
is 
fully 
aware 
of 
the 
gaps 
and 
obscurities 
contained 
in 
this 
small 
volume, 
he 
has, 
nevertheless, 
resisted 
a 
temptation 
to 
add 
to 
it 
the 
results 
obtained 
from 
the 
investigations 
of 
the 
last 
five 
years, 
fearing 
that 
thus 
its 
unified 
and 
documentary 
character 
would 
be 
destroyed. 
He 
accordingly 
reproduces 
the 
original 
text 
with 
but 
slight 
modifications, 
contenting 
himself 
with 
the 
addition 
of 
a 
few 
footnotes. 
For 
the 
rest, 
it 
is 
his 
ardent 
wish 
that 
this 
book 
may 
speedily 
become 
antiquated--to 
the 
end 
that 
the 
new 
material 
brought 
forward 
in 
it 
may 
be 
universally 
accepted, 
while 
the 
shortcomings 
it 
displays 
may 
give 
place 
to 
juster 
views.

AUTHOR'S 
PREFACE 
TO 
THE 
THIRD 
EDITION 
After 
watching 
for 
ten 
years 
the 
reception 
accorded 
to 
this 
book 
and 
the 
effect 
it 
has 
produced, 
I 
wish 
to 
provide 
the 
third 
edition 
of 
it 
with 
some 
prefatory 
remarks 
dealing 
with 
the 
misunderstandings 
of 
the 
book 
and 
the 
demands, 
insusceptible 
of 
fulfillment, 
made 
against 
it. 
Let 
me 
emphasize 
in 
the 
first 
place 
that 
whatever 
is 
here 
presented 
is 
derived 
entirely 
from 
everyday 
medical 
experience 
which 
is 
to 
be 
made 
more 
profound 
and 
scientifically 
important 
through 
the 
results 
of 
psychoanalytic 
investigation. 
The 
"Three 
Contributions 
to 
the 
Theory 
of 
Sex" 
can 
contain 
nothing 
except 
what 
psychoanalysis 
obliges 
them 
to 
accept 
or 
what 
it 
succeeds 
in 
corroborating. 
It 
is 
therefore 
excluded 
that 
they 
should 
ever 
be 
developed 
into 
a 
"theory 
of 
sex," 
and 
it 
is 
also 
quite 
intelligible 
that 
they 
will 
assume 
no 
attitude 
at 
all 
towards 
some 
important 
problems 
of 
the 
sexual 
life. 
This 
should 
not 
however 
give 
the 
impression 
that 
these 
omitted 
chapters 
of 
the 
great 
theme 
were 
unfamiliar 
to 
the 
author, 
or 
that 
they 
were 
neglected 
by 
him 
as 
something 
of 
secondary 
importance. 
The 
dependence 
of 
this 
work 
on 
the 
psychoanalytic 
experiences 
which 
have 
determined 
the 
writing 
of 
it, 
shows 
itself 
not 
only 
in 
the 
selection 
but 
also 
in 
the 
arrangement 
of 
the 
material. 
A 
certain 
succession 
of 
stages 
was 
observed, 
the 
occasional 
factors 
are 
rendered 
prominent, 
the 
constitutional 
ones 
are 
left 
in 
the 
background, 
and 
the 
ontogenetic 
development 
receives 
greater 
consideration 
than 
the 
phylogenetic. 
For 
the 
occasional 
factors 
play 
the 
principal 
rôle 
in 
analysis, 
and 
are 
almost 
completely 
worked 
up 
in 
it, 
while 
the 
constitutional 
factors 
only 
become 
evident 
from 
behind 
as 
elements 
which 
have 
been 
made 
functional 
through 
experience, 
and 
a 
discussion 
of 
these 
would 
lead 
far 
beyond 
the 
working 
sphere 
of 
psychoanalysis. 
A 
similar 
connection 
determines 
the 
relation 
between 
ontogenesis 
and 
phylogenesis. 
Ontogenesis 
may 
be 
considered 
as 
a 
repetition 
of 
phylogenesis 
insofar 
as 
the 
latter 
has 
not 
been 
varied 
by 
a 
more 
recent 
experience. 
The 
phylogenetic 
disposition 
makes 
itself 
visible 
behind 
the 
ontogenetic 
process. 
But 
fundamentally 
the 
constitution 
is 
really 
the 
precipitate 
of 
a 
former 
experience 
of 
the 
species 
to 
which 
the 
newer 
experience 
of 
the 
individual 
being 
is 
added 
as 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
occasional 
factors. 
Beside 
its 
thoroughgoing 
dependence 
on 
psychoanalytic 
investigation 
I 
must 
emphasize 
as 
a 
character 
of 
this 
work 
of 
mine 
its 
intentional 
independence 
of 
biological 
investigation. 
I 
have 
carefully 
avoided 
the 
inclusion 
of 
the 
results 
of 
scientific 
investigation 
in 
general 
sex 
biology 
or 
of 
particular 
species 
of 



animals 
in 
this 
study 
of 
human 
sexual 
functions 
which 
is 
made 
possible 
by 
the 
technique 
of 
psychoanalysis. 
My 
aim 
was 
indeed 
to 
find 
out 
how 
much 
of 
the 
biology 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
of 
man 
can 
be 
discovered 
by 
means 
of 
psychological 
investigation; 
I 
was 
able 
to 
point 
to 
additions 
and 
agreements 
which 
resulted 
from 
this 
examination, 
but 
I 
did 
not 
have 
to 
become 
confused 
if 
the 
psychoanalytic 
methods 
led 
in 
some 
points 
to 
views 
and 
results 
which 
deviated 
considerably 
from 
those 
merely 
based 
on 
biology. 
I 
have 
added 
many 
passages

but 
I 
have 
abstained 
from 
calling 
attention 
to 
them, 
as 
in 
former 
editions, 
by 
special 
marks. 
The

at

been

some

remain

THE 
SEXUAL 
ABERRATIONS[1] 
The 
fact 
of 
sexual 
need 
in 
man 
and 
animal 
is 
expressed 
in 
biology 
by 
the 
assumption 
of 
a 
"sexual 
impulse." 
This 
impulse 
is 
made 
analogous 
to 
the 
impulse 
of 
taking 
nourishment, 
and 
to 
hunger. 
The 
sexual 
expression 
corresponding 
to 
hunger 
not 
being 
found 
colloquilly, 
science 
uses 
the 
expression 
"libido."[2] 
Popular 
conception 
makes 
definite 
assumptions 
concerning 
the 
nature 
and 
qualities 
of 
this 
sexual 
impulse. 
It 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
absent 
during 
childhood 
and 
to 
commence 
about 
the 
time 
of 
and 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
maturing 
process 
of 
puberty; 
it 
is 
supposed 
that 
it 
manifests 
itself 
in 
irresistible 
attractions 
exerted 
by 
one 
sex 
upon 
the 
other, 
and 
that 
its 
aim 
is 
sexual 
union 
or 
at 
least 
such 
actions 
as 
would 
lead 
to 
union. 
But 
we 
have 
every 
reason 
to 
see 
in 
these 
assumptions 
a 
very 
untrustworthy 
picture 
of 
reality. 
On 
closer 
examination 
they 
are 
found 
to 
abound 
in 
errors, 
inaccuracies 
and 
hasty 
conclusions. 
If 
we 
introduce 
two 
terms 
and 
call 
the 
person 
from 
whom 
the 
sexual 
attraction 
emanates 
the 
sexual 
object, 
and 
the 
action 
towards 
which 
the 
impulse 
strives 
the 
sexual 
aim, 
then 
the 
scientifically 
examined 
experience 
shows 
us 
many 
deviations 
in 
reference 
to 
both 
sexual 
object 
and 
sexual 
aim, 
the 
relations 
of 
which 
to 
the 
accepted 
standard 
require 
thorough 
investigation. 


1. 
DEVIATION 
IN 
REFERENCE 
TO 
THE 
SEXUAL 
OBJECT 
The 
popular 
theory 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
corresponds 
closely 
to 
the 
poetic 
fable 
of 
dividing 
the 
person 
into 
two 
halves--man 
and 
woman--who 
strive 
to 
become 
reunited 
through 
love. 
It 
is 
therefore 
very 
surprising 
to 
hear 
that 
there 
are 
men 
for 
whom 
the 
sexual 
object 
is 
not 
woman 
but 
man, 
and 
that 
there 
are 
women 
for 
whom 
it 
is 
not 
man 
but 
woman. 
Such 
persons 
are 
called 
contrary 
sexuals, 
or 
better, 
inverts; 
the 
condition, 
that 
of 
inversion. 
The 
number 
of 
such 
individuals 
is 
considerable 
though 
difficult 
of 
accurate 
determination.[3] 
A. 
Inversion 
*The 
Behavior 
of 
Inverts.*--The 
above-mentioned 
persons 
behave 
in 
many 
ways 
quite 
differently. 
(_a_) 
They 
are 
absolutely 
inverted; 
_i.e._, 
their 
sexual 
object 
must 
be 
always 
of 
the 
same 
sex, 
while 
the 
opposite 
sex 
can 
never 
be 
to 
them 
an 
object 
of 
sexual 
longing, 
but 
leaves 
them 
indifferent 
or 
may 
even 
evoke 
sexual 
repugnance. 
As 
men 
they 
are 
unable, 
on 
account 
of 
this 
repugnance, 
to 
perform 
the 
normal 
sexual 
act 
or 
miss 
all 
pleasure 
in 
its 
performance. 
(_b_) 
They 
are 
amphigenously 
inverted 
(psychosexually 
hermaphroditic); 

_i.e._, 
their 
sexual 
object 
may 
belong 
indifferently 
to 
either 
the 
same 
or 
to 
the 
other 
sex. 
The 
inversion 
lacks 
the 
character 
of 
exclusiveness. 
(_c_) 
They 
are 
occasionally 
inverted; 
_i.e._, 
under 
certain 
external 
conditions, 
chief 
among 
which 
are 
the 
inaccessibility 
of 
the 
normal 
sexual 
object 
and 
initiation, 
they 
are 
able 
to 
take 
as 
the 
sexual 
object 
a 
person 
of 
the 
same 
sex 
and 
thus 
find 
sexual 
gratification. 
The 
inverted 
also 
manifest 
a 
manifold 
behavior 
in 
their 
judgment 
about 
the 
peculiarities 
of 
their 
sexual 
impulse. 
Some 
take 
the 
inversion 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
course, 
just 
as 
the 
normal 
person 
does 
regarding 
his 
libido, 
firmly 
demanding 
the 
same 
rights 
as 
the 
normal. 
Others, 
however, 
strive 
against 
the 
fact 
of 
their 
inversion 
and 
perceive 
in 
it 
a 
morbid 
compulsion.[4] 
Other 
variations 
concern 
the 
relations 
of 
time. 
The 
characteristics 
of 
the 
inversion 
in 
any 
individual 
may 
date 
back 
as 
far 
as 
his 
memory 
goes, 
or 
they 
may 
become 
manifest 
to 
him 
at 
a 
definite 
period 
before 
or 
after 
puberty.[5] 
The 
character 
is 
either 
retained 
throughout 
life, 
or 
it 
occasionally 
recedes 
or 
represents 
an 
episode 
on 
the 
road 
to 
normal 
development. 
A 
periodical 
fluctuation 
between 
the 
normal 
and 
the 
inverted 
sexual 
object 
has 
also 
been 
observed. 
Of 
special 
interest 
are 
those 
cases 
in 
which 
the 
libido 
changes, 
taking 
on 
the 
character 
of 
inversion 
after 
a 
painful 
experience 
with 
the 
normal 
sexual 
object. 
These 
different 
categories 
of 
variation 
generally 
exist 
independently 
of 
one 
another. 
In 
the 
most 
extreme 
cases 
it 
can 
regularly 
be 
assumed 
that 
the 
inversion 
has 
existed 
at 
all 
times 
and 
that 
the 
person 
feels 
contented 
with 
his 
peculiar 
state. 
Many 
authors 
will 
hesitate 
to 
gather 
into 
a 
unit 
all 
the 
cases 
enumerated 
here 
and 
will 
prefer 
to 
emphasize 
the 
differences 
rather 
than 
the 
common 
characters 
of 
these 
groups, 
a 
view 
which 
corresponds 
with 
their 
preferred 
judgment 
of 
inversions. 
But 
no 
matter 
what 
divisions 
may 
be 
set 
up, 
it 
cannot 
be 
overlooked 
that 
all 
transitions 
are 
abundantly 
met 
with, 
so 
that 
the 
formation 
of 
a 
series 
would 
seem 
to 
impose 
itself. 
*Conception 
of 
Inversion.*--The 
first 
attention 
bestowed 
upon 
inversion 
gave 
rise 
to 
the 
conception 
that 
it 
was 
a 
congenital 
sign 
of 
nervous 
degeneration. 
This 
harmonized 
with 
the 
fact 
that 
doctors 
first 
met 
it 
among 
the 
nervous, 
or 
among 
persons 
giving 
such 
an 
impression. 
There 
are 
two 
elements 
which 
should 
be 
considered 
independently 
in 
this 
conception: 
the 
congenitality, 
and 
the 
degeneration. 
*Degeneration.*--This 
term 
degeneration 
is 
open 
to 
the 
objections 
which 



may 
be 
urged 
against 
the 
promiscuous 
use 
of 
this 
word 
in 
general. 
It 
has 
in 
fact 
become 
customary 
to 
designate 
all 
morbid 
manifestations 
not 
of 
traumatic 
or 
infectious 
origin 
as 
degenerative. 
Indeed, 
Magnan's 
classification 
of 
degenerates 
makes 
it 
possible 
that 
the 
highest 
general 
configuration 
of 
nervous 
accomplishment 
need 
not 
exclude 
the 
application 
of 
the 
concept 
of 
degeneration. 
Under 
the 
circumstances, 
it 
is 
a 
question 
what 
use 
and 
what 
new 
content 
the 
judgment 
of 
"degeneration" 
still 
possesses. 
It 
would 
seem 
more 
appropriate 
not 
to 
speak 
of 
degeneration: 
(1) 
Where 
there 
are 
not 
many 
marked 
deviations 
from 
the 
normal; 
(2) 
where 
the 
capacity 
for 
working 
and 
living 
do 
not 
in 
general 
appear 
markedly 
impaired.[6] 
That 
the 
inverted 
are 
not 
degenerates 
in 
this 
qualified 
sense 
can 
be 
seen 
from 
the 
following 
facts: 


1. 
The 
inversion 
is 
found 
among 
persons 
who 
otherwise 
show 
no 
marked 
deviation 
from 
the 
normal. 
2. 
It 
is 
found 
also 
among 
persons 
whose 
capabilities 
are 
not 
disturbed, 
who 
on 
the 
contrary 
are 
distinguished 
by 
especially 
high 
intellectual 
development 
and 
ethical 
culture.[7] 
3. 
If 
one 
disregards 
the 
patients 
of 
one's 
own 
practice 
and 
strives 
to 
comprehend 
a 
wider 
field 
of 
experience, 
he 
will 
in 
two 
directions 
encounter 
facts 
which 
will 
prevent 
him 
from 
assuming 
inversions 
as 
a 
degenerative 
sign. 
(_a_) 
It 
must 
be 
considered 
that 
inversion 
was 
a 
frequent 
manifestation 
among 
the 
ancient 
nations 
at 
the 
height 
of 
their 
culture. 
It 
was 
an 
institution 
endowed 
with 
important 
functions. 
(_b_) 
It 
is 
found 
to 
be 
unusually 
prevalent 
among 
savages 
and 
primitive 
races, 
whereas 
the 
term 
degeneration 
is 
generally 
limited 
to 
higher 
civilization 
(I. 
Bloch). 
Even 
among 
the 
most 
civilized 
nations 
of 
Europe, 
climate 
and 
race 
have 
a 
most 
powerful 
influence 
on 
the 
distribution 
of, 
and 
attitude 
toward, 
inversion.[8] 
*Innateness.*--Only 
for 
the 
first 
and 
most 
extreme 
class 
of 
inverts, 
as 
can 
be 
imagined, 
has 
innateness 
been 
claimed, 
and 
this 
from 
their 
own 
assurance 
that 
at 
no 
time 
in 
their 
life 
has 
their 
sexual 
impulse 
followed 
a 
different 
course. 
The 
fact 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
two 
other 
classes, 
especially 
of 
the 
third, 
is 
difficult 
to 
reconcile 
with 
the 
assumption 
of 
its 
being 
congenital. 
Hence, 
the 
propensity 
of 
those 
holding 
this 
view 
to 
separate 
the 
group 
of 
absolute 
inverts 
from 
the 
others 
results 
in 
the 
abandonment 
of 
the 
general 
conception 
of 
inversion. 
Accordingly 
in 
a 
number 
of 
cases 
the 
inversion 
would 
be 
of 
a 
congenital 
character, 
while 
in 
others 
it 
might 
originate 
from 
other 
causes. 

In 
contradistinction 
to 
this 
conception 
is 
that 
which 
assumes 
inversion 
to 
be 
an 
acquired 
character 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse. 
It 
is 
based 
on 
the 
following 
facts. 
(1) 
In 
many 
inverts 
(even 
absolute 
ones) 
an 
early 
affective 
sexual 
impression 
can 
be 
demonstrated, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
which 
the 
homosexual 
inclination 
developed. 
(2) 
In 
many 
others 
outer 
influences 
of 
a 
promoting 
and 
inhibiting 
nature 
can 
be 
demonstrated, 
which 
in 
earlier 
or 
later 
life 
led 
to 
a 
fixation 
of 
the 
inversion--among 
which 
are 
exclusive 
relations 
with 
the 
same 
sex, 
companionship 
in 
war, 
detention 
in 
prison, 
dangers 
of 
hetero-sexual 
intercourse, 
celibacy, 
sexual 
weakness, 
etc. 
(3) 
Hypnotic 
suggestion 
may 
remove 
the 
inversion, 
which 
would 
be 
surprising 
in 
that 
of 
a 
congenital 
character. 
In 
view 
of 
all 
this, 
the 
existence 
of 
congenital 
inversion 
can 
certainly 
be 
questioned. 
The 
objection 
may 
be 
made 
to 
it 
that 
a 
more 
accurate 
examination 
of 
those 
claimed 
to 
be 
congenitally 
inverted 
will 
probably 
show 
that 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
libido 
was 
determined 
by 
a 
definite 
experience 
of 
early 
childhood, 
which 
has 
not 
been 
retained 
in 
the 
conscious 
memory 
of 
the 
person, 
but 
which 
can 
be 
brought 
back 
to 
memory 
by 
proper 
influences 
(Havelock 
Ellis). 
According 
to 
that 
author 
inversion 
can 
be 
designated 
only 
as 
a 
frequent 
variation 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
which 
may 
be 
determined 
by 
a 
number 
of 
external 
circumstances 
of 
life. 
The 
apparent 
certainty 
thus 
reached 
is, 
however, 
overthrown 
by 
the 
retort 
that 
manifestly 
there 
are 
many 
persons 
who 
have 
experienced 
even 
in 
their 
early 
youth 
those 
very 
sexual 
influences, 
such 
as 
seduction, 
mutual 
onanism, 
without 
becoming 
inverts, 
or 
without 
constantly 
remaining 
so. 
Hence, 
one 
is 
forced 
to 
assume 
that 
the 
alternatives 
congenital 
and 
acquired 
are 
either 
incomplete 
or 
do 
not 
cover 
the 
circumstances 
present 
in 
inversions. 
*Explanation 
of 
Inversion.*--The 
nature 
of 
inversion 
is 
explained 
neither 
by 
the 
assumption 
that 
it 
is 
congenital 
nor 
that 
it 
is 
acquired. 
In 
the 
first 
case, 
we 
need 
to 
be 
told 
what 
there 
is 
in 
it 
of 
the 
congenital, 
unless 
we 
are 
satisfied 
with 
the 
roughest 
explanation, 
namely, 
that 
a 
person 
brings 
along 
a 
congenital 
sexual 
impulse 
connected 
with 
a 
definite 
sexual 
object. 
In 
the 
second 
case 
it 
is 
a 
question 
whether 
the 
manifold 
accidental 
influences 
suffice 
to 
explain 
the 
acquisition 
unless 
there 
is 
something 
in 
the 
individual 
to 
meet 
them 
half 
way. 
The 
negation 
of 
this 
last 
factor 
is 
inadmissible 
according 
to 
our 
former 
conclusions. 
*The 
Relation 
of 
Bisexuality.*--Since 
the 
time 
of 
Frank 
Lydston, 
Kiernan, 
and 
Chevalier, 
a 
new 
series 
of 
ideas 
has 
been 
introduced 
for 
the 
explanation 



of 
the 
possibility 
of 
sexual 
inversion. 
This 
contains 
a 
new 
contradiction 
to 
the 
popular 
belief 
which 
assumes 
that 
a 
human 
being 
is 
either 
a 
man 
or 
a 
woman. 
Science 
shows 
cases 
in 
which 
the 
sexual 
characteristics 
appear 
blurred 
and 
thus 
the 
sexual 
distinction 
is 
made 
difficult, 
especially 
on 
an 
anatomical 
basis. 
The 
genitals 
of 
such 
persons 
unite 
the 
male 
and 
female 
characteristics 
(hermaphroditism). 
In 
rare 
cases 
both 
parts 
of 
the 
sexual 
apparatus 
are 
well 
developed 
(true 
hermaphroditism), 
but 
usually 
both 
are 
stunted.[9] 
The 
importance 
of 
these 
abnormalities 
lies 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
unexpectedly 
facilitate 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
normal 
formation. 
A 
certain 
degree 
of 
anatomical 
hermaphroditism 
really 
belongs 
to 
the 
normal. 
In 
no 
normally 
formed 
male 
or 
female 
are 
traces 
of 
the 
apparatus 
of 
the 
other 
sex 
lacking; 
these 
either 
continue 
functionless 
as 
rudimentary 
organs, 
or 
they 
are 
transformed 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
assuming 
other 
functions. 
The 
conception 
which 
we 
gather 
from 
this 
long 
known 
anatomical 
fact 
is 
the 
original 
predisposition 
to 
bisexuality, 
which 
in 
the 
course 
of 
development 
has 
changed 
to 
monosexuality, 
leaving 
slight 
remnants 
of 
the 
stunted 
sex. 
It 
was 
natural 
to 
transfer 
this 
conception 
to 
the 
psychic 
sphere 
and 
to 
conceive 
the 
inversion 
in 
its 
aberrations 
as 
an 
expression 
of 
psychic 
hermaphroditism. 
In 
order 
to 
bring 
the 
question 
to 
a 
decision, 
it 
was 
only 
necessary 
to 
have 
one 
other 
circumstance, 
viz., 
a 
regular 
concurrence 
of 
the 
inversion 
with 
the 
psychic 
and 
somatic 
signs 
of 
hermaphroditism. 
But 
this 
second 
expectation 
was 
not 
realized. 
The 
relations 
between 
the 
assumed 
psychical 
and 
the 
demonstrable 
anatomical 
androgyny 
should 
never 
be 
conceived 
as 
being 
so 
close. 
There 
is 
frequently 
found 
in 
the 
inverted 
a 
diminution 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
(H. 
Ellis) 
and 
a 
slight 
anatomical 
stunting 
of 
the 
organs. 
This, 
however, 
is 
found 
frequently 
but 
by 
no 
means 
regularly 
or 
preponderately. 
Thus 
we 
must 
recognize 
that 
inversion 
and 
somatic 
hermaphroditism 
are 
totally 
independent 
of 
each 
other. 
Great 
importance 
has 
also 
been 
attached 
to 
the 
so-called 
secondary 
and 
tertiary 
sex 
characters 
and 
their 
aggregate 
occurrence 
in 
the 
inverted 
has 
been 
emphasized 
(H. 
Ellis). 
There 
is 
much 
truth 
in 
this 
but 
it 
should 
not 
be 
forgotten 
that 
the 
secondary 
and 
tertiary 
sex 
characteristics 
very 
frequently 
manifest 
themselves 
in 
the 
other 
sex, 
thus 
indicating 
androgyny 
without, 
however, 
involving 
changes 
in 
the 
sexual 
object 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
an 
inversion. 
Psychic 
hermaphroditism 
would 
gain 
in 
substantiality 
if 
parallel 
with 
the 
inversion 
of 
the 
sexual 
object 
there 
should 
be 
at 
least 
a 
change 
in 
the 
other 
psychic 
qualities, 
such 
as 
in 
the 
impulses 
and 
distinguishing 
traits 



characteristic 
of 
the 
other 
sex. 
But 
such 
inversion 
of 
character 
can 
be 
expected 
with 
some 
regularity 
only 
in 
inverted 
women; 
in 
men 
the 
most 
perfect 
psychic 
manliness 
may 
be 
united 
with 
the 
inversion. 
If 
one 
firmly 
adheres 
to 
the 
hypothesis 
of 
a 
psychic 
hermaphroditism, 
one 
must 
add 
that 
in 
certain 
spheres 
its 
manifestations 
allow 
the 
recognition 
of 
only 
a 
very 
slight 
contrary 
determination. 
The 
same 
also 
holds 
true 
in 
the 
somatic 
androgyny. 
According 
to 
Halban, 
the 
appearance 
of 
individual 
stunted 
organs 
and 
secondary 
sex 
characters 
are 
quite 
independent 
of 
each 
other.[10] 
A 
spokesman 
of 
the 
masculine 
inverts 
stated 
the 
bisexual 
theory 
in 
its 
crudest 
form 
in 
the 
following 
words: 
"It 
is 
a 
female 
brain 
in 
a 
male 
body." 
But 
we 
do 
not 
know 
the 
characteristics 
of 
a 
"female 
brain." 
The 
substitution 
of 
the 
anatomical 
for 
the 
psychological 
is 
as 
frivolous 
as 
it 
is 
unjustified. 
The 
tentative 
explanation 
by 
v. 
Krafft-Ebing 
seems 
to 
be 
more 
precisely 
formulated 
than 
that 
of 
Ulrich 
but 
does 
not 
essentially 
differ 
from 
it. 
v. 
Krafft-Ebing 
thinks 
that 
the 
bisexual 
predisposition 
gives 
to 
the 
individual 
male 
and 
female 
brain 
centers 
as 
well 
as 
somatic 
sexual 
organs. 
These 
centers 
develop 
first 
towards 
puberty 
mostly 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
independent 
sex 
glands. 
We 
can, 
however, 
say 
the 
same 
of 
the 
male 
and 
female 
"centers" 
as 
of 
the 
male 
and 
female 
brains; 
and, 
moreover, 
we 
do 
not 
even 
know 
whether 
we 
can 
assume 
for 
the 
sexual 
functions 
separate 
brain 
locations 
("centers") 
such 
as 
we 
may 
assume 
for 
language. 
After 
this 
discussion, 
two 
notions, 
at 
all 
events, 
persist; 
first, 
that 
a 
bisexual 
predisposition 
is 
to 
be 
presumed 
for 
the 
inversion 
also, 
only 
we 
do 
not 
know 
of 
what 
it 
consists 
beyond 
the 
anatomical 
formations; 
and, 
second, 
that 
we 
are 
dealing 
with 
disturbances 
which 
are 
experienced 
by 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
during 
its 
development.[11] 
*The 
Sexual 
Object 
of 
Inverts.*--The 
theory 
of 
psychic 
hermaphroditism 
presupposed 
that 
the 
sexual 
object 
of 
the 
inverted 
is 
the 
reverse 
of 
the 
normal. 
The 
inverted 
man, 
like 
the 
woman, 
succumbs 
to 
the 
charms 
emanating 
from 
manly 
qualities 
of 
body 
and 
mind; 
he 
feels 
himself 
like 
a 
woman 
and 
seeks 
a 
man. 
But 
however 
true 
this 
may 
be 
for 
a 
great 
number 
of 
inverts, 
it 
by 
no 
means 
indicates 
the 
general 
character 
of 
inversion. 
There 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
a 
great 
part 
of 
the 
male 
inverted 
have 
retained 
the 
psychic 
character 
of 
virility, 
that 
proportionately 
they 
show 
but 
little 
of 
the 
secondary 
characters 
of 
the 
other 
sex, 
and 
that 
they 
really 
look 
for 
real 
feminine 
psychic 
features 
in 
their 
sexual 
object. 
If 
that 
were 
not 
so 
it 
would 
be 
incomprehensible 
why 
masculine 



prostitution, 
in 
offering 
itself 
to 
inverts, 
copies 
in 
all 
its 
exterior, 
to-day 
as 
in 
antiquity, 
the 
dress 
and 
attitudes 
of 
woman. 
This 
imitation 
would 
otherwise 
be 
an 
insult 
to 
the 
ideal 
of 
the 
inverts. 
Among 
the 
Greeks, 
where 
the 
most 
manly 
men 
were 
found 
among 
inverts, 
it 
is 
quite 
obvious 
that 
it 
was 
not 
the 
masculine 
character 
of 
the 
boy 
which 
kindled 
the 
love 
of 
man, 
but 
it 
was 
his 
physical 
resemblance 
to 
woman 
as 
well 
as 
his 
feminine 
psychic 
qualities, 
such 
as 
shyness, 
demureness, 
and 
the 
need 
of 
instruction 
and 
help. 
As 
soon 
as 
the 
boy 
himself 
became 
a 
man 
he 
ceased 
to 
be 
a 
sexual 
object 
for 
men 
and 
in 
turn 
became 
a 
lover 
of 
boys. 
The 
sexual 
object 
in 
this 
case 
as 
in 
many 
others 
is 
therefore 
not 
of 
the 
like 
sex, 
but 
it 
unites 
both 
sex 
characters, 
a 
compromise 
between 
the 
impulses 
striving 
for 
the 
man 
and 
for 
the 
woman, 
but 
firmly 
conditioned 
by 
the 
masculinity 
of 
body 
(the 
genitals).[12] 
The 
conditions 
in 
the 
woman 
are 
more 
definite; 
here 
the 
active 
inverts, 
with 
special 
frequency, 
show 
the 
somatic 
and 
psychic 
characters 
of 
man 
and 
desire 
femininity 
in 
their 
sexual 
object; 
though 
even 
here 
greater 
variation 
will 
be 
found 
on 
more 
intimate 
investigation. 
*The 
Sexual 
Aim 
of 
Inverts.*--The 
important 
fact 
to 
bear 
in 
mind 
is 
that 
no 
uniformity 
of 
the 
sexual 
aim 
can 
be 
attributed 
to 
inversion. 
Intercourse 
per 
anum 
in 
men 
by 
no 
means 
goes 
with 
inversion; 
masturbation 
is 
just 
as 
frequently 
the 
exclusive 
aim; 
and 
the 
limitation 
of 
the 
sexual 
aim 
to 
mere 
effusion 
of 
feelings 
is 
here 
even 
more 
frequent 
than 
in 
hetero-sexual 
love. 
In 
women, 
too, 
the 
sexual 
aims 
of 
the 
inverted 
are 
manifold, 
among 
which 
contact 
with 
the 
mucous 
membrane 
of 
the 
mouth 
seems 
to 
be 
preferred. 
*Conclusion.*--Though 
from 
the 
material 
on 
hand 
we 
are 
by 
no 
means 
in 
a 
position 
satisfactorily 
to 
explain 
the 
origin 
of 
inversion, 
we 
can 
say 
that 
through 
this 
investigation 
we 
have 
obtained 
an 
insight 
which 
can 
become 
of 
greater 
significance 
to 
us 
than 
the 
solution 
of 
the 
above 
problem. 
Our 
attention 
is 
called 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
have 
assumed 
a 
too 
close 
connection 
between 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
and 
the 
sexual 
object. 
The 
experience 
gained 
from 
the 
so 
called 
abnormal 
cases 
teaches 
us 
that 
a 
connection 
exists 
between 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
and 
the 
sexual 
object 
which 
we 
are 
in 
danger 
of 
overlooking 
in 
the 
uniformity 
of 
normal 
states 
where 
the 
impulse 
seems 
to 
bring 
with 
it 
the 
object. 
We 
are 
thus 
instructed 
to 
separate 
this 
connection 
between 
the 
impulse 
and 
the 
object. 
The 
sexual 
impulse 
is 
probably 
entirely 
independent 
of 
its 
object 
and 
is 
not 
originated 
by 
the 
stimuli 
proceeding 
from 
the 
object. 


B. 
The 
Sexually 
Immature 
and 
Animals 
as 
Sexual 
Objects 
Whereas 
those 

sexual 
inverts 
whose 
sexual 
object 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
the 
normally 
adapted 
sex, 
appear 
to 
the 
observer 
as 
a 
collective 
number 
of 
perhaps 
otherwise 
normal 
individuals, 
the 
persons 
who 
choose 
for 
their 
sexual 
object 
the 
sexually 
immature 
(children) 
are 
apparently 
from 
the 
first 
sporadic 
aberrations. 
Only 
exceptionally 
are 
children 
the 
exclusive 
sexual 
objects. 
They 
are 
mostly 
drawn 
into 
this 
rôle 
by 
a 
faint-hearted 
and 
impotent 
individual 
who 
makes 
use 
of 
such 
substitutes, 
or 
when 
an 
impulsive 
urgent 
desire 
cannot 
at 
the 
time 
secure 
the 
proper 
object. 
Still 
it 
throws 
some 
light 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse, 
that 
it 
should 
suffer 
such 
great 
variation 
and 
depreciation 
of 
its 
object, 
a 
thing 
which 
hunger, 
adhering 
more 
energetically 
to 
its 
object, 
would 
allow 
only 
in 
the 
most 
extreme 
cases. 
The 
same 
may 
be 
said 
of 
sexual 
relations 
with 
animals--a 
thing 
not 
at 
all 
rare 
among 
farmers--where 
the 
sexual 
attraction 
goes 
beyond 
the 
limits 
of 
the 
species. 
For 
esthetic 
reasons 
one 
would 
fain 
attribute 
this 
and 
other 
excessive 
aberrations 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
to 
the 
insane, 
but 
this 
cannot 
be 
done. 
Experience 
teaches 
that 
among 
the 
latter 
no 
disturbances 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
can 
be 
found 
other 
than 
those 
observed 
among 
the 
sane, 
or 
among 
whole 
races 
and 
classes. 
Thus 
we 
find 
with 
gruesome 
frequency 
sexual 
abuse 
of 
children 
by 
teachers 
and 
servants 
merely 
because 
they 
have 
the 
best 
opportunities 
for 
it. 
The 
insane 
present 
the 
aforesaid 
aberration 
only 
in 
a 
somewhat 
intensified 
form; 
or 
what 
is 
of 
special 
significance 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
aberration 
becomes 
exclusive 
and 
takes 
the 
place 
of 
the 
normal 
sexual 
gratification. 
This 
very 
remarkable 
relation 
of 
sexual 
variations 
ranging 
from 
the 
normal 
to 
the 
insane 
gives 
material 
for 
reflection. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
the 
fact 
to 
be 
explained 
would 
show 
that 
the 
impulses 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
belong 
to 
those 
which 
even 
normally 
are 
most 
poorly 
controlled 
by 
the 
higher 
psychic 
activities. 
He 
who 
is 
in 
any 
way 
psychically 
abnormal, 
be 
it 
in 
social 
or 
ethical 
conditions, 
is, 
according 
to 
my 
experience, 
regularly 
so 
in 
his 
sexual 
life. 
But 
many 
are 
abnormal 
in 
their 
sexual 
life 
who 
in 
every 
other 
respect 
correspond 
to 
the 
average; 
they 
have 
followed 
the 
human 
cultural 
development, 
but 
sexuality 
remained 
as 
their 
weak 
point. 
As 
a 
general 
result 
of 
these 
discussions 
we 
come 
to 
see 
that, 
under 
numerous 
conditions 
and 
among 
a 
surprising 
number 
of 
individuals, 
the 
nature 
and 
value 
of 
the 
sexual 
object 
steps 
into 
the 
background. 
There 
is 
something 
else 
in 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
which 
is 
the 
essential 
and 
constant.[13] 



2. 
DEVIATION 
IN 
REFERENCE 
TO 
THE 
SEXUAL 
AIM 
The 
union 
of 
the 
genitals 
in 
the 
characteristic 
act 
of 
copulation 
is 
taken 
as 
the 
normal 
sexual 
aim. 
It 
serves 
to 
loosen 
the 
sexual 
tension 
and 
temporarily 
to 
quench 
the 
sexual 
desire 
(gratification 
analogous 
to 
satisfaction 
of 
hunger). 
Yet 
even 
in 
the 
most 
normal 
sexual 
process 
those 
additions 
are 
distinguishable, 
the 
development 
of 
which 
leads 
to 
the 
aberrations 
described 
as 
perversions. 
Thus 
certain 
intermediary 
relations 
to 
the 
sexual 
object 
connected 
with 
copulation, 
such 
as 
touching 
and 
looking, 
are 
recognized 
as 
preliminary 
to 
the 
sexual 
aim. 
These 
activities 
are 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
themselves 
connected 
with 
pleasure 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
they 
enhance 
the 
excitement 
which 
persists 
until 
the 
definite 
sexual 
aim 
is 
reached. 
One 
definite 
kind 
of 
contiguity, 
consisting 
of 
mutual 
approximation 
of 
the 
mucous 
membranes 
of 
the 
lips 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
kiss, 
has 
received 
among 
the 
most 
civilized 
nations 
a 
sexual 
value, 
though 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
body 
concerned 
do 
not 
belong 
to 
the 
sexual 
apparatus 
but 
form 
the 
entrance 
to 
the 
digestive 
tract. 
This 
therefore 
supplies 
the 
factors 
which 
allow 
us 
to 
bring 
the 
perversions 
into 
relation 
with 
the 
normal 
sexual 
life, 
and 
which 
are 
available 
also 
for 
their 
classification. 
The 
perversions 
are 
either 
(_a_) 
anatomical 
transgressions 
of 
the 
bodily 
regions 
destined 
for 
sexual 
union, 
or 
(_b_) 
a 
lingering 
at 
the 
intermediary 
relations 
to 
the 
sexual 
object 
which 
should 
normally 
be 
rapidly 
passed 
on 
the 
way 
to 
the 
definite 
sexual 
aim. 
(_a_) 
Anatomical 
Transgression 
*Overestimation 
of 
the 
Sexual 
Object.*-The 
psychic 
estimation 
in 
which 
the 
sexual 
object 
as 
a 
goal 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
shares 
is 
only 
in 
the 
rarest 
cases 
limited 
to 
the 
genitals; 
generally 
it 
embraces 
the 
whole 
body 
and 
tends 
to 
include 
all 
sensations 
emanating 
from 
the 
sexual 
object. 
The 
same 
overestimation 
spreads 
over 
the 
psychic 
sphere 
and 
manifests 
itself 
as 
a 
logical 
blinding 
(diminished 
judgment) 
in 
the 
face 
of 
the 
psychic 
attainments 
and 
perfections 
of 
the 
sexual 
object, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
blind 
obedience 
to 
the 
judgments 
issuing 
from 
the 
latter. 
The 
full 
faith 
of 
love 
thus 
becomes 
an 
important, 
if 
not 
the 
primordial 
source 
of 
authority.[14] 
It 
is 
this 
sexual 
overvaluation, 
which 
so 
ill 
agrees 
with 
the 
restriction 
of 
the 
sexual 
aim 
to 
the 
union 
of 
the 
genitals 
only, 
that 
assists 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
body 
to 
participate 
as 
sexual 
aims.[15] 
In 
the 
development 
of 
this 
most 
manifold 
anatomical 
overestimation 
there 
is 
an 
unmistakable 
desire 
towards 
variation, 
a 
thing 
denominated 
by 
Hoche 
as 
"excitement-hunger" 
(Reizhunger).[

significance 
of 
the 
factor 
of 
sexual 
overestimation 
can 
be 
best 
studied 
in 
the 
man, 
in 
whom 
alone 
the 
sexual 
life 
is 
accessible 
to 
investigation, 
whereas 
in 
the 
woman 
it 
is 
veiled 
in 
impenetrable 
darkness, 
partly 
in 
consequence 
of 
cultural 
stunting 
and 
partly 
on 
account 
of 
the 
conventional 
reticence 
and 
dishonesty 
of 
women. 
The 
employment 
of 
the 
mouth 
as 
a 
sexual 
organ 
is 
considered 
as 
a 
perversion 
if 
the 
lips 
(tongue) 
of 
the 
one 
are 
brought 
into 
contact 
with 
the 
genitals 
of 
the 
other, 
but 
not 
when 
the 
mucous 
membrane 
of 
the 
lips 
of 
both 
touch 
each 
other. 
In 
the 
latter 
exception 
we 
find 
the 
connection 
with 
the 
normal. 
He 
who 
abhors 
the 
former 
as 
perversions, 
though 
these 
since 
antiquity 
have 
been 
common 
practices 
among 
mankind, 
yields 
to 
a 
distinct 
feeling 
of 
loathing 
which 
protects 
him 
from 
adopting 
such 
sexual 
aims. 
The 
limit 
of 
such 
loathing 
is 
frequently 
purely 
conventional; 
he 
who 
kisses 
fervently 
the 
lips 
of 
a 
pretty 
girl 
will 
perhaps 
be 
able 
to 
use 
her 
tooth 
brush 
only 
with 
a 
sense 
of 
loathing, 
though 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
to 
assume 
that 
his 
own 
oral 
cavity 
for 
which 
he 
entertains 
no 
loathing 
is 
cleaner 
than 
that 
of 
the 
girl. 
Our 
attention 
is 
here 
called 
to 
the 
factor 
of 
loathing 
which 
stands 
in 
the 
way 
of 
the 
libidinous 
overestimation 
of 
the 
sexual 
aim, 
but 
which 
may 
in 
turn 
be 
vanquished 
by 
the 
libido. 
In 
the 
loathing 
we 
may 
observe 
one 
of 
the 
forces 
which 
have 
brought 
about 
the 
restrictions 
of 
the 
sexual 
aim. 
As 
a 
rule 
these 
forces 
halt 
at 
the 
genitals; 
there 
is, 
however, 
no 
doubt 
that 
even 
the 
genitals 
of 
the 
other 
sex 
themselves 
may 
be 
an 
object 
of 
loathing. 
Such 
behavior 
is 
characteristic 
of 
all 
hysterics, 
especially 
women. 
The 
force 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
prefers 
to 
occupy 
itself 
with 
the 
overcoming 
of 
this 
loathing 
(see 
below). 
*Sexual 
Utilization 
of 
the 
Anal 
Opening.*--It 
is 
even 
more 
obvious 
than 
in 
the 
former 
case 
that 
it 
is 
the 
loathing 
which 
stamps 
as 
a 
perversion 
the 
use 
of 
the 
anus 
as 
a 
sexual 
aim. 
But 
it 
should 
not 
be 
interpreted 
as 
espousing 
a 
cause 
when 
I 
observe 
that 
the 
basis 
of 
this 
loathing--namely, 
that 
this 
part 
of 
the 
body 
serves 
for 
the 
excretion 
and 
comes 
in 
contact 
with 
the 
loathsome 
excrement--is 
not 
more 
plausible 
than 
the 
basis 
which 
hysterical 
girls 
have 
for 
the 
disgust 
which 
they 
entertain 
for 
the 
male 
genital 
because 
it 
serves 
for 
urination. 
The 
sexual 
rôle 
of 
the 
mucous 
membrane 
of 
the 
anus 
is 
by 
no 
means 
limited 
to 
intercourse 
between 
men; 
its 
preference 
has 
nothing 
characteristic 
of 
the 
inverted 
feeling. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
it 
seems 
that 
the 
pedicatio 
of 
the 
man 
owes 
its 
rôle 
to 
the 
analogy 
with 
the 
act 
in 
the 
woman, 
whereas 
among 
inverts 
it 
is 



mutual 
masturbation 
which 
is 
the 
most 
common 
sexual 
aim. 
*The 
Significance 
of 
Other 
Parts 
of 
the 
Body.*--Sexual 
infringement 
on 
the 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
body, 
in 
all 
its 
variations, 
offers 
nothing 
new; 
it 
adds 
nothing 
to 
our 
knowledge 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
which 
herein 
only 
announces 
its 
intention 
to 
dominate 
the 
sexual 
object 
in 
every 
way. 
Besides 
the 
sexual 
overvaluation, 
a 
second 
and 
generally 
unknown 
factor 
may 
be 
mentioned 
among 
the 
anatomical 
transgressions. 
Certain 
parts 
of 
the 
body, 
like 
the 
mucous 
membrane 
of 
the 
mouth 
and 
anus, 
which 
repeatedly 
appear 
in 
such 
practices, 
lay 
claim 
as 
it 
were 
to 
be 
considered 
and 
treated 
as 
genitals. 
We 
shall 
hear 
how 
this 
claim 
is 
justified 
by 
the 
development 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse, 
and 
how 
it 
is 
fulfilled 
in 
the 
symptomatology 
of 
certain 
morbid 
conditions. 
*Unfit 
Substitutes 
for 
the 
Sexual 
Object. 
Fetichism.*--We 
are 
especially 
impressed 
by 
those 
cases 
in 
which 
for 
the 
normal 
sexual 
object 
another 
is 
substituted 
which 
is 
related 
to 
it 
but 
which 
is 
totally 
unfit 
for 
the 
normal 
sexual 
aim. 
According 
to 
the 
scheme 
of 
the 
introduction 
we 
should 
have 
done 
better 
to 
mention 
this 
most 
interesting 
group 
of 
aberrations 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
among 
the 
deviations 
in 
reference 
to 
the 
sexual 
object, 
but 
we 
have 
deferred 
mention 
of 
these 
until 
we 
became 
acquainted 
with 
the 
factor 
of 
sexual 
overestimation, 
upon 
which 
these 
manifestations, 
connected 
with 
the 
relinquishing 
of 
the 
sexual 
aim, 
depend. 
The 
substitute 
for 
the 
sexual 
object 
is 
generally 
a 
part 
of 
the 
body 
but 
little 
adapted 
for 
sexual 
purposes, 
such 
as 
the 
foot, 
or 
hair, 
or 
an 
inanimate 
object 
which 
is 
in 
demonstrable 
relation 
with 
the 
sexual 
person, 
and 
preferably 
with 
the 
sexuality 
of 
the 
same 
(fragments 
of 
clothing, 
white 
underwear). 
This 
substitution 
is 
not 
unjustly 
compared 
with 
the 
fetich 
in 
which 
the 
savage 
sees 
the 
embodiment 
of 
his 
god. 
The 
transition 
to 
the 
cases 
of 
fetichism, 
with 
a 
renunciation 
of 
a 
normal 
or 
of 
a 
perverted 
sexual 
aim, 
is 
formed 
by 
cases 
in 
which 
a 
fetichistic 
determination 
is 
demanded 
in 
the 
sexual 
object 
if 
the 
sexual 
aim 
is 
to 
be 
attained 
(definite 
color 
of 
hair, 
clothing, 
even 
physical 
blemishes). 
No 
other 
variation 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
verging 
on 
the 
pathological 
claims 
our 
interest 
as 
much 
as 
this 
one, 
owing 
to 
the 
peculiarity 
occasioned 
by 
its 
manifestations. 
A 
certain 
diminution 
in 
the 
striving 
for 
the 
normal 
sexual 
aim 
may 
be 
presupposed 
in 
all 
these 
cases 
(executive 
weakness 
of 
the 
sexual 
apparatus).[17] 
The 
connection 
with 
the 
normal 
is 
occasioned 
by 
the 
psychologically 
necessary 
overestimation 
of 
the 
sexual 
object, 
which 



inevitably 
encroaches 
upon 
everything 
associatively 
related 
to 
it 
(sexual 
object). 
A 
certain 
degree 
of 
such 
fetichism 
therefore 
regularly 
belong 
to 
the 
normal, 
especially 
during 
those 
stages 
of 
wooing 
when 
the 
normal 
sexual 
aim 
seems 
inaccessible 
or 
its 
realization 
deferred. 
"Get 
me 
a 
handkerchief 
from 
her 
bosom--a 
garter 
of 
my 
love." 
--FAUST. 
The 
case 
becomes 
pathological 
only 
when 
the 
striving 
for 
the 
fetich 
fixes 
itself 
beyond 
such 
determinations 
and 
takes 
the 
place 
of 
the 
normal 
sexual 
aim; 
or 
again, 
when 
the 
fetich 
disengages 
itself 
from 
the 
person 
concerned 
and 
itself 
becomes 
a 
sexual 
object. 
These 
are 
the 
general 
determinations 
for 
the 
transition 
of 
mere 
variations 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
into 
pathological 
aberrations. 
The 
persistent 
influence 
of 
a 
sexual 
impress 
mostly 
received 
in 
early 
childhood 
often 
shows 
itself 
in 
the 
selection 
of 
a 
fetich, 
as 
Binet 
first 
asserted, 
and 
as 
was 
later 
proven 
by 
many 
illustrations,--a 
thing 
which 
may 
be 
placed 
parallel 
to 
the 
proverbial 
attachment 
to 
a 
first 
love 
in 
the 
normal 
("On 
revient 
toujours 
à 
ses 
premiers 
amours"). 
Such 
a 
connection 
is 
especially 
seen 
in 
cases 
with 
only 
fetichistic 
determinations 
of 
the 
sexual 
object. 
The 
significance 
of 
early 
sexual 
impressions 
will 
be 
met 
again 
in 
other 
places. 
In 
other 
cases 
it 
was 
mostly 
a 
symbolic 
thought 
association, 
unconscious 
to 
the 
person 
concerned, 
which 
led 
to 
the 
replacing 
of 
the 
object 
by 
means 
of 
a 
fetich. 
The 
paths 
of 
these 
connections 
can 
not 
always 
be 
definitely 
demonstrated. 
The 
foot 
is 
a 
very 
primitive 
sexual 
symbol 
already 
found 
in 
myths.[18] 
Fur 
is 
used 
as 
a 
fetich 
probably 
on 
account 
of 
its 
association 
with 
the 
hairiness 
of 
the 
mons 
veneris. 
Such 
symbolism 
seems 
often 
to 
depend 
on 
sexual 
experiences 
in 
childhood.[19] 
(_b_) 
Fixation 
of 
Precursory 
Sexual 
Aims 
*The 
Appearance 
of 
New 
Intentions.*--All 
the 
outer 
and 
inner 
determinations 
which 
impede 
or 
hold 
at 
a 
distance 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
normal 
sexual 
aim, 
such 
as 
impotence, 
costliness 
of 
the 
sexual 
object, 
and 
dangers 
of 
the 
sexual 
act, 
will 
conceivably 
strengthen 
the 
inclination 
to 
linger 
at 
the 
preparatory 
acts 
and 
to 
form 
them 
into 
new 
sexual 
aims 
which 
may 
take 
the 
place 
of 
the 
normal. 
On 
closer 
investigation 
it 
is 
always 
seen 
that 
the 
ostensibly 
most 
peculiar 
of 
these 
new 
intentions 
have 
already 
been 
indicated 
in 
the 
normal 
sexual 
act. 
*Touching 
and 
Looking.*--At 
least 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
touching 
is 
indispensable 
for 
a 
person 
in 
order 
to 
attain 
the 
normal 
sexual 
aim. 
It 
is 
also 
generally 
known 
that 
the 
touching 
of 
the 
skin 
of 
the 
sexual 
object 
causes 



much 
pleasure 
and 
produces 
a 
supply 
of 
new 
excitement. 
Hence, 
the 
lingering 
at 
the 
touching 
can 
hardly 
be 
considered 
a 
perversion 
if 
the 
sexual 
act 
is 
proceeded 
with. 
The 
same 
holds 
true 
in 
the 
end 
with 
looking 
which 
is 
analogous 
to 
touching. 
The 
manner 
in 
which 
the 
libidinous 
excitement 
is 
frequently 
awakened 
is 
by 
the 
optical 
impression, 
and 
selection 
takes 
account 
of 
this 
circumstance--if 
this 
teleological 
mode 
of 
thinking 
be 
permitted--by 
making 
the 
sexual 
object 
a 
thing 
of 
beauty. 
The 
covering 
of 
the 
body, 
which 
keeps 
abreast 
with 
civilization, 
serves 
to 
arouse 
sexual 
inquisitiveness, 
which 
always 
strives 
to 
restore 
for 
itself 
the 
sexual 
object 
by 
uncovering 
the 
hidden 
parts. 
This 
can 
be 
turned 
into 
the 
artistic 
("sublimation") 
if 
the 
interest 
is 
turned 
from 
the 
genitals 
to 
the 
form 
of 
the 
body.[20] 
The 
tendency 
to 
linger 
at 
this 
intermediary 
sexual 
aim 
of 
the 
sexually 
accentuated 
looking 
is 
found 
to 
a 
certain 
degree 
in 
most 
normals; 
indeed 
it 
gives 
them 
the 
possibility 
of 
directing 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
their 
libido 
to 
a 
higher 
artistic 
aim. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
fondness 
for 
looking 
becomes 
a 
perversion 
(_a_) 
when 
it 
limits 
itself 
entirely 
to 
the 
genitals; 
(_b_) 
when 
it 
becomes 
connected 
with 
the 
overcoming 
of 
loathing 
(voyeurs 
and 
onlookers 
at 
the 
functions 
of 
excretion); 
and 
(_c_) 
when 
instead 
of 
preparing 
for 
the 
normal 
sexual 
aim 
it 
suppresses 
it. 
The 
latter, 
if 
I 
may 
draw 
conclusions 
from 
a 
single 
analysis, 
is 
in 
a 
most 
pronounced 
way 
true 
of 
exhibitionists, 
who 
expose 
their 
genitals 
so 
as 
in 
turn 
to 
bring 
to 
view 
the 
genitals 
of 
others. 
In 
the 
perversion 
which 
consists 
in 
striving 
to 
look 
and 
be 
looked 
at 
we 
are 
confronted 
with 
a 
very 
remarkable 
character 
which 
will 
occupy 
us 
even 
more 
intensively 
in 
the 
following 
aberration. 
The 
sexual 
aim 
is 
here 
present 
in 
twofold 
formation, 
in 
an 
active 
and 
a 
passive 
form. 
The 
force 
which 
is 
opposed 
to 
the 
peeping 
mania 
and 
through 
which 
it 
is 
eventually 
abolished 
is 
shame 
(like 
the 
former 
loathing). 
*Sadism 
and 
Masochism.*--The 
desire 
to 
cause 
pain 
to 
the 
sexual 
object 
and 
its 
opposite, 
the 
most 
frequent 
and 
most 
significant 
of 
all 
perversions, 
was 
designated 
in 
its 
two 
forms 
by 
v. 
Krafft-Ebing 
as 
sadism 
or 
the 
active 
form, 
and 
masochism 
or 
the 
passive 
form. 
Other 
authors 
prefer 
the 
narrower 
term 
algolagnia 
which 
emphasizes 
the 
pleasure 
in 
pain 
and 
cruelty, 
whereas 
the 
terms 
selected 
by 
v. 
Krafft-Ebing 
place 
the 
pleasure 
secured 
in 
all 
kinds 
of 
humility 
and 
submission 
in 
the 
foreground. 
The 
roots 
of 
active 
algolagnia, 
sadism, 
can 
be 
readily 
demonstrable 
in 
the 
normal. 
The 
sexuality 
of 
most 
men 
shows 
a 
taint 
of 
aggression, 
it 
is 
a 



propensity 
to 
subdue, 
the 
biological 
significance 
of 
which 
lies 
in 
the 
necessity 
of 
overcoming 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
sexual 
object 
by 
actions 
other 
than 
mere 
courting. 
Sadism 
would 
then 
correspond 
to 
an 
aggressive 
component 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
which 
has 
become 
independent 
and 
exaggerated 
and 
has 
been 
brought 
to 
the 
foreground 
by 
displacement. 
The 
conception 
of 
sadism 
fluctuates 
in 
the 
usage 
of 
language 
from 
a 
mere 
active 
or 
impetuous 
attitude 
towards 
the 
sexual 
object 
to 
the 
exclusive 
attachment 
of 
the 
gratification 
to 
the 
subjection 
and 
maltreatment 
of 
the 
object. 
Strictly 
speaking 
only 
the 
last 
extreme 
case 
has 
a 
claim 
to 
the 
name 
of 
perversion. 
Similarly, 
the 
designation 
of 
masochism 
comprises 
all 
passive 
attitude 
to 
the 
sexual 
life 
and 
to 
the 
sexual 
object; 
in 
its 
most 
extreme 
form 
the 
gratification 
is 
connected 
with 
suffering 
of 
physical 
or 
mental 
pain 
at 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
sexual 
object. 
Masochism 
as 
a 
perversion 
seems 
to 
be 
still 
more 
remote 
from 
the 
normal 
sexual 
life 
by 
forming 
a 
contrast 
to 
it; 
it 
may 
be 
doubted 
whether 
it 
ever 
appears 
as 
a 
primary 
form 
or 
whether 
it 
does 
not 
more 
regularly 
originate 
through 
transformation 
from 
sadism. 
It 
can 
often 
be 
recognized 
that 
the 
masochism 
is 
nothing 
but 
a 
continuation 
of 
the 
sadism 
turning 
against 
one's 
own 
person 
in 
which 
the 
latter 
at 
first 
takes 
the 
place 
of 
the 
sexual 
object. 
Analysis 
of 
extreme 
cases 
of 
masochistic 
perversions 
show 
that 
there 
is 
a 
coöperation 
of 
a 
large 
series 
of 
factors 
which 
exaggerate 
and 
fix 
the 
original 
passive 
sexual 
attitude 
(castration 
complex, 
conscience). 
The 
pain 
which 
is 
here 
overcome 
ranks 
with 
the 
loathing 
and 
shame 
which 
were 
the 
resistances 
opposed 
to 
the 
libido. 
Sadism 
and 
masochism 
occupy 
a 
special 
place 
among 
the 
perversions, 
for 
the 
contrast 
of 
activity 
and 
passivity 
lying 
at 
their 
bases 
belong 
to 
the 
common 
traits 
of 
the 
sexual 
life. 
That 
cruelty 
and 
sexual 
impulse 
are 
most 
intimately 
connected 
is 
beyond 
doubt 
taught 
by 
the 
history 
of 
civilization, 
but 
in 
the 
explanation 
of 
this 
connection 
no 
one 
has 
gone 
beyond 
the 
accentuation 
of 
the 
aggressive 
factors 
of 
the 
libido. 
The 
aggression 
which 
is 
mixed 
with 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
is 
according 
to 
some 
authors 
a 
remnant 
of 
cannibalistic 
lust, 
a 
participation 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
domination 
apparatus 
(Bemächtigungsapparatus), 
which 
served 
also 
for 
the 
gratification 
of 
the 
great 
wants 
of 
the 
other, 
ontogenetically 
the 
older 
impulse.[21] 
It 
has 
also 
been 
claimed 
that 
every 
pain 
contains 
in 
itself 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
pleasurable 
sensation. 
Let 
us 
be 
satisfied 
with 
the 
impression 
that 
the 
explanation 
of 
this 
perversion 
is 
by 
no 



means 
satisfactory 
and 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
many 
psychic 
efforts 
unite 
themselves 
into 
one 
effect. 
The 
most 
striking 
peculiarity 
of 
this 
perversion 
lies 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
its 
active 
and 
passive 
forms 
are 
regularly 
encountered 
together 
in 
the 
same 
person. 
He 
who 
experiences 
pleasure 
by 
causing 
pain 
to 
others 
in 
sexual 
relations 
is 
also 
able 
to 
experience 
the 
pain 
emanating 
from 
sexual 
relations 
as 
pleasure. 
A 
sadist 
is 
simultaneously 
a 
masochist, 
though 
either 
the 
active 
or 
the 
passive 
side 
of 
the 
perversion 
may 
be 
more 
strongly 
developed 
and 
thus 
represent 
his 
preponderate 
sexual 
activity.[22] 
We 
thus 
see 
that 
certain 
perverted 
propensities 
regularly 
appear 
in 
contrasting 
pairs, 
a 
thing 
which, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
material 
to 
be 
produced 
later, 
must 
claim 
great 
theoretical 
value. 
It 
is 
furthermore 
clear 
that 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
contrast, 
sadism 
and 
masochism, 
can 
not 
readily 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
mixture 
of 
aggression. 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
one 
may 
be 
tempted 
to 
connect 
such 
simultaneously 
existing 
contrasts 
with 
the 
united 
contrast 
of 
male 
and 
female 
in 
bisexuality, 
the 
significance 
of 
which 
is 
reduced 
in 
psychoanalysis 
to 
the 
contrast 
of 
activity 
and 
passivity. 


3. 
GENERAL 
STATEMENTS 
APPLICABLE 
TO 
ALL 
PERVERSIONS 
*Variation 
and 
Disease.*--The 
physicians 
who 
at 
first 
studied 
the 
perversions 
in 
pronounced 
cases 
and 
under 
peculiar 
conditions 
were 
naturally 
inclined 
to 
attribute 
to 
them 
the 
character 
of 
a 
morbid 
or 
degenerative 
sign 
similar 
to 
the 
inversions. 
This 
view, 
however, 
is 
easier 
to 
refute 
in 
this 
than 
in 
the 
former 
case. 
Everyday 
experience 
has 
shown 
that 
most 
of 
these 
transgressions, 
at 
least 
the 
milder 
ones, 
are 
seldom 
wanting 
as 
components 
in 
the 
sexual 
life 
of 
normals 
who 
look 
upon 
them 
as 
upon 
other 
intimacies. 
Wherever 
the 
conditions 
are 
favorable 
such 
a 
perversion 
may 
for 
a 
long 
time 
be 
substituted 
by 
a 
normal 
person 
for 
the 
normal 
sexual 
aim 
or 
it 
may 
be 
placed 
near 
it. 
In 
no 
normal 
person 
does 
the 
normal 
sexual 
aim 
lack 
some 
designable 
perverse 
element, 
and 
this 
universality 
suffices 
in 
itself 
to 
prove 
the 
inexpediency 
of 
an 
opprobrious 
application 
of 
the 
name 
perversion. 
In 
the 
realm 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
one 
is 
sure 
to 
meet 
with 
exceptional 
difficulties 
which 
are 
at 
present 
really 
unsolvable, 
if 
one 
wishes 
to 
draw 
a 
sharp 
line 
between 
the 
mere 
variations 
within 
physiological 
limits 
and 
morbid 
symptoms. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
new 
sexual 
aim 
in 
some 
of 
these 
perversions 
is 
such 
as 
to 
require 
special 
notice. 
Some 
of 
the 
perversions 
are 
in 
content 
so 
distant 
from 
the 
normal 
that 
we 
cannot 
help 
calling 
them 
"morbid," 
especially 
those 
in 
which 
the 
sexual 
impulse, 
in 
overcoming 
the 
resistances 
(shame, 

loathing, 
fear, 
and 
pain) 
has 
brought 
about 
surprising 
results 
(licking 
of 
feces 
and 
violation 
of 
cadavers). 
Yet 
even 
in 
these 
cases 
one 
ought 
not 
to 
feel 
certain 
of 
regularly 
finding 
among 
the 
perpetrators 
persons 
of 
pronounced 
abnormalities 
or 
insane 
minds. 
We 
can 
not 
lose 
sight 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
persons 
who 
otherwise 
behave 
normally 
are 
recorded 
as 
sick 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
where 
they 
are 
dominated 
by 
the 
most 
unbridled 
of 
all 
impulses. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
a 
manifest 
abnormality 
in 
any 
other 
relation 
in 
life 
generally 
shows 
an 
undercurrent 
of 
abnormal 
sexual 
behavior. 
In 
the 
majority 
of 
cases 
we 
are 
able 
to 
find 
the 
morbid 
character 
of 
the 
perversion 
not 
in 
the 
content 
of 
the 
new 
sexual 
aim 
but 
in 
its 
relation 
to 
the 
normal. 
It 
is 
morbid 
if 
the 
perversion 
does 
not 
appear 
beside 
the 
normal 
(sexual 
aim 
and 
sexual 
object), 
where 
favorable 
circumstances 
promote 
it 
and 
unfavorable 
impede 
the 
normal, 
or 
if 
it 
has 
under 
all 
circumstances 
repressed 
and 
supplanted 
the 
normal; 
the 
exclusiveness 
and 
fixation 
of 
the 
perversion 
justifies 
us 
in 
considering 
it 
a 
morbid 
symptom. 
*The 
Psychic 
Participation 
in 
the 
Perversions.*--Perhaps 
it 
is 
precisely 
in 
the 
most 
abominable 
perversions 
that 
we 
must 
recognize 
the 
most 
prolific 
psychic 
participation 
for 
the 
transformation 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse. 
In 
these 
cases 
a 
piece 
of 
psychic 
work 
has 
been 
accomplished 
in 
which, 
in 
spite 
of 
its 
gruesome 
success, 
the 
value 
of 
an 
idealization 
of 
the 
impulse 
can 
not 
be 
disputed. 
The 
omnipotence 
of 
love 
nowhere 
perhaps 
shows 
itself 
stronger 
than 
in 
this 
one 
of 
her 
aberrations. 
The 
highest 
and 
the 
lowest 
everywhere 
in 
sexuality 
hang 
most 
intimately 
together. 
("From 
heaven 
through 
the 
world 
to 
hell.") 
*Two 
Results.*--In 
the 
study 
of 
perversions 
we 
have 
gained 
an 
insight 
into 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
has 
to 
struggle 
against 
certain 
psychic 
forces, 
resistances, 
among 
which 
shame 
and 
loathing 
are 
most 
prominent. 
We 
may 
presume 
that 
these 
forces 
are 
employed 
to 
confine 
the 
impulse 
within 
the 
accepted 
normal 
limits, 
and 
if 
they 
have 
become 
developed 
in 
the 
individual 
before 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
has 
attained 
its 
full 
strength, 
it 
is 
really 
they 
which 
have 
directed 
it 
in 
the 
course 
of 
development.[23] 
We 
have 
furthermore 
remarked 
that 
some 
of 
the 
examined 
perversions 
can 
be 
comprehended 
only 
by 
assuming 
the 
union 
of 
many 
motives. 
If 
they 
are 
amenable 
to 
analysis--disintegration--they 
must 
be 
of 
a 
composite 
nature. 
This 
may 
give 
us 
a 
hint 
that 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
itself 
may 
not 
be 
something 
simple, 
that 
it 
may 
on 
the 
contrary 
be 
composed 
of 
many 
components 
which 
detach 
themselves 
to 
form 
perversions. 
Our 
clinical 
observation 
thus 
calls 
our 



attention 
to 
fusions 
which 
have 
lost 
their 
expression 
in 
the 
uniform 
normal 
behavior. 


4. 
THE 
SEXUAL 
IMPULSE 
IN 
NEUROTICS 
*Psychoanalysis.*--A 
proper 
contribution 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
in 
persons 
who 
are 
at 
least 
related 
to 
the 
normal 
can 
be 
gained 
only 
from 
one 
source, 
and 
is 
accessible 
only 
by 
one 
definite 
path. 
There 
is 
only 
one 
way 
to 
obtain 
a 
thorough 
and 
unerring 
solution 
of 
problems 
in 
the 
sexual 
life 
of 
so-called 
psychoneurotics 
(hysteria, 
obsessions, 
the 
wrongly-named 
neurasthenia, 
and 
surely 
also 
dementia 
præcox, 
and 
paranoia), 
and 
that 
is 
by 
subjecting 
them 
to 
the 
psychoanalytic 
investigations 
propounded 
by 
J. 
Breuer 
and 
myself 
in 
1893, 
which 
we 
called 
the 
"cathartic" 
treatment. 
I 
must 
repeat 
what 
I 
have 
said 
in 
my 
published 
work, 
that 
these 
psychoneuroses, 
as 
far 
as 
my 
experience 
goes, 
are 
based 
on 
sexual 
motive 
powers. 
I 
do 
not 
mean 
that 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
merely 
contributes 
to 
the 
forces 
supporting 
the 
morbid 
manifestations 
(symptoms), 
but 
I 
wish 
distinctly 
to 
maintain 
that 
this 
supplies 
the 
only 
constant 
and 
the 
most 
important 
source 
of 
energy 
in 
the 
neurosis, 
so 
that 
the 
sexual 
life 
of 
such 
persons 
manifests 
itself 
either 
exclusively, 
preponderately, 
or 
partially 
in 
these 
symptoms. 
As 
I 
have 
already 
stated 
in 
different 
places, 
the 
symptoms 
are 
the 
sexual 
activities 
of 
the 
patient. 
The 
proof 
for 
this 
assertion 
I 
have 
obtained 
from 
the 
psychoanalysis 
of 
hysterics 
and 
other 
neurotics 
during 
a 
period 
of 
twenty 
years, 
the 
results 
of 
which 
I 
hope 
to 
give 
later 
in 
a 
detailed 
account. 
Psychoanalysis 
removes 
the 
symptoms 
of 
hysteria 
on 
the 
supposition 
that 
they 
are 
the 
substitutes--the 
transcriptions 
as 
it 
were--for 
a 
series 
of 
emotionally 
accentuated 
psychic 
processes, 
wishes, 
and 
desires, 
to 
which 
a 
passage 
for 
their 
discharge 
through 
the 
conscious 
psychic 
activities 
has 
been 
cut 
off 
by 
a 
special 
process 
(repression). 
These 
thought 
formations 
which 
are 
restrained 
in 
the 
state 
of 
the 
unconscious 
strive 
for 
expression, 
that 
is, 
for 
discharge, 
in 
conformity 
to 
their 
affective 
value, 
and 
find 
such 
in 
hysteria 
through 
a 
process 
of 
conversion 
into 
somatic 
phenomena--the 
hysterical 
symptoms. 
If, 
lege 
artis, 
and 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
a 
special 
technique, 
retrogressive 
transformations 
of 
the 
symptoms 
into 
the 
affectful 
and 
conscious 
thoughts 
can 
be 
effected, 
it 
then 
becomes 
possible 
to 
get 
the 
most 
accurate 
information 
about 
the 
nature 
and 
origin 
of 
these 
previously 
unconscious 
psychic 
formations. 
*Results 
of 
Psychoanalysis.*--In 
this 
manner 
it 
has 
been 
discovered 
that 
the 

symptoms 
represent 
the 
equivalent 
for 
the 
strivings 
which 
received 
their 
strength 
from 
the 
source 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse. 
This 
fully 
concurs 
with 
what 
we 
know 
of 
the 
character 
of 
hysterics, 
which 
we 
have 
taken 
as 
models 
for 
all 
psycho-neurotics, 
before 
they 
have 
become 
diseased, 
and 
with 
what 
we 
know 
concerning 
the 
causes 
of 
the 
disease. 
The 
hysterical 
character 
evinces 
a 
part 
of 
sexual 
repression 
which 
reaches 
beyond 
the 
normal 
limits, 
an 
exaggeration 
of 
the 
resistances 
against 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
which 
we 
know 
as 
shame 
and 
loathing. 
It 
is 
an 
instinctive 
flight 
from 
intellectual 
occupation 
with 
the 
sexual 
problem, 
the 
consequence 
of 
which 
in 
pronounced 
cases 
is 
a 
complete 
sexual 
ignorance, 
which 
is 
preserved 
till 
the 
age 
of 
sexual 
maturity 
is 
attained.[24] 
This 
feature, 
so 
characteristic 
of 
hysteria, 
is 
not 
seldom 
concealed 
in 
crude 
observation 
by 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
second 
constitutional 
factor 
of 
hysteria, 
namely, 
the 
enormous 
development 
of 
the 
sexual 
craving. 
But 
the 
psychological 
analysis 
will 
always 
reveal 
it 
and 
solves 
the 
very 
contradictory 
enigma 
of 
hysteria 
by 
proving 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
contrasting 
pair, 
an 
immense 
sexual 
desire 
and 
a 
very 
exaggerated 
sexual 
rejection. 
The 
provocation 
of 
the 
disease 
in 
hysterically 
predisposed 
persons 
is 
brought 
about 
if 
in 
consequence 
of 
their 
progressive 
maturity 
or 
external 
conditions 
of 
life 
they 
are 
earnestly 
confronted 
with 
the 
real 
sexual 
demand. 
Between 
the 
pressure 
of 
the 
craving 
and 
the 
opposition 
of 
the 
sexual 
rejection 
an 
outlet 
for 
the 
disease 
results, 
which 
does 
not 
remove 
the 
conflict 
but 
seeks 
to 
elude 
it 
by 
transforming 
the 
libidinous 
strivings 
into 
symptoms. 
It 
is 
an 
exception 
only 
in 
appearance 
if 
a 
hysterical 
person, 
say 
a 
man, 
becomes 
subject 
to 
some 
banal 
emotional 
disturbance, 
to 
a 
conflict 
in 
the 
center 
of 
which 
there 
is 
no 
sexual 
interest. 
Psychoanalysis 
will 
regularly 
show 
that 
it 
is 
the 
sexual 
components 
of 
the 
conflict 
which 
make 
the 
disease 
possible 
by 
withdrawing 
the 
psychic 
processes 
from 
normal 
adjustment. 
*Neurosis 
and 
Perversion.*--A 
great 
part 
of 
the 
opposition 
to 
my 
assertion 
is 
explained 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
sexuality 
from 
which 
I 
deduce 
the 
psychoneurotic 
symptoms 
is 
thought 
of 
as 
coincident 
with 
the 
normal 
sexual 
impulse. 
But 
psychoanalysis 
teaches 
us 
better 
than 
this. 
It 
shows 
that 
the 
symptoms 
do 
not 
by 
any 
means 
result 
at 
the 
expense 
only 
of 
the 
so 
called 
normal 
sexual 
impulse 
(at 
least 
not 
exclusively 
or 
preponderately), 
but 
they 
represent 
the 
converted 
expression 
of 
impulses 
which 
in 
a 
broader 
sense 
might 
be 
designated 
as 
perverse 
if 
they 
could 
manifest 
themselves 
directly 
in 
phantasies 
and 
acts 
without 
deviating 
from 
consciousness. 
The 
symptoms 
are 
therefore 
partially 
formed 
at 
the 
cost 
of 
abnormal 
sexuality. 
_The 
neurosis 
is, 



so 
to 
say, 
the 
negative 
of 
the 
perversion._[25] 
The 
sexual 
impulse 
of 
the 
psychoneurotic 
shows 
all 
the 
aberrations 
which 
we 
have 
studied 
as 
variations 
of 
the 
normal 
and 
as 
manifestations 
of 
morbid 
sexual 
life. 
(_a_) 
In 
all 
the 
neurotics 
without 
exception 
we 
find 
feelings 
of 
inversion 
in 
the 
unconscious 
psychic 
life, 
fixation 
of 
libido 
on 
persons 
of 
the 
same 
sex. 
It 
is 
impossible, 
without 
a 
deep 
and 
searching 
discussion, 
adequately 
to 
appreciate 
the 
significance 
of 
this 
factor 
for 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
picture 
of 
the 
disease; 
I 
can 
only 
assert 
that 
the 
unconscious 
propensity 
to 
inversion 
is 
never 
wanting 
and 
is 
particularly 
of 
immense 
service 
in 
explaining 
male 
hysteria.[26] 
(_b_) 
All 
the 
inclinations 
to 
anatomical 
transgression 
can 
be 
demonstrated 
in 
psychoneurotics 
in 
the 
unconscious 
and 
as 
symptom-creators. 
Of 
special 
frequency 
and 
intensity 
are 
those 
which 
impart 
to 
the 
mouth 
and 
the 
mucous 
membrane 
of 
the 
anus 
the 
rôle 
of 
genitals. 
(_c_) 
The 
partial 
desires 
which 
usually 
appear 
in 
contrasting 
pairs 
play 
a 
very 
prominent 
rôle 
among 
the 
symptom-creators 
in 
the 
psychoneuroses. 
We 
have 
learned 
to 
know 
them 
as 
carriers 
of 
new 
sexual 
aims, 
such 
as 
peeping 
mania, 
exhibitionism, 
and 
the 
actively 
and 
passively 
formed 
impulses 
of 
cruelty. 
The 
contribution 
of 
the 
last 
is 
indispensable 
for 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
morbid 
nature 
of 
the 
symptoms; 
it 
almost 
regularly 
controls 
some 
portion 
of 
the 
social 
behavior 
of 
the 
patient. 
The 
transformation 
of 
love 
into 
hatred, 
of 
tenderness 
into 
hostility, 
which 
is 
characteristic 
of 
a 
large 
number 
of 
neurotic 
cases 
and 
apparently 
of 
all 
cases 
of 
paranoia, 
takes 
place 
by 
means 
of 
the 
union 
of 
cruelty 
with 
the 
libido. 
The 
interest 
in 
these 
deductions 
will 
be 
more 
heightened 
by 
certain 
peculiarities 
of 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
facts. 
Alpha. 
There 
is 
nothing 
in 
the 
unconscious 
streams 
of 
thought 
of 
the 
neuroses 
which 
would 
correspond 
to 
an 
inclination 
towards 
fetichism; 
a 
circumstance 
which 
throws 
light 
on 
the 
psychological 
peculiarity 
of 
this 
well 
understood 
perversion. 
Beta. 
Wherever 
any 
such 
impulse 
is 
found 
in 
the 
unconscious 
which 
can 
be 
paired 
with 
a 
contrasting 
one, 
it 
can 
regularly 
be 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
latter, 
too, 
is 
effective. 
Every 
active 
perversion 
is 
here 
accompanied 
by 
its 
passive 
counterpart. 
He 
who 
in 
the 
unconscious 
is 
an 
exhibitionist 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
a 
voyeur, 
he 
who 
suffers 
from 
sadistic 
feelings 
as 
a 
result 
of 
repression 
will 
also 
show 
another 
reinforcement 
of 
the 
symptoms 
from 
the 
source 
of 



masochistic 
tendencies. 
The 
perfect 
concurrence 
with 
the 
behavior 
of 
the 
corresponding 
positive 
perversions 
is 
certainly 
very 
noteworthy. 
In 
the 
picture 
of 
the 
disease, 
however, 
the 
preponderant 
rôle 
is 
played 
by 
either 
one 
or 
the 
other 
of 
the 
opposing 
tendencies. 
Gamma. 
In 
a 
pronounced 
case 
of 
psychoneurosis 
we 
seldom 
find 
the 
development 
of 
one 
single 
perverted 
impulse; 
usually 
there 
are 
many 
and 
regularly 
there 
are 
traces 
of 
all 
perversions. 
The 
individual 
impulse, 
however, 
on 
account 
of 
its 
intensity, 
is 
independent 
of 
the 
development 
of 
the 
others, 
but 
the 
study 
of 
the 
positive 
perversions 
gives 
us 
the 
accurate 
counterpart 
to 
it. 
PARTIAL 
IMPULSES 
AND 
EROGENOUS 
ZONES 
Keeping 
in 
mind 
what 
we 
have 
learned 
from 
the 
examination 
of 
the 
positive 
and 
negative 
perversions, 
it 
becomes 
quite 
obvious 
that 
they 
can 
be 
referred 
to 
a 
number 
of 
"partial 
impulses," 
which 
are 
not, 
however, 
primary 
but 
are 
subject 
to 
further 
analysis. 
By 
an 
"impulse" 
we 
can 
understand 
in 
the 
first 
place 
nothing 
but 
the 
psychic 
representative 
of 
a 
continually 
flowing 
internal 
somatic 
source 
of 
excitement, 
in 
contradistinction 
to 
the 
"stimulus" 
which 
is 
produced 
by 
isolated 
excitements 
coming 
from 
without. 
The 
impulse 
is 
thus 
one 
of 
the 
concepts 
marking 
the 
limits 
between 
the 
psychic 
and 
the 
physical. 
The 
simplest 
and 
most 
obvious 
assumption 
concerning 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
impulses 
would 
be 
that 
in 
themselves 
they 
possess 
no 
quality 
but 
are 
only 
taken 
into 
account 
as 
a 
measure 
of 
the 
demand 
for 
effort 
in 
the 
psychic 
life. 
What 
distinguishes 
the 
impulses 
from 
one 
another 
and 
furnishes 
them 
with 
specific 
attributes 
is 
their 
relation 
to 
their 
somatic 
sources 
and 
to 
their 
aims. 
The 
source 
of 
the 
impulse 
is 
an 
exciting 
process 
in 
an 
organ, 
and 
the 
immediate 
aim 
of 
the 
impulse 
lies 
in 
the 
elimination 
of 
this 
organic 
stimulus. 
Another 
preliminary 
assumption 
in 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
impulse 
which 
we 
cannot 
relinquish, 
states 
that 
the 
bodily 
organs 
furnish 
two 
kinds 
of 
excitements 
which 
are 
determined 
by 
differences 
of 
a 
chemical 
nature. 
One 
of 
these 
forms 
of 
excitement 
we 
designate 
as 
the 
specifically 
sexual 
and 
the 
concerned 
organ 
as 
the 
erogenous 
zone, 
while 
the 
sexual 
element 
emanating 
from 
it 
is 
the 
partial 
impulse.[27] 
In 
the 
perversions 
which 
claim 
sexual 
significance 
for 
the 
oral 
cavity 
and 
the 
anal 
opening 
the 
part 
played 
by 
the 
erogenous 
zone 
is 
quite 
obvious. 
It 
behaves 
in 
every 
way 
like 
a 
part 
of 
the 
sexual 
apparatus. 
In 
hysteria 
these 
parts 
of 
the 
body, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
tracts 
of 
mucous 
membrane 
proceeding 
from 
them, 
become 
the 
seat 
of 
new 
sensations 
and 
innervating 
changes 
in 
a 
manner 



similar 
to 
the 
real 
genitals 
when 
under 
the 
excitement 
of 
normal 
sexual 
processes. 
The 
significance 
of 
the 
erogenous 
zones 
in 
the 
psychoneuroses, 
as 
additional 
apparatus 
and 
substitutes 
for 
the 
genitals, 
appears 
to 
be 
most 
prominent 
in 
hysteria 
though 
that 
does 
not 
signify 
that 
it 
is 
of 
lesser 
validity 
in 
the 
other 
morbid 
forms. 
It 
is 
not 
so 
recognizable 
in 
compulsion 
neurosis 
and 
paranoia 
because 
here 
the 
symptom 
formation 
takes 
place 
in 
regions 
of 
the 
psychic 
apparatus 
which 
lie 
at 
a 
great 
distance 
from 
the 
central 
locations 
for 
bodily 
control. 
The 
more 
remarkable 
thing 
in 
the 
compulsion 
neurosis 
is 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
impulses 
which 
create 
new 
sexual 
aims 
and 
appear 
independently 
of 
the 
erogenous 
zones. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
eye 
corresponds 
to 
an 
erogenous 
zone 
in 
the 
looking 
and 
exhibition 
mania, 
while 
the 
skin 
takes 
on 
the 
same 
part 
in 
the 
pain 
and 
cruelty 
components 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse. 
The 
skin, 
which 
in 
special 
parts 
of 
the 
body 
becomes 
differentiated 
as 
sensory 
organs 
and 
modified 
by 
the 
mucous 
membrane, 
is 
the 
erogenous 
zone,

EXPLANATION 
OF 
THE 
MANIFEST 
PREPONDERANCE 
OF 
SEXUAL 
PERVERSIONS 
IN 
THE 
PSYCHONEUROSES 
The 
sexuality 
of 
psychoneurotics 
has 
perhaps 
been 
placed 
in 
a 
false 
light 
by 
the 
above 
discussions. 
It 
appears 
that 
the 
sexual 
behavior 
of 
the 
psychoneurotic 
approaches 
in 
predisposition 
to 
the 
pervert 
and 
deviates 
by 
just 
so 
much 
from 
the 
normal. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
is 
very 
possible 
that 
the 
constitutional 
disposition 
of 
these 
patients 
besides 
containing 
an 
immense 
amount 
of 
sexual 
repression 
and 
a 
predominant 
force 
of 
sexual 
impulse 
also 
possesses 
an 
unusual 
tendency 
to 
perversions 
in 
the 
broadest 
sense. 
However, 
an 
examination 
of 
milder 
cases 
shows 
that 
the 
last 
assumption 
is 
not 
an 
absolute 
requisite, 
or 
at 
least 
that 
in 
pronouncing 
judgment 
on 
the 
morbid 
effects 
one 
ought 
to 
discount 
the 
effect 
of 
one 
of 
the 
factors. 
In 
most 
psychoneurotics 
the 
disease 
first 
appears 
after 
puberty 
following 
the 
demands 
of 
the 
normal 
sexual 
life. 
Against 
these 
the 
repression 
above 
all 
directs 
itself. 
Or 
the 
disease 
comes 
on 
later, 
owing 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
libido 
is 
unable 
to 
attain 
normal 
sexual 
gratification. 
In 
both 
cases 
the 
libido 
behaves 
like 
a 
stream 
the 
principal 
bed 
of 
which 
is 
dammed; 
it 
fills 
the 
collateral 
roads 
which 
until 
now 
perhaps 
have 
been 
empty. 
Thus 
the 
manifestly 
great 
(though 
to 
be 
sure 
negative) 
tendency 
to 
perversion 
in 
psychoneurotics 
may 
be 
collaterally 
conditioned; 
at 
any 
rate, 
it 
is 
certainly 
collaterally 
increased. 
The 
fact 
of 
the 
matter 
is 
that 
the 
sexual 
repression 
has 
to 
be 
added 
as 
an 
inner 



factor 
to 
such 
external 
ones 
as 
restriction 
of 
freedom, 
inaccessibility 
to 
the 
normal 
sexual 
object, 
dangers 
of 
the 
normal 
sexual 
act, 
etc., 
which 
cause 
the 
origin 
of 
perversions 
in 
individuals 
who 
might 
have 
otherwise 
remained 
normal. 
In 
individual 
cases 
of 
neurosis 
the 
behavior 
may 
be 
different; 
now 
the 
congenital 
force 
of 
the 
tendency 
to 
perversion 
may 
be 
more 
decisive 
and 
at 
other 
times 
more 
influence 
may 
be 
exerted 
by 
the 
collateral 
increase 
of 
the 
same 
through 
the 
deviation 
of 
the 
libido 
from 
the 
normal 
sexual 
aim 
and 
object. 
It 
would 
be 
unjust 
to 
construe 
a 
contrast 
where 
a 
cooperation 
exists. 
The 
greatest 
results 
will 
always 
be 
brought 
about 
by 
a 
neurosis 
if 
constitution 
and 
experience 
cooperate 
in 
the 
same 
direction. 
A 
pronounced 
constitution 
may 
perhaps 
be 
able 
to 
dispense 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
daily 
impressions, 
while 
a 
profound 
disturbance 
in 
life 
may 
perhaps 
bring 
on 
a 
neurosis 
even 
in 
an 
average 
constitution. 
These 
views 
similarly 
hold 
true 
in 
the 
etiological 
significance 
of 
the 
congenital 
and 
the 
accidental 
experiences 
in 
other 
spheres. 
If, 
however, 
preference 
is 
given 
to 
the 
assumption 
that 
an 
especially 
formed 
tendency 
to 
perversions 
is 
characteristic 
of 
the 
psychoneurotic 
constitution, 
there 
is 
a 
prospect 
of 
being 
able 
to 
distinguish 
a 
multiformity 
of 
such 
constitutions 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
congenital 
preponderance 
of 
this 
or 
that 
erogenous 
zone, 
or 
of 
this 
or 
that 
partial 
impulse. 
Whether 
there 
is 
a 
special 
relationship 
between 
the 
predisposition 
to 
perversions 
and 
the 
selection 
of 
the 
morbid 
picture 
has 
not, 
like 
many 
other 
things 
in 
this 
realm, 
been 
investigated. 
REFERENCE 
TO 
THE 
INFANTILISM 
OF 
SEXUALITY 
By 
demonstrating 
the 
perverted 
feelings 
as 
symptomatic 
formations 
in 
psychoneurotics, 
we 
have 
enormously 
increased 
the 
number 
of 
persons 
who 
can 
be 
added 
to 
the 
perverts. 
This 
is 
not 
only 
because 
neurotics 
represent 
a 
very 
large 
proportion 
of 
humanity, 
but 
we 
must 
consider 
also 
that 
the 
neuroses 
in 
all 
their 
gradations 
run 
in 
an 
uninterrupted 
series 
to 
the 
normal 
state. 
Moebius 
was 
quite 
justified 
in 
saying 
that 
we 
are 
all 
somewhat 
hysterical. 
Hence, 
the 
very 
wide 
dissemination 
of 
perversions 
urged 
us 
to 
assume 
that 
the 
predisposition 
to 
perversions 
is 
no 
rare 
peculiarity 
but 
must 
form 
a 
part 
of 
the 
normally 
accepted 
constitution. 
We 
have 
heard 
that 
it 
is 
a 
question 
whether 
perversions 
should 
be 
referred 
to 
congenital 
determinations 
or 
whether 
they 
originate 
from 
accidental 
experiences, 
just 
as 
Binet 
showed 
in 
fetichisms. 
Now 
we 
are 
forced 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
there 
is 
indeed 
something 
congenital 
at 
the 
basis 
of 



perversions, 
but 
it 
is 
something 
which 
is 
congenital 
in 
all 
persons, 
which 
as 
a 
predisposition 
may 
fluctuate 
in 
intensity 
and 
is 
brought 
into 
prominence 
by 
influences 
of 
life. 
We 
deal 
here 
with 
congenital 
roots 
in 
the 
constitution 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
which 
in 
one 
series 
of 
cases 
develop 
into 
real 
carriers 
of 
sexual 
activity 
(perverts); 
while 
in 
other 
cases 
they 
undergo 
an 
insufficient 
suppression 
(repression), 
so 
that 
as 
morbid 
symptoms 
they 
are 
enabled 
to 
attract 
to 
themselves 
in 
a 
round-about 
way 
a 
considerable 
part 
of 
the 
sexual 
energy; 
while 
again 
in 
favorable 
cases 
between 
the 
two 
extremes 
they 
originate 
the 
normal 
sexual 
life 
through 
effective 
restrictions 
and 
other 
elaborations. 
But 
we 
must 
also 
remember 
that 
the 
assumed 
constitution 
which 
shows 
the 
roots 
of 
all 
perversions 
will 
be 
demonstrable 
only 
in 
the 
child, 
though 
all 
impulses 
can 
be 
manifested 
in 
it 
only 
in 
moderate 
intensity. 
If 
we 
are 
led 
to 
suppose 
that 
neurotics 
conserve 
the 
infantile 
state 
of 
their 
sexuality 
or 
return 
to 
it, 
our 
interest 
must 
then 
turn 
to 
the 
sexual 
life 
of 
the 
child, 
and 
we 
will 
then 
follow 
the 
play 
of 
influences 
which 
control 
the 
processes 
of 
development 
of 
the 
infantile 
sexuality 
up 
to 
its 
termination 
in 
a 
perversion, 
a 
neurosis 
or 
a 
normal 
sexual 
life.

The 
facts 
contained 
in

have 
been

Such 
a 
striving 
against 
the 
compulsion 
to 
inversion 
favors 
cures 
by 
suggestion 
of 
psychoanalysis. 
[5] 
Many 
have 
justly 
emphasized 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
autobiographic 
statements 
of 
inverts, 
as 
to 
the 
time 
of 
the 
appearance 
of 
their 
tendency 
to 
inversion, 
are 
untrustworthy 
as 
they 
may 
have 
repressed 
from 
memory 
any 
evidences 
of 

heterosexual 
feelings. 
Psychoanalysis 
has 
confirmed 
this 
suspicion 
in 
all 
cases 
of 
inversion 
accessible, 
and 
has 
decidedly 
changed 
their 
anamnesis 
by 
filling 
up 
the 
infantile 
amnesias. 


[6] 
With 
what 
reserve 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
degeneration 
should 
be 
made 
and 
what 
slight 
practical 
significance 
can 
be 
attributed 
to 
it 
can 
be 
gathered 
from 
the 
discussions 
of 
Moebius 
(Ueber 
Entartung; 
Grenzfragen 
des 
Nerven-und 
Seelenlebens, 
No. 
III, 
1900). 
He 
says: 
"If 
we 
review 
the 
wide 
sphere 
of 
degeneration 
upon 
which 
we 
have 
here 
turned 
some 
light 
we 
can 
conclude 
without 
further 
ado 
that 
it 
is 
really 
of 
little 
value 
to 
diagnose 
degeneration." 
[7] 
We 
must 
agree 
with 
the 
spokesman 
of 
"Uranism" 
that 
some 
of 
the 
most 
prominent 
men 
known 
have 
been 
inverts 
and 
perhaps 
absolute 
inverts. 
[8] 
In 
the 
conception 
of 
inversion 
the 
pathological 
features 
have 
been 
Separated 
from 
the 
anthropological. 
For 
this 
credit 
is 
due 
to 
I. 
Bloch 
(Beiträge 
zur 
Ätiologie 
der 
Psychopathia 
Sexualis, 
2 
Teile, 
1902-3), 
who 
has 
also 
brought 
into 
prominence 
the 
existence 
of 
inversion 
in 
the 
old 
civilized 
nations.

[11] 
According 
to 
a 
report 
in 
Vol. 
6 
of 
the 
Jahrbuch 
f. 
sexuelle 
Zwischenstufen, 
E. 
Gley 
is 
supposed 
to 
have 
been 
the 
first 
to 
mention 
bisexuality 
as 
an 
explanation 
of 
inversion. 
He 
published 
a 
paper 
(Les 
Abérrations 
de 
l'instinct 
Sexuel) 
in 
the 
Revue 
Philosophique 
as 
early 
as 
January, 
1884. 
It 
is 
moreover 
noteworthy 
that 
the 
majority 
of 
authors 
who 
trace 
the 
inversion 
to 
bisexuality 
assume 
this 
factor 
not 
only 
for 
the 
inverts 
but 
also 
for 
those 
who 
have 
developed 
normally, 
and 
justly 
interpret 
the 
inversion 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a 
disturbance 
in 
development. 
Among 
these 
authors 
are 
Chevalier 
(Inversion 
Sexuelle, 
1893), 
and 
v. 
Krafft-Ebing 
("Zur 
Erklärung 
der 
konträren 
Sexualempfindung," 
Jahrbücher 
f. 
Psychiatrie 
u. 
Nervenheilkunde, 
XIII), 
who 
states 
that 
there 
are 
a 
number 
of 
observations 
"from 
which 
at 
least 
the 
virtual 
and 
continued 
existence 
of 
this 
second 
center 
(of 
the 
underlying 
sex) 
results." 
A 
Dr. 
Arduin 
(Die 
Frauenfrage 
und 
die 
sexuellen 
Zwischenstufen, 
2d 
vol. 
of 
the 
Jahrbuch 
f. 
sexuelle 

Zwischenstufen, 
1900) 
states 
that 
"in 
every 
man 
there 
exist 
male 
and 
female 
elements." 
See 
also 
the 
same 
Jahrbuch, 
Bd. 
I, 
1899 
("Die 
objektive 
Diagnose 
der 
Homosexualitat," 
by 
M. 
Hirschfeld, 
pp. 
8-9). 
In 
the 
determination 
of 
sex, 
as 
far 
as 
heterosexual 
persons 
are 
concerned, 
some 
are 
disproportionately 
more 
strongly 
developed 
than 
others. 
G. 
Herman 
is 
firm 
in 
his 
belief 
"that 
in 
every 
woman 
there 
are 
male, 
and 
in 
every 
man 
there 
are 
female 
germs 
and 
qualities" 
(Genesis, 
das 
Gesetz 
der 
Zeugung, 
9 
Bd., 
Libido 
und 
Manie, 
1903). 
As 
recently 
as 
1906 
W. 
Fliess 
(Der 
Ablauf 
des 
Lebens) 
has 
claimed 
ownership 
of 
the 
idea 
of 
bisexuality 
(in 
the 
sense 
of 
double 
sex). 
Psychoanalytic 
investigation 
very 
strongly 
opposes 
the 
attempt 
to 
separate 
homosexuals 
from 
other 
persons 
as 
a 
group 
of 
a 
special 
nature. 
By 
also 
studying 
sexual 
excitations 
other 
than 
the 
manifestly 
open 
ones 
it 
discovers 
that 
all 
men 
are 
capable 
of 
homosexual 
object 
selection 
and 
actually 
accomplish 
this 
in 
the 
unconscious. 
Indeed 
the 
attachments 
of 
libidinous 
feelings 
to 
persons 
of 
the 
same 
sex 
play 
no 
small 
rôle 
as 
factors 
in 
normal 
psychic 
life, 
and 
as 
causative 
factors 
of 
disease 
they 
play 
a 
greater 
rôle 
than 
those 
belonging 
to 
the 
opposite 
sex. 
According 
to 
psychoanalysis, 
it 
rather 
seems 
that 
it 
is 
the 
independence 
of 
the 
object, 
selection 
of 
the 
sex 
of 
the 
object, 
the 
same 
free 
disposal 
over 
male 
and 
female 
objects, 
as 
observed 
in 
childhood, 
in 
primitive 
states 
and 
in 
prehistoric 
times, 
which 
forms 
the 
origin 
from 
which 
the 
normal 
as 
well 
as 
the 
inversion 
types 
developed, 
following 
restrictions 
in 
this 
or 
that 
direction. 
In 
the 
psychoanalytic 
sense 
the 
exclusive 
sexual 
interest 
of 
the 
man 
for 
the 
woman 
is 
also 
a 
problem 
requiring 
an 
explanation, 
and 
is 
not 
something 
that 
is 
self-evident 
and 
explainable 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
chemical 
attraction. 
The 
determination 
as 
to 
the 
definite 
sexual 
behavior 
does 
not 
occur 
until 
after 
puberty 
and 
is 
the 
result 
of 
a 
series 
of 
as 
yet 
not 
observable 
factors, 
some 
of 
which 
are 
of 
a 
constitutional, 
while 
some 
are 
of 
an 
accidental 
nature. 
Certainly 
some 
of 
these 
factors 
can 
turn 
out 
to 
be 
so 
enormous 
that 
by 
their 
character 
they 
influence 
the 
result. 
In 
general, 
however, 
the 
multiplicity 
of 
the 
determining 
factors 
is 
reflected 
by 
the 
manifoldness 
of 
the 
outcomes 
in 
the 
manifest 
sexual 
behavior 
of 
the 
person. 
In 
the 
inversion 
types 
it 
can 
be 
ascertained 
that 
they 
are 
altogether 
controlled 
by 
an 
archaic 
constitution 
and 
by 
primitive 
psychic 
mechanisms. 
The 
importance 
of 
the 
narcissistic 
object 
selection 
and 
the 
clinging 
to 
the 
erotic 
significance 
of 
the 
anal 
zone 
seem 
to 
be 
their 
most 
essential 
characteristics. 
But 
one 
gains 
nothing 
by 
separating 
the 
most 
extreme 
inversion 
types 
from 
the 
others 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
such 
constitutional 
peculiarities. 
What 
is 
found 
in 



the 
latter 
as 
seemingly 
an 
adequate 
determinant 
can 
also 
be 
demonstrated 
only 
in 
lesser 
force 
in 
the 
constitution 
of 
transitional 
types 
and 
in 
manifestly 
normal 
persons. 
The 
differences 
in 
the 
results 
may 
be 
of 
a 
qualitative 
nature, 
but 
analysis 
shows 
that 
the 
differences 
in 
the 
determinants 
are 
only 
quantitative. 
As 
a 
remarkable 
factor 
among 
the 
accidental 
influences 
of 
the 
object 
selection, 
we 
found 
the 
sexual 
rejection 
or 
the 
early 
sexual 
intimidation, 
and 
our 
attention 
was 
also 
called 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
existence 
of 
both 
parents 
plays 
an 
important 
rôle 
in 
the 
child's 
life. 
The 
disappearance 
of 
a 
strong 
father 
in 
childhood 
not 
infrequently 
favors 
the 
inversion. 
Finally, 
one 
might 
demand 
that 
the 
inversion 
of 
the 
sexual 
object 
should 
notionally 
be 
strictly 
separated 
from 
the 
mixing 
of 
the 
sex 
characteristics 
in 
the 
subject. 
A 
certain 
amount 
of 
independence 
is 
unmistakable 
also 
in 
this 
relation. 


[12] 
Although 
psychoanalysis 
has 
not 
yet 
given 
us 
a 
full 
explanation 
for 
the 
origin 
of 
inversion, 
it 
has 
revealed 
the 
psychic 
mechanism 
of 
its 
genesis 
and 
has 
essentially 
enriched 
the 
problems 
in 
question. 
In 
all 
the 
cases 
examined 
we 
have 
ascertained 
that 
the 
later 
inverts 
go 
through 
in 
their 
childhood 
a 
phase 
of 
very 
intense 
but 
short-lived 
fixation 
on 
the 
woman 
(usually 
on 
the 
mother) 
and 
after 
overcoming 
it 
they 
identify 
themselves 
with 
the 
woman 
and 
take 
themselves 
as 
the 
sexual 
object; 
that 
is, 
proceeding 
on 
a 
narcissistic 
basis, 
they 
look 
for 
young 
men 
resembling 
themselves 
in 
persons 
whom 
they 
wish 
to 
love 
as 
their 
mother 
has 
loved 
them. 
We 
have, 
moreover, 
frequently 
found 
that 
alleged 
inverts 
are 
by 
no 
means 
indifferent 
to 
the 
charms 
of 
women, 
but 
the 
excitation 
evoked 
by 
the 
woman 
is 
always 
transferred 
to 
a 
male 
object. 
They 
thus 
repeat 
through 
life 
the 
mechanism 
which 
gave 
origin 
to 
their 
inversion. 
Their 
obsessive 
striving 
for 
the 
man 
proves 
to 
be 
determined 
by 
their 
restless 
flight 
from 
the 
woman. 
[13] 
The 
most 
pronounced 
difference 
between 
the 
sexual 
life 
(Liebesleben) 
of 
antiquity 
and 
ours 
lies 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
ancients 
placed 
the 
emphasis 
on 
the 
impulse 
itself, 
while 
we 
put 
it 
on 
its 
object. 
The 
ancients 
extolled 
the 
impulse 
and 
were 
ready 
to 
ennoble 
through 
it 
even 
an 
inferior 
object, 
while 
we 
disparage 
the 
activity 
of 
the 
impulse 
as 
such 
and 
only 
countenance 
it 
on 
account 
of 
the 
merits 
of 
the 
object. 
[14] 
I 
must 
mention 
here 
that 
the 
blind 
obedience 
evinced 
by 
the 
hypnotized 
subject 
to 
the 
hypnotist 
causes 
me 
to 
think 
that 
the 
nature 
of 
hypnosis 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
unconscious 
fixation 
of 
the 
libido 
on 
the 
person 
of 
the 
hypnotizer 
(by 
means 
of 
the 
masochistic 
component 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse). 
Ferenczi 
connects 
this 
character 
of 
suggestibility 
with 
the 
"parent 
complex" 

(Jahrbuch 
für 
Psychoanalytische 
und 
psychopathologische 
Forschungen, 
I, 
1909). 


[15] 
Moreover, 
it 
is 
to 
be 
noted 
that 
sexual 
overvaluation 
does 
not 
become 
pronounced 
in 
all 
mechanisms 
of 
object 
selection, 
and 
that 
we 
shall 
later 
learn 
to 
know 
another 
and 
more 
direct 
explanation 
for 
the 
sexual 
rôle 
of 
the 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
body. 
[16] 
Further 
investigations 
lead 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
I. 
Bloch 
has 
overestimated 
the 
factor 
of 
excitement-hunger 
(Reizhunger). 
The 
various 
roads 
upon 
which 
the 
libido 
moves 
behave 
to 
each 
other 
from 
the 
very 
beginning 
like 
communicating 
pipes; 
the 
factor 
of 
collateral 
streaming 
must 
also 
be 
considered. 
[17] 
This 
weakness 
corresponds 
to 
the 
constitutional 
predisposition. 
The 
early 
sexual 
intimidation 
which 
pushes 
the 
person 
away 
from 
the 
normal 
sexual 
aim 
and 
urges 
him 
to 
seek 
a 
substitute, 
has 
been 
demonstrated 
by 
psychoanalysis, 
as 
an 
accidental 
determinant. 
[18] 
The 
shoe 
or 
slipper 
is 
accordingly 
a 
symbol 
for 
the 
female 
genitals. 
[19] 
Psychoanalysis 
has 
filled 
up 
the 
gap 
in 
the 
understanding 
of 
fetichisms 
by 
showing 
that 
the 
selection 
of 
the 
fetich 
depends 
on 
a 
coprophilic 
smell-
desire 
which 
has 
been 
lost 
by 
repression. 
Feet 
and 
hair 
are 
strong 
smelling 
objects 
which 
are 
raised 
to 
fetiches 
after 
the 
renouncing 
of 
the 
now 
unpleasant 
sensation 
of 
smell. 
Accordingly, 
only 
the 
filthy 
and 
ill-smelling 
foot 
is 
the 
sexual 
object 
in 
the 
perversion 
which 
corresponds 
to 
the 
foot 
fetichism. 
Another 
contribution 
to 
the 
explanation 
of 
the 
fetichistic 
preference 
of 
the 
foot 
is 
found 
in 
the 
Infantile 
Sexual 
Theories 
(see 
later). 
The 
foot 
replaces 
the 
penis 
which 
is 
so 
much 
missed 
in 
the 
woman. 
In 
some 
cases 
of 
foot 
fetichism 
it 
could 
be 
shown 
that 
the 
desire 
for 
looking 
originally 
directed 
to 
the 
genitals, 
which 
wished 
to 
reach 
its 
object 
from 
below, 
was 
stopped 
on 
the 
way 
by 
prohibition 
and 
repression, 
and 
therefore 
adhered 
to 
the 
foot 
or 
shoe 
as 
a 
fetich. 
In 
conformity 
with 
infantile 
expectation, 
the 
female 
genital 
was 
hereby 
imagined 
as 
a 
male 
genital. 
[20] 
I 
have 
no 
doubt 
that 
the 
conception 
of 
the 
"beautiful" 
is 
rooted 
in 
the 
soil 
of 
sexual 
excitement 
and 
originally 
signified 
the 
sexual 
excitant. 
The 
more 
remarkable, 
therefore, 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
genitals, 
the 
sight 
of 
which 
provokes 
the 
greatest 
sexual 
excitement, 
can 
really 
never 
be 
considered 
"beautiful." 
[21] 
Cf. 
here 
the 
later 
communication 
on 
the 
pregenital 
phases 
of 
the 
sexual 
development, 
in 
which 
this 
view 
is 
confirmed. 
See 
below, 
"Ambivalence." 
[22] 
Instead 
of 
substantiating 
this 
statement 
by 
many 
examples 
I 
will 
merely 

cite 
Havelock 
Ellis 
(The 
Sexual 
Impulse, 
1903): 
"All 
known 
cases 
of 
sadism 
and 
masochism, 
even 
those 
cited 
by 
v. 
Krafft-Ebing, 
always 
show 
(as 
has 
already 
been 
shown 
by 
Colin, 
Scott, 
and 
Féré) 
traces 
of 
both 
groups 
of 
manifestations 
in 
the 
same 
individual." 


[23] 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
the 
restricting 
forces 
of 
the 
sexual 
evolution--disgust, 
shame, 
morality--must 
also 
be 
looked 
upon 
as 
historic 
precipitates 
of 
the 
outer 
inhibitions 
which 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
experienced 
in 
the 
psychogenesis 
of 
humanity. 
One 
can 
observe 
that 
they 
appear 
in 
their 
time 
during 
the 
development 
of 
the 
individual 
almost 
spontaneously 
at 
the 
call 
of 
education 
and 
influence. 
[24] 
Studien 
über 
Hysterie, 
1895, 
J. 
Breuer 
tells 
of 
the 
patient 
on 
whom 
he 
first 
practiced 
the 
cathartic 
method: 
"The 
sexual 
factor 
was 
surprisingly 
undeveloped." 
[25] 
The 
well-known 
fancies 
of 
perverts 
which 
under 
favorable 
conditions 
are 
changed 
into 
contrivances, 
the 
delusional 
fears 
of 
paranoiacs 
which 
are 
in 
a 
hostile 
manner 
projected 
on 
others, 
and 
the 
unconscious 
fancies 
of 
hysterics 
which 
are 
discovered 
in 
their 
symptoms 
by 
psychoanalysis, 
agree 
as 
to 
content 
in 
the 
minutest 
details. 
[26] 
A 
psychoneurosis 
very 
often 
associates 
itself 
with 
a 
manifest 
inversion 
in 
which 
the 
heterosexual 
feeling 
becomes 
subjected 
to 
complete 
repression.-
It 
is 
but 
just 
to 
state 
that 
the 
necessity 
of 
a 
general 
recognition 
of 
the 
tendency 
to 
inversion 
in 
psychoneurotics 
was 
first 
imparted 
to 
me 
personally 
by 
Wilh. 
Fliess, 
of 
Berlin, 
after 
I 
had 
myself 
discovered 
it 
in 
some 
cases. 
[27] 
It 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
justify 
here 
this 
assumption 
which 
was 
taken 
from 
a 
definite 
class 
of 
neurotic 
diseases. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
would 
be 
impossible 
to 
assert 
anything 
definite 
concerning 
the 
impulses 
if 
one 
did 
not 
take 
the 
trouble 
of 
mentioning 
these 
presuppositions. 
[28] 
One 
should 
here 
think 
of 
Moll's 
assertion, 
who 
divides 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
into 
the 
impulses 
of 
contrectation 
and 
detumescence. 
Contrectation 
signifies 
a 
desire 
to 
touch 
the 
skin. 

II 


THE 
INFANTILE 
SEXUALITY 
It 
is 
a 
part 
of 
popular 
belief 
about 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
that 
it 
is 
absent 
in 
childhood 
and 
that 
it 
first 
appears 
in 
the 
period 
of 
life 
known 
as 
puberty. 
This, 
though 
a 
common 
error, 
is 
serious 
in 
its 
consequences 
and 
is 
chiefly 
due 
to 
our 
present 
ignorance 
of 
the 
fundamental 
principles 
of 
the 
sexual 
life. 
A 
comprehensive 
study 
of 
the 
sexual 
manifestations 
of 
childhood 
would 
probably 
reveal 
to 
us 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
essential 
features 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse, 
and 
would 
make 
us 
acquainted 
with 
its 
development 
and 
its 
composition 
from 
various 
sources. 
*The 
Neglect 
of 
the 
Infantile.*--It 
is 
remarkable 
that 
those 
writers 
who 
endeavor 
to 
explain 
the 
qualities 
and 
reactions 
of 
the 
adult 
individual 
have 
given 
so 
much 
more 
attention 
to 
the 
ancestral 
period 
than 
to 
the 
period 
of 
the 
individual's 
own 
existence--that 
is, 
they 
have 
attributed 
more 
influence 
to 
heredity 
than 
to 
childhood. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
it 
might 
well 
be 
supposed 
that 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
latter 
period 
would 
be 
easier 
to 
understand, 
and 
that 
it 
would 
be 
entitled 
to 
more 
consideration 
than 
heredity.[1] 
To 
be 
sure, 
one 
occasionally 
finds 
in 
medical 
literature 
notes 
on 
the 
premature 
sexual 
activities 
of 
small 
children, 
about 
erections 
and 
masturbation 
and 
even 
actions 
resembling 
coitus, 
but 
these 
are 
referred 
to 
merely 
as 
exceptional 
occurrences, 
as 
curiosities, 
or 
as 
deterring 
examples 
of 
premature 
perversity. 
No 
author 
has 
to 
my 
knowledge 
recognized 
the 
normality 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
in 
childhood, 
and 
in 
the 
numerous 
writings 
on 
the 
development 
of 
the 
child 
the 
chapter 
on 
"Sexual 
Development" 
is 
usually 
passed 
over.[2] 
*Infantile 
Amnesia.*--This 
remarkable 
negligence 
is 
due 
partly 
to 
conventional 
considerations, 
which 
influence 
the 
writers 
on 
account 
of 
their 
own 
bringing 
up, 
and 
partly 
to 
a 
psychic 
phenomenon 
which 
has 
thus 
far 
remained 
unexplained. 
I 
refer 
to 
the 
peculiar 
amnesia 
which 
veils 
from 
most 
people 
(not 
from 
all!) 
the 
first 
years 
of 
their 
childhood, 
usually 
the 
first 
six 
or 
eight 
years. 
So 
far 
it 
has 
not 
occurred 
to 
us 
that 
this 
amnesia 
ought 
to 
surprise 
us, 
though 
we 
have 
good 
reasons 
for 
surprise. 
For 
we 
are 
informed 
that 
in 
those 
years 
from 
which 
we 
later 
obtain 
nothing 
except 
a 
few 
incomprehensible 
memory 
fragments, 
we 
have 
vividly 
reacted 
to 
impressions, 
that 
we 
have 
manifested 
pain 
and 
pleasure 
like 
any 
human 
being, 
that 
we 
have 
evinced 
love, 
jealousy, 
and 
other 
passions 
as 
they 
then 
affected 
us; 
indeed 
we 
are 
told 
that 
we 
have 
uttered 
remarks 
which 
proved 
to 
grown-ups 
that 
we 
possessed 
understanding 
and 
a 
budding 
power 
of 



judgment. 
Still 
we 
know 
nothing 
of 
all 
this 
when 
we 
become 
older. 
Why 
does 
our 
memory 
lag 
behind 
all 
our 
other 
psychic 
activities? 
We 
really 
have 
reason 
to 
believe 
that 
at 
no 
time 
of 
life 
are 
we 
more 
capable 
of 
impressions 
and 
reproductions 
than 
during 
the 
years 
of 
childhood.[3] 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
we 
must 
assume, 
or 
we 
may 
convince 
ourselves 
through 
psychological 
observations 
on 
others, 
that 
the 
very 
impressions 
which 
we 
have 
forgotten 
have 
nevertheless 
left 
the 
deepest 
traces 
in 
our 
psychic 
life, 
and 
acted 
as 
determinants 
for 
our 
whole 
future 
development. 
We 
conclude 
therefore 
that 
we 
do 
not 
deal 
with 
a 
real 
forgetting 
of 
infantile 
impressions 
but 
rather 
with 
an 
amnesia 
similar 
to 
that 
observed 
in 
neurotics 
for 
later 
experiences, 
the 
nature 
of 
which 
consists 
in 
their 
being 
detained 
from 
consciousness 
(repression). 
But 
what 
forces 
bring 
about 
this 
repression 
of 
the 
infantile 
impressions? 
He 
who 
can 
solve 
this 
riddle 
will 
also 
explain 
hysterical 
amnesia. 
We 
shall 
not, 
however, 
hesitate 
to 
assert 
that 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
infantile 
amnesia 
gives 
us 
a 
new 
point 
of 
comparison 
between 
the 
psychic 
states 
of 
the 
child 
and 
those 
of 
the 
psychoneurotic. 
We 
have 
already 
encountered 
another 
point 
of 
comparison 
when 
confronted 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
sexuality 
of 
the 
psychoneurotic 
preserves 
the 
infantile 
character 
or 
has 
returned 
to 
it. 
May 
there 
not 
be 
an 
ultimate 
connection 
between 
the 
infantile 
and 
the 
hysterical 
amnesias? 
The 
connection 
between 
the 
infantile 
and 
the 
hysterical 
amnesias 
is 
really 
more 
than 
a 
mere 
play 
of 
wit. 
The 
hysterical 
amnesia 
which 
serves 
the 
repression 
can 
only 
be 
explained 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
individual 
already 
possesses 
a 
sum 
of 
recollections 
which 
have 
been 
withdrawn 
from 
conscious 
disposal 
and 
which 
by 
associative 
connection 
now 
seize 
that 
which 
is 
acted 
upon 
by 
the 
repelling 
forces 
of 
the 
repression 
emanating 
from 
consciousness. 


[4] 
We 
may 
say 
that 
without 
infantile 
amnesia 
there 
would 
be 
no 
hysterical 
amnesia. 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
infantile 
amnesia 
which 
causes 
the 
individual 
to 
look 
upon 
his 
childhood 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
prehistoric 
time 
and 
conceals 
from 
him 
the 
beginning 
of 
his 
own 
sexual 
life--that 
this 
amnesia 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
one 
does 
not 
usually 
attribute 
any 
value 
to 
the 
infantile 
period 
in 
the 
development 
of 
the 
sexual 
life. 
One 
single 
observer 
cannot 
fill 
the 
gap 
which 
has 
been 
thus 
produced 
in 
our 
knowledge. 
As 
early 
as 
1896 
I 
had 
already 
emphasized 
the 
significance 
of 
childhood 
for 
the 
origin 
of 
certain 
important 
phenomena 
connected 
with 
the 
sexual 
life, 
and 
since 
then 
I 
have 
not 
ceased 

to 
put 
into 
the 
foreground 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
infantile 
factor 
for 
sexuality. 
THE 
SEXUAL 
LATENCY 
PERIOD 
OF 
CHILDHOOD 
AND 
ITS 
INTERRUPTIONS 
The 
extraordinary 
frequent 
discoveries 
of 
apparently 
abnormal 
and 
exceptional 
sexual 
manifestations 
in 
childhood, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
discovery 
of 
infantile 
reminiscences 
in 
neurotics, 
which 
were 
hitherto 
unconscious, 
allow 
us 
to 
sketch 
the 
following 
picture 
of 
the 
sexual 
behavior 
of 
childhood.[5] 
It 
seems 
certain 
that 
the 
newborn 
child 
brings 
with 
it 
the 
germs 
of 
sexual 
feelings 
which 
continue 
to 
develop 
for 
some 
time 
and 
then 
succumb 
to 
a 
progressive 
suppression, 
which 
is 
in 
turn 
broken 
through 
by 
the 
proper 
advances 
of 
the 
sexual 
development 
and 
which 
can 
be 
checked 
by 
individual 
idiosyncrasies. 
Nothing 
is 
known 
concerning 
the 
laws 
and 
periodicity 
of 
this 
oscillating 
course 
of 
development. 
It 
seems, 
however, 
that 
the 
sexual 
life 
of 
the 
child 
mostly 
manifests 
itself 
in 
the 
third 
or 
fourth 
year 
in 
some 
form 
accessible 
to 
observation.[6] 
*The 
Sexual 
Inhibition.*--It 
is 
during 
this 
period 
of 
total 
or 
at 
least 
partial 
latency 
that 
the 
psychic 
forces 
develop 
which 
later 
act 
as 
inhibitions 
on 
the 
sexual 
life, 
and 
narrow 
its 
direction 
like 
dams. 
These 
psychic 
forces 
are 
loathing, 
shame, 
and 
moral 
and 
esthetic 
ideal 
demands. 
We 
may 
gain 
the 
impression 
that 
the 
erection 
of 
these 
dams 
in 
the 
civilized 
child 
is 
the 
work 
of 
education; 
and 
surely 
education 
contributes 
much 
to 
it. 
In 
reality, 
however, 
this 
development 
is 
organically 
determined 
and 
can 
occasionally 
be 
produced 
without 
the 
help 
of 
education. 
Indeed 
education 
remains 
properly 
within 
its 
assigned 
realm 
only 
if 
it 
strictly 
follows 
the 
path 
of 
the 
organic 
determinant 
and 
impresses 
it 
somewhat 
cleaner 
and 
deeper. 
*Reaction 
Formation 
and 
Sublimation.*--What 
are 
the 
means 
that 
accomplish 
these 
very 
important 
constructions 
so 
significant 
for 
the 
later 
personal 
culture 
and 
normality? 
They 
are 
probably 
brought 
about 
at 
the 
cost 
of 
the 
infantile 
sexuality 
itself, 
the 
influx 
of 
which 
has 
not 
stopped 
even 
in 
this 
latency 
period--the 
energy 
of 
which 
indeed 
has 
been 
turned 
away 
either 
wholly 
or 
partially 
from 
sexual 
utilization 
and 
conducted 
to 
other 
aims. 
The 
historians 
of 
civilization 
seem 
to 
be 
unanimous 
in 
the 
opinion 
that 
such 
deviation 
of 
sexual 
motive 
powers 
from 
sexual 
aims 
to 
new 
aims, 
a 
process 
which 
merits 
the 
name 
of 
sublimation, 
has 
furnished 
powerful 
components 
for 
all 
cultural 
accomplishments. 
We 
will 
therefore 
add 
that 
the 
same 
process 
acts 
in 
the 
development 
of 
every 
individual, 
and 
that 
it 
begins 
to 
act 
in 
the 
sexual 
latency 
period.[7] 



We 
can 
also 
venture 
an 
opinion 
about 
the 
mechanisms 
of 
such 
sublimation. 
The 
sexual 
feelings 
of 
these 
infantile 
years 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
could 
not 
be 
utilizable, 
since 
the 
procreating 
functions 
are 
postponed,--this 
is 
the 
chief 
character 
of 
the 
latency 
period; 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
they 
would 
in 
themselves 
be 
perverse, 
as 
they 
would 
emanate 
from 
erogenous 
zones 
and 
would 
be 
born 
of 
impulses 
which 
in 
the 
individual's 
course 
of 
development 
could 
only 
evoke 
a 
feeling 
of 
displeasure. 
They 
therefore 
awaken 
contrary 
forces 
(feelings 
of 
reaction), 
which 
in 
order 
to 
suppress 
such 
displeasure, 
build 
up 
the 
above 
mentioned 
psychic 
dams: 
loathing, 
shame, 
and 
morality.[8] 
*The 
Interruptions 
of 
the 
Latency 
Period.*--Without 
deluding 
ourselves 
as 
to 
the 
hypothetical 
nature 
and 
deficient 
clearness 
of 
our 
understanding 
regarding 
the 
infantile 
period 
of 
latency 
and 
delay, 
we 
will 
return 
to 
reality 
and 
state 
that 
such 
a 
utilization 
of 
the 
infantile 
sexuality 
represents 
an 
ideal 
bringing 
up 
from 
which 
the 
development 
of 
the 
individual 
usually 
deviates 
in 
some 
measure 
and 
often 
very 
considerably. 
A 
portion 
of 
the 
sexual 
manifestation 
which 
has 
withdrawn 
from 
sublimation 
occasionally 
breaks 
through, 
or 
a 
sexual 
activity 
remains 
throughout 
the 
whole 
duration 
of 
the 
latency 
period 
until 
the 
reinforced 
breaking 
through 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
in 
puberty. 
In 
so 
far 
as 
they 
have 
paid 
any 
attention 
to 
infantile 
sexuality 
the 
educators 
behave 
as 
if 
they 
shared 
our 
views 
concerning 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
moral 
forces 
of 
defence 
at 
the 
cost 
of 
sexuality, 
and 
as 
if 
they 
knew 
that 
sexual 
activity 
makes 
the 
child 
uneducable; 
for 
the 
educators 
consider 
all 
sexual 
manifestations 
of 
the 
child 
as 
an 
"evil" 
in 
the 
face 
of 
which 
little 
can 
be 
accomplished. 
We 
have, 
however, 
every 
reason 
for 
directing 
our 
attention 
to 
those 
phenomena 
so 
much 
feared 
by 
the 
educators, 
for 
we 
expect 
to 
find 
in 
them 
the 
solution 
of 
the 
primitive 
formation 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse. 
THE 
MANIFESTATIONS 
OF 
THE 
INFANTILE 
SEXUALITY 
For 
reasons 
which 
we 
shall 
discuss 
later 
we 
will 
take 
as 
a 
model 
of 
the 
infantile 
sexual 
manifestations 
thumbsucking 
(pleasure-sucking), 
to 
which 
the 
Hungarian 
pediatrist, 
Lindner, 
has 
devoted 
an 
excellent 
essay.[9] 
*Thumbsucking.*--Thumbsucking, 
which 
manifests 
itself 
in 
the 
nursing 
baby 
and 
which 
may 
be 
continued 
till 
maturity 
or 
throughout 
life, 
consists 
in 
a 
rhythmic 
repetition 
of 
sucking 
contact 
with 
the 
mouth 
(the 
lips), 
wherein 
the 
purpose 
of 
taking 
nourishment 
is 
excluded. 
A 
part 
of 
the 
lip 
itself, 
the 
tongue, 
which 
is 
another 
preferable 
skin 
region 
within 
reach, 
and 
even 
the 
big 
toe-may 
be 
taken 
as 
objects 
for 
sucking. 
Simultaneously, 
there 
is 
also 
a 
desire 
to 
grasp 
things, 
which 
manifests 
itself 
in 
a 
rhythmical 
pulling 
of 
the 
ear 
lobe 



and 
which 
may 
cause 
the 
child 
to 
grasp 
a 
part 
of 
another 
person 
(generally 
the 
ear) 
for 
the 
same 
purpose. 
The 
pleasure-sucking 
is 
connected 
with 
an 
entire 
exhaustion 
of 
attention 
and 
leads 
to 
sleep 
or 
even 
to 
a 
motor 
reaction 
in 
the 
form 
of 
an 
orgasm.[10] 
Pleasure-sucking 
is 
often 
combined 
with 
a 
rubbing 
contact 
with 
certain 
sensitive 
parts 
of 
the 
body, 
such 
as 
the 
breast 
and 
external 
genitals. 
It 
is 
by 
this 
road 
that 
many 
children 
go 
from 
thumb-
sucking 
to 
masturbation. 
Lindner 
himself 
has 
recognized 
the 
sexual 
nature 
of 
this 
action 
and 
openly 
emphasized 
it. 
In 
the 
nursery 
thumbsucking 
is 
often 
treated 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
any 
other 
sexual 
"naughtiness" 
of 
the 
child. 
A 
very 
strong 
objection 
was 
raised 
against 
this 
view 
by 
many 
pediatrists 
and 
neurologists 
which 
in 
part 
is 
certainly 
due 
to 
the 
confusion 
of 
the 
terms 
"sexual" 
and 
"genital." 
This 
contradiction 
raises 
the 
difficult 
question, 
which 
cannot 
be 
rejected, 
namely, 
in 
what 
general 
traits 
do 
we 
wish 
to 
recognize 
the 
sexual 
manifestations 
of 
the 
child. 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
association 
of 
the 
manifestations 
into 
which 
we 
gained 
an 
insight 
through 
psychoanalytic 
investigation 
justify 
us 
in 
claiming 
thumbsucking 
as 
a 
sexual 
activity 
and 
in 
studying 
through 
it 
the 
essential 
features 
of 
the 
infantile 
sexual 
activity. 
*Autoerotism.*--It 
is 
our 
duty 
here 
to 
arrange 
this 
state 
of 
affairs 
differently. 
Let 
us 
insist 
that 
the 
most 
striking 
character 
of 
this 
sexual 
activity 
is 
that 
the 
impulse 
is 
not 
directed 
against 
other 
persons 
but 
that 
it 
gratifies 
itself 
on 
its 
own 
body; 
to 
use 
the 
happy 
term 
invented 
by 
Havelock 
Ellis, 
we 
will 
say 
that 
it 
is 
autoerotic.[11] 
It 
is, 
moreover, 
clear 
that 
the 
action 
of 
the 
thumbsucking 
child 
is 
determined 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
seeks 
a 
pleasure 
which 
has 
already 
been 
experienced 
and 
is 
now 
remembered. 
Through 
the 
rhythmic 
sucking 
on 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
skin 
or 
mucous 
membrane 
it 
finds 
the 
gratification 
in 
the 
simplest 
way. 
It 
is 
also 
easy 
to 
conjecture 
on 
what 
occasions 
the 
child 
first 
experienced 
this 
pleasure 
which 
it 
now 
strives 
to 
renew. 
The 
first 
and 
most 
important 
activity 
in 
the 
child's 
life, 
the 
sucking 
from 
the 
mother's 
breast 
(or 
its 
substitute), 
must 
have 
acquainted 
it 
with 
this 
pleasure. 
We 
would 
say 
that 
the 
child's 
lips 
behaved 
like 
an 
erogenous 
zone, 
and 
that 
the 
excitement 
through 
the 
warm 
stream 
of 
milk 
was 
really 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
pleasurable 
sensation. 
To 
be 
sure, 
the 
gratification 
of 
the 
erogenous 
zone 
was 
at 
first 
united 
with 
the 
gratification 
of 
taking 
nourishment. 
He 
who 
sees 
a 
satiated 
child 
sink 
back 
from 
the 
mother's 
breast, 
and 
fall 
asleep 
with 
reddened 
cheeks 
and 
blissful 
smile, 
will 
have 
to 
admit 
that 
this 
picture 
remains 
as 
typical 
of 
the 
expression 
of 
sexual 



gratification 
in 
later 
life. 
But 
the 
desire 
for 
repetition 
of 
the 
sexual 
gratification 
is 
separated 
from 
the 
desire 
for 
taking 
nourishment; 
a 
separation 
which 
becomes 
unavoidable 
with 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
teeth 
when 
the 
nourishment 
is 
no 
longer 
sucked 
in 
but 
chewed. 
The 
child 
does 
not 
make 
use 
of 
a 
strange 
object 
for 
sucking 
but 
prefers 
its 
own 
skin 
because 
it 
is 
more 
convenient, 
because 
it 
thus 
makes 
itself 
independent 
of 
the 
outer 
world 
which 
it 
cannot 
yet 
control, 
and 
because 
in 
this 
way 
it 
creates 
for 
itself, 
as 
it 
were, 
a 
second, 
even 
if 
an 
inferior, 
erogenous 
zone. 
The 
inferiority 
of 
this 
second 
region 
urges 
it 
later 
to 
seek 
the 
same 
parts, 
the 
lips 
of 
another 
person. 
("It 
is 
a 
pity 
that 
I 
cannot 
kiss 
myself," 
might 
be 
attributed 
to 
it.) 
Not 
all 
children 
suck 
their 
thumbs. 
It 
may 
be 
assumed 
that 
it 
is 
found 
only 
in 
children 
in 
whom 
the 
erogenous 
significance 
of 
the 
lip-zone 
is 
constitutionally 
reënforced. 
Children 
in 
whom 
this 
is 
retained 
are 
habitual 
kissers 
as 
adults 
and 
show 
a 
tendency 
to 
perverse 
kissing, 
or 
as 
men 
they 
have 
a 
marked 
desire 
for 
drinking 
and 
smoking. 
But 
if 
repression 
comes 
into 
play 
they 
experience 
disgust 
for 
eating 
and 
evince 
hysterical 
vomiting. 
By 
virtue 
of 
the 
community 
of 
the 
lip-zone 
the 
repression 
encroaches 
upon 
the 
impulse 
of 
nourishment. 
Many 
of 
my 
female 
patients 
showing 
disturbances 
in 
eating, 
such 
as 
hysterical 
globus, 
choking 
sensations, 
and 
vomiting, 
have 
been 
energetic 
thumbsuckers 
during 
infancy. 
In 
the 
thumbsucking 
or 
pleasure-sucking 
we 
have 
already 
been 
able 
to 
observe 
the 
three 
essential 
characters 
of 
an 
infantile 
sexual 
manifestation. 
The 
latter 
has 
its 
origin 
in 
conjunction 
with 
a 
bodily 
function 
which 
is 
very 
important 
for 
life, 
it 
does 
not 
yet 
know 
any 
sexual 
object, 
it 
is 
autoerotic 
and 
its 
sexual 
aim 
is 
under 
the 
control 
of 
an 
erogenous 
zone. 
Let 
us 
assume 
for 
the 
present 
that 
these 
characters 
also 
hold 
true 
for 
most 
of 
the 
other 
activities 
of 
the 
infantile 
sexual 
impulse. 
THE 
SEXUAL 
AIM 
OF 
THE 
INFANTILE 
SEXUALITY 
*The 
Characters 
of 
the 
Erogenous 
Zones.*--From 
the 
example 
of 
thumbsucking 
we 
may 
gather 
a 
great 
many 
points 
useful 
for 
the 
distinguishing 
of 
an 
erogenous 
zone. 
It 
is 
a 
portion 
of 
skin 
or 
mucous 
membrane 
in 
which 
the 
stimuli 
produce 
a 
feeling 
of 
pleasure 
of 
definite 
quality. 
There 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
the 
pleasure-producing 
stimuli 
are 
governed 
by 
special 
determinants 
which 
we 
do 
not 
know. 
The 
rhythmic 
characters 
must 
play 
some 
part 
in 
them 
and 
this 
strongly 
suggests 
an 
analogy 
to 
tickling. 
It 
does 
not, 
however, 
appear 
so 
certain 
whether 
the 
character 
of 
the 
pleasurable 
feeling 
evoked 
by 
the 
stimulus 
can 
be 
designated 
as 
"peculiar," 



and 
in 
what 
part 
of 
this 
peculiarity 
the 
sexual 
factor 
exists. 
Psychology 
is 
still 
groping 
in 
the 
dark 
when 
it 
concerns 
matters 
of 
pleasure 
and 
pain, 
and 
the 
most 
cautious 
assumption 
is 
therefore 
the 
most 
advisable. 
We 
may 
perhaps 
later 
come 
upon 
reasons 
which 
seem 
to 
support 
the 
peculiar 
quality 
of 
the 
sensation 
of 
pleasure. 
The 
erogenous 
quality 
may 
adhere 
most 
notably 
to 
definite 
regions 
of 
the 
body. 
As 
is 
shown 
by 
the 
example 
of 
thumbsucking, 
there 
are 
predestined 
erogenous 
zones. 
But 
the 
same 
example 
also 
shows 
that 
any 
other 
region 
of 
skin 
or 
mucous 
membrane 
may 
assume 
the 
function 
of 
an 
erogenous 
zone; 
it 
must 
therefore 
carry 
along 
a 
certain 
adaptability. 
The 
production 
of 
the 
sensation 
of 
pleasure 
therefore 
depends 
more 
on 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
stimulus 
than 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
bodily 
region. 
The 
thumbsucking 
child 
looks 
around 
on 
his 
body 
and 
selects 
any 
portion 
of 
it 
for 
pleasure-sucking, 
and 
becoming 
accustomed 
to 
it, 
he 
then 
prefers 
it. 
If 
he 
accidentally 
strikes 
upon 
a 
predestined 
region, 
such 
as 
breast, 
nipple 
or 
genitals, 
it 
naturally 
has 
the 
preference. 
A 
quite 
analogous 
tendency 
to 
displacement 
is 
again 
found 
in 
the 
symptomatology 
of 
hysteria. 
In 
this 
neurosis 
the 
repression 
mostly 
concerns 
the 
genital 
zones 
proper; 
these 
in 
turn 
transmit 
their 
excitation 
to 
the 
other 
erogenous 
zones, 
usually 
dormant 
in 
mature 
life, 
which 
then 
behave 
exactly 
like 
genitals. 
But 
besides 
this, 
just 
as 
in 
thumbsucking, 
any 
other 
region 
of 
the 
body 
may 
become 
endowed 
with 
the 
excitation 
of 
the 
genitals 
and 
raised 
to 
an 
erogenous 
zone. 
Erogenous 
and 
hysterogenous 
zones 
show 
the 
same 
characters.[12] 
*The 
Infantile 
Sexual 
Aim.*--The 
sexual 
aim 
of 
the 
infantile 
impulse 
consists 
in 
the 
production 
of 
gratification 
through 
the 
proper 
excitation 
of 
this 
or 
that 
selected 
erogenous 
zone. 
In 
order 
to 
leave 
a 
desire 
for 
its 
repetition 
this 
gratification 
must 
have 
been 
previously 
experienced, 
and 
we 
may 
be 
sure 
that 
nature 
has 
devised 
definite 
means 
so 
as 
not 
to 
leave 
this 
occurrence 
to 
mere 
chance. 
The 
arrangement 
which 
has 
fulfilled 
this 
purpose 
for 
the 
lip-zone 
we 
have 
already 
discussed; 
it 
is 
the 
simultaneous 
connection 
of 
this 
part 
of 
the 
body 
with 
the 
taking 
of 
nourishment. 
We 
shall 
also 
meet 
other 
similar 
mechanisms 
as 
sources 
of 
sexuality. 
The 
state 
of 
desire 
for 
repetition 
of 
gratification 
can 
be 
recognized 
through 
a 
peculiar 
feeling 
of 
tension 
which 
in 
itself 
is 
rather 
of 
a 
painful 
character, 
and 
through 
a 
centrally-determined 
feeling 
of 
itching 
or 
sensitiveness 
which 
is 
projected 
into 
the 
peripheral 
erogenous 
zone. 
The 
sexual 
aim 
may 
therefore 
be 
formulated 
as 
follows: 
the 
chief 
object 
is 
to 
substitute 
for 
the 
projected 
feeling 
of 
sensitiveness 
in 
the 



erogenous 
zone 
that 
outer 
stimulus 
which 
removes 
the 
feeling 
of 
sensitiveness 
by 
evoking 
the 
feeling 
of 
gratification. 
This 
external 
stimulus 
consists 
usually 
in 
a 
manipulation 
which 
is 
analogous 
to 
sucking. 
It 
is 
in 
full 
accord 
with 
our 
physiological 
knowledge 
if 
the 
desire 
happens 
to 
be 
awakened 
also 
peripherally 
through 
an 
actual 
change 
in 
the 
erogenous 
zone. 
The 
action 
is 
puzzling 
only 
to 
some 
extent 
as 
one 
stimulus 
for 
its 
suppression 
seems 
to 
want 
another 
applied 
to 
the 
same 
place. 
THE 
MASTURBATIC 
SEXUAL 
MANIFESTATIONS[13] 
It 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
great 
satisfaction 
to 
know 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
further 
of 
greater 
importance 
to 
learn 
about 
the 
sexual 
activity 
of 
the 
child 
after 
the 
impulse 
of 
one 
erogenous 
zone 
has 
become 
comprehensible 
to 
us. 
The 
most 
pronounced 
differences 
are 
found 
in 
the 
action 
necessary 
for 
the 
gratification, 
which 
consists 
in 
sucking 
for 
the 
lip 
zone 
and 
which 
must 
be 
replaced 
by 
other 
muscular 
actions 
according 
to 
the 
situation 
and 
nature 
of 
the 
other 
zones. 
*The 
Activity 
of 
the 
Anal 
Zone.*--Like 
the 
lip 
zone 
the 
anal 
zone 
is, 
through 
its 
position, 
adapted 
to 
conduct 
the 
sexuality 
to 
the 
other 
functions 
of 
the 
body. 
It 
should 
be 
assumed 
that 
the 
erogenous 
significance 
of 
this 
region 
of 
the 
body 
was 
originally 
very 
large. 
Through 
psychoanalysis 
one 
finds, 
not 
without 
surprise, 
the 
many 
transformations 
that 
are 
normally 
undertaken 
with 
the 
usual 
excitations 
emanating 
from 
here, 
and 
that 
this 
zone 
often 
retains 
for 
life 
a 
considerable 
fragment 
of 
genital 
irritability.[14] 
The 
intestinal 
catarrhs 
so 
frequent 
during 
infancy 
produce 
intensive 
irritations 
in 
this 
zone, 
and 
we 
often 
hear 
it 
said 
that 
intestinal 
catarrh 
at 
this 
delicate 
age 
causes 
"nervousness." 
In 
later 
neurotic 
diseases 
they 
exert 
a 
definite 
influence 
on 
the 
symptomatic 
expression 
of 
the 
neurosis, 
placing 
at 
its 
disposal 
the 
whole 
sum 
of 
intestinal 
disturbances. 
Considering 
the 
erogenous 
significance 
of 
the 
anal 
zone 
which 
has 
been 
retained 
at 
least 
in 
transformation, 
one 
should 
not 
laugh 
at 
the 
hemorrhoidal 
influences 
to 
which 
the 
old 
medical 
literature 
attached 
so 
much 
weight 
in 
the 
explanation 
of 
neurotic 
states. 
Children 
utilizing 
the 
erogenous 
sensitiveness 
of 
the 
anal 
zone 
can 
be 
recognized 
by 
their 
holding 
back 
of 
fecal 
masses 
until 
through 
accumulation 
there 
result 
violent 
muscular 
contractions; 
the 
passage 
of 
these 
masses 
through 
the 
anus 
is 
apt 
to 
produce 
a 
marked 
irritation 
of 
the 
mucus 
membrane. 
Besides 
the 
pain 
this 
must 
produce 
also 
a 
sensation 
of 
pleasure. 
One 
of 
the 
surest 
premonitions 
of 
later 
eccentricity 
or 
nervousness 
is 
when 
an 
infant 
obstinately 
refuses 
to 
empty 
his 
bowel 
when 
placed 
on 
the 
chamber 
by 



the 
nurse 
and 
reserves 
this 
function 
at 
its 
own 
pleasure. 
It 
does 
not 
concern 
him 
that 
he 
will 
soil 
his 
bed; 
all 
he 
cares 
for 
is 
not 
to 
lose 
the 
subsidiary 
pleasure 
while 
defecating. 
The 
educators 
have 
again 
the 
right 
inkling 
when 
they 
designate 
children 
who 
withhold 
these 
functions 
as 
bad. 
The 
content 
of 
the 
bowel 
which 
is 
an 
exciting 
object 
to 
the 
sexually 
sensitive 
surface 
of 
mucous 
membrane 
behaves 
like 
the 
precursor 
of 
another 
organ 
which 
does 
not 
become 
active 
until 
after 
the 
phase 
of 
childhood. 
In 
addition 
it 
has 
other 
important 
meanings 
to 
the 
nursling. 
It 
is 
evidently 
treated 
as 
an 
additional 
part 
of 
the 
body, 
it 
represents 
the 
first 
"donation," 
the 
disposal 
of 
which 
expresses 
the 
pliability 
while 
the 
retention 
of 
it 
can 
express 
the 
spite 
of 
the 
little 
being 
towards 
its 
environment. 
From 
the 
idea 
of 
"donation" 
he 
later 
gains 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
"babe" 
which 
according 
to 
one 
of 
the 
infantile 
sexual 
theories 
is 
acquired 
through 
eating 
and 
is 
born 
through 
the 
bowel. 
The 
retention 
of 
fecal 
masses, 
which 
is 
at 
first 
intentional 
in 
order 
to 
utilize 
them, 
as 
it 
were, 
for 
masturbatic 
excitation 
of 
the 
anal 
zone, 
is 
at 
least 
one 
of 
the 
roots 
of 
constipation 
so 
frequent 
in 
neuropaths. 
The 
whole 
significance 
of 
the 
anal 
zone 
is 
mirrored 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
are 
but 
few 
neurotics 
who 
have 
not 
their 
special 
scatologic 
customs, 
ceremonies, 
etc., 
which 
they 
retain 
with 
cautious 
secrecy. 
Real 
masturbatic 
irritation 
of 
the 
anal 
zone 
by 
means 
of 
the 
fingers, 
evoked 
through 
either 
centrally 
or 
peripherally 
supported 
itching, 
is 
not 
at 
all 
rare 
in 
older 
children. 
*The 
Activity 
of 
the 
Genital 
Zone.*--Among 
the 
erogenous 
zones 
of 
the 
child's 
body 
there 
is 
one 
which 
certainly 
does 
not 
play 
the 
main 
rôle, 
and 
which 
cannot 
be 
the 
carrier 
of 
earliest 
sexual 
feeling--which, 
however, 
is 
destined 
for 
great 
things 
in 
later 
life. 
In 
both 
male 
and 
female 
it 
is 
connected 
with 
the 
voiding 
of 
urine 
(penis, 
clitoris), 
and 
in 
the 
former 
it 
is 
enclosed 
in 
a 
sack 
of 
mucous 
membrane, 
probably 
in 
order 
not 
to 
miss 
the 
irritations 
caused 
by 
the 
secretions 
which 
may 
arouse 
the 
sexual 
excitement 
at 
an 
early 
age. 
The 
sexual 
activities 
of 
this 
erogenous 
zone, 
which 
belongs 
to 
the 
real 
genitals, 
are 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
later 
normal 
sexual 
life. 
Owing 
to 
the 
anatomical 
position, 
the 
overflowing 
of 
secretions, 
the 
washing 
and 
rubbing 
of 
the 
body, 
and 
to 
certain 
accidental 
excitements 
(the 
wandering 
of 
intestinal 
worms 
in 
the 
girl), 
it 
happens 
that 
the 
pleasurable 
feeling 
which 
these 
parts 
of 
the 
body 
are 
capable 
of 
producing 
makes 
itself 
noticeable 
to 
the 
child 
even 
during 
the 
sucking 
age, 
and 
thus 
awakens 
desire 
for 
its 
repetition. 
When 
we 
review 
all 
the 
actual 
arrangements, 
and 
bear 
in 
mind 
that 
the 



measures 
for 
cleanliness 
have 
the 
same 
effect 
as 
the 
uncleanliness 
itself, 
we 
can 
then 
scarcely 
mistake 
nature's 
intention, 
which 
is 
to 
establish 
the 
future 
primacy 
of 
these 
erogenous 
zones 
for 
the 
sexual 
activity 
through 
the 
infantile 
onanism 
from 
which 
hardly 
an 
individual 
escapes. 
The 
action 
of 
removing 
the 
stimulus 
and 
setting 
free 
the 
gratification 
consists 
in 
a 
rubbing 
contiguity 
with 
the 
hand 
or 
in 
a 
certain 
previously-formed 
pressure 
reflex 
effected 
by 
the 
closure 
of 
the 
thighs. 
The 
latter 
procedure 
seems 
to 
be 
the 
more 
primitive 
and 
is 
by 
far 
the 
more 
common 
in 
girls. 
The 
preference 
for 
the 
hand 
in 
boys 
already 
indicates 
what 
an 
important 
part 
of 
the 
male 
sexual 
activity 
will 
be 
accomplished 
in 
the 
future 
by 
the 
impulse 
to 
mastery 
(Bemächtigungstrieb). 


[15] 
It 
can 
only 
help 
towards 
clearness 
if 
I 
state 
that 
the 
infantile 
masturbation 
should 
be 
divided 
into 
three 
phases. 
The 
first 
phase 
belongs 
to 
the 
nursing 
period, 
the 
second 
to 
the 
short 
flourishing 
period 
of 
sexual 
activity 
at 
about 
the 
fourth 
year, 
only 
the 
third 
corresponds 
to 
the 
one 
which 
is 
often 
considered 
exclusively 
as 
onanism 
of 
puberty. 
The 
infantile 
onanism 
seems 
to 
disappear 
after 
a 
brief 
time, 
but 
it 
may 
continue 
uninterruptedly 
till 
puberty 
and 
thus 
represent 
the 
first 
marked 
deviation 
from 
the 
development 
desirable 
for 
civilized 
man. 
At 
some 
time 
during 
childhood 
after 
the 
nursing 
period, 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
of 
the 
genitals 
reawakens 
and 
continues 
active 
for 
some 
time 
until 
it 
is 
again 
suppressed, 
or 
it 
may 
continue 
without 
interruption. 
The 
possible 
relations 
are 
very 
diverse 
and 
can 
only 
be 
elucidated 
through 
a 
more 
precise 
analysis 
of 
individual 
cases. 
The 
details, 
however, 
of 
this 
second 
infantile 
sexual 
activity 
leave 
behind 
the 
profoundest 
(unconscious) 
impressions 
in 
the 
persons's 
memory; 
if 
the 
individual 
remains 
healthy 
they 
determine 
his 
character 
and 
if 
he 
becomes 
sick 
after 
puberty 
they 
determine 
the 
symptomatology 
of 
his 
neurosis.[16] 
In 
the 
latter 
case 
it 
is 
found 
that 
this 
sexual 
period 
is 
forgotten 
and 
the 
conscious 
reminiscences 
pointing 
to 
them 
are 
displaced; 
I 
have 
already 
mentioned 
that 
I 
would 
like 
to 
connect 
the 
normal 
infantile 
amnesia 
with 
this 
infantile 
sexual 
activity. 
By 
psychoanalytic 
investigation 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
bring 
to 
consciousness 
the 
forgotten 
material, 
and 
thereby 
to 
remove 
a 
compulsion 
which 
emanates 
from 
the 
unconscious 
psychic 
material. 
*The 
Return 
of 
the 
Infantile 
Masturbation.*--The 
sexual 
excitation 
of 
the 
nursing 
period 
returns 
during 
the 
designated 
years 
of 
childhood 
as 
a 
centrally 
determined 
tickling 
sensation 
demanding 
onanistic 
gratification, 
or 
as 
a 
pollution-like 
process 
which, 
analogous 
to 
the 
pollution 
of 
maturity, 
may 
attain 
gratification 
without 
the 
aid 
of 
any 
action. 
The 
latter 
case 
is 
more 

frequent 
in 
girls 
and 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
childhood; 
its 
determinants 
are 
not 
well 
understood, 
but 
it 
often, 
though 
not 
regularly, 
seems 
to 
have 
as 
a 
basis 
a 
period 
of 
early 
active 
onanism. 
The 
symptomatology 
of 
this 
sexual 
manifestation 
is 
poor; 
the 
genital 
apparatus 
is 
still 
undeveloped 
and 
all 
signs 
are 
therefore 
displayed 
by 
the 
urinary 
apparatus 
which 
is, 
so 
to 
say, 
the 
guardian 
of 
the 
genital 
apparatus. 
Most 
of 
the 
so-called 
bladder 
disturbances 
of 
this 
period 
are 
of 
a 
sexual 
nature; 
whenever 
the 
enuresis 
nocturna 
does 
not 
represent 
an 
epileptic 
attack 
it 
corresponds 
to 
a 
pollution. 
The 
return 
of 
the 
sexual 
activity 
is 
determined 
by 
inner 
and 
outer 
causes 
which 
can 
be 
conjectured 
from 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
symptoms 
of 
neurotic 
diseases 
and 
definitely 
revealed 
by 
psychoanalytic 
investigations. 
The 
internal 
causes 
will 
be 
discussed 
later, 
the 
accidental 
outer 
causes 
attain 
at 
this 
time 
a 
great 
and 
permanent 
significance. 
As 
the 
first 
outer 
cause 
we 
have 
the 
influence 
of 
seduction 
which 
prematurely 
treats 
the 
child 
as 
a 
sexual 
object; 
under 
conditions 
favoring 
impressions 
this 
teaches 
the 
child 
the 
gratification 
of 
the 
genital 
zones, 
and 
thus 
usually 
forces 
it 
to 
repeat 
this 
gratification 
in 
onanism. 
Such 
influences 
can 
come 
from 
adults 
or 
other 
children. 
I 
cannot 
admit 
that 
I 
overestimated 
its 
frequency 
or 
its 
significance 
in 
my 
contributions 
to 
the 
etiology 
of 
hysteria,[17] 
though 
I 
did 
not 
know 
then 
that 
normal 
individuals 
may 
have 
the 
same 
experiences 
in 
their 
childhood, 
and 
hence 
placed 
a 
higher 
value 
on 
seductions 
than 
on 
the 
factors 
found 
in 
the 
sexual 
constitution 
and 
development.[18] 
It 
is 
quite 
obvious 
that 
no 
seduction 
is 
necessary 
to 
awaken 
the 
sexual 
life 
of 
the 
child, 
that 
such 
an 
awakening 
may 
come 
on 
spontaneously 
from 
inner 
sources. 
*Polymorphous-perverse 
Disposition.*--It 
is 
instructive 
to 
know 
that 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
seduction 
the 
child 
may 
become 
polymorphous-perverse 
and 
may 
be 
misled 
into 
all 
sorts 
of 
transgressions. 
This 
goes 
to 
show 
that 
it 
carries 
along 
the 
adaptation 
for 
them 
in 
its 
disposition. 
The 
formation 
of 
such 
perversions 
meets 
but 
slight 
resistance 
because 
the 
psychic 
dams 
against 
sexual 
transgressions, 
such 
as 
shame, 
loathing 
and 
morality--which 
depend 
on 
the 
age 
of 
the 
child--are 
not 
yet 
erected 
or 
are 
only 
in 
the 
process 
of 
formation. 
In 
this 
respect 
the 
child 
perhaps 
does 
not 
behave 
differently 
from 
the 
average 
uncultured 
woman 
in 
whom 
the 
same 
polymorphous-perverse 
disposition 
exists. 
Such 
a 
woman 
may 
remain 
sexually 
normal 
under 
usual 
conditions, 
but 
under 
the 
guidance 
of 
a 
clever 
seducer 
she 
will 
find 
pleasure 
in 
every 
perversion 
and 
will 
retain 
the 
same 
as 
her 
sexual 
activity. 
The 
same 
polymorphous 
or 
infantile 
disposition 
fits 
the 
prostitute 
for 
her 
professional 



activity, 
and 
in 
the 
enormous 
number 
of 
prostitutes 
and 
of 
women 
to 
whom 
we 
must 
attribute 
an 
adaptation 
for 
prostitution, 
even 
if 
they 
do 
not 
follow 
this 
calling, 
it 
is 
absolutely 
impossible 
not 
to 
recognize 
in 
their 
uniform 
disposition 
for 
all 
perversions 
the 
universal 
and 
primitive 
human. 
*Partial 
Impulses.*--For 
the 
rest, 
the 
influence 
of 
seduction 
does 
not 
aid 
us 
in 
unravelling 
the 
original 
relations 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse, 
but 
rather 
confuses 
our 
understanding 
of 
the 
same, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
prematurely 
supplies 
the 
child 
with 
the 
sexual 
object 
at 
a 
time 
when 
the 
infantile 
sexual 
impulse 
does 
not 
yet 
evince 
any 
desire 
for 
it. 
We 
must 
admit, 
however, 
that 
the 
infantile 
sexual 
life, 
though 
mainly 
under 
the 
control 
of 
erogenous 
zones, 
also 
shows 
components 
in 
which 
from 
the 
very 
beginning 
other 
persons 
are 
regarded 
as 
sexual 
objects. 
Among 
these 
we 
have 
the 
impulses 
for 
looking 
and 
showing 
off, 
and 
for 
cruelty, 
which 
manifest 
themselves 
somewhat 
independently 
of 
the 
erogenous 
zones 
and 
which 
only 
later 
enter 
into 
intimate 
relationship 
with 
the 
sexual 
life; 
but 
along 
with 
the 
erogenous 
sexual 
activity 
they 
are 
noticeable 
even 
in 
the 
infantile 
years 
as 
separate 
and 
independent 
strivings. 
The 
little 
child 
is 
above 
all 
shameless, 
and 
during 
its 
early 
years 
it 
evinces 
definite 
pleasure 
in 
displaying 
its 
body 
and 
especially 
its 
sexual 
organs. 
A 
counterpart 
to 
this 
desire 
which 
is 
to 
be 
considered 
as 
perverse, 
the 
curiosity 
to 
see 
other 
persons' 
genitals, 
probably 
appears 
first 
in 
the 
later 
years 
of 
childhood 
when 
the 
hindrance 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
shame 
has 
already 
reached 
a 
certain 
development. 
Under 
the 
influence 
of 
seduction 
the 
looking 
perversion 
may 
attain 
great 
importance 
for 
the 
sexual 
life 
of 
the 
child. 
Still, 
from 
my 
investigations 
of 
the 
childhood 
years 
of 
normal 
and 
neurotic 
patients, 
I 
must 
conclude 
that 
the 
impulse 
for 
looking 
can 
appear 
in 
the 
child 
as 
a 
spontaneous 
sexual 
manifestation. 
Small 
children, 
whose 
attention 
has 
once 
been 
directed 
to 
their 
own 
genitals--usually 
by 
masturbation--are 
wont 
to 
progress 
in 
this 
direction 
without 
outside 
interference, 
and 
to 
develop 
a 
vivid 
interest 
in 
the 
genitals 
of 
their 
playmates. 
As 
the 
occasion 
for 
the 
gratification 
of 
such 
curiosity 
is 
generally 
afforded 
during 
the 
gratification 
of 
both 
excrementitious 
needs, 
such 
children 
become 
voyeurs 
and 
are 
zealous 
spectators 
at 
the 
voiding 
of 
urine 
and 
feces 
of 
others, 
After 
this 
tendency 
has 
been 
repressed, 
the 
curiosity 
to 
see 
the 
genitals 
of 
others 
(one's 
own 
or 
those 
of 
the 
other 
sex) 
remains 
as 
a 
tormenting 
desire 
which 
in 
some 
neurotic 
cases 
furnishes 
the 
strongest 
motive 
power 
for 
the 
formation 
of 
symptoms. 
The 
cruelty 
component 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
develops 
in 
the 
child 
with 
still 
greater 
independence 
of 
those 
sexual 
activities 
which 
are 
connected 
with 



erogenous 
zones. 
Cruelty 
is 
especially 
near 
the 
childish 
character, 
since 
the 
inhibition 
which 
restrains 
the 
impulse 
to 
mastery 
before 
it 
causes 
pain 
to 
others--that 
is, 
the 
capacity 
for 
sympathy--develops 
comparatively 
late. 
As 
we 
know, 
a 
thorough 
psychological 
analysis 
of 
this 
impulse 
has 
not 
as 
yet 
been 
successfully 
accomplished; 
we 
may 
assume 
that 
the 
cruel 
feelings 
emanate 
from 
the 
impulse 
to 
mastery 
and 
appear 
at 
a 
period 
in 
the 
sexual 
life 
before 
the 
genitals 
have 
taken 
on 
their 
later 
rôle. 
It 
then 
dominates 
a 
phase 
of 
the 
sexual 
life, 
which 
we 
shall 
later 
describe 
as 
the 
pregenital 
organization. 
Children 
who 
are 
distinguished 
for 
evincing 
especial 
cruelty 
to 
animals 
and 
playmates 
may 
be 
justly 
suspected 
of 
intensive 
and 
premature 
sexual 
activity 
in 
the 
erogenous 
zones; 
and 
in 
a 
simultaneous 
prematurity 
of 
all 
sexual 
impulses, 
the 
erogenous 
sexual 
activity 
surely 
seems 
to 
be 
primary. 
The 
absence 
of 
the 
barrier 
of 
sympathy 
carries 
with 
it 
the 
danger 
that 
the 
connections 
between 
cruelty 
and 
the 
erogenous 
impulses 
formed 
in 
childhood 
cannot 
be 
broken 
in 
later 
life. 
An 
erogenous 
source 
of 
the 
passive 
impulse 
for 
cruelty 
(masochism) 
is 
found 
in 
the 
painful 
irritation 
of 
the 
gluteal 
region 
which 
is 
familiar 
to 
all 
educators 
since 
the 
confessions 
of 
J.J. 
Rousseau. 
This 
has 
justly 
caused 
them 
to 
demand 
that 
physical 
punishment, 
which 
usually 
concerns 
this 
part 
of 
the 
body, 
should 
be 
withheld 
from 
all 
children 
in 
whom 
the 
libido 
might 
be 
forced 
into 
collateral 
roads 
by 
the 
later 
demands 
of 
cultural 
education.[19] 
THE 
INFANTILE 
SEXUAL 
INVESTIGATION 
*Inquisitiveness.*--At 
the 
same 
time 
when 
the 
sexual 
life 
of 
the 
child 
reaches 
its 
first 
bloom, 
from 
the 
age 
of 
three 
to 
the 
age 
of 
five, 
it 
also 
evinces 
the 
beginning 
of 
that 
activity 
which 
is 
ascribed 
to 
the 
impulse 
for 
knowledge 
and 
investigation. 
The 
desire 
for 
knowledge 
can 
neither 
be 
added 
to 
the 
elementary 
components 
of 
the 
impulses 
nor 
can 
it 
be 
altogether 
subordinated 
under 
sexuality. 
Its 
activity 
corresponds 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
to 
a 
sublimating 
mode 
of 
acquisition 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
it 
labors 
with 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
desire 
for 
looking. 
Its 
relations 
to 
the 
sexual 
life, 
however, 
are 
of 
particular 
importance, 
for 
we 
have 
learned 
from 
psychoanalysis 
that 
the 
inquisitiveness 
of 
children 
is 
attracted 
to 
the 
sexual 
problems 
unusually 
early 
and 
in 
an 
unexpectedly 
intensive 
manner, 
indeed 
it 
perhaps 
may 
first 
be 
awakened 
by 
the 
sexual 
problems. 
*The 
Riddle 
of 
the 
Sphinx.*--It 
is 
not 
theoretical 
but 
practical 
interests 
which 
start 
the 
work 
of 
the 
investigation 
activity 
in 
the 
child. 
The 
threat 
to 
the 
conditions 
of 
his 
existence 
through 
the 
actual 
or 
expected 
arrival 
of 
a 
new 



child, 
the 
fear 
of 
the 
loss 
in 
care 
and 
love 
which 
is 
connected 
with 
this 
event, 
cause 
the 
child 
to 
become 
thoughtful 
and 
sagacious. 
Corresponding 
with 
the 
history 
of 
this 
awakening, 
the 
first 
problem 
with 
which 
it 
occupies 
itself 
is 
not 
the 
question 
as 
to 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
sexes, 
but 
the 
riddle: 
from 
where 
do 
children 
come? 
In 
a 
distorted 
form, 
which 
can 
easily 
be 
unraveled, 
this 
is 
the 
same 
riddle 
which 
was 
given 
by 
the 
Theban 
Sphinx. 
The 
fact 
of 
the 
two 
sexes 
is 
usually 
first 
accepted 
by 
the 
child 
without 
struggle 
and 
hesitation. 
It 
is 
quite 
natural 
for 
the 
male 
child 
to 
presuppose 
in 
all 
persons 
it 
knows 
a 
genital 
like 
his 
own, 
and 
to 
find 
it 
impossible 
to 
harmonize 
the 
lack 
of 
it 
with 
his 
conception 
of 
others. 
*The 
Castration 
Complex.*--This 
conviction 
is 
energetically 
adhered 
to 
by 
the 
boy 
and 
tenaciously 
defended 
against 
the 
contradictions 
which 
soon 
result, 
and 
are 
only 
given 
up 
after 
severe 
internal 
struggles 
(castration 
complex). 
The 
substitutive 
formations 
of 
this 
lost 
penis 
of 
the 
woman 
play 
a 
great 
part 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
many 
perversions. 
The 
assumption 
of 
the 
same 
(male) 
genital 
in 
all 
persons 
is 
the 
first 
of 
the 
remarkable 
and 
consequential 
infantile 
sexual 
theories. 
It 
is 
of 
little 
help 
to 
the 
child 
when 
biological 
science 
agrees 
with 
his 
preconceptions 
and 
recognizes 
the 
feminine 
clitoris 
as 
the 
real 
substitute 
for 
the 
penis. 
The 
little 
girl 
does 
not 
react 
with 
similar 
refusals 
when 
she 
sees 
the 
differently 
formed 
genital 
of 
the 
boy. 
She 
is 
immediately 
prepared 
to 
recognize 
it, 
and 
soon 
becomes 
envious 
of 
the 
penis; 
this 
envy 
reaches 
its 
highest 
point 
in 
the 
consequentially 
important 
wish 
that 
she 
also 
should 
be 
a 
boy. 
*Birth 
Theories.*--Many 
people 
can 
remember 
distinctly 
how 
intensely 
they 
interested 
themselves, 
in 
the 
prepubescent 
period, 
in 
the 
question 
where 
children 
came 
from. 
The 
anatomical 
solutions 
at 
that 
time 
read 
very 
differently; 
the 
children 
come 
out 
of 
the 
breast 
or 
are 
cut 
out 
of 
the 
body, 
or 
the 
navel 
opens 
itself 
to 
let 
them 
out. 
Outside 
of 
analysis 
one 
only 
seldom 
remembers 
the 
investigation 
corresponding 
to 
the 
early 
childhood 
years; 
it 
had 
long 
merged 
into 
repression 
but 
its 
results 
were 
thoroughly 
uniform. 
One 
gets 
children 
by 
eating 
something 
special 
(as 
in 
the 
fairy 
tale) 
and 
they 
are 
born 
through 
the 
bowel 
like 
a 
passage. 
These 
infantile 
theories 
recall 
the 
structures 
in 
the 
animal 
kingdom, 
especially 
do 
they 
recall 
the 
cloaca 
of 
the 
types 
which 
stand 
lower 
than 
the 
mammals. 
*Sadistic 
Conception 
of 
the 
Sexual 
Act.*--If 
children 
of 
so 
delicate 
an 
age 
become 
spectators 
of 
the 
sexual 
act 
between 
grown-ups, 
for 
which 
an 
occasion 
is 
furnished 
by 
the 
conviction 
of 
the 
grown-ups 
that 
little 
children 



cannot 
understand 
anything 
sexual, 
they 
cannot 
help 
conceiving 
the 
sexual 
act 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
maltreating 
or 
overpowering, 
that 
is, 
it 
impresses 
them 
in 
a 
sadistic 
sense. 
Psychoanalysis 
also 
teaches 
us 
that 
such 
an 
early 
childhood 
impression 
contributes 
much 
to 
the 
disposition 
for 
a 
later 
sadistic 
displacement 
of 
the 
sexual 
aim. 
Besides 
this 
children 
also 
occupy 
themselves 
with 
the 
problem 
of 
what 
the 
sexual 
act 
consists 
in 
or, 
as 
they 
grasp 
it, 
of 
what 
marriage 
consists, 
and 
seek 
the 
solution 
of 
the 
mystery 
mostly 
in 
an 
association 
to 
which 
the 
functions 
of 
urination 
and 
defecation 
give 
occasion. 
*The 
Typical 
Failure 
of 
the 
Infantile 
Sexual 
Investigation.*--It 
can 
be 
stated 
in 
general 
about 
the 
infantile 
sexual 
theories 
that 
they 
are 
reproductions 
of 
the 
child's 
own 
sexual 
constitution, 
and 
that 
despite 
their 
grotesque 
mistakes 
they 
evince 
more 
understanding 
of 
the 
sexual 
processes 
than 
is 
credited 
to 
their 
creators. 
Children 
also 
perceive 
the 
pregnancy 
of 
the 
mother 
and 
know 
how 
to 
interpret 
it 
correctly; 
the 
stork 
fable 
is 
very 
often 
related 
before 
auditors 
who 
confront 
it 
with 
a 
deep, 
but 
mostly 
mute 
suspicion. 
But 
as 
two 
elements 
remain 
unknown 
to 
the 
infantile 
sexual 
investigation, 
namely, 
the 
rôle 
of 
the 
propagating 
semen 
and 
the 
female 
genital 
opening--precisely 
the 
same 
points 
in 
which 
the 
infantile 
organization 
is 
still 
backward--the 
effort 
of 
the 
infantile 
investigator 
regularly 
remains 
fruitless, 
and 
ends 
in 
a 
renunciation 
which 
not 
infrequently 
leaves 
a 
lasting 
injury 
to 
the 
desire 
for 
knowledge. 
The 
sexual 
investigation 
of 
these 
early 
childhood 
years 
is 
always 
conducted 
alone, 
it 
signifies 
the 
first 
step 
towards 
independent 
orientation 
in 
the 
world, 
and 
causes 
a 
marked 
estrangement 
between 
the 
child 
and 
the 
persons 
of 
his 
environment 
who 
formerly 
enjoyed 
its 
full 
confidence. 
*The 
Phases 
of 
Development 
of 
the 
Sexual 
Organization.*--As 
characteristics 
of 
the 
infantile 
sexuality 
we 
have 
hitherto 
emphasized 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
is 
essentially 
autoerotic 
(it 
finds 
its 
object 
in 
its 
own 
body), 
and 
that 
its 
individual 
partial 
impulses, 
which 
on 
the 
whole 
are 
unconnected 
and 
independent 
of 
one 
another, 
are 
striving 
for 
the 
acquisition 
of 
pleasure. 
The 
end 
of 
this 
development 
forms 
the 
so-called 
normal 
sexual 
life 
of 
the 
adult 
in 
which 
the 
acquisition 
of 
pleasure 
has 
been 
put 
into 
the 
service 
of 
the 
function 
of 
propagation, 
and 
the 
partial 
impulses, 
under 
the 
primacy 
of 
one 
single 
erogenous 
zone, 
have 
formed 
a 
firm 
organization 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
sexual 
aim 
in 
a 
strange 
sexual 
object. 
*Pregenital 
Organizations.*--The 
study, 
with 
the 
help 
of 
psychoanalysis, 
of 
the 
inhibitions 
and 
disturbances 
in 
this 
course 
of 
development 
now 
permits 
us 
to 
recognize 
additions 
and 
primary 
stages 
of 
such 
organization 
of 
the 
partial 



impulses 
which 
likewise 
furnish 
a 
sort 
of 
sexual 
regime. 
These 
phases 
of 
the 
sexual 
organization 
normally 
will 
pass 
over 
smoothly 
and 
will 
only 
be 
recognizable 
by 
slight 
indications. 
Only 
in 
pathological 
cases 
do 
they 
become 
active 
and 
discernible 
to 
coarse 
observation. 
Organizations 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
in 
which 
the 
genital 
zones 
have 
not 
yet 
assumed 
the 
dominating 
rôle 
we 
would 
call 
the 
pregenital 
phase. 
So 
far 
we 
have 
become 
acquainted 
with 
two 
of 
them 
which 
recall 
reversions 
to 
early 
animal 
states. 
One 
of 
the 
first 
of 
such 
pregenital 
sexual 
organizations 
is 
the 
oral, 
or 
if 
we 
wish, 
the 
cannibalistic. 
Here 
the 
sexual 
activity 
is 
not 
yet 
separated 
from 
the 
taking 
of 
nourishment, 
and 
the 
contrasts 
within 
the 
same 
not 
yet 
differentiated. 
The 
object 
of 
the 
one 
activity 
is 
also 
that 
of 
the 
other, 
the 
sexual 
aim 
consists 
in 
the 
incorporating 
into 
one's 
own 
body 
of 
the 
object, 
it 
is 
the 
prototype 
of 
that 
which 
later 
plays 
such 
an 
important 
psychic 
rôle 
as 
identification. 
As 
a 
remnant 
of 
this 
fictitious 
phase 
of 
organization 
forced 
on 
us 
by 
pathology 
we 
can 
consider 
thumbsucking. 
Here 
the 
sexual 
activity 
became 
separated 
from 
the 
nourishment 
activity 
and 
the 
strange 
object 
was 
given 
up 
in 
favor 
of 
one 
from 
his 
own 
body. 
A 
second 
pregenital 
phase 
is 
the 
sadistic-anal 
organization. 
Here 
the 
contrasts 
which 
run 
through 
the 
whole 
sexual 
life 
are 
already 
developed, 
but 
cannot 
yet 
be 
designated 
as 
masculine 
and 
feminine, 
but 
must 
be 
called 
active 
and 
passive. 
The 
activity 
is 
supplied 
by 
the 
musculature 
of 
the 
body 
through 
the 
mastery 
impulse; 
the 
erogenous 
mucous 
membrane 
of 
the 
bowel 
manifests 
itself 
above 
all 
as 
an 
organ 
with 
a 
passive 
sexual 
aim, 
for 
both 
strivings 
there 
are 
objects 
present, 
which 
however 
do 
not 
merge 
together. 
Besides 
them 
there 
are 
other 
partial 
impulses 
which 
are 
active 
in 
an 
autoerotic 
manner. 
The 
sexual 
polarity 
and 
the 
strange 
object 
can 
thus 
already 
be 
demonstrated 
in 
this 
phase. 
The 
organization 
and 
subordination 
under 
the 
function 
of 
propagation 
are 
still 
lacking. 
*Ambivalence.*--This 
form 
of 
the 
sexual 
organization 
could 
be 
retained 
throughout 
life 
and 
continue 
to 
draw 
to 
itself 
a 
large 
part 
of 
the 
sexual 
activity. 
The 
prevalence 
of 
sadism 
and 
the 
rôle 
of 
the 
cloaca 
of 
the 
anal 
zone 
stamps 
it 
with 
an 
exquisitely 
archaic 
impression. 
As 
another 
characteristic 
belonging 
to 
it 
we 
can 
mention 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
contrasting 
pair 
of 
impulses 
are 
developed 
in 
almost 
the 
same 
manner, 
a 
behavior 
which 
was 
designated 
by 
Bleuler 
with 
the 
happy 
name 
of 
ambivalence. 
The 
assumption 
of 
the 
pregenital 
organizations 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
is 
based 
on 



the 
analysis 
of 
the 
neuroses 
and 
hardly 
deserves 
any 
consideration 
without 
a 
knowledge 
of 
the 
same. 
We 
may 
expect 
that 
continued 
analytic 
efforts 
will 
furnish 
us 
with 
still 
more 
disclosures 
concerning 
the 
structure 
and 
development 
of 
the 
normal 
sexual 
function. 
To 
complete 
the 
picture 
of 
the 
infantile 
sexual 
life 
one 
must 
add 
that 
frequently 
or 
regularly 
an 
object 
selection 
takes 
place 
even 
in 
childhood 
which 
is 
as 
characteristic 
as 
the 
one 
we 
have 
represented 
for 
the 
phase 
of 
development 
of 
puberty. 
This 
object 
selection 
proceeds 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
that 
all 
the 
sexual 
strivings 
proceed 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
one 
person 
in 
whom 
they 
wish 
to 
attain 
their 
aim. 
This 
is 
then 
the 
nearest 
approach 
to 
the 
definitive 
formation 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
after 
puberty, 
that 
is 
possible 
in 
childhood. 
It 
differs 
from 
the 
latter 
only 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
collection 
of 
the 
partial 
impulses 
and 
their 
subordination 
to 
the 
primacy 
of 
the 
genitals 
is 
very 
imperfectly 
or 
not 
at 
all 
accomplished 
in 
childhood. 
The 
establishment 
of 
this 
primacy 
in 
the 
service 
of 
propagation 
is 
therefore 
the 
last 
phase 
through 
which 
the 
sexual 
organization 
passes. 
*The 
Two 
Periods 
of 
Object 
Selection.*--That 
the 
object 
selection 
takes 
place 
in 
two 
periods, 
or 
in 
two 
shifts, 
can 
be 
spoken 
of 
as 
a 
typical 
occurrence. 
The 
first 
shift 
has 
its 
origin 
between 
the 
age 
of 
three 
and 
five 
years, 
and 
is 
brought 
to 
a 
stop 
or 
to 
retrogression 
by 
the 
latency 
period; 
it 
is 
characterized 
by 
the 
infantile 
nature 
of 
its 
sexual 
aims. 
The 
second 
shift 
starts 
with 
puberty 
and 
determines 
the 
definitive 
formation 
of 
the 
sexual 
life. 
The 
fact 
of 
the 
double 
object 
selection 
which 
is 
essentially 
due 
to 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
latency 
period, 
becomes 
most 
significant 
for 
the 
disturbance 
of 
this 
terminal 
state. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
infantile 
object 
selection 
reach 
into 
the 
later 
period; 
they 
are 
either 
preserved 
as 
such 
or 
are 
even 
refreshed 
at 
the 
time 
of 
puberty. 
But 
due 
to 
the 
development 
of 
the 
repression 
which 
takes 
place 
between 
the 
two 
phases 
they 
turn 
out 
as 
unutilizable. 
The 
sexual 
aims 
have 
become 
softened 
and 
now 
represent 
what 
we 
can 
designate 
as 
the 
tender 
streams 
of 
the 
sexual 
life. 
Only 
psychoanalytic 
investigation 
can 
demonstrate 
that 
behind 
this 
tenderness, 
such 
as 
honoring 
and 
esteeming, 
there 
is 
concealed 
the 
old 
sexual 
strivings 
of 
the 
infantile 
partial 
impulses 
which 
have 
now 
become 
useless. 
The 
object 
selection 
of 
the 
pubescent 
period 
must 
renounce 
the 
infantile 
objects 
and 
begin 
anew 
as 
a 
sensuous 
stream. 
The 
fact 
that 
the 
two 
streams 
do 
not 
meet 
often 
enough 
has 
as 
a 
result 
that 
one 
of 
the 
ideals 
of 
the 
sexual 
life, 
namely, 
the 
union 
of 
all 
desires 
in 
one 
object, 
can 
not 
be 
attained. 



THE 
SOURCES 
OF 
THE 
INFANTILE 
SEXUALITY 
In 
our 
effort 
to 
follow 
up 
the 
origins 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse, 
we 
have 
thus 
far 
found 
that 
the 
sexual 
excitement 
originates 
(_a_) 
as 
an 
imitation 
of 
a 
gratification 
which 
has 
been 
experienced 
in 
conjunction 
with 
other 
organic 
processes; 
(_b_) 
through 
the 
appropriate 
peripheral 
stimulation 
of 
erogenous 
zones; 
(_c_) 
and 
as 
an 
expression 
of 
some 
"impulse," 
like 
the 
looking 
and 
cruelty 
impulses, 
the 
origin 
of 
which 
we 
do 
not 
yet 
fully 
understand. 
The 
psychoanalytic 
investigation 
of 
later 
life 
which 
leads 
back 
to 
childhood 
and 
the 
contemporary 
observation 
of 
the 
child 
itself 
coöperate 
to 
reveal 
to 
us 
still 
other 
regularly-flowing 
sources 
of 
the 
sexual 
excitement. 
The 
observation 
of 
childhood 
has 
the 
disadvantage 
of 
treating 
easily 
misunderstood 
material, 
while 
psychoanalysis 
is 
made 
difficult 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
can 
reach 
its 
objects 
and 
conclusions 
only 
by 
great 
detours; 
still 
the 
united 
efforts 
of 
both 
methods 
achieve 
a 
sufficient 
degree 
of 
positive 
understanding. 
In 
investigating 
the 
erogenous 
zones 
we 
have 
already 
found 
that 
these 
skin 
regions 
merely 
show 
the 
special 
exaggeration 
of 
a 
form 
of 
sensitiveness 
which 
is 
to 
a 
certain 
degree 
found 
over 
the 
whole 
surface 
of 
the 
skin. 
It 
will 
therefore 
not 
surprise 
us 
to 
learn 
that 
certain 
forms 
of 
general 
sensitiveness 
in 
the 
skin 
can 
be 
ascribed 
to 
very 
distinct 
erogenous 
action. 
Among 
these 
we 
will 
above 
all 
mention 
the 
temperature 
sensitiveness; 
this 
will 
perhaps 
prepare 
us 
for 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
therapeutic 
effects 
of 
warm 
baths. 
*Mechanical 
Excitation.*--We 
must, 
moreover, 
describe 
here 
the 
production 
of 
sexual 
excitation 
by 
means 
of 
rhythmic 
mechanical 
shaking 
of 
the 
body. 
There 
are 
three 
kinds 
of 
exciting 
influences: 
those 
acting 
on 
the 
sensory 
apparatus 
of 
the 
vestibular 
nerves, 
those 
acting 
on 
the 
skin, 
and 
those 
acting 
on 
the 
deep 
parts, 
such 
as 
the 
muscles 
and 
joints. 
The 
sexual 
excitation 
produced 
by 
these 
influences 
seems 
to 
be 
of 
a 
pleasurable 
nature--it 
is 
worth 
emphasizing 
that 
for 
some 
time 
we 
shall 
continue 
to 
use 
indiscriminately 
the 
terms 
"sexual 
excitement" 
and 
"gratification" 
leaving 
the 
search 
for 
an 
explanation 
of 
the 
terms 
to 
a 
later 
time--and 
that 
the 
pleasure 
is 
produced 
by 
mechanical 
stimulation 
is 
proved 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
children 
are 
so 
fond 
of 
play 
involving 
passive 
motion, 
like 
swinging 
or 
flying 
in 
the 
air, 
and 
repeatedly 
demand 
its 
repetition.[20] 
As 
we 
know, 
rocking 
is 
regularly 
used 
in 
putting 
restless 
children 
to 
sleep. 
The 
shaking 
sensation 
experienced 
in 
wagons 
and 
railroad 
trains 
exerts 
such 
a 
fascinating 
influence 
on 
older 
children, 
that 
all 
boys, 
at 
least 
at 
one 
time 
in 
their 
lives, 
want 
to 
become 
conductors 
and 
drivers. 
They 
are 
wont 
to 
ascribe 
to 
railroad 
activities 
an 
extraordinary 
and 



mysterious 
interest, 
and 
during 
the 
age 
of 
phantastic 
activity 
(shortly 
before 
puberty) 
they 
utilize 
these 
as 
a 
nucleus 
for 
exquisite 
sexual 
symbolisms. 
The 
desire 
to 
connect 
railroad 
travelling 
with 
sexuality 
apparently 
originates 
from 
the 
pleasurable 
character 
of 
the 
sensation 
of 
motion. 
When 
the 
repression 
later 
sets 
in 
and 
changes 
so 
many 
of 
the 
childish 
likes 
into 
their 
opposites, 
these 
same 
persons 
as 
adolescents 
and 
adults 
then 
react 
to 
the 
rocking 
and 
rolling 
with 
nausea 
and 
become 
terribly 
exhausted 
by 
a 
railroad 
journey, 
or 
they 
show 
a 
tendency 
to 
attacks 
of 
anxiety 
during 
the 
journey, 
and 
by 
becoming 
obsessed 
with 
railroad 
phobia 
they 
protect 
themselves 
against 
a 
repetition 
of 
the 
painful 
experiences. 
This 
also 
fits 
in 
with 
the 
not 
as 
yet 
understood 
fact 
that 
the 
concurrence 
of 
fear 
with 
mechanical 
shaking 
produces 
the 
severest 
hysterical 
forms 
of 
traumatic 
neurosis. 
It 
may 
at 
least 
be 
assumed 
that 
inasmuch 
as 
even 
a 
slight 
intensity 
of 
these 
influences 
becomes 
a 
source 
of 
sexual 
excitement, 
the 
action 
of 
an 
excessive 
amount 
of 
the 
same 
will 
produce 
a 
profound 
disorder 
in 
the 
sexual 
mechanism. 
*Muscular 
Activity.*--It 
is 
well 
known 
that 
the 
child 
has 
need 
for 
strong 
muscular 
activity, 
from 
the 
gratification 
of 
which 
it 
draws 
extraordinary 
pleasure. 
Whether 
this 
pleasure 
has 
anything 
to 
do 
with 
sexuality, 
whether 
it 
includes 
in 
itself 
sexual 
satisfaction? 
or 
can 
be 
the 
occasion 
of 
sexual 
excitement; 
all 
this 
may 
be 
refuted 
by 
critical 
consideration, 
which 
will 
probably 
be 
directed 
also 
to 
the 
position 
taken 
above 
that 
the 
pleasure 
in 
the 
sensations 
of 
passive 
movement 
are 
of 
sexual 
character 
or 
that 
they 
are 
sexually 
exciting. 
The 
fact 
remains, 
however, 
that 
a 
number 
of 
persons 
report 
that 
they 
experienced 
the 
first 
signs 
of 
excitement 
in 
their 
genitals 
during 
fighting 
or 
wrestling 
with 
playmates, 
in 
which 
situation, 
besides 
the 
general 
muscular 
exertion, 
there 
is 
an 
intensive 
contact 
with 
the 
opponent's 
skin 
which 
also 
becomes 
effective. 
The 
desire 
for 
muscular 
contest 
with 
a 
definite 
person, 
like 
the 
desire 
for 
word 
contest 
in 
later 
years, 
is 
a 
good 
sign 
that 
the 
object 
selection 
has 
been 
directed 
toward 
this 
person. 
"Was 
sich 
liebt, 
das 
neckt 
sich."[21] 
In 
the 
promotion 
of 
sexual 
excitement 
through 
muscular 
activity 
we 
might 
recognize 
one 
of 
the 
sources 
of 
the 
sadistic 
impulse. 
The 
infantile 
connection 
between 
fighting 
and 
sexual 
excitement 
acts 
in 
many 
persons 
as 
a 
determinant 
for 
the 
future 
preferred 
course 
of 
their 
sexual 
impulse.[22] 
*Affective 
Processes.*--The 
other 
sources 
of 
sexual 
excitement 
in 
the 
child 
are 
open 
to 
less 
doubt. 
Through 
contemporary 
observations, 
as 
well 
as 



through 
later 
investigations, 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
ascertain 
that 
all 
more 
intensive 
affective 
processes, 
even 
excitements 
of 
a 
terrifying 
nature, 
encroach 
upon 
sexuality; 
this 
can 
at 
all 
events 
furnish 
us 
with 
a 
contribution 
to 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
pathogenic 
action 
of 
such 
emotions. 
In 
the 
school 
child, 
fear 
of 
a 
coming 
examination 
or 
exertion 
expended 
in 
the 
solution 
of 
a 
difficult 
task 
can 
become 
significant 
for 
the 
breaking 
through 
of 
sexual 
manifestations 
as 
well 
as 
for 
his 
relations 
to 
the 
school, 
inasmuch 
as 
under 
such 
excitements 
a 
sensation 
often 
occurs 
urging 
him 
to 
touch 
the 
genitals, 
or 
leading 
to 
a 
pollution-like 
process 
with 
all 
its 
disagreeable 
consequences. 
The 
behavior 
of 
children 
at 
school, 
which 
is 
so 
often 
mysterious 
to 
the 
teacher, 
ought 
surely 
to 
be 
considered 
in 
relation 
with 
their 
germinating 
sexuality. 
The 
sexually-exciting 
influence 
of 
some 
painful 
affects, 
such 
as 
fear, 
shuddering, 
and 
horror, 
is 
felt 
by 
a 
great 
many 
people 
throughout 
life 
and 
readily 
explains 
why 
so 
many 
seek 
opportunities 
to 
experience 
such 
sensations, 
provided 
that 
certain 
accessory 
circumstances 
(as 
under 
imaginary 
circumstances 
in 
reading, 
or 
in 
the 
theater) 
suppress 
the 
earnestness 
of 
the 
painful 
feeling. 
If 
we 
might 
assume 
that 
the 
same 
erogenous 
action 
also 
reaches 
the 
intensive 
painful 
feelings, 
especially 
if 
the 
pain 
be 
toned 
down 
or 
held 
at 
a 
distance 
by 
a 
subsidiary 
determination, 
this 
relation 
would 
then 
contain 
the 
main 
roots 
of 
the 
masochistic-sadistic 
impulse, 
into 
the 
manifold 
composition 
of 
which 
we 
are 
gaining 
a 
gradual 
insight. 
*Intellectual 
Work.*--Finally, 
is 
is 
evident 
that 
mental 
application 
or 
the 
concentration 
of 
attention 
on 
an 
intellectual 
accomplishment 
will 
result, 
especially 
often 
in 
youthful 
persons, 
but 
in 
older 
persons 
as 
well, 
in 
a 
simultaneous 
sexual 
excitement, 
which 
may 
be 
looked 
upon 
as 
the 
only 
justified 
basis 
for 
the 
otherwise 
so 
doubtful 
etiology 
of 
nervous 
disturbances 
from 
mental 
"overwork." 
If 
we 
now, 
in 
conclusion, 
review 
the 
evidences 
and 
indications 
of 
the 
sources 
of 
the 
infantile 
sexual 
excitement, 
which 
have 
been 
reported 
neither 
completely 
nor 
exhaustively, 
we 
may 
lay 
down 
the 
following 
general 
laws 
as 
suggested 
or 
established. 
It 
seems 
to 
be 
provided 
in 
the 
most 
generous 
manner 
that 
the 
process 
of 
sexual 
excitement--the 
nature 
of 
which 
certainly 
remains 
quite 
mysterious 
to 
us--should 
be 
set 
in 
motion. 
The 
factor 
making 
this 
provision 
in 
a 
more 
or 
less 
direct 
way 
is 
the 
excitation 
of 
the 
sensible 
surfaces 
of 
the 
skin 
and 
sensory 
organs, 
while 
the 
most 
immediate 
exciting 
influences 
are 
exerted 
on 
certain 
parts 
which 
are 
designated 
as 
erogenous 



zones. 
The 
criterion 
in 
all 
these 
sources 
of 
sexual 
excitement 
is 
really 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
stimuli, 
though 
the 
factor 
of 
intensity 
(in 
pain) 
is 
not 
entirely 
unimportant. 
But 
in 
addition 
to 
this 
there 
are 
arrangements 
in 
the 
organism 
which 
induce 
sexual 
excitement 
as 
a 
subsidiary 
action 
in 
a 
large 
number 
of 
inner 
processes 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
intensity 
of 
these 
processes 
has 
risen 
above 
certain 
quantitative 
limits. 
What 
we 
have 
designated 
as 
the 
partial 
impulses 
of 
sexuality 
are 
either 
directly 
derived 
from 
these 
inner 
sources 
of 
sexual 
excitation 
or 
composed 
of 
contributions 
from 
such 
sources 
and 
from 
erogenous 
zones. 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
nothing 
of 
any 
considerable 
significance 
occurs 
in 
the 
organism 
that 
does 
not 
contribute 
its 
components 
to 
the 
excitement 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
at 
present 
impossible 
to 
shed 
more 
light 
and 
certainty 
on 
these 
general 
propositions, 
and 
for 
this 
I 
hold 
two 
factors 
responsible; 
first, 
the 
novelty 
of 
this 
manner 
of 
investigation, 
and 
secondly, 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
sexual 
excitement 
is 
entirely 
unfamiliar 
to 
us. 
Nevertheless, 
I 
will 
not 
forbear 
speaking 
about 
two 
points 
which 
promise 
to 
open 
wide 
prospects 
in 
the 
future. 
*Diverse 
Sexual 
Constitutions.*--(_a_) 
We 
have 
considered 
above 
the 
possibility 
of 
establishing 
the 
manifold 
character 
of 
congenital 
sexual 
constitutions 
through 
the 
diverse 
formation 
of 
the 
erogenous 
zones; 
we 
may 
now 
attempt 
to 
do 
the 
same 
in 
dealing 
with 
the 
indirect 
sources 
of 
sexual 
excitement. 
We 
may 
assume 
that, 
although 
these 
different 
sources 
furnish 
contributions 
in 
all 
individuals, 
they 
are 
not 
all 
equally 
strong 
in 
all 
persons; 
and 
that 
a 
further 
contribution 
to 
the 
differentiation 
of 
the 
diverse 
sexual 
constitution 
will 
be 
found 
in 
the 
preferred 
developments 
of 
the 
individual 
sources 
of 
sexual 
excitement. 
*The 
Paths 
of 
Opposite 
Influences.*--(_b_) 
Since 
we 
are 
now 
dropping 
the 
figurative 
manner 
of 
expression 
hitherto 
employed, 
by 
which 
we 
spoke 
of 
sources 
of 
sexual 
excitement, 
we 
may 
now 
assume 
that 
all 
the 
connecting 
ways 
leading 
from 
other 
functions 
to 
sexuality 
must 
also 
be 
passable 
in 
the 
reverse 
direction. 
For 
example, 
if 
the 
lip 
zone, 
the 
common 
possession 
of 
both 
functions, 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
sexual 
gratification 
originates 
during 
the 
taking 
of 
nourishment, 
the 
same 
factor 
offers 
also 
an 
explanation 
for 
the 
disturbances 
in 
the 
taking 
of 
nourishment 
if 
the 
erogenous 
functions 
of 
the 
common 
zone 
are 
disturbed. 
As 
soon 
as 
we 
know 
that 
concentration 
of 
attention 
may 
produce 
sexual 
excitement, 
it 
is 
quite 
natural 
to 
assume 
that 
acting 
on 
the 
same 
path, 
but 
in 
a 
contrary 
direction, 
the 
state 
of 



sexual 
excitement 
will 
be 
able 
to 
influence 
the 
availability 
of 
the 
voluntary 
attention. 
A 
good 
part 
of 
the 
symptomatology 
of 
the 
neuroses 
which 
I 
trace 
to 
disturbance 
of 
sexual 
processes 
manifests 
itself 
in 
disturbances 
of 
the 
other 
non-sexual 
bodily 
functions, 
and 
this 
hitherto 
incomprehensible 
action 
becomes 
less 
mysterious 
if 
it 
only 
represents 
the 
counterpart 
of 
the 
influences 
controlling 
the 
production 
of 
the 
sexual 
excitement. 
However 
the 
same 
paths 
through 
which 
sexual 
disturbances 
encroach 
upon 
the 
other 
functions 
of 
the 
body 
must 
in 
health 
be 
supposed 
to 
serve 
another 
important 
function. 
It 
must 
be 
through 
these 
paths 
that 
the 
attraction 
of 
the 
sexual 
motive-powers 
to 
other 
than 
sexual 
aims, 
the 
sublimation 
of 
sexuality, 
is 
accomplished. 
We 
must 
conclude 
with 
the 
admission 
that 
very 
little 
is 
definitely 
known 
concerning 
the 
paths 
beyond 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
exist, 
and 
that 
they 
are 
probably 
passable 
in 
both 
directions. 


[1] 
For 
it 
is 
really 
impossible 
to 
have 
a 
correct 
knowledge 
of 
the 
part 
belonging 
to 
heredity 
without 
first 
understanding 
the 
part 
belonging 
to 
the 
infantile. 
[2] 
This 
assertion 
on 
revision 
seemed 
even 
to 
myself 
so 
bold 
that 
I 
decided 
to 
test 
its 
correctness 
by 
again 
reviewing 
the 
literature. 
The 
result 
of 
this 
second 
review 
did 
not 
warrant 
any 
change 
in 
my 
original 
statement. 
The 
scientific 
elaboration 
of 
the 
physical 
as 
well 
as 
the 
psychic 
phenomena 
of 
the 
infantile 
sexuality 
is 
still 
in 
its 
initial 
stages. 
One 
author 
(S. 
Bell, 
"A 
Preliminary 
Study 
of 
the 
Emotions 
of 
Love 
Between 
the 
Sexes," 
American 
Journal 
of 
Psychology, 
XIII, 
1902) 
says: 
"I 
know 
of 
no 
scientist 
who 
has 
given 
a 
careful 
analysis 
of 
the 
emotion 
as 
it 
is 
seen 
in 
the 
adolescent." 
The 
only 
attention 
given 
to 
somatic 
sexual 
manifestations 
occurring 
before 
the 
age 
of 
puberty 
was 
in 
connection 
with 
degenerative 
manifestations, 
and 
these 
were 
referred 
to 
as 
a 
sign 
of 
degeneration. 
A 
chapter 
on 
the 
sexual 
life 
of 
children 
is 
not 
to 
be 
found 
in 
all 
the 
representative 
psychologies 
of 
this 
age 
which 
I 
have 
read. 
Among 
these 
works 
I 
can 
mention 
the 
following: 
Preyer; 
Baldwin 
(The 
Development 
of 
the 
Mind 
in 
the 
Child 
and 
in 
the 
Race, 
1898); 
Pérez 
(L'enfant 
de 
3-7 
ans, 
1894); 
Strümpel 
(Die 
pädagogische 
Pathologie, 
1899); 
Karl 
Groos 
(Das 
Seelenleben 
des 
Kindes, 
1904); 
Th. 
Heller 
(Grundriss 
der 
Heilpädagogic, 
1904); 
Sully 
(Observations 
Concerning 
Childhood, 
1897). 
The 
best 
impression 
of 
the 
present 
situation 
of 
this 
sphere 
can 
be 
obtained 
from 
the 
journal 
Die 
Kinderfehler 
(issued 
since 
1896). 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
one 
gains 
the 
impression 
that 
the 
existence 
of 
love 
in 
childhood 
is 
in 
no 
need 
of 
demonstration. 
Pérez 
(l.c.) 
speaks 
for 
it; 
K. 
Groos 
(Die 
Spiele 
der 
Menschen, 

1899) 
states 
that 
some 
children 
are 
very 
early 
subject 
to 
sexual 
emotions, 
and 
show 
a 
desire 
to 
touch 
the 
other 
sex 
(p. 
336); 
S. 
Bell 
observed 
the 
earliest 
appearance 
of 
sex-love 
in 
a 
child 
during 
the 
middle 
part 
of 
its 
third 
year. 
See 
also 
Havelock 
Ellis, 
The 
Sexual 
Impulse, 
Appendix 
II. 
The 
above-mentioned 
judgment 
concerning 
the 
literature 
of 
infantile 
sexuality 
no 
longer 
holds 
true 
since 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
great 
and 
important 
work 
of 
G. 
Stanley 
Hall 
(Adolescence, 
Its 
Psychology 
and 
its 
Relation 
to 
Physiology, 
Anthropology, 
Sociology, 
Sex, 
Crime, 
Religion, 
and 
Education, 
2 
vols., 
New 
York, 
1908). 
The 
recent 
book 
of 
A. 
Moll, 
Das 
Sexualleben 
des 
Kindes, 
Berlin, 
1909, 
offers 
no 
occasion 
for 
such 
a 
modification. 
See, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
Bleuler,

A 
book 
by 
Mrs. 
Dr. 
H.v. 
Hug-Hellmuth, 
Aus 
dem 
Seelenleben 
des 
Kindes 
(1913), 
has 
taken 
full 
account 
of 
the 
neglected 
sexual 
factors.

[3] 
I 
have 
attempted 
to 
solve 
the 
problems 
presented 
by 
the 
earliest 
infantile 
recollections 
in 
a 
paper, 
"Über 
Deckerinnerungen" 
(Monatsschrift 
für 
Psychiatrie 
und 
Neurologie, 
VI, 
1899).

One 
cannot 
understand 
the 
mechanism 
of 
repression 
when 
one 
takes 
into 
consideration 
only 
one 
of 
the 
two 
cooperating 
processes. 
As 
a 
comparison 
one 
may 
think 
of 
the 
way 
the 
tourist 
is 
despatched 
to 
the 
top 
of 
the 
great 
pyramid 
of 
Gizeh; 
he 
is 
pushed 
from 
one 
side 
and 
pulled 
from 
the 
other. 
[5] 
The 
use 
of 
the 
latter 
material 
is 
justified 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
years 
of 
childhood 
of 
those 
who 
are 
later 
neurotics 
need 
not 
necessarily 
differ 
from 
those 
who 
are 
later 
normal 
except 
in 
intensity 
and 
distinctness. 
[6] 
An 
anatomic 
analogy 
to 
the 
behavior 
of 
the 
infantile 
sexual 
function 
formulated 
by 
me 
is 
perhaps 
given 
by 
Bayer 
(Deutsches 
Archiv 
für 
klinische 
Medizin, 
Bd. 
73) 
who 
claims 
that 
the 
internal 
genitals 
(uterus) 
are 
regularly 
larger 
in 
newborn 
than 
in 
older 
children. 
However, 
Halban's 
conception, 
that 
after 
birth 
there 
is 
also 
an 
involution 
of 
the 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
sexual 
apparatus, 
has 
not 
been 
verified. 
According 
to 
Halban 
(Zeitschrift 
für 
Geburtshilfe 
u. 
Gynäkologie, 
LIII, 
1904) 
this 
process 
of 
involution 
ends 
after 
a 
few 
weeks 
of 
extra-uterine 
life. 
[7] 
The 
expression 
"sexual 
latency 
period" 
(sexuelle 
latenz-periode) 
I 
have 
borrowed 
from 
W. 
Fliess. 
[8] 
In 
the 
case 
here 
discussed 
the 
sublimation 
of 
the 
sexual 
motive 
powers 

proceed 
on 
the 
road 
of 
reaction 
formations. 
But 
in 
general 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
separate 
from 
each 
other 
sublimation 
and 
reaction 
formation 
as 
two 
diverse 
processes. 
Sublimation 
may 
also 
result 
through 
other 
and 
simpler 
mechanisms.

This 
already 
shows 
what 
holds 
true 
for 
the 
whole 
life, 
namely, 
that 
sexual 
gratification 
is 
the 
best 
hypnotic. 
Most 
nervous 
insomnias 
are 
traced 
to 
lack 
of 
sexual 
gratification. 
It 
is 
also 
known 
that 
unscrupulous 
nurses 
calm 
crying 
children 
to 
sleep 
by 
stroking 
their 
genitals. 
[11] 
Ellis 
spoils, 
however, 
the 
sense 
of 
his 
invented 
term 
by 
comprising 
under 
the 
phenomena 
of 
autoerotism 
the 
whole 
of 
hysteria 
and 
masturbation 
in 
its 
full 
extent. 
[12] 
Further 
reflection 
and 
observation 
lead 
me 
to 
attribute 
the 
quality 
of 
erogenity 
to 
all 
parts 
of 
the 
body 
and 
inner 
organs. 
See 
later 
on 
narcism. 
[13] 
Compare 
here 
the 
very 
comprehensive 
but 
confusing 
literature 
on 
onanism, 
_e.g._, 
Rohleder, 
Die 
Masturbation, 
1899. 
Cf. 
also 
the 
pamphlet, 
"Die 
Onanie," 
which 
contains 
the 
discussion 
of 
the 
Vienna 
Psychoanalytic 
Society, 
Wiesbaden, 
1912.

Unusual 
techniques 
in 
the 
performance 
of 
onanism 
seem 
to 
point 
to 
the 
influence 
of 
a 
prohibition 
against 
onanism 
which 
has 
been 
overcome. 
[16] 
Why 
neurotics, 
when 
conscience 
stricken, 
regularly 
connect 
it 
with 
their 
onanistic 
activity, 
as 
was 
only 
recently 
recognized 
by 
Bleuler, 
is 
a 
problem 
which 
still 
awaits 
an 
exhaustive 
analysis.

Havelock 
Ellis, 
in 
an 
appendix 
to 
his 
study 
on 
the 
Sexual 
Impulse, 
1903, 
gives 
a 
number 
of 
autobiographic 
reports 
of 
normal 
persons 
treating 
their 
first 
sexual 
feelings 
in 
childhood 
and 
the 
causes 
of 
the 
same. 
These 
reports 
naturally 
show 
the 
deficiency 
due 
to 
infantile 
amnesia; 
they 
do 
not 
cover 
the 
prehistoric 
time 
in 
the 
sexual 
life 
and 
therefore 
must 
be 
supplemented 
by 
psychoanalysis 
of 
individuals 
who 
became 
neurotic. 
Notwithstanding 
this 
these 
reports 
are 
valuable 
in 
more 
than 
one 
respect, 
and 
information 
of 
a 

similar 
nature 
has 
urged 
me 
to 
modify 
my 
etiological 
assumption 
as 
mentioned 
in 
the 
text. 


[19] 
The 
above-mentioned 
assertions 
concerning 
the 
infantile 
sexuality 
were 
justified 
in 
1905, 
in 
the 
main 
through 
the 
results 
of 
psychoanalytic 
investigations 
in 
adults. 
Direct 
observation 
of 
the 
child 
could 
not 
at 
the 
time 
be 
utilized 
to 
its 
full 
extent 
and 
resulted 
only 
in 
individual 
indications 
and 
valuable 
confirmations. 
Since 
then 
it 
has 
become 
possible 
through 
the 
analysis 
of 
some 
cases 
of 
nervous 
disease 
in 
the 
delicate 
age 
of 
childhood 
to 
gain 
a 
direct 
understanding 
of 
the 
infantile 
psychosexuality 
(Jahrbuch 
für 
psychoanalytische 
und 
psychopathologische 
Forschungen, 
Bd. 
1, 
2, 
1909). 
I 
can 
point 
with 
satisfaction 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
direct 
observation 
has 
fully 
confirmed 
the 
conclusion 
drawn 
from 
psychoanalysis, 
and 
thus 
furnishes 
good 
evidence 
for 
the 
reliability 
of 
the 
latter 
method 
of 
investigation. 
Moreover, 
the 
"Analysis 
of 
a 
Phobia 
in 
a 
Five-year-old 
Boy" 
(Jahrbuch, 
Bd. 
1) 
has 
taught 
us 
something 
new 
for 
which 
psychoanalysis 
had 
not 
prepared 
us, 
to 
wit, 
that 
sexual 
symbolism, 
the 
representation 
of 
the 
sexual 
by 
nonsexual 
objects 
and 
relations--reaches 
back 
into 
the 
years 
when 
the 
child 
is 
first 
learning 
to 
master 
the 
language. 
My 
attention 
has 
also 
been 
directed 
to 
a 
deficiency 
in 
the 
above-cited 
statement 
which 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
clearness 
described 
any 
conceivable 
separation 
between 
the 
two 
phases 
of 
autoerotism 
and 
object 
love 
as 
a 
temporal 
separation. 
From 
the 
cited 
analysis 
(as 
well 
as 
from 
the 
above-mentioned 
work 
of 
Bell) 
we 
learn 
that 
children 
from 
three 
to 
five 
are 
capable 
of 
evincing 
a 
very 
strong 
object-selection 
which 
is 
accompanied 
by 
strong 
affects. 
[20] 
Some 
persons 
can 
recall 
that 
the 
contact 
of 
the 
moving 
air 
in 
swinging 
caused 
them 
direct 
sexual 
pleasure 
in 
the 
genitals. 
[21] 
"Those 
who 
love 
each 
other 
tease 
each 
other." 
[22] 
The 
analyses 
of 
neurotic 
disturbances 
of 
walking 
and 
of 
agoraphobia 
remove 
all 
doubt 
as 
to 
the 
sexual 
nature 
of 
the 
pleasure 
of 
motion. 
As 
everybody 
knows 
modern 
cultural 
education 
utilizes 
sports 
to 
a 
great 
extent 
in 
order 
to 
turn 
away 
the 
youth 
from 
sexual 
activity; 
it 
would 
be 
more 
proper 
to 
say 
that 
it 
replaces 
the 
sexual 
pleasure 
by 
motion 
pleasure, 
and 
forces 
the 
sexual 
activity 
back 
upon 
one 
of 
its 
autoerotic 
components. 

III 


THE 
TRANSFORMATION 
OF 
PUBERTY 


With 
the 
beginning 
of 
puberty 
the 
changes 
set 
in 
which 
transform 
the 
infantile 
sexual 
life 
into 
its 
definite 
normal 
form. 
Hitherto 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
has 
been 
preponderantly 
autoerotic; 
it 
now 
finds 
the 
sexual 
object. 
Thus 
far 
it 
has 
manifested 
itself 
in 
single 
impulses 
and 
in 
erogenous 
zones 
seeking 
a 
certain 
pleasure 
as 
a 
single 
sexual 
aim. 
A 
new 
sexual 
aim 
now 
appears 
for 
the 
production 
of 
which 
all 
partial 
impulses 
coöperate, 
while 
the 
erogenous 
zones 
subordinate 
themselves 
to 
the 
primacy 
of 
the 
genital 
zone.[1] 
As 
the 
new 
sexual 
aim 
assigns 
very 
different 
functions 
to 
the 
two 
sexes 
their 
sexual 
developments 
now 
part 
company. 
The 
sexual 
development 
of 
the 
man 
is 
more 
consistent 
and 
easier 
to 
understand, 
while 
in 
the 
woman 
there 
even 
appears 
a 
form 
of 
regression. 
The 
normality 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
is 
guaranteed 
only 
by 
the 
exact 
concurrence 
of 
the 
two 
streams 
directed 
to 
the 
sexual 
object 
and 
sexual 
aim. 
It 
is 
like 
the 
piercing 
of 
a 
tunnel 
from 
opposite 
sides. 
The 
new 
sexual 
aim 
in 
the 
man 
consists 
in 
the 
discharging 
of 
the 
sexual 
products; 
it 
is 
not 
contradictory 
to 
the 
former 
sexual 
aim, 
that 
of 
obtaining 
pleasure; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
highest 
amount 
of 
pleasure 
is 
connected 
with 
this 
final 
act 
in 
the 
sexual 
process. 
The 
sexual 
impulse 
now 
enters 
into 
the 
service 
of 
the 
function 
of 
propagation; 
it 
becomes, 
so 
to 
say, 
altruistic. 
If 
this 
transformation 
is 
to 
succeed 
its 
process 
must 
be 
adjusted 
to 
the 
original 
dispositions 
and 
all 
the 
peculiarities 
of 
the 
impulses. 
Just 
as 
on 
every 
other 
occasion 
where 
new 
connections 
and 
compositions 
are 
to 
be 
formed 
in 
complicated 
mechanisms, 
here, 
too, 
there 
is 
a 
possibility 
for 
morbid 
disturbance 
if 
the 
new 
order 
of 
things 
does 
not 
get 
itself 
established. 
All 
morbid 
disturbances 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
may 
justly 
be 
considered 
as 
inhibitions 
of 
development. 
THE 
PRIMACY 
OF 
THE 
GENITAL 
ZONES 
AND 
THE 
FOREPLEASURE 
From 
the 
course 
of 
development 
as 
described 
we 
can 
clearly 
see 
the 
issue 
and 
the 
end 
aim. 
The 
intermediary 
transitions 
are 
still 
quite 
obscure 
and 
many 
a 
riddle 
will 
have 
to 
be 
solved 
in 
them. 
The 
most 
striking 
process 
of 
puberty 
has 
been 
selected 
as 
its 
most 
characteristic; 
it 
is 
the 
manifest 
growth 
of 
the 
external 
genitals 
which 
have 
shown 
a 
relative 
inhibition 
of 
growth 
during 
the 
latency 
period 
of 
childhood. 
Simultaneously 
the 
inner 
genitals 
develop 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
as 
to 
be 
able 
to 
furnish 
sexual 
products 
or 
to 
receive 
them 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
forming 
a 
new 



living 
being. 
A 
most 
complicated 
apparatus 
is 
thus 
formed 
which 
waits 
to 
be 
claimed. 
This 
apparatus 
can 
be 
set 
in 
motion 
by 
stimuli, 
and 
observation 
teaches 
that 
the 
stimuli 
can 
affect 
it 
in 
three 
ways: 
from 
the 
outer 
world 
through 
the 
familiar 
erogenous 
zones; 
from 
the 
inner 
organic 
world 
by 
ways 
still 
to 
be 
investigated; 
and 
from 
the 
psychic 
life, 
which 
merely 
represents 
a 
depository 
of 
external 
impressions 
and 
a 
receptacle 
of 
inner 
excitations. 
The 
same 
result 
follows 
in 
all 
three 
cases, 
namely, 
a 
state 
which 
can 
be 
designated 
as 
"sexual 
excitation" 
and 
which 
manifests 
itself 
in 
psychic 
and 
somatic 
signs. 
The 
psychic 
sign 
consists 
in 
a 
peculiar 
feeling 
of 
tension 
of 
a 
most 
urgent 
character, 
and 
among 
the 
manifold 
somatic 
signs 
the 
many 
changes 
in 
the 
genitals 
stand 
first. 
They 
have 
a 
definite 
meaning, 
that 
of 
readiness; 
they 
constitute 
a 
preparation 
for 
the 
sexual 
act 
(the 
erection 
of 
the 
penis 
and 
the 
glandular 
activity 
of 
the 
vagina). 
*The 
Sexual 
Tension*--The 
character 
of 
the 
tension 
of 
sexual 
excitation 
is 
connected 
with 
a 
problem 
the 
solution 
of 
which 
is 
as 
difficult 
as 
it 
would 
be 
important 
for 
the 
conception 
of 
the 
sexual 
process. 
Despite 
all 
divergence 
of 
opinion 
regarding 
it 
in 
psychology, 
I 
must 
firmly 
maintain 
that 
a 
feeling 
of 
tension 
must 
carry 
with 
it 
the 
character 
of 
displeasure. 
For 
me 
it 
is 
conclusive 
that 
such 
a 
feeling 
carries 
with 
it 
the 
impulse 
to 
alter 
the 
psychic 
situation, 
and 
acts 
incitingly, 
which 
is 
quite 
contrary 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
perceived 
pleasure. 
But 
if 
we 
ascribe 
the 
tension 
of 
the 
sexual 
excitation 
to 
the 
feelings 
of 
displeasure 
we 
encounter 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
is 
undoubtedly 
pleasurably 
perceived. 
The 
tension 
produced 
by 
sexual 
excitation 
is 
everywhere 
accompanied 
by 
pleasure; 
even 
in 
the 
preparatory 
changes 
of 
the 
genitals 
there 
is 
a 
distinct 
feeling 
of 
satisfaction. 
What 
relation 
is 
there 
between 
this 
unpleasant 
tension 
and 
this 
feeling 
of 
pleasure? 
Everything 
relating 
to 
the 
problem 
of 
pleasure 
and 
pain 
touches 
one 
of 
the 
weakest 
spots 
of 
present-day 
psychology. 
We 
shall 
try 
if 
possible 
to 
learn 
something 
from 
the 
determinations 
of 
the 
case 
in 
question 
and 
to 
avoid 
encroaching 
on 
the 
problem 
as 
a 
whole. 
Let 
us 
first 
glance 
at 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
the 
erogenous 
zones 
adjust 
themselves 
to 
the 
new 
order 
of 
things. 
An 
important 
rôle 
devolves 
upon 
them 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
sexual 
excitation. 
The 
eye 
which 
is 
very 
remote 
from 
the 
sexual 
object 
is 
most 
often 
in 
position, 
during 
the 
relations 
of 
object 
wooing, 
to 
become 
attracted 
by 
that 
particular 
quality 
of 
excitation, 
the 
motive 
of 
which 
we 
designate 
as 
beauty 
in 
the 
sexual 
object. 
The 
excellencies 
of 
the 
sexual 
object 
are 
therefore 
also 
called 



"attractions." 
This 
attraction 
is 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
already 
connected 
with 
pleasure, 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
it 
either 
results 
in 
an 
increase 
of 
the 
sexual 
excitation 
or 
in 
an 
evocation 
of 
the 
same 
where 
it 
is 
still 
wanting. 
The 
effect 
is 
the 
same 
if 
the 
excitation 
of 
another 
erogenous 
zone, 
_e.g._, 
the 
touching 
hand, 
is 
added 
to 
it. 
There 
is 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
the 
feeling 
of 
pleasure 
which 
soon 
becomes 
enhanced 
by 
the 
pleasure 
from 
the 
preparatory 
changes, 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
there 
is 
a 
further 
increase 
of 
the 
sexual 
tension 
which 
soon 
changes 
into 
a 
most 
distinct 
feeling 
of 
displeasure 
if 
it 
cannot 
proceed 
to 
more 
pleasure. 
Another 
case 
will 
perhaps 
be 
clearer; 
let 
us, 
for 
example, 
take 
the 
case 
where 
an 
erogenous 
zone, 
like 
a 
woman's 
breast, 
is 
excited 
by 
touching 
in 
a 
person 
who 
is 
not 
sexually 
excited 
at 
the 
time. 
This 
touching 
in 
itself 
evokes 
a 
feeling 
of 
pleasure, 
but 
it 
is 
also 
best 
adapted 
to 
awaken 
sexual 
excitement 
which 
demands 
still 
more 
pleasure. 
How 
it 
happens 
that 
the 
perceived 
pleasure 
evokes 
the 
desire 
for 
greater 
pleasure, 
that 
is 
the 
real 
problem. 
*Fore-pleasure 
Mechanism.*--But 
the 
rôle 
which 
devolves 
upon 
the 
erogenous 
zones 
is 
clear. 
What 
applies 
to 
one 
applies 
to 
all. 
They 
are 
all 
utilized 
to 
furnish 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
pleasure 
through 
their 
own 
proper 
excitation, 
which 
increases 
the 
tension, 
and 
which 
is 
in 
turn 
destined 
to 
produce 
the 
necessary 
motor 
energy 
in 
order 
to 
bring 
to 
a 
conclusion 
the 
sexual 
act. 
The 
last 
part 
but 
one 
of 
this 
act 
is 
again 
a 
suitable 
excitation 
of 
an 
erogenous 
zone; 
_i.e._, 
the 
genital 
zone 
proper 
of 
the 
glans 
penis 
is 
excited 
by 
the 
object 
most 
fit 
for 
it, 
the 
mucous 
membrane 
of 
the 
vagina, 
and 
through 
the 
pleasure 
furnished 
by 
this 
excitation 
it 
now 
produces 
reflexly 
the 
motor 
energy 
which 
conveys 
to 
the 
surface 
the 
sexual 
substance. 
This 
last 
pleasure 
is 
highest 
in 
its 
intensity, 
and 
differs 
from 
the 
earliest 
ones 
in 
its 
mechanism. 
It 
is 
altogether 
produced 
through 
discharge, 
it 
is 
altogether 
gratification 
pleasure 
and 
the 
tension 
of 
the 
libido 
temporarily 
dies 
away 
with 
it. 
It 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
me 
unjustified 
to 
fix 
by 
name 
the 
distinction 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
these 
pleasures, 
the 
one 
through 
the 
excitation 
of 
the 
erogenous 
zones, 
and 
the 
other 
through 
the 
discharge 
of 
the 
sexual 
substance. 
In 
contradistinction 
to 
the 
end-pleasure, 
or 
pleasure 
of 
gratification 
of 
sexual 
activity, 
we 
can 
properly 
designate 
the 
first 
as 
_fore-pleasure_. 
The 
fore-pleasure 
is 
then 
the 
same 
as 
that 
furnished 
by 
the 
infantile 
sexual 
impulse, 
though 
on 
a 
reduced 
scale; 
while 
the 
_end-pleasure_ 
is 
new 
and 
is 
probably 
connected 
with 
determinations 
which 
first 
appear 
at 
puberty. 
The 
formula 
for 
the 
new 
function 
of 
the 
erogenous 
zones 
reads 
as 
follows: 
they 
are 
utilized 
for 
the 



purpose 
of 
making 
possible 
the 
production 
of 
the 
greater 
pleasure 
of 
gratification 
by 
means 
of 
the 
fore-pleasure 
which 
is 
gained 
from 
them 
as 
in 
infantile 
life. 
I 
have 
recently 
been 
able 
to 
elucidate 
another 
example 
from 
a 
quite 
different 
realm 
of 
the 
psychic 
life, 
in 
which 
likewise 
a 
greater 
feeling 
of 
pleasure 
is 
achieved 
by 
means 
of 
a 
lesser 
feeling 
of 
pleasure 
which 
thereby 
acts 
as 
an 
alluring 
premium. 
We 
had 
there 
also 
the 
opportunity 
of 
entering 
more 
deeply 
into 
the 
nature 
of 
pleasure.[2] 
*Dangers 
of 
the 
Fore-pleasure.*--However 
the 
connection 
of 
fore-pleasure 
with 
the 
infantile 
life 
is 
strengthened 
by 
the 
pathogenic 
rôle 
which 
may 
devolve 
upon 
it. 
In 
the 
mechanism 
through 
which 
the 
fore-pleasure 
is 
expressed 
there 
exists 
an 
obvious 
danger 
to 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
normal 
sexual 
aim. 
This 
occurs 
if 
it 
happens 
that 
there 
is 
too 
much 
fore-pleasure 
and 
too 
little 
tension 
in 
any 
part 
of 
the 
preparatory 
sexual 
process. 
The 
motive 
power 
for 
the 
further 
continuation 
of 
the 
sexual 
process 
then 
escapes, 
the 
whole 
road 
becomes 
shortened, 
and 
the 
preparatory 
action 
in 
question 
takes 
the 
place 
of 
the 
normal 
sexual 
aim. 
Experience 
shows 
that 
such 
a 
hurtful 
condition 
is 
determined 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
erogenous 
zone 
concerned 
or 
the 
corresponding 
partial 
impulse 
has 
already 
contributed 
an 
unusual 
amount 
of 
pleasure 
in 
infantile 
life. 
If 
other 
factors 
favoring 
fixation 
are 
added 
a 
compulsion 
readily 
results 
for 
the 
later 
life 
which 
prevents 
the 
fore-pleasure 
from 
arranging 
itself 
into 
a 
new 
combination. 
Indeed, 
the 
mechanism 
of 
many 
perversions 
is 
of 
such 
a 
nature; 
they 
merely 
represent 
a 
lingering 
at 
a 
preparatory 
act 
of 
the 
sexual 
process. 
The 
failure 
of 
the 
function 
of 
the 
sexual 
mechanism 
through 
the 
fault 
of 
the 
fore-pleasure 
is 
generally 
avoided 
if 
the 
primacy 
of 
the 
genital 
zones 
has 
also 
already 
been 
sketched 
out 
in 
infantile 
life. 
The 
preparations 
of 
the 
second 
half 
of 
childhood 
(from 
the 
eighth 
year 
to 
puberty) 
really 
seem 
to 
favor 
this. 
During 
these 
years 
the 
genital 
zones 
behave 
almost 
as 
at 
the 
age 
of 
maturity; 
they 
are 
the 
seat 
of 
exciting 
sensations 
and 
of 
preparatory 
changes 
if 
any 
kind 
of 
pleasure 
is 
experienced 
through 
the 
gratification 
of 
other 
erogenous 
zones; 
although 
this 
effect 
remains 
aimless, 
_i.e._, 
it 
contributes 
nothing 
towards 
the 
continuation 
of 
the 
sexual 
process. 
Besides 
the 
pleasure 
of 
gratification 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
sexual 
tension 
appears 
even 
in 
infancy, 
though 
it 
is 
less 
constant 
and 
less 
abundant. 
We 
can 
now 
understand 
also 
why 
in 
the 
discussion 
of 
the 
sources 
of 
sexuality 
we 
had 
a 
perfectly 
good 
reason 
for 
saying 
that 
the 
process 
in 
question 
acts 
as 
sexual 
gratification 
as 
well 
as 



sexual 
excitement. 
We 
note 
that 
on 
our 
way 
towards 
the 
truth 
we 
have 
at 
first 
enormously 
exaggerated 
the 
distinctions 
between 
the 
infantile 
and 
the 
mature 
sexual 
life, 
and 
we 
therefore 
supplement 
what 
has 
been 
said 
with 
a 
correction. 
The 
infantile 
manifestations 
of 
sexuality 
determine 
not 
only 
the 
deviations 
from 
the 
normal 
sexual 
life 
but 
also 
the 
normal 
formations 
of 
the 
same. 
THE 
PROBLEM 
OF 
SEXUAL 
EXCITEMENT 
It 
remains 
entirely 
unexplained 
whence 
the 
sexual 
tension 
comes 
which 
originates 
simultaneously 
with 
the 
gratification 
of 
erogenous 
zones 
and 
what 
is 
its 
nature. 
The 
obvious 
supposition 
that 
this 
tension 
originates 
in 
some 
way 
from 
the 
pleasure 
itself 
is 
not 
only 
improbable 
in 
itself 
but 
untenable, 
inasmuch 
as 
during 
the 
greatest 
pleasure 
which 
is 
connected 
with 
the 
voiding 
of 
sexual 
substance 
there 
is 
no 
production 
of 
tension 
but 
rather 
a 
removal 
of 
all 
tension. 
Hence, 
pleasure 
and 
sexual 
tension 
can 
be 
only 
indirectly 
connected. 
*The 
Rôle 
of 
the 
Sexual 
Substance.*--Aside 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
only 
the 
discharge 
of 
the 
sexual 
substance 
can 
normally 
put 
an 
end 
to 
the 
sexual 
excitement, 
there 
are 
other 
essential 
facts 
which 
bring 
the 
sexual 
tension 
into 
relation 
with 
the 
sexual 
products. 
In 
a 
life 
of 
continence 
the 
sexual 
activity 
is 
wont 
to 
discharge 
the 
sexual 
substance 
at 
night 
during 
pleasurable 
dream 
hallucinations 
of 
a 
sexual 
act, 
this 
discharge 
coming 
at 
changing 
but 
not 
at 
entirely 
capricious 
intervals; 
and 
the 
following 
interpretation 
of 
this 
process-the 
nocturnal 
pollution--can 
hardly 
be 
rejected, 
viz., 
that 
the 
sexual 
tension 
which 
brings 
about 
a 
substitute 
for 
the 
sexual 
act 
by 
the 
short 
hallucinatory 
road 
is 
a 
function 
of 
the 
accumulated 
semen 
in 
the 
reservoirs 
for 
the 
sexual 
products. 
Experiences 
with 
the 
exhaustibility 
of 
the 
sexual 
mechanism 
speak 
for 
the 
same 
thing. 
Where 
there 
is 
no 
stock 
of 
semen 
it 
is 
not 
only 
impossible 
to 
accomplish 
the 
sexual 
act, 
but 
there 
is 
also 
a 
lack 
of 
excitability 
in 
the 
erogenous 
zones, 
the 
suitable 
excitation 
of 
which 
can 
evoke 
no 
pleasure. 
We 
thus 
discover 
incidentally 
that 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
sexual 
tension 
is 
itself 
necessary 
for 
the 
excitability 
of 
the 
erogenous 
zones. 
One 
would 
thus 
be 
forced 
to 
the 
assumption, 
which 
if 
I 
am 
not 
mistaken 
is 
quite 
generally 
adopted, 
that 
the 
accumulation 
of 
sexual 
substance 
produces 
and 
maintains 
the 
sexual 
tension. 
The 
pressure 
of 
these 
products 
on 
the 
walls 
of 
their 
receptacles 
acts 
as 
an 
excitant 
on 
the 
spinal 
center, 
the 
state 
of 
which 
is 
then 
perceived 
by 
the 
higher 
centers 
which 
then 
produce 
in 
consciousness 
the 
familiar 
feeling 
of 
tension. 
If 
the 
excitation 
of 
erogenous 
zones 
increases 



the 
sexual 
tension, 
it 
can 
only 
be 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
erogenous 
zones 
are 
connected 
with 
these 
centers 
by 
previously 
formed 
anatomical 
connections. 
They 
increase 
there 
the 
tone 
of 
the 
excitation, 
and 
with 
sufficient 
sexual 
tension 
they 
set 
in 
motion 
the 
sexual 
act, 
and 
with 
insufficient 
tension 
they 
merely 
stimulate 
a 
production 
of 
the 
sexual 
substance. 
The 
weakness 
of 
the 
theory 
which 
one 
finds 
adopted, 
_e.g._, 
in 
v. 
KrafftEbing's 
description 
of 
the 
sexual 
process, 
lies 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
has 
been 
formed 
for 
the 
sexual 
activity 
of 
the 
mature 
man 
and 
pays 
too 
little 
heed 
to 
three 
kinds 
of 
relations 
which 
should 
also 
have 
been 
elucidated. 
We 
refer 
to 
the 
relations 
as 
found 
in 
the 
child, 
in 
the 
woman, 
and 
in 
the 
castrated 
male. 
In 
none 
of 
the 
three 
cases 
can 
we 
speak 
of 
an 
accumulation 
of 
sexual 
products 
in 
the 
same 
sense 
as 
in 
the 
man, 
which 
naturally 
renders 
difficult 
the 
general 
application 
of 
this 
scheme; 
still 
it 
may 
be 
admitted 
without 
any 
further 
ado 
that 
ways 
can 
be 
found 
to 
justify 
the 
subordination 
of 
even 
these 
cases. 
Nevertheless 
one 
should 
be 
cautious 
about 
burdening 
the 
factor 
of 
accumulation 
of 
sexual 
products 
with 
actions 
which 
it 
seems 
incapable 
of 
supporting. 
*Overestimation 
of 
the 
Internal 
Genitals.*--That 
sexual 
excitement 
can 
be 
independent 
to 
a 
considerable 
extent 
of 
the 
production 
of 
sexual 
substance 
seems 
to 
be 
shown 
by 
observations 
on 
castrated 
males, 
in 
whom 
the 
libido 
sometimes 
escapes 
the 
injury 
caused 
by 
the 
operation, 
although 
the 
opposite 
behavior, 
which 
is 
really 
the 
motive 
for 
the 
operation, 
is 
usually 
the 
rule. 
It 
is 
therefore 
not 
at 
all 
surprising, 
as 
C. 
Rieger 
puts 
it, 
that 
the 
loss 
of 
the 
male 
germ 
glands 
in 
maturer 
age 
should 
exert 
no 
new 
influence 
on 
the 
psychic 
life 
of 
the 
individual. 
The 
germ 
glands 
are 
really 
not 
the 
sexuality, 
and 
the 
experience 
with 
castrated 
males 
only 
verifies 
what 
we 
had 
long 
before 
learned 
from 
the 
removal 
of 
the 
ovaries, 
namely 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
do 
away 
with 
the 
sexual 
character 
by 
removing 
the 
germ 
glands. 
To 
be 
sure, 
castration 
performed 
at 
a 
tender 
age, 
before 
puberty, 
comes 
nearer 
to 
this 
aim, 
but 
it 
would 
seem 
in 
this 
case 
that 
besides 
the 
loss 
of 
the 
sexual 
glands 
we 
must 
also 
consider 
the 
inhibition 
of 
development 
and 
other 
factors 
which 
are 
connected 
with 
that 
loss. 
*Chemical 
Theories.*--The 
truth 
remains, 
however, 
that 
we 
are 
unable 
to 
give 
any 
information 
about 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
sexual 
excitement 
for 
the 
reason 
that 
we 
do 
not 
know 
with 
what 
organ 
or 
organs 
sexuality 
is 
connected, 
since 
we 
have 
seen 
that 
the 
sexual 
glands 
have 
been 
overestimated 
in 
this 
significance. 
Since 
surprising 
discoveries 
have 
taught 
us 
the 
important 
rôle 
of 



the 
thyroid 
gland 
in 
sexuality, 
we 
may 
assume 
that 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
essential 
factors 
of 
sexuality 
are 
still 
withheld 
from 
us. 
One 
who 
feels 
the 
need 
of 
filling 
up 
the 
large 
gap 
in 
our 
knowledge 
with 
a 
preliminary 
assumption 
may 
formulate 
for 
himself 
the 
following 
theory 
based 
on 
the 
active 
substances 
found 
in 
the 
thyroid. 
Through 
the 
appropriate 
excitement 
of 
erogenous 
zones, 
as 
well 
as 
through 
other 
conditions 
under 
which 
sexual 
excitement 
originates, 
a 
material 
which 
is 
universally 
distributed 
in 
the 
organism 
becomes 
disintegrated, 
the 
decomposing 
products 
of 
which 
supply 
a 
specific 
stimulus 
to 
the 
organs 
of 
reproduction 
or 
to 
the 
spinal 
center 
connected 
with 
them. 
Such 
a 
transformation 
of 
a 
toxic 
stimulus 
in 
a 
particular 
organic 
stimulus 
we 
are 
already 
familiar 
with 
from 
other 
toxic 
products 
introduced 
into 
the 
body 
from 
without. 
To 
treat, 
if 
only 
hypothetically, 
the 
complexities 
of 
the 
pure 
toxic 
and 
the 
physiologic 
stimulations 
which 
result 
in 
the 
sexual 
processes 
is 
not 
now 
our 
appropriate 
task. 
To 
be 
sure, 
I 
attach 
no 
value 
to 
this 
special 
assumption 
and 
I 
shall 
be 
quite 
ready 
to 
give 
it 
up 
in 
favor 
of 
another, 
provided 
its 
original 
character, 
the 
emphasis 
on 
the 
sexual 
chemism, 
were 
preserved. 
For 
this 
apparently 
arbitrary 
statement 
is 
supported 
by 
a 
fact 
which, 
though 
little 
heeded, 
is 
most 
noteworthy. 
The 
neuroses 
which 
can 
be 
traced 
only 
to 
disturbances 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
show 
the 
greatest 
clinical 
resemblance 
to 
the 
phenomena 
of 
intoxication 
and 
abstinence 
which 
result 
from 
the 
habitual 
introduction 
of 
pleasure-producing 
poisonous 
substances 
(alkaloids.) 
THE 
THEORY 
OF 
THE 
LIBIDO 
These 
assumptions 
concerning 
the 
chemical 
basis 
of 
the 
sexual 
excitement 
are 
in 
full 
accord 
with 
the 
auxiliary 
conception 
which 
we 
formed 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
mastering 
the 
psychic 
manifestations 
of 
the 
sexual 
life. 
We 
have 
determined 
the 
concept 
of 
libido 
as 
that 
of 
a 
force 
of 
variable 
quantity 
which 
has 
the 
capacity 
of 
measuring 
processes 
and 
transformations 
in 
the 
spheres 
of 
sexual 
excitement. 
This 
libido 
we 
distinguished 
from 
the 
energy 
which 
is 
to 
be 
generally 
adjudged 
to 
the 
psychic 
processes 
with 
reference 
to 
its 
special 
origin 
and 
thus 
we 
attribute 
to 
it 
also 
a 
qualitative 
character. 
In 
separating 
libidinous 
from 
other 
psychic 
energy 
we 
give 
expression 
to 
the 
assumption 
that 
the 
sexual 
processes 
of 
the 
organism 
are 
differentiated 
from 
the 
nutritional 
processes 
through 
a 
special 
chemism. 
The 
analyses 
of 
perversions 
and 
psychoneuroses 
have 
taught 
us 
that 
this 
sexual 
excitement 
is 
furnished 
not 
only 
from 
the 
so-called 
sexual 
parts 
alone 
but 
from 
all 
organs 
of 
the 
body. 
We 
thus 
formulate 
for 
ourselves 
the 
concept 
of 
a 
libido-quantum 
whose 



psychic 
representative 
we 
designate 
as 
the 
ego-libido; 
the 
production, 
increase, 
distribution 
and 
displacement 
of 
this 
ego-libido 
will 
offer 
the 
possible 
explanation 
for 
the 
observed 
psycho-sexual 
phenomena. 
But 
this 
ego-libido 
becomes 
conveniently 
accessible 
to 
psychoanalytic 
study 
only 
when 
the 
psychic 
energy 
is 
employed 
on 
sexual 
objects, 
that 
is 
when 
it 
becomes 
object 
libido. 
Then 
we 
see 
it 
as 
it 
concentrates 
and 
fixes 
itself 
on 
objects, 
or 
as 
it 
leaves 
those 
objects 
and 
passes 
over 
to 
others 
from 
which 
positions 
it 
directs 
the 
individual's 
sexual 
activity, 
that 
is, 
it 
leads 
to 
partial 
and 
temporary 
extinction 
of 
the 
libido. 
Psychoanalysis 
of 
the 
so-called 
transference 
neuroses 
(hysteria 
and 
compulsion 
neurosis) 
offers 
us 
here 
a 
reliable 
insight. 
Concerning 
the 
fates 
of 
the 
object 
libido 
we 
also 
state 
that 
it 
is 
withdrawn 
from 
the 
object, 
that 
it 
is 
preserved 
floating 
in 
special 
states 
of 
tension 
and 
is 
finally 
taken 
back 
into 
the 
ego, 
so 
that 
it 
again 
becomes 
ego-libido. 
In 
contradistinction 
to 
the 
object-libido 
we 
also 
call 
the 
ego-libido 
narcissistic 
libido. 
From 
psychoanalysis 
we 
look 
over 
the 
boundary 
which 
we 
are 
not 
permitted 
to 
pass 
into 
the 
activity 
of 
the 
narcissistic 
libido 
and 
thus 
form 
an 
idea 
of 
the 
relations 
between 
the 
two. 
The 
narcissistic 
or 
ego-libido 
appears 
to 
us 
as 
the 
great 
reservoir 
from 
which 
the 
energy 
for 
the 
investment 
of 
the 
object 
is 
sent 
out 
and 
into 
which 
it 
is 
drawn 
back 
again, 
while 
the 
narcissistic 
libido 
investment 
of 
the 
ego 
appears 
to 
us 
as 
the 
realized 
primitive 
state 
in 
the 
first 
childhood, 
which 
only 
becomes 
hidden 
by 
the 
later 
emissions 
of 
the 
libido, 
and 
is 
retained 
at 
the 
bottom 
behind 
them. 
The 
task 
of 
a 
theory 
of 
libido 
of 
neurotic 
and 
psychotic 
disturbances 
would 
have 
for 
its 
object 
to 
express 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
libido-economy 
all 
observed 
phenomena 
and 
disclosed 
processes. 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
divine 
that 
the 
greater 
significance 
would 
attach 
thereby 
to 
the 
destinies 
of 
the 
ego-libido, 
especially 
where 
it 
would 
be 
the 
question 
of 
explaining 
the 
deeper 
psychotic 
disturbances. 
The 
difficulty 
then 
lies 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
means 
of 
our 
investigation, 
psychoanalysis, 
at 
present 
gives 
us 
definite 
information 
only 
concerning 
the 
transformation 
of 
the 
object-libido, 
but 
cannot 
distinguish 
without 
further 
study 
the 
ego-libido 
from 
the 
other 
effective 
energies 
in 
the 
ego.[3] 
DIFFERENTIATION 
BETWEEN 
MAN 
AND 
WOMAN 
It 
is 
known 
that 
the 
sharp 
differentiation 
of 
the 
male 
and 
female 
character 
originates 
at 
puberty, 
and 
it 
is 
the 
resulting 
difference 
which, 
more 
than 
any 
other 
factor, 
decisively 
influences 
the 
later 
development 
of 
personality. 
To 
be 



sure, 
the 
male 
and 
female 
dispositions 
are 
easily 
recognizable 
even 
in 
infantile 
life; 
thus 
the 
development 
of 
sexual 
inhibitions 
(shame, 
loathing, 
sympathy, 
etc.) 
ensues 
earlier 
and 
with 
less 
resistance 
in 
the 
little 
girl 
than 
in 
the 
little 
boy. 
The 
tendency 
to 
sexual 
repression 
certainly 
seems 
much 
greater, 
and 
where 
partial 
impulses 
of 
sexuality 
are 
noticed 
they 
show 
a 
preference 
for 
the 
passive 
form. 
But, 
the 
autoerotic 
activity 
of 
the 
erogenous 
zones 
is 
the 
same 
in 
both 
sexes, 
and 
it 
is 
this 
agreement 
that 
removes 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
sex 
differentiation 
in 
childhood 
as 
it 
appears 
after 
puberty. 
In 
respect 
to 
the 
autoerotic 
and 
masturbatic 
sexual 
manifestations, 
it 
may 
be 
asserted 
that 
the 
sexuality 
of 
the 
little 
girl 
has 
entirely 
a 
male 
character. 
Indeed, 
if 
one 
could 
give 
a 
more 
definite 
content 
to 
the 
terms 
"masculine 
and 
feminine," 
one 
might 
advance 
the 
opinion 
that 
_the 
libido 
is 
regularly 
and 
lawfully 
of 
a 
masculine 
nature, 
whether 
in 
the 
man 
or 
in 
the 
woman; 
and 
if 
we 
consider 
its 
object, 
this 
may 
be 
either 
the 
man 
or 
the 
woman_.[4] 
Since 
becoming 
acquainted 
with 
the 
aspect 
of 
bisexuality 
I 
hold 
this 
factor 
as 
here 
decisive, 
and 
I 
believe 
that 
without 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
factor 
of 
bisexuality 
it 
will 
hardly 
be 
possible 
to 
understand 
the 
actually 
observed 
sexual 
manifestations 
in 
man 
and 
woman. 
*The 
Leading 
Zones 
in 
Man 
and 
Woman.*--Further 
than 
this 
I 
can 
only 
add 
the 
following. 
The 
chief 
erogenous 
zone 
in 
the 
female 
child 
is 
the 
clitoris, 
which 
is 
homologous 
to 
the 
male 
penis. 
All 
I 
have 
been 
able 
to 
discover 
concerning 
masturbation 
in 
little 
girls 
concerned 
the 
clitoris 
and 
not 
those 
other 
external 
genitals 
which 
are 
so 
important 
for 
the 
later 
sexual 
functions. 
With 
few 
exceptions 
I 
myself 
doubt 
whether 
the 
female 
child 
can 
be 
seduced 
to 
anything 
but 
clitoris 
masturbation. 
The 
frequent 
spontaneous 
discharges 
of 
sexual 
excitement 
in 
little 
girls 
manifest 
themselves 
in 
a 
twitching 
of 
the 
clitoris, 
and 
its 
frequent 
erections 
enable 
the 
girl 
to 
understand 
correctly 
even 
without 
any 
instruction 
the 
sexual 
manifestations 
of 
the 
other 
sex; 
they 
simply 
transfer 
to 
the 
boys 
the 
sensations 
of 
their 
own 
sexual 
processes. 
If 
one 
wishes 
to 
understand 
how 
the 
little 
girl 
becomes 
a 
woman, 
he 
must 
follow 
up 
the 
further 
destinies 
of 
this 
clitoris 
excitation. 
Puberty, 
which 
brings 
to 
the 
boy 
a 
great 
advance 
of 
libido, 
distinguishes 
itself 
in 
the 
girl 
by 
a 
new 
wave 
of 
repression 
which 
especially 
concerns 
the 
clitoris 
sexuality. 
It 
is 
a 
part 
of 
the 
male 
sexual 
life 
that 
sinks 
into 
repression. 
The 
reënforcement 
of 
the 
sexual 
inhibitions 
produced 
in 
the 
woman 
by 
the 
repression 
of 
puberty 
causes 
a 
stimulus 
in 
the 
libido 
of 
the 
man 
and 
forces 
it 
to 
increase 
its 
capacity; 
with 
the 
height 
of 
the 
libido 
there 
is 
a 
rise 
in 
the 
overestimation 
of 



the 
sexual, 
which 
can 
be 
present 
in 
its 
full 
force 
only 
when 
the 
woman 
refuses 
and 
denies 
her 
sexuality. 
If 
the 
sexual 
act 
is 
finally 
submitted 
to 
and 
the 
clitoris 
becomes 
excited 
its 
rôle 
is 
then 
to 
conduct 
the 
excitement 
to 
the 
adjacent 
female 
parts, 
and 
in 
this 
it 
acts 
like 
a 
chip 
of 
pine 
wood 
which 
is 
utilized 
to 
set 
fire 
to 
the 
harder 
wood. 
It 
often 
takes 
some 
time 
for 
this 
transference 
to 
be 
accomplished; 
during 
which 
the 
young 
wife 
remains 
anesthetic. 
This 
anesthesia 
may 
become 
permanent 
if 
the 
clitoris 
zone 
refuses 
to 
give 
up 
its 
excitability; 
a 
condition 
brought 
on 
by 
abundant 
activities 
in 
infantile 
life. 
It 
is 
known 
that 
anesthesia 
in 
women 
is 
often 
only 
apparent 
and 
local. 
They 
are 
anesthetic 
at 
the 
vaginal 
entrance 
but 
not 
at 
all 
unexcitable 
through 
the 
clitoris 
or 
even 
through 
other 
zones. 
Besides 
these 
erogenous 
causes 
of 
anesthesia 
there 
are 
also 
psychic 
causes 
likewise 
determined 
by 
the 
repression. 
If 
the 
transference 
of 
the 
erogenous 
excitability 
from 
the 
clitoris 
to 
the 
vagina 
has 
succeeded, 
the 
woman 
has 
thus 
changed 
her 
leading 
zone 
for 
the 
future 
sexual 
activity; 
the 
man 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
retains 
his 
from 
childhood. 
The 
main 
determinants 
for 
the 
woman's 
preference 
for 
the 
neuroses, 
especially 
for 
hysteria, 
lie 
in 
this 
change 
of 
the 
leading 
zone 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
repression 
of 
puberty. 
These 
determinants 
are 
therefore 
most 
intimately 
connected 
with 
the 
nature 
of 
femininity. 
THE 
OBJECT-FINDING 
While 
the 
primacy 
of 
the 
genital 
zones 
is 
being 
established 
through 
the 
processes 
of 
puberty, 
and 
the 
erected 
penis 
in 
the 
man 
imperiously 
points 
towards 
the 
new 
sexual 
aim, 
_i.e._, 
towards 
the 
penetration 
of 
a 
cavity 
which 
excites 
the 
genital 
zone, 
the 
object-finding, 
for 
which 
also 
preparations 
have 
been 
made 
since 
early 
childhood, 
becomes 
consummated 
on 
the 
psychic 
side. 
While 
the 
very 
incipient 
sexual 
gratifications 
are 
still 
connected 
with 
the 
taking 
of 
nourishment, 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
has 
a 
sexual 
object 
outside 
its 
own 
body 
in 
his 
mother's 
breast. 
This 
object 
it 
loses 
later, 
perhaps 
at 
the 
very 
time 
when 
it 
becomes 
possible 
for 
the 
child 
to 
form 
a 
general 
picture 
of 
the 
person 
to 
whom 
the 
organ 
granting 
him 
the 
gratification 
belongs. 
The 
sexual 
impulse 
later 
regularly 
becomes 
autoerotic, 
and 
only 
after 
overcoming 
the 
latency 
period 
is 
there 
a 
resumption 
of 
the 
original 
relation. 
It 
is 
not 
without 
good 
reason 
that 
the 
suckling 
of 
the 
child 
at 
its 
mother's 
breast 
has 
become 
a 
model 
for 
every 
amour. 
The 
object-finding 
is 
really 
a 
re-finding.[5] 
*The 
Sexual 
Object 
of 
the 
Nursing 
Period.*--However, 
even 
after 
the 
separation 
of 
the 
sexual 
activity 
from 
the 
taking 
of 
nourishment, 
there 
still 



remains 
from 
this 
first 
and 
most 
important 
of 
all 
sexual 
relations 
an 
important 
share, 
which 
prepares 
the 
object 
selection 
and 
assists 
in 
reestablishing 
the 
lost 
happiness. 
Throughout 
the 
latency 
period 
the 
child 
learns 
to 
love 
other 
persons 
who 
assist 
it 
in 
its 
helplessness 
and 
gratify 
its 
wants; 
all 
this 
follows 
the 
model 
and 
is 
a 
continuation 
of 
the 
child's 
infantile 
relations 
to 
his 
wet 
nurse. 
One 
may 
perhaps 
hesitate 
to 
identify 
the 
tender 
feelings 
and 
esteem 
of 
the 
child 
for 
his 
foster-parents 
with 
sexual 
love; 
I 
believe, 
however, 
that 
a 
more 
thorough 
psychological 
investigation 
will 
establish 
this 
identity 
beyond 
any 
doubt. 
The 
intercourse 
between 
the 
child 
and 
its 
foster-parents 
is 
for 
the 
former 
an 
inexhaustible 
source 
of 
sexual 
excitation 
and 
gratification 
of 
erogenous 
zones, 
especially 
since 
the 
parents--or 
as 
a 
rule 
the 
mother-supplies 
the 
child 
with 
feelings 
which 
originate 
from 
her 
own 
sexual 
life; 
she 
pats 
it, 
kisses 
it, 
and 
rocks 
it, 
plainly 
taking 
it 
as 
a 
substitute 
for 
a 
full-valued 
sexual 
object.[6] 
The 
mother 
would 
probably 
be 
terrified 
if 
it 
were 
explained 
to 
her 
that 
all 
her 
tenderness 
awakens 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
of 
her 
child 
and 
prepares 
its 
future 
intensity. 
She 
considers 
her 
actions 
as 
asexually 
"pure" 
love, 
for 
she 
carefully 
avoids 
causing 
more 
irritation 
to 
the 
genitals 
of 
the 
child 
than 
is 
indispensable 
in 
caring 
for 
the 
body. 
But 
as 
we 
know 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
is 
not 
awakened 
by 
the 
excitation 
of 
genital 
zones 
alone. 
What 
we 
call 
tenderness 
will 
some 
day 
surely 
manifest 
its 
influence 
on 
the 
genital 
zones 
also. 
If 
the 
mother 
better 
understood 
the 
high 
significance 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
for 
the 
whole 
psychic 
life 
and 
for 
all 
ethical 
and 
psychic 
activities, 
the 
enlightenment 
would 
spare 
her 
all 
reproaches. 
By 
teaching 
the 
child 
to 
love 
she 
only 
fulfills 
her 
function; 
for 
the 
child 
should 
become 
a 
fit 
man 
with 
energetic 
sexual 
needs, 
and 
accomplish 
in 
life 
all 
that 
the 
impulse 
urges 
the 
man 
to 
do. 
Of 
course, 
too 
much 
parental 
tenderness 
becomes 
harmful 
because 
it 
accelerates 
the 
sexual 
maturity, 
and 
also 
because 
it 
"spoils" 
the 
child 
and 
makes 
it 
unfit 
to 
temporarily 
renounce 
love 
or 
be 
satisfied 
with 
a 
smaller 
amount 
of 
love 
in 
later 
life. 
One 
of 
the 
surest 
premonitions 
of 
later 
nervousness 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
child 
shows 
itself 
insatiable 
in 
its 
demands 
for 
parental 
tenderness; 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
neuropathic 
parents, 
who 
usually 
display 
a 
boundless 
tenderness, 
often 
with 
their 
caressing 
awaken 
in 
the 
child 
a 
disposition 
for 
neurotic 
diseases. 
This 
example 
at 
least 
shows 
that 
neuropathic 
parents 
have 
nearer 
ways 
than 
inheritance 
by 
which 
they 
can 
transfer 
their 
disturbances 
to 
their 
children. 
*Infantile 
Fear.*--The 
children 
themselves 
behave 
from 
their 
early 
childhood 
as 
if 
their 
attachment 
to 
their 
foster-parents 
were 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
sexual 
love. 



The 
fear 
of 
children 
is 
originally 
nothing 
but 
an 
expression 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
miss 
the 
beloved 
person. 
They 
therefore 
meet 
every 
stranger 
with 
fear, 
they 
are 
afraid 
of 
the 
dark 
because 
they 
cannot 
see 
the 
beloved 
person, 
and 
are 
calmed 
if 
they 
can 
grasp 
that 
person's 
hand. 
The 
effect 
of 
childish 
fears 
and 
of 
the 
terrifying 
stories 
told 
by 
nurses 
is 
overestimated 
if 
one 
blames 
the 
latter 
for 
producing 
the 
fear 
in 
children. 
Children 
who 
are 
predisposed 
to 
fear 
absorb 
these 
stories, 
which 
make 
no 
impression 
whatever 
upon 
others; 
and 
only 
such 
children 
are 
predisposed 
to 
fear 
whose 
sexual 
impulse 
is 
excessive 
or 
prematurely 
developed, 
or 
has 
become 
exigent 
through 
pampering. 
The 
child 
behaves 
here 
like 
the 
adult, 
that 
is, 
it 
changes 
its 
libido 
into 
fear 
when 
it 
cannot 
bring 
it 
to 
gratification, 
and 
the 
grown-up 
who 
becomes 
neurotic 
on 
account 
of 
ungratified 
libido 
behaves 
in 
his 
anxiety 
like 
a 
child; 
he 
fears 
when 
he 
is 
alone, 
_i.e._, 
without 
a 
person 
of 
whose 
love 
he 
believes 
himself 
sure, 
and 
who 
can 
calm 
his 
fears 
by 
means 
of 
the 
most 
childish 
measures.[7] 
*Incest 
Barriers.*--If 
the 
tenderness 
of 
the 
parents 
for 
the 
child 
has 
luckily 
failed 
to 
awaken 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
of 
the 
child 
prematurely, 
_i.e._, 
before 
the 
physical 
determinations 
for 
puberty 
appear, 
and 
if 
that 
awakening 
has 
not 
gone 
so 
far 
as 
to 
cause 
an 
unmistakable 
breaking 
through 
of 
the 
psychic 
excitement 
into 
the 
genital 
system, 
it 
can 
then 
fulfill 
its 
task 
and 
direct 
the 
child 
at 
the 
age 
of 
maturity 
in 
the 
selection 
of 
the 
sexual 
object. 
It 
would, 
of 
course, 
be 
most 
natural 
for 
the 
child 
to 
select 
as 
the 
sexual 
object 
that 
person 
whom 
it 
has 
loved 
since 
childhood 
with, 
so 
to 
speak, 
a 
suppressed 
libido.[8] 
But 
owing 
to 
the 
delay 
of 
sexual 
maturity 
time 
has 
been 
gained 
for 
the 
erection 
beside 
the 
sexual 
inhibitions 
of 
the 
incest 
barrier, 
that 
moral 
prescription 
which 
explicitly 
excludes 
from 
the 
object 
selection 
the 
beloved 
person 
of 
infancy 
or 
blood 
relation. 
The 
observance 
of 
this 
barrier 
is 
above 
all 
a 
demand 
of 
cultural 
society 
which 
must 
guard 
against 
the 
absorption 
by 
the 
family 
of 
those 
interests 
which 
it 
needs 
for 
the 
production 
of 
higher 
social 
units. 
Society, 
therefore, 
uses 
every 
means 
to 
loosen 
those 
family 
ties 
in 
every 
individual, 
especially 
in 
the 
boy, 
which 
are 
authoritative 
in 
childhood 
only.[9] 
The 
object 
selection, 
however, 
is 
first 
accomplished 
in 
the 
imagination, 
and 
the 
sexual 
life 
of 
the 
maturing 
youth 
has 
hardly 
any 
escape 
except 
indulgence 
in 
phantasies 
or 
ideas 
which 
are 
not 
destined 
to 
be 
brought 
to 
execution. 
In 
the 
phantasies 
of 
all 
persons 
the 
infantile 
inclinations, 
now 
reënforced 
by 
somatic 
emphasis, 
reappear, 
and 
among 
them 
one 
finds 
in 
regular 
frequency 
and 
in 
the 
first 
place 
the 
sexual 
feeling 
of 
the 
child 
for 
the 
parents. 
This 
has 



usually 
already 
been 
differentiated 
by 
the 
sexual 
attraction, 
the 
attraction 
of 
the 
son 
for 
the 
mother 
and 
of 
the 
daughter 
for 
the 
father.[10] 
Simultaneously 
with 
the 
overcoming 
and 
rejection 
of 
these 
distinctly 
incestuous 
phantasies 
there 
occurs 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
as 
well 
as 
one 
of 
the 
most 
painful 
psychic 
accomplishments 
of 
puberty; 
it 
is 
the 
breaking 
away 
from 
the 
parental 
authority, 
through 
which 
alone 
is 
formed 
that 
opposition 
between 
the 
new 
and 
old 
generations 
which 
is 
so 
important 
for 
cultural 
progress. 
Many 
persons 
are 
detained 
at 
each 
of 
the 
stations 
in 
the 
course 
of 
development 
through 
which 
the 
individual 
must 
pass; 
and 
accordingly 
there 
are 
persons 
who 
never 
overcome 
the 
parental 
authority 
and 
never, 
or 
very 
imperfectly, 
withdraw 
their 
affection 
from 
their 
parents. 
They 
are 
mostly 
girls, 
who, 
to 
the 
delight 
of 
their 
parents, 
retain 
their 
full 
infantile 
love 
far 
beyond 
puberty, 
and 
it 
is 
instructive 
to 
find 
that 
in 
their 
married 
life 
these 
girls 
are 
incapable 
of 
fulfilling 
their 
duties 
to 
their 
husbands. 
They 
make 
cold 
wives 
and 
remain 
sexually 
anesthetic. 
This 
shows 
that 
the 
apparently 
non-sexual 
love 
for 
the 
parents 
and 
the 
sexual 
love 
are 
nourished 
from 
the 
same 
source, 
_i.e._, 
that 
the 
first 
merely 
corresponds 
to 
an 
infantile 
fixation 
of 
the 
libido. 
The 
nearer 
we 
come 
to 
the 
deeper 
disturbances 
of 
the 
psychosexual 
development 
the 
more 
easily 
we 
can 
recognize 
the 
evident 
significance 
of 
the 
incestuous 
object-selection. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
sexual 
rejection 
there 
remains 
in 
the 
unconscious 
of 
the 
psychoneurotic 
a 
great 
part 
or 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
psychosexual 
activity 
for 
object 
finding. 
Girls 
with 
an 
excessive 
need 
for 
affection 
and 
an 
equal 
horror 
for 
the 
real 
demands 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
experience 
an 
uncontrollable 
temptation 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
to 
realize 
in 
life 
the 
ideal 
of 
the 
asexual 
love 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
to 
conceal 
their 
libido 
under 
an 
affection 
which 
they 
may 
manifest 
without 
self 
reproach; 
this 
they 
do 
by 
clinging 
for 
life 
to 
the 
infantile 
attraction 
for 
their 
parents 
or 
brothers 
or 
sisters 
which 
has 
been 
repressed 
in 
puberty. 
With 
the 
help 
of 
the 
symptoms 
and 
other 
morbid 
manifestations, 
psychoanalysis 
can 
trace 
their 
unconscious 
thoughts 
and 
translate 
them 
into 
the 
conscious, 
and 
thus 
easily 
show 
to 
such 
persons 
that 
they 
are 
in 
love 
with 
their 
consanguinous 
relations 
in 
the 
popular 
meaning 
of 
the 
term. 
Likewise 
when 
a 
once 
healthy 
person 
falls 
sick 
after 
an 
unhappy 
love 
affair, 
the 
mechanism 
of 
the 
disease 
can 
distinctly 
be 
explained 
as 
a 
return 
of 
his 
libido 
to 
the 
persons 
preferred 
in 
his 
infancy. 
*The 
After 
Effects 
of 
the 
Infantile 
Object 
Selection.*--Even 
those 
who 
have 
happily 
eluded 
the 
incestuous 
fixation 
of 
their 
libido 
have 
not 
completely 
escaped 
its 
influence. 
It 
is 
a 
distinct 
echo 
of 
this 
phase 
of 
development 
that 



the 
first 
serious 
love 
of 
the 
young 
man 
is 
often 
for 
a 
mature 
woman 
and 
that 
of 
the 
girl 
for 
an 
older 
man 
equipped 
with 
authority--_i.e._, 
for 
persons 
who 
can 
revive 
in 
them 
the 
picture 
of 
the 
mother 
and 
father. 
Generally 
speaking 
object 
selection 
unquestionably 
takes 
place 
by 
following 
more 
freely 
these 
prototypes. 
The 
man 
seeks 
above 
all 
the 
memory 
picture 
of 
his 
mother 
as 
it 
has 
dominated 
him 
since 
the 
beginning 
of 
childhood; 
this 
is 
quite 
consistent 
with 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
mother, 
if 
still 
living, 
strives 
against 
this, 
her 
renewal, 
and 
meets 
it 
with 
hostility. 
In 
view 
of 
this 
significance 
of 
the 
infantile 
relation 
to 
the 
parents 
for 
the 
later 
selection 
of 
the 
sexual 
object, 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
understand 
that 
every 
disturbance 
of 
this 
infantile 
relation 
brings 
to 
a 
head 
the 
most 
serious 
results 
for 
the 
sexual 
life 
after 
puberty. 
Jealousy 
of 
the 
lover, 
too, 
never 
lacks 
the 
infantile 
sources 
or 
at 
least 
the 
infantile 
reinforcement. 
Quarrels 
between 
parents 
and 
unhappy 
marital 
relations 
between 
the 
same 
determine 
the 
severest 
predispositions 
for 
disturbed 
sexual 
development 
or 
neurotic 
diseases 
in 
the 
children. 
The 
infantile 
desire 
for 
the 
parents 
is, 
to 
be 
sure, 
the 
most 
important, 
but 
not 
the 
only 
trace 
revived 
in 
puberty 
which 
points 
the 
way 
to 
the 
object 
selection. 
Other 
dispositions 
of 
the 
same 
origin 
permit 
the 
man, 
still 
supported 
by 
his 
infancy, 
to 
develop 
more 
than 
one 
single 
sexual 
series 
and 
to 
form 
different 
determinations 
for 
the 
object 
selection.[11] 
*Prevention 
of 
Inversion.*--One 
of 
the 
tasks 
imposed 
in 
the 
object 
selection 
consists 
in 
not 
missing 
the 
opposite 
sex. 
This, 
as 
we 
know, 
is 
not 
solved 
without 
some 
difficulty. 
The 
first 
feelings 
after 
puberty 
often 
enough 
go 
astray, 
though 
not 
with 
any 
permanent 
injury. 
Dessoir 
has 
called 
attention 
to 
the 
normality 
of 
the 
enthusiastic 
friendships 
formed 
by 
boys 
and 
girls 
with 
their 
own 
sex. 
The 
greatest 
force 
which 
guards 
against 
a 
permanent 
inversion 
of 
the 
sexual 
object 
is 
surely 
the 
attraction 
exerted 
by 
the 
opposite 
sex 
characters 
on 
each 
other. 
For 
this 
we 
can 
give 
no 
explanation 
in 
connection 
with 
this 
discussion. 
This 
factor, 
however, 
does 
not 
in 
itself 
suffice 
to 
exclude 
the 
inversion; 
besides 
this 
there 
are 
surely 
many 
other 
supporting 
factors. 
Above 
all, 
there 
is 
the 
authoritative 
inhibition 
of 
society; 
experience 
shows 
that 
where 
the 
inversion 
is 
not 
considered 
a 
crime 
it 
fully 
corresponds 
to 
the 
sexual 
inclinations 
of 
many 
persons. 
Moreover, 
it 
may 
be 
assumed 
that 
in 
the 
man 
the 
infantile 
memories 
of 
the 
mother's 
tenderness, 
as 
well 
as 
that 
of 
other 
females 
who 
cared 
for 
him 
as 
a 
child, 
energetically 
assist 
in 
directing 
his 
selection 
to 
the 
woman, 
while 
the 
early 
sexual 
intimidation 
experienced 
through 
the 
father 
and 
the 
attitude 
of 
rivalry 
existing 
between 
them 
deflects 



the 
boy 
from 
the 
same 
sex. 
Both 
factors 
also 
hold 
true 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
girl 
whose 
sexual 
activity 
is 
under 
the 
special 
care 
of 
the 
mother. 
This 
results 
in 
a 
hostile 
relation 
to 
the 
same 
sex 
which 
decisively 
influences 
the 
object 
selection 
in 
the 
normal 
sense. 
The 
bringing 
up 
of 
boys 
by 
male 
persons 
(slaves 
in 
the 
ancient 
times) 
seems 
to 
favor 
homosexuality; 
the 
frequency 
of 
inversion 
in 
the 
present 
day 
nobility 
is 
probably 
explained 
by 
their 
employment 
of 
male 
servants, 
and 
by 
the 
scant 
care 
that 
mothers 
of 
that 
class 
give 
to 
their 
children. 
It 
happens 
in 
some 
hysterics 
that 
one 
of 
the 
parents 
has 
disappeared 
(through 
death, 
divorce, 
or 
estrangement), 
thus 
permitting 
the 
remaining 
parent 
to 
absorb 
all 
the 
love 
of 
the 
child, 
and 
in 
this 
way 
establishing 
the 
determinations 
for 
the 
sex 
of 
the 
person 
to 
be 
selected 
later 
as 
the 
sexual 
object; 
thus 
a 
permanent 
inversion 
is 
made 
possible. 
SUMMARY 
It 
is 
now 
time 
to 
attempt 
a 
summing-up. 
We 
have 
started 
from 
the 
aberrations 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
in 
reference 
to 
its 
object 
and 
aim 
and 
have 
encountered 
the 
question 
whether 
these 
originate 
from 
a 
congenital 
predisposition, 
or 
whether 
they 
are 
acquired 
in 
consequence 
of 
influences 
from 
life. 
The 
answer 
to 
this 
question 
was 
reached 
through 
an 
examination 
of 
the 
relations 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
of 
psychoneurotics, 
a 
numerous 
group 
not 
very 
remote 
from 
the 
normal. 
This 
examination 
has 
been 
made 
through 
psychoanalytic 
investigations. 
We 
have 
thus 
found 
that 
a 
tendency 
to 
all 
perversions 
might 
be 
demonstrated 
in 
these 
persons 
in 
the 
form 
of 
unconscious 
forces 
revealing 
themselves 
as 
symptom 
creators 
and 
we 
could 
say 
that 
the 
neurosis 
is, 
as 
it 
were, 
the 
negative 
of 
the 
perversion. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
now 
recognized 
great 
diffusion 
of 
tendencies 
to 
perversion 
the 
idea 
forced 
itself 
upon 
us 
that 
the 
disposition 
to 
perversions 
is 
the 
primitive 
and 
universal 
disposition 
of 
the 
human 
sexual 
impulse, 
from 
which 
the 
normal 
sexual 
behavior 
develops 
in 
consequence 
of 
organic 
changes 
and 
psychic 
inhibitions 
in 
the 
course 
of 
maturity. 
We 
hoped 
to 
be 
able 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
original 
disposition 
in 
the 
infantile 
life; 
among 
the 
forces 
restraining 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
we 
have 
mentioned 
shame, 
loathing 
and 
sympathy, 
and 
the 
social 
constructions 
of 
morality 
and 
authority. 
We 
have 
thus 
been 
forced 
to 
perceive 
in 
every 
fixed 
aberration 
from 
the 
normal 
sexual 
life 
a 
fragment 
of 
inhibited 
development 
and 
infantilism. 
The 
significance 
of 
the 
variations 
of 
the 
original 
dispositions 
had 
to 
be 
put 
into 
the 
foreground, 
but 
between 
them 
and 
the 
influences 
of 
life 
we 
had 
to 
assume 
a 
relation 
of 
coöperation 
and 
not 
of 
opposition. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
as 
the 
original 
disposition 
must 
have 
been 
a 



complex 
one, 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
itself 
appeared 
to 
us 
as 
something 
composed 
of 
many 
factors, 
which 
in 
the 
perversions 
becomes 
separated, 
as 
it 
were, 
into 
its 
components. 
The 
perversions, 
thus 
prove 
themselves 
to 
be 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
inhibitions, 
and 
on 
the 
other 
dissociations 
from 
the 
normal 
development. 
Both 
conceptions 
became 
united 
in 
the 
assumption 
that 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
of 
the 
adult 
due 
to 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
diverse 
feelings 
of 
the 
infantile 
life 
became 
formed 
into 
one 
unit, 
one 
striving, 
with 
one 
single 
aim. 
We 
also 
added 
an 
explanation 
for 
the 
preponderance 
of 
perversive 
tendencies 
in 
the 
psychoneurotics 
by 
recognizing 
in 
these 
tendencies 
collateral 
fillings 
of 
side 
branches 
caused 
by 
the 
shifting 
of 
the 
main 
river 
bed 
through 
repression, 
and 
we 
then 
turned 
our 
examination 
to 
the 
sexual 
life 
of 
the 
infantile 
period. 


[12] 
We 
found 
it 
regrettable 
that 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
sexual 
life 
in 
infancy 
has 
been 
disputed, 
and 
that 
the 
sexual 
manifestations 
which 
have 
been 
often 
observed 
in 
children 
have 
been 
described 
as 
abnormal 
occurrences. 
It 
rather 
seemed 
to 
us 
that 
the 
child 
brings 
along 
into 
the 
world 
germs 
of 
sexual 
activity 
and 
that 
even 
while 
taking 
nourishment 
it 
at 
the 
same 
time 
also 
enjoys 
a 
sexual 
gratification 
which 
it 
then 
seeks 
again 
to 
procure 
for 
itself 
through 
the 
familiar 
activity 
of 
"thumbsucking." 
The 
sexual 
activity 
of 
the 
child, 
however, 
does 
not 
develop 
in 
the 
same 
measure 
as 
its 
other 
functions, 
but 
merges 
first 
into 
the 
so-called 
latency 
period 
from 
the 
age 
of 
three 
to 
the 
age 
of 
five 
years. 
The 
production 
of 
sexual 
excitation 
by 
no 
means 
ceases 
at 
this 
period 
but 
continues 
and 
furnishes 
a 
stock 
of 
energy, 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
which 
is 
utilized 
for 
aims 
other 
than 
sexual; 
namely, 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
for 
the 
delivery 
of 
sexual 
components 
for 
social 
feelings, 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
(by 
means 
of 
repression 
and 
reaction 
formation) 
for 
the 
erection 
of 
the 
future 
sexual 
barriers. 
Accordingly, 
the 
forces 
which 
are 
destined 
to 
hold 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
in 
certain 
tracks 
are 
built 
up 
in 
infancy 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
perverse 
sexual 
feelings 
and 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
education. 
Another 
part 
of 
the 
infantile 
sexual 
manifestations 
escapes 
this 
utilization 
and 
may 
manifest 
itself 
as 
sexual 
activity. 
It 
can 
then 
be 
discovered 
that 
the 
sexual 
excitation 
of 
the 
child 
flows 
from 
diverse 
sources. 
Above 
all 
gratifications 
originate 
through 
the 
adapted 
sensible 
excitation 
of 
so-called 
erogenous 
zones. 
For 
these 
probably 
any 
skin 
region 
or 
sensory 
organ 
may 
serve; 
but 
there 
are 
certain 
distinguished 
erogenous 
zones 
the 
excitation 
of 
which 
by 
certain 
organic 
mechanisms 
is 
assured 
from 
the 
beginning. 
Moreover, 
sexual 
excitation 
originates 
in 
the 
organism, 
as 
it 
were, 
as 
a 
byproduct 
in 
a 
great 
number 
of 
processes, 
as 
soon 
as 
they 
attain 
a 
certain 

intensity; 
this 
especially 
takes 
place 
in 
all 
strong 
emotional 
excitements 
even 
if 
they 
be 
of 
a 
painful 
nature. 
The 
excitations 
from 
all 
these 
sources 
do 
not 
yet 
unite, 
but 
they 
pursue 
their 
aim 
individually--this 
aim 
consisting 
merely 
in 
the 
gaining 
of 
a 
certain 
pleasure. 
The 
sexual 
impulse 
of 
childhood 
is 
therefore 
objectless 
or 
autoerotic. 
Still 
during 
infancy 
the 
erogenous 
zone 
of 
the 
genitals 
begins 
to 
make 
itself 
noticeable, 
either 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
like 
any 
other 
erogenous 
zone 
it 
furnishes 
gratification 
through 
a 
suitable 
sensible 
stimulus, 
or 
because 
in 
some 
incomprehensible 
way 
the 
gratification 
from 
other 
sources 
causes 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
sexual 
excitement 
which 
has 
a 
special 
connection 
with 
the 
genital 
zone. 
We 
found 
cause 
to 
regret 
that 
a 
sufficient 
explanation 
of 
the 
relations 
between 
sexual 
gratification 
and 
sexual 
excitement, 
as 
well 
as 
between 
the 
activity 
of 
the 
genital 
zone 
and 
the 
remaining 
sources 
of 
sexuality, 
was 
not 
to 
be 
attained. 
We 
were 
unable 
to 
state 
what 
amount 
of 
sexual 
activity 
in 
childhood 
might 
be 
designated 
as 
normal 
to 
the 
extent 
of 
being 
incapable 
of 
further 
development. 
The 
character 
of 
the 
sexual 
manifestation 
showed 
itself 
to 
be 
preponderantly 
masturbatic. 
We, 
moreover, 
verified 
from 
experience 
the 
belief 
that 
the 
external 
influences 
of 
seduction, 
might 
produce 
premature 
breaches 
in 
the 
latency 
period 
leading 
as 
far 
as 
the 
suppression 
of 
the 
same, 
and 
that 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
of 
the 
child 
really 
shows 
itself 
to 
be 
polymorphous-perverse; 
furthermore, 
that 
every 
such 
premature 
sexual 
activity 
impairs 
the 
educability 
of 
the 
child. 
Despite 
the 
incompleteness 
of 
our 
examinations 
of 
the 
infantile 
sexual 
life 
we 
were 
subsequently 
forced 
to 
attempt 
to 
study 
the 
serious 
changes 
produced 
by 
the 
appearance 
of 
puberty. 
We 
selected 
two 
of 
the 
same 
as 
criteria, 
namely, 
the 
subordination 
of 
all 
other 
sources 
of 
the 
sexual 
feeling 
to 
the 
primacy 
of 
the 
genital 
zones, 
and 
the 
process 
of 
object 
finding. 
Both 
of 
them 
are 
already 
developed 
in 
childhood. 
The 
first 
is 
accomplished 
through 
the 
mechanism 
of 
utilizing 
the 
fore-pleasure, 
whereby 
all 
other 
independent 
sexual 
acts 
which 
are 
connected 
with 
pleasure 
and 
excitement 
become 
preparatory 
acts 
for 
the 
new 
sexual 
aim, 
the 
voiding 
of 
the 
sexual 
products, 
the 
attainment 
of 
which 
under 
enormous 
pleasure 
puts 
an 
end 
to 
the 
sexual 
feeling. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
we 
had 
to 
consider 
the 
differentiation 
of 
the 
sexual 
nature 
of 
man 
and 
woman, 
and 
we 
found 
that 
in 
order 
to 
become 
a 
woman 
a 
new 
repression 
is 
required 
which 
abolishes 
a 
piece 
of 
infantile 
masculinity, 
and 
prepares 
the 
woman 
for 
the 
change 
of 
the 
leading 
genital 
zones. 
Lastly, 
we 
found 
the 



object 
selection, 
tracing 
it 
through 
infancy 
to 
its 
revival 
in 
puberty; 
we 
also 
found 
indications 
of 
sexual 
inclinations 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
child 
for 
the 
parents 
and 
foster-parents, 
which, 
however, 
were 
turned 
away 
from 
these 
persons 
to 
others 
resembling 
them 
by 
the 
incest 
barriers 
which 
had 
been 
erected 
in 
the 
meantime. 
Let 
us 
finally 
add 
that 
during 
the 
transition 
period 
of 
puberty 
the 
somatic 
and 
psychic 
processes 
of 
development 
proceed 
side 
by 
side, 
but 
separately, 
until 
with 
the 
breaking 
through 
of 
an 
intense 
psychic 
love-
stimulus 
for 
the 
innervation 
of 
the 
genitals, 
the 
normally 
demanded 
unification 
of 
the 
erotic 
function 
is 
established. 
*The 
Factors 
Disturbing 
the 
Development.*--As 
we 
have 
already 
shown 
by 
different 
examples, 
every 
step 
on 
this 
long 
road 
of 
development 
may 
become 
a 
point 
of 
fixation 
and 
every 
joint 
in 
this 
complicated 
structure 
may 
afford 
opportunity 
for 
a 
dissociation 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse. 
It 
still 
remains 
for 
us 
to 
review 
the 
various 
inner 
and 
outer 
factors 
which 
disturb 
the 
development, 
and 
to 
mention 
the 
part 
of 
the 
mechanism 
affected 
by 
the 
disturbance 
emanating 
from 
them. 
The 
factors 
which 
we 
mention 
here 
in 
a 
series 
cannot, 
of 
course, 
all 
be 
in 
themselves 
of 
equal 
validity 
and 
we 
must 
expect 
to 
meet 
with 
difficulties 
in 
the 
assigning 
to 
the 
individual 
factors 
their 
due 
importance. 
*Constitution 
and 
Heredity.*--In 
the 
first 
place, 
we 
must 
mention 
here 
the 
congenital 
variation 
of 
the 
sexual 
constitution, 
upon 
which 
the 
greatest 
weight 
probably 
falls, 
but 
the 
existence 
of 
which, 
as 
may 
be 
easily 
understood, 
can 
be 
established 
only 
through 
its 
later 
manifestations 
and 
even 
then 
not 
always 
with 
great 
certainty. 
We 
understand 
by 
it 
a 
preponderance 
of 
one 
or 
another 
of 
the 
manifold 
sources 
of 
the 
sexual 
excitement, 
and 
we 
believe 
that 
such 
a 
difference 
of 
disposition 
must 
always 
come 
to 
expression 
in 
the 
final 
result, 
even 
if 
it 
should 
remain 
within 
normal 
limits. 
Of 
course, 
we 
can 
also 
imagine 
certain 
variations 
of 
the 
original 
disposition 
that 
even 
without 
further 
aid 
must 
necessarily 
lead 
to 
the 
formation 
of 
an 
abnormal 
sexual 
life. 
One 
can 
call 
these 
"degenerative" 
and 
consider 
them 
as 
an 
expression 
of 
hereditary 
deterioration. 
In 
this 
connection 
I 
have 
to 
report 
a 
remarkable 
fact. 
In 
more 
than 
half 
of 
the 
severe 
cases 
of 
hysteria, 
compulsion 
neuroses, 
etc., 
which 
I 
have 
treated 
by 
psychotherapy, 
I 
have 
succeeded 
in 
positively 
demonstrating 
that 
their 
fathers 
have 
gone 
through 
an 
attack 
of 
syphilis 
before 
marriage; 
they 
have 
either 
suffered 
from 
tabes 
or 
general 
paresis, 
or 
there 
was 
a 
definite 
history 
of 
lues. 
I 
expressly 
add 
that 
the 
children 
who 
were 
later 
neurotic 
showed 
absolutely 
no 
signs 
of 
hereditary 



lues, 
so 
that 
the 
abnormal 
sexual 
constitution 
was 
to 
be 
considered 
as 
the 
last 
off-shoot 
of 
the 
luetic 
heredity. 
As 
far 
as 
it 
is 
now 
from 
my 
thoughts 
to 
put 
down 
a 
descent 
from 
syphilitic 
parents 
as 
a 
regular 
and 
indispensable 
etiological 
determination 
of 
the 
neuropathic 
constitution, 
I 
nevertheless 
maintain 
that 
the 
coincidence 
observed 
by 
me 
is 
not 
accidental 
and 
not 
without 
significance. 
The 
hereditary 
relations 
of 
the 
positive 
perverts 
are 
not 
so 
well 
known 
because 
they 
know 
how 
to 
avoid 
inquiry. 
Still 
there 
is 
reason 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
same 
holds 
true 
in 
the 
perversions 
as 
in 
the 
neuroses. 
We 
often 
find 
perversions 
and 
psychoneuroses 
in 
the 
different 
sexes 
of 
the 
same 
family, 
so 
distributed 
that 
the 
male 
members, 
or 
one 
of 
them, 
is 
a 
positive 
pervert, 
while 
the 
females, 
following 
the 
repressive 
tendencies 
of 
their 
sex, 
are 
negative 
perverts 
or 
hysterics. 
This 
is 
a 
good 
example 
of 
the 
substantial 
relations 
between 
the 
two 
disturbances 
which 
I 
have 
discovered. 
*Further 
Elaboration.*--It 
cannot, 
however, 
be 
maintained 
that 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
is 
rendered 
finally 
complete 
by 
the 
addition 
of 
the 
diverse 
components 
of 
the 
sexual 
constitution. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
qualifications 
continue 
to 
appear 
and 
new 
possibilities 
result, 
depending 
upon 
the 
fate 
experienced 
by 
the 
sexual 
streams 
originating 
from 
the 
individual 
sources. 
This 
further 
elaboration 
is 
evidently 
the 
final 
and 
decisive 
one 
while 
the 
constitution 
described 
as 
uniform 
may 
lead 
to 
three 
final 
issues. 
If 
all 
the 
dispositions 
assumed 
to 
be 
abnormal 
retain 
their 
relative 
proportion, 
and 
are 
strengthened 
with 
maturity, 
the 
ultimate 
result 
can 
only 
be 
a 
perverse 
sexual 
life. 
The 
analysis 
of 
such 
abnormally 
constituted 
dispositions 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
thoroughly 
undertaken, 
but 
we 
already 
know 
cases 
that 
can 
be 
readily 
explained 
in 
the 
light 
of 
these 
theories. 
Authors 
believe, 
for 
example, 
that 
a 
whole 
series 
of 
fixation 
perversions 
must 
necessarily 
have 
had 
as 
their 
basis 
a 
congenital 
weakness 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse. 
The 
statement 
seems 
to 
me 
untenable 
in 
this 
form, 
but 
it 
becomes 
ingenious 
if 
it 
refers 
to 
a 
constitutional 
weakness 
of 
one 
factor 
in 
the 
sexual 
impulse, 
namely, 
the 
genital 
zone, 
which 
later 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
propagation 
accepts 
as 
a 
function 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
individual 
sexual 
activities. 
In 
this 
case 
the 
summation 
which 
is 
demanded 
in 
puberty 
must 
fail 
and 
the 
strongest 
of 
the 
other 
sexual 
components 
continues 
its 
activity 
as 
a 
perversion.[13] 
*Repression.*--Another 
issue 
results 
if 
in 
the 
course 
of 
development 
certain 
powerful 
components 
experience 
a 
_repression_--which 
we 
must 
carefully 
note 
is 
not 
a 
suspension. 
The 
excitations 
in 
question 
are 
produced 
as 
usual 



but 
are 
prevented 
from 
attaining 
their 
aim 
by 
psychic 
hindrances, 
and 
are 
driven 
off 
into 
many 
other 
paths 
until 
they 
express 
themselves 
in 
a 
symptom. 
The 
result 
can 
be 
an 
almost 
normal 
sexual 
life--usually 
a 
limited 
one--but 
supplemented 
by 
psychoneurotic 
disease. 
It 
is 
these 
cases 
that 
become 
so 
familiar 
to 
us 
through 
the 
psychoanalytic 
investigation 
of 
neurotics. 
The 
sexual 
life 
of 
such 
persons 
begins 
like 
that 
of 
perverts, 
a 
considerable 
part 
of 
their 
childhood 
is 
filled 
up 
with 
perverse 
sexual 
activity 
which 
occasionally 
extends 
far 
beyond 
the 
period 
of 
maturity, 
but 
owing 
to 
inner 
reasons 
a 
repressive 
change 
then 
results--usually 
before 
puberty, 
but 
now 
and 
then 
even 
much 
later--and 
from 
this 
point 
on 
without 
any 
extinction 
of 
the 
old 
feelings 
there 
appears 
a 
neurosis 
instead 
of 
a 
perversion. 
One 
may 
recall 
here 
the 
saying, 
"Junge 
Hure, 
alte 
Betschwester,"--only 
here 
youth 
has 
turned 
out 
to 
be 
much 
too 
short. 
The 
relieving 
of 
the 
perversion 
by 
the 
neurosis 
in 
the 
life 
of 
the 
same 
person, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
above 
mentioned 
distribution 
of 
perversion 
and 
hysteria 
in 
different 
persons 
of 
the 
same 
family, 
must 
be 
placed 
side 
by 
side 
with 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
neurosis 
is 
the 
negative 
of 
the 
perversion. 
*Sublimation.*--The 
third 
issue 
in 
abnormal 
constitutional 
dispositions 
is 
made 
possible 
by 
the 
process 
of 
"sublimation," 
through 
which 
the 
powerful 
excitations 
from 
individual 
sources 
of 
sexuality 
are 
discharged 
and 
utilized 
in 
other 
spheres, 
so 
that 
a 
considerable 
increase 
of 
psychic 
capacity 
results 
from 
an, 
in 
itself 
dangerous, 
predisposition. 
This 
forms 
one 
the 
sources 
of 
artistic 
activity, 
and, 
according 
as 
such 
sublimation 
is 
complete 
or 
incomplete, 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
character 
of 
highly 
gifted, 
especially 
of 
artistically 
disposed 
persons, 
will 
show 
any 
proportionate, 
blending 
between 
productive 
ability, 
perversion, 
and 
neurosis. 
A 
sub-species 
of 
sublimation 
is 
the 
suppression 
through 
_reaction-formation_, 
which, 
as 
we 
have 
found, 
begins 
even 
in 
the 
latency 
period 
of 
infancy, 
only 
to 
continue 
throughout 
life 
in 
favorable 
cases. 
What 
we 
call 
the 
character 
of 
a 
person 
is 
built 
up 
to 
a 
great 
extent 
from 
the 
material 
of 
sexual 
excitations; 
it 
is 
composed 
of 
impulses 
fixed 
since 
infancy 
and 
won 
through 
sublimation, 
and 
of 
such 
constructions 
as 
are 
destined 
to 
suppress 
effectually 
those 
perverse 
feelings 
which 
are 
recognized 
as 
useless. 
The 
general 
perverse 
sexual 
disposition 
of 
childhood 
can 
therefore 
be 
esteemed 
as 
a 
source 
of 
a 
number 
of 
our 
virtues, 
insofar 
as 
it 
incites 
their 
creation 
through 
the 
formation 
of 
reactions.[14] 
*Accidental 
Experiences.*--All 
other 
influences 
lose 
in 
significance 
when 
compared 
with 
the 
sexual 
discharges, 
shifts 
of 
repressions, 
and 
sublimations; 
the 
inner 
determinations 
for 
the 
last 
two 
processes 
are 
totally 
unknown 
to 
us. 



He 
who 
includes 
repressions 
and 
sublimations 
among 
constitutional 
predispositions, 
and 
considers 
them 
as 
the 
living 
manifestations 
of 
the 
same, 
has 
surely 
the 
right 
to 
maintain 
that 
the 
final 
structure 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
is 
above 
all 
the 
result 
of 
the 
congenital 
constitution. 
No 
intelligent 
person, 
however, 
will 
dispute 
that 
in 
such 
a 
coöperation 
of 
factors 
there 
is 
also 
room 
for 
the 
modifying 
influences 
of 
occasional 
factors 
derived 
from 
experience 
in 
childhood 
and 
later 
on. 
It 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
estimate 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
constitutional 
and 
of 
the 
occasional 
factors 
in 
their 
relation 
to 
each 
other. 
Theory 
is 
always 
inclined 
to 
overestimate 
the 
first 
while 
therapeutic 
practice 
renders 
prominent 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
latter. 
By 
no 
means 
should 
it 
be 
forgotten 
that 
between 
the 
two 
there 
exists 
a 
relation 
of 
coöperation 
and 
not 
of 
exclusion. 
The 
constitutional 
factor 
must 
wait 
for 
experiences 
which 
bring 
it 
to 
the 
surface, 
while 
the 
occasional 
needs 
the 
support 
of 
the 
constitutional 
factor 
in 
order 
to 
become 
effective. 
For 
the 
majority 
of 
cases 
one 
can 
imagine 
a 
so-called 
"etiological 
group" 
in 
which 
the 
declining 
intensities 
of 
one 
factor 
become 
balanced 
by 
the 
rise 
in 
the 
others, 
but 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
to 
deny 
the 
existence 
of 
extremes 
at 
the 
ends 
of 
the 
group. 
It 
would 
be 
still 
more 
in 
harmony 
with 
psychoanalytic 
investigation 
if 
the 
experiences 
of 
early 
childhood 
would 
get 
a 
place 
of 
preference 
among 
the 
occasional 
factors. 
The 
one 
etiological 
group 
then 
becomes 
split 
up 
into 
two 
which 
may 
be 
designated 
as 
the 
dispositional 
and 
the 
definitive 
groups. 
Constitution 
and 
occasional 
infantile 
experiences 
are 
just 
as 
coöperative 
in 
the 
first 
as 
disposition 
and 
later 
traumatic 
experiences 
in 
the 
second 
group. 
All 
the 
factors 
which 
injure 
the 
sexual 
development 
show 
their 
effect 
in 
that 
they 
produce 
a 
regression, 
or 
a 
return 
to 
a 
former 
phase 
of 
development. 
We 
may 
now 
continue 
with 
our 
task 
of 
enumerating 
the 
factors 
which 
have 
become 
known 
to 
us 
as 
influential 
for 
the 
sexual 
development, 
whether 
they 
be 
active 
forces 
or 
merely 
manifestations 
of 
the 
same. 
*Prematurity.*--Such 
a 
factor 
is 
the 
spontaneous 
sexual 
prematurity 
which 
can 
be 
definitely 
demonstrated 
at 
least 
in 
the 
etiology 
of 
the 
neuroses, 
though 
in 
itself 
it 
is 
as 
little 
adequate 
for 
causation 
as 
the 
other 
factors. 
It 
manifests 
itself 
in 
a 
breaking 
through, 
shortening, 
or 
suspending 
of 
the 
infantile 
latency 
period 
and 
becomes 
a 
cause 
of 
disturbances 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
provokes 
sexual 
manifestations 
which, 
either 
on 
account 
of 
the 
unready 
state 
of 
the 
sexual 
inhibitions 
or 
because 
of 
the 
undeveloped 
state 
of 
the 
genital 
system, 
can 
only 
carry 
along 
the 
character 
of 
perversions. 
These 
tendencies 
to 
perversion 



may 
either 
remain 
as 
such, 
or 
after 
the 
repression 
sets 
in 
they 
may 
become 
motive 
powers 
for 
neurotic 
symptoms; 
at 
all 
events, 
the 
sexual 
prematurity 
renders 
difficult 
the 
desirable 
later 
control 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
by 
the 
higher 
psychic 
influences, 
and 
enhances 
the 
compulsive-like 
character 
which 
even 
without 
this 
prematurity 
would 
be 
claimed 
by 
the 
psychic 
representatives 
of 
the 
impulse. 
Sexual 
prematurity 
often 
runs 
parallel 
with 
premature 
intellectual 
development; 
it 
is 
found 
as 
such 
in 
the 
infantile 
history 
of 
the 
most 
distinguished 
and 
most 
productive 
individuals, 
and 
in 
such 
connection 
it 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
act 
as 
pathogenically 
as 
when 
appearing 
isolated. 
*Temporal 
Factors.*--Just 
like 
prematurity, 
other 
factors, 
which 
under 
the 
designation 
of 
temporal 
can 
be 
added 
to 
prematurity, 
also 
demand 
consideration. 
It 
seems 
to 
be 
phylogenetically 
established 
in 
what 
sequence 
the 
individual 
impulsive 
feelings 
become 
active, 
and 
how 
long 
they 
can 
manifest 
themselves 
before 
they 
succumb 
to 
the 
influence 
of 
a 
newly 
appearing 
active 
impulse 
or 
to 
a 
typical 
repression. 
But 
both 
in 
this 
temporal 
succession 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
duration 
of 
the 
same, 
variations 
seem 
to 
occur, 
which 
must 
exercise 
a 
definite 
influence 
on 
the 
experience. 
It 
cannot 
be 
a 
matter 
of 
indifference 
whether 
a 
certain 
stream 
appears 
earlier 
or 
later 
than 
its 
counterstream, 
for 
the 
effect 
of 
a 
repression 
cannot 
be 
made 
retrogressive; 
a 
temporal 
deviation 
in 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
components 
regularly 
produces 
a 
change 
in 
the 
result. 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
impulsive 
feelings 
which 
appear 
with 
special 
intensity 
often 
come 
to 
a 
surprisingly 
rapid 
end, 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
heterosexual 
attachment 
of 
the 
later 
manifest 
homosexuals. 
The 
strivings 
of 
childhood 
which 
manifest 
themselves 
most 
impetuously 
do 
not 
justify 
the 
fear 
that 
they 
will 
lastingly 
dominate 
the 
character 
of 
the 
grown-up; 
one 
has 
as 
much 
right 
to 
expect 
that 
they 
will 
disappear 
in 
order 
to 
make 
room 
for 
their 
counterparts. 
(Harsh 
masters 
do 
not 
rule 
long.) 
To 
what 
one 
may 
attribute 
such 
temporal 
confusions 
of 
the 
processes 
of 
development 
we 
are 
hardly 
able 
to 
suggest. 
A 
view 
is 
opened 
here 
to 
a 
deeper 
phalanx 
of 
biological, 
and 
perhaps 
also 
historical 
problems, 
which 
we 
have 
not 
yet 
approached 
within 
fighting 
distance. 
*Adhesion.*--The 
significance 
of 
all 
premature 
sexual 
manifestations 
is 
enhanced 
by 
a 
psychic 
factor 
of 
unknown 
origin 
which 
at 
present 
can 
be 
put 
down 
only 
as 
a 
psychological 
preliminary. 
I 
believe 
that 
it 
is 
the 
heightened 
adhesion 
or 
fixedness 
of 
these 
impressions 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
which 
in 
later 
neurotics, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
perverts, 
must 
be 
added 
for 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
other 
facts; 
for 
the 
same 
premature 
sexual 
manifestations 
in 
other 
persons 



cannot 
impress 
themselves 
deeply 
enough 
to 
repeat 
themselves 
compulsively 
and 
to 
succeed 
in 
prescribing 
the 
way 
for 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
throughout 
later 
life. 
Perhaps 
a 
part 
of 
the 
explanation 
for 
this 
adhesion 
lies 
in 
another 
psychic 
factor 
which 
we 
cannot 
miss 
in 
the 
causation 
of 
the 
neuroses, 
namely, 
in 
the 
preponderance 
which 
in 
the 
psychic 
life 
falls 
to 
the 
share 
of 
memory 
traces 
as 
compared 
with 
recent 
impressions. 
This 
factor 
is 
apparently 
dependent 
on 
the 
intellectual 
development 
and 
grows 
with 
the 
growth 
of 
personal 
culture. 
In 
contrast 
to 
this 
the 
savage 
has 
been 
characterized 
as 
"the 
unfortunate 
child 
of 
the 
moment."[15] 
Owing 
to 
the 
oppositional 
relation 
existing 
between 
culture 
and 
the 
free 
development 
of 
sexuality, 
the 
results 
of 
which 
may 
be 
traced 
far 
into 
the 
formation 
of 
our 
life, 
the 
problem 
how 
the 
sexual 
life 
of 
the 
child 
evolves 
is 
of 
very 
little 
importance 
for 
the 
later 
life 
in 
the 
lower 
stages 
of 
culture 
and 
civilization, 
and 
of 
very 
great 
importance 
in 
the 
higher. 
*Fixation.*--The 
influence 
of 
the 
psychic 
factors 
just 
mentioned 
favored 
the 
development 
of 
the 
accidentally 
experienced 
impulses 
of 
the 
infantile 
sexuality. 
The 
latter 
(especially 
in 
the 
form 
of 
seductions 
through 
other 
children 
or 
through 
adults) 
produce 
the 
material 
which, 
with 
the 
help 
of 
the 
former, 
may 
become 
fixed 
as 
a 
permanent 
disturbance. 
A 
considerable 
number 
of 
the 
deviations 
from 
the 
normal 
sexual 
life 
observed 
later 
have 
been 
thus 
established 
in 
neurotics 
and 
perverts 
from 
the 
beginning 
through 
the 
impressions 
received 
during 
the 
alleged 
sexually 
free 
period 
of 
childhood. 
The 
causation 
is 
produced 
by 
the 
responsiveness 
of 
the 
constitution, 
the 
prematurity, 
the 
quality 
of 
heightened 
adhesion, 
and 
the 
accidental 
excitement 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
through 
outside 
influence. 
The 
unsatisfactory 
conclusions 
which 
have 
resulted 
from 
this 
investigation 
of 
the 
disturbances 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
is 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
as 
yet 
know 
too 
little 
concerning 
the 
biological 
processes 
in 
which 
the 
nature 
of 
sexuality 
consists 
to 
form 
from 
our 
isolated 
examinations 
a 
satisfactory 
theory 
for 
the 
explanation 
of 
either 
the 
normal 
or 
the 
pathological.

The 
differences 
will 
be 
emphasized 
in 
the 
schematic 
representation 
given 
in 
the 
text. 
To 
what 
extent 
the 
infantile 
sexuality 
approaches 
the 
definitive 
sexual 
organization 
through 
its 
object 
selection 
has 
been 
discussed 
before 
(p. 
60).

[4] 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
make 
clear 
that 
the 
conceptions 
"masculine" 
and 
"feminine," 
whose 
content 
seems 
so 
unequivocal 
to 
the 
ordinary 
meaning, 
belong 
to 
the 
most 
confused 
terms 
in 
science 
and 
can 
be 
cut 
up 
into 
at 
least 
three 
paths. 
One 
uses 
masculine 
and 
feminine 
at 
times 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
activity 
and 
passivity, 
again, 
in 
the 
biological 
sense, 
and 
then 
also 
in 
the 
sociological 
sense. 
The 
first 
of 
these 
three 
meanings 
is 
the 
essential 
one 
and 
the 
only 
one 
utilizable 
in 
psychoanalysis. 
It 
agrees 
with 
the 
masculine 
designation 
of 
the 
libido 
in 
the 
text 
above, 
for 
the 
libido 
is 
always 
active 
even 
when 
it 
is 
directed 
to 
a 
passive 
aim. 
The 
second, 
the 
biological 
significance 
of 
masculine 
and 
feminine, 
is 
the 
one 
which 
permits 
the 
clearest 
determination. 
Masculine 
and 
feminine 
are 
here 
characterized 
by 
the 
presence 
of 
semen 
or 
ovum 
and 
through 
the 
functions 
emanating 
from 
them. 
The 
activity 
and 
its 
secondary 
manifestations, 
like 
stronger 
developed 
muscles, 
aggression, 
a 
greater 
intensity 
of 
libido, 
are 
as 
a 
rule 
soldered 
to 
the 
biological 
masculinity 
but 
not 
necessarily 
connected 
with 
it, 
for 
there 
are 
species 
of 
animals 
in 
whom 
these 
qualities 
are 
attributed 
to 
the 
female. 
The 
third, 
the 
sociological 
meaning, 
receives 
its 
content 
through 
the 
observation 
of 
the 
actual 
existing 
male 
and 
female 
individuals. 
The 
result 
of 
this 
in 
man 
is 
that 
there 
is 
no 
pure 
masculinity 
or 
feminity 
either 
in 
the 
biological 
or 
psychological 
sense. 
On 
the 
contrary 
every 
individual 
person 
shows 
a 
mixture 
of 
his 
own 
biological 
sex 
characteristics 
with 
the 
biological 
traits 
of 
the 
other 
sex 
and 
a 
union 
of 
activity 
and 
passivity; 
this 
is 
the 
case 
whether 
these 
psychological 
characteristic 
features 
depend 
on 
the 
biological 
or 
whether 
they 
are 
independent 
of 
it. 
[5] 
Psychoanalysis 
teaches 
that 
there 
are 
two 
paths 
of 
object-finding; 
the 
first 
is 
the 
one 
discussed 
in 
the 
text 
which 
is 
guided 
by 
the 
early 
infantile 
prototypes. 
The 
second 
is 
the 
narcissistic 
which 
seeks 
its 
own 
ego 
and 
finds 
it 
in 
the 
other. 
The 
latter 
is 
of 
particularly 
great 
significance 
for 
the 
pathological 
outcomes, 
but 
does 
not 
fit 
into 
the 
connection 
treated 
here. 
[6] 
Those 
to 
whom 
this 
conception 
appears 
"wicked" 
may 
read 
Havelock 
Ellis's 
treatise 
on 
the 
relations 
between 
mother 
and 
child 
which 
expresses 
almost 
the 
same 
ideas 
(The 
Sexual 
Impulse, 
p. 
16). 
[7] 
For 
the 
explanation 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
infantile 
fear 
I 
am 
indebted 
to 
a 
three-year-old 
boy 
whom 
I 
once 
heard 
calling 
from 
a 
dark 
room: 
"Aunt, 
talk 
to 
me, 
I 
am 
afraid 
because 
it 
is 
dark." 
"How 
will 
that 
help 
you," 
answered 
the 

aunt; 
"you 
cannot 
see 
anyhow." 
"That's 
nothing," 
answered 
the 
child; 
"if 
some 
one 
talks 
then 
it 
becomes 
light."--He 
was, 
as 
we 
see, 
not 
afraid 
of 
the 
darkness 
but 
he 
was 
afraid 
because 
he 
missed 
the 
person 
he 
loved, 
and 
he 
could 
promise 
to 
calm 
down 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
was 
assured 
of 
her 
presence.

Cf. 
here 
what 
was 
said 
on 
page 
83 
concerning 
the 
object 
selection 
of 
the 
child; 
the 
"tender 
stream." 
[9] 
The 
incest 
barrier 
probably 
belongs 
to 
the 
historical 
acquisitions 
of 
humanity 
and 
like 
other 
moral 
taboos 
it 
must 
be 
fixed 
in 
many 
individuals 
through 
organic 
heredity. 
(Cf. 
my 
work, 
Totem 
and 
Taboo, 
1913.) 
Psychoanalytic 
studies 
show, 
however, 
how 
intensively 
the 
individual 
struggles 
with 
the 
incest 
temptations 
during 
his 
development 
and 
how 
frequently 
he 
puts 
them 
into 
phantasies 
and 
even 
into 
reality.

[11] 
Innumerable 
peculiarities 
of 
the 
human 
love-life 
as 
well 
as 
the 
compulsiveness 
of 
being 
in 
love 
itself 
can 
surely 
only 
be 
understood 
through 
a 
reference 
to 
childhood 
or 
as 
an 
effective 
remnant 
of 
the 
same. 
[12] 
This 
was 
true 
not 
only 
of 
the 
"negative" 
tendencies 
to 
perversion 
appearing 
in 
the 
neurosis, 
but 
also 
of 
the 
so-called 
positive 
perversions. 
The 
latter 
are 
not 
only 
to 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
fixation 
of 
the 
infantile 
tendencies, 
but 
also 
to 
regression 
to 
these 
tendencies 
owing 
to 
the 
misplacement 
of 
other 
paths 
of 
the 
sexual 
stream. 
Hence 
the 
positive 
perversions 
are 
also 
accessible 
to 
psychoanalytic 
therapy. 
(Cf. 
the 
works 
of 
Sadger, 
Ferenczi, 
and 
Brill.) 
[13] 
Here 
one 
often 
sees 
that 
at 
first 
a 
normal 
sexual 
stream 
begins 
at 
the 
age 
of 
puberty, 
but 
owing 
to 
its 
inner 
weakness 
it 
breaks 
down 
at 
the 
first 
outer 
hindrance 
and 
then 
changes 
from 
regression, 
to 
perverse 
fixation. 
[14] 
That 
keen 
observer 
of 
human 
nature, 
E. 
Zola, 
describes 
a 
girl 
in 
his 
book, 
La 
Joie 
de 
vivre, 
who 
in 
cheerful 
self 
renunciation 
offers 
all 
she 
has 
in 
possession 
or 
expectation, 
her 
fortune 
and 
her 
life's 
hopes 
to 
those 
she 
loves 
without 
thought 
of 
return. 
The 
childhood 
of 
this 
girl 
was 
dominated 
by 
an 
insatiable 
desire 
for 
love 
which 
whenever 
she 
was 
depreciated 
caused 
her 
to 
merge 
into 
a 
fit 
of 
cruelty. 
[15] 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
heightened 
adhesion 
is 
only 
the 
result 
of 
a 
special 
intensive 
somatic 
sexual 
manifestation 
of 
former 
years.

INTRODUCTION 


The 
medical 
profession 
is 
justly 
conservative. 
Human 
life 
should 
not 
be 
considered 
as 
the 
proper 
material 
for 
wild 
experiments. 


Conservatism, 
however, 
is 
too 
often 
a 
welcome 
excuse 
for 
lazy 
minds, 
loath 
to 
adapt 
themselves 
to 
fast 
changing 
conditions. 


Remember 
the 
scornful 
reception 
which 
first 
was 
accorded 
to 
Freud's 
discoveries 
in 
the 
domain 
of 
the 
unconscious. 


When 
after 
years 
of 
patient 
observations, 
he 
finally 
decided 
to 
appear 
before 
medical 
bodies 
to 
tell 
them 
modestly 
of 
some 
facts 
which 
always 
recurred 
in 
his 
dream 
and 
his 
patients' 
dreams, 
he 
was 
first 
laughed 
at 
and 
then 
avoided 
as 
a 
crank. 


The 
words 
"dream 
interpretation" 
were 
and 
still 
are 
indeed 
fraught 
with 
unpleasant, 
unscientific 
associations. 
They 
remind 
one 
of 
all 
sorts 
of 
childish, 
superstitious 
notions, 
which 
make 
up 
the 
thread 
and 
woof 
of 
dream 
books, 
read 
by 
none 
but 
the 
ignorant 
and 
the 
primitive. 


The 
wealth 
of 
detail, 
the 
infinite 
care 
never 
to 
let 
anything 
pass 
unexplained, 
with 
which 
he 
presented 
to 
the 
public 
the 
result 
of 
his 
investigations, 
are 
impressing 
more 
and 
more 
serious-minded 
scientists, 
but 
the 
examination 
of 
his 
evidential 
data 
demands 
arduous 
work 
and 
presupposes 
an 
absolutely 
open 
mind. 


This 
is 
why 
we 
still 
encounter 
men, 
totally 
unfamiliar 
with 
Freud's 
writings, 
men 
who 
were 
not 
even 
interested 
enough 
in 
the 
subject 
to 
attempt 
an 
interpretation 
of 
their 
dreams 
or 
their 
patients' 
dreams, 
deriding 
Freud's 
theories 
and 
combatting 
them 
with 
the 
help 
of 
statements 
which 
he 
never 
made. 


Some 
of 
them, 
like 
Professor 
Boris 
Sidis, 
reach 
at 
times 
conclusions 
which 
are 
strangely 
similar 
to 
Freud's, 
but 
in 
their 
ignorance 
of 
psychoanalytic 
literature, 
they 
fail 
to 
credit 
Freud 
for 
observations 
antedating 
theirs. 


Besides 
those 
who 
sneer 
at 
dream 
study, 
because 
they 
have 
never 
looked 
into 
the 
subject, 
there 
are 
those 
who 
do 
not 
dare 
to 
face 
the 
facts 
revealed 
by 
dream 
study. 
Dreams 
tell 
us 
many 
an 
unpleasant 
biological 
truth 
about 



ourselves 
and 
only 
very 
free 
minds 
can 
thrive 
on 
such 
a 
diet. 
Self-deception 
is 
a 
plant 
which 
withers 
fast 
in 
the 
pellucid 
atmosphere 
of 
dream 
investigation. 


The 
weakling 
and 
the 
neurotic 
attached 
to 
his 
neurosis 
are 
not 
anxious 
to 
turn 
such 
a 
powerful 
searchlight 
upon 
the 
dark 
corners 
of 
their 
psychology. 


Freud's 
theories 
are 
anything 
but 
theoretical. 


He 
was 
moved 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
always 
seemed 
to 
be 
a 
close 
connection 
between 
his 
patients' 
dreams 
and 
their 
mental 
abnormalities, 
to 
collect 
thousands 
of 
dreams 
and 
to 
compare 
them 
with 
the 
case 
histories 
in 
his 
possession. 


He 
did 
not 
start 
out 
with 
a 
preconceived 
bias, 
hoping 
to 
find 
evidence 
which 
might 
support 
his 
views. 
He 
looked 
at 
facts 
a 
thousand 
times 
"until 
they 
began 
to 
tell 
him 
something." 


His 
attitude 
toward 
dream 
study 
was, 
in 
other 
words, 
that 
of 
a 
statistician 
who 
does 
not 
know, 
and 
has 
no 
means 
of 
foreseeing, 
what 
conclusions 
will 
be 
forced 
on 
him 
by 
the 
information 
he 
is 
gathering, 
but 
who 
is 
fully 
prepared 
to 
accept 
those 
unavoidable 
conclusions. 


This 
was 
indeed 
a 
novel 
way 
in 
psychology. 
Psychologists 
had 
always 
been 
wont 
to 
build, 
in 
what 
Bleuler 
calls 
"autistic 
ways," 
that 
is 
through 
methods 
in 
no 
wise 
supported 
by 
evidence, 
some 
attractive 
hypothesis, 
which 
sprung 
from 
their 
brain, 
like 
Minerva 
from 
Jove's 
brain, 
fully 
armed. 


After 
which, 
they 
would 
stretch 
upon 
that 
unyielding 
frame 
the 
hide 
of 
a 
reality 
which 
they 
had 
previously 
killed. 


It 
is 
only 
to 
minds 
suffering 
from 
the 
same 
distortions, 
to 
minds 
also 
autistically 
inclined, 
that 
those 
empty, 
artificial 
structures 
appear 
acceptable 
molds 
for 
philosophic 
thinking. 


The 
pragmatic 
view 
that 
"truth 
is 
what 
works" 
had 
not 
been 
as 
yet 
expressed 
when 
Freud 
published 
his 
revolutionary 
views 
on 
the 
psychology 
of 
dreams. 


Five 
facts 
of 
first 
magnitude 
were 
made 
obvious 
to 
the 
world 
by 
his 
interpretation 
of 
dreams. 



First 
of 
all, 
Freud 
pointed 
out 
a 
constant 
connection 
between 
some 
part 
of 
every 
dream 
and 
some 
detail 
of 
the 
dreamer's 
life 
during 
the 
previous 
waking 
state. 
This 
positively 
establishes 
a 
relation 
between 
sleeping 
states 
and 
waking 
states 
and 
disposes 
of 
the 
widely 
prevalent 
view 
that 
dreams 
are 
purely 
nonsensical 
phenomena 
coming 
from 
nowhere 
and 
leading 
nowhere. 


Secondly, 
Freud, 
after 
studying 
the 
dreamer's 
life 
and 
modes 
of 
thought, 
after 
noting 
down 
all 
his 
mannerisms 
and 
the 
apparently 
insignificant 
details 
of 
his 
conduct 
which 
reveal 
his 
secret 
thoughts, 
came 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
there 
was 
in 
every 
dream 
the 
attempted 
or 
successful 
gratification 
of 
some 
wish, 
conscious 
or 
unconscious. 


Thirdly, 
he 
proved 
that 
many 
of 
our 
dream 
visions 
are 
symbolical, 
which 
causes 
us 
to 
consider 
them 
as 
absurd 
and 
unintelligible; 
the 
universality 
of 
those 
symbols, 
however, 
makes 
them 
very 
transparent 
to 
the 
trained 
observer. 


Fourthly, 
Freud 
showed 
that 
sexual 
desires 
play 
an 
enormous 
part 
in 
our 
unconscious, 
a 
part 
which 
puritanical 
hypocrisy 
has 
always 
tried 
to 
minimize, 
if 
not 
to 
ignore 
entirely. 


Finally, 
Freud 
established 
a 
direct 
connection 
between 
dreams 
and 
insanity, 
between 
the 
symbolic 
visions 
of 
our 
sleep 
and 
the 
symbolic 
actions 
of 
the 
mentally 
deranged. 


There 
were, 
of 
course, 
many 
other 
observations 
which 
Freud 
made 
while 
dissecting 
the 
dreams 
of 
his 
patients, 
but 
not 
all 
of 
them 
present 
as 
much 
interest 
as 
the 
foregoing 
nor 
were 
they 
as 
revolutionary 
or 
likely 
to 
wield 
as 
much 
influence 
on 
modern 
psychiatry. 


Other 
explorers 
have 
struck 
the 
path 
blazed 
by 
Freud 
and 
leading 
into 
man's 
unconscious. 
Jung 
of 
Zurich, 
Adler 
of 
Vienna 
and 
Kempf 
of 
Washington, 
D.C., 
have 
made 
to 
the 
study 
of 
the 
unconscious, 
contributions 
which 
have 
brought 
that 
study 
into 
fields 
which 
Freud 
himself 
never 
dreamt 
of 
invading. 


One 
fact 
which 
cannot 
be 
too 
emphatically 
stated, 
however, 
is 
that 
but 
for 
Freud's 
wishfulfillment 
theory 
of 
dreams, 
neither 
Jung's 
"energic 
theory," 
nor 
Adler's 
theory 
of 
"organ 
inferiority 
and 
compensation," 
nor 
Kempf's 
"dynamic 
mechanism" 
might 
have 
been 
formulated. 



Freud 
is 
the 
father 
of 
modern 
abnormal 
psychology 
and 
he 
established 
the 
psychoanalytical 
point 
of 
view. 
No 
one 
who 
is 
not 
well 
grounded 
in 
Freudian 
lore 
can 
hope 
to 
achieve 
any 
work 
of 
value 
in 
the 
field 
of 
psychoanalysis. 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
let 
no 
one 
repeat 
the 
absurd 
assertion 
that 
Freudism 
is 
a 
sort 
of 
religion 
bounded 
with 
dogmas 
and 
requiring 
an 
act 
of 
faith. 
Freudism 
as 
such 
was 
merely 
a 
stage 
in 
the 
development 
of 
psychoanalysis, 
a 
stage 
out 
of 
which 
all 
but 
a 
few 
bigoted 
camp 
followers, 
totally 
lacking 
in 
originality, 
have 
evolved. 
Thousands 
of 
stones 
have 
been 
added 
to 
the 
structure 
erected 
by 
the 
Viennese 
physician 
and 
many 
more 
will 
be 
added 
in 
the 
course 
of 
time. 


But 
the 
new 
additions 
to 
that 
structure 
would 
collapse 
like 
a 
house 
of 
cards 
but 
for 
the 
original 
foundations 
which 
are 
as 
indestructible 
as 
Harvey's 
statement 
as 
to 
the 
circulation 
of 
the 
blood. 


Regardless 
of 
whatever 
additions 
or 
changes 
have 
been 
made 
to 
the 
original 
structure, 
the 
analytic 
point 
of 
view 
remains 
unchanged. 


That 
point 
of 
view 
is 
not 
only 
revolutionising 
all 
the 
methods 
of 
diagnosis 
and 
treatment 
of 
mental 
derangements, 
but 
compelling 
the 
intelligent, 
up-todate 
physician 
to 
revise 
entirely 
his 
attitude 
to 
almost 
every 
kind 
of 
disease. 


The 
insane 
are 
no 
longer 
absurd 
and 
pitiable 
people, 
to 
be 
herded 
in 
asylums 
till 
nature 
either 
cures 
them 
or 
relieves 
them, 
through 
death, 
of 
their 
misery. 
The 
insane 
who 
have 
not 
been 
made 
so 
by 
actual 
injury 
to 
their 
brain 
or 
nervous 
system, 
are 
the 
victims 
of 
unconscious 
forces 
which 
cause 
them 
to 
do 
abnormally 
things 
which 
they 
might 
be 
helped 
to 
do 
normally. 


Insight 
into 
one's 
psychology 
is 
replacing 
victoriously 
sedatives 
and 
rest 
cures. 


Physicians 
dealing 
with 
"purely" 
physical 
cases 
have 
begun 
to 
take 
into 
serious 
consideration 
the 
"mental" 
factors 
which 
have 
predisposed 
a 
patient 
to 
certain 
ailments. 


Freud's 
views 
have 
also 
made 
a 
revision 
of 
all 
ethical 
and 
social 
values 
unavoidable 
and 
have 
thrown 
an 
unexpected 
flood 
of 
light 
upon 
literary 
and 
artistic 
accomplishment. 



But 
the 
Freudian 
point 
of 
view, 
or 
more 
broadly 
speaking, 
the 
psychoanalytic 
point 
of 
view, 
shall 
ever 
remain 
a 
puzzle 
to 
those 
who, 
from 
laziness 
or 
indifference, 
refuse 
to 
survey 
with 
the 
great 
Viennese 
the 
field 
over 
which 
he 
carefully 
groped 
his 
way. 
We 
shall 
never 
be 
convinced 
until 
we 
repeat 
under 
his 
guidance 
all 
his 
laboratory 
experiments. 


We 
must 
follow 
him 
through 
the 
thickets 
of 
the 
unconscious, 
through 
the 
land 
which 
had 
never 
been 
charted 
because 
academic 
philosophers, 
following 
the 
line 
of 
least 
effort, 
had 
decided 
a 
priori 
that 
it 
could 
not 
be 
charted. 


Ancient 
geographers, 
when 
exhausting 
their 
store 
of 
information 
about 
distant 
lands, 
yielded 
to 
an 
unscientific 
craving 
for 
romance 
and, 
without 
any 
evidence 
to 
support 
their 
day 
dreams, 
filled 
the 
blank 
spaces 
left 
on 
their 
maps 
by 
unexplored 
tracts 
with 
amusing 
inserts 
such 
as 
"Here 
there 
are 
lions." 


Thanks 
to 
Freud's 
interpretation 
of 
dreams 
the 
"royal 
road" 
into 
the 
unconscious 
is 
now 
open 
to 
all 
explorers. 
They 
shall 
not 
find 
lions, 
they 
shall 
find 
man 
himself, 
and 
the 
record 
of 
all 
his 
life 
and 
of 
his 
struggle 
with 
reality. 


And 
it 
is 
only 
after 
seeing 
man 
as 
his 
unconscious, 
revealed 
by 
his 
dreams, 
presents 
him 
to 
us 
that 
we 
shall 
understand 
him 
fully. 
For 
as 
Freud 
said 
to 
Putnam: 
"We 
are 
what 
we 
are 
because 
we 
have 
been 
what 
we 
have 
been." 


Not 
a 
few 
serious-minded 
students, 
however, 
have 
been 
discouraged 
from 
attempting 
a 
study 
of 
Freud's 
dream 
psychology. 


The 
book 
in 
which 
he 
originally 
offered 
to 
the 
world 
his 
interpretation 
of 
dreams 
was 
as 
circumstantial 
as 
a 
legal 
record 
to 
be 
pondered 
over 
by 
scientists 
at 
their 
leisure, 
not 
to 
be 
assimilated 
in 
a 
few 
hours 
by 
the 
average 
alert 
reader. 
In 
those 
days, 
Freud 
could 
not 
leave 
out 
any 
detail 
likely 
to 
make 
his 
extremely 
novel 
thesis 
evidentially 
acceptable 
to 
those 
willing 
to 
sift 
data. 


Freud 
himself, 
however, 
realized 
the 
magnitude 
of 
the 
task 
which 
the 
reading 
of 
his 
magnum 
opus 
imposed 
upon 
those 
who 
have 
not 
been 
prepared 
for 
it 
by 
long 
psychological 
and 
scientific 
training 
and 
he 
abstracted 
from 
that 
gigantic 
work 
the 
parts 
which 
constitute 
the 
essential 
of 
his 
discoveries. 


The 
publishers 
of 
the 
present 
book 
deserve 
credit 
for 
presenting 
to 
the 
reading 
public 
the 
gist 
of 
Freud's 
psychology 
in 
the 
master's 
own 
words, 
and 



in 
a 
form 
which 
shall 
neither 
discourage 
beginners, 
nor 
appear 
too 
elementary 
to 
those 
who 
are 
more 
advanced 
in 
psychoanalytic 
study. 


Dream 
psychology 
is 
the 
key 
to 
Freud's 
works 
and 
to 
all 
modern 
psychology. 
With 
a 
simple, 
compact 
manual 
such 
as 
Dream 
Psychology 
there 
shall 
be 
no 
longer 
any 
excuse 
for 
ignorance 
of 
the 
most 
revolutionary 
psychological 
system 
of 
modern 
times.

I 


DREAMS 
HAVE 
A 
MEANING 


In 
what 
we 
may 
term 
"prescientific 
days" 
people 
were 
in 
no 
uncertainty 
about 
the 
interpretation 
of 
dreams. 
When 
they 
were 
recalled 
after 
awakening 
they 
were 
regarded 
as 
either 
the 
friendly 
or 
hostile 
manifestation 
of 
some 
higher 
powers, 
demoniacal 
and 
Divine. 
With 
the 
rise 
of 
scientific 
thought 
the 
whole 
of 
this 
expressive 
mythology 
was 
transferred 
to 
psychology; 
to-day 
there 
is 
but 
a 
small 
minority 
among 
educated 
persons 
who 
doubt 
that 
the 
dream 
is 
the 
dreamer's 
own 
psychical 
act. 


But 
since 
the 
downfall 
of 
the 
mythological 
hypothesis 
an 
interpretation 
of 
the 
dream 
has 
been 
wanting. 
The 
conditions 
of 
its 
origin; 
its 
relationship 
to 
our 
psychical 
life 
when 
we 
are 
awake; 
its 
independence 
of 
disturbances 
which, 
during 
the 
state 
of 
sleep, 
seem 
to 
compel 
notice; 
its 
many 
peculiarities 
repugnant 
to 
our 
waking 
thought; 
the 
incongruence 
between 
its 
images 
and 
the 
feelings 
they 
engender; 
then 
the 
dream's 
evanescence, 
the 
way 
in 
which, 
on 
awakening, 
our 
thoughts 
thrust 
it 
aside 
as 
something 
bizarre, 
and 
our 
reminiscences 
mutilating 
or 
rejecting 
it--all 
these 
and 
many 
other 
problems 
have 
for 
many 
hundred 
years 
demanded 
answers 
which 
up 
till 
now 
could 
never 
have 
been 
satisfactory. 
Before 
all 
there 
is 
the 
question 
as 
to 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
dream, 
a 
question 
which 
is 
in 
itself 
double-sided. 
There 
is, 
firstly, 
the 
psychical 
significance 
of 
the 
dream, 
its 
position 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
psychical 
processes, 
as 
to 
a 
possible 
biological 
function; 
secondly, 
has 
the 
dream 
a 
meaning--can 
sense 
be 
made 
of 
each 
single 
dream 
as 
of 
other 
mental 
syntheses? 


Three 
tendencies 
can 
be 
observed 
in 
the 
estimation 
of 
dreams. 
Many 
philosophers 
have 
given 
currency 
to 
one 
of 
these 
tendencies, 
one 
which 
at 
the 
same 
time 
preserves 
something 
of 
the 
dream's 
former 
over-valuation. 
The 
foundation 
of 
dream 
life 
is 
for 
them 
a 
peculiar 
state 
of 
psychical 
activity, 
which 
they 
even 
celebrate 
as 
elevation 
to 
some 
higher 
state. 
Schubert, 
for 
instance, 
claims: 
"The 
dream 
is 
the 
liberation 
of 
the 
spirit 
from 
the 
pressure 
of 
external 
nature, 
a 
detachment 
of 
the 
soul 
from 
the 
fetters 
of 
matter." 
Not 
all 
go 
so 
far 
as 
this, 
but 
many 
maintain 
that 
dreams 
have 
their 
origin 
in 
real 
spiritual 
excitations, 
and 
are 
the 
outward 
manifestations 
of 
spiritual 
powers 
whose 
free 
movements 
have 
been 
hampered 
during 
the 
day 
("Dream 



Phantasies," 
Scherner, 
Volkelt). 
A 
large 
number 
of 
observers 
acknowledge 
that 
dream 
life 
is 
capable 
of 
extraordinary 
achievements--at 
any 
rate, 
in 
certain 
fields 
("Memory"). 


In 
striking 
contradiction 
with 
this 
the 
majority 
of 
medical 
writers 
hardly 
admit 
that 
the 
dream 
is 
a 
psychical 
phenomenon 
at 
all. 
According 
to 
them 
dreams 
are 
provoked 
and 
initiated 
exclusively 
by 
stimuli 
proceeding 
from 
the 
senses 
or 
the 
body, 
which 
either 
reach 
the 
sleeper 
from 
without 
or 
are 
accidental 
disturbances 
of 
his 
internal 
organs. 
The 
dream 
has 
no 
greater 
claim 
to 
meaning 
and 
importance 
than 
the 
sound 
called 
forth 
by 
the 
ten 
fingers 
of 
a 
person 
quite 
unacquainted 
with 
music 
running 
his 
fingers 
over 
the 
keys 
of 
an 
instrument. 
The 
dream 
is 
to 
be 
regarded, 
says 
Binz, 
"as 
a 
physical 
process 
always 
useless, 
frequently 
morbid." 
All 
the 
peculiarities 
of 
dream 
life 
are 
explicable 
as 
the 
incoherent 
effort, 
due 
to 
some 
physiological 
stimulus, 
of 
certain 
organs, 
or 
of 
the 
cortical 
elements 
of 
a 
brain 
otherwise 
asleep. 


But 
slightly 
affected 
by 
scientific 
opinion 
and 
untroubled 
as 
to 
the 
origin 
of 
dreams, 
the 
popular 
view 
holds 
firmly 
to 
the 
belief 
that 
dreams 
really 
have 
got 
a 
meaning, 
in 
some 
way 
they 
do 
foretell 
the 
future, 
whilst 
the 
meaning 
can 
be 
unravelled 
in 
some 
way 
or 
other 
from 
its 
oft 
bizarre 
and 
enigmatical 
content. 
The 
reading 
of 
dreams 
consists 
in 
replacing 
the 
events 
of 
the 
dream, 
so 
far 
as 
remembered, 
by 
other 
events. 
This 
is 
done 
either 
scene 
by 
scene, 
according 
to 
some 
rigid 
key, 
or 
the 
dream 
as 
a 
whole 
is 
replaced 
by 
something 
else 
of 
which 
it 
was 
a 
symbol. 
Serious-minded 
persons 
laugh 
at 
these 
efforts--"Dreams 
are 
but 
sea-foam!" 


One 
day 
I 
discovered 
to 
my 
amazement 
that 
the 
popular 
view 
grounded 
in 
superstition, 
and 
not 
the 
medical 
one, 
comes 
nearer 
to 
the 
truth 
about 
dreams. 
I 
arrived 
at 
new 
conclusions 
about 
dreams 
by 
the 
use 
of 
a 
new 
method 
of 
psychological 
investigation, 
one 
which 
had 
rendered 
me 
good 
service 
in 
the 
investigation 
of 
phobias, 
obsessions, 
illusions, 
and 
the 
like, 
and 
which, 
under 
the 
name 
"psycho-analysis," 
had 
found 
acceptance 
by 
a 
whole 
school 
of 
investigators. 
The 
manifold 
analogies 
of 
dream 
life 
with 
the 
most 
diverse 
conditions 
of 
psychical 
disease 
in 
the 
waking 
state 
have 
been 
rightly 
insisted 
upon 
by 
a 
number 
of 
medical 
observers. 
It 
seemed, 
therefore, 
a 
priori, 
hopeful 
to 
apply 
to 
the 
interpretation 
of 
dreams 
methods 
of 
investigation 
which 
had 
been 
tested 
in 
psychopathological 
processes. 
Obsessions 
and 
those 
peculiar 
sensations 
of 
haunting 
dread 
remain 
as 
strange 
to 
normal 



consciousness 
as 
do 
dreams 
to 
our 
waking 
consciousness; 
their 
origin 
is 
as 
unknown 
to 
consciousness 
as 
is 
that 
of 
dreams. 
It 
was 
practical 
ends 
that 
impelled 
us, 
in 
these 
diseases, 
to 
fathom 
their 
origin 
and 
formation. 
Experience 
had 
shown 
us 
that 
a 
cure 
and 
a 
consequent 
mastery 
of 
the 
obsessing 
ideas 
did 
result 
when 
once 
those 
thoughts, 
the 
connecting 
links 
between 
the 
morbid 
ideas 
and 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
psychical 
content, 
were 
revealed 
which 
were 
heretofore 
veiled 
from 
consciousness. 
The 
procedure 
I 
employed 
for 
the 
interpretation 
of 
dreams 
thus 
arose 
from 
psychotherapy. 


This 
procedure 
is 
readily 
described, 
although 
its 
practice 
demands 
instruction 
and 
experience. 
Suppose 
the 
patient 
is 
suffering 
from 
intense 
morbid 
dread. 
He 
is 
requested 
to 
direct 
his 
attention 
to 
the 
idea 
in 
question, 
without, 
however, 
as 
he 
has 
so 
frequently 
done, 
meditating 
upon 
it. 
Every 
impression 
about 
it, 
without 
any 
exception, 
which 
occurs 
to 
him 
should 
be 
imparted 
to 
the 
doctor. 
The 
statement 
which 
will 
be 
perhaps 
then 
made, 
that 
he 
cannot 
concentrate 
his 
attention 
upon 
anything 
at 
all, 
is 
to 
be 
countered 
by 
assuring 
him 
most 
positively 
that 
such 
a 
blank 
state 
of 
mind 
is 
utterly 
impossible. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
a 
great 
number 
of 
impressions 
will 
soon 
occur, 
with 
which 
others 
will 
associate 
themselves. 
These 
will 
be 
invariably 
accompanied 
by 
the 
expression 
of 
the 
observer's 
opinion 
that 
they 
have 
no 
meaning 
or 
are 
unimportant. 
It 
will 
be 
at 
once 
noticed 
that 
it 
is 
this 
self-criticism 
which 
prevented 
the 
patient 
from 
imparting 
the 
ideas, 
which 
had 
indeed 
already 
excluded 
them 
from 
consciousness. 
If 
the 
patient 
can 
be 
induced 
to 
abandon 
this 
self-criticism 
and 
to 
pursue 
the 
trains 
of 
thought 
which 
are 
yielded 
by 
concentrating 
the 
attention, 
most 
significant 
matter 
will 
be 
obtained, 
matter 
which 
will 
be 
presently 
seen 
to 
be 
clearly 
linked 
to 
the 
morbid 
idea 
in 
question. 
Its 
connection 
with 
other 
ideas 
will 
be 
manifest, 
and 
later 
on 
will 
permit 
the 
replacement 
of 
the 
morbid 
idea 
by 
a 
fresh 
one, 
which 
is 
perfectly 
adapted 
to 
psychical 
continuity. 


This 
is 
not 
the 
place 
to 
examine 
thoroughly 
the 
hypothesis 
upon 
which 
this 
experiment 
rests, 
or 
the 
deductions 
which 
follow 
from 
its 
invariable 
success. 
It 
must 
suffice 
to 
state 
that 
we 
obtain 
matter 
enough 
for 
the 
resolution 
of 
every 
morbid 
idea 
if 
we 
especially 
direct 
our 
attention 
to 
the 
unbidden 
associations 
_which 
disturb 
our 
thoughts_--those 
which 
are 
otherwise 
put 
aside 
by 
the 
critic 
as 
worthless 
refuse. 
If 
the 
procedure 
is 
exercised 
on 
oneself, 
the 
best 
plan 
of 
helping 
the 
experiment 
is 
to 
write 
down 
at 
once 
all 
one's 
first 
indistinct 
fancies. 



I 
will 
now 
point 
out 
where 
this 
method 
leads 
when 
I 
apply 
it 
to 
the 
examination 
of 
dreams. 
Any 
dream 
could 
be 
made 
use 
of 
in 
this 
way. 
From 
certain 
motives 
I, 
however, 
choose 
a 
dream 
of 
my 
own, 
which 
appears 
confused 
and 
meaningless 
to 
my 
memory, 
and 
one 
which 
has 
the 
advantage 
of 
brevity. 
Probably 
my 
dream 
of 
last 
night 
satisfies 
the 
requirements. 
Its 
content, 
fixed 
immediately 
after 
awakening, 
runs 
as 
follows: 


_"Company; 
at 
table 
or 
table 
d'hôte.... 
Spinach 
is 
served. 
Mrs. 
E.L., 
sitting 
next 
to 
me, 
gives 
me 
her 
undivided 
attention, 
and 
places 
her 
hand 
familiarly 
upon 
my 
knee. 
In 
defence 
I 
remove 
her 
hand. 
Then 
she 
says: 
'But 
you 
have 
always 
had 
such 
beautiful 
eyes.'.... 
I 
then 
distinctly 
see 
something 
like 
two 
eyes 
as 
a 
sketch 
or 
as 
the 
contour 
of 
a 
spectacle 
lens...."_ 


This 
is 
the 
whole 
dream, 
or, 
at 
all 
events, 
all 
that 
I 
can 
remember. 
It 
appears 
to 
me 
not 
only 
obscure 
and 
meaningless, 
but 
more 
especially 
odd. 
Mrs. 
E.L. 
is 
a 
person 
with 
whom 
I 
am 
scarcely 
on 
visiting 
terms, 
nor 
to 
my 
knowledge 
have 
I 
ever 
desired 
any 
more 
cordial 
relationship. 
I 
have 
not 
seen 
her 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
and 
do 
not 
think 
there 
was 
any 
mention 
of 
her 
recently. 
No 
emotion 
whatever 
accompanied 
the 
dream 
process. 


Reflecting 
upon 
this 
dream 
does 
not 
make 
it 
a 
bit 
clearer 
to 
my 
mind. 
I 
will 
now, 
however, 
present 
the 
ideas, 
without 
premeditation 
and 
without 
criticism, 
which 
introspection 
yielded. 
I 
soon 
notice 
that 
it 
is 
an 
advantage 
to 
break 
up 
the 
dream 
into 
its 
elements, 
and 
to 
search 
out 
the 
ideas 
which 
link 
themselves 
to 
each 
fragment. 


_Company; 
at 
table 
or 
table 
d'hôte._ 
The 
recollection 
of 
the 
slight 
event 
with 
which 
the 
evening 
of 
yesterday 
ended 
is 
at 
once 
called 
up. 
I 
left 
a 
small 
party 
in 
the 
company 
of 
a 
friend, 
who 
offered 
to 
drive 
me 
home 
in 
his 
cab. 
"I 
prefer 
a 
taxi," 
he 
said; 
"that 
gives 
one 
such 
a 
pleasant 
occupation; 
there 
is 
always 
something 
to 
look 
at." 
When 
we 
were 
in 
the 
cab, 
and 
the 
cab-driver 
turned 
the 
disc 
so 
that 
the 
first 
sixty 
hellers 
were 
visible, 
I 
continued 
the 
jest. 
"We 
have 
hardly 
got 
in 
and 
we 
already 
owe 
sixty 
hellers. 
The 
taxi 
always 
reminds 
me 
of 
the 
table 
d'hôte. 
It 
makes 
me 
avaricious 
and 
selfish 
by 
continuously 
reminding 
me 
of 
my 
debt. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
mount 
up 
too 
quickly, 
and 
I 
am 
always 
afraid 
that 
I 
shall 
be 
at 
a 
disadvantage, 
just 
as 
I 
cannot 
resist 
at 
table 
d'hôte 
the 
comical 
fear 
that 
I 
am 
getting 
too 
little, 
that 
I 
must 
look 
after 
myself." 
In 
far-fetched 
connection 
with 
this 
I 
quote: 



"To 
earth, 
this 
weary 
earth, 
ye 
bring 
us, 
To 
guilt 
ye 
let 
us 
heedless 
go." 


Another 
idea 
about 
the 
table 
d'hôte. 
A 
few 
weeks 
ago 
I 
was 
very 
cross 
with 
my 
dear 
wife 
at 
the 
dinner-table 
at 
a 
Tyrolese 
health 
resort, 
because 
she 
was 
not 
sufficiently 
reserved 
with 
some 
neighbors 
with 
whom 
I 
wished 
to 
have 
absolutely 
nothing 
to 
do. 
I 
begged 
her 
to 
occupy 
herself 
rather 
with 
me 
than 
with 
the 
strangers. 
That 
is 
just 
as 
if 
I 
had 
_been 
at 
a 
disadvantage 
at 
the 
table 
d'hôte_. 
The 
contrast 
between 
the 
behavior 
of 
my 
wife 
at 
the 
table 
and 
that 
of 
Mrs. 
E.L. 
in 
the 
dream 
now 
strikes 
me: 
_"Addresses 
herself 
entirely 
to 
me."_ 


Further, 
I 
now 
notice 
that 
the 
dream 
is 
the 
reproduction 
of 
a 
little 
scene 
which 
transpired 
between 
my 
wife 
and 
myself 
when 
I 
was 
secretly 
courting 
her. 
The 
caressing 
under 
cover 
of 
the 
tablecloth 
was 
an 
answer 
to 
a 
wooer's 
passionate 
letter. 
In 
the 
dream, 
however, 
my 
wife 
is 
replaced 
by 
the 
unfamiliar 
E.L. 


Mrs. 
E.L. 
is 
the 
daughter 
of 
a 
man 
to 
whom 
I 
owed 
money! 
I 
cannot 
help 
noticing 
that 
here 
there 
is 
revealed 
an 
unsuspected 
connection 
between 
the 
dream 
content 
and 
my 
thoughts. 
If 
the 
chain 
of 
associations 
be 
followed 
up 
which 
proceeds 
from 
one 
element 
of 
the 
dream 
one 
is 
soon 
led 
back 
to 
another 
of 
its 
elements. 
The 
thoughts 
evoked 
by 
the 
dream 
stir 
up 
associations 
which 
were 
not 
noticeable 
in 
the 
dream 
itself. 


Is 
it 
not 
customary, 
when 
some 
one 
expects 
others 
to 
look 
after 
his 
interests 
without 
any 
advantage 
to 
themselves, 
to 
ask 
the 
innocent 
question 
satirically: 
"Do 
you 
think 
this 
will 
be 
done 
_for 
the 
sake 
of 
your 
beautiful 
eyes_?" 
Hence 
Mrs. 
E.L.'s 
speech 
in 
the 
dream. 
"You 
have 
always 
had 
such 
beautiful 
eyes," 
means 
nothing 
but 
"people 
always 
do 
everything 
to 
you 
for 
love 
of 
you; 
you 
have 
had 
everything 
for 
nothing." 
The 
contrary 
is, 
of 
course, 
the 
truth; 
I 
have 
always 
paid 
dearly 
for 
whatever 
kindness 
others 
have 
shown 
me. 
Still, 
the 
fact 
that 
I 
had 
a 
ride 
for 
nothing 
yesterday 
when 
my 
friend 
drove 
me 
home 
in 
his 
cab 
must 
have 
made 
an 
impression 
upon 
me. 


In 
any 
case, 
the 
friend 
whose 
guests 
we 
were 
yesterday 
has 
often 
made 
me 
his 
debtor. 
Recently 
I 
allowed 
an 
opportunity 
of 
requiting 
him 
to 
go 
by. 
He 
has 
had 
only 
one 
present 
from 
me, 
an 
antique 
shawl, 
upon 
which 
eyes 
are 
painted 
all 
round, 
a 
so-called 
Occhiale, 
as 
a 
charm 
against 
the 
Malocchio. 
Moreover, 
he 
is 
an 
eye 
specialist. 
That 
same 
evening 
I 
had 
asked 
him 
after 
a 
patient 
whom 
I 
had 
sent 
to 
him 
for 
glasses. 



As 
I 
remarked, 
nearly 
all 
parts 
of 
the 
dream 
have 
been 
brought 
into 
this 
new 
connection. 
I 
still 
might 
ask 
why 
in 
the 
dream 
it 
was 
spinach 
that 
was 
served 
up. 
Because 
spinach 
called 
up 
a 
little 
scene 
which 
recently 
occurred 
at 
our 
table. 
A 
child, 
whose 
beautiful 
eyes 
are 
really 
deserving 
of 
praise, 
refused 
to 
eat 
spinach. 
As 
a 
child 
I 
was 
just 
the 
same; 
for 
a 
long 
time 
I 
loathed 
spinach, 
until 
in 
later 
life 
my 
tastes 
altered, 
and 
it 
became 
one 
of 
my 
favorite 
dishes. 
The 
mention 
of 
this 
dish 
brings 
my 
own 
childhood 
and 
that 
of 
my 
child's 
near 
together. 
"You 
should 
be 
glad 
that 
you 
have 
some 
spinach," 
his 
mother 
had 
said 
to 
the 
little 
gourmet. 
"Some 
children 
would 
be 
very 
glad 
to 
get 
spinach." 
Thus 
I 
am 
reminded 
of 
the 
parents' 
duties 
towards 
their 
children. 
Goethe's 
words-


"To 
earth, 
this 
weary 
earth, 
ye 
bring 
us, 
To 
guilt 
ye 
let 
us 
heedless 
go"-


take 
on 
another 
meaning 
in 
this 
connection. 


Here 
I 
will 
stop 
in 
order 
that 
I 
may 
recapitulate 
the 
results 
of 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
dream. 
By 
following 
the 
associations 
which 
were 
linked 
to 
the 
single 
elements 
of 
the 
dream 
torn 
from 
their 
context, 
I 
have 
been 
led 
to 
a 
series 
of 
thoughts 
and 
reminiscences 
where 
I 
am 
bound 
to 
recognize 
interesting 
expressions 
of 
my 
psychical 
life. 
The 
matter 
yielded 
by 
an 
analysis 
of 
the 
dream 
stands 
in 
intimate 
relationship 
with 
the 
dream 
content, 
but 
this 
relationship 
is 
so 
special 
that 
I 
should 
never 
have 
been 
able 
to 
have 
inferred 
the 
new 
discoveries 
directly 
from 
the 
dream 
itself. 
The 
dream 
was 
passionless, 
disconnected, 
and 
unintelligible. 
During 
the 
time 
that 
I 
am 
unfolding 
the 
thoughts 
at 
the 
back 
of 
the 
dream 
I 
feel 
intense 
and 
well-
grounded 
emotions. 
The 
thoughts 
themselves 
fit 
beautifully 
together 
into 
chains 
logically 
bound 
together 
with 
certain 
central 
ideas 
which 
ever 
repeat 
themselves. 
Such 
ideas 
not 
represented 
in 
the 
dream 
itself 
are 
in 
this 
instance 
the 
antitheses 
_selfish, 
unselfish, 
to 
be 
indebted, 
to 
work 
for 
nothing_. 
I 
could 
draw 
closer 
the 
threads 
of 
the 
web 
which 
analysis 
has 
disclosed, 
and 
would 
then 
be 
able 
to 
show 
how 
they 
all 
run 
together 
into 
a 
single 
knot; 
I 
am 
debarred 
from 
making 
this 
work 
public 
by 
considerations 
of 
a 
private, 
not 
of 
a 
scientific, 
nature. 
After 
having 
cleared 
up 
many 
things 
which 
I 
do 
not 
willingly 
acknowledge 
as 
mine, 
I 
should 
have 
much 
to 
reveal 
which 
had 
better 
remain 
my 
secret. 
Why, 
then, 
do 
not 
I 
choose 
another 
dream 
whose 
analysis 
would 
be 
more 
suitable 
for 
publication, 
so 
that 
I 
could 
awaken 
a 



fairer 
conviction 
of 
the 
sense 
and 
cohesion 
of 
the 
results 
disclosed 
by 
analysis? 
The 
answer 
is, 
because 
every 
dream 
which 
I 
investigate 
leads 
to 
the 
same 
difficulties 
and 
places 
me 
under 
the 
same 
need 
of 
discretion; 
nor 
should 
I 
forgo 
this 
difficulty 
any 
the 
more 
were 
I 
to 
analyze 
the 
dream 
of 
some 
one 
else. 
That 
could 
only 
be 
done 
when 
opportunity 
allowed 
all 
concealment 
to 
be 
dropped 
without 
injury 
to 
those 
who 
trusted 
me. 


The 
conclusion 
which 
is 
now 
forced 
upon 
me 
is 
that 
the 
dream 
is 
a 
sort 
of 
substitution 
for 
those 
emotional 
and 
intellectual 
trains 
of 
thought 
which 
I 
attained 
after 
complete 
analysis. 
I 
do 
not 
yet 
know 
the 
process 
by 
which 
the 
dream 
arose 
from 
those 
thoughts, 
but 
I 
perceive 
that 
it 
is 
wrong 
to 
regard 
the 
dream 
as 
psychically 
unimportant, 
a 
purely 
physical 
process 
which 
has 
arisen 
from 
the 
activity 
of 
isolated 
cortical 
elements 
awakened 
out 
of 
sleep. 


I 
must 
further 
remark 
that 
the 
dream 
is 
far 
shorter 
than 
the 
thoughts 
which 
I 
hold 
it 
replaces; 
whilst 
analysis 
discovered 
that 
the 
dream 
was 
provoked 
by 
an 
unimportant 
occurrence 
the 
evening 
before 
the 
dream. 


Naturally, 
I 
would 
not 
draw 
such 
far-reaching 
conclusions 
if 
only 
one 
analysis 
were 
known 
to 
me. 
Experience 
has 
shown 
me 
that 
when 
the 
associations 
of 
any 
dream 
are 
honestly 
followed 
such 
a 
chain 
of 
thought 
is 
revealed, 
the 
constituent 
parts 
of 
the 
dream 
reappear 
correctly 
and 
sensibly 
linked 
together; 
the 
slight 
suspicion 
that 
this 
concatenation 
was 
merely 
an 
accident 
of 
a 
single 
first 
observation 
must, 
therefore, 
be 
absolutely 
relinquished. 
I 
regard 
it, 
therefore, 
as 
my 
right 
to 
establish 
this 
new 
view 
by 
a 
proper 
nomenclature. 
I 
contrast 
the 
dream 
which 
my 
memory 
evokes 
with 
the 
dream 
and 
other 
added 
matter 
revealed 
by 
analysis: 
the 
former 
I 
call 
the 
dream's 
_manifest 
content_; 
the 
latter, 
without 
at 
first 
further 
subdivision, 
its 
latent 
content. 
I 
arrive 
at 
two 
new 
problems 
hitherto 
unformulated: 
(1) 
What 
is 
the 
psychical 
process 
which 
has 
transformed 
the 
latent 
content 
of 
the 
dream 
into 
its 
manifest 
content? 
(2) 
What 
is 
the 
motive 
or 
the 
motives 
which 
have 
made 
such 
transformation 
exigent? 
The 
process 
by 
which 
the 
change 
from 
latent 
to 
manifest 
content 
is 
executed 
I 
name 
the 
_dream-work_. 
In 
contrast 
with 
this 
is 
the 
work 
of 
analysis, 
which 
produces 
the 
reverse 
transformation. 
The 
other 
problems 
of 
the 
dream--the 
inquiry 
as 
to 
its 
stimuli, 
as 
to 
the 
source 
of 
its 
materials, 
as 
to 
its 
possible 
purpose, 
the 
function 
of 
dreaming, 
the 
forgetting 
of 
dreams--these 
I 
will 
discuss 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
latent 
dream-content. 



I 
shall 
take 
every 
care 
to 
avoid 
a 
confusion 
between 
the 
manifest 
and 
the 
latent 
content, 
for 
I 
ascribe 
all 
the 
contradictory 
as 
well 
as 
the 
incorrect 
accounts 
of 
dream-life 
to 
the 
ignorance 
of 
this 
latent 
content, 
now 
first 
laid 
bare 
through 
analysis. 


The 
conversion 
of 
the 
latent 
dream 
thoughts 
into 
those 
manifest 
deserves 
our 
close 
study 
as 
the 
first 
known 
example 
of 
the 
transformation 
of 
psychical 
stuff 
from 
one 
mode 
of 
expression 
into 
another. 
From 
a 
mode 
of 
expression 
which, 
moreover, 
is 
readily 
intelligible 
into 
another 
which 
we 
can 
only 
penetrate 
by 
effort 
and 
with 
guidance, 
although 
this 
new 
mode 
must 
be 
equally 
reckoned 
as 
an 
effort 
of 
our 
own 
psychical 
activity. 
From 
the 
standpoint 
of 
the 
relationship 
of 
latent 
to 
manifest 
dream-content, 
dreams 
can 
be 
divided 
into 
three 
classes. 
We 
can, 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
distinguish 
those 
dreams 
which 
have 
a 
meaning 
and 
are, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
intelligible, 
which 
allow 
us 
to 
penetrate 
into 
our 
psychical 
life 
without 
further 
ado. 
Such 
dreams 
are 
numerous; 
they 
are 
usually 
short, 
and, 
as 
a 
general 
rule, 
do 
not 
seem 
very 
noticeable, 
because 
everything 
remarkable 
or 
exciting 
surprise 
is 
absent. 
Their 
occurrence 
is, 
moreover, 
a 
strong 
argument 
against 
the 
doctrine 
which 
derives 
the 
dream 
from 
the 
isolated 
activity 
of 
certain 
cortical 
elements. 
All 
signs 
of 
a 
lowered 
or 
subdivided 
psychical 
activity 
are 
wanting. 
Yet 
we 
never 
raise 
any 
objection 
to 
characterizing 
them 
as 
dreams, 
nor 
do 
we 
confound 
them 
with 
the 
products 
of 
our 
waking 
life. 


A 
second 
group 
is 
formed 
by 
those 
dreams 
which 
are 
indeed 
self-coherent 
and 
have 
a 
distinct 
meaning, 
but 
appear 
strange 
because 
we 
are 
unable 
to 
reconcile 
their 
meaning 
with 
our 
mental 
life. 
That 
is 
the 
case 
when 
we 
dream, 
for 
instance, 
that 
some 
dear 
relative 
has 
died 
of 
plague 
when 
we 
know 
of 
no 
ground 
for 
expecting, 
apprehending, 
or 
assuming 
anything 
of 
the 
sort; 
we 
can 
only 
ask 
ourself 
wonderingly: 
"What 
brought 
that 
into 
my 
head?" 
To 
the 
third 
group 
those 
dreams 
belong 
which 
are 
void 
of 
both 
meaning 
and 
intelligibility; 
they 
are 
_incoherent, 
complicated, 
and 
meaningless_. 
The 
overwhelming 
number 
of 
our 
dreams 
partake 
of 
this 
character, 
and 
this 
has 
given 
rise 
to 
the 
contemptuous 
attitude 
towards 
dreams 
and 
the 
medical 
theory 
of 
their 
limited 
psychical 
activity. 
It 
is 
especially 
in 
the 
longer 
and 
more 
complicated 
dream-plots 
that 
signs 
of 
incoherence 
are 
seldom 
missing. 


The 
contrast 
between 
manifest 
and 
latent 
dream-content 
is 
clearly 
only 
of 



value 
for 
the 
dreams 
of 
the 
second 
and 
more 
especially 
for 
those 
of 
the 
third 
class. 
Here 
are 
problems 
which 
are 
only 
solved 
when 
the 
manifest 
dream 
is 
replaced 
by 
its 
latent 
content; 
it 
was 
an 
example 
of 
this 
kind, 
a 
complicated 
and 
unintelligible 
dream, 
that 
we 
subjected 
to 
analysis. 
Against 
our 
expectation 
we, 
however, 
struck 
upon 
reasons 
which 
prevented 
a 
complete 
cognizance 
of 
the 
latent 
dream 
thought. 
On 
the 
repetition 
of 
this 
same 
experience 
we 
were 
forced 
to 
the 
supposition 
that 
there 
is 
an 
_intimate 
bond, 
with 
laws 
of 
its 
own, 
between 
the 
unintelligible 
and 
complicated 
nature 
of 
the 
dream 
and 
the 
difficulties 
attending 
communication 
of 
the 
thoughts 
connected 
with 
the 
dream_. 
Before 
investigating 
the 
nature 
of 
this 
bond, 
it 
will 
be 
advantageous 
to 
turn 
our 
attention 
to 
the 
more 
readily 
intelligible 
dreams 
of 
the 
first 
class 
where, 
the 
manifest 
and 
latent 
content 
being 
identical, 
the 
dream 
work 
seems 
to 
be 
omitted. 


The 
investigation 
of 
these 
dreams 
is 
also 
advisable 
from 
another 
standpoint. 
The 
dreams 
of 
children 
are 
of 
this 
nature; 
they 
have 
a 
meaning, 
and 
are 
not 
bizarre. 
This, 
by 
the 
way, 
is 
a 
further 
objection 
to 
reducing 
dreams 
to 
a 
dissociation 
of 
cerebral 
activity 
in 
sleep, 
for 
why 
should 
such 
a 
lowering 
of 
psychical 
functions 
belong 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
sleep 
in 
adults, 
but 
not 
in 
children? 
We 
are, 
however, 
fully 
justified 
in 
expecting 
that 
the 
explanation 
of 
psychical 
processes 
in 
children, 
essentially 
simplified 
as 
they 
may 
be, 
should 
serve 
as 
an 
indispensable 
preparation 
towards 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
adult. 


I 
shall 
therefore 
cite 
some 
examples 
of 
dreams 
which 
I 
have 
gathered 
from 
children. 
A 
girl 
of 
nineteen 
months 
was 
made 
to 
go 
without 
food 
for 
a 
day 
because 
she 
had 
been 
sick 
in 
the 
morning, 
and, 
according 
to 
nurse, 
had 
made 
herself 
ill 
through 
eating 
strawberries. 
During 
the 
night, 
after 
her 
day 
of 
fasting, 
she 
was 
heard 
calling 
out 
her 
name 
during 
sleep, 
and 
adding: 
"_Tawberry, 
eggs, 
pap_." 
She 
is 
dreaming 
that 
she 
is 
eating, 
and 
selects 
out 
of 
her 
menu 
exactly 
what 
she 
supposes 
she 
will 
not 
get 
much 
of 
just 
now. 


The 
same 
kind 
of 
dream 
about 
a 
forbidden 
dish 
was 
that 
of 
a 
little 
boy 
of 
twenty-two 
months. 
The 
day 
before 
he 
was 
told 
to 
offer 
his 
uncle 
a 
present 
of 
a 
small 
basket 
of 
cherries, 
of 
which 
the 
child 
was, 
of 
course, 
only 
allowed 
one 
to 
taste. 
He 
woke 
up 
with 
the 
joyful 
news: 
"Hermann 
eaten 
up 
all 
the 
cherries." 


A 
girl 
of 
three 
and 
a 
half 
years 
had 
made 
during 
the 
day 
a 
sea 
trip 
which 
was 



too 
short 
for 
her, 
and 
she 
cried 
when 
she 
had 
to 
get 
out 
of 
the 
boat. 
The 
next 
morning 
her 
story 
was 
that 
during 
the 
night 
she 
had 
been 
on 
the 
sea, 
thus 
continuing 
the 
interrupted 
trip. 


A 
boy 
of 
five 
and 
a 
half 
years 
was 
not 
at 
all 
pleased 
with 
his 
party 
during 
a 
walk 
in 
the 
Dachstein 
region. 
Whenever 
a 
new 
peak 
came 
into 
sight 
he 
asked 
if 
that 
were 
the 
Dachstein, 
and, 
finally, 
refused 
to 
accompany 
the 
party 
to 
the 
waterfall. 
His 
behavior 
was 
ascribed 
to 
fatigue; 
but 
a 
better 
explanation 
was 
forthcoming 
when 
the 
next 
morning 
he 
told 
his 
dream: 
he 
had 
ascended 
the 
Dachstein. 
Obviously 
he 
expected 
the 
ascent 
of 
the 
Dachstein 
to 
be 
the 
object 
of 
the 
excursion, 
and 
was 
vexed 
by 
not 
getting 
a 
glimpse 
of 
the 
mountain. 
The 
dream 
gave 
him 
what 
the 
day 
had 
withheld. 
The 
dream 
of 
a 
girl 
of 
six 
was 
similar; 
her 
father 
had 
cut 
short 
the 
walk 
before 
reaching 
the 
promised 
objective 
on 
account 
of 
the 
lateness 
of 
the 
hour. 
On 
the 
way 
back 
she 
noticed 
a 
signpost 
giving 
the 
name 
of 
another 
place 
for 
excursions; 
her 
father 
promised 
to 
take 
her 
there 
also 
some 
other 
day. 
She 
greeted 
her 
father 
next 
day 
with 
the 
news 
that 
she 
had 
dreamt 
that 
her 
father 
had 
been 
with 
her 
to 
both 
places. 


What 
is 
common 
in 
all 
these 
dreams 
is 
obvious. 
They 
completely 
satisfy 
wishes 
excited 
during 
the 
day 
which 
remain 
unrealized. 
They 
are 
simply 
and 
undisguisedly 
realizations 
of 
wishes. 


The 
following 
child-dream, 
not 
quite 
understandable 
at 
first 
sight, 
is 
nothing 
else 
than 
a 
wish 
realized. 
On 
account 
of 
poliomyelitis 
a 
girl, 
not 
quite 
four 
years 
of 
age, 
was 
brought 
from 
the 
country 
into 
town, 
and 
remained 
over 
night 
with 
a 
childless 
aunt 
in 
a 
big--for 
her, 
naturally, 
huge--bed. 
The 
next 
morning 
she 
stated 
that 
she 
had 
dreamt 
that 
_the 
bed 
was 
much 
too 
small 
for 
her, 
so 
that 
she 
could 
find 
no 
place 
in 
it_. 
To 
explain 
this 
dream 
as 
a 
wish 
is 
easy 
when 
we 
remember 
that 
to 
be 
"big" 
is 
a 
frequently 
expressed 
wish 
of 
all 
children. 
The 
bigness 
of 
the 
bed 
reminded 
Miss 
Little-Would-be-Big 
only 
too 
forcibly 
of 
her 
smallness. 
This 
nasty 
situation 
became 
righted 
in 
her 
dream, 
and 
she 
grew 
so 
big 
that 
the 
bed 
now 
became 
too 
small 
for 
her. 


Even 
when 
children's 
dreams 
are 
complicated 
and 
polished, 
their 
comprehension 
as 
a 
realization 
of 
desire 
is 
fairly 
evident. 
A 
boy 
of 
eight 
dreamt 
that 
he 
was 
being 
driven 
with 
Achilles 
in 
a 
war-chariot, 
guided 
by 
Diomedes. 
The 
day 
before 
he 
was 
assiduously 
reading 
about 
great 
heroes. 
It 



is 
easy 
to 
show 
that 
he 
took 
these 
heroes 
as 
his 
models, 
and 
regretted 
that 
he 
was 
not 
living 
in 
those 
days. 


From 
this 
short 
collection 
a 
further 
characteristic 
of 
the 
dreams 
of 
children 
is 
manifest--their 
connection 
with 
the 
life 
of 
the 
day. 
The 
desires 
which 
are 
realized 
in 
these 
dreams 
are 
left 
over 
from 
the 
day 
or, 
as 
a 
rule, 
the 
day 
previous, 
and 
the 
feeling 
has 
become 
intently 
emphasized 
and 
fixed 
during 
the 
day 
thoughts. 
Accidental 
and 
indifferent 
matters, 
or 
what 
must 
appear 
so 
to 
the 
child, 
find 
no 
acceptance 
in 
the 
contents 
of 
the 
dream. 


Innumerable 
instances 
of 
such 
dreams 
of 
the 
infantile 
type 
can 
be 
found 
among 
adults 
also, 
but, 
as 
mentioned, 
these 
are 
mostly 
exactly 
like 
the 
manifest 
content. 
Thus, 
a 
random 
selection 
of 
persons 
will 
generally 
respond 
to 
thirst 
at 
night-time 
with 
a 
dream 
about 
drinking, 
thus 
striving 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
the 
sensation 
and 
to 
let 
sleep 
continue. 
Many 
persons 
frequently 
have 
these 
comforting 
dreams 
before 
waking, 
just 
when 
they 
are 
called. 
They 
then 
dream 
that 
they 
are 
already 
up, 
that 
they 
are 
washing, 
or 
already 
in 
school, 
at 
the 
office, 
etc., 
where 
they 
ought 
to 
be 
at 
a 
given 
time. 
The 
night 
before 
an 
intended 
journey 
one 
not 
infrequently 
dreams 
that 
one 
has 
already 
arrived 
at 
the 
destination; 
before 
going 
to 
a 
play 
or 
to 
a 
party 
the 
dream 
not 
infrequently 
anticipates, 
in 
impatience, 
as 
it 
were, 
the 
expected 
pleasure. 
At 
other 
times 
the 
dream 
expresses 
the 
realization 
of 
the 
desire 
somewhat 
indirectly; 
some 
connection, 
some 
sequel 
must 
be 
known--the 
first 
step 
towards 
recognizing 
the 
desire. 
Thus, 
when 
a 
husband 
related 
to 
me 
the 
dream 
of 
his 
young 
wife, 
that 
her 
monthly 
period 
had 
begun, 
I 
had 
to 
bethink 
myself 
that 
the 
young 
wife 
would 
have 
expected 
a 
pregnancy 
if 
the 
period 
had 
been 
absent. 
The 
dream 
is 
then 
a 
sign 
of 
pregnancy. 
Its 
meaning 
is 
that 
it 
shows 
the 
wish 
realized 
that 
pregnancy 
should 
not 
occur 
just 
yet. 
Under 
unusual 
and 
extreme 
circumstances, 
these 
dreams 
of 
the 
infantile 
type 
become 
very 
frequent. 
The 
leader 
of 
a 
polar 
expedition 
tells 
us, 
for 
instance, 
that 
during 
the 
wintering 
amid 
the 
ice 
the 
crew, 
with 
their 
monotonous 
diet 
and 
slight 
rations, 
dreamt 
regularly, 
like 
children, 
of 
fine 
meals, 
of 
mountains 
of 
tobacco, 
and 
of 
home. 


It 
is 
not 
uncommon 
that 
out 
of 
some 
long, 
complicated 
and 
intricate 
dream 
one 
specially 
lucid 
part 
stands 
out 
containing 
unmistakably 
the 
realization 
of 
a 
desire, 
but 
bound 
up 
with 
much 
unintelligible 
matter. 
On 
more 
frequently 
analyzing 
the 
seemingly 
more 
transparent 
dreams 
of 
adults, 
it 
is 
astonishing 
to 
discover 
that 
these 
are 
rarely 
as 
simple 
as 
the 
dreams 
of 
children, 
and 
that 



they 
cover 
another 
meaning 
beyond 
that 
of 
the 
realization 
of 
a 
wish. 


It 
would 
certainly 
be 
a 
simple 
and 
convenient 
solution 
of 
the 
riddle 
if 
the 
work 
of 
analysis 
made 
it 
at 
all 
possible 
for 
us 
to 
trace 
the 
meaningless 
and 
intricate 
dreams 
of 
adults 
back 
to 
the 
infantile 
type, 
to 
the 
realization 
of 
some 
intensely 
experienced 
desire 
of 
the 
day. 
But 
there 
is 
no 
warrant 
for 
such 
an 
expectation. 
Their 
dreams 
are 
generally 
full 
of 
the 
most 
indifferent 
and 
bizarre 
matter, 
and 
no 
trace 
of 
the 
realization 
of 
the 
wish 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
their 
content. 


Before 
leaving 
these 
infantile 
dreams, 
which 
are 
obviously 
unrealized 
desires, 
we 
must 
not 
fail 
to 
mention 
another 
chief 
characteristic 
of 
dreams, 
one 
that 
has 
been 
long 
noticed, 
and 
one 
which 
stands 
out 
most 
clearly 
in 
this 
class. 
I 
can 
replace 
any 
of 
these 
dreams 
by 
a 
phrase 
expressing 
a 
desire. 
If 
the 
sea 
trip 
had 
only 
lasted 
longer; 
if 
I 
were 
only 
washed 
and 
dressed; 
if 
I 
had 
only 
been 
allowed 
to 
keep 
the 
cherries 
instead 
of 
giving 
them 
to 
my 
uncle. 
But 
the 
dream 
gives 
something 
more 
than 
the 
choice, 
for 
here 
the 
desire 
is 
already 
realized; 
its 
realization 
is 
real 
and 
actual. 
The 
dream 
presentations 
consist 
chiefly, 
if 
not 
wholly, 
of 
scenes 
and 
mainly 
of 
visual 
sense 
images. 
Hence 
a 
kind 
of 
transformation 
is 
not 
entirely 
absent 
in 
this 
class 
of 
dreams, 
and 
this 
may 
be 
fairly 
designated 
as 
the 
dream 
work. 
_An 
idea 
merely 
existing 
in 
the 
region 
of 
possibility 
is 
replaced 
by 
a 
vision 
of 
its 
accomplishment._ 



II 


THE 
DREAM 
MECHANISM 


We 
are 
compelled 
to 
assume 
that 
such 
transformation 
of 
scene 
has 
also 
taken 
place 
in 
intricate 
dreams, 
though 
we 
do 
not 
know 
whether 
it 
has 
encountered 
any 
possible 
desire. 
The 
dream 
instanced 
at 
the 
commencement, 
which 
we 
analyzed 
somewhat 
thoroughly, 
did 
give 
us 
occasion 
in 
two 
places 
to 
suspect 
something 
of 
the 
kind. 
Analysis 
brought 
out 
that 
my 
wife 
was 
occupied 
with 
others 
at 
table, 
and 
that 
I 
did 
not 
like 
it; 
in 
the 
dream 
itself 
exactly 
the 
opposite 
occurs, 
for 
the 
person 
who 
replaces 
my 
wife 
gives 
me 
her 
undivided 
attention. 
But 
can 
one 
wish 
for 
anything 
pleasanter 
after 
a 
disagreeable 
incident 
than 
that 
the 
exact 
contrary 
should 
have 
occurred, 
just 
as 
the 
dream 
has 
it? 
The 
stinging 
thought 
in 
the 
analysis, 
that 
I 
have 
never 
had 
anything 
for 
nothing, 
is 
similarly 
connected 
with 
the 
woman's 
remark 
in 
the 
dream: 
"You 
have 
always 
had 
such 
beautiful 
eyes." 
Some 
portion 
of 
the 
opposition 
between 
the 
latent 
and 
manifest 
content 
of 
the 
dream 
must 
be 
therefore 
derived 
from 
the 
realization 
of 
a 
wish. 


Another 
manifestation 
of 
the 
dream 
work 
which 
all 
incoherent 
dreams 
have 
in 
common 
is 
still 
more 
noticeable. 
Choose 
any 
instance, 
and 
compare 
the 
number 
of 
separate 
elements 
in 
it, 
or 
the 
extent 
of 
the 
dream, 
if 
written 
down, 
with 
the 
dream 
thoughts 
yielded 
by 
analysis, 
and 
of 
which 
but 
a 
trace 
can 
be 
refound 
in 
the 
dream 
itself. 
There 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
that 
the 
dream 
working 
has 
resulted 
in 
an 
extraordinary 
compression 
or 
condensation. 
It 
is 
not 
at 
first 
easy 
to 
form 
an 
opinion 
as 
to 
the 
extent 
of 
the 
condensation; 
the 
more 
deeply 
you 
go 
into 
the 
analysis, 
the 
more 
deeply 
you 
are 
impressed 
by 
it. 
There 
will 
be 
found 
no 
factor 
in 
the 
dream 
whence 
the 
chains 
of 
associations 
do 
not 
lead 
in 
two 
or 
more 
directions, 
no 
scene 
which 
has 
not 
been 
pieced 
together 
out 
of 
two 
or 
more 
impressions 
and 
events. 
For 
instance, 
I 
once 
dreamt 
about 
a 
kind 
of 
swimming-bath 
where 
the 
bathers 
suddenly 
separated 
in 
all 
directions; 
at 
one 
place 
on 
the 
edge 
a 
person 
stood 
bending 
towards 
one 
of 
the 
bathers 
as 
if 
to 
drag 
him 
out. 
The 
scene 
was 
a 
composite 
one, 
made 
up 
out 
of 
an 
event 
that 
occurred 
at 
the 
time 
of 
puberty, 
and 
of 
two 
pictures, 
one 
of 
which 
I 
had 
seen 
just 
shortly 
before 
the 
dream. 
The 
two 
pictures 
were 
The 
Surprise 
in 
the 
Bath, 
from 
Schwind's 
Cycle 
of 
the 
Melusine 
(note 
the 
bathers 
suddenly 
separating), 
and 
The 
Flood, 
by 
an 
Italian 
master. 
The 
little 
incident 
was 
that 
I 
once 
witnessed 
a 
lady, 
who 
had 
tarried 
in 
the 
swimming-bath 
until 
the 
men's 
hour, 



being 
helped 
out 
of 
the 
water 
by 
the 
swimming-master. 
The 
scene 
in 
the 
dream 
which 
was 
selected 
for 
analysis 
led 
to 
a 
whole 
group 
of 
reminiscences, 
each 
one 
of 
which 
had 
contributed 
to 
the 
dream 
content. 
First 
of 
all 
came 
the 
little 
episode 
from 
the 
time 
of 
my 
courting, 
of 
which 
I 
have 
already 
spoken; 
the 
pressure 
of 
a 
hand 
under 
the 
table 
gave 
rise 
in 
the 
dream 
to 
the 
"under 
the 
table," 
which 
I 
had 
subsequently 
to 
find 
a 
place 
for 
in 
my 
recollection. 
There 
was, 
of 
course, 
at 
the 
time 
not 
a 
word 
about 
"undivided 
attention." 
Analysis 
taught 
me 
that 
this 
factor 
is 
the 
realization 
of 
a 
desire 
through 
its 
contradictory 
and 
related 
to 
the 
behavior 
of 
my 
wife 
at 
the 
table 
d'hôte. 
An 
exactly 
similar 
and 
much 
more 
important 
episode 
of 
our 
courtship, 
one 
which 
separated 
us 
for 
an 
entire 
day, 
lies 
hidden 
behind 
this 
recent 
recollection. 
The 
intimacy, 
the 
hand 
resting 
upon 
the 
knee, 
refers 
to 
a 
quite 
different 
connection 
and 
to 
quite 
other 
persons. 
This 
element 
in 
the 
dream 
becomes 
again 
the 
starting-point 
of 
two 
distinct 
series 
of 
reminiscences, 
and 
so 
on. 


The 
stuff 
of 
the 
dream 
thoughts 
which 
has 
been 
accumulated 
for 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
dream 
scene 
must 
be 
naturally 
fit 
for 
this 
application. 
There 
must 
be 
one 
or 
more 
common 
factors. 
The 
dream 
work 
proceeds 
like 
Francis 
Galton 
with 
his 
family 
photographs. 
The 
different 
elements 
are 
put 
one 
on 
top 
of 
the 
other; 
what 
is 
common 
to 
the 
composite 
picture 
stands 
out 
clearly, 
the 
opposing 
details 
cancel 
each 
other. 
This 
process 
of 
reproduction 
partly 
explains 
the 
wavering 
statements, 
of 
a 
peculiar 
vagueness, 
in 
so 
many 
elements 
of 
the 
dream. 
For 
the 
interpretation 
of 
dreams 
this 
rule 
holds 
good: 
When 
analysis 
discloses 
uncertainty, 
as 
to 
_either_--or 
read 
and, 
taking 
each 
section 
of 
the 
apparent 
alternatives 
as 
a 
separate 
outlet 
for 
a 
series 
of 
impressions. 


When 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
common 
between 
the 
dream 
thoughts, 
the 
dream 
work 
takes 
the 
trouble 
to 
create 
a 
something, 
in 
order 
to 
make 
a 
common 
presentation 
feasible 
in 
the 
dream. 
The 
simplest 
way 
to 
approximate 
two 
dream 
thoughts, 
which 
have 
as 
yet 
nothing 
in 
common, 
consists 
in 
making 
such 
a 
change 
in 
the 
actual 
expression 
of 
one 
idea 
as 
will 
meet 
a 
slight 
responsive 
recasting 
in 
the 
form 
of 
the 
other 
idea. 
The 
process 
is 
analogous 
to 
that 
of 
rhyme, 
when 
consonance 
supplies 
the 
desired 
common 
factor. 
A 
good 
deal 
of 
the 
dream 
work 
consists 
in 
the 
creation 
of 
those 
frequently 
very 
witty, 
but 
often 
exaggerated, 
digressions. 
These 
vary 
from 
the 
common 
presentation 
in 
the 
dream 
content 
to 
dream 
thoughts 
which 
are 
as 
varied 
as 
are 
the 
causes 
in 
form 
and 
essence 
which 
give 
rise 
to 
them. 
In 
the 
analysis 
of 
our 
example 



of 
a 
dream, 
I 
find 
a 
like 
case 
of 
the 
transformation 
of 
a 
thought 
in 
order 
that 
it 
might 
agree 
with 
another 
essentially 
foreign 
one. 
In 
following 
out 
the 
analysis 
I 
struck 
upon 
the 
thought: 
I 
should 
like 
to 
have 
something 
for 
nothing. 
But 
this 
formula 
is 
not 
serviceable 
to 
the 
dream. 
Hence 
it 
is 
replaced 
by 
another 
one: 
"I 
should 
like 
to 
enjoy 
something 
free 
of 
cost."[1] 
The 
word 
"kost" 
(taste), 
with 
its 
double 
meaning, 
is 
appropriate 
to 
a 
table 
d'hôte; 
it, 
moreover, 
is 
in 
place 
through 
the 
special 
sense 
in 
the 
dream. 
At 
home 
if 
there 
is 
a 
dish 
which 
the 
children 
decline, 
their 
mother 
first 
tries 
gentle 
persuasion, 
with 
a 
"Just 
taste 
it." 
That 
the 
dream 
work 
should 
unhesitatingly 
use 
the 
double 
meaning 
of 
the 
word 
is 
certainly 
remarkable; 
ample 
experience 
has 
shown, 
however, 
that 
the 
occurrence 
is 
quite 
usual. 


Through 
condensation 
of 
the 
dream 
certain 
constituent 
parts 
of 
its 
content 
are 
explicable 
which 
are 
peculiar 
to 
the 
dream 
life 
alone, 
and 
which 
are 
not 
found 
in 
the 
waking 
state. 
Such 
are 
the 
composite 
and 
mixed 
persons, 
the 
extraordinary 
mixed 
figures, 
creations 
comparable 
with 
the 
fantastic 
animal 
compositions 
of 
Orientals; 
a 
moment's 
thought 
and 
these 
are 
reduced 
to 
unity, 
whilst 
the 
fancies 
of 
the 
dream 
are 
ever 
formed 
anew 
in 
an 
inexhaustible 
profusion. 
Every 
one 
knows 
such 
images 
in 
his 
own 
dreams; 
manifold 
are 
their 
origins. 
I 
can 
build 
up 
a 
person 
by 
borrowing 
one 
feature 
from 
one 
person 
and 
one 
from 
another, 
or 
by 
giving 
to 
the 
form 
of 
one 
the 
name 
of 
another 
in 
my 
dream. 
I 
can 
also 
visualize 
one 
person, 
but 
place 
him 
in 
a 
position 
which 
has 
occurred 
to 
another. 
There 
is 
a 
meaning 
in 
all 
these 
cases 
when 
different 
persons 
are 
amalgamated 
into 
one 
substitute. 
Such 
cases 
denote 
an 
"and," 
a 
"just 
like," 
a 
comparison 
of 
the 
original 
person 
from 
a 
certain 
point 
of 
view, 
a 
comparison 
which 
can 
be 
also 
realized 
in 
the 
dream 
itself. 
As 
a 
rule, 
however, 
the 
identity 
of 
the 
blended 
persons 
is 
only 
discoverable 
by 
analysis, 
and 
is 
only 
indicated 
in 
the 
dream 
content 
by 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
"combined" 
person. 


The 
same 
diversity 
in 
their 
ways 
of 
formation 
and 
the 
same 
rules 
for 
its 
solution 
hold 
good 
also 
for 
the 
innumerable 
medley 
of 
dream 
contents, 
examples 
of 
which 
I 
need 
scarcely 
adduce. 
Their 
strangeness 
quite 
disappears 
when 
we 
resolve 
not 
to 
place 
them 
on 
a 
level 
with 
the 
objects 
of 
perception 
as 
known 
to 
us 
when 
awake, 
but 
to 
remember 
that 
they 
represent 
the 
art 
of 
dream 
condensation 
by 
an 
exclusion 
of 
unnecessary 
detail. 
Prominence 
is 
given 
to 
the 
common 
character 
of 
the 
combination. 
Analysis 
must 
also 
generally 
supply 
the 
common 
features. 
The 
dream 
says 
simply: 
_All 
these 



things 
have 
an 
"x" 
in 
common_. 
The 
decomposition 
of 
these 
mixed 
images 
by 
analysis 
is 
often 
the 
quickest 
way 
to 
an 
interpretation 
of 
the 
dream. 
Thus 
I 
once 
dreamt 
that 
I 
was 
sitting 
with 
one 
of 
my 
former 
university 
tutors 
on 
a 
bench, 
which 
was 
undergoing 
a 
rapid 
continuous 
movement 
amidst 
other 
benches. 
This 
was 
a 
combination 
of 
lecture-room 
and 
moving 
staircase. 
I 
will 
not 
pursue 
the 
further 
result 
of 
the 
thought. 
Another 
time 
I 
was 
sitting 
in 
a 
carriage, 
and 
on 
my 
lap 
an 
object 
in 
shape 
like 
a 
top-hat, 
which, 
however, 
was 
made 
of 
transparent 
glass. 
The 
scene 
at 
once 
brought 
to 
my 
mind 
the 
proverb: 
"He 
who 
keeps 
his 
hat 
in 
his 
hand 
will 
travel 
safely 
through 
the 
land." 
By 
a 
slight 
turn 
the 
glass 
hat 
reminded 
me 
of 
_Auer's 
light_, 
and 
I 
knew 
that 
I 
was 
about 
to 
invent 
something 
which 
was 
to 
make 
me 
as 
rich 
and 
independent 
as 
his 
invention 
had 
made 
my 
countryman, 
Dr. 
Auer, 
of 
Welsbach; 
then 
I 
should 
be 
able 
to 
travel 
instead 
of 
remaining 
in 
Vienna. 
In 
the 
dream 
I 
was 
traveling 
with 
my 
invention, 
with 
the, 
it 
is 
true, 
rather 
awkward 
glass 
top-hat. 
The 
dream 
work 
is 
peculiarly 
adept 
at 
representing 
two 
contradictory 
conceptions 
by 
means 
of 
the 
same 
mixed 
image. 
Thus, 
for 
instance, 
a 
woman 
dreamt 
of 
herself 
carrying 
a 
tall 
flower-stalk, 
as 
in 
the 
picture 
of 
the 
Annunciation 
(Chastity-Mary 
is 
her 
own 
name), 
but 
the 
stalk 
was 
bedecked 
with 
thick 
white 
blossoms 
resembling 
camellias 
(contrast 
with 
chastity: 
La 
dame 
aux 
Camelias). 


A 
great 
deal 
of 
what 
we 
have 
called 
"dream 
condensation" 
can 
be 
thus 
formulated. 
Each 
one 
of 
the 
elements 
of 
the 
dream 
content 
is 
overdetermined 
by 
the 
matter 
of 
the 
dream 
thoughts; 
it 
is 
not 
derived 
from 
one 
element 
of 
these 
thoughts, 
but 
from 
a 
whole 
series. 
These 
are 
not 
necessarily 
interconnected 
in 
any 
way, 
but 
may 
belong 
to 
the 
most 
diverse 
spheres 
of 
thought. 
The 
dream 
element 
truly 
represents 
all 
this 
disparate 
matter 
in 
the 
dream 
content. 
Analysis, 
moreover, 
discloses 
another 
side 
of 
the 
relationship 
between 
dream 
content 
and 
dream 
thoughts. 
Just 
as 
one 
element 
of 
the 
dream 
leads 
to 
associations 
with 
several 
dream 
thoughts, 
so, 
as 
a 
rule, 
the 
one 
dream 
thought 
represents 
more 
than 
one 
dream 
element. 
The 
threads 
of 
the 
association 
do 
not 
simply 
converge 
from 
the 
dream 
thoughts 
to 
the 
dream 
content, 
but 
on 
the 
way 
they 
overlap 
and 
interweave 
in 
every 
way. 


Next 
to 
the 
transformation 
of 
one 
thought 
in 
the 
scene 
(its 
"dramatization"), 
condensation 
is 
the 
most 
important 
and 
most 
characteristic 
feature 
of 
the 
dream 
work. 
We 
have 
as 
yet 
no 
clue 
as 
to 
the 
motive 
calling 
for 
such 
compression 
of 
the 
content. 



In 
the 
complicated 
and 
intricate 
dreams 
with 
which 
we 
are 
now 
concerned, 
condensation 
and 
dramatization 
do 
not 
wholly 
account 
for 
the 
difference 
between 
dream 
contents 
and 
dream 
thoughts. 
There 
is 
evidence 
of 
a 
third 
factor, 
which 
deserves 
careful 
consideration. 


When 
I 
have 
arrived 
at 
an 
understanding 
of 
the 
dream 
thoughts 
by 
my 
analysis 
I 
notice, 
above 
all, 
that 
the 
matter 
of 
the 
manifest 
is 
very 
different 
from 
that 
of 
the 
latent 
dream 
content. 
That 
is, 
I 
admit, 
only 
an 
apparent 
difference 
which 
vanishes 
on 
closer 
investigation, 
for 
in 
the 
end 
I 
find 
the 
whole 
dream 
content 
carried 
out 
in 
the 
dream 
thoughts, 
nearly 
all 
the 
dream 
thoughts 
again 
represented 
in 
the 
dream 
content. 
Nevertheless, 
there 
does 
remain 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
difference. 


The 
essential 
content 
which 
stood 
out 
clearly 
and 
broadly 
in 
the 
dream 
must, 
after 
analysis, 
rest 
satisfied 
with 
a 
very 
subordinate 
rôle 
among 
the 
dream 
thoughts. 
These 
very 
dream 
thoughts 
which, 
going 
by 
my 
feelings, 
have 
a 
claim 
to 
the 
greatest 
importance 
are 
either 
not 
present 
at 
all 
in 
the 
dream 
content, 
or 
are 
represented 
by 
some 
remote 
allusion 
in 
some 
obscure 
region 
of 
the 
dream. 
I 
can 
thus 
describe 
these 
phenomena: 
_During 
the 
dream 
work 
the 
psychical 
intensity 
of 
those 
thoughts 
and 
conceptions 
to 
which 
it 
properly 
pertains 
flows 
to 
others 
which, 
in 
my 
judgment, 
have 
no 
claim 
to 
such 
emphasis_. 
There 
is 
no 
other 
process 
which 
contributes 
so 
much 
to 
concealment 
of 
the 
dream's 
meaning 
and 
to 
make 
the 
connection 
between 
the 
dream 
content 
and 
dream 
ideas 
irrecognizable. 
During 
this 
process, 
which 
I 
will 
call 
the 
dream 
displacement, 
I 
notice 
also 
the 
psychical 
intensity, 
significance, 
or 
emotional 
nature 
of 
the 
thoughts 
become 
transposed 
in 
sensory 
vividness. 
What 
was 
clearest 
in 
the 
dream 
seems 
to 
me, 
without 
further 
consideration, 
the 
most 
important; 
but 
often 
in 
some 
obscure 
element 
of 
the 
dream 
I 
can 
recognize 
the 
most 
direct 
offspring 
of 
the 
principal 
dream 
thought. 


I 
could 
only 
designate 
this 
dream 
displacement 
as 
the 
transvaluation 
of 
psychical 
values. 
The 
phenomena 
will 
not 
have 
been 
considered 
in 
all 
its 
bearings 
unless 
I 
add 
that 
this 
displacement 
or 
transvaluation 
is 
shared 
by 
different 
dreams 
in 
extremely 
varying 
degrees. 
There 
are 
dreams 
which 
take 
place 
almost 
without 
any 
displacement. 
These 
have 
the 
same 
time, 
meaning, 
and 
intelligibility 
as 
we 
found 
in 
the 
dreams 
which 
recorded 
a 
desire. 
In 
other 



dreams 
not 
a 
bit 
of 
the 
dream 
idea 
has 
retained 
its 
own 
psychical 
value, 
or 
everything 
essential 
in 
these 
dream 
ideas 
has 
been 
replaced 
by 
unessentials, 
whilst 
every 
kind 
of 
transition 
between 
these 
conditions 
can 
be 
found. 
The 
more 
obscure 
and 
intricate 
a 
dream 
is, 
the 
greater 
is 
the 
part 
to 
be 
ascribed 
to 
the 
impetus 
of 
displacement 
in 
its 
formation. 


The 
example 
that 
we 
chose 
for 
analysis 
shows, 
at 
least, 
this 
much 
of 
displacement--that 
its 
content 
has 
a 
different 
center 
of 
interest 
from 
that 
of 
the 
dream 
ideas. 
In 
the 
forefront 
of 
the 
dream 
content 
the 
main 
scene 
appears 
as 
if 
a 
woman 
wished 
to 
make 
advances 
to 
me; 
in 
the 
dream 
idea 
the 
chief 
interest 
rests 
on 
the 
desire 
to 
enjoy 
disinterested 
love 
which 
shall 
"cost 
nothing"; 
this 
idea 
lies 
at 
the 
back 
of 
the 
talk 
about 
the 
beautiful 
eyes 
and 
the 
far-fetched 
allusion 
to 
"spinach." 


If 
we 
abolish 
the 
dream 
displacement, 
we 
attain 
through 
analysis 
quite 
certain 
conclusions 
regarding 
two 
problems 
of 
the 
dream 
which 
are 
most 
disputed-as 
to 
what 
provokes 
a 
dream 
at 
all, 
and 
as 
to 
the 
connection 
of 
the 
dream 
with 
our 
waking 
life. 
There 
are 
dreams 
which 
at 
once 
expose 
their 
links 
with 
the 
events 
of 
the 
day; 
in 
others 
no 
trace 
of 
such 
a 
connection 
can 
be 
found. 
By 
the 
aid 
of 
analysis 
it 
can 
be 
shown 
that 
every 
dream, 
without 
any 
exception, 
is 
linked 
up 
with 
our 
impression 
of 
the 
day, 
or 
perhaps 
it 
would 
be 
more 
correct 
to 
say 
of 
the 
day 
previous 
to 
the 
dream. 
The 
impressions 
which 
have 
incited 
the 
dream 
may 
be 
so 
important 
that 
we 
are 
not 
surprised 
at 
our 
being 
occupied 
with 
them 
whilst 
awake; 
in 
this 
case 
we 
are 
right 
in 
saying 
that 
the 
dream 
carries 
on 
the 
chief 
interest 
of 
our 
waking 
life. 
More 
usually, 
however, 
when 
the 
dream 
contains 
anything 
relating 
to 
the 
impressions 
of 
the 
day, 
it 
is 
so 
trivial, 
unimportant, 
and 
so 
deserving 
of 
oblivion, 
that 
we 
can 
only 
recall 
it 
with 
an 
effort. 
The 
dream 
content 
appears, 
then, 
even 
when 
coherent 
and 
intelligible, 
to 
be 
concerned 
with 
those 
indifferent 
trifles 
of 
thought 
undeserving 
of 
our 
waking 
interest. 
The 
depreciation 
of 
dreams 
is 
largely 
due 
to 
the 
predominance 
of 
the 
indifferent 
and 
the 
worthless 
in 
their 
content. 


Analysis 
destroys 
the 
appearance 
upon 
which 
this 
derogatory 
judgment 
is 
based. 
When 
the 
dream 
content 
discloses 
nothing 
but 
some 
indifferent 
impression 
as 
instigating 
the 
dream, 
analysis 
ever 
indicates 
some 
significant 
event, 
which 
has 
been 
replaced 
by 
something 
indifferent 
with 
which 
it 
has 
entered 
into 
abundant 
associations. 
Where 
the 
dream 
is 
concerned 
with 
uninteresting 
and 
unimportant 
conceptions, 
analysis 
reveals 
the 
numerous 



associative 
paths 
which 
connect 
the 
trivial 
with 
the 
momentous 
in 
the 
psychical 
estimation 
of 
the 
individual. 
_It 
is 
only 
the 
action 
of 
displacement 
if 
what 
is 
indifferent 
obtains 
recognition 
in 
the 
dream 
content 
instead 
of 
those 
impressions 
which 
are 
really 
the 
stimulus, 
or 
instead 
of 
the 
things 
of 
real 
interest_. 
In 
answering 
the 
question 
as 
to 
what 
provokes 
the 
dream, 
as 
to 
the 
connection 
of 
the 
dream, 
in 
the 
daily 
troubles, 
we 
must 
say, 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
insight 
given 
us 
by 
replacing 
the 
manifest 
latent 
dream 
content: 
_The 
dream 
does 
never 
trouble 
itself 
about 
things 
which 
are 
not 
deserving 
of 
our 
concern 
during 
the 
day, 
and 
trivialities 
which 
do 
not 
trouble 
us 
during 
the 
day 
have 
no 
power 
to 
pursue 
us 
whilst 
asleep_. 


What 
provoked 
the 
dream 
in 
the 
example 
which 
we 
have 
analyzed? 
The 
really 
unimportant 
event, 
that 
a 
friend 
invited 
me 
to 
a 
free 
ride 
in 
his 
cab. 
The 
table 
d'hôte 
scene 
in 
the 
dream 
contains 
an 
allusion 
to 
this 
indifferent 
motive, 
for 
in 
conversation 
I 
had 
brought 
the 
taxi 
parallel 
with 
the 
table 
d'hôte. 
But 
I 
can 
indicate 
the 
important 
event 
which 
has 
as 
its 
substitute 
the 
trivial 
one. 
A 
few 
days 
before 
I 
had 
disbursed 
a 
large 
sum 
of 
money 
for 
a 
member 
of 
my 
family 
who 
is 
very 
dear 
to 
me. 
Small 
wonder, 
says 
the 
dream 
thought, 
if 
this 
person 
is 
grateful 
to 
me 
for 
this--this 
love 
is 
not 
cost-free. 
But 
love 
that 
shall 
cost 
nothing 
is 
one 
of 
the 
prime 
thoughts 
of 
the 
dream. 
The 
fact 
that 
shortly 
before 
this 
I 
had 
had 
several 
drives 
with 
the 
relative 
in 
question 
puts 
the 
one 
drive 
with 
my 
friend 
in 
a 
position 
to 
recall 
the 
connection 
with 
the 
other 
person. 
The 
indifferent 
impression 
which, 
by 
such 
ramifications, 
provokes 
the 
dream 
is 
subservient 
to 
another 
condition 
which 
is 
not 
true 
of 
the 
real 
source 
of 
the 
dream--the 
impression 
must 
be 
a 
recent 
one, 
everything 
arising 
from 
the 
day 
of 
the 
dream. 


I 
cannot 
leave 
the 
question 
of 
dream 
displacement 
without 
the 
consideration 
of 
a 
remarkable 
process 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
dreams 
in 
which 
condensation 
and 
displacement 
work 
together 
towards 
one 
end. 
In 
condensation 
we 
have 
already 
considered 
the 
case 
where 
two 
conceptions 
in 
the 
dream 
having 
something 
in 
common, 
some 
point 
of 
contact, 
are 
replaced 
in 
the 
dream 
content 
by 
a 
mixed 
image, 
where 
the 
distinct 
germ 
corresponds 
to 
what 
is 
common, 
and 
the 
indistinct 
secondary 
modifications 
to 
what 
is 
distinctive. 
If 
displacement 
is 
added 
to 
condensation, 
there 
is 
no 
formation 
of 
a 
mixed 
image, 
but 
a 
common 
mean 
which 
bears 
the 
same 
relationship 
to 
the 
individual 
elements 
as 
does 
the 
resultant 
in 
the 
parallelogram 
of 
forces 
to 
its 
components. 
In 
one 
of 
my 
dreams, 
for 
instance, 
there 
is 
talk 
of 
an 
injection 



with 
propyl. 
On 
first 
analysis 
I 
discovered 
an 
indifferent 
but 
true 
incident 
where 
amyl 
played 
a 
part 
as 
the 
excitant 
of 
the 
dream. 
I 
cannot 
yet 
vindicate 
the 
exchange 
of 
amyl 
for 
propyl. 
To 
the 
round 
of 
ideas 
of 
the 
same 
dream, 
however, 
there 
belongs 
the 
recollection 
of 
my 
first 
visit 
to 
Munich, 
when 
the 
Propyloea 
struck 
me. 
The 
attendant 
circumstances 
of 
the 
analysis 
render 
it 
admissible 
that 
the 
influence 
of 
this 
second 
group 
of 
conceptions 
caused 
the 
displacement 
of 
amyl 
to 
propyl. 
Propyl 
is, 
so 
to 
say, 
the 
mean 
idea 
between 
amyl 
and 
_propyloea_; 
it 
got 
into 
the 
dream 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
compromise 
by 
simultaneous 
condensation 
and 
displacement. 


The 
need 
of 
discovering 
some 
motive 
for 
this 
bewildering 
work 
of 
the 
dream 
is 
even 
more 
called 
for 
in 
the 
case 
of 
displacement 
than 
in 
condensation. 


Although 
the 
work 
of 
displacement 
must 
be 
held 
mainly 
responsible 
if 
the 
dream 
thoughts 
are 
not 
refound 
or 
recognized 
in 
the 
dream 
content 
(unless 
the 
motive 
of 
the 
changes 
be 
guessed), 
it 
is 
another 
and 
milder 
kind 
of 
transformation 
which 
will 
be 
considered 
with 
the 
dream 
thoughts 
which 
leads 
to 
the 
discovery 
of 
a 
new 
but 
readily 
understood 
act 
of 
the 
dream 
work. 
The 
first 
dream 
thoughts 
which 
are 
unravelled 
by 
analysis 
frequently 
strike 
one 
by 
their 
unusual 
wording. 
They 
do 
not 
appear 
to 
be 
expressed 
in 
the 
sober 
form 
which 
our 
thinking 
prefers; 
rather 
are 
they 
expressed 
symbolically 
by 
allegories 
and 
metaphors 
like 
the 
figurative 
language 
of 
the 
poets. 
It 
is 
not 
difficult 
to 
find 
the 
motives 
for 
this 
degree 
of 
constraint 
in 
the 
expression 
of 
dream 
ideas. 
The 
dream 
content 
consists 
chiefly 
of 
visual 
scenes; 
hence 
the 
dream 
ideas 
must, 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
be 
prepared 
to 
make 
use 
of 
these 
forms 
of 
presentation. 
Conceive 
that 
a 
political 
leader's 
or 
a 
barrister's 
address 
had 
to 
be 
transposed 
into 
pantomime, 
and 
it 
will 
be 
easy 
to 
understand 
the 
transformations 
to 
which 
the 
dream 
work 
is 
constrained 
by 
regard 
for 
this 
dramatization 
of 
the 
dream 
content. 


Around 
the 
psychical 
stuff 
of 
dream 
thoughts 
there 
are 
ever 
found 
reminiscences 
of 
impressions, 
not 
infrequently 
of 
early 
childhood--scenes 
which, 
as 
a 
rule, 
have 
been 
visually 
grasped. 
Whenever 
possible, 
this 
portion 
of 
the 
dream 
ideas 
exercises 
a 
definite 
influence 
upon 
the 
modelling 
of 
the 
dream 
content; 
it 
works 
like 
a 
center 
of 
crystallization, 
by 
attracting 
and 
rearranging 
the 
stuff 
of 
the 
dream 
thoughts. 
The 
scene 
of 
the 
dream 
is 
not 
infrequently 
nothing 
but 
a 
modified 
repetition, 
complicated 
by 
interpolations 
of 
events 
that 
have 
left 
such 
an 
impression; 
the 
dream 
but 
very 
seldom 



reproduces 
accurate 
and 
unmixed 
reproductions 
of 
real 
scenes. 


The 
dream 
content 
does 
not, 
however, 
consist 
exclusively 
of 
scenes, 
but 
it 
also 
includes 
scattered 
fragments 
of 
visual 
images, 
conversations, 
and 
even 
bits 
of 
unchanged 
thoughts. 
It 
will 
be 
perhaps 
to 
the 
point 
if 
we 
instance 
in 
the 
briefest 
way 
the 
means 
of 
dramatization 
which 
are 
at 
the 
disposal 
of 
the 
dream 
work 
for 
the 
repetition 
of 
the 
dream 
thoughts 
in 
the 
peculiar 
language 
of 
the 
dream. 


The 
dream 
thoughts 
which 
we 
learn 
from 
the 
analysis 
exhibit 
themselves 
as 
a 
psychical 
complex 
of 
the 
most 
complicated 
superstructure. 
Their 
parts 
stand 
in 
the 
most 
diverse 
relationship 
to 
each 
other; 
they 
form 
backgrounds 
and 
foregrounds, 
stipulations, 
digressions, 
illustrations, 
demonstrations, 
and 
protestations. 
It 
may 
be 
said 
to 
be 
almost 
the 
rule 
that 
one 
train 
of 
thought 
is 
followed 
by 
its 
contradictory. 
No 
feature 
known 
to 
our 
reason 
whilst 
awake 
is 
absent. 
If 
a 
dream 
is 
to 
grow 
out 
of 
all 
this, 
the 
psychical 
matter 
is 
submitted 
to 
a 
pressure 
which 
condenses 
it 
extremely, 
to 
an 
inner 
shrinking 
and 
displacement, 
creating 
at 
the 
same 
time 
fresh 
surfaces, 
to 
a 
selective 
interweaving 
among 
the 
constituents 
best 
adapted 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
these 
scenes. 
Having 
regard 
to 
the 
origin 
of 
this 
stuff, 
the 
term 
regression 
can 
be 
fairly 
applied 
to 
this 
process. 
The 
logical 
chains 
which 
hitherto 
held 
the 
psychical 
stuff 
together 
become 
lost 
in 
this 
transformation 
to 
the 
dream 
content. 
The 
dream 
work 
takes 
on, 
as 
it 
were, 
only 
the 
essential 
content 
of 
the 
dream 
thoughts 
for 
elaboration. 
It 
is 
left 
to 
analysis 
to 
restore 
the 
connection 
which 
the 
dream 
work 
has 
destroyed. 


The 
dream's 
means 
of 
expression 
must 
therefore 
be 
regarded 
as 
meager 
in 
comparison 
with 
those 
of 
our 
imagination, 
though 
the 
dream 
does 
not 
renounce 
all 
claims 
to 
the 
restitution 
of 
logical 
relation 
to 
the 
dream 
thoughts. 
It 
rather 
succeeds 
with 
tolerable 
frequency 
in 
replacing 
these 
by 
formal 
characters 
of 
its 
own. 


By 
reason 
of 
the 
undoubted 
connection 
existing 
between 
all 
the 
parts 
of 
dream 
thoughts, 
the 
dream 
is 
able 
to 
embody 
this 
matter 
into 
a 
single 
scene. 
It 
upholds 
a 
logical 
connection 
as 
approximation 
in 
time 
and 
space, 
just 
as 
the 
painter, 
who 
groups 
all 
the 
poets 
for 
his 
picture 
of 
Parnassus 
who, 
though 
they 
have 
never 
been 
all 
together 
on 
a 
mountain 
peak, 
yet 
form 
ideally 
a 
community. 
The 
dream 
continues 
this 
method 
of 
presentation 
in 
individual 



dreams, 
and 
often 
when 
it 
displays 
two 
elements 
close 
together 
in 
the 
dream 
content 
it 
warrants 
some 
special 
inner 
connection 
between 
what 
they 
represent 
in 
the 
dream 
thoughts. 
It 
should 
be, 
moreover, 
observed 
that 
all 
the 
dreams 
of 
one 
night 
prove 
on 
analysis 
to 
originate 
from 
the 
same 
sphere 
of 
thought. 


The 
causal 
connection 
between 
two 
ideas 
is 
either 
left 
without 
presentation, 
or 
replaced 
by 
two 
different 
long 
portions 
of 
dreams 
one 
after 
the 
other. 
This 
presentation 
is 
frequently 
a 
reversed 
one, 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
dream 
being 
the 
deduction, 
and 
its 
end 
the 
hypothesis. 
The 
direct 
transformation 
of 
one 
thing 
into 
another 
in 
the 
dream 
seems 
to 
serve 
the 
relationship 
of 
cause 
and 
effect. 


The 
dream 
never 
utters 
the 
_alternative 
"either-or,"_ 
but 
accepts 
both 
as 
having 
equal 
rights 
in 
the 
same 
connection. 
When 
"either-or" 
is 
used 
in 
the 
reproduction 
of 
dreams, 
it 
is, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
mentioned, 
to 
be 
replaced 
by 
"and." 


Conceptions 
which 
stand 
in 
opposition 
to 
one 
another 
are 
preferably 
expressed 
in 
dreams 
by 
the 
same 
element.[2] 
There 
seems 
no 
"not" 
in 
dreams. 
Opposition 
between 
two 
ideas, 
the 
relation 
of 
conversion, 
is 
represented 
in 
dreams 
in 
a 
very 
remarkable 
way. 
It 
is 
expressed 
by 
the 
reversal 
of 
another 
part 
of 
the 
dream 
content 
just 
as 
if 
by 
way 
of 
appendix. 
We 
shall 
later 
on 
deal 
with 
another 
form 
of 
expressing 
disagreement. 
The 
common 
dream 
sensation 
of 
movement 
checked 
serves 
the 
purpose 
of 
representing 
disagreement 
of 
impulses--a 
conflict 
of 
the 
will. 


Only 
one 
of 
the 
logical 
relationships--that 
of 
_similarity, 
identity, 
agreement_--is 
found 
highly 
developed 
in 
the 
mechanism 
of 
dream 
formation. 
Dream 
work 
makes 
use 
of 
these 
cases 
as 
a 
starting-point 
for 
condensation, 
drawing 
together 
everything 
which 
shows 
such 
agreement 
to 
a 
fresh 
unity. 


These 
short, 
crude 
observations 
naturally 
do 
not 
suffice 
as 
an 
estimate 
of 
the 
abundance 
of 
the 
dream's 
formal 
means 
of 
presenting 
the 
logical 
relationships 
of 
the 
dream 
thoughts. 
In 
this 
respect, 
individual 
dreams 
are 
worked 
up 
more 
nicely 
or 
more 
carelessly, 
our 
text 
will 
have 
been 
followed 
more 
or 
less 
closely, 
auxiliaries 
of 
the 
dream 
work 
will 
have 
been 
taken 
more 
or 
less 
into 
consideration. 
In 
the 
latter 
case 
they 
appear 
obscure, 
intricate, 
incoherent. 



When 
the 
dream 
appears 
openly 
absurd, 
when 
it 
contains 
an 
obvious 
paradox 
in 
its 
content, 
it 
is 
so 
of 
purpose. 
Through 
its 
apparent 
disregard 
of 
all 
logical 
claims, 
it 
expresses 
a 
part 
of 
the 
intellectual 
content 
of 
the 
dream 
ideas. 
Absurdity 
in 
the 
dream 
denotes 
_disagreement, 
scorn, 
disdain_ 
in 
the 
dream 
thoughts. 
As 
this 
explanation 
is 
in 
entire 
disagreement 
with 
the 
view 
that 
the 
dream 
owes 
its 
origin 
to 
dissociated, 
uncritical 
cerebral 
activity, 
I 
will 
emphasize 
my 
view 
by 
an 
example: 


_"One 
of 
my 
acquaintances, 
Mr. 
M----, 
has 
been 
attacked 
by 
no 
less 
a 
person 
than 
Goethe 
in 
an 
essay 
with, 
we 
all 
maintain, 
unwarrantable 
violence. 
Mr. 
M----has 
naturally 
been 
ruined 
by 
this 
attack. 
He 
complains 
very 
bitterly 
of 
this 
at 
a 
dinner-party, 
but 
his 
respect 
for 
Goethe 
has 
not 
diminished 
through 
this 
personal 
experience. 
I 
now 
attempt 
to 
clear 
up 
the 
chronological 
relations 
which 
strike 
me 
as 
improbable. 
Goethe 
died 
in 
1832. 
As 
his 
attack 
upon 
Mr. 
M----must, 
of 
course, 
have 
taken 
place 
before, 
Mr. 
M----must 
have 
been 
then 
a 
very 
young 
man. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
plausible 
that 
he 
was 
eighteen. 
I 
am 
not 
certain, 
however, 
what 
year 
we 
are 
actually 
in, 
and 
the 
whole 
calculation 
falls 
into 
obscurity. 
The 
attack 
was, 
moreover, 
contained 
in 
Goethe's 
well-
known 
essay 
on 
'Nature.'"_ 


The 
absurdity 
of 
the 
dream 
becomes 
the 
more 
glaring 
when 
I 
state 
that 
Mr. 
M----is 
a 
young 
business 
man 
without 
any 
poetical 
or 
literary 
interests. 
My 
analysis 
of 
the 
dream 
will 
show 
what 
method 
there 
is 
in 
this 
madness. 
The 
dream 
has 
derived 
its 
material 
from 
three 
sources: 


1. 
Mr. 
M----, 
to 
whom 
I 
was 
introduced 
at 
a 
dinner-party, 
begged 
me 
one 
day 
to 
examine 
his 
elder 
brother, 
who 
showed 
signs 
of 
mental 
trouble. 
In 
conversation 
with 
the 
patient, 
an 
unpleasant 
episode 
occurred. 
Without 
the 
slightest 
occasion 
he 
disclosed 
one 
of 
his 
brother's 
youthful 
escapades. 
I 
had 
asked 
the 
patient 
the 
year 
of 
his 
birth 
(year 
of 
death 
in 
dream), 
and 
led 
him 
to 
various 
calculations 
which 
might 
show 
up 
his 
want 
of 
memory. 
2. 
A 
medical 
journal 
which 
displayed 
my 
name 
among 
others 
on 
the 
cover 
had 
published 
a 
ruinous 
review 
of 
a 
book 
by 
my 
friend 
F----of 
Berlin, 
from 
the 
pen 
of 
a 
very 
juvenile 
reviewer. 
I 
communicated 
with 
the 
editor, 
who, 
indeed, 
expressed 
his 
regret, 
but 
would 
not 
promise 
any 
redress. 
Thereupon 
I 
broke 
off 
my 
connection 
with 
the 
paper; 
in 
my 
letter 
of 
resignation 
I 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
our 
personal 
relations 
would 
not 
suffer 
from 
this. 

Here 
is 
the 
real 
source 
of 
the 
dream. 
The 
derogatory 
reception 
of 
my 
friend's 
work 
had 
made 
a 
deep 
impression 
upon 
me. 
In 
my 
judgment, 
it 
contained 
a 
fundamental 
biological 
discovery 
which 
only 
now, 
several 
years 
later, 
commences 
to 
find 
favor 
among 
the 
professors. 


3. 
A 
little 
while 
before, 
a 
patient 
gave 
me 
the 
medical 
history 
of 
her 
brother, 
who, 
exclaiming 
"_Nature, 
Nature!_" 
had 
gone 
out 
of 
his 
mind. 
The 
doctors 
considered 
that 
the 
exclamation 
arose 
from 
a 
study 
of 
_Goethe's_ 
beautiful 
essay, 
and 
indicated 
that 
the 
patient 
had 
been 
overworking. 
I 
expressed 
the 
opinion 
that 
it 
seemed 
more 
plausible 
to 
me 
that 
the 
exclamation 
"Nature!" 
was 
to 
be 
taken 
in 
that 
sexual 
meaning 
known 
also 
to 
the 
less 
educated 
in 
our 
country. 
It 
seemed 
to 
me 
that 
this 
view 
had 
something 
in 
it, 
because 
the 
unfortunate 
youth 
afterwards 
mutilated 
his 
genital 
organs. 
The 
patient 
was 
eighteen 
years 
old 
when 
the 
attack 
occurred. 
The 
first 
person 
in 
the 
dream-thoughts 
behind 
the 
ego 
was 
my 
friend 
who 
had 
been 
so 
scandalously 
treated. 
_"I 
now 
attempted 
to 
clear 
up 
the 
chronological 
relation."_ 
My 
friend's 
book 
deals 
with 
the 
chronological 
relations 
of 
life, 
and, 
amongst 
other 
things, 
correlates 
_Goethe's_ 
duration 
of 
life 
with 
a 
number 
of 
days 
in 
many 
ways 
important 
to 
biology. 
The 
ego 
is, 
however, 
represented 
as 
a 
general 
paralytic 
(_"I 
am 
not 
certain 
what 
year 
we 
are 
actually 
in"_). 
The 
dream 
exhibits 
my 
friend 
as 
behaving 
like 
a 
general 
paralytic, 
and 
thus 
riots 
in 
absurdity. 
But 
the 
dream 
thoughts 
run 
ironically. 
"Of 
course 
he 
is 
a 
madman, 
a 
fool, 
and 
you 
are 
the 
genius 
who 
understands 
all 
about 
it. 
But 
shouldn't 
it 
be 
the 
_other 
way 
round_?" 
This 
inversion 
obviously 
took 
place 
in 
the 
dream 
when 
Goethe 
attacked 
the 
young 
man, 
which 
is 
absurd, 
whilst 
any 
one, 
however 
young, 
can 
to-day 
easily 
attack 
the 
great 
Goethe. 


I 
am 
prepared 
to 
maintain 
that 
no 
dream 
is 
inspired 
by 
other 
than 
egoistic 
emotions. 
The 
ego 
in 
the 
dream 
does 
not, 
indeed, 
represent 
only 
my 
friend, 
but 
stands 
for 
myself 
also. 
I 
identify 
myself 
with 
him 
because 
the 
fate 
of 
his 
discovery 
appears 
to 
me 
typical 
of 
the 
acceptance 
of 
my 
own. 
If 
I 
were 
to 
publish 
my 
own 
theory, 
which 
gives 
sexuality 
predominance 
in 
the 
ætiology 
of 
psychoneurotic 
disorders 
(see 
the 
allusion 
to 
the 
eighteen-year-old 
patient-_"
Nature, 
Nature!"_), 
the 
same 
criticism 
would 
be 
leveled 
at 
me, 
and 
it 
would 
even 
now 
meet 
with 
the 
same 
contempt. 



When 
I 
follow 
out 
the 
dream 
thoughts 
closely, 
I 
ever 
find 
only 
scorn 
and 
contempt 
as 
_correlated 
with 
the 
dream's 
absurdity_. 
It 
is 
well 
known 
that 
the 
discovery 
of 
a 
cracked 
sheep's 
skull 
on 
the 
Lido 
in 
Venice 
gave 
Goethe 
the 
hint 
for 
the 
so-called 
vertebral 
theory 
of 
the 
skull. 
My 
friend 
plumes 
himself 
on 
having 
as 
a 
student 
raised 
a 
hubbub 
for 
the 
resignation 
of 
an 
aged 
professor 
who 
had 
done 
good 
work 
(including 
some 
in 
this 
very 
subject 
of 
comparative 
anatomy), 
but 
who, 
on 
account 
of 
decrepitude, 
had 
become 
quite 
incapable 
of 
teaching. 
The 
agitation 
my 
friend 
inspired 
was 
so 
successful 
because 
in 
the 
German 
Universities 
an 
age 
limit 
is 
not 
demanded 
for 
academic 
work. 
_Age 
is 
no 
protection 
against 
folly._ 
In 
the 
hospital 
here 
I 
had 
for 
years 
the 
honor 
to 
serve 
under 
a 
chief 
who, 
long 
fossilized, 
was 
for 
decades 
notoriously 
feebleminded, 
and 
was 
yet 
permitted 
to 
continue 
in 
his 
responsible 
office. 
A 
trait, 
after 
the 
manner 
of 
the 
find 
in 
the 
Lido, 
forces 
itself 
upon 
me 
here. 
It 
was 
to 
this 
man 
that 
some 
youthful 
colleagues 
in 
the 
hospital 
adapted 
the 
then 
popular 
slang 
of 
that 
day: 
"No 
Goethe 
has 
written 
that," 
"No 
Schiller 
composed 
that," 
etc. 


We 
have 
not 
exhausted 
our 
valuation 
of 
the 
dream 
work. 
In 
addition 
to 
condensation, 
displacement, 
and 
definite 
arrangement 
of 
the 
psychical 
matter, 
we 
must 
ascribe 
to 
it 
yet 
another 
activity--one 
which 
is, 
indeed, 
not 
shared 
by 
every 
dream. 
I 
shall 
not 
treat 
this 
position 
of 
the 
dream 
work 
exhaustively; 
I 
will 
only 
point 
out 
that 
the 
readiest 
way 
to 
arrive 
at 
a 
conception 
of 
it 
is 
to 
take 
for 
granted, 
probably 
unfairly, 
that 
it 
only 
subsequently 
influences 
the 
dream 
content 
which 
has 
already 
been 
built 
up. 
Its 
mode 
of 
action 
thus 
consists 
in 
so 
coördinating 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
dream 
that 
these 
coalesce 
to 
a 
coherent 
whole, 
to 
a 
dream 
composition. 
The 
dream 
gets 
a 
kind 
of 
façade 
which, 
it 
is 
true, 
does 
not 
conceal 
the 
whole 
of 
its 
content. 
There 
is 
a 
sort 
of 
preliminary 
explanation 
to 
be 
strengthened 
by 
interpolations 
and 
slight 
alterations. 
Such 
elaboration 
of 
the 
dream 
content 
must 
not 
be 
too 
pronounced; 
the 
misconception 
of 
the 
dream 
thoughts 
to 
which 
it 
gives 
rise 
is 
merely 
superficial, 
and 
our 
first 
piece 
of 
work 
in 
analyzing 
a 
dream 
is 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
these 
early 
attempts 
at 
interpretation. 


The 
motives 
for 
this 
part 
of 
the 
dream 
work 
are 
easily 
gauged. 
This 
final 
elaboration 
of 
the 
dream 
is 
due 
to 
a 
_regard 
for 
intelligibility_--a 
fact 
at 
once 
betraying 
the 
origin 
of 
an 
action 
which 
behaves 
towards 
the 
actual 
dream 
content 
just 
as 
our 
normal 
psychical 
action 
behaves 
towards 
some 
proffered 
perception 
that 
is 
to 
our 
liking. 
The 
dream 
content 
is 
thus 
secured 
under 
the 



pretense 
of 
certain 
expectations, 
is 
perceptually 
classified 
by 
the 
supposition 
of 
its 
intelligibility, 
thereby 
risking 
its 
falsification, 
whilst, 
in 
fact, 
the 
most 
extraordinary 
misconceptions 
arise 
if 
the 
dream 
can 
be 
correlated 
with 
nothing 
familiar. 
Every 
one 
is 
aware 
that 
we 
are 
unable 
to 
look 
at 
any 
series 
of 
unfamiliar 
signs, 
or 
to 
listen 
to 
a 
discussion 
of 
unknown 
words, 
without 
at 
once 
making 
perpetual 
changes 
through 
our 
regard 
for 
intelligibility, 
through 
our 
falling 
back 
upon 
what 
is 
familiar. 


We 
can 
call 
those 
dreams 
properly 
made 
up 
which 
are 
the 
result 
of 
an 
elaboration 
in 
every 
way 
analogous 
to 
the 
psychical 
action 
of 
our 
waking 
life. 
In 
other 
dreams 
there 
is 
no 
such 
action; 
not 
even 
an 
attempt 
is 
made 
to 
bring 
about 
order 
and 
meaning. 
We 
regard 
the 
dream 
as 
"quite 
mad," 
because 
on 
awaking 
it 
is 
with 
this 
last-named 
part 
of 
the 
dream 
work, 
the 
dream 
elaboration, 
that 
we 
identify 
ourselves. 
So 
far, 
however, 
as 
our 
analysis 
is 
concerned, 
the 
dream, 
which 
resembles 
a 
medley 
of 
disconnected 
fragments, 
is 
of 
as 
much 
value 
as 
the 
one 
with 
a 
smooth 
and 
beautifully 
polished 
surface. 
In 
the 
former 
case 
we 
are 
spared, 
to 
some 
extent, 
the 
trouble 
of 
breaking 
down 
the 
super-elaboration 
of 
the 
dream 
content. 


All 
the 
same, 
it 
would 
be 
an 
error 
to 
see 
in 
the 
dream 
façade 
nothing 
but 
the 
misunderstood 
and 
somewhat 
arbitrary 
elaboration 
of 
the 
dream 
carried 
out 
at 
the 
instance 
of 
our 
psychical 
life. 
Wishes 
and 
phantasies 
are 
not 
infrequently 
employed 
in 
the 
erection 
of 
this 
façade, 
which 
were 
already 
fashioned 
in 
the 
dream 
thoughts; 
they 
are 
akin 
to 
those 
of 
our 
waking 
life--"day-dreams," 
as 
they 
are 
very 
properly 
called. 
These 
wishes 
and 
phantasies, 
which 
analysis 
discloses 
in 
our 
dreams 
at 
night, 
often 
present 
themselves 
as 
repetitions 
and 
refashionings 
of 
the 
scenes 
of 
infancy. 
Thus 
the 
dream 
façade 
may 
show 
us 
directly 
the 
true 
core 
of 
the 
dream, 
distorted 
through 
admixture 
with 
other 
matter. 


Beyond 
these 
four 
activities 
there 
is 
nothing 
else 
to 
be 
discovered 
in 
the 
dream 
work. 
If 
we 
keep 
closely 
to 
the 
definition 
that 
dream 
work 
denotes 
the 
transference 
of 
dream 
thoughts 
to 
dream 
content, 
we 
are 
compelled 
to 
say 
that 
the 
dream 
work 
is 
not 
creative; 
it 
develops 
no 
fancies 
of 
its 
own, 
it 
judges 
nothing, 
decides 
nothing. 
It 
does 
nothing 
but 
prepare 
the 
matter 
for 
condensation 
and 
displacement, 
and 
refashions 
it 
for 
dramatization, 
to 
which 
must 
be 
added 
the 
inconstant 
last-named 
mechanism--that 
of 
explanatory 
elaboration. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
a 
good 
deal 
is 
found 
in 
the 
dream 
content 
which 



might 
be 
understood 
as 
the 
result 
of 
another 
and 
more 
intellectual 
performance; 
but 
analysis 
shows 
conclusively 
every 
time 
that 
these 
_intellectual 
operations 
were 
already 
present 
in 
the 
dream 
thoughts, 
and 
have 
only 
been 
taken 
over 
by 
the 
dream 
content_. 
A 
syllogism 
in 
the 
dream 
is 
nothing 
other 
than 
the 
repetition 
of 
a 
syllogism 
in 
the 
dream 
thoughts; 
it 
seems 
inoffensive 
if 
it 
has 
been 
transferred 
to 
the 
dream 
without 
alteration; 
it 
becomes 
absurd 
if 
in 
the 
dream 
work 
it 
has 
been 
transferred 
to 
other 
matter. 
A 
calculation 
in 
the 
dream 
content 
simply 
means 
that 
there 
was 
a 
calculation 
in 
the 
dream 
thoughts; 
whilst 
this 
is 
always 
correct, 
the 
calculation 
in 
the 
dream 
can 
furnish 
the 
silliest 
results 
by 
the 
condensation 
of 
its 
factors 
and 
the 
displacement 
of 
the 
same 
operations 
to 
other 
things. 
Even 
speeches 
which 
are 
found 
in 
the 
dream 
content 
are 
not 
new 
compositions; 
they 
prove 
to 
be 
pieced 
together 
out 
of 
speeches 
which 
have 
been 
made 
or 
heard 
or 
read; 
the 
words 
are 
faithfully 
copied, 
but 
the 
occasion 
of 
their 
utterance 
is 
quite 
overlooked, 
and 
their 
meaning 
is 
most 
violently 
changed. 


It 
is, 
perhaps, 
not 
superfluous 
to 
support 
these 
assertions 
by 
examples: 


1. 
_A 
seemingly 
inoffensive, 
well-made 
dream 
of 
a 
patient. 
She 
was 
going 
to 
market 
with 
her 
cook, 
who 
carried 
the 
basket. 
The 
butcher 
said 
to 
her 
when 
she 
asked 
him 
for 
something: 
"That 
is 
all 
gone," 
and 
wished 
to 
give 
her 
something 
else, 
remarking; 
"That's 
very 
good." 
She 
declines, 
and 
goes 
to 
the 
greengrocer, 
who 
wants 
to 
sell 
her 
a 
peculiar 
vegetable 
which 
is 
bound 
up 
in 
bundles 
and 
of 
a 
black 
color. 
She 
says: 
"I 
don't 
know 
that; 
I 
won't 
take 
it."_ 
The 
remark 
"That 
is 
all 
gone" 
arose 
from 
the 
treatment. 
A 
few 
days 
before 
I 
said 
myself 
to 
the 
patient 
that 
the 
earliest 
reminiscences 
of 
childhood 
are 
all 
gone 
as 
such, 
but 
are 
replaced 
by 
transferences 
and 
dreams. 
Thus 
I 
am 
the 
butcher. 


The 
second 
remark, 
_"I 
don't 
know 
that"_ 
arose 
in 
a 
very 
different 
connection. 
The 
day 
before 
she 
had 
herself 
called 
out 
in 
rebuke 
to 
the 
cook 
(who, 
moreover, 
also 
appears 
in 
the 
dream): 
"_Behave 
yourself 
properly_; 
I 
don't 
know 
_that_"--that 
is, 
"I 
don't 
know 
this 
kind 
of 
behavior; 
I 
won't 
have 
it." 
The 
more 
harmless 
portion 
of 
this 
speech 
was 
arrived 
at 
by 
a 
displacement 
of 
the 
dream 
content; 
in 
the 
dream 
thoughts 
only 
the 
other 
portion 
of 
the 
speech 
played 
a 
part, 
because 
the 
dream 
work 
changed 
an 
imaginary 
situation 
into 
utter 
irrecognizability 
and 
complete 
inoffensiveness 



(while 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
I 
behave 
in 
an 
unseemly 
way 
to 
the 
lady). 
The 
situation 
resulting 
in 
this 
phantasy 
is, 
however, 
nothing 
but 
a 
new 
edition 
of 
one 
that 
actually 
took 
place. 


2. 
A 
dream 
apparently 
meaningless 
relates 
to 
figures. 
_"She 
wants 
to 
pay 
something; 
her 
daughter 
takes 
three 
florins 
sixty-five 
kreuzers 
out 
of 
her 
purse; 
but 
she 
says: 
'What 
are 
you 
doing? 
It 
only 
cost 
twenty-one 
kreuzers.'"_ 
The 
dreamer 
was 
a 
stranger 
who 
had 
placed 
her 
child 
at 
school 
in 
Vienna, 
and 
who 
was 
able 
to 
continue 
under 
my 
treatment 
so 
long 
as 
her 
daughter 
remained 
at 
Vienna. 
The 
day 
before 
the 
dream 
the 
directress 
of 
the 
school 
had 
recommended 
her 
to 
keep 
the 
child 
another 
year 
at 
school. 
In 
this 
case 
she 
would 
have 
been 
able 
to 
prolong 
her 
treatment 
by 
one 
year. 
The 
figures 
in 
the 
dream 
become 
important 
if 
it 
be 
remembered 
that 
time 
is 
money. 
One 
year 
equals 
365 
days, 
or, 
expressed 
in 
kreuzers, 
365 
kreuzers, 
which 
is 
three 
florins 
sixty-five 
kreuzers. 
The 
twenty-one 
kreuzers 
correspond 
with 
the 
three 
weeks 
which 
remained 
from 
the 
day 
of 
the 
dream 
to 
the 
end 
of 
the 
school 
term, 
and 
thus 
to 
the 
end 
of 
the 
treatment. 
It 
was 
obviously 
financial 
considerations 
which 
had 
moved 
the 
lady 
to 
refuse 
the 
proposal 
of 
the 
directress, 
and 
which 
were 
answerable 
for 
the 
triviality 
of 
the 
amount 
in 
the 
dream. 


3. 
A 
lady, 
young, 
but 
already 
ten 
years 
married, 
heard 
that 
a 
friend 
of 
hers, 
Miss 
Elise 
L----, 
of 
about 
the 
same 
age, 
had 
become 
engaged. 
This 
gave 
rise 
to 
the 
following 
dream: 
_She 
was 
sitting 
with 
her 
husband 
in 
the 
theater; 
the 
one 
side 
of 
the 
stalls 
was 
quite 
empty. 
Her 
husband 
tells 
her, 
Elise 
L----and 
her 
fiancé 
had 
intended 
coming, 
but 
could 
only 
get 
some 
cheap 
seats, 
three 
for 
one 
florin 
fifty 
kreuzers, 
and 
these 
they 
would 
not 
take. 
In 
her 
opinion, 
that 
would 
not 
have 
mattered 
very 
much._ 


The 
origin 
of 
the 
figures 
from 
the 
matter 
of 
the 
dream 
thoughts 
and 
the 
changes 
the 
figures 
underwent 
are 
of 
interest. 
Whence 
came 
the 
one 
florin 
fifty 
kreuzers? 
From 
a 
trifling 
occurrence 
of 
the 
previous 
day. 
Her 
sister-inlaw 
had 
received 
150 
florins 
as 
a 
present 
from 
her 
husband, 
and 
had 
quickly 
got 
rid 
of 
it 
by 
buying 
some 
ornament. 
Note 
that 
150 
florins 
is 
one 
hundred 
times 
one 
florin 
fifty 
kreuzers. 
For 
the 
three 
concerned 
with 
the 
tickets, 
the 
only 
link 
is 
that 
Elise 
L----is 
exactly 
three 
months 
younger 
than 
the 
dreamer. 



The 
scene 
in 
the 
dream 
is 
the 
repetition 
of 
a 
little 
adventure 
for 
which 
she 
has 
often 
been 
teased 
by 
her 
husband. 
She 
was 
once 
in 
a 
great 
hurry 
to 
get 
tickets 
in 
time 
for 
a 
piece, 
and 
when 
she 
came 
to 
the 
theater 
one 
side 
of 
the 
stalls 
was 
almost 
empty. 
It 
was 
therefore 
quite 
unnecessary 
for 
her 
to 
have 
been 
in 
such 
a 
hurry. 
Nor 
must 
we 
overlook 
the 
absurdity 
of 
the 
dream 
that 
two 
persons 
should 
take 
three 
tickets 
for 
the 
theater. 


Now 
for 
the 
dream 
ideas. 
It 
was 
stupid 
to 
have 
married 
so 
early; 
I 
need 
not 
have 
been 
in 
so 
great 
a 
hurry. 
Elise 
L----'s 
example 
shows 
me 
that 
I 
should 
have 
been 
able 
to 
get 
a 
husband 
later; 
indeed, 
one 
a 
hundred 
times 
better 
if 
I 
had 
but 
waited. 
I 
could 
have 
bought 
three 
such 
men 
with 
the 
money 
(dowry).

"Ich 
möchte 
gerne 
etwas 
geniessen 
ohne 
'Kosten' 
zu 
haben." 
A 
a 
pun 
upon 
the 
word 
"kosten," 
which 
has 
two 
meanings--"taste" 
and 
"cost." 
In 
"Die 
Traumdeutung," 
third 
edition, 
p. 
71 
footnote, 
Professor 
Freud 
remarks 
that 
"the 
finest 
example 
of 
dream 
interpretation 
left 
us 
by 
the 
ancients 
is 
based 
upon 
a 
pun" 
(from 
"The 
Interpretation 
of 
Dreams," 
by 
Artemidorus 
Daldianus). 
"Moreover, 
dreams 
are 
so 
intimately 
bound 
up 
with 
language 
that 
Ferenczi 
truly 
points 
out 
that 
every 
tongue 
has 
its 
own 
language 
of 
dreams. 
A 
dream 
is 
as 
a 
rule 
untranslatable 
into 
other 
languages."--TRANSLATOR.

It 
is 
worthy 
of 
remark 
that 
eminent 
philologists 
maintain 
that 
the 
oldest 
languages 
used 
the 
same 
word 
for 
expressing 
quite 
general 
antitheses. 
In 
C. 
Abel's 
essay, 
"Ueber 
den 
Gegensinn 
der 
Urworter" 
(1884,

following 
examples 
of 
such 
words 
in 
England 
are 
given: 
"gleam--gloom"; 
"to 
lock-loch"; 
"down--The 
Downs"; 
"to 
step--to 
stop." 
In 
his 
essay 
on 
"The 
Origin 
of 
Language" 
("Linguistic 
Essays,"

240), 
Abel 
says: 
"When 
the 
Englishman 
says 
'without,' 
is 
not 
his 
judgment 
based 
upon 
the 
comparative 
juxtaposition 
of 
two 
opposites, 
'with' 
and 
'out'; 
'with' 
itself 
originally 
meant 
'without,' 
as 
may 
still 
be 
seen 
in 
'withdraw.' 
'Bid' 
includes 
the 
opposite 
sense 
of 
giving 
and 
of 
proffering."

III 


WHY 
THE 
DREAM 
DISGUISES 
THE 
DESIRES 


In 
the 
foregoing 
exposition 
we 
have 
now 
learnt 
something 
of 
the 
dream 
work; 
we 
must 
regard 
it 
as 
a 
quite 
special 
psychical 
process, 
which, 
so 
far 
as 
we 
are 
aware, 
resembles 
nothing 
else. 
To 
the 
dream 
work 
has 
been 
transferred 
that 
bewilderment 
which 
its 
product, 
the 
dream, 
has 
aroused 
in 
us. 
In 
truth, 
the 
dream 
work 
is 
only 
the 
first 
recognition 
of 
a 
group 
of 
psychical 
processes 
to 
which 
must 
be 
referred 
the 
origin 
of 
hysterical 
symptoms, 
the 
ideas 
of 
morbid 
dread, 
obsession, 
and 
illusion. 
Condensation, 
and 
especially 
displacement, 
are 
never-failing 
features 
in 
these 
other 
processes. 
The 
regard 
for 
appearance 
remains, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
peculiar 
to 
the 
dream 
work. 
If 
this 
explanation 
brings 
the 
dream 
into 
line 
with 
the 
formation 
of 
psychical 
disease, 
it 
becomes 
the 
more 
important 
to 
fathom 
the 
essential 
conditions 
of 
processes 
like 
dream 
building. 
It 
will 
be 
probably 
a 
surprise 
to 
hear 
that 
neither 
the 
state 
of 
sleep 
nor 
illness 
is 
among 
the 
indispensable 
conditions. 
A 
whole 
number 
of 
phenomena 
of 
the 
everyday 
life 
of 
healthy 
persons, 
forgetfulness, 
slips 
in 
speaking 
and 
in 
holding 
things, 
together 
with 
a 
certain 
class 
of 
mistakes, 
are 
due 
to 
a 
psychical 
mechanism 
analogous 
to 
that 
of 
the 
dream 
and 
the 
other 
members 
of 
this 
group. 


Displacement 
is 
the 
core 
of 
the 
problem, 
and 
the 
most 
striking 
of 
all 
the 
dream 
performances. 
A 
thorough 
investigation 
of 
the 
subject 
shows 
that 
the 
essential 
condition 
of 
displacement 
is 
purely 
psychological; 
it 
is 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
motive. 
We 
get 
on 
the 
track 
by 
thrashing 
out 
experiences 
which 
one 
cannot 
avoid 
in 
the 
analysis 
of 
dreams. 
I 
had 
to 
break 
off 
the 
relations 
of 
my 
dream 
thoughts 
in 
the 
analysis 
of 
my 
dream 
on 
p. 
8 
because 
I 
found 
some 
experiences 
which 
I 
do 
not 
wish 
strangers 
to 
know, 
and 
which 
I 
could 
not 
relate 
without 
serious 
damage 
to 
important 
considerations. 
I 
added, 
it 
would 
be 
no 
use 
were 
I 
to 
select 
another 
instead 
of 
that 
particular 
dream; 
in 
every 
dream 
where 
the 
content 
is 
obscure 
or 
intricate, 
I 
should 
hit 
upon 
dream 
thoughts 
which 
call 
for 
secrecy. 
If, 
however, 
I 
continue 
the 
analysis 
for 
myself, 
without 
regard 
to 
those 
others, 
for 
whom, 
indeed, 
so 
personal 
an 
event 
as 
my 
dream 
cannot 
matter, 
I 
arrive 
finally 
at 
ideas 
which 
surprise 
me, 
which 
I 
have 
not 
known 
to 
be 
mine, 
which 
not 
only 
appear 
foreign 
to 
me, 
but 
which 
are 
unpleasant, 
and 
which 
I 
would 
like 
to 
oppose 
vehemently, 
whilst 
the 
chain 
of 
ideas 
running 
through 
the 
analysis 
intrudes 
upon 
me 
inexorably. 



I 
can 
only 
take 
these 
circumstances 
into 
account 
by 
admitting 
that 
these 
thoughts 
are 
actually 
part 
of 
my 
psychical 
life, 
possessing 
a 
certain 
psychical 
intensity 
or 
energy. 
However, 
by 
virtue 
of 
a 
particular 
psychological 
condition, 
the 
thoughts 
could 
not 
become 
conscious 
to 
me. 
I 
call 
this 
particular 
condition 
"Repression." 
It 
is 
therefore 
impossible 
for 
me 
not 
to 
recognize 
some 
casual 
relationship 
between 
the 
obscurity 
of 
the 
dream 
content 
and 
this 
state 
of 
repression--this 
incapacity 
of 
consciousness. 
Whence 
I 
conclude 
that 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
obscurity 
is 
the 
desire 
to 
conceal 
these 
thoughts. 
Thus 
I 
arrive 
at 
the 
conception 
of 
the 
dream 
distortion 
as 
the 
deed 
of 
the 
dream 
work, 
and 
of 
displacement 
serving 
to 
disguise 
this 
object. 


I 
will 
test 
this 
in 
my 
own 
dream, 
and 
ask 
myself, 
What 
is 
the 
thought 
which, 
quite 
innocuous 
in 
its 
distorted 
form, 
provokes 
my 
liveliest 
opposition 
in 
its 
real 
form? 
I 
remember 
that 
the 
free 
drive 
reminded 
me 
of 
the 
last 
expensive 
drive 
with 
a 
member 
of 
my 
family, 
the 
interpretation 
of 
the 
dream 
being: 
I 
should 
for 
once 
like 
to 
experience 
affection 
for 
which 
I 
should 
not 
have 
to 
pay, 
and 
that 
shortly 
before 
the 
dream 
I 
had 
to 
make 
a 
heavy 
disbursement 
for 
this 
very 
person. 
In 
this 
connection, 
I 
cannot 
get 
away 
from 
the 
thought 
that 
I 
regret 
this 
disbursement. 
It 
is 
only 
when 
I 
acknowledge 
this 
feeling 
that 
there 
is 
any 
sense 
in 
my 
wishing 
in 
the 
dream 
for 
an 
affection 
that 
should 
entail 
no 
outlay. 
And 
yet 
I 
can 
state 
on 
my 
honor 
that 
I 
did 
not 
hesitate 
for 
a 
moment 
when 
it 
became 
necessary 
to 
expend 
that 
sum. 
The 
regret, 
the 
counter-current, 
was 
unconscious 
to 
me. 
Why 
it 
was 
unconscious 
is 
quite 
another 
question 
which 
would 
lead 
us 
far 
away 
from 
the 
answer 
which, 
though 
within 
my 
knowledge, 
belongs 
elsewhere. 


If 
I 
subject 
the 
dream 
of 
another 
person 
instead 
of 
one 
of 
my 
own 
to 
analysis, 
the 
result 
is 
the 
same; 
the 
motives 
for 
convincing 
others 
is, 
however, 
changed. 
In 
the 
dream 
of 
a 
healthy 
person 
the 
only 
way 
for 
me 
to 
enable 
him 
to 
accept 
this 
repressed 
idea 
is 
the 
coherence 
of 
the 
dream 
thoughts. 
He 
is 
at 
liberty 
to 
reject 
this 
explanation. 
But 
if 
we 
are 
dealing 
with 
a 
person 
suffering 
from 
any 
neurosis--say 
from 
hysteria--the 
recognition 
of 
these 
repressed 
ideas 
is 
compulsory 
by 
reason 
of 
their 
connection 
with 
the 
symptoms 
of 
his 
illness 
and 
of 
the 
improvement 
resulting 
from 
exchanging 
the 
symptoms 
for 
the 
repressed 
ideas. 
Take 
the 
patient 
from 
whom 
I 
got 
the 
last 
dream 
about 
the 
three 
tickets 
for 
one 
florin 
fifty 
kreuzers. 
Analysis 
shows 
that 
she 
does 
not 
think 
highly 
of 
her 
husband, 
that 
she 
regrets 
having 
married 
him, 
that 
she 
would 
be 
glad 
to 
change 
him 
for 
some 
one 
else. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
she 
maintains 



that 
she 
loves 
her 
husband, 
that 
her 
emotional 
life 
knows 
nothing 
about 
this 
depreciation 
(a 
hundred 
times 
better!), 
but 
all 
her 
symptoms 
lead 
to 
the 
same 
conclusion 
as 
this 
dream. 
When 
her 
repressed 
memories 
had 
rewakened 
a 
certain 
period 
when 
she 
was 
conscious 
that 
she 
did 
not 
love 
her 
husband, 
her 
symptoms 
disappeared, 
and 
therewith 
disappeared 
her 
resistance 
to 
the 
interpretation 
of 
the 
dream. 


This 
conception 
of 
repression 
once 
fixed, 
together 
with 
the 
distortion 
of 
the 
dream 
in 
relation 
to 
repressed 
psychical 
matter, 
we 
are 
in 
a 
position 
to 
give 
a 
general 
exposition 
of 
the 
principal 
results 
which 
the 
analysis 
of 
dreams 
supplies. 
We 
learnt 
that 
the 
most 
intelligible 
and 
meaningful 
dreams 
are 
unrealized 
desires; 
the 
desires 
they 
pictured 
as 
realized 
are 
known 
to 
consciousness, 
have 
been 
held 
over 
from 
the 
daytime, 
and 
are 
of 
absorbing 
interest. 
The 
analysis 
of 
obscure 
and 
intricate 
dreams 
discloses 
something 
very 
similar; 
the 
dream 
scene 
again 
pictures 
as 
realized 
some 
desire 
which 
regularly 
proceeds 
from 
the 
dream 
ideas, 
but 
the 
picture 
is 
unrecognizable, 
and 
is 
only 
cleared 
up 
in 
the 
analysis. 
The 
desire 
itself 
is 
either 
one 
repressed, 
foreign 
to 
consciousness, 
or 
it 
is 
closely 
bound 
up 
with 
repressed 
ideas. 
The 
formula 
for 
these 
dreams 
may 
be 
thus 
stated: 
They 
are 
concealed 
realizations 
of 
repressed 
desires. 
It 
is 
interesting 
to 
note 
that 
they 
are 
right 
who 
regard 
the 
dream 
as 
foretelling 
the 
future. 
Although 
the 
future 
which 
the 
dream 
shows 
us 
is 
not 
that 
which 
will 
occur, 
but 
that 
which 
we 
would 
like 
to 
occur. 
Folk 
psychology 
proceeds 
here 
according 
to 
its 
wont; 
it 
believes 
what 
it 
wishes 
to 
believe. 


Dreams 
can 
be 
divided 
into 
three 
classes 
according 
to 
their 
relation 
towards 
the 
realization 
of 
desire. 
Firstly 
come 
those 
which 
exhibit 
a 
_non-repressed, 
non-concealed 
desire_; 
these 
are 
dreams 
of 
the 
infantile 
type, 
becoming 
ever 
rarer 
among 
adults. 
Secondly, 
dreams 
which 
express 
in 
veiled 
form 
some 
_repressed 
desire_; 
these 
constitute 
by 
far 
the 
larger 
number 
of 
our 
dreams, 
and 
they 
require 
analysis 
for 
their 
understanding. 
Thirdly, 
these 
dreams 
where 
repression 
exists, 
but 
without 
or 
with 
but 
slight 
concealment. 
These 
dreams 
are 
invariably 
accompanied 
by 
a 
feeling 
of 
dread 
which 
brings 
the 
dream 
to 
an 
end. 
This 
feeling 
of 
dread 
here 
replaces 
dream 
displacement; 
I 
regarded 
the 
dream 
work 
as 
having 
prevented 
this 
in 
the 
dream 
of 
the 
second 
class. 
It 
is 
not 
very 
difficult 
to 
prove 
that 
what 
is 
now 
present 
as 
intense 
dread 
in 
the 
dream 
was 
once 
desire, 
and 
is 
now 
secondary 
to 
the 
repression. 



There 
are 
also 
definite 
dreams 
with 
a 
painful 
content, 
without 
the 
presence 
of 
any 
anxiety 
in 
the 
dream. 
These 
cannot 
be 
reckoned 
among 
dreams 
of 
dread; 
they 
have, 
however, 
always 
been 
used 
to 
prove 
the 
unimportance 
and 
the 
psychical 
futility 
of 
dreams. 
An 
analysis 
of 
such 
an 
example 
will 
show 
that 
it 
belongs 
to 
our 
second 
class 
of 
dreams--a 
perfectly 
concealed 
realization 
of 
repressed 
desires. 
Analysis 
will 
demonstrate 
at 
the 
same 
time 
how 
excellently 
adapted 
is 
the 
work 
of 
displacement 
to 
the 
concealment 
of 
desires. 


A 
girl 
dreamt 
that 
she 
saw 
lying 
dead 
before 
her 
the 
only 
surviving 
child 
of 
her 
sister 
amid 
the 
same 
surroundings 
as 
a 
few 
years 
before 
she 
saw 
the 
first 
child 
lying 
dead. 
She 
was 
not 
sensible 
of 
any 
pain, 
but 
naturally 
combatted 
the 
view 
that 
the 
scene 
represented 
a 
desire 
of 
hers. 
Nor 
was 
that 
view 
necessary. 
Years 
ago 
it 
was 
at 
the 
funeral 
of 
the 
child 
that 
she 
had 
last 
seen 
and 
spoken 
to 
the 
man 
she 
loved. 
Were 
the 
second 
child 
to 
die, 
she 
would 
be 
sure 
to 
meet 
this 
man 
again 
in 
her 
sister's 
house. 
She 
is 
longing 
to 
meet 
him, 
but 
struggles 
against 
this 
feeling. 
The 
day 
of 
the 
dream 
she 
had 
taken 
a 
ticket 
for 
a 
lecture, 
which 
announced 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
man 
she 
always 
loved. 
The 
dream 
is 
simply 
a 
dream 
of 
impatience 
common 
to 
those 
which 
happen 
before 
a 
journey, 
theater, 
or 
simply 
anticipated 
pleasures. 
The 
longing 
is 
concealed 
by 
the 
shifting 
of 
the 
scene 
to 
the 
occasion 
when 
any 
joyous 
feeling 
were 
out 
of 
place, 
and 
yet 
where 
it 
did 
once 
exist. 
Note, 
further, 
that 
the 
emotional 
behavior 
in 
the 
dream 
is 
adapted, 
not 
to 
the 
displaced, 
but 
to 
the 
real 
but 
suppressed 
dream 
ideas. 
The 
scene 
anticipates 
the 
long-hoped-for 
meeting; 
there 
is 
here 
no 
call 
for 
painful 
emotions. 


There 
has 
hitherto 
been 
no 
occasion 
for 
philosophers 
to 
bestir 
themselves 
with 
a 
psychology 
of 
repression. 
We 
must 
be 
allowed 
to 
construct 
some 
clear 
conception 
as 
to 
the 
origin 
of 
dreams 
as 
the 
first 
steps 
in 
this 
unknown 
territory. 
The 
scheme 
which 
we 
have 
formulated 
not 
only 
from 
a 
study 
of 
dreams 
is, 
it 
is 
true, 
already 
somewhat 
complicated, 
but 
we 
cannot 
find 
any 
simpler 
one 
that 
will 
suffice. 
We 
hold 
that 
our 
psychical 
apparatus 
contains 
two 
procedures 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
thoughts. 
The 
second 
one 
has 
the 
advantage 
that 
its 
products 
find 
an 
open 
path 
to 
consciousness, 
whilst 
the 
activity 
of 
the 
first 
procedure 
is 
unknown 
to 
itself, 
and 
can 
only 
arrive 
at 
consciousness 
through 
the 
second 
one. 
At 
the 
borderland 
of 
these 
two 
procedures, 
where 
the 
first 
passes 
over 
into 
the 
second, 
a 
censorship 
is 
established 
which 
only 
passes 
what 
pleases 
it, 
keeping 
back 
everything 
else. 
That 
which 
is 
rejected 
by 
the 
censorship 
is, 
according 
to 
our 
definition, 
in 
a 



state 
of 
repression. 
Under 
certain 
conditions, 
one 
of 
which 
is 
the 
sleeping 
state, 
the 
balance 
of 
power 
between 
the 
two 
procedures 
is 
so 
changed 
that 
what 
is 
repressed 
can 
no 
longer 
be 
kept 
back. 
In 
the 
sleeping 
state 
this 
may 
possibly 
occur 
through 
the 
negligence 
of 
the 
censor; 
what 
has 
been 
hitherto 
repressed 
will 
now 
succeed 
in 
finding 
its 
way 
to 
consciousness. 
But 
as 
the 
censorship 
is 
never 
absent, 
but 
merely 
off 
guard, 
certain 
alterations 
must 
be 
conceded 
so 
as 
to 
placate 
it. 
It 
is 
a 
compromise 
which 
becomes 
conscious 
in 
this 
case--a 
compromise 
between 
what 
one 
procedure 
has 
in 
view 
and 
the 
demands 
of 
the 
other. 
_Repression, 
laxity 
of 
the 
censor, 
compromise_--this 
is 
the 
foundation 
for 
the 
origin 
of 
many 
another 
psychological 
process, 
just 
as 
it 
is 
for 
the 
dream. 
In 
such 
compromises 
we 
can 
observe 
the 
processes 
of 
condensation, 
of 
displacement, 
the 
acceptance 
of 
superficial 
associations, 
which 
we 
have 
found 
in 
the 
dream 
work. 


It 
is 
not 
for 
us 
to 
deny 
the 
demonic 
element 
which 
has 
played 
a 
part 
in 
constructing 
our 
explanation 
of 
dream 
work. 
The 
impression 
left 
is 
that 
the 
formation 
of 
obscure 
dreams 
proceeds 
as 
if 
a 
person 
had 
something 
to 
say 
which 
must 
be 
agreeable 
for 
another 
person 
upon 
whom 
he 
is 
dependent 
to 
hear. 
It 
is 
by 
the 
use 
of 
this 
image 
that 
we 
figure 
to 
ourselves 
the 
conception 
of 
the 
dream 
distortion 
and 
of 
the 
censorship, 
and 
ventured 
to 
crystallize 
our 
impression 
in 
a 
rather 
crude, 
but 
at 
least 
definite, 
psychological 
theory. 
Whatever 
explanation 
the 
future 
may 
offer 
of 
these 
first 
and 
second 
procedures, 
we 
shall 
expect 
a 
confirmation 
of 
our 
correlate 
that 
the 
second 
procedure 
commands 
the 
entrance 
to 
consciousness, 
and 
can 
exclude 
the 
first 
from 
consciousness. 


Once 
the 
sleeping 
state 
overcome, 
the 
censorship 
resumes 
complete 
sway, 
and 
is 
now 
able 
to 
revoke 
that 
which 
was 
granted 
in 
a 
moment 
of 
weakness. 
That 
the 
forgetting 
of 
dreams 
explains 
this 
in 
part, 
at 
least, 
we 
are 
convinced 
by 
our 
experience, 
confirmed 
again 
and 
again. 
During 
the 
relation 
of 
a 
dream, 
or 
during 
analysis 
of 
one, 
it 
not 
infrequently 
happens 
that 
some 
fragment 
of 
the 
dream 
is 
suddenly 
forgotten. 
This 
fragment 
so 
forgotten 
invariably 
contains 
the 
best 
and 
readiest 
approach 
to 
an 
understanding 
of 
the 
dream. 
Probably 
that 
is 
why 
it 
sinks 
into 
oblivion--_i.e._, 
into 
a 
renewed 
suppression. 


Viewing 
the 
dream 
content 
as 
the 
representation 
of 
a 
realized 
desire, 
and 
referring 
its 
vagueness 
to 
the 
changes 
made 
by 
the 
censor 
in 
the 
repressed 



matter, 
it 
is 
no 
longer 
difficult 
to 
grasp 
the 
function 
of 
dreams. 
In 
fundamental 
contrast 
with 
those 
saws 
which 
assume 
that 
sleep 
is 
disturbed 
by 
dreams, 
we 
hold 
the 
dream 
as 
the 
guardian 
of 
sleep. 
So 
far 
as 
children's 
dreams 
are 
concerned, 
our 
view 
should 
find 
ready 
acceptance. 


The 
sleeping 
state 
or 
the 
psychical 
change 
to 
sleep, 
whatsoever 
it 
be, 
is 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
child 
being 
sent 
to 
sleep 
or 
compelled 
thereto 
by 
fatigue, 
only 
assisted 
by 
the 
removal 
of 
all 
stimuli 
which 
might 
open 
other 
objects 
to 
the 
psychical 
apparatus. 
The 
means 
which 
serve 
to 
keep 
external 
stimuli 
distant 
are 
known; 
but 
what 
are 
the 
means 
we 
can 
employ 
to 
depress 
the 
internal 
psychical 
stimuli 
which 
frustrate 
sleep? 
Look 
at 
a 
mother 
getting 
her 
child 
to 
sleep. 
The 
child 
is 
full 
of 
beseeching; 
he 
wants 
another 
kiss; 
he 
wants 
to 
play 
yet 
awhile. 
His 
requirements 
are 
in 
part 
met, 
in 
part 
drastically 
put 
off 
till 
the 
following 
day. 
Clearly 
these 
desires 
and 
needs, 
which 
agitate 
him, 
are 
hindrances 
to 
sleep. 
Every 
one 
knows 
the 
charming 
story 
of 
the 
bad 
boy 
(Baldwin 
Groller's) 
who 
awoke 
at 
night 
bellowing 
out, 
"I 
want 
the 
rhinoceros." 
A 
really 
good 
boy, 
instead 
of 
bellowing, 
would 
have 
dreamt 
that 
he 
was 
playing 
with 
the 
rhinoceros. 
Because 
the 
dream 
which 
realizes 
his 
desire 
is 
believed 
during 
sleep, 
it 
removes 
the 
desire 
and 
makes 
sleep 
possible. 
It 
cannot 
be 
denied 
that 
this 
belief 
accords 
with 
the 
dream 
image, 
because 
it 
is 
arrayed 
in 
the 
psychical 
appearance 
of 
probability; 
the 
child 
is 
without 
the 
capacity 
which 
it 
will 
acquire 
later 
to 
distinguish 
hallucinations 
or 
phantasies 
from 
reality. 


The 
adult 
has 
learnt 
this 
differentiation; 
he 
has 
also 
learnt 
the 
futility 
of 
desire, 
and 
by 
continuous 
practice 
manages 
to 
postpone 
his 
aspirations, 
until 
they 
can 
be 
granted 
in 
some 
roundabout 
method 
by 
a 
change 
in 
the 
external 
world. 
For 
this 
reason 
it 
is 
rare 
for 
him 
to 
have 
his 
wishes 
realized 
during 
sleep 
in 
the 
short 
psychical 
way. 
It 
is 
even 
possible 
that 
this 
never 
happens, 
and 
that 
everything 
which 
appears 
to 
us 
like 
a 
child's 
dream 
demands 
a 
much 
more 
elaborate 
explanation. 
Thus 
it 
is 
that 
for 
adults--for 
every 
sane 
person 
without 
exception--a 
differentiation 
of 
the 
psychical 
matter 
has 
been 
fashioned 
which 
the 
child 
knew 
not. 
A 
psychical 
procedure 
has 
been 
reached 
which, 
informed 
by 
the 
experience 
of 
life, 
exercises 
with 
jealous 
power 
a 
dominating 
and 
restraining 
influence 
upon 
psychical 
emotions; 
by 
its 
relation 
to 
consciousness, 
and 
by 
its 
spontaneous 
mobility, 
it 
is 
endowed 
with 
the 
greatest 
means 
of 
psychical 
power. 
A 
portion 
of 
the 
infantile 
emotions 
has 
been 
withheld 
from 
this 
procedure 
as 
useless 
to 
life, 
and 
all 
the 
thoughts 



which 
flow 
from 
these 
are 
found 
in 
the 
state 
of 
repression. 


Whilst 
the 
procedure 
in 
which 
we 
recognize 
our 
normal 
ego 
reposes 
upon 
the 
desire 
for 
sleep, 
it 
appears 
compelled 
by 
the 
psycho-physiological 
conditions 
of 
sleep 
to 
abandon 
some 
of 
the 
energy 
with 
which 
it 
was 
wont 
during 
the 
day 
to 
keep 
down 
what 
was 
repressed. 
This 
neglect 
is 
really 
harmless; 
however 
much 
the 
emotions 
of 
the 
child's 
spirit 
may 
be 
stirred, 
they 
find 
the 
approach 
to 
consciousness 
rendered 
difficult, 
and 
that 
to 
movement 
blocked 
in 
consequence 
of 
the 
state 
of 
sleep. 
The 
danger 
of 
their 
disturbing 
sleep 
must, 
however, 
be 
avoided. 
Moreover, 
we 
must 
admit 
that 
even 
in 
deep 
sleep 
some 
amount 
of 
free 
attention 
is 
exerted 
as 
a 
protection 
against 
sense-stimuli 
which 
might, 
perchance, 
make 
an 
awakening 
seem 
wiser 
than 
the 
continuance 
of 
sleep. 
Otherwise 
we 
could 
not 
explain 
the 
fact 
of 
our 
being 
always 
awakened 
by 
stimuli 
of 
certain 
quality. 
As 
the 
old 
physiologist 
Burdach 
pointed 
out, 
the 
mother 
is 
awakened 
by 
the 
whimpering 
of 
her 
child, 
the 
miller 
by 
the 
cessation 
of 
his 
mill, 
most 
people 
by 
gently 
calling 
out 
their 
names. 
This 
attention, 
thus 
on 
the 
alert, 
makes 
use 
of 
the 
internal 
stimuli 
arising 
from 
repressed 
desires, 
and 
fuses 
them 
into 
the 
dream, 
which 
as 
a 
compromise 
satisfies 
both 
procedures 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
The 
dream 
creates 
a 
form 
of 
psychical 
release 
for 
the 
wish 
which 
is 
either 
suppressed 
or 
formed 
by 
the 
aid 
of 
repression, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
presents 
it 
as 
realized. 
The 
other 
procedure 
is 
also 
satisfied, 
since 
the 
continuance 
of 
the 
sleep 
is 
assured. 
Our 
ego 
here 
gladly 
behaves 
like 
a 
child; 
it 
makes 
the 
dream 
pictures 
believable, 
saying, 
as 
it 
were, 
"Quite 
right, 
but 
let 
me 
sleep." 
The 
contempt 
which, 
once 
awakened, 
we 
bear 
the 
dream, 
and 
which 
rests 
upon 
the 
absurdity 
and 
apparent 
illogicality 
of 
the 
dream, 
is 
probably 
nothing 
but 
the 
reasoning 
of 
our 
sleeping 
ego 
on 
the 
feelings 
about 
what 
was 
repressed; 
with 
greater 
right 
it 
should 
rest 
upon 
the 
incompetency 
of 
this 
disturber 
of 
our 
sleep. 
In 
sleep 
we 
are 
now 
and 
then 
aware 
of 
this 
contempt; 
the 
dream 
content 
transcends 
the 
censorship 
rather 
too 
much, 
we 
think, 
"It's 
only 
a 
dream," 
and 
sleep 
on. 


It 
is 
no 
objection 
to 
this 
view 
if 
there 
are 
borderlines 
for 
the 
dream 
where 
its 
function, 
to 
preserve 
sleep 
from 
interruption, 
can 
no 
longer 
be 
maintained--as 
in 
the 
dreams 
of 
impending 
dread. 
It 
is 
here 
changed 
for 
another 
function--to 
suspend 
the 
sleep 
at 
the 
proper 
time. 
It 
acts 
like 
a 
conscientious 
night-
watchman, 
who 
first 
does 
his 
duty 
by 
quelling 
disturbances 
so 
as 
not 
to 
waken 
the 
citizen, 
but 
equally 
does 
his 
duty 
quite 
properly 
when 
he 
awakens 
the 
street 
should 
the 
causes 
of 
the 
trouble 
seem 
to 
him 
serious 
and 
himself 



unable 
to 
cope 
with 
them 
alone. 


This 
function 
of 
dreams 
becomes 
especially 
well 
marked 
when 
there 
arises 
some 
incentive 
for 
the 
sense 
perception. 
That 
the 
senses 
aroused 
during 
sleep 
influence 
the 
dream 
is 
well 
known, 
and 
can 
be 
experimentally 
verified; 
it 
is 
one 
of 
the 
certain 
but 
much 
overestimated 
results 
of 
the 
medical 
investigation 
of 
dreams. 
Hitherto 
there 
has 
been 
an 
insoluble 
riddle 
connected 
with 
this 
discovery. 
The 
stimulus 
to 
the 
sense 
by 
which 
the 
investigator 
affects 
the 
sleeper 
is 
not 
properly 
recognized 
in 
the 
dream, 
but 
is 
intermingled 
with 
a 
number 
of 
indefinite 
interpretations, 
whose 
determination 
appears 
left 
to 
psychical 
free-will. 
There 
is, 
of 
course, 
no 
such 
psychical 
free-will. 
To 
an 
external 
sense-stimulus 
the 
sleeper 
can 
react 
in 
many 
ways. 
Either 
he 
awakens 
or 
he 
succeeds 
in 
sleeping 
on. 
In 
the 
latter 
case 
he 
can 
make 
use 
of 
the 
dream 
to 
dismiss 
the 
external 
stimulus, 
and 
this, 
again, 
in 
more 
ways 
than 
one. 
For 
instance, 
he 
can 
stay 
the 
stimulus 
by 
dreaming 
of 
a 
scene 
which 
is 
absolutely 
intolerable 
to 
him. 
This 
was 
the 
means 
used 
by 
one 
who 
was 
troubled 
by 
a 
painful 
perineal 
abscess. 
He 
dreamt 
that 
he 
was 
on 
horseback, 
and 
made 
use 
of 
the 
poultice, 
which 
was 
intended 
to 
alleviate 
his 
pain, 
as 
a 
saddle, 
and 
thus 
got 
away 
from 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
trouble. 
Or, 
as 
is 
more 
frequently 
the 
case, 
the 
external 
stimulus 
undergoes 
a 
new 
rendering, 
which 
leads 
him 
to 
connect 
it 
with 
a 
repressed 
desire 
seeking 
its 
realization, 
and 
robs 
him 
of 
its 
reality, 
and 
is 
treated 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
part 
of 
the 
psychical 
matter. 
Thus, 
some 
one 
dreamt 
that 
he 
had 
written 
a 
comedy 
which 
embodied 
a 
definite 
_motif_; 
it 
was 
being 
performed; 
the 
first 
act 
was 
over 
amid 
enthusiastic 
applause; 
there 
was 
great 
clapping. 
At 
this 
moment 
the 
dreamer 
must 
have 
succeeded 
in 
prolonging 
his 
sleep 
despite 
the 
disturbance, 
for 
when 
he 
woke 
he 
no 
longer 
heard 
the 
noise; 
he 
concluded 
rightly 
that 
some 
one 
must 
have 
been 
beating 
a 
carpet 
or 
bed. 
The 
dreams 
which 
come 
with 
a 
loud 
noise 
just 
before 
waking 
have 
all 
attempted 
to 
cover 
the 
stimulus 
to 
waking 
by 
some 
other 
explanation, 
and 
thus 
to 
prolong 
the 
sleep 
for 
a 
little 
while. 


Whosoever 
has 
firmly 
accepted 
this 
censorship 
as 
the 
chief 
motive 
for 
the 
distortion 
of 
dreams 
will 
not 
be 
surprised 
to 
learn 
as 
the 
result 
of 
dream 
interpretation 
that 
most 
of 
the 
dreams 
of 
adults 
are 
traced 
by 
analysis 
to 
erotic 
desires. 
This 
assertion 
is 
not 
drawn 
from 
dreams 
obviously 
of 
a 
sexual 
nature, 
which 
are 
known 
to 
all 
dreamers 
from 
their 
own 
experience, 
and 
are 
the 
only 
ones 
usually 
described 
as 
"sexual 
dreams." 
These 
dreams 
are 
ever 
sufficiently 



mysterious 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
choice 
of 
persons 
who 
are 
made 
the 
objects 
of 
sex, 
the 
removal 
of 
all 
the 
barriers 
which 
cry 
halt 
to 
the 
dreamer's 
sexual 
needs 
in 
his 
waking 
state, 
the 
many 
strange 
reminders 
as 
to 
details 
of 
what 
are 
called 
perversions. 
But 
analysis 
discovers 
that, 
in 
many 
other 
dreams 
in 
whose 
manifest 
content 
nothing 
erotic 
can 
be 
found, 
the 
work 
of 
interpretation 
shows 
them 
up 
as, 
in 
reality, 
realization 
of 
sexual 
desires; 
whilst, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
that 
much 
of 
the 
thought-making 
when 
awake, 
the 
thoughts 
saved 
us 
as 
surplus 
from 
the 
day 
only, 
reaches 
presentation 
in 
dreams 
with 
the 
help 
of 
repressed 
erotic 
desires. 


Towards 
the 
explanation 
of 
this 
statement, 
which 
is 
no 
theoretical 
postulate, 
it 
must 
be 
remembered 
that 
no 
other 
class 
of 
instincts 
has 
required 
so 
vast 
a 
suppression 
at 
the 
behest 
of 
civilization 
as 
the 
sexual, 
whilst 
their 
mastery 
by 
the 
highest 
psychical 
processes 
are 
in 
most 
persons 
soonest 
of 
all 
relinquished. 
Since 
we 
have 
learnt 
to 
understand 
infantile 
sexuality, 
often 
so 
vague 
in 
its 
expression, 
so 
invariably 
overlooked 
and 
misunderstood, 
we 
are 
justified 
in 
saying 
that 
nearly 
every 
civilized 
person 
has 
retained 
at 
some 
point 
or 
other 
the 
infantile 
type 
of 
sex 
life; 
thus 
we 
understand 
that 
repressed 
infantile 
sex 
desires 
furnish 
the 
most 
frequent 
and 
most 
powerful 
impulses 
for 
the 
formation 
of 
dreams.[1] 


If 
the 
dream, 
which 
is 
the 
expression 
of 
some 
erotic 
desire, 
succeeds 
in 
making 
its 
manifest 
content 
appear 
innocently 
asexual, 
it 
is 
only 
possible 
in 
one 
way. 
The 
matter 
of 
these 
sexual 
presentations 
cannot 
be 
exhibited 
as 
such, 
but 
must 
be 
replaced 
by 
allusions, 
suggestions, 
and 
similar 
indirect 
means; 
differing 
from 
other 
cases 
of 
indirect 
presentation, 
those 
used 
in 
dreams 
must 
be 
deprived 
of 
direct 
understanding. 
The 
means 
of 
presentation 
which 
answer 
these 
requirements 
are 
commonly 
termed 
"symbols." 
A 
special 
interest 
has 
been 
directed 
towards 
these, 
since 
it 
has 
been 
observed 
that 
the 
dreamers 
of 
the 
same 
language 
use 
the 
like 
symbols--indeed, 
that 
in 
certain 
cases 
community 
of 
symbol 
is 
greater 
than 
community 
of 
speech. 
Since 
the 
dreamers 
do 
not 
themselves 
know 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
symbols 
they 
use, 
it 
remains 
a 
puzzle 
whence 
arises 
their 
relationship 
with 
what 
they 
replace 
and 
denote. 
The 
fact 
itself 
is 
undoubted, 
and 
becomes 
of 
importance 
for 
the 
technique 
of 
the 
interpretation 
of 
dreams, 
since 
by 
the 
aid 
of 
a 
knowledge 
of 
this 
symbolism 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
understand 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
elements 
of 
a 
dream, 
or 
parts 
of 
a 
dream, 
occasionally 
even 
the 
whole 
dream 
itself, 
without 
having 
to 
question 
the 
dreamer 
as 
to 
his 
own 
ideas. 
We 
thus 
come 
near 
to 
the 



popular 
idea 
of 
an 
interpretation 
of 
dreams, 
and, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
possess 
again 
the 
technique 
of 
the 
ancients, 
among 
whom 
the 
interpretation 
of 
dreams 
was 
identical 
with 
their 
explanation 
through 
symbolism. 


Though 
the 
study 
of 
dream 
symbolism 
is 
far 
removed 
from 
finality, 
we 
now 
possess 
a 
series 
of 
general 
statements 
and 
of 
particular 
observations 
which 
are 
quite 
certain. 
There 
are 
symbols 
which 
practically 
always 
have 
the 
same 
meaning: 
Emperor 
and 
Empress 
(King 
and 
Queen) 
always 
mean 
the 
parents; 
room, 
a 
woman[2], 
and 
so 
on. 
The 
sexes 
are 
represented 
by 
a 
great 
variety 
of 
symbols, 
many 
of 
which 
would 
be 
at 
first 
quite 
incomprehensible 
had 
not 
the 
clews 
to 
the 
meaning 
been 
often 
obtained 
through 
other 
channels. 


There 
are 
symbols 
of 
universal 
circulation, 
found 
in 
all 
dreamers, 
of 
one 
range 
of 
speech 
and 
culture; 
there 
are 
others 
of 
the 
narrowest 
individual 
significance 
which 
an 
individual 
has 
built 
up 
out 
of 
his 
own 
material. 
In 
the 
first 
class 
those 
can 
be 
differentiated 
whose 
claim 
can 
be 
at 
once 
recognized 
by 
the 
replacement 
of 
sexual 
things 
in 
common 
speech 
(those, 
for 
instance, 
arising 
from 
agriculture, 
as 
reproduction, 
seed) 
from 
others 
whose 
sexual 
references 
appear 
to 
reach 
back 
to 
the 
earliest 
times 
and 
to 
the 
obscurest 
depths 
of 
our 
image-building. 
The 
power 
of 
building 
symbols 
in 
both 
these 
special 
forms 
of 
symbols 
has 
not 
died 
out. 
Recently 
discovered 
things, 
like 
the 
airship, 
are 
at 
once 
brought 
into 
universal 
use 
as 
sex 
symbols. 


It 
would 
be 
quite 
an 
error 
to 
suppose 
that 
a 
profounder 
knowledge 
of 
dream 
symbolism 
(the 
"Language 
of 
Dreams") 
would 
make 
us 
independent 
of 
questioning 
the 
dreamer 
regarding 
his 
impressions 
about 
the 
dream, 
and 
would 
give 
us 
back 
the 
whole 
technique 
of 
ancient 
dream 
interpreters. 
Apart 
from 
individual 
symbols 
and 
the 
variations 
in 
the 
use 
of 
what 
is 
general, 
one 
never 
knows 
whether 
an 
element 
in 
the 
dream 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
symbolically 
or 
in 
its 
proper 
meaning; 
the 
whole 
content 
of 
the 
dream 
is 
certainly 
not 
to 
be 
interpreted 
symbolically. 
The 
knowledge 
of 
dream 
symbols 
will 
only 
help 
us 
in 
understanding 
portions 
of 
the 
dream 
content, 
and 
does 
not 
render 
the 
use 
of 
the 
technical 
rules 
previously 
given 
at 
all 
superfluous. 
But 
it 
must 
be 
of 
the 
greatest 
service 
in 
interpreting 
a 
dream 
just 
when 
the 
impressions 
of 
the 
dreamer 
are 
withheld 
or 
are 
insufficient. 


Dream 
symbolism 
proves 
also 
indispensable 
for 
understanding 
the 
so-called 
"typical" 
dreams 
and 
the 
dreams 
that 
"repeat 
themselves." 
Dream 
symbolism 



leads 
us 
far 
beyond 
the 
dream; 
it 
does 
not 
belong 
only 
to 
dreams, 
but 
is 
likewise 
dominant 
in 
legend, 
myth, 
and 
saga, 
in 
wit 
and 
in 
folklore. 
It 
compels 
us 
to 
pursue 
the 
inner 
meaning 
of 
the 
dream 
in 
these 
productions. 
But 
we 
must 
acknowledge 
that 
symbolism 
is 
not 
a 
result 
of 
the 
dream 
work, 
but 
is 
a 
peculiarity 
probably 
of 
our 
unconscious 
thinking, 
which 
furnishes 
to 
the 
dream 
work 
the 
matter 
for 
condensation, 
displacement, 
and 
dramatization.

IV 


DREAM 
ANALYSIS 


Perhaps 
we 
shall 
now 
begin 
to 
suspect 
that 
dream 
interpretation 
is 
capable 
of 
giving 
us 
hints 
about 
the 
structure 
of 
our 
psychic 
apparatus 
which 
we 
have 
thus 
far 
expected 
in 
vain 
from 
philosophy. 
We 
shall 
not, 
however, 
follow 
this 
track, 
but 
return 
to 
our 
original 
problem 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
have 
cleared 
up 
the 
subject 
of 
dream-disfigurement. 
The 
question 
has 
arisen 
how 
dreams 
with 
disagreeable 
content 
can 
be 
analyzed 
as 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
wishes. 
We 
see 
now 
that 
this 
is 
possible 
in 
case 
dream-disfigurement 
has 
taken 
place, 
in 
case 
the 
disagreeable 
content 
serves 
only 
as 
a 
disguise 
for 
what 
is 
wished. 
Keeping 
in 
mind 
our 
assumptions 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
two 
psychic 
instances, 
we 
may 
now 
proceed 
to 
say: 
disagreeable 
dreams, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
contain 
something 
which 
is 
disagreeable 
to 
the 
second 
instance, 
but 
which 
at 
the 
same 
time 
fulfills 
a 
wish 
of 
the 
first 
instance. 
They 
are 
wish 
dreams 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
every 
dream 
originates 
in 
the 
first 
instance, 
while 
the 
second 
instance 
acts 
towards 
the 
dream 
only 
in 
repelling, 
not 
in 
a 
creative 
manner. 
If 
we 
limit 
ourselves 
to 
a 
consideration 
of 
what 
the 
second 
instance 
contributes 
to 
the 
dream, 
we 
can 
never 
understand 
the 
dream. 
If 
we 
do 
so, 
all 
the 
riddles 
which 
the 
authors 
have 
found 
in 
the 
dream 
remain 
unsolved. 


That 
the 
dream 
actually 
has 
a 
secret 
meaning, 
which 
turns 
out 
to 
be 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
a 
wish, 
must 
be 
proved 
afresh 
for 
every 
case 
by 
means 
of 
an 
analysis. 
I 
therefore 
select 
several 
dreams 
which 
have 
painful 
contents 
and 
attempt 
an 
analysis 
of 
them. 
They 
are 
partly 
dreams 
of 
hysterical 
subjects, 
which 
require 
long 
preliminary 
statements, 
and 
now 
and 
then 
also 
an 
examination 
of 
the 
psychic 
processes 
which 
occur 
in 
hysteria. 
I 
cannot, 
however, 
avoid 
this 
added 
difficulty 
in 
the 
exposition. 


When 
I 
give 
a 
psychoneurotic 
patient 
analytical 
treatment, 
dreams 
are 
always, 
as 
I 
have 
said, 
the 
subject 
of 
our 
discussion. 
It 
must, 
therefore, 
give 
him 
all 
the 
psychological 
explanations 
through 
whose 
aid 
I 
myself 
have 
come 
to 
an 
understanding 
of 
his 
symptoms, 
and 
here 
I 
undergo 
an 
unsparing 
criticism, 
which 
is 
perhaps 
not 
less 
keen 
than 
that 
I 
must 
expect 
from 
my 
colleagues. 
Contradiction 
of 
the 
thesis 
that 
all 
dreams 
are 
the 
fulfillments 
of 
wishes 
is 
raised 
by 
my 
patients 
with 
perfect 
regularity. 
Here 
are 
several 
examples 
of 
the 
dream 
material 
which 
is 
offered 
me 
to 
refute 
this 
position. 



"You 
always 
tell 
me 
that 
the 
dream 
is 
a 
wish 
fulfilled," 
begins 
a 
clever 
lady 
patient. 
"Now 
I 
shall 
tell 
you 
a 
dream 
in 
which 
the 
content 
is 
quite 
the 
opposite, 
in 
which 
a 
wish 
of 
mine 
is 
not 
fulfilled. 
How 
do 
you 
reconcile 
that 
with 
your 
theory? 
The 
dream 
is 
as 
follows:-


_"I 
want 
to 
give 
a 
supper, 
but 
having 
nothing 
at 
hand 
except 
some 
smoked 
salmon, 
I 
think 
of 
going 
marketing, 
but 
I 
remember 
that 
it 
is 
Sunday 
afternoon, 
when 
all 
the 
shops 
are 
closed. 
I 
next 
try 
to 
telephone 
to 
some 
caterers, 
but 
the 
telephone 
is 
out 
of 
order.... 
Thus 
I 
must 
resign 
my 
wish 
to 
give 
a 
supper."_ 


I 
answer, 
of 
course, 
that 
only 
the 
analysis 
can 
decide 
the 
meaning 
of 
this 
dream, 
although 
I 
admit 
that 
at 
first 
sight 
it 
seems 
sensible 
and 
coherent, 
and 
looks 
like 
the 
opposite 
of 
a 
wish-fulfillment. 
"But 
what 
occurrence 
has 
given 
rise 
to 
this 
dream?" 
I 
ask. 
"You 
know 
that 
the 
stimulus 
for 
a 
dream 
always 
lies 
among 
the 
experiences 
of 
the 
preceding 
day." 


_Analysis._--The 
husband 
of 
the 
patient, 
an 
upright 
and 
conscientious 
wholesale 
butcher, 
had 
told 
her 
the 
day 
before 
that 
he 
is 
growing 
too 
fat, 
and 
that 
he 
must, 
therefore, 
begin 
treatment 
for 
obesity. 
He 
was 
going 
to 
get 
up 
early, 
take 
exercise, 
keep 
to 
a 
strict 
diet, 
and 
above 
all 
accept 
no 
more 
invitations 
to 
suppers. 
She 
proceeds 
laughingly 
to 
relate 
how 
her 
husband 
at 
an 
inn 
table 
had 
made 
the 
acquaintance 
of 
an 
artist, 
who 
insisted 
upon 
painting 
his 
portrait 
because 
he, 
the 
painter, 
had 
never 
found 
such 
an 
expressive 
head. 
But 
her 
husband 
had 
answered 
in 
his 
rough 
way, 
that 
he 
was 
very 
thankful 
for 
the 
honor, 
but 
that 
he 
was 
quite 
convinced 
that 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
backside 
of 
a 
pretty 
young 
girl 
would 
please 
the 
artist 
better 
than 
his 
whole 
face[1]. 
She 
said 
that 
she 
was 
at 
the 
time 
very 
much 
in 
love 
with 
her 
husband, 
and 
teased 
him 
a 
good 
deal. 
She 
had 
also 
asked 
him 
not 
to 
send 
her 
any 
caviare. 
What 
does 
that 
mean? 


As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
she 
had 
wanted 
for 
a 
long 
time 
to 
eat 
a 
caviare 
sandwich 
every 
forenoon, 
but 
had 
grudged 
herself 
the 
expense. 
Of 
course, 
she 
would 
at 
once 
get 
the 
caviare 
from 
her 
husband, 
as 
soon 
as 
she 
asked 
him 
for 
it. 
But 
she 
had 
begged 
him, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
not 
to 
send 
her 
the 
caviare, 
in 
order 
that 
she 
might 
tease 
him 
about 
it 
longer. 


This 
explanation 
seems 
far-fetched 
to 
me. 
Unadmitted 
motives 
are 
in 
the 



habit 
of 
hiding 
behind 
such 
unsatisfactory 
explanations. 
We 
are 
reminded 
of 
subjects 
hypnotized 
by 
Bernheim, 
who 
carried 
out 
a 
posthypnotic 
order, 
and 
who, 
upon 
being 
asked 
for 
their 
motives, 
instead 
of 
answering: 
"I 
do 
not 
know 
why 
I 
did 
that," 
had 
to 
invent 
a 
reason 
that 
was 
obviously 
inadequate. 
Something 
similar 
is 
probably 
the 
case 
with 
the 
caviare 
of 
my 
patient. 
I 
see 
that 
she 
is 
compelled 
to 
create 
an 
unfulfilled 
wish 
in 
life. 
Her 
dream 
also 
shows 
the 
reproduction 
of 
the 
wish 
as 
accomplished. 
But 
why 
does 
she 
need 
an 
unfulfilled 
wish? 


The 
ideas 
so 
far 
produced 
are 
insufficient 
for 
the 
interpretation 
of 
the 
dream. 
I 
beg 
for 
more. 
After 
a 
short 
pause, 
which 
corresponds 
to 
the 
overcoming 
of 
a 
resistance, 
she 
reports 
further 
that 
the 
day 
before 
she 
had 
made 
a 
visit 
to 
a 
friend, 
of 
whom 
she 
is 
really 
jealous, 
because 
her 
husband 
is 
always 
praising 
this 
woman 
so 
much. 
Fortunately, 
this 
friend 
is 
very 
lean 
and 
thin, 
and 
her 
husband 
likes 
well-rounded 
figures. 
Now 
of 
what 
did 
this 
lean 
friend 
speak? 
Naturally 
of 
her 
wish 
to 
become 
somewhat 
stouter. 
She 
also 
asked 
my 
patient: 
"When 
are 
you 
going 
to 
invite 
us 
again? 
You 
always 
have 
such 
a 
good 
table." 


Now 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
dream 
is 
clear. 
I 
may 
say 
to 
the 
patient: 
"It 
is 
just 
as 
though 
you 
had 
thought 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
request: 
'Of 
course, 
I'll 
invite 
you, 
so 
you 
can 
eat 
yourself 
fat 
at 
my 
house 
and 
become 
still 
more 
pleasing 
to 
my 
husband. 
I 
would 
rather 
give 
no 
more 
suppers.' 
The 
dream 
then 
tells 
you 
that 
you 
cannot 
give 
a 
supper, 
thereby 
fulfilling 
your 
wish 
not 
to 
contribute 
anything 
to 
the 
rounding 
out 
of 
your 
friend's 
figure. 
The 
resolution 
of 
your 
husband 
to 
refuse 
invitations 
to 
supper 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
getting 
thin 
teaches 
you 
that 
one 
grows 
fat 
on 
the 
things 
served 
in 
company." 
Now 
only 
some 
conversation 
is 
necessary 
to 
confirm 
the 
solution. 
The 
smoked 
salmon 
in 
the 
dream 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
traced. 
"How 
did 
the 
salmon 
mentioned 
in 
the 
dream 
occur 
to 
you?" 
"Smoked 
salmon 
is 
the 
favorite 
dish 
of 
this 
friend," 
she 
answered. 
I 
happen 
to 
know 
the 
lady, 
and 
may 
corroborate 
this 
by 
saying 
that 
she 
grudges 
herself 
the 
salmon 
just 
as 
much 
as 
my 
patient 
grudges 
herself 
the 
caviare. 


The 
dream 
admits 
of 
still 
another 
and 
more 
exact 
interpretation, 
which 
is 
necessitated 
only 
by 
a 
subordinate 
circumstance. 
The 
two 
interpretations 
do 
not 
contradict 
one 
another, 
but 
rather 
cover 
each 
other 
and 
furnish 
a 
neat 
example 
of 
the 
usual 
ambiguity 
of 
dreams 
as 
well 
as 
of 
all 
other 



psychopathological 
formations. 
We 
have 
seen 
that 
at 
the 
same 
time 
that 
she 
dreams 
of 
the 
denial 
of 
the 
wish, 
the 
patient 
is 
in 
reality 
occupied 
in 
securing 
an 
unfulfilled 
wish 
(the 
caviare 
sandwiches). 
Her 
friend, 
too, 
had 
expressed 
a 
wish, 
namely, 
to 
get 
fatter, 
and 
it 
would 
not 
surprise 
us 
if 
our 
lady 
had 
dreamt 
that 
the 
wish 
of 
the 
friend 
was 
not 
being 
fulfilled. 
For 
it 
is 
her 
own 
wish 
that 
a 
wish 
of 
her 
friend's--for 
increase 
in 
weight--should 
not 
be 
fulfilled. 
Instead 
of 
this, 
however, 
she 
dreams 
that 
one 
of 
her 
own 
wishes 
is 
not 
fulfilled. 
The 
dream 
becomes 
capable 
of 
a 
new 
interpretation, 
if 
in 
the 
dream 
she 
does 
not 
intend 
herself, 
but 
her 
friend, 
if 
she 
has 
put 
herself 
in 
the 
place 
of 
her 
friend, 
or, 
as 
we 
may 
say, 
has 
identified 
herself 
with 
her 
friend. 


I 
think 
she 
has 
actually 
done 
this, 
and 
as 
a 
sign 
of 
this 
identification 
she 
has 
created 
an 
unfulfilled 
wish 
in 
reality. 
But 
what 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
this 
hysterical 
identification? 
To 
clear 
this 
up 
a 
thorough 
exposition 
is 
necessary. 
Identification 
is 
a 
highly 
important 
factor 
in 
the 
mechanism 
of 
hysterical 
symptoms; 
by 
this 
means 
patients 
are 
enabled 
in 
their 
symptoms 
to 
represent 
not 
merely 
their 
own 
experiences, 
but 
the 
experiences 
of 
a 
great 
number 
of 
other 
persons, 
and 
can 
suffer, 
as 
it 
were, 
for 
a 
whole 
mass 
of 
people, 
and 
fill 
all 
the 
parts 
of 
a 
drama 
by 
means 
of 
their 
own 
personalities 
alone. 
It 
will 
here 
be 
objected 
that 
this 
is 
well-known 
hysterical 
imitation, 
the 
ability 
of 
hysteric 
subjects 
to 
copy 
all 
the 
symptoms 
which 
impress 
them 
when 
they 
occur 
in 
others, 
as 
though 
their 
pity 
were 
stimulated 
to 
the 
point 
of 
reproduction. 
But 
this 
only 
indicates 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
psychic 
process 
is 
discharged 
in 
hysterical 
imitation; 
the 
way 
in 
which 
a 
psychic 
act 
proceeds 
and 
the 
act 
itself 
are 
two 
different 
things. 
The 
latter 
is 
slightly 
more 
complicated 
than 
one 
is 
apt 
to 
imagine 
the 
imitation 
of 
hysterical 
subjects 
to 
be: 
it 
corresponds 
to 
an 
unconscious 
concluded 
process, 
as 
an 
example 
will 
show. 
The 
physician 
who 
has 
a 
female 
patient 
with 
a 
particular 
kind 
of 
twitching, 
lodged 
in 
the 
company 
of 
other 
patients 
in 
the 
same 
room 
of 
the 
hospital, 
is 
not 
surprised 
when 
some 
morning 
he 
learns 
that 
this 
peculiar 
hysterical 
attack 
has 
found 
imitations. 
He 
simply 
says 
to 
himself: 
The 
others 
have 
seen 
her 
and 
have 
done 
likewise: 
that 
is 
psychic 
infection. 
Yes, 
but 
psychic 
infection 
proceeds 
in 
somewhat 
the 
following 
manner: 
As 
a 
rule, 
patients 
know 
more 
about 
one 
another 
than 
the 
physician 
knows 
about 
each 
of 
them, 
and 
they 
are 
concerned 
about 
each 
other 
when 
the 
visit 
of 
the 
doctor 
is 
over. 
Some 
of 
them 
have 
an 
attack 
to-day: 
soon 
it 
is 
known 
among 
the 
rest 
that 
a 
letter 
from 
home, 
a 
return 
of 
lovesickness 
or 
the 
like, 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
it. 
Their 
sympathy 
is 



aroused, 
and 
the 
following 
syllogism, 
which 
does 
not 
reach 
consciousness, 
is 
completed 
in 
them: 
"If 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
have 
this 
kind 
of 
an 
attack 
from 
such 
causes, 
I 
too 
may 
have 
this 
kind 
of 
an 
attack, 
for 
I 
have 
the 
same 
reasons." 
If 
this 
were 
a 
cycle 
capable 
of 
becoming 
conscious, 
it 
would 
perhaps 
express 
itself 
in 
fear 
of 
getting 
the 
same 
attack; 
but 
it 
takes 
place 
in 
another 
psychic 
sphere, 
and, 
therefore, 
ends 
in 
the 
realization 
of 
the 
dreaded 
symptom. 
Identification 
is 
therefore 
not 
a 
simple 
imitation, 
but 
a 
sympathy 
based 
upon 
the 
same 
etiological 
claim; 
it 
expresses 
an 
"as 
though," 
and 
refers 
to 
some 
common 
quality 
which 
has 
remained 
in 
the 
unconscious. 


Identification 
is 
most 
often 
used 
in 
hysteria 
to 
express 
sexual 
community. 
An 
hysterical 
woman 
identifies 
herself 
most 
readily--although 
not 
exclusively-with 
persons 
with 
whom 
she 
has 
had 
sexual 
relations, 
or 
who 
have 
sexual 
intercourse 
with 
the 
same 
persons 
as 
herself. 
Language 
takes 
such 
a 
conception 
into 
consideration: 
two 
lovers 
are 
"one." 
In 
the 
hysterical 
phantasy, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
dream, 
it 
is 
sufficient 
for 
the 
identification 
if 
one 
thinks 
of 
sexual 
relations, 
whether 
or 
not 
they 
become 
real. 
The 
patient, 
then, 
only 
follows 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
hysterical 
thought 
processes 
when 
she 
gives 
expression 
to 
her 
jealousy 
of 
her 
friend 
(which, 
moreover, 
she 
herself 
admits 
to 
be 
unjustified, 
in 
that 
she 
puts 
herself 
in 
her 
place 
and 
identifies 
herself 
with 
her 
by 
creating 
a 
symptom--the 
denied 
wish). 
I 
might 
further 
clarify 
the 
process 
specifically 
as 
follows: 
She 
puts 
herself 
in 
the 
place 
of 
her 
friend 
in 
the 
dream, 
because 
her 
friend 
has 
taken 
her 
own 
place 
relation 
to 
her 
husband, 
and 
because 
she 
would 
like 
to 
take 
her 
friend's 
place 
in 
the 
esteem 
of 
her 
husband[2]. 


The 
contradiction 
to 
my 
theory 
of 
dreams 
in 
the 
case 
of 
another 
female 
patient, 
the 
most 
witty 
among 
all 
my 
dreamers, 
was 
solved 
in 
a 
simpler 
manner, 
although 
according 
to 
the 
scheme 
that 
the 
non-fulfillment 
of 
one 
wish 
signifies 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
another. 
I 
had 
one 
day 
explained 
to 
her 
that 
the 
dream 
is 
a 
wish 
of 
fulfillment. 
The 
next 
day 
she 
brought 
me 
a 
dream 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
she 
was 
traveling 
with 
her 
mother-in-law 
to 
their 
common 
summer 
resort. 
Now 
I 
knew 
that 
she 
had 
struggled 
violently 
against 
spending 
the 
summer 
in 
the 
neighborhood 
of 
her 
mother-in-law. 
I 
also 
knew 
that 
she 
had 
luckily 
avoided 
her 
mother-in-law 
by 
renting 
an 
estate 
in 
a 
far-distant 
country 
resort. 
Now 
the 
dream 
reversed 
this 
wished-for 
solution; 
was 
not 
this 
in 
the 
flattest 
contradiction 
to 
my 
theory 
of 
wish-fulfillment 
in 
the 
dream? 
Certainly, 
it 
was 
only 
necessary 
to 
draw 
the 
inferences 
from 
this 
dream 
in 



order 
to 
get 
at 
its 
interpretation. 
According 
to 
this 
dream, 
I 
was 
in 
the 
wrong. 
_It 
was 
thus 
her 
wish 
that 
I 
should 
be 
in 
the 
wrong, 
and 
this 
wish 
the 
dream 
showed 
her 
as 
fulfilled._ 
But 
the 
wish 
that 
I 
should 
be 
in 
the 
wrong, 
which 
was 
fulfilled 
in 
the 
theme 
of 
the 
country 
home, 
referred 
to 
a 
more 
serious 
matter. 
At 
that 
time 
I 
had 
made 
up 
my 
mind, 
from 
the 
material 
furnished 
by 
her 
analysis, 
that 
something 
of 
significance 
for 
her 
illness 
must 
have 
occurred 
at 
a 
certain 
time 
in 
her 
life. 
She 
had 
denied 
it 
because 
it 
was 
not 
present 
in 
her 
memory. 
We 
soon 
came 
to 
see 
that 
I 
was 
in 
the 
right. 
Her 
wish 
that 
I 
should 
be 
in 
the 
wrong, 
which 
is 
transformed 
into 
the 
dream, 
thus 
corresponded 
to 
the 
justifiable 
wish 
that 
those 
things, 
which 
at 
the 
time 
had 
only 
been 
suspected, 
had 
never 
occurred 
at 
all. 


Without 
an 
analysis, 
and 
merely 
by 
means 
of 
an 
assumption, 
I 
took 
the 
liberty 
of 
interpreting 
a 
little 
occurrence 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
friend, 
who 
had 
been 
my 
colleague 
through 
the 
eight 
classes 
of 
the 
Gymnasium. 
He 
once 
heard 
a 
lecture 
of 
mine 
delivered 
to 
a 
small 
assemblage, 
on 
the 
novel 
subject 
of 
the 
dream 
as 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
a 
wish. 
He 
went 
home, 
dreamt 
_that 
he 
had 
lost 
all 
his 
suits_--he 
was 
a 
lawyer--and 
then 
complained 
to 
me 
about 
it. 
I 
took 
refuge 
in 
the 
evasion: 
"One 
can't 
win 
all 
one's 
suits," 
but 
I 
thought 
to 
myself: 
"If 
for 
eight 
years 
I 
sat 
as 
Primus 
on 
the 
first 
bench, 
while 
he 
moved 
around 
somewhere 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
class, 
may 
he 
not 
naturally 
have 
had 
a 
wish 
from 
his 
boyhood 
days 
that 
I, 
too, 
might 
for 
once 
completely 
disgrace 
myself?" 


In 
the 
same 
way 
another 
dream 
of 
a 
more 
gloomy 
character 
was 
offered 
me 
by 
a 
female 
patient 
as 
a 
contradiction 
to 
my 
theory 
of 
the 
wish-dream. 
The 
patient, 
a 
young 
girl, 
began 
as 
follows: 
"You 
remember 
that 
my 
sister 
has 
now 
only 
one 
boy, 
Charles: 
she 
lost 
the 
elder 
one, 
Otto, 
while 
I 
was 
still 
at 
her 
house. 
Otto 
was 
my 
favorite; 
it 
was 
I 
who 
really 
brought 
him 
up. 
I 
like 
the 
other 
little 
fellow, 
too, 
but 
of 
course 
not 
nearly 
as 
much 
as 
the 
dead 
one. 
Now 
I 
dreamt 
last 
night 
that 
_I 
saw 
Charles 
lying 
dead 
before 
me. 
He 
was 
lying 
in 
his 
little 
coffin, 
his 
hands 
folded: 
there 
were 
candles 
all 
about, 
and, 
in 
short, 
it 
was 
just 
like 
the 
time 
of 
little 
Otto's 
death, 
which 
shocked 
me 
so 
profoundly_. 
Now 
tell 
me, 
what 
does 
this 
mean? 
You 
know 
me: 
am 
I 
really 
bad 
enough 
to 
wish 
my 
sister 
to 
lose 
the 
only 
child 
she 
has 
left? 
Or 
does 
the 
dream 
mean 
that 
I 
wish 
Charles 
to 
be 
dead 
rather 
than 
Otto, 
whom 
I 
like 
so 
much 
better?" 



I 
assured 
her 
that 
this 
interpretation 
was 
impossible. 
After 
some 
reflection 
I 
was 
able 
to 
give 
her 
the 
interpretation 
of 
the 
dream, 
which 
I 
subsequently 
made 
her 
confirm. 


Having 
become 
an 
orphan 
at 
an 
early 
age, 
the 
girl 
had 
been 
brought 
up 
in 
the 
house 
of 
a 
much 
older 
sister, 
and 
had 
met 
among 
the 
friends 
and 
visitors 
who 
came 
to 
the 
house, 
a 
man 
who 
made 
a 
lasting 
impression 
upon 
her 
heart. 
It 
looked 
for 
a 
time 
as 
though 
these 
barely 
expressed 
relations 
were 
to 
end 
in 
marriage, 
but 
this 
happy 
culmination 
was 
frustrated 
by 
the 
sister, 
whose 
motives 
have 
never 
found 
a 
complete 
explanation. 
After 
the 
break, 
the 
man 
who 
was 
loved 
by 
our 
patient 
avoided 
the 
house: 
she 
herself 
became 
independent 
some 
time 
after 
little 
Otto's 
death, 
to 
whom 
her 
affection 
had 
now 
turned. 
But 
she 
did 
not 
succeed 
in 
freeing 
herself 
from 
the 
inclination 
for 
her 
sister's 
friend 
in 
which 
she 
had 
become 
involved. 
Her 
pride 
commanded 
her 
to 
avoid 
him; 
but 
it 
was 
impossible 
for 
her 
to 
transfer 
her 
love 
to 
the 
other 
suitors 
who 
presented 
themselves 
in 
order. 
Whenever 
the 
man 
whom 
she 
loved, 
who 
was 
a 
member 
of 
the 
literary 
profession, 
announced 
a 
lecture 
anywhere, 
she 
was 
sure 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
audience; 
she 
also 
seized 
every 
other 
opportunity 
to 
see 
him 
from 
a 
distance 
unobserved 
by 
him. 
I 
remembered 
that 
on 
the 
day 
before 
she 
had 
told 
me 
that 
the 
Professor 
was 
going 
to 
a 
certain 
concert, 
and 
that 
she 
was 
also 
going 
there, 
in 
order 
to 
enjoy 
the 
sight 
of 
him. 
This 
was 
on 
the 
day 
of 
the 
dream; 
and 
the 
concert 
was 
to 
take 
place 
on 
the 
day 
on 
which 
she 
told 
me 
the 
dream. 
I 
could 
now 
easily 
see 
the 
correct 
interpretation, 
and 
I 
asked 
her 
whether 
she 
could 
think 
of 
any 
event 
which 
had 
happened 
after 
the 
death 
of 
little 
Otto. 
She 
answered 
immediately: 
"Certainly; 
at 
that 
time 
the 
Professor 
returned 
after 
a 
long 
absence, 
and 
I 
saw 
him 
once 
more 
beside 
the 
coffin 
of 
little 
Otto." 
It 
was 
exactly 
as 
I 
had 
expected. 
I 
interpreted 
the 
dream 
in 
the 
following 
manner: 
"If 
now 
the 
other 
boy 
were 
to 
die, 
the 
same 
thing 
would 
be 
repeated. 
You 
would 
spend 
the 
day 
with 
your 
sister, 
the 
Professor 
would 
surely 
come 
in 
order 
to 
offer 
condolence, 
and 
you 
would 
see 
him 
again 
under 
the 
same 
circumstances 
as 
at 
that 
time. 
The 
dream 
signifies 
nothing 
but 
this 
wish 
of 
yours 
to 
see 
him 
again, 
against 
which 
you 
are 
fighting 
inwardly. 
I 
know 
that 
you 
are 
carrying 
the 
ticket 
for 
to-day's 
concert 
in 
your 
bag. 
Your 
dream 
is 
a 
dream 
of 
impatience; 
it 
has 
anticipated 
the 
meeting 
which 
is 
to 
take 
place 
to-day 
by 
several 
hours." 


In 
order 
to 
disguise 
her 
wish 
she 
had 
obviously 
selected 
a 
situation 
in 
which 



wishes 
of 
that 
sort 
are 
commonly 
suppressed--a 
situation 
which 
is 
so 
filled 
with 
sorrow 
that 
love 
is 
not 
thought 
of. 
And 
yet, 
it 
is 
very 
easily 
probable 
that 
even 
in 
the 
actual 
situation 
at 
the 
bier 
of 
the 
second, 
more 
dearly 
loved 
boy, 
which 
the 
dream 
copied 
faithfully, 
she 
had 
not 
been 
able 
to 
suppress 
her 
feelings 
of 
affection 
for 
the 
visitor 
whom 
she 
had 
missed 
for 
so 
long 
a 
time. 


A 
different 
explanation 
was 
found 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
similar 
dream 
of 
another 
female 
patient, 
who 
was 
distinguished 
in 
her 
earlier 
years 
by 
her 
quick 
wit 
and 
her 
cheerful 
demeanors 
and 
who 
still 
showed 
these 
qualities 
at 
least 
in 
the 
notion, 
which 
occurred 
to 
her 
in 
the 
course 
of 
treatment. 
In 
connection 
with 
a 
longer 
dream, 
it 
seemed 
to 
this 
lady 
that 
she 
saw 
her 
fifteen-year-old 
daughter 
lying 
dead 
before 
her 
in 
a 
box. 
She 
was 
strongly 
inclined 
to 
convert 
this 
dream-image 
into 
an 
objection 
to 
the 
theory 
of 
wish-fulfillment, 
but 
herself 
suspected 
that 
the 
detail 
of 
the 
box 
must 
lead 
to 
a 
different 
conception 
of 
the 
dream.[3] 
In 
the 
course 
of 
the 
analysis 
it 
occurred 
to 
her 
that 
on 
the 
evening 
before, 
the 
conversation 
of 
the 
company 
had 
turned 
upon 
the 
English 
word 
"box," 
and 
upon 
the 
numerous 
translations 
of 
it 
into 
German, 
such 
as 
box, 
theater 
box, 
chest, 
box 
on 
the 
ear, 
&c. 
From 
other 
components 
of 
the 
same 
dream 
it 
is 
now 
possible 
to 
add 
that 
the 
lady 
had 
guessed 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
English 
word 
"box" 
and 
the 
German 
_Büchse_, 
and 
had 
then 
been 
haunted 
by 
the 
memory 
that 
_Büchse_ 
(as 
well 
as 
"box") 
is 
used 
in 
vulgar 
speech 
to 
designate 
the 
female 
genital 
organ. 
It 
was 
therefore 
possible, 
making 
a 
certain 
allowance 
for 
her 
notions 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
topographical 
anatomy, 
to 
assume 
that 
the 
child 
in 
the 
box 
signified 
a 
child 
in 
the 
womb 
of 
the 
mother. 
At 
this 
stage 
of 
the 
explanation 
she 
no 
longer 
denied 
that 
the 
picture 
of 
the 
dream 
really 
corresponded 
to 
one 
of 
her 
wishes. 
Like 
so 
many 
other 
young 
women, 
she 
was 
by 
no 
means 
happy 
when 
she 
became 
pregnant, 
and 
admitted 
to 
me 
more 
than 
once 
the 
wish 
that 
her 
child 
might 
die 
before 
its 
birth; 
in 
a 
fit 
of 
anger 
following 
a 
violent 
scene 
with 
her 
husband 
she 
had 
even 
struck 
her 
abdomen 
with 
her 
fists 
in 
order 
to 
hit 
the 
child 
within. 
The 
dead 
child 
was, 
therefore, 
really 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
a 
wish, 
but 
a 
wish 
which 
had 
been 
put 
aside 
for 
fifteen 
years, 
and 
it 
is 
not 
surprising 
that 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
the 
wish 
was 
no 
longer 
recognized 
after 
so 
long 
an 
interval. 
For 
there 
had 
been 
many 
changes 
meanwhile. 


The 
group 
of 
dreams 
to 
which 
the 
two 
last 
mentioned 
belong, 
having 
as 
content 
the 
death 
of 
beloved 
relatives, 
will 
be 
considered 
again 
under 
the 
head 
of 
"Typical 
Dreams." 
I 
shall 
there 
be 
able 
to 
show 
by 
new 
examples 
that 



in 
spite 
of 
their 
undesirable 
content, 
all 
these 
dreams 
must 
be 
interpreted 
as 
wish-fulfillments. 
For 
the 
following 
dream, 
which 
again 
was 
told 
me 
in 
order 
to 
deter 
me 
from 
a 
hasty 
generalization 
of 
the 
theory 
of 
wishing 
in 
dreams, 
I 
am 
indebted, 
not 
to 
a 
patient, 
but 
to 
an 
intelligent 
jurist 
of 
my 
acquaintance. 
"I 
dream," 
my 
informant 
tells 
me, 
"_that 
I 
am 
walking 
in 
front 
of 
my 
house 
with 
a 
lady 
on 
my 
arm. 
Here 
a 
closed 
wagon 
is 
waiting, 
a 
gentleman 
steps 
up 
to 
me, 
gives 
his 
authority 
as 
an 
agent 
of 
the 
police, 
and 
demands 
that 
I 
should 
follow 
him. 
I 
only 
ask 
for 
time 
in 
which 
to 
arrange 
my 
affairs._ 
Can 
you 
possibly 
suppose 
this 
is 
a 
wish 
of 
mine 
to 
be 
arrested?" 
"Of 
course 
not," 
I 
must 
admit. 
"Do 
you 
happen 
to 
know 
upon 
what 
charge 
you 
were 
arrested?" 
"Yes; 
I 
believe 
for 
infanticide." 
"Infanticide? 
But 
you 
know 
that 
only 
a 
mother 
can 
commit 
this 
crime 
upon 
her 
newly 
born 
child?" 
"That 
is 
true."[4] 
"And 
under 
what 
circumstances 
did 
you 
dream; 
what 
happened 
on 
the 
evening 
before?" 
"I 
would 
rather 
not 
tell 
you 
that; 
it 
is 
a 
delicate 
matter." 
"But 
I 
must 
have 
it, 
otherwise 
we 
must 
forgo 
the 
interpretation 
of 
the 
dream." 
"Well, 
then, 
I 
will 
tell 
you. 
I 
spent 
the 
night, 
not 
at 
home, 
but 
at 
the 
house 
of 
a 
lady 
who 
means 
very 
much 
to 
me. 
When 
we 
awoke 
in 
the 
morning, 
something 
again 
passed 
between 
us. 
Then 
I 
went 
to 
sleep 
again, 
and 
dreamt 
what 
I 
have 
told 
you." 
"The 
woman 
is 
married?" 
"Yes." 
"And 
you 
do 
not 
wish 
her 
to 
conceive 
a 
child?" 
"No; 
that 
might 
betray 
us." 
"Then 
you 
do 
not 
practice 
normal 
coitus?" 
"I 
take 
the 
precaution 
to 
withdraw 
before 
ejaculation." 
"Am 
I 
permitted 
to 
assume 
that 
you 
did 
this 
trick 
several 
times 
during 
the 
night, 
and 
that 
in 
the 
morning 
you 
were 
not 
quite 
sure 
whether 
you 
had 
succeeded?" 
"That 
might 
be 
the 
case." 
"Then 
your 
dream 
is 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
a 
wish. 
By 
means 
of 
it 
you 
secure 
the 
assurance 
that 
you 
have 
not 
begotten 
a 
child, 
or, 
what 
amounts 
to 
the 
same 
thing, 
that 
you 
have 
killed 
a 
child. 
I 
can 
easily 
demonstrate 
the 
connecting 
links. 
Do 
you 
remember, 
a 
few 
days 
ago 
we 
were 
talking 
about 
the 
distress 
of 
matrimony 
(Ehenot), 
and 
about 
the 
inconsistency 
of 
permitting 
the 
practice 
of 
coitus 
as 
long 
as 
no 
impregnation 
takes 
place, 
while 
every 
delinquency 
after 
the 
ovum 
and 
the 
semen 
meet 
and 
a 
foetus 
is 
formed 
is 
punished 
as 
a 
crime? 
In 
connection 
with 
this, 
we 
also 
recalled 
the 
mediæval 
controversy 
about 
the 
moment 
of 
time 
at 
which 
the 
soul 
is 
really 
lodged 
in 
the 
foetus, 
since 
the 
concept 
of 
murder 
becomes 
admissible 
only 
from 
that 
point 
on. 
Doubtless 
you 
also 
know 
the 
gruesome 
poem 
by 
Lenau, 
which 
puts 
infanticide 
and 
the 
prevention 
of 
children 
on 
the 
same 
plane." 
"Strangely 
enough, 
I 
had 
happened 
to 
think 
of 
Lenau 
during 
the 
afternoon." 
"Another 
echo 
of 
your 
dream. 
And 
now 
I 
shall 



demonstrate 
to 
you 
another 
subordinate 
wish-fulfillment 
in 
your 
dream. 
You 
walk 
in 
front 
of 
your 
house 
with 
the 
lady 
on 
your 
arm. 
So 
you 
take 
her 
home, 
instead 
of 
spending 
the 
night 
at 
her 
house, 
as 
you 
do 
in 
actuality. 
The 
fact 
that 
the 
wish-fulfillment, 
which 
is 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
dream, 
disguises 
itself 
in 
such 
an 
unpleasant 
form, 
has 
perhaps 
more 
than 
one 
reason. 
From 
my 
essay 
on 
the 
etiology 
of 
anxiety 
neuroses, 
you 
will 
see 
that 
I 
note 
interrupted 
coitus 
as 
one 
of 
the 
factors 
which 
cause 
the 
development 
of 
neurotic 
fear. 
It 
would 
be 
consistent 
with 
this 
that 
if 
after 
repeated 
cohabitation 
of 
the 
kind 
mentioned 
you 
should 
be 
left 
in 
an 
uncomfortable 
mood, 
which 
now 
becomes 
an 
element 
in 
the 
composition 
of 
your 
dream. 
You 
also 
make 
use 
of 
this 
unpleasant 
state 
of 
mind 
to 
conceal 
the 
wish-fulfillment. 
Furthermore, 
the 
mention 
of 
infanticide 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
explained. 
Why 
does 
this 
crime, 
which 
is 
peculiar 
to 
females, 
occur 
to 
you?" 
"I 
shall 
confess 
to 
you 
that 
I 
was 
involved 
in 
such 
an 
affair 
years 
ago. 
Through 
my 
fault 
a 
girl 
tried 
to 
protect 
herself 
from 
the 
consequences 
of 
a 
liaison 
with 
me 
by 
securing 
an 
abortion. 
I 
had 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
carrying 
out 
the 
plan, 
but 
I 
was 
naturally 
for 
a 
long 
time 
worried 
lest 
the 
affair 
might 
be 
discovered." 
"I 
understand; 
this 
recollection 
furnished 
a 
second 
reason 
why 
the 
supposition 
that 
you 
had 
done 
your 
trick 
badly 
must 
have 
been 
painful 
to 
you." 


A 
young 
physician, 
who 
had 
heard 
this 
dream 
of 
my 
colleague 
when 
it 
was 
told, 
must 
have 
felt 
implicated 
by 
it, 
for 
he 
hastened 
to 
imitate 
it 
in 
a 
dream 
of 
his 
own, 
applying 
its 
mode 
of 
thinking 
to 
another 
subject. 
The 
day 
before 
he 
had 
handed 
in 
a 
declaration 
of 
his 
income, 
which 
was 
perfectly 
honest, 
because 
he 
had 
little 
to 
declare. 
He 
dreamt 
that 
an 
acquaintance 
of 
his 
came 
from 
a 
meeting 
of 
the 
tax 
commission 
and 
informed 
him 
that 
all 
the 
other 
declarations 
of 
income 
had 
passed 
uncontested, 
but 
that 
his 
own 
had 
awakened 
general 
suspicion, 
and 
that 
he 
would 
be 
punished 
with 
a 
heavy 
fine. 
The 
dream 
is 
a 
poorly-concealed 
fulfillment 
of 
the 
wish 
to 
be 
known 
as 
a 
physician 
with 
a 
large 
income. 
It 
likewise 
recalls 
the 
story 
of 
the 
young 
girl 
who 
was 
advised 
against 
accepting 
her 
suitor 
because 
he 
was 
a 
man 
of 
quick 
temper 
who 
would 
surely 
treat 
her 
to 
blows 
after 
they 
were 
married. 


The 
answer 
of 
the 
girl 
was: 
"I 
wish 
he 
would 
strike 
me!" 
Her 
wish 
to 
be 
married 
is 
so 
strong 
that 
she 
takes 
into 
the 
bargain 
the 
discomfort 
which 
is 
said 
to 
be 
connected 
with 
matrimony, 
and 
which 
is 
predicted 
for 
her, 
and 
even 
raises 
it 
to 
a 
wish. 



If 
I 
group 
the 
very 
frequently 
occurring 
dreams 
of 
this 
sort, 
which 
seem 
flatly 
to 
contradict 
my 
theory, 
in 
that 
they 
contain 
the 
denial 
of 
a 
wish 
or 
some 
occurrence 
decidedly 
unwished 
for, 
under 
the 
head 
of 
"counter 
wish-dreams," 
I 
observe 
that 
they 
may 
all 
be 
referred 
to 
two 
principles, 
of 
which 
one 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
mentioned, 
although 
it 
plays 
a 
large 
part 
in 
the 
dreams 
of 
human 
beings. 
One 
of 
the 
motives 
inspiring 
these 
dreams 
is 
the 
wish 
that 
I 
should 
appear 
in 
the 
wrong. 
These 
dreams 
regularly 
occur 
in 
the 
course 
of 
my 
treatment 
if 
the 
patient 
shows 
a 
resistance 
against 
me, 
and 
I 
can 
count 
with 
a 
large 
degree 
of 
certainty 
upon 
causing 
such 
a 
dream 
after 
I 
have 
once 
explained 
to 
the 
patient 
my 
theory 
that 
the 
dream 
is 
a 
wish-fulfillment.[5] 
I 
may 
even 
expect 
this 
to 
be 
the 
case 
in 
a 
dream 
merely 
in 
order 
to 
fulfill 
the 
wish 
that 
I 
may 
appear 
in 
the 
wrong. 
The 
last 
dream 
which 
I 
shall 
tell 
from 
those 
occurring 
in 
the 
course 
of 
treatment 
again 
shows 
this 
very 
thing. 
A 
young 
girl 
who 
has 
struggled 
hard 
to 
continue 
my 
treatment, 
against 
the 
will 
of 
her 
relatives 
and 
the 
authorities 
whom 
she 
had 
consulted, 
dreams 
as 
follows: 
_She 
is 
forbidden 
at 
home 
to 
come 
to 
me 
any 
more. 
She 
then 
reminds 
me 
of 
the 
promise 
I 
made 
her 
to 
treat 
her 
for 
nothing 
if 
necessary, 
and 
I 
say 
to 
her: 
"I 
can 
show 
no 
consideration 
in 
money 
matters."_ 


It 
is 
not 
at 
all 
easy 
in 
this 
case 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
a 
wish, 
but 
in 
all 
cases 
of 
this 
kind 
there 
is 
a 
second 
problem, 
the 
solution 
of 
which 
helps 
also 
to 
solve 
the 
first. 
Where 
does 
she 
get 
the 
words 
which 
she 
puts 
into 
my 
mouth? 
Of 
course 
I 
have 
never 
told 
her 
anything 
like 
that, 
but 
one 
of 
her 
brothers, 
the 
very 
one 
who 
has 
the 
greatest 
influence 
over 
her, 
has 
been 
kind 
enough 
to 
make 
this 
remark 
about 
me. 
It 
is 
then 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
dream 
that 
this 
brother 
should 
remain 
in 
the 
right; 
and 
she 
does 
not 
try 
to 
justify 
this 
brother 
merely 
in 
the 
dream; 
it 
is 
her 
purpose 
in 
life 
and 
the 
motive 
for 
her 
being 
ill. 


The 
other 
motive 
for 
counter 
wish-dreams 
is 
so 
clear 
that 
there 
is 
danger 
of 
overlooking 
it, 
as 
for 
some 
time 
happened 
in 
my 
own 
case. 
In 
the 
sexual 
make-up 
of 
many 
people 
there 
is 
a 
masochistic 
component, 
which 
has 
arisen 
through 
the 
conversion 
of 
the 
aggressive, 
sadistic 
component 
into 
its 
opposite. 
Such 
people 
are 
called 
"ideal" 
masochists, 
if 
they 
seek 
pleasure 
not 
in 
the 
bodily 
pain 
which 
may 
be 
inflicted 
upon 
them, 
but 
in 
humiliation 
and 
in 
chastisement 
of 
the 
soul. 
It 
is 
obvious 
that 
such 
persons 
can 
have 
counter 
wish-dreams 
and 
disagreeable 
dreams, 
which, 
however, 
for 
them 
are 
nothing 
but 
wish-fulfillment, 
affording 
satisfaction 
for 
their 
masochistic 
inclinations. 



Here 
is 
such 
a 
dream. 
A 
young 
man, 
who 
has 
in 
earlier 
years 
tormented 
his 
elder 
brother, 
towards 
whom 
he 
was 
homosexually 
inclined, 
but 
who 
had 
undergone 
a 
complete 
change 
of 
character, 
has 
the 
following 
dream, 
which 
consists 
of 
three 
parts: 
(1) 
_He 
is 
"insulted" 
by 
his 
brother._ 
(2) 
_Two 
adults 
are 
caressing 
each 
other 
with 
homosexual 
intentions._ 
(3) 
_His 
brother 
has 
sold 
the 
enterprise 
whose 
management 
the 
young 
man 
reserved 
for 
his 
own 
future._ 
He 
awakens 
from 
the 
last-mentioned 
dream 
with 
the 
most 
unpleasant 
feelings, 
and 
yet 
it 
is 
a 
masochistic 
wish-dream, 
which 
might 
be 
translated: 
It 
would 
serve 
me 
quite 
right 
if 
my 
brother 
were 
to 
make 
that 
sale 
against 
my 
interest, 
as 
a 
punishment 
for 
all 
the 
torments 
which 
he 
has 
suffered 
at 
my 
hands. 


I 
hope 
that 
the 
above 
discussion 
and 
examples 
will 
suffice--until 
further 
objection 
can 
be 
raised--to 
make 
it 
seem 
credible 
that 
even 
dreams 
with 
a 
painful 
content 
are 
to 
be 
analyzed 
as 
the 
fulfillments 
of 
wishes. 
Nor 
will 
it 
seem 
a 
matter 
of 
chance 
that 
in 
the 
course 
of 
interpretation 
one 
always 
happens 
upon 
subjects 
of 
which 
one 
does 
not 
like 
to 
speak 
or 
think. 
The 
disagreeable 
sensation 
which 
such 
dreams 
arouse 
is 
simply 
identical 
with 
the 
antipathy 
which 
endeavors--usually 
with 
success--to 
restrain 
us 
from 
the 
treatment 
or 
discussion 
of 
such 
subjects, 
and 
which 
must 
be 
overcome 
by 
all 
of 
us, 
if, 
in 
spite 
of 
its 
unpleasantness, 
we 
find 
it 
necessary 
to 
take 
the 
matter 
in 
hand. 
But 
this 
disagreeable 
sensation, 
which 
occurs 
also 
in 
dreams, 
does 
not 
preclude 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
wish; 
every 
one 
has 
wishes 
which 
he 
would 
not 
like 
to 
tell 
to 
others, 
which 
he 
does 
not 
want 
to 
admit 
even 
to 
himself. 
We 
are, 
on 
other 
grounds, 
justified 
in 
connecting 
the 
disagreeable 
character 
of 
all 
these 
dreams 
with 
the 
fact 
of 
dream 
disfigurement, 
and 
in 
concluding 
that 
these 
dreams 
are 
distorted, 
and 
that 
the 
wish-fulfillment 
in 
them 
is 
disguised 
until 
recognition 
is 
impossible 
for 
no 
other 
reason 
than 
that 
a 
repugnance, 
a 
will 
to 
suppress, 
exists 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
subject-matter 
of 
the 
dream 
or 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
wish 
which 
the 
dream 
creates. 
Dream 
disfigurement, 
then, 
turns 
out 
in 
reality 
to 
be 
an 
act 
of 
the 
censor. 
We 
shall 
take 
into 
consideration 
everything 
which 
the 
analysis 
of 
disagreeable 
dreams 
has 
brought 
to 
light 
if 
we 
reword 
our 
formula 
as 
follows: 
_The 
dream 
is 
the 
(disguised) 
fulfillment 
of 
a 
(suppressed, 
repressed) 
wish_. 


Now 
there 
still 
remain 
as 
a 
particular 
species 
of 
dreams 
with 
painful 
content, 
dreams 
of 
anxiety, 
the 
inclusion 
of 
which 
under 
dreams 
of 
wishing 
will 
find 
least 
acceptance 
with 
the 
uninitiated. 
But 
I 
can 
settle 
the 
problem 
of 
anxiety 



dreams 
in 
very 
short 
order; 
for 
what 
they 
may 
reveal 
is 
not 
a 
new 
aspect 
of 
the 
dream 
problem; 
it 
is 
a 
question 
in 
their 
case 
of 
understanding 
neurotic 
anxiety 
in 
general. 
The 
fear 
which 
we 
experience 
in 
the 
dream 
is 
only 
seemingly 
explained 
by 
the 
dream 
content. 
If 
we 
subject 
the 
content 
of 
the 
dream 
to 
analysis, 
we 
become 
aware 
that 
the 
dream 
fear 
is 
no 
more 
justified 
by 
the 
dream 
content 
than 
the 
fear 
in 
a 
phobia 
is 
justified 
by 
the 
idea 
upon 
which 
the 
phobia 
depends. 
For 
example, 
it 
is 
true 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
fall 
out 
of 
a 
window, 
and 
that 
some 
care 
must 
be 
exercised 
when 
one 
is 
near 
a 
window, 
but 
it 
is 
inexplicable 
why 
the 
anxiety 
in 
the 
corresponding 
phobia 
is 
so 
great, 
and 
why 
it 
follows 
its 
victims 
to 
an 
extent 
so 
much 
greater 
than 
is 
warranted 
by 
its 
origin. 
The 
same 
explanation, 
then, 
which 
applies 
to 
the 
phobia 
applies 
also 
to 
the 
dream 
of 
anxiety. 
In 
both 
cases 
the 
anxiety 
is 
only 
superficially 
attached 
to 
the 
idea 
which 
accompanies 
it 
and 
comes 
from 
another 
source. 


On 
account 
of 
the 
intimate 
relation 
of 
dream 
fear 
to 
neurotic 
fear, 
discussion 
of 
the 
former 
obliges 
me 
to 
refer 
to 
the 
latter. 
In 
a 
little 
essay 
on 
"The 
Anxiety 
Neurosis,"[6] 
I 
maintained 
that 
neurotic 
fear 
has 
its 
origin 
in 
the 
sexual 
life, 
and 
corresponds 
to 
a 
libido 
which 
has 
been 
turned 
away 
from 
its 
object 
and 
has 
not 
succeeded 
in 
being 
applied. 
From 
this 
formula, 
which 
has 
since 
proved 
its 
validity 
more 
and 
more 
clearly, 
we 
may 
deduce 
the 
conclusion 
that 
the 
content 
of 
anxiety 
dreams 
is 
of 
a 
sexual 
nature, 
the 
libido 
belonging 
to 
which 
content 
has 
been 
transformed 
into 
fear.

To 
sit 
for 
the 
painter. 
Goethe: 
"And 
if 
he 
has 
no 
backside, 
how 
can 
the 
nobleman 
sit?" 
[2] 
I 
myself 
regret 
the 
introduction 
of 
such 
passages 
from 
the 
psychopathology 
of 
hysteria, 
which, 
because 
of 
their 
fragmentary 
representation 
and 
of 
being 
torn 
from 
all 
connection 
with 
the 
subject, 
cannot 
have 
a 
very 
enlightening 
influence. 
If 
these 
passages 
are 
capable 
of 
throwing 
light 
upon 
the 
intimate 
relations 
between 
the 
dream 
and 
the 
psychoneuroses, 
they 
have 
served 
the 
purpose 
for 
which 
I 
have 
taken 
them 
up. 
[3] 
Something 
like 
the 
smoked 
salmon 
in 
the 
dream 
of 
the 
deferred 
supper. 
[4] 
It 
often 
happens 
that 
a 
dream 
is 
told 
incompletely, 
and 
that 
a 
recollection 
of 
the 
omitted 
portions 
appear 
only 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
analysis. 
These 
portions 
subsequently 
fitted 
in, 
regularly 
furnish 
the 
key 
to 
the 
interpretation. 

_Cf._ 
below, 
about 
forgetting 
in 
dreams. 


[5] 
Similar 
"counter 
wish-dreams" 
have 
been 
repeatedly 
reported 
to 
me 
within 
the 
last 
few 
years 
by 
my 
pupils 
who 
thus 
reacted 
to 
their 
first 
encounter 
with 
the 
"wish 
theory 
of 
the

SEX 
IN 
DREAMS 


The 
more 
one 
is 
occupied 
with 
the 
solution 
of 
dreams, 
the 
more 
willing 
one 
must 
become 
to 
acknowledge 
that 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
dreams 
of 
adults 
treat 
of 
sexual 
material 
and 
give 
expression 
to 
erotic 
wishes. 
Only 
one 
who 
really 
analyzes 
dreams, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
who 
pushes 
forward 
from 
their 
manifest 
content 
to 
the 
latent 
dream 
thoughts, 
can 
form 
an 
opinion 
on 
this 
subject-never 
the 
person 
who 
is 
satisfied 
with 
registering 
the 
manifest 
content 
(as, 
for 
example, 
Näcke 
in 
his 
works 
on 
sexual 
dreams). 
Let 
us 
recognize 
at 
once 
that 
this 
fact 
is 
not 
to 
be 
wondered 
at, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
in 
complete 
harmony 
with 
the 
fundamental 
assumptions 
of 
dream 
explanation. 
No 
other 
impulse 
has 
had 
to 
undergo 
so 
much 
suppression 
from 
the 
time 
of 
childhood 
as 
the 
sex 
impulse 
in 
its 
numerous 
components, 
from 
no 
other 
impulse 
have 
survived 
so 
many 
and 
such 
intense 
unconscious 
wishes, 
which 
now 
act 
in 
the 
sleeping 
state 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
as 
to 
produce 
dreams. 
In 
dream 
interpretation, 
this 
significance 
of 
sexual 
complexes 
must 
never 
be 
forgotten, 
nor 
must 
they, 
of 
course, 
be 
exaggerated 
to 
the 
point 
of 
being 
considered 
exclusive. 


Of 
many 
dreams 
it 
can 
be 
ascertained 
by 
a 
careful 
interpretation 
that 
they 
are 
even 
to 
be 
taken 
bisexually, 
inasmuch 
as 
they 
result 
in 
an 
irrefutable 
secondary 
interpretation 
in 
which 
they 
realize 
homosexual 
feelings--that 
is, 
feelings 
that 
are 
common 
to 
the 
normal 
sexual 
activity 
of 
the 
dreaming 
person. 
But 
that 
all 
dreams 
are 
to 
be 
interpreted 
bisexually, 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
be 
a 
generalization 
as 
indemonstrable 
as 
it 
is 
improbable, 
which 
I 
should 
not 
like 
to 
support. 
Above 
all 
I 
should 
not 
know 
how 
to 
dispose 
of 
the 
apparent 
fact 
that 
there 
are 
many 
dreams 
satisfying 
other 
than--in 
the 
widest 
sense--erotic 
needs, 
as 
dreams 
of 
hunger, 
thirst, 
convenience, 
&c. 
Likewise 
the 
similar 
assertions 
"that 
behind 
every 
dream 
one 
finds 
the 
death 
sentence" 
(Stekel), 
and 
that 
every 
dream 
shows 
"a 
continuation 
from 
the 
feminine 
to 
the 
masculine 
line" 
(Adler), 
seem 
to 
me 
to 
proceed 
far 
beyond 
what 
is 
admissible 
in 
the 
interpretation 
of 
dreams. 


We 
have 
already 
asserted 
elsewhere 
that 
dreams 
which 
are 
conspicuously 
innocent 
invariably 
embody 
coarse 
erotic 
wishes, 
and 
we 
might 
confirm 
this 
by 
means 
of 
numerous 
fresh 
examples. 
But 
many 
dreams 
which 
appear 
indifferent, 
and 
which 
would 
never 
be 
suspected 
of 
any 
particular 



significance, 
can 
be 
traced 
back, 
after 
analysis, 
to 
unmistakably 
sexual 
wish-
feelings, 
which 
are 
often 
of 
an 
unexpected 
nature. 
For 
example, 
who 
would 
suspect 
a 
sexual 
wish 
in 
the 
following 
dream 
until 
the 
interpretation 
had 
been 
worked 
out? 
The 
dreamer 
relates: 
_Between 
two 
stately 
palaces 
stands 
a 
little 
house, 
receding 
somewhat, 
whose 
doors 
are 
closed. 
My 
wife 
leads 
me 
a 
little 
way 
along 
the 
street 
up 
to 
the 
little 
house, 
and 
pushes 
in 
the 
door, 
and 
then 
I 
slip 
quickly 
and 
easily 
into 
the 
interior 
of 
a 
courtyard 
that 
slants 
obliquely 
upwards._ 


Any 
one 
who 
has 
had 
experience 
in 
the 
translating 
of 
dreams 
will, 
of 
course, 
immediately 
perceive 
that 
penetrating 
into 
narrow 
spaces, 
and 
opening 
locked 
doors, 
belong 
to 
the 
commonest 
sexual 
symbolism, 
and 
will 
easily 
find 
in 
this 
dream 
a 
representation 
of 
attempted 
coition 
from 
behind 
(between 
the 
two 
stately 
buttocks 
of 
the 
female 
body). 
The 
narrow 
slanting 
passage 
is 
of 
course 
the 
vagina; 
the 
assistance 
attributed 
to 
the 
wife 
of 
the 
dreamer 
requires 
the 
interpretation 
that 
in 
reality 
it 
is 
only 
consideration 
for 
the 
wife 
which 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
detention 
from 
such 
an 
attempt. 
Moreover, 
inquiry 
shows 
that 
on 
the 
previous 
day 
a 
young 
girl 
had 
entered 
the 
household 
of 
the 
dreamer 
who 
had 
pleased 
him, 
and 
who 
had 
given 
him 
the 
impression 
that 
she 
would 
not 
be 
altogether 
opposed 
to 
an 
approach 
of 
this 
sort. 
The 
little 
house 
between 
the 
two 
palaces 
is 
taken 
from 
a 
reminiscence 
of 
the 
Hradschin 
in 
Prague, 
and 
thus 
points 
again 
to 
the 
girl 
who 
is 
a 
native 
of 
that 
city. 


If 
with 
my 
patients 
I 
emphasize 
the 
frequency 
of 
the 
Oedipus 
dream--of 
having 
sexual 
intercourse 
with 
one's 
mother--I 
get 
the 
answer: 
"I 
cannot 
remember 
such 
a 
dream." 
Immediately 
afterwards, 
however, 
there 
arises 
the 
recollection 
of 
another 
disguised 
and 
indifferent 
dream, 
which 
has 
been 
dreamed 
repeatedly 
by 
the 
patient, 
and 
the 
analysis 
shows 
it 
to 
be 
a 
dream 
of 
this 
same 
content--that 
is, 
another 
Oedipus 
dream. 
I 
can 
assure 
the 
reader 
that 
veiled 
dreams 
of 
sexual 
intercourse 
with 
the 
mother 
are 
a 
great 
deal 
more 
frequent 
than 
open 
ones 
to 
the 
same 
effect. 


There 
are 
dreams 
about 
landscapes 
and 
localities 
in 
which 
emphasis 
is 
always 
laid 
upon 
the 
assurance: 
"I 
have 
been 
there 
before." 
In 
this 
case 
the 
locality 
is 
always 
the 
genital 
organ 
of 
the 
mother; 
it 
can 
indeed 
be 
asserted 
with 
such 
certainty 
of 
no 
other 
locality 
that 
one 
"has 
been 
there 
before." 


A 
large 
number 
of 
dreams, 
often 
full 
of 
fear, 
which 
are 
concerned 
with 



passing 
through 
narrow 
spaces 
or 
with 
staying, 
in 
the 
water, 
are 
based 
upon 
fancies 
about 
the 
embryonic 
life, 
about 
the 
sojourn 
in 
the 
mother's 
womb, 
and 
about 
the 
act 
of 
birth. 
The 
following 
is 
the 
dream 
of 
a 
young 
man 
who 
in 
his 
fancy 
has 
already 
while 
in 
embryo 
taken 
advantage 
of 
his 
opportunity 
to 
spy 
upon 
an 
act 
of 
coition 
between 
his 
parents. 


_"He 
is 
in 
a 
deep 
shaft, 
in 
which 
there 
is 
a 
window, 
as 
in 
the 
Semmering 
Tunnel. 
At 
first 
he 
sees 
an 
empty 
landscape 
through 
this 
window, 
and 
then 
he 
composes 
a 
picture 
into 
it, 
which 
is 
immediately 
at 
hand 
and 
which 
fills 
out 
the 
empty 
space. 
The 
picture 
represents 
a 
field 
which 
is 
being 
thoroughly 
harrowed 
by 
an 
implement, 
and 
the 
delightful 
air, 
the 
accompanying 
idea 
of 
hard 
work, 
and 
the 
bluish-black 
clods 
of 
earth 
make 
a 
pleasant 
impression. 
He 
then 
goes 
on 
and 
sees 
a 
primary 
school 
opened 
... 
and 
he 
is 
surprised 
that 
so 
much 
attention 
is 
devoted 
in 
it 
to 
the 
sexual 
feelings 
of 
the 
child, 
which 
makes 
him 
think 
of 
me."_ 


Here 
is 
a 
pretty 
water-dream 
of 
a 
female 
patient, 
which 
was 
turned 
to 
extraordinary 
account 
in 
the 
course 
of 
treatment. 


_At 
her 
summer 
resort 
at 
the 
... 
Lake, 
she 
hurls 
herself 
into 
the 
dark 
water 
at 
a 
place 
where 
the 
pale 
moon 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
water._ 


Dreams 
of 
this 
sort 
are 
parturition 
dreams; 
their 
interpretation 
is 
accomplished 
by 
reversing 
the 
fact 
reported 
in 
the 
manifest 
dream 
content; 
thus, 
instead 
of 
"throwing 
one's 
self 
into 
the 
water," 
read 
"coming 
out 
of 
the 
water," 
that 
is, 
"being 
born." 
The 
place 
from 
which 
one 
is 
born 
is 
recognized 
if 
one 
thinks 
of 
the 
bad 
sense 
of 
the 
French 
"la 
lune." 
The 
pale 
moon 
thus 
becomes 
the 
white 
"bottom" 
(Popo), 
which 
the 
child 
soon 
recognizes 
as 
the 
place 
from 
which 
it 
came. 
Now 
what 
can 
be 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
patient's 
wishing 
to 
be 
born 
at 
her 
summer 
resort? 
I 
asked 
the 
dreamer 
this, 
and 
she 
answered 
without 
hesitation: 
"Hasn't 
the 
treatment 
made 
me 
as 
though 
I 
were 
born 
again?" 
Thus 
the 
dream 
becomes 
an 
invitation 
to 
continue 
the 
cure 
at 
this 
summer 
resort, 
that 
is, 
to 
visit 
her 
there; 
perhaps 
it 
also 
contains 
a 
very 
bashful 
allusion 
to 
the 
wish 
to 
become 
a 
mother 
herself.[1] 


Another 
dream 
of 
parturition, 
with 
its 
interpretation, 
I 
take 
from 
the 
work 
of 


E. 
Jones. 
_"She 
stood 
at 
the 
seashore 
watching 
a 
small 
boy, 
who 
seemed 
to 
be 
hers, 
wading 
into 
the 
water. 
This 
he 
did 
till 
the 
water 
covered 
him, 
and 
she 
could 
only 
see 
his 
head 
bobbing 
up 
and 
down 
near 
the 
surface. 
The 
scene 

then 
changed 
to 
the 
crowded 
hall 
of 
a 
hotel. 
Her 
husband 
left 
her, 
and 
she 
'entered 
into 
conversation 
with' 
a 
stranger."_ 
The 
second 
half 
of 
the 
dream 
was 
discovered 
in 
the 
analysis 
to 
represent 
a 
flight 
from 
her 
husband, 
and 
the 
entering 
into 
intimate 
relations 
with 
a 
third 
person, 
behind 
whom 
was 
plainly 
indicated 
Mr. 
X.'s 
brother 
mentioned 
in 
a 
former 
dream. 
The 
first 
part 
of 
the 
dream 
was 
a 
fairly 
evident 
birth 
phantasy. 
In 
dreams 
as 
in 
mythology, 
the 
delivery 
of 
a 
child 
from 
the 
uterine 
waters 
is 
commonly 
presented 
by 
distortion 
as 
the 
entry 
of 
the 
child 
into 
water; 
among 
many 
others, 
the 
births 
of 
Adonis, 
Osiris, 
Moses, 
and 
Bacchus 
are 
well-known 
illustrations 
of 
this. 
The 
bobbing 
up 
and 
down 
of 
the 
head 
in 
the 
water 
at 
once 
recalled 
to 
the 
patient 
the 
sensation 
of 
quickening 
she 
had 
experienced 
in 
her 
only 
pregnancy. 
Thinking 
of 
the 
boy 
going 
into 
the 
water 
induced 
a 
reverie 
in 
which 
she 
saw 
herself 
taking 
him 
out 
of 
the 
water, 
carrying 
him 
into 
the 
nursery, 
washing 
him 
and 
dressing 
him, 
and 
installing 
him 
in 
her 
household. 


The 
second 
half 
of 
the 
dream, 
therefore, 
represents 
thoughts 
concerning 
the 
elopement, 
which 
belonged 
to 
the 
first 
half 
of 
the 
underlying 
latent 
content; 
the 
first 
half 
of 
the 
dream 
corresponded 
with 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
latent 
content, 
the 
birth 
phantasy. 
Besides 
this 
inversion 
in 
order, 
further 
inversions 
took 
place 
in 
each 
half 
of 
the 
dream. 
In 
the 
first 
half 
the 
child 
entered 
the 
water, 
and 
then 
his 
head 
bobbed; 
in 
the 
underlying 
dream 
thoughts 
first 
the 
quickening 
occurred, 
and 
then 
the 
child 
left 
the 
water 
(a 
double 
inversion). 
In 
the 
second 
half 
her 
husband 
left 
her; 
in 
the 
dream 
thoughts 
she 
left 
her 
husband. 


Another 
parturition 
dream 
is 
related 
by 
Abraham 
of 
a 
young 
woman 
looking 
forward 
to 
her 
first 
confinement. 
From 
a 
place 
in 
the 
floor 
of 
the 
house 
a 
subterranean 
canal 
leads 
directly 
into 
the 
water 
(parturition 
path, 
amniotic 
liquor). 
She 
lifts 
up 
a 
trap 
in 
the 
floor, 
and 
there 
immediately 
appears 
a 
creature 
dressed 
in 
a 
brownish 
fur, 
which 
almost 
resembles 
a 
seal. 
This 
creature 
changes 
into 
the 
younger 
brother 
of 
the 
dreamer, 
to 
whom 
she 
has 
always 
stood 
in 
maternal 
relationship. 


Dreams 
of 
"saving" 
are 
connected 
with 
parturition 
dreams. 
To 
save, 
especially 
to 
save 
from 
the 
water, 
is 
equivalent 
to 
giving 
birth 
when 
dreamed 
by 
a 
woman; 
this 
sense 
is, 
however, 
modified 
when 
the 
dreamer 
is 
a 
man. 


Robbers, 
burglars 
at 
night, 
and 
ghosts, 
of 
which 
we 
are 
afraid 
before 
going 
to 



bed, 
and 
which 
occasionally 
even 
disturb 
our 
sleep, 
originate 
in 
one 
and 
the 
same 
childish 
reminiscence. 
They 
are 
the 
nightly 
visitors 
who 
have 
awakened 
the 
child 
to 
set 
it 
on 
the 
chamber 
so 
that 
it 
may 
not 
wet 
the 
bed, 
or 
have 
lifted 
the 
cover 
in 
order 
to 
see 
clearly 
how 
the 
child 
is 
holding 
its 
hands 
while 
sleeping. 
I 
have 
been 
able 
to 
induce 
an 
exact 
recollection 
of 
the 
nocturnal 
visitor 
in 
the 
analysis 
of 
some 
of 
these 
anxiety 
dreams. 
The 
robbers 
were 
always 
the 
father, 
the 
ghosts 
more 
probably 
corresponded 
to 
feminine 
persons 
with 
white 
night-gowns. 


When 
one 
has 
become 
familiar 
with 
the 
abundant 
use 
of 
symbolism 
for 
the 
representation 
of 
sexual 
material 
in 
dreams, 
one 
naturally 
raises 
the 
question 
whether 
there 
are 
not 
many 
of 
these 
symbols 
which 
appear 
once 
and 
for 
all 
with 
a 
firmly 
established 
significance 
like 
the 
signs 
in 
stenography; 
and 
one 
is 
tempted 
to 
compile 
a 
new 
dream-book 
according 
to 
the 
cipher 
method. 
In 
this 
connection 
it 
may 
be 
remarked 
that 
this 
symbolism 
does 
not 
belong 
peculiarly 
to 
the 
dream, 
but 
rather 
to 
unconscious 
thinking, 
particularly 
that 
of 
the 
masses, 
and 
it 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
greater 
perfection 
in 
the 
folklore, 
in 
the 
myths, 
legends, 
and 
manners 
of 
speech, 
in 
the 
proverbial 
sayings, 
and 
in 
the 
current 
witticisms 
of 
a 
nation 
than 
in 
its 
dreams. 


The 
dream 
takes 
advantage 
of 
this 
symbolism 
in 
order 
to 
give 
a 
disguised 
representation 
to 
its 
latent 
thoughts. 
Among 
the 
symbols 
which 
are 
used 
in 
this 
manner 
there 
are 
of 
course 
many 
which 
regularly, 
or 
almost 
regularly, 
mean 
the 
same 
thing. 
Only 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
keep 
in 
mind 
the 
curious 
plasticity 
of 
psychic 
material. 
Now 
and 
then 
a 
symbol 
in 
the 
dream 
content 
may 
have 
to 
be 
interpreted 
not 
symbolically, 
but 
according 
to 
its 
real 
meaning; 
at 
another 
time 
the 
dreamer, 
owing 
to 
a 
peculiar 
set 
of 
recollections, 
may 
create 
for 
himself 
the 
right 
to 
use 
anything 
whatever 
as 
a 
sexual 
symbol, 
though 
it 
is 
not 
ordinarily 
used 
in 
that 
way. 
Nor 
are 
the 
most 
frequently 
used 
sexual 
symbols 
unambiguous 
every 
time. 


After 
these 
limitations 
and 
reservations 
I 
may 
call 
attention 
to 
the 
following: 
Emperor 
and 
Empress 
(King 
and 
Queen) 
in 
most 
cases 
really 
represent 
the 
parents 
of 
the 
dreamer; 
the 
dreamer 
himself 
or 
herself 
is 
the 
prince 
or 
princess. 
All 
elongated 
objects, 
sticks, 
tree-trunks, 
and 
umbrellas 
(on 
account 
of 
the 
stretching-up 
which 
might 
be 
compared 
to 
an 
erection! 
all 
elongated 
and 
sharp 
weapons, 
knives, 
daggers, 
and 
pikes, 
are 
intended 
to 
represent 
the 
male 
member. 
A 
frequent, 
not 
very 
intelligible, 
symbol 
for 
the 
same 
is 
a 
nail



file 
(on 
account 
of 
the 
rubbing 
and 
scraping?). 
Little 
cases, 
boxes, 
caskets, 
closets, 
and 
stoves 
correspond 
to 
the 
female 
part. 
The 
symbolism 
of 
lock 
and 
key 
has 
been 
very 
gracefully 
employed 
by 
Uhland 
in 
his 
song 
about 
the 
"Grafen 
Eberstein," 
to 
make 
a 
common 
smutty 
joke. 
The 
dream 
of 
walking 
through 
a 
row 
of 
rooms 
is 
a 
brothel 
or 
harem 
dream. 
Staircases, 
ladders, 
and 
flights 
of 
stairs, 
or 
climbing 
on 
these, 
either 
upwards 
or 
downwards, 
are 
symbolic 
representations 
of 
the 
sexual 
act. 
Smooth 
walls 
over 
which 
one 
is 
climbing, 
façades 
of 
houses 
upon 
which 
one 
is 
letting 
oneself 
down, 
frequently 
under 
great 
anxiety, 
correspond 
to 
the 
erect 
human 
body, 
and 
probably 
repeat 
in 
the 
dream 
reminiscences 
of 
the 
upward 
climbing 
of 
little 
children 
on 
their 
parents 
or 
foster 
parents. 
"Smooth" 
walls 
are 
men. 
Often 
in 
a 
dream 
of 
anxiety 
one 
is 
holding 
on 
firmly 
to 
some 
projection 
from 
a 
house. 
Tables, 
set 
tables, 
and 
boards 
are 
women, 
perhaps 
on 
account 
of 
the 
opposition 
which 
does 
away 
with 
the 
bodily 
contours. 
Since 
"bed 
and 
board" 
(_mensa 
et 
thorus_) 
constitute 
marriage, 
the 
former 
are 
often 
put 
for 
the 
latter 
in 
the 
dream, 
and 
as 
far 
as 
practicable 
the 
sexual 
presentation 
complex 
is 
transposed 
to 
the 
eating 
complex. 
Of 
articles 
of 
dress 
the 
woman's 
hat 
may 
frequently 
be 
definitely 
interpreted 
as 
the 
male 
genital. 
In 
dreams 
of 
men 
one 
often 
finds 
the 
cravat 
as 
a 
symbol 
for 
the 
penis; 
this 
indeed 
is 
not 
only 
because 
cravats 
hang 
down 
long, 
and 
are 
characteristic 
of 
the 
man, 
but 
also 
because 
one 
can 
select 
them 
at 
pleasure, 
a 
freedom 
which 
is 
prohibited 
by 
nature 
in 
the 
original 
of 
the 
symbol. 
Persons 
who 
make 
use 
of 
this 
symbol 
in 
the 
dream 
are 
very 
extravagant 
with 
cravats, 
and 
possess 
regular 
collections 
of 
them. 
All 
complicated 
machines 
and 
apparatus 
in 
dream 
are 
very 
probably 
genitals, 
in 
the 
description 
of 
which 
dream 
symbolism 
shows 
itself 
to 
be 
as 
tireless 
as 
the 
activity 
of 
wit. 
Likewise 
many 
landscapes 
in 
dreams, 
especially 
with 
bridges 
or 
with 
wooded 
mountains, 
can 
be 
readily 
recognized 
as 
descriptions 
of 
the 
genitals. 
Finally 
where 
one 
finds 
incomprehensible 
neologisms 
one 
may 
think 
of 
combinations 
made 
up 
of 
components 
having 
a 
sexual 
significance. 
Children 
also 
in 
the 
dream 
often 
signify 
the 
genitals, 
as 
men 
and 
women 
are 
in 
the 
habit 
of 
fondly 
referring 
to 
their 
genital 
organ 
as 
their 
"little 
one." 
As 
a 
very 
recent 
symbol 
of 
the 
male 
genital 
may 
be 
mentioned 
the 
flying 
machine, 
utilization 
of 
which 
is 
justified 
by 
its 
relation 
to 
flying 
as 
well 
as 
occasionally 
by 
its 
form. 
To 
play 
with 
a 
little 
child 
or 
to 
beat 
a 
little 
one 
is 
often 
the 
dream's 
representation 
of 
onanism. 
A 
number 
of 
other 
symbols, 
in 
part 
not 
sufficiently 
verified 
are 
given 
by 
Stekel, 
who 
illustrates 
them 
with 
examples. 
Right 
and 
left, 
according 
to 
him, 
are 
to 
be 



conceived 
in 
the 
dream 
in 
an 
ethical 
sense. 
"The 
right 
way 
always 
signifies 
the 
road 
to 
righteousness, 
the 
left 
the 
one 
to 
crime. 
Thus 
the 
left 
may 
signify 
homosexuality, 
incest, 
and 
perversion, 
while 
the 
right 
signifies 
marriage, 
relations 
with 
a 
prostitute, 
&c. 
The 
meaning 
is 
always 
determined 
by 
the 
individual 
moral 
view-point 
of 
the 
dreamer." 
Relatives 
in 
the 
dream 
generally 
play 
the 
rôle 
of 
genitals. 
Not 
to 
be 
able 
to 
catch 
up 
with 
a 
wagon 
is 
interpreted 
by 
Stekel 
as 
regret 
not 
to 
be 
able 
to 
come 
up 
to 
a 
difference 
in 
age. 
Baggage 
with 
which 
one 
travels 
is 
the 
burden 
of 
sin 
by 
which 
one 
is 
oppressed. 
Also 
numbers, 
which 
frequently 
occur 
in 
the 
dream, 
are 
assigned 
by 
Stekel 
a 
fixed 
symbolical 
meaning, 
but 
these 
interpretations 
seem 
neither 
sufficiently 
verified 
nor 
of 
general 
validity, 
although 
the 
interpretation 
in 
individual 
cases 
can 
generally 
be 
recognized 
as 
probable. 
In 
a 
recently 
published 
book 
by 
W. 
Stekel, 
Die 
Sprache 
des 
Traumes, 
which 
I 
was 
unable 
to 
utilize, 
there 
is 
a 
list 
of 
the 
most 
common 
sexual 
symbols, 
the 
object 
of 
which 
is 
to 
prove 
that 
all 
sexual 
symbols 
can 
be 
bisexually 
used. 
He 
states: 
"Is 
there 
a 
symbol 
which 
(if 
in 
any 
way 
permitted 
by 
the 
phantasy) 
may 
not 
be 
used 
simultaneously 
in 
the 
masculine 
and 
the 
feminine 
sense!" 
To 
be 
sure 
the 
clause 
in 
parentheses 
takes 
away 
much 
of 
the 
absoluteness 
of 
this 
assertion, 
for 
this 
is 
not 
at 
all 
permitted 
by 
the 
phantasy. 
I 
do 
not, 
however, 
think 
it 
superfluous 
to 
state 
that 
in 
my 
experience 
Stekel's 
general 
statement 
has 
to 
give 
way 
to 
the 
recognition 
of 
a 
greater 
manifoldness. 
Besides 
those 
symbols, 
which 
are 
just 
as 
frequent 
for 
the 
male 
as 
for 
the 
female 
genitals, 
there 
are 
others 
which 
preponderately, 
or 
almost 
exclusively, 
designate 
one 
of 
the 
sexes, 
and 
there 
are 
still 
others 
of 
which 
only 
the 
male 
or 
only 
the 
female 
signification 
is 
known. 
To 
use 
long, 
firm 
objects 
and 
weapons 
as 
symbols 
of 
the 
female 
genitals, 
or 
hollow 
objects 
(chests, 
pouches, 
&c.), 
as 
symbols 
of 
the 
male 
genitals, 
is 
indeed 
not 
allowed 
by 
the 
fancy. 


It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
tendency 
of 
the 
dream 
and 
the 
unconscious 
fancy 
to 
utilize 
the 
sexual 
symbol 
bisexually 
betrays 
an 
archaic 
trend, 
for 
in 
childhood 
a 
difference 
in 
the 
genitals 
is 
unknown, 
and 
the 
same 
genitals 
are 
attributed 
to 
both 
sexes. 


These 
very 
incomplete 
suggestions 
may 
suffice 
to 
stimulate 
others 
to 
make 
a 
more 
careful 
collection. 


I 
shall 
now 
add 
a 
few 
examples 
of 
the 
application 
of 
such 
symbolisms 
in 
dreams, 
which 
will 
serve 
to 
show 
how 
impossible 
it 
becomes 
to 
interpret 
a 



dream 
without 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
symbolism 
of 
dreams, 
and 
how 
imperatively 
it 
obtrudes 
itself 
in 
many 
cases. 


1. 
The 
hat 
as 
a 
symbol 
of 
the 
man 
(of 
the 
male 
genital): 
(a 
fragment 
from 
the 
dream 
of 
a 
young 
woman 
who 
suffered 
from 
agoraphobia 
on 
account 
of 
a 
fear 
of 
temptation). 
"I 
am 
walking 
in 
the 
street 
in 
summer, 
I 
wear 
a 
straw 
hat 
of 
peculiar 
shape, 
the 
middle 
piece 
of 
which 
is 
bent 
upwards 
and 
the 
side 
pieces 
of 
which 
hang 
downwards 
(the 
description 
became 
here 
obstructed), 
and 
in 
such 
a 
fashion 
that 
one 
is 
lower 
than 
the 
other. 
I 
am 
cheerful 
and 
in 
a 
confidential 
mood, 
and 
as 
I 
pass 
a 
troop 
of 
young 
officers 
I 
think 
to 
myself: 
None 
of 
you 
can 
have 
any 
designs 
upon 
me." 


As 
she 
could 
produce 
no 
associations 
to 
the 
hat, 
I 
said 
to 
her: 
"The 
hat 
is 
really 
a 
male 
genital, 
with 
its 
raised 
middle 
piece 
and 
the 
two 
downward 
hanging 
side 
pieces." 
I 
intentionally 
refrained 
from 
interpreting 
those 
details 
concerning 
the 
unequal 
downward 
hanging 
of 
the 
two 
side 
pieces, 
although 
just 
such 
individualities 
in 
the 
determinations 
lead 
the 
way 
to 
the 
interpretation. 
I 
continued 
by 
saying 
that 
if 
she 
only 
had 
a 
man 
with 
such 
a 
virile 
genital 
she 
would 
not 
have 
to 
fear 
the 
officers--that 
is, 
she 
would 
have 
nothing 
to 
wish 
from 
them, 
for 
she 
is 
mainly 
kept 
from 
going 
without 
protection 
and 
company 
by 
her 
fancies 
of 
temptation. 
This 
last 
explanation 
of 
her 
fear 
I 
had 
already 
been 
able 
to 
give 
her 
repeatedly 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
other 
material. 


It 
is 
quite 
remarkable 
how 
the 
dreamer 
behaved 
after 
this 
interpretation. 
She 
withdrew 
her 
description 
of 
the 
hat, 
and 
claimed 
not 
to 
have 
said 
that 
the 
two 
side 
pieces 
were 
hanging 
downwards. 
I 
was, 
however, 
too 
sure 
of 
what 
I 
had 
heard 
to 
allow 
myself 
to 
be 
misled, 
and 
I 
persisted 
in 
it. 
She 
was 
quiet 
for 
a 
while, 
and 
then 
found 
the 
courage 
to 
ask 
why 
it 
was 
that 
one 
of 
her 
husband's 
testicles 
was 
lower 
than 
the 
other, 
and 
whether 
it 
was 
the 
same 
in 
all 
men. 
With 
this 
the 
peculiar 
detail 
of 
the 
hat 
was 
explained, 
and 
the 
whole 
interpretation 
was 
accepted 
by 
her. 
The 
hat 
symbol 
was 
familiar 
to 
me 
long 
before 
the 
patient 
related 
this 
dream. 
From 
other 
but 
less 
transparent 
cases 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
hat 
may 
also 
be 
taken 
as 
a 
female 
genital. 


2. 
The 
little 
one 
as 
the 
genital--to 
be 
run 
over 
as 
a 
symbol 
of 
sexual 
intercourse 
(another 
dream 
of 
the 
same 
agoraphobic 
patient). 

"Her 
mother 
sends 
away 
her 
little 
daughter 
so 
that 
she 
must 
go 
alone. 
She 
rides 
with 
her 
mother 
to 
the 
railroad 
and 
sees 
her 
little 
one 
walking 
directly 
upon 
the 
tracks, 
so 
that 
she 
cannot 
avoid 
being 
run 
over. 
She 
hears 
the 
bones 
crackle. 
(From 
this 
she 
experiences 
a 
feeling 
of 
discomfort 
but 
no 
real 
horror.) 
She 
then 
looks 
out 
through 
the 
car 
window 
to 
see 
whether 
the 
parts 
cannot 
be 
seen 
behind. 
She 
then 
reproaches 
her 
mother 
for 
allowing 
the 
little 
one 
to 
go 
out 
alone." 
Analysis. 
It 
is 
not 
an 
easy 
matter 
to 
give 
here 
a 
complete 
interpretation 
of 
the 
dream. 
It 
forms 
part 
of 
a 
cycle 
of 
dreams, 
and 
can 
be 
fully 
understood 
only 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
others. 
For 
it 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
get 
the 
necessary 
material 
sufficiently 
isolated 
to 
prove 
the 
symbolism. 
The 
patient 
at 
first 
finds 
that 
the 
railroad 
journey 
is 
to 
be 
interpreted 
historically 
as 
an 
allusion 
to 
a 
departure 
from 
a 
sanatorium 
for 
nervous 
diseases, 
with 
the 
superintendent 
of 
which 
she 
naturally 
was 
in 
love. 
Her 
mother 
took 
her 
away 
from 
this 
place, 
and 
the 
physician 
came 
to 
the 
railroad 
station 
and 
handed 
her 
a 
bouquet 
of 
flowers 
on 
leaving; 
she 
felt 
uncomfortable 
because 
her 
mother 
witnessed 
this 
homage. 
Here 
the 
mother, 
therefore, 
appears 
as 
a 
disturber 
of 
her 
love 
affairs, 
which 
is 
the 
rôle 
actually 
played 
by 
this 
strict 
woman 
during 
her 
daughter's 
girlhood. 
The 
next 
thought 
referred 
to 
the 
sentence: 
"She 
then 
looks 
to 
see 
whether 
the 
parts 
can 
be 
seen 
behind." 
In 
the 
dream 
façade 
one 
would 
naturally 
be 
compelled 
to 
think 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
little 
daughter 
run 
over 
and 
ground 
up. 
The 
thought, 
however, 
turns 
in 
quite 
a 
different 
direction. 
She 
recalls 
that 
she 
once 
saw 
her 
father 
in 
the 
bath-room 
naked 
from 
behind; 
she 
then 
begins 
to 
talk 
about 
the 
sex 
differentiation, 
and 
asserts 
that 
in 
the 
man 
the 
genitals 
can 
be 
seen 
from 
behind, 
but 
in 
the 
woman 
they 
cannot. 
In 
this 
connection 
she 
now 
herself 
offers 
the 
interpretation 
that 
the 
little 
one 
is 
the 
genital, 
her 
little 
one 
(she 
has 
a 
four-year-old 
daughter) 
her 
own 
genital. 
She 
reproaches 
her 
mother 
for 
wanting 
her 
to 
live 
as 
though 
she 
had 
no 
genital, 
and 
recognizes 
this 
reproach 
in 
the 
introductory 
sentence 
of 
the 
dream; 
the 
mother 
sends 
away 
her 
little 
one 
so 
that 
she 
must 
go 
alone. 
In 
her 
phantasy 
going 
alone 
on 
the 
street 
signifies 
to 
have 
no 
man 
and 
no 
sexual 
relations 
(coire 
= 
to 
go 
together), 
and 
this 
she 
does 
not 
like. 
According 
to 
all 
her 
statements 
she 
really 
suffered 
as 
a 
girl 
on 
account 
of 
the 
jealousy 
of 
her 
mother, 
because 
she 
showed 
a 
preference 
for 
her 
father. 


The 
"little 
one" 
has 
been 
noted 
as 
a 
symbol 
for 
the 
male 
or 
the 
female 
genitals 
by 
Stekel, 
who 
can 
refer 
in 
this 
connection 
to 
a 
very 
widespread 



usage 
of 
language. 


The 
deeper 
interpretation 
of 
this 
dream 
depends 
upon 
another 
dream 
of 
the 
same 
night 
in 
which 
the 
dreamer 
identifies 
herself 
with 
her 
brother. 
She 
was 
a 
"tomboy," 
and 
was 
always 
being 
told 
that 
she 
should 
have 
been 
born 
a 
boy. 
This 
identification 
with 
the 
brother 
shows 
with 
special 
clearness 
that 
"the 
little 
one" 
signifies 
the 
genital. 
The 
mother 
threatened 
him 
(her) 
with 
castration, 
which 
could 
only 
be 
understood 
as 
a 
punishment 
for 
playing 
with 
the 
parts, 
and 
the 
identification, 
therefore, 
shows 
that 
she 
herself 
had 
masturbated 
as 
a 
child, 
though 
this 
fact 
she 
now 
retained 
only 
in 
memory 
concerning 
her 
brother. 
An 
early 
knowledge 
of 
the 
male 
genital 
which 
she 
later 
lost 
she 
must 
have 
acquired 
at 
that 
time 
according 
to 
the 
assertions 
of 
this 
second 
dream. 
Moreover 
the 
second 
dream 
points 
to 
the 
infantile 
sexual 
theory 
that 
girls 
originate 
from 
boys 
through 
castration. 
After 
I 
had 
told 
her 
of 
this 
childish 
belief, 
she 
at 
once 
confirmed 
it 
with 
an 
anecdote 
in 
which 
the 
boy 
asks 
the 
girl: 
"Was 
it 
cut 
off?" 
to 
which 
the 
girl 
replied, 
"No, 
it's 
always 
been 
so." 


The 
sending 
away 
of 
the 
little 
one, 
of 
the 
genital, 
in 
the 
first 
dream 
therefore 
also 
refers 
to 
the 
threatened 
castration. 
Finally 
she 
blames 
her 
mother 
for 
not 
having 
been 
born 
a 
boy. 


That 
"being 
run 
over" 
symbolizes 
sexual 
intercourse 
would 
not 
be 
evident 
from 
this 
dream 
if 
we 
were 
not 
sure 
of 
it 
from 
many 
other 
sources. 


3. 
Representation 
of 
the 
genital 
by 
structures, 
stairways, 
and 
shafts. 
(Dream 
of 
a 
young 
man 
inhibited 
by 
a 
father 
complex.) 
"He 
is 
taking 
a 
walk 
with 
his 
father 
in 
a 
place 
which 
is 
surely 
the 
Prater, 
for 
the 
Rotunda 
may 
be 
seen 
in 
front 
of 
which 
there 
is 
a 
small 
front 
structure 
to 
which 
is 
attached 
a 
captive 
balloon; 
the 
balloon, 
however, 
seems 
quite 
collapsed. 
His 
father 
asks 
him 
what 
this 
is 
all 
for; 
he 
is 
surprised 
at 
it, 
but 
he 
explains 
it 
to 
his 
father. 
They 
come 
into 
a 
court 
in 
which 
lies 
a 
large 
sheet 
of 
tin. 
His 
father 
wants 
to 
pull 
off 
a 
big 
piece 
of 
this, 
but 
first 
looks 
around 
to 
see 
if 
any 
one 
is 
watching. 
He 
tells 
his 
father 
that 
all 
he 
needs 
to 
do 
is 
to 
speak 
to 
the 
watchman, 
and 
then 
he 
can 
take 
without 
any 
further 
difficulty 
as 
much 
as 
he 
wants 
to. 
From 
this 
court 
a 
stairway 
leads 
down 
into 
a 
shaft, 
the 
walls 
of 
which 
are 
softly 
upholstered 
something 
like 
a 
leather 
pocketbook. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
this 
shaft 
there 
is 
a 
longer 
platform, 
and 
then 
a 
new 
shaft 



begins...." 


Analysis. 
This 
dream 
belongs 
to 
a 
type 
of 
patient 
which 
is 
not 
favorable 
from 
a 
therapeutic 
point 
of 
view. 
They 
follow 
in 
the 
analysis 
without 
offering 
any 
resistances 
whatever 
up 
to 
a 
certain 
point, 
but 
from 
that 
point 
on 
they 
remain 
almost 
inaccessible. 
This 
dream 
he 
almost 
analyzed 
himself. 
"The 
Rotunda," 
he 
said, 
"is 
my 
genital, 
the 
captive 
balloon 
in 
front 
is 
my 
penis, 
about 
the 
weakness 
of 
which 
I 
have 
worried." 
We 
must, 
however, 
interpret 
in 
greater 
detail; 
the 
Rotunda 
is 
the 
buttock 
which 
is 
regularly 
associated 
by 
the 
child 
with 
the 
genital, 
the 
smaller 
front 
structure 
is 
the 
scrotum. 
In 
the 
dream 
his 
father 
asks 
him 
what 
this 
is 
all 
for--that 
is, 
he 
asks 
him 
about 
the 
purpose 
and 
arrangement 
of 
the 
genitals. 
It 
is 
quite 
evident 
that 
this 
state 
of 
affairs 
should 
be 
turned 
around, 
and 
that 
he 
should 
be 
the 
questioner. 
As 
such 
a 
questioning 
on 
the 
side 
of 
the 
father 
has 
never 
taken 
place 
in 
reality, 
we 
must 
conceive 
the 
dream 
thought 
as 
a 
wish, 
or 
take 
it 
conditionally, 
as 
follows: 
"If 
I 
had 
only 
asked 
my 
father 
for 
sexual 
enlightenment." 
The 
continuation 
of 
this 
thought 
we 
shall 
soon 
find 
in 
another 
place. 


The 
court 
in 
which 
the 
tin 
sheet 
is 
spread 
out 
is 
not 
to 
be 
conceived 
symbolically 
in 
the 
first 
instance, 
but 
originates 
from 
his 
father's 
place 
of 
business. 
For 
discretionary 
reasons 
I 
have 
inserted 
the 
tin 
for 
another 
material 
in 
which 
the 
father 
deals, 
without, 
however, 
changing 
anything 
in 
the 
verbal 
expression 
of 
the 
dream. 
The 
dreamer 
had 
entered 
his 
father's 
business, 
and 
had 
taken 
a 
terrible 
dislike 
to 
the 
questionable 
practices 
upon 
which 
profit 
mainly 
depends. 
Hence 
the 
continuation 
of 
the 
above 
dream 
thought 
("if 
I 
had 
only 
asked 
him") 
would 
be: 
"He 
would 
have 
deceived 
me 
just 
as 
he 
does 
his 
customers." 
For 
the 
pulling 
off, 
which 
serves 
to 
represent 
commercial 
dishonesty, 
the 
dreamer 
himself 
gives 
a 
second 
explanation--namely, 
onanism. 
This 
is 
not 
only 
entirely 
familiar 
to 
us, 
but 
agrees 
very 
well 
with 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
secrecy 
of 
onanism 
is 
expressed 
by 
its 
opposite 
("Why 
one 
can 
do 
it 
quite 
openly"). 
It, 
moreover, 
agrees 
entirely 
with 
our 
expectations 
that 
the 
onanistic 
activity 
is 
again 
put 
off 
on 
the 
father, 
just 
as 
was 
the 
questioning 
in 
the 
first 
scene 
of 
the 
dream. 
The 
shaft 
he 
at 
once 
interprets 
as 
the 
vagina 
by 
referring 
to 
the 
soft 
upholstering 
of 
the 
walls. 
That 
the 
act 
of 
coition 
in 
the 
vagina 
is 
described 
as 
a 
going 
down 
instead 
of 
in 
the 
usual 
way 
as 
a 
going 
up, 
I 
have 
also 
found 
true 
in 
other 
instances[2]. 


The 
details 
that 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
first 
shaft 
there 
is 
a 
longer 
platform 
and 
then 



a 
new 
shaft, 
he 
himself 
explains 
biographically. 
He 
had 
for 
some 
time 
consorted 
with 
women 
sexually, 
but 
had 
then 
given 
it 
up 
because 
of 
inhibitions 
and 
now 
hopes 
to 
be 
able 
to 
take 
it 
up 
again 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
treatment. 
The 
dream, 
however, 
becomes 
indistinct 
toward 
the 
end, 
and 
to 
the 
experienced 
interpreter 
it 
becomes 
evident 
that 
in 
the 
second 
scene 
of 
the 
dream 
the 
influence 
of 
another 
subject 
has 
begun 
to 
assert 
itself; 
in 
this 
his 
father's 
business 
and 
his 
dishonest 
practices 
signify 
the 
first 
vagina 
represented 
as 
a 
shaft 
so 
that 
one 
might 
think 
of 
a 
reference 
to 
the 
mother. 


4. 
The 
male 
genital 
symbolized 
by 
persons 
and 
the 
female 
by 
a 
landscape. 
(Dream 
of 
a 
woman 
of 
the 
lower 
class, 
whose 
husband 
is 
a 
policeman, 
reported 
by 
B. 
Dattner.) 


... 
Then 
some 
one 
broke 
into 
the 
house 
and 
anxiously 
called 
for 
a 
policeman. 
But 
he 
went 
with 
two 
tramps 
by 
mutual 
consent 
into 
a 
church,[3] 
to 
which 
led 
a 
great 
many 
stairs;[4] 
behind 
the 
church 
there 
was 
a 
mountain,[5] 
on 
top 
of 
which 
a 
dense 
forest.[6] 
The 
policeman 
was 
furnished 
with 
a 
helmet, 
a 
gorget, 
and 
a 
cloak.[7] 
The 
two 
vagrants, 
who 
went 
along 
with 
the 
policeman 
quite 
peaceably, 
had 
tied 
to 
their 
loins 
sack-like 
aprons.[8] 
A 
road 
led 
from 
the 
church 
to 
the 
mountain. 
This 
road 
was 
overgrown 
on 
each 
side 
with 
grass 
and 
brushwood, 
which 
became 
thicker 
and 
thicker 
as 
it 
reached 
the 
height 
of 
the 
mountain, 
where 
it 
spread 
out 
into 
quite 
a 
forest. 


5. 
A 
stairway 
dream. 
(Reported 
and 
interpreted 
by 
Otto 
Rank.) 


For 
the 
following 
transparent 
pollution 
dream, 
I 
am 
indebted 
to 
the 
same 
colleague 
who 
furnished 
us 
with 
the 
dental-irritation 
dream. 


"I 
am 
running 
down 
the 
stairway 
in 
the 
stair-house 
after 
a 
little 
girl, 
whom 
I 
wish 
to 
punish 
because 
she 
has 
done 
something 
to 
me. 
At 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
stairs 
some 
one 
held 
the 
child 
for 
me. 
(A 
grown-up 
woman?) 
I 
grasp 
it, 
but 
do 
not 
know 
whether 
I 
have 
hit 
it, 
for 
I 
suddenly 
find 
myself 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
stairway 
where 
I 
practice 
coitus 
with 
the 
child 
(in 
the 
air 
as 
it 
were). 
It 
is 
really 
no 
coitus, 
I 
only 
rub 
my 
genital 
on 
her 
external 
genital, 
and 
in 
doing 
this 
I 
see 
it 
very 
distinctly, 
as 
distinctly 
as 
I 
see 
her 
head 
which 
is 
lying 
sideways. 
During 
the 
sexual 
act 
I 
see 
hanging 
to 
the 
left 
and 
above 
me 
(also 



as 
if 
in 
the 
air) 
two 
small 
pictures, 
landscapes, 
representing 
a 
house 
on 
a 
green. 
On 
the 
smaller 
one 
my 
surname 
stood 
in 
the 
place 
where 
the 
painter's 
signature 
should 
be; 
it 
seemed 
to 
be 
intended 
for 
my 
birthday 
present. 
A 
small 
sign 
hung 
in 
front 
of 
the 
pictures 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
cheaper 
pictures 
could 
also 
be 
obtained. 
I 
then 
see 
myself 
very 
indistinctly 
lying 
in 
bed, 
just 
as 
I 
had 
seen 
myself 
at 
the 
foot 
of 
the 
stairs, 
and 
I 
am 
awakened 
by 
a 
feeling 
of 
dampness 
which 
came 
from 
the 
pollution." 


Interpretation. 
The 
dreamer 
had 
been 
in 
a 
book-store 
on 
the 
evening 
of 
the 
day 
of 
the 
dream, 
where, 
while 
he 
was 
waiting, 
he 
examined 
some 
pictures 
which 
were 
exhibited, 
which 
represented 
motives 
similar 
to 
the 
dream 
pictures. 
He 
stepped 
nearer 
to 
a 
small 
picture 
which 
particularly 
took 
his 
fancy 
in 
order 
to 
see 
the 
name 
of 
the 
artist, 
which, 
however, 
was 
quite 
unknown 
to 
him. 


Later 
in 
the 
same 
evening, 
in 
company, 
he 
heard 
about 
a 
Bohemian 
servant-
girl 
who 
boasted 
that 
her 
illegitimate 
child 
"was 
made 
on 
the 
stairs." 
The 
dreamer 
inquired 
about 
the 
details 
of 
this 
unusual 
occurrence, 
and 
learned 
that 
the 
servant-girl 
went 
with 
her 
lover 
to 
the 
home 
of 
her 
parents, 
where 
there 
was 
no 
opportunity 
for 
sexual 
relations, 
and 
that 
the 
excited 
man 
performed 
the 
act 
on 
the 
stairs. 
In 
witty 
allusion 
to 
the 
mischievous 
expression 
used 
about 
wine-adulterers, 
the 
dreamer 
remarked, 
"The 
child 
really 
grew 
on 
the 
cellar 
steps." 


These 
experiences 
of 
the 
day, 
which 
are 
quite 
prominent 
in 
the 
dream 
content, 
were 
readily 
reproduced 
by 
the 
dreamer. 
But 
he 
just 
as 
readily 
reproduced 
an 
old 
fragment 
of 
infantile 
recollection 
which 
was 
also 
utilized 
by 
the 
dream. 
The 
stair-house 
was 
the 
house 
in 
which 
he 
had 
spent 
the 
greatest 
part 
of 
his 
childhood, 
and 
in 
which 
he 
had 
first 
become 
acquainted 
with 
sexual 
problems. 
In 
this 
house 
he 
used, 
among 
other 
things, 
to 
slide 
down 
the 
banister 
astride 
which 
caused 
him 
to 
become 
sexually 
excited. 
In 
the 
dream 
he 
also 
comes 
down 
the 
stairs 
very 
rapidly--so 
rapidly 
that, 
according 
to 
his 
own 
distinct 
assertions, 
he 
hardly 
touched 
the 
individual 
stairs, 
but 
rather 
"flew" 
or 
"slid 
down," 
as 
we 
used 
to 
say. 
Upon 
reference 
to 
this 
infantile 
experience, 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
dream 
seems 
to 
represent 
the 
factor 
of 
sexual 
excitement. 
In 
the 
same 
house 
and 
in 
the 
adjacent 
residence 
the 
dreamer 
used 
to 
play 
pugnacious 
games 
with 
the 
neighboring 
children, 
in 
which 
he 
satisfied 
himself 
just 
as 
he 
did 
in 
the 
dream. 



If 
one 
recalls 
from 
Freud's 
investigation 
of 
sexual 
symbolism[9] 
that 
in 
the 
dream 
stairs 
or 
climbing 
stairs 
almost 
regularly 
symbolizes 
coitus, 
the 
dream 
becomes 
clear. 
Its 
motive 
power 
as 
well 
as 
its 
effect, 
as 
is 
shown 
by 
the 
pollution, 
is 
of 
a 
purely 
libidinous 
nature. 
Sexual 
excitement 
became 
aroused 
during 
the 
sleeping 
state 
(in 
the 
dream 
this 
is 
represented 
by 
the 
rapid 
running 
or 
sliding 
down 
the 
stairs) 
and 
the 
sadistic 
thread 
in 
this 
is, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
pugnacious 
playing, 
indicated 
in 
the 
pursuing 
and 
overcoming 
of 
the 
child. 
The 
libidinous 
excitement 
becomes 
enhanced 
and 
urges 
to 
sexual 
action 
(represented 
in 
the 
dream 
by 
the 
grasping 
of 
the 
child 
and 
the 
conveyance 
of 
it 
to 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
stairway). 
Up 
to 
this 
point 
the 
dream 
would 
be 
one 
of 
pure, 
sexual 
symbolism, 
and 
obscure 
for 
the 
unpracticed 
dream 
interpreter. 
But 
this 
symbolic 
gratification, 
which 
would 
have 
insured 
undisturbed 
sleep, 
was 
not 
sufficient 
for 
the 
powerful 
libidinous 
excitement. 
The 
excitement 
leads 
to 
an 
orgasm, 
and 
thus 
the 
whole 
stairway 
symbolism 
is 
unmasked 
as 
a 
substitute 
for 
coitus. 
Freud 
lays 
stress 
on 
the 
rhythmical 
character 
of 
both 
actions 
as 
one 
of 
the 
reasons 
for 
the 
sexual 
utilization 
of 
the 
stairway 
symbolism, 
and 
this 
dream 
especially 
seems 
to 
corroborate 
this, 
for, 
according 
to 
the 
express 
assertion 
of 
the 
dreamer, 
the 
rhythm 
of 
a 
sexual 
act 
was 
the 
most 
pronounced 
feature 
in 
the 
whole 
dream. 


Still 
another 
remark 
concerning 
the 
two 
pictures, 
which, 
aside 
from 
their 
real 
significance, 
also 
have 
the 
value 
of 
"Weibsbilder" 
(literally 
_womanpictures_, 
but 
idiomatically 
_women_). 
This 
is 
at 
once 
shown 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
dream 
deals 
with 
a 
big 
and 
a 
little 
picture, 
just 
as 
the 
dream 
content 
presents 
a 
big 
(grown 
up) 
and 
a 
little 
girl. 
That 
cheap 
pictures 
could 
also 
be 
obtained 
points 
to 
the 
prostitution 
complex, 
just 
as 
the 
dreamer's 
surname 
on 
the 
little 
picture 
and 
the 
thought 
that 
it 
was 
intended 
for 
his 
birthday, 
point 
to 
the 
parent 
complex 
(to 
be 
born 
on 
the 
stairway--to 
be 
conceived 
in 
coitus). 


The 
indistinct 
final 
scene, 
in 
which 
the 
dreamer 
sees 
himself 
on 
the 
staircase 
landing 
lying 
in 
bed 
and 
feeling 
wet, 
seems 
to 
go 
back 
into 
childhood 
even 
beyond 
the 
infantile 
onanism, 
and 
manifestly 
has 
its 
prototype 
in 
similarly 
pleasurable 
scenes 
of 
bed-wetting. 


6. 
A 
modified 
stair-dream. 
To 
one 
of 
my 
very 
nervous 
patients, 
who 
was 
an 
abstainer, 
whose 
fancy 
was 
fixed 
on 
his 
mother, 
and 
who 
repeatedly 
dreamed 
of 
climbing 
stairs 



accompanied 
by 
his 
mother, 
I 
once 
remarked 
that 
moderate 
masturbation 
would 
be 
less 
harmful 
to 
him 
than 
enforced 
abstinence. 
This 
influence 
provoked 
the 
following 
dream: 


"His 
piano 
teacher 
reproaches 
him 
for 
neglecting 
his 
piano-playing, 
and 
for 
not 
practicing 
the 
Etudes 
of 
Moscheles 
and 
Clementi's 
Gradus 
ad 
Parnassum." 
In 
relation 
to 
this 
he 
remarked 
that 
the 
Gradus 
is 
only 
a 
stairway, 
and 
that 
the 
piano 
itself 
is 
only 
a 
stairway 
as 
it 
has 
a 
scale. 


It 
is 
correct 
to 
say 
that 
there 
is 
no 
series 
of 
associations 
which 
cannot 
be 
adapted 
to 
the 
representation 
of 
sexual 
facts. 
I 
conclude 
with 
the 
dream 
of 
a 
chemist, 
a 
young 
man, 
who 
has 
been 
trying 
to 
give 
up 
his 
habit 
of 
masturbation 
by 
replacing 
it 
with 
intercourse 
with 
women. 


_Preliminary 
statement._--On 
the 
day 
before 
the 
dream 
he 
had 
given 
a 
student 
instruction 
concerning 
Grignard's 
reaction, 
in 
which 
magnesium 
is 
to 
be 
dissolved 
in 
absolutely 
pure 
ether 
under 
the 
catalytic 
influence 
of 
iodine. 
Two 
days 
before, 
there 
had 
been 
an 
explosion 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
same 
reaction, 
in 
which 
the 
investigator 
had 
burned 
his 
hand. 


Dream 
I. 
_He 
is 
to 
make 
phenylmagnesium-bromid; 
he 
sees 
the 
apparatus 
with 
particular 
clearness, 
but 
he 
has 
substituted 
himself 
for 
the 
magnesium. 
He 
is 
now 
in 
a 
curious 
swaying 
attitude. 
He 
keeps 
repeating 
to 
himself, 
"This 
is 
the 
right 
thing, 
it 
is 
working, 
my 
feet 
are 
beginning 
to 
dissolve 
and 
my 
knees 
are 
getting 
soft." 
Then 
he 
reaches 
down 
and 
feels 
for 
his 
feet, 
and 
meanwhile 
(he 
does 
not 
know 
how) 
he 
takes 
his 
legs 
out 
of 
the 
crucible, 
and 
then 
again 
he 
says 
to 
himself, 
"That 
cannot 
be.... 
Yes, 
it 
must 
be 
so, 
it 
has 
been 
done 
correctly." 
Then 
he 
partially 
awakens, 
and 
repeats 
the 
dream 
to 
himself, 
because 
he 
wants 
to 
tell 
it 
to 
me. 
He 
is 
distinctly 
afraid 
of 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
dream. 
He 
is 
much 
excited 
during 
this 
semi-sleeping 
state, 
and 
repeats 
continually, 
"Phenyl, 
phenyl."_ 


II. 
_He 
is 
in 
... 
ing 
with 
his 
whole 
family; 
at 
half-past 
eleven. 
He 
is 
to 
be 
at 
the 
Schottenthor 
for 
a 
rendezvous 
with 
a 
certain 
lady, 
but 
he 
does 
not 
wake 
up 
until 
half-past 
eleven. 
He 
says 
to 
himself, 
"It 
is 
too 
late 
now; 
when 
you 
get 
there 
it 
will 
be 
half-past 
twelve." 
The 
next 
instant 
he 
sees 
the 
whole 
family 
gathered 
about 
the 
table--his 
mother 
and 
the 
servant 
girl 
with 
the 
soup-tureen 
with 
particular 
clearness. 
Then 
he 
says 
to 
himself, 
"Well, 
if 
we 
are 
eating 
already, 
I 
certainly 
can't 
get 
away."_ 

Analysis: 
He 
feels 
sure 
that 
even 
the 
first 
dream 
contains 
a 
reference 
to 
the 
lady 
whom 
he 
is 
to 
meet 
at 
the 
rendezvous 
(the 
dream 
was 
dreamed 
during 
the 
night 
before 
the 
expected 
meeting). 
The 
student 
to 
whom 
he 
gave 
the 
instruction 
is 
a 
particularly 
unpleasant 
fellow; 
he 
had 
said 
to 
the 
chemist: 
"That 
isn't 
right," 
because 
the 
magnesium 
was 
still 
unaffected, 
and 
the 
latter 
answered 
as 
though 
he 
did 
not 
care 
anything 
about 
it: 
"It 
certainly 
isn't 
right." 
He 
himself 
must 
be 
this 
student; 
he 
is 
as 
indifferent 
towards 
his 
analysis 
as 
the 
student 
is 
towards 
his 
synthesis; 
the 
He 
in 
the 
dream, 
however, 
who 
accomplishes 
the 
operation, 
is 
myself. 
How 
unpleasant 
he 
must 
seem 
to 
me 
with 
his 
indifference 
towards 
the 
success 
achieved! 


Moreover, 
he 
is 
the 
material 
with 
which 
the 
analysis 
(synthesis) 
is 
made. 
For 
it 
is 
a 
question 
of 
the 
success 
of 
the 
treatment. 
The 
legs 
in 
the 
dream 
recall 
an 
impression 
of 
the 
previous 
evening. 
He 
met 
a 
lady 
at 
a 
dancing 
lesson 
whom 
he 
wished 
to 
conquer; 
he 
pressed 
her 
to 
him 
so 
closely 
that 
she 
once 
cried 
out. 
After 
he 
had 
stopped 
pressing 
against 
her 
legs, 
he 
felt 
her 
firm 
responding 
pressure 
against 
his 
lower 
thighs 
as 
far 
as 
just 
above 
his 
knees, 
at 
the 
place 
mentioned 
in 
the 
dream. 
In 
this 
situation, 
then, 
the 
woman 
is 
the 
magnesium 
in 
the 
retort, 
which 
is 
at 
last 
working. 
He 
is 
feminine 
towards 
me, 
as 
he 
is 
masculine 
towards 
the 
woman. 
If 
it 
will 
work 
with 
the 
woman, 
the 
treatment 
will 
also 
work. 
Feeling 
and 
becoming 
aware 
of 
himself 
in 
the 
region 
of 
his 
knees 
refers 
to 
masturbation, 
and 
corresponds 
to 
his 
fatigue 
of 
the 
previous 
day.... 
The 
rendezvous 
had 
actually 
been 
set 
for 
half-past 
eleven. 
His 
wish 
to 
oversleep 
and 
to 
remain 
with 
his 
usual 
sexual 
objects 
(that 
is, 
with 
masturbation) 
corresponds 
with 
his 
resistance. 


[1] 
It 
is 
only 
of 
late 
that 
I 
have 
learned 
to 
value 
the 
significance 
of 
fancies 
and 
unconscious 
thoughts 
about 
life 
in 
the 
womb. 
They 
contain 
the 
explanation 
of 
the 
curious 
fear 
felt 
by 
so 
many 
people 
of 
being 
buried 
alive, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
profoundest 
unconscious 
reason 
for 
the 
belief 
in 
a 
life 
after 
death 
which 
represents 
nothing 
but 
a 
projection 
into 
the 
future 
of 
this 
mysterious 
life 
before 
birth. 
_The 
act 
of 
birth, 
moreover, 
is 
the 
first 
experience 
with 
fear, 
and 
is 
thus 
the 
source 
and 
model 
of 
the 
emotion 
of 
fear._

THE 
WISH 
IN 
DREAMS 


That 
the 
dream 
should 
be 
nothing 
but 
a 
wish-fulfillment 
surely 
seemed 
strange 
to 
us 
all--and 
that 
not 
alone 
because 
of 
the 
contradictions 
offered 
by 
the 
anxiety 
dream. 


After 
learning 
from 
the 
first 
analytical 
explanations 
that 
the 
dream 
conceals 
sense 
and 
psychic 
validity, 
we 
could 
hardly 
expect 
so 
simple 
a 
determination 
of 
this 
sense. 
According 
to 
the 
correct 
but 
concise 
definition 
of 
Aristotle, 
the 
dream 
is 
a 
continuation 
of 
thinking 
in 
sleep 
(in 
so 
far 
as 
one 
sleeps). 
Considering 
that 
during 
the 
day 
our 
thoughts 
produce 
such 
a 
diversity 
of 
psychic 
acts--judgments, 
conclusions, 
contradictions, 
expectations, 
intentions, 
&c.--why 
should 
our 
sleeping 
thoughts 
be 
forced 
to 
confine 
themselves 
to 
the 
production 
of 
wishes? 
Are 
there 
not, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
many 
dreams 
that 
present 
a 
different 
psychic 
act 
in 
dream 
form, 
_e.g._, 
a 
solicitude, 
and 
is 
not 
the 
very 
transparent 
father's 
dream 
mentioned 
above 
of 
just 
such 
a 
nature? 
From 
the 
gleam 
of 
light 
falling 
into 
his 
eyes 
while 
asleep 
the 
father 
draws 
the 
solicitous 
conclusion 
that 
a 
candle 
has 
been 
upset 
and 
may 
have 
set 
fire 
to 
the 
corpse; 
he 
transforms 
this 
conclusion 
into 
a 
dream 
by 
investing 
it 
with 
a 
senseful 
situation 
enacted 
in 
the 
present 
tense. 
What 
part 
is 
played 
in 
this 
dream 
by 
the 
wish-fulfillment, 
and 
which 
are 
we 
to 
suspect--the 
predominance 
of 
the 
thought 
continued 
from, 
the 
waking 
state 
or 
of 
the 
thought 
incited 
by 
the 
new 
sensory 
impression? 


All 
these 
considerations 
are 
just, 
and 
force 
us 
to 
enter 
more 
deeply 
into 
the 
part 
played 
by 
the 
wish-fulfillment 
in 
the 
dream, 
and 
into 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
waking 
thoughts 
continued 
in 
sleep. 


It 
is 
in 
fact 
the 
wish-fulfillment 
that 
has 
already 
induced 
us 
to 
separate 
dreams 
into 
two 
groups. 
We 
have 
found 
some 
dreams 
that 
were 
plainly 
wish-
fulfillments; 
and 
others 
in 
which 
wish-fulfillment 
could 
not 
be 
recognized, 
and 
was 
frequently 
concealed 
by 
every 
available 
means. 
In 
this 
latter 
class 
of 
dreams 
we 
recognized 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
dream 
censor. 
The 
undisguised 
wish 
dreams 
were 
chiefly 
found 
in 
children, 
yet 
fleeting 
open-hearted 
wish 
dreams 
seemed 
(I 
purposely 
emphasize 
this 
word) 
to 
occur 
also 
in 
adults. 


We 
may 
now 
ask 
whence 
the 
wish 
fulfilled 
in 
the 
dream 
originates. 
But 
to 



what 
opposition 
or 
to 
what 
diversity 
do 
we 
refer 
this 
"whence"? 
I 
think 
it 
is 
to 
the 
opposition 
between 
conscious 
daily 
life 
and 
a 
psychic 
activity 
remaining 
unconscious 
which 
can 
only 
make 
itself 
noticeable 
during 
the 
night. 
I 
thus 
find 
a 
threefold 
possibility 
for 
the 
origin 
of 
a 
wish. 
Firstly, 
it 
may 
have 
been 
incited 
during 
the 
day, 
and 
owing 
to 
external 
circumstances 
failed 
to 
find 
gratification, 
there 
is 
thus 
left 
for 
the 
night 
an 
acknowledged 
but 
unfulfilled 
wish. 
Secondly, 
it 
may 
come 
to 
the 
surface 
during 
the 
day 
but 
be 
rejected, 
leaving 
an 
unfulfilled 
but 
suppressed 
wish. 
Or, 
thirdly, 
it 
may 
have 
no 
relation 
to 
daily 
life, 
and 
belong 
to 
those 
wishes 
that 
originate 
during 
the 
night 
from 
the 
suppression. 
If 
we 
now 
follow 
our 
scheme 
of 
the 
psychic 
apparatus, 
we 
can 
localize 
a 
wish 
of 
the 
first 
order 
in 
the 
system 
Forec. 
We 
may 
assume 
that 
a 
wish 
of 
the 
second 
order 
has 
been 
forced 
back 
from 
the 
Forec. 
system 
into 
the 
Unc. 
system, 
where 
alone, 
if 
anywhere, 
it 
can 
maintain 
itself; 
while 
a 
wish-feeling 
of 
the 
third 
order 
we 
consider 
altogether 
incapable 
of 
leaving 
the 
Unc. 
system. 
This 
brings 
up 
the 
question 
whether 
wishes 
arising 
from 
these 
different 
sources 
possess 
the 
same 
value 
for 
the 
dream, 
and 
whether 
they 
have 
the 
same 
power 
to 
incite 
a 
dream. 


On 
reviewing 
the 
dreams 
which 
we 
have 
at 
our 
disposal 
for 
answering 
this 
question, 
we 
are 
at 
once 
moved 
to 
add 
as 
a 
fourth 
source 
of 
the 
dream-wish 
the 
actual 
wish 
incitements 
arising 
during 
the 
night, 
such 
as 
thirst 
and 
sexual 
desire. 
It 
then 
becomes 
evident 
that 
the 
source 
of 
the 
dream-wish 
does 
not 
affect 
its 
capacity 
to 
incite 
a 
dream. 
That 
a 
wish 
suppressed 
during 
the 
day 
asserts 
itself 
in 
the 
dream 
can 
be 
shown 
by 
a 
great 
many 
examples. 
I 
shall 
mention 
a 
very 
simple 
example 
of 
this 
class. 
A 
somewhat 
sarcastic 
young 
lady, 
whose 
younger 
friend 
has 
become 
engaged 
to 
be 
married, 
is 
asked 
throughout 
the 
day 
by 
her 
acquaintances 
whether 
she 
knows 
and 
what 
she 
thinks 
of 
the 
fiancé. 
She 
answers 
with 
unqualified 
praise, 
thereby 
silencing 
her 
own 
judgment, 
as 
she 
would 
prefer 
to 
tell 
the 
truth, 
namely, 
that 
he 
is 
an 
ordinary 
person. 
The 
following 
night 
she 
dreams 
that 
the 
same 
question 
is 
put 
to 
her, 
and 
that 
she 
replies 
with 
the 
formula: 
"In 
case 
of 
subsequent 
orders 
it 
will 
suffice 
to 
mention 
the 
number." 
Finally, 
we 
have 
learned 
from 
numerous 
analyses 
that 
the 
wish 
in 
all 
dreams 
that 
have 
been 
subject 
to 
distortion 
has 
been 
derived 
from 
the 
unconscious, 
and 
has 
been 
unable 
to 
come 
to 
perception 
in 
the 
waking 
state. 
Thus 
it 
would 
appear 
that 
all 
wishes 
are 
of 
the 
same 
value 
and 
force 
for 
the 
dream 
formation. 


I 
am 
at 
present 
unable 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
state 
of 
affairs 
is 
really 
different, 
but 
I 



am 
strongly 
inclined 
to 
assume 
a 
more 
stringent 
determination 
of 
the 
dream-
wish. 
Children's 
dreams 
leave 
no 
doubt 
that 
an 
unfulfilled 
wish 
of 
the 
day 
may 
be 
the 
instigator 
of 
the 
dream. 
But 
we 
must 
not 
forget 
that 
it 
is, 
after 
all, 
the 
wish 
of 
a 
child, 
that 
it 
is 
a 
wish-feeling 
of 
infantile 
strength 
only. 
I 
have 
a 
strong 
doubt 
whether 
an 
unfulfilled 
wish 
from 
the 
day 
would 
suffice 
to 
create 
a 
dream 
in 
an 
adult. 
It 
would 
rather 
seem 
that 
as 
we 
learn 
to 
control 
our 
impulses 
by 
intellectual 
activity, 
we 
more 
and 
more 
reject 
as 
vain 
the 
formation 
or 
retention 
of 
such 
intense 
wishes 
as 
are 
natural 
to 
childhood. 
In 
this, 
indeed, 
there 
may 
be 
individual 
variations; 
some 
retain 
the 
infantile 
type 
of 
psychic 
processes 
longer 
than 
others. 
The 
differences 
are 
here 
the 
same 
as 
those 
found 
in 
the 
gradual 
decline 
of 
the 
originally 
distinct 
visual 
imagination. 


In 
general, 
however, 
I 
am 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
unfulfilled 
wishes 
of 
the 
day 
are 
insufficient 
to 
produce 
a 
dream 
in 
adults. 
I 
readily 
admit 
that 
the 
wish 
instigators 
originating 
in 
conscious 
like 
contribute 
towards 
the 
incitement 
of 
dreams, 
but 
that 
is 
probably 
all. 
The 
dream 
would 
not 
originate 
if 
the 
foreconscious 
wish 
were 
not 
reinforced 
from 
another 
source. 


That 
source 
is 
the 
unconscious. 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
conscious 
wish 
is 
a 
dream 
inciter 
only 
if 
it 
succeeds 
in 
arousing 
a 
similar 
unconscious 
wish 
which 
reinforces 
it. 
Following 
the 
suggestions 
obtained 
through 
the 
psychoanalysis 
of 
the 
neuroses, 
I 
believe 
that 
these 
unconscious 
wishes 
are 
always 
active 
and 
ready 
for 
expression 
whenever 
they 
find 
an 
opportunity 
to 
unite 
themselves 
with 
an 
emotion 
from 
conscious 
life, 
and 
that 
they 
transfer 
their 
greater 
intensity 
to 
the 
lesser 
intensity 
of 
the 
latter.[1] 
It 
may 
therefore 
seem 
that 
the 
conscious 
wish 
alone 
has 
been 
realized 
in 
a 
dream; 
but 
a 
slight 
peculiarity 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
this 
dream 
will 
put 
us 
on 
the 
track 
of 
the 
powerful 
helper 
from 
the 
unconscious. 
These 
ever 
active 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
immortal 
wishes 
from 
the 
unconscious 
recall 
the 
legendary 
Titans 
who 
from 
time 
immemorial 
have 
borne 
the 
ponderous 
mountains 
which 
were 
once 
rolled 
upon 
them 
by 
the 
victorious 
gods, 
and 
which 
even 
now 
quiver 
from 
time 
to 
time 
from 
the 
convulsions 
of 
their 
mighty 
limbs; 
I 
say 
that 
these 
wishes 
found 
in 
the 
repression 
are 
of 
themselves 
of 
an 
infantile 
origin, 
as 
we 
have 
learned 
from 
the 
psychological 
investigation 
of 
the 
neuroses. 
I 
should 
like, 
therefore, 
to 
withdraw 
the 
opinion 
previously 
expressed 
that 
it 
is 
unimportant 
whence 
the 
dream-wish 
originates, 
and 
replace 
it 
by 
another, 
as 
follows: 
The 
wish 
manifested 
in 
the 
dream 
must 
be 
an 
infantile 
one. 
In 
the 
adult 
it 
originates 
in 



the 
Unc., 
while 
in 
the 
child, 
where 
no 
separation 
and 
censor 
as 
yet 
exist 
between 
Forec. 
and 
Unc., 
or 
where 
these 
are 
only 
in 
the 
process 
of 
formation, 
it 
is 
an 
unfulfilled 
and 
unrepressed 
wish 
from 
the 
waking 
state. 
I 
am 
aware 
that 
this 
conception 
cannot 
be 
generally 
demonstrated, 
but 
I 
maintain 
nevertheless 
that 
it 
can 
be 
frequently 
demonstrated, 
even 
when 
it 
was 
not 
suspected, 
and 
that 
it 
cannot 
be 
generally 
refuted. 


The 
wish-feelings 
which 
remain 
from 
the 
conscious 
waking 
state 
are, 
therefore, 
relegated 
to 
the 
background 
in 
the 
dream 
formation. 
In 
the 
dream 
content 
I 
shall 
attribute 
to 
them 
only 
the 
part 
attributed 
to 
the 
material 
of 
actual 
sensations 
during 
sleep. 
If 
I 
now 
take 
into 
account 
those 
other 
psychic 
instigations 
remaining 
from 
the 
waking 
state 
which 
are 
not 
wishes, 
I 
shall 
only 
adhere 
to 
the 
line 
mapped 
out 
for 
me 
by 
this 
train 
of 
thought. 
We 
may 
succeed 
in 
provisionally 
terminating 
the 
sum 
of 
energy 
of 
our 
waking 
thoughts 
by 
deciding 
to 
go 
to 
sleep. 
He 
is 
a 
good 
sleeper 
who 
can 
do 
this; 
Napoleon 
I. 
is 
reputed 
to 
have 
been 
a 
model 
of 
this 
sort. 
But 
we 
do 
not 
always 
succeed 
in 
accomplishing 
it, 
or 
in 
accomplishing 
it 
perfectly. 
Unsolved 
problems, 
harassing 
cares, 
overwhelming 
impressions 
continue 
the 
thinking 
activity 
even 
during 
sleep, 
maintaining 
psychic 
processes 
in 
the 
system 
which 
we 
have 
termed 
the 
foreconscious. 
These 
mental 
processes 
continuing 
into 
sleep 
may 
be 
divided 
into 
the 
following 
groups: 
1, 
That 
which 
has 
not 
been 
terminated 
during 
the 
day 
owing 
to 
casual 
prevention; 
2, 
that 
which 
has 
been 
left 
unfinished 
by 
temporary 
paralysis 
of 
our 
mental 
power, 
_i.e._ 
the 
unsolved; 
3, 
that 
which 
has 
been 
rejected 
and 
suppressed 
during 
the 
day. 
This 
unites 
with 
a 
powerful 
group 
(4) 
formed 
by 
that 
which 
has 
been 
excited 
in 
our 
Unc. 
during 
the 
day 
by 
the 
work 
of 
the 
foreconscious. 
Finally, 
we 
may 
add 
group 
(5) 
consisting 
of 
the 
indifferent 
and 
hence 
unsettled 
impressions 
of 
the 
day. 


We 
should 
not 
underrate 
the 
psychic 
intensities 
introduced 
into 
sleep 
by 
these 
remnants 
of 
waking 
life, 
especially 
those 
emanating 
from 
the 
group 
of 
the 
unsolved. 
These 
excitations 
surely 
continue 
to 
strive 
for 
expression 
during 
the 
night, 
and 
we 
may 
assume 
with 
equal 
certainty 
that 
the 
sleeping 
state 
renders 
impossible 
the 
usual 
continuation 
of 
the 
excitement 
in 
the 
foreconscious 
and 
the 
termination 
of 
the 
excitement 
by 
its 
becoming 
conscious. 
As 
far 
as 
we 
can 
normally 
become 
conscious 
of 
our 
mental 
processes, 
even 
during 
the 
night, 
in 
so 
far 
we 
are 
not 
asleep. 
I 
shall 
not 
venture 
to 
state 
what 
change 
is 
produced 
in 
the 
Forec. 
system 
by 
the 
sleeping 



state, 
but 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
the 
psychological 
character 
of 
sleep 
is 
essentially 
due 
to 
the 
change 
of 
energy 
in 
this 
very 
system, 
which 
also 
dominates 
the 
approach 
to 
motility, 
which 
is 
paralyzed 
during 
sleep. 
In 
contradistinction 
to 
this, 
there 
seems 
to 
be 
nothing 
in 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
dream 
to 
warrant 
the 
assumption 
that 
sleep 
produces 
any 
but 
secondary 
changes 
in 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
Unc. 
system. 
Hence, 
for 
the 
nocturnal 
excitation 
in 
the 
Force, 
there 
remains 
no 
other 
path 
than 
that 
followed 
by 
the 
wish 
excitements 
from 
the 
Unc. 
This 
excitation 
must 
seek 
reinforcement 
from 
the 
Unc., 
and 
follow 
the 
detours 
of 
the 
unconscious 
excitations. 
But 
what 
is 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
foreconscious 
day 
remnants 
to 
the 
dream? 
There 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
they 
penetrate 
abundantly 
into 
the 
dream, 
that 
they 
utilize 
the 
dream 
content 
to 
obtrude 
themselves 
upon 
consciousness 
even 
during 
the 
night; 
indeed, 
they 
occasionally 
even 
dominate 
the 
dream 
content, 
and 
impel 
it 
to 
continue 
the 
work 
of 
the 
day; 
it 
is 
also 
certain 
that 
the 
day 
remnants 
may 
just 
as 
well 
have 
any 
other 
character 
as 
that 
of 
wishes; 
but 
it 
is 
highly 
instructive 
and 
even 
decisive 
for 
the 
theory 
of 
wish-fulfillment 
to 
see 
what 
conditions 
they 
must 
comply 
with 
in 
order 
to 
be 
received 
into 
the 
dream. 


Let 
us 
pick 
out 
one 
of 
the 
dreams 
cited 
above 
as 
examples, 
_e.g._, 
the 
dream 
in 
which 
my 
friend 
Otto 
seems 
to 
show 
the 
symptoms 
of 
Basedow's 
disease. 
My 
friend 
Otto's 
appearance 
occasioned 
me 
some 
concern 
during 
the 
day, 
and 
this 
worry, 
like 
everything 
else 
referring 
to 
this 
person, 
affected 
me. 
I 
may 
also 
assume 
that 
these 
feelings 
followed 
me 
into 
sleep. 
I 
was 
probably 
bent 
on 
finding 
out 
what 
was 
the 
matter 
with 
him. 
In 
the 
night 
my 
worry 
found 
expression 
in 
the 
dream 
which 
I 
have 
reported, 
the 
content 
of 
which 
was 
not 
only 
senseless, 
but 
failed 
to 
show 
any 
wish-fulfillment. 
But 
I 
began 
to 
investigate 
for 
the 
source 
of 
this 
incongruous 
expression 
of 
the 
solicitude 
felt 
during 
the 
day, 
and 
analysis 
revealed 
the 
connection. 
I 
identified 
my 
friend 
Otto 
with 
a 
certain 
Baron 
L. 
and 
myself 
with 
a 
Professor 
R. 
There 
was 
only 
one 
explanation 
for 
my 
being 
impelled 
to 
select 
just 
this 
substitution 
for 
the 
day 
thought. 
I 
must 
have 
always 
been 
prepared 
in 
the 
Unc. 
to 
identify 
myself 
with 
Professor 
R., 
as 
it 
meant 
the 
realization 
of 
one 
of 
the 
immortal 
infantile 
wishes, 
viz. 
that 
of 
becoming 
great. 
Repulsive 
ideas 
respecting 
my 
friend, 
that 
would 
certainly 
have 
been 
repudiated 
in 
a 
waking 
state, 
took 
advantage 
of 
the 
opportunity 
to 
creep 
into 
the 
dream, 
but 
the 
worry 
of 
the 
day 
likewise 
found 
some 
form 
of 
expression 
through 
a 
substitution 
in 
the 
dream 
content. 
The 
day 
thought, 
which 
was 
no 
wish 
in 
itself 
but 
rather 
a 
worry, 
had 



in 
some 
way 
to 
find 
a 
connection 
with 
the 
infantile 
now 
unconscious 
and 
suppressed 
wish, 
which 
then 
allowed 
it, 
though 
already 
properly 
prepared, 
to 
"originate" 
for 
consciousness. 
The 
more 
dominating 
this 
worry, 
the 
stronger 
must 
be 
the 
connection 
to 
be 
established; 
between 
the 
contents 
of 
the 
wish 
and 
that 
of 
the 
worry 
there 
need 
be 
no 
connection, 
nor 
was 
there 
one 
in 
any 
of 
our 
examples. 


We 
can 
now 
sharply 
define 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
unconscious 
wish 
for 
the 
dream. 
It 
may 
be 
admitted 
that 
there 
is 
a 
whole 
class 
of 
dreams 
in 
which 
the 
incitement 
originates 
preponderatingly 
or 
even 
exclusively 
from 
the 
remnants 
of 
daily 
life; 
and 
I 
believe 
that 
even 
my 
cherished 
desire 
to 
become 
at 
some 
future 
time 
a 
"professor 
extraordinarius" 
would 
have 
allowed 
me 
to 
slumber 
undisturbed 
that 
night 
had 
not 
my 
worry 
about 
my 
friend's 
health 
been 
still 
active. 
But 
this 
worry 
alone 
would 
not 
have 
produced 
a 
dream; 
the 
motive 
power 
needed 
by 
the 
dream 
had 
to 
be 
contributed 
by 
a 
wish, 
and 
it 
was 
the 
affair 
of 
the 
worriment 
to 
procure 
for 
itself 
such 
wish 
as 
a 
motive 
power 
of 
the 
dream. 
To 
speak 
figuratively, 
it 
is 
quite 
possible 
that 
a 
day 
thought 
plays 
the 
part 
of 
the 
contractor 
(_entrepreneur_) 
in 
the 
dream. 
But 
it 
is 
known 
that 
no 
matter 
what 
idea 
the 
contractor 
may 
have 
in 
mind, 
and 
how 
desirous 
he 
may 
be 
of 
putting 
it 
into 
operation, 
he 
can 
do 
nothing 
without 
capital; 
he 
must 
depend 
upon 
a 
capitalist 
to 
defray 
the 
necessary 
expenses, 
and 
this 
capitalist, 
who 
supplies 
the 
psychic 
expenditure 
for 
the 
dream 
is 
invariably 
and 
indisputably 
a 
wish 
from 
the 
unconscious, 
no 
matter 
what 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
waking 
thought 
may 
be. 


In 
other 
cases 
the 
capitalist 
himself 
is 
the 
contractor 
for 
the 
dream; 
this, 
indeed, 
seems 
to 
be 
the 
more 
usual 
case. 
An 
unconscious 
wish 
is 
produced 
by 
the 
day's 
work, 
which 
in 
turn 
creates 
the 
dream. 
The 
dream 
processes, 
moreover, 
run 
parallel 
with 
all 
the 
other 
possibilities 
of 
the 
economic 
relationship 
used 
here 
as 
an 
illustration. 
Thus, 
the 
entrepreneur 
may 
contribute 
some 
capital 
himself, 
or 
several 
entrepreneurs 
may 
seek 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
same 
capitalist, 
or 
several 
capitalists 
may 
jointly 
supply 
the 
capital 
required 
by 
the 
entrepreneur. 
Thus 
there 
are 
dreams 
produced 
by 
more 
than 
one 
dream-wish, 
and 
many 
similar 
variations 
which 
may 
readily 
be 
passed 
over 
and 
are 
of 
no 
further 
interest 
to 
us. 
What 
we 
have 
left 
unfinished 
in 
this 
discussion 
of 
the 
dream-wish 
we 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
develop 
later. 


The 
"tertium 
comparationis" 
in 
the 
comparisons 
just 
employed--_i.e._ 
the 



sum 
placed 
at 
our 
free 
disposal 
in 
proper 
allotment--admits 
of 
still 
finer 
application 
for 
the 
illustration 
of 
the 
dream 
structure. 
We 
can 
recognize 
in 
most 
dreams 
a 
center 
especially 
supplied 
with 
perceptible 
intensity. 
This 
is 
regularly 
the 
direct 
representation 
of 
the 
wish-fulfillment; 
for, 
if 
we 
undo 
the 
displacements 
of 
the 
dream-work 
by 
a 
process 
of 
retrogression, 
we 
find 
that 
the 
psychic 
intensity 
of 
the 
elements 
in 
the 
dream 
thoughts 
is 
replaced 
by 
the 
perceptible 
intensity 
of 
the 
elements 
in 
the 
dream 
content. 
The 
elements 
adjoining 
the 
wish-fulfillment 
have 
frequently 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
its 
sense, 
but 
prove 
to 
be 
descendants 
of 
painful 
thoughts 
which 
oppose 
the 
wish. 
But, 
owing 
to 
their 
frequently 
artificial 
connection 
with 
the 
central 
element, 
they 
have 
acquired 
sufficient 
intensity 
to 
enable 
them 
to 
come 
to 
expression. 
Thus, 
the 
force 
of 
expression 
of 
the 
wish-fulfillment 
is 
diffused 
over 
a 
certain 
sphere 
of 
association, 
within 
which 
it 
raises 
to 
expression 
all 
elements, 
including 
those 
that 
are 
in 
themselves 
impotent. 
In 
dreams 
having 
several 
strong 
wishes 
we 
can 
readily 
separate 
from 
one 
another 
the 
spheres 
of 
the 
individual 
wish-fulfillments; 
the 
gaps 
in 
the 
dream 
likewise 
can 
often 
be 
explained 
as 
boundary 
zones. 


Although 
the 
foregoing 
remarks 
have 
considerably 
limited 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
day 
remnants 
for 
the 
dream, 
it 
will 
nevertheless 
be 
worth 
our 
while 
to 
give 
them 
some 
attention. 
For 
they 
must 
be 
a 
necessary 
ingredient 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
dream, 
inasmuch 
as 
experience 
reveals 
the 
surprising 
fact 
that 
every 
dream 
shows 
in 
its 
content 
a 
connection 
with 
some 
impression 
of 
a 
recent 
day, 
often 
of 
the 
most 
indifferent 
kind. 
So 
far 
we 
have 
failed 
to 
see 
any 
necessity 
for 
this 
addition 
to 
the 
dream 
mixture. 
This 
necessity 
appears 
only 
when 
we 
follow 
closely 
the 
part 
played 
by 
the 
unconscious 
wish, 
and 
then 
seek 
information 
in 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
neuroses. 
We 
thus 
learn 
that 
the 
unconscious 
idea, 
as 
such, 
is 
altogether 
incapable 
of 
entering 
into 
the 
foreconscious, 
and 
that 
it 
can 
exert 
an 
influence 
there 
only 
by 
uniting 
with 
a 
harmless 
idea 
already 
belonging 
to 
the 
foreconscious, 
to 
which 
it 
transfers 
its 
intensity 
and 
under 
which 
it 
allows 
itself 
to 
be 
concealed. 
This 
is 
the 
fact 
of 
transference 
which 
furnishes 
an 
explanation 
for 
so 
many 
surprising 
occurrences 
in 
the 
psychic 
life 
of 
neurotics. 


The 
idea 
from 
the 
foreconscious 
which 
thus 
obtains 
an 
unmerited 
abundance 
of 
intensity 
may 
be 
left 
unchanged 
by 
the 
transference, 
or 
it 
may 
have 
forced 
upon 
it 
a 
modification 
from 
the 
content 
of 
the 
transferring 
idea. 
I 
trust 
the 
reader 
will 
pardon 
my 
fondness 
for 
comparisons 
from 
daily 
life, 
but 
I 
feel 



tempted 
to 
say 
that 
the 
relations 
existing 
for 
the 
repressed 
idea 
are 
similar 
to 
the 
situations 
existing 
in 
Austria 
for 
the 
American 
dentist, 
who 
is 
forbidden 
to 
practise 
unless 
he 
gets 
permission 
from 
a 
regular 
physician 
to 
use 
his 
name 
on 
the 
public 
signboard 
and 
thus 
cover 
the 
legal 
requirements. 
Moreover, 
just 
as 
it 
is 
naturally 
not 
the 
busiest 
physicians 
who 
form 
such 
alliances 
with 
dental 
practitioners, 
so 
in 
the 
psychic 
life 
only 
such 
foreconscious 
or 
conscious 
ideas 
are 
chosen 
to 
cover 
a 
repressed 
idea 
as 
have 
not 
themselves 
attracted 
much 
of 
the 
attention 
which 
is 
operative 
in 
the 
foreconscious. 
The 
unconscious 
entangles 
with 
its 
connections 
preferentially 
either 
those 
impressions 
and 
ideas 
of 
the 
foreconscious 
which 
have 
been 
left 
unnoticed 
as 
indifferent, 
or 
those 
that 
have 
soon 
been 
deprived 
of 
this 
attention 
through 
rejection. 
It 
is 
a 
familiar 
fact 
from 
the 
association 
studies 
confirmed 
by 
every 
experience, 
that 
ideas 
which 
have 
formed 
intimate 
connections 
in 
one 
direction 
assume 
an 
almost 
negative 
attitude 
to 
whole 
groups 
of 
new 
connections. 
I 
once 
tried 
from 
this 
principle 
to 
develop 
a 
theory 
for 
hysterical 
paralysis. 


If 
we 
assume 
that 
the 
same 
need 
for 
the 
transference 
of 
the 
repressed 
ideas 
which 
we 
have 
learned 
to 
know 
from 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
neuroses 
makes 
its 
influence 
felt 
in 
the 
dream 
as 
well, 
we 
can 
at 
once 
explain 
two 
riddles 
of 
the 
dream, 
viz. 
that 
every 
dream 
analysis 
shows 
an 
interweaving 
of 
a 
recent 
impression, 
and 
that 
this 
recent 
element 
is 
frequently 
of 
the 
most 
indifferent 
character. 
We 
may 
add 
what 
we 
have 
already 
learned 
elsewhere, 
that 
these 
recent 
and 
indifferent 
elements 
come 
so 
frequently 
into 
the 
dream 
content 
as 
a 
substitute 
for 
the 
most 
deep-lying 
of 
the 
dream 
thoughts, 
for 
the 
further 
reason 
that 
they 
have 
least 
to 
fear 
from 
the 
resisting 
censor. 
But 
while 
this 
freedom 
from 
censorship 
explains 
only 
the 
preference 
for 
trivial 
elements, 
the 
constant 
presence 
of 
recent 
elements 
points 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
is 
a 
need 
for 
transference. 
Both 
groups 
of 
impressions 
satisfy 
the 
demand 
of 
the 
repression 
for 
material 
still 
free 
from 
associations, 
the 
indifferent 
ones 
because 
they 
have 
offered 
no 
inducement 
for 
extensive 
associations, 
and 
the 
recent 
ones 
because 
they 
have 
had 
insufficient 
time 
to 
form 
such 
associations. 


We 
thus 
see 
that 
the 
day 
remnants, 
among 
which 
we 
may 
now 
include 
the 
indifferent 
impressions 
when 
they 
participate 
in 
the 
dream 
formation, 
not 
only 
borrow 
from 
the 
Unc. 
the 
motive 
power 
at 
the 
disposal 
of 
the 
repressed 
wish, 
but 
also 
offer 
to 
the 
unconscious 
something 
indispensable, 
namely, 
the 
attachment 
necessary 
to 
the 
transference. 
If 
we 
here 
attempted 
to 
penetrate 



more 
deeply 
into 
the 
psychic 
processes, 
we 
should 
first 
have 
to 
throw 
more 
light 
on 
the 
play 
of 
emotions 
between 
the 
foreconscious 
and 
the 
unconscious, 
to 
which, 
indeed, 
we 
are 
urged 
by 
the 
study 
of 
the 
psychoneuroses, 
whereas 
the 
dream 
itself 
offers 
no 
assistance 
in 
this 
respect. 


Just 
one 
further 
remark 
about 
the 
day 
remnants. 
There 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
they 
are 
the 
actual 
disturbers 
of 
sleep, 
and 
not 
the 
dream, 
which, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
strives 
to 
guard 
sleep. 
But 
we 
shall 
return 
to 
this 
point 
later. 


We 
have 
so 
far 
discussed 
the 
dream-wish, 
we 
have 
traced 
it 
to 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
Unc., 
and 
analyzed 
its 
relations 
to 
the 
day 
remnants, 
which 
in 
turn 
may 
be 
either 
wishes, 
psychic 
emotions 
of 
any 
other 
kind, 
or 
simply 
recent 
impressions. 
We 
have 
thus 
made 
room 
for 
any 
claims 
that 
may 
be 
made 
for 
the 
importance 
of 
conscious 
thought 
activity 
in 
dream 
formations 
in 
all 
its 
variations. 
Relying 
upon 
our 
thought 
series, 
it 
would 
not 
be 
at 
all 
impossible 
for 
us 
to 
explain 
even 
those 
extreme 
cases 
in 
which 
the 
dream 
as 
a 
continuer 
of 
the 
day 
work 
brings 
to 
a 
happy 
conclusion 
and 
unsolved 
problem 
possess 
an 
example, 
the 
analysis 
of 
which 
might 
reveal 
the 
infantile 
or 
repressed 
wish 
source 
furnishing 
such 
alliance 
and 
successful 
strengthening 
of 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
foreconscious 
activity. 
But 
we 
have 
not 
come 
one 
step 
nearer 
a 
solution 
of 
the 
riddle: 
Why 
can 
the 
unconscious 
furnish 
the 
motive 
power 
for 
the 
wish-fulfillment 
only 
during 
sleep? 
The 
answer 
to 
this 
question 
must 
throw 
light 
on 
the 
psychic 
nature 
of 
wishes; 
and 
it 
will 
be 
given 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
diagram 
of 
the 
psychic 
apparatus. 


We 
do 
not 
doubt 
that 
even 
this 
apparatus 
attained 
its 
present 
perfection 
through 
a 
long 
course 
of 
development. 
Let 
us 
attempt 
to 
restore 
it 
as 
it 
existed 
in 
an 
early 
phase 
of 
its 
activity. 
From 
assumptions, 
to 
be 
confirmed 
elsewhere, 
we 
know 
that 
at 
first 
the 
apparatus 
strove 
to 
keep 
as 
free 
from 
excitement 
as 
possible, 
and 
in 
its 
first 
formation, 
therefore, 
the 
scheme 
took 
the 
form 
of 
a 
reflex 
apparatus, 
which 
enabled 
it 
promptly 
to 
discharge 
through 
the 
motor 
tracts 
any 
sensible 
stimulus 
reaching 
it 
from 
without. 
But 
this 
simple 
function 
was 
disturbed 
by 
the 
wants 
of 
life, 
which 
likewise 
furnish 
the 
impulse 
for 
the 
further 
development 
of 
the 
apparatus. 
The 
wants 
of 
life 
first 
manifested 
themselves 
to 
it 
in 
the 
form 
of 
the 
great 
physical 
needs. 
The 
excitement 
aroused 
by 
the 
inner 
want 
seeks 
an 
outlet 
in 
motility, 
which 
may 
be 
designated 
as 
"inner 
changes" 
or 
as 
an 
"expression 
of 
the 
emotions." 
The 
hungry 
child 
cries 
or 
fidgets 
helplessly, 
but 
its 
situation 



remains 
unchanged; 
for 
the 
excitation 
proceeding 
from 
an 
inner 
want 
requires, 
not 
a 
momentary 
outbreak, 
but 
a 
force 
working 
continuously. 
A 
change 
can 
occur 
only 
if 
in 
some 
way 
a 
feeling 
of 
gratification 
is 
experienced--which 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
child 
must 
be 
through 
outside 
help--in 
order 
to 
remove 
the 
inner 
excitement. 
An 
essential 
constituent 
of 
this 
experience 
is 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
certain 
perception 
(of 
food 
in 
our 
example), 
the 
memory 
picture 
of 
which 
thereafter 
remains 
associated 
with 
the 
memory 
trace 
of 
the 
excitation 
of 
want. 


Thanks 
to 
the 
established 
connection, 
there 
results 
at 
the 
next 
appearance 
of 
this 
want 
a 
psychic 
feeling 
which 
revives 
the 
memory 
picture 
of 
the 
former 
perception, 
and 
thus 
recalls 
the 
former 
perception 
itself, 
_i.e._ 
it 
actually 
reestablishes 
the 
situation 
of 
the 
first 
gratification. 
We 
call 
such 
a 
feeling 
a 
wish; 
the 
reappearance 
of 
the 
perception 
constitutes 
the 
wish-fulfillment, 
and 
the 
full 
revival 
of 
the 
perception 
by 
the 
want 
excitement 
constitutes 
the 
shortest 
road 
to 
the 
wish-fulfillment. 
We 
may 
assume 
a 
primitive 
condition 
of 
the 
psychic 
apparatus 
in 
which 
this 
road 
is 
really 
followed, 
_i.e._ 
where 
the 
wishing 
merges 
into 
an 
hallucination, 
This 
first 
psychic 
activity 
therefore 
aims 
at 
an 
identity 
of 
perception, 
_i.e._ 
it 
aims 
at 
a 
repetition 
of 
that 
perception 
which 
is 
connected 
with 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
the 
want. 


This 
primitive 
mental 
activity 
must 
have 
been 
modified 
by 
bitter 
practical 
experience 
into 
a 
more 
expedient 
secondary 
activity. 
The 
establishment 
of 
the 
identity 
perception 
on 
the 
short 
regressive 
road 
within 
the 
apparatus 
does 
not 
in 
another 
respect 
carry 
with 
it 
the 
result 
which 
inevitably 
follows 
the 
revival 
of 
the 
same 
perception 
from 
without. 
The 
gratification 
does 
not 
take 
place, 
and 
the 
want 
continues. 
In 
order 
to 
equalize 
the 
internal 
with 
the 
external 
sum 
of 
energy, 
the 
former 
must 
be 
continually 
maintained, 
just 
as 
actually 
happens 
in 
the 
hallucinatory 
psychoses 
and 
in 
the 
deliriums 
of 
hunger 
which 
exhaust 
their 
psychic 
capacity 
in 
clinging 
to 
the 
object 
desired. 
In 
order 
to 
make 
more 
appropriate 
use 
of 
the 
psychic 
force, 
it 
becomes 
necessary 
to 
inhibit 
the 
full 
regression 
so 
as 
to 
prevent 
it 
from 
extending 
beyond 
the 
image 
of 
memory, 
whence 
it 
can 
select 
other 
paths 
leading 
ultimately 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
desired 
identity 
from 
the 
outer 
world. 
This 
inhibition 
and 
consequent 
deviation 
from 
the 
excitation 
becomes 
the 
task 
of 
a 
second 
system 
which 
dominates 
the 
voluntary 
motility, 
_i.e._ 
through 
whose 
activity 
the 
expenditure 
of 
motility 
is 
now 
devoted 
to 
previously 
recalled 
purposes. 
But 
this 
entire 
complicated 
mental 
activity 
which 
works 
its 
way 
from 
the 



memory 
picture 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
perception 
identity 
from 
the 
outer 
world 
merely 
represents 
a 
detour 
which 
has 
been 
forced 
upon 
the 
wish-
fulfillment 
by 
experience.[2] 
Thinking 
is 
indeed 
nothing 
but 
the 
equivalent 
of 
the 
hallucinatory 
wish; 
and 
if 
the 
dream 
be 
called 
a 
wish-fulfillment 
this 
becomes 
self-evident, 
as 
nothing 
but 
a 
wish 
can 
impel 
our 
psychic 
apparatus 
to 
activity. 
The 
dream, 
which 
in 
fulfilling 
its 
wishes 
follows 
the 
short 
regressive 
path, 
thereby 
preserves 
for 
us 
only 
an 
example 
of 
the 
primary 
form 
of 
the 
psychic 
apparatus 
which 
has 
been 
abandoned 
as 
inexpedient. 
What 
once 
ruled 
in 
the 
waking 
state 
when 
the 
psychic 
life 
was 
still 
young 
and 
unfit 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
banished 
into 
the 
sleeping 
state, 
just 
as 
we 
see 
again 
in 
the 
nursery 
the 
bow 
and 
arrow, 
the 
discarded 
primitive 
weapons 
of 
grown-up 
humanity. 
_The 
dream 
is 
a 
fragment 
of 
the 
abandoned 
psychic 
life 
of 
the 
child._ 
In 
the 
psychoses 
these 
modes 
of 
operation 
of 
the 
psychic 
apparatus, 
which 
are 
normally 
suppressed 
in 
the 
waking 
state, 
reassert 
themselves, 
and 
then 
betray 
their 
inability 
to 
satisfy 
our 
wants 
in 
the 
outer 
world. 


The 
unconscious 
wish-feelings 
evidently 
strive 
to 
assert 
themselves 
during 
the 
day 
also, 
and 
the 
fact 
of 
transference 
and 
the 
psychoses 
teach 
us 
that 
they 
endeavor 
to 
penetrate 
to 
consciousness 
and 
dominate 
motility 
by 
the 
road 
leading 
through 
the 
system 
of 
the 
foreconscious. 
It 
is, 
therefore, 
the 
censor 
lying 
between 
the 
Unc. 
and 
the 
Forec., 
the 
assumption 
of 
which 
is 
forced 
upon 
us 
by 
the 
dream, 
that 
we 
have 
to 
recognize 
and 
honor 
as 
the 
guardian 
of 
our 
psychic 
health. 
But 
is 
it 
not 
carelessness 
on 
the 
part 
of 
this 
guardian 
to 
diminish 
its 
vigilance 
during 
the 
night 
and 
to 
allow 
the 
suppressed 
emotions 
of 
the 
Unc. 
to 
come 
to 
expression, 
thus 
again 
making 
possible 
the 
hallucinatory 
regression? 
I 
think 
not, 
for 
when 
the 
critical 
guardian 
goes 
to 
rest--and 
we 
have 
proof 
that 
his 
slumber 
is 
not 
profound--he 
takes 
care 
to 
close 
the 
gate 
to 
motility. 
No 
matter 
what 
feelings 
from 
the 
otherwise 
inhibited 
Unc. 
may 
roam 
about 
on 
the 
scene, 
they 
need 
not 
be 
interfered 
with; 
they 
remain 
harmless 
because 
they 
are 
unable 
to 
put 
in 
motion 
the 
motor 
apparatus 
which 
alone 
can 
exert 
a 
modifying 
influence 
upon 
the 
outer 
world. 
Sleep 
guarantees 
the 
security 
of 
the 
fortress 
which 
is 
under 
guard. 
Conditions 
are 
less 
harmless 
when 
a 
displacement 
of 
forces 
is 
produced, 
not 
through 
a 
nocturnal 
diminution 
in 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
critical 
censor, 
but 
through 
pathological 
enfeeblement 
of 
the 
latter 
or 
through 
pathological 
reinforcement 
of 
the 
unconscious 
excitations, 
and 
this 
while 
the 
foreconscious 
is 
charged 
with 
energy 
and 
the 
avenues 
to 
motility 
are 
open. 
The 
guardian 
is 
then 



overpowered, 
the 
unconscious 
excitations 
subdue 
the 
Forec.; 
through 
it 
they 
dominate 
our 
speech 
and 
actions, 
or 
they 
enforce 
the 
hallucinatory 
regression, 
thus 
governing 
an 
apparatus 
not 
designed 
for 
them 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
attraction 
exerted 
by 
the 
perceptions 
on 
the 
distribution 
of 
our 
psychic 
energy. 
We 
call 
this 
condition 
a 
psychosis. 


We 
are 
now 
in 
the 
best 
position 
to 
complete 
our 
psychological 
construction, 
which 
has 
been 
interrupted 
by 
the 
introduction 
of 
the 
two 
systems, 
Unc. 
and 
Forec. 
We 
have 
still, 
however, 
ample 
reason 
for 
giving 
further 
consideration 
to 
the 
wish 
as 
the 
sole 
psychic 
motive 
power 
in 
the 
dream. 
We 
have 
explained 
that 
the 
reason 
why 
the 
dream 
is 
in 
every 
case 
a 
wish 
realization 
is 
because 
it 
is 
a 
product 
of 
the 
Unc., 
which 
knows 
no 
other 
aim 
in 
its 
activity 
but 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
wishes, 
and 
which 
has 
no 
other 
forces 
at 
its 
disposal 
but 
wish-feelings. 
If 
we 
avail 
ourselves 
for 
a 
moment 
longer 
of 
the 
right 
to 
elaborate 
from 
the 
dream 
interpretation 
such 
far-reaching 
psychological 
speculations, 
we 
are 
in 
duty 
bound 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
we 
are 
thereby 
bringing 
the 
dream 
into 
a 
relationship 
which 
may 
also 
comprise 
other 
psychic 
structures. 
If 
there 
exists 
a 
system 
of 
the 
Unc.--or 
something 
sufficiently 
analogous 
to 
it 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
our 
discussion--the 
dream 
cannot 
be 
its 
sole 
manifestation; 
every 
dream 
may 
be 
a 
wish-fulfillment, 
but 
there 
must 
be 
other 
forms 
of 
abnormal 
wish-fulfillment 
beside 
this 
of 
dreams. 
Indeed, 
the 
theory 
of 
all 
psychoneurotic 
symptoms 
culminates 
in 
the 
proposition 
_that 
they 
too 
must 
be 
taken 
as 
wish-fulfillments 
of 
the 
unconscious_. 
Our 
explanation 
makes 
the 
dream 
only 
the 
first 
member 
of 
a 
group 
most 
important 
for 
the 
psychiatrist, 
an 
understanding 
of 
which 
means 
the 
solution 
of 
the 
purely 
psychological 
part 
of 
the 
psychiatric 
problem. 
But 
other 
members 
of 
this 
group 
of 
wish-fulfillments, 
_e.g._, 
the 
hysterical 
symptoms, 
evince 
one 
essential 
quality 
which 
I 
have 
so 
far 
failed 
to 
find 
in 
the 
dream. 
Thus, 
from 
the 
investigations 
frequently 
referred 
to 
in 
this 
treatise, 
I 
know 
that 
the 
formation 
of 
an 
hysterical 
symptom 
necessitates 
the 
combination 
of 
both 
streams 
of 
our 
psychic 
life. 
The 
symptom 
is 
not 
merely 
the 
expression 
of 
a 
realized 
unconscious 
wish, 
but 
it 
must 
be 
joined 
by 
another 
wish 
from 
the 
foreconscious 
which 
is 
fulfilled 
by 
the 
same 
symptom; 
so 
that 
the 
symptom 
is 
at 
least 
doubly 
determined, 
once 
by 
each 
one 
of 
the 
conflicting 
systems. 
Just 
as 
in 
the 
dream, 
there 
is 
no 
limit 
to 
further 
over-determination. 
The 
determination 
not 
derived 
from 
the 
Unc. 
is, 
as 
far 
as 
I 
can 
see, 
invariably 
a 
stream 
of 
thought 
in 
reaction 
against 
the 
unconscious 
wish, 
_e.g._, 
a 
self



punishment. 
Hence 
I 
may 
say, 
in 
general, 
that 
_an 
hysterical 
symptom 
originates 
only 
where 
two 
contrasting 
wish-fulfillments, 
having 
their 
source 
in 
different 
psychic 
systems, 
are 
able 
to 
combine 
in 
one 
expression_. 
(Compare 
my 
latest 
formulation 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
hysterical 
symptoms 
in 
a 
treatise 
published 
by 
the 
_Zeitschrift 
für 
Sexualwissenschaft_, 
by 
Hirschfeld 
and 
others, 
1908). 
Examples 
on 
this 
point 
would 
prove 
of 
little 
value, 
as 
nothing 
but 
a 
complete 
unveiling 
of 
the 
complication 
in 
question 
would 
carry 
conviction. 
I 
therefore 
content 
myself 
with 
the 
mere 
assertion, 
and 
will 
cite 
an 
example, 
not 
for 
conviction 
but 
for 
explication. 
The 
hysterical 
vomiting 
of 
a 
female 
patient 
proved, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
to 
be 
the 
realization 
of 
an 
unconscious 
fancy 
from 
the 
time 
of 
puberty, 
that 
she 
might 
be 
continuously 
pregnant 
and 
have 
a 
multitude 
of 
children, 
and 
this 
was 
subsequently 
united 
with 
the 
wish 
that 
she 
might 
have 
them 
from 
as 
many 
men 
as 
possible. 
Against 
this 
immoderate 
wish 
there 
arose 
a 
powerful 
defensive 
impulse. 
But 
as 
the 
vomiting 
might 
spoil 
the 
patient's 
figure 
and 
beauty, 
so 
that 
she 
would 
not 
find 
favor 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
mankind, 
the 
symptom 
was 
therefore 
in 
keeping 
with 
her 
punitive 
trend 
of 
thought, 
and, 
being 
thus 
admissible 
from 
both 
sides, 
it 
was 
allowed 
to 
become 
a 
reality. 
This 
is 
the 
same 
manner 
of 
consenting 
to 
a 
wish-fulfillment 
which 
the 
queen 
of 
the 
Parthians 
chose 
for 
the 
triumvir 
Crassus. 
Believing 
that 
he 
had 
undertaken 
the 
campaign 
out 
of 
greed 
for 
gold, 
she 
caused 
molten 
gold 
to 
be 
poured 
into 
the 
throat 
of 
the 
corpse. 
"Now 
hast 
thou 
what 
thou 
hast 
longed 
for." 
As 
yet 
we 
know 
of 
the 
dream 
only 
that 
it 
expresses 
a 
wish-fulfillment 
of 
the 
unconscious; 
and 
apparently 
the 
dominating 
foreconscious 
permits 
this 
only 
after 
it 
has 
subjected 
the 
wish 
to 
some 
distortions. 
We 
are 
really 
in 
no 
position 
to 
demonstrate 
regularly 
a 
stream 
of 
thought 
antagonistic 
to 
the 
dream-wish 
which 
is 
realized 
in 
the 
dream 
as 
in 
its 
counterpart. 
Only 
now 
and 
then 
have 
we 
found 
in 
the 
dream 
traces 
of 
reaction 
formations, 
as, 
for 
instance, 
the 
tenderness 
toward 
friend 
R. 
in 
the 
"uncle 
dream." 
But 
the 
contribution 
from 
the 
foreconscious, 
which 
is 
missing 
here, 
may 
be 
found 
in 
another 
place. 
While 
the 
dominating 
system 
has 
withdrawn 
on 
the 
wish 
to 
sleep, 
the 
dream 
may 
bring 
to 
expression 
with 
manifold 
distortions 
a 
wish 
from 
the 
Unc., 
and 
realize 
this 
wish 
by 
producing 
the 
necessary 
changes 
of 
energy 
in 
the 
psychic 
apparatus, 
and 
may 
finally 
retain 
it 
through 
the 
entire 
duration 
of 
sleep.[3] 


This 
persistent 
wish 
to 
sleep 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
foreconscious 
in 
general 
facilitates 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
dream. 
Let 
us 
refer 
to 
the 
dream 
of 
the 
father 



who, 
by 
the 
gleam 
of 
light 
from 
the 
death 
chamber, 
was 
brought 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
the 
body 
has 
been 
set 
on 
fire. 
We 
have 
shown 
that 
one 
of 
the 
psychic 
forces 
decisive 
in 
causing 
the 
father 
to 
form 
this 
conclusion, 
instead 
of 
being 
awakened 
by 
the 
gleam 
of 
light, 
was 
the 
wish 
to 
prolong 
the 
life 
of 
the 
child 
seen 
in 
the 
dream 
by 
one 
moment. 
Other 
wishes 
proceeding 
from 
the 
repression 
probably 
escape 
us, 
because 
we 
are 
unable 
to 
analyze 
this 
dream. 
But 
as 
a 
second 
motive 
power 
of 
the 
dream 
we 
may 
mention 
the 
father's 
desire 
to 
sleep, 
for, 
like 
the 
life 
of 
the 
child, 
the 
sleep 
of 
the 
father 
is 
prolonged 
for 
a 
moment 
by 
the 
dream. 
The 
underlying 
motive 
is: 
"Let 
the 
dream 
go 
on, 
otherwise 
I 
must 
wake 
up." 
As 
in 
this 
dream 
so 
also 
in 
all 
other 
dreams, 
the 
wish 
to 
sleep 
lends 
its 
support 
to 
the 
unconscious 
wish. 
We 
reported 
dreams 
which 
were 
apparently 
dreams 
of 
convenience. 
But, 
properly 
speaking, 
all 
dreams 
may 
claim 
this 
designation. 
The 
efficacy 
of 
the 
wish 
to 
continue 
to 
sleep 
is 
the 
most 
easily 
recognized 
in 
the 
waking 
dreams, 
which 
so 
transform 
the 
objective 
sensory 
stimulus 
as 
to 
render 
it 
compatible 
with 
the 
continuance 
of 
sleep; 
they 
interweave 
this 
stimulus 
with 
the 
dream 
in 
order 
to 
rob 
it 
of 
any 
claims 
it 
might 
make 
as 
a 
warning 
to 
the 
outer 
world. 
But 
this 
wish 
to 
continue 
to 
sleep 
must 
also 
participate 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
all 
other 
dreams 
which 
may 
disturb 
the 
sleeping 
state 
from 
within 
only. 
"Now, 
then, 
sleep 
on; 
why, 
it's 
but 
a 
dream"; 
this 
is 
in 
many 
cases 
the 
suggestion 
of 
the 
Forec. 
to 
consciousness 
when 
the 
dream 
goes 
too 
far; 
and 
this 
also 
describes 
in 
a 
general 
way 
the 
attitude 
of 
our 
dominating 
psychic 
activity 
toward 
dreaming, 
though 
the 
thought 
remains 
tacit. 
I 
must 
draw 
the 
conclusion 
that 
throughout 
our 
entire 
sleeping 
state 
we 
are 
just 
as 
certain 
that 
we 
are 
dreaming 
as 
we 
are 
certain 
that 
we 
are 
sleeping. 
We 
are 
compelled 
to 
disregard 
the 
objection 
urged 
against 
this 
conclusion 
that 
our 
consciousness 
is 
never 
directed 
to 
a 
knowledge 
of 
the 
former, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
directed 
to 
a 
knowledge 
of 
the 
latter 
only 
on 
special 
occasions 
when 
the 
censor 
is 
unexpectedly 
surprised. 
Against 
this 
objection 
we 
may 
say 
that 
there 
are 
persons 
who 
are 
entirely 
conscious 
of 
their 
sleeping 
and 
dreaming, 
and 
who 
are 
apparently 
endowed 
with 
the 
conscious 
faculty 
of 
guiding 
their 
dream 
life. 
Such 
a 
dreamer, 
when 
dissatisfied 
with 
the 
course 
taken 
by 
the 
dream, 
breaks 
it 
off 
without 
awakening, 
and 
begins 
it 
anew 
in 
order 
to 
continue 
it 
with 
a 
different 
turn, 
like 
the 
popular 
author 
who, 
on 
request, 
gives 
a 
happier 
ending 
to 
his 
play. 
Or, 
at 
another 
time, 
if 
placed 
by 
the 
dream 
in 
a 
sexually 
exciting 
situation, 
he 
thinks 
in 
his 
sleep: 
"I 
do 
not 
care 
to 
continue 
this 
dream 
and 
exhaust 
myself 
by 
a 
pollution; 
I 
prefer 
to 
defer 
it 
in 



favor 
of 
a 
real 
situation." 


[1] 
They 
share 
this 
character 
of 
indestructibility 
with 
all 
psychic 
acts 
that 
are 
really 
unconscious--that 
is, 
with 
psychic 
acts 
belonging 
to 
the 
system 
of 
the 
unconscious 
only. 
These 
paths 
are 
constantly 
open 
and 
never 
fall 
into 
disuse; 
they 
conduct 
the 
discharge 
of 
the 
exciting 
process 
as 
often 
as 
it 
becomes 
endowed 
with 
unconscious 
excitement 
To 
speak 
metaphorically 
they 
suffer 
the 
same 
form 
of 
annihilation 
as 
the 
shades 
of 
the 
lower 
region 
in 
the 
Odyssey, 
who 
awoke 
to 
new 
life 
the 
moment 
they 
drank 
blood. 
The 
processes 
depending 
on 
the 
foreconscious 
system 
are 
destructible 
in 
a 
different 
way. 
The 
psychotherapy 
of 
the 
neuroses 
is 
based 
on 
this 
difference. 
[2] 
Le 
Lorrain 
justly 
extols 
the 
wish-fulfilment 
of 
the 
dream: 
"Sans 
fatigue 
sérieuse, 
sans 
être 
obligé 
de 
recourir 
à 
cette 
lutte 
opinâtre 
et 
longue 
qui 
use 
et 
corrode 
les 
jouissances 
poursuivies." 
[3] 
This 
idea 
has 
been 
borrowed 
from 
The 
Theory 
of 
Sleep 
by 
Liébault, 
who 
revived 
hypnotic 
investigation 
in 
our 
days.

Sommeil 
provoqué_,

VII 


THE 
FUNCTION 
OF 
THE 
DREAM 


Since 
we 
know 
that 
the 
foreconscious 
is 
suspended 
during 
the 
night 
by 
the 
wish 
to 
sleep, 
we 
can 
proceed 
to 
an 
intelligent 
investigation 
of 
the 
dream 
process. 
But 
let 
us 
first 
sum 
up 
the 
knowledge 
of 
this 
process 
already 
gained. 
We 
have 
shown 
that 
the 
waking 
activity 
leaves 
day 
remnants 
from 
which 
the 
sum 
of 
energy 
cannot 
be 
entirely 
removed; 
or 
the 
waking 
activity 
revives 
during 
the 
day 
one 
of 
the 
unconscious 
wishes; 
or 
both 
conditions 
occur 
simultaneously; 
we 
have 
already 
discovered 
the 
many 
variations 
that 
may 
take 
place. 
The 
unconscious 
wish 
has 
already 
made 
its 
way 
to 
the 
day 
remnants, 
either 
during 
the 
day 
or 
at 
any 
rate 
with 
the 
beginning 
of 
sleep, 
and 
has 
effected 
a 
transference 
to 
it. 
This 
produces 
a 
wish 
transferred 
to 
the 
recent 
material, 
or 
the 
suppressed 
recent 
wish 
comes 
to 
life 
again 
through 
a 
reinforcement 
from 
the 
unconscious. 
This 
wish 
now 
endeavors 
to 
make 
its 
way 
to 
consciousness 
on 
the 
normal 
path 
of 
the 
mental 
processes 
through 
the 
foreconscious, 
to 
which 
indeed 
it 
belongs 
through 
one 
of 
its 
constituent 
elements. 
It 
is 
confronted, 
however, 
by 
the 
censor, 
which 
is 
still 
active, 
and 
to 
the 
influence 
of 
which 
it 
now 
succumbs. 
It 
now 
takes 
on 
the 
distortion 
for 
which 
the 
way 
has 
already 
been 
paved 
by 
its 
transference 
to 
the 
recent 
material. 
Thus 
far 
it 
is 
in 
the 
way 
of 
becoming 
something 
resembling 
an 
obsession, 
delusion, 
or 
the 
like, 
_i.e._ 
a 
thought 
reinforced 
by 
a 
transference 
and 
distorted 
in 
expression 
by 
the 
censor. 
But 
its 
further 
progress 
is 
now 
checked 
through 
the 
dormant 
state 
of 
the 
foreconscious; 
this 
system 
has 
apparently 
protected 
itself 
against 
invasion 
by 
diminishing 
its 
excitements. 
The 
dream 
process, 
therefore, 
takes 
the 
regressive 
course, 
which 
has 
just 
been 
opened 
by 
the 
peculiarity 
of 
the 
sleeping 
state, 
and 
thereby 
follows 
the 
attraction 
exerted 
on 
it 
by 
the 
memory 
groups, 
which 
themselves 
exist 
in 
part 
only 
as 
visual 
energy 
not 
yet 
translated 
into 
terms 
of 
the 
later 
systems. 
On 
its 
way 
to 
regression 
the 
dream 
takes 
on 
the 
form 
of 
dramatization. 
The 
subject 
of 
compression 
will 
be 
discussed 
later. 
The 
dream 
process 
has 
now 
terminated 
the 
second 
part 
of 
its 
repeatedly 
impeded 
course. 
The 
first 
part 
expended 
itself 
progressively 
from 
the 
unconscious 
scenes 
or 
phantasies 
to 
the 
foreconscious, 
while 
the 
second 
part 
gravitates 
from 
the 
advent 
of 
the 
censor 
back 
to 
the 
perceptions. 
But 
when 
the 
dream 
process 
becomes 
a 
content 
of 
perception 
it 
has, 
so 
to 
speak, 
eluded 
the 
obstacle 
set 
up 
in 
the 
Forec. 
by 
the 
censor 
and 
by 
the 
sleeping 
state. 
It 
succeeds 
in 
drawing 



attention 
to 
itself 
and 
in 
being 
noticed 
by 
consciousness. 
For 
consciousness, 
which 
means 
to 
us 
a 
sensory 
organ 
for 
the 
reception 
of 
psychic 
qualities, 
may 
receive 
stimuli 
from 
two 
sources--first, 
from 
the 
periphery 
of 
the 
entire 
apparatus, 
viz. 
from 
the 
perception 
system, 
and, 
secondly, 
from 
the 
pleasure 
and 
pain 
stimuli, 
which 
constitute 
the 
sole 
psychic 
quality 
produced 
in 
the 
transformation 
of 
energy 
within 
the 
apparatus. 
All 
other 
processes 
in 
the 
system, 
even 
those 
in 
the 
foreconscious, 
are 
devoid 
of 
any 
psychic 
quality, 
and 
are 
therefore 
not 
objects 
of 
consciousness 
inasmuch 
as 
they 
do 
not 
furnish 
pleasure 
or 
pain 
for 
perception. 
We 
shall 
have 
to 
assume 
that 
those 
liberations 
of 
pleasure 
and 
pain 
automatically 
regulate 
the 
outlet 
of 
the 
occupation 
processes. 
But 
in 
order 
to 
make 
possible 
more 
delicate 
functions, 
it 
was 
later 
found 
necessary 
to 
render 
the 
course 
of 
the 
presentations 
more 
independent 
of 
the 
manifestations 
of 
pain. 
To 
accomplish 
this 
the 
Forec. 
system 
needed 
some 
qualities 
of 
its 
own 
which 
could 
attract 
consciousness, 
and 
most 
probably 
received 
them 
through 
the 
connection 
of 
the 
foreconscious 
processes 
with 
the 
memory 
system 
of 
the 
signs 
of 
speech, 
which 
is 
not 
devoid 
of 
qualities. 
Through 
the 
qualities 
of 
this 
system, 
consciousness, 
which 
had 
hitherto 
been 
a 
sensory 
organ 
only 
for 
the 
perceptions, 
now 
becomes 
also 
a 
sensory 
organ 
for 
a 
part 
of 
our 
mental 
processes. 
Thus 
we 
have 
now, 
as 
it 
were, 
two 
sensory 
surfaces, 
one 
directed 
to 
perceptions 
and 
the 
other 
to 
the 
foreconscious 
mental 
processes. 


I 
must 
assume 
that 
the 
sensory 
surface 
of 
consciousness 
devoted 
to 
the 
Forec. 
is 
rendered 
less 
excitable 
by 
sleep 
than 
that 
directed 
to 
the 
P-systems. 
The 
giving 
up 
of 
interest 
for 
the 
nocturnal 
mental 
processes 
is 
indeed 
purposeful. 
Nothing 
is 
to 
disturb 
the 
mind; 
the 
Forec. 
wants 
to 
sleep. 
But 
once 
the 
dream 
becomes 
a 
perception, 
it 
is 
then 
capable 
of 
exciting 
consciousness 
through 
the 
qualities 
thus 
gained. 
The 
sensory 
stimulus 
accomplishes 
what 
it 
was 
really 
destined 
for, 
namely, 
it 
directs 
a 
part 
of 
the 
energy 
at 
the 
disposal 
of 
the 
Forec. 
in 
the 
form 
of 
attention 
upon 
the 
stimulant. 
We 
must, 
therefore, 
admit 
that 
the 
dream 
invariably 
awakens 
us, 
that 
is, 
it 
puts 
into 
activity 
a 
part 
of 
the 
dormant 
force 
of 
the 
Forec. 
This 
force 
imparts 
to 
the 
dream 
that 
influence 
which 
we 
have 
designated 
as 
secondary 
elaboration 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
connection 
and 
comprehensibility. 
This 
means 
that 
the 
dream 
is 
treated 
by 
it 
like 
any 
other 
content 
of 
perception; 
it 
is 
subjected 
to 
the 
same 
ideas 
of 
expectation, 
as 
far 
at 
least 
as 
the 
material 
admits. 
As 
far 
as 
the 
direction 
is 
concerned 
in 
this 
third 
part 
of 
the 
dream, 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
here 
again 
the 



movement 
is 
progressive. 


To 
avoid 
misunderstanding, 
it 
will 
not 
be 
amiss 
to 
say 
a 
few 
words 
about 
the 
temporal 
peculiarities 
of 
these 
dream 
processes. 
In 
a 
very 
interesting 
discussion, 
apparently 
suggested 
by 
Maury's 
puzzling 
guillotine 
dream, 
Goblet 
tries 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
the 
dream 
requires 
no 
other 
time 
than 
the 
transition 
period 
between 
sleeping 
and 
awakening. 
The 
awakening 
requires 
time, 
as 
the 
dream 
takes 
place 
during 
that 
period. 
One 
is 
inclined 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
final 
picture 
of 
the 
dream 
is 
so 
strong 
that 
it 
forces 
the 
dreamer 
to 
awaken; 
but, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
this 
picture 
is 
strong 
only 
because 
the 
dreamer 
is 
already 
very 
near 
awakening 
when 
it 
appears. 
"Un 
rêve 
c'est 
un 
réveil 
qui 
commence." 


It 
has 
already 
been 
emphasized 
by 
Dugas 
that 
Goblet 
was 
forced 
to 
repudiate 
many 
facts 
in 
order 
to 
generalize 
his 
theory. 
There 
are, 
moreover, 
dreams 
from 
which 
we 
do 
not 
awaken, 
_e.g._, 
some 
dreams 
in 
which 
we 
dream 
that 
we 
dream. 
From 
our 
knowledge 
of 
the 
dream-work, 
we 
can 
by 
no 
means 
admit 
that 
it 
extends 
only 
over 
the 
period 
of 
awakening. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
we 
must 
consider 
it 
probable 
that 
the 
first 
part 
of 
the 
dream-work 
begins 
during 
the 
day 
when 
we 
are 
still 
under 
the 
domination 
of 
the 
foreconscious. 
The 
second 
phase 
of 
the 
dream-work, 
viz. 
the 
modification 
through 
the 
censor, 
the 
attraction 
by 
the 
unconscious 
scenes, 
and 
the 
penetration 
to 
perception 
must 
continue 
throughout 
the 
night. 
And 
we 
are 
probably 
always 
right 
when 
we 
assert 
that 
we 
feel 
as 
though 
we 
had 
been 
dreaming 
the 
whole 
night, 
although 
we 
cannot 
say 
what. 
I 
do 
not, 
however, 
think 
it 
necessary 
to 
assume 
that, 
up 
to 
the 
time 
of 
becoming 
conscious, 
the 
dream 
processes 
really 
follow 
the 
temporal 
sequence 
which 
we 
have 
described, 
viz. 
that 
there 
is 
first 
the 
transferred 
dream-wish, 
then 
the 
distortion 
of 
the 
censor, 
and 
consequently 
the 
change 
of 
direction 
to 
regression, 
and 
so 
on. 
We 
were 
forced 
to 
form 
such 
a 
succession 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
_description_; 
in 
reality, 
however, 
it 
is 
much 
rather 
a 
matter 
of 
simultaneously 
trying 
this 
path 
and 
that, 
and 
of 
emotions 
fluctuating 
to 
and 
fro, 
until 
finally, 
owing 
to 
the 
most 
expedient 
distribution, 
one 
particular 
grouping 
is 
secured 
which 
remains. 
From 
certain 
personal 
experiences, 
I 
am 
myself 
inclined 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
dream-work 
often 
requires 
more 
than 
one 
day 
and 
one 
night 
to 
produce 
its 
result; 
if 
this 
be 
true, 
the 
extraordinary 
art 
manifested 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
dream 
loses 
all 
its 
marvels. 
In 
my 
opinion, 
even 
the 
regard 
for 
comprehensibility 
as 
an 
occurrence 
of 
perception 
may 
take 
effect 
before 
the 
dream 
attracts 



consciousness 
to 
itself. 
To 
be 
sure, 
from 
now 
on 
the 
process 
is 
accelerated, 
as 
the 
dream 
is 
henceforth 
subjected 
to 
the 
same 
treatment 
as 
any 
other 
perception. 
It 
is 
like 
fireworks, 
which 
require 
hours 
of 
preparation 
and 
only 
a 
moment 
for 
ignition. 


Through 
the 
dream-work 
the 
dream 
process 
now 
gains 
either 
sufficient 
intensity 
to 
attract 
consciousness 
to 
itself 
and 
arouse 
the 
foreconscious, 
which 
is 
quite 
independent 
of 
the 
time 
or 
profundity 
of 
sleep, 
or, 
its 
intensity 
being 
insufficient 
it 
must 
wait 
until 
it 
meets 
the 
attention 
which 
is 
set 
in 
motion 
immediately 
before 
awakening. 
Most 
dreams 
seem 
to 
operate 
with 
relatively 
slight 
psychic 
intensities, 
for 
they 
wait 
for 
the 
awakening. 
This, 
however, 
explains 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
regularly 
perceive 
something 
dreamt 
on 
being 
suddenly 
aroused 
from 
a 
sound 
sleep. 
Here, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
spontaneous 
awakening, 
the 
first 
glance 
strikes 
the 
perception 
content 
created 
by 
the 
dream-work, 
while 
the 
next 
strikes 
the 
one 
produced 
from 
without. 


But 
of 
greater 
theoretical 
interest 
are 
those 
dreams 
which 
are 
capable 
of 
waking 
us 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
sleep. 
We 
must 
bear 
in 
mind 
the 
expediency 
elsewhere 
universally 
demonstrated, 
and 
ask 
ourselves 
why 
the 
dream 
or 
the 
unconscious 
wish 
has 
the 
power 
to 
disturb 
sleep, 
_i.e._ 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
the 
foreconscious 
wish. 
This 
is 
probably 
due 
to 
certain 
relations 
of 
energy 
into 
which 
we 
have 
no 
insight. 
If 
we 
possessed 
such 
insight 
we 
should 
probably 
find 
that 
the 
freedom 
given 
to 
the 
dream 
and 
the 
expenditure 
of 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
detached 
attention 
represent 
for 
the 
dream 
an 
economy 
in 
energy, 
keeping 
in 
view 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
unconscious 
must 
be 
held 
in 
check 
at 
night 
just 
as 
during 
the 
day. 
We 
know 
from 
experience 
that 
the 
dream, 
even 
if 
it 
interrupts 
sleep, 
repeatedly 
during 
the 
same 
night, 
still 
remains 
compatible 
with 
sleep. 
We 
wake 
up 
for 
an 
instant, 
and 
immediately 
resume 
our 
sleep. 
It 
is 
like 
driving 
off 
a 
fly 
during 
sleep, 
we 
awake 
ad 
hoc, 
and 
when 
we 
resume 
our 
sleep 
we 
have 
removed 
the 
disturbance. 
As 
demonstrated 
by 
familiar 
examples 
from 
the 
sleep 
of 
wet 
nurses, 
&c., 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
the 
wish 
to 
sleep 
is 
quite 
compatible 
with 
the 
retention 
of 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
attention 
in 
a 
given 
direction. 


But 
we 
must 
here 
take 
cognizance 
of 
an 
objection 
that 
is 
based 
on 
a 
better 
knowledge 
of 
the 
unconscious 
processes. 
Although 
we 
have 
ourselves 
described 
the 
unconscious 
wishes 
as 
always 
active, 
we 
have, 
nevertheless, 
asserted 
that 
they 
are 
not 
sufficiently 
strong 
during 
the 
day 
to 
make 



themselves 
perceptible. 
But 
when 
we 
sleep, 
and 
the 
unconscious 
wish 
has 
shown 
its 
power 
to 
form 
a 
dream, 
and 
with 
it 
to 
awaken 
the 
foreconscious, 
why, 
then, 
does 
this 
power 
become 
exhausted 
after 
the 
dream 
has 
been 
taken 
cognizance 
of? 
Would 
it 
not 
seem 
more 
probable 
that 
the 
dream 
should 
continually 
renew 
itself, 
like 
the 
troublesome 
fly 
which, 
when 
driven 
away, 
takes 
pleasure 
in 
returning 
again 
and 
again? 
What 
justifies 
our 
assertion 
that 
the 
dream 
removes 
the 
disturbance 
of 
sleep? 


That 
the 
unconscious 
wishes 
always 
remain 
active 
is 
quite 
true. 
They 
represent 
paths 
which 
are 
passable 
whenever 
a 
sum 
of 
excitement 
makes 
use 
of 
them. 
Moreover, 
a 
remarkable 
peculiarity 
of 
the 
unconscious 
processes 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
remain 
indestructible. 
Nothing 
can 
be 
brought 
to 
an 
end 
in 
the 
unconscious; 
nothing 
can 
cease 
or 
be 
forgotten. 
This 
impression 
is 
most 
strongly 
gained 
in 
the 
study 
of 
the 
neuroses, 
especially 
of 
hysteria. 
The 
unconscious 
stream 
of 
thought 
which 
leads 
to 
the 
discharge 
through 
an 
attack 
becomes 
passable 
again 
as 
soon 
as 
there 
is 
an 
accumulation 
of 
a 
sufficient 
amount 
of 
excitement. 
The 
mortification 
brought 
on 
thirty 
years 
ago, 
after 
having 
gained 
access 
to 
the 
unconscious 
affective 
source, 
operates 
during 
all 
these 
thirty 
years 
like 
a 
recent 
one. 
Whenever 
its 
memory 
is 
touched, 
it 
is 
revived 
and 
shows 
itself 
to 
be 
supplied 
with 
the 
excitement 
which 
is 
discharged 
in 
a 
motor 
attack. 
It 
is 
just 
here 
that 
the 
office 
of 
psychotherapy 
begins, 
its 
task 
being 
to 
bring 
about 
adjustment 
and 
forgetfulness 
for 
the 
unconscious 
processes. 
Indeed, 
the 
fading 
of 
memories 
and 
the 
flagging 
of 
affects, 
which 
we 
are 
apt 
to 
take 
as 
self-evident 
and 
to 
explain 
as 
a 
primary 
influence 
of 
time 
on 
the 
psychic 
memories, 
are 
in 
reality 
secondary 
changes 
brought 
about 
by 
painstaking 
work. 
It 
is 
the 
foreconscious 
that 
accomplishes 
this 
work; 
and 
the 
only 
course 
to 
be 
pursued 
by 
psychotherapy 
is 
the 
subjugate 
the 
Unc, 
to 
the 
domination 
of 
the 
Forec. 


There 
are, 
therefore, 
two 
exits 
for 
the 
individual 
unconscious 
emotional 
process. 
It 
is 
either 
left 
to 
itself, 
in 
which 
case 
it 
ultimately 
breaks 
through 
somewhere 
and 
secures 
for 
once 
a 
discharge 
for 
its 
excitation 
into 
motility; 
or 
it 
succumbs 
to 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
foreconscious, 
and 
its 
excitation 
becomes 
confined 
through 
this 
influence 
instead 
of 
being 
discharged. 
It 
is 
the 
latter 
process 
that 
occurs 
in 
the 
dream. 
Owing 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
is 
directed 
by 
the 
conscious 
excitement, 
the 
energy 
from 
the 
Forec., 
which 
confronts 
the 
dream 
when 
grown 
to 
perception, 
restricts 
the 
unconscious 
excitement 
of 
the 
dream 
and 
renders 
it 
harmless 
as 
a 
disturbing 
factor. 
When 
the 
dreamer 
wakes 
up 



for 
a 
moment, 
he 
has 
actually 
chased 
away 
the 
fly 
that 
has 
threatened 
to 
disturb 
his 
sleep. 
We 
can 
now 
understand 
that 
it 
is 
really 
more 
expedient 
and 
economical 
to 
give 
full 
sway 
to 
the 
unconscious 
wish, 
and 
clear 
its 
way 
to 
regression 
so 
that 
it 
may 
form 
a 
dream, 
and 
then 
restrict 
and 
adjust 
this 
dream 
by 
means 
of 
a 
small 
expenditure 
of 
foreconscious 
labor, 
than 
to 
curb 
the 
unconscious 
throughout 
the 
entire 
period 
of 
sleep. 
We 
should, 
indeed, 
expect 
that 
the 
dream, 
even 
if 
it 
was 
not 
originally 
an 
expedient 
process, 
would 
have 
acquired 
some 
function 
in 
the 
play 
of 
forces 
of 
the 
psychic 
life. 
We 
now 
see 
what 
this 
function 
is. 
The 
dream 
has 
taken 
it 
upon 
itself 
to 
bring 
the 
liberated 
excitement 
of 
the 
Unc. 
back 
under 
the 
domination 
of 
the 
foreconscious; 
it 
thus 
affords 
relief 
for 
the 
excitement 
of 
the 
Unc. 
and 
acts 
as 
a 
safety-valve 
for 
the 
latter, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
it 
insures 
the 
sleep 
of 
the 
foreconscious 
at 
a 
slight 
expenditure 
of 
the 
waking 
state. 
Like 
the 
other 
psychic 
formations 
of 
its 
group, 
the 
dream 
offers 
itself 
as 
a 
compromise 
serving 
simultaneously 
both 
systems 
by 
fulfilling 
both 
wishes 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
are 
compatible 
with 
each 
other. 
A 
glance 
at 
Robert's 
"elimination 
theory," 
will 
show 
that 
we 
must 
agree 
with 
this 
author 
in 
his 
main 
point, 
viz. 
in 
the 
determination 
of 
the 
function 
of 
the 
dream, 
though 
we 
differ 
from 
him 
in 
our 
hypotheses 
and 
in 
our 
treatment 
of 
the 
dream 
process. 


The 
above 
qualification--in 
so 
far 
as 
the 
two 
wishes 
are 
compatible 
with 
each 
other--contains 
a 
suggestion 
that 
there 
may 
be 
cases 
in 
which 
the 
function 
of 
the 
dream 
suffers 
shipwreck. 
The 
dream 
process 
is 
in 
the 
first 
instance 
admitted 
as 
a 
wish-fulfillment 
of 
the 
unconscious, 
but 
if 
this 
tentative 
wish-
fulfillment 
disturbs 
the 
foreconscious 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
that 
the 
latter 
can 
no 
longer 
maintain 
its 
rest, 
the 
dream 
then 
breaks 
the 
compromise 
and 
fails 
to 
perform 
the 
second 
part 
of 
its 
task. 
It 
is 
then 
at 
once 
broken 
off, 
and 
replaced 
by 
complete 
wakefulness. 
Here, 
too, 
it 
is 
not 
really 
the 
fault 
of 
the 
dream, 
if, 
while 
ordinarily 
the 
guardian 
of 
sleep, 
it 
is 
here 
compelled 
to 
appear 
as 
the 
disturber 
of 
sleep, 
nor 
should 
this 
cause 
us 
to 
entertain 
any 
doubts 
as 
to 
its 
efficacy. 
This 
is 
not 
the 
only 
case 
in 
the 
organism 
in 
which 
an 
otherwise 
efficacious 
arrangement 
became 
inefficacious 
and 
disturbing 
as 
soon 
as 
some 
element 
is 
changed 
in 
the 
conditions 
of 
its 
origin; 
the 
disturbance 
then 
serves 
at 
least 
the 
new 
purpose 
of 
announcing 
the 
change, 
and 
calling 
into 
play 
against 
it 
the 
means 
of 
adjustment 
of 
the 
organism. 
In 
this 
connection, 
I 
naturally 
bear 
in 
mind 
the 
case 
of 
the 
anxiety 
dream, 
and 
in 
order 
not 
to 
have 
the 
appearance 
of 
trying 
to 
exclude 
this 
testimony 
against 
the 
theory 
of 
wish



fulfillment 
wherever 
I 
encounter 
it, 
I 
will 
attempt 
an 
explanation 
of 
the 
anxiety 
dream, 
at 
least 
offering 
some 
suggestions. 


That 
a 
psychic 
process 
developing 
anxiety 
may 
still 
be 
a 
wish-fulfillment 
has 
long 
ceased 
to 
impress 
us 
as 
a 
contradiction. 
We 
may 
explain 
this 
occurrence 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
wish 
belongs 
to 
one 
system 
(the 
Unc.), 
while 
by 
the 
other 
system 
(the 
Forec.), 
this 
wish 
has 
been 
rejected 
and 
suppressed. 
The 
subjection 
of 
the 
Unc. 
by 
the 
Forec. 
is 
not 
complete 
even 
in 
perfect 
psychic 
health; 
the 
amount 
of 
this 
suppression 
shows 
the 
degree 
of 
our 
psychic 
normality. 
Neurotic 
symptoms 
show 
that 
there 
is 
a 
conflict 
between 
the 
two 
systems; 
the 
symptoms 
are 
the 
results 
of 
a 
compromise 
of 
this 
conflict, 
and 
they 
temporarily 
put 
an 
end 
to 
it. 
On 
the 
one 
hand, 
they 
afford 
the 
Unc. 
an 
outlet 
for 
the 
discharge 
of 
its 
excitement, 
and 
serve 
it 
as 
a 
sally 
port, 
while, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
they 
give 
the 
Forec. 
the 
capability 
of 
dominating 
the 
Unc. 
to 
some 
extent. 
It 
is 
highly 
instructive 
to 
consider, 
_e.g._, 
the 
significance 
of 
any 
hysterical 
phobia 
or 
of 
an 
agoraphobia. 
Suppose 
a 
neurotic 
incapable 
of 
crossing 
the 
street 
alone, 
which 
we 
would 
justly 
call 
a 
"symptom." 
We 
attempt 
to 
remove 
this 
symptom 
by 
urging 
him 
to 
the 
action 
which 
he 
deems 
himself 
incapable 
of. 
The 
result 
will 
be 
an 
attack 
of 
anxiety, 
just 
as 
an 
attack 
of 
anxiety 
in 
the 
street 
has 
often 
been 
the 
cause 
of 
establishing 
an 
agoraphobia. 
We 
thus 
learn 
that 
the 
symptom 
has 
been 
constituted 
in 
order 
to 
guard 
against 
the 
outbreak 
of 
the 
anxiety. 
The 
phobia 
is 
thrown 
before 
the 
anxiety 
like 
a 
fortress 
on 
the 
frontier. 


Unless 
we 
enter 
into 
the 
part 
played 
by 
the 
affects 
in 
these 
processes, 
which 
can 
be 
done 
here 
only 
imperfectly, 
we 
cannot 
continue 
our 
discussion. 
Let 
us 
therefore 
advance 
the 
proposition 
that 
the 
reason 
why 
the 
suppression 
of 
the 
unconscious 
becomes 
absolutely 
necessary 
is 
because, 
if 
the 
discharge 
of 
presentation 
should 
be 
left 
to 
itself, 
it 
would 
develop 
an 
affect 
in 
the 
Unc. 
which 
originally 
bore 
the 
character 
of 
pleasure, 
but 
which, 
since 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
repression, 
bears 
the 
character 
of 
pain. 
The 
aim, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
result, 
of 
the 
suppression 
is 
to 
stop 
the 
development 
of 
this 
pain. 
The 
suppression 
extends 
over 
the 
unconscious 
ideation, 
because 
the 
liberation 
of 
pain 
might 
emanate 
from 
the 
ideation. 
The 
foundation 
is 
here 
laid 
for 
a 
very 
definite 
assumption 
concerning 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
affective 
development. 
It 
is 
regarded 
as 
a 
motor 
or 
secondary 
activity, 
the 
key 
to 
the 
innervation 
of 
which 
is 
located 
in 
the 
presentations 
of 
the 
Unc. 
Through 
the 
domination 
of 
the 
Forec. 
these 
presentations 
become, 
as 
it 
were, 
throttled 
and 
inhibited 
at 
the 



exit 
of 
the 
emotion-developing 
impulses. 
The 
danger, 
which 
is 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Forec. 
ceases 
to 
occupy 
the 
energy, 
therefore 
consists 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
unconscious 
excitations 
liberate 
such 
an 
affect 
as--in 
consequence 
of 
the 
repression 
that 
has 
previously 
taken 
place--can 
only 
be 
perceived 
as 
pain 
or 
anxiety. 


This 
danger 
is 
released 
through 
the 
full 
sway 
of 
the 
dream 
process. 
The 
determinations 
for 
its 
realization 
consist 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
repressions 
have 
taken 
place, 
and 
that 
the 
suppressed 
emotional 
wishes 
shall 
become 
sufficiently 
strong. 
They 
thus 
stand 
entirely 
without 
the 
psychological 
realm 
of 
the 
dream 
structure. 
Were 
it 
not 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
our 
subject 
is 
connected 
through 
just 
one 
factor, 
namely, 
the 
freeing 
of 
the 
Unc. 
during 
sleep, 
with 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
development 
of 
anxiety, 
I 
could 
dispense 
with 
discussion 
of 
the 
anxiety 
dream, 
and 
thus 
avoid 
all 
obscurities 
connected 
with 
it. 


As 
I 
have 
often 
repeated, 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
anxiety 
belongs 
to 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
neuroses. 
I 
would 
say 
that 
the 
anxiety 
in 
the 
dream 
is 
an 
anxiety 
problem 
and 
not 
a 
dream 
problem. 
We 
have 
nothing 
further 
to 
do 
with 
it 
after 
having 
once 
demonstrated 
its 
point 
of 
contact 
with 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
dream 
process. 
There 
is 
only 
one 
thing 
left 
for 
me 
to 
do. 
As 
I 
have 
asserted 
that 
the 
neurotic 
anxiety 
originates 
from 
sexual 
sources, 
I 
can 
subject 
anxiety 
dreams 
to 
analysis 
in 
order 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
sexual 
material 
in 
their 
dream 
thoughts. 


For 
good 
reasons 
I 
refrain 
from 
citing 
here 
any 
of 
the 
numerous 
examples 
placed 
at 
my 
disposal 
by 
neurotic 
patients, 
but 
prefer 
to 
give 
anxiety 
dreams 
from 
young 
persons. 


Personally, 
I 
have 
had 
no 
real 
anxiety 
dream 
for 
decades, 
but 
I 
recall 
one 
from 
my 
seventh 
or 
eighth 
year 
which 
I 
subjected 
to 
interpretation 
about 
thirty 
years 
later. 
The 
dream 
was 
very 
vivid, 
and 
showed 
me 
_my 
beloved 
mother, 
with 
peculiarly 
calm 
sleeping 
countenance, 
carried 
into 
the 
room 
and 
laid 
on 
the 
bed 
by 
two 
(or 
three) 
persons 
with 
birds' 
beaks_. 
I 
awoke 
crying 
and 
screaming, 
and 
disturbed 
my 
parents. 
The 
very 
tall 
figures--draped 
in 
a 
peculiar 
manner--with 
beaks, 
I 
had 
taken 
from 
the 
illustrations 
of 
Philippson's 
bible; 
I 
believe 
they 
represented 
deities 
with 
heads 
of 
sparrowhawks 
from 
an 
Egyptian 
tomb 
relief. 
The 
analysis 
also 
introduced 
the 
reminiscence 
of 
a 
naughty 
janitor's 
boy, 
who 
used 
to 
play 
with 
us 
children 
on 
the 
meadow 
in 



front 
of 
the 
house; 
I 
would 
add 
that 
his 
name 
was 
Philip. 
I 
feel 
that 
I 
first 
heard 
from 
this 
boy 
the 
vulgar 
word 
signifying 
sexual 
intercourse, 
which 
is 
replaced 
among 
the 
educated 
by 
the 
Latin 
"coitus," 
but 
to 
which 
the 
dream 
distinctly 
alludes 
by 
the 
selection 
of 
the 
birds' 
heads. 
I 
must 
have 
suspected 
the 
sexual 
significance 
of 
the 
word 
from 
the 
facial 
expression 
of 
my 
worldly-
wise 
teacher. 
My 
mother's 
features 
in 
the 
dream 
were 
copied 
from 
the 
countenance 
of 
my 
grandfather, 
whom 
I 
had 
seen 
a 
few 
days 
before 
his 
death 
snoring 
in 
the 
state 
of 
coma. 
The 
interpretation 
of 
the 
secondary 
elaboration 
in 
the 
dream 
must 
therefore 
have 
been 
that 
my 
mother 
was 
dying; 
the 
tomb 
relief, 
too, 
agrees 
with 
this. 
In 
this 
anxiety 
I 
awoke, 
and 
could 
not 
calm 
myself 
until 
I 
had 
awakened 
my 
parents. 
I 
remember 
that 
I 
suddenly 
became 
calm 
on 
coming 
face 
to 
face 
with 
my 
mother, 
as 
if 
I 
needed 
the 
assurance 
that 
my 
mother 
was 
not 
dead. 
But 
this 
secondary 
interpretation 
of 
the 
dream 
had 
been 
effected 
only 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
developed 
anxiety. 
I 
was 
not 
frightened 
because 
I 
dreamed 
that 
my 
mother 
was 
dying, 
but 
I 
interpreted 
the 
dream 
in 
this 
manner 
in 
the 
foreconscious 
elaboration 
because 
I 
was 
already 
under 
the 
domination 
of 
the 
anxiety. 
The 
latter, 
however, 
could 
be 
traced 
by 
means 
of 
the 
repression 
to 
an 
obscure 
obviously 
sexual 
desire, 
which 
had 
found 
its 
satisfying 
expression 
in 
the 
visual 
content 
of 
the 
dream. 


A 
man 
twenty-seven 
years 
old 
who 
had 
been 
severely 
ill 
for 
a 
year 
had 
had 
many 
terrifying 
dreams 
between 
the 
ages 
of 
eleven 
and 
thirteen. 
He 
thought 
that 
a 
man 
with 
an 
ax 
was 
running 
after 
him; 
he 
wished 
to 
run, 
but 
felt 
paralyzed 
and 
could 
not 
move 
from 
the 
spot. 
This 
may 
be 
taken 
as 
a 
good 
example 
of 
a 
very 
common, 
and 
apparently 
sexually 
indifferent, 
anxiety 
dream. 
In 
the 
analysis 
the 
dreamer 
first 
thought 
of 
a 
story 
told 
him 
by 
his 
uncle, 
which 
chronologically 
was 
later 
than 
the 
dream, 
viz. 
that 
he 
was 
attacked 
at 
night 
by 
a 
suspicious-looking 
individual. 
This 
occurrence 
led 
him 
to 
believe 
that 
he 
himself 
might 
have 
already 
heard 
of 
a 
similar 
episode 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
dream. 
In 
connection 
with 
the 
ax 
he 
recalled 
that 
during 
that 
period 
of 
his 
life 
he 
once 
hurt 
his 
hand 
with 
an 
ax 
while 
chopping 
wood. 
This 
immediately 
led 
to 
his 
relations 
with 
his 
younger 
brother, 
whom 
he 
used 
to 
maltreat 
and 
knock 
down. 
In 
particular, 
he 
recalled 
an 
occasion 
when 
he 
struck 
his 
brother 
on 
the 
head 
with 
his 
boot 
until 
he 
bled, 
whereupon 
his 
mother 
remarked: 
"I 
fear 
he 
will 
kill 
him 
some 
day." 
While 
he 
was 
seemingly 
thinking 
of 
the 
subject 
of 
violence, 
a 
reminiscence 
from 
his 
ninth 
year 
suddenly 
occurred 
to 
him. 
His 
parents 
came 
home 
late 
and 
went 
to 
bed 
while 



he 
was 
feigning 
sleep. 
He 
soon 
heard 
panting 
and 
other 
noises 
that 
appeared 
strange 
to 
him, 
and 
he 
could 
also 
make 
out 
the 
position 
of 
his 
parents 
in 
bed. 
His 
further 
associations 
showed 
that 
he 
had 
established 
an 
analogy 
between 
this 
relation 
between 
his 
parents 
and 
his 
own 
relation 
toward 
his 
younger 
brother. 
He 
subsumed 
what 
occurred 
between 
his 
parents 
under 
the 
conception 
"violence 
and 
wrestling," 
and 
thus 
reached 
a 
sadistic 
conception 
of 
the 
coitus 
act, 
as 
often 
happens 
among 
children. 
The 
fact 
that 
he 
often 
noticed 
blood 
on 
his 
mother's 
bed 
corroborated 
his 
conception. 


That 
the 
sexual 
intercourse 
of 
adults 
appears 
strange 
to 
children 
who 
observe 
it, 
and 
arouses 
fear 
in 
them, 
I 
dare 
say 
is 
a 
fact 
of 
daily 
experience. 
I 
have 
explained 
this 
fear 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
sexual 
excitement 
is 
not 
mastered 
by 
their 
understanding, 
and 
is 
probably 
also 
inacceptable 
to 
them 
because 
their 
parents 
are 
involved 
in 
it. 
For 
the 
same 
son 
this 
excitement 
is 
converted 
into 
fear. 
At 
a 
still 
earlier 
period 
of 
life 
sexual 
emotion 
directed 
toward 
the 
parent 
of 
opposite 
sex 
does 
not 
meet 
with 
repression 
but 
finds 
free 
expression, 
as 
we 
have 
seen 
before. 


For 
the 
night 
terrors 
with 
hallucinations 
(_pavor 
nocturnus_) 
frequently 
found 
in 
children, 
I 
would 
unhesitatingly 
give 
the 
same 
explanation. 
Here, 
too, 
we 
are 
certainly 
dealing 
with 
the 
incomprehensible 
and 
rejected 
sexual 
feelings, 
which, 
if 
noted, 
would 
probably 
show 
a 
temporal 
periodicity, 
for 
an 
enhancement 
of 
the 
sexual 
libido 
may 
just 
as 
well 
be 
produced 
accidentally 
through 
emotional 
impressions 
as 
through 
the 
spontaneous 
and 
gradual 
processes 
of 
development. 


I 
lack 
the 
necessary 
material 
to 
sustain 
these 
explanations 
from 
observation. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
pediatrists 
seem 
to 
lack 
the 
point 
of 
view 
which 
alone 
makes 
comprehensible 
the 
whole 
series 
of 
phenomena, 
on 
the 
somatic 
as 
well 
as 
on 
the 
psychic 
side. 
To 
illustrate 
by 
a 
comical 
example 
how 
one 
wearing 
the 
blinders 
of 
medical 
mythology 
may 
miss 
the 
understanding 
of 
such 
cases 
I 
will 
relate 
a 
case 
which 
I 
found 
in 
a 
thesis 
on 
pavor 
nocturnus 
by 
Debacker, 
1881. 
A 
thirteen-year-old 
boy 
of 
delicate 
health 
began 
to 
become 
anxious 
and 
dreamy; 
his 
sleep 
became 
restless, 
and 
about 
once 
a 
week 
it 
was 
interrupted 
by 
an 
acute 
attack 
of 
anxiety 
with 
hallucinations. 
The 
memory 
of 
these 
dreams 
was 
invariably 
very 
distinct. 
Thus, 
he 
related 
that 
the 
devil 
shouted 
at 
him: 
"Now 
we 
have 
you, 
now 
we 
have 
you," 
and 
this 
was 
followed 
by 
an 
odor 
of 
sulphur; 
the 
fire 
burned 
his 
skin. 
This 
dream 
aroused 
him, 
terror



stricken. 
He 
was 
unable 
to 
scream 
at 
first; 
then 
his 
voice 
returned, 
and 
he 
was 
heard 
to 
say 
distinctly: 
"No, 
no, 
not 
me; 
why, 
I 
have 
done 
nothing," 
or, 
"Please 
don't, 
I 
shall 
never 
do 
it 
again." 
Occasionally, 
also, 
he 
said: 
"Albert 
has 
not 
done 
that." 
Later 
he 
avoided 
undressing, 
because, 
as 
he 
said, 
the 
fire 
attacked 
him 
only 
when 
he 
was 
undressed. 
From 
amid 
these 
evil 
dreams, 
which 
menaced 
his 
health, 
he 
was 
sent 
into 
the 
country, 
where 
he 
recovered 
within 
a 
year 
and 
a 
half, 
but 
at 
the 
age 
of 
fifteen 
he 
once 
confessed: 
"Je 
n'osais 
pas 
l'avouer, 
mais 
j'éprouvais 
continuellement 
des 
picotements 
et 
des 
surexcitations 
aux 
_parties_; 
à 
la 
fin, 
cela 
m'énervait 
tant 
que 
plusieurs 
fois, 
j'ai 
pensé 
me 
jeter 
par 
la 
fenêtre 
au 
dortoir." 


It 
is 
certainly 
not 
difficult 
to 
suspect: 
1, 
that 
the 
boy 
had 
practiced 
masturbation 
in 
former 
years, 
that 
he 
probably 
denied 
it, 
and 
was 
threatened 
with 
severe 
punishment 
for 
his 
wrongdoing 
(his 
confession: 
Je 
ne 
le 
ferai 
plus; 
his 
denial: 
Albert 
n'a 
jamais 
fait 
ça). 
2, 
That 
under 
the 
pressure 
of 
puberty 
the 
temptation 
to 
self-abuse 
through 
the 
tickling 
of 
the 
genitals 
was 
reawakened. 
3, 
That 
now, 
however, 
a 
struggle 
of 
repression 
arose 
in 
him, 
suppressing 
the 
libido 
and 
changing 
it 
into 
fear, 
which 
subsequently 
took 
the 
form 
of 
the 
punishments 
with 
which 
he 
was 
then 
threatened. 


Let 
us, 
however, 
quote 
the 
conclusions 
drawn 
by 
our 
author. 
This 
observation 
shows: 
1, 
That 
the 
influence 
of 
puberty 
may 
produce 
in 
a 
boy 
of 
delicate 
health 
a 
condition 
of 
extreme 
weakness, 
and 
that 
it 
may 
lead 
to 
a 
_very 
marked 
cerebral 
anæmia_. 


2. 
This 
cerebral 
anæmia 
produces 
a 
transformation 
of 
character, 
demonomaniacal 
hallucinations, 
and 
very 
violent 
nocturnal, 
perhaps 
also 
diurnal, 
states 
of 
anxiety. 
3. 
Demonomania 
and 
the 
self-reproaches 
of 
the 
day 
can 
be 
traced 
to 
the 
influences 
of 
religious 
education 
which 
the 
subject 
underwent 
as 
a 
child. 
4. 
All 
manifestations 
disappeared 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a 
lengthy 
sojourn 
in 
the 
country, 
bodily 
exercise, 
and 
the 
return 
of 
physical 
strength 
after 
the 
termination 
of 
the 
period 
of 
puberty. 
5. 
A 
predisposing 
influence 
for 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
cerebral 
condition 
of 
the 
boy 
may 
be 
attributed 
to 
heredity 
and 
to 
the 
father's 
chronic 
syphilitic 
state. 

The 
concluding 
remarks 
of 
the 
author 
read: 
"Nous 
avons 
fait 
entrer 
cette 
observation 
dans 
le 
cadre 
des 
délires 
apyrétiques 
d'inanition, 
car 
c'est 
à 
l'ischémie 
cérébrale 
que 
nous 
rattachons 
cet 
état 
particulier." 



VIII 


THE 
PRIMARY 
AND 
SECONDARY 
PROCESS--REGRESSION 


In 
venturing 
to 
attempt 
to 
penetrate 
more 
deeply 
into 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
dream 
processes, 
I 
have 
undertaken 
a 
difficult 
task, 
to 
which, 
indeed, 
my 
power 
of 
description 
is 
hardly 
equal. 
To 
reproduce 
in 
description 
by 
a 
succession 
of 
words 
the 
simultaneousness 
of 
so 
complex 
a 
chain 
of 
events, 
and 
in 
doing 
so 
to 
appear 
unbiassed 
throughout 
the 
exposition, 
goes 
fairly 
beyond 
my 
powers. 
I 
have 
now 
to 
atone 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
I 
have 
been 
unable 
in 
my 
description 
of 
the 
dream 
psychology 
to 
follow 
the 
historic 
development 
of 
my 
views. 
The 
view-points 
for 
my 
conception 
of 
the 
dream 
were 
reached 
through 
earlier 
investigations 
in 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
neuroses, 
to 
which 
I 
am 
not 
supposed 
to 
refer 
here, 
but 
to 
which 
I 
am 
repeatedly 
forced 
to 
refer, 
whereas 
I 
should 
prefer 
to 
proceed 
in 
the 
opposite 
direction, 
and, 
starting 
from 
the 
dream, 
to 
establish 
a 
connection 
with 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
neuroses. 
I 
am 
well 
aware 
of 
all 
the 
inconveniences 
arising 
for 
the 
reader 
from 
this 
difficulty, 
but 
I 
know 
of 
no 
way 
to 
avoid 
them. 


As 
I 
am 
dissatisfied 
with 
this 
state 
of 
affairs, 
I 
am 
glad 
to 
dwell 
upon 
another 
view-point 
which 
seems 
to 
raise 
the 
value 
of 
my 
efforts. 
As 
has 
been 
shown 
in 
the 
introduction 
to 
the 
first 
chapter, 
I 
found 
myself 
confronted 
with 
a 
theme 
which 
had 
been 
marked 
by 
the 
sharpest 
contradictions 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
authorities. 
After 
our 
elaboration 
of 
the 
dream 
problems 
we 
found 
room 
for 
most 
of 
these 
contradictions. 
We 
have 
been 
forced, 
however, 
to 
take 
decided 
exception 
to 
two 
of 
the 
views 
pronounced, 
viz. 
that 
the 
dream 
is 
a 
senseless 
and 
that 
it 
is 
a 
somatic 
process; 
apart 
from 
these 
cases 
we 
have 
had 
to 
accept 
all 
the 
contradictory 
views 
in 
one 
place 
or 
another 
of 
the 
complicated 
argument, 
and 
we 
have 
been 
able 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
they 
had 
discovered 
something 
that 
was 
correct. 
That 
the 
dream 
continues 
the 
impulses 
and 
interests 
of 
the 
waking 
state 
has 
been 
quite 
generally 
confirmed 
through 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
latent 
thoughts 
of 
the 
dream. 
These 
thoughts 
concern 
themselves 
only 
with 
things 
that 
seem 
important 
and 
of 
momentous 
interest 
to 
us. 
The 
dream 
never 
occupies 
itself 
with 
trifles. 
But 
we 
have 
also 
concurred 
with 
the 
contrary 
view, 
viz., 
that 
the 
dream 
gathers 
up 
the 
indifferent 
remnants 
from 
the 
day, 
and 
that 
not 
until 
it 
has 
in 
some 
measure 
withdrawn 
itself 
from 
the 
waking 
activity 
can 
an 
important 
event 
of 
the 
day 
be 
taken 
up 
by 
the 
dream. 
We 
found 
this 
holding 
true 
for 
the 
dream 
content, 



which 
gives 
the 
dream 
thought 
its 
changed 
expression 
by 
means 
of 
disfigurement. 
We 
have 
said 
that 
from 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
association 
mechanism 
the 
dream 
process 
more 
easily 
takes 
possession 
of 
recent 
or 
indifferent 
material 
which 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
seized 
by 
the 
waking 
mental 
activity; 
and 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
censor 
it 
transfers 
the 
psychic 
intensity 
from 
the 
important 
but 
also 
disagreeable 
to 
the 
indifferent 
material. 
The 
hypermnesia 
of 
the 
dream 
and 
the 
resort 
to 
infantile 
material 
have 
become 
main 
supports 
in 
our 
theory. 
In 
our 
theory 
of 
the 
dream 
we 
have 
attributed 
to 
the 
wish 
originating 
from 
the 
infantile 
the 
part 
of 
an 
indispensable 
motor 
for 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
dream. 
We 
naturally 
could 
not 
think 
of 
doubting 
the 
experimentally 
demonstrated 
significance 
of 
the 
objective 
sensory 
stimuli 
during 
sleep; 
but 
we 
have 
brought 
this 
material 
into 
the 
same 
relation 
to 
the 
dream-wish 
as 
the 
thought 
remnants 
from 
the 
waking 
activity. 
There 
was 
no 
need 
of 
disputing 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
dream 
interprets 
the 
objective 
sensory 
stimuli 
after 
the 
manner 
of 
an 
illusion; 
but 
we 
have 
supplied 
the 
motive 
for 
this 
interpretation 
which 
has 
been 
left 
undecided 
by 
the 
authorities. 
The 
interpretation 
follows 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
that 
the 
perceived 
object 
is 
rendered 
harmless 
as 
a 
sleep 
disturber 
and 
becomes 
available 
for 
the 
wish-fulfillment. 
Though 
we 
do 
not 
admit 
as 
special 
sources 
of 
the 
dream 
the 
subjective 
state 
of 
excitement 
of 
the 
sensory 
organs 
during 
sleep, 
which 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
demonstrated 
by 
Trumbull 
Ladd, 
we 
are 
nevertheless 
able 
to 
explain 
this 
excitement 
through 
the 
regressive 
revival 
of 
active 
memories 
behind 
the 
dream. 
A 
modest 
part 
in 
our 
conception 
has 
also 
been 
assigned 
to 
the 
inner 
organic 
sensations 
which 
are 
wont 
to 
be 
taken 
as 
the 
cardinal 
point 
in 
the 
explanation 
of 
the 
dream. 
These--the 
sensation 
of 
falling, 
flying, 
or 
inhibition--stand 
as 
an 
ever 
ready 
material 
to 
be 
used 
by 
the 
dream-work 
to 
express 
the 
dream 
thought 
as 
often 
as 
need 
arises. 


That 
the 
dream 
process 
is 
a 
rapid 
and 
momentary 
one 
seems 
to 
be 
true 
for 
the 
perception 
through 
consciousness 
of 
the 
already 
prepared 
dream 
content; 
the 
preceding 
parts 
of 
the 
dream 
process 
probably 
take 
a 
slow, 
fluctuating 
course. 
We 
have 
solved 
the 
riddle 
of 
the 
superabundant 
dream 
content 
compressed 
within 
the 
briefest 
moment 
by 
explaining 
that 
this 
is 
due 
to 
the 
appropriation 
of 
almost 
fully 
formed 
structures 
from 
the 
psychic 
life. 
That 
the 
dream 
is 
disfigured 
and 
distorted 
by 
memory 
we 
found 
to 
be 
correct, 
but 
not 
troublesome, 
as 
this 
is 
only 
the 
last 
manifest 
operation 
in 
the 
work 
of 
disfigurement 
which 
has 
been 
active 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
dream-work. 



In 
the 
bitter 
and 
seemingly 
irreconcilable 
controversy 
as 
to 
whether 
the 
psychic 
life 
sleeps 
at 
night 
or 
can 
make 
the 
same 
use 
of 
all 
its 
capabilities 
as 
during 
the 
day, 
we 
have 
been 
able 
to 
agree 
with 
both 
sides, 
though 
not 
fully 
with 
either. 
We 
have 
found 
proof 
that 
the 
dream 
thoughts 
represent 
a 
most 
complicated 
intellectual 
activity, 
employing 
almost 
every 
means 
furnished 
by 
the 
psychic 
apparatus; 
still 
it 
cannot 
be 
denied 
that 
these 
dream 
thoughts 
have 
originated 
during 
the 
day, 
and 
it 
is 
indispensable 
to 
assume 
that 
there 
is 
a 
sleeping 
state 
of 
the 
psychic 
life. 
Thus, 
even 
the 
theory 
of 
partial 
sleep 
has 
come 
into 
play; 
but 
the 
characteristics 
of 
the 
sleeping 
state 
have 
been 
found 
not 
in 
the 
dilapidation 
of 
the 
psychic 
connections 
but 
in 
the 
cessation 
of 
the 
psychic 
system 
dominating 
the 
day, 
arising 
from 
its 
desire 
to 
sleep. 
The 
withdrawal 
from 
the 
outer 
world 
retains 
its 
significance 
also 
for 
our 
conception; 
though 
not 
the 
only 
factor, 
it 
nevertheless 
helps 
the 
regression 
to 
make 
possible 
the 
representation 
of 
the 
dream. 
That 
we 
should 
reject 
the 
voluntary 
guidance 
of 
the 
presentation 
course 
is 
uncontestable; 
but 
the 
psychic 
life 
does 
not 
thereby 
become 
aimless, 
for 
we 
have 
seen 
that 
after 
the 
abandonment 
of 
the 
desired 
end-presentation 
undesired 
ones 
gain 
the 
mastery. 
The 
loose 
associative 
connection 
in 
the 
dream 
we 
have 
not 
only 
recognized, 
but 
we 
have 
placed 
under 
its 
control 
a 
far 
greater 
territory 
than 
could 
have 
been 
supposed; 
we 
have, 
however, 
found 
it 
merely 
the 
feigned 
substitute 
for 
another 
correct 
and 
senseful 
one. 
To 
be 
sure 
we, 
too, 
have 
called 
the 
dream 
absurd; 
but 
we 
have 
been 
able 
to 
learn 
from 
examples 
how 
wise 
the 
dream 
really 
is 
when 
it 
simulates 
absurdity. 
We 
do 
not 
deny 
any 
of 
the 
functions 
that 
have 
been 
attributed 
to 
the 
dream. 
That 
the 
dream 
relieves 
the 
mind 
like 
a 
valve, 
and 
that, 
according 
to 
Robert's 
assertion, 
all 
kinds 
of 
harmful 
material 
are 
rendered 
harmless 
through 
representation 
in 
the 
dream, 
not 
only 
exactly 
coincides 
with 
our 
theory 
of 
the 
twofold 
wish-fulfillment 
in 
the 
dream, 
but, 
in 
his 
own 
wording, 
becomes 
even 
more 
comprehensible 
for 
us 
than 
for 
Robert 
himself. 
The 
free 
indulgence 
of 
the 
psychic 
in 
the 
play 
of 
its 
faculties 
finds 
expression 
with 
us 
in 
the 
non-interference 
with 
the 
dream 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
foreconscious 
activity. 
The 
"return 
to 
the 
embryonal 
state 
of 
psychic 
life 
in 
the 
dream" 
and 
the 
observation 
of 
Havelock 
Ellis, 
"an 
archaic 
world 
of 
vast 
emotions 
and 
imperfect 
thoughts," 
appear 
to 
us 
as 
happy 
anticipations 
of 
our 
deductions 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
primitive 
modes 
of 
work 
suppressed 
during 
the 
day 
participate 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
dream; 
and 
with 
us, 
as 
with 
Delage, 
the 
suppressed 
material 
becomes 
the 
mainspring 
of 
the 
dreaming. 



We 
have 
fully 
recognized 
the 
rôle 
which 
Scherner 
ascribes 
to 
the 
dream 
phantasy, 
and 
even 
his 
interpretation; 
but 
we 
have 
been 
obliged, 
so 
to 
speak, 
to 
conduct 
them 
to 
another 
department 
in 
the 
problem. 
It 
is 
not 
the 
dream 
that 
produces 
the 
phantasy 
but 
the 
unconscious 
phantasy 
that 
takes 
the 
greatest 
part 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
dream 
thoughts. 
We 
are 
indebted 
to 
Scherner 
for 
his 
clew 
to 
the 
source 
of 
the 
dream 
thoughts, 
but 
almost 
everything 
that 
he 
ascribes 
to 
the 
dream-work 
is 
attributable 
to 
the 
activity 
of 
the 
unconscious, 
which 
is 
at 
work 
during 
the 
day, 
and 
which 
supplies 
incitements 
not 
only 
for 
dreams 
but 
for 
neurotic 
symptoms 
as 
well. 
We 
have 
had 
to 
separate 
the 
dream-work 
from 
this 
activity 
as 
being 
something 
entirely 
different 
and 
far 
more 
restricted. 
Finally, 
we 
have 
by 
no 
means 
abandoned 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
dream 
to 
mental 
disturbances, 
but, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
we 
have 
given 
it 
a 
more 
solid 
foundation 
on 
new 
ground. 


Thus 
held 
together 
by 
the 
new 
material 
of 
our 
theory 
as 
by 
a 
superior 
unity, 
we 
find 
the 
most 
varied 
and 
most 
contradictory 
conclusions 
of 
the 
authorities 
fitting 
into 
our 
structure; 
some 
of 
them 
are 
differently 
disposed, 
only 
a 
few 
of 
them 
are 
entirely 
rejected. 
But 
our 
own 
structure 
is 
still 
unfinished. 
For, 
disregarding 
the 
many 
obscurities 
which 
we 
have 
necessarily 
encountered 
in 
our 
advance 
into 
the 
darkness 
of 
psychology, 
we 
are 
now 
apparently 
embarrassed 
by 
a 
new 
contradiction. 
On 
the 
one 
hand, 
we 
have 
allowed 
the 
dream 
thoughts 
to 
proceed 
from 
perfectly 
normal 
mental 
operations, 
while, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
we 
have 
found 
among 
the 
dream 
thoughts 
a 
number 
of 
entirely 
abnormal 
mental 
processes 
which 
extend 
likewise 
to 
the 
dream 
contents. 
These, 
consequently, 
we 
have 
repeated 
in 
the 
interpretation 
of 
the 
dream. 
All 
that 
we 
have 
termed 
the 
"dream-work" 
seems 
so 
remote 
from 
the 
psychic 
processes 
recognized 
by 
us 
as 
correct, 
that 
the 
severest 
judgments 
of 
the 
authors 
as 
to 
the 
low 
psychic 
activity 
of 
dreaming 
seem 
to 
us 
well 
founded. 


Perhaps 
only 
through 
still 
further 
advance 
can 
enlightenment 
and 
improvement 
be 
brought 
about. 
I 
shall 
pick 
out 
one 
of 
the 
constellations 
leading 
to 
the 
formation 
of 
dreams. 


We 
have 
learned 
that 
the 
dream 
replaces 
a 
number 
of 
thoughts 
derived 
from 
daily 
life 
which 
are 
perfectly 
formed 
logically. 
We 
cannot 
therefore 
doubt 
that 
these 
thoughts 
originate 
from 
our 
normal 
mental 
life. 
All 
the 
qualities 



which 
we 
esteem 
in 
our 
mental 
operations, 
and 
which 
distinguish 
these 
as 
complicated 
activities 
of 
a 
high 
order, 
we 
find 
repeated 
in 
the 
dream 
thoughts. 
There 
is, 
however, 
no 
need 
of 
assuming 
that 
this 
mental 
work 
is 
performed 
during 
sleep, 
as 
this 
would 
materially 
impair 
the 
conception 
of 
the 
psychic 
state 
of 
sleep 
we 
have 
hitherto 
adhered 
to. 
These 
thoughts 
may 
just 
as 
well 
have 
originated 
from 
the 
day, 
and, 
unnoticed 
by 
our 
consciousness 
from 
their 
inception, 
they 
may 
have 
continued 
to 
develop 
until 
they 
stood 
complete 
at 
the 
onset 
of 
sleep. 
If 
we 
are 
to 
conclude 
anything 
from 
this 
state 
of 
affairs, 
it 
will 
at 
most 
prove 
_that 
the 
most 
complex 
mental 
operations 
are 
possible 
without 
the 
coöperation 
of 
consciousness_, 
which 
we 
have 
already 
learned 
independently 
from 
every 
psychoanalysis 
of 
persons 
suffering 
from 
hysteria 
or 
obsessions. 
These 
dream 
thoughts 
are 
in 
themselves 
surely 
not 
incapable 
of 
consciousness; 
if 
they 
have 
not 
become 
conscious 
to 
us 
during 
the 
day, 
this 
may 
have 
various 
reasons. 
The 
state 
of 
becoming 
conscious 
depends 
on 
the 
exercise 
of 
a 
certain 
psychic 
function, 
viz. 
attention, 
which 
seems 
to 
be 
extended 
only 
in 
a 
definite 
quantity, 
and 
which 
may 
have 
been 
withdrawn 
from 
the 
stream 
of 
thought 
in 
Question 
by 
other 
aims. 
Another 
way 
in 
which 
such 
mental 
streams 
are 
kept 
from 
consciousness 
is 
the 
following:--Our 
conscious 
reflection 
teaches 
us 
that 
when 
exercising 
attention 
we 
pursue 
a 
definite 
course. 
But 
if 
that 
course 
leads 
us 
to 
an 
idea 
which 
does 
not 
hold 
its 
own 
with 
the 
critic, 
we 
discontinue 
and 
cease 
to 
apply 
our 
attention. 
Now, 
apparently, 
the 
stream 
of 
thought 
thus 
started 
and 
abandoned 
may 
spin 
on 
without 
regaining 
attention 
unless 
it 
reaches 
a 
spot 
of 
especially 
marked 
intensity 
which 
forces 
the 
return 
of 
attention. 
An 
initial 
rejection, 
perhaps 
consciously 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
judgment 
on 
the 
ground 
of 
incorrectness 
or 
unfitness 
for 
the 
actual 
purpose 
of 
the 
mental 
act, 
may 
therefore 
account 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
mental 
process 
continues 
until 
the 
onset 
of 
sleep 
unnoticed 
by 
consciousness. 


Let 
us 
recapitulate 
by 
saying 
that 
we 
call 
such 
a 
stream 
of 
thought 
a 
foreconscious 
one, 
that 
we 
believe 
it 
to 
be 
perfectly 
correct, 
and 
that 
it 
may 
just 
as 
well 
be 
a 
more 
neglected 
one 
or 
an 
interrupted 
and 
suppressed 
one. 
Let 
us 
also 
state 
frankly 
in 
what 
manner 
we 
conceive 
this 
presentation 
course. 
We 
believe 
that 
a 
certain 
sum 
of 
excitement, 
which 
we 
call 
occupation 
energy, 
is 
displaced 
from 
an 
end-presentation 
along 
the 
association 
paths 
selected 
by 
that 
end-presentation. 
A 
"neglected" 
stream 
of 
thought 
has 
received 
no 
such 
occupation, 
and 
from 
a 
"suppressed" 
or 
"rejected" 
one 
this 



occupation 
has 
been 
withdrawn; 
both 
have 
thus 
been 
left 
to 
their 
own 
emotions. 
The 
end-stream 
of 
thought 
stocked 
with 
energy 
is 
under 
certain 
conditions 
able 
to 
draw 
to 
itself 
the 
attention 
of 
consciousness, 
through 
which 
means 
it 
then 
receives 
a 
"surplus 
of 
energy." 
We 
shall 
be 
obliged 
somewhat 
later 
to 
elucidate 
our 
assumption 
concerning 
the 
nature 
and 
activity 
of 
consciousness. 


A 
train 
of 
thought 
thus 
incited 
in 
the 
Forec. 
may 
either 
disappear 
spontaneously 
or 
continue. 
The 
former 
issue 
we 
conceive 
as 
follows: 
It 
diffuses 
its 
energy 
through 
all 
the 
association 
paths 
emanating 
from 
it, 
and 
throws 
the 
entire 
chain 
of 
ideas 
into 
a 
state 
of 
excitement 
which, 
after 
lasting 
for 
a 
while, 
subsides 
through 
the 
transformation 
of 
the 
excitement 
requiring 
an 
outlet 
into 
dormant 
energy.[1] 
If 
this 
first 
issue 
is 
brought 
about 
the 
process 
has 
no 
further 
significance 
for 
the 
dream 
formation. 
But 
other 
end-
presentations 
are 
lurking 
in 
our 
foreconscious 
that 
originate 
from 
the 
sources 
of 
our 
unconscious 
and 
from 
the 
ever 
active 
wishes. 
These 
may 
take 
possession 
of 
the 
excitations 
in 
the 
circle 
of 
thought 
thus 
left 
to 
itself, 
establish 
a 
connection 
between 
it 
and 
the 
unconscious 
wish, 
and 
transfer 
to 
it 
the 
energy 
inherent 
in 
the 
unconscious 
wish. 
Henceforth 
the 
neglected 
or 
suppressed 
train 
of 
thought 
is 
in 
a 
position 
to 
maintain 
itself, 
although 
this 
reinforcement 
does 
not 
help 
it 
to 
gain 
access 
to 
consciousness. 
We 
may 
say 
that 
the 
hitherto 
foreconscious 
train 
of 
thought 
has 
been 
drawn 
into 
the 
unconscious. 


Other 
constellations 
for 
the 
dream 
formation 
would 
result 
if 
the 
foreconscious 
train 
of 
thought 
had 
from 
the 
beginning 
been 
connected 
with 
the 
unconscious 
wish, 
and 
for 
that 
reason 
met 
with 
rejection 
by 
the 
dominating 
end-occupation; 
or 
if 
an 
unconscious 
wish 
were 
made 
active 
for 
other--possibly 
somatic--reasons 
and 
of 
its 
own 
accord 
sought 
a 
transference 
to 
the 
psychic 
remnants 
not 
occupied 
by 
the 
Forec. 
All 
three 
cases 
finally 
combine 
in 
one 
issue, 
so 
that 
there 
is 
established 
in 
the 
foreconscious 
a 
stream 
of 
thought 
which, 
having 
been 
abandoned 
by 
the 
foreconscious 
occupation, 
receives 
occupation 
from 
the 
unconscious 
wish. 


The 
stream 
of 
thought 
is 
henceforth 
subjected 
to 
a 
series 
of 
transformations 
which 
we 
no 
longer 
recognize 
as 
normal 
psychic 
processes 
and 
which 
give 
us 
a 
surprising 
result, 
viz. 
a 
psychopathological 
formation. 
Let 
us 
emphasize 
and 
group 
the 
same. 



1. 
The 
intensities 
of 
the 
individual 
ideas 
become 
capable 
of 
discharge 
in 
their 
entirety, 
and, 
proceeding 
from 
one 
conception 
to 
the 
other, 
they 
thus 
form 
single 
presentations 
endowed 
with 
marked 
intensity. 
Through 
the 
repeated 
recurrence 
of 
this 
process 
the 
intensity 
of 
an 
entire 
train 
of 
ideas 
may 
ultimately 
be 
gathered 
in 
a 
single 
presentation 
element. 
This 
is 
the 
principle 
of 
compression 
or 
condensation. 
It 
is 
condensation 
that 
is 
mainly 
responsible 
for 
the 
strange 
impression 
of 
the 
dream, 
for 
we 
know 
of 
nothing 
analogous 
to 
it 
in 
the 
normal 
psychic 
life 
accessible 
to 
consciousness. 
We 
find 
here, 
also, 
presentations 
which 
possess 
great 
psychic 
significance 
as 
junctions 
or 
as 
end-
results 
of 
whole 
chains 
of 
thought; 
but 
this 
validity 
does 
not 
manifest 
itself 
in 
any 
character 
conspicuous 
enough 
for 
internal 
perception; 
hence, 
what 
has 
been 
presented 
in 
it 
does 
not 
become 
in 
any 
way 
more 
intensive. 
In 
the 
process 
of 
condensation 
the 
entire 
psychic 
connection 
becomes 
transformed 
into 
the 
intensity 
of 
the 
presentation 
content. 
It 
is 
the 
same 
as 
in 
a 
book 
where 
we 
space 
or 
print 
in 
heavy 
type 
any 
word 
upon 
which 
particular 
stress 
is 
laid 
for 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
text. 
In 
speech 
the 
same 
word 
would 
be 
pronounced 
loudly 
and 
deliberately 
and 
with 
emphasis. 
The 
first 
comparison 
leads 
us 
at 
once 
to 
an 
example 
taken 
from 
the 
chapter 
on 
"The 
Dream-Work" 
(trimethylamine 
in 
the 
dream 
of 
Irma's 
injection). 
Historians 
of 
art 
call 
our 
attention 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
most 
ancient 
historical 
sculptures 
follow 
a 
similar 
principle 
in 
expressing 
the 
rank 
of 
the 
persons 
represented 
by 
the 
size 
of 
the 
statue. 
The 
king 
is 
made 
two 
or 
three 
times 
as 
large 
as 
his 
retinue 
or 
the 
vanquished 
enemy. 
A 
piece 
of 
art, 
however, 
from 
the 
Roman 
period 
makes 
use 
of 
more 
subtle 
means 
to 
accomplish 
the 
same 
purpose. 
The 
figure 
of 
the 
emperor 
is 
placed 
in 
the 
center 
in 
a 
firmly 
erect 
posture; 
special 
care 
is 
bestowed 
on 
the 
proper 
modelling 
of 
his 
figure; 
his 
enemies 
are 
seen 
cowering 
at 
his 
feet; 
but 
he 
is 
no 
longer 
represented 
a 
giant 
among 
dwarfs. 
However, 
the 
bowing 
of 
the 
subordinate 
to 
his 
superior 
in 
our 
own 
days 
is 
only 
an 
echo 
of 
that 
ancient 
principle 
of 
representation. 
The 
direction 
taken 
by 
the 
condensations 
of 
the 
dream 
is 
prescribed 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
by 
the 
true 
foreconscious 
relations 
of 
the 
dream 
thoughts, 
an 
the 
other 
hand 
by 
the 
attraction 
of 
the 
visual 
reminiscences 
in 
the 
unconscious. 
The 
success 
of 
the 
condensation 
work 
produces 
those 
intensities 
which 
are 
required 
for 
penetration 
into 
the 
perception 
systems. 


2. 
Through 
this 
free 
transferability 
of 
the 
intensities, 
moreover, 
and 
in 
the 

service 
of 
condensation, 
_intermediary 
presentations_--compromises, 
as 
it 
were--are 
formed 
(_cf._ 
the 
numerous 
examples). 
This, 
likewise, 
is 
something 
unheard 
of 
in 
the 
normal 
presentation 
course, 
where 
it 
is 
above 
all 
a 
question 
of 
selection 
and 
retention 
of 
the 
"proper" 
presentation 
element. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
composite 
and 
compromise 
formations 
occur 
with 
extraordinary 
frequency 
when 
we 
are 
trying 
to 
find 
the 
linguistic 
expression 
for 
foreconscious 
thoughts; 
these 
are 
considered 
"slips 
of 
the 
tongue." 


3. 
The 
presentations 
which 
transfer 
their 
intensities 
to 
one 
another 
are 
very 
loosely 
connected, 
and 
are 
joined 
together 
by 
such 
forms 
of 
association 
as 
are 
spurned 
in 
our 
serious 
thought 
and 
are 
utilized 
in 
the 
production 
of 
the 
effect 
of 
wit 
only. 
Among 
these 
we 
particularly 
find 
associations 
of 
the 
sound 
and 
consonance 
types. 
4. 
Contradictory 
thoughts 
do 
not 
strive 
to 
eliminate 
one 
another, 
but 
remain 
side 
by 
side. 
They 
often 
unite 
to 
produce 
condensation 
as 
if 
no 
contradiction 
existed, 
or 
they 
form 
compromises 
for 
which 
we 
should 
never 
forgive 
our 
thoughts, 
but 
which 
we 
frequently 
approve 
of 
in 
our 
actions. 
These 
are 
some 
of 
the 
most 
conspicuous 
abnormal 
processes 
to 
which 
the 
thoughts 
which 
have 
previously 
been 
rationally 
formed 
are 
subjected 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
dream-work. 
As 
the 
main 
feature 
of 
these 
processes 
we 
recognize 
the 
high 
importance 
attached 
to 
the 
fact 
of 
rendering 
the 
occupation 
energy 
mobile 
and 
capable 
of 
discharge; 
the 
content 
and 
the 
actual 
significance 
of 
the 
psychic 
elements, 
to 
which 
these 
energies 
adhere, 
become 
a 
matter 
of 
secondary 
importance. 
One 
might 
possibly 
think 
that 
the 
condensation 
and 
compromise 
formation 
is 
effected 
only 
in 
the 
service 
of 
regression, 
when 
occasion 
arises 
for 
changing 
thoughts 
into 
pictures. 
But 
the 
analysis 
and--still 
more 
distinctly--the 
synthesis 
of 
dreams 
which 
lack 
regression 
toward 
pictures, 
_e.g._ 
the 
dream 
"Autodidasker--Conversation 
with 
Court-Councilor 
N.," 
present 
the 
same 
processes 
of 
displacement 
and 
condensation 
as 
the 
others. 


Hence 
we 
cannot 
refuse 
to 
acknowledge 
that 
the 
two 
kinds 
of 
essentially 
different 
psychic 
processes 
participate 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
dream; 
one 
forms 
perfectly 
correct 
dream 
thoughts 
which 
are 
equivalent 
to 
normal 
thoughts, 
while 
the 
other 
treats 
these 
ideas 
in 
a 
highly 
surprising 
and 
incorrect 
manner. 
The 
latter 
process 
we 
have 
already 
set 
apart 
as 
the 
dream



work 
proper. 
What 
have 
we 
now 
to 
advance 
concerning 
this 
latter 
psychic 
process? 


We 
should 
be 
unable 
to 
answer 
this 
question 
here 
if 
we 
had 
not 
penetrated 
considerably 
into 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
neuroses 
and 
especially 
of 
hysteria. 
From 
this 
we 
learn 
that 
the 
same 
incorrect 
psychic 
processes--as 
well 
as 
others 
that 
have 
not 
been 
enumerated--control 
the 
formation 
of 
hysterical 
symptoms. 
In 
hysteria, 
too, 
we 
at 
once 
find 
a 
series 
of 
perfectly 
correct 
thoughts 
equivalent 
to 
our 
conscious 
thoughts, 
of 
whose 
existence, 
however, 
in 
this 
form 
we 
can 
learn 
nothing 
and 
which 
we 
can 
only 
subsequently 
reconstruct. 
If 
they 
have 
forced 
their 
way 
anywhere 
to 
our 
perception, 
we 
discover 
from 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
symptom 
formed 
that 
these 
normal 
thoughts 
have 
been 
subjected 
to 
abnormal 
treatment 
and 
_have 
been 
transformed 
into 
the 
symptom 
by 
means 
of 
condensation 
and 
compromise 
formation, 
through 
superficial 
associations, 
under 
cover 
of 
contradictions, 
and 
eventually 
over 
the 
road 
of 
regression_. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
complete 
identity 
found 
between 
the 
peculiarities 
of 
the 
dream-work 
and 
of 
the 
psychic 
activity 
forming 
the 
psychoneurotic 
symptoms, 
we 
shall 
feel 
justified 
in 
transferring 
to 
the 
dream 
the 
conclusions 
urged 
upon 
us 
by 
hysteria. 


From 
the 
theory 
of 
hysteria 
we 
borrow 
the 
proposition 
that 
such 
an 
abnormal 
psychic 
elaboration 
of 
a 
normal 
train 
of 
thought 
takes 
place 
only 
when 
the 
latter 
has 
been 
used 
for 
the 
transference 
of 
an 
unconscious 
wish 
which 
dates 
from 
the 
infantile 
life 
and 
is 
in 
a 
state 
of 
repression. 
In 
accordance 
with 
this 
proposition 
we 
have 
construed 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
dream 
on 
the 
assumption 
that 
the 
actuating 
dream-wish 
invariably 
originates 
in 
the 
unconscious, 
which, 
as 
we 
ourselves 
have 
admitted, 
cannot 
be 
universally 
demonstrated 
though 
it 
cannot 
be 
refuted. 
But 
in 
order 
to 
explain 
the 
real 
meaning 
of 
the 
term 
repression, 
which 
we 
have 
employed 
so 
freely, 
we 
shall 
be 
obliged 
to 
make 
some 
further 
addition 
to 
our 
psychological 
construction. 


We 
have 
above 
elaborated 
the 
fiction 
of 
a 
primitive 
psychic 
apparatus, 
whose 
work 
is 
regulated 
by 
the 
efforts 
to 
avoid 
accumulation 
of 
excitement 
and 
as 
far 
as 
possible 
to 
maintain 
itself 
free 
from 
excitement. 
For 
this 
reason 
it 
was 
constructed 
after 
the 
plan 
of 
a 
reflex 
apparatus; 
the 
motility, 
originally 
the 
path 
for 
the 
inner 
bodily 
change, 
formed 
a 
discharging 
path 
standing 
at 
its 
disposal. 
We 
subsequently 
discussed 
the 
psychic 
results 
of 
a 
feeling 
of 
gratification, 
and 
we 
might 
at 
the 
same 
time 
have 
introduced 
the 
second 



assumption, 
viz. 
that 
accumulation 
of 
excitement--following 
certain 
modalities 
that 
do 
not 
concern 
us--is 
perceived 
as 
pain 
and 
sets 
the 
apparatus 
in 
motion 
in 
order 
to 
reproduce 
a 
feeling 
of 
gratification 
in 
which 
the 
diminution 
of 
the 
excitement 
is 
perceived 
as 
pleasure. 
Such 
a 
current 
in 
the 
apparatus 
which 
emanates 
from 
pain 
and 
strives 
for 
pleasure 
we 
call 
a 
wish. 
We 
have 
said 
that 
nothing 
but 
a 
wish 
is 
capable 
of 
setting 
the 
apparatus 
in 
motion, 
and 
that 
the 
discharge 
of 
excitement 
in 
the 
apparatus 
is 
regulated 
automatically 
by 
the 
perception 
of 
pleasure 
and 
pain. 
The 
first 
wish 
must 
have 
been 
an 
hallucinatory 
occupation 
of 
the 
memory 
for 
gratification. 
But 
this 
hallucination, 
unless 
it 
were 
maintained 
to 
the 
point 
of 
exhaustion, 
proved 
incapable 
of 
bringing 
about 
a 
cessation 
of 
the 
desire 
and 
consequently 
of 
securing 
the 
pleasure 
connected 
with 
gratification. 


Thus 
there 
was 
required 
a 
second 
activity--in 
our 
terminology 
the 
activity 
of 
a 
second 
system--which 
should 
not 
permit 
the 
memory 
occupation 
to 
advance 
to 
perception 
and 
therefrom 
to 
restrict 
the 
psychic 
forces, 
but 
should 
lead 
the 
excitement 
emanating 
from 
the 
craving 
stimulus 
by 
a 
devious 
path 
over 
the 
spontaneous 
motility 
which 
ultimately 
should 
so 
change 
the 
outer 
world 
as 
to 
allow 
the 
real 
perception 
of 
the 
object 
of 
gratification 
to 
take 
place. 
Thus 
far 
we 
have 
elaborated 
the 
plan 
of 
the 
psychic 
apparatus; 
these 
two 
systems 
are 
the 
germ 
of 
the 
Unc. 
and 
Forec, 
which 
we 
include 
in 
the 
fully 
developed 
apparatus. 


In 
order 
to 
be 
in 
a 
position 
successfully 
to 
change 
the 
outer 
world 
through 
the 
motility, 
there 
is 
required 
the 
accumulation 
of 
a 
large 
sum 
of 
experiences 
in 
the 
memory 
systems 
as 
well 
as 
a 
manifold 
fixation 
of 
the 
relations 
which 
are 
evoked 
in 
this 
memory 
material 
by 
different 
end-presentations. 
We 
now 
proceed 
further 
with 
our 
assumption. 
The 
manifold 
activity 
of 
the 
second 
system, 
tentatively 
sending 
forth 
and 
retracting 
energy, 
must 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
have 
full 
command 
over 
all 
memory 
material, 
but 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
it 
would 
be 
a 
superfluous 
expenditure 
for 
it 
to 
send 
to 
the 
individual 
mental 
paths 
large 
quantities 
of 
energy 
which 
would 
thus 
flow 
off 
to 
no 
purpose, 
diminishing 
the 
quantity 
available 
for 
the 
transformation 
of 
the 
outer 
world. 
In 
the 
interests 
of 
expediency 
I 
therefore 
postulate 
that 
the 
second 
system 
succeeds 
in 
maintaining 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
occupation 
energy 
in 
a 
dormant 
state 
and 
in 
using 
but 
a 
small 
portion 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
displacement. 
The 
mechanism 
of 
these 
processes 
is 
entirely 
unknown 
to 
me; 
any 
one 
who 
wishes 
to 
follow 
up 
these 
ideas 
must 
try 
to 
find 
the 
physical 



analogies 
and 
prepare 
the 
way 
for 
a 
demonstration 
of 
the 
process 
of 
motion 
in 
the 
stimulation 
of 
the 
neuron. 
I 
merely 
hold 
to 
the 
idea 
that 
the 
activity 
of 
the 
first 
[Greek: 
Psi]-system 
is 
directed 
to 
the 
free 
outflow 
of 
the 
quantities 
of 
excitement, 
and 
that 
the 
second 
system 
brings 
about 
an 
inhibition 
of 
this 
outflow 
through 
the 
energies 
emanating 
from 
it, 
_i.e._ 
it 
produces 
a 
_transformation 
into 
dormant 
energy, 
probably 
by 
raising 
the 
level_. 
I 
therefore 
assume 
that 
under 
the 
control 
of 
the 
second 
system 
as 
compared 
with 
the 
first, 
the 
course 
of 
the 
excitement 
is 
bound 
to 
entirely 
different 
mechanical 
conditions. 
After 
the 
second 
system 
has 
finished 
its 
tentative 
mental 
work, 
it 
removes 
the 
inhibition 
and 
congestion 
of 
the 
excitements 
and 
allows 
these 
excitements 
to 
flow 
off 
to 
the 
motility. 


An 
interesting 
train 
of 
thought 
now 
presents 
itself 
if 
we 
consider 
the 
relations 
of 
this 
inhibition 
of 
discharge 
by 
the 
second 
system 
to 
the 
regulation 
through 
the 
principle 
of 
pain. 
Let 
us 
now 
seek 
the 
counterpart 
of 
the 
primary 
feeling 
of 
gratification, 
namely, 
the 
objective 
feeling 
of 
fear. 
A 
perceptive 
stimulus 
acts 
on 
the 
primitive 
apparatus, 
becoming 
the 
source 
of 
a 
painful 
emotion. 
This 
will 
then 
be 
followed 
by 
irregular 
motor 
manifestations 
until 
one 
of 
these 
withdraws 
the 
apparatus 
from 
perception 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
from 
pain, 
but 
on 
the 
reappearance 
of 
the 
perception 
this 
manifestation 
will 
immediately 
repeat 
itself 
(perhaps 
as 
a 
movement 
of 
flight) 
until 
the 
perception 
has 
again 
disappeared. 
But 
there 
will 
here 
remain 
no 
tendency 
again 
to 
occupy 
the 
perception 
of 
the 
source 
of 
pain 
in 
the 
form 
of 
an 
hallucination 
or 
in 
any 
other 
form. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
there 
will 
be 
a 
tendency 
in 
the 
primary 
apparatus 
to 
abandon 
the 
painful 
memory 
picture 
as 
soon 
as 
it 
is 
in 
any 
way 
awakened, 
as 
the 
overflow 
of 
its 
excitement 
would 
surely 
produce 
(more 
precisely, 
begin 
to 
produce) 
pain. 
The 
deviation 
from 
memory, 
which 
is 
but 
a 
repetition 
of 
the 
former 
flight 
from 
perception, 
is 
facilitated 
also 
by 
the 
fact 
that, 
unlike 
perception, 
memory 
does 
not 
possess 
sufficient 
quality 
to 
excite 
consciousness 
and 
thereby 
to 
attract 
to 
itself 
new 
energy. 
This 
easy 
and 
regularly 
occurring 
deviation 
of 
the 
psychic 
process 
from 
the 
former 
painful 
memory 
presents 
to 
us 
the 
model 
and 
the 
first 
example 
of 
psychic 
repression. 
As 
is 
generally 
known, 
much 
of 
this 
deviation 
from 
the 
painful, 
much 
of 
the 
behavior 
of 
the 
ostrich, 
can 
be 
readily 
demonstrated 
even 
in 
the 
normal 
psychic 
life 
of 
adults. 


By 
virtue 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
pain 
the 
first 
system 
is 
therefore 
altogether 
incapable 
of 
introducing 
anything 
unpleasant 
into 
the 
mental 
associations. 



The 
system 
cannot 
do 
anything 
but 
wish. 
If 
this 
remained 
so 
the 
mental 
activity 
of 
the 
second 
system, 
which 
should 
have 
at 
its 
disposal 
all 
the 
memories 
stored 
up 
by 
experiences, 
would 
be 
hindered. 
But 
two 
ways 
are 
now 
opened: 
the 
work 
of 
the 
second 
system 
either 
frees 
itself 
completely 
from 
the 
principle 
of 
pain 
and 
continues 
its 
course, 
paying 
no 
heed 
to 
the 
painful 
reminiscence, 
or 
it 
contrives 
to 
occupy 
the 
painful 
memory 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
as 
to 
preclude 
the 
liberation 
of 
pain. 
We 
may 
reject 
the 
first 
possibility, 
as 
the 
principle 
of 
pain 
also 
manifests 
itself 
as 
a 
regulator 
for 
the 
emotional 
discharge 
of 
the 
second 
system; 
we 
are, 
therefore, 
directed 
to 
the 
second 
possibility, 
namely, 
that 
this 
system 
occupies 
a 
reminiscence 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
as 
to 
inhibit 
its 
discharge 
and 
hence, 
also, 
to 
inhibit 
the 
discharge 
comparable 
to 
a 
motor 
innervation 
for 
the 
development 
of 
pain. 
Thus 
from 
two 
starting 
points 
we 
are 
led 
to 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
occupation 
through 
the 
second 
system 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
an 
inhibition 
for 
the 
emotional 
discharge, 
viz. 
from 
a 
consideration 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
pain 
and 
from 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
smallest 
expenditure 
of 
innervation. 
Let 
us, 
however, 
keep 
to 
the 
fact--this 
is 
the 
key 
to 
the 
theory 
of 
repression--that 
the 
second 
system 
is 
capable 
of 
occupying 
an 
idea 
only 
when 
it 
is 
in 
position 
to 
check 
the 
development 
of 
pain 
emanating 
from 
it. 
Whatever 
withdraws 
itself 
from 
this 
inhibition 
also 
remains 
inaccessible 
for 
the 
second 
system 
and 
would 
soon 
be 
abandoned 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
pain. 
The 
inhibition 
of 
pain, 
however, 
need 
not 
be 
complete; 
it 
must 
be 
permitted 
to 
begin, 
as 
it 
indicates 
to 
the 
second 
system 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
memory 
and 
possibly 
its 
defective 
adaptation 
for 
the 
purpose 
sought 
by 
the 
mind. 


The 
psychic 
process 
which 
is 
admitted 
by 
the 
first 
system 
only 
I 
shall 
now 
call 
the 
primary 
process; 
and 
the 
one 
resulting 
from 
the 
inhibition 
of 
the 
second 
system 
I 
shall 
call 
the 
secondary 
process. 
I 
show 
by 
another 
point 
for 
what 
purpose 
the 
second 
system 
is 
obliged 
to 
correct 
the 
primary 
process. 
The 
primary 
process 
strives 
for 
a 
discharge 
of 
the 
excitement 
in 
order 
to 
establish 
a 
perception 
identity 
with 
the 
sum 
of 
excitement 
thus 
gathered; 
the 
secondary 
process 
has 
abandoned 
this 
intention 
and 
undertaken 
instead 
the 
task 
of 
bringing 
about 
a 
thought 
identity. 
All 
thinking 
is 
only 
a 
circuitous 
path 
from 
the 
memory 
of 
gratification 
taken 
as 
an 
end-presentation 
to 
the 
identical 
occupation 
of 
the 
same 
memory, 
which 
is 
again 
to 
be 
attained 
on 
the 
track 
of 
the 
motor 
experiences. 
The 
state 
of 
thinking 
must 
take 
an 
interest 
in 
the 
connecting 
paths 
between 
the 
presentations 
without 
allowing 
itself 
to 
be 



misled 
by 
their 
intensities. 
But 
it 
is 
obvious 
that 
condensations 
and 
intermediate 
or 
compromise 
formations 
occurring 
in 
the 
presentations 
impede 
the 
attainment 
of 
this 
end-identity; 
by 
substituting 
one 
idea 
for 
the 
other 
they 
deviate 
from 
the 
path 
which 
otherwise 
would 
have 
been 
continued 
from 
the 
original 
idea. 
Such 
processes 
are 
therefore 
carefully 
avoided 
in 
the 
secondary 
thinking. 
Nor 
is 
it 
difficult 
to 
understand 
that 
the 
principle 
of 
pain 
also 
impedes 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
mental 
stream 
in 
its 
pursuit 
of 
the 
thought 
identity, 
though, 
indeed, 
it 
offers 
to 
the 
mental 
stream 
the 
most 
important 
points 
of 
departure. 
Hence 
the 
tendency 
of 
the 
thinking 
process 
must 
be 
to 
free 
itself 
more 
and 
more 
from 
exclusive 
adjustment 
by 
the 
principle 
of 
pain, 
and 
through 
the 
working 
of 
the 
mind 
to 
restrict 
the 
affective 
development 
to 
that 
minimum 
which 
is 
necessary 
as 
a 
signal. 
This 
refinement 
of 
the 
activity 
must 
have 
been 
attained 
through 
a 
recent 
over-occupation 
of 
energy 
brought 
about 
by 
consciousness. 
But 
we 
are 
aware 
that 
this 
refinement 
is 
seldom 
completely 
successful 
even 
in 
the 
most 
normal 
psychic 
life 
and 
that 
our 
thoughts 
ever 
remain 
accessible 
to 
falsification 
through 
the 
interference 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
pain. 


This, 
however, 
is 
not 
the 
breach 
in 
the 
functional 
efficiency 
of 
our 
psychic 
apparatus 
through 
which 
the 
thoughts 
forming 
the 
material 
of 
the 
secondary 
mental 
work 
are 
enabled 
to 
make 
their 
way 
into 
the 
primary 
psychic 
process-with 
which 
formula 
we 
may 
now 
describe 
the 
work 
leading 
to 
the 
dream 
and 
to 
the 
hysterical 
symptoms. 
This 
case 
of 
insufficiency 
results 
from 
the 
union 
of 
the 
two 
factors 
from 
the 
history 
of 
our 
evolution; 
one 
of 
which 
belongs 
solely 
to 
the 
psychic 
apparatus 
and 
has 
exerted 
a 
determining 
influence 
on 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
two 
systems, 
while 
the 
other 
operates 
fluctuatingly 
and 
introduces 
motive 
forces 
of 
organic 
origin 
into 
the 
psychic 
life. 
Both 
originate 
in 
the 
infantile 
life 
and 
result 
from 
the 
transformation 
which 
our 
psychic 
and 
somatic 
organism 
has 
undergone 
since 
the 
infantile 
period. 


When 
I 
termed 
one 
of 
the 
psychic 
processes 
in 
the 
psychic 
apparatus 
the 
primary 
process, 
I 
did 
so 
not 
only 
in 
consideration 
of 
the 
order 
of 
precedence 
and 
capability, 
but 
also 
as 
admitting 
the 
temporal 
relations 
to 
a 
share 
in 
the 
nomenclature. 
As 
far 
as 
our 
knowledge 
goes 
there 
is 
no 
psychic 
apparatus 
possessing 
only 
the 
primary 
process, 
and 
in 
so 
far 
it 
is 
a 
theoretic 
fiction; 
but 
so 
much 
is 
based 
on 
fact 
that 
the 
primary 
processes 
are 
present 
in 
the 
apparatus 
from 
the 
beginning, 
while 
the 
secondary 
processes 
develop 
gradually 
in 
the 
course 
of 
life, 
inhibiting 
and 
covering 
the 
primary 
ones, 
and 



gaining 
complete 
mastery 
over 
them 
perhaps 
only 
at 
the 
height 
of 
life. 
Owing 
to 
this 
retarded 
appearance 
of 
the 
secondary 
processes, 
the 
essence 
of 
our 
being, 
consisting 
in 
unconscious 
wish 
feelings, 
can 
neither 
be 
seized 
nor 
inhibited 
by 
the 
foreconscious, 
whose 
part 
is 
once 
for 
all 
restricted 
to 
the 
indication 
of 
the 
most 
suitable 
paths 
for 
the 
wish 
feelings 
originating 
in 
the 
unconscious. 
These 
unconscious 
wishes 
establish 
for 
all 
subsequent 
psychic 
efforts 
a 
compulsion 
to 
which 
they 
have 
to 
submit 
and 
which 
they 
must 
strive 
if 
possible 
to 
divert 
from 
its 
course 
and 
direct 
to 
higher 
aims. 
In 
consequence 
of 
this 
retardation 
of 
the 
foreconscious 
occupation 
a 
large 
sphere 
of 
the 
memory 
material 
remains 
inaccessible. 


Among 
these 
indestructible 
and 
unincumbered 
wish 
feelings 
originating 
from 
the 
infantile 
life, 
there 
are 
also 
some, 
the 
fulfillments 
of 
which 
have 
entered 
into 
a 
relation 
of 
contradiction 
to 
the 
end-presentation 
of 
the 
secondary 
thinking. 
The 
fulfillment 
of 
these 
wishes 
would 
no 
longer 
produce 
an 
affect 
of 
pleasure 
but 
one 
of 
pain; 
_and 
it 
is 
just 
this 
transformation 
of 
affect 
that 
constitutes 
the 
nature 
of 
what 
we 
designate 
as 
"repression," 
in 
which 
we 
recognize 
the 
infantile 
first 
step 
of 
passing 
adverse 
sentence 
or 
of 
rejecting 
through 
reason_. 
To 
investigate 
in 
what 
way 
and 
through 
what 
motive 
forces 
such 
a 
transformation 
can 
be 
produced 
constitutes 
the 
problem 
of 
repression, 
which 
we 
need 
here 
only 
skim 
over. 
It 
will 
suffice 
to 
remark 
that 
such 
a 
transformation 
of 
affect 
occurs 
in 
the 
course 
of 
development 
(one 
may 
think 
of 
the 
appearance 
in 
infantile 
life 
of 
disgust 
which 
was 
originally 
absent), 
and 
that 
it 
is 
connected 
with 
the 
activity 
of 
the 
secondary 
system. 
The 
memories 
from 
which 
the 
unconscious 
wish 
brings 
about 
the 
emotional 
discharge 
have 
never 
been 
accessible 
to 
the 
Forec., 
and 
for 
that 
reason 
their 
emotional 
discharge 
cannot 
be 
inhibited. 
It 
is 
just 
on 
account 
of 
this 
affective 
development 
that 
these 
ideas 
are 
not 
even 
now 
accessible 
to 
the 
foreconscious 
thoughts 
to 
which 
they 
have 
transferred 
their 
wishing 
power. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
the 
principle 
of 
pain 
comes 
into 
play, 
and 
causes 
the 
Forec. 
to 
deviate 
from 
these 
thoughts 
of 
transference. 
The 
latter, 
left 
to 
themselves, 
are 
"repressed," 
and 
thus 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
store 
of 
infantile 
memories, 
from 
the 
very 
beginning 
withdrawn 
from 
the 
Forec., 
becomes 
the 
preliminary 
condition 
of 
repression. 


In 
the 
most 
favorable 
case 
the 
development 
of 
pain 
terminates 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
energy 
has 
been 
withdrawn 
from 
the 
thoughts 
of 
transference 
in 
the 
Forec., 
and 
this 
effect 
characterizes 
the 
intervention 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
pain 
as 



expedient. 
It 
is 
different, 
however, 
if 
the 
repressed 
unconscious 
wish 
receives 
an 
organic 
enforcement 
which 
it 
can 
lend 
to 
its 
thoughts 
of 
transference 
and 
through 
which 
it 
can 
enable 
them 
to 
make 
an 
effort 
towards 
penetration 
with 
their 
excitement, 
even 
after 
they 
have 
been 
abandoned 
by 
the 
occupation 
of 
the 
Forec. 
A 
defensive 
struggle 
then 
ensues, 
inasmuch 
as 
the 
Forec. 
reinforces 
the 
antagonism 
against 
the 
repressed 
ideas, 
and 
subsequently 
this 
leads 
to 
a 
penetration 
by 
the 
thoughts 
of 
transference 
(the 
carriers 
of 
the 
unconscious 
wish) 
in 
some 
form 
of 
compromise 
through 
symptom 
formation. 
But 
from 
the 
moment 
that 
the 
suppressed 
thoughts 
are 
powerfully 
occupied 
by 
the 
unconscious 
wish-feeling 
and 
abandoned 
by 
the 
foreconscious 
occupation, 
they 
succumb 
to 
the 
primary 
psychic 
process 
and 
strive 
only 
for 
motor 
discharge; 
or, 
if 
the 
path 
be 
free, 
for 
hallucinatory 
revival 
of 
the 
desired 
perception 
identity. 
We 
have 
previously 
found, 
empirically, 
that 
the 
incorrect 
processes 
described 
are 
enacted 
only 
with 
thoughts 
that 
exist 
in 
the 
repression. 
We 
now 
grasp 
another 
part 
of 
the 
connection. 
These 
incorrect 
processes 
are 
those 
that 
are 
primary 
in 
the 
psychic 
apparatus; 
_they 
appear 
wherever 
thoughts 
abandoned 
by 
the 
foreconscious 
occupation 
are 
left 
to 
themselves, 
and 
can 
fill 
themselves 
with 
the 
uninhibited 
energy, 
striving 
for 
discharge 
from 
the 
unconscious_. 
We 
may 
add 
a 
few 
further 
observations 
to 
support 
the 
view 
that 
these 
processes 
designated 
"incorrect" 
are 
really 
not 
falsifications 
of 
the 
normal 
defective 
thinking, 
but 
the 
modes 
of 
activity 
of 
the 
psychic 
apparatus 
when 
freed 
from 
inhibition. 
Thus 
we 
see 
that 
the 
transference 
of 
the 
foreconscious 
excitement 
to 
the 
motility 
takes 
place 
according 
to 
the 
same 
processes, 
and 
that 
the 
connection 
of 
the 
foreconscious 
presentations 
with 
words 
readily 
manifest 
the 
same 
displacements 
and 
mixtures 
which 
are 
ascribed 
to 
inattention. 
Finally, 
I 
should 
like 
to 
adduce 
proof 
that 
an 
increase 
of 
work 
necessarily 
results 
from 
the 
inhibition 
of 
these 
primary 
courses 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
gain 
a 
comical 
effect, 
a 
surplus 
to 
be 
discharged 
through 
laughter, 
if 
we 
allow 
these 
streams 
of 
thought 
to 
come 
to 
consciousness. 


The 
theory 
of 
the 
psychoneuroses 
asserts 
with 
complete 
certainty 
that 
only 
sexual 
wish-feelings 
from 
the 
infantile 
life 
experience 
repression 
(emotional 
transformation) 
during 
the 
developmental 
period 
of 
childhood. 
These 
are 
capable 
of 
returning 
to 
activity 
at 
a 
later 
period 
of 
development, 
and 
then 
have 
the 
faculty 
of 
being 
revived, 
either 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
sexual 
constitution, 
which 
is 
really 
formed 
from 
the 
original 
bisexuality, 
or 
in 



consequence 
of 
unfavorable 
influences 
of 
the 
sexual 
life; 
and 
they 
thus 
supply 
the 
motive 
power 
for 
all 
psychoneurotic 
symptom 
formations. 
It 
is 
only 
by 
the 
introduction 
of 
these 
sexual 
forces 
that 
the 
gaps 
still 
demonstrable 
in 
the 
theory 
of 
repression 
can 
be 
filled. 
I 
will 
leave 
it 
undecided 
whether 
the 
postulate 
of 
the 
sexual 
and 
infantile 
may 
also 
be 
asserted 
for 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
dream; 
I 
leave 
this 
here 
unfinished 
because 
I 
have 
already 
passed 
a 
step 
beyond 
the 
demonstrable 
in 
assuming 
that 
the 
dream-wish 
invariably 
originates 
from 
the 
unconscious.[2] 
Nor 
will 
I 
further 
investigate 
the 
difference 
in 
the 
play 
of 
the 
psychic 
forces 
in 
the 
dream 
formation 
and 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
hysterical 
symptoms, 
for 
to 
do 
this 
we 
ought 
to 
possess 
a 
more 
explicit 
knowledge 
of 
one 
of 
the 
members 
to 
be 
compared. 
But 
I 
regard 
another 
point 
as 
important, 
and 
will 
here 
confess 
that 
it 
was 
on 
account 
of 
this 
very 
point 
that 
I 
have 
just 
undertaken 
this 
entire 
discussion 
concerning 
the 
two 
psychic 
systems, 
their 
modes 
of 
operation, 
and 
the 
repression. 
For 
it 
is 
now 
immaterial 
whether 
I 
have 
conceived 
the 
psychological 
relations 
in 
question 
with 
approximate 
correctness, 
or, 
as 
is 
easily 
possible 
in 
such 
a 
difficult 
matter, 
in 
an 
erroneous 
and 
fragmentary 
manner. 
Whatever 
changes 
may 
be 
made 
in 
the 
interpretation 
of 
the 
psychic 
censor 
and 
of 
the 
correct 
and 
of 
the 
abnormal 
elaboration 
of 
the 
dream 
content, 
the 
fact 
nevertheless 
remains 
that 
such 
processes 
are 
active 
in 
dream 
formation, 
and 
that 
essentially 
they 
show 
the 
closest 
analogy 
to 
the 
processes 
observed 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
hysterical 
symptoms. 
The 
dream 
is 
not 
a 
pathological 
phenomenon, 
and 
it 
does 
not 
leave 
behind 
an 
enfeeblement 
of 
the 
mental 
faculties. 
The 
objection 
that 
no 
deduction 
can 
be 
drawn 
regarding 
the 
dreams 
of 
healthy 
persons 
from 
my 
own 
dreams 
and 
from 
those 
of 
neurotic 
patients 
may 
be 
rejected 
without 
comment. 
Hence, 
when 
we 
draw 
conclusions 
from 
the 
phenomena 
as 
to 
their 
motive 
forces, 
we 
recognize 
that 
the 
psychic 
mechanism 
made 
use 
of 
by 
the 
neuroses 
is 
not 
created 
by 
a 
morbid 
disturbance 
of 
the 
psychic 
life, 
but 
is 
found 
ready 
in 
the 
normal 
structure 
of 
the 
psychic 
apparatus. 
The 
two 
psychic 
systems, 
the 
censor 
crossing 
between 
them, 
the 
inhibition 
and 
the 
covering 
of 
the 
one 
activity 
by 
the 
other, 
the 
relations 
of 
both 
to 
consciousness--or 
whatever 
may 
offer 
a 
more 
correct 
interpretation 
of 
the 
actual 
conditions 
in 
their 
stead--all 
these 
belong 
to 
the 
normal 
structure 
of 
our 
psychic 
instrument, 
and 
the 
dream 
points 
out 
for 
us 
one 
of 
the 
roads 
leading 
to 
a 
knowledge 
of 
this 
structure. 
If, 
in 
addition 
to 
our 
knowledge, 
we 
wish 
to 
be 
contented 
with 
a 
minimum 
perfectly 
established, 
we 
shall 
say 
that 
the 
dream 
gives 
us 
proof 
that 
the 



_suppressed, 
material 
continues 
to 
exist 
even 
in 
the 
normal 
person 
and 
remains 
capable 
of 
psychic 
activity_. 
The 
dream 
itself 
is 
one 
of 
the 
manifestations 
of 
this 
suppressed 
material; 
theoretically, 
this 
is 
true 
in 
all 
cases; 
according 
to 
substantial 
experience 
it 
is 
true 
in 
at 
least 
a 
great 
number 
of 
such 
as 
most 
conspicuously 
display 
the 
prominent 
characteristics 
of 
dream 
life. 
The 
suppressed 
psychic 
material, 
which 
in 
the 
waking 
state 
has 
been 
prevented 
from 
expression 
and 
cut 
off 
from 
internal 
perception 
by 
the 
antagonistic 
adjustment 
of 
the 
contradictions, 
finds 
ways 
and 
means 
of 
obtruding 
itself 
on 
consciousness 
during 
the 
night 
under 
the 
domination 
of 
the 
compromise 
formations. 


_"Flectere 
si 
nequeo 
superos, 
Acheronta 
movebo."_ 


At 
any 
rate 
the 
interpretation 
of 
dreams 
is 
the 
via 
regia 
to 
a 
knowledge 
of 
the 
unconscious 
in 
the 
psychic 
life. 


In 
following 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
dream 
we 
have 
made 
some 
progress 
toward 
an 
understanding 
of 
the 
composition 
of 
this 
most 
marvelous 
and 
most 
mysterious 
of 
instruments; 
to 
be 
sure, 
we 
have 
not 
gone 
very 
far, 
but 
enough 
of 
a 
beginning 
has 
been 
made 
to 
allow 
us 
to 
advance 
from 
other 
so-called 
pathological 
formations 
further 
into 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
unconscious. 
Disease-
at 
least 
that 
which 
is 
justly 
termed 
functional--is 
not 
due 
to 
the 
destruction 
of 
this 
apparatus, 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
new 
splittings 
in 
its 
interior; 
it 
is 
rather 
to 
be 
explained 
dynamically 
through 
the 
strengthening 
and 
weakening 
of 
the 
components 
in 
the 
play 
of 
forces 
by 
which 
so 
many 
activities 
are 
concealed 
during 
the 
normal 
function. 
We 
have 
been 
able 
to 
show 
in 
another 
place 
how 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
apparatus 
from 
the 
two 
systems 
permits 
a 
subtilization 
even 
of 
the 
normal 
activity 
which 
would 
be 
impossible 
for 
a 
single 
system. 


[1] 
_Cf._ 
the 
significant 
observations 
by 
J. 
Bueuer 
in 
our 
Studies 
on 
Hysteria, 
1895, 
and 
2nd 
ed. 
1909. 
[2] 
Here, 
as 
in 
other 
places, 
there 
are 
gaps 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
the 
subject, 
which 
I 
have 
left 
intentionally, 
because 
to 
fill 
them 
up 
would 
require 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
too 
great 
effort, 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
an 
extensive 
reference 
to 
material 
that 
is 
foreign 
to 
the 
dream. 
Thus 
I 
have 
avoided 
stating 
whether 
I 
connect 
with 
the 
word 
"suppressed" 
another 
sense 
than 
with 
the 
word 
"repressed." 
It 
has 
been 
made 
clear 
only 
that 
the 
latter 
emphasizes 
more 
than 

the 
former 
the 
relation 
to 
the 
unconscious. 
I 
have 
not 
entered 
into 
the 
cognate 
problem 
why 
the 
dream 
thoughts 
also 
experience 
distortion 
by 
the 
censor 
when 
they 
abandon 
the 
progressive 
continuation 
to 
consciousness 
and 
choose 
the 
path 
of 
regression. 
I 
have 
been 
above 
all 
anxious 
to 
awaken 
an 
interest 
in 
the 
problems 
to 
which 
the 
further 
analysis 
of 
the 
dreamwork 
leads 
and 
to 
indicate 
the 
other 
themes 
which 
meet 
these 
on 
the 
way. 
It 
was 
not 
always 
easy 
to 
decide 
just 
where 
the 
pursuit 
should 
be 
discontinued. 
That 
I 
have 
not 
treated 
exhaustively 
the 
part 
played 
in 
the 
dream 
by 
the 
psychosexual 
life 
and 
have 
avoided 
the 
interpretation 
of 
dreams 
of 
an 
obvious 
sexual 
content 
is 
due 
to 
a 
special 
reason 
which 
may 
not 
come 
up 
to 
the 
reader's 
expectation. 
To 
be 
sure, 
it 
is 
very 
far 
from 
my 
ideas 
and 
the 
principles 
expressed 
by 
me 
in 
neuropathology 
to 
regard 
the 
sexual 
life 
as 
a 
"pudendum" 
which 
should 
be 
left 
unconsidered 
by 
the 
physician 
and 
the 
scientific 
investigator. 
I 
also 
consider 
ludicrous 
the 
moral 
indignation 
which 
prompted 
the 
translator 
of 
Artemidoros 
of 
Daldis 
to 
keep 
from 
the 
reader's 
knowledge 
the 
chapter 
on 
sexual 
dreams 
contained 
in 
the 
Symbolism 
of 
the 
Dreams. 
As 
for 
myself, 
I 
have 
been 
actuated 
solely 
by 
the 
conviction 
that 
in 
the 
explanation 
of 
sexual 
dreams 
I 
should 
be 
bound 
to 
entangle 
myself 
deeply 
in 
the 
still 
unexplained 
problems 
of 
perversion 
and 
bisexuality; 
and 
for 
that 
reason 
I 
have 
reserved 
this 
material 
for 
another 
connection. 



IX 


THE 
UNCONSCIOUS 
AND 
CONSCIOUSNESS--REALITY 


On 
closer 
inspection 
we 
find 
that 
it 
is 
not 
the 
existence 
of 
two 
systems 
near 
the 
motor 
end 
of 
the 
apparatus 
but 
of 
two 
kinds 
of 
processes 
or 
modes 
of 
emotional 
discharge, 
the 
assumption 
of 
which 
was 
explained 
in 
the 
psychological 
discussions 
of 
the 
previous 
chapter. 
This 
can 
make 
no 
difference 
for 
us, 
for 
we 
must 
always 
be 
ready 
to 
drop 
our 
auxiliary 
ideas 
whenever 
we 
deem 
ourselves 
in 
position 
to 
replace 
them 
by 
something 
else 
approaching 
more 
closely 
to 
the 
unknown 
reality. 
Let 
us 
now 
try 
to 
correct 
some 
views 
which 
might 
be 
erroneously 
formed 
as 
long 
as 
we 
regarded 
the 
two 
systems 
in 
the 
crudest 
and 
most 
obvious 
sense 
as 
two 
localities 
within 
the 
psychic 
apparatus, 
views 
which 
have 
left 
their 
traces 
in 
the 
terms 
"repression" 
and 
"penetration." 
Thus, 
when 
we 
say 
that 
an 
unconscious 
idea 
strives 
for 
transference 
into 
the 
foreconscious 
in 
order 
later 
to 
penetrate 
consciousness, 
we 
do 
not 
mean 
that 
a 
second 
idea 
is 
to 
be 
formed 
situated 
in 
a 
new 
locality 
like 
an 
interlineation 
near 
which 
the 
original 
continues 
to 
remain; 
also, 
when 
we 
speak 
of 
penetration 
into 
consciousness, 
we 
wish 
carefully 
to 
avoid 
any 
idea 
of 
change 
of 
locality. 
When 
we 
say 
that 
a 
foreconscious 
idea 
is 
repressed 
and 
subsequently 
taken 
up 
by 
the 
unconscious, 
we 
might 
be 
tempted 
by 
these 
figures, 
borrowed 
from 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
struggle 
over 
a 
territory, 
to 
assume 
that 
an 
arrangement 
is 
really 
broken 
up 
in 
one 
psychic 
locality 
and 
replaced 
by 
a 
new 
one 
in 
the 
other 
locality. 
For 
these 
comparisons 
we 
substitute 
what 
would 
seem 
to 
correspond 
better 
with 
the 
real 
state 
of 
affairs 
by 
saying 
that 
an 
energy 
occupation 
is 
displaced 
to 
or 
withdrawn 
from 
a 
certain 
arrangement 
so 
that 
the 
psychic 
formation 
falls 
under 
the 
domination 
of 
a 
system 
or 
is 
withdrawn 
from 
the 
same. 
Here 
again 
we 
replace 
a 
topical 
mode 
of 
presentation 
by 
a 
dynamic; 
it 
is 
not 
the 
psychic 
formation 
that 
appears 
to 
us 
as 
the 
moving 
factor 
but 
the 
innervation 
of 
the 
same. 


I 
deem 
it 
appropriate 
and 
justifiable, 
however, 
to 
apply 
ourselves 
still 
further 
to 
the 
illustrative 
conception 
of 
the 
two 
systems. 
We 
shall 
avoid 
any 
misapplication 
of 
this 
manner 
of 
representation 
if 
we 
remember 
that 
presentations, 
thoughts, 
and 
psychic 
formations 
should 
generally 
not 
be 
localized 
in 
the 
organic 
elements 
of 
the 
nervous 
system, 
but, 
so 
to 
speak, 
between 
them, 
where 
resistances 
and 
paths 
form 
the 
correlate 
corresponding 



to 
them. 
Everything 
that 
can 
become 
an 
object 
of 
our 
internal 
perception 
is 
virtual, 
like 
the 
image 
in 
the 
telescope 
produced 
by 
the 
passage 
of 
the 
rays 
of 
light. 
But 
we 
are 
justified 
in 
assuming 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
systems, 
which 
have 
nothing 
psychic 
in 
themselves 
and 
which 
never 
become 
accessible 
to 
our 
psychic 
perception, 
corresponding 
to 
the 
lenses 
of 
the 
telescope 
which 
design 
the 
image. 
If 
we 
continue 
this 
comparison, 
we 
may 
say 
that 
the 
censor 
between 
two 
systems 
corresponds 
to 
the 
refraction 
of 
rays 
during 
their 
passage 
into 
a 
new 
medium. 


Thus 
far 
we 
have 
made 
psychology 
on 
our 
own 
responsibility; 
it 
is 
now 
time 
to 
examine 
the 
theoretical 
opinions 
governing 
present-day 
psychology 
and 
to 
test 
their 
relation 
to 
our 
theories. 
The 
question 
of 
the 
unconscious, 
in 
psychology 
is, 
according 
to 
the 
authoritative 
words 
of 
Lipps, 
less 
a 
psychological 
question 
than 
the 
question 
of 
psychology. 
As 
long 
as 
psychology 
settled 
this 
question 
with 
the 
verbal 
explanation 
that 
the 
"psychic" 
is 
the 
"conscious" 
and 
that 
"unconscious 
psychic 
occurrences" 
are 
an 
obvious 
contradiction, 
a 
psychological 
estimate 
of 
the 
observations 
gained 
by 
the 
physician 
from 
abnormal 
mental 
states 
was 
precluded. 
The 
physician 
and 
the 
philosopher 
agree 
only 
when 
both 
acknowledge 
that 
unconscious 
psychic 
processes 
are 
"the 
appropriate 
and 
well-justified 
expression 
for 
an 
established 
fact." 
The 
physician 
cannot 
but 
reject 
with 
a 
shrug 
of 
his 
shoulders 
the 
assertion 
that 
"consciousness 
is 
the 
indispensable 
quality 
of 
the 
psychic"; 
he 
may 
assume, 
if 
his 
respect 
for 
the 
utterings 
of 
the 
philosophers 
still 
be 
strong 
enough, 
that 
he 
and 
they 
do 
not 
treat 
the 
same 
subject 
and 
do 
not 
pursue 
the 
same 
science. 
For 
a 
single 
intelligent 
observation 
of 
the 
psychic 
life 
of 
a 
neurotic, 
a 
single 
analysis 
of 
a 
dream 
must 
force 
upon 
him 
the 
unalterable 
conviction 
that 
the 
most 
complicated 
and 
correct 
mental 
operations, 
to 
which 
no 
one 
will 
refuse 
the 
name 
of 
psychic 
occurrences, 
may 
take 
place 
without 
exciting 
the 
consciousness 
of 
the 
person. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
physician 
does 
not 
learn 
of 
these 
unconscious 
processes 
until 
they 
have 
exerted 
such 
an 
effect 
on 
consciousness 
as 
to 
admit 
communication 
or 
observation. 
But 
this 
effect 
of 
consciousness 
may 
show 
a 
psychic 
character 
widely 
differing 
from 
the 
unconscious 
process, 
so 
that 
the 
internal 
perception 
cannot 
possibly 
recognize 
the 
one 
as 
a 
substitute 
for 
the 
other. 
The 
physician 
must 
reserve 
for 
himself 
the 
right 
to 
penetrate, 
by 
a 
process 
of 
deduction, 
from 
the 
effect 
on 
consciousness 
to 
the 
unconscious 
psychic 
process; 
he 
learns 
in 
this 
way 
that 
the 
effect 
on 
consciousness 
is 
only 
a 
remote 
psychic 



product 
of 
the 
unconscious 
process 
and 
that 
the 
latter 
has 
not 
become 
conscious 
as 
such; 
that 
it 
has 
been 
in 
existence 
and 
operative 
without 
betraying 
itself 
in 
any 
way 
to 
consciousness. 


A 
reaction 
from 
the 
over-estimation 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
consciousness 
becomes 
the 
indispensable 
preliminary 
condition 
for 
any 
correct 
insight 
into 
the 
behavior 
of 
the 
psychic. 
In 
the 
words 
of 
Lipps, 
the 
unconscious 
must 
be 
accepted 
as 
the 
general 
basis 
of 
the 
psychic 
life. 
The 
unconscious 
is 
the 
larger 
circle 
which 
includes 
within 
itself 
the 
smaller 
circle 
of 
the 
conscious; 
everything 
conscious 
has 
its 
preliminary 
step 
in 
the 
unconscious, 
whereas 
the 
unconscious 
may 
stop 
with 
this 
step 
and 
still 
claim 
full 
value 
as 
a 
psychic 
activity. 
Properly 
speaking, 
the 
unconscious 
is 
the 
real 
psychic; 
_its 
inner 
nature 
is 
just 
as 
unknown 
to 
us 
as 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
external 
world, 
and 
it 
is 
just 
as 
imperfectly 
reported 
to 
us 
through 
the 
data 
of 
consciousness 
as 
is 
the 
external 
world 
through 
the 
indications 
of 
our 
sensory 
organs_. 


A 
series 
of 
dream 
problems 
which 
have 
intensely 
occupied 
older 
authors 
will 
be 
laid 
aside 
when 
the 
old 
opposition 
between 
conscious 
life 
and 
dream 
life 
is 
abandoned 
and 
the 
unconscious 
psychic 
assigned 
to 
its 
proper 
place. 
Thus 
many 
of 
the 
activities 
whose 
performances 
in 
the 
dream 
have 
excited 
our 
admiration 
are 
now 
no 
longer 
to 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
dream 
but 
to 
unconscious 
thinking, 
which 
is 
also 
active 
during 
the 
day. 
If, 
according 
to 
Scherner, 
the 
dream 
seems 
to 
play 
with 
a 
symboling 
representation 
of 
the 
body, 
we 
know 
that 
this 
is 
the 
work 
of 
certain 
unconscious 
phantasies 
which 
have 
probably 
given 
in 
to 
sexual 
emotions, 
and 
that 
these 
phantasies 
come 
to 
expression 
not 
only 
in 
dreams 
but 
also 
in 
hysterical 
phobias 
and 
in 
other 
symptoms. 
If 
the 
dream 
continues 
and 
settles 
activities 
of 
the 
day 
and 
even 
brings 
to 
light 
valuable 
inspirations, 
we 
have 
only 
to 
subtract 
from 
it 
the 
dream 
disguise 
as 
a 
feat 
of 
dream-work 
and 
a 
mark 
of 
assistance 
from 
obscure 
forces 
in 
the 
depth 
of 
the 
mind 
(_cf._ 
the 
devil 
in 
Tartini's 
sonata 
dream). 
The 
intellectual 
task 
as 
such 
must 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
same 
psychic 
forces 
which 
perform 
all 
such 
tasks 
during 
the 
day. 
We 
are 
probably 
far 
too 
much 
inclined 
to 
over-estimate 
the 
conscious 
character 
even 
of 
intellectual 
and 
artistic 
productions. 
From 
the 
communications 
of 
some 
of 
the 
most 
highly 
productive 
persons, 
such 
as 
Goethe 
and 
Helmholtz, 
we 
learn, 
indeed, 
that 
the 
most 
essential 
and 
original 
parts 
in 
their 
creations 
came 
to 
them 
in 
the 
form 
of 
inspirations 
and 
reached 
their 
perceptions 
almost 
finished. 
There 
is 
nothing 
strange 
about 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
conscious 
activity 
in 
other 
cases 
where 
there 
was 
a 



concerted 
effort 
of 
all 
the 
psychic 
forces. 
But 
it 
is 
a 
much 
abused 
privilege 
of 
the 
conscious 
activity 
that 
it 
is 
allowed 
to 
hide 
from 
us 
all 
other 
activities 
wherever 
it 
participates. 


It 
will 
hardly 
be 
worth 
while 
to 
take 
up 
the 
historical 
significance 
of 
dreams 
as 
a 
special 
subject. 
Where, 
for 
instance, 
a 
chieftain 
has 
been 
urged 
through 
a 
dream 
to 
engage 
in 
a 
bold 
undertaking 
the 
success 
of 
which 
has 
had 
the 
effect 
of 
changing 
history, 
a 
new 
problem 
results 
only 
so 
long 
as 
the 
dream, 
regarded 
as 
a 
strange 
power, 
is 
contrasted 
with 
other 
more 
familiar 
psychic 
forces; 
the 
problem, 
however, 
disappears 
when 
we 
regard 
the 
dream 
as 
a 
form 
of 
expression 
for 
feelings 
which 
are 
burdened 
with 
resistance 
during 
the 
day 
and 
which 
can 
receive 
reinforcements 
at 
night 
from 
deep 
emotional 
sources. 
But 
the 
great 
respect 
shown 
by 
the 
ancients 
for 
the 
dream 
is 
based 
on 
a 
correct 
psychological 
surmise. 
It 
is 
a 
homage 
paid 
to 
the 
unsubdued 
and 
indestructible 
in 
the 
human 
mind, 
and 
to 
the 
demoniacal 
which 
furnishes 
the 
dream-wish 
and 
which 
we 
find 
again 
in 
our 
unconscious. 


Not 
inadvisedly 
do 
I 
use 
the 
expression 
"in 
our 
unconscious," 
for 
what 
we 
so 
designate 
does 
not 
coincide 
with 
the 
unconscious 
of 
the 
philosophers, 
nor 
with 
the 
unconscious 
of 
Lipps. 
In 
the 
latter 
uses 
it 
is 
intended 
to 
designate 
only 
the 
opposite 
of 
conscious. 
That 
there 
are 
also 
unconscious 
psychic 
processes 
beside 
the 
conscious 
ones 
is 
the 
hotly 
contested 
and 
energetically 
defended 
issue. 
Lipps 
gives 
us 
the 
more 
far-reaching 
theory 
that 
everything 
psychic 
exists 
as 
unconscious, 
but 
that 
some 
of 
it 
may 
exist 
also 
as 
conscious. 
But 
it 
was 
not 
to 
prove 
this 
theory 
that 
we 
have 
adduced 
the 
phenomena 
of 
the 
dream 
and 
of 
the 
hysterical 
symptom 
formation; 
the 
observation 
of 
normal 
life 
alone 
suffices 
to 
establish 
its 
correctness 
beyond 
any 
doubt. 
The 
new 
fact 
that 
we 
have 
learned 
from 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
psychopathological 
formations, 
and 
indeed 
from 
their 
first 
member, 
viz. 
dreams, 
is 
that 
the 
unconscious--hence 
the 
psychic--occurs 
as 
a 
function 
of 
two 
separate 
systems 
and 
that 
it 
occurs 
as 
such 
even 
in 
normal 
psychic 
life. 
Consequently 
there 
are 
two 
kinds 
of 
unconscious, 
which 
we 
do 
not 
as 
yet 
find 
distinguished 
by 
the 
psychologists. 
Both 
are 
unconscious 
in 
the 
psychological 
sense; 
but 
in 
our 
sense 
the 
first, 
which 
we 
call 
Unc., 
is 
likewise 
incapable 
of 
consciousness, 
whereas 
the 
second 
we 
term 
"Forec." 
because 
its 
emotions, 
after 
the 
observance 
of 
certain 
rules, 
can 
reach 
consciousness, 
perhaps 
not 
before 
they 
have 
again 
undergone 
censorship, 
but 
still 
regardless 
of 
the 
Unc. 
system. 
The 
fact 
that 
in 
order 
to 
attain 
consciousness 
the 
emotions 
must 
traverse 
an 



unalterable 
series 
of 
events 
or 
succession 
of 
instances, 
as 
is 
betrayed 
through 
their 
alteration 
by 
the 
censor, 
has 
helped 
us 
to 
draw 
a 
comparison 
from 
spatiality. 
We 
described 
the 
relations 
of 
the 
two 
systems 
to 
each 
other 
and 
to 
consciousness 
by 
saying 
that 
the 
system 
Forec. 
is 
like 
a 
screen 
between 
the 
system 
Unc. 
and 
consciousness. 
The 
system 
Forec. 
not 
only 
bars 
access 
to 
consciousness, 
but 
also 
controls 
the 
entrance 
to 
voluntary 
motility 
and 
is 
capable 
of 
sending 
out 
a 
sum 
of 
mobile 
energy, 
a 
portion 
of 
which 
is 
familiar 
to 
us 
as 
attention. 


We 
must 
also 
steer 
clear 
of 
the 
distinctions 
superconscious 
and 
subconscious 
which 
have 
found 
so 
much 
favor 
in 
the 
more 
recent 
literature 
on 
the 
psychoneuroses, 
for 
just 
such 
a 
distinction 
seems 
to 
emphasize 
the 
equivalence 
of 
the 
psychic 
and 
the 
conscious. 


What 
part 
now 
remains 
in 
our 
description 
of 
the 
once 
all-powerful 
and 
all-
overshadowing 
consciousness? 
None 
other 
than 
that 
of 
a 
sensory 
organ 
for 
the 
perception 
of 
psychic 
qualities. 
According 
to 
the 
fundamental 
idea 
of 
schematic 
undertaking 
we 
can 
conceive 
the 
conscious 
perception 
only 
as 
the 
particular 
activity 
of 
an 
independent 
system 
for 
which 
the 
abbreviated 
designation 
"Cons." 
commends 
itself. 
This 
system 
we 
conceive 
to 
be 
similar 
in 
its 
mechanical 
characteristics 
to 
the 
perception 
system 
P, 
hence 
excitable 
by 
qualities 
and 
incapable 
of 
retaining 
the 
trace 
of 
changes, 
_i.e._ 
it 
is 
devoid 
of 
memory. 
The 
psychic 
apparatus 
which, 
with 
the 
sensory 
organs 
of 
the 
P-
system, 
is 
turned 
to 
the 
outer 
world, 
is 
itself 
the 
outer 
world 
for 
the 
sensory 
organ 
of 
Cons.; 
the 
teleological 
justification 
of 
which 
rests 
on 
this 
relationship. 
We 
are 
here 
once 
more 
confronted 
with 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
succession 
of 
instances 
which 
seems 
to 
dominate 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
apparatus. 
The 
material 
under 
excitement 
flows 
to 
the 
Cons, 
sensory 
organ 
from 
two 
sides, 
firstly 
from 
the 
P-system 
whose 
excitement, 
qualitatively 
determined, 
probably 
experiences 
a 
new 
elaboration 
until 
it 
comes 
to 
conscious 
perception; 
and, 
secondly, 
from 
the 
interior 
of 
the 
apparatus 
itself, 
the 
quantitative 
processes 
of 
which 
are 
perceived 
as 
a 
qualitative 
series 
of 
pleasure 
and 
pain 
as 
soon 
as 
they 
have 
undergone 
certain 
changes. 


The 
philosophers, 
who 
have 
learned 
that 
correct 
and 
highly 
complicated 
thought 
structures 
are 
possible 
even 
without 
the 
coöperation 
of 
consciousness, 
have 
found 
it 
difficult 
to 
attribute 
any 
function 
to 
consciousness; 
it 
has 
appeared 
to 
them 
a 
superfluous 
mirroring 
of 
the 



perfected 
psychic 
process. 
The 
analogy 
of 
our 
Cons. 
system 
with 
the 
systems 
of 
perception 
relieves 
us 
of 
this 
embarrassment. 
We 
see 
that 
perception 
through 
our 
sensory 
organs 
results 
in 
directing 
the 
occupation 
of 
attention 
to 
those 
paths 
on 
which 
the 
incoming 
sensory 
excitement 
is 
diffused; 
the 
qualitative 
excitement 
of 
the 
P-system 
serves 
the 
mobile 
quantity 
of 
the 
psychic 
apparatus 
as 
a 
regulator 
for 
its 
discharge. 
We 
may 
claim 
the 
same 
function 
for 
the 
overlying 
sensory 
organ 
of 
the 
Cons. 
system. 
By 
assuming 
new 
qualities, 
it 
furnishes 
a 
new 
contribution 
toward 
the 
guidance 
and 
suitable 
distribution 
of 
the 
mobile 
occupation 
quantities. 
By 
means 
of 
the 
perceptions 
of 
pleasure 
and 
pain, 
it 
influences 
the 
course 
of 
the 
occupations 
within 
the 
psychic 
apparatus, 
which 
normally 
operates 
unconsciously 
and 
through 
the 
displacement 
of 
quantities. 
It 
is 
probable 
that 
the 
principle 
of 
pain 
first 
regulates 
the 
displacements 
of 
occupation 
automatically, 
but 
it 
is 
quite 
possible 
that 
the 
consciousness 
of 
these 
qualities 
adds 
a 
second 
and 
more 
subtle 
regulation 
which 
may 
even 
oppose 
the 
first 
and 
perfect 
the 
working 
capacity 
of 
the 
apparatus 
by 
placing 
it 
in 
a 
position 
contrary 
to 
its 
original 
design 
for 
occupying 
and 
developing 
even 
that 
which 
is 
connected 
with 
the 
liberation 
of 
pain. 
We 
learn 
from 
neuropsychology 
that 
an 
important 
part 
in 
the 
functional 
activity 
of 
the 
apparatus 
is 
attributed 
to 
such 
regulations 
through 
the 
qualitative 
excitation 
of 
the 
sensory 
organs. 
The 
automatic 
control 
of 
the 
primary 
principle 
of 
pain 
and 
the 
restriction 
of 
mental 
capacity 
connected 
with 
it 
are 
broken 
by 
the 
sensible 
regulations, 
which 
in 
their 
turn 
are 
again 
automatisms. 
We 
learn 
that 
the 
repression 
which, 
though 
originally 
expedient, 
terminates 
nevertheless 
in 
a 
harmful 
rejection 
of 
inhibition 
and 
of 
psychic 
domination, 
is 
so 
much 
more 
easily 
accomplished 
with 
reminiscences 
than 
with 
perceptions, 
because 
in 
the 
former 
there 
is 
no 
increase 
in 
occupation 
through 
the 
excitement 
of 
the 
psychic 
sensory 
organs. 
When 
an 
idea 
to 
be 
rejected 
has 
once 
failed 
to 
become 
conscious 
because 
it 
has 
succumbed 
to 
repression, 
it 
can 
be 
repressed 
on 
other 
occasions 
only 
because 
it 
has 
been 
withdrawn 
from 
conscious 
perception 
on 
other 
grounds. 
These 
are 
hints 
employed 
by 
therapy 
in 
order 
to 
bring 
about 
a 
retrogression 
of 
accomplished 
repressions. 


The 
value 
of 
the 
over-occupation 
which 
is 
produced 
by 
the 
regulating 
influence 
of 
the 
Cons. 
sensory 
organ 
on 
the 
mobile 
quantity, 
is 
demonstrated 
in 
the 
teleological 
connection 
by 
nothing 
more 
clearly 
than 
by 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
new 
series 
of 
qualities 
and 
consequently 
a 
new 
regulation 
which 
constitutes 



the 
precedence 
of 
man 
over 
the 
animals. 
For 
the 
mental 
processes 
are 
in 
themselves 
devoid 
of 
quality 
except 
for 
the 
excitements 
of 
pleasure 
and 
pain 
accompanying 
them, 
which, 
as 
we 
know, 
are 
to 
be 
held 
in 
check 
as 
possible 
disturbances 
of 
thought. 
In 
order 
to 
endow 
them 
with 
a 
quality, 
they 
are 
associated 
in 
man 
with 
verbal 
memories, 
the 
qualitative 
remnants 
of 
which 
suffice 
to 
draw 
upon 
them 
the 
attention 
of 
consciousness 
which 
in 
turn 
endows 
thought 
with 
a 
new 
mobile 
energy. 


The 
manifold 
problems 
of 
consciousness 
in 
their 
entirety 
can 
be 
examined 
only 
through 
an 
analysis 
of 
the 
hysterical 
mental 
process. 
From 
this 
analysis 
we 
receive 
the 
impression 
that 
the 
transition 
from 
the 
foreconscious 
to 
the 
occupation 
of 
consciousness 
is 
also 
connected 
with 
a 
censorship 
similar 
to 
the 
one 
between 
the 
Unc. 
and 
the 
Forec. 
This 
censorship, 
too, 
begins 
to 
act 
only 
with 
the 
reaching 
of 
a 
certain 
quantitative 
degree, 
so 
that 
few 
intense 
thought 
formations 
escape 
it. 
Every 
possible 
case 
of 
detention 
from 
consciousness, 
as 
well 
as 
of 
penetration 
to 
consciousness, 
under 
restriction 
is 
found 
included 
within 
the 
picture 
of 
the 
psychoneurotic 
phenomena; 
every 
case 
points 
to 
the 
intimate 
and 
twofold 
connection 
between 
the 
censor 
and 
consciousness. 
I 
shall 
conclude 
these 
psychological 
discussions 
with 
the 
report 
of 
two 
such 
occurrences. 


On 
the 
occasion 
of 
a 
consultation 
a 
few 
years 
ago 
the 
subject 
was 
an 
intelligent 
and 
innocent-looking 
girl. 
Her 
attire 
was 
strange; 
whereas 
a 
woman's 
garb 
is 
usually 
groomed 
to 
the 
last 
fold, 
she 
had 
one 
of 
her 
stockings 
hanging 
down 
and 
two 
of 
her 
waist 
buttons 
opened. 
She 
complained 
of 
pains 
in 
one 
of 
her 
legs, 
and 
exposed 
her 
leg 
unrequested. 
Her 
chief 
complaint, 
however, 
was 
in 
her 
own 
words 
as 
follows: 
She 
had 
a 
feeling 
in 
her 
body 
as 
if 
something 
was 
stuck 
into 
it 
which 
moved 
to 
and 
fro 
and 
made 
her 
tremble 
through 
and 
through. 
This 
sometimes 
made 
her 
whole 
body 
stiff. 
On 
hearing 
this, 
my 
colleague 
in 
consultation 
looked 
at 
me; 
the 
complaint 
was 
quite 
plain 
to 
him. 
To 
both 
of 
us 
it 
seemed 
peculiar 
that 
the 
patient's 
mother 
thought 
nothing 
of 
the 
matter; 
of 
course 
she 
herself 
must 
have 
been 
repeatedly 
in 
the 
situation 
described 
by 
her 
child. 
As 
for 
the 
girl, 
she 
had 
no 
idea 
of 
the 
import 
of 
her 
words 
or 
she 
would 
never 
have 
allowed 
them 
to 
pass 
her 
lips. 
Here 
the 
censor 
had 
been 
deceived 
so 
successfully 
that 
under 
the 
mask 
of 
an 
innocent 
complaint 
a 
phantasy 
was 
admitted 
to 
consciousness 
which 
otherwise 
would 
have 
remained 
in 
the 
foreconscious. 



Another 
example: 
I 
began 
the 
psychoanalytic 
treatment 
of 
a 
boy 
of 
fourteen 
years 
who 
was 
suffering 
from 
tic 
convulsif, 
hysterical 
vomiting, 
headache, 
&c., 
by 
assuring 
him 
that, 
after 
closing 
his 
eyes, 
he 
would 
see 
pictures 
or 
have 
ideas, 
which 
I 
requested 
him 
to 
communicate 
to 
me. 
He 
answered 
by 
describing 
pictures. 
The 
last 
impression 
he 
had 
received 
before 
coming 
to 
me 
was 
visually 
revived 
in 
his 
memory. 
He 
had 
played 
a 
game 
of 
checkers 
with 
his 
uncle, 
and 
now 
saw 
the 
checkerboard 
before 
him. 
He 
commented 
on 
various 
positions 
that 
were 
favorable 
or 
unfavorable, 
on 
moves 
that 
were 
not 
safe 
to 
make. 
He 
then 
saw 
a 
dagger 
lying 
on 
the 
checker-board, 
an 
object 
belonging 
to 
his 
father, 
but 
transferred 
to 
the 
checker-board 
by 
his 
phantasy. 
Then 
a 
sickle 
was 
lying 
on 
the 
board; 
next 
a 
scythe 
was 
added; 
and, 
finally, 
he 
beheld 
the 
likeness 
of 
an 
old 
peasant 
mowing 
the 
grass 
in 
front 
of 
the 
boy's 
distant 
parental 
home. 
A 
few 
days 
later 
I 
discovered 
the 
meaning 
of 
this 
series 
of 
pictures. 
Disagreeable 
family 
relations 
had 
made 
the 
boy 
nervous. 
It 
was 
the 
case 
of 
a 
strict 
and 
crabbed 
father 
who 
lived 
unhappily 
with 
his 
mother, 
and 
whose 
educational 
methods 
consisted 
in 
threats; 
of 
the 
separation 
of 
his 
father 
from 
his 
tender 
and 
delicate 
mother, 
and 
the 
remarrying 
of 
his 
father, 
who 
one 
day 
brought 
home 
a 
young 
woman 
as 
his 
new 
mamma. 
The 
illness 
of 
the 
fourteen-year-old 
boy 
broke 
out 
a 
few 
days 
later. 
It 
was 
the 
suppressed 
anger 
against 
his 
father 
that 
had 
composed 
these 
pictures 
into 
intelligible 
allusions. 
The 
material 
was 
furnished 
by 
a 
reminiscence 
from 
mythology, 
The 
sickle 
was 
the 
one 
with 
which 
Zeus 
castrated 
his 
father; 
the 
scythe 
and 
the 
likeness 
of 
the 
peasant 
represented 
Kronos, 
the 
violent 
old 
man 
who 
eats 
his 
children 
and 
upon 
whom 
Zeus 
wreaks 
vengeance 
in 
so 
unfilial 
a 
manner. 
The 
marriage 
of 
the 
father 
gave 
the 
boy 
an 
opportunity 
to 
return 
the 
reproaches 
and 
threats 
of 
his 
father--which 
had 
previously 
been 
made 
because 
the 
child 
played 
with 
his 
genitals 
(the 
checkerboard; 
the 
prohibitive 
moves; 
the 
dagger 
with 
which 
a 
person 
may 
be 
killed). 
We 
have 
here 
long 
repressed 
memories 
and 
their 
unconscious 
remnants 
which, 
under 
the 
guise 
of 
senseless 
pictures 
have 
slipped 
into 
consciousness 
by 
devious 
paths 
left 
open 
to 
them. 


I 
should 
then 
expect 
to 
find 
the 
theoretical 
value 
of 
the 
study 
of 
dreams 
in 
its 
contribution 
to 
psychological 
knowledge 
and 
in 
its 
preparation 
for 
an 
understanding 
of 
neuroses. 
Who 
can 
foresee 
the 
importance 
of 
a 
thorough 
knowledge 
of 
the 
structure 
and 
activities 
of 
the 
psychic 
apparatus 
when 
even 
our 
present 
state 
of 
knowledge 
produces 
a 
happy 
therapeutic 
influence 
in 
the 



curable 
forms 
of 
the 
psychoneuroses? 
What 
about 
the 
practical 
value 
of 
such 
study 
some 
one 
may 
ask, 
for 
psychic 
knowledge 
and 
for 
the 
discovering 
of 
the 
secret 
peculiarities 
of 
individual 
character? 
Have 
not 
the 
unconscious 
feelings 
revealed 
by 
the 
dream 
the 
value 
of 
real 
forces 
in 
the 
psychic 
life? 
Should 
we 
take 
lightly 
the 
ethical 
significance 
of 
the 
suppressed 
wishes 
which, 
as 
they 
now 
create 
dreams, 
may 
some 
day 
create 
other 
things? 


I 
do 
not 
feel 
justified 
in 
answering 
these 
questions. 
I 
have 
not 
thought 
further 
upon 
this 
side 
of 
the 
dream 
problem. 
I 
believe, 
however, 
that 
at 
all 
events 
the 
Roman 
Emperor 
was 
in 
the 
wrong 
who 
ordered 
one 
of 
his 
subjects 
executed 
because 
the 
latter 
dreamt 
that 
he 
had 
killed 
the 
Emperor. 
He 
should 
first 
have 
endeavored 
to 
discover 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
dream; 
most 
probably 
it 
was 
not 
what 
it 
seemed 
to 
be. 
And 
even 
if 
a 
dream 
of 
different 
content 
had 
the 
significance 
of 
this 
offense 
against 
majesty, 
it 
would 
still 
have 
been 
in 
place 
to 
remember 
the 
words 
of 
Plato, 
that 
the 
virtuous 
man 
contents 
himself 
with 
dreaming 
that 
which 
the 
wicked 
man 
does 
in 
actual 
life. 
I 
am 
therefore 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
it 
is 
best 
to 
accord 
freedom 
to 
dreams. 
Whether 
any 
reality 
is 
to 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
unconscious 
wishes, 
and 
in 
what 
sense, 
I 
am 
not 
prepared 
to 
say 
offhand. 
Reality 
must 
naturally 
be 
denied 
to 
all 
transition--and 
intermediate 
thoughts. 
If 
we 
had 
before 
us 
the 
unconscious 
wishes, 
brought 
to 
their 
last 
and 
truest 
expression, 
we 
should 
still 
do 
well 
to 
remember 
that 
more 
than 
one 
single 
form 
of 
existence 
must 
be 
ascribed 
to 
the 
psychic 
reality. 
Action 
and 
the 
conscious 
expression 
of 
thought 
mostly 
suffice 
for 
the 
practical 
need 
of 
judging 
a 
man's 
character. 
Action, 
above 
all, 
merits 
to 
be 
placed 
in 
the 
first 
rank; 
for 
many 
of 
the 
impulses 
penetrating 
consciousness 
are 
neutralized 
by 
real 
forces 
of 
the 
psychic 
life 
before 
they 
are 
converted 
into 
action; 
indeed, 
the 
reason 
why 
they 
frequently 
do 
not 
encounter 
any 
psychic 
obstacle 
on 
their 
way 
is 
because 
the 
unconscious 
is 
certain 
of 
their 
meeting 
with 
resistances 
later. 
In 
any 
case 
it 
is 
instructive 
to 
become 
familiar 
with 
the 
much 
raked-up 
soil 
from 
which 
our 
virtues 
proudly 
arise. 
For 
the 
complication 
of 
human 
character 
moving 
dynamically 
in 
all 
directions 
very 
rarely 
accommodates 
itself 
to 
adjustment 
through 
a 
simple 
alternative, 
as 
our 
antiquated 
moral 
philosophy 
would 
have 
it. 


And 
how 
about 
the 
value 
of 
the 
dream 
for 
a 
knowledge 
of 
the 
future? 
That, 
of 
course, 
we 
cannot 
consider. 
One 
feels 
inclined 
to 
substitute: 
"for 
a 
knowledge 
of 
the 
past." 
For 
the 
dream 
originates 
from 
the 
past 
in 
every 
sense. 
To 
be 
sure 
the 
ancient 
belief 
that 
the 
dream 
reveals 
the 
future 
is 
not 
entirely 
devoid 
of 



truth. 
By 
representing 
to 
us 
a 
wish 
as 
fulfilled 
the 
dream 
certainly 
leads 
us 
into 
the 
future; 
but 
this 
future, 
taken 
by 
the 
dreamer 
as 
present, 
has 
been 
formed 
into 
the 
likeness 
of 
that 
past 
by 
the 
indestructible 
wish.

PREFACE 


THE 
best 
preface 
to 
this 
journal 
written 
by 
a 
young 
girl 
belonging 
to 
the 
upper 
middle 
class 
is 
a 
letter 
by 
Sigmund 
Freud 
dated 
April 
27, 
1915, 
a 
letter 
wherein 
the 
distinguished 
Viennese 
psychologist 
testifies 
to 
the 
permanent 
value 
of 
the 
document: 


"This 
diary 
is 
a 
gem. 
Never 
before, 
I 
believe, 
has 
anything 
been 
written 
enabling 
us 
to 
see 
so 
clearly 
into 
the 
soul 
of 
a 
young 
girl, 
belonging 
to 
our 
social 
and 
cultural 
stratum, 
during 
the 
years 
of 
puberal 
development. 
We 
are 
shown 
how 
the 
sentiments 
pass 
from 
the 
simple 
egoism 
of 
childhood 
to 
attain 
maturity; 
how 
the 
relationships 
to 
parents 
and 
other 
members 
of 
the 
family 
first 
shape 
themselves, 
and 
how 
they 
gradually 
become 
more 
serious 
and 
more 
intimate; 
how 
friendships 
are 
formed 
and 
broken. 
We 
are 
shown 
the 
dawn 
of 
love, 
feeling 
out 
towards 
its 
first 
objects. 
Above 
all, 
we 
are 
shown 
how 
the 
mystery 
of 
the 
sexual 
life 
first 
presses 
itself 
vaguely 
on 
the 
attention, 
and 
then 
takes 
entire 
possession 
of 
the 
growing 
intelligence, 
so 
that 
the 
child 
suffers 
under 
the 
load 
of 
secret 
knowledge 
but 
gradually 
becomes 
enabled 
to 
shoulder 
the 
burden. 
Of 
all 
these 
things 
we 
have 
a 
description 
at 
once 
so 
charming, 
so 
serious, 
and 
so 
artless, 
that 
it 
cannot 
fail 
to 
be 
of 
supreme 
interest 
to 
educationists 
and 
psychologists. 


"It 
is 
certainly 
incumbent 
on 
you 
to 
publish 
the 
diary. 
All 
students 
of 
my 
own 
writings 
will 
be 
grateful 
to 
you." 


In 
preparing 
these 
pages 
for 
the 
press, 
the 
editor 
has 
toned 
down 
nothing, 
has 
added 
nothing, 
and 
has 
suppressed 
nothing. 
The 
only 
alterations 
she 
has 
made 
have 
been 
such 
as 
were 
essential 
to 
conceal 
the 
identity 
of 
the 
writer 
and 
of 
other 
persons 
mentioned 
in 
the 
document. 
Consequently, 
surnames, 
Christian 
names, 
and 
names 
of 
places, 
have 
been 
changed. 
These 
modifications 
have 
enabled 
the 
original 
author 
of 
the 
diary 
to 
allow 
me 
to 
place 
it 
at 
the 
free 
disposal 
of 
serious 
readers. 


No 
attempt 
has 
been 
made 
to 
correct 
trifling 
faults 
in 
grammar 
and 
other 
inelegancies 
of 
style. 
For 
the 
most 
part, 
these 
must 
not 
be 
regarded 
as 
the 
expression 
of 
a 
child's 
incapacity 
for 
the 
control 
of 
language. 
Rather 
must 
they 
be 
looked 
upon 
as 
manifestations 
of 
affective 
trends, 
as 
errors 
in 
functioning 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
Unconscious.

. 
. 
. 
Hella 
and 
I 
are 
writing 
a 
diary. 
We 
both 
agreed 
that 
when 
we 
went 
to 
the 
high 
school 
we 
would 
write 
a 
diary 
every 
day. 
Dora 
keeps 
a 
diary 
too, 
but 
she 
gets 
furious 
if 
I 
look 
at 
it. 
I 
call 
Helene 
"Hella," 
and 
she 
calls 
me 
"Rita;" 
Helene 
and 
Grete 
are 
so 
vulgar. 
Dora 
has 
taken 
to 
calling 
herself 
"Thea," 
but 
I 
go 
on 
calling 
her 
"Dora." 
She 
says 
that 
little 
children 
(she 
means 
me 
and 
Hella) 
ought 
not 
to 
keep 
a 
diary. 
She 
says 
they 
will 
write 
such 
a 
lot 
of 
nonsense. 
No 
more 
than 
in 
hers 
and 
Lizzi's. 


July 
13th. 
Really 
we 
were 
not 
to 
begin 
writing 
until 
after 
the 
holidays, 
but 
since 
we 
are 
both 
going 
away, 
we 
are 
beginning 
now. 
Then 
we 
shall 
know 
what 
we 
have 
been 
doing 
in 
the 
holidays. 


The 
day 
before 
yesterday 
we 
had 
an 
entrance 
examination, 
it 
was 
very 
easy, 
in 
dictation 
I 
made 
only 
1 
mistake--writing 
ihn 
without 
h. 
The 
mistress 
said 
that 
didn't 
matter, 
I 
had 
only 
made 
a 
slip. 
That 
is 
quite 
true, 
for 
I 
know 
well 
enough 
that 
ihn 
has 
an 
h 
in 
it. 
We 
were 
both 
dressed 
in 
white 
with 
rosecoloured 
ribbons, 
and 
everyone 
believed 
we 
were 
sisters 
or 
at 
least 
cousins. 
It 
would 
be 
very 
nice 
to 
have 
a 
cousin. 
But 
it's 
still 
nicer 
to 
have 
a 
friend, 
for 
we 
can 
tell 
one 
another 
everything. 


July 
14th. 
The 
mistress 
was 
very 
kind. 
Because 
of 
her 
Hella 
and 
I 
are 
really 
sorry 
that 
we 
are 
not 
going 
to 
a 
middle 
school. 
Then 
every 
day 
before 
lessons 
began 
we 
could 
have 
had 
a 
talk 
with 
her 
in 
the 
class-room. 
But 
we're 
awfully 
pleased 
because 
of 
the 
other 
girls. 
One 
is 
more 
important 
when 
one 
goes 
to 
the 
high 
school 
instead 
of 
only 
to 
the 
middle 
school. 
That 
is 
why 
the 
girls 
are 
in 
such 
a 
rage. 
"They 
are 
bursting 
with 
pride" 
(that's 
what 
my 
sister 
says 
of 
me 
and 
Hella, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
true). 
"Our 
two 
students" 
said 
the 
mistress 
when 
we 
came 
away. 
She 
told 
us 
to 
write 
to 
her 
from 
the 
country. 
I 
shall. 


July 
15th. 
Lizzi, 
Hella's 
sister, 
is 
not 
so 
horrid 
as 
Dora, 
she 
is 
always 
so 
nice! 
To-day 
she 
gave 
each 
of 
us 
at 
least 
ten 
chocolate-creams. 
It's 
true 
Hella 
often 
says 
to 
me: 
"You 
don't 
know 
her, 
what 
a 
beast 
she 
can 
be. 
Your 
sister 
is 
generally 
very 
nice 
to 
me." 
Certainly 
it 
is 
very 
funny 
the 
way 
in 
which 
she 
always 
speaks 
of 
us 
as 
"the 
little 
ones" 
or 
"the 
children," 
as 
if 
she 
had 
never 



been 
a 
child 
herself, 
and 
indeed 
a 
much 
littler 
one 
than 
we 
are. 
Besides 
we're 
just 
the 
same 
as 
she 
is 
now. 
She 
is 
in 
the 
fourth 
class 
and 
we 
are 
in 
the 
first. 


To-morrow 
we 
are 
going 
to 
Kaltenbach 
in 
Tyrol. 
I'm 
frightfully 
excited. 
Hella 
went 
away 
to-day 
to 
Hungary 
to 
her 
uncle 
and 
aunt 
with 
her 
mother 
and 
Lizzi. 
Her 
father 
is 
at 
manoeuvres. 


July 
19th. 
It's 
awfully 
hard 
to 
write 
every 
day 
in 
the 
holidays. 
Everything 
is 
so 
new 
and 
one 
has 
no 
time 
to 
write. 
We 
are 
living 
in 
a 
big 
house 
in 
the 
forest. 
Dora 
bagged 
the 
front 
veranda 
straight 
off 
for 
her 
own 
writing. 
At 
the 
back 
of 
the 
house 
there 
are 
such 
swarms 
of 
horrid 
little 
flies; 
everything 
is 
black 
with 
flies. 
I 
do 
hate 
flies 
and 
such 
things. 
I'm 
not 
going 
to 
put 
up 
with 
being 
driven 
out 
of 
the 
front 
veranda. 
I 
won't 
have 
it. 
Besides, 
Father 
said: 
"Don't 
quarrel, 
children!" 
(Children 
to 
her 
too! 
!) 
He's 
quite 
right. 
She 
puts 
on 
such 
airs 
because 
she'll 
be 
fourteen 
in 
October. 
"The 
verandas 
are 
common 
property," 
said 
Father. 
Father's 
always 
so 
just. 
He 
never 
lets 
Dora 
lord 
it 
over 
me, 
but 
Mother 
often 
makes 
a 
favourite 
of 
Dora. 
I'm 
writing 
to 
Hella 
to-day. 
She's 
not 
written 
to 
me 
yet. 


July 
21st. 
Hella 
has 
written 
to 
me, 
4 
pages, 
and 
such 
a 
jolly 
letter. 
I 
don't 
know 
what 
I 
should 
do 
without 
her! 
Perhaps 
she 
will 
come 
here 
in 
August 
or 
perhaps 
I 
shall 
go 
to 
stay 
with 
her. 
I 
think 
I 
would 
rather 
go 
to 
stay 
with 
her. 
I 
like 
paying 
long 
visits. 
Father 
said: 
"We'll 
see," 
and 
that 
means 
he'll 
let 
me 
go. 
When 
Father 
and 
Mother 
say 
We'll 
see 
it 
really 
means 
Yes; 
but 
they 
won't 
say 
"yes" 
so 
that 
if 
it 
does 
not 
come 
off 
one 
can't 
say 
that 
they 
haven't 
kept 
their 
word. 
Father 
really 
lets 
me 
do 
anything 
I 
like, 
but 
not 
Mother. 
Still, 
if 
I 
practice 
my 
piano 
regularly 
perhaps 
she'll 
let 
me 
go. 
I 
must 
go 
for 
a 
walk. 


July 
22nd. 
Hella 
wrote 
that 
I 
positively 
must 
write 
every 
day, 
for 
one 
must 
keep 
a 
promise 
and 
we 
swore 
to 
write 
every 
day. 
I. 
. 
. 
. 


July 
23rd. 
It's 
awful. 
One 
has 
no 
time. 
Yesterday 
when 
I 
wanted 
to 
write 
the 
room 
had 
to 
be 
cleaned 
and 
D. 
was 
in 
the 
arbour. 
Before 
that 
I 
had 
not 
written 
a 
single 
word 
and 
in 
the 
front 
veranda 
all 
my 
pages 
blew 
away. 
We 
write 
on 
loose 
pages. 
Hella 
thinks 
it's 
better 
because 
then 
one 
does 
not 
have 
to 
tear 
anything 
out. 
But 
we 
have 
promised 
one 
another 
to 
throw 
nothing 
away 
and 
not 
to 
tear 
anything 
up. 
Why 
should 
we? 
One 
can 
tell 
a 
friend 
everything. 
A 
pretty 
friend 
if 
one 
couldn't. 
Yesterday 
when 
I 
wanted 
to 
go 



into 
the 
arbour 
Dora 
glared 
at 
me 
savagely, 
saying 
What 
do 
you 
want? 
As 
if 
the 
arbour 
belonged 
to 
her, 
just 
as 
she 
wanted 
to 
bag 
the 
front 
veranda 
all 
for 
herself. 
She's 
too 
sickening. 


Yesterday 
afternoon 
we 
were 
on 
the 
Kolber-Kogel. 
It 
was 
lovely. 
Father 
was 
awfully 
jolly 
and 
we 
pelted 
one 
another 
with 
pine-cones. 
It 
was 
jolly. 
I 
threw 
one 
at 
Dora 
and 
it 
hit 
her 
on 
her 
padded 
bust. 
She 
let 
out 
such 
a 
yell 
and 
I 
said 
out 
loud 
You 
couldn't 
feel 
it 
there. 
As 
she 
went 
by 
she 
said 
Pig! 
It 
doesn't 
matter, 
for 
I 
know 
she 
understood 
me 
and 
that 
what 
I 
said 
was 
true. 
I 
should 
like 
to 
know 
what 
she 
writes 
about 
every 
day 
to 
Erika 
and 
what 
she 
writes 
in 
her 
diary. 
Mother 
was 
out 
of 
sorts 
and 
stayed 
at 
home. 


July 
24th. 
To-day 
is 
Sunday. 
I 
do 
love 
Sundays. 
Father 
says: 
You 
children 
have 
Sundays 
every 
day. 
That's 
quite 
true 
in 
the 
holidays, 
but 
not 
at 
other 
times. 
The 
peasants 
and 
their 
wives 
and 
children 
are 
all 
very 
gay, 
wearing 
Tyrolese 
dresses, 
just 
like 
those 
I 
have 
seen 
in 
the 
theatre. 
We 
are 
wearing 
our 
white 
dresses 
to-day, 
and 
I 
have 
made 
a 
great 
cherrystain 
upon 
mine, 
not 
on 
purpose, 
but 
because 
I 
sat 
down 
upon 
some 
fallen 
cherries. 
So 
this 
afternoon 
when 
we 
go 
out 
walking 
I 
must 
wear 
my 
pink 
dress. 
All 
the 
better, 
for 
I 
don't 
care 
to 
be 
dressed 
exactly 
the 
same 
as 
Dora. 
I 
don't 
see 
why 
everyone 
should 
know 
that 
we 
are 
sisters. 
Let 
people 
think 
we 
are 
cousins. 
She 
does 
not 
like 
it 
either; 
I 
wish 
I 
knew 
why. 


Oswald 
is 
coming 
in 
a 
week, 
and 
I 
am 
awfully 
pleased. 
He 
is 
older 
than 
Dora, 
but 
I 
can 
always 
get 
on 
with 
him. 
Hella 
writes 
that 
she 
finds 
it 
dull 
without 
me; 
so 
do 
I. 


July 
25th. 
I 
wrote 
to 
Fraulein 
Pruckl 
to-day. 
She 
is 
staying 
at 
Achensee. 
I 
should 
like 
to 
see 
her. 
Every 
afternoon 
we 
bathe 
and 
then 
go 
for 
a 
walk. 
But 
to-day 
it 
has 
been 
raining 
all 
day. 
Such 
a 
bore. 
I 
forgot 
to 
bring 
my 
paint-box 
and 
I'm 
not 
allowed 
to 
read 
all 
day. 
Mother 
says, 
if 
you 
gobble 
all 
your 
books 
up 
now 
you'll 
have 
nothing 
left 
to 
read. 
That's 
quite 
true, 
but 
I 
can't 
even 
go 
and 
swing. 


Afternoon. 
I 
must 
write 
some 
more. 
I've 
had 
a 
frightful 
row 
with 
Dora. 
She 
says 
I've 
been 
fiddling 
with 
her 
things. 
It's 
all 
because 
she's 
so 
untidy. 
As 
if 
her 
things 
could 
interest 
me. 
Yesterday 
she 
left 
her 
letter 
to 
Erika 
lying 
about 
on 
the 
table, 
and 
all 
I 
read 
was: 
He's 
as 
handsome 
as 
a 
Greek 
god. 
I 
don't 



know 
who 
"he" 
was 
for 
she 
came 
in 
at 
that 
moment. 
It's 
probably 
Krail 
Rudi, 
with 
whom 
she 
is 
everlastingly 
playing 
tennis 
and 
carries 
on 
like 
anything. 
As 
for 
handsome--well, 
there's 
no 
accounting 
for 
tastes. 


July 
26th. 
It's 
a 
good 
thing 
I 
brought 
my 
dolls' 
portmanteau. 
Mother 
said: 
You'll 
be 
glad 
to 
have 
it 
on 
rainy 
days. 
Of 
course 
I'm 
much 
too 
old 
to 
play 
with 
dolls, 
but 
even 
though 
I'm 
11 
I 
can 
make 
dolls' 
clothes 
still. 
One 
learns 
something 
while 
one 
is 
doing 
it, 
and 
when 
I've 
finished 
something 
I 
do 
enjoy 
it 
so. 
Mother 
cut 
me 
out 
some 
things 
and 
I 
was 
tacking 
them 
together. 
Then 
Dora 
came 
into 
the 
room 
and 
said 
Hullo, 
the 
child 
is 
sewing 
things 
for 
her 
dolls. 
What 
cheek, 
as 
if 
she 
had 
never 
played 
with 
dolls. 
Besides, 
I 
don't 
really 
play 
with 
dolls 
any 
longer. 
When 
she 
sat 
down 
beside 
me 
I 
sewed 
so 
vigorously 
that 
I 
made 
a 
great 
scratch 
on 
her 
hand, 
and 
said: 
Oh, 
I'm 
so 
sorry, 
but 
you 
came 
too 
close. 
I 
hope 
she'll 
know 
why 
I 
really 
did 
it. 
Of 
course 
she'll 
go 
and 
sneak 
to 
Mother. 
Let 
her. 
What 
right 
has 
she 
to 
call 
me 
child. 
She's 
got 
a 
fine 
red 
scratch 
anyhow, 
and 
on 
her 
right 
hand 
where 
everyone 
can 
see. 


July 
27th. 
There's 
such 
a 
lot 
of 
fruit 
here. 
I 
eat 
raspberries 
and 
gooseberries 
all 
day 
and 
Mother 
says 
that 
is 
why 
I 
have 
no 
appetite 
for 
dinner. 
But 
Dr. 
Klein 
always 
says 
Fruit 
is 
so 
wholesome. 
But 
why 
should 
it 
be 
unwholesome 
all 
at 
once? 
Hella 
always 
says 
that 
when 
one 
likes 
anything 
awfully 
much 
one 
is 
always 
scolded 
about 
it 
until 
one 
gets 
perfectly 
sick 
of 
it. 
Hella 
often 
gets 
in 
such 
a 
temper 
with 
her 
mother, 
and 
then 
her 
mother 
says: 
We 
make 
such 
sacrifices 
for 
our 
children 
and 
they 
reward 
us 
with 
ingratitude. 
I 
should 
like 
to 
know 
what 
sacrifices 
they 
make. 
I 
think 
it's 
the 
children 
who 
make 
the 
sacrifices. 
When 
I 
want 
to 
eat 
gooseberries 
and 
am 
not 
allowed 
to, 
the 
sacrifice 
is 
mine 
not 
Mother's. 
I've 
written 
all 
this 
to 
Hella. 
Fraulein 
Pruckl 
has 
written 
to 
me. 
The 
address 
on 
her 
letter 
to 
me 
was 
splendid, 
"Fraulein 
Grete 
Lainer, 
Lyzealschulerin." 
Of 
course 
Dora 
had 
to 
know 
better 
than 
anyone 
else, 
and 
said 
that 
in 
the 
higher 
classes 
from 
the 
fourth 
upwards 
(because 
she 
is 
in 
the 
fourth) 
they 
write 
"Lyzeistin." 
She 
said: 
"Anyhow, 
in 
the 
holidays, 
before 
a 
girl 
has 
attended 
the 
first 
class 
she's 
not 
a 
Lyzealschulerin 
at 
all." 
Then 
Father 
chipped 
in, 
saying 
that 
we 
(I 
didn't 
begin 
it) 
really 
must 
stop 
this 
eternal 
wrangling; 
he 
really 
could 
not 
stand 
it. 
He's 
quite 
right, 
but 
what 
he 
said 
won't 
do 
any 
good, 
for 
Dora 
will 
go 
on 
just 
the 
same. 
Fraulein 
Pruckl 
wrote 
that 
she 
was 
delighted 
that 
I 
had 
written. 
As 
soon 
as 
I 
have 
time 
she 
wants 
me 
to 
write 
to 
her 
again. 
Great 
Scott, 
I've 



always 
time 
for 
her. 
I 
shall 
write 
to 
her 
again 
this 
evening 
after 
supper, 
so 
as 
not 
to 
keep 
her 
waiting. 


July 
29th. 
I 
simply 
could 
not 
write 
yesterday. 
The 
Warths 
have 
arrived, 
and 
I 
had 
to 
spend 
the 
whole 
day 
with 
Erna 
and 
Liesel, 
although 
it 
rained 
all 
day. 
We 
had 
a 
ripping 
time. 
They 
know 
a 
lot 
of 
round 
games 
and 
we 
played 
for 
sweets. 
I 
won 
47, 
and 
I 
gave 
five 
of 
them 
to 
Dora. 
Robert 
is 
already 
more 
than 
a 
head 
taller 
than 
we 
are, 
I 
mean 
than 
Liesel 
and 
me; 
I 
think 
he 
is 
fifteen. 
He 
says 
Fraulein 
Grete 
and 
carried 
my 
cloak 
which 
Mother 
sent 
me 
because 
of 
the 
rain 
and 
he 
saw 
me 
home 
after 
supper. 


To-morrow 
is 
my 
birthday 
and 
everyone 
has 
been 
invited 
and 
Mother 
has 
made 
strawberry 
cream 
and 
waffles. 
How 
spiffing. 


July 
30th. 
To-day 
is 
my 
birthday. 
Father 
gave 
me 
a 
splendid 
parasol 
with 
a 
flowered 
border 
and 
painting 
materials 
and 
Mother 
gave 
me 
a 
huge 
postcard 
album 
for 
800 
cards 
and 
stories 
for 
school 
girls, 
and 
Dora 
gave 
me 
a 
beautiful 
box 
of 
notepaper 
and 
Mother 
had 
made 
a 
chocolate-cream 
cake 
for 
dinner 
today 
as 
well 
as 
the 
strawberry 
cream. 
The 
first 
thing 
in 
the 
morning 
the 
Warths 
sent 
me 
three 
birthday 
cards. 
And 
Robert 
had 
written 
on 
his: 
With 
deepest 
respect 
your 
faithful 
R. 
It 
is 
glorious 
to 
have 
a 
birthday, 
everyone 
is 
so 
kind, 
even 
Dora. 
Oswald 
sent 
me 
a 
wooden 
paper-knife, 
the 
handle 
is 
a 
dragon 
and 
the 
blade 
shoots 
out 
of 
its 
mouth 
instead 
of 
flame; 
or 
perhaps 
the 
blade 
is 
its 
tongue, 
one 
can't 
be 
quite 
sure. 
It 
has 
not 
rained 
yet 
on 
my 
birthday. 
Father 
says 
I 
was 
born 
under 
a 
lucky 
star. 
That 
suits 
me 
all 
right, 
tip 
top. 


July 
31st. 
Yesterday 
was 
heavenly. 
We 
laughed 
till 
our 
sides 
ached 
over 
Consequences. 
I 
was 
always 
being 
coupled 
with 
Robert 
and 
oh 
the 
things 
we 
did 
together, 
not 
really 
of 
course 
but 
only 
in 
writing: 
kissed, 
hugged, 
lost 
in 
the 
forest, 
bathed 
together; 
but 
I 
say, 
I 
wouldn't 
do 
that! 
quarrelled. 
That 
won't 
happen, 
it's 
quite 
impossible! 
Then 
we 
drank 
my 
health 
clinking 
glasses 
five 
times 
and 
Robert 
wanted 
to 
drink 
it 
in 
wine 
but 
Dora 
said 
that 
would 
never 
do! 
The 
real 
trouble 
was 
this. 
She 
always 
gets 
furious 
if 
she 
has 
to 
play 
second 
fiddle 
to 
me 
and 
yesterday 
I 
was 
certainly 
first 
fiddle. 


Now 
I 
must 
write 
a 
word 
about 
to-day. 
We've 
had 
a 
splendid 
time. 
We 
were 
in 
Tiefengraben 
with 
the 
Warths 
where 
there 
are 
such 
a 
lot 
of 
wild 



strawberries. 
Robert 
picked 
all 
the 
best 
of 
them 
for 
me, 
to 
the 
great 
annoyance 
of 
Dora 
who 
had 
to 
pick 
them 
for 
herself. 
Really 
I 
would 
rather 
pick 
them 
for 
myself, 
but 
when 
some 
one 
else 
picks 
them 
for 
one 
for 
love 
(that's 
what 
Robert 
said) 
then 
one 
is 
quite 
glad 
to 
have 
them 
picked 
for 
one. 
Besides, 
I 
did 
pick 
some 
myself 
and 
gave 
most 
of 
them 
to 
Father 
and 
some 
to 
Mother. 
At 
afternoon 
tea 
which 
we 
had 
in 
Flischberg 
I 
had 
to 
sit 
beside 
Erna 
instead 
of 
Robert. 
Erna 
is 
rather 
dull. 
Mother 
says 
she 
is 
anemic; 
that 
sounds 
frightfully 
interesting, 
but 
I 
don't 
quite 
know 
what 
it 
means. 
Dora 
is 
always 
saying 
that 
she 
is 
anemic, 
but 
of 
course 
that 
is 
not 
true. 
And 
Father 
always 
says 
"Don't 
talk 
such 
stuff, 
you're 
as 
fit 
as 
a 
fiddle." 
That 
puts 
her 
in 
such 
a 
wax. 
Last 
year 
Lizzi 
was 
really 
anemic, 
so 
the 
doctor 
said, 
she 
was 
always 
having 
palpitation 
and 
had 
to 
take 
iron 
and 
drink 
Burgundy. 
I 
think 
that's 
where 
Dora 
got 
the 
idea. 


August 
1st. 
Hella 
is 
rather 
cross 
with 
me 
because 
I 
wrote 
and 
told 
her 
that 
I 
had 
spent 
the 
whole 
day 
with 
the 
W's. 
Still, 
she 
is 
really 
my 
only 
friend 
or 
I 
should 
not 
have 
written 
and 
told 
her. 
Every 
year 
in 
the 
country 
she 
has 
another 
friend 
too, 
but 
that 
doesn't 
put 
me 
out. 
I 
can't 
understand 
why 
she 
doesn't 
like 
Robert; 
she 
doesn't 
know 
anything 
about 
him 
except 
what 
I 
have 
written 
and 
certainly 
that 
was 
nothing 
but 
good. 
Of 
course 
she 
does 
know 
him 
for 
he 
is 
a 
cousin 
of 
the 
Sernigs 
and 
she 
met 
him 
once 
there. 
But 
one 
does 
not 
get 
to 
know 
a 
person 
from 
seeing 
them 
once. 
Anyhow 
she 
does 
not 
know 
him 
the 
way 
I 
do. 
Yesterday 
I 
was 
with 
the 
Warths 
all 
day. 
We 
played 
Place 
for 
the 
King 
and 
Robert 
caught 
me 
and 
I 
had 
to 
give 
him 
a 
kiss. 
And 
Erna 
said, 
that 
doesn't 
count, 
for 
I 
had 
let 
myself 
be 
caught. 
But 
Robert 
got 
savage 
and 
said: 
Erna 
is 
a 
perfect 
nuisance, 
she 
spoils 
everyone's 
pleasure. 
He's 
quite 
right, 
but 
there's 
some 
one 
else 
just 
as 
bad. 
But 
I 
do 
hope 
Erna 
has 
not 
told 
Dora 
about 
the 
kiss. 
If 
she 
has 
everyone 
will 
know 
and 
I 
shouldn't 
like 
that. 
I 
lay 
in 
wait 
for 
Erna 
with 
the 
sweets 
which 
Aunt 
Dora 
sent 
us. 
Robert 
and 
Liesel 
and 
I 
ate 
the 
rest. 
They 
were 
so 
good 
and 
nearly 
all 
large 
ones. 
At 
first 
Robert 
wanted 
to 
take 
quite 
a 
little 
one, 
but 
I 
said 
he 
must 
only 
have 
a 
big 
one. 
After 
that 
he 
always 
picked 
out 
the 
big 
ones. 
When 
I 
came 
home 
in 
the 
evening 
with 
the 
empty 
box 
Father 
laughed 
and 
said: 
There's 
nothing 
mean 
about 
our 
Gretel. 
Besides, 
Mother 
still 
has 
a 
great 
box 
full; 
I 
have 
no 
idea 
whether 
Dora 
still 
has 
a 
lot, 
but 
I 
expect 
so. 


August 
2nd. 
Oswald 
arrived 
this 
afternoon 
at 
5. 
He's 
a 
great 
swell 
now; 
he's 



begun 
to 
grow 
a 
moustache. 
In 
the 
evening 
Father 
took 
him 
to 
the 
hotel 
to 
introduce 
him 
to 
some 
friends. 
He 
said 
it 
would 
be 
an 
awful 
bore, 
but 
he 
will 
certainly 
make 
a 
good 
impression 
especially 
in 
his 
new 
tourist 
getup 
and 
leather 
breeches. 
Grandmama 
and 
Grandpapa 
sent 
love 
to 
all. 
I've 
never 
seen 
them. 
They 
have 
sent 
a 
lot 
of 
cakes 
and 
sweets 
and 
Oswald 
grumbled 
no 
end 
because 
he 
had 
to 
bring 
them. 
Oswald 
is 
always 
smoking 
cigarettes 
and 
Father 
said 
to 
him: 
Come 
along 
old 
chap, 
we'll 
go 
to 
the 
inn 
and 
have 
a 
drink 
on 
the 
strength 
of 
your 
good 
report. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
rather 
funny; 
no 
one 
wants 
to 
drink 
anything 
when 
Dora 
and 
I 
have 
a 
good 
report, 
at 
most 
they 
give 
us 
a 
present. 
Oswald 
has 
only 
Twos 
and 
Threes 
and 
very 
few 
Ones 
and 
in 
Greek 
nothing 
but 
Satis-factory, 
but 
I 
have 
nothing 
but 
Ones. 
He 
said 
something 
to 
Father 
in 
Latin 
and 
Father 
laughed 
heartily 
and 
said 
something 
I 
could 
not 
understand. 
I 
don't 
think 
it 
was 
Latin, 
but 
it 
may 
have 
been 
Magyar 
or 
English. 
Father 
knows 
nearly 
all 
languages, 
even 
Czech, 
but 
thank 
goodness 
he 
doesn't 
talk 
them 
unless 
he 
wants 
to 
tease 
us. 
Like 
that 
time 
at 
the 
station 
when 
Dora 
and 
I 
were 
so 
ashamed. 
Czech 
is 
horrid, 
Mother 
says 
so 
too. 
When 
Robert 
pretends 
to 
speak 
Czech 
it's 
screamingly 
funny. 


August 
3rd. 
I 
got 
a 
chill 
bathing 
the 
other 
day 
so 
now 
I 
am 
not 
allowed 
to 
bathe 
for 
a 
few 
days. 
Robert 
keeps 
me 
company. 
We 
are 
quite 
alone 
and 
he 
tells 
me 
all 
sorts 
of 
tales. 
He 
swings 
me 
so 
high 
that 
I 
positively 
yell. 
To-day 
he 
made 
me 
really 
angry, 
for 
he 
said: 
Oswald 
is 
a 
regular 
noodle. 
I 
said, 
that's 
not 
true, 
boys 
can 
never 
stand 
one 
another. 
Besides, 
it 
is 
not 
true 
that 
he 
lisps. 
Anyhow 
I 
like 
Oswald 
much 
better 
than 
Dora 
who 
always 
says 
"the 
children" 
when 
she 
is 
talking 
of 
me 
and 
of 
Hella 
and 
even 
of 
Robert. 
Then 
he 
said: 
Dora 
is 
just 
as 
big 
a 
goose 
as 
Erna. 
He's 
quite 
right 
there. 
Robert 
says 
he 
is 
never 
going 
to 
smoke, 
that 
it 
is 
so 
vulgar, 
that 
real 
gentlemen 
never 
smoke. 
But 
what 
about 
Father, 
I 
should 
like 
to 
know? 
He 
says, 
too, 
that 
he 
will 
never 
grow 
a 
beard 
but 
will 
shave 
every 
day 
and 
his 
wife 
will 
have 
to 
put 
everything 
straight 
to 
him. 
But 
a 
beard 
suits 
Father 
and 
I 
can't 
imagine 
him 
without 
a 
beard. 
I 
know 
I 
won't 
marry 
a 
man 
without 
a 
beard. 


August 
5th. 
We 
go 
to 
the 
tennis 
ground 
every 
day. 
When 
we 
set 
off 
yesterday, 
Robert 
and 
I 
and 
Liesel 
and 
Erna 
and 
Rene, 
Dora 
called 
after 
us: 
The 
bridal 
pair 
in 
spee. 
She 
had 
picked 
up 
the 
phrase 
from 
Oswald. 
I 
think 
it 
means 
in 
a 
hundred 
years. 
She 
can 
wait 
a 
hundred 
years 
if 
she 
likes, 
we 
shan't. 
Mother 
scolded 
her 
like 
anything 
and 
said 
she 
mustn't 
say 
such 
stupid 



things. 
A 
good 
job 
too; 
in 
spee, 
in 
spee. 
Now 
we 
always 
talk 
of 
her 
as 
Inspee, 
but 
no 
one 
knows 
who 
we 
mean. 


August 
6th. 
Hella 
can't 
come 
here, 
for 
she 
is 
going 
to 
Klausenburg 
with 
her 
mother 
to 
stay 
with 
her 
other 
uncle 
who 
is 
district 
judge 
there 
or 
whatever 
they 
call 
a 
district 
judge 
in 
Hungary. 
Whenever 
I 
think 
of 
a 
district 
judge 
I 
think 
of 
District 
Judge 
T., 
such 
a 
hideous 
man. 
What 
a 
nose 
and 
his 
wife 
is 
so 
lovely; 
but 
her 
parents 
forced 
her 
into 
the 
marriage. 
I 
would 
not 
let 
anyone 
force 
me 
into 
such 
a 
marriage, 
I 
would 
much 
sooner 
not 
marry 
at 
all, 
besides 
she's 
awfully 
unhappy. 


August 
7th. 
There 
has 
been 
such 
a 
fearful 
row 
about 
Dora. 
Oswald 
told 
Father 
that 
she 
flirted 
so 
at 
the 
tennis 
court 
and 
he 
could 
not 
stand 
it. 
Father 
was 
in 
a 
towering 
rage 
and 
now 
we 
mayn't 
play 
tennis 
any 
more. 
What 
upset 
her 
more 
than 
anything 
was 
that 
Father 
said 
in 
front 
of 
me: 
This 
little 
chit 
of 
14 
is 
already 
encouraging 
people 
to 
make 
love 
to 
her. 
Her 
eyes 
were 
quite 
red 
and 
swollen 
and 
she 
couldn't 
eat 
anything 
at 
supper 
because 
she 
had 
such 
a 
headache!! 
We 
know 
all 
about 
her 
headaches. 
But 
I 
really 
can't 
see 
why 
I 
shouldn't 
go 
and 
play 
tennis. 


August 
8th. 
Oswald 
says 
that 
it 
wasn't 
the 
student's 
fault 
at 
all 
but 
only 
Dora's. 
I 
can 
quite 
believe 
that 
when 
I 
think 
of 
that 
time 
on 
the 
Southern 
Railway. 
Still, 
they 
won't 
let 
me 
play 
tennis 
any 
more, 
though 
I 
begged 
and 
begged 
Mother 
to 
ask 
Father 
to 
let 
me. 
She 
said 
it 
would 
do 
no 
good 
for 
Father 
was 
very 
angry 
and 
I 
mustn't 
spend 
whole 
days 
with 
the 
Warths 
any 
more. 
Whole 
days! 
I 
should 
like 
to 
know 
when 
I 
was 
a 
whole 
day 
there. 
When 
I 
went 
there 
naturally 
I 
had 
to 
stay 
to 
dinner 
at 
least. 
What 
have 
I 
got 
to 
do 
with 
Dora's 
love 
affairs? 
It's 
really 
too 
absurd. 
But 
grown-ups 
are 
always 
like 
that. 
When 
one 
person 
has 
done 
anything 
the 
others 
have 
to 
pay 
for 
it 
too. 


August 
9th. 
Thank 
goodness, 
I 
can 
play 
tennis 
once 
more; 
I 
begged 
and 
begged 
until 
Father 
let 
me 
go. 
Dora 
declares 
that 
nothing 
will 
induce 
her 
to 
ask! 
That's 
the 
old 
story 
of 
the 
fox 
and 
the 
grapes. 
She 
has 
been 
playing 
the 
invalid 
lately, 
won't 
bathe, 
and 
stays 
at 
home 
when 
she 
can 
instead 
of 
going 
for 
walks. 
I 
should 
like 
to 
know 
what's 
the 
matter 
with 
her. 
What 
I 
can't 
make 
out 
is 
why 
Father 
lets 
her 
do 
it. 
As 
for 
Mother, 
she 
always 
spoils 
Dora; 
Dora 
is 
Mother's 
favourite, 
especially 
when 
Oswald 
is 
not 
on 
hand. 
I 
can 



understand 
her 
making 
a 
favourite 
of 
Oswald, 
but 
not 
of 
Dora. 
Father 
always 
says 
that 
parents 
have 
no 
favourites, 
but 
treat 
all 
their 
children 
alike. 
That's 
true 
enough 
as 
far 
as 
Father 
is 
concerned, 
although 
Dora 
declares 
that 
Father 
makes 
a 
favourite 
of 
me; 
but 
that's 
only 
her 
fancy. 
At 
Christmas 
and 
other 
times 
we 
always 
get 
the 
same 
sort 
of 
presents, 
and 
that's 
the 
real 
test. 
Rosa 
Plank 
always 
gets 
at 
least 
three 
times 
as 
much 
as 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
family, 
that's 
what 
it 
is 
to 
be 
a 
favourite. 


August 
12th. 
I 
can't 
write 
every 
day 
for 
I 
spend 
most 
of 
my 
time 
with 
the 
Warths. 
Oswald 
can't 
stand 
Robert, 
he 
says 
he 
is 
a 
cad 
and 
a 
greenhorn. 
What 
vulgar 
phrases. 
For 
three 
days 
I 
haven't 
spoken 
to 
Oswald 
except 
when 
I 
really 
had 
to. 
When 
I 
told 
Erna 
and 
Liesel 
about 
it, 
they 
said 
that 
brothers 
were 
always 
rude 
to 
their 
sisters. 
I 
said, 
I 
should 
like 
to 
know 
why. 
Besides, 
Robert 
is 
generally 
very 
nice 
to 
his 
sisters. 
They 
said, 
Yes 
before 
you, 
because 
he's 
on 
his 
best 
behaviour 
with 
you. 
Yesterday 
we 
laughed 
like 
anything 
when 
he 
told 
us 
what 
fun 
the 
boys 
make 
of 
their 
masters. 
That 
story 
about 
the 
cigarette 
ends 
was 
screamingly 
funny. 
They 
have 
a 
society 
called 
T. 
Au. 
M., 
that 
is 
in 
Latin 
Be 
Silent 
or 
Die 
in 
initial 
letters. 
No 
one 
may 
betray 
the 
society's 
secrets, 
and 
when 
they 
make 
a 
new 
member 
he 
has 
to 
strip 
off 
all 
his 
clothes 
and 
lie 
down 
naked 
and 
every 
one 
spits 
on 
his 
chest 
and 
rubs 
it 
and 
says: 
Be 
One 
of 
Us, 
but 
all 
in 
Latin. 
Then 
he 
has 
to 
go 
to 
the 
eldest 
and 
biggest 
who 
gives 
him 
two 
or 
three 
cuts 
with 
a 
cane 
and 
he 
has 
to 
swear 
that 
he 
will 
never 
betray 
anyone. 
Then 
everyone 
smokes 
a 
cigar 
and 
touches 
him 
with 
the 
lighted 
end 
on 
the 
arm 
or 
somewhere 
and 
says: 
Every 
act 
of 
treachery 
will 
burn 
you 
like 
that. 
And 
then 
the 
eldest, 
who 
has 
a 
special 
name 
which 
I 
can't 
remember, 
tattoos 
on 
him 
the 
word 
Taum, 
that 
is 
Be 
Silent 
or 
Die, 
and 
a 
heart 
with 
the 
name 
of 
a 
girl. 
Robert 
says 
that 
if 
he 
had 
known 
me 
sooner 
he 
would 
have 
chosen 
"Gretchen." 
I 
asked 
him 
what 
name 
he 
had 
tattooed 
on 
him, 
but 
he 
said 
he 
was 
not 
allowed 
to 
tell. 
I 
shall 
tell 
Oswald 
to 
look 
when 
they 
are 
bathing 
and 
to 
tell 
me. 
In 
this 
society 
they 
abuse 
the 
masters 
frightfully 
and 
the 
one 
who 
thinks 
of 
the 
best 
tricks 
to 
play 
on 
them 
is 
elected 
to 
the 
Rohon; 
to 
be 
a 
Rohon 
is 
a 
great 
distinction 
and 
the 
others 
must 
always 
carry 
out 
his 
orders. 
He 
said 
there 
was 
a 
lot 
more 
which 
he 
couldn't 
tell 
me 
because 
it's 
too 
tremendous. 
Then 
I 
had 
to 
swear 
that 
I 
would 
never 
tell 
anyone 
about 
the 
society 
and 
he 
wanted 
me 
to 
take 
the 
oath 
upon 
my 
knees, 
but 
I 
wouldn't 
do 
that 
and 
he 
nearly 
forced 
me 
to 
my 
knees. 
In 
the 
end 
I 
had 
to 
give 
him 
my 
hand 
on 
it 
and 
a 
kiss. 
I 
didn't 
mind 
giving 
him 
that, 



for 
a 
kiss 
is 
nothing, 
but 
nothing 
would 
induce 
me 
to 
kneel 
down. 
Still, 
I 
was 
in 
an 
awful 
fright, 
for 
we 
were 
quite 
alone 
in 
the 
garden 
and 
he 
took 
me 
by 
the 
throat 
and 
tried 
to 
force 
me 
to 
my 
knees. 
All 
that 
about 
the 
society 
he 
told 
me 
when 
we 
were 
quite 
alone 
for 
he 
said: 
I 
can't 
have 
your 
name 
tattooed 
on 
me 
because 
it's 
against 
our 
laws 
to 
have 
two 
names 
but 
now 
that 
you 
have 
sworn 
I 
can 
let 
you 
know 
what 
I 
really 
am 
and 
think 
in 
secret. 


I 
couldn't 
sleep 
all 
night 
for 
I 
kept 
on 
dreaming 
of 
the 
society, 
wondering 
whether 
there 
are 
such 
societies 
in 
the 
high 
school 
and 
whether 
Dora 
is 
in 
a 
society 
and 
has 
a 
name 
tattooed 
on 
her. 
But 
it 
would 
be 
horrible 
to 
have 
to 
strip 
naked 
before 
all 
one's 
schoolfellows. 
Perhaps 
in 
the 
societies 
of 
the 
high-school 
girls 
that 
part 
is 
left 
out. 
But 
I 
shouldn't 
like 
to 
say 
for 
sure 
whether 
I'd 
have 
Robert's 
name 
tattooed 
on 
me. 


August 
15th. 
Yesterday 
Robert 
told 
me 
that 
there 
are 
some 
schoolboy 
societies 
where 
they 
do 
very 
improper 
things, 
but 
that 
never 
happened 
in 
their 
society. 
But 
he 
didn't 
say 
what. 
I 
said, 
the 
stripping 
naked 
seems 
to 
me 
awful; 
but 
he 
said, 
Oh, 
that's 
nothing, 
that 
must 
happen 
if 
we're 
to 
trust 
one 
another, 
it's 
all 
right 
as 
long 
as 
there's 
nothing 
improper. 
I 
wish 
I 
knew 
what. 
I 
wish 
I 
knew 
whether 
Oswald 
knows 
about 
it, 
and 
whether 
he 
is 
in 
such 
a 
society 
or 
in 
a 
proper 
one 
and 
whether 
Father 
was 
in 
one. 
If 
I 
could 
only 
find 
out. 
But 
I 
can't 
ask, 
for 
if 
I 
did 
I 
should 
betray 
Robert. 
When 
he 
sees 
me 
he 
always 
presses 
my 
left 
wrist 
without 
letting 
anyone 
see. 
He 
said 
that 
is 
the 
warning 
to 
me 
to 
be 
silent. 
But 
he 
needn't 
do 
that 
really, 
for 
I 
never 
would 
betray 
him 
whatever 
happened. 
He 
said: 
The 
pain 
is 
to 
bind 
you 
to 
me. 
When 
he 
says 
that 
his 
eyes 
grow 
dark, 
quite 
black, 
although 
his 
eyes 
are 
really 
grey 
and 
they 
get 
very 
large. 
Especially 
in 
the 
evening 
when 
we 
say 
goodbye, 
it 
frightens 
me. 
I'm 
always 
dreaming 
of 
him. 


August 
18th. 
Yesterday 
evening 
we 
had 
illuminations 
in 
honour 
of 
the 
emperor's 
birthday. 
We 
didn't 
get 
home 
until 
half 
past 
twelve. 
At 
first 
we 
went 
to 
a 
concert 
in 
the 
park 
and 
to 
the 
illuminations. 
They 
fired 
salutes 
from 
the 
hills 
and 
there 
were 
beacons 
flaring 
on 
the 
hill-tops; 
it 
was 
rather 
creepy 
although 
it 
was 
wonderful. 
My 
teeth 
chattered 
once 
or 
twice, 
I 
don't 
know 
whether 
I 
was 
afraid 
something 
would 
happen 
or 
why 
it 
was. 
Then 
R. 
came 
and 
talked 
such 
a 
lot. 
He 
is 
set 
on 
going 
into 
the 
army. 
For 
that 
he 
needn't 
learn 
so 
much, 
and 
what 
he's 
learning 
now 
is 
of 
no 
use 
to 
him. 
He 
says 
that 



doesn't 
matter, 
that 
knowledge 
will 
give 
him 
a 
great 
pull. 
I 
don't 
think 
he 
looks 
stupid, 
though 
Oswald 
says 
so 
to 
make 
me 
angry. 
All 
at 
once 
we 
found 
ourselves 
quite 
away 
from 
the 
others 
and 
so 
we 
sat 
on 
a 
bench 
to 
wait 
for 
them. 
Then 
I 
asked 
R. 
once 
more 
about 
the 
other 
societies, 
the 
ones 
in 
which 
they 
do 
such 
improper 
things. 
But 
he 
wouldn't 
tell 
me 
for 
he 
said 
he 
would 
not 
rob 
me 
of 
my 
innocence. 
I 
thought 
that 
very 
stupid, 
and 
I 
said 
that 
perhaps 
he 
didn't 
know 
himself 
and 
it 
was 
all 
put 
on. 
All 
that 
happened, 
he 
said, 
was 
that 
anyone 
who 
joined 
the 
society 
was 
tickled 
until 
he 
couldn't 
stand 
it 
any 
longer. 
And 
once 
one 
of 
them 
got 
St. 
Vitus's 
dance, 
that 
is 
frightful 
convulsions 
and 
they 
were 
afraid 
that 
everything 
would 
come 
out. 
And 
since 
then 
in 
their 
society 
no 
more 
tickling 
had 
been 
allowed. 
Shall 
I 
tickle 
you 
a 
little? 
I 
don't 
understand 
you, 
I 
said, 
and 
anyhow 
you 
daren't. 


He 
gave 
a 
great 
laugh 
and 
suddenly 
he 
seized 
me 
and 
tickled 
me 
under 
the 
arm. 
It 
made 
me 
want 
to 
laugh 
frightfully, 
but 
I 
stifled 
it 
for 
there 
were 
still 
lots 
of 
people 
going 
by. 
So 
he 
gave 
that 
up 
and 
tickled 
my 
hand. 
I 
liked 
it 
at 
first, 
but 
then 
I 
got 
angry 
and 
dragged 
my 
hand 
away. 
Just 
then 
Inspee 
went 
by 
with 
two 
other 
girls 
and 
directly 
they 
had 
passed 
us 
we 
followed 
close 
behind 
as 
if 
we 
had 
been 
walking 
like 
that 
all 
the 
time. 
It 
saved 
me 
a 
wigging 
from 
Mother, 
for 
she 
always 
wants 
us 
all 
to 
keep 
together. 
As 
we 
went 
along 


R. 
said: 
Look 
out, 
Gretel, 
I'm 
going 
to 
tickle 
you 
some 
day 
until 
you 
scream.-
How 
absurd, 
I 
won't 
have 
it, 
it 
takes 
two 
to 
do 
that. 
By 
the 
way, 
in 
the 
raffle 
I 
won 
a 
vase 
with 
2 
turtledoves 
and 
a 
bag 
of 
sweets 
and 
R. 
won 
a 
knife, 
fork 
and 
spoon. 
That 
annoyed 
him 
frightfully. 
Inspee 
won 
a 
fountain 
pen, 
just 
what 
I 
want, 
and 
a 
mirror 
which 
makes 
one 
look 
a 
perfect 
fright. 
A 
good 
job 
too, 
for 
she 
fancies 
herself 
such 
a 
lot. 


August 
29th. 
O 
dear, 
such 
an 
awful 
thing 
has 
happened. 
I 
have 
lost 
pages 
30 
to 
34 
from 
my 
diary. 
I 
must 
have 
left 
them 
in 
the 
garden, 
or 
else 
on 
the 
Louisenhohe. 
It's 
positively 
fiendish. 
If 
anyone 
was 
to 
find 
them. 
And 
I 
don't 
know 
exactly 
what 
there 
was 
on 
those 
pages. 
I 
was 
born 
to 
ill 
luck. 
If 
I 
hadn't 
promised 
Hella 
to 
write 
my 
diary 
every 
day 
I 
should 
like 
to 
give 
up 
the 
whole 
thing. 
Fancy 
if 
Mother 
were 
to 
get 
hold 
of 
it, 
or 
even 
Father. 
And 
it's 
raining 
so 
fearfully 
to-day 
that 
I 
can't 
even 
go 
into 
the 
garden 
and 
still 
less 
on 
the 
Louisenhohe 
above 
all 
not 
alone. 
I 
must 
have 
lost 
it 
the 
day 
before 
yesterday, 
for 
I 
didn't 
write 
anything 
yesterday 
or 
the 
day 
before. 
It 
would 
be 
dreadful 
if 



anyone 
were 
to 
find 
it. 
I 
am 
so 
much 
upset 
that 
I 
couldn't 
eat 
anything 
at 
dinner, 
although 
we 
had 
my 
favourite 
chocolate 
cream 
cake. 
And 
I'm 
so 
unhappy 
for 
Father 
was 
quite 
anxious 
and 
Mother 
too 
and 
they 
both 
asked 
what 
was 
the 
matter 
with 
me 
and 
I 
nearly 
burst 
out 
crying 
before 
everyone. 
We 
had 
dinner 
in 
the 
hotel 
to-day 
because 
Resi 
had 
gone 
away 
for 
2 
days. 
But 
I 
couldn't 
cry 
in 
the 
room 
before 
Father 
and 
Mother 
for 
that 
would 
have 
given 
the 
show 
away. 
My 
only 
hope 
is 
that 
no 
one 
will 
recognise 
my 
writing, 
for 
Hella 
and 
I 
use 
upright 
writing 
for 
our 
diary, 
first 
of 
all 
so 
that 
no 
one 
may 
recognise 
our 
writing 
and 
secondly 
because 
upright 
writing 
doesn't 
use 
up 
so 
much 
paper 
as 
ordinary 
writing. 
I 
do 
hope 
it 
will 
be 
fine 
to-morrow 
so 
that 
I 
can 
hunt 
in 
the 
garden 
very 
early. 
I 
have 
been 
utterly 
in 
the 
dumps 
all 
day 
so 
that 
I 
didn't 
even 
get 
cross 
when 
Inspee 
said: 
"Have 
you 
been 
quarrelling 
with 
your 
future 
husband?" 


August 
30th. 
It's 
not 
in 
the 
garden. 
I 
begged 
Mother 
to 
let 
us 
go 
to 
Louisenhutte 
this 
afternoon. 
Mother 
was 
awfully 
nice 
and 
asked 
what 
I 
was 
so 
worried 
about, 
and 
whether 
anything 
had 
happened. 
Then 
I 
couldn't 
keep 
it 
in 
any 
longer 
and 
burst 
out 
crying. 
Mother 
said 
I 
must 
have 
lost 
something, 
and 
this 
gave 
me 
an 
awful 
fright. 
Mother 
thought 
it 
was 
Hella's 
letter, 
the 
one 
which 
came 
on 
Tuesday, 
so 
I 
said: 
No, 
much 
worse 
than 
that, 
my 
diary. 
Mother 
said: 
Oh 
well, 
that's 
not 
such 
a 
terrible 
loss, 
and 
will 
be 
of 
no 
interest 
to 
anyone. 
Oh 
yes, 
I 
said, 
for 
there 
are 
all 
sorts 
of 
things 
written 
in 
it 
about 
R. 
and 
his 
society. 
Look 
here, 
Gretel, 
said 
Mother, 
I 
don't 
like 
this 
way 
you 
talk 
about 
R.; 
I 
really 
don't 
like 
you 
to 
spend 
all 
your 
time 
with 
the 
Warths; 
they're 
really 
not 
our 
sort 
and 
R. 
is 
not 
a 
fit 
companion 
for 
you; 
now 
that 
you 
are 
going 
to 
the 
high 
school 
you 
are 
not 
a 
little 
girl 
any 
longer. 
Promise 
me 
that 
you'll 
not 
be 
eternally 
with 
the 
Warths.--All 
right, 
Mother, 
I 
will 
break 
it 
off 
gradually 
so 
that 
nobody 
will 
notice. 
She 
burst 
out 
laughing 
and 
kissed 
me 
on 
both 
cheeks 
and 
promised 
me 
to 
say 
nothing 
to 
Inspee 
about 
the 
diary 
for 
she 
needn't 
know 
everything. 
Mother 
is 
such 
a 
dear. 
Still 
3 
hours 
and 
perhaps 
the 
pages 
are 
still 
there. 


Evening. 
Thank 
goodness! 
In 
front 
of 
the 
shelter 
I 
found 
2 
pages 
all 
pulped 
by 
the 
rain 
and 
the 
writing 
all 
run 
and 
one 
page 
was 
in 
the 
footpath 
quite 
torn. 
Someone 
must 
have 
trodden 
on 
it 
with 
the 
heel 
of 
his 
boot 
and 
2 
pages 
had 
been 
rolled 
into 
a 
spill 
and 
partly 
burned. 
So 
no 
one 
had 
read 
anything. 
I 
am 
so 
happy. 
And 
at 
supper 
Father 
said: 
I 
say, 
why 
are 
your 
eyes 
shining 
with 



delight? 
Have 
you 
won 
the 
big 
prize 
in 
the 
lottery? 
and 
I 
pressed 
Mother's 
foot 
with 
mine 
to 
remind 
her 
not 
to 
give 
me 
away 
and 
Father 
laughed 
like 
anything 
and 
said: 
Seems 
to 
me 
there's 
a 
conspiracy 
against 
me 
in 
my 
own 
house. 
And 
I 
said 
in 
a 
great 
hurry: 
Luckily 
we're 
not 
in 
our 
own 
house 
but 
in 
a 
hotel, 
and 
everyone 
laughed 
and 
now 
thank 
goodness 
it's 
all 
over. 
Live 
and 
learn. 
I 
won't 
let 
that 
happen 
again. 


August 
31st. 
Really 
I'm 
not 
so 
much 
with 
the 
W's 
and 
with 
R. 
I 
think 
he's 
offended. 
This 
afternoon, 
when 
I 
went 
there 
to 
tea, 
he 
seized 
me 
by 
the 
wrist 
and 
said: 
Your 
father 
is 
right, 
you're 
a 
witch. 
"You 
need 
a 
castigation." 
How 
rude 
of 
him. 
Besides, 
I 
didn't 
know 
what 
castigation 
meant. 
I 
asked 
Father 
and 
he 
told 
me 
and 
asked 
where 
I 
had 
picked 
up 
the 
word. 
I 
said 
I 
had 
passed 
2 
gentlemen 
and 
had 
heard 
one 
of 
them 
use 
it. 
What 
I 
really 
thought 
was 
that 
castigation 
meant 
tickling. 
But 
it 
is 
really 
horrid 
to 
have 
no 
one 
to 
talk 
to. 
Most 
of 
the 
people 
have 
gone 
already 
and 
we 
have 
only 
a 
week 
longer. 
About 
that 
castigation 
business. 
I 
don't 
like 
fibbing 
to 
Father, 
but 
I 
really 
had 
to. 
I 
couldn't 
say 
that 
R. 
wanted 
to 
give 
me 
a 
castigation 
when 
I 
didn't 
know 
what 
it 
meant. 
Dora 
tells 
a 
lot 
more 
lies 
than 
I 
do 
and 
I 
always 
love 
catching 
her 
in 
a 
lie 
for 
her 
lies 
are 
so 
obvious. 
I'm 
never 
caught. 
It 
only 
happened 
once 
when 
Frau 
Oberst 
von 
Stary 
was 
there. 
Father 
noticed 
that 
time, 
for 
he 
said: 
You 
little 
rogue, 
you 
tarradiddler! 


September 
3rd. 
Such 
a 
horrid 
thing 
has 
happened. 
I 
shall 
never 
speak 
to 
R. 
again. 
Oswald 
is 
quite 
right 
in 
calling 
him 
a 
cad. 
If 
I 
had 
really 
fallen 
out 
of 
the 
swing 
I 
might 
have 
broken 
my 
leg 
4 
days 
before 
we 
have 
to 
start 
from 
home. 
I 
can't 
make 
out 
how 
it 
all 
happened. 
It 
was 
frightful 
cheek 
of 
him 
to 
tickle 
me 
as 
he 
did, 
and 
I 
gave 
him 
such 
a 
kick. 
I 
think 
it 
was 
on 
his 
nose 
or 
his 
mouth. 
Then 
he 
actually 
dared 
to 
say: 
After 
all 
I'm 
well 
paid 
out, 
for 
what 
can 
one 
expect 
when 
one 
keeps 
company 
with 
such 
young 
monkeys, 
with 
such 
babies. 
Fine 
talk 
from 
him 
when 
he's 
not 
14 
himself 
yet. 
It 
was 
all 
humbug 
about 
his 
being 
15 
and 
he 
seems 
to 
be 
one 
of 
the 
idlest 
boys 
in 
the 
school, 
never 
anything 
but 
Satisfactory 
in 
his 
reports, 
and 
he's 
not 
in 
the 
fifth 
yet, 
but 
only 
in 
the 
fourth. 
Anyhow, 
we've 
settled 
our 
accounts. 
Cheeky 
devil. 
I 
shall 
never 
tell 
anyone 
about 
it, 
it 
will 
be 
my 
first 
and 
I 
hope 
my 
last 
secret 
from 
Hella. 


September 
6th. 
We 
are 
going 
home 
to-morrow. 
The 
last 
few 
days 
have 
been 



awfully 
dull. 
I 
saw 
R. 
once 
or 
twice 
but 
I 
always 
looked 
the 
other 
way. 
Father 
asked 
what 
was 
wrong 
between 
me 
and 
the 
Warths 
and 
R., 
so 
that 
our 
great 
friendship 
had 
been 
broken 
off. 
Of 
course 
I 
had 
to 
fib, 
for 
it 
was 
absolutely 
impossible 
to 
tell 
the 
truth. 
I 
said 
that 
R. 
found 
fault 
with 
everything 
I 
did, 
my 
writing, 
my 
reading 
aloud. 
(That's 
quite 
true, 
he 
did 
that 
once) 
and 
Father 
said: 
Well, 
well, 
you'll 
make 
it 
up 
when 
you 
say 
goodbye 
to-morrow. 
Father 
makes 
a 
great 
mistake. 
I'll 
never 
speak 
a 
word 
to 
him 
again. 


For 
her 
birthday, 
although 
it's 
not 
come 
yet, 
Dora 
is 
to 
have 
a 
navy 
blue 
silk 
dustcloak. 
I 
don't 
think 
the 
colour 
suits 
her, 
and 
anyhow 
she's 
much 
too 
thin 
to 
wear 
a 
dustcloak. 


September 
14th. 
Hella 
came 
back 
the 
day 
before 
yesterday. 
She 
looks 
splendid 
and 
she 
says 
I 
do 
too. 
I'm 
so 
glad 
that 
she's 
back. 
After 
all 
I 
told 
her 
about 
R. 
She 
was 
very 
angry 
and 
said 
I 
ought 
to 
have 
given 
him 
2 
more; 
one 
for 
the 
tickling 
and 
one 
for 
the 
"baby" 
and 
one 
for 
the 
"young 
monkey." 
If 
we 
should 
happen 
to 
meet 
him, 
shan't 
we 
just 
glare 
at 
him. 


September 
17th. 
Inspee 
has 
really 
got 
the 
silk 
dustcloak 
but 
I 
think 
the 
tartan 
hood 
looks 
rather 
silly. 
Still, 
I 
didn't 
say 
so, 
but 
only 
that 
the 
cloak 
fitted 
beautifully. 
She 
has 
tried 
it 
on 
at 
least 
five 
times 
already. 
I 
don't 
know 
whether 
Father 
really 
wants 
to 
treat 
her 
as 
a 
grown-up 
lady 
or 
whether 
he 
is 
making 
fun 
of 
her. 
I 
believe 
he's 
only 
making 
fun. 
She 
doesn't 
really 
look 
like 
a 
grown-up 
lady. 
How 
could 
she 
when 
she's 
not 
14 
yet? 
Yesterday 
afternoon 
such 
a 
lot 
of 
girls 
were 
invited, 
and 
of 
course 
Hella 
was 
invited 
on 
my 
account 
and 
we 
had 
a 
grand 
talk. 
But 
most 
of 
them 
bragged 
frightfully 
about 
the 
country 
where 
they 
said 
they 
had 
been. 
We 
were 
9 
girls. 
But 
Hella 
is 
the 
only 
one 
I 
care 
about. 


September 
21st. 
School 
begins 
to-morrow. 
By 
the 
way, 
we 
have 
agreed 
to 
call 
it 
Liz 
[Lyzeum 
= 
High 
School] 
and 
not 
School. 
I'm 
frightfully 
curious. 


September 
22nd, 
19--. 
School 
began 
to-day. 
Hella 
came 
to 
fetch 
me 
and 
we 
went 
along 
together. 
Inspee 
peached 
on 
us 
to 
Mother, 
saying 
we 
ran 
on 
in 
front 
of 
her. 
We 
don't 
want 
her 
as 
governess. 
There 
are 
34 
of 
us 
in 
the 
class. 
Our 
teachers 
are 
a 
Frau 
Doktor, 
2 
mistresses, 
one 
professor, 
and 
I 
think 
a 
drawing 
mistress 
as 
well. 
The 
Frau 
Doktor 
teaches 
German 
and 
writing. 
She 
put 
us 
together 
on 
the 
3rd 
bench. 
Then 
she 
made 
a 
speech, 
then 
she 
told 
us 



what 
books 
to 
get, 
but 
we 
are 
not 
to 
buy 
them 
till 
Monday. 
We 
have 
3 
intervals, 
one 
long 
and 
2 
short. 
The 
long 
one 
is 
for 
games, 
the 
short 
ones 
to 
go 
out. 
I 
usen't 
to 
go 
out 
at 
the 
elementary 
school 
and 
now 
I 
don't 
need 
to. 
Mother 
always 
says 
that 
it's 
only 
a 
bad 
habit. 
Most 
of 
the 
girls 
went 
out, 
and 
even 
asked 
to 
leave 
the 
room 
during 
lesson 
time. 
To-day 
we 
hadn't 
any 
proper 
lessons. 
They 
are 
to 
begin 
to-morrow, 
but 
we 
don't 
know 
what. 
Then 
we 
came 
home. 


September 
23rd. 
To-day 
we 
had 
the 
mistress 
who 
teaches 
geography 
and 
history, 
she 
has 
no 
degree. 
Inspee 
says 
that 
she 
had 
her 
last 
year, 
but 
she 
could 
not 
stand 
her, 
she's 
so 
ugly. 
Father 
was 
angry 
and 
said 
to 
Inspee: 
You 
silly 
goose, 
don't 
fill 
her 
head 
with 
such 
stuff. 
Show 
what 
you 
are 
worth 
as 
elder 
sister. 
One 
can 
learn 
something 
from 
every 
mistress 
and 
every 
master 
if 
one 
likes. 
But 
I 
can't 
say, 
we're 
really 
fond 
of 
Fraulein 
Vischer 
and 
I 
don't 
much 
care 
for 
geography 
and 
history. 
Besides 
I'm 
not 
learning 
for 
her 
but 
for 
myself. 
Frau 
Dr. 
Mallburg 
is 
awfully 
nice 
and 
pretty. 
We 
shall 
always 
write 
Frau 
Dr. 
M. 
for 
short. 
When 
she 
laughs 
she 
has 
two 
dimples 
and 
a 
gold 
stopping. 
She 
is 
new 
at 
the 
school. 
I 
don't 
know 
if 
we 
are 
to 
have 
singing 
too. 
In 
French 
we 
have 
Madame 
Arnau, 
she 
is 
beautifully 
dressed, 
black 
lace. 
Hella 
has 
a 
lovely 
pen 
and 
pencil 
case; 
it's 
quite 
soft, 
we 
must 
have 
it 
soft 
so 
that 
it 
shan't 
make 
a 
row 
when 
it 
falls 
down 
during 
lesson 
time. 
I 
think 
it 
cost 
7 
crowns 
or 
1.70 
crowns, 
I 
don't 
know 
exactly. 
To-day 
lessons 
went 
on 
until 
12, 
first 
German, 
then 
arithmetic, 
then 
religion 
for 
Catholics, 
and 
then 
we 
came 
away. 
Hella 
waited 
for 
me, 
for 
the 
Herr 
Pastor 
did 
not 
come. 


September 
24th. 
We 
thought 
the 
book 
shops 
would 
be 
open 
to-day 
but 
we 
were 
wrong. 
Hella's 
mother 
said, 
that's 
what 
happens 
when 
the 
chicks 
think 
themselves 
wiser 
than 
the 
hens. 
In 
the 
afternoon 
Hella 
came 
to 
our 
house 
and 
Inspee 
had 
been 
invited 
by 
the 
Fs. 
I 
don't 
go 
there, 
for 
it's 
so 
dull, 
they 
play 
the 
piano 
all 
day. 
I 
have 
enough 
piano 
at 
my 
lessons. 
My 
music 
lessons 
will 
begin 
when 
the 
school 
time-table 
has 
been 
fixed 
up. 
Perhaps 
on 
October 
1st, 
then 
I 
must 
write 
to 
Frau 
B., 
she 
told 
me 
to 
write 
myself. 
She 
tells 
all 
her 
pupils 
to 
do 
that. 
I 
would 
rather 
have 
had 
Hella's 
music 
mistress. 
But 
she 
has 
no 
time 
to 
spare 
and 
I 
think 
she 
charges 
more. 
At 
least 
she 
wouldn't 
always 
be 
holding 
me 
up 
"Fraulein 
Dora" 
as 
a 
model. 
We 
are 
not 
all 
so 
musical 
as 
Fraulein 
Dora. 
In 
the 
evening 
Inspee 
was 
reading 
a 
great 
fat 
book 
until 
10 
or 
12 
o 
clock 
and 
she 
simply 
howled 
over 
it. 
She 
said 
she 
had 
not, 
but 
I 
heard 



her 
and 
she 
could 
hardly 
speak. 
She 
says 
she 
had 
a 
cold, 
liar. 


September 
25th. 
To-day 
they 
gave 
us 
the 
professors' 
time-table, 
but 
it 
won't 
work 
until 
the 
professors 
from 
the 
Gymnasium 
know 
exactly 
when 
they 
can 
come. 
Our 
Frau 
Doktor 
might 
be 
teaching 
in 
a 
Gymnasium, 
but 
since 
there 
is 
only 
one 
here 
she 
teaches 
in 
our 
school. 
To-morrow 
we 
are 
going 
to 
have 
a 
viva 
voce 
composition: 
Our 
Holidays. 
We 
may 
write 
8 
or 
10 
sentences 
at 
home 
before 
we 
come, 
but 
we 
must 
not 
look 
at 
what 
we 
have 
written 
in 
class. 
I've 
written 
mine 
already. 
But 
I've 
not 
said 
anything 
about 
Robert. 
He's 
not 
worth 
thinking 
about 
anyhow. 
I 
did 
not 
even 
tell 
Hella 
everything. 


September 
25th. 
We 
had 
the 
viva 
voce 
composition 
and 
Frau 
Doktor 
said, 
very 
good, 
what 
is 
your 
name? 
Grete 
Lainer 
I 
said 
and 
she 
said: 
And 
is 
that 
your 
chum 
next 
you? 
Now 
she 
must 
tell 
us 
how 
she 
spent 
her 
holidays. 
Hella 
did 
hers 
very 
well 
too 
and 
Frau 
Doktor 
said 
again, 
very 
good. 
Then 
the 
bell 
rang. 
In 
the 
long 
interval 
Frau 
Doktor 
played 
dodge 
with 
us. 
It 
was 
great 
fun. 
I 
was 
it 
six 
times. 
In 
the 
little 
intervals 
we 
were 
quite 
alone 
for 
the 
staff 
has 
such 
a 
lot 
to 
do 
drawing 
up 
the 
time-table. 
A 
pupil-teacher 
from 
the 
F. 
high 
school 
is 
in 
our 
class. 
She 
sits 
on 
the 
last 
bench 
for 
she 
is 
very 
tall. 
As 
tall 
as 
Frau 
Doktor. 


September 
26th. 
To-day 
we 
had 
Professor 
Riegel 
for 
the 
first 
time 
in 
natural 
history. 
He 
wears 
eye-glasses 
and 
never 
looks 
any 
of 
us 
in 
the 
face. 
And 
in 
French 
Madame 
A. 
said 
that 
my 
accent 
was 
the 
best. 
We've 
got 
an 
awful 
lot 
on 
and 
I 
don't 
know 
whether 
I 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
write 
every 
day. 
The 
younger 
girls 
say 
Professor 
Igel 
instead 
of 
Riegel 
and 
the 
Weinmann 
girl 
said 
Nikel. 


September 
30th. 
I've 
had 
simply 
no 
time 
to 
write. 
Hella 
hasn't 
written 
anything 
since 
the 
24th. 
But 
I 
must 
write 
to-day 
for 
I 
met 
Robert 
in 
Schottengasse. 
Good 
morning, 
Miss, 
you 
needn't 
be 
so 
stuck 
up, 
he 
said 
as 
he 
went 
by. 
And 
when 
I 
turned 
round 
he 
had 
already 
passed, 
or 
I 
would 
have 
given 
him 
a 
piece 
of 
my 
mind. 
I 
must 
go 
to 
supper 


October 
1st. 
I 
can't 
write, 
Oswald 
has 
come 
from 
S., 
he 
has 
sprained 
his 
ankle, 
but 
I'm 
not 
so 
sure 
because 
he 
can 
get 
about. 
He 
is 
awfully 
pale 
and 
doesn't 
say 
a 
word 
about 
the 
pain. 


October 
4th. 
To-day 
is 
a 
holiday, 
the 
emperor's 
birthday. 
Yesterday 
Resi 
told 



me 
something 
horrid. 
Oswald 
can't 
go 
back 
to 
S. 
He 
has 
been 
up 
to 
something, 
I 
wish 
I 
knew 
what, 
perhaps 
something 
in 
the 
closet. 
He 
always 
stays 
there 
such 
a 
long 
time, 
I 
noticed 
that 
when 
I 
was 
in 
the 
country. 
Or 
perhaps 
it 
may 
have 
been 
something 
in 
his 
society. 
Inspee 
pretends 
she 
knows 
what 
it 
is 
but 
of 
course 
it 
isn't 
true, 
for 
she 
doesn't 
know 
any 
more 
than 
I 
do. 
Father 
is 
furious 
and 
Mother's 
eyes 
are 
all 
red 
with 
crying. 
At 
dinner 
nobody 
says 
a 
word. 
If 
I 
could 
only 
find 
out 
what 
he's 
done. 
Father 
was 
shouting 
at 
him 
yesterday 
and 
both 
Dora 
and 
I 
heard 
what 
he 
said: 
You 
young 
scamp 
(then 
there 
was 
something 
we 
couldn't 
understand) 
and 
then 
he 
said, 
you 
attend 
to 
your 
school 
books 
and 
leave 
the 
girls 
and 
the 
married 
women 
alone 
you 
pitiful 
scoundrel. 
And 
Dora 
said. 
Ah, 
now 
I 
understand 
and 
I 
said: 
Please 
tell 
me, 
he 
is 
my 
brother 
as 
well 
as 
yours. 
But 
she 
said: 
"You 
wouldn't 
understand. 
It's 
not 
suitable 
for 
such 
young 
ears." 
Fancy 
that, 
it's 
suitable 
for 
her 
ears, 
but 
not 
mine 
though 
she's 
not 
quite 
three 
years 
older 
than 
I 
am, 
but 
because 
she 
no 
longer 
wears 
a 
short 
skirt 
she 
gives 
herself 
the 
airs 
of 
a 
grown-up 
lady. 
Such 
airs, 
and 
then 
she 
sneaks 
a 
great 
spoonful 
of 
jam 
so 
that 
her 
mouth 
is 
stuffed 
with 
it 
and 
she 
can't 
speak. 
Whenever 
I 
see 
her 
do 
this, 
I 
make 
a 
point 
of 
speaking 
to 
her 
so 
that 
she 
has 
to 
answer. 
She 
does 
get 
in 
such 
a 
wax. 


October 
9th. 
I 
know 
all 
about 
it 
now. 
. 
. 
That's 
how 
babies 
come. 
And 
that 
is 
what 
Robert 
really 
meant. 
Not 
for 
me, 
thank 
you, 
I 
simply 
won't 
marry. 
For 
if 
one 
marries 
one 
has 
to 
do 
it; 
it 
hurts 
frightfully 
and 
yet 
one 
has 
to. 
What 
a 
good 
thing 
that 
I 
know 
it 
in 
time. 
But 
I 
wish 
I 
knew 
exactly 
how, 
Hella 
says 
she 
doesn't 
know 
exactly 
herself. 
But 
perhaps 
her 
cousin 
who 
knows 
everything 
about 
it 
will 
tell 
her. 
It 
lasts 
nine 
months 
till 
the 
baby 
comes 
and 
then 
a 
lot 
of 
women 
die. 
It's 
horrible. 
Hella 
has 
known 
it 
for 
a 
long 
time 
but 
she 
didn't 
like 
to 
tell 
me. 
A 
girl 
told 
her 
last 
summer 
in 
the 
country. 
She 
wanted 
to 
talk 
about 
it 
to 
Lizzi 
her 
sister, 
really 
she 
only 
wanted 
to 
ask 
if 
it 
was 
all 
true 
and 
Lizzi 
ran 
off 
to 
her 
mother 
to 
tell 
her 
what 
Hella 
had 
said 
And 
her 
mother 
said; 
"These 
children 
are 
awful, 
a 
corrupt 
generation, 
don't 
you 
dare 
to 
repeat 
it 
to 
any 
other 
girl, 
to 
Grete 
Lainer, 
for 
instance," 
and 
she 
gave 
her 
a 
box 
on 
the 
ear. 
As 
if 
she 
could 
help 
it! 
That 
is 
why 
she 
didn't 
write 
to 
me 
for 
such 
a 
long 
time. 
Poor 
thing, 
poor 
thing, 
but 
now 
she 
can 
tell 
me 
all 
about 
it 
and 
we 
won't 
betray 
one 
another. 
And 
that 
deceitful 
cat 
Inspee 
has 
known 
all 
about 
it 
for 
ages 
and 
has 
never 
told 
me. 
But 
I 
don't 
understand 
why 
that 
time 
at 
the 
swing 
Robert 
said: 
You 
little 
fool, 
you 
wont 
get 
a 
baby 



simply 
from 
that. 
Perhaps 
Hella 
knows. 
When 
I 
go 
to 
the 
gymnastic 
lesson 
to-morrow 
I 
shall 
talk 
to 
her 
first 
and 
ask 
her 
about 
it. 
My 
goodness 
how 
curious 
I 
am 
to 
know. 


October 
10th. 
I'm 
in 
a 
great 
funk, 
I 
missed 
my 
gymnastic 
lesson 
yesterday. 
I 
was 
upstairs 
at 
Hella's 
and 
without 
meaning 
it 
I 
was 
so 
late 
I 
did 
not 
dare 
to 
go. 
And 
Hella 
said 
I 
had 
better 
stay 
with 
her 
that 
we 
would 
say 
that 
our 
sum 
was 
so 
difficult 
that 
we 
had 
not 
got 
it 
finished 
in 
time. 
Luckily 
we 
really 
had 
a 
sum 
to 
do. 
But 
I 
said 
nothing 
about 
it 
at 
home, 
for 
to-morrow 
Oswald 
is 
going 
to 
G. 
to 
Herr 
S's. 
I 
thought 
that 
I 
knew 
all 
about 
it 
but 
only 
now 
has 
Hella 
really 
told 
me 
everything. 
It's 
a 
horrible 
business 
this 
. 
. 
. 
I 
really 
can't 
write 
it. 
She 
says 
that 
of 
course 
Inspee 
has 
it 
already, 
had 
it 
when 
I 
wrote 
that 
Inspee 
wouldn't 
bathe, 
did 
not 
want 
to 
bathe; 
really 
she 
had 
it. 
Whatever 
happens 
one 
must 
always 
be 
anxious 
about 
it. 
Streams 
of 
blood 
says 
Hella. 
But 
then 
everything 
gets 
all 
bl 
. 
. 
. 
That's 
why 
in 
the 
country 
Inspee 
always 
switched 
off 
the 
light 
before 
she 
was 
quite 
undressed, 
so 
that 
I 
couldn't 
see. 
Ugh! 
Catch 
me 
looking! 
It 
begins 
at 
14 
and 
goes 
on 
for 
20 
years 
or 
more. 
Hella 
says 
that 
Berta 
Franke 
in 
our 
class 
knows 
all 
about 
it. 
In 
the 
arithmetic 
lesson 
she 
wrote 
a 
note: 
Do 
you 
know 
what 
being 
un 
. 
. 
. 
is? 
Hella 
wrote 
back, 
of 
course 
I've 
known 
it 
for 
a 
long 
time. 
Berta 
waited 
for 
her 
after 
class 
when 
the 
Catholics 
were 
having 
their 
religion 
lesson 
and 
they 
went 
home 
together. 
I 
remember 
quite 
well 
that 
I 
was 
very 
angry, 
for 
they're 
not 
chums. 
On 
Tuesday 
Berta 
came 
with 
us, 
for 
Hella 
had 
sent 
her 
a 
note 
in 
class 
saying 
that 
I 
knew 
everything 
and 
she 
needn't 
bother 
about 
me. 
Inspee 
suspects 
something, 
she's 
always 
spying 
about 
and 
sneering, 
perhaps 
she 
thinks 
that 
she's 
the 
only 
person 
who 
ought 
to 
know 
anything. 


October 
16th. 
To-morrow 
is 
Father's 
and 
Dora's 
birthday. 
Every 
year 
it 
annoys 
me 
that 
Dora 
should 
have 
her 
birthday 
on 
the 
same 
day 
as 
Father; 
What 
annoys 
me 
most 
of 
all 
is 
that 
she 
is 
so 
cocky 
about 
it, 
for, 
as 
Father 
always 
says, 
it's 
a 
mere 
chance. 
Besides, 
I 
don't 
think 
he 
really 
likes 
it. 
Everyone 
wants 
to 
have 
their 
own 
birthday 
on 
their 
own 
day, 
not 
to 
share 
it 
with 
someone 
else. 
And 
it's 
always 
nasty 
to 
be 
stuck 
up 
about 
a 
thing 
like 
that. 
Besides, 
it's 
not 
going 
to 
be 
a 
real 
birthday 
because 
of 
the 
row 
about 
Oswald. 
Father 
is 
still 
furious 
and 
had 
to 
stay 
away 
from 
the 
office 
for 
2 
days 
because 
he 
had 
to 
go 
to 
G. 
to 
see 
about 
Oswald 
going 
there. 



October 
17th. 
It 
was 
much 
jollier 
to-day 
than 
I 
had 
expected. 
All 
the 
Bruckners 
came, 
so 
of 
course 
there 
was 
not 
much 
said 
about 
Oswald 
only 
that 
he 
has 
sprained 
his 
ankle, 
(I 
know 
quite 
well 
now 
that 
that's 
not 
true) 
and 
that 
he 
is 
probably 
going 
to 
G. 
Colonel 
B. 
said: 
The 
best 
thing 
for 
a 
boy 
is 
to 
send 
him 
to 
a 
military 
academy, 
that 
keeps 
him 
in 
order. 
In 
the 
evening 
Oswald 
said: 
That 
was 
awful 
rot 
what 
Hella's 
father 
said, 
for 
you 
can 
be 
expelled 
from 
a 
military 
academy 
just 
as 
easily 
as 
from 
the 
Gymnasium. 
That's 
what 
happened 
to 
Edgar 
Groller. 
Oswald 
gave 
himself 
away 
and 
Dora 
promptly 
said: 
Ah, 
so 
you 
have 
been 
expelled, 
and 
we 
believed 
you 
had 
sprained 
your 
ankle. 
Then 
he 
got 
in 
an 
awful 
wax 
and 
said: 
O 
you 
wretched 
flappers, 
I've 
gone 
and 
blabbed 
it 
all 
now, 
and 
he 
went 
away 
slamming 
the 
door, 
for 
Mother 
wasn't 
there 


October 
19th. 
If 
we 
could 
only 
find 
out 
what 
Oswald 
really 
did. 
It 
must 
have 
been 
something 
with 
a 
girl. 
But 
we 
can't 
think 
what 
Father 
meant 
about 
a 
married 
woman. 
Perhaps 
a 
married 
woman 
complained 
of 
him 
to 
the 
head 
master 
or 
to 
the 
school 
committee 
and 
that's 
how 
it 
all 
came 
out. 
I 
feel 
awfully 
sorry 
for 
him, 
for 
I 
think 
how 
I 
should 
have 
felt 
myself 
if 
everything 
had 
come 
out 
about 
Robert 
and 
me. 
Of 
course 
I 
don't 
care 
now. 
But 
in 
the 
summer 
it 
would 
have 
been 
awful. 
Oswald 
hardly 
says 
a 
word, 
except 
that 
he 
has 
talks 
with 
Mother 
sometimes. 
He 
always 
pretends 
that 
he 
wants 
to 
read, 
but 
it's 
absurd, 
for 
with 
such 
a 
love 
trouble 
one 
can't 
really 
read. 
I 
have 
not 
told 
Berta 
Franke 
all 
about 
it, 
but 
only 
that 
my 
brother 
has 
had 
an 
unhappy 
love 
affair 
and 
that 
is 
why 
he 
is 
back 
in 
Vienna. 
Then 
she 
told 
us 
that 
this 
summer 
a 
cousin 
of 
hers 
shot 
himself 
because 
of 
her. 
They 
said 
in 
the 
newspapers 
that 
it 
was 
because 
of 
an 
actress, 
but 
really 
it 
was 
because 
of 
her. 
She 
is 
14 
already. 


October 
20th. 
We 
spend 
most 
of 
our 
time 
now 
with 
Berta 
Franke. 
She 
says 
she 
has 
had 
a 
tremendous 
lot 
of 
experience, 
but 
she 
can't 
tell 
us 
yet 
because 
we 
are 
not 
intimate 
enough. 
By 
and 
by 
she 
says. 
Perhaps 
she 
is 
afraid 
we 
shall 
give 
her 
away. 
She 
wants 
to 
marry 
when 
she 
is 
16 
at 
latest. 
That's 
in 
2 
years. 
Of 
course 
she 
won't 
have 
finished 
school 
by 
then, 
but 
she 
will 
have 
left 
the 
third 
class. 
She 
has 
three 
admirers, 
but 
she 
has 
not 
yet 
made 
up 
her 
mind 
which 
to 
choose. 
Hella 
says 
I 
mustn't 
believe 
all 
this, 
that 
the 
story 
about 
the 
three 
admirers 
at 
once 
is 
certainly 
a 
cram. 



October 
21st. 
Berta 
Franke 
says 
that 
when 
one 
is 
dark 
under 
the 
eyes 
one 
has 
it 
and 
that 
when 
one 
gets 
a 
baby 
then 
one 
doesn't 
have 
it 
any 
more 
until 
one 
gets 
another. 
She 
told 
us 
too 
how 
one 
gets 
it, 
but 
I 
didn't 
really 
believe 
what 
she 
said, 
for 
I 
thought 
she 
did 
not 
know 
herself 
exactly. 
Then 
she 
got 
very 
cross 
and 
said: 
"All 
right, 
I 
won't 
tell 
you 
any 
more. 
If 
I 
don't 
know 
myself." 
But 
I 
can't 
believe 
what 
she 
said 
about 
husband 
and 
wife. 
She 
said 
it 
must 
happen 
every 
night, 
for 
if 
not 
they 
don't 
have 
a 
baby; 
if 
they 
miss 
a 
single 
night 
they 
don't 
have 
a 
baby. 
That's 
why 
they 
have 
their 
beds 
so 
close 
together. 
People 
call 
them 
marriage 
beds!!! 
And 
it 
hurts 
so 
frightfully 
that 
one 
can 
hardly 
bear 
it. 
But 
one 
has 
to 
for 
a 
husband 
can 
make 
his 
wife 
do 
it. 
I 
should 
like 
to 
know 
how 
he 
can 
make 
her. 
But 
I 
didn't 
dare 
to 
ask 
for 
I 
was 
afraid 
she 
would 
think 
I 
was 
making 
fun 
of 
her. 
Men 
have 
it 
too, 
but 
very 
seldom. 
We 
see 
a 
lot 
of 
Berta 
Franke 
now, 
she 
is 
an 
awfully 
nice 
girl, 
perhaps 
Mother 
will 
let 
me 
invite 
her 
here 
next 
Sunday. 


October 
23rd. 
Father 
took 
Oswald 
away 
to-day. 
Mother 
cried 
such 
a 
lot. 
When 
Oswald 
was 
leaving 
I 
whispered 
to 
him: 
I 
know 
what's 
the 
matter 
with 
you. 
But 
he 
did 
not 
understand 
me 
for 
he 
said: 
Silly 
duffer. 
Perhaps 
he 
only 
said 
that 
because 
of 
Father 
who 
was 
looking 
on 
with 
a 
fearful 
scowl. 


October 
27th. 
Everything 
seems 
to 
have 
gone 
wrong. 
Yesterday 
I 
got 
unsatisfactory 
in 
history, 
and 
in 
arithmetic 
to-day 
I 
couldn't 
get 
a 
single 
sum 
right. 
I'm 
frightfully 
worried 
about 
missing 
that 
gymnastic 
lesson. 
It 
will 
be 
all 
right 
if 
Mother 
gives 
me 
the 
money 
to-morrow, 
for 
if 
she 
goes 
herself 
she 
will 
certainly 
find 
out 
about 
it. 


October 
28th. 
To-day 
the 
head 
mistress 
was 
present 
at 
our 
French 
lesson 
and 
said 
awfully 
nice 
things 
about 
me. 
She 
said 
I 
was 
good 
enough 
in 
French 
to 
be 
in 
the 
Third 
and 
then 
she 
asked 
me 
whether 
I 
was 
as 
good 
in 
the 
other 
subjects. 
I 
didn't 
want 
to 
say 
either 
Yes 
or 
No, 
and 
all 
the 
other 
girls 
said 
Yes, 
she's 
good 
at 
everything. 
The 
head 
patted 
me 
on 
the 
shoulder 
and 
said: 
I'm 
glad 
to 
hear 
that. 
When 
she 
had 
gone 
I 
cried 
like 
anything 
and 
Madame 
Arnau 
asked: 
Why, 
what's 
the 
matter? 
and 
the 
other 
girls 
said: 
In 
arithmetic 
she 
had 
Unsatisfactory 
but 
she 
can 
really 
do 
her 
sums 
awfully 
well. 
Then 
Madame 
said: 
"You'll 
soon 
wipe 
off 
that 
Unsatisfactory." 


October 
30th. 
To-day 
I 
had 
a 
frightful 
bother 
with 
Fraulein 
Vischer 
in 
the 
history 
lesson. 
Yesterday 
when 
I 
got 
into 
the 
tram 
with 
Mother 
there 
was 



Fraulein 
V. 
I 
looked 
the 
other 
way 
so 
that 
Mother 
shouldn't 
see 
her 
and 
so 
that 
she 
should 
not 
tell 
Mother 
about 
me. 
When 
she 
came 
in 
to-day 
she 
said: 
Lainer, 
do 
you 
know 
the 
rules? 
I 
knew 
directly 
what 
she 
meant 
and 
said 
"I 
did 
bow 
to 
you 
in 
the 
tram 
but 
you 
didn't 
see 
me." 
"That's 
a 
fine 
thing 
to 
do, 
first 
you 
do 
wrong 
and 
then 
try 
to 
excuse 
yourself 
by 
telling 
a 
lie. 
Sit 
down!" 
I 
felt 
awful 
for 
all 
the 
girls 
looked 
at 
me. 
In 
the 
11 
interval 
Berta 
Franke 
said 
to 
me: 
Don't 
worry, 
she's 
got 
her 
knife 
into 
you 
and 
will 
always 
find 
something 
to 
complain 
of. 
She 
must 
have 
spoken 
to 
Frau 
Doktor 
M., 
for 
in 
the 
German 
lesson 
the 
subject 
for 
viva 
voce 
composition 
was 
Good 
Manners. 
And 
all 
the 
girls 
looked 
at 
me 
again. 
She 
didn't 
say 
anything 
more. 
She's 
a 
perfect 
angel, 
my 
darling 
E. 
M., 
her 
name 
is 
Elisabeth; 
but 
she 
does 
not 
keep 
her 
name-day 
because 
she's 
a 
Protestant; 
that's 
an 
awful 
shame 
because 
November 
19th 
is 
coming 
soon. 


October 
31st. 
I've 
been 
so 
lucky. 
Nothing's 
come 
out 
about 
the 
gymnastic 
lesson 
though 
Mother 
was 
there 
herself. 
And 
in 
mental 
arithmetic 
to-day 
I 
got 
a 
One. 
Fraulein 
Steiner 
is 
awfully 
nice 
too 
and 
she 
said: 
Why, 
L. 
what 
was 
the 
matter 
with 
you 
in 
your 
sums 
the 
other 
day, 
for 
you're 
so 
good 
at 
arithmetic? 
I 
didn't 
know 
what 
to 
do 
so 
I 
said: 
Oh 
I 
had 
such 
a 
headache 
the 
other 
day. 
Then 
Berta 
Franke 
nearly 
burst 
out 
laughing, 
it 
was 
horrid 
of 
her; 
I 
don't 
think 
she's 
quite 
to 
be 
trusted; 
I 
think 
she's 
rather 
a 
sneak. 
When 
the 
lesson 
was 
over 
she 
said 
she 
had 
laughed 
because 
"headache" 
means 
something 
quite 
different. 


November 
1st. 
To-day 
we 
began 
to 
work 
at 
the 
tablecloth 
for 
Father's 
Christmas 
present. 
Of 
course 
Inspee 
bagged 
the 
right 
side 
because 
that's 
easier 
to 
work 
at 
and 
I 
had 
to 
take 
the 
left 
side 
and 
then 
one 
has 
the 
whole 
caboodle 
on 
one's 
hand. 
For 
Mother 
I'm 
making 
an 
embroidered 
leather 
book 
cover, 
embroidered 
with 
silk 
and 
with 
a 
painted 
design; 
I 
can 
do 
the 
painting 
part 
at 
school 
in 
Fraulein 
H.'s 
lesson, 
she's 
awfully 
nice 
too. 
But 
I 
like 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
best 
of 
all. 
I'm 
not 
going 
to 
invite 
Berta 
Franke 
because 
of 
the 
way 
she 
laughed 
yesterday, 
and 
besides 
Mother 
doesn't 
like 
having 
strange 
girls 
to 
the 
house. 
November 
2nd. 
I 
don't 
know 
all 
about 
things 
yet. 
Hella 
knows 
a 
lot 
more. 
We 
said 
we 
were 
going 
to 
go 
over 
our 
natural 
history 
lesson 
together 
and 
we 
went 
in 
to 
the 
drawing-room, 
and 
there 
she 
told 
me 
a 
lot 
more. 
Then 
Mali, 
our 
new 
servant, 
came 
in, 
and 
she 
told 
us 
something 
horrid. 
Resi 
is 
in 
a 
hospital 
because 
she's 
ill. 
Mali 
told 
us 
that 
all 
the 
Jews 
when 
they 
are 
quite 



little 
have 
to 
go 
through 
a 
very 
dangerous 
operation; 
it 
hurts 
frightfully 
and 
that's 
why 
they 
are 
so 
cruel. 
It's 
done 
so 
that 
they 
can 
have 
more 
children; 
but 
only 
little 
boys, 
not 
little 
girls. 
It's 
horrid, 
and 
I 
should 
not 
like 
to 
marry 
a 
Jew. 
Then 
we 
asked 
Mali 
whether 
it 
is 
true 
that 
it 
hurts 
so 
frightfully 
and 
she 
laughed 
and 
said: 
It 
can't 
be 
so 
bad 
as 
all 
that, 
for 
if 
it 
were 
you 
wouldn't 
find 
everyone 
doing 
it. 
Then 
Hella 
asked 
her: 
But 
have 
you 
done 
it 
already, 
you 
haven't 
got 
a 
husband? 
She 
said: 
Go 
on, 
Miss! 
One 
mustn't 
ask 
such 
questions 
it's 
not 
ladylike. 
We 
were 
in 
an 
awful 
funk, 
and 
begged 
her 
not 
to 
tell 
Mother. 
She 
promised 
not 
to. 


November 
5th. 
Everything 
has 
come 
out 
through 
that 
stupid 
waist 
band. 
Yesterday 
when 
I 
was 
tidying 
my 
drawers 
Mali 
came 
in 
to 
make 
the 
beds 
and 
saw 
my 
fringed 
waistband. 
"I 
say, 
she 
said, 
that 
is 
pretty!" 
You 
can 
have 
it 
if 
you 
like, 
I 
said, 
for 
I've 
given 
up 
wearing 
it. 
At 
dinner 
yesterday 
I 
noticed 
that 
Mother 
was 
looking 
at 
Mali 
and 
I 
blushed 
all 
over. 
After 
dinner 
Mother 
said, 
Gretel, 
did 
you 
give 
Mali 
that 
waistband? 
Yes, 
I 
said, 
she 
asked 
me 
for 
it. 
She 
came 
in 
at 
that 
moment 
to 
clear 
away 
and 
said: 
"No, 
I 
never 
asked 
for 
it, 
Fraulein 
Grete 
gave 
it 
to 
me 
herself." 
I 
don't 
know 
what 
happened 
after 
that, 
I'd 
gone 
back 
to 
my 
room 
when 
Mother 
came 
in 
and 
said: 
A 
fine 
lot 
of 
satisfaction 
one 
gets 
out 
of 
one's 
children. 
Mali 
has 
told 
me 
the 
sort 
of 
things 
you 
and 
Hella 
talk 
about. 
I 
ran 
straight 
off 
to 
the 
kitchen 
and 
said 
to 
Mali: 
How 
could 
you 
tell 
such 
tales 
of 
us? 
It 
was 
you 
who 
chipped 
in 
when 
we 
were 
talking. 
It 
was 
frightfully 
mean 
of 
you. 
In 
the 
evening 
she 
must 
needs 
go 
and 
complain 
of 
me 
to 
Father 
and 
he 
scolded 
me 
like 
anything 
and 
said: 
You're 
a 
fine 
lot, 
you 
children, 
I 
must 
say. 
You 
are 
not 
to 
see 
so 
much 
of 
Hella 
now, 
do 
you 
understand? 


November 
6th. 
A 
fine 
thing 
this, 
that 
I'm 
a 
silly 
fool 
now. 
When 
I 
gave 
Hella 
a 
nudge 
so 
that 
she 
should 
not 
go 
on 
talking 
before 
Mali, 
she 
laughed 
and 
said: 
What 
does 
it 
matter, 
Mali 
knows 
all 
about 
it, 
probably 
a 
great 
deal 
more 
than 
we 
do. 
It 
was 
only 
after 
that 
that 
Mali 
told 
us 
about 
the 
Jews. 
Now, 
if 
you 
please, 
I 
am 
a 
silly 
fool. 
All 
right, 
now 
that 
I 
know 
what 
I 
am, 
a 
silly 
fool. 
And 
that's 
what 
one's 
best 
friend 
calls 
one! 


November 
7th. 
Hella 
and 
I 
are 
very 
stand-offish. 
We 
walk 
together, 
but 
we 
only 
talk 
of 
everyday 
things, 
school 
and 
lessons, 
nothing 
else. 
We 
went 
skating 
to-day 
for 
the 
first 
time 
and 
we 
shall 
go 
whenever 
we 
have 
time, 



which 
is 
not 
very 
often. 
Mother 
is 
working 
at 
the 
table 
cloth. 
It's 
very 
hard 
work 
but 
she 
has 
not 
got 
as 
much 
to 
do 
as 
we 
have. 


November 
8th. 
There 
was 
such 
a 
lovely 
young 
lady 
skating 
to-day, 
and 
she 
skates 
so 
beautifully, 
inside 
and 
outside 
edge 
and 
figures 
of 
8. 
I 
skated 
along 
behind 
her. 
When 
she 
went 
to 
the 
cloak 
room 
there 
was 
such 
a 
lovely 
scent. 
I 
wonder 
if 
she 
is 
going 
to 
be 
married 
soon 
and 
whether 
she 
knows 
all 
about 
everything. 
She 
is 
so 
lovely 
and 
she 
pushes 
back 
the 
hair 
from 
her 
forehead 
so 
prettily. 
I 
wish 
I 
were 
as 
pretty 
as 
she 
is. 
But 
I 
am 
dark 
and 
she 
is 
fair. 
I 
wish 
I 
could 
find 
out 
her 
name 
and 
where 
she 
lives. 
I 
must 
go 
skating 
again 
to-morrow; 
do 
my 
lessons 
in 
the 
evening. 


November 
9th. 
I'm 
so 
upset; 
she 
didn't 
come 
to 
skate. 
I'm 
afraid 
she 
may 
be 
ill. 


November 
10th. 
She 
didn't 
come 
to-day 
either. 
I 
waited 
two 
hours, 
but 
it 
was 
no 
good. 


November 
11th. 
She 
came 
to-day, 
at 
last! 
Oh 
how 
pretty 
she 
is. 


November 
12th. 
She 
has 
spoken 
to 
me. 
I 
was 
standing 
near 
the 
entrance 
gate 
and 
suddenly 
I 
heard 
some 
one 
laughing 
behind 
me 
and 
I 
knew 
directly: 
That 
is 
she! 
So 
it 
was. 
She 
came 
up 
and 
said: 
Shall 
we 
skate 
together? 
Please, 
if 
I 
may, 
said 
I, 
and 
we 
went 
off 
together 
crossing 
arms. 
My 
heart 
was 
beating 
furiously, 
and 
I 
wanted 
to 
say 
something, 
but 
couldn't 
think 
of 
anything 
sensible 
to 
say. 
When 
we 
came 
back 
to 
the 
entrance 
a 
gentleman 
stood 
there 
and 
took 
off 
his 
hat 
and 
she 
bowed, 
and 
she 
said 
to 
me: 
Till 
next 
time. 
I 
said 
quickly: 
When? 
Tomorrow? 
Perhaps, 
she 
called 
back. 
. 
. 
. 
Only 
perhaps, 
perhaps, 
oh 
I 
wish 
it 
were 
to-morrow 
already. 


November 
13th. 
Inspee 
declares 
that 
her 
name 
is 
Anastasia 
Klastoschek. 
I'm 
sure 
it 
can't 
be 
true 
that 
she 
has 
such 
a 
name, 
she 
might 
be 
called 
Eugenie 
or 
Seraphine 
or 
Laura, 
but 
Anastasia, 
impossible. 
Why 
are 
there 
such 
horrid 
names? 
Fancy 
if 
she 
is 
really 
called 
that. 
Klastoschek, 
too, 
a 
Czech 
name, 
and 
she 
is 
supposed 
to 
come 
from 
Moravia 
and 
to 
be 
26 
already; 
26, 
absurd, 
she's 
18 
at 
most. 
I'm 
sure 
she's 
not 
so 
much 
as 
18. 
Dora 
says 
she 
lives 
in 
Phorusgasse, 
and 
that 
she 
doesn't 
think 
her 
particularly 
pretty. 
Of 
course 
that's 
rank 
jealousy; 
Dora 
thinks 
no 
one 
pretty 
except 
herself. 



November 
14th. 
I 
asked 
the 
woman 
at 
the 
pay 
box, 
her 
name 
really 
is 
Anastasia 
Klastoschek 
and 
she 
lives 
in 
the 
Phorusgasse; 
but 
the 
woman 
didn't 
know 
how 
old 
she 
is. 
She 
would 
not 
tell 
me 
at 
first 
but 
asked 
why 
I 
wanted 
to 
know 
and 
who 
had 
sent 
me 
to 
enquire. 
She 
wouldn't 
look 
into 
the 
book 
until 
I 
told 
her 
that 
it 
was 
only 
for 
myself 
that 
I 
wanted 
to 
know. 
Then 
she 
looked, 
for 
I 
knew 
the 
number 
of 
the 
cloak 
room 
locker: 
36, 
a 
lovely 
number, 
I 
like 
it 
so 
much. 
I 
don't 
really 
know 
why, 
but 
when 
I 
hear 
anyone 
say 
that 
number 
it 
sounds 
to 
me 
like 
a 
squirrel 
jumping 
about 
in 
the 
wood. 


November 
20th. 
It's 
really 
impossible 
to 
write 
every 
day. 
Mother 
is 
ill 
in 
bed 
and 
the 
doctor 
comes 
every 
day, 
but 
I 
don't 
really 
know 
what's 
the 
matter 
with 
her. 
I'm 
not 
sure 
whether 
the 
doctor 
knows 
exactly. 
When 
Mother 
is 
ill 
everything 
at 
home 
is 
so 
uncomfortable 
and 
she 
always 
says: 
Whatever 
you 
do 
don't 
get 
ill, 
for 
it's 
such 
a 
nuisance. 
But 
I 
don't 
mind 
being 
ill; 
indeed 
I 
rather 
like 
being 
ill, 
for 
then 
everyone's 
so 
nice, 
when 
Father 
comes 
home 
he 
comes 
and 
sits 
by 
my 
bed 
and 
even 
Dora 
is 
rather 
nice 
and 
does 
things 
for 
me; 
that 
is 
she 
has 
to. 
Besides, 
when 
she 
had 
diptheria 
two 
years 
ago 
I 
did 
everything 
I 
could 
for 
her, 
she 
nearly 
died, 
her 
temperature 
went 
up 
to 
107 
and 
Mother 
was 
sick 
with 
crying. 
Father 
never 
cries. 
It 
must 
look 
funny 
when 
a 
man 
cries. 
When 
there 
was 
all 
that 
row 
about 
Oswald 
he 
cried, 
I 
think 
Father 
had 
given 
him 
a 
box 
on 
the 
ear. 
He 
said 
he 
hadn't 
but 
I 
think 
he 
had; 
certainly 
he 
cried, 
though 
he 
said 
he 
didn't. 
After 
all, 
why 
shouldn't 
he 
for 
he's 
not 
really 
grown 
up 
yet. 
I 
cry 
myself 
when 
I 
get 
frightfully 
annoyed. 
Still 
I 
shouldn't 
cry 
for 
a 
box 
on 
the 
ear. 


November 
21st. 
In 
the 
religion 
lesson 
to-day 
Lisel 
Schrotter 
who 
is 
the 
Herr 
Catechist's 
favourite, 
no 
we've 
got 
to 
call 
him 
Herr 
Professor, 
as 
she 
is 
the 
Herr 
Professor's 
favourite, 
well 
she 
went 
to 
him 
with 
the 
Bible 
and 
asked 
him 
what 
with 
child 
meant. 
That's 
what 
they 
say 
of 
Mary 
in 
the 
Bible. 
The 
Schrotter 
girl 
does 
not 
know 
anything 
yet 
and 
the 
other 
girls 
egged 
her 
on 
till 
she 
went 
and 
asked. 
The 
Herr 
Professor 
got 
quite 
red 
and 
said: 
If 
you 
don't 
know 
yet 
it 
does 
not 
matter. 
We 
shall 
come 
to 
that 
later, 
we're 
still 
in 
the 
Old 
Testament. 
I 
was 
so 
glad 
that 
Hella 
does 
not 
sit 
next 
me 
in 
the 
religion 
lesson, 
because 
she's 
a 
Protestant; 
we 
should 
certainly 
have 
both 
burst 
out 
laughing. 
Some 
of 
the 
girls 
giggled 
frightfully 
and 
the 
Herr 
Professor 
said 
to 
Lisel: 
You're 
a 
good 
girl, 
don't 
bother 
about 
the 
others. 
But 
Lisel 
positively 
howled. 



I 
would 
not 
have 
asked, 
even 
if 
I 
hadn't 
really 
known. 
With 
child 
is 
a 
stupid 
word 
anyhow, 
it 
doesn't 
mean 
anything 
really; 
only 
if 
one 
knows. 


November 
22nd. 
When 
I 
was 
coming 
away 
from 
the 
religion 
lesson 
with 
Berta 
Franke 
the 
other 
day, 
of 
course 
we 
began 
talking 
about 
it. 
She 
says 
that's 
why 
people 
marry, 
only 
because 
of 
it. 
I 
said 
I 
could 
not 
believe 
that 
people 
marry 
only 
for 
that. 
Lots 
of 
people 
marry 
and 
then 
have 
no 
children. 
That's 
all 
right 
said 
Berta, 
but 
it's 
quite 
true 
what 
I 
tell 
you. 
Then 
she 
told 
me 
a 
lot 
more 
but 
I 
really 
can't 
write 
it 
all 
down. 
It 
is 
too 
horrid, 
but 
I 
shan't 
forget. 
When 
I 
was 
sitting 
on 
Mother's 
bed 
to-day 
I 
suddenly 
realised 
that 
Father's 
bed 
is 
really 
quite 
close 
to 
Mother's. 
I 
had 
never 
thought 
about 
it 
before. 
But 
it's 
not 
really 
necessary 
now 
for 
we 
are 
all 
quite 
big. 
Still 
I 
suppose 
they've 
just 
left 
things 
as 
they 
were. 
Well 
dear, 
said 
Mother, 
what 
are 
you 
looking 
round 
so 
for? 
Of 
course 
I 
didn't 
let 
on, 
but 
said: 
I 
was 
only 
looking 
round 
and 
thinking 
that 
if 
your 
bed 
was 
where 
the 
washstand 
is 
you 
could 
see 
to 
read 
better 
when 
you 
are 
lying 
in 
bed. 
That 
would 
not 
do 
because 
the 
wall's 
all 
wrong 
said 
Mother. 
I 
said 
nothing 
more 
and 
she 
didn't 
either. 
I 
like 
much 
better 
to 
sleep 
on 
a 
sofa 
than 
in 
a 
bed, 
because 
I 
like 
to 
snuggle 
up 
against 
the 
back. 
I'm 
so 
glad 
Mother 
didn't 
notice 
anything. 
One 
has 
to 
be 
so 
frightfully 
careful 
not 
to 
give 
oneself 
away 
when 
one 
knows 
everything. 


November 
25th. 
I 
have 
just 
been 
reading 
a 
lovely 
story; 
it 
is 
called 
A 
True 
Heart 
and 
is 
about 
a 
girl 
whose 
betrothed 
has 
had 
to 
leave 
her 
because 
he 
has 
shot 
a 
man 
who 
was 
spying 
on 
him. 
But 
Rosa 
remains 
true 
to 
him 
till 
he 
comes 
back 
after 
10 
years 
and 
then 
they 
marry. 
It's 
simply 
splendid 
and 
frightfully 
sad 
at 
first. 
I 
do 
love 
these 
library 
books, 
but 
when 
we 
were 
at 
the 
elementary 
school 
I 
knew 
all 
the 
books 
they 
had 
and 
the 
mistress 
never 
knew 
what 
to 
give 
me 
and 
Hella. 
In 
the 
high 
school 
we 
get 
only 
one 
book 
a 
month, 
for 
the 
Frau 
Doktor 
says 
we 
have 
plenty 
of 
work 
to 
do, 
and 
that 
when 
we 
are 
not 
at 
work 
we 
ought 
to 
be 
out 
in 
the 
fresh 
air. 
I 
can't 
manage 
to 
go 
skating 
every 
day. 
I 
do 
love 
the 
Gold 
Fairy, 
that 
is 
my 
name 
for 
her, 
for 
I 
hate 
her 
real 
name. 
Inspee 
declares 
that 
they 
call 
her 
Stasi 
for 
short, 
but 
I 
don't 
believe 
that; 
most 
likely 
they 
call 
her 
Anna, 
but 
that's 
so 
common. 
Thank 
goodness 
Hella 
always 
calls 
me 
Rita, 
so 
at 
school 
I'm 
known 
as 
Rita. 
It's 
only 
at 
home 
that 
they 
will 
call 
me 
Gretl. 
The 
other 
day 
I 
said 
to 
Inspee: 
If 
you 
want 
me 
to 
call 
you 
Thea 
you 
must 
call 
me 
Rita; 
and 
anyhow 
I 
won't 
let 
you 
call 
me 



Gretl, 
that's 
what 
they 
call 
a 
little 
girl 
or 
a 
peasant 
girl. 
She 
said: 
I 
don't 
care 
tuppence 
what 
you 
call 
me. 
All 
right, 
then, 
she 
shall 
be 
Dora 
till 
the 
end 
of 
time. 


November 
27th. 
Father 
has 
been 
made 
Appeal 
Court 
Judge. 
He 
is 
awfully 
glad 
and 
so 
is 
Mother. 
The 
news 
came 
yesterday 
evening. 
Now 
he 
can 
become 
President 
of 
the 
Supreme 
Court, 
not 
directly, 
but 
in 
a 
few 
years. 
We 
shall 
probably 
move 
to 
a 
larger 
house 
in 
May. 
Inspee 
said 
to 
Mother 
that 
she 
hoped 
she 
would 
have 
her 
own 
room 
where 
she 
would 
not 
be 
disturbed. 
How 
absurd, 
who 
disturbs 
her, 
I 
suppose 
I 
do? 
Much 
more 
like 
she 
disturbs 
me, 
always 
watching 
while 
I'm 
writing 
my 
diary. 
Hella 
always 
says: 
"There 
really 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
any 
elder 
sisters; 
she's 
jolly 
well 
right. 
It's 
a 
pity 
we 
can't 
alter 
things. 
Mother 
says 
we 
are 
really 
too 
big 
to 
keep 
St. 
Nicholas, 
but 
I 
don't 
see 
why 
one 
should 
ever 
be 
too 
big 
for 
that. 
Last 
year 
Inspee 
got 
something 
from 
St. 
Nicholas 
when 
she 
was 
13 
and 
I'm 
not 
12 
yet. 
All 
we 
get 
are 
chocolates 
and 
sweets 
and 
dates 
and 
that 
sort 
of 
thing, 
not 
proper 
presents. 
The 
girls 
want 
to 
give 
the 
Frau 
Doktor 
a 
great 
Krampus[1] 
to 
leave 
it 
on 
her 
desk. 
I 
think 
that's 
silly. 
It's 
not 
a 
proper 
present 
for 
a 
teacher 
one 
is 
really 
fond 
of, 
one 
doesn't 
want 
to 
waste 
sweets 
on 
a 
teacher 
one 
doesn't 
like, 
and 
to 
give 
an 
empty 
Krampus 
would 
be 
rude. 
Mother 
is 
really 
right 
and 
a 
Krampus 
is 
only 
suitable 
for 
children. 


[1] 
Krampus=Ruprechtsknecht, 
i.e. 
a 
little 
Demon, 
who 
serves 
St. 
Nicholas, 
and 
is 
a 
bogey 
man 
to 
carry 
off 
naughty 
children 
An 
image 
of 
this 
Demon 
filled 
with 
sweets, 
is 
given 
as 
a 
present 
on 
the 
feast 
of 
St. 
Nicholas 
which 
inaugurates 
the 
Christmas 
season.--Translators' 
Note. 
December 
1st. 
We 
are 
giving 
everyone 
of 
the 
staff 
a 
Krampus, 
each 
of 
us 
is 
to 
subscribe 
a 
crown, 
I 
hope 
Father 
will 
give 
me 
the 
crown 
extra. 
Perhaps 
he'll 
give 
us 
more 
pocket 
money 
now, 
at 
least 
another 
crown, 
that 
would 
be 
splendid. 
We 
are 
going 
to 
give 
big 
Krampuses 
to 
the 
ones 
we 
like 
best, 
and: 
small 
ones 
to 
those 
we 
are 
not 
so 
fond 
of. 
We're 
afraid 
to 
give 
one 
to 
Professor 
J. 
But 
if 
he 
doesn't 
get 
one 
perhaps 
he'll 
be 
offended. 


December 
2nd. 
To-day 
we 
went 
to 
buy 
Krampuses 
for 
the 
staff. 
The 
one 
for 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
is 
the 
finest. 
When 
you 
open 
it 
the 
first 
thing 
you 
see 
is 
little 
books 
with 
Schiller, 
Goethe, 
and 
Fairy 
Tales 
written 
on 
the 
backs, 
and 
then 
underneath 
these 
are 
the 
sweets. 
That's 
exactly 
suited 
for 
her, 
for 
the 
Frau 



Doktor 
teaches 
German 
and 
in 
the 
Fourth 
in 
German 
they 
are 
reading 
these 
poets. 
Last 
month 
in 
the 
Fourth 
they 
had 
a 
Schiller 
festival 
and 
Frau 
Doktor 
made 
a 
splendid 
speech 
and 
some 
of 
the 
girls 
gave 
recitations. 
Besides 
Hella 
has 
shown 
me 
an 
awful 
poem 
by 
Schiller. 
There 
you 
can 
read: 
if 
only 
I 
could 
catch 
her 
in 
the 
bath, 
she 
would 
cry 
for 
mercy, 
for 
I 
would 
soon 
show 
the 
girl 
that 
I 
am 
a 
man. 
And 
then 
in 
another 
place: 
"To 
my 
mate 
in 
God's 
likeness 
I 
can 
show 
that 
which 
is 
the 
source 
of 
life." 
But 
you 
can 
only 
find 
that 
in 
the 
large 
editions 
of 
Schiller. 
I 
believe 
we've 
got 
some 
books 
of 
that 
sort 
in 
our 
bookcase, 
for 
when 
Inspee 
was 
rummaging 
there 
the 
other 
day 
Mother 
called 
from 
the 
next 
room: 
"Dora, 
what 
are 
you 
hunting 
for 
in 
the 
bookcase? 
I 
can 
tell 
you 
where 
it 
is." 
And 
she 
said: 
Oh, 
it's 
nothing, 
I 
was 
just 
looking 
for 
something, 
and 
shut 
the 
door 
quickly. 


December 
4th. 
The 
girls 
are 
so 
tiresome 
and 
have 
made 
such 
a 
muddle 
about 
the 
Krampuses 
for 
the 
staff. 
The 
money 
didn't 
come 
out 
right 
and 
Keller 
said 
that 
Markus 
had 
taken 
some 
but 
Markus 
said 
not 
taken 
only 
kept. 
Of 
course 
Markus 
complained 
to 
Frau 
Doktor 
and 
her 
father 
went 
to 
the 
head 
and 
complained 
too. 
Frau 
Doktor 
said 
we 
know 
quite 
well 
that 
collections 
are 
not 
allowed 
and 
that 
we 
must 
not 
give 
any 
one 
a 
Krampus. 
Now 
Keller 
has 
the 
five 
Krampuses 
and 
we 
don't 
know 
what 
to 
do 
about 
it. 
Mother 
says 
that 
sort 
of 
thing 
never 
turns 
out 
well 
but 
always 
ends 
in 
a 
quarrel. 


December 
5th. 
We 
are 
in 
such 
a 
funk: 
Hella 
and 
I 
and 
Edith 
Bergler 
have 
taken 
the 
Krampus 
which 
we 
bought 
for 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
and 
put 
it 
on 
her 
doorstep. 
Edith 
Bergler 
knew 
where 
she 
lived 
for 
she 
comes 
by 
there 
every 
day 
on 
her 
way 
to 
school. 
I 
wonder 
if 
she'll 
guess 
where 
the 
Krampus 
comes 
from. 
I 
did 
not 
know 
that 
Edith 
Bergler 
was 
such 
a 
nice 
girl, 
I 
always 
thought 
she 
must 
be 
deceitful 
because 
she 
wears 
spectacles. 
But 
now 
I'm 
quite 
certain 
she 
is 
not 
deceitful, 
so 
one 
sees 
how 
easy 
it 
is 
to 
make 
a 
mistake. 
Tomorrow's 
our 
German 
lesson. 


December 
6th. 
Frau 
Doktor 
did 
not 
say 
anything 
at 
first. 
Then 
she 
gave 
out 
the 
subject 
for 
the 
essay: 
"Why 
once 
I 
could 
not 
go 
to 
sleep 
at 
night." 
The 
girls 
were 
all 
taken 
aback, 
and 
then 
Frau 
Doktor 
said: 
Now 
girls 
that's 
not 
so 
very 
difficult. 
One 
person 
cannot 
go 
to 
sleep 
because 
he's 
just 
going 
to 
be 
ill, 
another 
because 
he 
is 
excited 
by 
joy 
or 
fear. 
Another 
has 
an 
uneasy 
conscience 
because 
he 
has 
done 
something 
which 
he 
has 
been 
forbidden 
to 



do; 
have 
not 
all 
of 
you 
experienced 
something 
of 
the 
kind? 
Then 
she 
looked 
frightfully 
hard 
at 
Edith 
Bergler 
and 
us 
two. 
She 
did 
not 
say 
anything 
more, 
so 
we 
don't 
really 
know 
if 
she 
suspects. 
I 
couldn't 
go 
to 
the 
ice 
carnival 
yesterday 
because 
I 
had 
such 
a 
bad 
cough, 
and 
Dora 
couldn't 
go 
either 
because 
she 
had 
a 
headache; 
I 
don't 
know 
whether 
it 
was 
a 
real 
headache 
or 
that 
kind 
of 
headache; 
but 
I 
expect 
it 
was 
that 
kind. 


December 
17th. 
I 
haven't 
managed 
to 
write 
anything 
for 
a 
whole 
week. 
The 
day 
before 
yesterday 
we 
had 
our 
Christmas 
reports: 
In 
history 
I 
had 
satisfactory, 
in 
Natural 
History 
good, 
in 
everything 
else 
very 
good. 
In 
diligence 
because 
of 
that 
stupid 
Vischer 
I 
had 
only 
a 
2. 
Father 
was 
very 
angry; 
he 
says 
everyone 
can 
get 
a 
1 
in 
diligence. 
That's 
true 
enough, 
but 
if 
one 
has 
satisfactory 
in 
anything 
then 
one 
can't 
get 
a 
1 
for 
diligence. 
Inspee 
of 
course 
had 
only 
1's, 
except 
a 
2 
in 
English. 
But 
then 
she's 
a 
frightful 
swot. 
Verbenowitsch 
is 
the 
best 
in 
our 
class, 
but 
we 
can't 
any 
of 
us 
bear 
her, 
she's 
so 
frantically 
conceited 
and 
Berta 
Franke 
says 
she's 
not 
to 
be 
trusted. 
Berta 
walks 
to 
school 
with 
her 
cousin 
who's 
in 
the 
seventh; 
she's 
nearly 
14, 
and 
is 
awfully 
pretty. 
She 
didn't 
say 
what 
sort 
of 
a 
report 
she 
had, 
but 
I 
believe 
it 
was 
a 
very 
bad 
one. 


December 
18th. 
To-day 
at 
supper 
Dora 
fainted 
because 
she 
found 
a 
little 
chicken 
in 
her 
egg, 
not 
really 
a 
chicken 
yet, 
but 
one 
could 
make 
out 
the 
wings 
and 
the 
head, 
just 
a 
sketch 
of 
a 
chicken 
Father 
said. 
Still, 
I 
really 
can't 
see 
what 
there 
was 
to 
faint 
about. 
Afterwards 
she 
said 
it 
had 
made 
her 
feel 
quite 
creepy. 
And 
she'll 
never 
be 
able 
to 
eat 
another 
egg. 
At 
first 
Father 
was 
quite 
frightened 
and 
so 
was 
Mother, 
but 
then 
he 
laughed 
and 
said: 
What 
a 
fuss 
about 
nothing! 
She 
had 
to 
go 
and 
lie 
down 
at 
once 
and 
I 
stayed 
downstairs 
for 
a 
long 
time. 
When 
I 
came 
up 
to 
our 
room 
she 
was 
reading, 
that 
is 
I 
saw 
the 
light 
through 
the 
crack 
in 
the 
door; 
but 
when 
I 
opened 
the 
door 
it 
was 
all 
dark 
and 
when 
I 
asked: 
Ah 
so 
you're 
still 
reading 
she 
didn't 
answer 
and 
she 
pretended 
to 
wake 
up 
when 
I 
switched 
on 
the 
light 
and 
said: 
What's 
the 
matter? 
I 
can't 
stand 
such 
humbug 
so 
I 
said: 
Shut 
up, 
you 
know 
quite 
well 
it's 
9 
o-clock. 
That's 
all. 
On 
our 
way 
to 
school 
to-day 
we 
didn't 
Speak 
a 
word 
to 
one 
another. 
Luckily 
after 
awhile 
we 
met 
a 
girl 
belonging 
to 
her 
class. 


December 
19th. 
I'm 
frightfully 
excited 
to 
know 
what 
I'm 
going 
to 
get 
for 
Christmas. 
What 
I've 
wished 
for 
is: 
A 
set 
of 
white 
furs, 
boa, 
muff, 
and 
velvet 



cap 
trimmed 
with 
the 
same 
fur, 
acme 
skates 
because 
mine 
are 
always 
working 
loose, 
German 
sagas, 
not 
Greek; 
no 
thank 
you, 
hair 
ribbons, 
openwork 
stockings, 
and 
if 
possible 
a 
gold 
pin 
like 
the 
one 
Hella 
got 
for 
a 
birthday 
present. 
But 
Father 
says 
that 
our 
Christ 
Child 
would 
find 
that 
rather 
too 
expensive. 
Inspee 
wants 
a 
corset. 
But 
I 
don't 
think 
she'll 
get 
one 
because 
it's 
unhealthy. 
The 
tablecloth 
for 
Father 
is 
finished 
and 
is 
being 
trimmed, 
but 
Mother's 
book 
cover 
is 
not 
quite 
ready 
yet. 
I'm 
giving 
Dora 
a 
little 
manicure 
case. 
Oh, 
and 
I'd 
nearly 
forgotten 
what 
I 
want 
more 
than 
anything 
else, 
a 
lock-up 
box 
in 
which 
to 
keep 
my 
diary. 
Dora 
wants 
some 
openwork 
stockings 
too 
and 
three 
books. 
A 
frightful 
thing 
happened 
to 
me 
the 
other 
day. 
I 
left 
one 
of 
the 
pages 
of 
my 
diary 
lying 
about 
or 
lost 
one 
somehow 
or 
other. 
When 
I 
came 
home 
Inspee 
said: 
"you've 
lost 
this, 
haven't 
you? 
School 
notes 
I 
suppose?" 
I 
didn't 
notice 
what 
it 
was 
for 
a 
moment, 
but 
then 
I 
saw 
by 
the 
look 
of 
it 
and 
said: 
Yes, 
those 
are 
school 
notes. 
Hm-m-m, 
said 
Inspee, 
not 
exactly 
that 
are 
they? 
You 
can 
thank 
your 
stars 
that 
I've 
not 
shown 
them 
to 
Mother. 
Besides 
people 
who 
can't 
spell 
yet 
really 
ought 
not 
to 
keep 
diaries. 
It's 
not 
suitable 
for 
children. 
I 
was 
in 
a 
wax. 
In 
the 
closet 
I 
took 
a 
squint 
to 
see 
what 
mistakes 
I 
had 
made. 
There 
was 
only 
wenn 
with 
one 
n 
instead 
of 
double 
n 
and 
dass 
with 
short 
ss's, 
that's 
all. 
I 
was 
jolly 
glad 
that 
there 
was 
nothing 
about 
her 
on 
the 
page. 
She'd 
under-lined 
the 
n 
and 
the 
short 
ss's 
with 
red, 
just 
as 
if 
she 
was 
a 
schoolmistress, 
infernal 
cheek! 
The 
best 
would 
be 
to 
have 
a 
book 
with 
a 
lock 
to 
it, 
which 
one 
could 
alway 
keep 
locked, 
then 
no 
one 
could 
read 
any 
of 
it 
and 
underline 
one's 
mistakes 
in 
red. 
I 
often 
write 
so 
fast 
that 
it's 
easy 
to 
make 
a 
slip 
now 
and 
again. 
As 
if 
she 
never 
made 
a 
mistake. 
The 
whole 
thing 
made 
me 
furious. 
But 
I 
can't 
say 
anything 
about 
it 
because 
of 
Mother, 
at 
least 
on 
the 
way 
to 
school; 
but 
no, 
if 
I 
say 
nothing 
at 
all 
then 
she 
always 
gets 
more 
waxy 
than 
ever. 
If 
I 
were 
to 
say 
much 
about 
it 
Mother 
might 
remember 
those 
5 
pages 
I 
lost 
in 
the 
country 
and 
I'd 
rather 
not 
thank 
you. 


December 
22nd. 
Aunt 
Dora 
came 
to-day. 
She's 
going 
to 
stay 
with 
us 
for 
a 
time 
till 
Mother 
is 
quite 
well 
again. 
I 
didn't 
remember 
her 
at 
all, 
for 
I 
was 
only 
four 
or 
five 
when 
she 
went 
away 
from 
Vienna. 
You 
dear 
little 
black 
beetle 
she 
said 
to 
me 
and 
gave 
me 
a 
kiss. 
I 
didn't 
like 
the 
black 
much, 
but 
Hella 
says 
that 
suits 
me, 
that 
it's 
piquant. 
Piquant 
is 
what 
the 
officers 
always 
say 
of 
her 
cousin 
in 
Krems, 
Father 
says 
she 
is 
a 
beauty, 
and 
she's 
dark 
like 
me. 
But 
I'd 
rather 
be 
fair, 
fair 
with 
brown 
eyes 
or 
better 
still 
with 
violet 
eyes. 



Shall 
I 
grow 
up 
a 
beauty? 
Oh 
I 
do 
hope 
I 
shall! 


December 
23rd. 
I 
am 
frightfully 
excited 
about 
to-morrow. 
I 
wonder 
what 
I 
shall 
get? 
Now 
I 
must 
go 
and 
decorate 
the 
Christmas 
tree. 
Inspee 
said: 
Hullo, 
is 
Gretl 
going 
to 
help 
decorate 
this 
year? 
She's 
never 
done 
it 
before! 
I 
should 
like 
to 
know 
why 
not. 
But 
Aunt 
Dora 
took 
my 
side. 
"Of 
course 
she'll 
help 
decorate 
too; 
but 
please 
don't 
stuff 
yourselves 
with 
sweets." 
"If 
Dora 
doesn't 
eat 
anything 
I 
shan't 
either," 
said 
I 
promptly. 


Evening. 
Yesterday 
was 
our 
last 
day 
at 
school. 
The 
holidays 
are 
from 
the 
23rd 
to 
January 
2nd. 
It's 
glorious. 
I 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
go 
skating 
every 
day. 
Of 
course 
I 
had 
no 
time 
to-day 
and 
shan't 
have 
to--morrow. 
I 
wonder 
whether 
I 
should 
send 
the 
Gold 
Fairy 
a 
Christmas 
card. 
I 
wish 
she 
had 
a 
prettier 
name. 
Anastasia 
Klastoschek; 
it 
is 
so 
ugly. 
All 
Czech 
names 
are 
so 
ugly. 
Father 
knows 
a 
Count 
Wilczek, 
but 
a 
still 
worse 
name 
is 
Schafgotsch. 
Nothing 
would 
induce 
me 
to 
marry 
anyone 
called 
Schafgotsch 
or 
Wilczek 
even 
if 
he 
were 
a 
count 
and 
a 
millionaire. 
Yesterday 
we 
paid 
our 
respects 
to 
the 
staff, 
Verbenowitsch 
and 
I 
went 
to 
Frau 
Doktor 
because 
she 
is 
fondest 
of 
us, 
or 
is 
said 
to 
be. 
Nobody 
wanted 
to 
go 
to 
Professor 
Rigl, 
Igel, 
we 
always 
say 
Nikel, 
for 
when 
he 
has 
respects 
paid 
to 
him 
he 
always 
says: 
"Aw 
ri'." 
But 
it 
would 
have 
been 
rude 
to 
leave 
him 
out 
and 
so 
the 
monitors 
had 
to 
go. 
When 
Christmas 
was 
drawing 
near 
Frau 
Doktor 
told 
us 
that 
we 
were 
none 
of 
us 
to 
give 
presents 
to 
the 
staff. 
"I 
beg 
you, 
girls, 
to 
bear 
in 
mind 
what 
I 
am 
saying, 
for 
if 
you 
do 
not 
there 
will 
only 
be 
trouble. 
You 
remember 
what 
happened 
on 
St. 
Nicholas' 
day. 
And 
you 
must 
not 
send 
anything 
to 
the 
homes 
of 
the 
staff, 
nor 
must 
the 
Christ 
Child 
leave 
anything 
on 
any 
one's 
doorstep." 
As 
she 
said 
this 
she 
looked 
hard 
at 
me 
and 
Edith 
Bergler, 
so 
she 
knows 
who 
left 
the 
Krampus. 
I'm 
so 
tired 
I 
can't 
keep 
my 
eyes 
open. 
Hurrah, 
to-morrow 
is 
Christmas 
Eve!!! 


December 
24th. 
Christmas 
Eve 
afternoon 
is 
horrid. 
One 
does 
not 
know 
what 
to 
be 
at. 
I'm 
not 
allowed 
to 
go 
skating 
so 
the 
best 
thing 
is 
to 
write. 
Oswald 
came 
home 
yesterday. 
Everyone 
says 
he's 
looking 
splendid; 
I 
think 
he's 
awfully 
pale 
and 
he 
snorted 
when 
everyone 
said 
he 
had 
such 
a 
fine 
colour; 
of 
course, 
how 
can 
he 
look 
well 
when 
he 
has 
such 
a 
heartache. 
I 
wish 
I 
could 
tell 
him 
that 
I 
understand 
what 
he 
feels, 
but 
he's 
too 
proud 
to 
accept 
sympathy 
from 
me. 
He 
has 
wished 
for 
an 
army 
revolver 
for 
Christmas, 
but 
I 
don't 
think 



he'll 
get 
one 
for 
boys 
at 
the 
middle 
school 
are 
not 
allowed 
to 
have 
any 
firearms. 
Not 
long 
ago 
at 
a 
Gymnasium 
in 
Galicia 
one 
of 
the 
boys 
shot 
a 
master 
out 
of 
revenge; 
they 
said 
it 
was 
because 
the 
boy 
was 
getting 
on 
badly 
with 
his 
work, 
but 
really 
it 
was 
about 
a 
girl, 
although 
the 
master 
was 
36 
years 
old. 
This 
morg. 
I 
was 
in 
town 
with 
Oswald 
shopping; 
we 
met 
the 
Warths, 
Elli 
and 
. 
. 
. 
Robert. 
Oswald 
said 
that 
Elli 
was 
quite 
nice-looking 
but 
that 
Robert 
was 
an 
ugly 
beast. 
Besides, 
he 
can't 
stand 
him 
he 
said, 
because 
he 
glared 
at 
me 
so. 
If 
only 
he 
knew 
what 
happened 
in 
the 
summer! 
I 
was 
awfully 
condescending 
to 
Robert 
and 
that 
made 
him 
furious. 
If 
one 
could 
only 
save 
you 
girls 
from 
all 
the 
troubles 
which 
the 
world 
calls 
"Love," 
said 
Oswald 
on 
the 
way 
home. 
I 
was 
just 
going 
to 
say 
"I 
know 
that 
you're 
unhappy 
in 
love 
and 
I 
can 
feel 
for 
you," 
when 
Inspee 
came 
round 
the 
corner 
of 
the 
Bognergasse 
with 
her 
chum 
and 
2 
officers 
were 
following 
them, 
so 
none 
of 
them 
saw 
us. 
"Great 
Scott, 
Frieda's 
full-fledged 
now," 
said 
Oswald, 
"she's 
a 
little 
tart." 
I 
can't 
stand 
that 
sort 
of 
vulgarity 
so 
I 
did 
not 
say 
another 
word 
all 
the 
way 
home. 
He 
noticed 
and 
said 
to 
Mother: 
"Gretl's 
mouth 
has 
been 
frozen 
up 
from 
envy." 
That's 
all. 
But 
it 
was 
really 
disgusting 
of 
him 
and 
now 
I 
know 
what 
line 
to 
take. 


Just 
a 
moment 
for 
a 
word 
or 
two. 
The 
whole 
Christmas 
Eve 
has 
gone 
to 
pot. 
A 
commissionaire 
came 
with 
a 
bouquet 
for 
Dora 
and 
Father 
is 
fuming. 
I 
wish 
I 
knew 
who 
sent 
it. 
I 
wonder 
if 
it 
was 
one 
of 
those 
2 
officers? 
Of 
course 
Inspee 
says 
she 
has 
not 
the 
ghost 
of 
an 
idea. 
What 
surprises 
me 
is 
that 
Oswald 
has 
not 
given 
her 
away. 
All 
he 
said 
was: 
I 
say, 
what 
a 
lark! 
But 
Father 
was 
down 
on 
him 
like 
anything, 
"You 
hold 
your 
jaw 
and 
think 
of 
your 
own 
beastly 
conduct." 
I 
didn't 
envy 
him; 
I 
don't 
think 
much 
of 
Dora's 
looks 
myself, 
but 
apparently 
she 
pleases 
someone. 
In 
the 
bouquet 
there 
was 
a 
poem 
and 
Dora 
got 
hold 
of 
it 
quickly 
before 
Father 
had 
seen 
it. 
It 
was 
awfully 
pretty, 
and 
it 
was 
signed: 
One 
for 
whom 
you 
have 
made 
Christmas 
beautiful! 
The 
heading 
is: 
"The 
Magic 
Season." 
I 
think 
Dora's 
splendid 
not 
to 
give 
herself 
away; 
even 
to 
me 
she 
declares 
she 
does 
not 
know 
who 
sent 
it; 
but 
of 
course 
that 
may 
be 
all 
humbug. 
I 
think 
it 
really 
comes 
from 
young 
Perathoner, 
with 
whom 
she's 
always 
skating. 


December 
28th. 
I've 
had 
absolutely 
no 
time 
to 
write. 
I 
got 
everything 
I 
wanted. 
Aunt 
Dora 
gave 
both 
of 
us 
an 
opera 
glass 
in 
mother-of-pearl 
in 
a 
plush 
case. 
We 
are 
going 
to 
all 
the 
school 
performances, 
Father's 
arranged 
it; 



he 
has 
subscribed 
to 
all 
the 
performances 
during 
the 
school 
year 
19--to 
19--. 
I 
am 
so 
delighted 
for 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
will 
come 
too. 
I 
do 
hope 
I 
shall 
sit 
next 
to 
her. 


December 
31st. 
To-day 
I 
wanted 
to 
read 
through 
all 
I 
have 
written, 
but 
I 
could 
not 
manage 
it 
but 
in 
the 
new 
year 
I 
really 
must 
write 
every 
day. 


January 
1st, 
19--. 
I 
must 
write 
a 
few 
sentences 
at 
least. 
For 
the 
afternoon 
we 
had 
been 
invited 
to 
the 
Rydberg's 
the 
Warths 
were 
there 
and 
Edle 
von 
Wernhoff!! 
I 
was 
just 
the 
same 
as 
usual 
with 
Lisel 
but 
I 
would 
not 
say 
a 
word 
to 
R. 
They 
left 
before 
us, 
and 
then 
Heddy 
asked 
me 
what 
was 
wrong 
between 
me 
and 
R. 
He 
had 
said 
of 
me: 
Any 
one 
can 
have 
the 
black 
goose 
for 
me. 
Then 
he 
said 
that 
any 
one 
could 
take 
me 
in. 
I 
was 
so 
stupid 
that 
I 
would 
believe 
anything. 
I 
can't 
think 
what 
he 
meant, 
for 
he 
never 
took 
me 
in 
about 
anything. 
Anyhow 
I 
would 
not 
let 
him 
spoil 
new 
year's 
day 
for 
me. 
But 
Hella 
is 
quite 
right 
for 
if 
the 
first 
person 
one 
meets 
on 
January 
1st 
is 
a 
common 
person 
that's 
a 
bad 
beginning. 
The 
first 
thing 
this 
morning 
when 
I 
went 
out 
I 
met 
our 
old 
postman 
who's 
always 
so 
grumpy 
if 
he's 
kept 
waiting 
at 
the 
door. 
I 
looked 
the 
other 
way 
directly 
and 
across 
the 
street 
a 
fine 
young 
gentleman 
was 
passing, 
but 
it 
was 
no 
good 
for 
the 
common 
postman 
had 
really 
been 
the 
first. 


January 
12th. 
I 
am 
so 
angry. 
We 
mayn't 
go 
skating 
any 
more 
because 
Inspee 
has 
begun 
to 
complain 
again 
of 
her 
silly 
old 
ears 
and 
Mother 
imagines 
that 
she 
got 
her 
earache 
last 
year 
skating. 
It's 
all 
right 
to 
keep 
her 
at 
home; 
but 
why 
shouldn't 
I 
go? 
How 
can 
I 
help 
it 
when 
she 
gets 
a 
chill 
so 
easily? 
In 
most 
things 
Father 
is 
justice 
itself, 
but 
I 
really 
can't 
understand 
him 
this 
time. 
It's 
simply 
absurd, 
only 
it's 
too 
miserable 
to 
call 
it 
absurd. 
I'm 
in 
a 
perfect 
fury. 
Still, 
I 
don't 
say 
anything. 


February 
12th. 
I 
have 
not 
written 
for 
a 
whole 
month, 
I've 
been 
working 
so 
hard. 
To-day 
we 
got 
our 
reports. 
Although 
I've 
been 
working 
so 
frightfully 
hard, 
again 
I 
only 
got 
a 
2 
in 
Diligence. 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
made 
a 
splendid 
speech 
and 
said: 
As 
you 
sow, 
so 
you 
shall 
reap. 
But 
that's 
not 
always 
true. 
In 
Natural 
History 
I 
did 
not 
know 
my 
lesson 
twice 
but 
I 
got 
a 
1, 
and 
in 
History 
I 
only 
did 
not 
know 
my 
lesson 
once 
and 
I 
got 
Satisfactory. 
Anyhow 
Fraulein 


V. 
does 
not 
like 
me 
because 
of 
that 
time 
when 
I 
did 
not 
bow 
to 
her 
in 
the 
tram. 
That 
is 
why 
in 
January, 
when 
Mother 
asked 
about 
me, 
she 
said: 
"She 
does 
not 
really 
put 
her 
back 
into 
her 
work." 
I 
overheard 
Father 
say: 
After 
all 

she's 
only 
a 
kid, 
but 
to-day 
he 
made 
a 
frightful 
row 
about 
the 
2 
in 
Diligence. 
He 
might 
have 
known 
why 
she 
gave 
me 
that. 
Dora, 
so 
she 
says, 
has 
only 
ones, 
but 
she 
has 
not 
shown 
me 
the 
report. 
I 
don't 
believe 
what 
I 
don't 
see. 
And 
Mother 
never 
gives 
her 
away 
to 
me. 


February 
15th. 
Father 
is 
furious 
because 
Oswald 
has 
an 
Unsatisfactory 
in 
Greek. 
Greek 
is 
really 
no 
use; 
for 
no 
one 
uses 
Greek, 
except 
the 
people 
who 
live 
in 
Greece 
and 
Oswald 
will 
never 
go 
there, 
if 
he 
is 
going 
to 
be 
a 
judge 
like 
Father. 
Of 
course 
Dora 
learns 
Latin; 
but 
not 
for 
me 
thank 
you. 
Hella's 
report 
is 
not 
particularly 
good 
and 
her 
father 
was 
in 
a 
perfect 
fury!!! 
He 
says 
she 
ought 
to 
have 
a 
better 
report 
than 
any 
one 
else. 
She 
does 
not 
bother 
much 
and 
says: 
One 
can't 
have 
everything. 
But 
if 
she 
doesn't 
get 
nothing 
but 
ones 
in 
the 
summer 
term 
she 
is 
not 
to 
stay 
at 
the 
high 
school 
and 
will 
have 
to 
go 
to 
the 
middle 
school. 
That'll 
make 
her 
sit 
up. 
Father's 
awfully 
funny 
too: 
What 
have 
you 
got 
history 
books 
for, 
if 
you 
don't 
read 
them? 
Yesterday 
when 
I 
was 
reading 
my 
album 
of 
stories, 
Father 
came 
in 
and 
said: 
You 
like 
a 
story 
book 
better 
than 
a 
history 
book, 
and 
shut 
the 
book 
up 
and 
took 
it 
away 
from 
me. 
I 
was 
in 
such 
a 
temper 
that 
I 
went 
to 
bed 
at 
7 
o'clock 
without 
any 
supper. 


February 
20th. 
I 
met 
the 
Gold 
Fairy 
to-day. 
She 
spoke 
to 
me 
and 
asked 
why 
I 
did 
not 
come 
skating 
any 
more. 
The 
fancy 
dress 
Ice 
Carnival 
on 
the 
24th 
was 
splendid 
she 
said. 
I 
said: 
Would 
you 
believe 
it, 
a 
year 
ago 
my 
sister 
had 
an 
earache, 
and 
for 
that 
reason 
they 
won't 
allow 
either 
of 
us 
to 
skate 
this 
year. 
She 
laughed 
like 
anything 
and 
said 
so 
exquisitely: 
Oh, 
what 
a 
wicked 
sister. 
She 
looked 
perfectly 
ravishing: 
A 
red-brown 
coat 
and 
skirt 
trimmed 
with 
fur, 
sable 
I 
believe, 
and 
a 
huge 
brown 
beaver 
hat 
with 
crepe-de-chine 
ribbons, 
lovely. 
And 
her 
eyes 
and 
mouth. 
I 
believe 
she 
will 
marry 
the 
man 
who 
is 
always 
going 
about 
with 
her. 
Next 
autumn, 
when 
we 
get 
new 
winter 
clothes, 
I 
shall 
have 
a 
fur 
trimmed 
red-brown. 
We 
must 
not 
always 
be 
dressed 
alike. 
Hella 
and 
Lizzi 
are 
never 
dressed 
alike. 


March 
8th. 
I 
shall 
never 
say 
another 
word 
to 
Berta 
Franker 
she's 
utterly 
false. 
I've 
such 
a 
frightful 
headache 
because 
I 
cried 
all 
through 
the 
lesson. 
She 
wrote 
to 
Hella 
and 
me 
in 
the 
arithmetic 
lesson: 
A 
Verhaltnis[2] 
means 
something 
quite 
different. 
Just 
at 
that 
moment 
the 
mistress 
looked 
across 
and 
said: 
To 
whom 
were 
you 
nodding? 
She 
said: 
To 
Lainer. 
Because 
she 
laughed 
at 
the 
word 
"Verhaltnis." 
It 
was 
not 
true. 
I 
had 
not 
thought 
about 
the 
word 
at 



all. 
It 
wasn't 
till 
I 
had 
read 
the 
note 
that 
it 
occurred 
to 
Hella 
and 
me 
what 
Verhaltnis 
means. 
After 
the 
lesson 
Fraulein 
St. 
called 
us 
down 
into 
the 
teachers' 
room 
and 
told 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
that 
Franke 
and 
I 
had 
laughed 
at 
the 
use 
of 
the 
word 
"Verhaltnis." 
Frau 
Doktor 
said: 
What 
was 
there 
to 
laugh 
at? 
Why 
did 
you 
not 
just 
do 
your 
sums? 
Fraulein 
St. 
said: 
You 
ought 
to 
be 
ashamed 
of 
yourselves, 
young 
girls 
in 
the 
first 
class 
shouldn't 
know 
anything 
about 
such 
things. 
I 
shall 
have 
to 
speak 
to 
your 
mothers. 
In 
the 
German 
lesson 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
told 
us 
to 
write 
an 
essay 
on 
the 
proverb: 
Pure 
the 
heart 
and 
true 
the 
word, 
clear 
the 
brow 
and 
free 
the 
eye, 
these 
are 
our 
safeguards, 
or 
something 
of 
that 
sort; 
I 
must 
get 
Hella 
to 
write 
it 
for 
me, 
for 
I 
was 
crying 
all 
through 
the 
lesson. 


[2] 
The 
German 
word 
Verhaltnis 
as 
used 
in 
the 
arithmetic 
lesson 
means 
ratio, 
proportion. 
The 
word 
is 
in 
common 
use 
in 
Germany 
for 
a 
love 
intimacy 
or 
liaison.--Translators' 
Note. 
March 
10th. 
To-day 
Berta 
Franke 
wanted 
to 
talk 
things 
out 
with 
us; 
but 
Hella 
and 
I 
told 
her 
we 
would 
not 
speak 
to 
her 
again. 
We 
told 
her 
to 
remember 
what 
sort 
of 
things 
she 
had 
said 
to 
us. 
She 
denied 
it 
all 
already. 
We 
shouldn't 
be 
such 
humbugs. 
It 
was 
mean 
of 
her. 
Really 
we 
didn't 
know 
anything 
and 
she 
told 
us 
all 
about 
it. 
Hella 
has 
told 
me 
again 
and 
again 
she 
wished 
we 
didn't 
know 
anything. 
She 
says 
she's 
always 
afraid 
of 
giving 
herself 
away 
and 
that 
she 
often 
thinks 
about 
that 
sort 
of 
thing 
when 
she 
ought 
to 
be 
learning 
her 
lessons. 
So 
do 
I. 
And 
one 
often 
dreams 
about 
such 
things 
at 
night 
when 
one 
has 
been 
talking 
about 
them 
in 
the 
afternoon. 
Still, 
it's 
better 
to 
know 
all 
about 
it. 


March 
22nd. 
I 
so 
seldom 
manage 
to 
write 
anything, 
first 
of 
all 
our 
lessons 
take 
such 
a 
lot 
of 
time, 
and 
second 
because 
I 
don't 
care 
about 
it 
any 
more 
since 
what 
Father 
said 
the 
other 
day. 
The 
last 
time 
I 
wrote 
was 
on 
Saturday 
afternoon, 
and 
Father 
came 
in 
and 
said: 
Come 
along 
children, 
we'll 
go 
to 
Schonbrunn. 
That 
will 
do 
you 
more 
good 
than 
scribbling 
diaries 
which 
you 
only 
go 
and 
lose 
when 
you've 
written 
them. 
So 
Mother 
told 
Father 
all 
about 
it 
in 
the 
holidays. 
I 
couldn't 
have 
believed 
it 
of 
Mother 
for 
I 
begged 
her 
to 
promise 
not 
to 
tell 
anyone. 
And 
she 
said: 
One 
doesn't 
promise 
about 
a 
thing 
like 
that; 
but 
I 
won't 
tell 
anyone. 
And 
now 
she 
must 
have 
told 
about 
it, 
although 
she 
said 
she 
wouldn't. 
Even 
Franke's 
deceitfulness 
was 
nothing 
to 



that 
for 
after 
all 
we've 
only 
known 
her 
since 
last 
autumn, 
but 
I 
could 
never 
have 
believed 
that 
Mother 
would 
do 
such 
a 
thing. 
I 
told 
Hella 
when 
we 
were 
having 
tea 
at 
the 
Tivoli 
and 
she 
said 
she 
would 
not 
altogether 
trust 
her 
mother, 
she'd 
rather 
trust 
her 
father. 
But 
if 
that 
had 
happened 
to 
her, 
her 
father 
would 
have 
boxed 
her 
ears 
with 
the 
diary. 
I 
did 
not 
want 
to 
show 
anything, 
but 
in 
the 
evening 
I 
only 
gave 
Mother 
quite 
a 
little 
kiss. 
And 
she 
said, 
what's 
the 
matter, 
dear? 
has 
anything 
happened? 
Then 
I 
could 
not 
keep 
it 
in 
and 
I 
cried 
like 
anything 
and 
said: 
You've 
betrayed 
me. 
And 
Mother 
said: 
"I?" 
Yes, 
you; 
you 
told 
Father 
about 
the 
diary 
though 
you 
promised 
me 
you 
wouldn't. 
At 
first 
Mother 
didn't 
remember 
anything 
about 
it, 
but 
soon 
she 
remembered 
and 
said: 
"But, 
little 
one, 
I 
tell 
Father 
everything. 
All 
you 
meant 
was 
that 
Dora 
was 
not 
to 
know." 
That's 
quite 
true, 
it's 
all 
right 
that 
Dora 
wasn't 
told; 
but 
still 
Father 
need 
not 
have 
been 
told 
either. 
And 
Mother 
was 
awfully 
sweet 
and 
nice 
and 
I 
didn't 
go 
to 
bed 
till 
10 
o'clock. 
But 
whatever 
happens 
I 
shan't 
tell 
her 
anything 
again 
and 
I 
don't 
care 
about 
the 
old 
diary 
any 
more. 
Hella 
says: 
Don't 
be 
stupid; 
I 
ought 
just 
to 
go 
on 
writing; 
but 
another 
time 
I 
should 
be 
careful 
not 
to 
lose 
anything, 
and 
besides 
I 
should 
not 
blab 
everything 
to 
Mother 
and 
Father. 
She 
says 
she 
no 
longer 
tells 
her 
mother 
anything 
since 
that 
time 
in 
the 
summer 
when 
her 
mother 
gave 
her 
a 
box 
on 
the 
ear 
because 
that 
other 
girl 
had 
told 
her 
all 
about 
everything. 
It's 
quite 
true, 
Hella 
is 
right, 
I'm 
just 
a 
child 
still 
in 
the 
way 
I 
run 
to 
Mother 
and 
tell 
her 
everything. 
And 
it's 
not 
nice 
of 
Father 
to 
tease 
me 
about 
my 
diary; 
I 
suppose 
he 
never 
kept 
one 
himself. 


March 
27th. 
Hurrah 
we're 
going 
to 
Hainfeld 
for 
Easter; 
I 
am 
so 
delighted. 
Mother 
has 
a 
friend 
there 
whose 
husband 
is 
doctor 
there, 
so 
she 
has 
to 
live 
there 
all 
the 
year 
round. 
Last 
year 
in 
the 
winter 
she 
and 
Ada 
stayed 
three 
days 
with 
us 
because 
her 
eyes 
were 
bad. 
Ada 
is 
really 
nearly 
as 
old 
as 
Dora, 
but 
Dora 
said, 
like 
her 
cheek: 
"Her 
intellectual 
level 
makes 
her 
much 
more 
suitable 
company 
for 
you 
than 
for 
me." 
Dora 
thinks 
herself 
cleverer 
than 
anyone 
else. 
They 
have 
2 
boys, 
but 
I 
don't 
know 
them 
very 
well 
for 
they 
are 
only 
8 
and 
9. 
Mother's 
friend 
was 
in 
an 
asylum 
once, 
for 
she 
went 
off 
her 
head 
when 
her 
2 
year 
old 
baby 
died. 
I 
remember 
it 
quite 
well. 
It 
must 
have 
been 
more 
than 
2 
years 
ago 
when 
Father 
and 
Mother 
were 
always 
talking 
of 
poor 
Anna 
who 
had 
lost 
her 
child 
within 
3 
days. 
And 
I 
believed 
she 
had 
really 
lost 
it, 
and 
once 
I 
asked 
whether 
they 
had 
found 
it 
yet. 
I 
thought 
it 
had 
been 
lost 
in 
the 
forest, 
because 
there's 
such 
a 
great 
forest 
at 
Hainfeld. 
And 



since 
then 
I 
can't 
bear 
to 
hear 
people 
say 
lost 
when 
they 
mean 
dead, 
for 
it 
is 
so 
difficult 
to 
know 
which 
they 
really 
mean. 


On 
the 
8th 
of 
April 
the 
Easter 
holidays 
will 
begin 
and 
we 
shall 
go 
on 
the 
11th, 
on 
Maundy 
Thursday. 


April 
6th. 
I 
don't 
know 
what 
to 
do 
about 
writing 
my 
diary. 
I 
don't 
want 
to 
take 
it 
with 
me 
and 
as 
for 
remembering 
everything 
and 
writing 
it 
down 
afterwards 
I 
know 
quite 
well 
I 
should 
never 
do 
that. 
Hella 
says 
I 
should 
only 
jot 
it 
down 
in 
outline, 
that's 
what 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
always 
says, 
and 
write 
it 
out 
properly 
after 
I 
come 
back 
from 
Hainfeld. 
That's 
what 
she 
does. 
They 
are 
going 
to 
the 
Brioni 
Islands. 
I've 
never 
seen 
the 
sea. 
Hella 
says 
there's 
nothing 
so 
wonderful 
about 
it. 
She's 
been 
there 
four 
times. 
Anyway 
she 
does 
not 
think 
so 
much 
of 
it 
as 
most 
people 
do. 
So 
it 
can't 
be 
anything 
so 
frightfully 
grand. 
Rather 
stupid 
I 
dare 
say. 


April 
12th. 
We 
got 
here 
yesterday. 
Ada 
is 
a 
darling 
but 
the 
two 
boys 
are 
awfully 
vulgar. 
Ernstl 
said 
to 
Ada: 
I 
shall 
give 
you 
a 
smack 
on 
the 
a----if 
you 
don't 
give 
me 
my 
pistol 
directly. 
Ada 
is 
as 
tall 
as 
her 
mother. 
Their 
speech 
is 
rather 
countrified 
Even 
the 
doctor's. 
He 
drinks 
a 
frightful 
lot 
of 
beer; 
quarts 
I 
believe. 


April 
14th. 
Father 
came 
to-day. 
He's 
awfully 
fond 
of 
the 
doctor. 
They 
kissed 
one 
another. 
It 
did 
make 
me 
laugh. 
In 
the 
morning 
we 
were 
in 
the 
forest; 
but 
there 
are 
no 
violets 
yet, 
only 
a 
few 
snowdrops, 
but 
a 
tremendous 
lot 
of 
hellebores 
quite 
red. 


April 
15th. 
We 
got 
up 
at 
4 
yesterday 
morning. 
We 
did 
not 
go 
into 
the 
church 
for 
Mother 
was 
afraid 
that 
the 
smell 
of 
incense 
and 
boots 
would 
make 
Dora 
feel 
bad. 
What 
rot! 
It 
was 
lovely. 
This 
afternoon 
we 
are 
going 
to 
Ramsau, 
it's 
lovely 
there. 


April 
16th. 
Father 
went 
home 
to-day. 
We 
go 
home 
to-morrow. 
At 
Whitsuntide 
Ada's 
mother 
is 
going 
to 
bring 
her 
to 
be 
confirmed. 
They 
are 
all 
coming 
to 
stay 
with 
us. 
I 
got 
stuck 
in 
a 
bog 
on 
the 
bank 
of 
the 
Ramsau. 
It 
was 
awful. 
But 
the 
doctor 
pulled 
me 
out 
and 
then 
we 
did 
all 
laugh 
so 
when 
we 
saw 
what 
my 
shoes 
and 
stockings 
were 
like. 
Luckily 
I 
was 
able 
to 
catch 
hold 
of 
a 
tree 
stump 
or 
I 
should 
have 
sunk 
right 
in. 



April 
18th. 
Hella 
says 
it 
was 
splendid 
at 
the 
Brioni 
Islands. 
She 
is 
frightfully 
sunburned. 
I 
don't 
like 
that, 
so 
I 
shall 
never 
go 
to 
the 
south. 
Hella 
says 
that 
if 
one 
marries 
in 
winter 
one 
must 
spend 
one's 
honeymoon 
in 
the 
south. 
That 
would 
not 
suit 
me, 
I 
should 
just 
put 
off 
my 
marriage 
till 
the 
summer. 


Ada 
is 
only 
13 
not 
14 
like 
Dora, 
and 
the 
parish 
priest 
makes 
a 
tremendous 
fuss 
because 
she's 
not 
confirmed 
yet. 
Her 
mother 
is 
going 
to 
bring 
her 
to 
be 
confirmed 
soon. 
We 
are 
not 
going 
to 
be 
confirmed 
because 
Father 
and 
Mother 
don't 
want 
to 
be 
bothered 
with 
it. 
Still 
I 
should 
like 
to 
be 
confirmed, 
for 
then 
one 
has 
to 
have 
a 
watch, 
and 
one 
can 
ask 
for 
something 
else 
at 
Christmas. 


April 
21st. 
Our 
lessons 
are 
something 
frightful 
just 
now. 
The 
school 
inspector 
is 
coming 
soon. 
It's 
always 
very 
disagreeable. 
Mme 
A. 
says: 
The 
in-spection 
is 
for 
the 
staff 
not 
for 
the 
pupils. 
Still, 
it's 
horrid 
for 
the 
pupils 
too 
first 
of 
all 
because 
we 
get 
blamed 
at 
the 
time 
and 
secondly 
because 
the 
staff 
makes 
such 
a 
frightful 
row 
about 
it 
afterwards. 
Dora 
says 
that 
a 
bad 
inspection 
can 
make 
one's 
report 
2 
degrees 
worse. 
By 
the 
way, 
that 
reminds 
me 
that 
I 
have 
not 
yet 
written 
why 
Oswald 
did 
not 
come 
home 
at 
Easter. 
Although 
his 
reports 
were 
not 
at 
all 
good, 
he 
was 
allowed 
to 
go 
to 
Aunt 
Alma's 
at 
Pola, 
because 
this 
year 
Richard 
comes 
home 
for 
the 
holidays 
for 
the 
last 
time. 
After 
that 
he's 
going 
away 
for 
three 
years 
in 
the 
steamship 
"Ozean" 
to 
the 
East 
or 
Turkey 
or 
Persia, 
I 
don't 
quite 
know 
where. 
If 
Oswald 
likes 
he 
can 
go 
into 
the 
Navy 
too 
in 
two 
years. 


May 
9th. 
The 
school 
inspector 
came 
to-day, 
first 
of 
all 
in 
natural 
history, 
thank 
goodness 
I 
wasn't 
in 
for 
it 
that 
time, 
and 
then 
in 
German; 
I 
was 
in 
that, 
reading 
and 
in 
the 
table 
of 
contents 
of 
the 
Wandering 
Bells. 
Thank 
goodness 
I 
got 
through 
all 
right. 


May 
14th. 
It's 
Mother's 
birthday 
to-day. 
We've 
had 
simply 
no 
time 
to 
work 
anything 
for 
her, 
so 
we 
got 
a 
wonderful 
electric 
lamp 
for 
her 
bed 
table, 
the 
switch 
is 
a 
bunch 
of 
grapes 
and 
the 
stand 
is 
made 
of 
brass. 
She 
was 
so 
pleased 
with 
it. 
Yesterday 
Frau 
v. 
R. 
was 
here. 
She's 
a 
friend 
of 
Mother's 
and 
of 
Hella's 
mother. 
I 
should 
like 
to 
have 
music 
lessons 
from 
Frau 
v. 
R., 
she 
gives 
lessons 
since 
her 
husband 
who 
was 
a 
major 
died 
though 
she 
is 
quite 
well 
off. 



May 
15th. 
That 
must 
have 
been 
true 
about 
the 
inspection; 
in 
the 
interval 
today 
Professor 
Igel-Nikel 
said 
to 
the 
Herr 
Religionsprofessor: 
Well, 
he 
will 
go 
on 
coming 
all 
through 
the 
week 
and 
then 
we 
shall 
be 
all 
right 
for 
this 
year. 
We, 
of 
course 
that 
means 
the 
staff. 
But 
really 
the 
staff 
can't 
help 
it 
if 
the 
pupils 
are 
no 
good. 
Though 
Oswald 
says 
it's 
all 
the 
fault 
of 
the 
staff. 
I 
shall 
be 
glad 
too 
when 
the 
inspection 
is 
over. 
The 
staff 
is 
always 
quite 
different 
when 
the 
inspector 
is 
there, 
some 
are 
better, 
some 
are 
stricter, 
and 
Mme. 
A. 
says: 
I 
always 
feel 
quite 
ill 
with 
anxiety. 


May 
29th. 
At 
Whitsuntide 
Frau 
Doctor 
Haslinger 
came 
from 
Hainfeld 
with 
Ada 
and 
the 
two 
boys 
for 
the 
confirmation. 
On 
Whitsunday 
the 
doctor 
came 
too 
and 
in 
the 
evening 
they 
all 
went 
home 
again. 
Ada 
is 
very 
pretty, 
but 
she 
looks 
countrified. 
I'm 
not 
going 
to 
be 
confirmed 
anyhow. 
We 
had 
to 
wait 
3 
hours, 
though 
the 
Friday 
before 
Whitsunday 
was 
a 
very 
fine 
day. 
Dora 
did 
not 
come; 
only 
Mother 
and 
I 
and 
Ada 
and 
her 
mother. 
The 
women 
who 
were 
selling 
white 
favours 
all 
thought 
that 
I 
was 
one 
of 
the 
candidates 
because 
I 
wore 
a 
white 
dress 
too. 
Ada 
was 
rather 
put 
out 
about 
it. 
On 
Saturday 
we 
were 
in 
town 
in 
the 
morning 
and 
afternoon 
because 
Ada 
liked 
that 
better 
than 
the 
Kahlenberg; 
on 
Sunday 
morning 
we 
went 
to 
Schonbrunn 
and 
in 
the 
afternoon 
they 
went 
home. 
The 
watch 
they 
gave 
to 
Ada 
was 
a 
lovely 
one 
and 
Dora 
and 
I 
gave 
her 
a 
gold 
chain 
for 
a 
locket. 
She 
enjoyed 
herself 
immensely, 
except 
that 
on 
Sunday 
she 
had 
a 
frightful 
headache. 
Because 
she 
is 
not 
used 
to 
town 
noises. 


May 
31st. 
Ada 
knows 
a 
good 
deal 
already, 
but 
not 
everything. 
I 
told 
her 
a 
few 
things. 
In 
H. 
last 
winter 
a 
girl 
drowned 
herself 
because 
she 
was 
going 
to 
have 
a 
baby. 
It 
made 
a 
great 
sensation 
and 
her 
mother 
told 
her 
a 
little, 
but 
not 
everything. 
Ada 
once 
saw 
a 
bitch 
having 
her 
pups, 
but 
she 
didn't 
tell 
her 
mother 
about 
it; 
she 
thought 
that 
her 
mother 
might 
be 
very 
angry. 
Still, 
she 
could 
not 
help 
it, 
the 
dog 
belonged 
to 
their 
next 
door 
neighbour 
and 
she 
happened 
to 
see 
it 
in 
the 
out-house. 
Ada 
is 
expecting 
it 
to 
begin 
every 
day 
for 
she 
is 
nearly 
14. 
In 
H. 
every 
grown-up 
girl 
has 
an 
admirer. 
Ada 
says 
she 
will 
have 
one 
as 
soon 
as 
she 
is 
14; 
she 
knows 
who 
it 
will 
be. 


June 
3rd. 
Ada 
wrote 
to-day 
to 
thank 
Mother 
about 
the 
confirmation 
and 
she 
wrote 
to 
me 
as 
well. 
It 
is 
strange 
that 
she 
did 
not 
make 
friends 
with 
Dora 
but 
with 
me. 
I 
think 
that 
Dora 
won't 
talk 
about 
those 
things, 
at 
least 
only 
with 
her 



friends 
in 
the 
high 
school, 
especially 
with 
Frieda 
Ertl. 
That 
is 
why 
Ada 
made 
friends 
with 
me, 
though 
I 
am 
2 
years 
younger. 
She 
is 
really 
an 
awfully 
nice 
girl. 


June 
19th. 
One 
thing 
after 
another 
goes 
missing 
in 
our 
class, 
first 
it 
was 
Fleischer's 
galoshes, 
then 
my 
new 
gloves, 
three 
times 
money 
was 
missing, 
and 
today 
Fraulein 
Steiner's 
new 
vanity 
bag. 
There 
was 
a 
great 
enquiry. 
But 
nothing 
was 
found 
out. 
We 
all 
think 
it 
is 
Schmolka. 
But 
no 
one 
will 
tell. 
Today 
we 
could 
none 
of 
us 
attend 
to 
our 
lessons 
especially 
when 
Sch. 
left 
the 
room 
at 
half 
past 
11. 


June 
20th. 
In 
our 
closet 
the 
school 
servant 
found 
some 
beads 
on 
the 
floor 
but 
since 
she 
did 
not 
know 
anything 
she 
threw 
them 
into 
the 
dustbin. 
Was 
it 
really 
Sch.? 
It 
would 
be 
a 
dirty 
trick. 
Frl. 
St. 
is 
frightfully 
upset 
because 
her 
betrothed 
gave 
her 
the 
vanity 
bag 
for 
a 
birthday 
present 
and 
his 
photo 
was 
in 
it. 
But 
I'm 
really 
sorry 
for 
Sch. 
Nobody 
will 
speak 
to 
her 
although 
nothing 
is 
proved 
yet. 
She 
is 
frightfully 
pale 
and 
her 
eyes 
are 
always 
full 
of 
tears. 
Hella 
thinks 
too 
that 
perhaps 
she 
didn't 
do 
it, 
for 
she 
is 
one 
of 
Frl. 
St.'s 
favourites 
and 
she 
is 
very 
fond 
of 
her 
herself. 
She 
always 
carries 
the 
copybooks 
home 
for 
her. 


June 
22nd. 
Our 
closet 
was 
stopped 
up 
and 
when 
the 
porter 
came 
to 
see 
what 
was 
the 
matter 
he 
found 
the 
vanity 
bag. 
But 
what 
use 
is 
it 
to 
Frl. 
now; 
she 
can't 
possibly 
use 
it 
any 
more. 
We 
giggled 
all 
through 
lessons 
whenever 
we 
caught 
one 
another's 
eye 
and 
the 
staff 
was 
in 
a 
frightful 
rage. 
Only 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
said: 
"Now 
please 
get 
through 
with 
your 
laughing 
over 
this 
extremely 
unsavoury 
affair, 
and 
then 
have 
done 
with 
it." 


June 
23rd. 
There 
was 
a 
frightful 
row 
to-day. 
Verbenowitsch 
was 
collecting 
the 
German 
copybooks 
and 
when 
Sch. 
wanted 
to 
hand 
up 
her 
copybook 
she 
said: 
Please 
give 
up 
your 
copybook 
yourself; 
I 
won't 
have 
anything 
to 
do 
with 
(then 
there 
was 
a 
long 
pause) 
you. 
We 
were 
all 
apalled 
and 
Sch. 
went 
as 
white 
as 
a 
sheet. 
At 
10 
o'clock 
she 
begged 
permission 
to 
leave 
the 
room 
because 
she 
felt 
bad. 
I'm 
sure 
her 
mother 
will 
come 
to 
speak 
about 
it 
tomorrow. 


June 
24th. 
Sch.'s 
mother 
did 
not 
come 
after 
all. 
Verbenowitsch 
said: 
Of 
course 
not! 
Sch. 
did 
not 
come 
either. 
Hella 
says 
she 
couldn't 
stand 
anything 



like 
that, 
she 
would 
rather 
drown 
herself. 
I 
don't 
know, 
one 
wants 
other 
reasons 
for 
drowning 
oneself. 
Still, 
I 
should 
tell 
Father 
so 
that 
he 
could 
speak 
about 
it 
at 
school. 
Franke 
said: 
Yes, 
that's 
all 
very 
well, 
because 
you 
didn't 
do 
it; 
but 
if 
one 
had 
done 
it 
one 
would 
not 
dare 
to 
say 
anything 
at 
home. 
Besides, 
Sch.'s 
father 
is 
an 
invalid, 
he's 
quite 
paralysed, 
has 
been 
bedridden 
for 
two 
years 
and 
can't 
speak. 


June 
27th. 
To-day 
Hella 
and 
I 
walked 
home 
with 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
Really 
she 
always 
goes 
home 
alone 
but 
Hella 
suddenly 
left 
me 
and 
went 
up 
to 
Frau 
Doktor 
in 
the 
street 
and 
said: 
Please 
excuse 
me 
Frau 
Doktor 
for 
bothering 
you 
in 
the 
street, 
we 
must 
speak 
to 
you. 
She 
got 
quite 
red. 
Then 
Frau 
Doktor 
said: 
"What's 
the 
matter?" 
And 
Hella 
said: 
"Isn't 
it 
possible 
to 
find 
out 
who 
took 
the 
vanity 
bag? 
If 
it 
wasn't 
Sch. 
the 
way 
the 
other 
girls 
treat 
her 
will 
make 
her 
quite 
ill, 
and 
if 
it 
was 
we 
can't 
stand 
having 
her 
among 
us 
any 
longer." 
Hella 
was 
really 
splendid 
and 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
made 
us 
tell 
her 
everything 
that 
had 
happened, 
including 
about 
Verbenowitsch 
and 
the 
copybooks; 
and 
we 
saw 
quite 
clearly 
she 
had 
tears 
in 
her 
eyes 
and 
she 
said: 
"The 
poor 
child! 
Children 
I 
promise 
I 
will 
do 
what 
I 
can 
for 
her." 
We 
both 
kissed 
her 
hand 
and 
my 
heart 
beat 
furiously. 
And 
Hella 
said: 
"You 
are 
an 
angel." 
I 
could 
never 
have 
managed 
to 
say 
a 
thing 
like 
that. 


June 
28th. 
To-day 
Sch. 
was 
there 
again, 
but 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
did 
not 
say 
anything. 
Hella 
and 
I 
kept 
on 
looking 
at 
her 
and 
Hella 
cleared 
her 
throat 
three 
times 
and 
Frau 
Doktor 
said: 
Bruckner, 
do 
stop 
clearing 
your 
throat; 
it 
will 
only 
make 
your 
sore 
throat 
worse: 
But 
it 
seemed 
to 
me 
her 
eyes 
twinkled 
as 
she 
said 
it. 
So 
she 
hasn't 
forgotten. 
I 
wanted 
to 
speak 
to 
Sch., 
but 
Hella 
said: 
Wait 
a 
bit, 
we 
must 
give 
the 
Frau 
Doktor 
a 
chance. 
She's 
taken 
the 
matter 
in 
hand. 
To-morrow 
before 
9 
we'll 
walk 
up 
and 
down 
in 
front 
of 
her 
house 
till 
she 
comes 
out. 


June 
30th. 
Unluckily 
yesterday 
was 
a 
holiday 
and 
to-day 
Frau 
Doktor's 
first 
lesson 
began 
at 
11. 
But 
she 
has 
already 
had 
a 
talk 
with 
Sch. 
only 
we 
don't 
know 
when 
and 
where; 
certainly 
it 
was 
not 
in 
the 
interval 
and 
she 
did 
not 
send 
for 
Sch. 
during 
lessons. 


July 
1st. 
To-day 
we 
walked 
to 
school 
with 
her 
She 
is 
such 
a 
dear. 
Children, 
she 
said, 
this 
is 
such 
a 
painful 
matter, 
and 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
find 
a 
way 
out. 
Sch. 
insists 
that 
she 
did 
not 
do 
it, 
and 
whether 
she 
did 
it 
or 
not 
these 
days 
are 



burning 
themselves 
into 
her 
soul 
and 
Hella 
asked: 
"Please, 
Frau 
Doktor 
advise 
us 
what 
to 
do, 
speak 
to 
her 
or 
not?" 
Then 
she 
said: 
Children 
I 
think 
that 
after 
this 
affair 
she 
won't 
come 
back 
to 
us 
next 
year; 
you 
will 
be 
doing 
a 
good 
work 
if 
you 
make 
these 
last 
days 
bearable 
to 
her. 
You 
were 
never 
intimate 
with 
her, 
but 
to 
give 
her 
a 
friendly 
word 
or 
two 
will 
do 
you 
no 
harm 
and 
may 
help 
her. 
You 
2 
have 
a 
high 
standing 
in 
the 
class; 
your 
example 
will 
do 
good. 
We 
walked 
with 
her 
till 
we 
reached 
the 
school, 
and 
because 
we 
were 
there 
we 
could 
not 
kiss 
her 
hand 
but 
Hella 
said 
out 
loud: 
How 
sweet 
you 
are! 
She 
must 
have 
heard 
it. 
But 
Sch. 
was 
not 
at 
school. 
Father 
says 
he's 
glad 
that 
the 
term 
is 
nearly 
over, 
for 
I 
have 
been 
quite 
crazy 
about 
this 
affair. 
Still, 
he 
thinks 
that 
Hella 
and 
I 
should 
talk 
to 
Sch. 
So 
does 
Mother. 
But 
Dora 
said: 
Yes 
that's 
all 
right 
but 
you 
must 
not 
go 
too 
far. 


July 
5th. 
Sch. 
was 
not 
at 
school 
to-day. 
To-morrow 
we 
are 
to 
get 
our 
reports. 


July 
6th. 
We 
cried 
like 
anything 
I 
and 
Hella 
and 
Verbenowitsch 
because 
we 
shan't 
see 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
any 
more 
for 
nearly 
3 
months. 
I 
only 
had 
2 
in 
History 
and 
Natural 
History, 
but 
1 
in 
everything 
else. 
Franke 
says: 
Anyone 
who 
is 
not 
in 
Professor 
Igel-Nigl's 
good 
books 
can 
find 
out 
that 
he's 
cranky 
and 
stupid 
and 
he 
could 
never 
get 
a 
one. 
Father 
is 
quite 
pleased. 
Of 
course 
Dora 
has 
got 
only 
ones 
and 
Hella 
has 
three 
twos. 
Lizzi, 
I 
think, 
has 
3 
or 
4. 
Father 
has 
given 
each 
of 
us 
a 
2 
crown 
piece, 
we 
can 
blow 
it, 
he 
says 
and 
Mother 
has 
given 
us 
a 
lace 
collar. 


July 
9th. 
We 
are 
going 
to 
Hainfeld 
this 
summer, 
its 
jolly, 
I'm 
awfully 
pleased; 
but 
not 
until 
the 
20th 
because 
Father 
can't 
get 
away 
till 
then 
and 
Mother 
won't 
leave 
Father 
so 
long 
alone. 
It 
is 
only 
a 
few 
days 
anyhow. 
It's 
a 
pity 
Hella's 
gone 
already, 
she 
left 
early 
this 
morning 
for 
Parsch 
near 
Salzburg, 
what 
a 
horrid 
name 
and 
Hella 
too 
doesn't 
like 
saying 
it; 
I 
can't 
think 
how 
anyone 
can 
give 
a 
place 
such 
a 
nasty 
name. 
They 
have 
rented 
a 
house. 


July 
12th. 
It's 
shockingly 
dull. 
Nearly 
every 
day 
I 
have 
a 
quarrel 
with 
Dora 
because 
she's 
so 
conceited 
Oswald 
came 
home 
yesterday. 
He's 
fearfully 
smart 
nearly 
as 
tall 
as 
Father 
only 
about 
a 
quarter 
head 
shorter, 
but 
then 
Father's 
tremendously 
tall. 
And 
his 
voice 
is 
quite 
deep, 
it 
was 
not 
before. 
And 
he 
has 
parted 
his 
hair 
on 
one 
side, 
it 
suits 
him 
very 
well. 
He 
says 
his 
moustache 
is 
growing 
already 
but 
it 
isn't; 
one 
could 
see 
it 
if 
it 
were; 
five 
hairs 
don't 
make 
a 
moustache. 



July 
19th. 
Thank 
goodness 
we're 
going 
at 
last 
the 
day 
after 
to-morrow. 
Father 
wanted 
Mother 
to 
go 
away 
with 
us 
earlier, 
but 
she 
would 
not. 
It 
would 
have 
been 
nicer 
if 
she 
had. 


July 
24th. 
Our 
house 
is 
only 
3 
doors 
away 
from 
the 
Hs. 
Ada 
and 
I 
spend 
the 
whole 
day 
together. 
There 
happens 
to 
be 
a 
schoolfellow 
of 
Dora's 
here, 
one 
she 
gets 
on 
with 
quite 
well, 
Rosa 
Tilofsky 
Oswald 
says 
that 
Hainfeld 
bores 
him 
to 
death 
and 
that 
he 
shall 
get 
a 
friend 
to 
invite 
him 
somewhere. 
Nothing 
will 
induce 
him 
to 
spend 
the 
whole 
holidays 
here. 
His 
name 
for 
Ada 
is: 
"Country 
Simplicity." 
If 
he 
only 
knew 
how 
much 
she 
knows. 
Rosa 
T. 
he 
calls 
a 
"Pimple 
Complex" 
because 
she 
has 
two 
or 
three 
pimples. 
Oswald 
has 
some 
fault 
to 
find 
with 
every 
girl 
he 
comes 
across. 
He 
says 
of 
Dora: 
She 
is 
a 
green 
frog, 
for 
she 
always 
looks 
so 
pale 
and 
has 
cold 
hands, 
and 
he 
says 
of 
me: 
You 
can't 
say 
anything 
about 
her 
yet: 
"She 
is 
still 
nothing 
but 
an 
unripe 
embryo." 
Thank 
goodness 
I 
know 
from 
the 
natural 
history 
lessons 
what 
an 
embryo 
is, 
a 
little 
frog; 
"I 
got 
in 
a 
frightful 
wax 
and 
Father 
said: 
Don't 
you 
worry, 
he's 
still 
a 
long 
way 
from 
being 
a 
man 
or 
he 
would 
be 
more 
polite 
to 
his 
sisters 
and 
their 
lady 
friends." 
This 
annoyed 
him 
frightfully, 
and 
since 
then 
he 
never 
says 
a 
word 
when 
Ada 
and 
Rosa 
are 
with 
us. 
My 
birthday 
is 
coming 
soon, 
thank 
goodness 
I 
shall 
be 
12 
then, 
only 
2 
years 
more 
and 
I 
shall 
be 
14; 
I 
am 
so 
glad. 
Hella 
wrote 
to 
me 
to-day 
for 
the 
second 
time. 
In 
August 
she 
is 
going 
to 
Hungary 
to 
stay 
with 
her 
uncle, 
he 
has 
a 
great 
estate 
and 
she 
will 
learn 
to 
ride 
there. 



SECOND 
YEAR 
AGE 
TWELVE 
TO 
THIRTEEN 


SECOND 
YEAR 


August 
1st. 
It 
was 
awfully 
jolly 
on 
my 
birthday. 
We 
drove 
to 
Glashutte 
where 
it 
is 
lovely; 
there 
we 
cooked 
our 
own 
dinner 
in 
the 
inn 
for 
the 
landlady 
was 
ill 
and 
so 
was 
the 
cook. 
On 
one's 
birthday 
everyone 
is 
always 
so 
nice 
to 
one. 
What 
I 
like 
most 
of 
all 
is 
the 
Ebeseder 
paint-box, 
and 
the 
book 
too. 
But 
I 
never 
have 
any 
time 
to 
read. 
Hella 
sent 
me 
a 
lovely 
picture: 
Maternal 
Happiness, 
a 
dachshund 
with 
two 
puppies, 
simply 
sweet. 
When 
I 
go 
home 
I 
shall 
hang 
it 
up 
near 
the 
door 
over 
the 
bookcase. 
Ada 
gave 
me 
a 
silk 
purse 
which 
she 
had 
worked 
for 
me 
herself. 
Aunt 
Dora 
gave 
me 
a 
diary, 
but 
I 
can't 
use 
it 
because 
I 
prefer 
to 
write 
upon 
loose 
sheets. 
Grandfather 
and 
Grandmother 
at 
B. 
sent 
me 
a 
great 
piece 
of 
marzipan, 
splendid. 
Ada 
thinks 
it 
lovely; 
she 
didn't 
know 
marzipan 
before. 


August 
9th. 
When 
it's 
not 
holidays 
Ada 
goes 
to 
school 
in 
St. 
Polten 
staying 
there 
with 
her 
aunt 
and 
uncle, 
because 
the 
school 
in 
H. 
is 
not 
so 
good 
as 
the 
school 
in 
St. 
P. 
Perhaps 
next 
term 
she 
is 
coming 
to 
Vienna, 
for 
she 
has 
finished 
with 
the 
middle 
school 
and 
has 
to 
go 
on 
learning. 
But 
she 
has 
no 
near 
relations 
in 
Vienna 
where 
she 
could 
stay. 
She 
might 
come 
to 
live 
with 
us, 
Dora 
could 
have 
a 
room 
to 
herself 
as 
she 
always 
wants, 
and 
Ada 
and 
I 
could 
share 
a 
room. 
I 
would 
much 
rather 
share 
a 
room 
with 
her 
than 
with 
Dora 
who 
is 
always 
making 
such 
a 
fuss. 


August 
10th. 
I 
do 
really 
think! 
A 
boy 
can 
always 
get 
what 
he 
wants. 
Oswald 
is 
really 
going 
for 
a 
fortnight 
to 
Znaim 
to 
stay 
with 
his 
chum; 
only 
Oswald 
of 
course. 
I 
should 
like 
to 
see 
what 
would 
happen 
if 
Dora 
or 
I 
wanted 
to 
go 
anywhere. 
A 
boy 
has 
a 
fine 
time. 
It's 
the 
injustice 
of 
the 
thing 
which 
makes 
me 
furious. 
For 
we 
know 
for 
certain 
that 
he's 
had 
a 
bad 
report, 
even 
though 
he 
does 
not 
tell 
us 
anything 
about 
it. 
But 
of 
course 
that 
doesn't 
matter. 
They 
throw 
every 
2 
in 
our 
teeth 
and 
when 
he 
gets 
several 
Satisfactories 
he 
can 
go 
wherever 
he 
likes. 
His 
chum 
too; 
he 
only 
got 
to 
know 
Max 
Rozny 
this 
year 



and 
he's 
a 
chum 
already. 
Hella 
and 
I 
have 
been 
chums 
since 
we 
were 
in 
the 
second 
in 
the 
elementary 
school 
and 
Dora 
and 
Frieda 
Ertl 
since 
they 
went 
to 
the 
High 
School. 
We 
both 
gave 
him 
a 
piece 
of 
our 
mind 
about 
friendship. 
He 
laughed 
scornfully 
and 
said: 
That's 
all 
right, 
the 
friendships 
of 
men 
become 
closer 
as 
the 
years 
pass, 
but 
the 
friendships 
of 
you 
girls 
go 
up 
in 
smoke 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
first 
admirer 
turns 
up. 
What 
cheek. 
Whatever 
happens 
Hella 
and 
I 
shall 
stick 
to 
one 
another 
till 
we're 
married, 
for 
we 
want 
to 
be 
married 
on 
the 
same 
day. 
Naturally 
she 
will 
probably 
get 
engaged 
before 
me 
but 
she 
must 
wait 
for 
me 
before 
she's 
married. 
That's 
simply 
her 
duty 
as 
a 
friend. 


August 
12th. 
Oswald 
went 
away 
yesterday 
and 
we 
had 
another 
scene 
just 
before 
he 
left 
because 
he 
wanted 
one 
of 
us 
to 
go 
with 
him 
to 
the 
station 
and 
help 
carry 
his 
luggage. 
As 
if 
we 
were 
his 
servants. 
Ada 
wanted 
to 
volunteer 
to 
carry 
it, 
but 
Dora 
gave 
her 
a 
nudge 
and 
luckily 
she 
understood 
directly. 
Sometimes, 
but 
only 
sometimes, 
when 
Dora 
gets 
in 
a 
wax 
she 
is 
rather 
like 
Hella. 
She 
thinks 
it's 
better 
that 
Oswald 
has 
gone 
away 
because 
otherwise 
there 
are 
always 
rows. 
That's 
because 
she 
always 
comes 
off 
second-best. 
For 
really 
he 
is 
cleverer 
than 
she 
is. 
And 
when 
he 
wants 
to 
make 
her 
really 
angry 
he 
says 
something 
to 
her 
in 
Latin 
which 
she 
can't 
understand. 
I 
think 
that's 
the 
real 
reason 
why 
she's 
learning 
Latin. 
I 
must 
say 
I 
would 
not 
bother 
myself 
so 
about 
a 
thing 
like 
that. 
I 
really 
wouldn't 
bother. 


August 
15th. 
To-day 
I 
posted 
the 
parcel 
to 
Hella, 
a 
silver-wire 
watchchain; 
I 
made 
it 
in 
four 
days. 
I 
hope 
she'll 
get 
it 
safely, 
one 
can 
never 
be 
sure 
in 
Hungary. 


August 
17th. 
We 
are 
so 
frightfully 
busy 
with 
Japanese 
lanterns 
and 
fir 
garlands. 
The 
people 
who 
have 
received 
birthday 
honours 
are 
illuminating 
and 
decorating 
their 
houses. 
While 
we 
were 
at 
work 
Ada 
told 
me 
a 
few 
things. 
She 
knows 
more 
than 
Hella 
and 
me, 
because 
her 
father 
is 
a 
doctor. 
He 
tells 
her 
mother 
a 
good 
deal 
and 
Ada 
overhears 
a 
lot 
of 
things 
though 
they 
generally 
stop 
talking 
when 
she 
comes 
in. 
Ada 
would 
like 
awfully 
to 
be 
an 
actress. 
I 
never 
thought 
of 
such 
a 
thing 
though 
I've 
been 
to 
the 
theatre 
often. 


August 
22nd. 
Hella 
is 
awfully 
pleased 
with 
the 
chain; 
she 
is 
wearing 
it. 
She 
is 
really 
learning 
to 
ride 
at 
her 
cousin's. 
It's 
a 
pity 
he's 
called 
Lajos. 
But 
Ludwig 
is 
not 
any 
better. 
He 
seems 
to 
be 
awfully 
nice 
and 
smart, 
but 
it's 
a 
pity 
he's 
22 
already. 



August 
25th. 
Ada 
is 
frightfully 
keen 
on 
the 
theatre. 
She 
has 
often 
been 
to 
the 
theatre 
in 
St. 
Polten 
and 
she 
is 
in 
love 
with 
an 
actor 
with 
whom 
all 
the 
ladies 
in 
St. 
Polten 
are 
in 
love. 
That 
is 
why 
she 
wants 
to 
be 
an 
actress 
and 
so 
that 
she 
can 
live 
free 
and 
unfettered. 
That 
is 
why 
she 
would 
like 
so 
much 
to 
come 
to 
Vienna. 
I 
wish 
she 
could 
come 
and 
live 
with 
us. 
She 
says 
she 
is 
pining 
away 
in 
H. 
for 
it's 
a 
dull 
hole. 
She 
says 
she 
can't 
stand 
these 
cramping 
conditions. 
In 
St. 
Polten 
she 
spent 
all 
her 
pocket 
money 
upon 
flowers 
for 
him. 
She 
always 
said 
that 
she 
had 
to 
buy 
such 
a 
lot 
of 
copybooks 
and 
things 
for 
school. 
That's 
where 
she's 
lucky 
not 
to 
be 
at 
home, 
for 
I 
could 
not 
easily 
take 
in 
Mother 
like 
that. 
It 
would 
not 
work. 
One 
always 
has 
too 
little 
pocket 
money 
anyhow, 
and 
when 
one 
lives 
at 
home 
one's 
parents 
know 
just 
what 
copybooks 
one 
has. 
I 
should 
like 
to 
go 
away 
from 
home 
for 
a 
few 
months. 
Ada 
says 
it 
is 
very 
good 
for 
one, 
for 
then 
one 
learns 
to 
know 
the 
world; 
at 
home, 
she 
says, 
one 
only 
grows 
musty 
and 
fusty. 
When 
she 
talks 
like 
that 
she 
really 
looks 
like 
an 
actress 
and 
she 
certainly 
has 
talent; 
her 
German 
master 
at 
school 
says 
so 
too. 
She 
can 
recite 
long 
poems 
and 
the 
girls 
are 
always 
asking 
the 
master 
to 
let 
her 
recite. 


August 
30th. 
To-day 
Ada 
recited 
Geibel's 
poem, 
The 
Death 
of 
Tiberius, 
it 
was 
splendid; 
she 
is 
a 
born 
actress 
and 
it's 
a 
horrid 
shame 
she 
can't 
go 
on 
the 
stage; 
she 
is 
to 
teach 
French 
or 
sewing. 
But 
she 
says 
she's 
going 
on 
the 
stage; 
I 
expect 
she 
will 
get 
her 
way 
somehow. 


August 
31st. 
Oswald's 
having 
a 
fine 
long 
fortnight; 
he's 
still 
there 
and 
can 
stay 
till 
September 
4th!! 
If 
it 
had 
been 
Dora 
or 
me. 
There 
would 
have 
been 
a 
frightful 
hulabaloo. 
But 
Oswald 
may 
do 
anything. 
Ada 
says: 
We 
girls 
must 
take 
for 
ourselves 
what 
the 
world 
won't 
give 
us 
of 
its 
own 
free 
will. 


September 
5th. 
In 
the 
forest 
the 
other 
day 
I 
promised 
Ada 
to 
ask 
Mother 
to 
let 
her 
come 
and 
stay 
with 
us 
so 
that 
she 
could 
be 
trained 
for 
the 
stage. 
I 
asked 
Mother 
to-day, 
but 
she 
said 
it 
was 
quite 
out 
of 
the 
question. 
Ada's 
parents 
simply 
could 
not 
afford 
it. 
If 
she 
has 
talent, 
the 
thing 
comes 
of 
itself 
and 
she 
need 
only 
go 
to 
a 
school 
of 
Dramatic 
Art 
so 
that 
she 
could 
more 
easily 
get 
a 
good 
Theatre 
says 
Ada. 
So 
I 
don't 
see 
why 
it 
should 
be 
so 
frightfully 
expensive. 
I'm 
awfully 
sorry 
for 
Ada. 


September 
10th. 
Oh 
we 
have 
all 
been 
so 
excited. 
I've 
got 
to 
pack 
up 
my 
diary 



because 
we're 
going 
home 
to-morrow. 
I 
must 
write 
as 
quickly 
as 
I 
can. 
There 
have 
been 
some 
gypsies 
here 
for 
three 
days, 
and 
yesterday 
one 
of 
the 
women 
came 
into 
the 
garden 
through 
the 
back 
gate 
and 
looked 
at 
our 
hands 
and 
told 
our 
fortunes, 
mine 
and 
Ada's 
and 
Dora's. 
Of 
course 
we 
don't 
believe 
it, 
but 
she 
told 
Ada 
that 
she 
would 
have 
a 
great 
but 
short 
career 
after 
many 
difficult 
struggles. 
That 
fits 
in 
perfectly. 
But 
she 
made 
a 
frightful 
mess 
of 
it 
with 
me: 
Great 
happiness 
awaits 
me 
when 
I 
am 
as 
old 
again 
as 
I 
am 
now; 
a 
great 
passion 
and 
great 
wealth. 
Of 
course 
that 
must 
mean 
that 
I 
am 
to 
marry 
at 
24. 
At 
24! 
How 
absurd! 
Dora 
says 
that 
I 
look 
much 
younger 
than 
12 
so 
that 
she 
meant 
20 
or 
even 
18. 
But 
that's 
just 
as 
silly, 
for 
Dr. 
H., 
who 
is 
a 
doctor 
and 
knows 
so 
many 
girls, 
says 
I 
look 
older 
than 
my 
age. 
So 
that 
it's 
impossible 
that 
the 
old 
gypsy 
woman 
could 
have 
thought 
I 
was 
only 
10 
or 
even 
9. 
Dora's 
fortune 
was 
that 
in 
a 
few 
years 
she 
was 
to 
have 
much 
trouble 
and 
then 
happiness. 
And 
she 
told 
Ada 
that 
her 
line 
of 
life 
was 
broken!! 


September 
14th. 
Oswald 
left 
early 
this 
morning, 
Father 
kissed 
him 
on 
both 
cheeks 
and 
said: 
For 
God's 
sake 
be 
a 
good 
chap 
this 
last 
year 
at 
school. 
He 
has 
to 
matriculate 
this 
year, 
it's 
frightfully 
difficult. 
But 
he 
says 
that 
anyone 
who 
has 
cheek 
enough 
can 
get 
through 
all 
right. 
He 
says 
that 
cheek 
is 
often 
more 
help 
than 
a 
lot 
of 
swoting 
and 
grinding. 
I 
know 
he's 
right; 
but 
unfortunately 
at 
the 
moment 
it 
never 
occurs 
to 
me 
what 
I 
ought 
to 
do. 
I 
often 
think 
afterwards, 
you 
ought 
to 
have 
said 
this 
or 
that. 
Hella 
is 
really 
wonderful; 
and 
Franke 
too, 
though 
she's 
not 
particularly 
clever, 
can 
always 
make 
a 
smart 
answer. 
If 
only 
half 
of 
what 
Oswald 
says 
he 
says 
to 
the 
professors 
is 
true, 
then 
I 
can't 
understand 
why 
he 
is 
not 
expelled 
from 
every 
Gym. 
says 
Mother. 
Oswald 
says: 
If 
one 
only 
puts 
it 
in 
the 
right 
way 
no 
one 
can 
say 
anything. 
But 
that 
doesn't 
hold 
always. 


September 
16th. 
Hella 
is 
coming 
back 
to-day. 
That's 
why 
I'm 
writing 
in 
the 
morning, 
because 
she's 
coming 
here 
in 
the 
afternoon. 
I'm 
awfully 
glad. 
I 
have 
begged 
Mother 
to 
buy 
a 
lovely 
cake, 
one 
of 
the 
kind 
Hella 
and 
I 
are 
both 
so 
fond 
of. 


September 
20th. 
Only 
a 
word 
or 
two. 
School 
began 
again 
to-day. 
Thank 
goodness 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
still 
takes 
our 
class. 
Frl. 
Steiner 
took 
her 
doctor's 
degree 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
school 
year. 
In 
history 
we 
have 
a 
new 
Frau 
Doktor, 
but 
we 
don't 
know 
her 
name 
yet. 
The 
Vischer 
woman 
has 
been 
married 
in 
the 



holidays!!! 
It's 
enough 
to 
make 
one 
split 
with 
laughing 
that 
anyone 
should 
marry 
her!!! 
Dora 
says 
she 
wouldn't 
like 
to 
be 
her 
husband; 
but 
most 
likely 
he 
will 
soon 
get 
a 
divorce. 
Besides, 
spectacles 
in 
a 
woman 
are 
awful. 
I 
can 
put 
up 
with 
a 
pincenez 
for 
one 
does 
not 
wear 
them 
all 
the 
time. 
But 
spectacles! 
Dora 
says 
too 
that 
she 
can't 
understand 
how 
a 
man 
can 
marry 
a 
woman 
with 
spectacles. 
Hella 
often 
says 
it 
makes 
her 
feel 
quite 
sick 
when 
Vischer 
glares 
at 
her 
through 
her 
spectacles. 
We 
have 
a 
new 
natural 
history 
professor. 
I'm 
awfully 
glad 
that 
three 
of 
our 
mistresses 
have 
doctors 
degrees 
and 
that 
we 
have 
one 
or 
really 
2 
professors, 
for 
we 
have 
the 
Religionsprofessor 
too. 
In 
the 
Third 
they 
are 
frightfully 
annoyed 
because 
only 
one 
of 
their 
mistresses 
has 
a 
doctor's 
degree. 
Dora 
has 
2 
doctors 
and 
three 
professors. 


September 
25th. 
All 
the 
girls 
are 
madly 
in 
love 
with 
Professor 
Wilke 
the 
natural 
history 
professor. 
Hella 
and 
I 
walked 
behind 
him 
to-day 
all 
the 
way 
home. 
He 
is 
a 
splendid 
looking 
man, 
so 
tall 
that 
his 
head 
nearly 
touches 
the 
lamp 
when 
he 
stands 
up 
quickly, 
and 
a 
splendid 
fair 
beard 
like 
fire 
when 
the 
sun 
shines 
on 
it; 
a 
Sun 
God! 
we 
call 
him 
S. 
G., 
but 
no 
one 
knows 
what 
it 
means 
and 
who 
we 
are 
talking 
about. 


September 
29th. 
Schmolka 
has 
left, 
I 
suppose 
because 
of 
Frl. 
St.'s 
vanity 
bag. 
Two 
other 
girls 
have 
left 
and 
three 
new 
one's 
have 
come, 
but 
neither 
I 
nor 
Hella 
like 
them. 


October 
1st. 
It 
was 
my 
turn 
in 
Natural 
History 
to-day 
I 
worked 
frightfully 
hard 
and 
He 
was 
splendid. 
We 
are 
to 
look 
after 
the 
pictures 
and 
the 
animals 
all 
through 
the 
term. 
How 
jolly. 
Hella 
and 
I 
always 
wear 
the 
same 
coloured 
hair 
ribbons 
and 
in 
the 
Nat. 
Hist. 
lesson 
we 
always 
put 
tissue 
paper 
of 
the 
same 
colour 
on 
the 
desk. 
He 
wants 
us 
to 
keep 
notebooks, 
observations 
on 
Nature. 
We 
have 
bound 
ours 
in 
lilac 
paper, 
exactly 
the 
same 
shade 
as 
his 
necktie. 
On 
Tuesdays 
and 
Fridays 
we 
have 
to 
come 
to 
school 
at 
half 
past 
8 
to 
get 
things 
ready. 
Oh 
how 
happy 
I 
am. 


October 
9th. 
He 
is 
a 
cousin 
of 
our 
gymnastic 
master, 
splendid! 
This 
is 
how 
we 
found 
it 
out. 
We, 
Hella 
and 
I, 
are 
always 
going 
past 
the 
Cafe 
Sick 
because 
he 
always 
has 
his 
afternoon 
coffee 
there. 
And 
on 
Thursday 
when 
we 
passed 
by 
there 
before 
the 
gymnastic 
lesson 
there 
was 
the 
gymnastic 
master 
sitting 
with 
him. 
Of 
course 
we 
bowed 
to 
them 
as 
we 
passed 
and 
in 
the 
gymnastic 



lesson 
Herr 
Baar 
said 
to 
us: 
So 
you 
two 
are 
tormented 
and 
pestered 
by 
my 
cousin 
in 
natural 
history? 
"Pestered" 
we 
said, 
o 
no, 
it's 
the 
most 
delightful 
lesson 
in 
the 
whole 
week. 
"Is 
that 
so?" 
said 
he, 
"I 
won't 
forget 
to 
let 
him 
know." 
Of 
course 
we 
begged 
and 
prayed 
him 
not 
to 
give 
us 
away, 
saying 
it 
would 
be 
awful. 
But 
we 
do 
hope 
he 
will. 


October 
20th. 
Frau 
Doktor 
Steiner's 
mother 
is 
dead. 
We 
are 
so 
sorry 
for 
her. 
Some 
of 
us 
are 
going 
to 
the 
funeral, 
I 
mayn't 
go, 
Mother 
says 
it 
is 
not 
suitable, 
and 
Hella 
is 
not 
allowed 
to 
go 
either, 
I 
wonder 
if 
He 
will 
go? 
I'm 
sure 
he 
will, 
for 
really 
he 
has 
to. 


October 
23rd. 
Frau 
Doktor 
St. 
looks 
frightfully 
pale. 
Franke 
says 
she 
will 
certainly 
get 
married 
soon 
now 
that 
both 
her 
parents 
are 
dead. 
Her 
fiance 
often 
fetches 
her 
from 
the 
Lyz, 
I 
mean 
he 
waits 
for 
her 
in 
L. 
Street. 
Hella 
thinks 
an 
awful 
lot 
of 
him 
of 
course, 
because 
he's 
an 
officer. 
I 
don't 
think 
much 
of 
him 
myself, 
he's 
too 
short 
and 
too 
fat. 
He's 
only 
a 
very 
little 
taller 
than 
Frl. 
St. 
I 
think 
a 
husband 
should 
be 
nearly 
a 
head 
taller 
than 
his 
wife, 
or 
at 
least 
half 
a 
head 
taller, 
like 
our 
Father 
and 
Mother. 


October 
29th. 
We 
have 
such 
a 
frightful 
lot 
of 
work 
to 
do 
that 
we're 
not 
taking 
season 
tickets 
this 
winter, 
but 
are 
going 
to 
pay 
each 
time 
when 
we 
go 
skating. 
I 
wish 
we 
knew 
whether 
He 
skates, 
and 
where. 
Hella 
thinks 
that 
with 
great 
caution 
we 
might 
find 
out 
from 
his 
cousin 
during 
the 
gymnastic 
lesson. 
They 
are 
often 
together 
in 
the 
Cafe. 
I 
should 
like 
to 
know 
what 
they 
talk 
about, 
they 
are 
always 
laughing 
such 
a 
lot, 
especially 
when 
we 
go 
by. 


October 
31st. 
Ada 
has 
written 
to 
me. 
She 
is 
awfully 
unhappy. 
She 
is 
back 
in 
St. 
P., 
in 
a 
continuation 
school. 
But 
the 
actor 
is 
not 
there 
any 
more. 
She 
writes 
that 
she 
yearns 
to 
throw 
off 
her 
chains 
which 
lie 
heavy 
on 
her 
soul. 
Poor 
darling. 
No 
one 
can 
help 
her. 
That 
is, 
her 
Mother 
could 
help 
her 
but 
she 
won't. 
It 
must 
be 
awful. 
Hella 
thinks 
that 
her 
parents 
will 
not 
allow 
her 
to 
go 
on 
the 
stage 
until 
she 
has 
tried 
to 
do 
herself 
a 
mischief; 
then 
things 
may 
be 
better. 
It's 
quite 
true, 
what 
can 
her 
mother 
be 
thinking 
of 
when 
she 
knows 
how 
fearfully 
unhappy 
Ada 
is. 
After 
all, 
why 
on 
earth 
shouldn't 
she 
go 
on 
the 
stage 
when 
she 
has 
so 
much 
talent? 
All 
her 
mistresses 
and 
masters 
at 
the 
middle 
school 
praised 
her 
reciting 
tremendously 
and 
one 
of 
them 
said 
in 
so 
many 
words 
that 
she 
had 
great 
dramatic 
talent. 
Masters 
don't 
flatter 
one; 
except 
. 
. 
.; 
first 
of 
all 
He 
is 
not 
just 
an 
ordinary 
master 
but 
a 
professor, 
and 



secondly 
He 
is 
quite, 
quite 
different 
from 
all 
others 
When 
he 
strokes 
his 
beard 
I 
become 
quite 
hot 
and 
cold 
with 
extasy. 
And 
the 
way 
he 
lifts 
up 
his 
coat 
tails 
as 
he 
sits 
down. 
It's 
lovely, 
I 
do 
want 
to 
kiss 
him. 
Hella 
and 
I 
take 
turns 
to 
put 
our 
penholder 
on 
his 
desk 
so 
that 
he 
can 
hallow 
it 
with 
his 
hand 
as 
he 
writes. 
Afterwards 
in 
the 
arithmetic 
lesson 
when 
I 
write 
with 
it, 
I 
keep 
looking 
at 
Hella 
and 
she 
looks 
back 
at 
me 
and 
we 
both 
know 
what 
the 
other 
is 
thinking 
of. 


November 
15th. 
It's 
a 
holiday 
to-day 
so 
at 
last 
I 
can 
write 
once 
more. 
We 
have 
such 
a 
frightful 
lot 
to 
do 
that 
I 
simply 
can't 
manage 
to 
write. 
Besides 
Mother 
is 
often 
ill. 
She 
has 
been 
laid 
up 
again 
for 
the 
last 
4 
days. 
It's 
awfully 
dull 
and 
dreary. 
Of 
course 
I 
had 
time 
to 
write 
those 
days, 
but 
then 
I 
didn't 
want 
to 
write. 
As 
soon 
as 
Mother 
is 
well 
again 
she's 
going 
to 
the 
Lyz 
to 
ask 
how 
we 
are 
getting 
on 
I'm 
awfully 
glad 
because 
of 
S.G. 


November 
28th. 
Mother 
came 
to 
school 
to-day 
and 
saw 
him 
too. 
I 
took 
her 
to 
him 
and 
he 
was 
heavenly. 
He 
said: 
I 
am 
very 
pleased 
with 
your 
daughter; 
she's 
very 
keen 
and 
clever. 
Then 
he 
turned 
over 
the 
pages 
of 
his 
notebook 
as 
if 
to 
look 
at 
his 
notes. 
But 
really 
he 
knows 
by 
heart 
how 
we 
all 
work. 
That 
is 
not 
all 
of 
course. 
That 
would 
be 
impossible 
with 
so 
many 
girls; 
and 
he 
teaches 
in 
the 
science 
school 
as 
well 
where 
there 
are 
even 
more 
boys 
than 
we 
are. 


December 
5th. 
Skating 
to-day 
I 
saw 
the 
Gold 
Fairy. 
She 
is 
awfully 
pretty, 
but 
I 
really 
don't 
think 
her 
so 
lovely 
as 
I 
did 
last 
year. 
Hella 
says 
she 
never 
could 
think 
what 
had 
happened 
to 
my 
eyes. 
"You 
were 
madly 
in 
love 
with 
her 
and 
you 
never 
noticed 
that 
she 
has 
a 
typical 
Bohemian 
nose," 
said 
Hella. 
Of 
course 
that's 
not 
true, 
but 
now 
my 
taste 
is 
quite 
different. 
Still, 
I 
said 
how 
d'you 
do 
to 
her 
and 
she 
was 
very 
nice. 
When 
she 
speaks 
she 
is 
really 
charming, 
and 
I 
do 
love 
her 
gold 
stoppings. 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
has 
two 
too 
and 
when 
she 
laughs 
its 
heavenly. 


December 
8th. 
I 
do 
wish 
Dora 
would 
keep 
her 
silly 
jokes 
to 
herself. 
When 
the 
Trobisch's 
were 
all 
here 
to-day 
they 
were 
talking 
about 
the 
school 
and 
she 
said: 
"Gretl 
has 
a 
fresh 
enthusiasm 
each 
year; 
last 
year 
it 
was 
Frau 
Doktor 
Malburg 
and 
this 
year 
it's 
Professor 
Wilke. 
Frau 
Doktor 
Malburg 
has 
fallen 
from 
grace 
now." 
If 
I 
had 
wanted 
to 
I 
could 
have 
begun 
about 
the 
two 
students 
on 
the 
ice. 
But 
I'm 
not 
like 
that 
so 
I 
merely 
looked 
at 
her 
with 



contempt 
and 
gave 
her 
a 
kick 
under 
the 
table. 
And 
she 
had 
the 
cheek 
to 
say: 
What's 
the 
matter? 
Oh, 
of 
course 
these 
tender 
secrets 
of 
the 
heart 
must 
not 
be 
disclosed. 
Never 
mind 
Gretl, 
it 
does 
not 
matter 
at 
your 
age, 
for 
things 
don't 
cut 
deep." 
But 
she 
was 
rightly 
paid 
out: 
Frau 
von 
Tr. 
and 
Father 
roared 
with 
laughter 
and 
Frau 
v. 
Tr. 
said: 
"Why, 
grandmother, 
have 
you 
been 
looking 
at 
your 
white 
hair 
in 
the 
glass?" 
Oh, 
how 
I 
did 
laugh, 
and 
she 
was 
so 
frightfully 
put 
out 
that 
she 
blushed 
like 
fire, 
and 
in 
the 
evening 
she 
said 
to 
me 
that 
I 
was 
an 
ill-mannered 
pig. 
That's 
why 
I 
did 
not 
tell 
her 
that 
she'd 
left 
her 
composition 
book 
on 
the 
table 
and 
to-morrow 
she 
has 
to 
give 
it 
in. 
It's 
all 
the 
same 
to 
me, 
for 
I'm 
an 
ill-mannered 
pig. 


December 
9th. 
It's 
awful. 
At 
2 
o'clock 
this 
afternoon 
Hella 
was 
taken 
to 
the 
Low 
sanatorium 
and 
was 
operated 
on 
at 
once. 
Appendicitis. 
Her 
mother 
has 
just 
telephoned 
that 
the 
operation 
has 
been 
successful. 
But 
the 
doctors 
said 
that 
2 
hours 
later 
it 
would 
have 
been 
too 
late. 
My 
knees 
are 
trembling 
and 
my 
hand 
shakes 
as 
I 
write. 
She 
has 
not 
slept 
off 
the 
anisthetic 
yet. 


December 
10th. 
Hella 
is 
frightfully 
weak; 
no 
one 
can 
see 
her 
except 
her 
father 
and 
mother, 
not 
even 
Lizzi. 
On 
St. 
Nicholas 
Day 
we 
had 
such 
a 
jolly 
time 
and 
ate 
such 
a 
lot 
of 
sweets 
that 
we 
almost 
made 
ourselves 
sick. 
But 
its 
impossible 
that 
she 
got 
appendicitis 
from 
that. 
On 
Monday 
evening, 
when 
we 
were 
going 
home 
after 
the 
gym 
lesson, 
she 
said 
she 
did 
not 
feel 
at 
all 
well. 
The 
night 
before 
last 
she 
had 
a 
rigor 
and 
the 
first 
thing 
in 
the 
morning 
the 
doctor 
said 
that 
she 
must 
go 
to 
hospital 
at 
once 
for 
an 
operation. 


December 
11th. 
All 
the 
girls 
at 
school 
are 
frightfully 
excited 
about 
Hella, 
and 
Frau 
Dr. 
St. 
was 
awfully 
nice 
and 
put 
off 
mathematics 
till 
next 
Tuesday. 
On 
Sunday 
I 
am 
going 
to 
see 
Hella. 
She 
does 
want 
to 
see 
me 
so 
and 
so 
do 
I 
want 
to 
see 
her. 


December 
12th. 
She 
is 
still 
very 
weak 
and 
doesn't 
care 
about 
anything; 
I 
got 
her 
mother 
to 
take 
some 
roses 
and 
violets 
from 
me, 
she 
did 
like 
them 
so 
much. 


December 
14th. 
This 
afternoon 
I 
was 
with 
Hella 
from 
two 
until 
a 
quarter 
to 
4. 
She 
is 
so 
pale 
and 
when 
I 
came 
in 
we 
both 
cried 
such 
a 
lot. 
I 
brought 
her 
some 
more 
flowers 
and 
I 
told 
her 
directly 
that 
when 
he 
sees 
me 
Prof. 
W. 
always 
asks 
after 
her. 
So 
do 
the 
other 
members 
of 
the 
staff 
especially 
Frau 



Doktor 
M. 
The 
girls 
want 
to 
visit 
her 
but 
her 
mother 
won't 
let 
them. 
When 
anyone 
is 
lying 
in 
bed 
they 
look 
quite 
different, 
like 
strangers. 
I 
said 
so 
to 
Hella, 
and 
she 
said: 
We 
can 
never 
be 
strangers 
to 
one 
another, 
not 
even 
in 
death. 
Then 
I 
burst 
out 
crying 
again 
and 
both 
our 
mothers 
said 
I 
must 
go 
away 
because 
it 
was 
too 
exciting 
for 
Hella. 


December 
15th. 
I 
was 
with 
Hella 
again 
to-day. 
She 
passed 
me 
a 
little 
note 
asking 
me 
to 
get 
from 
her 
locker 
the 
parcel 
with 
the 
blotting-book 
for 
her 
father 
and 
the 
key 
basket 
for 
her 
mother 
and 
bring 
it 
to 
her 
because 
the 
things 
are 
not 
ready 
yet 
for 
Christmas. 


December 
16th. 
Hella's 
better 
to-day. 
I've 
got 
to 
paint 
the 
blotting-book 
for 
her 
father. 
Thank 
goodness 
I 
can. 
She'll 
be 
able 
to 
finish 
the 
key 
basket 
herself, 
that's 
nothing. 


December 
18th. 
The 
Bruckners 
are 
all 
frightfully 
unhappy 
for 
it 
won't 
be 
a 
real 
Christmas 
if 
Hella 
has 
to 
stay 
in 
hospital 
over 
Christmas. 
But 
perhaps 
she 
will 
for 
since 
yesterday 
she 
has 
not 
been 
so 
well, 
the 
doctors 
can't 
make 
out 
why 
she 
suddenly 
had 
fever 
once 
more. 
For 
she 
didn't 
let 
on 
that 
I 
had 
brought 
her 
some 
burnt 
almonds 
because 
she's 
so 
awfully 
fond 
of 
them. 
But 
now 
I'm 
so 
terribly 
frightened 
that 
she'll 
have 
to 
have 
another 
operation. 


December 
19th. 
Directly 
after 
school 
I 
went 
to 
see 
Hella 
again 
for 
I 
had 
been 
so 
anxious 
I 
could 
not 
sleep 
all 
night. 
Thank 
goodness 
she's 
better. 
One 
of 
the 
doctors 
said 
that 
if 
she'd 
been 
in 
a 
private 
house 
he 
would 
have 
felt 
sure 
it 
was 
an 
error 
in 
diet, 
but 
since 
she 
was 
in 
hospital 
that 
could 
be 
excluded. 
So 
it 
was 
from 
the 
burnt 
almonds 
and 
the 
two 
sticks 
of 
marzipan. 
Hella 
thinks 
it 
was 
the 
marzipan, 
for 
they 
were 
large 
ones 
at 
20 
hellers 
each 
because 
nuts 
lie 
heavy 
on 
the 
stomach. 
She 
had 
a 
pain 
already 
while 
I 
was 
still 
there, 
but 
she 
wouldn't 
say 
anything 
about 
it 
because 
it 
was 
her 
fault 
that 
I'd 
brought 
her 
the 
sweets. 
She 
can 
beg 
as 
much 
as 
she 
likes 
now, 
I 
shan't 
bring 
her 
anything 
but 
flowers, 
and 
they 
can't 
make 
her 
ill. 
Of 
course 
it 
would 
be 
different 
if 
it 
were 
true 
about 
the 
"Vengeance 
of 
Flowers." 
But 
that's 
all 
nonsense, 
and 
besides 
I 
don't 
bring 
any 
strong-scented 
flowers. 


December 
20th. 
I 
am 
so 
glad, 
to-morrow 
or 
Tuesday 
Hella 
can 
come 
home, 
in 
time 
for 
the 
Christmas 
tree. 
Now 
I 
know 
what 
to 
give 
her, 
a 
long 
chair, 
Father 
will 
let 
me, 
for 
I 
have 
not 
enough 
money 
myself 
but 
Father 
will 
give 



me 
as 
much 
as 
I 
want. 
Oh 
there's 
no 
one 
like 
Father! 
To-morrow 
he's 
going 
to 
take 
me 
to 
the 
Wahringerstrasse 
to 
buy 
one. 


December 
21st. 
I 
was 
only 
a 
very 
short 
time 
with 
Hella 
to-day 
because 
Father 
came 
to 
fetch 
me 
soon. 
At 
first 
she 
was 
a 
little 
hurt, 
but 
then 
she 
saw 
that 
we 
had 
important 
business 
so 
she 
said: 
All 
right 
as 
long 
as 
it 
is 
not 
anything 
made 
of 
marzipan. 
That 
nearly 
gave 
us 
both 
away. 
For 
when 
we 
were 
in 
the 
street 
Father 
asked 
me: 
Why 
did 
Hella 
say 
that 
about 
marzipan? 
So 
I 
said 
quickly: 
Since 
she's 
been 
ill 
she 
has 
a 
perfect 
loathing 
for 
sweets. 
Thank 
goodness 
Father 
didn't 
notice 
anything. 
But 
I 
do 
hate 
having 
to 
tell 
fibs 
to 
Father. 
First 
of 
all 
I 
always 
feel 
that 
he'll 
see 
through 
it, 
and 
secondly 
anyhow 
I 
don't 
like 
telling 
fibs 
to 
him. 
The 
couch 
is 
lovely, 
a 
Turkish 
pattern 
with 
long 
tassels 
on 
the 
round 
bolster. 
Father 
wanted 
to 
pay 
for 
it 
altogether, 
but 
I 
said: 
No, 
then 
it 
would 
not 
be 
my 
present, 
and 
so 
I 
paid 
five 
crowns 
and 
Father 
37. 
To-morrow 
early 
it 
will 
be 
sent 
to 
the 
Bruckners. 


December 
22nd. 
Hella 
is 
going 
home 
to-morrow. 
She 
has 
already 
been 
up 
a 
little, 
but 
she 
is 
still 
so 
weak 
that 
she 
has 
to 
lean 
on 
someone 
when 
she 
walks. 
She 
is 
awfully 
glad 
she 
is 
going 
home, 
for 
she 
says 
in 
a 
hospital 
one 
always 
feels 
as 
if 
one 
was 
going 
to 
die. 
She's 
quite 
right. 
The 
first 
time 
I 
went 
to 
see 
her 
I 
nearly 
burst 
out 
crying 
on 
the 
stairs. 
And 
afterwards 
we 
both 
really 
did 
cry 
frightfully. 
Her 
mother 
knows 
about 
the 
couch, 
but 
it 
has 
not 
been 
sent 
yet. 
I 
do 
hope 
they 
won't 
forget 
about 
it 
at 
the 
shop. 


December 
23rd. 
Hella 
went 
home 
to-day. 
Her 
father 
carried 
her 
upstairs 
while 
I 
held 
her 
hand. 
The 
two 
tenants 
in 
the 
mezzanin 
came 
out 
to 
congratulate 
her 
and 
the 
old 
privy 
councillor 
on 
the 
second 
story 
and 
his 
wife 
sent 
down 
a 
great 
pot 
of 
lilac. 
She 
was 
so 
tired 
that 
I 
came 
away 
at 
5 
o'clock 
so 
that 
she 
could 
rest. 
To-morrow 
I'm 
going 
to 
their 
Christmas 
tree 
first 
and 
then 
to 
ours. 
Because 
of 
Hella 
the 
Br's 
are 
going 
to 
have 
the 
present 
giving 
at 
5 
o'clock, 
we 
shall 
have 
ours 
as 
usual 
at 
7. 


December 
26th. 
Yesterday 
and 
the 
day 
before 
I 
simply 
could 
not 
write 
a 
word. 
It 
was 
lovely 
here 
and 
at 
Hella's. 
I 
shan't 
write 
down 
all 
the 
things 
I 
got, 
because 
I've 
no 
time, 
and 
besides 
I 
know 
anyhow. 
Hella 
was 
awfully 
pleased 
with 
the 
couch, 
her 
father 
carried 
her 
into 
the 
room 
and 
laid 
her 
on 
the 
sofa. 
Her 
mother 
cried. 
It 
was 
touching. 
It's 
certainly 
awfully 
nice 
to 
have 
got 
through 
a 
bad 
illness, 
when 
everyone 
takes 
care 
of 
one, 
and 
when 
no 
one 



denies 
you 
the 
first 
place. 
I 
don't 
grudge 
it 
to 
Hella. 
She's 
such 
a 
darling. 
Yesterday 
I 
was 
there 
all 
day, 
and 
after 
dinner, 
when 
she 
had 
to 
go 
to 
sleep, 
she 
said: 
Open 
the 
drawer 
of 
my 
writing-table, 
the 
lowest 
one 
on 
the 
right, 
and 
you'll 
find 
my 
diary 
there 
if 
you 
want 
to 
read 
it. 
I 
shall 
never 
forget 
it! 
It's 
true 
that 
we 
agreed 
we 
would 
let 
one 
another 
read 
our 
diaries, 
but 
we've 
never 
done 
it 
yet; 
after 
all 
we're 
a 
little 
shy 
of 
one 
another, 
and 
besides 
after 
a 
long 
time 
one 
can't 
remember 
exactly 
what 
one 
has 
written. 
What 
she 
writes 
is 
always 
quite 
short, 
never 
more 
than 
half 
a 
page, 
but 
what 
she 
writes 
is 
always 
important. 
Of 
course 
she 
couldn't 
sleep 
but 
instead 
I 
had 
to 
read 
her 
a 
lot 
of 
things 
out 
of 
her 
diary, 
especially 
the 
holidays 
when 
she 
was 
in 
Hungary. 
She 
was 
made 
much 
of 
there. 
By 
two 
cadets 
and 
her 
two 
cousins. 
We 
laughed 
so 
madly 
over 
some 
things 
that 
it 
hurt 
Hella's 
wound 
and 
I 
had 
to 
stop 
reading. 


December 
29th. 
We 
were 
put 
in 
such 
a 
frightful 
rage 
yesterday. 
This 
is 
how 
it 
happened. 
It 
is 
a 
long 
time 
since 
we 
both 
gave 
up 
playing 
with 
dolls 
and 
things 
of 
that 
sort 
but 
when 
I 
was 
rummaging 
in 
Hella's 
box 
I 
came 
across 
the 
dolls' 
things; 
they 
were 
quite 
at 
the 
bottom 
where 
Hella 
never 
looked 
at 
them. 
I 
took 
out 
the 
little 
Paris 
model 
and 
she 
said: 
Give 
it 
here 
and 
bring 
all 
the 
things 
that 
belong 
to 
it. 
I 
arranged 
them 
all 
on 
her 
bed 
and 
we 
were 
trying 
all 
sorts 
of 
things. 
Then 
Mother 
and 
Dora 
came. 
When 
they 
came 
in 
Dora 
gave 
such 
a 
spiteful 
look 
and 
said: 
Ah, 
at 
their 
favourite 
occupation: 
look, 
Lizzi, 
their 
cheeks 
are 
quite 
red 
with 
excitement 
over 
their 
play. 
Wasn't 
it 
impertinent. 
We 
playing 
with 
dolls! 
Even 
if 
we 
had 
been, 
what 
business 
was 
it 
of 
hers 
to 
make 
fun 
of 
us? 
Hella 
was 
in 
a 
frightful 
rage 
and 
to-day 
she 
said: 
"One 
is 
never 
safe 
from 
spies; 
please 
put 
all 
those 
things 
away 
in 
the 
box 
so 
that 
I 
shan't 
see 
them 
any 
more." 
It 
really 
is 
too 
stupid 
that 
one 
should 
always 
be 
reproached 
about 
dolls 
as 
if 
it 
was 
something 
disgraceful. 
After 
all, 
one 
doesn't 
really 
understand 
until 
later 
how 
all 
the 
things 
are 
made; 
when 
one 
is 
7 
or 
8 
or 
still 
more 
when 
one 
is 
quite 
a 
little 
girl 
and 
one 
first 
gets 
dolls, 
one 
does 
not 
understand 
whether 
they 
are 
pretty 
and 
nicely 
dressed 
or 
not. 
Still, 
to-day 
we've 
done 
with 
dolls 
for 
ever. 
A 
good 
day 
to 
turn 
over 
a 
new 
leaf, 
for 
the 
day 
after 
to-morrow 
is 
New 
Year's 
Day. 


But 
what 
annoys 
me 
most 
of 
all 
was 
this 
piece 
of 
cheek 
of 
Dora's; 
she 
says 
that 
Lizzi 
said: 
"We 
used 
to 
delight 
in 
those 
things 
at 
one 
time," 
but 
I 
was 
in 
such 
a 
rage 
that 
I 
did 
not 
hear 
it. 
But 
to 
eat 
all 
the 
best 
things 
off 
the 



Christmas 
tree 
on 
the 
sly!!! 
I 
saw 
it 
myself, 
that 
is 
nothing. 
That's 
quite 
fit 
and 
proper 
for 
a 
girl 
of 
15. 
After 
supper 
yesterday 
I 
asked: 
But 
what's 
become 
of 
the 
second 
marzipan 
sandwich, 
I'm 
sure 
there 
were 
two 
on 
the 
tree. 
And 
I 
looked 
at 
her 
steadily 
till 
she 
got 
quite 
red. 
And 
after 
a 
time 
I 
said: 
the 
big 
basket 
of 
vegetables 
is 
gone 
too. 
Then 
she 
said. 
Yes, 
I 
took 
it, 
I 
don't 
need 
to 
ask 
your 
permission. 
As 
for 
the 
sandwich, 
Oswald 
took 
that. 
I 
was 
in 
such 
a 
temper, 
and 
then 
Father 
said: 
Come, 
come, 
you 
little 
witch, 
cool 
your 
wrath 
with 
the 
second 
sandwich 
and 
wash 
it 
down 
with 
a 
sip 
of 
liqueur. 
For 
Grandfather 
sent 
Father 
a 
bottle 
of 
liqueur. 


December 
30th. 
This 
is 
a 
fine 
ending 
to 
the 
year. 
I've 
no 
interest 
in 
the 
school 
any 
longer. 
We're 
silly 
little 
fools, 
love-sick 
and 
forward 
minxes. 
That's 
all 
the 
thanks 
we 
get 
for 
having 
gone 
every 
Tuesday 
and 
Friday 
to 
the 
school 
at 
half 
past 
8 
to 
arrange 
everything 
and 
dust 
everything 
and 
then 
he 
can 
say 
a 
thing 
like 
that. 
I 
shall 
never 
write 
he 
with 
a 
big 
h 
again; 
he 
is 
not 
worthy 
of 
it. 
And 
I 
had 
to 
swallow 
it 
all, 
choke 
it 
down, 
for 
I 
simply 
must 
not 
excite 
Hella. 
It 
made 
me 
frightfully 
angry 
when 
Mother 
told 
me, 
but 
still 
I'm 
glad 
for 
I 
know 
what 
line 
to 
take 
now. 
Mother 
was 
paying 
a 
call 
yesterday 
and 
the 
sister 
of 
our 
gymnastic 
master, 
who 
is 
at 
the 
----High 
School, 
happened 
to 
be 
there, 
and 
she 
told 
Mother 
that 
her 
cousin 
Dr. 
W. 
is 
so 
much 
annoyed 
because 
the 
girls 
in 
the 
high 
school 
are 
so 
forward. 
Such 
silly 
little 
fools, 
and 
the 
little 
minxes 
begin 
it 
already 
in 
the 
First 
Class. 
For 
that 
reason 
he 
prefers 
to 
teach 
boys, 
they 
are 
fond 
of 
him 
too 
but 
they 
don't 
make 
themselves 
such 
an 
infernal 
nuisance. 
Well, 
now 
that 
I 
know 
I 
shant 
make 
myself 
a 
nuisance 
to 
him 
any 
more. 
On 
Friday, 
when 
the 
next 
lesson 
is, 
I 
shall 
go 
there 
2 
minutes 
before 
nine 
and 
take 
the 
things 
into 
the 
class-room 
without 
saying 
a 
word. 
And 
I 
shall 
tell 
Kalinsky 
too 
that 
we're 
such 
an 
infernal 
nuisance 
to 
him. 
Just 
fancy, 
as 
if 
we 
were 
in 
the 
First 
Class! 


January 
1st, 
19--. 
This 
business 
with 
Prof. 
W. 
makes 
me 
perfectly 
furious. 
Hella 
kept 
on 
asking 
yesterday 
what 
was 
the 
matter, 
said 
I 
seemed 
different 
somehow. 
But 
thank 
goodness 
I 
was 
able 
to 
keep 
it 
in. 
I 
must 
keep 
it 
in 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
her 
health, 
even 
if 
it 
makes 
me 
ill. 
Anyway 
what 
use 
is 
life 
now. 
Since 
people 
are 
so 
falsehearted. 
He 
always 
looked 
so 
awfully 
nice 
and 
charming; 
when 
I 
think 
of 
the 
way 
in 
which 
he 
asked 
how 
Hella 
was 
and 
all 
the 
time 
he 
was 
so 
false!!! 
If 
Hella 
only 
knew. 
Aha, 
to-morrow! 



January 
2nd. 
I 
treated 
him 
abominably. 
Knocked 
at 
the 
door--Good-morning, 
Herr 
Prof. 
please 
what 
do 
we 
want 
for 
the 
lesson 
to-day? 
He 
very 
civilly: 
Nothing 
particular 
to-day. 
Well, 
what 
sort 
of 
a 
Christmas 
did 
you 
have--I: 
Thank 
you, 
much 
as 
usual.--He 
turned 
round 
and 
stared 
at 
me: 
It 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
have 
been; 
to 
judge 
from 
your 
manner. 
--I: 
There 
are 
quite 
other 
reasons 
for 
that. 
He: 
O-o-h? 
He 
may 
well 
say 
O-o-h! 
For 
he 
has 
not 
the 
least 
idea 
that 
I 
know 
the 
way 
in 
which 
he 
speaks 
of 
us. 


January 
6th. 
To-day 
Hella 
was 
able 
to 
go 
out 
for 
her 
first 
drive. 
She's 
much 
better 
now 
and 
will 
come 
back 
to 
school 
by 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
month. 
I 
must 
tell 
her 
before 
that 
or 
she'll 
get 
a 
shock. 
Yesterday 
she 
asked: 
Does 
not 
S. 
C. 
ask 
about 
me 
any 
more?--Oh 
yes, 
I 
fibbed, 
but 
not 
so 
often 
as 
before. 
And 
she 
said: 
That's 
the 
way 
it 
goes, 
out 
of 
sight 
out 
of 
mind. 
What 
will 
happen 
when 
she 
learns 
the 
truth. 
Anyhow 
I 
shan't 
tell 
her 
until 
she's 
quite 
strong. 


January 
10th. 
I've 
had 
to 
tell 
Hella 
already. 
She 
was 
talking 
so 
enthusiastically 
about 
S. 
G. 
At 
first 
I 
said 
nothing. 
And 
then 
she 
said: 
What 
are 
you 
making 
such 
a 
face 
for? 
Are 
not 
you 
allowed 
to 
arrange 
the 
things 
any 
more?--I: 
Allowed? 
Of 
course 
I'm 
allowed, 
but 
I 
don't 
want 
to 
any 
more. 
I 
did 
not 
tell 
Hella 
how 
bad 
I 
feel 
about 
it; 
for 
I 
really 
was 
madly 
in 
love 
with 
him. 


January 
12th. 
Hella 
must 
have 
been 
madly 
in 
love 
with 
him 
too 
or 
rather 
must 
be 
in 
love 
with 
him 
still. 
On 
Sunday 
evening 
she 
was 
so 
much 
upset 
that 
her 
mother 
believed 
she 
was 
going 
to 
have 
a 
relapse. 
She 
had 
pains 
and 
diarrea 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
Thank 
goodness 
she's 
got 
over 
it 
like 
me. 
She 
said 
to-day: 
Don't 
let's 
bother 
ourselves 
about 
it 
any 
more. 
We 
wasted 
our 
feelings 
(not 
love!!) 
on 
an 
unworthy 
object. 
At 
such 
moments 
she 
is 
magnificent, 
especially 
now 
when 
she 
is 
still 
so 
pale. 
Besides 
in 
the 
holidays 
and 
now 
since 
she 
has 
been 
ill 
she 
has 
grown 
tremendously. 
Before 
I 
was 
a 
little 
taller 
and 
now 
she 
is 
a 
quarter 
head 
taller 
than 
me. 
Dora 
is 
frightfully 
annoyed 
because 
I 
am 
nearly 
as 
tall 
as 
she 
is. 
Thank 
goodness 
it 
makes 
me 
look 
older 
than 
12 
1/2. 


Hella 
is 
not 
to 
come 
to 
school 
on 
January 
15th, 
for 
her 
mother 
is 
going 
to 
take 
her 
to 
Tyrol 
for 
2 
or 
3 
weeks. 


January 
18th. 
It's 
horridly 
dull 
with 
Hella 
away. 
Only 
now 
do 
I 
realise, 
since 



her 
illness. 
I 
am 
always 
feeling 
as 
if 
she 
had 
fallen 
ill 
again. 
Her 
mother 
has 
taken 
her 
to 
Meran, 
they 
are 
coming 
back 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
February. 


January 
24th. 
Since 
Hella 
has 
been 
ill, 
that 
is 
really 
since, 
she 
went 
away, 
I 
spend 
most 
of 
my 
time 
with 
Fritzi 
Hubner. 
She's 
awfully 
nice, 
though 
I 
did 
not 
know 
it 
last 
year. 
Till 
Hella 
comes 
back 
she 
and 
I 
sit 
together. 
For 
it's 
horrid 
to 
sit 
alone 
on 
a 
bench 
Fritzi 
knows 
a 
good 
deal 
already. 
She 
would 
not 
talk 
about 
it 
at 
first 
because 
it 
so 
often 
leads 
to 
trouble. 
Her 
brother 
has 
told 
her 
everything. 
He's 
rather 
a 
swell 
and 
is 
called 
Paul. 


January 
29th. 
Yesterday 
was 
the 
ice 
carnival 
and 
Dora 
and 
I 
were 
allowed 
to 
go. 
I 
skated 
with 
Fritzi 
and 
Paul 
most 
of 
the 
time 
and 
won 
2 
prizes, 
one 
of 
them 
with 
Paul. 
And 
one 
of 
them 
skating 
in 
a 
race 
with 
5 
other 
girls. 
Paul 
is 
awfully 
clever, 
he 
says 
he's 
going 
into 
the 
army, 
the 
flying 
corps. 
That's 
even 
more 
select 
than 
being 
on 
the 
general 
staff. 
Her 
father 
is 
a 
major 
and 
he, 
I 
mean 
Paul, 
ought 
to 
have 
gone 
to 
the 
military 
academy, 
but 
his 
grandfather 
would 
not 
allow 
it. 
He 
is 
to 
choose 
for 
himself. 
But 
of 
course 
he 
will 
become 
an 
officer. 
Most 
boys 
want 
to 
be 
what 
their 
father 
is. 
But 
Oswald 
is 
perhaps 
going 
into 
the 
Navy. 
I 
wish 
I 
knew 
what 
Father 
meant 
once 
when 
he 
said 
to 
Mother: 
Good 
God, 
I'm 
not 
doing 
it 
on 
my 
own 
account. 
I'm 
only 
doing 
it 
because 
of 
Oswald. 
The 
two 
girls 
won't 
get 
much 
out 
of 
it. 


February 
3rd. 
I've 
just 
been 
reading 
what 
I 
wrote 
about 
Father. 
I 
am 
wondering 
what 
it 
can 
be. 
I 
think 
that 
Father 
either 
wants 
to 
win 
the 
great 
prize 
in 
the 
lottery 
or 
is 
perhaps 
going 
to 
buy 
a 
house. 
But 
Dora 
and 
I 
would 
get 
something 
out 
of 
that, 
for 
it 
would 
not 
belong 
to 
Oswald 
only. 


February 
4th. 
Yesterday 
I 
asked 
Mother 
about 
it. 
But 
she 
said 
she 
didn't 
know; 
if 
it 
was 
anything 
which 
concerned 
us, 
Father 
would 
tell 
us. 
But 
it 
must 
be 
something, 
or 
Mother 
would 
not 
have 
told 
Father 
in 
the 
evening 
that 
I 
had 
asked. 
I 
can't 
endure 
these 
secrets. 
Why 
shouldn't 
we 
know 
that 
Father's 
going 
to 
buy 
a 
house. 
Fritzi's 
grandfather 
has 
a 
house 
in 
Brunn 
and 
another 
in 
Iglau. 
But 
Fritzi 
is 
very 
simply 
dressed 
and 
her 
mother 
too. 


February 
9th. 
Thank 
goodness 
Hella 
is 
coming 
back 
to-morrow, 
just 
before 
her 
birthday. 
Luckily 
she 
can 
eat 
everything 
again 
so 
I 
am 
giving 
her 
a 
huge 
bag 
of 
Viktor 
Schmid's 
sweets 
with 
a 
silver 
sugar 
tongs. 
Mother 
and 
I 
are 
going 
to 
meet 
Hella 
at 
the 
station. 
They 
are 
coming 
by 
the 
8.20. 



February 
10th. 
I 
am 
so 
glad 
Hella 
is 
coming 
to-day. 
I 
nearly 
could 
not 
meet 
her 
because 
Mother 
is 
not 
very 
well 
to-day. 
But 
Father's 
going 
to 
take 
me. 
Fritzi 
wanted 
to 
come 
and 
see 
Hella 
to-morrow 
afternoon, 
but 
she 
can't. 
She's 
an 
awfully 
nice 
girl 
and 
her 
brother 
is 
too, 
but 
on 
the 
first 
day 
Hella 
is 
back 
we 
must 
be 
alone 
together. 
She 
said 
so 
too 
in 
the 
last 
letter 
she 
wrote 
me. 
She's 
been 
away 
more 
than 
3 
weeks. 
It's 
a 
frightfully 
long 
time 
when 
you 
are 
fond 
of 
one 
another. 


February 
15th. 
I 
simply 
can't 
write 
my 
diary 
because 
Hella 
and 
I 
spend 
all 
our 
free 
time 
together. 
Yesterday 
we 
got 
our 
reports. 
Of 
course 
Hella 
has 
not 
got 
one. 
Except 
in 
Geography 
and 
History 
I 
have 
nothing 
but 
Ones, 
even 
in 
Natural 
History 
although 
since 
New 
Year 
I 
have 
not 
done 
any 
work 
in 
that 
subject. 
I 
detest 
Natural 
History. 
When 
Hella 
comes 
back 
to 
school 
we 
are 
going 
to 
ask 
the 
sometime 
S. 
G. 
to 
relieve 
us 
from 
the 
labours 
of 
looking 
after 
the 
things. 
Hella 
is 
still 
too 
weak 
to 
do 
it. 
Hella 
is 
13 
already 
and 
Father 
says 
she 
is 
going 
to 
be 
wonderfully 
pretty. 
Going 
to 
be, 
Father 
says; 
but 
she's 
lovely 
already. 
She's 
been 
burned 
as 
brown 
as 
a 
berry 
by 
the 
warm 
southern 
sun, 
and 
it 
really 
suits 
her, 
though 
only 
her. 
I 
can't 
stand 
other 
people 
when 
they 
are 
sun-burned. 
But 
really 
everything 
suits 
Hella; 
when 
she 
was 
so 
pale 
in 
hospital, 
she 
was 
lovely; 
and 
now 
she 
is 
just 
as 
lovely, 
only 
in 
quite 
a 
different 
way. 
Oswald 
is 
quite 
right 
when 
he 
says: 
You 
can 
measure 
a 
girl's 
beauty 
by 
the 
degree 
in 
which 
she 
bears 
being 
sunburned 
without 
losing 
her 
good 
looks. 
He 
really 
used 
to 
say 
that 
in 
the 
holidays 
simply 
to 
annoy 
Dora 
and 
me, 
but 
he's 
quite 
right 
all 
the 
same. 


February 
20th. 
The 
second 
half-year 
began 
yesterday. 
They 
were 
all 
awfully 
nice 
to 
Hella, 
and 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
stroked 
her 
cheeks 
and 
put 
her 
arm 
round 
her 
so 
affectionately. 
Now 
for 
the 
chief 
thing. 
Today 
was 
the 
Natural 
History 
lesson. 
We 
knocked 
at 
the 
door 
and 
when 
we 
went 
in 
Prof. 
W. 
said: 
Ah 
I'm 
glad 
to 
see 
you 
Bruckner; 
take 
care 
that 
you 
don't 
give 
us 
all 
another 
fright. 
How 
are 
you? 
Hella 
said: 
"Quite 
well, 
thank 
you, 
Herr 
Prof." 
And 
as 
I 
looked 
at 
her 
she 
put 
on 
a 
frightfully 
serious 
face 
and 
he 
said: 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
you've 
caught 
your 
friend's 
ill 
humour.--Hella: 
"Herr 
Prof., 
you 
are 
really 
too 
kind, 
but 
we 
don't 
want 
to 
trouble 
you. 
What 
things 
have 
we 
to 
take 
to 
the 
class-room? 
And 
then 
we 
beg 
leave 
to 
resign 
our 
posts, 
for 
I 
don't 
feel 
strong 
enough 
for 
the 
work." 
She 
said 
this 
in 
quite 
a 
soldierly 
way, 
the 
way 
she 
is 



used 
to 
hear 
her 
father 
speak. 
It 
sounded 
most 
distinguished. 
He 
looked 
at 
us 
and 
said: 
"All 
right, 
two 
of 
the 
other 
pupils 
will 
take 
it 
over." 
We 
don't 
know 
whether 
he 
really 
noticed 
nothing 
or 
simply 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
show 
that 
he 
had 
noticed. 
But 
as 
we 
shut 
the 
door 
I 
felt 
so 
awfully 
sorry; 
for 
it 
was 
the 
last 
time, 
the 
very 
last 
time. 


February 
27th. 
In 
Natural 
History 
to-day 
I 
got 
Unsatisfactory. 
I 
was 
not 
being 
questioned, 
but 
when 
Klaiber 
could 
not 
answer 
anything 
I 
laughed, 
and 
he 
said: 
Very 
well, 
Lainer, 
you 
correct 
her 
mistake. 
But 
since 
I 
had 
been 
thinking 
of 
something 
quite 
different 
I 
did 
not 
know 
what 
it 
was 
all 
about, 
and 
so 
I 
got 
an 
Unsatisfactory. 
Before 
of 
course 
that 
would 
not 
have 
mattered; 
but 
now 
since 
. 
. 
. 
Hella 
and 
Franke 
did 
all 
they 
could 
to 
console 
me 
and 
said: 
"That 
does 
not 
matter, 
it 
wasn't 
an 
examination; 
he'll 
have 
to 
examine 
you 
properly 
later." 
Anyhow 
Franke 
thinks 
that 
however 
hard 
I 
learn, 
I 
shall 
be 
well 
off 
if 
he 
gives 
me 
a 
Satisfactory. 
She 
says 
no 
professor 
can 
forget 
such 
a 
defeat. 
For 
we 
told 
her 
about 
the 
silly 
little 
fools. 
She 
said, 
indeed, 
that 
we 
had 
made 
it 
too 
obvious. 
That's 
not 
really 
true. 
But 
now 
she 
takes 
our 
side, 
for 
she 
sees 
that 
we 
were 
in 
the 
right. 
Verbenowitsch 
and 
Bennari 
bring 
in 
the 
things 
now. 
They 
are 
much 
better 
suited 
for 
it. 
Hella's 
father 
did 
not 
like 
her 
doing 
it 
anyhow; 
he 
says: 
The 
porter 
or 
the 
maidservant 
are 
there 
for 
that--we 
never 
see 
them 
all 
the 
year 
round, 
that's 
a 
fine 
thing. 


March 
8th. 
Easter 
does 
not 
come 
this 
year 
until 
April 
16th. 
I 
am 
going 
with 
the 
Bruckners 
to 
Cilli, 
outside 
the 
town 
there 
they 
have 
a 
vineyard 
with 
a 
country 
house. 
Hella 
needs 
a 
change. 
I 
am 
awfully 
glad. 
All 
the 
flowers 
begin 
to 
come 
out 
there 
at 
the 
end 
of 
March 
or 
beginning 
of 
April. 


March 
12th. 
Hella 
is 
not 
straightforward. 
We 
met 
a 
gentleman 
to-day, 
very 
fashionably 
dressed 
with 
gold-rimmed 
eyeglasses 
and 
a 
fair 
moustache. 
Hella 
blushed 
furiously, 
and 
the 
gentleman 
took 
off 
his 
hat 
and 
said: 
Ah, 
Fraulein 
Helenchen, 
you 
are 
looking 
very 
well. 
How 
are 
you? 
He 
never 
looked 
at 
me, 
and 
when 
he 
had 
gone 
she 
said: 
"That 
was 
Dr. 
Fekete, 
who 
assisted 
at 
my 
operation."--"And 
you 
tell 
me 
that 
now 
for 
the 
first 
time?" 
Then 
she 
put 
on 
an 
innocent 
air 
and 
said: 
"Of 
course, 
we've 
never 
met 
him 
before," 
but 
I 
said: 
"I 
don't 
mean 
that. 
If 
you 
knew 
how 
red 
you 
got 
you 
would 
not 
tell 
me 
a 
lie." 
Then 
she 
said: 
"What 
am 
I 
telling 
you 
a 
lie 
about? 
Do 
you 
think 
I'm 
in 
love 



with 
him? 
Not 
in 
the 
very 
least."--But 
when 
one 
is 
not 
in 
love 
one 
does 
not 
blush 
like 
that. 
Anyhow 
I 
shan't 
tell 
everything 
now 
either; 
I 
can 
hold 
my 
tongue 
too. 


March 
14th. 
Yesterday 
we 
did 
not 
talk 
to 
one 
another 
so 
much 
as 
usual; 
I 
especially 
was 
very 
silent. 
When 
the 
bell 
rang 
at 
5 
and 
I 
had 
just 
been 
doing 
the 
translation 
Hella 
came 
and 
begged 
my 
pardon 
and 
brought 
me 
some 
lovely 
violets, 
so 
of 
course 
I 
forgave 
her. 
This 
is 
really 
the 
first 
time 
we've 
ever 
quarrelled. 
First 
she 
wanted 
to 
bring 
me 
some 
sweets, 
but 
then 
she 
decided 
upon 
violets, 
and 
I 
think 
that 
was 
much 
more 
graceful. 
One 
gives 
sweets 
to 
a 
little 
child 
when 
it 
has 
hurt 
itself 
or 
been 
in 
a 
temper. 
But 
flowers 
are 
not 
for 
a 
child. 


March 
19th. 
Frieda 
Belay 
is 
dead. 
We 
are 
all 
terribly 
upset. 
None 
of 
us 
were 
very 
intimate 
with 
her, 
but 
now 
that 
she 
is 
dead 
we 
all 
remember 
that 
she 
was 
a 
schoolfellow. 
She 
died 
of 
heart 
failure 
following 
rheumatic 
fever. 
We 
all 
attended 
her 
funeral, 
except 
Hella 
who 
was 
not 
allowed 
to 
come. 
Her 
mother 
cried 
like 
anything 
and 
her 
grandmother 
still 
more; 
her 
father 
cried 
too. 
We 
sent 
a 
wreath 
of 
white 
roses 
with 
a 
lovely 
inscription: 
Death 
has 
snatched 
you 
away 
in 
the 
flower 
of 
your 
youth--Your 
Schoolfellows. 


I 
have 
no 
pleasure 
in 
anything 
to-day. 
I 
did 
not 
see 
Frieda 
Belay 
after 
she 
was 
dead, 
but 
Franke 
was 
there 
yesterday 
and 
saw 
her 
in 
her 
coffin. 
She 
says 
she 
will 
never 
forget 
it, 
it 
gave 
her 
such 
a 
pang. 
In 
the 
church 
Lampl 
had 
a 
fit 
of 
hysterics, 
for 
her 
mother 
was 
buried 
only 
a 
month 
ago 
and 
now 
she 
was 
reminded 
of 
it 
all 
and 
was 
frightfully 
upset. 
I 
cried 
a 
lot 
too 
when 
I 
was 
with 
Hella. 
She 
fancied 
it 
was 
because 
I 
was 
thinking 
she 
might 
have 
died 
last 
Dec. 
But 
that 
wasn't 
it, 
I 
don't 
think 
about 
that 
sort 
of 
thing. 
But 
when 
anyone 
dies 
it 
is 
so 
awfully 
sad. 


March 
24th. 
I 
never 
heard 
of 
such 
a 
thing. 
I 
can't 
go 
to 
Cilli 
with 
Hella. 
Her 
mother 
was 
at 
her 
cousin's, 
and 
when 
she 
heard 
that 
she 
was 
going 
to 
Cilli 
at 
Easter 
she 
asked 
her 
to 
take 
Melanie 
with 
her. 
That 
is, 
she 
didn't 
ask 
straight 
out, 
but 
kept 
on 
hinting 
until 
Hella's 
mother 
said: 
Let 
Melanie 
come 
with 
us, 
it 
will 
help 
to 
set 
her 
up 
after 
her 
illness. 
In 
the 
winter 
she 
had 
congestion 
of 
the 
lung. 
Hella 
and 
I 
can't 
bear 
her 
because 
she's 
always 
spying 
on 
us 
and 
is 
so 
utterly 
false. 
So 
of 
course 
I 
can't 
go. 
Hella 
says 
too 
she's 
frightfully 
sorry, 
but 
when 
she 
is 
about 
we 
could 
never 
say 
a 
word 
about 
anything, 
it 
would 



drive 
us 
crazy. 
She 
quite 
agrees 
that 
I 
had 
better 
not 
come. 
But 
oh 
I'm 
so 
annoyed 
for 
first 
of 
all 
I 
do 
so 
like 
going 
away 
with 
Hella 
and 
secondly 
I 
should 
like 
to 
go 
away 
in 
the 
holidays 
anyhow 
for 
nearly 
all 
the 
girls 
in 
our 
class 
are 
going 
away. 
Still, 
there's 
nothing 
to 
be 
done. 
Hella's 
mother 
says 
she 
can't 
see 
why 
we 
can't 
all 
3 
go 
though 
it 
simply 
would 
not 
work. 
But 
we 
can't 
explain 
it 
to 
her. 
Hella 
is 
so 
poetical 
and 
she 
says 
"A 
beautiful 
dream 
vanished." 


In 
Hella's 
mouth 
such 
fine 
words 
sound 
magnificent, 
but 
when 
Dora 
uses 
such 
expressions 
they 
annoy 
me 
frightfully 
because 
they 
don't 
come 
from 
her 
heart. 


March 
26th. 
The 
school 
performances 
finish 
today 
with 
Waves 
of 
the 
Sea 
and 
Waves 
of 
Love. 
I'm 
awfully 
fond 
of 
the 
theatre, 
but 
I 
never 
write 
anything 
about 
that. 
For 
anyhow 
the 
play 
is 
written 
by 
a 
poet 
and 
one 
can 
read 
it 
if 
one 
wants 
to, 
and 
one 
just 
sees 
the 
rest 
anyhow. 
I 
can't 
make 
out 
what 
Dora 
finds 
such 
a 
lot 
to 
scribble 
about 
always 
the 
day 
after 
we've 
been 
to 
the 
theatre. 
I 
expect 
she's 
in 
love 
with 
one 
of 
the 
actors 
and 
that's 
why 
she 
writes 
such 
a 
lot. 
Besides 
we 
in 
the 
second 
class 
did 
not 
get 
tickets 
for 
all 
the 
performances, 
but 
only 
the 
girls 
from 
the 
Fourth 
upwards. 
Still, 
it 
did 
not 
matter 
much 
to 
me 
anyhow 
for 
we 
often 
go 
in 
the 
evening 
and 
on 
Sunday 
afternoons. 
But 
unfortunately 
I 
mayn't 
go 
in 
the 
evening 
as 
a 
rule. 


March 
29th. 
To-day 
something 
horrible 
happened 
to 
Dora 
and 
me. 
I 
simply 
can't 
write 
it 
down. 
She 
was 
awfully 
nice 
and 
said: 
Two 
years 
ago 
on 
the 
Metropolitan 
Railway 
the 
same 
thing 
had 
happened 
when 
she 
was 
travelling 
with 
Mother 
on 
February 
15th, 
she 
can 
never 
forget 
the 
date, 
to 
Hietzing 
to 
see 
Frau 
v. 
Martini. 
Besides 
her 
and 
Mother 
there 
was 
only 
one 
gentleman 
in 
the 
carriage, 
Mother 
always 
travels 
second 
class. 
She 
and 
Mother 
were 
sitting 
together 
and 
the 
gentleman 
was 
standing 
farther 
down 
the 
carriage 
where 
Mother 
could 
not 
see 
him 
but 
Dora 
could. 
And 
as 
Dora 
was 
looking 
he 
opened 
his 
cloak 
and------! 
just 
what 
the 
man 
did 
to-day 
at 
the 
house 
door. 
And 
when 
they 
got 
out 
of 
the 
train 
Dora's 
boa 
got 
stuck 
in 
the 
door 
and 
she 
had 
to 
turn 
round 
though 
she 
did 
not 
want 
to, 
and 
then 
she 
saw 
again------! 
She 
simply 
could 
not 
sleep 
for 
a 
whole 
month 
afterwards. 
I 
remember 
that 
time 
when 
she 
could 
not 
sleep 
but 
I 
did 
not 
know 
why 
it 
was. 
She 
never 
told 
anyone 
except 
Erika 
and 
the 
same 
thing 
happened 
to 
her 
once. 
Dora 
says 
that 



happens 
at 
least 
once 
to 
nearly 
every 
girl; 
and 
that 
such 
men 
are 
"abnormal." 
I 
don't 
really 
know 
what 
that 
means, 
but 
I 
did 
not 
like 
to 
ask. 
Perhaps 
Hella 
will 
know. 
Of 
course 
I 
did 
not 
really 
look, 
but 
Dora 
shivered 
and 
said: 
And 
that 
is 
what 
one 
has 
to 
endure. 
And 
then, 
when 
we 
were 
talking 
it 
over 
she 
said 
to 
me 
that 
that 
was 
why 
Mother 
was 
ill 
and 
because 
she 
has 
had 
five 
children; 
Then 
I 
was 
very 
silly 
and 
said: 
"But 
how 
from 
that?" 
one 
does 
not 
get 
children 
from 
that? 
"Of 
course," 
she 
said 
I 
thought 
you 
knew 
that 
already. 
That 
time 
there 
was 
such 
a 
row 
with 
Mali 
about 
the 
waistband, 
I 
thought 
you 
and 
Hella 
had 
heard 
all 
about 
everything." 
Then 
I 
was 
silly 
again, 
really 
frightfully 
stupid; 
for 
instead 
of 
telling 
her 
what 
I 
really 
knew 
I 
said: 
"Oh, 
yes, 
I 
knew 
all 
about 
it 
except 
just 
that." 
Then 
she 
burst 
out 
laughing 
and 
said: 
"After 
all, 
what 
you 
and 
Hella 
know 
doesn't 
amount 
to 
much." 
And 
in 
the 
end 
she 
told 
me 
a 
little. 
If 
it's 
really 
as 
Dora 
says, 
then 
she 
is 
right 
when 
she 
says 
it 
is 
better 
not 
to 
marry. 
One 
can 
fall 
in 
love, 
one 
must 
fall 
in 
love, 
but 
one 
can 
just 
break 
off 
the 
engagement. 
Well, 
that's 
the 
best 
way 
out 
of 
the 
difficulty 
for 
then 
no 
one 
can 
say 
that 
you've 
never 
had 
a 
man 
in 
love 
with 
you. 
We 
walked 
up 
and 
down 
in 
front 
of 
the 
school 
for 
such 
a 
long 
time 
that 
we 
were 
very 
nearly 
late 
and 
only 
got 
in 
just 
as 
the 
bell 
rang. 
On 
the 
way 
home 
I 
told 
Hella 
the 
awful 
thing 
we'd 
seen 
the 
man 
do. 
She 
does 
not 
know 
either 
what 
"abnormal" 
really 
means 
as 
far 
as 
this 
is 
concerned. 
But 
now 
we 
shall 
use 
it 
as 
an 
expression 
for 
something 
horrible. 
Of 
course 
no 
one 
will 
understand 
us. 
And 
then 
Hella 
told 
me 
about 
a 
drunken 
man 
who 
in 
Nagy 
K. 
. 
. 
. 
was 
walking 
through 
the 
streets 
like 
that 
and 
was 
arrested. 
She 
says 
too 
that 
one 
can 
never 
forget 
seeing 
anything 
like 
that. 
Perhaps 
the 
man 
this 
morning 
was 
drunk 
too. 
But 
he 
didn't 
look 
as 
if 
he 
were 
drunk. 
And 
if 
he 
hadn't 
done 
that 
one 
would 
really 
have 
taken 
him 
for 
a 
fine 
gentleman. 
Hella 
knows 
too 
that 
it 
is 
from 
that 
that 
one 
gets 
children. 
She 
explained 
it 
all 
to 
me 
and 
now 
I 
can 
quite 
understand 
that 
that 
must 
make 
one 
ill. 
Yesterday 
it 
was 
after 
11 
at 
night 
and 
so 
I'm 
finishing 
to-day. 
Hella 
says: 
That 
is 
the 
original 
sin, 
and 
that 
is 
the 
sin 
which 
Adam 
and 
Eve 
committed. 
Before 
I 
had 
always 
believed 
the 
original 
sin 
was 
something 
quite 
different. 
But 
that--that. 
Since 
yesterday 
I've 
been 
so 
upset 
I 
always 
seem 
to 
be 
seeing 
that; 
really 
I 
did 
not 
look 
at 
all, 
but 
I 
must 
have 
seen 
it 
all 
the 
same. 


March 
30th. 
I 
don't 
know 
why, 
but 
in 
the 
history 
lesson 
to-day 
it 
all 
came 
into 
my 
head 
once 
more 
what 
Dora 
had 
said 
of 
Father. 
But 
I 
really 
can't 
believe 
it. 
Because 
of 
Father 
I'm 
really 
sorry 
that 
I 
know 
it. 
Perhaps 
it 
does 
not 
all 



happen 
the 
way 
Dora 
and 
Hella 
say. 
Generally 
I 
can 
trust 
Hella, 
but 
of 
course 
she 
may 
be 
mistaken. 


April 
1st. 
To-day 
Dora 
told 
me 
a 
lot 
more. 
She 
is 
quite 
different 
now 
from 
what 
she 
used 
to 
be. 
One 
does 
not 
say 
P[eriod], 
but 
M[enstruation]. 
Only 
common 
people 
say 
P--. 
Or 
one 
can 
say 
one's 
like 
that. 
Dora 
has 
had 
M-since 
August 
before 
last, 
and 
it 
is 
horribly 
disagreeable, 
because 
men 
always 
know. 
That 
is 
why 
at 
the 
High 
School 
we 
have 
only 
three 
men 
professors 
and 
all 
the 
other 
teachers 
are 
women. 
Now 
Dora 
often 
does 
not 
have 
M--and 
then 
sometimes 
it's 
awfully 
bad, 
and 
that's 
why 
she's 
anemic. 
That 
men 
always 
know, 
that's 
frightfully 
interesting. 


April 
4th. 
We 
talk 
a 
lot 
about 
such 
things 
now. 
Dora 
certainly 
knows 
more 
than 
I 
do, 
that 
is 
not 
more 
but 
better. 
But 
she 
isn't 
quite 
straightforward 
all 
the 
same. 
When 
I 
asked 
her 
how 
she 
got 
to 
know 
about 
it 
all, 
whether 
Erika 
told 
her 
or 
Frieda, 
she 
said: 
"Oh, 
I 
don't 
know; 
one 
finds 
it 
all 
out 
somehow; 
one 
need 
only 
use 
one's 
eyes 
and 
one's 
ears, 
and 
then 
one 
can 
reason 
things 
out 
a 
little." 
But 
seeing 
and 
hearing 
don't 
take 
one 
very 
far. 
I've 
always 
kept 
my 
eyes 
open 
and 
I'm 
not 
so 
stupid 
as 
all 
that. 
One 
must 
be 
told 
by 
some 
one, 
one 
can't 
just 
happen 
upon 
it 
by 
oneself. 


April 
6th. 
I 
don't 
care 
about 
paying 
visits 
now. 
We 
used 
always 
to 
like 
going 
to 
see 
the 
Richters, 
but 
to-day 
I 
found 
it 
dull. 
Now 
I 
know 
why 
Dora 
hates 
going 
second 
class 
on 
the 
Metropolitan. 
I 
always 
thought 
it 
was 
only 
to 
spite 
me 
because 
I 
like 
travelling 
second. 
She 
never 
likes 
going 
second 
since 
that 
happened. 
It 
seems 
one 
is 
often 
unjust 
to 
people 
who 
never 
meant 
what 
one 
thought. 
But 
why 
did 
she 
not 
tell 
me 
the 
truth? 
She 
says 
because 
I 
was 
still 
a 
child 
then. 
That's 
all 
right, 
but 
what 
about 
this 
winter 
when 
I 
was 
cross 
because 
we 
went 
Third 
class 
to 
Schonbrunn; 
I 
really 
believed 
she 
did 
it 
to 
annoy 
me, 
for 
I 
could 
not 
believe 
she 
was 
afraid 
that 
in 
the 
second 
class, 
where 
one 
is 
often 
alone, 
somebody 
would 
suddenly 
attack 
her 
with 
a 
knife. 
But 
now 
I 
understand 
quite 
well, 
for 
of 
course 
she 
could 
not 
tell 
Mother 
the 
truth 
and 
Father 
still 
less. 
And 
in 
winter 
and 
spring 
there 
are 
really 
often 
no 
passengers 
to 
speak 
of 
on 
the 
Metropolitan, 
especially 
on 
the 
Outer 
Circle. 


April 
7th. 
Mother 
said 
to-day 
that 
at 
the 
Richters 
yesterday 
we, 
especially 
I, 
had 
been 
frightfully 
dull 
and 
stupid. 
Why 
had 
we 
kept 
on 
exchanging 
glances? 
We 
had 
been 
most 
unmannerly. 
If 
she 
had 
only 
known 
what 
we 



were 
thinking 
of 
when 
Frau 
Richter 
said, 
the 
weather 
to-day 
is 
certainly 
quite 
abnormal; 
we 
have 
not 
had 
such 
abnormal 
heat 
for 
years. 
And 
then 
when 
Herr 
Richter 
came 
home 
and 
spoke 
about 
his 
brother 
who 
had 
spent 
the 
whole 
winter 
at 
Hochschneeberg 
and 
said: 
Oh, 
my 
brother 
is 
a 
little 
abnormal, 
I 
think 
he's 
got 
a 
tile 
loose 
in 
the 
upper 
storey, 
I 
really 
thought 
I 
should 
burst. 
Luckily 
Frau 
R. 
helped 
us 
once 
more 
to 
a 
tremendous 
lot 
of 
cake 
and 
I 
was 
able 
to 
lean 
well 
forward 
over 
my 
plate. 
And 
Mother 
said 
that 
I 
ate 
like 
a 
little 
glutton 
and 
just 
as 
if 
I 
never 
had 
any 
cake 
at 
home. 
So 
Mother 
was 
very 
unjust 
to 
me, 
for 
the 
cake 
had 
nothing 
at 
all 
to 
do 
with 
it. 
Dora 
says 
too 
that 
I 
must 
learn 
to 
control 
myself 
better, 
that 
if 
I 
only 
watch 
her 
I'll 
soon 
learn. 
That's 
all 
very 
well, 
but 
why 
should 
one 
have 
to 
bother? 
If 
people 
did 
not 
use 
words 
that 
really 
mean 
something 
quite 
different 
then 
other 
people 
would 
not 
have 
to 
control 
themselves. 
Still, 
I 
must 
learn 
to 
do 
it 
somehow. 


April 
8th. 
We 
were 
terribly 
alarmed 
to-day; 
quite 
early, 
at 
half 
past 
8, 
they 
telephoned 
from 
the 
school 
that 
Dora 
had 
suddenly 
been 
taken 
ill 
in 
the 
Latin 
lesson 
and 
must 
be 
fetched 
in 
a 
carriage. 
Mother 
drove 
down 
directly 
in 
a 
taxi 
and 
I 
went 
with 
her 
because 
anyhow 
my 
lessons 
began 
at 
9 
and 
we 
found 
Dora 
on 
the 
sofa 
in 
the 
office 
with 
the 
head 
sitting 
by 
her 
and 
the 
head's 
friend, 
Frau 
Doktor 
Preisky, 
who 
is 
a 
medical 
doctor, 
and 
they 
had 
loosened 
her 
dress 
and 
put 
a 
cold 
compress 
on 
her 
head 
for 
she 
had 
suddenly 
fainted 
in 
the 
Latin 
lesson. 
That's 
the 
third 
time 
this 
year, 
so 
she 
must 
really 
have 
anemia. 
I 
wanted 
to 
drive 
home 
with 
her, 
but 
Mother 
and 
Frau 
Dr. 
P. 
said 
I'd 
better 
just 
go 
to 
my 
lessons. 
And 
as 
I 
went 
out 
I 
heard 
Frau 
Dr. 
P. 
say: 
"That's 
a 
fine 
healthy 
girl, 
a 
jolly 
little 
fellow." 
Really 
one 
should 
only 
use 
that 
word 
of 
boys 
and 
men, 
but 
I 
suppose 
she 
has 
got 
into 
the 
way 
of 
using 
it 
through 
being 
with 
men 
so 
much. 
If 
one 
studies 
medicine 
one 
has 
to 
learn 
all 
about 
that 
and 
to 
look 
at 
everything. 
It 
must 
be 
really 
horrid. 


Dora 
is 
kept 
in 
bed 
to-day 
and 
our 
Doctor 
says 
too 
that 
she's 
anemic. 
Tomorrow 
or 
the 
day 
after 
Mother 
is 
going 
to 
take 
her 
to 
see 
a 
specialist. 
Dora 
says 
it's 
a 
lovely 
feeling 
to 
faint. 
Suddenly 
one 
can't 
hear 
what 
people 
are 
saying 
and 
one 
feels 
quite 
weak 
and 
then 
one 
does 
not 
know 
anything 
more. 
I 
wonder 
if 
I 
shall 
ever 
faint? 
Very 
likely 
when------We 
talked 
a 
lot 
about 
everything 
we 
are 
interested 
in. 
In 
the 
afternoon 
Hella 
came 
to 
ask 
after 
Dora, 
and 
she 
thinks 
she 
looks 
awfully 
pretty 
in 
bed, 
an 
interesting 
invalid 
and 
at 



the 
same 
time 
so 
distinguished 
looking. 
It's 
quite 
true, 
we 
all 
look 
distinguished. 


April 
9th. 
To-day 
is 
Father 
and 
Mother's 
wedding 
day. 
Now 
I 
know 
what 
that 
really 
means. 
Dora 
says 
it 
can't 
really 
be 
true 
that 
it 
is 
the 
most 
lovely 
day 
in 
one's 
life, 
as 
everyone 
says 
it 
is, 
especially 
the 
poets. 
She 
thinks 
that 
one 
must 
feel 
frightfully 
embarrassed 
because 
after 
all 
everyone 
knows. 
. 
. 
. 
That's 
quite 
true, 
but 
after 
all 
one 
need 
not 
tell 
anyone 
which 
one's 
wedding 
day 
is. 
Dora 
says 
she 
will 
never 
tell 
her 
children 
which 
her 
wedding 
day 
is. 
But 
it 
would 
be 
a 
great 
pity 
if 
parents 
always 
did 
that 
for 
then 
in 
every 
family 
there 
would 
be 
one 
anniversary 
the 
less. 
And 
the 
more 
anniversaries 
there 
are, 
the 
jollier 
it 
is. 


April 
10th. 
To-morrow 
I'm 
going 
with 
Father 
to 
Salzburg. 
Dora 
can't 
come, 
for 
they 
think 
she 
might 
faint 
in 
the 
train. 
I'm 
rather 
glad 
really, 
though 
I've 
nothing 
against 
her 
and 
I'm 
sorry 
for 
her, 
but 
it's 
much 
nicer 
to 
go 
with 
Father 
alone. 
It's 
a 
long 
time 
since 
I 
was 
in 
Salzburg. 
I'm 
so 
awfully 
glad 
to 
go. 
Our 
spring 
coats 
and 
skirts 
are 
so 
pretty, 
dark 
green 
with 
a 
silk 
lining 
striped 
green 
and 
gold-brown, 
and 
light 
brown 
straw 
hats 
with 
daisies 
for 
the 
spring 
and 
later 
we 
shall 
have 
cherries 
or 
roses. 
I'm 
taking 
my 
diary 
so 
that 
I 
can 
write 
everything 
which 
interests 
me. 


April 
12th. 
I 
slept 
all 
the 
way 
in 
the 
train. 
Father 
says 
I 
ground 
my 
teeth 
frightfully 
and 
was 
very 
restless: 
but 
I 
did 
not 
know 
anything 
about 
it. 
We 
had 
a 
compartment 
by 
ourselves, 
except 
just 
at 
first 
when 
there 
was 
a 
gentleman 
there. 
Hella 
did 
not 
come 
with 
us, 
because 
her 
aunt, 
who 
has 
just 
been 
married, 
is 
coming 
to 
visit 
them. 
Really 
I'm 
quite 
glad, 
for 
I 
like 
so 
much 
being 
with 
Father 
quite 
alone. 
This 
afternoon 
we 
were 
in 
Hellbrunn 
and 
at 
the 
Rock 
Theatre. 
It 
is 
wonderful. 


April 
13th. 
Father 
always 
calls 
me: 
Little 
Witch! 
But 
I 
don't 
much 
like 
it 
when 
other 
people 
are 
there. 
To-day 
we 
went 
up 
the 
Gaisberg. 
The 
weather 
was 
lovely 
and 
the 
view 
magnificent. 
When 
I 
see 
so 
extensive 
a 
view 
it 
always 
makes 
me 
feel 
sad. 
Because 
there 
are 
so 
many 
people 
one 
does 
not 
know 
who 
perhaps 
are 
very 
nice. 
I 
should 
like 
to 
be 
always 
travelling. 
It 
would 
be 
splendid. 


April 
14th. 
I 
nearly 
got 
lost 
to-day. 
Father 
was 
writing 
a 
letter 
to 
Mother 
and 



he 
let 
me 
go 
to 
see 
the 
salt 
works; 
I 
don't 
know 
how 
it 
happened, 
but 
suddenly 
I 
found 
myself 
a 
long 
way 
from 
anywhere, 
in 
a 
place 
I 
did 
not 
know. 
Then 
an 
old 
gentleman 
asked 
me 
what 
I 
was 
looking 
for; 
because 
I 
had 
walked 
past 
the 
same 
place 
3 
times 
and 
I 
said 
we 
were 
staying 
in 
the 
"Zur 
Post 
Hotel" 
and 
I 
did 
not 
know 
how 
to 
find 
my 
way 
back. 
So 
he 
came 
with 
me 
to 
show 
me 
and 
as 
we 
were 
talking 
it 
came 
out 
that 
he 
had 
known 
Father 
at 
the 
university. 
So 
he 
came 
in 
with 
me 
and 
Father 
was 
awfully 
glad 
to 
see 
him. 
He 
is 
a 
barrister 
in 
Salzburg 
but 
he 
has 
a 
grey 
beard 
already. 
As 
he 
was 
going 
away 
he 
said 
in 
an 
undertone 
to 
Father: 
"I 
congratulate 
you 
old 
chap 
on 
your 
daughter; 
she'll 
be 
something 
quite 
out 
of 
the 
ordinary!" 
He 
whispered 
it 
really, 
but 
I 
heard 
all 
the 
same. 
We 
spent 
all 
the 
afternoon 
with 
him 
at 
the 
Kapuzinerberg. 
There 
was 
a 
splendid 
military 
band; 
two 
young 
officers 
in 
the 
Yagers 
who 
were 
sitting 
at 
the 
next 
table 
to 
ours 
kept 
on 
looking 
our 
way; 
one 
was 
particularly 
handsome. 
My 
new 
summer 
coat 
and 
skirt 
is 
awfully 
becoming 
everyone 
says. 
Father 
says 
too: 
"I 
say, 
you'll 
soon 
be 
a 
young 
lady! 
But 
don't 
grow 
up 
too 
quickly!" 
I 
can't 
make 
out 
why 
he 
said 
that; 
I 
should 
like 
to 
be 
quite 
grown 
up; 
but 
it 
will 
be 
a 
long 
time 
yet. 


April 
14th. 
It's 
been 
raining 
all 
day. 
How 
horrid. 
One 
can't 
go 
anywhere. 
All 
the 
morning 
we 
were 
walking 
about 
the 
town 
and 
saw 
several 
churches. 
Then 
we 
were 
at 
the 
pastrycook's, 
where 
I 
ate 
4 
chocolate 
eclairs 
and 
2 
tartlets. 
So 
I 
had 
no 
appetite 
for 
dinner. 


April 
15th. 
Just 
as 
I 
was 
writing 
yesterday 
Dr. 
Gratzl 
sent 
up 
the 
hotel 
clerk 
to 
ask 
us 
to 
dinner. 
We 
went, 
they 
live 
in 
the 
Hellbrunnerstrasse. 
He 
has 
4 
daughters 
and 
2 
sons 
and 
the 
mother 
died 
three 
years 
ago. 
One 
of 
the 
sons 
is 
a 
student 
in 
Graz 
and 
the 
other 
is 
a 
lieutenant 
in 
the 
army; 
he 
is 
engaged 
to 
be 
married. 
The 
daughters 
are 
quite 
old 
already; 
one 
of 
them 
is 
27 
and 
is 
engaged. 
I 
think 
that 
is 
horrid. 
The 
youngest 
(!!!) 
is 
24. 
It 
is 
so 
funny 
to 
say 
"the 
youngest" 
and 
then 
she 
is 
24. 
Father 
says 
she 
is 
very 
pretty 
and 
will 
certainly 
get 
married 
At 
24!! 
when 
she's 
not 
even 
engaged 
yet; 
I 
don't 
believe 
she 
will. 
They 
have 
a 
large 
garden, 
3 
dogs 
and 
2 
cats, 
which 
get 
on 
very 
well 
together. 
There 
are 
steps 
leading 
up 
and 
down 
from 
room 
to 
room, 
it 
is 
lovely, 
and 
all 
the 
windows 
are 
bow-windows. 
Everything 
is 
so 
old-
fashioned, 
even 
the 
furniture 
I 
do 
think 
it's 
all 
so 
pretty. 
The 
hall 
is 
round 
like 
a 
church. 
After 
tea 
we 
had 
candied 
fruits, 
stewed 
fruit, 
and 
pastries. 
I 
had 
a 
huge 
go 
of 
stewed 
fruit. 
They 
have 
a 
gramaphone 
and 
then 
Leni 
and 
I 
played 



the 
piano. 
Just 
as 
we 
were 
going 
away 
Fritz, 
the 
student, 
came 
in; 
he 
got 
quite 
red 
and 
in 
the 
hall 
Dr. 
Gratzl 
said 
to 
me: 
"You've 
made 
a 
conquest 
today." 
I 
don't 
really 
believe 
I 
have, 
but 
I 
do 
like 
hearing 
it 
said. 
I'm 
sorry 
to 
say 
we 
are 
going 
away 
to-morrow, 
for 
we 
are 
going 
to 
stay 
2 
days 
in 
Linz 
with 
Uncle 
Theodor 
whom 
I 
don't 
know. 


April 
17th. 
Uncle 
Theodor 
is 
60 
already 
and 
Aunt 
Lina 
is 
old 
too. 
Still, 
they 
are 
both 
awfully 
nice. 
I 
did 
not 
know 
them 
before. 
We 
are 
staying 
with 
them. 
In 
the 
evening 
their 
son 
and 
his 
wife 
came. 
They 
are 
my 
cousins, 
and 
they 
brought 
their 
little 
girl 
with 
them; 
I 
am 
really 
a 
sort 
of 
aunt 
of 
hers. 
It's 
awfully 
funny 
to 
be 
an 
aunt 
when 
one 
is 
only 
12 
and 
3/4 
and 
when 
one's 
niece 
is 
9. 
To-day 
we 
went 
walking 
along 
the 
Danube. 
It 
only 
rained 
very 
gently 
and 
not 
all 
the 
time. 


April 
18th. 
We 
are 
going 
home 
to-day. 
Of 
course 
we 
have 
sent 
a 
lot 
of 
picture 
postcards 
to 
Mother 
and 
Dora 
and 
Hella; 
we 
sent 
one 
to 
Oswald 
too. 
He 
came 
home 
for 
Easter. 
I 
don't 
know 
whether 
he 
will 
still 
be 
there 
tomorrow. 


April 
22nd. 
We've 
begun 
school 
again. 
Dora 
and 
I 
generally 
walk 
to 
school 
together 
since 
she 
does 
not 
go 
to 
the 
Latin 
lesson 
now 
because 
it 
was 
too 
great 
a 
strain 
for 
her. 
The 
specialist 
Mother 
took 
her 
to 
see 
wanted 
her 
to 
give 
up 
studying 
altogether, 
but 
she 
absolutely 
refuses 
to 
do 
that. 
But 
I'm 
very 
furious 
with 
her; 
she's 
learning 
Latin 
in 
secret. 
When 
I 
came 
into 
the 
room 
the 
day 
before 
yesterday 
she 
was 
writing 
out 
words 
and 
she 
shut 
her 
book 
quickly 
instead 
of 
saying 
openly 
and 
honestly: 
Rita, 
don't 
tell 
Father 
and 
Mother 
that 
I'm 
still 
studying 
in 
the 
evening: 
"I 
trust 
your 
word." 
She 
could 
trust 
me 
perfectly 
well. 
There 
are 
plenty 
of 
things 
I 
could 
tell 
if 
I 
liked! 
Perhaps 
she 
fancies 
that 
I 
don't 
see 
that 
the 
tall 
fair 
man 
always 
follows 
us 
to 
school 
in 
the 
morning. 
Hella 
has 
noticed 
him 
too, 
besides 
he 
is 
frightfully 
bald 
and 
must 
be 
at 
least 
30. 
And 
I'm 
certain 
she 
would 
not 
talk 
as 
much 
as 
she 
does 
to 
Hella 
and 
me 
if 
it 
were 
not 
that 
she 
wants 
to 
talk 
about 
that. 
But 
this 
deceitfulness 
annoys 
me 
frightfully. 
Otherwise 
we 
are 
now 
quite 
intimate 
with 
one 
another. 


April 
24th. 
We 
went 
to 
confession 
and 
communion 
to-day. 
I 
do 
hate 
confession; 
though 
it's 
never 
happened 
to 
me 
what 
many 
girls 
have 
told 
me, 
even 
girls 
in 
the 
Fifth. 
No 
priest 
has 
ever 
asked 
me 
about 
the 
6th 



commandment; 
all 
they've 
asked 
is: 
In 
thought, 
word, 
or 
deed? 
Still, 
I 
do 
hate 
going 
to 
confession, 
and 
so 
does 
Dora. 
It's 
much 
nicer 
for 
Hella 
as 
a 
Protestant 
for 
they 
have 
no 
confession. 
And 
at 
communion 
I'm 
always 
terrified 
that 
the 
host 
might 
drop 
out 
of 
my 
mouth. 
That 
would 
be 
awful. 
I 
expect 
one 
would 
be 
immediately 
excommunicated 
as 
a 
heretic. 
Dora 
was 
not 
allowed 
to 
come 
to 
confession 
and 
com., 
Father 
would 
not 
let 
her. 
She 
must 
not 
go 
out 
without 
her 
breakfast. 


April 
26th. 
In 
the 
Third 
there 
really 
is 
a 
girl 
who 
dropped 
the 
host 
out 
of 
her 
mouth. 
There 
was 
a 
frightful 
row 
about 
it. 
She 
said 
it 
was 
not 
her 
fault 
the 
priest's 
hand 
shook 
so. 
It's 
quite 
true, 
he 
was 
very 
old, 
and 
that 
is 
why 
I'm 
always 
afraid 
it 
will 
happen 
to 
me. 
It's 
much 
better 
when 
the 
priest 
is 
young, 
because 
then 
that 
can 
never 
happen. 
Father 
says 
that 
the 
girl 
won't 
be 
excommunicated 
for 
this, 
and 
luckily 
one 
of 
her 
uncles 
is 
a 
distinguished 
prelate. 
He 
is 
her 
guardian 
too. 
That 
will 
help 
her 
out. 


April 
27th. 
To-day 
we 
got 
to 
know 
this 
girl 
in 
the 
interval. 
She 
is 
awfully 
nice 
and 
she 
says 
she 
really 
did 
not 
do 
it 
on 
purpose 
for 
she 
is 
frightfully 
pious 
and 
perhaps 
she's 
going 
to 
be 
a 
nun. 
I 
am 
pious 
too, 
we 
go 
to 
church 
nearly 
every 
Sunday, 
but 
I 
would 
not 
go 
into 
a 
convent, 
not 
I. 
Dora 
says 
people 
generally 
do 
that 
when 
they've 
been 
crossed 
in 
love, 
because 
then 
the 
world 
seems 
empty 
and 
hateful. 
She 
looked 
so 
frightfully 
sentimental 
that 
I 
said: 
Seems 
to 
me 
you've 
a 
fancy 
that 
way 
yourself? 
Then 
she 
said: 
"No, 
thank 
goodness, 
I've 
no 
reason 
for 
that." 
Of 
course 
what 
she 
meant 
was 
that 
she 
was 
not 
crossed 
in 
love 
but 
the 
other 
way. 
No 
doubt 
the 
tall 
man 
in 
the 
mornings. 
I 
looked 
hard 
at 
her 
for 
a 
long 
time 
and 
said: 
"I 
congratulate 
you 
on 
your 
good 
fortune. 
But 
Hella 
and 
I 
wish 
he 
was 
not 
bald," 
then 
she 
said 
with 
an 
astonished 
air: 
"Bald? 
What 
are 
you 
talking 
about, 
he 
has 
the 
lofty 
brow 
of 
a 
thinker." 


27th. 
To-day 
Mademoiselle 
came 
for 
the 
first 
time. 
I 
have 
forgotten 
to 
say 
that 
Dora 
has 
to 
go 
out 
every 
day 
for 
two 
hours 
to 
sit 
and 
walk 
in 
the 
sunshine. 
Since 
Mother 
is 
not 
very 
well 
and 
can't 
walk 
much, 
we've 
engaged 
the 
Mad. 
Father 
says 
that 
when 
I 
have 
time 
I 
must 
go 
too 
"as 
a 
precautionary 
measure." 
I 
don't 
like 
the 
idea 
at 
all, 
it's 
much 
too 
dull; 
besides 
I 
have 
simply 
no 
time. 
Mad. 
is 
coming 
3 
times 
a 
week, 
Mondays, 
Wednesdays, 
and 
Fridays, 
and 
on 
Mondays, 
Thursdays, 
and 
Saturdays 
I 
have 
my 
music 
lesson, 



so 
I 
can't 
go; 
so 
Finis 
and 
Jubilation! 
That's 
what 
Oswald 
always 
says 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
year 
and 
at 
the 
end 
of 
term. 
Still, 
she's 
very 
pretty, 
has 
fair 
curly 
hair, 
huge 
grey 
eyes 
with 
black 
lashes 
and 
eyebrows, 
but 
she 
speaks 
so 
fast 
that 
I 
can't 
understand 
all 
she 
says. 
On 
the 
other 
3 
days 
an 
Englishwoman 
is 
to 
come, 
but 
we 
have 
not 
got 
one 
yet, 
they 
are 
all 
so 
expensive. 
It 
does 
seem 
funny 
to 
me 
to 
get 
a 
salary 
for 
going 
out 
with 
grown 
up 
girls, 
that's 
only 
an 
amusement. 
With 
regular 
tomboys, 
such 
as 
we 
saw 
last 
year 
in 
Rathaus 
Park, 
it 
would 
be 
different. 
As 
for 
the 
French 
or 
English 
conversation! 
If 
they 
did 
not 
want 
to 
talk 
what 
would 
it 
matter? 
And 
besides 
why 
should 
one 
want 
to 
talk 
either 
French 
or 
English, 
it's 
so 
stupid. 


April 
28th. 
The 
Richters 
were 
here 
to-day, 
and 
the 
eldest 
son 
came 
too, 
the 
lieutenant 
from 
Lemberg; 
he 
is 
awfully 
handsome 
and 
made 
hot 
love 
to 
Dora; 
Walter 
is 
very 
nice 
too, 
he 
is 
at 
the 
School 
of 
Forestry 
in 
Modling; 
to-morrow 
the 
lieutenant 
is 
going 
to 
bring 
Dora 
one 
of 
Tolstoi's 
books 
to 
read. 
Then 
they 
will 
do 
some 
music 
together, 
she 
piano 
and 
he 
violin; 
it's 
a 
pity 
I 
can't 
play 
as 
well 
as 
Dora 
yet. 
At 
Whitsuntide 
Walter 
is 
coming 
too 
and 
Viktor 
(that 
means 
conqueror) 
is 
on 
furlough 
for 
6 
months, 
because 
he's 
ill, 
or 
because 
he 
is 
said 
to 
be 
ill; 
for 
one 
does 
not 
look 
like 
that 
when 
one 
is 
really 
ill. 


May 
4th. 
Lieutenant 
R. 
is 
always 
coming 
here, 
he 
must 
be 
frightfully 
smitten 
with 
Dora. 
But 
Father 
won't 
have 
it 
at 
any 
price. 
He 
said 
to 
Dora 
to-day: 


You 
get 
this 
gay 
young 
spark 
out 
of 
your 
head; 
he 
is 
no 
good. 
But 
at 
sight 
of 
a 
uniform 
there 
is 
no 
holding 
you 
girls. 
I've 
no 
objection 
to 
you 
doing 
music 
together 
for 
an 
hour 
or 
two; 
but 
this 
perpetual 
running 
to 
and 
fro 
with 
books 
and 
notes 
is 
all 
humbug." 


May 
6th. 
Lieutenant 
R. 
walks 
with 
us, 
that 
is 
with 
Dora, 
to 
school 
every 
day. 
He 
is 
supposed 
to 
lie 
in 
bed 
late 
every 
morning, 
for 
he 
is 
really 
ill 
but 
for 
Dora's 
sake 
he 
gets 
up 
frightfully 
early 
and 
comes 
over 
from 
Heitzing 
and 
waits 
in 
----Street. 
Of 
course 
I 
go 
on 
alone 
with 
Hella 
and 
we 
all 
meet 
In 
---Street, 
so 
that 
no 
one 
shall 
notice 
anything 
at 
school. 


May 
13th. 
To-morrow 
is 
Mother's 
birthday 
and 
Viktor 
(when 
I 
am 
talking 
about 
him 
to 
Dora 
I 
always 
speak 
of 
him 
as 
V.) 
brought 
her 
some 
lovely 
roses 
and 
invited 
us 
all 
to 
go 
there 
next 
Sunday. 
In 
the 
hall 
he 
called 
me 
"the 
Guardian 
Angel 
of 
our 
Love." 
Yes, 
that 
is 
what 
I 
am 
and 
always 
shall 
be; 
for 



he 
really 
deserves 
it 
and 
Dora 
too 
is 
quite 
different 
from 
what 
she 
used 
to 
be. 
Hella 
says 
one 
can 
see 
for 
oneself 
that 
love 
ennobles; 
up 
till 
now 
she 
has 
always 
thought 
that 
to 
be 
mere 
poetical 
fiction. 


May 
15th. 
Father 
said: 
I 
don't 
care 
much 
about 
these 
visits 
to 
the 
Richters 
as 
long 
as 
that 
young 
jackanapes 
is 
still 
there, 
but 
Mother 
can't 
very 
well 
refuse. 
We 
shall 
wear 
our 
green 
coats 
and 
skirts 
with 
the 
white 
blouses 
with 
the 
little 
green 
silk 
leaves 
for 
Dora 
does 
not 
like 
to 
wear 
all 
white 
except 
in 
summer. 
And 
because 
the 
leaves 
on 
the 
blouses 
are 
clover 
leaves, 
that 
is 
because 
of 
their 
meaning. 
We 
are 
looking 
forward 
to 
it 
tremendously. 
I 
do 
hope 
Mother 
will 
be 
all 
right, 
for 
she 
is 
in 
bed 
to-day. 
It's 
horrid 
being 
ill 
anyhow, 
but 
when 
being 
ill 
interferes 
with 
other 
people's 
pleasure 
it's 
simply 
frightful. 


May 
16th. 
The 
day 
before 
yesterday 
was 
Mother's 
birthday; 
but 
it 
was 
not 
so 
jolly 
as 
usual 
because 
Mother 
is 
so 
often 
ill; 
for 
a 
birthday 
present 
I 
painted 
her 
a 
box 
with 
a 
spray 
of 
clematis, 
which 
looks 
awfully 
chic. 
Dora 
gave 
her 
a 
book 
cover 
embroidered 
with 
a 
spray 
of 
Japanese 
cherries, 
I 
don't 
know 
what 
Father 
gave 
her, 
money 
I 
think, 
because 
on 
her 
birthday 
and 
name 
day 
he 
always 
hands 
her 
an 
envelope. 
But 
since 
Mother 
is 
not 
well 
we 
were 
not 
very 
cheerful, 
and 
when 
we 
drank 
her 
health 
at 
dinner 
she 
wiped 
her 
eyes 
when 
she 
thought 
we 
were 
not 
looking. 
Still, 
it's 
not 
so 
dangerous 
as 
all 
that; 
she 
is 
able 
to 
go 
out 
and 
doesn't 
look 
bad. 
I 
think 
Mother's 
awfully 
smart, 
she 
looks 
just 
as 
well 
in 
her 
dressing 
gown 
as 
when 
she's 
dressed 
up 
to 
go 
out. 
Dora 
says 
that 
if 
she 
had 
been 
made 
ill 
by 
her 
husband 
she 
would 
hate 
him 
and 
would 
never 
let 
her 
daughters 
marry. 
That's 
all 
very 
well, 
but 
one 
ought 
to 
be 
quite 
sure 
that 
that 
is 
why 
one 
has 
become 
ill. 
They 
say 
that 
is 
why 
Aunt 
Dora 
doesn't 
like 
Father. 
Certainly 
Father 
is 
not 
so 
nice 
to 
her 
as 
to 
other 
relations 
or 
to 
the 
ladies 
who 
some 
to 
see 
Mother. 
But 
after 
all, 
Aunt 
Dora 
has 
no 
right 
to 
make 
scenes 
about 
it 
to 
Father, 
as 
Dora 
says 
she 
does. 
Mother's 
the 
only 
person 
with 
any 
right 
to 
do 
that. 
Dora 
says 
she 
is 
afraid 
that 
it 
will 
come 
to 
Mother's 
having 
to 
have 
an 
operation. 
Nothing 
would 
ever 
induce 
me 
to 
undergo 
an 
operation, 
it 
must 
be 
horrible, 
I 
know 
because 
of 
Hella 
and 
the 
appendicitis. 
But 
Dora 
says: 
"Anyone 
who's 
had 
five 
children 
must 
be 
used 
to 
that 
sort 
of 
thing." 
I 
shall 
pray 
every 
night 
that 
Mother 
may 
get 
well 
without 
an 
operation. 
I 
expect 
we 
shan't 
all 
go 
away 
together 
at 
Whitsuntide 
this 
year, 
for 
Mother 
and 
Dora 
are 
to 
go 
to 
a 
health 
resort, 
most 
likely 
to 
Franzensbad. 



May 
18th. 
It 
was 
lovely 
at 
the 
Richters; 
Walter 
was 
there 
from 
Modling, 
he 
was 
awfully 
nice, 
and 
said 
I 
was 
so 
like 
my 
sister 
that 
it 
was 
difficult 
to 
tell 
us 
apart. 
That's 
a 
frightful 
cram, 
but 
I 
know 
what 
he 
really 
meant. 
He 
plays 
the 
flute 
splendidly, 
and 
the 
three 
played 
a 
trio, 
so 
that 
I 
was 
frightfully 
annoyed 
with 
myself 
for 
not 
having 
worked 
harder 
at 
my 
music. 
From 
tomorrow 
on 
I 
shall 
practice 
2 
hours 
every 
day, 
if 
I 
can 
possibly 
find 
time. 
Next 
winter 
Viktor 
is 
going 
to 
found 
a 
private 
dramatic 
club, 
so 
he 
must 
be 
going 
to 
stay 
more 
than 
six 
months 
in 
Vienna. 
Walter 
thinks 
Dora 
awfully 
charming, 
and 
when 
I 
said: 
"The 
great 
pity 
is 
that 
she's 
got 
such 
frightful 
anemia," 
he 
said: 
In 
a 
man's 
eyes 
that 
is 
no 
drawback 
whatever, 
as 
you 
can 
see 
in 
my 
brother. 
Moreover, 
that 
illness 
is 
not 
a 
real 
illness, 
but 
often 
makes 
a 
girl 
more 
charming 
than 
ever, 
as 
you 
can 
see 
in 
your 
sister. 


Day 
before 
yesterday 
Miss 
Maggie 
Lundy 
came 
for 
the 
first 
time; 
anybody 
can 
have 
her 
for 
me. 
She 
wears 
false 
hair, 
flaxen. 
She 
says 
she 
is 
engaged, 
but 
Dora 
says, 
has 
been. 
I 
simply 
don't 
believe 
it. 
V. 
says 
Mad. 
is 
awfully 
pretty. 
When 
I 
asked 
Dora 
if 
she 
was 
not 
jealous, 
she 
said 
she 
didn't 
care, 
she 
was 
quite 
sure 
of 
his 
love. 
He 
means 
to 
leave 
the 
army 
and 
go 
into 
the 
civil 
service, 
and 
then 
he 
will 
be 
able 
to 
marry. 
But 
Dora 
said, 
there's 
plenty 
of 
time 
for 
that, 
a 
secret 
engagement 
is 
much 
nicer. 
Then 
she 
noticed 
she'd 
given 
herself 
away, 
and 
she 
blushed 
like 
anything 
and 
said: 
You 
naturally 
must 
be 
engaged 
before 
you 
are 
married, 
mustn't 
you?--of 
course 
she 
is 
secretly 
engaged, 
but 
she 
won't 
tell 
me 
about 
it. 
What's 
the 
good 
of 
my 
being 
the 
"Guardian 
Angel 
of 
their 
Love?" 
If 
he 
only 
knew. 


May 
19th. 
I 
really 
ought 
to 
practice 
to-day, 
but 
I 
simply 
have 
no 
time, 
first 
of 
all 
I 
had 
my 
lesson 
anyhow, 
and 
secondly 
something 
awful 
happened 
to 
Dora. 
She 
left 
her 
diary 
lying 
about 
in 
the 
school; 
and 
because 
we 
have 
our 
religion 
lesson 
in 
the 
Fifth 
I 
saw 
a 
green 
bound 
book 
lying 
under 
the 
third 
bench. 
Great 
Scott, 
I 
thought, 
that 
looks 
like 
Dora's 
diary. 
I 
went 
up 
as 
quickly 
as 
I 
could 
and 
put 
my 
satchel 
over 
it. 
Later 
in 
the 
lesson 
I 
picked 
it 
up. 
When 
I 
got 
home 
at 
1 
o'clock 
I 
did 
not 
say 
anything 
at 
first. 
After 
dinner 
she 
began 
rummaging 
all 
over 
the 
place, 
but 
without 
saying 
anything 
to 
me, 
and 
then 
I 
said 
quite 
quietly: 
"Do 
you 
hap--pen 
to 
be 
look--ing 
for 
your 
di-ar--
y? 
Here 
it 
is; 
you--left--it 
--in--the--fifth--class--un--der--the--third-bench." 
(I 
kept 
her 
on 
tenter 
hooks 
that 
way.) 
She 
got 
as 
white 
as 
a 
sheet 
and 



said: 
You 
are 
an 
angel. 
If 
any 
one 
else 
had 
found 
it, 
I 
should 
have 
been 
expelled 
and 
Mad. 
would 
have 
had 
to 
drown 
herself. 
Oh, 
it 
can't 
be 
as 
bad 
as 
all 
that," 
I 
said, 
for 
what 
she 
said 
about 
Mad. 
was 
frightfully 
exciting. 
In 
class 
I 
had 
looked 
chiefly 
at 
what 
she 
had 
written 
about 
V. 
But 
I 
could 
not 
read 
it 
there, 
because 
it 
was 
written 
very 
small 
and 
close 
together 
and 
was 
several 
pages, 
but 
I 
had 
not 
looked 
much 
at 
what 
she 
had 
written 
about 
Mad. 
"Did 
you 
read 
it?" 
No, 
only 
where 
it 
happened 
to 
come 
open 
because 
there's 
a 
page 
torn 
out. 
About 
V. 
or 
about 
Mad? 
"A 
little 
about 
Mad; 
but 
tell 
me 
all 
about 
it; 
I 
shan't 
tell 
anyone. 
For 
if 
I'd 
wanted 
to 
betray 
you, 
you 
know 
quite 
well. 
. 
. 
." 
And 
then 
she 
told 
me 
all 
about 
Mad. 
But 
first 
I 
had 
to 
promise 
that 
I 
would 
not 
even 
tell 
Hella. 
Mad. 
is 
secretly 
engaged 
to 
a 
man 
to 
whom 
she 
has 
given 
"the 
utmost 
gifts 
of 
love," 
that 
is 
to 
say 
she 
has 
. 
. 
. 
. 
She 
is 
madly 
in 
love 
with 
him, 
and 
they 
would 
marry 
directly 
but 
he 
is 
a 
lieutenant 
too, 
and 
they 
have 
not 
enough 
money 
for 
the 
security. 
She 
says 
that 
when 
one 
really 
loves 
a 
man 
one 
can 
bear 
everything 
for 
his 
sake. 
She 
has 
often 
been 
to 
his 
rooms, 
but 
she 
has 
to 
be 
frightfully 
careful 
for 
her 
father 
would 
kill 
her 
if 
he 
found 
out. 
Dora 
has 
seen 
the 
lieutenant 
and 
says 
he 
is 
very 
handsome, 
but 
that 
V. 
is 
much 
handsomer. 
Mad. 
says 
that 
you 
can't 
trust 
men 
as 
a 
rule, 
but 
that 
her 
lover 
is 
quite 
different, 
that 
he 
is 
true 
as 
steel. 
I 
am 
sure 
V. 
is 
too. 


May 
21st. 
When 
Mad. 
came 
to-day 
I 
simply 
could 
not 
look 
at 
her 
while 
Mother 
was 
there 
and 
Dora 
says 
I 
made 
an 
awful 
fool 
of 
myself. 
For 
I 
went 
out 
walking 
with 
them 
to-day, 
and 
when 
we 
met 
a 
smart-looking 
officer 
I 
hemmed 
and 
looked 
at 
Dora. 
But 
she 
didn't 
know 
why. 
Mad. 
is 
the 
daughter 
of 
a 
high 
official 
in 
the 
French 
military 
service 
and 
she 
only 
took 
her 
teacher's 
degree 
in 
order 
to 
get 
free 
from 
her 
Mother's 
"tyranny;" 
she 
nagged 
at 
her 
frightfully 
and 
until 
she 
began 
to 
give 
lessons 
she 
was 
never 
allowed 
to 
go 
out 
alone. 
Dora 
says 
she 
is 
very 
refined 
in 
her 
speech, 
especially 
when 
she 
is 
talking 
about 
these 
things. 
Of 
course 
about 
them 
she 
always 
speaks 
German, 
for 
it's 
much 
more 
difficult 
to 
say 
it 
in 
French, 
and 
probably 
Dora 
would 
not 
understand 
it 
and 
then 
Mad. 
would 
only 
have 
to 
translate 
it. 
She 
is 
called 
Sylvia 
and 
he 
calls 
her 
Sylvette. 
Mad. 
says 
that 
if 
one 
is 
madly 
in 
love 
with 
a 
man 
one 
does 
whatever 
he 
asks. 
But 
I 
don't 
see 
that 
one 
need 
do 
that, 
for 
he 
might 
ask 
the 
most 
idiotic 
things; 
he 
might 
ask 
you 
to 
get 
the 
moon 
out 
of 
the 
skies, 
or 
to 
pull 
out 
a 
tooth 
for 
his 
sake. 
Dora 
says 
she 
can 
understand 
it 
quite 
well; 
that 
I 
still 
lack 
the 
true 
inwardness 
of 
thought 
and 
feeling. 
It 
looks 
like 
utter 
nonsense. 
But 
since 
it 
sounds 
fine 
I've 
written 
it 
down, 
and 



perhaps 
I 
shall 
find 
a 
use 
for 
it 
some 
day 
when 
I'm 
talking 
to 
Walter. 
Mad. 
is 
always 
frightfully 
anxious 
lest 
she 
should 
get 
a 
baby. 
If 
she 
did 
she's 
sure 
her 
father 
would 
kill 
her. 
The 
lieutenant 
is 
in 
the 
flying 
corps. 
He 
hopes 
he's 
going 
to 
invent 
a 
new 
aeroplane, 
and 
that 
he 
will 
make 
a 
lot 
of 
money 
out 
of 
it. 
Then 
he 
will 
be 
able 
to 
marry 
Mad. 
But 
it 
would 
be 
awful 
if 
something 
happened 
and 
she 
got 
a 
baby 
already. 


May 
22nd. 
Dora 
asked 
me 
to-day 
how 
it 
was 
I 
knew 
all 
about 
these 
things, 
whether 
Hella 
had 
told 
me. 
I 
did 
not 
want 
to 
give 
Hella 
away, 
so 
I 
said 
quite 
casually: 
"Oh, 
one 
can 
read 
all 
about 
that 
in 
the 
encyclopedia." 
But 
Dora 
laughed 
and 
said: 
"You 
are 
quite 
on 
the 
wrong 
scent; 
you 
can't 
find 
a 
tenth 
of 
all 
those 
things 
in 
the 
encyclopedia, 
and 
what 
you 
do 
find 
is 
no 
good. 
In 
these 
matters 
it 
is 
absolutely 
no 
good 
depending 
on 
books." 
First 
of 
all 
she 
would 
not 
tell 
me 
any 
more, 
but 
after 
a 
time 
she 
told 
me 
a 
good 
deal, 
especially 
the 
names 
of 
certain 
parts, 
and 
about 
fertilisation, 
and 
about 
the 
microscopic 
baby 
which 
really 
comes 
from 
the 
husband, 
and 
not 
as 
Hella 
and 
I 
had 
thought, 
from 
the 
wife. 
And 
how 
one 
knows 
whether 
a 
woman 
is 
fruitful. 
That 
is 
really 
an 
awful 
word. 
In 
fact 
almost 
every 
word 
has 
a 
second 
meaning 
of 
that 
sort, 
and 
what 
Dora 
says 
is 
quite 
true, 
one 
must 
be 
fearfully 
careful 
when 
one 
is 
talking. 
Dora 
thinks 
it 
would 
be 
best 
to 
make 
a 
list 
of 
all 
such 
words, 
but 
there 
are 
such 
a 
frightful 
lot 
of 
them 
that 
one 
never 
could. 
The 
only 
thing 
one 
can 
do 
is 
to 
be 
awfully 
careful; 
but 
one 
soon 
gets 
used 
to 
it. 
Still 
it 
happened 
to 
Dora 
the 
other 
day 
that 
she 
said 
to 
V.: 
I 
don't 
want 
any 
intercourse. 
And 
that 
really 
means 
"the 
utmost 
gifts 
of 
love," 
so 
Mad. 
told 
her. 
But 
V. 
was 
so 
well-mannered 
that 
he 
did 
not 
show 
that 
he 
noticed 
anything; 
and 
it 
did 
not 
occur 
to 
Dora 
until 
afterwards 
what 
she 
had 
said. 
It's 
really 
awfully 
stupid 
that 
every 
ordinary 
word 
should 
have 
such 
a 
meaning. 
I 
shall 
be 
so 
frightfully 
careful 
what 
I 
say 
now, 
so 
that 
I 
shan't 
use 
any 
word 
with 
two 
meanings. 
Mad. 
says 
it's 
just 
the 
same 
in 
French. 
We 
don't 
know 
whether 
it 
is 
the 
same 
in 
English 
and 
we 
could 
never 
dream 
of 
asking 
that 
awful 
fright, 
Miss 
Lundy. 
Very 
likely 
she 
does 
not 
know 
the 
first 
thing 
about 
it 
anyhow. 
I 
know 
a 
great 
deal 
more 
than 
Hella 
now, 
but 
I 
can't 
tell 
her 
because 
of 
betraying 
Dora 
and 
Mad. 
Perhaps 
I 
can 
give 
her 
a 
hint 
to 
be 
more 
careful 
in 
what 
she 
says, 
so 
as 
not 
to 
use 
any 
word 
with 
two 
meanings. 
That 
is 
really 
my 
duty 
as 
a 
friend. 


May 
23rd. 
I 
quite 
forgot. 
Last 
week 
Oswald 
had 
his 
written 
matriculation 



exam, 
he 
wrote 
a 
postcard 
every 
day 
and 
Mother 
was 
frightfully 
annoyed 
because 
he 
made 
such 
silly 
jokes 
all 
the 
time 
that 
we 
could 
not 
really 
tell 
how 
he 
got 
on. 
Dora 
and 
I 
are 
awfully 
excited 
because 
next 
Monday 
we 
are 
going 
to 
the 
aerodome 
with 
Frau 
Richter 
and 
her 
niece 
who 
is 
at 
the 
conservatoire. 
Lieutenant 
Streinz 
is 
going 
to 
fly 
too. 
Of 
course 
we'll 
motor 
out 
because 
the 
railway 
is 
not 
convenient. 
Of 
course 
Viktor 
will 
be 
there, 
but 
he 
is 
motoring 
over 
with 
some 
other 
officers. 
It's 
a 
great 
pity, 
for 
it 
would 
have 
been 
lovely 
if 
he'd 
been 
in 
our 
car. 
By 
the 
way, 
I 
saved 
the 
class 
to-day, 
the 
school 
inspector 
has 
been 
this 
week 
and 
examined 
our 
class 
first 
in 
History 
and 
then 
in 
German, 
and 
I 
was 
the 
only 
one 
who 
knew 
all 
that 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
had 
told 
us 
about 
the 
Origin 
of 
Fable. 
The 
insp. 
was 
very 
complimentary 
and 
afterwards 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
said: 
its 
quite 
true 
one 
can 
always 
depend 
upon 
Lainer; 
she's 
got 
a 
trustworthy 
memory. 
When 
we 
were 
walking 
home 
she 
was 
awfully 
nice: 
"Do 
you 
know, 
Lainer, 
I 
feel 
that 
I 
really 
must 
ask 
your 
pardon." 
I 
was 
quite 
puzzled 
and 
Hella 
asked: 
But 
why? 
She 
said: 
"It 
seemed 
to 
me 
this 
year 
that 
you 
were 
not 
taking 
quite 
so 
much 
interest 
in 
your 
German 
lessons 
as 
you 
did 
last 
year; 
but 
now 
you've 
reinstated 
yourself 
in 
my 
good 
opinion." 
Afterwards 
Hella 
said: 
I 
say 
you 
know, 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
is 
not 
so 
far 
wrong 
when 
I 
think 
of 
all 
that 
we 
used 
to 
read 
last 
year 
so 
that 
we 
might 
know 
everything 
when 
the 
lesson 
came, 
and 
when 
I 
think 
of 
what 
we 
do 
this 
year!!! 
You 
know 
very 
well--------. 
Hella 
is 
quite 
right, 
but 
still 
one 
can 
learn 
in 
spite 
of 
those 
things, 
one 
can't 
be 
always 
talking 
about 
them. 
And 
then 
it's 
quite 
easy 
to 
learn 
for 
such 
an 
angel 
as 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
Hella 
says 
that 
I 
got 
as 
red 
as 
a 
turkey 
cock 
from 
pride 
because 
I 
could 
say 
it 
all 
in 
the 
very 
words 
of 
Frau 
Doktor 
M., 
but 
it 
was 
not 
so, 
for 
first 
of 
all 
I 
was 
not 
a 
bit 
puffed 
up 
about 
it, 
and 
secondly 
I 
really 
don't 
know 
myself 
how 
I 
managed 
to 
say 
it 
all. 
I 
only 
felt 
that 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
is 
so 
annoyed 
when 
no 
one 
offers 
to 
answer 
a 
question, 
and 
so 
I 
took 
it 
on. 


May 
25th. 
Confound 
it, 
I 
could 
slap 
myself 
a 
hundred 
times. 
How 
could 
I 
be 
so 
stupid! 
Now 
we're 
not 
allowed 
to 
go 
to 
the 
aerodome. 
Father 
only 
let 
us 
go 
because 
Viktor 
is 
in 
Linz 
and 
Father 
believed 
he 
was 
going 
to 
stay 
there 
another 
fortnight. 
And 
at 
dinner 
to-day 
I 
made 
a 
slip 
and 
said: 
"It 
is 
a 
pity 
there's 
no 
room 
for 
five 
in 
our 
car. 
If 
Fraulein 
Else 
were 
not 
coming 
Lieutenant 
Richter 
could 
come 
with 
us." 
Dora 
kicked 
me 
under 
the 
table 
and 
I 
tried 
to 
brazen 
it 
out, 
but 
Father 
was 
so 
angry 
and 
said. 
"Hullo, 
is 
the 
flying 
man 
coming? 
No, 
no, 
children, 
nothing 
doing. 
I 
shall 
make 
your 
excuses 
to 



Frau 
Richter 
directly. 
I'm 
not 
having 
any, 
did 
not 
I 
tell 
you 
you 
weren't 
to 
see 
the 
fellow 
any 
more?" 
Of 
course 
this 
last 
was 
to 
Dora. 
Dora 
did 
not 
say 
anything 
but 
she 
did 
not 
eat 
any 
pudding 
or 
fruit, 
and 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
were 
back 
in 
our 
room 
she 
gave 
it 
me 
hot, 
saying: 
You 
did 
that 
on 
purpose, 
you 
little 
beast, 
but 
really 
you 
are 
only 
a 
child 
whom 
I 
never 
ought 
to 
have 
trusted, 
and 
so 
on. 
It's 
really 
too 
bad 
to 
say 
I 
did 
it 
on 
purpose, 
as 
if 
I 
envied 
her. 
Besides 
it's 
bad 
for 
me 
as 
well 
as 
for 
her, 
for 
I 
like 
him 
very 
much 
too, 
for 
he 
makes 
no 
difference 
between 
us 
and 
treats 
me 
exactly 
like 
Dora. 
Of 
course 
we 
are 
not 
on 
speaking 
terms 
now, 
and 
what 
infuriated 
me 
more 
than 
anything 
was 
that 
she 
said 
she 
grudged 
every 
word 
she 
had 
said 
to 
me 
in 
this 
connection: 
"Pearls 
before 
Swine." 
What 
a 
rude 
thing 
to 
say. 
So 
I 
am 
an 
S. 
But 
I 
should 
like 
to 
know 
who 
told 
most. 
I 
forsooth? 
Anyhow 
I'm 
quite 
sure 
that 
I 
shall 
never 
talk 
to 
her 
again 
about 
anything 
of 
that 
sort. 
Thank 
goodness 
I 
have 
a 
friend 
in 
Hella. 
She 
would 
never 
say 
or 
think 
anything 
of 
the 
kind 
of 
me. 


May 
26th. 
Neither 
of 
us 
could 
sleep 
a 
wink 
all 
night; 
Dora 
cried 
frightfully, 
I 
heard 
her 
though 
she 
tried 
to 
stifle 
it, 
and 
I 
cried 
too, 
for 
I 
was 
thinking 
all 
the 
time 
what 
I 
could 
do 
to 
prevent 
Viktor 
from 
thinking 
unkindly 
of 
me. 
That 
would 
be 
awful. 
Then 
I 
thought 
of 
something, 
and 
chance 
or 
I 
ought 
to 
say 
luck 
helped 
me. 
Viktor 
does 
not 
walk 
to 
school 
with 
us 
any 
longer, 
because 
the 
girls 
of 
the 
Fifth 
have 
seen 
us 
several 
times, 
but 
he 
comes 
to 
meet 
Dora 
when 
she 
comes 
away 
at 
1 
o'clock. 
So 
quite 
early 
I 
telephoned 
to 
him 
at 
a 
public 
telephone 
call 
office, 
for 
I 
did 
not 
dare 
to 
do 
it 
at 
home. 
Dora 
was 
so 
bad 
that 
she 
could 
not 
go 
to 
school 
so 
I 
was 
going 
alone 
with 
Hella. 
I 
telephoned 
saying 
a 
friend 
was 
ringing 
him 
up, 
that 
was 
when 
the 
maid 
answered 
the 
telephone, 
and 
then 
she 
called 
him. 
I 
told 
him: 
that 
whatever 
happened 
he 
was 
not 
to 
think 
unkindly 
of 
me 
and 
I 
must 
see 
him 
at 
1 
o'clock 
because 
Dora 
was 
ill. 
He 
must 
wait 
at 
the 
corner 
of 
----Street. 
All 
through 
lessons 
I 
was 
so 
upset 
that 
I 
don't 
in 
the 
least 
know 
what 
we 
did. 
And 
at 
1 
o'clock 
he 
was 
there 
all 
right, 
and 
I 
told 
him 
all 
about 
it 
and 
he 
was 
so 
awfully 
kind 
and 
he 
consoled 
me; 
he 
consoled 
me. 
That's 
quite 
different 
from 
the 
way 
Dora 
behaved. 
I 
was 
so 
much 
upset 
that 
I 
nearly 
cried, 
and 
then 
he 
drew 
me 
into 
a 
doorway 
and 
put 
his 
arm 
round 
me 
and 
with 
his 
own 
handkerchief 
wiped 
away 
my 
tears. 
I 
shall 
never 
tell 
Dora 
about 
that. 
Then 
he 
asked 
me 
to 
be 
awfully 
kind 
to 
Dora 
because 
she 
had 
such 
a 
lot 
to 
bear. 
I 
don't 
really 
know 
what 
she 
has 
to 
bear, 
but 
still, 
for 
his 
sake, 
because 
it's 



really 
worth 
doing 
it 
for 
that, 
after 
dinner 
I 
put 
a 
note 
upon 
her 
desk, 
saying: 


V. 
sends 
oceans 
of 
love 
to 
you 
and 
hopes 
you 
will 
be 
all 
right 
again 
by 
Monday. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
his 
best 
thanks 
for 
the 
book. 
I 
put 
the 
note 
in 
Heidepeter's 
Gabriel, 
which 
she 
had 
lent 
to 
me 
to 
read 
and 
put 
it 
down 
very 
significantly. 
When 
she 
read 
it 
she 
flushed 
up, 
swallowed 
a 
few 
times 
and 
said: 
"Have 
you 
seen 
him? 
Where 
was 
it 
and 
when?" 
Then 
I 
told 
her 
all 
about 
it 
and 
she 
was 
frightfully 
touched 
and 
said: 
"You 
really 
are 
a 
good 
girl, 
only 
frightfully 
undependable." 
What 
do 
you 
mean, 
undependable? 
She 
said: 
Yes 
undependable, 
for 
one 
simply 
must 
not 
blurt 
out 
things 
in 
that 
way; 
never 
mind, 
I 
will 
try 
to 
forget. 
Have 
you 
finished 
Heidepeter's 
Gabriel 
yet? 
"No," 
I 
said, 
"I'm 
not 
going 
to 
read 
anyone's 
book 
with 
whom 
I'm 
angry." 
In 
the 
end 
we 
made 
it 
up, 
but 
of 
course 
we 
did 
not 
talk 
any 
more 
about 
it 
and 
I 
did 
not 
say 
a 
word 
about 
that 
business 
with 
the 
handkerchief. 
May 
29th. 
On 
June 
10th 
or 
12th, 
Mother 
and 
Dora 
are 
going 
to 
Frazensbad, 
because 
they 
both 
have 
to 
take 
mud 
baths. 
Besides, 
Father 
says 
that 
a 
change 
will 
give 
Dora 
new 
thoughts, 
so 
that 
she 
won't 
go 
about 
hanging 
her 
head 
like 
a 
sick 
chicken. 
To-day 
Dora 
told 
me 
something 
very 
interesting. 
Unmarried 
men 
have 
little 
books 
and 
with 
these 
they 
can 
go 
to 
visit 
women 
"of 
a 
certain 
kind" 
in 
Graben 
and 
in 
the 
Karntnerstrasse. 
There, 
Dora 
says, 
they 
have 
to 
pay 
10 
florins 
or 
10 
crowns. 
In 
Dora's 
class 
there 
is 
a 
girl 
whose 
father 
is 
police 
surgeon, 
and 
they 
have 
all 
to 
be 
examined 
every 
month 
to 
see 
if 
they 
are 
healthy, 
and 
if 
not 
they 
can't 
visit 
these 
"ladies," 
and 
that's 
why 
the 
Preusses 
can 
never 
keep 
a 
servant. 
In 
my 
bath 
yesterday 
I 
noticed 
that 
I 
had 
a 
certain 
line, 
so 
I 
must 
be 
fr--. 
But 
I 
shan't 
have 
more 
than 
1 
or 
2 
children 
at 
most 
for 
the 
line 
is 
very 
faint. 
When 
I'm 
studying 
I 
often 
think 
of 
such 
things, 
and 
then 
I 
read 
a 
whole 
page 
and 
turn 
over 
and 
have 
not 
the 
remotest 
idea 
what 
I've 
been 
reading. 
It's 
very 
tiresome, 
for 
soon 
the 
other 
school 
insp. 
for 
maths. 
and 
the 
other 
subjects 
is 
coming, 
and 
I 
should 
not 
like 
to 
make 
a 
fool 
of 
myself; 
especially 
not 
because 
perhaps 
the 
inspectors 
talk 
us 
over 
with 
one 
another 
about 
who 
is 
clever 
and 
who 
stupid. 


May 
30th. 
The 
concert 
was 
glorious. 
When 
I 
hear 
such 
grand 
music 
I 
always 
have 
to 
keep 
myself 
well 
in 
hand 
for 
I 
fear 
I 
should 
cry. 
It's 
very 
stupid, 
of 
course, 
but 
at 
such 
times 
I 
can 
only 
think 
of 
sad 
things, 
even 
if 
it's 
just 
a 
small 
piece. 
Dora 
can 
play 
Brahms' 
Hungarian 
Dances, 
too, 
but 
that 
never 
makes 
me 
want 
to 
cry. 
I 
only 
get 
annoyed 
because 
I 
can't 
play 
them 
myself. 
I 
could 



all 
right, 
but 
I 
have 
not 
got 
patience 
to 
practice 
long 
enough. 
I 
never 
tell 
anyone 
that 
I 
want 
to 
cry 
when 
I 
am 
listening 
to 
music, 
not 
even 
Hella, 
though 
I 
tell 
her 
everything, 
except 
of 
course 
about 
Mad. 
Yesterday 
I 
made 
a 
fool 
of 
myself; 
at 
least 
so 
Dora 
says. 
I 
don't 
know 
how 
it 
happened, 
we 
were 
talking 
about 
books 
at 
supper, 
and 
I 
said: 
"What's 
the 
use 
of 
books, 
one 
can't 
learn 
anything 
out 
of 
them; 
everything 
is 
quite 
different 
from 
what 
they 
say 
in 
books." 
Then 
Father 
got 
in 
a 
wax 
and 
said: 
"You 
little 
duffer, 
you 
can 
thank 
your 
stars 
there 
are 
books 
from 
which 
you 
can 
learn 
something. 
Anyone 
who 
can't 
understand 
a 
book 
always 
says 
it 
is 
no 
good." 
Dora 
gave 
me 
a 
look, 
but 
I 
didn't 
know 
what 
she 
meant, 
and 
I 
went 
on: 
"Yes, 
but 
there's 
an 
awful 
lot 
that 
the 
encyclopedia 
puts 
all 
wrong." 
"What 
have 
you 
been 
ferreting 
in 
the 
encyclopedia 
for; 
we 
shall 
have 
to 
keep 
the 
key 
of 
the 
bookcase 
in 
a 
safer 
place." 
Thank 
goodness 
Dora 
came 
to 
my 
help 
and 
said: 
"Gretel 
wanted 
to 
look 
up 
something 
about 
the 
age 
of 
elephants 
and 
mammoths, 
but 
it's 
quite 
different 
in 
the 
encyclopedia 
from 
what 
Prof. 
Rigl 
told 
her 
last 
year." 
I 
was 
saved. 
Dora 
can 
act 
splendidly; 
I've 
noticed 
it 
before. 
In 
the 
evening 
she 
rowed 
me, 
and 
said: 
"You 
little 
goose, 
will 
you 
never 
learn 
caution; 
first 
that 
stupidity 
about 
Viktor 
and 
to-day 
this 
new 
blunder! 
I've 
helped 
you 
out 
of 
a 
hole 
once 
but 
I 
shan't 
do 
it 
again." 
And 
then 
she 
spent 
all 
the 
time 
writing 
a 
letter, 
to 
him 
of 
course--! 
Hella 
and 
I 
have 
just 
been 
reading 
a 
lot 
of 
things 
in 
the 
encycl., 
about 
Birth 
and 
Pregnancy, 
and 
I 
on 
my 
own 
about 
abor--; 
we 
came 
across 
the 
words 
Embyro 
and 
Foetus, 
and 
I 
said 
nothing 
at 
the 
time 
but 
tied 
2 
knots 
in 
my 
handkerchief 
to 
remind 
me, 
and 
yesterday 
I 
looked 
them 
up. 
Mad. 
need 
not 
be 
anxious 
even 
if 
she 
really 
did 
get 
like 
that. 
But 
every 
doctor 
knows 
about 
it 
and 
one 
often 
dies 
of 
it. 
I 
wonder 
if 
Mad. 
knows 
anything 
about 
it. 
We 
were 
talking 
about 
the 
differences 
between 
men 
and 
women, 
and 
it 
came 
out 
that 
when 
Hella 
has 
her 
bath 
she 
is 
still 
washed 
by 
Anna 
who 
has 
been 
with 
them 
for 
12 
years. 
Nothing 
would 
induce 
me 
to 
allow 
that, 
I 
would 
not 
let 
anyone 
wash 
me, 
except 
Mother; 
certainly 
not 
Dora, 
for 
I 
don't 
want 
her 
to 
know 
what 
I 
look 
like. 
The 
nurse 
in 
the 
hosp. 
told 
Hella 
that 
she 
is 
developed 
just 
like 
a 
little 
nymph, 
so 
lovely 
and 
symetrical. 
Hella 
says 
that 
is 
nothing 
unusual, 
that 
every 
girl 
looks 
like 
that, 
that 
the 
female 
body 
is 
Nature's 
Work 
of 
Art. 
Of 
course 
she's 
read 
that 
somewhere, 
for 
it 
does 
not 
really 
mean 
anything. 
Nature's 
work 
of 
art; 
it 
ought 
to 
be: 
a 
work 
of 
art 
made 
by 
husband 
and 
wife!!! 



May 
30th. 
Dora 
and 
Mother 
are 
going 
to 
Franzensbad 
on 
June 
6th, 
directly 
after 
Whitsuntide. 
Dora 
has 
got 
another 
new 
coat 
and 
skirt, 
grey 
with 
blue 
stripes; 
yesterday 
our 
white 
straw 
hats 
came, 
it 
suits 
me 
very 
well 
says 
Hella 
and 
everyone, 
with 
white 
ribbons 
and 
wild 
roses. 
There 
might 
have 
been 
a 
fearful 
row 
about 
what's 
just 
happened. 
When 
I 
went 
to 
telephone 
I 
had 
my 
Christmas 
umbrella 
with 
the 
rose-quartz 
handle 
and 
I 
left 
it 
in 
the 
telephone 
box; 
the 
girl 
in 
the 
tobacco 
shop 
found 
it 
there, 
and 
as 
she 
knows 
me 
she 
brought 
it 
here 
and 
gave 
it 
to 
the 
porter 
who 
brought 
it 
upstairs. 
Thank 
goodness 
it 
occurred 
to 
me 
at 
once 
to 
say 
that 
I 
went 
into 
the 
tobacco 
shop 
to 
buy 
stamps 
and 
I 
must 
have 
left 
it 
in 
the 
shop. 
No 
one 
noticed 
anything. 


May 
31st. 
They 
wanted 
me 
to 
go 
and 
stay 
with 
Hella 
for 
the 
month 
when 
Mother 
and 
Dora 
are 
away. 
It 
would 
be 
awfully 
nice, 
but 
I'm 
not 
going 
to, 
for 
I 
want 
to 
stay 
with 
Father. 
What 
would 
he 
do 
all 
alone 
at 
meal 
times, 
and 
whom 
would 
he 
have 
to 
talk 
to 
in 
the 
evenings? 
Father 
was 
really 
quite 
touched 
when 
I 
said 
this 
and 
he 
stroked 
my 
hair 
as 
he 
can 
and 
no 
one 
else, 
not 
even 
Mother. 
So 
I'm 
going 
to 
stay 
at 
home 
whatever 
happens. 
Flowers 
are 
very 
cheap 
now, 
so 
I 
shall 
put 
different 
flowers 
on 
the 
table 
every 
day, 
I 
shall 
go 
to 
the 
Market 
every 
day 
to 
buy 
a 
little 
posy, 
so 
that 
they 
can 
always 
be 
fresh. 
It 
would 
be 
stupid 
for 
me 
to 
go 
to 
the 
Brs., 
why 
should 
I, 
Resi 
has 
been 
with 
us 
for 
such 
a 
long 
time, 
she 
knows 
how 
to 
do 
everything 
even 
if 
Mother 
is 
not 
there 
and 
everything 
else 
I 
can 
arrange. 
Father 
won't 
want 
for 
anything. 


June 
1st. 
We've 
had 
such 
an 
experience 
to-day! 
It's 
awful; 
it's 
quite 
true 
then 
that 
one 
takes 
off 
every 
stitch 
when 
one 
is 
madly 
fond 
of 
anyone. 
I 
never 
really 
believed 
it, 
and 
I'm 
sure 
Dora 
did 
not, 
although 
Mad. 
hinted 
it 
to 
her; 
but 
it's 
true. 
We've 
seen 
it 
with 
our 
own 
eyes. 
I 
was 
just 
sitting 
and 
reading 
Storm's 
The 
Rider 
of 
the 
Grey 
Horse 
and 
Dora 
was 
arranging 
some 
writing 
paper 
to 
take 
to 
Franzensbad 
when 
Resi 
came 
and 
said: 
Fraulein 
Dora, 
please 
come 
here 
a 
moment, 
I 
want 
you 
to 
look 
at 
something! 
From 
the 
tone 
of 
her 
voice 
I 
saw 
there 
was 
something 
up 
so 
I 
went 
too. 
At 
first 
Resi 
would 
not 
say 
what 
it 
was 
but 
Dora 
was 
generous 
and 
said: 
"It's 
all 
right, 
you 
can 
say 
everything 
before 
her." 
Then 
we 
went 
into 
Resi's 
room 
and 
from 
behind 
the 
curtain 
peeped 
into 
the 
mezzanin. 
A 
young 
married 
couple 
live 
there!!! 
At 
least 
Resi 
says 
people 
say 
they 
are 
not 
really 
married, 
but 
simply 
live 
together!!!! 
And 
what 
we 
saw 
was 
awful. 
She 
was 
absolutely 
naked 
lying 
in 
bed 
without 
any 
of 
the 
clothes 
on, 
and 
he 
was 
kneeling 
by 
the 
bedside 
quite 



n--too, 
and 
he 
kissed 
her 
all 
over, 
everywhere!!! 
Dora 
said 
afterwards 
it 
made 
her 
feel 
quite 
sick. 
And 
then 
he 
stood 
up--no, 
I 
can't 
write 
it, 
it's 
too 
awful, 
I 
shall 
never 
forget 
it. 
So 
that's 
the 
way 
of 
it, 
it's 
simply 
frightful. 
I 
could 
never 
have 
believed 
it. 
Dora 
went 
as 
white 
as 
a 
sheet 
and 
trembled 
so 
that 
Resi 
was 
terribly 
frightened. 
I 
nearly 
cried 
with 
horror, 
and 
yet 
I 
could 
not 
help 
laughing 
too. 
I 
was 
really 
afraid 
he 
would 
stifle 
her 
because 
he's 
so 
big 
and 
she's 
so 
small. 
And 
Resi 
says 
he 
is 
certainly 
much 
too 
big 
for 
her, 
and 
that 
he 
nearly 
tears 
her. 
I 
don't 
know 
why 
he 
should 
tear 
her 
but 
certainly 
he 
might 
have 
crushed 
her. 
Dora 
was 
so 
terrified 
she 
had 
to 
sit 
down 
and 
Resi 
hurried 
to 
get 
her 
a 
glass 
of 
water, 
because 
she 
believed 
she 
was 
going 
to 
faint. 
I 
had 
not 
imagined 
it 
was 
anything 
like 
that, 
and 
Dora 
certainly 
had 
not 
either. 
Or 
she 
would 
never 
have 
trembled 
so. 
Still 
I 
really 
don't 
see 
why 
she 
should 
tremble 
like 
that. 
There 
is 
no 
reason 
to 
be 
frightened, 
one 
simply 
need 
not 
marry, 
and 
then 
one 
need 
never 
strip 
off 
every 
stitch, 
and 
oh 
dear, 
poor 
Mademoiselle 
who 
is 
so 
small 
and 
the 
lieutenant 
is 
very 
tall. 
But 
just 
think 
if 
anyone 
is 
as 
fat 
as 
Herr 
Richter 
or 
our 
landlord. 
Of 
course 
Herr 
Richter 
is 
at 
least 
50, 
but 
last 
January 
the 
landlord 
had 
another 
little 
girl, 
so 
something 
must 
have 
happened. 
No, 
I'm 
sure 
it's 
best 
not 
to 
marry, 
for 
it 
is 
really 
too 
awful. 
We 
did 
not 
look 
any 
more 
for 
then 
came 
the 
worst, 
suddenly 
Dora 
began 
to 
be 
actually 
sick, 
so 
that 
she 
could 
hardly 
get 
back 
to 
our 
room. 
If 
she 
had 
not 
been 
able 
to, 
everything 
would 
have 
come 
out. 
Mother 
sent 
for 
the 
doctor 
directly 
and 
he 
said 
that 
Dora 
was 
very 
much 
overworked; 
that 
it 
was 
a 
good 
thing 
she 
was 
going 
away 
from 
Vienna 
in 
a 
few 
days. 
No 
girl 
ought 
to 
study, 
it 
does 
not 
pay. 
Then 
he 
said 
to 
me: 
"You 
don't 
look 
up 
to 
much 
either. 
What 
are 
you 
so 
hollow-eyed 
for?" 
"I'm 
so 
frightened 
about 
Dora," 
I 
said. 
"Fiddlededee," 
said 
the 
doctor, 
"that 
does 
not 
give 
anyone 
black 
rings 
round 
the 
eyes." 
So 
it 
must 
be 
true 
that 
one 
gets 
to 
look 
ill 
when 
one 
always 
has 
to 
think 
about 
such 
things. 
But 
how 
can 
one 
help 
it, 
and 
Hella 
says: 
It's 
awfully 
interesting 
to 
have 
black 
rings 
under 
the 
eyes 
and 
men 
like 
it. 


We 
were 
going 
to 
make 
an 
excursion 
to-morrow 
to 
Kahlenberg 
and 
Hermannskogel, 
but 
probably 
it 
won't 
come 
off. 
Its 
11 
already 
and 
I'm 
fearfully 
tired 
from 
writing 
so 
much; 
I 
must 
go 
to 
bed. 
I 
do 
hope 
I 
Shall 
be 
able 
to 
sleep, 
but-------


June 
3rd. 
Father 
took 
Hella 
and 
me 
to 
Kahlenberg; 
we 
enjoyed 
ourselves 



tremendously. 
After 
dinner, 
when 
Father 
was 
reading 
the 
paper 
in 
the 
hotel, 
we 
went 
to 
pick 
flowers, 
and 
I 
told 
Hella 
all 
about 
what 
we'd 
seen 
on 
Friday. 
She 
was 
simply 
speechless, 
all 
the 
more 
since 
she 
had 
never 
heard 
what 
Mad. 
told 
us 
about 
taking 
off 
everything. 
She 
won't 
marry 
either, 
for 
it's 
too 
disagreeable, 
indeed 
too 
horrid.--The 
doctor 
said 
too: 
This 
perpetual 
learning 
is 
poisonous 
for 
young 
girls 
in 
the 
years 
of 
development. 
If 
he 
only 
knew 
what 
we 
had 
seen. 
Hella 
is 
frightfully 
annoyed 
that 
she 
was 
not 
there. 
She 
can 
be 
jolly 
glad, 
I 
don't 
want 
to 
see 
it 
a 
second 
time, 
and 
I 
shall 
never 
forget 
it 
all 
my 
life 
long; 
what 
I 
saw 
at 
the 
front 
door 
was 
nothing 
to 
this. 
Then 
Hella 
went 
on 
making 
jokes 
and 
said: 
"I 
say, 
just 
think 
if 
it 
had 
been 
Viktor." 
"Oh, 
do 
shut 
up," 
I 
screamed, 
and 
Father 
thought 
we 
were 
quarrelling 
and 
called 
out: 
"You 
two 
seem 
to 
be 
having 
a 
dispute 
in 
the 
grand 
style." 
If 
he'd 
only 
known 
what 
we 
were 
talking 
about!!! 
Oswald 
has 
been 
home 
since 
Friday 
evening; 
he 
did 
not 
arrive 
till 
half 
past 
10. 
But 
he 
did 
not 
come 
on 
the 
excursion 
with 
us 
yesterday, 
although 
Father 
would 
have 
liked 
him 
to; 
he 
said 
he 
would 
find 
it 
much 
too 
dull 
to 
spend 
the 
day 
with 
two 
"flappers;" 
that 
means 
that 
we're 
not 
grown 
up 
enough 
for 
him 
and 
is 
a 
piece 
of 
infernal 
cheek 
especially 
as 
regards 
Hella. 
She 
says 
she 
will 
simply 
ignore 
him 
in 
future. 
Since 
I 
am 
his 
sister 
I 
can't 
very 
well 
do 
that, 
but 
I 
shan't 
fetch 
and 
carry 
for 
him 
as 
he 
would 
like 
me 
to. 
He's 
no 
right 
to 
insult 
even 
his 
sister. 


Dora 
has 
just 
said 
to 
me: 
It's 
horrible 
that 
one 
has 
to 
endure 
that 
(you 
know 
what!!! 
--------) 
when 
one 
is 
married. 
Resi 
had 
told 
her 
about 
those 
two 
before, 
and 
that 
only 
the 
Jews 
do 
it 
just 
like 
that. 
She 
said 
that 
other 
people 
did 
not 
strip 
quite 
naked 
and 
that 
perhaps 
it's 
different 
in 
some 
other 
ways!! 
-----
But 
Mad. 
implied 
that 
it 
was 
just 
that 
way, 
only 
she 
did 
not 
say 
anything 
about 
the 
crushing; 
but 
I 
suppose 
that's 
because 
of 
the 
cruelty 
of 
the 
Jews-----. 
I'm 
afraid 
every 
night 
that 
I'm 
going 
to 
dream 
about 
it, 
and 
Dora 
has 
dreamed 
about 
it 
already. 
She 
says 
that 
whenever 
she 
closes 
her 
eyes 
she 
sees 
it 
all 
as 
if 
it 
were 
actually 
before 
her. 


June 
4th. 
We 
understand 
now 
what 
Father 
meant 
the 
other 
day 
when 
he 
was 
speaking 
about 
Dr. 
Diller 
and 
his 
wife 
and 
said: 
"But 
they 
don't 
suit 
one 
another 
at 
all." 
I 
thought 
at 
the 
time 
he 
only 
meant 
that 
it 
looks 
so 
absurd 
for 
so 
tiny 
a 
woman 
to 
go 
about 
with 
a 
big 
strong 
man. 
But 
that's 
only 
a 
minor 
thing; 
the 
main 
point 
is 
something 
quite 
different!!!! 
Hella 
and 
I 
look 
at 
all 
couples 
now 
who 
go 
by 
arm 
in 
arm, 
thinking 
about 
them 
from 
that 
point 
of 



view, 
and 
it 
amuses 
us 
so 
much 
as 
we 
are 
going 
home 
that 
we 
can 
hardly 
keep 
from 
laughing. 
But 
really 
it's 
no 
laughing 
matter, 
especially 
for 
the 
woman. 


June 
5th. 
This 
morning 
Mother 
took 
Dora 
with 
her 
to 
pay 
a 
farewell 
call 
at 
the 
Richter's. 
But 
there 
was 
no 
one 
at 
home, 
that 
is 
Frau 
R. 
was 
certainly 
at 
home, 
but 
said 
she 
was 
not 
because 
they 
are 
very 
much 
offended 
with 
Father. 
In 
the 
afternoon 
Dora 
and 
I 
had 
a 
lot 
of 
things 
to 
get, 
and 
we 
met 
Viktor, 
by 
arrangement 
of 
course. 
Dora 
cried 
a 
lot; 
they 
went 
into 
the 
Minorite 
church 
while 
I 
went 
for 
a 
walk 
in 
Kohlmarkt 
and 
Herrengasse. 
He 
is 
going 
to 
America 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
July, 
before 
Dora 
comes 
home. 
He 
has 
given 
her 
some 
exquisite 
notepaper 
stamped 
with 
his 
regimental 
arms, 
specially 
for 
her 
to 
write 
to 
him 
on, 
and 
a 
locket 
with 
his 
portrait. 
To-morrow 
she 
is 
going 
to 
send 
him 
her 
photo, 
through 
me, 
I 
shall 
be 
awfully 
glad 
to 
take 
it. 
Dora 
has 
been 
much 
nicer 
to 
me 
lately. 


June 
6th. 
Mother 
and 
Dora 
left 
early 
this 
morning. 
Mother 
has 
never 
gone 
away 
from 
us 
before 
for 
long 
at 
a 
time, 
so 
I 
cried 
a 
lot 
and 
so 
did 
she. 
Dora 
cried 
too, 
but 
I 
know 
on 
whose 
account. 
Father 
and 
I 
are 
alone 
now. 
At 
dinner 
he 
said 
to 
me: 
"My 
little 
housewife." 
It 
was 
so 
lovely. 
But 
it's 
frightfully 
quiet 
in 
the 
house, 
for 
2 
people 
don't 
talk 
so 
much 
as 
4. 
It 
made 
me 
feel 
quite 
uncomfortable. 
To-day 
I 
talked 
several 
things 
over 
with 
Resi. 
What 
I 
think 
worst 
of 
all 
is 
that 
one 
saw 
the 
whole 
of 
his 
behind, 
it 
was 
really 
disgusting. 
Dora 
said 
the 
other 
day 
she 
thought 
it 
was 
positively 
infamous. 
Resi 
said 
they 
might 
at 
least 
have 
pulled 
down 
the 
blind 
so 
that 
nobody 
could 
see 
in, 
that's 
what 
respectable 
people 
would 
do. 
But 
respectable 
people 
simply 
would 
not 
strip, 
or 
at 
least 
they'd 
cover 
themselves 
respectably 
with 
the 
bedclothes. 
Then 
Resi 
told 
me 
some 
more 
about 
the 
bank 
clerk 
and 
his 
wife, 
that 
is 
not-wife. 
She 
does 
not 
know 
if 
her 
parents 
know 
about 
it, 
and 
what 
excuse 
she 
makes 
for 
not 
living 
at 
home. 
She 
is 
not 
a 
Jewess, 
though 
he 
is 
a 
Jew. 
Resi 
absolutely 
curled 
up 
with 
laughing 
because 
I 
said: 
Ah, 
that 
is 
why 
he 
insists 
that 
they 
shall 
both 
strip 
though 
ordinarily 
only 
the 
wife 
has 
to 
strip." 
But 
she 
herself 
said 
a 
little 
while 
ago 
that 
only 
Jews 
do 
it 
that 
way, 
and 
to-day 
she 
laughed 
as 
if 
I 
were 
talking 
utter 
nonsense. 
Really 
she 
does 
not 
know 
exactly 
herself, 
and 
she 
cloaks 
it 
with 
laughter 
because 
she's 
annoyed, 
first 
because 
she 
does 
not 
know, 
and 
then 
also 
I'm 
sure 
because 
she 
really 
began 
to 
talk 
about 
the 
matter. 
One 
thing 
that 
puzzles 
me 
is 
that 
I 
never 



dream 
about 
it. 
I 
should 
like 
to 
know 
whether 
perhaps 
Dora 
never 
really 
dreamed 
of 
it, 
though 
she 
pretended 
she 
did. 
As 
for 
Hella 
saying 
she 
dreamed 
of 
it 
the 
day 
before 
yesterday, 
I'm 
sure 
that 
was 
pure 
invention, 
for 
she 
was 
not 
there 
at 
all. 
She 
says 
it's 
a 
good 
thing 
she 
was 
not 
for 
if 
she 
had 
been 
she 
would 
have 
burst 
out 
laughing. 
But 
I 
fancy 
if 
she'd 
seen 
what 
we 
saw 
she 
would 
have 
found 
there 
was 
nothing 
to 
laugh 
at. 


June 
7th. 
It's 
frightfully 
dull 
after 
dinner 
and 
in 
the 
evening 
before 
bed 
time, 
especially 
because 
this 
year, 
since 
the 
affair 
at 
the 
front 
door, 
Dora 
and 
I 
have 
always 
had 
plenty 
to 
talk 
about. 
I 
miss 
it. 
I 
wish 
Hella 
would 
come 
and 
stay 
with 
us 
for 
the 
4 
weeks. 
But 
she 
does 
not 
want 
to. 
Father 
had 
work 
to 
do 
today, 
so 
I'm 
quite 
alone 
and 
feel 
as 
if 
I'd 
like 
to 
cry. 


June 
9th. 
Yesterday, 
when 
I 
was 
feeling 
so 
melancholy, 
Resi 
came 
to 
make 
my 
bed, 
and 
we 
talked 
about 
the 
married 
couple 
opposite, 
and 
then 
she 
told 
me 
awful 
things 
about 
a 
young 
married 
couple 
where 
she 
was 
once. 
She 
left 
because 
they 
always 
went 
into 
the 
bath 
together; 
she 
says 
she's 
certain 
that 
something 
happened 
there. 
And 
then 
she 
told 
me 
about 
an 
old 
gentleman 
who 
made 
advances 
to 
her; 
but 
of 
course 
she 
would 
not 
have 
anything 
to 
do 
with 
him; 
besides 
he 
was 
married, 
and 
anyhow 
he 
would 
never 
have 
married 
a 
servant 
for 
he 
was 
a 
privy 
councillor. 
Yesterday 
Father 
said: 
Poor 
little 
witch, 
it's 
very 
lonely 
for 
you 
now; 
but 
look 
here, 
Resi 
is 
no 
fit 
company 
for 
you; 
when 
your 
little 
tongue 
wants 
to 
wag, 
come 
to 
my 
room. 
And 
I 
was 
awfully 
stupid, 
I 
began 
to 
cry 
like 
anything 
and 
said. 
"Father, 
please 
don't 
be 
angry, 
I'll 
never 
think 
and 
never 
talk 
of 
such 
things 
any 
more." 
Father 
did 
not 
know 
at 
first 
what 
I 
meant, 
but 
afterwards 
it 
must 
have 
struck 
him, 
for 
he 
was 
so 
kind 
and 
gentle, 
and 
said: 
"No, 
no, 
Gretel, 
don't 
corrupt 
your 
youth 
with 
such 
matters, 
and 
when 
there's 
anything 
that 
bothers 
you, 
ask 
Mother, 
but 
not 
the 
servants. 
A 
girl 
of 
good 
family 
must 
not 
be 
too 
familiar 
with 
servants. 
Promise 
me." 
And 
then, 
though 
I'm 
so 
big 
he 
took 
me 
on 
his 
knee 
like 
a 
child 
and 
petted 
me 
because 
I 
was 
crying 
so. 
"It's 
all 
right, 
little 
Mouse, 
don't 
worry, 
you 
must 
not 
get 
so 
nervous 
as 
Dora. 
Give 
me 
a 
nice 
kiss, 
and 
then 
I'll 
come 
with 
you 
to 
your 
room 
and 
stay 
with 
you 
till 
you 
go 
to 
sleep. 
Of 
course 
I 
stayed 
awake 
on 
purpose 
as 
long 
as 
I 
could, 
till 
a 
quarter 
to 
11. 


And 
then 
I 
dreamed 
that 
Father 
was 
lying 
in 
Dora's 
bed 
so 
that 
when 
I 
woke 
up 
early 
in 
the 
morning 
I 
really 
looked 
across 
to 
see 
if 
he 
had 
not 
gone 
to 
bed 



there. 
But 
of 
course 
I'd 
only 
dreamed 
it. 


June 
12th. 
To-morrow 
there's 
a 
great 
school 
excursion; 
I 
am 
so 
glad, 
a 
whole 
day 
with 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
and 
without 
any 
lessons. 
We 
are 
going 
up 
Eisernes 
Tor. 
Last 
year 
there 
was 
no 
outing, 
because 
the 
Fourth 
did 
not 
want 
to 
go 
to 
the 
Anninger, 
but 
to 
the 
Hochschneeberg, 
and 
the 
Head 
did 
not 
want 
to 
go 
there. 


June 
13th. 
We 
had 
a 
lovely 
outing. 
Hella 
and 
I 
spent 
the 
whole 
day 
with 
Frau 
Doktor 
M.; 
in 
the 
afternoon 
Franke 
said: 
I 
say, 
why 
do 
you 
stick 
to 
Frau 
Doktor 
like 
that? 
One 
can't 
get 
a 
word 
with 
you. 
So 
then 
we 
went 
for 
a 
good 
walk 
through 
the 
forest 
with 
Franke 
and 
she 
told 
us 
about 
a 
student 
who 
is 
in 
the 
Eighth 
now 
and 
who 
is 
madly 
in 
love 
with 
her. 
For 
all 
students 
are 
in 
love 
with 
her, 
so 
she 
says. 
We 
were 
not 
much 
interested 
in 
that, 
but 
then 
she 
told 
us 
that 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
is 
secretly 
engaged 
to 
a 
professor 
in 
Leipzig 
or 
some 
other 
town 
in 
Germany. 
Her 
cousin 
is 
Frau 
Doktor's 
dressmaker, 
and 
she 
is 
quite 
certain 
of 
it. 
Her 
parents 
are 
opposed 
to 
it 
because 
he 
is 
a 
Jew 
but 
they 
are 
frantically 
in 
love 
with 
one 
another 
and 
they 
intend 
to 
marry. 
And 
then 
we 
asked 
Franke, 
since 
she 
is 
a 
Jewess 
too 
whether 
it 
was 
all 
true 
what 
Mali, 
who 
was 
here 
when 
Resi 
was 
in 
hospital, 
had 
told 
us 
about 
the 
Jews. 
And 
Franke 
said: 
Oh 
yes, 
it 
is 
true 
I 
can 
confirm 
it 
in 
every 
point. 
But 
it's 
not 
so 
bad 
about 
the 
cruelty, 
every 
man 
is 
cruel, 
especially 
in 
this 
matter." 
No 
doubt 
she's 
right, 
but 
it's 
horrible 
to 
think 
that 
our 
lovely 
and 
refined 
Frau 
Doktor 
M 
is 
going 
to 
have 
a 
cruel 
husband. 
Hella 
says 
that 
if 
she 
is 
satisfied, 
I 
don't 
need 
to 
get 
excited 
about 
it. 
But 
perhaps 
she 
does 
not 
know 
that------. 
When 
we 
came 
out 
of 
the 
wood 
the 
Herr 
Religionsprofessor 
who 
is 
awfully 
fond 
of 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
called 
out: 
"Frau 
Doktor, 
you 
have 
lost 
your 
two 
satellites!" 
And 
everybody 
laughed 
because 
we'd 
come 
back. 
Father 
came 
to 
fetch 
Hella 
and 
me, 
and 
since 
it 
was 
nearly 
11 
o'clock 
Hella 
stayed 
the 
night 
with 
us. 
It 
was 
awfully 
nice, 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
I 
was 
sorry 
because 
I 
could 
not 
have 
any 
more 
talk 
with 
Father. 
When 
we 
were 
getting 
up 
in 
the 
morning 
we 
splashed 
one 
another 
and 
played 
the 
fool 
generally, 
so 
that 
we 
were 
nearly 
late 
for 
school. 
The 
staff 
was 
still 
in 
high 
spirits, 
including 
Professor 
Wilke, 
about 
whom 
we 
had 
not 
bothered 
ourselves 
all 
day; 
that 
is 
he 
did 
not 
come 
until 
the 
afternoon 
when 
he 
came 
to 
meet 
us 
on 
our 
way. 
We 
believe 
he 
is 
in 
love 
with 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
too, 
for 
he 
went 
about 
with 
her 
all 
the 
time, 
and 
it 
was 
probably 
on 
her 
account 
that 
he 
came. 
None 
of 
the 
other 
professors 
were 



there, 
for 
they 
were 
all 
taking 
their 
classes 
in 
the 
different 
Gymnasiums. 


June 
14th. 
I 
am 
so 
excited. 
We 
were 
going 
to 
school 
to-day 
at 
9 
and 
suddenly 
we 
heard 
a 
tremendous 
rattling 
with 
a 
sword; 
that 
is 
Hella 
heard 
it, 
for 
she 
always 
notices 
that 
sort 
of 
thing 
before 
I 
do, 
and 
she 
said: 
"Hullo, 
that's 
an 
o-in 
a 
frightful 
hurry, 
and 
looked 
round; 
"I 
say, 
there's 
Viktor 
behind 
us" 
and 
he 
really 
was, 
he 
was 
saluting 
us 
and 
he 
said: 
Fraulein 
Rita, 
can 
you 
give 
me 
a 
moment; 
you'll 
excuse 
me 
won't 
you, 
Fraulein 
Hella? 
He 
always 
calls 
me 
Rita, 
and 
it 
shows 
what 
a 
nice 
refined 
kind 
of 
a 
man 
he 
is 
that 
he 
should 
know 
my 
friend's 
name. 
Hella 
said 
directly: 
"Don't 
mention 
it, 
Herr 
Oberleutenant, 
don't 
let 
me 
be 
in 
your 
way 
if 
it's 
anything 
important," 
and 
she 
went 
over 
to 
the 
other 
side 
of 
the 
street. 
He 
looked 
after 
her 
and 
said: 
"What 
a 
lovely, 
well-mannered 
young 
lady 
your 
friend 
is." 
Then 
he 
came 
back 
to 
the 
main 
point 
He 
has 
already 
had 
2 
letters 
from 
Dora, 
but 
not 
an 
answer 
to 
his 
letter, 
because 
she 
can't 
fetch 
it 
from 
the 
post 
office, 
poste 
restante. 
Then 
he 
implored 
me 
to 
enclose 
a 
letter 
from 
him 
in 
mine 
to 
Dora. 
But 
since 
Mother 
naturally 
reads 
my 
letters, 
I 
told 
him 
it 
was 
not 
so 
simple 
as 
all 
that; 
but 
I 
knew 
of 
a 
splendid 
way 
out 
of 
the 
difficulty; 
I 
would 
write 
to 
Mother 
and 
Dora 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
so 
that 
Dora 
could 
get 
hold 
of 
his 
letter 
while 
Mother 
was 
not 
noticing. 
Viktor 
was 
awfully 
pleased 
and 
said: 
You're 
a 
genius 
and 
a 
first-class 
little 
schemer, 
and 
kissed 
my 
hand. 
Still, 
he 
might 
have 
left 
out 
the 
"little." 
If 
one's 
is 
so 
little, 
one 
can't 
very 
well 
be 
a 
schemer. 
From 
the 
other 
side 
of 
the 
street 
Hella 
saw 
him 
kiss 
my 
hand. 
She 
says 
I 
did 
not 
try 
to 
draw 
it 
away, 
but 
held 
it 
out 
to 
him 
like 
a 
grand 
lady 
and 
even 
dropped 
it 
at 
the 
wrist. 
She 
says 
we 
girls 
of 
good 
family 
do 
that 
sort 
of 
thing 
by 
instinct. 
It 
may 
be 
so, 
for 
I 
certainly 
did 
not 
do 
it 
intentionally. 
In 
the 
afternoon 
I 
wrote 
the 
two 
letters, 
just 
the 
ordinary 
one 
to 
Mother 
and 
a 
short 
one 
to 
Dora 
with 
the 
enclosure, 
and 
took 
it 
to 
the 
post 
myself. 


June 
16th. 
I've 
already 
got 
so 
used 
to 
being 
alone 
with 
Father 
that 
I 
take 
it 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
course. 
We 
often 
drive 
in 
the 
Prater, 
or 
go 
in 
the 
evening 
to 
have 
supper 
in 
one 
of 
the 
parks, 
and 
of 
course 
Hella 
comes 
with 
us. 
I 
am 
frightfully 
excited 
to 
know 
what 
Dora 
will 
write. 
I 
forgot 
to 
write 
in 
my 
diary 
the 
other 
day 
that 
I 
asked 
Viktor 
if 
he 
was 
really 
going 
to 
New 
York. 
He 
said 
he 
had 
no 
idea 
of 
doing 
anything 
of 
the 
kind, 
that 
had 
only 
been 
a 
false 
alarm 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
Old 
Man. 
That's 
what 
he 
calls 
his 
father. 
I 
don't 
think 
it's 
very 
nice 
of 
him, 
a 
little 
vulgar, 
and 
perhaps 
that 
is 
why 
Father 
can't 
stand 



him. 
In 
fact 
Father 
does 
not 
like 
any 
officers 
very 
much, 
except 
Hella's 
father, 
but 
then 
he's 
fairly 
old 
already. 
I 
say, 
Hella 
mustn't 
read 
that, 
it 
would 
put 
her 
in 
an 
awful 
wax; 
but 
her 
father 
really 
is 
at 
least 
4 
or 
5 
years 
older 
than 
Father. 


June 
17th. 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
is 
ill, 
but 
we 
don't 
know 
what's 
the 
matter 
with 
her. 
We 
were 
all 
frightfuly 
dull 
at 
school. 
The 
head 
took 
her 
classes 
and 
we 
were 
left 
to 
ourselves 
in 
the 
interval. 
I 
do 
hope 
she 
has 
not 
got 
appendicitis, 
that 
would 
be 
awful. 


June 
18th. 
She 
isn't 
back 
yet. 
Frau 
Doktor 
Steiner 
says 
she 
has 
very 
bad 
tonsillitis 
and 
won't 
be 
able 
to 
come 
for 
at 
least 
a 
week. 


June 
19th. 
There 
was 
a 
letter 
from 
Dora 
to-day. 
I'm 
furious. 
Not 
a 
word 
about 
my 
sisterly 
affection, 
but 
only: 
"Many 
thanks 
for 
your 
trouble." 
It's 
really 
too 
bad; 
he 
is 
quite 
different!! 
I 
shan't 
forget 
this 
in 
a 
hurry. 
Hella 
says 
that 
she 
only 
hinted 
at 
it 
like 
that 
to 
be 
on 
the 
safe 
side. 
But 
it's 
not 
true, 
for 
she 
knows 
perfectly 
well 
that 
Father 
never 
reads 
our 
letters. 
She 
simply 
takes 
it 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
course. 
Yesterday 
was 
the 
first 
time 
I 
stayed 
away 
from 
school 
since 
I 
went 
to 
the 
High 
School. 
Early 
in 
the 
morning 
I 
had 
such 
a 
bad 
sore 
throat 
and 
a 
headache, 
so 
Father 
would 
not 
let 
me 
go. 
I 
got 
better 
as 
the 
day 
went 
on, 
but 
this 
morning 
I 
was 
worse 
again. 
Most 
likely 
I 
shall 
have 
to 
stay 
at 
home 
for 
2 
or 
3 
days. 
Father 
wanted 
to 
send 
for 
the 
doctor, 
but 
it 
really 
was 
not 
necessary. 


June 
20th. 
When 
Resi 
was 
doing 
our 
room 
to 
day 
she 
wanted 
to 
begin 
talking 
once 
more 
about 
various 
things, 
but 
I 
said 
I 
did 
not 
particularly 
care 
to 
hear 
about 
such 
matters, 
and 
then 
she 
implored 
me 
never 
to 
tell 
Mother 
and 
Father 
anything 
about 
what 
she 
had 
said 
to 
us 
about 
the 
young 
married 
couple; 
she 
said 
she 
would 
lose 
her 
place 
and 
she 
would 
be 
awfully 
sorry 
to 
do 
that. 


June 
21st. 
My 
knees 
are 
still 
trembling; 
there 
might 
have 
been 
a 
frightful 
row; 
luckily 
Father 
was 
out. 
At 
half 
past 
6, 
when 
Hella 
and 
I 
were 
having 
a 
talk, 
the 
telephone 
bell 
rang. 
Luckily 
Resi 
had 
gone 
out 
too 
to 
fetch 
something 
so 
I 
answered 
the 
telephone, 
and 
it 
was 
Viktor! 
"I 
must 
see 
you 
tomorrow 
morning 
early 
or 
at 
1 
o'clock; 
I 
waited 
for 
you 
in 
vain 
at 
1 
to-day." 
Of 
course, 
for 
I 
was 
still 
ill, 
that 
is 
still 
am 
ill. 
But 
well 
or 
ill 
I 
must 
go 
to 
school 
to-morrow. 
If 
Father 
had 
been 
at 
home; 
or 
even 
Resi, 
she 
might 
have 



noticed 
something. 
It 
would 
have 
been 
very 
disagreeable 
if 
I 
had 
had 
to 
ask 
her 
not 
to 
give 
me 
away. 
Hella 
was 
frightfully 
cheeky, 
she 
took 
the 
receiver 
out 
of 
my 
hand 
and 
said: 
"Please 
don't 
do 
this 
again, 
it's 
frightfully 
risky 
for 
my 
friend." 
I 
was 
rather 
annoyed 
with 
her, 
but 
Hella 
said 
he 
certainly 
deserved 
a 
lecture. 


To-morrow 
we 
are 
going 
to 
a 
concert 
and 
I 
shall 
wear 
my 
new 
white 
dress. 
It 
does 
look 
rather 
nice 
after 
all 
for 
sisters 
to 
be 
dressed 
alike. 
I've 
taken 
to 
wearing 
snails,"[3] 
Father 
calls 
them 
"cow-pats;" 
but 
everyone 
else 
says 
it's 
exceedingly 
becoming.

Flat

Note. 
June 
22nd. 
He 
was 
awfully 
charming 
when 
he 
came 
up 
to 
us 
and 
said: 
"Can 
a 
repentant 
sinner 
be 
received 
back 
into 
grace?" 
And 
he 
gave 
each 
of 
us 
a 
lovely 
rose. 
Then 
he 
handed 
me 
a 
letter 
and 
said: 
"I 
don't 
think 
we 
need 
make 
any 
secret 
before 
your 
energetic 
friend." 
Really 
I 
did 
not 
want 
to 
forward 
any 
more 
letters 
but 
I 
did 
not 
know 
how 
to 
say 
so 
without 
offending 
him, 
for 
Dora's 
cheek 
is 
not 
his 
fault, 
and 
I 
did 
not 
want 
to 
say 
anything 
to-day, 
1 
because 
of 
the 
roses, 
and 
2 
because 
Hella 
was 
there. 
There 
can't 
be 
more 
than 
2 
or 
3 
times 
more, 
so 
I 
shan't 
bother. 
But 
Dora 
doesn't 
deserve 
it, 
really. 
Franke 
is 
a 
vulgar 
girl. 
She 
saw 
us 
together 
the 
other 
day, 
and 
the 
next 
day 
she 
asked: 
Where 
did 
you 
pick 
up 
that 
handsome 
son 
of 
Mars? 
Hella 
retorted: 
"Don't 
use 
such 
common 
expressions 
when 
you 
are 
speaking 
of 
Rita's 
cousin." 
"Oh, 
a 
cousin, 
that's 
why 
he 
kisses 
her 
hand 
I 
suppose?" 
Since 
then 
we 
only 
speak 
to 
Franke 
when 
we 
are 
positively 
obliged. 
Not 
to 
speak 
to 
her 
at 
all 
would 
be 
too 
dangerous, 
you 
never 
can 
tell; 
but 
if 
we 
speak 
only 
a 
little, 
she 
can't 
take 
offence. 


June 
23rd. 
The 
school 
insp. 
came 
yesterday, 
the 
old 
one 
who 
always 
comes 
for 
Maths. 
He 
is 
so 
kind 
and 
gentle 
that 
all 
the 
girls 
can 
answer 
everything; 
we 
like 
him 
better 
than 
the 
one 
who 
comes 
for 
languages. 
Verbenowitsch 
was 
awfully 
puffed 
up 
because 
he 
praised 
her. 
Good 
Lord, 
I've 
been 
praised 
often 
enough, 
but 
that 
does 
not 
make 
me 
conceited. 
Anyhow 
he 
did 
not 
call 
on 
me 
yesterday 
because 
I'd 
been 
absent 
4 
days. 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
came 
back 
to-day. 
She 
looks 
awfully 
pale 
and 
wretched, 
I 
don't 
know 
why; 
it's 
such 
a 
pity 
that 
she 
does 
not 
let 
us 
walk 
home 
with 
her, 
except 
last 
year 
when 
there 
was 
all 
that 
fuss 
about 
Fraulein 
St.'s 
bead 
bag. 
She 
bows 
to 
us 
all 
very 
politely 
when 



we 
salute 
her, 
but 
she 
won't 
walk 
with 
any 
of 
the 
pupils, 
though 
Verbenowitsch 
is 
horribly 
pushing 
and 
is 
always 
hanging 
about 
on 
the 
chance. 


June 
26th. 
It's 
really 
stupid 
how 
anxious 
I 
am 
now 
at 
Communion 
lest 
the 
host 
should 
drop 
out 
of 
my 
mouth. 
I 
was 
so 
anxious 
I 
was 
very 
nearly 
sick. 
Hella 
says 
there 
must 
be 
some 
reason 
for 
it, 
but 
I 
don't 
know 
of 
any, 
except 
that 
the 
accident 
which 
that 
girl 
Lutter 
in 
the 
Third 
had 
made 
me 
even 
more 
anxious 
that 
I 
was 
before. 
Hella 
says 
I'd 
better 
turn 
Protestant, 
but 
nothing 
would 
induce 
me 
to 
do 
that; 
for 
after 
Com. 
one 
feels 
so 
pure 
and 
so 
much 
better 
than 
one 
was 
before. 
But 
I'm 
sorry 
to 
say 
it 
does 
not 
last 
so 
long 
as 
it 
ought 
to. 


June 
27th. 
Mother 
is 
really 
ill. 
Father 
told 
me 
about 
it. 
He 
was 
awfully 
nice 
and 
said: 
If 
only 
your 
Mother 
is 
spared 
to 
us. 
She 
is 
far 
from 
well. 
Then 
I 
asked: 
Father, 
what 
is 
really 
wrong 
with 
Mother? 
And 
Father 
said: 
"Well, 
dear, 
it's 
a 
hidden 
trouble, 
which 
has 
really 
been 
going 
on 
for 
a 
long 
time 
and 
has 
now 
suddenly 
broken 
out." 
"Will 
she 
have 
to 
have 
an 
operation?" 
"We 
hope 
we 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
avoid 
that. 
But 
it's 
a 
terrible 
thing 
that 
Mother 
should 
be 
so 
ill." 
Father 
looked 
so 
miserable 
when 
he 
said 
this 
that 
I 
did 
my 
best 
to 
console 
him 
and 
said: 
But 
surely 
the 
mud 
baths 
will 
make 
her 
all 
right, 
or 
why 
should 
she 
take 
them?" 
And 
Father 
said: 
"Well, 
darling, 
we'll 
hope 
for 
the 
best." 
We 
went 
on 
talking 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
saying 
that 
Mother 
must 
take 
all 
possible 
care 
of 
herself, 
and 
that 
perhaps 
in 
the 
autumn 
Aunt 
Dora 
would 
come 
here 
to 
keep 
house. 
I 
asked 
Father, 
"Is 
it 
true 
that 
you 
don't 
like 
Aunt 
Dora?" 
Father 
said: 
"Not 
a 
bit 
of 
it, 
what 
put 
that 
idea 
into 
your 
head?" 
So 
I 
said: 
"But 
you 
do 
like 
Mother 
much 
better, 
don't 
you?" 
Father 
laughed 
and 
said: 
"You 
little 
goose, 
of 
course 
I 
do, 
or 
I 
should 
have 
married 
Aunt 
Dora 
and 
not 
Mother." 
I 
should 
have 
liked 
awfully 
to 
ask 
Father 
a 
lot 
more, 
but 
I 
did 
not 
dare. 
I 
really 
do 
miss 
Dora, 
especially 
in 
the 
evenings. 


July 
2nd. 
I 
was 
in 
a 
tremendous 
rage 
at 
school 
to-day. 
Professor 
W., 
the 
traitor, 
did 
not 
come 
because 
he 
had 
confession 
and 
communion 
in 
the 
Gymnasium, 
and 
the 
matron 
did 
not 
know 
anything 
about 
the 
subject 
so 
there 
was 
no 
one 
to 
take 
his 
class. 
Then 
the 
Herr 
Religionsprofessor 
took 
it, 
he 
had 
come 
earlier 
than 
usual 
to 
write 
up 
the 
reports. 
But 
since 
the 
Jewish 
girls 
were 
there 
too, 
of 
course 
there 
was 
no 
religion 
lesson. 
But 
the 
H. 
Rel. 
Prof. 



had 
a 
chat 
with 
us. 
He 
asked 
each 
of 
us 
where 
we 
were 
going 
to 
spend 
the 
summer, 
and 
when 
I 
said 
I 
was 
going 
to 
Rodaun, 
Weinberger 
said: 
I 
say, 
only 
to 
Rodaun! 
and 
several 
of 
the 
other 
girls 
chimed 
in: 
Only 
to 
Rodaun; 
why 
that's 
only 
a 
drive 
on 
the 
steam 
tram. 
I 
was 
frightfully 
annoyed, 
for 
we 
generally 
go 
to 
Tyrol 
or 
Styria; 
I 
said 
so 
directly, 
and 
then 
Franke 
said: 
Last 
year 
too, 
I 
think, 
you 
went 
somewhere 
quite 
close 
to 
Vienna, 
where 
was 
it, 
Hain--, 
and 
then 
she 
stopped 
and 
made 
as 
if 
she 
had 
never 
heard 
of 
Hainfeld. 
Of 
course 
that 
was 
all 
put 
on, 
but 
she's 
very 
angry 
because 
we 
won't 
speak 
to 
her 
since 
that 
business 
about 
the 
cousin! 
But 
now 
I 
was 
to 
learn 
what 
true 
friendship 
is. 
While 
I 
was 
getting 
still 
more 
angry, 
Hella 
said: 
Rita's 
Mother 
is 
now 
in 
Franzensbad, 
the 
world-famous 
health 
resort; 
she 
is 
ill, 
and 
Prof. 
Sch. 
has 
to 
go 
and 
see 
her 
at 
least 
once 
a 
week. 
The 
Herr 
Rel. 
Prof. 
was 
awfully 
nice 
and 
said: 
Rodaun 
is 
a 
lovely 
place. 
The 
air 
there 
is 
very 
fine 
and 
will 
certainly 
do 
your 
Mother 
a 
lot 
of 
good. 
That's 
the 
chief 
thing, 
isn't 
it 
children? 
I 
hope 
that 
God 
will 
spare 
all 
your 
parents 
for 
many 
years. 
When 
the 
Herr 
Rel. 
Prof. 
said 
that, 
Lampel, 
whose 
Mother 
died 
last 
winter, 
burst 
out 
crying, 
and 
I 
cried 
too, 
for 
I 
thought 
of 
my 
talk 
with 
Father. 
Weinberger 
and 
Franke 
thought 
I 
was 
crying 
because 
I 
was 
annoyed 
because 
we 
were 
only 
going 
to 
Rodaun. 
In 
the 
interval 
Franke 
said: 
After 
all, 
there's 
no 
harm 
in 
going 
to 
Rodaun, 
that's 
no 
reason 
for 
crying. 
But 
Hella 
said: 
"Excuse 
me, 
the 
Lainers 
can 
go 
anywhere 
they 
please, 
they 
are 
so 
well 
off 
that 
many 
people 
might 
envy 
them. 
Besides, 
her 
Mother 
and 
her 
sister 
are 
in 
Franzensbad 
now, 
where 
everything 
is 
frightfully 
expensive, 
and 
in 
Rodaun 
they 
have 
rented 
a 
house 
all 
for 
themselves. 
Rita 
is 
crying 
because 
she 
is 
anxious 
about 
her 
Mother, 
not 
because 
of 
anything 
you 
said." 
Of 
course 
we 
don't 
speak 
a 
word 
to 
Franke 
now. 
Mother 
does 
not 
want 
us 
to 
anyhow, 
she 
did 
not 
like 
her 
at 
all 
when 
she 
met 
her 
last 
year. 
Mother 
has 
a 
fine 
instinct 
in 
such 
matters. 


July 
6th. 
We 
broke 
up 
to-day. 
I 
have 
nothing 
but 
Very 
Goods, 
except 
of 
course 
in 
----Natural 
History! 
That 
was 
to 
be 
expected. 
What 
----(I 
can't 
bring 
myself 
to 
write 
the 
name) 
said 
was 
perfectly 
right. 
Nearly 
all 
the 
girls 
who 
were 
still 
there 
brought 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
and 
Frau 
Doktor 
St. 
flowers 
as 
farewell 
tokens. 
This 
time, 
Hella 
and 
I 
were 
allowed 
to 
go 
with 
Frau 
Doktor 


M. 
to 
the 
metropolitan. 
When 
we 
kiss 
her 
hand 
she 
always 
blushes, 
and 
we 
love 
doing 
it. 
This 
summer 
holidays 
she 
is 
going 
to 
------Germany, 
of 
course; 
really 
Hella 
need 
not 
have 
asked; 
it's 
obvious!!! 

July 
8th. 
Mother 
and 
Dora 
are 
coming 
home 
today. 
We 
are 
going 
to 
meet 
them 
at 
the 
station. 
By 
the 
way, 
I'd 
quite 
forgotten. 
The 
other 
day 
Father 
hid 
a 
new 
5 
crown 
piece 
in 
my 
table 
napkin, 
and 
when 
I 
lifted 
up 
my 
table 
napkin 
it 
fell 
out, 
and 
Father 
said: 
In 
part 
payment 
of 
your 
outlay 
on 
flowers 
for 
the 
table. 
Father 
is 
such 
a 
darling, 
the 
flowers 
did 
not 
cost 
anything 
like 
5 
crowns, 
3 
at 
most, 
for 
though 
they 
were 
lovely 
ones, 
I 
only 
bought 
fresh 
ones 
every 
other 
day. 
Now 
I 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
buy 
Mother 
lots 
of 
roses, 
and 
I 
shall 
either 
take 
them 
to 
the 
station 
or 
put 
them 
on 
her 
table. 
On 
the 
one 
hand 
I'm 
awfully 
glad 
Mother 
is 
coming 
home, 
but 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
I 
did 
like 
being 
alone 
with 
Father 
for 
he 
always 
talked 
to 
me 
about 
everything 
just 
as 
he 
does 
to 
Mother; 
that 
will 
come 
to 
an 
end 
now. 


July 
10th. 
Mother 
and 
Dora 
look 
splendid; 
I'm 
especially 
glad 
about 
Mother; 
for 
one 
can 
see 
that 
she 
is 
quite 
well 
again. 
If 
we 
had 
not 
taken 
the 
house 
in 
Rodaun, 
we 
might 
just 
as 
well 
go 
to 
Tyrol, 
for 
one 
can't 
deny 
it 
would 
be 
much 
nicer. 
Dora 
looks 
quite 
a 
stranger. 
It's 
absurd, 
for 
one 
can't 
alter 
in 
1 
month, 
still, 
she 
really 
looks 
quite 
different; 
she 
does 
her 
hair 
differently, 
parted 
over 
the 
ears. 
I 
have 
had 
no 
chance 
yet 
to 
say 
anything 
about 
the 
"trouble," 
and 
she 
has 
not 
alluded 
to 
it. 
In 
the 
autumn 
she 
will 
have 
to 
have 
a 
special 
exam. 
for 
the 
Sixth 
because 
she 
went 
away 
a 
month 
before 
the 
end 
of 
term. 
Father 
says 
that 
is 
only 
pro 
forma 
and 
that 
she 
must 
not 
take 
any 
lesson 
books 
to 
the 
country. 
Hella 
went 
away 
yesterday, 
she 
and 
her 
Mother 
and 
Lizzi 
are 
going 
first 
to 
Gastein 
and 
then 
to 
stay 
with 
their 
uncle 
in 
Hungary. 
Life 
is 
dull 
without 
Hella, 
much 
worse 
than 
without 
Dora; 
without 
her 
I 
was 
simply 
bored 
sometimes 
in 
the 
evening, 
at 
bedtime. 
Dora 
gives 
it 
out 
that 
in 
Franzensbad 
people 
treated 
her 
as 
a 
grown-up 
lady. 
I'm 
sure 
that's 
not 
true 
for 
anyone 
can 
see 
that 
she's 
a 
long 
way 
from 
being 
a 
grown-up 
lady 
yet. 


July 
11th. 
I 
can't 
think 
what's 
happened 
to 
Dora. 
When 
she 
goes 
out 
she 
goes 
alone. 
She 
doesn't 
tell 
me 
when 
she 
is 
going 
or 
where, 
and 
she 
hasn't 
said 
a 
word 
about 
Viktor. 
But 
he 
must 
know 
that 
she 
is 
back. 
To-morrow 
we 
are 
going 
to 
Rodaun, 
by 
train 
of 
course, 
not 
by 
the 
steam 
tram. 
The 
day 
after 
tomorrow, 
the 
13th, 
Oswald 
has 
the 
viva 
voce 
exam 
for 
his 
matriculation. 
He 
says 
that 
in 
every 
class 
there 
are 
at 
least 
1 
or 
several 
swotters, 
like 
Verbenowitsch 
in 
ours, 
he 
says 
they 
spoil 
the 
pitch 
for 
the 
others, 
for, 
because 
of 
the 
swotters, 
the 
professors 
expect 
so 
much 
more 
of 
the 
others 
and 



sit 
upon 
them. 
This 
may 
be 
so 
in 
the 
Gymnasium, 
but 
certainly 
not 
at 
the 
High 
School. 
For 
though 
Verb. 
is 
always 
sucking 
up 
to 
the 
staff, 
they 
can't 
stand 
her; 
they 
give 
her 
good 
reports, 
but 
none 
of 
them 
really 
like 
her. 
Mother 
says 
the 
13th 
is 
an 
unlucky 
day, 
and 
it 
makes 
her 
anxious 
about 
Oswald. 
Because 
of 
that 
she 
went 
to 
High 
Mass 
yesterday 
instead 
of 
the 
9 
o'clock 
Mass 
as 
usual. 
I 
never 
thought 
of 
praying 
for 
Oswald, 
and 
anyhow 
I 
think 
he'll 
get 
through 
all 
right. 


July 
13th. 
Thank 
goodness 
Oswald 
has 
wired 
he 
is 
through, 
that 
is 
he 
has 
wired 
his 
favourite 
phrase: 
Finis 
with 
Jubilation. 
At 
any 
rate 
that 
did 
not 
worry 
Mother 
as 
he 
did 
over 
the 
written 
exam., 
when 
he 
made 
silly 
jokes 
all 
the 
time. 
He 
won't 
be 
home 
until 
the 
17th, 
for 
the 
matriculation 
dinner 
is 
on 
the 
15th. 
Father 
is 
awfully 
pleased 
too. 
It's 
lovely 
here; 
of 
course 
we 
have 
not 
really 
got 
a 
whole 
house 
to 
ourselves, 
as 
Hella 
pretended 
at 
school, 
but 
a 
flat 
on 
the 
first 
story; 
in 
the 
mezzanin 
a 
young 
married 
woman 
lives, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
a 
newly 
married 
couple!! 
Whenever 
I 
hear 
that 
phrase 
it 
makes 
me 
shake 
with 
horror 
and 
laughter 
combined. 
Resi 
must 
have 
thought 
of 
it 
too, 
for 
she 
looked 
hard 
at 
Dora 
and 
me 
when 
she 
told 
us. 
But 
they 
have 
a 
baby 
already, 
so 
they 
are 
not 
really 
a 
newly 
married 
couple 
any 
more. 
The 
landlord, 
who 
lives 
on 
the 
same 
floor 
as 
us, 
is 
having 
a 
swing 
put 
up 
for 
me 
in 
the 
garden 
for 
it 
is 
horrid 
not 
to 
have 
a 
swing 
in 
the 
country. 


July 
16th. 
At 
last 
Dora 
has 
said 
something 
to 
me 
about 
Viktor, 
but 
she 
spoke 
very 
coldly; 
there 
must 
be 
something 
up; 
she 
might 
just 
as 
well 
tell 
me; 
she 
really 
ought 
to 
seeing 
all 
that 
I've 
done. 
I 
have 
not 
seen 
him 
since 
that 
last 
letter 
of 
June 
27th; 
that 
time 
something 
must 
have 
hap--no 
that 
word 
means 
something 
quite 
different, 
there 
must 
be 
something 
up, 
but 
I 
do 
wonder 
what. 
Hella 
is 
delighted 
with 
Gastein, 
she 
writes 
that 
the 
only 
thing 
wanting 
is 
me.I 
can 
quite 
understand 
that, 
for 
what 
I 
want 
here 
is 
her. 
Before 
the 
end 
of 
term 
Ada 
wrote 
to 
ask 
whether 
we 
were 
not 
coming 
to 
H. 
this 
year; 
she 
said 
she 
had 
such 
a 
frightful 
lot 
to 
tell 
me, 
and 
she 
wants 
my 
advice. 
I 
shall 
be 
very 
glad 
to 
advise 
her, 
but 
I 
don't 
know 
what 
it 
is 
about. 


July 
18th. 
Something 
splendid, 
we 
are 
------But 
no, 
I 
must 
write 
it 
all 
out 
in 
proper 
order. 
Oswald 
came 
home 
yesterday, 
he 
is 
in 
great 
form 
and 
said 
jokingly 
to 
Dora 
that 
she 
is 
so 
pretty 
he 
thinks 
he 
would 
fall 
in 
love 
with 
her 
if 
she 
were 
not 
his 
sister. 
Just 
before 
it 
was 
time 
to 
go 
to 
supper, 
Mother 



called 
us 
in, 
and 
I 
was 
rather 
annoyed 
when 
I 
saw 
that 
it 
was 
only 
a 
quarter 
to 


8. 
Then 
Father 
came 
in 
with 
a 
paper 
in 
his 
hand 
as 
he 
often 
does 
when 
he 
comes 
back 
from 
the 
office, 
and 
said: 
"Dear 
Oswald 
and 
you 
two 
girls, 
I 
wanted 
to 
give 
you 
and 
especially 
Oswald 
a 
little 
treat 
because 
of 
the 
matriculation." 
Aha, 
I 
thought, 
the 
great 
prize 
after 
all! 
Then 
Father 
opened 
the 
paper 
and 
said: 
"You 
have 
often 
wondered 
as 
children 
why 
we 
have 
no 
title 
of 
nobility 
like 
the 
other 
Lainers. 
My 
grandfather 
dropped 
it, 
but 
I 
have 
got 
it 
back 
again 
for 
you 
Oswald, 
and 
also 
for 
you 
two 
girls. 
Henceforward 
we 
shall 
call 
ourselves 
Lanier 
von 
Lainsheim 
like 
Aunt 
Anna 
and 
your 
uncles." 
Oswald 
was 
simply 
speechless 
and 
I 
was 
the 
first 
to 
pull 
myself 
together 
and 
give 
Father 
a 
great 
hug. 
But 
first 
of 
all 
he 
said: 
"Do 
credit 
to 
the 
name." 
Oswald 
went 
on 
clearing 
his 
throat 
for 
a 
frightfully 
long 
time, 
and 
then 
he 
said: 
Thank 
you, 
Father, 
I 
shall 
always 
hold 
the 
name 
in 
trust, 
and 
then 
they 
kissed 
one 
another. 
We 
were 
on 
our 
best 
behaviour 
all 
through 
the 
evening, 
although 
Mother 
had 
ordered 
roast 
chicken 
and 
Father 
had 
provided 
a 
bottle 
of 
champagne. 
I 
am 
frightfully 
happy; 
it's 
so 
splendid 
and 
noble. 
Think 
of 
what 
the 
girls 
will 
say, 
and 
the 
staff! 
I'm 
frantically 
delighted. 
Tomorrow 
I 
must 
write 
and 
tell 
Hella 
all 
about 
it. 
July 
19th. 
I've 
managed 
it 
beautifully. 
I 
did 
not 
want 
to 
write 
just: 
We 
are 
now 
noble, 
so 
I 
put 
it 
all 
in 
the 
signature, 
simply 
writing 
Always 
your 
loving 
friend 
Rita 
Lainer 
von 
Lainsheim. 
I 
told 
Resi 
about 
it 
first 
thing 
this 
morning, 
but 
Father 
scolded 
me 
about 
that 
at 
dinner 
time 
and 
said 
it 
was 
quite 
unnecessary; 
it 
seems 
the 
nobility 
has 
gone 
to 
your 
head. 
Nothing 
of 
the 
sort, 
but 
it's 
natural 
that 
I 
should 
be 
frightfully 
glad 
and 
Dora 
too 
has 
covered 
a 
whole 
sheet 
of 
paper 
writing 
her 
new 
name. 
Father 
says 
it 
does 
not 
really 
make 
us 
any 
different 
from 
what 
we 
were 
before, 
but 
that 
is 
not 
true, 
for 
if 
it 
were 
he 
would 
not 
have 
bothered 
to 
revive 
the 
title. 
He 
says 
it 
will 
make 
it 
easier 
for 
Oswald 
to 
get 
on, 
but 
I'm 
sure 
there's 
more 
in 
it 
than 
that. 
Resi 
told 
the 
landlord 
about 
it 
and 
in 
the 
afternoon 
he 
and 
his 
wife 
called 
to 
congratulate 
us. 


July 
20th. 
Oswald 
says 
he 
won't 
stay 
here, 
it's 
much 
too 
dull, 
he 
is 
going 
for 
a 
walking 
tour 
through 
the 
Alps, 
to 
Grossglockner, 
and 
then 
to 
the 
Karawanken. 
He 
will 
talk 
of 
Father 
as 
the 
"Old 
Man," 
and 
I 
do 
think 
it 
is 
so 
vulgar. 
Dora 
says 
it 
is 
absolutely 
flippant. 



July 
24th. 
Hella's 
answer 
came 
to-day; 
she 
congratulates 
me 
most 
heartily, 
and 
then 
goes 
on 
to 
write 
that 
at 
first 
she 
was 
struck 
dumb 
and 
thought 
I'd 
gone 
crazy 
or 
was 
trying 
to 
take 
her 
in. 
But 
her 
mother 
had 
already 
heard 
of 
it 
from 
her 
father 
for 
it 
had 
been 
published 
in 
the 
Official 
Gazette. 
Now 
we 
are 
both 
noble, 
and 
that 
is 
awfully 
nice. 
For 
I 
have 
often 
been 
annoyed 
that 
she 
was 
noble 
when 
I 
was 
not. 


July 
25th. 
Oswald 
left 
to-day. 
Father 
gave 
him 
300 
crowns 
for 
his 
walking 
tour, 
because 
of 
the 
matriculation. 
I 
said: 
"In 
that 
case 
I 
shall 
matriculate 
as 
soon 
as 
I 
can" 
and 
Oswald 
said: 
"For 
that 
one 
wants 
rather 
more 
brains 
in 
one's 
head 
than 
you 
girls 
have." 
What 
cheek, 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
passed 
the 
Gymnasium 
matriculation 
and 
Frau 
Doktor 
Steiner 
passed 
it 
too 
as 
an 
extra. 
Dora 
said 
quietly: 
Maybe 
I 
shall 
show 
you 
that 
your 
sister 
can 
matriculate 
too; 
anyhow 
you 
have 
always 
said 
yourself 
that 
the 
chief 
thing 
you 
need 
to 
get 
through 
the 
matriculation 
is 
cheek. 
Then 
I 
had 
a 
splendid 
idea 
and 
said: 
"But 
we 
girls 
have 
not 
got 
cheek, 
we 
study 
when 
we 
have 
to 
pass 
an 
examination!" 
Mother 
wanted 
us 
to 
make 
it 
up 
with 
him, 
but 
we 
would 
not. 
In 
the 
evening 
Dora 
said 
to 
me: 
Oswald 
is 
frantically 
arrogant, 
though 
he 
has 
had 
such 
a 
lot 
of 
Satisfactories 
and 
has 
only 
just 
scraped 
through 
his 
exam. 
By 
the 
way 
here's 
another 
sample 
of 
Oswald's 
stupidity; 
directly 
after 
the 
wire: 
"Finis 
with 
Jubilation" 
came 
another 
which 
ought 
to 
have 
arrived 
first, 
for 
it 
had 
been 
handed 
in 
4 
hours 
earlier, 
with 
nothing 
but 
the 
word 
"Through" 
[Durch]. 
Mother 
was 
frightfully 
upset 
by 
it 
for 
she 
was 
afraid 
it 
really 
meant 
failed 
[durchgefallen], 
and 
that 
the 
other 
telegram 
had 
been 
only 
an 
idiotic 
joke. 
Dora 
and 
I 
would 
never 
condescend 
to 
such 
horseplay. 
Father 
always 
says 
Oswald 
will 
sow 
all 
his 
wild 
oats 
at 
the 
university, 
but 
he 
said 
today 
that 
he 
was 
not 
going 
to 
the 
university, 
but 
would 
study 
mining, 
and 
then 
perhaps 
law. 


July 
29th. 
It's 
sickeningly 
dull 
here, 
I 
simply 
don't 
know 
what 
to 
do; 
I 
really 
can't 
read 
and 
swing 
the 
whole 
day 
long, 
and 
Dora 
has 
become 
as 
dull 
as 
she 
used 
to 
be; 
that 
is, 
even 
duller, 
for 
not 
only 
does 
she 
not 
quarrel, 
but 
she 
won't 
talk, 
that 
is 
she 
won't 
talk 
about 
certain 
things. 
She 
is 
perfectly 
crazy 
about 
the 
baby 
of 
the 
young 
couple 
in 
the 
mezzanin; 
he's 
10 
months 
old, 
and 
I 
can't 
see 
what 
she 
sees 
to 
please 
her 
in 
such 
a 
little 
pig; 
she's 
always 
carrying 
him 
about 
and 
yesterday 
he 
made 
her 
all 
wet, 
I 
wished 
her 
joy 
of 
it. 
It 
made 
her 
pretty 
sick, 
and 
I 
hope 
it 
will 
cure 
her 
infatuation. 



Thank 
goodness 
to-morrow 
is 
my 
birthday, 
that 
will 
be 
a 
bit 
of 
a 
change. 
Tomorrow 
we 
are 
going 
to 
the 
Parapluie 
Berg, 
but 
I 
hope 
we 
shan't 
want 
our 
umbrellas. 
Father 
is 
coming 
back 
at 
1 
so 
that 
we 
can 
get 
away 
at 
2 
or 
half 
past. 
Hella 
has 
sent 
me 
to-day 
a 
lock-up 
box 
for 
letters, 
etc.!!! 
of 
course 
filled 
with 
sweets 
and 
a 
tremendously 
long 
letter 
to 
tell 
me 
how 
she 
is 
getting 
on 
in 
Gastein. 
But 
they 
are 
only 
going 
to 
stay 
a 
month 
because 
it 
is 
frantically 
expensive, 
a 
roll 
5 
krenzer 
and 
a 
bottle 
of 
beer 
1 
crown. 
And 
the 
rolls 
are 
so 
small 
that 
one 
simply 
has 
to 
eat 
3 
for 
breakfast 
and 
for 
afternoon 
tea. 
But 
it's 
awfully 
smart 
in 
the 
hotel, 
several 
grooms; 
then 
there 
are 
masses 
of 
Americans 
and 
English 
and 
even 
a 
consul's 
family 
from 
Sydney 
in 
Australia.-
I 
spend 
most 
of 
the 
day 
playing 
with 
two 
dachshund 
puppies. 
They 
are 
called 
Max 
and 
Moritz, 
though 
of 
course 
one 
of 
them 
is 
a 
bitch. 
That 
is 
really 
a 
word 
which 
one 
ought 
not 
to 
write, 
for 
it 
means 
something, 
at 
least 
in 
its 
other 
meaning. 



THIRD 
YEAR 
AGE 
THIRTEEN 
TO 
FOURTEEN 


THIRD 
YEAR 


July 
31st. 
Yesterday 
was 
my 
birthday, 
the 
thirteenth. 
Mother 
gave 
me 
a 
clock 
with 
a 
luminous 
dial 
which 
I 
wanted 
for 
my 
night-table. 
Of 
course 
that 
is 
chiefly 
of 
use 
during 
the 
long 
winter 
nights; 
embroidered 
collars; 
from 
Father, 
A 
Bad 
Boy's 
Diary, 
which 
one 
of 
the 
nurses 
lent 
Hella 
when 
she 
was 
in 
hospital; 
it's 
such 
a 
delightfully 
funny 
book, 
but 
Father 
says 
it's 
stupid 
because 
no 
boy 
could 
have 
written 
all 
that, 
a 
new 
racquet 
with 
a 
leather 
case, 
an 
awfully 
fine 
one, 
a 
Sirk, 
and 
tennis 
balls 
from 
Dora. 
Correspondence 
cards, 
blue-grey 
with 
silver 
edge. 
Grandfather 
and 
Grandmother 
sent 
a 
basket 
of 
cherries, 
red 
ones, 
and 
a 
basket 
of 
currants 
and 
strawberries; 
the 
strawberries 
are 
only 
for 
me 
for 
my 
birthday. 
Aunt 
Dora 
sent 
three 
neckties 
from 
Berlin 
for 
winter 
blouses. 
In 
the 
afternoon 
we 
went 
to 
the 
Par.-Berg. 
It 
would 
have 
been 
awfully 
jolly 
if 
only 
Mother 
could 
have 
gone 
too 
or 
if 
Hella 
had 
been 
there. 


August 
1st. 
I 
got 
a 
letter 
from 
Ada 
to-day. 
She 
sends 
me 
many 
happy 
returns, 
for 
she 
thinks 
it 
is 
on 
the 
1st 
of 
August, 
and 
then 
comes 
the 
chief 
thing. 
She 
is 
frightfully 
unhappy. 
She 
writes 
that 
she 
wants 
to 
escape 
from 
the 
cramping 
environment 
of 
her 
family, 
she 
simply 
can't 
endure 
the 
stifling 
atmosphere 
of 
home. 
She 
has 
been 
to 
St. 
P. 
to 
see 
the 
actor 
for 
whom 
she 
has 
such 
an 
admiration, 
he 
heard 
her 
recite 
something 
and 
said 
she 
had 
real 
dramatic 
talent; 
he 
would 
be 
willing 
to 
train 
her 
for 
the 
stage, 
but 
only 
with 
her 
parents' 
consent. 
But 
of 
course 
they 
will 
never 
give 
it. 
She 
writes 
that 
this 
has 
made 
her 
so 
nervous 
she 
feels 
like 
crying 
or 
raving 
all 
day 
long, 
in 
fact 
she 
can't 
stand 
so 
dismal 
a 
life 
any 
longer. 
I 
am 
her 
last 
hope. 
She 
would 
like 
me 
to 
come 
to 
stay 
with 
them, 
or 
still 
better 
if 
she 
could 
come 
and 
stay 
with 
us 
for 
two 
or 
3 
weeks, 
then 
she 
would 
tell 
Mother 
about 
everything, 
and 
perhaps 
it 
might 
be 
possible 
to 
arrange 
for 
her 
to 
live 
with 
us 
in 
Vienna 
for 
a 
year; 
in 
the 
autumn 
Herr 
G., 
the 
actor, 
is 
coming 
to 
the 
Raimund 
Theatre 
and 
she 
could 
begin 
her 
training 
there. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
her 
letter 
she 
says 
that 
it 
rests 



with 
my 
discretion 
and 
my 
tact 
to 
make 
her 
the 
happiest 
creature 
in 
the 
world! 
I 
don't 
really 
know 
what 
I 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
do. 
Still, 
I've 
made 
a 
beginning; 
I 
said 
I 
found 
it 
so 
frightfully 
dull--if 
only 
Hella 
were 
here, 
or 
at 
least 
Ada, 
or 
even 
Marina. 
Then 
Mother 
said: 
But 
Marina 
is 
away 
in 
the 
country, 
in 
Carinthia, 
and 
it's 
not 
likely 
that 
Ada 
will 
be 
able 
to 
come. 
Father, 
too, 
is 
awfully 
sorry 
that 
I 
find 
it 
so 
dull, 
and 
so 
at 
supper 
he 
said: 
Would 
you 
really 
like 
Ada 
to 
come 
here? 
Certainly 
her 
age 
makes 
her 
a 
better 
companion 
for 
you 
than 
Dora. 
You 
seemed 
to 
get 
on 
better 
together 
last 
year. 
And 
then 
he 
said 
to 
Mother: 
Do 
you 
think 
it 
would 
bother 
you, 
Berta, 
to 
have 
Ada 
here? 
and 
Mother 
said, 
"Not 
a 
bit; 
if 
Gretel 
would 
like 
it; 
it's 
really 
her 
turn 
now, 
Dora 
came 
with 
me 
to 
Franzensbad, 
Oswald 
is 
having 
his 
walking 
tour, 
and 
only 
our 
little 
pet 
has 
not 
had 
anything 
for 
herself; 
would 
you 
like 
it 
Gretel?" 
"Oh 
yes, 
Mother, 
I 
should 
like 
it 
awfully, 
I'll 
write 
directly; 
it's 
no 
fun 
to 
me 
to 
carry 
about 
that 
little 
brat 
the 
way 
Dora 
does, 
and 
jolly 
as 
the 
Bad 
Boy's 
Diary 
is 
I 
can't 
read 
it 
all 
day." 
So 
I 
am 
writing 
to 
Ada 
directly, 
just 
as 
if 
I 
had 
thought 
of 
it 
and 
wanted 
her 
to 
come. 
I 
shall 
be 
so 
frightfully 
happy 
if 
it 
all 
comes 
off 
and 
if 
Ada 
really 
becomes 
a 
great 
actress, 
like 
Wolter 
whom 
Mother 
is 
always 
talking 
of, 
then 
I 
shall 
have 
done 
something 
towards 
helping 
Vienna 
to 
have 
a 
great 
actress 
and 
towards 
making 
Ada 
the 
happiest 
creature 
in 
the 
world 
instead 
of 
the 
unhappiest. 


August 
2nd. 
In 
my 
letter 
I 
did 
not 
say 
anything 
to 
Ada 
about 
our 
having 
been 
ennobled, 
or 
as 
Dora 
says 
re-ennobled, 
since 
the 
family 
has 
been 
noble 
for 
generations; 
she 
will 
find 
out 
about 
it 
soon 
enough 
when 
she 
comes 
here. 
Mother 
keeps 
on 
saying: 
Don't 
put 
on 
such 
airs, 
especially 
about 
a 
thing 
which 
we 
have 
not 
done 
anything 
particular 
to 
deserve. 
But 
that's 
not 
quite 
fair, 
for 
unless 
Father 
had 
done 
such 
splendid 
service 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
laws 
or 
the 
constitution 
or 
something 
two 
years 
ago, 
sometimes 
sitting 
up 
writing 
all 
night, 
perhaps 
he 
would 
never 
have 
been 
re-ennobled. 
Besides, 
I 
really 
can't 
see 
why 
Father 
and 
Mother 
should 
have 
made 
such 
a 
secret 
about 
it 
last 
winter. 
They 
might 
just 
as 
well 
have 
let 
us 
know. 
But 
I 
suppose 
Father 
wanted 
to 
give 
us 
a 
real 
surprise. 
And 
he 
did 
too; 
Dora's 
face 
and 
the 
way 
Oswald 
cleared 
his 
throat!! 
As 
far 
as 
I 
can 
make 
out 
no 
one 
seems 
to 
have 
noticed 
what 
sort 
of 
a 
face 
I 
was 
making. 


August 
3rd. 
I've 
found 
out 
now 
why 
Dora 
is 
so 
different, 
that 
is 
why 
she 
is 
again 
just 
as 
she 
was 
some 
time 
ago, 
before 
last 
winter. 
During 
the 
4 
weeks 



in 
Fr. 
she 
has 
found 
a 
real 
friend 
in 
Mother! 
To-day 
I 
turned 
the 
conversation 
to 
Viktor, 
and 
all 
she 
said 
at 
first 
was: 
Oh, 
I 
don't 
correspond 
with 
him 
any 
more. 
And 
when 
I 
asked: 
"Have 
you 
had 
a 
quarrel, 
and 
whose 
fault 
was 
it?" 
she 
said: 
"Oh, 
no, 
I 
just 
bade 
him 
farewell." 
"What 
do 
you 
mean, 
bade 
him 
farewell; 
but 
he's 
not 
really 
going 
to 
Amer-ica, 
is 
he?" 
And 
then 
she 
said: 
"My 
dear 
Rita, 
we 
had 
better 
clear 
this 
matter 
up; 
I 
parted 
from 
him 
upon 
the 
well-justified 
wish 
of 
our 
dear 
Mother." 
I 
must 
say 
that 
though 
I'm 
awfully, 
awfully 
fond 
of 
Mother, 
I 
really 
can't 
imagine 
having 
her 
as 
a 
friend. 
How 
can 
one 
have 
a 
true 
friendship 
with 
one's 
own 
mother? 
Dora 
really 
can't 
have 
the 
least 
idea 
what 
a 
true 
friendship 
means. 
There 
are 
some 
things 
it's 
impossible 
for 
a 
girl 
to 
speak 
about 
to 
her 
mother, 
I 
could 
not 
possibly 
ask 
her: 
Do 
you 
know 
what, 
something 
has 
happened, 
really 
means? 
Besides, 
I'm 
not 
quite 
sure 
if 
she 
does 
know, 
for 
when 
she 
was 
13 
or 
15 
or 
16, 
people 
may 
have 
used 
quite 
different 
expressions, 
and 
the 
modern 
phrases 
very 
likely 
did 
not 
then 
mean 
what 
they 
mean 
now. 
And 
what 
sort 
of 
a 
friendship 
is 
it 
when 
Mother 
says 
to 
Dora: 
You 
must 
not 
go 
out 
now, 
the 
storm 
may 
break 
at 
any 
moment, 
and 
just 
the 
other 
evening: 
Dora 
you 
must 
take 
your 
shawl 
with 
you. 
Friendship 
between 
mother 
and 
daughter 
is 
just 
as 
impossible 
as 
friendship 
between 
father 
and 
son. 
For 
between 
friends 
there 
can 
be 
no 
orders 
and 
forbiddings, 
and 
what's 
even 
more 
important 
is 
that 
one 
really 
can't 
talk 
about 
all 
the 
things 
that 
one 
would 
like 
to 
talk 
of. 
All 
I 
said 
last 
night 
was: 
"Of 
course 
Mother 
has 
forbidden 
you 
to 
talk 
to 
me 
about 
certain 
things; 
do 
you 
call 
that 
a 
friendship? 
Then 
she 
said 
very 
gently: 
"No, 
Rita, 
Mother 
has 
not 
forbidden 
me, 
but 
I 
recognise 
now 
that 
it 
was 
thoughtless 
of 
me 
to 
talk 
to 
you 
about 
those 
things; 
one 
learns 
the 
seriousness 
of 
life 
quite 
soon 
enough." 
I 
burst 
out 
laughing 
and 
said: 
"Is 
that 
what 
you 
call 
the 
seriousness 
of 
life? 
Have 
you 
really 
forgotten 
how 
screamingly 
funny 
we 
found 
it 
all? 
It 
seemed 
to 
me 
that 
your 
memory 
has 
been 
affected 
by 
the 
mud 
baths." 
She 
did 
not 
answer 
that. 
I 
do 
hope 
Ada 
will 
come. 
For 
I 
need 
her 
now 
just 
as 
much 
as 
she 
needs 
me. 


August 
4th. 
Glory 
be 
to 
God, 
Ada's 
coming, 
but 
not 
directly 
because 
they 
begin 
their 
family 
washing 
on 
the 
5th 
and 
no 
one 
can 
be 
spared 
to 
come 
over 
with 
her 
till 
the 
8th. 
I 
am 
so 
glad, 
the 
only 
thing 
I'm 
sorry 
about 
is 
that 
she 
will 
sleep 
in 
the 
dressing-room 
and 
not 
Dora. 
But 
Mother 
says 
that 
Dora 
and 
I 
must 
stay 
together 
and 
that 
Ada 
can 
leave 
the 
door 
into 
the 
dining-room 
open 
so 
that 
she 
won't 
feel 
lonely. 



August 
7th. 
The 
days 
are 
so 
frightfully 
long. 
Dora 
is 
as 
mild 
and 
gentle 
as 
a 
nun, 
but 
she 
talks 
to 
me 
just 
as 
little 
as 
a 
nun, 
and 
she's 
eternally 
with 
Mother. 
The 
two 
dachshunds 
have 
been 
sold 
to 
some 
one 
in 
Neulengbach 
and 
so 
it 
is 
so 
horribly 
dull. 
Thank 
goodness 
Ada 
is 
coming 
to-morrow. 
Father 
and 
I 
are 
going 
to 
meet 
her 
at 
the 
station 
at 
6. 


August 
8th. 
Only 
time 
for 
a 
word 
or 
two. 
Ada 
is 
more 
than 
a 
head 
taller 
than 
I 
am; 
Father 
said: 
Hullo 
you 
longshanks, 
how 
you 
have 
shot 
up. 
I 
suppose 
I 
must 
treat 
you 
as 
a 
grown-up 
young 
lady 
now? 
And 
Ada 
said: 
Please, 
Herr 
Oberlandesgerichtsrat; 
please 
treat 
me 
just 
as 
you 
used 
to; 
I 
am 
so 
happy 
to 
have 
come 
to 
stay 
with 
you." 
And 
her 
mother 
said: 
Yes, 
unfortunately 
she 
is 
happy 
anywhere 
but 
at 
home; 
"that 
is 
the 
way 
with 
young 
people 
to-day." 
Father 
helped 
Ada 
out 
and 
said: 
Frau 
Haslinger, 
the 
sap 
of 
life 
was 
rising 
in 
us 
once, 
but 
it's 
so 
long 
ago 
that 
we 
have 
forgotten." 
And 
then 
Frau 
Dr. 
H. 
heaved 
a 
tremendous 
sigh 
as 
if 
she 
were 
suffocating, 
and 
Ada 
took 
me 
by 
the 
arm 
and 
said 
under 
her 
breath: 
Can 
you 
imagine 
what 
my 
life 
is 
like 
now? 
Her 
mother 
is 
staying 
the 
night 
here, 
and 
she 
spent 
the 
whole 
evening 
lamenting 
about 
everything 
under 
the 
sun 
(that's 
what 
Ada 
told 
me 
just 
before 
we 
went 
to 
bed); 
but 
I 
did 
not 
pay 
much 
attention 
to 
what 
Frau 
H. 
was 
doing, 
for 
I'm 
positively 
burning 
with 
curiosity 
as 
to 
what 
Ada 
is 
going 
to 
talk 
to 
me 
about. 
To-morrow 
morning, 
directly 
after 
breakfast! 


August 
12th. 
For 
3 
days 
I've 
had 
no 
time 
to 
write, 
Ada 
and 
I 
have 
had 
such 
a 
lot 
to 
say 
to 
one 
another. 
She 
can't 
and 
won't 
live 
any 
longer 
without 
art, 
she 
would 
rather 
die 
than 
give 
up 
her 
plans. 
She 
still 
has 
to 
spend 
a 
year 
at 
a 
continuation 
school 
and 
must 
then 
either 
take 
the 
French 
course 
for 
the 
state 
examination 
or 
else 
the 
needlecraft 
course. 
But 
she 
wants 
to 
do 
all 
this 
in 
Vienna, 
so 
that 
in 
her 
spare 
time 
she 
can 
study 
for 
the 
stage 
under 
Herr 
G. 
She 
says 
she 
is 
not 
in 
love 
with 
him 
any 
longer, 
that 
he 
is 
only 
a 
means 
to 
an 
end. 
She 
would 
sacrifice 
anything 
to 
reach 
her 
goal. 
At 
first 
I 
did 
not 
understand 
what 
she 
meant 
by 
anything, 
but 
she 
explained 
to 
me. 
She 
has 
read 
Bartsch's 
novel 
Elisabeth 
Kott, 
the 
book 
Mother 
has 
too, 
and 
a 
lot 
of 
other 
novels 
about 
artistic 
life, 
and 
they 
all 
say 
the 
same 
thing, 
that 
a 
woman 
cannot 
become 
a 
true 
artist 
until 
she 
has 
experienced 
a 
great 
love. 
There 
may 
be 
something 
in 
it. 
For 
certainly 
a 
great 
love 
does 
make 
one 
different;I 
saw 
that 
clearly 
in 
Dora; 
when 
she 
was 
madly 
in 
love 
with 
Viktor, 
and 
the 



way 
she's 
relapsed 
now!! 
She 
is 
learning 
Latin 
again, 
to 
make 
up 
for 
lost 
time! 
Ada 
does 
not 
speak 
to 
her 
about 
her 
plans 
because 
Dora 
lacks 
true 
insight! 
Only 
to-day 
she 
mentioned 
before 
Dora 
that 
whatever 
happened 
she 
wanted 
to 
come 
to 
Vienna 
in 
the 
autumn 
so 
that 
she 
could 
often 
go 
to 
the 
theatre. 
And 
Dora 
said: 
You 
are 
making 
a 
mistake, 
even 
people 
who 
live 
in 
Vienna 
don't 
go 
to 
the 
theatre 
often; 
for 
first 
of 
all 
one 
has 
very 
little 
time 
to 
spare, 
and 
secondly 
one 
often 
can't 
get 
a 
seat; 
people 
who 
live 
in 
the 
country 
often 
fancy 
that 
everything 
is 
much 
nicer 
in 
Vienna 
than 
it 
really 
is. 


August 
14th. 
Just 
a 
word, 
quickly. 
To-day 
when 
Ada 
was 
having 
a 
bath 
Mother 
said 
to 
us 
two: 
"Girls, 
I've 
something 
to 
tell 
you; 
I 
don't 
want 
you 
to 
get 
a 
fright 
in 
the 
night. 
Ada's 
mother 
told 
me 
that 
Ada 
is 
very 
nervous, 
and 
often 
walks 
in 
her 
sleep." 
"I 
say," 
said 
I, 
"that's 
frightfully 
interesting, 
she 
must 
be 
moonstruck; 
I 
suppose 
it 
always 
happens 
when 
the 
moon 
is 
full." 
Then 
Mother 
said: 
"Tell 
me, 
Gretel, 
how 
do 
you 
know 
about 
all 
these 
things? 
Has 
Ada 
talked 
to 
you 
about 
them?" 
"No," 
said 
I, 
"but 
the 
Frankes 
had 
a 
maid 
who 
walked 
in 
her 
sleep 
and 
Berta 
Franke 
told 
Hella 
and 
me 
about 
it." 
It 
has 
just 
struck 
me 
that 
Mother 
said: 
how 
do 
you 
know 
about 
all 
these 
things? 
So 
it 
must 
have 
something 
to 
do 
with 
that. 
I 
wonder 
whether 
I 
dare 
ask 
Ada, 
or 
whether 
she 
would 
be 
offended. 
I'm 
frightfully 
curious 
to 
see 
whether 
she 
will 
walk 
in 
her 
sleep 
while 
she 
is 
staying 
here. 


August 
15th. 
Hella's 
answer 
came 
to-day 
to 
what 
I 
had 
written 
her 
about 
the 
friendship 
between 
Mother 
and 
Dora. 
Of 
course 
she 
does 
not 
believe 
either 
that 
that 
is 
why 
Dora 
bade 
farewell 
to 
Viktor, 
for 
it 
is 
no 
reason 
at 
all. 
Lizzi 
has 
never 
had 
any 
particular 
friendship 
with 
her 
mother, 
and 
Hella 
could 
never 
dream 
of 
anything 
of 
the 
sort; 
she 
thinks 
I'm 
perfectly 
right, 
one 
may 
be 
awfully 
fond 
of 
one's 
parents, 
but 
there 
simply 
can't 
be 
any 
question 
of 
a 
friendship. 
She 
would 
not 
stand 
it 
if 
I 
were 
so 
changeable 
in 
my 
friendships. 
She 
thinks 
Dora 
can 
never 
have 
had 
a 
true 
friendship, 
and 
that 
is 
why 
she 
has 
taken 
up 
with 
Mother 
now. 
The 
Bruckners 
are 
coming 
back 
on 
the 
19th 
because 
everything 
is 
so 
frightfully 
expensive 
in 
Gastein. 
After 
that 
most 
likely 
they 
will 
go 
to 
stay 
with 
their 
uncle 
in 
Hungary, 
or 
else 
to 
Fieberbrunn 
in 
Tyrol. 
For 
Hella's 
name 
day 
I 
have 
sent 
her 
A 
Bad 
Boy's 
Diary 
because 
she 
wanted 
to 
read 
it 
again. 
Now 
we 
have 
both 
got 
it, 
and 
can 
write 
to 
one 
another 
which 
are 
the 
best 
bits 
so 
that 
we 
can 
read 
them 
at 
the 
same 
time. 



August 
20th. 
Last 
night 
Ada 
really 
did 
walk 
in 
her 
sleep, 
probably 
we 
should 
never 
have 
noticed 
it, 
but 
she 
began 
to 
recite 
Joan 
of 
Arc's 
speech 
from 
The 
Maid 
of 
Orleans, 
and 
Dora 
recognised 
it 
at 
once 
and 
said: 
"I 
say, 
Rita, 
Ada 
really 
is 
walking 
in 
her 
sleep." 
We 
did 
not 
stir, 
and 
she 
went 
into 
the 
dining-
room, 
but 
the 
dining-room 
door 
was 
locked 
and 
the 
key 
taken 
away, 
for 
it 
opens 
directly 
into 
the 
passage, 
and 
then 
she 
knocked 
up 
against 
Mother's 
sofa 
and 
that 
woke 
her 
up. 
It 
was 
horrible. 
And 
then 
she 
lost 
her 
way 
and 
came 
into 
our 
room 
instead 
of 
going 
into 
her 
own; 
but 
she 
was 
already 
awake 
and 
begged 
our 
pardon 
and 
said 
she'd 
been 
looking 
for 
the 
W. 
Then 
she 
went 
back 
to 
her 
own 
room. 
Dora 
said 
we 
had 
better 
pretend 
that 
we 
had 
not 
noticed 
it, 
for 
otherwise 
we 
should 
upset 
Ada. 
Not 
a 
bit 
of 
it, 
after 
breakfast 
she 
said: 
"I 
suppose 
I 
gave 
you 
an 
awful 
fright 
last 
night; 
don't 
be 
vexed 
with 
me, 
I 
often 
get 
up 
and 
walk 
about 
at 
night, 
I 
simply 
can't 
stay 
in 
bed. 
Mother 
says 
I 
always 
recite 
when 
I 
am 
walking 
like 
that; 
do 
I? 
Did 
I 
say 
anything?" 
"Yes," 
I 
said, 
"you 
recited 
Joan 
of 
Arc's 
speech." 
"Did 
I 
really," 
said 
she, 
"that 
is 
because 
they 
won't 
let 
me 
go 
on 
the 
stage; 
I'm 
certain 
I 
shall 
go 
off 
my 
head; 
if 
I 
do, 
you 
will 
know 
the 
real 
reason 
at 
any 
rate." 
This 
sleepwalking 
is 
certainly 
very 
interesting, 
but 
it 
makes 
me 
feel 
a 
little 
creepy 
towards 
Ada, 
and 
it's 
perfectly 
true 
what 
Dora 
has 
always 
said: 
One 
never 
knows 
what 
Ada 
is 
really 
looking 
at. 
It 
would 
be 
awful 
if 
she 
were 
really 
to 
go 
off 
her 
head. 
I've 
just 
remembered 
that 
her 
mother 
was 
once 
in 
an 
asylum. 
I 
do 
hope 
she 
won't 
go 
mad 
while 
she 
is 
staying 
here. 


August 
21st. 
Mother 
heard 
it 
too 
the 
night 
before 
last. 
She 
is 
so 
glad 
that 
she 
had 
warned 
us, 
and 
Dora 
says 
that 
if 
she 
had 
not 
known 
it 
beforehand 
she 
would 
probably 
have 
had 
an 
attack 
of 
palpitation. 
Father 
said: 
"Ada 
is 
thoroughly 
histerical, 
she 
has 
inherited 
it 
from 
her 
mother." 
In 
the 
autumn 
Lizzi 
is 
going 
to 
England 
to 
finish 
her 
education 
and 
will 
stay 
there 
a 
whole 
year. 
Fond 
as 
I 
am 
of 
Ada 
and 
sorry 
as 
I 
am 
for 
her, 
she 
makes 
me 
feel 
uneasy 
now, 
and 
I'm 
really 
glad 
that 
she's 
going 
home 
again 
on 
Tuesday. 
She 
told 
me 
something 
terrible 
to-day: 
Alexander, 
he 
is 
the 
actor, 
has 
venereal 
disease, 
because 
he 
was 
once 
an 
officer 
in 
the 
army; 
she 
says 
that 
all 
officers 
have 
venereal 
disease, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
course. 
At 
first 
I 
did 
not 
want 
to 
show 
that 
I 
did 
not 
understand 
exactly 
what 
she 
meant, 
but 
then 
I 
asked 
her 
and 
Ada 
told 
me 
that 
what 
was 
really 
amiss 
was 
that 
that 
part 
of 
the 
body 
either 
gets 
continually 
smaller 
and 
smaller 
and 
is 
quite 
eaten 
away, 
or 
else 
gets 
continually 
larger 
because 
it 
is 
so 
frightfully 
swollen; 
the 
last 
kind 
is 
much 



better 
than 
the 
other, 
for 
then 
an 
operation 
can 
help; 
a 
retired 
colonel 
who 
lives 
in 
H. 
was 
operated 
upon 
in 
Vienna 
for 
this; 
but 
it 
did 
not 
cure 
him. 
There 
is 
only 
one 
real 
cure 
for 
a 
man 
with 
a 
venereal 
disease, 
that 
a 
young 
girl 
should 
give 
herself 
to 
a 
man 
suffering 
from 
it! 
(Mad. 
often 
said 
that 
too), 
then 
she 
gets 
the 
disease 
and 
he 
is 
cured. 
That 
made 
Ada 
understand 
that 
she 
did 
not 
really 
love 
A., 
but 
only 
wanted 
him 
to 
train 
her; 
for 
she 
could 
never 
have 
done 
that 
for 
him, 
and 
she 
did 
not 
know 
how 
she 
could 
propose 
that 
to 
him 
even 
if 
she 
had 
been 
willing 
to. 
Besides, 
it 
is 
generally 
the 
man 
concerned 
who 
asks 
it 
of 
the 
girl. 
And 
when 
I 
said: 
"But 
just 
imagine, 
what 
would 
you 
do 
if 
you 
got 
a 
baby 
that 
way," 
and 
she 
said: 
"That 
does 
not 
come 
into 
the 
question, 
for 
when 
a 
man 
has 
venereal 
disease 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
have 
a 
child 
by 
him. 
But 
after 
all, 
only 
a 
woman 
who 
has 
had 
a 
baby 
can 
become 
a 
true 
artist." 
Franke, 
who 
has 
a 
cousin 
on 
the 
stage 
said 
something 
of 
the 
same 
sort 
to 
Hella 
and 
me; 
but 
we 
thought, 
Franke's 
cousin 
is 
only 
in 
the 
Wiener 
Theatre, 
and 
that 
might 
be 
true 
there; 
but 
it 
may 
be 
quite 
different 
in 
the 
Burg 
Theatre 
and 
in 
the 
Opera 
and 
even 
in 
the 
People's 
Theatre. 
I 
told 
Ada 
about 
this, 
and 
she 
said: 
Oh, 
well, 
I'm 
only 
a 
girl 
from 
the 
provinces, 
but 
I 
have 
known 
for 
ages 
that 
every 
actress 
has 
a 
child. 


23rd. 
Ada 
really 
is 
a 
born 
artist, 
to-day 
she 
read 
us 
a 
passage 
from 
a 
splendid 
novel, 
but 
oh, 
how 
wonderfully, 
even 
Dora 
said: 
"Ada, 
you 
are 
really 
phenominal!" 
Then 
she 
flung 
the 
book 
away 
and 
wept 
and 
sobbed 
frightfully 
and 
said: 
"My 
parents 
are 
sinning 
against 
their 
own 
flesh 
and 
blood; 
but 
they 
will 
rue 
it. 
Do 
you 
remember 
what 
the 
old 
gypsy 
woman 
foretold 
of 
me 
last 
year: 
"A 
great 
but 
short 
career 
after 
many 
difficult 
struggles; 
and 
my 
line 
of 
life 
is 
broken!" 
That 
will 
all 
happen 
as 
predicted, 
and 
my 
mother 
can 
recite 
that 
lovely 
poem 
of 
Freiligrath's 
or 
Anastasius 
Grun's, 
or 
whosever 
it 
is 
"Love 
as 
long 
as 
thou 
canst, 
love 
as 
long 
as 
thou 
mayst. 
The 
hour 
draws 
on, 
the 
hour 
draws 
on, 
when 
thou 
shalt 
stand 
beside 
the 
grave 
and 
make 
thy 
moan." 
Then 
Ada 
recited 
the 
whole 
poem, 
and 
when 
I 
went 
to 
bed 
I 
kept 
on 
thinking 
of 
it 
and 
could 
not 
go 
to 
sleep. 


August 
24th. 
To-day 
I 
ventured 
to 
ask 
Ada 
about 
the 
sleep-walking, 
and 
she 
said 
that 
it 
was 
really 
so, 
when 
she 
walked 
in 
her 
sleep 
it 
was 
always 
at 
that 
time 
and 
when 
the 
moon 
is 
full. 
The 
first 
time, 
it 
was 
last 
year, 
she 
did 
it 
on 
purpose 
in 
order 
to 
frighten 
her 
mother, 
when 
her 
mother 
had 
first 
told 
her 
she 
would 
not 
be 
allowed 
to 
go 
on 
the 
stage. 
It 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
me 
a 
very 



clever 
idea, 
or 
that 
she 
is 
likely 
to 
gain 
anything 
by 
it. 
The 
day 
after 
tomorrow 
someone 
is 
coming 
to 
fetch 
her 
home, 
and 
for 
that 
reason 
she 
was 
crying 
all 
the 
morning. 


August 
25th. 
Hella 
was 
here 
to-day 
with 
her 
mother 
and 
Lizzi. 
Hella 
had 
a 
splendid 
time 
in 
Gastein. 
She 
wanted 
to 
have 
a 
private 
talk 
with 
me, 
to 
tell 
me 
something 
important. 
That 
made 
it 
rather 
inconvenient 
that 
Ada 
was 
still 
there. 
Hella 
never 
gets 
on 
with 
Ada, 
and 
she 
says 
too 
that 
one 
never 
really 
knows 
what 
she 
is 
looking 
at, 
she 
always 
looks 
right 
through 
one. 
We 
could 
not 
get 
a 
single 
minute 
alone 
together 
for 
a 
talk. 
I 
do 
hope 
Hella 
will 
be 
able 
to 
come 
over 
once 
more 
before 
she 
goes 
to 
Hungary. 
Last 
week 
they 
went 
to 
Fieberbrunn 
in 
Tyrol 
because 
an 
old 
friend 
of 
her 
mother's 
from 
Berlin 
is 
staying 
there. 


August 
26th. 
Ada 
went 
home 
to-day, 
her 
father 
came 
to 
fetch 
her. 
He 
says 
she 
has 
a 
screw 
loose, 
because 
she 
wants 
to 
go 
on 
the 
stage. 


August 
28th. 
Hella 
came 
over 
to-day; 
she 
was 
alone 
and 
I 
met 
her 
at 
the 
steam 
tram. 
At 
first 
she 
did 
not 
want 
to 
tell 
me 
what 
the 
important 
thing 
was 
because 
it 
was 
not 
flattering 
to 
me, 
but 
at 
last 
she 
got 
it 
out. 
The 
Warths 
were 
in 
Gastein, 
and 
since 
Hella 
knows 
Lisel 
because 
they 
used 
to 
go 
to 
gym. 
together, 
they 
had 
a 
talk, 
and 
that 
cheeky 
Robert 
said: 
Is 
your 
friend 
still 
such 
a 
baby 
as 
she 
was 
that 
time 
in 
er 
. 
. 
. 
er 
. 
. 
., 
and 
then 
he 
pretended 
he 
could 
not 
remember 
where 
it 
was; 
and 
he 
spoke 
of 
that 
time 
as 
if 
it 
had 
been 
10 
years 
ago. 
But 
the 
most 
impudent 
thing 
of 
all 
was 
this; 
he 
said 
that 
I 
had 
not 
wanted 
to 
call 
him 
Bob, 
because 
that 
always 
made 
me 
think 
of 
a 
certain 
part 
of 
the 
body; 
I 
never 
said 
anything 
of 
the 
kind, 
but 
only 
that 
I 
thought 
Bob 
silly 
and 
vulgar, 
and 
then 
he 
said 
(it 
was 
before 
we 
got 
intimate): 
"Indeed, 
Fraulein 
Grete, 
I 
really 
prefer 
that 
you 
should 
use 
my 
full 
name." 
I 
remember 
it 
as 
well 
as 
if 
it 
had 
happened 
this 
morning, 
and 
I 
know 
exactly 
where 
he 
said 
it, 
on 
the 
way 
to 
the 
Red 
Cross. 
Hella 
took 
him 
up 
sharply: 
That 
may 
be 
all 
quite 
true, 
we 
have 
never 
discussed 
such 
trifles, 
and, 
at 
that 
time 
we 
were 
"all, 
every 
one 
of 
us, 
still 
nothing 
but 
children." 
Of 
course 
she 
meant 
to 
include 
----. 
I 
won't 
even 
write 
his 
name. 
Another 
thing 
that 
made 
me 
frightfully 
angry 
is 
that 
he 
said: 
I 
dare 
say 
your 
friend 
is 
more 
like 
you 
now, 
but 
at 
that 
time 
she 
was 
still 
quite 
undeveloped. 
Hella 
answered 
him 
curtly: 
"That's 
not 
the 
sort 
of 
phrase 
that 
it's 
seemly 
to 
use 
to 
a 
young 
lady," 
and 
she 



would 
not 
speak 
to 
him 
any 
more. 
I 
never 
heard 
of 
such 
a 
thing, 
what 
business 
is 
it 
of 
his 
whether 
I 
am 
developed 
or 
not! 
Hella 
thinks 
that 
I 
was 
not 
quite 
particular 
enough 
in 
my 
choice 
of 
companions. 
She 
says 
that 
Bob 
is 
still 
nothing 
but 
a 
Bub 
[young 
cub]. 
That 
suits 
him 
perfectly, 
Bob--Bub; 
now 
we 
shall 
never 
call 
him 
anything 
but 
Bub; 
that 
is 
if 
we 
ever 
speak 
of 
him 
at 
all. 
When 
we 
don't 
like 
some 
one 
we 
shall 
call 
him 
simply 
Bob, 
or 
better 
still 
B., 
for 
we 
really 
find 
it 
disagreeable 
to 
say 
Bob. 


August 
31st. 
The 
holidays 
are 
so 
dull 
this 
year, 
Hella 
has 
gone 
to 
Hungary, 
and 
I 
hardly 
ever 
talk 
to 
Dora, 
at 
least 
about 
anything 
interesting. 
Ada's 
letters 
are 
full 
of 
nothing 
but 
my 
promises 
about 
Vienna. 
It's 
really 
too 
absurd, 
I 
never 
promised 
any-thing, 
I 
merely 
said 
I 
would 
speak 
to 
Mother 
about 
it 
when 
I 
had 
a 
chance. 
I 
have 
done 
so 
already, 
but 
Mother 
said: 
There 
can 
be 
no 
question 
of 
anything 
of 
the 
kind. 


September 
1st. 
Hullo, 
Hurrah! 
To-morrow 
Hella's 
father 
is 
going 
to 
take 
me 
to 
K--M--in 
Hungary 
to 
stay 
with 
Hella. 
I 
am 
so 
awfully 
delighted. 
Hella 
is 
an 
angel. 
When 
she 
was 
ill 
last 
Christmas 
her 
father 
said: 
She 
can 
ask 
for 
anything 
she 
likes. 
But 
she 
did 
not 
think 
of 
anything 
in 
particular, 
and 
had 
her 
Christmas 
wishes 
anyhow, 
so 
she 
saved 
up 
this 
wish. 
And 
after 
she 
had 
been 
here 
she 
wrote 
to 
her 
father 
in 
Cracow, 
where 
he 
is 
at 
manoeuvres, 
saying 
that 
if 
he 
would 
like 
to 
grant 
her 
her 
chief 
wish, 
then, 
when 
he 
came 
back 
to 
Vienna, 
he 
was 
to 
take 
me 
with 
him 
to 
K--M--; 
this 
was 
really 
the 
greatest 
wish 
she 
had 
ever 
had 
in 
her 
life! 
So 
Colonel 
Bruckner 
called 
at 
Father's 
office 
to-day 
and 
showed 
him 
Hella's 
letter. 
To-morrow 
at 
3 
I 
must 
be 
at 
the 
State 
Railway 
terminus. 
Unfortunately 
that's 
a 
horrid 
railway. 
The 
Western 
Railway 
is 
much 
nicer, 
and 
I 
like 
the 
Southern 
Railway 
better 
still. 


September 
2nd. 
I 
am 
awfully 
excited; 
I'm 
going 
to 
Vienna 
alone 
and 
I 
have 
to 
change 
at 
Liesing, 
I 
do 
hope 
I 
shall 
get 
into 
the 
right 
train. 
I 
got 
a 
letter 
from 
Hella 
first 
thing 
this 
morning, 
in 
which 
she 
wrote: 
"Perhaps 
we 
shall 
be 
together 
again 
in 
a 
few 
days." 
That's 
all 
she 
said 
about 
that; 
I 
suppose 
she 
did 
not 
know 
yet 
whether 
I 
was 
really 
coming. 
Mother 
will 
have 
to 
send 
my 
white 
blouses 
after 
me, 
because 
all 
but 
one 
are 
dirty. 
I'm 
going 
to 
wear 
my 
coat 
and 
skirt 
and 
the 
pink 
blouse. 
I'm 
going 
to 
take 
twenty 
pages 
for 
my 
diary, 
that 
will 
be 
enough; 
for 
I'm 
going 
to 
write 
whatever 
happens, 
in 
the 
mornings 
I 
expect, 
because 
in 
the 
holidays 
I'm 
sure 
Hella 
will 
never 
get 
up 



before 
9; 
on 
Sundays 
in 
Vienna 
she 
would 
always 
like 
to 
lie 
in 
bed 
late, 
but 
her 
father 
won't 
let 
her. 


But 
whatever 
happens 
I 
won't 
learn 
to 
ride, 
for 
it 
must 
be 
awful 
to 
tumble 
off 
before 
a 
strange 
man. 
It 
was 
different 
for 
Hella, 
for 
Jeno, 
Lajos, 
and 
Erno 
are 
her 
cousins, 
and 
one 
of 
them 
always 
rode 
close 
beside 
her 
with 
his 
arm 
round 
her 
waist: 
but 
that 
would 
not 
quite 
do 
in 
my 
case. 


September 
6th. 
Oh 
it 
is 
so 
glorious 
here. 
I 
like 
Jeno 
best, 
he 
goes 
about 
with 
me 
everywhere 
and 
shows 
me 
everything; 
Hella 
is 
fondest 
of 
Lajos 
and 
of 
Erno 
next. 
But 
Erno 
has 
still 
a 
great 
deal 
to 
learn, 
for 
he 
was 
nearly 
flunked 
in 
his 
exam. 
Next 
year 
Lajos 
will 
be 
a 
lieutenant, 
and 
this 
autumn 
Jeno 
is 
going 
to 
the 
military 
academy, 
Erno 
has 
a 
slight 
limp, 
nothing 
bad, 
but 
he 
can't 
go 
into 
the 
army; 
he 
is 
going 
to 
be 
a 
civil 
engineer, 
not 
here, 
he 
is 
to 
go 
to 
America 
some 
day. 


I 
have 
time 
to 
write 
to-day, 
for 
all 
4 
of 
them 
have 
gone 
to 
S. 
on 
their 
cycles 
and 
I 
have 
never 
learned. 


It 
was 
lovely 
on 
the 
journey! 
It's 
so 
splendid 
to 
travel 
with 
an 
officer, 
and 
still 
more 
when 
he 
is 
a 
colonel. 
All 
the 
stationmasters 
saluted 
him 
and 
the 
guards 
could 
not 
do 
enough 
to 
show 
their 
respect. 
Of 
course 
everyone 
thought 
I 
was 
his 
daughter, 
for 
he 
has 
always 
said 
"Du" 
to 
me 
since 
I 
was 
quite 
a 
little 
girl. 
But 
to 
Ada 
Father 
always 
says 
"Sie." 
We 
left 
the 
train 
at 
Forgacs 
or 
Farkas, 
or 
whatever 
it 
is 
called, 
and 
Hella's 
father 
hired 
a 
carriage 
and 
it 
took 
us 
2 
hours 
to 
drive 
to 
K--M--. 
He 
was 
awfully 
jolly. 
We 
had 
our 
supper 
in 
F., 
though 
it 
was 
only 
half 
past 
6. 
It 
was 
a 
joke 
to 
see 
all 
the 
waiters 
tumbling 
over 
each 
other 
to 
serve 
him. 
It 
s 
just 
the 
same 
with 
Father, 
except 
that 
the 
stationmasters 
don't 
all 
salute. 
Father 
looks 
frightfully 
distinguished 
too, 
but 
he 
is 
not 
in 
uniform. 


Here 
is 
something 
awfully 
interesting: 
Herr 
von 
Kraics 
came 
yesterday 
from 
Radufalva, 
his 
best 
friend 
left 
him 
the 
Radufalva 
estate 
out 
of 
gratitude, 
because 
8 
years 
ago 
he 
gave 
up 
his 
fiancee 
with 
whom 
the 
friend 
was 
in 
love. 
It's 
true, 
Colonel 
Bruckner 
says 
that 
K. 
is 
a 
wretched 
milksop; 
but 
I 
don't 
think 
so 
at 
all; 
he 
has 
such 
fiery 
eyes, 
and 
looks 
a 
real 
Hungarian 
nobleman. 
Hella 
says 
that 
he 
used 
to 
run 
himself 
frantically 
into 
debt, 
because 
every 
six 
months 
he 
had 
an 
intimacy 
with 
some 
new 
woman; 
and 
all 
the 
presents 
he 



gave 
reduced 
him 
almost 
to 
beggary. 
Still, 
it's 
difficult 
to 
believe 
that, 
for 
however 
fond 
a 
woman 
may 
be 
of 
flowers 
and 
sweets, 
one 
does 
not 
quite 
see 
why 
that 
should 
reduce 
anyone 
to 
beggary. 
Before 
we 
went 
to 
sleep 
last 
night 
Hella 
told 
me 
that 
Lajos 
had 
already 
been 
"infected" 
more 
or 
less; 
she 
says 
there 
is 
not 
an 
officer 
who 
has 
not 
got 
venereal 
disease 
and 
that 
is 
really 
what 
makes 
them 
so 
frightfully 
interesting. 
Then 
I 
told 
her 
what 
Ada 
had 
told 
me 
about 
the 
actor 
in 
St. 
P. 
But 
Hella 
said: 
I 
doubt 
if 
that's 
all 
true; 
of 
course 
it 
is 
more 
likely 
since 
he 
was 
an 
actor, 
and 
especially 
since 
he 
was 
in 
the 
army 
at 
one 
time, 
but 
generally 
speaking 
civilians 
are 
wonderfully 
healthy!!! 
And 
she 
could 
not 
stand 
that 
in 
her 
husband. 
Every 
officer 
has 
lived 
frantically; 
that's 
a 
polite 
phrase 
for 
having 
had 
venereal 
disease, 
and 
she 
would 
never 
marry 
a 
man 
who 
had 
not 
lived. 
Most 
girls, 
especially 
when 
they 
get 
a 
little 
older; 
want 
the 
very 
opposite! 
and 
then 
it 
suddenly 
occurred 
to 
me 
that 
that 
was 
probably 
the 
real 
reason 
why 
Dora 
bade 
farewell 
to 
Lieutenant 
R., 
and 
not 
the 
friendship 
with 
Mother; 
it 
is 
really 
awfully 
funny, 
and 
no 
one 
would 
have 
thought 
it 
of 
her. 
Hella's 
father 
thinks 
me 
charming; 
he 
is 
really 
awfully 
nice. 
Hella's 
uncle 
hardly 
ever 
says 
anything, 
and 
when 
he 
does 
speak 
he 
is 
difficult 
to 
understand; 
Hella's 
father 
says 
that 
his 
sister-in-law 
wears 
the 
breeches. 
That 
would 
never 
do 
for 
me; 
the 
man 
must 
be 
the 
master. 
"But 
not 
too 
much 
so" 
says 
Hella. 
She 
always 
gets 
cross 
when 
her 
father 
says 
that 
about 
wearing 
breeches. 
I 
got 
an 
awful 
start 
yesterday; 
we 
went 
out 
on 
the 
veranda 
because 
we 
heard 
the 
boys 
talking, 
and 
found 
Hella's 
great 
uncle 
lying 
there 
on 
an 
invalid 
couch. 
She 
told 
me 
about 
him 
once, 
that 
he's 
quite 
off 
his 
head, 
not 
really 
paralysed 
but 
only 
pretends 
to 
be. 
Hella 
is 
terribly 
afraid 
of 
him, 
because 
long 
ago, 
when 
she 
was 
only 
9 
or 
10 
years 
old, 
he 
wanted 
to 
give 
her 
a 
thrashing. 
But 
her 
uncle 
came 
in, 
and 
then 
he 
let 
her 
go. 
She 
says 
he 
was 
only 
humbugging, 
but 
she 
is 
awfully 
afraid 
of 
him 
all 
the 
same. 
He 
keeps 
his 
room, 
and 
he 
has 
a 
male 
attendant, 
because 
no 
nurse 
can 
manage 
him. 
He 
ought 
really 
to 
be 
in 
an 
asylum 
but 
there 
is 
no 
high 
class 
asylum 
in 
Hungary. 


September 
9th. 
There 
was 
a 
frightful 
rumpus 
this 
morning; 
the 
great 
uncle, 
the 
people 
here 
call 
him 
"kutya 
mog" 
or 
however 
they 
spell 
it, 
and 
it 
means 
mad 
dog, 
well, 
the 
great 
uncle 
spied 
in 
on 
us. 
He 
can 
walk 
with 
a 
stick, 
our 
room 
is 
on 
the 
ground 
floor, 
and 
he 
came 
and 
planted 
himself 
in 
front 
of 
the 
window 
when 
Hella 
was 
washing 
and 
I 
was 
just 
getting 
out 
of 
bed. 
Then 
Hella's 
father 
came 
and 
made 
a 
tremendous 
row 
and 
the 
uncle 
swore 
horribly 



in 
Hungarian. 
Before 
dinner 
we 
overheard 
Hella's 
father 
say 
to 
Aunt 
Olga: 
"They 
would 
be 
dainty 
morsels 
for 
that 
old 
swine, 
those 
innocent 
children." 
We 
did 
laugh 
so, 
we 
and 
innocent 
children!!! 
What 
our 
fathers 
really 
think 
of 
us; 
we 
innocent!!! 
At 
dinner 
we 
did 
not 
dare 
look 
at 
one 
another 
or 
we 
should 
have 
exploded. 
Afterwards 
Hella 
said 
to 
me: 
I 
say, 
do 
you 
know 
that 
we 
have 
the 
same 
name 
day?" 
And 
when 
I 
said: 
"What 
do 
you 
mean, 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
you 
must 
have 
gone 
dotty 
this 
morning," 
she 
laughed 
like 
anything 
and 
said: 
"Don't 
you 
see, 
December 
27th, 
Holy 
Innocents' 
Day!" 
Oh 
it 
did 
tickle 
me. 
She 
knew 
that 
date 
although 
she's 
a 
Protestant 
because 
December 
27th 
is 
Marina's 
birthday, 
and 
in 
our 
letters 
we 
used 
to 
speak 
of 
that 
deceitful 
cat 
as 
"The 
Innocent." 


The 
three 
boys 
and 
I 
have 
begun 
to 
use 
"Du" 
to 
one 
another, 
at 
supper 
yesterday 
Hella's 
father 
said 
to 
Erno: 
"You 
seem 
frightfully 
ceremonious 
still, 
can't 
you 
make 
up 
your 
minds 
to 
drop 
the 
"Sie?" 
So 
we 
clinked 
glasses, 
and 
afterwards 
when 
Jeno 
and 
I 
were 
standing 
at 
the 
window 
admiring 
the 
moon, 
he 
said: 
You 
Margot, 
that 
was 
not 
a 
real 
pledge 
of 
good-fellowship, 
we 
must 
kiss 
one 
another 
for 
that; 
hurry 
up, 
before 
anyone 
comes, 
and 
before 
I 
could 
say 
No 
he 
had 
given 
me 
a 
kiss. 
After 
all 
it 
was 
all 
right 
as 
it 
was 
Jeno, 
but 
it 
would 
not 
have 
done 
with 
Lajos, 
for 
it 
would 
have 
been 
horrid 
because 
of 
Hella, 
or 
Ilonka 
as 
they 
call 
her 
here. 


Hella 
has 
just 
told 
me 
that 
they 
saw 
us 
kissing 
one 
another, 
and 
Lajos 
said: 
"Look 
Ilonka, 
they 
are 
setting 
us 
a 
good 
example." 
We 
are 
so 
awfully 
happy 
here. 
It's 
such 
a 
pity 
that 
on 
the 
16th 
Jeno 
and 
Lajos 
have 
got 
to 
leave 
for 
the 
Academy, 
where 
Jeno 
is 
to 
enter 
and 
Lajos 
is 
in 
his 
third 
year: 
Erno, 
the 
least 
interesting 
of 
the 
three, 
is 
staying 
till 
October. 
But 
that 
is 
always 
the 
way 
of 
life, 
beautiful 
things 
pass 
and 
the 
dull 
ones 
remain. 
We 
go 
out 
boating 
every 
day, 
yesterday 
and 
to-day 
by 
moonlight. 
The 
boys 
make 
the 
boat 
rock 
so 
frightfully 
that 
we 
are 
always 
terrified 
that 
it 
will 
upset. 
And 
then 
they 
say: 
"You 
have 
your 
fate 
in 
your 
own 
hands; 
buy 
your 
freedom 
and 
you 
will 
be 
as 
safe 
as 
in 
Abraham's 
bosom." 


September 
12th. 
The 
great 
uncle 
hates 
us 
since 
what 
happened 
the 
other 
day; 
whenever 
he 
sees 
us 
he 
threatens 
us 
with 
his 
stick, 
and 
though 
we 
are 
not 
really 
afraid, 
because 
he 
can't 
do 
anything 
to 
us, 
still 
it's 
rather 
creepy. 
One 
thinks 
of 
all 
sorts 
of 
things, 
stories 
and 
sagas 
one 
has 
read. 
That 
is 
the 
only 



thing 
I 
don't 
quite 
like 
here. 
But 
we 
are 
leaving 
on 
the 
18th. 
Of 
course 
Lajos 
and 
Jeno 
will 
often 
come 
to 
see 
the 
Bruckners; 
I'm 
awfully 
glad. 
I 
don't 
know 
why, 
I 
always 
fancied 
that 
they 
could 
only 
speak 
Magyar; 
but 
that 
is 
not 
so 
at 
all, 
though 
they 
always 
speak 
it 
at 
home 
when 
they 
are 
alone. 
Hella 
told 
me 
to-day 
for 
the 
first 
time 
that 
all 
the 
flowers 
on 
the 
table 
by 
her 
bed 
one 
Sunday 
in 
hospital 
had 
been 
sent 
by 
Lajos; 
and 
she 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
tell 
me 
at 
that 
time 
because 
he 
wished 
her 
to 
keep 
it 
a 
secret. 
This 
has 
made 
me 
rather 
angry, 
for 
I 
see 
that 
I 
have 
been 
much 
franker 
with 
her 
than 
she 
has 
been 
with 
me. 


September 
16th. 
The 
boys 
left 
to-day, 
and 
we 
stayed 
up 
till 
midnight 
last 
night. 
We 
had 
been 
to 
N--K--, 
I 
don't 
know 
how 
to 
spell 
these 
Hungarian 
names, 
and 
we 
did 
not 
get 
back 
till 
half 
past 
11. 
It 
was 
lovely. 
But 
it 
seems 
all 
the 
sadder 
to-day, 
especially 
as 
it 
is 
raining 
as 
well. 
It's 
the 
first 
time 
it's 
rained 
since 
I 
came. 
Partings 
are 
horrid, 
especially 
for 
the 
ones 
left 
behind; 
the 
others 
are 
going 
to 
new 
scenes 
anyhow. 
But 
for 
the 
people 
left 
behind 
everything 
is 
hatefully 
dull 
and 
quiet. 
In 
the 
afternoon 
Hella 
and 
I 
went 
into 
Jeno's 
and 
Lajos' 
room, 
it 
had 
not 
been 
tidied 
up 
yet 
and 
was 
in 
a 
frightful 
mess. 
Then 
Hella 
suddenly 
began 
sobbing 
violently, 
and 
she 
flung 
herself 
on 
Lajos' 
bed 
and 
kissed 
the 
pillow. 
That 
is 
how 
she 
loves 
him! 
I'm 
sure 
that 
is 
the 
way 
Mad. 
loves 
the 
lieutenant, 
but 
Dora 
is 
simply 
incapable 
of 
such 
love, 
and 
then 
she 
can 
talk 
of 
her 
true 
and 
intimate 
friendship 
with 
Mother. 
Hella 
says 
she 
has 
always 
been 
in 
love 
with 
Lajos, 
but 
that 
her 
eyes 
were 
first 
opened 
when 
she 
saw 
Jeno 
and 
me 
going 
about 
together 
and 
talking 
to 
one 
another. 
Now 
she 
will 
love 
Lajos 
for 
evermore. 
Next 
year 
they 
will 
probably 
get 
engaged, 
she 
can't 
be 
engaged 
till 
she 
is 
14 
for 
her 
parents 
would 
not 
allow 
it. 
It 
is 
for 
her 
sake 
that 
he 
is 
going 
into 
the 
Hussars 
because 
she 
likes 
the 
Hussars 
best. 
They 
all 
live 
frightfully 
hard, 
and 
are 
tremendously 
smart. 


September 
21st. 
Since 
Saturday 
we 
have 
been 
back 
In 
Vienna, 
and 
Father, 
Mother, 
and 
Dora 
came 
back 
from 
Rodaun 
on 
Thursday. 
Dora 
really 
is 
too 
funny; 
since 
Ada 
stayed 
with 
us 
and 
walked 
in 
her 
sleep 
Dora 
is 
afraid 
she 
has 
been 
infected. 
She 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
know 
what 
the 
word 
really 
means! 
And 
while 
I 
was 
away 
she 
slept 
with 
Mother, 
and 
Father 
slept 
in 
our 
room, 
because 
she 
was 
afraid 
to 
sleep 
alone. 
Of 
course 
no 
one 
takes 
to 
walking 
in 
their 
sleep 
simply 
from 
sleeping 
alone, 
but 
that 
was 
only 
a 
pretext; 
Dora 
has 
never 
been 
very 
courageous, 
in 
fact 
she 
is 
rather 
a 
coward, 
and 
she 
was 



simply 
afraid 
to 
sleep 
alone. 
If 
Father 
had 
been 
afraid 
too, 
I 
suppose 
I 
should 
have 
had 
to 
come 
back 
post-haste, 
and 
if 
I 
had 
been 
afraid 
to 
travel 
alone, 
and 
there 
had 
been 
no 
one 
to 
come 
with 
me, 
that 
would 
have 
been 
a 
pretty 
state 
of 
affairs. 
I 
told 
them 
so. 
Father 
laughed 
like 
anything 
at 
my 
"combinations," 
and 
Dora 
got 
in 
a 
frightful 
wax. 
She 
is 
just 
as 
stupid 
and 
conceited 
as 
she 
was 
before 
she 
fell 
in 
love. 
So 
Hella 
is 
right 
when 
she 
says: 
Love 
enobles 
[veredelt]. 
Erno 
made 
a 
rotten 
joke 
about 
that 
when 
he 
heard 
Hella 
say 
it 
once. 
He 
said: 
You've 
made 
a 
slip 
of 
the 
tongue, 
you 
meant 
to 
say: 
Love 
makes 
fools 
of 
people 
[vereseltl. 
Of 
course 
that's 
because 
he's 
not 
in 
love 
with 
anyone. 


September 
22nd. 
School 
began 
again 
to-day. 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
is 
perfectly 
fascinating, 
she 
looks 
splendid 
and 
she 
said 
the 
same 
to 
both 
of 
us. 
Thank 
goodness 
she's 
the 
head 
of 
our 
class 
again. 
In 
French 
we 
have 
a 
new 
mistress 
Frau 
Doktor 
Dunker, 
she 
is 
perfectly 
hideous, 
covered 
with 
pimples, 
a 
thing 
I 
simply 
can't 
stand 
in 
any 
one; 
Hella 
says 
we 
must 
be 
careful 
never 
to 
let 
her 
handle 
our 
books; 
if 
she 
does 
we 
might 
catch 
them. 
In 
Maths 
and 
Physics 
we 
have 
another 
new 
mistress, 
she 
is 
a 
Doktor 
too, 
and 
she 
speaks 
so 
fast 
that 
none 
of 
us 
can 
understand 
her; 
but 
she 
looks 
frightfully 
clever, 
although 
she 
is 
very 
small. 
We 
call 
her 
"Nutling" 
because 
she 
has 
such 
a 
tiny 
little 
head 
and 
such 
lovely 
light-brown 
eyes. 
Otherwise 
the 
staff 
is 
the 
same 
as 
last 
year, 
and 
there 
are 
a 
few 
new 
girls 
and 
some 
have 
left, 
but 
only 
ones 
we 
did 
not 
know 
intimately. 
This 
is 
Franke's 
last 
year 
at 
the 
Lyz., 
she 
will 
be 
16 
in 
April 
and 
has 
a 
splendid 
figure. 
Her 
worst 
enemy 
must 
admit 
that. 
Dora 
is 
having 
English 
lessons 
from 
the 
matron, 
and 
she 
is 
awfully 
pleased 
about 
it, 
for 
she 
is 
one 
of 
her 
favourites 
and 
it 
will 
help 
her 
too 
in 
her 
matriculation. 


September 
25th. 
Yesterday 
and 
the 
day 
before 
Mother 
was 
so 
ill 
that 
the 
doctor 
had 
to 
be 
sent 
for 
at 
half 
past 
10 
at 
night. 
Thank 
goodness 
she 
is 
better 
now. 
But 
on 
such 
days 
I 
simply 
can't 
write 
a 
word 
in 
my 
diary; 
I 
feel 
as 
if 
I 
oughtn't 
to. 
And 
the 
days 
seem 
everlasting, 
for 
nobody 
talks 
much, 
and 
it's 
awful 
at 
mealtimes. 
Mother 
was 
up 
again 
to-day, 
lying 
on 
the 
sofa. 


September 
29th. 
I've 
had 
such 
an 
awful 
toothache 
since 
the 
day 
before 
yesterday. 
Dora 
says 
it's 
only 
an 
ache 
for 
a 
gold 
filling 
like 
Frau 
Doktor 
M.'s. 
Of 
course 
that's 
absurd; 
for 
first 
of 
all, 
surely 
I 
ought 
to 
know 
whether 
my 
own 
tooth 
hurts 
or 
not, 
and 
secondly 
the 
dentist 
says 
that 
the 
tooth 
really 
is 



decayed. 
I 
have 
to 
go 
every 
other 
day 
and 
I 
can't 
say 
I 
enjoy 
it. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
this 
year 
we 
have 
such 
a 
frightful 
lot 
to 
learn 
at 
school. 
The 
Nutling 
is 
really 
very 
nice, 
if 
one 
could 
only 
understand 
better 
what 
she 
says, 
but 
she 
talks 
at 
such 
a 
rate 
that 
in 
the 
Fifth, 
where 
she 
teaches 
too, 
they 
call 
her 
Waterfall. 
Nobody 
has 
ever 
given 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
a 
nickname, 
not 
even 
an 
endearing 
one. 
The 
only 
one 
that 
could 
possibly 
be 
given 
to 
her 
is 
Angel, 
and 
that 
could 
not 
be 
a 
real 
name, 
it's 
quite 
unmeaning. 
In 
the 
drawing 
class 
we 
are 
going 
to 
draw 
from 
still 
life, 
and, 
best 
of 
all, 
animal 
studies 
too, 
I 
am 
so 
delighted. 


October 
4th. 
Goodness, 
to-day 
when 
we 
were 
coming 
home 
from 
the 
Imperial 
Festival, 
we 
met 
Viktor 
in 
M. 
Street, 
but 
unfortunately 
he 
did 
not 
see 
us. 
He 
was 
in 
full-dress 
uniform 
and 
was 
walking 
with 
3 
other 
officers 
whom 
neither 
I 
nor 
Hella 
know. 
We 
were 
frightfully 
angry 
because 
he 
did 
not 
recognise 
us; 
Hella 
thinks 
it 
can 
only 
be 
because 
we 
were 
both 
wearing 
our 
big 
new 
autumn 
hats, 
which 
shade 
our 
faces 
very 
much. 


October 
11th. 
There 
was 
a 
frightful 
row 
in 
the 
drawing 
lesson 
to-day. 
Borovsky 
had 
written 
a 
note 
to 
one 
of 
her 
friends: 
The 
little 
Jewess, 
F. 
(that 
means 
the 
Nutling) 
is 
newly 
imported 
from 
Scandalavia 
with 
her 
horsehair 
pate 
with 
or 
without 
inhabitants." 
Something 
of 
that 
sort 
was 
what 
she 
had 
written 
and 
as 
she 
was 
throwing 
it 
across 
to 
Fellner, 
Fraulein 
Scholl 
turned 
round 
at 
that 
very 
moment 
and 
seized 
the 
note. 
"Who 
is 
F.?", 
she 
asked, 
but 
no 
one 
answered. 
That 
made 
her 
furious 
and 
she 
put 
the 
note 
in 
her 
pocket. 
At 
1 
o'clock, 
when 
the 
lesson 
was 
over, 
Borovsky 
went 
up 
to 
her 
and 
asked 
her 
for 
the 
note. 
Then 
she 
asked 
once 
more: 
"Who 
is 
F.?" 
And 
Fellner, 
thinking 
I 
suppose 
that 
she 
would 
help 
Borovsky 
out, 
said: 
"She 
forgot 
to 
write 
Frau 
Doktor 
Fuchs." 
Then 
the 
row 
began. 
I 
can't 
write 
it 
all 
down, 
it 
would 
take 
too 
long; 
of 
course 
Borovsky 
will 
be 
expelled. 
She 
cried 
like 
anything 
and 
begged 
and 
prayed, 
and 
said 
she 
did 
not 
mean 
it, 
but 
Fraulein 
Scholl 
says 
she 
is 
going 
to 
give 
the 
letter 
to 
the 
head. 


October 
12th. 
Continuation; 
the 
head 
is 
laid 
up 
with 
a 
chill, 
so 
Frl. 
Scholl 
gave 
the 
note 
to 
Frau 
Doktor 
M.; 
that 
was 
both 
good 
and 
bad. 
Good 
because 
Borovsky 
will 
perhaps 
be 
able 
to 
stay 
after 
all, 
and 
bad 
because 
Frau 
Doktor 


M. 
was 
frightfully 
angry. 
She 
gave 
us 
a 
fine 
lecture 
about 
True 
Good 
Manners, 
simply 
splendid. 
I 
was 
so 
glad 
that 
I 
was 
not 
mixed 
up 
in 
the 

business, 
for 
she 
did 
give 
Borovsky 
and 
Fellner 
a 
rating. 
It's 
probably 
true, 
then, 
that 
her 
own 
fiance 
is 
a 
Jew. 
Its 
horrible 
that 
she 
above 
all 
should 
be 
going 
to 
have 
a 
cruel 
husband; 
at 
least 
if 
all 
that 
Resi 
told 
us 
is 
true; 
and 
I 
expect 
there 
is 
some 
truth 
in 
it. 
We 
are 
frightfully 
curious 
to 
know 
whether 
the 
Nutling 
has 
heard 
anything 
about 
it 
and 
if 
so 
what 
she 
will 
do. 


October 
13th. 
I 
don't 
think 
the 
Nutling 
can 
have 
heard 
anything 
for 
she 
seemed 
just 
as 
usual; 
but 
Hella 
thinks 
and 
so 
do 
I 
that 
she 
would 
not 
show 
anything 
even 
if 
Frl. 
Scholl 
had 
told 
her; 
anyhow 
it 
was 
horridly 
vulgar; 
one 
is 
not 
likely 
to 
pass 
it 
on 
to 
the 
person 
concerned. 
Why 
we 
think 
she 
does 
not 
know 
anything 
is 
that 
neither 
Borovsky 
nor 
Fellner 
were 
called 
up. 


October 
14th. 
To-day 
the 
needlewoman 
brought 
Dora's 
handkerchiefs 
with 
her 
monogram 
and 
the 
coronet, 
lovely; 
I 
want 
some 
like 
them 
for 
Christmas. 
And 
for 
Mother 
she 
has 
embroidered 
six 
pillow-cases, 
these 
have 
a 
coronet 
too; 
by 
degrees 
we 
shall 
have 
the 
coronet 
upon 
everything. 
By 
the 
way, 
here 
is 
something 
I'd 
forgotten 
to 
write: 
In 
one 
of 
the 
first 
days 
of 
term 
Father 
gave 
each 
of 
us 
one 
of 
his 
new 
visiting 
cards 
with 
the 
new 
title, 
I 
was 
to 
give 
mine 
to 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
and 
Dora 
hers 
to 
Frau 
Prof. 
Kreidl, 
to 
have 
the 
names 
properly 
entered 
in 
the 
class 
lists. 
Frau 
Prof. 
Kreidl 
did 
not 
say 
anything, 
but 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
was 
awfully 
sweet. 
She 
said: 
"Well, 
Lainer, 
I 
suppose 
you 
are 
greatly 
pleased 
at 
this 
rise 
in 
rank?" 
And 
I 
said: 
"Oh 
yes, 
I'm 
awfully 
delighted, 
but 
only 
inside," 
then 
she 
said: 
That's 
right; 
"Religion, 
name, 
and 
money 
do 
not 
make 
the 
man." 
Was 
not 
that 
charming! 
I 
write 
the 
v 
before 
my 
name 
awfully 
small; 
but 
anyone 
who 
knows 
can 
see 
it. 
What 
a 
shame 
that 
she 
is 
not 
noble! 
She 
would 
be 
worthy 
of 
it!! 


October 
15th. 
Oswald 
has 
gone 
to 
Leoben 
to-day, 
he 
is 
to 
study 
mining, 
but 
against 
Father's 
will. 
But 
Father 
says 
that 
no 
one 
must 
be 
forced 
into 
a 
profession, 
for 
if 
he 
is 
he 
will 
always 
say 
throughout 
life 
that 
he 
only 
became 
this 
or 
that 
on 
compulsion. 
The 
other 
evening 
Dora 
said 
that 
Oswald 
had 
only 
chosen 
mining 
in 
order 
to 
get 
away 
from 
home; 
if 
he 
were 
to 
study 
law 
or 
agricultural 
chemistry 
he 
could 
not 
get 
away 
from 
Vienna, 
and 
that 
is 
the 
chief 
thing 
to 
him. 
Besides, 
he 
is 
a 
bit 
of 
a 
humbug; 
for 
when 
he 
came 
home 
from 
Graz 
after 
matriculation 
he 
said 
in 
so 
many 
words: 
"How 
delightful 
to 
have 
one's 
legs 
under 
one's 
own 
table 
again 
and 
to 
breathe 
the 
family 
atmosphere." 
Dora 
promptly 
said 
to 
him: 
"Hm, 
you 
don't 
seem 
to 
care 
so 



very 
much 
about 
home, 
for 
always 
when 
you 
come 
home 
for 
the 
holidays 
the 
first 
thing 
you 
do 
is 
to 
make 
plans 
for 
getting 
away." 
For 
she 
is 
annoyed 
too 
that 
Oswald 
can 
travel 
about 
wherever 
he 
likes. 
And 
yet 
he 
goes 
on 
talking 
about 
being 
"subjected 
to 
intolerable 
supervision"!! 
What 
about 
us? 
He 
can 
stay 
out 
until 
10 
at 
night 
and 
never 
comes 
to 
afternoon 
tea, 
and 
in 
fact 
does 
just 
what 
he 
likes. 
If 
I 
go 
to 
supper 
with 
Hella 
and 
am 
just 
ever 
so 
little 
late, 
there's 
a 
fine 
row. 
As 
for 
the 
lectures 
poor 
Dora 
had 
to 
endure 
when 
Viktor 
was 
waiting 
for 
her, 
I 
shall 
never 
forget 
them. 
Of 
course 
she 
denies 
it 
all 
now, 
but 
I 
was 
present 
at 
some 
of 
them 
so 
I 
know; 
otherwise 
he 
would 
not 
have 
called 
me 
"the 
Guardian 
Angel." 
She 
behaves 
now 
as 
if 
she 
had 
forgotten 
all 
about 
that, 
so 
I 
often 
remind 
her 
of 
it 
on 
purpose 
when 
we 
are 
alone 
together. 
The 
other 
day 
she 
said: 
"I 
do 
beg 
you, 
Grete 
(not 
Rita), 
don't 
speak 
any 
more 
of 
that 
matter; 
I 
have 
buried 
the 
affair 
for 
ever." 
And 
when 
I 
said: 
"Buried, 
what 
do 
you 
mean? 
A 
true 
love 
can't 
simply 
be 
buried 
like 
that," 
she 
said: 
"It 
was 
not 
a 
true 
love, 
and 
that's 
all 
there 
is 
to 
say 
about 
it." 


October 
16th. 
I 
had 
a 
frantically 
anxious 
time 
in 
the 
arithmetic 
lesson 
to-day. 
All 
of 
a 
sudden 
Hella 
flushed 
dark 
red 
and 
I 
thought 
to 
myself: 
Aha, 
that's 
it! 
And 
I 
wrote 
to 
her 
on 
my 
black-line 
paper: 
Has 
it 
begun??? 
for 
we 
had 
agreed 
that 
she 
would 
tell 
me 
directly, 
she 
will 
be 
14 
in 
February 
and 
it 
will 
certainly 
begin 
soon. 
Frau 
Doktor 
F. 
said: 
Lainer, 
what 
was 
that 
you 
pushed 
over 
to 
Br.? 
and 
she 
came 
up 
to 
the 
desk 
and 
took 
the 
black-line 
paper. 
"What 
does 
that 
mean: 
Has 
it 
begun???" 
Perhaps 
she 
really 
did 
not 
know 
what 
I 
meant, 
but 
several 
of 
the 
girls 
who 
knew 
about 
it 
too 
laughed, 
and 
I 
was 
in 
a 
terrible 
fright. 
But 
Hella 
was 
simply 
splendid. 
"Excuse 
me, 
Frau 
Doktor, 
Rita 
asked 
whether 
the 
frost 
had 
begun 
yet." 
"And 
that's 
the 
way 
you 
spend 
your 
time 
in 
the 
mathematics 
lesson?" 
But 
thank 
goodness 
that 
made 
things 
all 
right. 
Only 
in 
the 
interval 
Hella 
said 
that 
really 
I 
am 
inconceivably 
stupid 
sometimes. 
What 
on 
earth 
did 
I 
want 
to 
write 
a 
thing 
like 
that 
for? 
When 
it 
begins, 
of 
course 
she 
will 
let 
me 
know 
directly. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact 
it 
has 
not 
begun 
yet. 
We 
have 
agreed 
now 
that 
it 
will 
be 
better 
to 
say 
"Endt," 
a 
sort 
of 
portmanteau 
word 
of 
developed 
[entwickelt] 
and 
at 
last 
[endlich] 
. 
That 
will 
really 
be 
splendid 
and 
Hella 
says 
that 
I 
happened 
upon 
it 
in 
a 
lucid 
interval. 
It's 
really 
rather 
cheeky 
of 
her, 
but 
after 
all 
one 
can 
forgive 
anything 
to 
one's 
friend. 
She 
absolutely 
insists 
that 
I 
must 
never 
again 
put 
her 
in 
such 
a 
fix 
in 
class. 
Of 
course 
it 
happened 
because 
I 
am 
always 
thinking: 
Now 
then, 
this 
is 
the 
day. 



November 
8th. 
On 
Father's 
and 
Dora's 
birthday 
Mother 
was 
so 
ill 
that 
we 
did 
not 
keep 
it 
at 
all. 
I 
was 
in 
a 
terrible 
fright 
that 
Mother 
was 
seriously 
ill, 
or 
even 
that 
----------No, 
I 
won't 
even 
think 
it; 
one 
simply 
must 
not 
write 
it 
down 
even 
if 
one 
is 
not 
superstitious. 
Aunt 
Dora 
came 
last 
week 
to 
keep 
house 
for 
Mother. 
We 
are 
not 
going 
skating, 
for 
we 
are 
always 
afraid 
that 
Mother 
might 
get 
worse 
just 
when 
we 
are 
away. 
As 
soon 
as 
she 
is 
able 
to 
get 
up 
for 
long 
enough 
Father 
is 
going 
to 
take 
her 
to 
see 
a 
specialist 
in 
the 
diseases 
of 
women; 
so 
it 
must 
be 
true 
that 
Mother's 
illness 
comes 
from 
that. 


November 
16th. 
Oh 
it's 
horrible, 
Mother 
has 
to 
have 
an 
operation; 
I'm 
so 
miserable 
that 
I 
can't 
write. 


November 
19th. 
Mother 
is 
so 
good 
and 
dear; 
she 
wants 
us 
to 
go 
skating 
to 
take 
our 
thoughts 
off 
the 
operation. 
But 
Dora 
says 
too 
that 
it 
would 
be 
brutal 
to 
go 
skating 
when 
Mother 
is 
going 
to 
have 
an 
operation 
in 
a 
few 
days. 
Father 
said 
to 
us 
yesterday 
evening: 
"Pull 
yourselves 
together 
children, 
set 
your 
teeth 
and 
don't 
make 
things 
harder 
for 
your 
poor 
Mother." 
But 
I 
can't 
help 
it, 
I 
cry 
whenever 
I 
look 
at 
Mother. 


November 
23rd. 
It 
is 
so 
dismal 
at 
home 
since 
Mother 
went 
away; 
we 
had 
to 
go 
to 
school 
and 
we 
believed 
she 
would 
not 
leave 
until 
the 
afternoon, 
but 
the 
carriage 
came 
in 
the 
morning. 
Dora 
says 
that 
Father 
had 
arranged 
all 
that 
because 
I 
could 
not 
control 
myself. 
Well, 
who 
could? 
Dora 
cries 
all 
day; 
and 
at 
school 
I 
cried 
a 
lot 
and 
so 
did 
Hella. 


November 
28th. 
Thank 
goodness, 
it's 
all 
safely 
over, 
Mother 
will 
be 
home 
again 
in 
a 
fortnight. 
I'm 
so 
happy 
and 
only 
now 
can 
I 
realise 
how 
horribly 
anxious 
I 
have 
been. 
We 
go 
every 
day 
to 
see 
Mother 
at 
the 
hospital; 
I 
wish 
I 
could 
go 
alone, 
but 
we 
always 
go 
all 
together, 
that 
is 
either 
with 
Father 
or 
with 
Aunt 
Dora. 
But 
I 
suspect 
that 
Dora 
does 
go 
to 
see 
Mother 
quite 
alone, 
she 
gave 
herself 
away 
to-day 
about 
the 
flowers, 
she 
behaves 
as 
if 
Mother 
were 
only 
her 
mother. 
On 
Thursday, 
the 
first 
time 
we 
saw 
Mother, 
we 
all 
whispered, 
and 
Mother 
cried, 
although 
the 
operation 
had 
made 
her 
quite 
well 
again. 
Unfortunately 
yesterday, 
Aunt 
Alma 
was 
there 
when 
we 
were, 
and 
Father 
said 
that 
seeing 
so 
many 
people 
at 
once 
was 
too 
exciting 
for 
Mother, 
and 
we 
must 
go 
away. 
Of 
course 
he 
really 
meant 
that 
Aunt 
Alma 
and 
Marina 
had 
better 
go 
away, 
but 
Aunt 
did 
not 
understand 
or 
would 
not. 
Why 
on 
earth 



did 
Aunt 
come? 
We 
hardly 
ever 
meet 
since 
the 
trouble 
about 
Marina 
and 
that 
jackanapes 
Erwin; 
only 
when 
there 
is 
a 
family 
party; 
Oswald 
says 
it's 
not 
a 
family 
gathering 
but 
a 
family 
dispersal 
because 
nearly 
always 
some 
one 
takes 
offence. 


November 
30th. 
To-day 
I 
managed 
to 
be 
alone 
with 
Mother. 
At 
school 
I 
said 
I 
had 
an 
awfully 
bad 
headache 
and 
asked 
if 
I 
might 
go 
home 
before 
the 
French 
lesson; 
I 
really 
had. 
What 
I 
told 
Mother 
was 
that 
Frau 
Doktor 
Dunker 
was 
ill, 
so 
we 
had 
no 
lesson. 
Really 
one 
ought 
not 
to 
tell 
lies 
to 
an 
invalid, 
but 
this 
was 
a 
pious 
fraud 
as 
Hella's 
mother 
always 
calls 
anything 
of 
the 
sort, 
and 
no 
one 
will 
find 
out, 
because 
Frau 
Doktor 
Dunker 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
Fourth, 
so 
Dora 
won't 
hear 
anything 
about 
it. 
Mother 
said 
she 
was 
awfully 
pleased 
to 
be 
able 
to 
see 
me 
alone 
for 
once. 
That 
absolutely 
proves 
that 
Dora 
does 
go 
alone. 
Mother 
was 
so 
sweet, 
and 
Sister 
Klara 
said 
she 
was 
a 
perfect 
angel 
in 
goodness 
and 
patience. 
Then 
I 
burst 
out 
crying 
and 
Mother 
had 
to 
soothe 
me. 
At 
first, 
after 
I 
got 
home, 
I 
did 
not 
want 
to 
say 
anything 
about 
it, 
but 
when 
we 
were 
putting 
on 
our 
things 
after 
dinner 
to 
go 
and 
see 
Mother 
I 
said 
en 
passant 
as 
it 
were: 
"This 
is 
the 
second 
time 
I 
shall 
be 
seeing 
Mother 
to-day." 
And 
when 
Dora 
said: 
What 
do 
you 
mean? 
I 
said 
quite 
curtly: 
"One 
of 
our 
lessons 
did 
not 
come 
off, 
and 
so 
I 
took 
the 
chance 
too 
of 
being 
able 
to 
see 
Mother 
alone." 
Then 
she 
said: 
Did 
the 
porter 
let 
you 
in 
without 
any 
trouble? 
It 
surprises 
me 
very 
much 
that 
such 
very 
young 
girls, 
who 
are 
almost 
children 
still, 
are 
allowed 
to 
go 
in 
alone. 
Luckily 
Aunt 
came 
in 
at 
that 
moment 
and 
said: 
"Oh 
well, 
nobody 
thinks 
Gretl 
quite 
a 
child 
now, 
and 
both 
of 
you 
can 
go 
alone 
to 
the 
hospital 
all 
right." 
On 
the 
way 
we 
did 
not 
speak 
to 
one 
another. 


December 
5th. 
For 
St. 
Nicholas 
day 
we 
took 
Mother 
a 
big 
flower 
pot, 
and 
tied 
to 
the 
stick 
was 
a 
label 
on 
which 
Father 
had 
written; 
"Being 
ill 
is 
punishable 
as 
an 
unpermissible 
offence 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
Section 
7 
the 
Mothers' 
and 
Housewives' 
Act." 
Mother 
was 
frightfully 
amused. 
The 
doctor 
says 
she 
is 
going 
on 
nicely, 
and 
that 
she 
will 
be 
able 
to 
come 
home 
in 
a 
few 
days. 


December 
6th. 
It 
was 
awful 
to-day. 
In 
the 
evening 
when 
we 
were 
leaving 
the 
dining-room 
Father 
said: 
"Gretl 
you 
have 
forgotten 
something. 
And 
when 
I 
came 
back 
he 
took 
me 
by 
the 
hand 
and 
said: 
"Why 
didn't 
you 
tell 
me 
that 
you 
want 
so 
much 
to 
see 
Mother 
alone? 
You 
need 
not 
make 
such 
a 
secret 
of 
it." 



And 
then 
I 
burst 
out 
crying 
and 
said: 
"Yes, 
I 
need 
not 
keep 
it 
secret 
from 
you, 
but 
I 
don't 
like 
Dora 
to 
know 
all 
about 
it. 
Did 
she 
tell 
you 
what 
happened 
the 
other 
day?" 
But 
Father 
does 
not 
know 
anything 
about 
my 
pretended 
headache, 
but 
only 
that 
I 
wanted 
so 
much 
to 
see 
Mother 
alone. 
He 
was 
awfully 
kind 
and 
kissed 
and 
petted 
me, 
saying: 
"You 
are 
a 
dear 
little 
thing, 
little 
witch, 
I 
hope 
you 
always 
will 
be." 
But 
I 
got 
away 
as 
quick 
as 
I 
could, 
for 
I 
felt 
so 
ashamed 
because 
of 
my 
fibbing. 
If 
it 
were 
not 
for 
Dora 
I'm 
sure 
I 
should 
never 
tell 
any 
lies. 


December 
6th. 
Father 
is 
an 
angel. 
He 
and 
I 
went 
to 
see 
Mother 
in 
the 
morning, 
and 
Aunt 
and 
Dora 
went 
in 
the 
afternoon. 
And 
since 
Father 
had 
to 
go 
into 
the 
Cafe 
where 
he 
had 
an 
appointment 
with 
a 
friend, 
I 
went 
on 
alone 
to 
see 
Mother 
and 
he 
came 
in 
afterwards. 
Mother 
asked 
me 
about 
my 
Christmas 
wishes; 
but 
I 
told 
her 
I 
had 
only 
one 
wish, 
that 
she 
should 
get 
well 
and 
live 
for 
ever. 
I 
was 
awfully 
glad 
that 
Dora 
was 
not 
there, 
for 
I 
could 
never 
have 
got 
that 
out 
before 
her. 
Still, 
she 
made 
me 
tell 
her 
my 
wishes 
after 
all, 
so 
I 
said 
I 
wanted 
handerkerchiefs 
with 
"monogram 
and 
coronet," 
visiting 
cards 
with 
von, 
a 
satchel 
like 
that 
which 
most 
of 
the 
girls 
in 
the 
higher 
classes 
have, 
and 
the 
novel 
Elizabeth 
Kott. 
But 
I 
am 
not 
to 
have 
the 
novel, 
for 
Mother 
was 
horrified 
and 
said: 
My 
darling 
child, 
that's 
not 
the 
sort 
of 
book 
for 
you; 
who 
on 
earth 
put 
that 
into 
your 
head; 
Ada, 
I 
suppose? 
From 
what 
I 
know 
of 
your 
tastes, 
it 
really 
would 
not 
suit 
you 
at 
all. 
So 
I 
had 
to 
give 
that 
up, 
but 
I'm 
certain 
I 
should 
not 
find 
the 
book 
stupid. 


December 
11th. 
Mother 
came 
home 
again 
to-day; 
we 
did 
not 
know 
what 
time 
she 
was 
coming, 
but 
only 
that 
it 
was 
to 
be 
to-day. 
And 
because 
I 
was 
so 
glad 
that 
Mother 
is 
quite 
well 
again, 
I 
sang 
two 
or 
three 
songs, 
and 
Mother 
said: 
That 
is 
a 
good 
omen 
when 
one 
is 
greeted 
with 
a 
song. 
Then 
Dora 
was 
annoyed 
because 
she 
had 
not 
thought 
of 
singing. 
We 
had 
decorated 
the 
whole 
house 
with 
flowers. 


December 
15th. 
I 
am 
embroidering 
a 
cushion 
for 
Mother 
and 
Dora 
is 
making 
her 
a 
footstool 
so 
that 
she 
can 
sit 
quite 
comfortably 
when 
she 
is 
reading. 
For 
Father 
we 
have 
bought 
a 
new 
brief 
bag 
because 
his 
own 
is 
so 
shabby 
that 
it 
makes 
us 
quite 
ashamed; 
but 
he 
always 
says: 
"It 
will 
do 
for 
a 
good 
while 
yet." 
For 
a 
long 
time 
I 
did 
not 
know 
what 
to 
get 
for 
Aunt 
Dora, 
and 
at 
length 
we 
have 
decided 
upon 
a 
lace 
fichu; 
for 
she 
is 
awfully 
fond 
of 
lace. 
I 
am 



giving 
Hella 
a 
sketch 
book 
and 
a 
pencil 
case; 
she 
draws 
beautifully 
and 
will 
perhaps 
become 
an 
artist, 
for 
Dora 
I 
am 
getting 
a 
vanity 
bag 
and 
for 
Oswald 
a 
cigarette 
case 
with 
a 
horse's 
head 
on 
it, 
for 
he 
is 
frightfully 
taken 
up 
with 
racing 
and 
the 
turf. 


December 
16th. 
Owing 
to 
Mother's 
illness 
I've 
had 
simply 
no 
time 
to 
write 
anything 
about 
the 
school, 
although 
there 
has 
been 
a 
great 
deal 
to 
write 
about, 
for 
example 
that 
Prof. 
W. 
is 
very 
friendly 
again, 
although 
he 
no 
longer 
gives 
us 
lessons, 
and 
that 
most 
of 
the 
girls 
can't 
bear 
the 
Nutling 
because 
she 
makes 
such 
favourites 
of 
the 
Jewish 
girls. 
It's 
quite 
true 
that 
she 
does, 
for 
example 
Franke, 
who 
is 
never 
any 
good, 
will 
probably 
get 
a 
Praiseworthy 
in 
Maths 
and 
Physics; 
and 
she 
lets 
Weinberger 
do 
anything 
she 
likes. 
I 
always 
get 
Excellent 
both 
for 
school 
work 
and 
prep.; 
so 
it 
really 
does 
not 
matter 
to 
me, 
but 
Berbenowitsch 
is 
frightfully 
put 
out 
because 
she 
is 
no 
longer 
the 
favourite 
as 
she 
was 
with 
Frau 
Doktor 
St. 
The 
other 
day 
it 
was 
quite 
unpleasant 
in 
the 
Maths 
lesson. 
In 
the 
answer 
to 
a 
sum 
there 
happened 
to 
be 
1-3, 
and 
then 
the 
Nutling 
asked 
what 
1-3 
would 
be 
as 
a 
decimal 
fraction; 
so 
we 
went 
on 
talking 
about 
recurring 
[periodic] 
decimals 
and 
every 
time 
she 
used 
the 
word 
period, 
some 
of 
the 
girls 
giggled, 
but 
luckily 
some 
of 
them 
were 
Jews, 
and 
she 
got 
perfectly 
savage 
and 
simply 
screamed 
at 
us. 
In 
Frau 
Doktor 
St's 
lesson 
in 
the 
First, 
some 
of 
the 
girls 
giggled 
at 
the 
same 
thing 
and 
she 
went 
on 
just 
as 
if 
she 
had 
not 
noticed 
it, 
but 
afterwards 
she 
always 
spoke 
of 
periodic 
places, 
and 
then 
one 
does 
not 
think 
of 
the 
real 
meaning 
so 
much. 
Frau 
Doktor 
F. 
said 
she 
should 
complain 
to 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
about 
our 
unseemly 
behaviour. 
But 
really 
all 
the 
girls 
had 
not 
giggled, 
for 
ex. 
Hella 
and 
I 
simply 
exchanged 
glances 
and 
understood 
one 
another 
at 
once. 
I 
can't 
endure 
that 
idiotic 
giggling. 


December 
20th. 
Oswald 
came 
home 
to-day; 
he's 
fine. 
It's 
quite 
true 
that 
he 
has 
really 
had 
a 
moustache 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
but 
was 
not 
allowed 
to 
grow 
it 
at 
the 
Gymnasium; 
in 
boarding 
schools 
the 
barber 
comes 
every 
Saturday, 
and 
they 
have 
to 
be 
shaved. 
He 
always 
says 
that 
at 
the 
Gymnasium 
everything 
manly 
is 
simply 
suppressed. 
I 
am 
so 
glad 
I 
am 
not 
a 
man 
and 
need 
not 
go 
to 
Gymnasium. 
Anyhow 
he 
has 
a 
splendid 
moustache 
now. 
Hella 
did 
not 
recognise 
him 
at 
first 
and 
drew 
back 
in 
alarm, 
she 
only 
knew 
him 
after 
a 
moment 
by 
his 
voice. 
We 
have 
reckoned 
it 
up, 
and 
find 
that 
she 
has 
not 
seen 
him 
since 
the 
Easter 
before 
last. 
At 
first 
he 
called 
her 
Fraulein, 
but 
her 
mother 



said: 
Don't 
be 
silly. 
It 
did 
not 
seem 
silly 
to 
me, 
but 
most 
polite!!! 


December 
23rd. 
Mother 
is 
so 
delighted 
that 
Oswald 
is 
home 
again 
and 
he 
really 
is 
awfully 
nice; 
he 
is 
giving 
her 
a 
wonderful 
flowers-of-iron 
group 
representing 
a 
mountain 
scene 
with 
a 
forest, 
and 
in 
the 
foreground 
some 
roe 
deer 
as 
if 
in 
a 
pasture. 


December 
25th. 
Only 
time 
for 
a 
few 
words. 
Mother 
was 
very 
well 
yesterday, 
and 
it 
has 
not 
done 
her 
any 
harm 
to 
stay 
up 
so 
long. 
I 
am 
so 
happy. 
We 
both 
got 
a 
tie 
pin 
with 
a 
sapphire 
and 
3 
little 
diamonds, 
they 
have 
been 
made 
out 
of 
some 
earrings 
which 
Mother 
never 
wears 
now. 
But 
the 
nice 
thing 
about 
it 
is 
that 
they 
are 
made 
from 
her 
earrings. 
The 
satchel 
and 
Stifter's 
Tales 
are 
awfully 
nice 
and 
so 
are 
the 
handkerchiefs 
with 
the 
coronet 
and 
everything 
else. 
Hella 
gave 
me 
a 
reticule 
with 
my 
monogram 
and 
the 
coronet 
as 
well. 
Oswald 
has 
given 
Dora 
and 
me 
small 
paperweights 
and 
Father 
a 
big 
one, 
bronze 
groups. 
We 
really 
need 
two 
writing 
tables, 
but 
there 
is 
no 
room 
for 
two. 
So 
I 
am 
going 
to 
arrange 
the 
little 
corner 
table 
as 
my 
writing 
table 
and 
have 
all 
my 
things 
there. 


December 
27th. 
At 
the 
Bruckners 
yesterday 
it 
was 
really 
awful. 
Hella's 
mother 
is 
perfectly 
right; 
when 
anyone 
looks 
like 
that 
she 
ought 
not 
to 
pay 
visits 
when 
she 
knows 
that 
other 
people 
may 
be 
there. 
Hella 
told 
me 
the 
day 
before 
yesterday 
how 
frightfully 
noticeable 
it 
is 
in 
her 
cousin 
that 
she 
is 
in 
an 
i--c--! 
Her 
mother 
was 
very 
much 
put 
out 
on 
her 
account 
and 
she 
wanted 
to 
prevent 
Emmy's 
standing 
up. 
We 
were 
simply 
disgusted 
and 
horrified. 
But 
her 
husband 
is 
awfully 
gentle 
with 
her; 
She 
is 
certainly 
not 
pretty 
and 
especially 
the 
puffiness 
under 
her 
eyes 
is 
horrid. 
They 
say 
that 
many 
women 
look 
like 
that 
when 
they 
are 
pr. 
She 
was 
wearing 
a 
maternity 
dress, 
and 
that 
gives 
the 
whole 
show 
away! 
Hella 
says 
that 
some 
women 
look 
awfully 
pretty 
when 
they 
are 
in 
an 
i--c--, 
but 
that 
some 
look 
hideous. 
I 
do 
hope 
I 
shall 
be 
one 
of 
the 
first 
kind, 
if 
I 
ever 
. 
. 
. 
No, 
it 
is 
really 
horrible, 
even 
if 
it 
makes 
one 
pretty; 
when 
I 
think 
of 
Frau 
von 
Baldner 
and 
what 
she 
looked 
like 
last 
summer, 
yet 
Father 
has 
always 
said 
she 
is 
a 
a 
perfect 
beauty. 
Really 
no 
one 
is 
pretty 
in 
an 
i--c--. 
Soon 
after 
tea 
Hella 
and 
I 
went 
up 
to 
her 
room, 
and 
she 
said 
it 
had 
really 
been 
too 
much 
for 
her 
and 
that 
she 
could 
not 
have 
stood 
it 
much 
longer. 
And 
we 
went 
on 
talking 
about 
it 
for 
such 
a 
long 
time, 
that 
it 
really 
made 
both 
of 
us 
nearly 
ill. 
On 
Sunday 
Emmy 
and 
her 
husband 
are 



coming 
to 
dine 
with 
the 
Brs., 
and 
Hella 
begged 
me 
to 
ask 
her 
to 
dinner 
with 
us, 
or 
she 
would 
be 
quite 
upset. 
So 
of 
course 
she 
is 
coming 
here 
and 
thank 
goodness 
that 
will 
save 
her 
from 
feeling 
ill. 
And 
then 
she 
said 
that 
I 
must 
not 
think 
she 
wanted 
to 
come 
to 
us 
because 
of 
Oswald, 
but 
only 
for 
that 
other 
reason. 
I 
understand 
that 
perfectly 
well, 
and 
she 
does 
not 
need 
to 
make 
any 
excuses 
to 
me. 


29th. 
Hella 
came 
to 
dinner 
to-day, 
she 
was 
wearing 
a 
new 
dress, 
a 
light 
strawberry 
colour, 
and 
it 
suited 
her 
admirably. 
In 
the 
evening 
Oswald 
said: 
"two 
or 
three 
years 
more, 
and 
Hella 
will 
look 
ripping." 
It 
does 
annoy 
me 
so 
this 
continual 
will. 
Hella's 
father 
simply 
said 
of 
me 
that 
I 
was 
charming,, 
and 
not 
that 
idiotic: 
I 
was 
going 
to 
become 
charming. 
I 
do 
hate 
the 
way 
people 
always 
talk 
out 
into 
the 
future. 
However, 
Oswald 
paid 
Hella 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
attention. 
In 
the 
afternoon, 
when 
Hella 
and 
I 
were 
talking 
about 
him, 
I 
wanted 
to 
turn 
the 
conversation 
to 
Lajos, 
but 
she 
flushed 
up 
and 
said 
he 
was 
utterly 
false, 
for 
since 
October 
he 
had 
only 
been 
to 
see 
them 
once, 
on 
a 
Sunday, 
just 
when 
they 
were 
going 
to 
the 
theatre. 
Of 
course 
he 
says 
he 
does 
not 
care 
a 
jot 
about 
the 
visits 
unless 
he 
can 
see 
her 
alone. 
She 
can't 
realise 
that 
that 
shows 
the 
greatness 
of 
his 
love. 
I 
understand 
it 
perfectly. 
But 
it 
is 
really 
monstrous 
that 
Jeno 
has 
asked 
after 
me 
only 
once, 
quite 
casually. 
And 
he 
really 
might 
have 
sent 
me 
a 
card 
at 
Christmas. 
But 
that's 
what 
young 
men 
are 
like. 
The 
proverb 
really 
applies 
to 
them: 
Out 
of 
sight 
out 
of 
mind. 


December 
30th. 
Frau 
Richter 
called 
to-day, 
but 
only 
in 
the 
morning 
for 
a 
quarter 
of 
an 
hour. 
Not 
a 
word 
was 
said 
about 
Viktor, 
though 
I 
stayed 
in 
the 
drawing-room 
on 
purpose. 
Dora 
did 
not 
put 
in 
an 
appearance, 
though 
I'm 
sure 
she 
was 
at 
home. 
He 
is 
extraordinarily 
like 
his 
mother, 
he 
has 
the 
same 
lovely 
straight 
nose, 
and 
the 
small 
mouth 
and 
well-cut 
lips; 
but 
he 
is 
very 
tall 
and 
she 
is 
quite 
small 
half 
a 
head 
shorter 
than 
Mother. 
We 
owe 
them 
a 
call, 
but 
I 
don't 
much 
think 
that 
we 
shall 
go. 


December 
31st. 
I 
really 
have 
no 
time, 
since 
this 
is 
New 
Year's 
Eve, 
but 
I 
simply 
must 
write. 
Dora 
and 
I 
went 
skating 
this 
morning, 
and 
we 
met 
Viktor 
on 
the 
ice; 
he 
went 
frightfully 
pale, 
saluted, 
and 
spoke 
to 
us; 
Dora 
wished 
to 
pass 
on, 
but 
he 
detained 
her 
and 
said 
that 
she 
must 
allow 
him 
to 
have 
a 
talk, 
so 
he 
came 
skating 
with 
us 
since 
she 
would 
not 
go 
to 
a 
confectioner's 
with 
him. 
She 
was 
certainly 
quite 
right 
not 
to 
go 
to 
a 
confectioner's. 
Of 
course 
I 



don't 
know 
what 
they 
talked 
about, 
but 
in 
the 
afternoon 
Dora 
cried 
frightfully, 
and 
Viktor 
never 
said 
good-bye 
to 
me; 
it's 
impossible 
that 
he 
can 
have 
forgotten, 
so 
either 
I 
must 
have 
been 
too 
far 
away 
at 
the 
time, 
or 
else 
Dora 
did 
not 
want 
him 
to; 
most 
likely 
the 
latter. 
I'm 
frantically 
sorry 
for 
him, 
for 
he 
is 
passionately 
in 
love 
with 
her. 
But 
she 
won't 
come 
to 
her 
senses 
until 
it 
is 
too 
late. 
I 
don't 
think 
she 
has 
said 
a 
word 
to 
Mother 
either. 
But 
all 
the 
afternoon 
she 
was 
playing 
melancholy 
music, 
and 
that 
shows 
how 
much 
she 
had 
felt 
it. 


January 
2nd. 
Yesterday 
I 
had 
no 
time 
to 
write 
because 
we 
had 
callers, 
pretty 
dull 
for 
the 
most 
part, 
the 
Listes 
and 
the 
Trobisches; 
Julie 
Tr. 
is 
such 
a 
stupid 
creature, 
and 
I 
don't 
believe 
she 
knows 
the 
first 
thing 
about 
those 
matters; 
Annie 
is 
not 
quite 
all 
there, 
Lotte 
is 
the 
only 
tolerable 
one. 
Still, 
since 
we 
played 
round 
games 
for 
prizes, 
it 
was 
not 
as 
dull 
as 
it 
might 
have 
been, 
and 
Fritz 
and 
Rudl 
are 
quite 
nice 
boys. 
In 
the 
evening 
Mother 
was 
so 
tired 
out 
that 
Father 
said 
he 
really 
must 
put 
a 
stop 
to 
all 
this 
calling; 
I 
can't 
say 
I 
care 
much 
myself 
for 
that 
sort 
of 
visits, 
especially 
since 
Dora 
always 
will 
talk 
about 
books. 
People 
always 
talk 
about 
such 
frightfully 
dull 
books 
whenever 
they 
have 
nothing 
else 
to 
say. 
School 
began 
again 
to-day, 
with 
a 
German 
lesson 
thank 
goodness. 
Though 
I'm 
not 
superstitious 
in 
general, 
I 
must 
say 
I 
do 
like 
a 
good 
beginning. 
Besides, 
first 
thing 
in 
the 
morning 
we 
met 
two 
chimneysweeps, 
and 
without 
our 
having 
tried 
to 
arrange 
it 
in 
any 
way 
they 
passed 
us 
on 
our 
left. 
That 
ought 
to 
bring 
good 
luck. 


January 
5th. 
Most 
important, 
Hella 
since 
yesterday 
evening 
--------! 
She 
did 
not 
come 
to 
school 
yesterday, 
for 
the 
day 
before 
she 
felt 
frightfully 
bad, 
and 
her 
mother 
really 
began 
to 
think 
she 
was 
going 
to 
have 
another 
attack 
of 
appendicitis. 
Instead 
of 
that!!! 
She 
looks 
so 
ill 
and 
interesting, 
I 
spent 
the 
whole 
afternoon 
and 
evening 
with 
her; 
and 
at 
first 
she 
did 
not 
want 
to 
tell 
me 
what 
was 
the 
matter. 
But 
when 
I 
said 
I 
should 
go 
away 
if 
she 
did 
not 
tell 
me, 
she 
said: 
"All 
right, 
but 
you 
must 
not 
make 
such 
idiotic 
faces, 
and 
above 
all 
you 
must 
not 
look 
at 
me." 
"Very 
well," 
I 
said, 
"I 
won't 
look, 
but 
tell 
me 
everything 
about 
it." 
So 
then 
she 
told 
me 
that 
she 
had 
felt 
frantically 
bad, 
as 
if 
she 
was 
being 
cut 
in 
two, 
much 
worse 
than 
after 
the 
appendicitis 
operation, 
and 
then 
she 
had 
frantically 
high 
fever 
and 
shivered 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
all 
Friday, 
and 
yesterday 
------tableau!! 
And 
then 
her 
mother 
told 
her 
the 
chief 
things, 
though 
she 
knew 
them 
already. 
Earlier 
on 
Friday 
the 
doctor 
had 
said: 



"Don't 
let 
us 
be 
in 
a 
hurry 
to 
think 
about 
a 
relapse, 
there 
may 
be 
other!! 
causes." 
And 
then 
he 
whispered 
to 
her 
mother, 
but 
Hella 
caught 
the 
word 
enlighten. 
Then 
she 
knew 
directly 
what 
time 
of 
day 
it 
was. 
She 
acted 
the 
innocent 
to 
her 
mother, 
as 
if 
she 
knew 
nothing 
at 
all, 
and 
her 
mother 
kissed 
her 
and 
said, 
now 
you 
are 
not 
a 
child 
any 
more, 
now 
you 
belong 
among 
the 
grown-ups. 
How 
absurd, 
so 
I 
am 
still 
a 
child! 
After 
all, 
on 
July 
30th 
I 
shall 
be 
14 
too, 
and 
at 
least 
one 
month 
before 
I 
shall 
have 
it 
too, 
so 
I 
shan't 
be 
a 
child 
for 
more 
than 
six 
months 
more. 
Hella 
and 
I 
laughed 
frightfully, 
but 
she 
is 
really 
a 
little 
puffed 
up 
about 
it; 
she 
won't 
admit 
that 
she 
is, 
but 
I 
noticed 
it 
quite 
clearly. 
The 
only 
girl 
I 
know 
who 
did 
not 
put 
on 
airs 
when 
that 
happened 
was 
Ada. 
Because 
of 
the 
school 
Hella 
is 
awfully 
shy, 
and 
before 
her 
father 
too. 
But 
her 
mother 
has 
promised 
her 
not 
to 
tell 
him. 
If 
only 
one 
can 
trust 
her!!! 


January 
7th. 
Hella 
came 
to 
school 
to-day 
in 
spite 
of 
everything. 
I 
kept 
on 
looking 
at 
her, 
and 
in 
the 
interval 
she 
said: 
"I 
have 
told 
you 
already 
that 
you 
must 
not 
stare 
at 
me 
in 
that 
idiotic 
way, 
and 
this 
is 
the 
second 
time 
I've 
had 
to 
speak 
to 
you 
about 
it. 
One 
must 
not 
make 
a 
joke 
about 
such 
things." 
I 
was 
not 
going 
to 
stand 
that. 
One 
must 
not 
look 
at 
her; 
very 
well, 
in 
the 
third 
lesson 
I 
sat 
turning 
away 
from 
her; 
then 
suddenly 
she 
hooked 
one 
of 
my 
feet 
with 
hers 
so 
that 
I 
nearly 
burst 
out 
laughing, 
and 
she 
said: 
"Do 
look 
round, 
for 
that 
way 
is 
even 
stupider." 
Of 
course 
Dunker 
promptly 
called 
us 
to 
order, 
that 
is, 
she 
told 
Hella 
to 
go 
on 
reading, 
but 
Hella 
said 
promptly 
that 
she 
felt 
very 
unwell, 
and 
that 
what 
she 
had 
said 
to 
me 
was, 
she 
would 
have 
to 
go 
home 
at 


12. 
All 
the 
girls 
looked 
at 
one 
another, 
for 
they 
all 
know 
what 
unwell 
means, 
and 
Frau 
Doktor 
Dunker 
said 
Hella 
had 
better 
leave 
directly, 
but 
she 
answered 
in 
French 
--that 
pleases 
Dunker 
awfully--that 
she 
would 
rather 
stay 
till 
the 
end 
of 
the 
lesson. 
It 
was 
simply 
splendid! 
January 
12th. 
We 
went 
to 
the 
People's 
Theatre 
to-day 
to 
the 
matinee 
of 
The 
Fourth 
Commandment. 
The 
parting 
from 
the 
grandmother 
was 
lovely; 
almost 
everyone 
was 
in 
tears. 
I 
managed 
to 
keep 
from 
crying 
because 
Dora 
was 
only 
two 
places 
from 
me, 
and 
so 
did 
Hella, 
probably 
for 
the 
same 
reason. 
Anyway 
she 
was 
not 
paying 
much 
attention 
to 
the 
play 
for 
in 
the 
main 
interval 
Lajos, 
who 
had 
been 
in 
the 
stalls, 
came 
up 
and 
said 
how 
d'you 
do 
to 
Hella 
and 
her 
mother. 
He 
wanted 
to 
go 
home 
with 
them 
after 
the 
performance. 
Jeno 
has 
mumps, 
it 
is 
a 
horrid 
sort 
of 
illness 
and 
if 
I 
had 
it 
I 
should 
never 
admit 
it. 



Those 
illnesses 
in 
which 
one 
is 
swelled 
up 
are 
the 
nastiest 
of 
all. 
The 
Sunday 
after 
next 
Lajos 
and 
Jeno 
have 
been 
invited 
to 
the 
Brs. 
and 
of 
course 
they 
asked 
me 
too, 
I 
am 
so 
glad. 


January 
18th. 
I 
have 
not 
written 
for 
a 
whole 
week, 
we 
have 
such 
a 
frantic 
lot 
of 
work, 
especially 
in 
French 
in 
which 
we 
are 
very 
backward, 
at 
least 
Dunker 
says 
so!! 
She 
can't 
stand 
Madame 
Arnau, 
that's 
obvious. 
For 
my 
part 
I 
liked 
Mad. 
Arnau 
a 
great 
deal 
better, 
if 
only 
because 
she 
had 
no 
pimples. 
And 
Prof. 
Jordan's 
History 
class 
is 
awfully 
difficult, 
because 
he 
always 
makes 
one 
find 
out 
the 
causes 
for 
oneself; 
one 
has 
to 
learn 
intelligently!, 
but 
that 
is 
very 
difficult 
in 
History. 
No 
one 
ever 
gets 
an 
Excellent 
from 
him, 
except 
Verbenowitsch 
sometimes, 
but 
she 
learns 
out 
of 
a 
book, 
not 
our 
class 
book, 
but 
the 
one 
on 
which 
Herr 
Prof. 
J. 
bases 
his 
lectures. 
And 
because 
she 
reads 
it 
all 
up 
beforehand, 
naturally 
she 
always 
knows 
all 
the 
causes 
of 
the 
war 
and 
the 
consequences. 
Really 
consequences 
means 
something 
quite 
different, 
and 
so 
Hella 
and 
I 
never 
dare 
look 
at 
one 
another 
when 
he 
is 
examining 
us 
and 
asks: 
What 
were 
the 
consequences 
of 
this 
event? 
Of 
course 
the 
Herr 
Prof. 
imagined 
that 
Franke 
was 
laughing 
at 
him 
when 
she 
was 
only 
laughing 
at 
consequences; 
and 
it 
was 
impossible 
for 
her 
to 
explain, 
especially 
to 
a 
gentleman!!!! 


January 
20th. 
When 
Dora 
and 
I 
were 
coming 
home 
from 
skating 
to-day 
we 
met 
Mademoiselle, 
and 
I 
said 
how 
d'you 
do 
to 
her 
at 
once, 
and 
I 
was 
asking 
her 
how 
she 
(much 
emphasised) 
was 
getting 
on, 
when 
suddenly 
I 
noticed 
that 
Dora 
had 
gone 
on, 
and 
Mademoiselle 
said: 
"Your 
sister 
seems 
in 
a 
great 
hurry, 
I 
don't 
want 
to 
detain 
her." 
When 
I 
caught 
Dora 
up 
and 
asked 
her: 
"Why 
did 
you 
run 
away?" 
she 
tossed 
her 
head 
and 
said: 
"That 
sort 
of 
company 
does 
not 
suit 
me." 
"What 
on 
earth 
do 
you 
mean, 
you 
were 
so 
awfully 
fond 
of 
Mad., 
and 
besides 
she 
is 
really 
lovely." 
That's 
true 
enough, 
she 
said; 
but 
it 
was 
awfully 
tactless 
of 
her 
to 
tell 
me 
of 
all 
that--you 
know 
what. 
Such 
an 
intimacy 
behind 
her 
parents' 
backs 
cannot 
possibly 
lead 
to 
happiness. 
Then 
I 
got 
in 
such 
a 
fearful 
temper 
and 
said: 
"Oh 
do 
shut 
up. 
Father 
and 
Mother 
did 
not 
know 
anything 
about 
Viktor 
either, 
and 
you 
were 
happy 
enough 
then. 
It 
is 
just 
the 
secrecy 
that 
makes 
one 
so 
happy." 
Then 
she 
said 
very 
softly: 
"Dear 
Grete, 
you 
too 
will 
change 
your 
views," 
and 
then 
we 
did 
not 
say 
another 
word. 
But 
I 
was 
awfully 
angry 
over 
her 
meanness; 
for 
first 
of 
all 
she 
wanted 
to 
hear 
the 
whole 
story, 
although 
Mad. 
never 
offered 
to 



tell 
her, 
and 
now 
she 
pretends 
that 
she 
did 
not 
wish 
it. 
If 
I 
only 
knew 
where 
to 
find 
Mad. 
I 
would 
warn 
her. 
Anyhow, 
this 
day 
week 
at 
7 
I 
shall 
take 
care 
to 
be 
in 
W. 
Street, 
and 
perhaps 
I 
may 
meet 
her, 
for 
she 
probably 
has 
a 
private 
lesson 
somewhere 
in 
that 
neighborhood. 


January 
24th. 
Mother 
is 
very 
ill 
again 
to-day, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
operation. 
I 
have 
decided 
that 
I 
won't 
go 
on 
Sunday 
to 
the 
Brs. 
although 
Jeno 
will 
be 
there, 
and 
that 
I 
won't 
wait 
about 
for 
Mademoiselle 
on 
Monday. 
I 
have 
not 
told 
Hella 
anything 
about 
this 
for 
she 
would 
probably 
say 
it 
was 
very 
stupid 
of 
me, 
but 
I 
would 
rather 
not; 
not 
because 
Dora 
has 
twice 
spoken 
to 
me 
pointedly 
about 
a 
clear 
conscience, 
but 
because 
I 
don't 
enjoy 
anything 
when 
Mother 
is 
ill. 


January 
26th. 
Mother 
is 
an 
angel. 
Yesterday 
she 
asked 
Aunt 
Dora: 
"By 
the 
way, 
Dora, 
has 
Grete 
put 
a 
fresh 
lace 
tucker 
in 
her 
blue 
frock, 
ready 
for 
the 
Brs. 
to-morrow?" 
Then 
I 
said: 
"I'm 
not 
going 
Mother," 
and 
Mother 
asked: 
"But 
why 
not, 
surely 
not 
on 
my 
account?" 
Then 
I 
rushed 
up 
to 
her 
and 
said: 
"I 
can't 
enjoy 
anything 
when 
you 
are 
ill." 
And 
then 
Mother 
was 
so 
awfully 
sweet, 
and 
she 
wept 
and 
said: 
"Such 
moments 
make 
one 
forget 
all 
pains 
and 
troubles. 
But 
really 
you 
must 
go, 
besides 
I'm 
a 
good 
deal 
better 
to-day, 
and 
to-morrow 
I 
shall 
be 
quite 
well 
again." 
So 
I 
answered: 
"All 
right, 
I'll 
go, 
but 
only 
if 
you 
are 
really 
well. 
But 
you 
must 
tell 
me 
honestly." 
But 
in 
any 
case 
I 
shan't 
go 
to 
meet 
Mademoiselle 
on 
Monday. 


January 
28th. 
It 
was 
Mathematics 
to-day 
at 
school, 
so 
I 
could 
not 
write 
yesterday. 
We 
had 
a 
heavenly 
time 
on 
Sunday. 
We 
laughed 
till 
our 
sides 
ached 
and 
Hella 
was 
nearly 
suffocated 
with 
laughing. 
Lajos 
is 
enough 
to 
give 
one 
fits; 
it 
was 
absolutely 
ripping 
the 
way 
he 
imitated 
the 
wife 
of 
Major 
Zoltan 
in 
the 
Academy 
and 
Captain 
Riffl. 
I 
can 
hardly 
write 
about 
it, 
for 
my 
hand 
shakes 
so 
with 
laughing 
when 
I 
think 
of 
it. 
And 
then, 
while 
Hella 
and 
Lajos 
were 
singing 
songs 
together, 
Jeno 
told 
me 
that 
every 
student 
in 
the 
Neustadt 
has 
an 
inamorata, 
a 
real 
one. 
Mostly 
in 
Vienna, 
but 
some 
in 
Wiener 
Neustadt 
though 
that 
is 
dangerous 
because 
of 
being 
caught. 
All 
the 
officers 
know 
about 
it, 
but 
no 
one 
must 
be 
found 
out. 
Then 
I 
told 
him 
about 
Oswald's 
affair 
and 
he 
said: 
"Oswald 
was 
a 
great 
donkey, 
you'll 
excuse 
me 
for 
saying 
so 
since 
he's 
your 
brother; 
but 
really 
he 
made 
a 
fool 
of 
himself. 
He 
was 
only 
a 
civilian; 
it's 
quite 
different 
in 
the 
army." 
Then 
I 
got 
cross 
and 
said: 
"That's 
all 
very 
well, 
Jeno, 
but 
you 
are 
not 
an 
officer 
yourself, 
so 
I 
don't 
see 
how 
you 



can 
know 
anything 
about 
it." 
Then 
he 
said 
to 
Hella: 
"I 
say, 
Ilonka, 
you 
must 
keep 
your 
friend 
in 
better 
order, 
she 
is 
rather 
inclined 
to 
be 
insubordinate." 
She 
is 
to 
make 
a 
written 
note 
of 
every 
act 
of 
insubordination, 
and 
then 
he 
will 
administer 
exemplary 
punishment. 
All 
very 
fine, 
but 
it 
will 
take 
two 
to 
that. 


January 
30th. 
I 
wish 
I 
knew 
whether 
Mademoiselle 
really 
passed 
through 
W. 
Street 
again 
at 
7 
o'clock 
on 
Monday, 
for 
she 
certainly 
said 
very 
distinctly: 
"Au 
revoir, 
ma 
cherie!" 
She 
is 
so 
pretty 
and 
so 
pale; 
perhaps 
she 
is 
really 
ill, 
and 
she 
must 
be 
awfully 
nervous 
about 
------That 
would 
be 
terrible. 
We 
wonder 
whether 
she 
knows 
about 
certain 
means, 
but 
one 
simply 
can't 
tell 
her. 


February 
2nd. 
I've 
had 
a 
wonderful 
idea 
and 
Hella 
thinks 
it 
a 
positive 
inspiration. 
We 
are 
going 
to 
write 
anonymously 
to 
Mademoiselle 
about 
those 
means, 
and 
Hella 
will 
write, 
so 
that 
no 
one 
can 
recognise 
my 
writing. 
We 
think 
something 
of 
that 
sort 
must 
have 
happened 
to 
Mademoiselle, 
for 
the 
other 
day 
I 
heard 
Mother 
say 
to 
Aunt 
Dora: 
"If 
we 
had 
known 
that, 
we 
should 
never 
have 
engaged 
her 
for 
the 
children; 
it 
will 
be 
a 
terrible 
thing 
for 
her 
parents." 
And 
Aunt 
Dora 
said: 
"Yes, 
those 
are 
the 
sort 
of 
people 
who 
hide 
their 
disgrace 
under 
the 
water." 
It 
seems 
quite 
clear, 
for 
disgrace 
means 
an 
illegitimate 
child. 
And 
the 
worst 
of 
it 
is, 
that 
they 
know 
that 
she 
has 
done 
that. 
We 
must 
help 
the 
poor 
thing. 
And 
that 
is 
why 
Dora 
is 
so 
indignant 
all 
of 
a 
sudden. 
But 
how 
can 
she 
know? 
there 
is 
nothing 
to 
notice 
yet 
in 
Mademoiselle; 
if 
there 
had 
been 
I 
should 
certainly 
have 
seen 
it, 
for 
Hella 
often 
says 
I've 
a 
keen 
eye 
for 
it. 
That 
is 
quite 
true, 
I 
was 
the 
first 
person 
to 
notice 
it 
in 
the 
maid 
at 
Prof. 
Hofer's, 
when 
even 
Father 
had 
not 
noticed 
it. 


February 
4th. 
Well, 
we 
nave 
written 
to 
her, 
at 
least 
Hella 
has, 
saying 
there 
are 
such 
means, 
and 
that 
she 
will 
find 
all 
the 
details 
in 
the 
encyclopedia. 
We 
have 
addressed 
it 
to 
F. 
M. 
and 
signed 
it 
"Someone 
who 
understands 
you." 
Unfortunately 
we 
shall 
never 
be 
able 
to 
find 
out 
whether 
she 
got 
the 
letter, 
but 
the 
main 
thing 
is 
that 
she 
should. 


February 
7th. 
What 
a 
frightful 
lot 
of 
anxiety 
a 
letter 
can 
give 
one! 
In 
the 
interval 
to-day 
the 
school 
servant 
came 
up 
to 
me 
and 
said: 
Please 
are 
you 
Fraulein 
Lainer 
of 
the 
Third. 
"There 
is 
a 
letter 
for 
you." 
I 
blushed 
furiously, 
for 
I 
thought, 
it 
must 
be 
from 
Mademoiselle, 
but 
my 
blushing 
made 
Frau 
Berger 
think 
it 
must 
be 
from 
a 
young 
man: 
"Really 
I 
ought 
to 
give 
it 
to 
the 



head 
mistress; 
I 
am 
not 
allowed 
to 
deliver 
any 
letters 
to 
the 
pupils, 
but 
in 
your 
case 
I 
will 
make 
an 
exception. 
But 
please 
remember 
if 
it 
happens 
again 
I 
shall 
have 
to 
hand 
it 
in 
to 
the 
office." 
Then 
I 
said: 
"Frau 
Berger, 
I 
am 
quite 
certain 
it 
is 
not 
from 
a 
gentleman, 
but 
from 
a 
young 
lady," 
and 
when 
she 
gave 
it 
to 
me 
I 
saw 
directly 
that 
it 
really 
was 
not 
from 
a 
gentleman 
but 
only 
from 
Ada! 
It 
really 
is 
too 
stupid 
of 
her! 
At 
the 
New 
Year 
she 
reproached 
me 
for 
having 
broken 
my 
word, 
and 
now 
she 
begs 
me 
to 
enquire 
at 
the 
Raimund 
Theatre 
or 
at 
the 
People's 
Theatre 
whether 
Herr 
G. 
is 
there; 
she 
says 
she 
can't 
live 
without 
him 
in 
St. 
P. 
But 
in 
the 
holidays 
she 
told 
me 
that 
she 
was 
not 
in 
love 
with 
him, 
that 
for 
her 
he 
was 
only 
a 
means 
to 
an 
end. 
I'm 
absolutely 
certain 
she 
said 
that. 
Nothing 
will 
induce 
me 
to 
go 
to 
enquire 
at 
a 
theatre 
office, 
and 
Hella 
says 
too 
that 
to 
make 
such 
a 
suggestion 
is 
a 
piece 
of 
impudence. 
I 
shall 
just 
write 
her 
an 
ordinary 
letter, 
telling 
her 
what 
a 
row 
she 
might 
have 
got 
me 
into 
at 
school. 
I 
really 
think 
Ada 
has 
a 
bee 
in 
her 
bonnet, 
as 
Father 
always 
says. 


February 
10th. 
I 
never 
heard 
of 
such 
a 
thing! 
I 
was 
sent 
for 
to 
the 
office 
today 
because 
the 
school 
servant 
had 
complained 
that 
on 
two 
occasions 
I 
had 
thrown 
down 
some 
orange 
peel 
at 
the 
entrance. 
It's 
quite 
true 
that 
I 
did 
drop 
one 
piece 
there 
yesterday, 
but 
I 
pushed 
it 
out 
of 
the 
way 
with 
my 
foot 
into 
the 
corner, 
and 
as 
for 
any 
other 
time 
I 
know 
nothing 
about 
it. 
But 
I 
see 
which 
way 
the 
wind 
is 
blowing. 
Frau 
Berger 
thought 
I 
would 
give 
her 
some 
money 
for 
that 
letter; 
just 
fancy, 
how 
absurd, 
money 
for 
a 
letter 
like 
that, 
I 
wouldn't 
give 
20 
kreuzer 
for 
such 
a 
letter. 
But 
since 
then 
she's 
been 
in 
a 
frightfully 
bad 
temper, 
I 
noticed 
it 
on 
Wednesday 
when 
we 
were 
wiping 
our 
shoes 
at 
the 
door. 
What 
I 
said 
to 
the 
head 
was: 
It 
happened 
only 
once, 
and 
I 
kicked 
the 
peel 
into 
the 
corner 
where 
no 
one 
could 
tread 
on 
it, 
but 
I 
certainly 
did 
not 
do 
it 
twice, 
and 
Bruckner 
can 
confirm 
what 
I 
say." 
Then 
the 
head 
said: 
"Oh 
well, 
we 
need 
not 
make 
a 
state 
affair 
of 
it, 
but 
the 
next 
time 
you 
drop 
something, 
please 
pick 
it 
up." 
Frau 
Berger 
is 
furious, 
and 
all 
we 
girls 
in 
our 
class 
have 
decided 
that 
while 
we 
won't 
make 
more 
mess 
than 
we 
need, 
still, 
we 
shan't 
be 
too 
particular. 
If 
any 
one 
of 
us 
happens 
to 
drop 
a 
piece 
of 
paper 
she 
will 
just 
let 
it 
lie. 
Such 
cheek, 
one 
really 
can't 
stand 
it! 


February 
12th. 
We 
got 
our 
reports 
to-day. 
I 
have 
not 
got 
any 
Satisfactories, 
only 
Praiseworthy 
and 
Excellent. 
Father 
and 
Mother 
are 
awfully 
pleased 
and 
they 
have 
given 
each 
of 
us 
2 
crowns. 
Indeed 
Dora 
has 
practically 
nothing 
but 



Excellents, 
only 
three 
Praiseworthies; 
but 
she 
studies 
frantically 
hard, 
and 
she 
is 
learning 
Latin 
again 
with 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
If 
she 
is 
still 
teaching 
the 
lower 
classes 
next 
year, 
I 
shall 
go 
too, 
for 
that 
way 
we 
shall 
have 
her 
for 
3 
hours 
longer 
each 
week. 
By 
the 
way, 
Franke 
has 
actually 
got 
Praiseworthy 
in 
Maths. 
and 
Physics, 
though 
she's 
hardly 
any 
good. 
The 
Nutling 
seems 
to 
give 
extraordinarily 
good 
reports, 
for 
twice 
in 
the 
Maths. 
schoolwork 
Hella 
has 
had 
an 
Unsatisfactory, 
and 
yet 
now 
in 
her 
report 
she 
has 
Praiseworthy. 
With 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
one 
has 
really 
to 
deserve 
one's 
report, 
and 
it 
was 
just 
the 
same 
last 
year 
with 
Fr. 
Dr. 
St. 
The 
worst 
of 
all 
is 
with 
Herr 
Prof. 
Jordan. 
Not 
a 
single 
one 
of 
us 
has 
got 
an 
Excellent 
except 
that 
deceitful 
cat 
Verbenowitsch. 
To-morrow 
the 
Brs. 
are 
giving 
a 
great 
birthday 
party 
because 
of 
Hella's 
14th 
birthday. 
Lajos 
and 
Jeno 
are 
coming 
and 
the 
two 
Ehrenfelds, 
because 
Hella 
is 
very 
fond 
of 
them, 
especially 
Trude, 
the 
elder, 
that 
is 
she 
is 
2 
days 
older 
than 
Kitty, 
for 
they 
are 
twins!! 
How 
awful!!! 
They 
only 
came 
to 
the 
Lyz 
this 
year, 
and 
Hella 
meets 
them 
skating 
every 
day, 
I 
don't 
because 
we 
have 
no 
season 
tickets 
this 
year 
but 
only 
take 
day 
tickets 
when 
we 
can 
go, 
because 
of 
Mother's 
illness. 
I 
am 
giving 
Hella 
an 
electric 
torch 
with 
a 
very 
powerful 
reflector, 
so 
that 
it 
really 
lights 
up 
the 
whole 
room, 
and 
an 
amber 
necklace. 


February 
14th. 
It's 
a 
good 
thing 
that 
we 
have 
the 
half-term 
holiday 
to-day 
and 
to-morrow 
for 
that 
gives 
me 
time 
to 
write 
all 
about 
yesterday. 
It 
was 
simply 
phenomenal! 
I 
went 
to 
wish 
Hella 
many 
happy 
returns 
quite 
early, 
and 
I 
stayed 
to 
dinner 
and 
Lajos 
and 
Jeno 
had 
been 
invited 
to 
dinner 
too 
in 
the 
afternoon 
the 
2 
Ehrenfelds 
came 
and 
brought 
a 
box 
of 
sweets, 
and 
3 
of 
Hella's 
girl 
cousins 
and 
two 
boys, 
one 
of 
whom 
is 
frightfully 
stupid 
and 
never 
speaks 
a 
word, 
and 
several 
aunts 
and 
other 
ladies, 
for 
the 
grown-ups 
had 
their 
friends 
too. 
But 
we 
did 
not 
bother 
about 
them, 
for 
the 
dining-room, 
Lizzi's 
room, 
and 
Hella's 
room 
had 
been 
arranged 
for 
us. 
Hella 
had 
been 
sent 
such 
a 
lot 
of 
flowers 
that 
they 
nearly 
gave 
us 
a 
headache. 
At 
dinner 
Lajos 
proposed 
a 
toast 
to 
Hella 
and 
another 
at 
tea. 
Hella 
was 
splendid, 
and 
in 
the 
evening 
she 
said 
to 
me: 
"At 
14 
one 
really 
does 
become 
a 
different 
being." 
For 
in 
proposing 
his 
toast 
Lajos 
had 
said 
that 
every 
7 
years 
a 
human 
being 
is 
completely 
changed, 
and 
Hella 
thinks 
that 
is 
perfectly 
true. 
Thank 
goodness, 
in 
6 
1/2 
months 
I 
shall 
change 
my 
whole 
being 
too. 
There 
really 
did 
seem 
to 
be 
something 
different 
about 
her, 
and 
when 
we 
all 
had 
to 
blow 
to 
extinguish 
the 
candles 
on 
her 
birthday 
cake, 
all 
except 
the 
life-light 
in 
the 
middle, 
as 
a 



sign 
that 
the 
other 
years 
have 
passed, 
she 
really 
got 
quite 
pale, 
for 
she 
was 
afraid 
that 
in 
joke 
or 
through 
awkwardness 
some 
one 
would 
blow 
out 
her 
life-
light. 
Thank 
goodness 
it 
was 
all 
right. 
I 
don't 
much 
care 
for 
such 
things 
myself, 
for 
I'm 
always 
afraid 
that 
something 
might 
happen. 
Of 
course 
I 
know 
that 
it's 
only 
a 
superstition, 
but 
it 
would 
have 
been 
horribly 
unpleasant 
if 
anyone 
had 
blown 
out 
the 
life-light. 
Openly!! 
Lajos 
gave 
Hella 
an 
enormous 
square 
box 
of 
sweets, 
and 
secretly!! 
a 
silver 
ring 
with 
a 
heart 
pendant. 
He 
wanted 
her 
to 
wear 
this 
until 
it 
is 
replaced 
by 
a 
gold 
one--the 
wedding 
ring. 
But 
she 
can't 
because 
of 
her 
parents, 
so 
she 
begged 
me 
to 
allow 
her 
to 
say 
that 
I 
had 
given 
it 
her, 
but 
that 
would 
not 
do 
either 
because 
of 
Father 
and 
Mother. 
These 
things 
are 
such 
a 
nuisance, 
and 
that 
is 
why 
no 
young 
man 
will 
ever 
go 
on 
living 
at 
home 
where 
one 
is 
continually 
being 
questioned 
about 
everything 
one 
has, 
and 
does, 
and 
wears. 
After 
tea 
we 
sang: 
"Had 
I 
but 
stayed 
on 
my 
lonely 
Hearth" 
and 
other 
sad 
songs, 
because 
they 
are 
the 
prettiest, 
and 
in 
the 
evening 
we 
danced 
while 
Hella's 
Father 
played 
for 
us; 
and 
then 
Elwira, 
the 
tall 
cousin, 
danced 
the 
czardas 
with 
Lajos, 
it 
was 
wonderful. 
I've 
never 
known 
such 
a 
birthday 
party 
as 
yesterday's. 
It's 
only 
possible 
in 
winter; 
you 
can 
never 
have 
anything 
like 
it 
on 
my 
birthday, 
July 
30th, 
for 
the 
people 
one 
is 
fondest 
of 
are 
never 
all 
together 
at 
that 
time. 
Really 
no 
one 
ought 
to 
have 
a 
birthday 
in 
the 
holiday 
months, 
but 
always 
sometime 
between 
the 
end 
of 
September 
and 
June. 
I 
do 
wish 
I 
were 
14, 
I 
simply 
can't 
wait. 
Hella's 
mother 
said 
to 
Hella, 
You 
are 
not 
a 
child 
any 
longer, 
but 
a 
grown-up; 
I 
do 
wish 
I 
were 
too!!! 


February 
16th. 
We 
have 
a 
new 
schoolfellow. 
All 
the 
girls 
and 
all 
the 
staff 
are 
delighted 
with 
her. 
She 
is 
so 
small 
she 
might 
be 
only 
10, 
but 
awfully 
pretty. 
She 
has 
brown 
curls 
(Hella 
says 
foxy 
red, 
but 
I 
don't 
agree) 
hanging 
down 
to 
her 
shoulders, 
large 
brown 
eyes, 
a 
lovely 
mouth, 
and 
a 
complexion 
like 
milk 
and 
roses. 
She 
is 
the 
daughter 
of 
a 
bank 
manager 
in 
Hamburg; 
he 
shot 
himself, 
I 
don't 
know 
why. 
Of 
course 
she 
is 
in 
mourning 
and 
it 
suits 
her 
wonderfully. 
She 
has 
a 
strong 
North 
German 
accent. 
Frau 
Doktor 
Fuchs 
is 
simply 
infatuated 
with 
her 
and 
the 
head 
is 
awfully 
fond 
of 
her 
too. 


February 
19th. 
Hella 
and 
I 
walked 
home 
to-day 
with 
Anneliese. 
She 
is 
called 
Anneliese 
von 
Zerkwitz. 
Her 
mother 
has 
been 
so 
frightfully 
upset 
by 
her 
father's 
death 
that 
she'll 
probably 
have 
to 
be 
sent 
to 
a 
sanatorium; 
that 
is 
why 
Anneliese 
has 
come 
to 
Vienna 
to 
stay 
with 
her 
uncle. 
He 
is 
a 
professor 
and 



they 
live 
in 
Wiedner 
Hauptstrasse. 
Dora 
thinks 
her 
charming 
too, 
the 
whole 
school 
is 
in 
love 
with 
her, 
she 
is 
going 
to 
gym. 
with 
us; 
I 
am 
so 
glad. 
Of 
course 
she 
won't 
stand 
near 
Hella 
and 
me 
because 
she's 
so 
small; 
but 
we 
can 
always 
keep 
an 
eye 
on 
her, 
show 
her 
everything, 
and 
help 
her 
with 
the 
apparatus. 
Hella 
is 
a 
trifle 
jealous 
and 
says: 
"It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
Anneliese 
has 
quite 
taken 
my 
place 
in 
your 
affections." 
I 
said 
that 
was 
not 
a 
bit 
true, 
but 
did 
she 
not 
think 
Anneliese 
awfully 
loveable? 
"Yes," 
said 
Hella, 
"but 
one 
must 
not 
neglect 
old 
friends 
on 
that 
account." 
"I 
certainly 
shan't 
do 
anything 
of 
the 
kind; 
but 
Anneliese 
really 
needs 
some 
one 
who 
will 
show 
her 
everything 
and 
explain 
everything." 
Besides, 
the 
head 
mistress 
and 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
placed 
her 
in 
front 
of 
me 
and 
said 
to 
us: 
"Give 
her 
a 
helping 
hand." 


February 
20th. 
It's 
such 
a 
pity 
that 
I 
can't 
ask 
Anneliese 
here, 
for 
Mother 
has 
been 
in 
bed 
for 
the 
last 
week. 
But 
she 
is 
going 
to 
Hella's 
on 
Sunday, 
and 
since 
I 
am 
going 
too 
of 
course 
I 
am 
frightfully 
glad. 
Naturally 
I 
would 
much 
rather 
have 
her 
here; 
but 
unfortunately 
it's 
impossible 
because 
of 
Mother. 
Dora 
thinks 
that 
Mother 
will 
have 
to 
have 
another 
operation, 
but 
I 
don't 
believe 
it, 
for 
such 
an 
operation 
can 
only 
be 
done 
once. 
What 
I 
can't 
understand 
is 
why 
there 
should 
be 
anything 
wrong 
with 
Mother 
if 
the 
operation 
was 
successful. 
Dora 
is 
afraid 
that 
Mother 
has 
cancer, 
that 
would 
be 
horrible; 
but 
I 
don't 
believe 
she 
has, 
because 
if 
one 
has 
cancer 
one 
can't 
recover. 


February 
23rd. 
It 
was 
heavenly 
at 
the 
Bruckners! 
Anneliese 
did 
not 
come 
until 
4, 
for 
they 
don't 
have 
dinner 
until 
3. 
She 
wore 
a 
white 
embroidered 
frock 
with 
black 
silk 
ribbons. 
Hella's 
mother 
kissed 
her 
with 
tears 
in 
her 
eyes. 
For 
her 
mother 
really 
is 
in 
a 
sanatorium 
because 
is 
suffering 
from 
nervous 
disease. 
Anneliese 
is 
living 
with 
her 
uncle 
and 
aunt. 
But 
she 
often 
cries 
because 
of 
her 
father 
and 
mother. 
Still, 
she 
enjoyed 
herself 
immensely 
in 
the 
round 
games, 
winning 
all 
the 
best 
prizes, 
a 
pocket 
comb 
and 
mirror, 
a 
box 
of 
sweets, 
a 
toy 
elephant, 
a 
negro 
with 
a 
vase, 
and 
other 
things 
as 
well. 
I 
won 
a 
pen-wiper, 
a 
double 
vase, 
a 
pencil 
holder, 
a 
lot 
of 
sweets, 
and 
a 
note 
book, 
Hella 
won 
a 
lot 
of 
things 
too, 
and 
so 
did 
her 
two 
cousins 
and 
Jenny. 


Then 
we 
had 
some 
music 
and 
Anneliese 
sang 
the 
Wacht 
am 
Rhein 
and 
a 
lot 
of 
folk 
songs; 
her 
voice 
is 
as 
sweet 
as 
herself. 
She 
was 
fetched 
at 
7, 
I 
stayed 



till 
8. 


March 
1st. 
To-morrow 
Hella 
and 
I 
have 
been 
in 
vised 
to 
Anneliese's. 
I 
am 
so 
awfully 
glad. 
I 
shall 
ask 
Mother 
to 
let 
me 
wear 
my 
new 
theatre 
blouse 
and 
the 
green 
spring 
coat 
and 
skirt. 
The 
temperature 
went 
up 
to 
54 
degrees 
to-day. 


March 
3rd. 
Yesterday 
we 
went 
to 
Anneliese's. 
She 
shares 
a 
room 
with 
her 
cousin; 
she 
is 
only 
11 
and 
goes 
to 
the 
middle 
school, 
but 
she 
is 
a 
nice 
girl 
I 
expected 
to 
find 
everything 
frightfully 
smart 
at 
Professor 
Arndt's, 
but 
it 
was 
not 
so 
at 
all. 
They 
have 
only 
3 
rooms 
not 
particularly 
well 
furnished. 
He 
has 
retired 
on 
a 
pension, 
Emmy 
is 
their 
granddaughter, 
she 
lives 
with 
them 
because 
her 
father 
is 
in 
Galicia, 
a 
captain 
or 
major 
I 
think. 
It 
was 
not 
so 
amusing 
as 
at 
Hella's. 
We 
played 
games 
without 
prizes, 
and 
that 
is 
dull; 
it 
is 
not 
that 
one 
plays 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
the 
prizes, 
but 
what's 
the 
use 
of 
playing 
if 
one 
does 
not 
win 
anything? 
Then 
they 
read 
aloud 
to 
us 
out 
of 
a 
story 
book. 
But 
what 
Hella 
and 
I 
found 
exasperating 
was 
that 
Anneliese's 
uncle 
said 
"Du" 
to 
us 
both. 
For 
Hella 
is 
14, 
and 
I 
shall 
be 
14 
in 
a 
few 
months. 
But 
Hella 
was 
quite 
right; 
in 
conversation 
she 
said: 
"At 
the 
High 
School 
only 
the 
mistresses 
say 
Du 
to 
us, 
the 
professors 
have 
to 
say 
Sie." 
Unfortunately 
he 
went 
away 
soon 
after, 
so 
we 
don't 
know 
whether 
he 
took 
the 
hint. 
Hella 
says 
too 
that 
it 
was 
not 
particularly 
entertaining. 


March 
9th. 
Oh 
dear, 
Mother 
really 
has 
got 
cancer; 
of 
course 
Father 
has 
not 
told 
us 
so, 
but 
she 
has 
to 
have 
another 
operation. 
Dora 
has 
cried 
her 
eyes 
out 
and 
my 
knees 
are 
trembling. 
She's 
going 
to 
hospital 
on 
Friday. 
Aunt 
Dora 
is 
coming 
back 
on 
Thursday 
and 
will 
stay 
here 
till 
Mother 
is 
well 
again. 
I 
do 
so 
dread 
the 
operation, 
and 
still 
more 
Mother's 
going 
away. 
It's 
horrible, 
but 
still 
lots 
of 
people 
have 
cancer 
and 
don't 
die 
of 
it. 


March 
22nd. 
Mother 
is 
coming 
home 
again 
tomorrow. 
Oh 
I 
am 
so 
glad! 
Everything 
is 
so 
quiet 
in 
the 
hospital 
and 
one 
hardly 
dares 
speak 
in 
the 
passages. 
Mother 
said: 
"I 
don't 
want 
to 
stay 
here 
any 
longer, 
let 
me 
go 
back 
to 
my 
children." 
We 
went 
to 
see 
Mother 
in 
hospital 
every 
day 
and 
took 
her 
violets 
and 
other 
flowers, 
for 
she 
was 
not 
allowed 
to 
eat 
anything 
during 
the 
first 
few 
days 
after 
the 
operation. 
But 
it's 
quite 
different 
now 
that 
she's 
home 
again. 
I 
should 
have 
liked 
to 
stay 
away 
from 
school 
to-day, 
but 
Mother 
said: 
"No, 
children, 
go 
to 
school, 
do 
it 
to 
please 
me." 
So 
of 
course 
we 
went, 
but 
I 
simply 
could 
not 
attend 
to 
my 
lessons. 



March 
24th. 
Mother 
is 
asleep 
now. 
She 
looks 
frightfully 
ill 
and 
still 
has 
a 
lot 
of 
pain. 
I'm 
sure 
the 
doctors 
can't 
really 
understand 
her 
case; 
for 
if 
they 
had 
operated 
properly 
she 
would 
not 
still 
have 
pain 
after 
the 
second 
operation. 
I 
should 
like 
to 
know 
what 
Mother 
has 
been 
talking 
to 
Dora 
about, 
for 
they 
both 
cried. 
Although 
Dora 
and 
I 
are 
on 
good 
terms 
now, 
she 
would 
not 
tell 
me, 
but 
said 
she 
had 
promised 
Mother 
not 
to 
speak 
about 
it. 
I 
can't 
believe 
that 
Mother 
has 
told 
Dora 
a 
secret, 
but 
perhaps 
it 
was 
something 
about 
marrying. 
For 
Dora 
only 
said: 
"Besides, 
Mother 
did 
not 
need 
to 
say 
that 
to 
me, 
for 
my 
mind 
was 
quite 
made 
up 
in 
any 
case." 
I 
do 
hate 
such 
hints, 
it's 
better 
to 
say 
nothing 
at 
all. 
As 
soon 
as 
Mother 
can 
get 
up 
she 
is 
going 
to 
Abbazia 
for 
a 
change, 
and 
most 
likely 
Dora 
will 
go 
with 
her. 


March 
26th. 
Mother 
and 
Dora 
are 
going 
to 
Abbazzia 
next 
week. 
Dora 
thinks 
I 
envy 
her 
the 
journey, 
and 
she 
said: 
"I 
would 
willingly 
renounce 
the 
jour-ney 
and 
the 
seaside 
if 
only 
Mother 
would 
get 
well 
And 
this 
year 
when 
I 
have 
to 
matriculate, 
I 
certainly 
should 
not 
go 
for 
pleasure." 
I'm 
so 
awfully 
miserable 
that 
I 
simply 
can't 
wear 
a 
red 
ribbon 
in 
my 
hair, 
though 
red 
suits 
me 
best. 
I 
generally 
wear 
a 
black 
one 
now, 
but 
since 
yesterday 
a 
brown 
one, 
for 
Mother 
said: 
"Oh, 
Gretel, 
do 
give 
up 
that 
black 
ribbon; 
it 
looks 
so 
gloomy 
and 
does 
not 
suit 
you 
at 
all. 
Of 
course 
I 
could 
not 
tell 
Mother 
how 
I 
was 
feeling, 
so 
I 
took 
the 
brown 
one 
and 
said 
the 
red 
ribbon 
was 
quite 
worn 
out. 


April 
12th. 
I 
never 
get 
my 
diary 
written. 
It's 
so 
gloomy 
at 
home 
for 
Mother 
is 
very 
bad. 
Oswald 
is 
coming 
home 
to-morrow 
for 
the 
Easter 
holidays 
and 
Mother 
is 
looking 
forward 
so 
to 
seeing 
him. 
I 
was 
to 
have 
gone 
with 
Hella 
and 
her 
father 
to 
Maria-Zell, 
for 
this 
year 
they 
are 
probably 
going 
to 
take 
a 
house 
for 
the 
summer 
in 
Mitterbach 
or 
Mitterberg 
near 
Maria-Zell. 
But 
I 
am 
not 
going 
after 
all, 
for 
I 
don't 
feel 
inclined, 
and 
I 
think 
Mother 
is 
better 
pleased 
that 
I 
should 
not; 
for 
she 
said: 
"So 
I 
shall 
have 
all 
my 
three 
darlings 
together 
here 
at 
Easter." 
When 
she 
said 
that 
I 
wanted 
to 
cry, 
and 
I 
ran 
quickly 
out 
of 
the 
room 
so 
that 
she 
might 
not 
see 
me. 
But 
she 
must 
have 
seen, 
for 
after 
dinner 
she 
said: 
"Gretel, 
if 
you 
really 
want 
to 
go 
with 
the 
Bruckners, 
I 
should 
like 
you 
to; 
I 
should 
be 
so 
glad 
for 
you 
to 
have 
a 
little 
pleasure, 
you 
have 
not 
had 
much 
enjoyment 
all 
the 
winter." 
And 
then 
I 
could 
not 
stop 
myself, 
and 
I 
burst 
out 
crying 
and 
said: 
"No, 
Mother, 
I 
won't 
go 
on 
any 
account. 
All 
I 
want 
is 
that 
you 
should 
get 
quite 
well 
again." 
And 
then 
Mother 



cried 
too 
and 
said: 
Darling, 
I'm 
afraid 
I 
shall 
never 
be 
quite 
well 
again, 
but 
I 
should 
like 
to 
stay 
until 
you 
are 
all 
grown 
up; 
after 
that 
you 
won't 
need 
me 
so 
much." 
Then 
Dora 
came 
in 
and 
when 
she 
saw 
that 
Mother 
was 
crying 
she 
said 
that 
Father 
had 
sent 
for 
me. 
He 
hadn't 
really 
but 
in 
the 
evening 
she 
told 
me 
that 
Mother's 
illness 
was 
hopeless, 
but 
that 
I 
must 
not 
do 
anything 
to 
upset 
her 
or 
let 
her 
see 
what 
I 
was 
feeling. 
And 
then 
we 
both 
cried 
a 
lot 
and 
promised 
one 
another 
that 
we 
would 
always 
stay 
with 
Father. 


May 
16th. 
Mother 
died 
on 
April 
24th, 
the 
Sunday 
after 
Easter. 
We 
are 
all 
so 
awfully 
unhappy. 
Hardly 
anyone 
says 
a 
word 
at 
mealtimes, 
only 
Father 
speaks 
to 
us 
so 
lovingly. 
Most 
likely 
Aunt 
Dora 
will 
stay 
here 
for 
good. 
It's 
not 
three 
weeks 
yet 
since 
Mother 
was 
buried, 
but 
in 
one 
way 
we 
feel 
as 
if 
she 
had 
already 
been 
dead 
three 
years, 
and 
in 
another 
way 
one 
is 
always 
suddenly 
wanting 
to 
go 
into 
her 
room, 
to 
ask 
her 
something 
or 
tell 
her 
something. 
And 
when 
we 
go 
to 
bed 
we 
talk 
about 
her 
for 
such 
a 
long 
time, 
and 
then 
I 
dream 
about 
her 
all 
night. 
Why 
should 
people 
die? 
Or 
at 
least 
only 
quite 
old 
people, 
who 
no 
longer 
have 
anyone 
to 
care 
about 
it. 
But 
a 
mother 
and 
a 
father 
ought 
never 
to 
die. 
The 
night 
after 
Mother 
died 
Hella 
wanted 
me 
to 
come 
and 
stay 
with 
them, 
but 
I 
preferred 
to 
stay 
at 
home; 
but 
late 
in 
the 
evening 
I 
did 
not 
dare 
to 
go 
into 
the 
hall 
alone, 
so 
Dora 
went 
with 
me. 
Father 
had 
locked 
the 
door 
into 
the 
drawing-room, 
where 
Mother 
was 
laid 
out, 
but 
all 
the 
same 
it 
was 
awfully 
creepy. 
They 
did 
not 
call 
me 
on 
the 
24th 
until 
after 
Mother 
was 
dead; 
I 
should 
have 
so 
liked 
to 
see 
her 
once 
more. 
Good 
God, 
why 
should 
one 
die? 
If 
only 
I 
had 
been 
called 
Berta 
after 
her; 
but 
she 
did 
not 
wish 
that 
either 
of 
us 
should 
be 
called 
after 
her, 
nor 
did 
Father 
wish 
it 
in 
Oswald's 
case. 


May 
19th. 
When 
Mother 
was 
buried, 
one 
thing 
made 
me 
frightfully 
angry 
with 
Dora, 
at 
least 
not 
really 
angry 
but 
hurt, 
that 
she 
should 
have 
gone 
into 
church 
and 
come 
out 
of 
church 
with 
Father. 
For 
I 
have 
always 
gone 
with 
Father 
and 
Dora 
has 
always 
gone 
with 
Mother. 
And 
while 
poor 
Mother 
was 
in 
hospital, 
Dora 
went 
with 
Aunt. 
But 
at 
the 
funeral 
Father 
went 
with 
her, 
and 
I 
had 
to 
go 
with 
Aunt 
Dora. 
A 
few 
days 
later 
I 
spoke 
to 
her 
about 
it, 
and 
she 
said 
it 
was 
quite 
natural 
because 
she 
is 
the 
elder. 
She 
said 
that 
Oswald 
ought 
to 
have 
gone 
with 
me, 
that 
that 
would 
have 
been 
the 
proper 
thing. 
But 
he 
went 
alone. 
Another 
thing 
that 
annoys 
me 
is 
this; 
when 
Aunt 
Dora 
came 
here 
in 
the 
autumn, 
Dora 
and 
I 
sat 
on 
the 
same 
side 
of 
the 
table 
at 
dinner 
and 
supper, 
and 
Aunt 
sat 
opposite 
Mother, 
and 
when 
Mother 
took 
to 
her 
bed 
her 



place 
was 
left 
vacant. 
After 
she 
died 
Oswald 
sat 
on 
the 
fourth 
side, 
and 
now 
for 
about 
a 
week 
Dora 
has 
been 
sitting 
in 
Mother's 
place. 
I 
can't 
understand 
how 
Father 
can 
allow 
it! 


May 
19th. 
At 
dinner 
to-day 
no 
one 
could 
eat 
anything. 
For 
we 
had 
breast 
of 
veal, 
and 
we 
had 
had 
the 
same 
thing 
on 
the 
day 
of 
poor 
Mother's 
funeral, 
and 
when 
the 
joint 
was 
brought 
in 
I 
happened 
to 
look 
at 
Dora 
and 
saw 
that 
she 
was 
quite 
red 
and 
was 
sobbing 
frightfully. 
Then 
I 
could 
not 
contain 
myself 
any 
more 
and 
said: 
"I 
can't 
eat 
any 
breast 
of 
veal, 
for 
on 
Mother's 
burial 
day 
-----," 
then 
I 
could 
not 
say 
any 
more, 
and 
Father 
stood 
up 
and 
came 
round 
to 
me, 
and 
Dora 
and 
Aunt 
Dora 
burst 
out 
crying 
too. 
And 
after 
dinner 
Aunt 
promised 
us 
that 
we 
should 
never 
have 
breast 
of 
veal 
again. 
For 
tea, 
Aunt 
Dora 
ordered 
an 
Ulm 
cake 
because 
we 
had 
eaten 
hardly 
anything 
at 
dinner. 


May 
26th. 
To-day 
is 
the 
first 
day 
of 
Dora's 
written 
matriculation. 
Father 
wanted 
her 
to 
withdraw 
because 
she 
looks 
so 
ill, 
but 
she 
would 
not 
for 
she 
said 
it 
would 
be 
a 
distraction 
for 
her 
and 
that 
she 
would 
like 
to 
finish 
with 
the 
High 
School. 
Next 
year 
she 
is 
to 
go 
to 
a 
preparatory 
school 
for 
the 
Gymnasium. 
She 
ought 
really 
to 
go 
to 
a 
dancing 
class, 
for 
she 
is 
nearly 
17, 
but 
since 
she 
is 
in 
mourning 
it 
is 
quite 
impossible 
and 
of 
course 
she 
does 
not 
want 
to 
go 
anyhow. 
The 
head 
thought 
too 
that 
Dora 
would 
withdraw 
from 
the 
examination 
because 
she 
is 
so 
overwrought, 
but 
she 
did 
not 
want 
to 
withdraw. 
The 
staff 
were 
so 
awfully 
sweet 
to 
us 
after 
Mother's 
death, 
at 
least 
the 
women 
teachers 
were. 
The 
professors 
don't 
bother 
themselves 
about 
our 
private 
concerns, 
for 
they 
only 
see 
us 
for 
1 
or 
2 
hours 
a 
week. 
Frau 
Doktor 
Steiner, 
from 
whom 
we 
don't 
have 
any 
lessons 
this 
year, 
was 
awfully 
sympathetic; 
I 
saw 
plainly 
that 
she 
had 
tears 
in 
her 
eyes, 
and 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
was 
an 
angel 
as 
she 
always 
is! 
We 
did 
not 
go 
to 
the 
spring 
festival 
on 
May 
20th, 
though 
Father 
said 
we 
could 
go 
if 
we 
liked. 
Hella 
and 
Anneliese 
were 
awfully 
anxious 
that 
I 
should 
go; 
but 
I 
would 
not, 
and 
indeed 
I 
shall 
never 
go 
to 
any 
more 
amusements. 
No 
doubt 
the 
others 
enjoyed 
themselves 
immensely, 
but 
for 
Dora 
and 
me 
it 
would 
have 
been 
horrible. 
In 
the 
evenings 
I 
often 
fancy 
to 
myself 
that 
it 
is 
not 
really 
true, 
that 
Mother 
has 
simply 
gone 
to 
Franzensbad 
and 
will 
be 
back 
soon. 
And 
then 
I 
cry 
until 
my 
head 
aches 
or 
until 
Dora 
says: 
"Oh 
Gretel, 
I 
do 
wish 
you'd 
stop, 
it's 
awful." 
She 
often 
cries 
herself, 
I 
can 
hear 
her 
quite 
well, 
but 
I 
never 
say 
anything. 



June 
4th. 
So 
Dora 
looks 
upon 
Mother's 
death 
as 
a 
sign 
of 
God's 
displeasure 
against 
Father! 
But 
what 
could 
we 
have 
done 
to 
prevent 
it? 
She 
said, 
Oh, 
yes, 
we 
did 
a 
lot 
of 
things 
we 
ought 
not 
to 
have 
done, 
and 
above 
all 
we 
had 
secrets 
from 
Mother. 
That 
is 
why 
God 
has 
punished 
us. 
It's 
horrible, 
and 
now 
that 
she 
is 
always 
speaking 
of 
the 
eye 
of 
God 
and 
the 
finger 
of 
God 
it 
makes 
me 
so 
terribly 
afraid 
to 
go 
into 
a 
dark 
room, 
because 
I 
always 
feel 
there 
is 
some 
one 
there 
who 
is 
eying 
me 
and 
wants 
to 
seize 
me. 


June 
8th. 
Father 
is 
in 
a 
frightful 
rage 
with 
Dora; 
yesterday 
evening, 
when 
I 
opened 
the 
drawing-room 
door 
and 
there 
was 
Father 
coming 
out, 
quite 
unintentionally 
I 
gave 
a 
yell, 
and 
when 
Father 
asked 
what 
was 
the 
matter 
I 
told 
him 
about 
God's 
displeasure; 
only 
I 
did 
not 
tell 
him 
it 
was 
against 
him, 
but 
only 
against 
Dora 
and 
me. 
And 
then 
Father 
was 
frightfully 
angry 
for 
the 
first 
time 
since 
Mother's 
death, 
and 
he 
told 
Dora 
she 
was 
not 
to 
upset 
me 
with 
her 
ill-conditioned 
fancies, 
and 
Dora 
nearly 
had 
an 
attack 
of 
palpitation 
so 
that 
the 
doctor 
had 
to 
be 
sent 
for. 
Aunt 
came 
to 
sleep 
in 
our 
room 
and 
we 
both 
had 
to 
take 
bromide. 
To-day 
Father 
was 
awfully 
kind 
to 
us 
and 
said: 
"Girls, 
you've 
no 
reason 
to 
reproach 
yourselves, 
you 
have 
always 
been 
good 
children, 
and 
I 
hope 
you 
always 
will 
be 
good." 
Yes, 
I 
will 
be, 
for 
Mother's 
eye 
watches 
over 
us. 
Hella 
thinks 
I 
look 
very 
poorly, 
and 
she 
asked 
me 
today 
whether 
perhaps 
. 
. 
. 
. 
?? 
But 
I 
told 
her 
that 
I 
would 
not 
talk 
about 
such 
things 
any 
more, 
that 
it 
would 
be 
an 
offence 
to 
my 
Mother's 
memory. 
She 
wanted 
to 
say 
something 
more, 
but 
I 
said: 
"No, 
Hella, 
I 
simply 
won't 
talk 
about 
that 
any 
more. 
You 
can't 
understand, 
because 
your 
mother 
is 
still 
alive." 


June 
12th. 
It 
is 
awful; 
just 
when 
I 
did 
not 
want 
to 
think 
any 
more 
about 
such 
things, 
there 
comes 
an 
affair 
of 
that 
very 
sort! 
I'm 
in 
a 
frightful 
mess 
through 
no 
fault 
of 
my 
own. 
Just 
after 
9 
to-day 
a 
girl 
from 
the 
Second 
came 
in 
to 
our 
Mathematic 
les-son 
and 
said: 
"The 
head 
mistress 
wishes 
to 
see 
Lainer, 
Bruckner, 
and 
Franke 
in 
the 
office 
directly. 
All 
the 
girls 
looked 
at 
us, 
but 
we 
did 
not 
know 
why. 
When 
we 
came 
into 
the 
office, 
the 
door 
of 
the 
head's 
room 
was 
shut 
and 
Fraulein 
N. 
told 
us 
to 
wait. 
Then 
the 
head 
came 
out 
and 
called 
me 
in. 
Inside 
a 
lady 
was 
sitting, 
and 
she 
looked 
at 
me 
through 
a 
lorgnon. 
"Do 
you 
spend 
much 
time 
with 
Zerkwitz?" 
asked 
the 
head. 
Yes, 
said 
I, 
and 
I 
had 
a 
foreboding. 
"This 
lady 
is 
Zerkwitz's 
mother, 
she 
complains 
that 
you 
talk 
about 
very 
improper 
things 
with 
her 
daughter; 
is 
it 
so?" 
"Hella 
and 
I 
never 



wanted 
to 
tell 
her 
anything; 
but 
she 
begged 
us 
to 
again 
and 
again, 
and 
besides 
we 
thought 
she 
really 
knew 
it 
anyhow 
and 
only 
pretended 
she 
didn't." 
"What 
did 
you 
think 
she 
knew, 
and 
what 
did 
you 
talk 
to 
her 
about?" 
broke 
in 
Anneliese's 
mother. 
"Excuse 
me," 
said 
the 
head, 
"I 
will 
examine 
the 
girls; 
so 
Bruckner 
was 
concerned 
in 
the 
matter 
too?" 
"Very 
seldom," 
said 
I; 
"Yes, 
the 
chief 
offender 
is 
Lainer, 
the 
girl 
whose 
mother 
died 
recently." 
Then 
I 
choked 
down 
my 
tears, 
and 
said: 
"We 
should 
never 
have 
said 
a 
word 
about 
these 
matters 
unless 
Anneliese 
had 
kept 
on 
at 
us." 
After 
that 
I 
would 
not 
answer 
any 
more 
questions. 
Then 
Hella 
was 
called 
in. 
She 
told 
me 
afterwards 
that 
she 
knew 
what 
was 
up 
directly 
she 
saw 
my 
face. 
"What 
have 
you 
been 
talking 
about 
to 
Zerkwitz?" 
Hella 
would 
not 
say 
at 
first, 
but 
then 
she 
said 
in 
as 
few 
words 
as 
possible: 
"About 
getting 
babies, 
and 
about 
being 
married!" 
"Gracious 
goodness, 
such 
little 
brats, 
and 
to 
talk 
about 
such 
things," 
said 
Anneliese's 
mother. 
"Such 
corrupt 
minds." 
"We 
did 
not 
believe 
that 
Anneliese 
did 
not 
really 
know, 
or 
we 
should 
never 
have 
told 
her 
anything," 
said 
Hella 
just 
as 
I 
had; 
she 
was 
simply 
splendid. 
"As 
regards 
Alfred, 
we 
have 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
that, 
and 
we 
have 
often 
advised 
her 
not 
to 
allow 
him 
to 
meet 
her 
coming 
home 
from 
school; 
but 
she 
would 
not 
listen 
to 
us." 
"I 
am 
talking 
about 
your 
conversations 
with 
which 
you 
have 
corrupted 
the 
poor 
innocent 
child," 
said 
Frau 
von 
Zerkwitz. 
"She 
certainly 
must 
have 
known 
something 
about 
it 
before, 
or 
she 
would 
not 
have 
gone 
with 
Alfred 
or 
wanted 
to 
talk 
about 
it 
with 
us," 
said 
Hella. 
"Heavenly 
Father, 
that 
is 
worse 
still; 
such 
corruptness 
of 
mind!" 
Then 
we 
were 
sent 
out 
of 
the 
room. 
Outside, 
Hella 
cried 
frightfully, 
and 
so 
did 
I, 
for 
we 
were 
afraid 
there 
would 
be 
a 
row 
at 
home. 
We 
could 
not 
go 
back 
into 
the 
Mathematic 
lesson 
because 
we 
had 
been 
crying 
such 
a 
lot. 
In 
the 
interval 
Hella 
walked 
past 
Anneliese 
and 
said 
out 
loud: 
"Traitress!!" 
and 
spat 
at 
her. 
For 
that 
she 
was 
ordered 
out 
of 
the 
ranks. 
I 
stepped 
out 
of 
the 
ranks 
too, 
and 
when 
Frau 
Professor 
Kreindl 
said: 
"Not 
you, 
Lainer, 
you 
go 
on," 
I 
said: 
"Excuse 
me, 
I 
spat 
at 
her 
too," 
and 
went 
and 
stood 
beside 
Hella. 
All 
the 
girls 
looked 
at 
us. 
It 
was 
plain 
that 
Frau 
Prof. 
Kreindl 
knew 
all 
about 
it 
already 
for 
she 
did 
not 
say 
any 
more. 
In 
the 
German 
lesson 
from 
11 
to 
12 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
said: 
"Girls, 
why 
can't 
you 
keep 
the 
peace 
together? 
This 
continual 
misconduct 
is 
really 
too 
bad, 
and 
serves 
only 
to 
make 
trouble 
for 
you 
and 
for 
your 
parents 
and 
for 
us." 
Just 
before 
12 
Hella 
and 
I 
were 
summoned 
to 
the 
head's 
room 
again. 
"Girls," 
she 
said, 
"it's 
a 
horrible 
business 
this. 
Even 
if 
your 
own 
imaginations 
have 
been 
prematurely 
poisoned, 
why 
should 
you 
try 
to 
corrupt 
others? 
As 
for 
you, 
Lainer, 
you 



ought 
to 
be 
especially 
ashamed 
of 
yourself 
that 
such 
complaints 
should 
be 
made 
of 
you 
when 
your 
mother 
has 
been 
buried 
only 
a 
few 
weeks." 
"Excuse 
me," 
said 
Hella, 
"all 
this 
happened 
in 
the 
spring, 
and 
even 
earlier, 
in 
the 
winter, 
for 
we 
were 
still 
skating 
at 
the 
time. 
Rita's 
mother 
was 
pretty 
well 
then. 
Besides, 
Zerkwitz 
was 
continually 
pestering 
us 
to 
tell 
her. 
I 
often 
warned 
Rita, 
and 
said: 
"Don't 
trust 
her," 
but 
she 
was 
quite 
infatuated 
with 
Zerkwitz. 
Please, 
Frau 
Direktorin, 
don't 
say 
anything 
about 
it 
to 
Rita's 
father, 
for 
he 
would 
be 
frightfully 
upset." 


Hella 
was 
simply 
splendid, 
I 
shall 
never 
forget. 
She 
does 
not 
want 
me 
to 
write 
that; 
we 
are 
writing 
together. 
Hella 
thinks 
we 
must 
write 
it 
all 
down 
word 
for 
word, 
for 
one 
never 
can 
tell 
what 
use 
it 
may 
be. 
No 
one 
ever 
had 
a 
friend 
like 
Hella, 
and 
she 
is 
so 
brave 
and 
clever. 
"You 
are 
just 
as 
clever," 
she 
says, 
"but 
you 
get 
so 
easily 
overawed, 
and 
besides 
you 
are 
still 
quite 
nervous 
because 
of 
your 
mother's 
death. 
I 
only 
hope 
your 
father 
won't 
hear 
anything 
about 
it." 
That 
stupid 
idiot 
dug 
up 
the 
old 
story 
about 
the 
two 
students 
on 
the 
ice, 
a 
thing 
that 
was 
over 
and 
done 
with 
ages 
ago. 
"You 
should 
never 
trust 
anyone," 
says 
Hella, 
and 
she's 
perfectly 
right. 
I 
never 
could 
have 
believed 
Anneliese 
would 
be 
such 
a 
sneak. 
We 
don't 
know 
yet 
what 
was 
up 
with 
Franke. 
As 
she 
came 
in 
she 
put 
her 
finger 
to 
her 
lips, 
meaning 
of 
course 
"Betray 
nothing!" 


June 
15th. 
The 
school 
inspector 
came 
to-day. 
I 
was 
at 
the 
blackboard 
in 
the 
Maths 
lesson, 
when 
there 
was 
a 
knock 
at 
the 
door 
and 
the 
head 
came 
in 
with 
the 
Herr 
Insp. 
For 
a 
moment 
I 
thought 
he 
had 
come 
about 
that 
matter, 
and 
I 
went 
as 
white 
as 
a 
sheet 
(at 
least 
the 
girls 
say 
I 
did; 
Hella 
says 
I 
looked 
like 
Niobe 
mourning 
for 
her 
children). 
Thank 
goodness, 
the 
sum 
was 
an 
easy 
one, 
and 
besides 
I 
can 
always 
do 
sums; 
in 
Maths 
and 
French 
I 
am 
the 
best 
in 
the 
class. 
But 
the 
Herr 
Insp. 
saw 
that 
I 
had 
tears 
in 
my 
eyes 
and 
said 
something 
to 
the 
head; 
then 
the 
head 
said: 
"She 
has 
recently 
lost 
her 
mother." 
Then 
the 
Herr 
Insp. 
praised 
me, 
and 
like 
a 
stupid 
idiot 
I 
must 
needs 
begin 
to 
howl. 
The 
head 
said: 
"It's 
all 
right 
L., 
sit 
down," 
and 
stroked 
my 
hair. 
She 
is 
so 
awfully 
sweet, 
and 
I 
do 
hope 
that 
she 
and 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
will 
say 
a 
word 
for 
me 
at 
the 
Staff 
Meeting. 
And 
I 
do 
hope 
that 
Father 
won't 
hear 
anything 
of 
it, 
for 
of 
course 
he 
would 
reproach 
me 
dreadfully 
because 
it 
all 
comes 
so 
soon 
after 
Mother's 
death. 
But 
really 
it 
all 
happened 
long 
before 
that. 
The 
way 
it 
all 
happened 
was 
that 
Hella's 
mother 
went 
away 
to 
see 
Emmy, 
her 
married 



niece, 
who 
was 
having 
her 
first 
baby. 
And 
then 
it 
was 
that 
we 
told 
the 
"innocent 
child" 
(that's 
what 
we 
call 
the 
deceitful 
cat) 
everything. 
Hella 
still 
thinks 
that 
the 
"innocent 
child" 
was 
a 
humbug. 
That 
is 
quite 
likely, 
for 
after 
all 
she 
is 
nearly 
fourteen; 
and 
at 
14 
one 
must 
surely 
know 
a 
great 
deal 
already; 
it's 
impossible 
that 
at 
that 
age 
a 
girl 
can 
continue 
to 
believe 
in 
the 
stork 
story, 
as 
Anneliese 
is 
said!!! 
to 
have 
done. 
Hella 
thinks 
that 
I 
shall 
soon 
be 
"developed" 
too, 
because 
I 
always 
have 
such 
black 
rings 
under 
my 
eyes. 
I 
overheard 
Frau 
von 
Zerkwitz 
say, 
"Little 
brats;" 
but 
Hella 
says 
that 
the 
head 
hemmed 
loudly 
to 
drown 
it. 
Afterwards 
Hella 
was 
in 
fits 
of 
laughter 
over 
the 
expression 
"little 
brats" 
for 
her 
mother 
always 
says 
about 
such 
things; 
Little 
brats 
like 
you 
have 
no 
concern 
with 
such 
matters. 
Good 
Lord, 
when 
is 
one 
to 
learn 
all 
about 
it 
if 
one 
does 
not 
know 
when 
one 
is 
nearly 
14! 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact 
both 
Hella 
and 
I 
learned 
these 
things 
very 
early, 
and 
it 
has 
not 
done 
us 
any 
harm. 
Hella's 
mother 
always 
says 
that 
if 
one 
learns 
such 
things 
too 
early 
one 
gets 
to 
look 
old; 
but 
of 
course 
that's 
nonsense. 
But 
why 
do 
mothers 
not 
want 
us 
to 
know? 
I 
suppose 
they're 
just 
ashamed. 


June 
16th. 
Yesterday 
evening 
after 
we 
had 
gone 
to 
bed, 
Dora 
said: 
"What 
were 
you 
really 
talking 
about 
to 
Z., 
or 
whatever 
her 
name 
is? 
The 
head 
called 
me 
into 
the 
office 
to-day 
and 
told 
me 
that 
you 
had 
been 
talking 
of 
improper 
matters. 
She 
said 
I 
must 
watch 
over 
you 
in 
Mother's 
place!" 
Well 
that 
would 
be 
a 
fine 
thing! 
Besides, 
it 
all 
happened 
when 
Mother 
was 
still 
alive. 
A 
mother 
never 
knows 
what 
children 
are 
talking 
of 
together. 
Dora 
thinks 
that 
I 
shall 
have 
a 
written 
Reprimand 
from 
the 
Staff 
Meeting. 
I 
should 
hate 
that 
because 
of 
Father; 
that 
would 
mean 
another 
fearful 
row; 
although 
Father 
is 
really 
awfully 
sweet 
now; 
I 
have 
not 
had 
a 
single 
rowing 
since 
Mother 
first 
got 
ill. 
It's 
quite 
true 
that 
death 
makes 
people 
gentle, 
but 
why? 
Really 
one 
would 
have 
thought 
people 
would 
get 
disagreeable, 
because 
they've 
been 
so 
much 
distressed. 
Last 
week 
the 
tombstone 
was 
put 
up 
and 
we 
all 
went 
to 
see 
it. 
I 
should 
like 
to 
go 
alone 
to 
the 
cemetery 
once 
at 
least, 
for 
one 
does 
not 
like 
to 
weep 
before 
the 
others. 


June 
18th. 
The 
"innocent 
child" 
does 
not 
come 
to 
gym. 
any 
longer, 
at 
least 
she 
has 
not 
been 
since 
that 
affair. 
We 
think 
she's 
afraid, 
although 
we 
should 
not 
say 
anything 
to 
her. 
We 
punish 
her 
with 
silent 
contempt, 
she'll 
feel 
that 
more 
than 
anything. 
And 
thank 
goodness 
she 
does 
not 
come 
to 
play 
tennis. 
I 
do 
hate 
people 
who 
are 
deceitful, 
for 
one 
never 
knows 
where 
to 
have 
them. 



When 
a 
girl 
tells 
an 
outright 
cram, 
then 
I 
can 
at 
least 
say 
to 
her: 
Oh, 
clear 
out, 
don't 
tell 
such 
a 
frightful 
whacker; 
I 
was 
not 
born 
yesterday. 
But 
one 
has 
no 
safeguard 
against 
deceitfulness. 
That's 
why 
I 
don't 
like 
cats. 
We 
have 
another 
name 
for 
the 
"innocent 
child," 
we 
call 
her 
the 
"red 
cat." 
I 
think 
she 
knows. 
Day 
after 
tomorrow 
is 
the 
school 
outing 
to 
Carnuntum. 
I 
am 
so 
excited. 
We 
have 
to 
be 
at 
the 
quay 
at 
half 
past 
7. 


June 
21st. 
The 
outing 
was 
lovely. 
Hella 
was 
to 
come 
and 
fetch 
me. 
But 
she 
overslept 
herself, 
so 
her 
mother 
took 
a 
taxi; 
and 
luckily 
I 
had 
waited 
for 
her. 
I 
should 
like 
to 
be 
always 
driving 
in 
a 
taxi. 
Dora 
would 
not 
wait, 
and 
went 
away 
at 
a 
quarter 
to 
7 
by 
electric 
car. 
At 
a 
quarter 
to 
8 
Hella 
came 
in 
the 
taxi, 
and 
just 
before 
the 
ship 
weighed 
anchor 
(I 
believe 
one 
ought 
only 
to 
say 
that 
of 
a 
sailing 
ship 
at 
sea, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
matter, 
I'm 
not 
Marina 
who 
knows 
everything 
about 
the 
navy), 
that 
is 
just 
at 
the 
right 
moment, 
we 
arrived. 
They 
all 
stared 
at 
us 
when 
we 
came 
rushing 
up 
in 
the 
taxi. 
I 
tumbled 
down 
as 
I 
got 
out 
of 
the 
car, 
it 
was 
stupid; 
but 
I 
don't 
think 
they 
all 
noticed 
it. 
Aunt 
Dora 
said 
that 
for 
this 
one 
day 
we 
had 
better 
put 
off 
our 
mourning, 
and 
Father 
said 
so 
too, 
so 
we 
wore 
our 
white 
embroidered 
frocks 
and 
Aunt 
Dora 
was 
awfully 
good 
and 
had 
made 
us 
black 
sashes; 
it 
looked 
frightfully 
smart, 
and 
they 
say 
that 
people 
wear 
mourning 
like 
that 
in 
America. 
I 
do 
love 
America, 
the 
land 
of 
liberty. 
Boys 
(that 
is 
young 
students) 
and 
girls 
go 
to 
school 
together 
there!! 
------But 
about 
the 
outing. 
In 
the 
boat 
we 
sat 
next 
Frau 
Doktor 
M., 
she 
was 
awfully 
nice; 
Hella 
was 
on 
the 
right 
and 
I 
was 
on 
the 
left, 
and 
we 
sat 
so 
close 
that 
she 
said: 
"Girls, 
you're 
squashing 
me, 
or 
at 
least 
you're 
crushing 
my 
dress!" 
She 
was 
wearing 
a 
white 
frock 
and 
had 
a 
coral 
necklace 
which 
suited 
her 
simply 
splendidly. 
When 
we 
were 
near 
Hainburg 
Hella's 
hat 
fell 
into 
the 
Danube, 
and 
all 
the 
girls 
screamed 
because 
they 
thought 
a 
child 
had 
fallen 
overboard. 
But 
thank 
goodness 
it 
was 
only 
the 
hat. 
We 
went 
up 
the 
Schlossberg 
and 
had 
a 
lovely 
view, 
that 
is, 
I 
did 
not 
look 
at 
anything 
except 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
because 
she 
was 
so 
lovely; 
Professor 
Wilke 
was 
with 
us, 
and 
he 
went 
about 
with 
her 
all 
the 
time. 
The 
girls 
say 
he 
will 
probably 
marry 
her, 
perhaps 
in 
the 
holidays. 
Oh 
dear, 
that 
would 
be 
horrid. 
Hella 
thinks 
that 
is 
quite 
out 
of 
the 
question 
because 
of 
the 
German 
professor; 
at 
any 
rate 
it 
would 
be 
better 
for 
her 
to 
marry 
Professor 
W. 
than 
the 
other, 
because 
he 
is 
said 
to 
be 
a 
Jew. 
"Still, 
with 
regard 
to 
all 
the 
things 
that 
hang 
upon 
marriage, 
it's 
the 
same 
with 
every 
man," 
said 
I. 
"That's 
just 
the 
chief 
point, 
you 
little 
goose," 
said 
Hella. 
And 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
said: 
"Do 
you 
allow 
your 
chum 
to 



talk 
to 
you 
like 
that? 
What 
is 
the 
chief 
point?" 
I 
was 
just 
going 
to 
say: 
"We 
can't 
tell 
you 
that," 
when 
Hella 
interrupted 
me 
and 
said: 
"Just 
because 
I'm 
her 
chum 
I 
can 
talk 
to 
her 
like 
that; 
she 
would 
not 
let 
anyone 
else 
do 
it." 
Then 
we 
went 
to 
dinner. 
Unfortunately 
we 
did 
not 
sit 
next 
"her." 
We 
had 
veal 
cutlets 
and 
four 
pieces 
of 
chocolate 
cake, 
and 
as 
the 
Herr 
Religionsprof. 
went 
by 
he 
said: 
"How 
many 
weeks 
have 
you 
been 
fasting?" 
Before 
dinner 
we 
went 
to 
the 
museum 
to 
see 
the 
things 
they 
had 
dug 
up 
in 
the 
Roman 
camp. 
The 
head 
mistress 
and 
Fraulein 
V. 
explained 
everything. 
It 
was 
most 
instructive. 
In 
the 
afternoon 
we 
went 
to 
Deutsch-Altenburg. 
It 
was 
great 
fun 
at 
tea. 
Then 
we 
had 
games 
and 
all 
the 
staff 
joined 
in, 
the 
Fifth 
had 
got 
up 
a 
comedy 
by 
one 
of 
the 
girls. 
We 
were 
all 
in 
fits 
of 
laughter. 
Then 
suddenly 
there 
came 
along 
a 
whole 
troop 
of 
officers 
of 
the 
flying 
corps, 
frightfully 
smart, 
and 
one 
of 
them 
sat 
down 
at 
the 
piano 
and 
began 
to 
play 
dance 
music. 
Another 
came 
up 
to 
the 
head 
and 
begged 
her 
to 
allow 
the 
"young 
ladies" 
to 
dance. 
The 
head 
did 
not 
want 
to 
at 
first, 
but 
all 
the 
girls 
of 
the 
Fifth 
and 
Sixth 
begged 
her 
to, 
and 
the 
Herr 
Rel. 
Prof. 
said: 
"Oh, 
Frau 
Direktorin, 
let 
them 
have 
the 
innocent 
pleasure," 
and 
so 
they 
really 
were 
allowed 
to 
dance. 
The 
rest 
of 
us 
either 
danced 
with 
one 
another 
or 
looked 
on. 
And 
then, 
when 
Hella 
and 
I 
were 
standing 
right 
in 
front, 
up 
came 
a 
splendid 
lieutenant 
and 
said: 
"May 
I 
venture 
to 
separate 
the 
two 
friends 
for 
a 
little 
dance?" 
"If 
you 
please," 
said 
I, 
and 
sailed 
off 
with 
him. 
To 
dance 
with 
a 
lieutenant 
is 
glorious. 
Then 
the 
same 
lieutenant 
danced 
with 
Hella 
and 
in 
the 
evening 
on 
the 
way 
home 
she 
said 
that 
the 
lieutenant 
had 
really 
wanted 
to 
dance 
with 
her 
first, 
but 
I 
had 
been 
so 
prompt 
with 
my 
"If 
you 
please" 
and 
had 
placed 
my 
hand 
on 
his 
shoulder. 
Of 
course 
that's 
not 
true, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
a 
thing 
one 
would 
quarrel 
about 
with 
one's 
best 
friend, 
and 
anyhow 
he 
danced 
with 
both 
of 
us. 
Unfortunately 
we 
were 
not 
able 
to 
dance 
very 
long 
because 
we 
got 
so 
hot. 
Oh, 
and 
I 
had 
almost 
forgotten, 
a 
captain 
with 
a 
black 
moustache 
saluted 
Frau 
Doktor 
M., 
for 
they 
know 
one 
another. 
She 
blushed 
furiously; 
so 
he 
is 
probably 
the 
man 
she 
will 
marry, 
and 
not 
Herr 
Prof. 
Wilke 
and 
not 
the 
Jewish 
professor. 
He 
would 
please 
me 
a 
great 
deal 
better. 
They 
were 
all 
so 
awfully 
smart! 
Before 
we 
left 
a 
lieutenant 
brought 
in 
a 
huge 
bunch 
of 
roses, 
and 
the 
officers 
gave 
a 
rose 
to 
each 
member 
of 
the 
staff, 
the 
ladies 
I 
mean. 
Then 
something 
awfully 
funny 
happened. 
There 
is 
a 
girl 
in 
the 
Sixth 
who 
looks 
quite 
old, 
as 
if 
she 
might 
be 
24, 
and 
"our" 
lieutenant 
offered 
her 
a 
rose 
too. 
And 
then 
she 
said: 
"No 
thank 
you, 
I 
am 
not 
one 
of 
the 
staff, 
I'm 
in 
the 
Sixth." 
Everyone 
burst 
out 
laughing, 
and 
she 
was 
quite 
abashed 
because 
the 
lieutenant 
had 
taken 
her 
for 
one 
of 
the 



staff. 
And 
the 
Herr 
Rel. 
Prof. 
said 
to 
her: 
"Tschapperl, 
you 
might 
just 
as 
well 
have 
taken 
it." 
But 
really 
she 
was 
quite 
right 
to 
refuse. 
I 
think 
there 
must 
have 
been 
20 
officers 
at 
least. 
Of 
course 
Hella 
told 
the 
lieutenant 
that 
she 
was 
a 
colonel's 
daughter. 
I 
wonder 
if 
we 
shall 
ever 
see 
him 
again. 


I 
am 
writing 
this 
four 
days 
after 
the 
outing. 
Dora 
told 
me 
yesterday 
that 
when 
I 
was 
dancing 
with 
the 
lieutenant 
the 
Herr 
Rel. 
Prof. 
said 
to 
the 
Frau 
Direktorin: 
"Do 
just 
look 
at 
that 
young 
Lainer; 
little 
rogue, 
see 
what 
eyes 
she's 
making." 
Making 
eyes, 
forsooth! 
I 
did 
not 
make 
eyes, 
besides, 
what 
does 
it 
mean 
anyhow 
to 
make 
eyes!! 
Of 
course 
I 
did 
not 
shut 
my 
eyes; 
if 
I 
had 
I 
should 
probably 
have 
fallen 
down, 
and 
then 
everyone 
would 
have 
laughed. 
And 
I 
don't 
like 
being 
laughed 
at. 
I 
hardly 
saw 
Dora 
all 
through 
the 
outing, 
and 
she 
did 
not 
dance. 
She 
said 
very 
cuttingly: 
"Of 
course 
not, 
for 
after 
all 
we 
are 
in 
mourning, 
even 
if 
we 
did 
wear 
white 
dresses; 
you 
are 
only 
a 
child, 
for 
whom 
that 
sort 
of 
thing 
does 
not 
matter." 
That 
sort 
of 
thing, 
as 
if 
I 
had 
done 
something 
dreadful! 
I 
don't 
love 
Mother 
any 
the 
less, 
and 
I 
don't 
forget 
her. 
Father 
was 
quite 
different; 
the 
day 
before 
yesterday 
evening 
he 
said: 
"So 
my 
little 
witch 
has 
made 
a 
conquest; 
you're 
beginning 
early. 
But 
it's 
no 
good 
taking 
up 
with 
an 
officer, 
little 
witch, 
they're 
too 
expensive." 
But 
I 
would 
like 
to 
have 
the 
lieutenant, 
I 
would 
go 
up 
with 
him 
in 
an 
aeroplane, 
up, 
up, 
till 
we 
both 
got 
quite 
giddy. 
In 
the 
religion 
lesson 
yesterday, 
when 
the 
Herr 
Prof. 
came 
in 
he 
laughed 
like 
anything 
and 
said: 
"Hullo, 
Lainer, 
is 
the 
world 
still 
spinning 
round 
you? 
The 
Herr 
Leutnant 
has 
not 
been 
able 
to 
sleep 
since." 
So 
I 
suppose 
he 
knows 
him. 
Still, 
I'm 
quite 
sure 
that 
he 
has 
not 
lost 
his 
sleep 
on 
my 
account, 
though 
very 
likely 
he 
said 
so. 
If 
I 
only 
knew 
what 
his 
name 
is, 
perhaps 
Leo 
or 
Romeo; 
yes, 
Romeo, 
that 
would 
suit 
him 
admirably! 


June 
26th. 
When 
I 
was 
writing 
hard 
yesterday 
Aunt 
Alma 
came 
with 
Marina 
and 
that 
jackanapes 
Erwin 
who 
was 
really 
responsible 
for 
all 
the 
row 
that 
time. 
Since 
Mother 
died 
we 
have 
been 
meeting 
again. 
I 
don't 
think 
Mother 
liked 
Aunt 
Alma 
much, 
nor 
she 
her. 
Just 
as 
Father 
and 
Aunt 
Dora 
are 
not 
particularly 
fond 
of 
one 
another. 
It 
is 
so 
in 
most 
families, 
the 
father 
does 
not 
care 
much 
for 
the 
mother's 
brothers 
and 
sisters 
and 
vice 
versa. 
I 
wonder 
why? 
I 
wonder 
whether 
He 
has 
a 
fiancee, 
probably 
he 
has, 
and 
what 
she 
looks 
like. 
I 
wish 
I 
knew 
whether 
He 
likes 
brown 
hair 
or 
fair 
hair 
or 
black 
hair 
best. 
But 
about 
the 
visit! 
Of 
course 
Marina 
and 
I 
were 
very 
standoffish. 
She 
is 
so 



frightfully 
conceited 
because 
she 
goes 
to 
the 
Training 
College. 
As 
if 
that 
were 
something 
magnificent! 
The 
High 
School 
is 
much 
more 
important, 
for 
from 
the 
High 
School 
one 
goes 
on 
to 
the 
university, 
but 
not 
from 
the 
Training 
College; 
and 
they 
don't 
learn 
English, 
nor 
French 
properly, 
for 
it 
is 
only 
optional. 
Aunt 
Alma 
knows 
that 
it 
annoys 
Father 
when 
anyone 
says 
we 
don't 
look 
well, 
so 
she 
said: 
"Why, 
Dora 
looks 
quite 
overworked; 
thank 
goodness 
it's 
nearly 
over, 
and 
she 
won't 
get 
much 
out 
of 
it 
after 
all, 
it's 
really 
better 
for 
a 
girl 
to 
become 
a 
teacher." 
Erwin 
lounged 
in 
his 
chair 
and 
said 
to 
me: 
"Do 
you 
dare 
me 
to 
spit 
on 
the 
carpet?" 
"You 
are 
ill-bred 
enough 
to 
do 
it; 
I 
can't 
think 
why 
Marina, 
the 
future 
schoolmistress, 
does 
not 
give 
you 
a 
good 
smacking," 
said 
I. 
Then 
Aunt 
Alma 
chimed 
in: 
"What's 
the 
matter 
children? 
What 
game 
are 
you 
playing?" 
"It's 
not 
a 
game 
at 
all; 
Erwin 
wants 
to 
spit 
on 
the 
carpet 
and 
he 
seems 
to 
think 
that 
would 
be 
all 
right." 
Then 
Aunt 
said 
something 
to 
him 
in 
Italian, 
and 
he 
pulled 
a 
long 
nose 
at 
me 
behind 
Father's 
back, 
but 
I 
simply 
ignored 
it; 
little 
pig, 
and 
yet 
he's 
my 
cousin! 
Kamillo 
is 
supposed 
to 
have 
been 
just 
as 
impudent 
as 
Bub. 
But 
we 
have 
never 
seen 
him, 
for 
he 
has 
been 
in 
Japan 
as 
an 
ensign 
for 
the 
last 
two 
years. 
Mourning 
does 
not 
suit 
Marina 
at 
all; 
there's 
a 
provincial 
look 
about 
her 
and 
she 
can't 
shake 
it 
off. 
Her 
clothes 
are 
too 
long 
and 
she 
has 
not 
got 
a 
trace 
of 
b--, 
although 
she 
was 
17 
last 
September; 
she 
is 
disgustingly 
thin. 


June 
27th. 
The 
Herr 
Insp. 
came 
to 
our 
class 
to-day, 
in 
French 
this 
time. 
Frau 
Doktor 
Dunker 
is 
always 
frightfully 
excited 
by 
his 
visits, 
and 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
lesson 
she 
said: 
"Girls, 
the 
Inspector 
is 
coming 
to-day; 
pull 
yourselves 
together; 
please 
don't 
leave 
me 
in 
the 
lurch." 
So 
it 
must 
be 
true 
what 
Oswald 
always 
says 
that 
the 
inspectors 
come 
to 
inspect 
the 
teachers 
and 
not 
the 
pupils. 
"At 
the 
inspection," 
Oswald 
often 
says, 
"every 
pupil 
has 
the 
professor 
in 
his 
hands." 
Being 
first, 
of 
course 
I 
was 
called 
upon, 
and 
I 
simply 
could 
not 
think 
what 
"trotteur" 
meant. 
I 
would 
not 
say 
"Trottel" 
[idiot], 
and 
so 
I 
said 
nothing 
at 
all. 
Then 
Anneliese 
turned 
round 
and 
whispered 
it 
to 
me, 
but 
of 
course 
I 
was 
not 
going 
to 
say 
it 
after 
her, 
but 
remained 
speechless 
as 
an 
owl. 
At 
length 
the 
Herr 
Inspektor 
said: 
"Translate 
the 
sentence 
right 
to 
the 
end, 
and 
then 
you'll 
grasp 
its 
meaning." 
But 
I 
can't 
see 
the 
sense 
of 
that; 
for 
if 
I 
don't 
know 
one 
of 
the 
words 
the 
sentence 
has 
no 
meaning, 
or 
at 
least 
not 
the 
meaning 
it 
ought 
to 
have. 
If 
Hella 
had 
not 
been 
absent 
to-day 
because 
of 
----, 
she 
might 
have 
been 
able 
to 
whisper 
it 
to 
me. 
Afterwards 
Frau 
Doktor 
Dunker 
reproached 
me, 
saying 
that 
no 
one 
could 
ever 
trust 
anyone, 
and 
that 
I 



really 
did 
not 
deserve 
a 
One. 
"And 
the 
stupidest 
thing 
of 
all 
was 
that 
you 
laughed 
when 
you 
did 
not 
know 
a 
simple 
word 
like 
that." 
Of 
course 
I 
could 
not 
tell 
her 
that 
my 
first 
thought 
had 
been 
to 
translate 
it 
"Trottel." 
Unseen 
translation 
is 
really 
too 
difficult 
for 
us. 


June 
28th. 
The 
Staff 
Meeting 
is 
to-day. 
I'm 
on 
tenter 
hooks 
to 
know 
whether 
I 
shall 
have 
a 
Reprimand, 
or 
a 
bad 
conduct 
mark 
in 
my 
report. 
That 
would 
be 
awful. 
It 
does 
not 
matter 
so 
much 
to 
Hella, 
for 
her 
father 
has 
just 
gone 
away 
to 
manoeuvres 
in 
Hungary 
or 
in 
Bosnia, 
and 
by 
the 
time 
he 
is 
back 
the 
holidays 
will 
have 
begun 
and 
no 
one 
will 
be 
bothering 
about 
reports 
any 
more. 
So 
I 
shall 
know 
to-morrow. 
Oh 
bother, 
to-morrow 
is 
a 
holiday 
and 
next 
day 
is 
Sunday. 
So 
for 
another 
2 
1/2 
days 
I 
shall 
have 
"to 
linger 
in 
suspense," 
but 
a 
different 
sort 
of 
suspense 
from 
what 
Goethe 
wrote 
about. 


June 
30th. 
We 
were 
at 
home 
yesterday 
and 
this 
afternoon 
because 
of 
Dora's 
matriculation. 
The 
Bruckners 
went 
to 
Breitenstein 
to 
visit 
an 
aunt, 
who 
is 
in 
a 
convalescent 
home, 
and 
so 
I 
could 
not 
go 
with 
them. 
In 
the 
evening 
we 
went 
to 
Turkenschanz 
Park 
to 
supper, 
but 
there 
was 
nothing 
on. 
By 
the 
way, 
I 
have 
not 
written 
anything 
yet 
about 
the 
"innocent 
child" 
at 
the 
outing. 
On 
the 
boat 
she 
began 
fussing 
round 
Hella 
and 
me 
and 
wanted 
to 
push 
into 
the 
conversation, 
indirectly 
of 
course! 
But 
she 
did 
not 
succeed; 
Hella 
is 
extraordinarily 
clever 
in 
such 
matters; 
she 
simply 
seemed 
to 
look 
through 
her 
Really 
I'm 
a 
little 
sorry 
for 
her, 
for 
she 
hasn't 
any 
close 
friends 
beyond 
ourselves; 
but 
Hella 
said: 
"Haven't 
you 
had 
enough 
of 
it 
yet? 
Do 
you 
want 
to 
be 
cooked 
once 
more 
with 
the 
same 
sauce?" 
And 
when 
Hella's 
hat 
fell 
into 
the 
water 
and 
we 
were 
still 
looking 
after 
it 
in 
fits 
of 
laughter, 
all 
of 
a 
sudden 
we 
found 
Anneliese 
standing 
behind 
us 
offering 
Hella 
a 
fine 
lace 
shawl 
which 
she 
had 
brought 
with 
her 
for 
the 
evening 
because 
she 
so 
readily 
gets 
earache. 
"Wouldn't 
you 
like 
to 
use 
this 
shawl, 
so 
that 
you 
won't 
have 
to 
go 
back 
to 
Vienna 
without 
a 
hat?" 
"Please 
don't 
trouble 
yourself, 
I'm 
quite 
used 
to 
going 
about 
bare-headed." 
But 
the 
way 
she 
said 
it, 
like 
a 
queen! 
I 
must 
learn 
it 
from 
her. 
She 
is 
really 
shorter 
than 
I 
am, 
but 
at 
such 
moments 
she 
looks 
just 
like 
a 
grown-up 
lady. 
I 
told 
her 
as 
much, 
and 
she 
rejoined: 
"Darling 
Rita, 
you 
can't 
learn 
a 
thing 
like 
that; 
it's 
inborn." 
She 
rather 
annoyed 
me, 
for 
she 
always 
seems 
to 
think 
that 
an 
officer's 
daughter 
is 
a 
thing 
apart. 



July 
1st. 
Thank 
goodness, 
everything 
has 
passed 
off 
without 
a 
public 
scandal. 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
spoke 
to 
me 
in 
the 
corridor, 
saying: 
"Lainer, 
you've 
had 
a 
narrow 
escape. 
If 
certain 
voices 
had 
not 
been 
raised 
on 
your 
behalf, 
I 
really 
don't 
know 
------." 
Then 
I 
said: 
"I'm 
quite 
certain, 
Frau 
Doktor, 
that 
you 
alone 
have 
saved 
me 
from 
a 
Bad 
Conduct 
Mark." 
And 
I 
kissed 
her 
hand. 
"Get 
along, 
you 
little 
baggage, 
for 
the 
one 
part 
simply 
a 
child, 
and 
for 
the 
other 
with 
your 
head 
full 
of 
thoughts 
which 
grown-ups 
would 
do 
well 
to 
dispense 
with." 


After 
all, 
one 
can't 
help 
one's 
thoughts, 
and 
we 
shall 
be 
more 
careful 
in 
future 
as 
to 
the 
persons 
to 
whom 
we 
talk 
about 
that 
sort 
of 
thing. 
Here's 
another 
thing 
I 
forgot 
to 
mention 
about 
the 
outing: 
When 
we 
got 
back 
into 
Vienna 
by 
rail, 
most 
of 
the 
parents 
came 
to 
meet 
us 
at 
the 
station; 
Father 
was 
there 
too, 
and 
so 
was 
the 
"innocent 
child's" 
mother. 
Thank 
goodness 
Father 
did 
not 
know 
her. 
When 
we 
got 
out 
of 
the 
train 
there 
was 
a 
great 
scrimmage, 
because 
we 
were 
all 
trying 
to 
sort 
ourselves 
to 
our 
parents, 
and 
suddenly 
I 
heard 
Hella's 
voice: 
"No, 
Madam, 
your 
child 
is 
not 
in 
our 
bad 
company." 
I 
turned 
round 
sharply, 
and 
there 
was 
Hella 
standing 
in 
front 
of 
Frau 
von 
Zerkwitz 
who 
had 
just 
asked 
her: 
"Hullo, 
you, 
what 
has 
become 
of 
my 
little 
Anneliese?" 
The 
answer 
was 
splendid; 
I 
should 
never 
have 
been 
able 
to 
hit 
upon 
it; 
I 
always 
think 
of 
good 
repartees 
after 
the 
event. 
It 
was 
just 
the 
same 
that 
time 
when 
the 
old 
gentleman 
in 
the 
theatre 
asked 
Hella 
if 
she 
was 
alone 
there, 
and 
she 
snapped 
at 
him. 
He 
said: 
Impudent 
as 
a 
Jewess, 
or 
an 
impudent 
Jewess! 
It 
was 
too 
absurd, 
for 
first 
of 
all 
it's 
not 
impudent 
to 
make 
a 
clever 
repartee, 
and 
secondly 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
because 
one 
can 
do 
it 
that 
one 
is 
a 
Jewess. 
So 
Hella 
finished 
up 
by 
saying 
to 
him: 
"No, 
you've 
made 
a 
mistake, 
you 
are 
not 
speaking 
to 
one 
of 
your 
own 
sort." 


We 
break 
up 
on 
the 
6th; 
but 
because 
of 
Dora's 
matriculation 
we 
are 
staying 
here 
until 
the 
11th. 
Then 
we 
are 
going 
to 
Fieberbrunn 
in 
Tyrol, 
and 
this 
year 
we 
shall 
stay 
in 
a 
hotel, 
so 
I 
am 
awfully 
pleased. 
Hella 
had 
a 
splendid 
time 
there 
last 
year 


July 
2nd. 
My 
goodness, 
to-day 
I 
have 
. 
. 
. 
., 
no, 
I 
can't 
write 
it 
plain 
out. 
In 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
Physics 
lesson, 
during 
revision, 
when 
I 
was 
not 
thinking 
of 
anything 
in 
particular, 
Fraulein 
N. 
came 
in 
with 
a 
paper 
to 
be 
signed. 
As 
we 
all 
stood 
up 
I 
thought 
to 
myself: 
Hullo, 
what's 
that? 
And 
then 
it 
suddenly 



occurred 
to 
me: 
Aha!! 
In 
the 
interval 
Hella 
asked 
me 
why 
I 
had 
got 
so 
fiery 
red 
in 
the 
Physics 
lesson, 
if 
I'd 
had 
some 
sweets 
with 
me. 
I 
did 
not 
want 
to 
tell 
her 
the 
real 
reason 
directly, 
and 
so 
I 
said: 
"Oh 
no, 
I 
had 
nearly 
fallen 
asleep 
from 
boredom, 
and 
when 
Fraulein 
N. 
came 
in 
it 
gave 
me 
a 
start." 
On 
the 
way 
home 
I 
was 
very 
silent, 
and 
I 
walked 
so 
slowly 
(for 
of 
course 
one 
must 
not 
walk 
fast 
when 
. 
. 
. 
) 
that 
Hella 
said: 
"Look 
here, 
what's 
up 
to-day, 
that 
you 
are 
so 
frightfully 
solemn? 
Have 
you 
fallen 
in 
love 
without 
my 
knowing 
it, 
or 
is 
it 
at 
long 
last 
. 
. 
. 
.?" 
Then 
I 
said 
"Or 
is 
it 
at 
long 
last!" 
And 
she 
said: 
"Ah, 
then 
now 
we're 
equals 
once 
more," 
and 
there 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
street 
she 
gave 
me 
a 
kiss. 
Just 
at 
that 
moment 
two 
students 
went 
by 
and 
one 
of 
them 
said: 
"Give 
me 
one 
too." 
And 
Hella 
said: 
"Yes, 
I'll 
give 
you 
one 
on 
the 
cheek 
which 
will 
burn." 
So 
they 
hurried 
away. 
We 
really 
had 
no 
use 
for 
them: 
to-day!! 
Hella 
wanted 
me 
to 
tell 
her 
everything 
about 
it; 
but 
really 
I 
hadn't 
anything 
to 
tell, 
and 
yet 
she 
believed 
that 
I 
wouldn't 
tell. 
It 
is 
really 
very 
unpleasant, 
and 
this 
evening 
I 
shall 
have 
to 
take 
frightful 
care 
because 
of 
Dora. 
But 
I 
must 
tell 
Aunt 
because 
I 
want 
a 
San--T--. 
It 
will 
be 
frightfully 
awkward. 
It 
was 
different 
in 
Hella's 
case, 
first 
of 
all 
because 
she 
had 
such 
frightful 
cramps 
before 
it 
began 
so 
that 
her 
mother 
knew 
all 
about 
it 
without 
being 
told, 
and 
secondly 
because 
it 
was 
her 
mother. 
I 
certainly 
shan't 
tell 
Dora 
whatever 
happens, 
for 
that 
would 
make 
me 
feel 
still 
more 
ashamed. 
As 
for 
a 
San--T--, 
I 
shall 
never 
be 
able 
to 
buy 
one 
for 
myself 
even 
if 
I 
live 
to 
be 


80. 
And 
it 
would 
be 
awful 
for 
Father 
to 
know 
about 
it. 
I 
wonder 
whether 
men 
really 
do 
know; 
I 
suppose 
they 
must 
know 
about 
their 
wives, 
but 
at 
any 
rate 
they 
can't 
know 
anything 
about 
their 
daughters. 
July 
3rd. 
Dora 
does 
know 
after 
all. 
For 
I 
switched 
off 
the 
light 
before 
I 
undressed, 
and 
then 
Dora 
snapped 
at 
me: 
"What 
on 
earth 
are 
you 
up 
to, 
switch 
it 
on 
again 
directly." 
"No 
I 
won't." 
Then 
she 
came 
over 
and 
wanted 
to 
switch 
it 
on 
herself; 
"Oh 
do 
please 
wait 
until 
I've 
got 
into 
bed." 
"O-o-h, 
is 
that 
it," 
said 
Dora, 
"why 
didn't 
you 
say 
so 
before? 
I've 
always 
hidden 
my 
things 
from 
you, 
and 
you 
haven't 
got 
any 
yet." 
And 
then 
we 
talked 
for 
quite 
a 
long 
time, 
and 
she 
told 
me 
that 
Mother 
had 
commissioned 
her 
to 
tell 
me 
everything 
when 
------Mother 
had 
told 
her 
all 
about 
it, 
but 
she 
said 
it 
was 
better 
for 
one 
girl 
to 
tell 
it 
to 
another, 
because 
that 
was 
least 
awkward. 
Mother 
knew 
too 
that 
in 
January 
Hella 
had 
. 
. 
. 
But 
how? 
I 
never 
let 
on! 
It 
was 
midnight 
before 
we 
switched 
off 
the 
light. 



July 
6th. 
Oh, 
I 
am 
so 
unhappy, 
when 
we 
went 
to 
get 
our 
reports 
to-day 
and 
said 
good-bye 
to 
Frau 
Doktor 
M., 
she 
was 
awfully 
sweet, 
and 
at 
the 
end 
she 
said: 
"I 
hope 
that 
you 
won't 
give 
too 
much 
trouble 
to 
my 
successor." 
At 
first 
we 
did 
not 
understand, 
for 
we 
thought 
she 
only 
meant 
that 
it 
is 
always 
uncertain 
whether 
the 
same 
member 
of 
the 
staff 
will 
keep 
the 
same 
class 
from 
year 
to 
year, 
but 
then 
she 
said: 
"I 
am 
leaving 
the 
school 
because 
I 
am 
going 
to 
be 
married." 
It 
gave 
me 
such 
a 
pang, 
and 
I 
said: 
"Oh, 
is 
it 
true?" 
"Yes, 
Lainer, 
it's 
quite 
true." 
And 
all 
the 
girls 
thronged 
round 
her 
and 
wanted 
to 
kiss 
her 
hand. 
No 
one 
spoke 
for 
a 
moment, 
and 
then 
Hella 
said: 
"Frau 
Doktor, 
may 
I 
ask 
you 
something? 
But 
you 
mustn't 
be 
angry!" 
"All 
right, 
ask 
away!" 
"Is 
it 
the 
captain 
we 
met 
in 
Carnuntum?" 
She 
was 
quite 
puzzled 
for 
a 
minute, 
and 
then 
she 
laughed 
like 
anything 
and 
said, 
"No, 
Bruckner, 
it 
is 
not 
he, 
for 
he 
has 
a 
wife 
already." 
And 
Gilly, 
who 
is 
not 
so 
frightfully 
fond 
of 
her 
as 
Hella 
and 
I 
are, 
said: 
"Frau 
Doktor, 
please 
tell 
us 
whom 
you 
are 
going 
to 
marry." 
"There's 
no 
secret 
about 
it, 
I 
am 
going 
to 
marry 
a 
professor 
in 
Heidelberg." 
That 
is 
why 
she 
has 
to 
leave 
the 
High 
School. 
It's 
simply 
ruined 
my 
holidays. 
Hella 
has 
such 
lovely 
ideas. 
The 
girls 
would 
not 
leave 
Frau 
Doktor 
alone, 
and 
they 
all 
wanted 
to 
walk 
home 
with 
her. 
Then 
she 
said: 
"My 
darling 
girls, 
that's 
impossible, 
for 
I 
am 
going 
to 
Purkersdorf 
to 
see 
my 
parents. 
And 
then 
Hella 
had 
her 
splendid 
idea. 
The 
others 
said: 
"Please 
may 
we 
come 
with 
you 
as 
far 
as 
the 
metropolitan?" 
and 
at 
length 
she 
said 
they 
might. 
But 
Hella 
said, 
"Come 
along," 
and 
we 
hurried 
off 
to 
the 
metropolitan 
before 
them 
and 
took 
tickets 
to 
Hutteldorf 
so 
that 
we 
should 
be 
able 
to 
get 
back 
in 
plenty 
of 
time, 
and 
there 
we 
were 
waiting 
on 
the 
platform 
when 
she 
came 
and 
when 
all 
the 
girls 
came 
with 
her 
as 
far 
as 
the 
entrance. 
Then 
we 
rushed 
up 
to 
her 
and 
got 
into 
the 
train 
which 
came 
in 
at 
that 
moment. 
Of 
course 
we 
had 
second 
class 
tickets, 
for 
Hella, 
being 
an 
officer's 
daughter, 
mayn't 
travel 
third, 
and 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
always 
travels 
second 
too. 
And 
we 
all 
three 
sat 
together 
on 
a 
seat 
for 
two, 
though 
it 
was 
frightfully 
hot. 
She 
was 
so 
nice 
to 
us; 
I 
begged 
her 
to 
give 
us 
her 
photograph 
and 
she 
promised 
to 
send 
us 
one. 
Then, 
alas, 
we 
got 
to 
Hutteldorf. 
"Now, 
girls, 
you 
must 
get 
out." 
Then 
we 
both 
burst 
out 
crying, 
and 
she 
kissed 
us! 
Never 
shall 
I 
forget 
that 
blessed 
moment 
and 
that 
heavenly 
ride! 
As 
long 
as 
the 
train 
was 
still 
in 
sight 
we 
both 
waved 
our 
handkerchiefs 
to 
her 
and 
she 
waved 
back! 
When 
we 
wanted 
to 
give 
up 
our 
tickets 
Hella 
looked 
everywhere 
for 
her 
purse 
and 
could 
not 
find 
it; 
she 
must 
have 
left 
it 
in 
the 
ticket 
office. 
Luckily 
I 
still 
had 
all 
my 
July 
pocket 
money 
and 
so 
I 
was 
able 
to 
pay 
the 
excess 
fare, 
and 
then 
for 
once 
in 
a 
way 
I 
was 
the 
sharp-witted 



one; 
I 
said 
we 
had 
travelled 
third 
and 
had 
only 
passed 
out 
through 
the 
second, 
so 
we 
had 
not 
to 
pay 
so 
much; 
and 
no 
one 
knew 
anything 
about 
it, 
there's 
no 
harm 
in 
that 
sort 
of 
cheating. 
Of 
course 
we 
really 
did 
go 
back 
third, 
although 
Hella 
said 
it 
would 
spoil 
the 
memory 
for 
her. 
That 
sort 
of 
thing 
does 
not 
matter 
to 
me. 
We 
did 
not 
get 
home 
until 
a 
quarter 
past 
1, 
and 
Aunt 
Dora 
gave 
me 
a 
tremendous 
scolding. 
I 
said 
I 
had 
been 
arranging 
books 
in 
the 
library 
for 
Frau 
Doktor, 
but 
Dora 
had 
enquired 
at 
the 
High 
School 
at 
12, 
and 
there 
had 
been 
no 
one 
there. 
We 
had 
already 
gone 
away 
then, 
I 
said, 
and 
had 
gone 
part 
of 
the 
way 
with 
Frau 
Doktor 
M., 
for 
she 
was 
leaving 
because 
of 
her 
marriage. 
Then 
Dora 
was 
quite 
astonished 
and 
said: 
"Ah, 
now 
I 
understand." 
The 
other 
day 
when 
she 
had 
to 
go 
into 
the 
room 
while 
the 
staff 
meeting 
was 
on, 
the 
staff 
was 
talking 
about 
an 
engagement, 
and 
Fraulein 
Thim 
was 
saying: 
"Not 
everyone 
has 
the 
luck 
to 
get 
a 
university 
professor." 
That 
must 
have 
been 
about 
her. 
Certainly 
Thim 
won't 
get 
one, 
not 
even 
a 
school 
porter. 
To-day, 
(I've 
been 
writing 
this 
up 
for 
two 
days), 
I 
had 
such 
a 
delightful 
surprise; 
she 
sent 
me 
her 
photo, 
simply 
heavenly!! 
Father 
says 
the 
portrait 
is 
better 
looking 
than 
the 
reality. 
Nothing 
of 
the 
sort, 
she 
is 
perfectly 
beautiful, 
with 
her 
lovely 
eyes 
and 
her 
spiritual 
expression! 
Of 
course 
she 
has 
sent 
Hella 
a 
photo 
too. 
We 
are 
going 
to 
have 
pocket 
leather 
cases 
made 
for 
the 
photographs, 
so 
that 
we 
can 
take 
them 
with 
us 
wherever 
we 
go. 
But 
we 
shall 
have 
to 
wait 
until 
after 
the 
holidays 
because 
Hella 
has 
lost 
her 
money, 
and 
nearly 
all 
mine 
was 
used 
up 
in 
paying 
the 
excess 
fares. 
And 
such 
a 
leather 
case 
will 
cost 
3 
crowns. 
Father 
has 
some 
untearable 
transparent 
envelopes, 
and 
I 
shall 
ask 
him 
for 
two 
of 
them. 
They 
will 
do 
as 
a 
makeshift. 


Dora's 
matriculation 
is 
to-morrow, 
she's 
quite 
nervous 
about 
it 
although 
she 
is 
very 
well 
up 
in 
all 
the 
subjects. 
But 
she 
says 
it's 
so 
easy 
to 
make 
mistakes. 
But 
Father 
is 
quite 
unconcerned, 
though 
last 
year 
he 
was 
very 
much 
bothered 
about 
Oswald, 
and 
poor 
dear 
Mother 
was 
frightfully 
anxious: 
"Pooh," 
said 
Oswald, 
"I 
shall 
soon 
show 
them 
that 
there's 
no 
need 
to 
bother; 
all 
one 
wants 
at 
the 
metric 
is 
cheek, 
that's 
the 
whole 
secret!" 
And 
then 
all 
he 
telegraphed 
was 
"durch" 
[through] 
and 
poor 
Mother 
was 
still 
very 
anxious, 
and 
thought 
that 
it 
might 
mean 
durchgefallen 
[failed]. 
But 
of 
course 
it 
really 
meant 
durchgekommen 
[passed], 
for 
meanwhile 
the 
second 
telegram 
had 
come. 
And 
father 
had 
brought 
two 
bottles 
of 
champagne 
to 
Rodaun, 
ready 
to 
celebrate 
Oswald's 
return. 
There 
won't 
be 
anything 
of 
the 
sort 
after 
Dora's 
matriculation 
because 
Mother 
is 
not 
with 
us 
any 
more; 
oh 
it 
does 
make 
me 
so 



miserable 
when 
I 
think 
that 
2 
<1/2 
months 
ago 
she 
was 
still 
alive, 
and 
now 
-----. 


July 
9th. 
This 
morning, 
while 
Dora 
was 
having 
her 
exam 
(she 
passed 
with 
Distinction), 
I 
went 
to 
the 
cemetery 
quite 
alone. 
I 
told 
Aunt 
Dora 
I 
was 
going 
shopping 
with 
Hella 
and 
her 
mother, 
and 
I 
told 
Hella 
I 
was 
going 
with 
Aunt, 
and 
so 
I 
took 
the 
tram 
to 
Potzleinsdorf 
and 
then 
walked 
to 
the 
cemetery. 
People 
always 
ought 
to 
go 
to 
the 
cemetery 
alone. 
There 
was 
no 
one 
in 
the 
place 
but 
me. 
I 
did 
not 
dare 
to 
stay 
long, 
for 
I 
was 
afraid 
I 
should 
be 
home 
late. 
It's 
a 
frightfully 
long 
way 
to 
Potzleinsdorf, 
and 
it 
always 
seems 
so 
much 
further 
when 
one 
is 
alone. 
And 
when 
I 
came 
away 
from 
the 
cemetery 
I 
took 
a 
wrong 
turning 
and 
found 
myself 
in 
a 
quite 
deserted 
street 
near 
the 
Turkenschanze. 
That 
sort 
of 
thing 
is 
very 
awkward, 
and 
for 
a 
long 
time 
there 
was 
simply 
no 
one 
of 
whom 
I 
could 
ask 
the 
way. 
Then 
by 
good 
luck 
an 
old 
lady 
came 
along, 
and 
she 
told 
me 
I 
had 
only 
to 
take 
the 
next 
turning 
to 
get 
back 
to 
the 
tram 
line. 
And 
just 
as 
I 
did 
get 
there 
a 
Potzleinsdorf 
car 
came 
along, 
so 
I 
got 
in 
and 
reached 
home 
long 
before 
Dora. 
But 
in 
the 
afternoon 
Hella 
nearly 
gave 
me 
away, 
quite 
unintentionally. 
But 
since 
they 
were 
all 
talking 
about 
the 
matriculation 
I 
was 
able 
to 
smooth 
it 
over. 
Now 
that 
Dora 
has 
finished 
her 
matriculation 
she 
will 
have 
to 
tell 
me 
a 
great 
deal 
more 
about 
certain 
things; 
she 
promised 
she 
would. 
Before 
the 
matriculation 
she 
was 
always 
so 
tired 
because 
of 
the 
frightful 
grind, 
but 
that 
is 
over 
now, 
and 
I 
never 
do 
any 
work 
in 
the 
holidays. 
What 
are 
holidays 
for? 
Frau 
Doktor 
Dunker 
has 
really 
given 
me 
only 
a 
Satisfactory, 
it's 
awfully 
mean 
of 
her; 
and 
I 
shall 
have 
to 
learn 
from 
her 
for 
three 
years 
more! 
Nothing 
will 
induce 
me 
to 
bother 
myself 
about 
French 
now, 
for 
she 
has 
a 
down 
on 
me, 
and 
when 
one's 
teacher 
has 
a 
down 
on 
one, 
one 
can 
work 
as 
hard 
as 
one 
likes 
and 
it's 
no 
good. 
It 
was 
so 
different 
with 
Frau 
Doktor 
M.!! 
I 
have 
just 
been 
looking 
at 
her 
photo 
so 
long 
that 
my 
eyes 
are 
positively 
burning; 
but 
I 
had 
to 
write 
up 
about 
to-day: 
even 
when 
one 
had 
been 
stupid 
once 
or 
twice, 
she 
never 
cast 
it 
up 
against 
one, 
never, 
never, 
never 
----the 
sweet 
angel! 


July 
10th. 
We 
are 
going 
to 
F. 
to-morrow; 
I 
am 
so 
glad. 
It 
is 
frightfully 
dull 
today, 
for 
Hella 
went 
away 
yesterday 
to 
Berchtesgaden 
where 
she 
is 
to 
stay 
for 
6 
weeks, 
and 
on 
the 
way 
back 
she 
is 
going 
to 
Salzburg 
and 
perhaps 
Aunt 
Dora 
will 
take 
me 
to 
Salzburg 
for 
2 
days 
so 
that 
we 
can 
see 
one 
another 
again 
before 
Hella 
goes 
to 
Hungary. 
She 
is 
lucky! 
I 
can't 
go 
to 
K--M--this 
year, 



for 
we 
are 
going 
to 
stay 
in 
F. 
till 
the 
middle 
of 
September. 
I 
got 
my 
name 
day 
presents 
to-day 
because 
they 
are 
things 
for 
the 
journey: 
a 
black 
travelling 
satchel 
with 
a 
black 
leather 
belt, 
and 
half 
a 
dozen 
mourning 
handkerchiefs 
with 
a 
narrow 
black 
border, 
and 
an 
outfit 
for 
pokerwork, 
and 
a 
huge 
bag 
of 
sweets 
for 
the 
journey 
from 
Hella. 
The 
world 
is 
a 
wretched 
place 
without 
Hella. 
I 
do 
hope 
we 
shall 
marry 
on 
the 
same 
day, 
for 
Mother 
always 
used 
to 
say: 
"The 
most 
ardent 
girl 
friendships 
are 
always 
broken 
up 
when 
one 
of 
the 
two 
marries." 
I 
suppose 
because 
the 
other 
one 
is 
annoyed 
because 
she 
has 
not 
married. 
I 
wonder 
what 
it 
will 
be 
like 
at 
Frau 
Doktor 
M.'s 
wedding! 
and 
I 
wonder 
whether 
she 
knows 
about 
everything; 
very 
likely 
not, 
but 
if 
not 
I 
suppose 
her 
mother 
will 
tell 
her 
all 
about 
it 
before 
she 
is 
married. 
Dora 
told 
me 
yesterday 
that 
Mother 
had 
once 
said 
to 
her: 
"A 
girl 
always 
gets 
all 
sorts 
of 
false 
ideas 
into 
her 
head; 
the 
reality 
is 
quite 
different." 
But 
that 
is 
not 
so 
in 
our 
case, 
for 
we 
really 
know 
everything 
quite 
precisely, 
even 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
you 
have 
to 
take 
off 
every 
stitch; 
oh 
dear, 
I 
shall 
never 
forget 
it!--Oswald 
is 
coming 
to 
F. 
on 
the 
20th, 
for 
first 
he 
is 
going 
to 
Munich 
for 
a 
few 
days. 


July 
12th. 
It's 
lovely 
here; 
mountains 
and 
mountains 
all 
round, 
and 
we're 
going 
to 
climb 
them 
all; 
oh, 
how 
I 
am 
enjoying 
myself! 
I 
simply 
can't 
keep 
a 
diary; 
it 
will 
have 
to 
be 
a 
weekary. 
For 
I 
must 
write 
to 
Hella 
at 
least 
every 
other 
day. 
We 
are 
staying 
in 
the 
Edelweiss 
boarding 
house; 
there 
are 
about 
40 
visitors, 
at 
least 
that's 
what 
we 
counted 
at 
dinner. 
There 
is 
a 
visitors' 
list 
hanging 
up 
in 
the 
hall, 
and 
I 
must 
study 
it 
thoroughly. 
The 
journey 
was 
rather 
dull, 
for 
Dora 
had 
a 
frightful 
headache 
so 
we 
could 
not 
talk 
all 
through 
the 
night. 
I 
stood 
in 
the 
corridor 
half 
the 
night. 
At 
one 
place 
in 
Salzburg 
there 
was 
a 
frightful 
fire; 
no 
one 
was 
putting 
it 
out, 
so 
I 
suppose 
no 
one 
knew 
anything 
about 
it. 
The 
boarding 
house 
is 
beautifully 
furnished, 
carpets 
everywhere; 
there 
are 
several 
groups 
of 
statuary 
in 
the 
hall. 
We 
are 
awfully 
pleased 
with 
everything. 
There 
are 
4 
courses 
at 
dinner 
and 
two 
at 
supper. 
Flowers 
on 
every 
table. 
Father 
says 
we 
must 
wait 
and 
see 
whether 
they 
change 
them 
often 
enough. 
Father 
has 
a 
new 
tweed 
suit 
which 
becomes 
him 
splendidly 
for 
he 
is 
so 
tall 
and 
aristocratic 
looking. 
We 
have 
coats 
and 
skirts 
made 
of 
thin 
black 
cotton 
material 
and 
black 
lace 
blouses, 
and 
we 
also 
have 
white 
coats 
and 
skirts 
and 
white 
blouses, 
and 
light 
grey 
tweed 
dresses 
as 
well. 
For 
Father 
is 
really 
quite 
right: 
"Mourning 
is 
in 
your 
heart, 
not 
in 
your 
dress." 
Still, 
for 
the 
present, 
we 
shall 
wear 
black, 
but 
we 
have 
the 
white 
things 
in 
case 
it 
gets 
frightfully 
hot. 
To-day, 
on 
a 
cliff 
quite 
near 
the 
house, 



we 
picked 
a 
great 
nosegay 
of 
Alpine 
roses. 
Dora 
has 
brought 
Mother's 
photo 
with 
her 
and 
has 
put 
the 
flowers 
in 
front 
of 
it; 
unluckily 
I 
forgot 
to 
bring 
mine. 
I 
should 
like 
to 
go 
to 
the 
top 
of 
the 
Wildeck 
or 
one 
of 
the 
other 
mountains. 
It 
would 
be 
lovely 
to 
pick 
Edelweiss 
for 
oneself. 
But 
Father 
says 
that 
mountaineering 
is 
not 
suited 
to 
our 
ages. 
The 
baths 
here 
always 
seem 
very 
cold, 
only 
about 
54 
or 
60 
degrees 
at 
most. 
Dr. 
Klein 
said 
we 
should 
only 
bathe 
when 
the 
water 
is 
quite 
warm. 
But 
apparently 
that 
won't 
be 
often. 
We 
have 
not 
made 
any 
acquaintances 
yet, 
but 
I 
like 
the 
look 
of 
the 
two 
girls 
wearing 
Bosnian 
blouses 
at 
the 
second 
table 
from 
ours. 
Perhaps 
we 
shall 
get 
to 
know 
them. 
One 
plan 
,has 
come 
to 
nothing. 
I 
wanted 
to 
talk 
to 
Dora 
in 
the 
evenings 
about 
all 
sorts 
of 
important 
things, 
but 
it 
is 
impossible 
because 
Aunt 
Dora 
shares 
our 
room. 
Here's 
another 
tiresome 
thing; 
Father's 
room 
has 
a 
lovely 
veranda 
looking 
on 
to 
the 
promenade, 
while 
our 
room 
only 
looks 
into 
the 
garden. 
Of 
course 
the 
view 
is 
lovely, 
but 
I 
should 
have 
liked 
Father's 
room 
much 
better, 
only 
it 
is 
a 
great 
deal 
too 
small 
for 
three 
persons; 
there 
is 
only 
one 
bed 
and 
its 
furniture 
is 
of 
a 
very 
ancient 
order. 
I 
do 
hate 
that 
sort 
of 
furniture; 
the 
lady 
who 
keeps 
the 
boarding 
house 
calls 
it 
Empire!! 
I 
don't 
suppose 
she 
can 
ever 
have 
seen 
a 
room 
furnished 
in 
real 
Empire 
style. 


July 
15th. 
When 
Dora 
and 
I 
were 
out 
for 
a 
walk 
yesterday 
she 
told 
me 
a 
great 
deal 
about 
Aunt 
Dora. 
I 
never 
really 
knew 
before 
whether 
Uncle 
Richard 
was 
employed 
in 
the 
asylum 
or 
whether 
he 
was 
a 
patient 
there; 
but 
he 
is 
a 
patient. 
He 
has 
spinal 
disease 
and 
is 
quite 
off 
his 
head 
and 
often 
has 
attacks 
of 
raving 
madness. 
Once 
before 
he 
was 
sent 
to 
the 
asylum 
he 
tried 
to 
throttle 
Aunt 
Dora, 
and 
in 
another 
respect 
he 
did 
her 
a 
frightful 
lot 
of 
harm!!! 
I 
don't 
quite 
understand 
how, 
for 
Aunt 
Dora 
has 
never 
had 
any 
children. 
And 
why 
on 
earth 
do 
they 
make 
such 
a 
secret 
about 
Uncle 
Richard? 
But 
when 
I 
come 
to 
think 
of 
it, 
no 
one 
ever 
wanted 
to 
talk 
about 
Mother's 
illness. 
There's 
no 
sense 
in 
this 
secrecy, 
for 
in 
the 
first 
place 
that 
always 
makes 
one 
think 
about 
things, 
and 
secondly 
one 
always 
finds 
out 
in 
the 
long 
run. 
At 
last 
Aunt 
Dora 
was 
so 
terribly 
afraid 
of 
Uncle 
that 
she 
always 
kept 
the 
door 
of 
her 
bedroom 
locked. 
It 
must 
be 
awful 
to 
have 
a 
husband 
who 
is 
a 
raging 
maniac. 
Father 
once 
said 
to 
Dora: 
your 
Aunt 
Dora 
is 
enough 
to 
drive 
one 
mad 
with 
her 
whims 
and 
fancies. 
Of 
course 
he 
didn't 
mean 
that 
literally, 
but 
I 
must 
watch 
carefully 
to 
find 
out 
what 
Aunt 
really 
does 
to 
annoy 
anyone 
so 
much. 
Most 
likely 
it 
is 
something 
connected 
with 
this 
matter. 
To 
my 
mind 
Aunt 
Alma 
has 
many 
more 
whims 
and 
fancies, 
and 
yet 
Uncle 
Franz 
has 
never 
gone 
raving 
mad. 



Dora 
says 
that 
Uncle 
Richard 
may 
go 
on 
she 
is 
frightfully 
sorry 
for 
Aunt 
Dora 
be 
Why 
tied? 
After 
all, 
he 
is 
in 
an 
asylum 
a 
know 
about 
all 
this 
before, 
Aunt 
only 
tol 
thinks 
it 
is 
better 
not 
to 
marry 
at 
all, 
unle 
And 
then 
only 
by 
a 
marriage 
contract!! 
But 
I 
always 
imagined 
a 
marriage 
contra 
money 
affairs 
generally; 
and 
never 
thoug 
Mayer, 
whom 
we 
met 
in 
the 
summer 
hol 
under 
such 
conditions. 
But 
it 
puzzles 
me 
when 
they 
marry, 
I 
don't 
see 
how 
any 
m 
contract. 
There 
must 
be 
a 
mistake 
somew

Jews, 
for 
the 
Mayers 
were 
Jews.

in 
that 
matter.

LAST

AGE 
FOURTEEN 
AND 
A 
HALF 


LAST 
HALF-YEAR 


July 
30th. 
Thank 
goodness 
this 
is 
my 
14th!!! 
birthday; 
Olga 
thought 
that 
I 
was 
16 
or 
at 
least 
15; 
but 
I 
said: 
No 
thank 
you; 
to 
look 
like 
16 
is 
quite 
agreeable 
to 
me, 
but 
I 
should 
not 
like 
to 
be 
16, 
for 
after 
all 
how 
long 
is 
one 
young, 
only 
2 
or 
3 
years 
at 
most. 
But 
as 
to 
feeling 
different, 
as 
Hella 
said 
she 
did, 
I 
really 
can't 
notice 
anything 
of 
the 
kind; 
I 
am 
merely 
delighted 
that 
no 
one, 
not 
even 
Dora, 
can 
now 
call 
me 
a 
child. 
I 
do 
detest 
the 
word 
"child," 
except 
when 
Mother 
used 
to 
say: 
"My 
darling 
child," 
but 
then 
it 
meant 
something 
quite 
different. 
I 
like 
Mother's 
ring 
best 
of 
all 
my 
birthday 
presents; 
I 
shall 
wear 
it 
for 
always 
and 
always. 
When 
I 
was 
going 
to 
cry, 
Father 
said 
so 
sweetly: 
"Don't 
cry, 
Gretel, 
you 
must 
not 
cry 
on 
your 
14th!! 
birthday, 
that 
would 
be 
a 
fine 
beginning 
of 
grown-upness! 
Besides 
the 
ring, 
Father 
gave 
me 
a 
lovely 
black 
pearl 
necklace 
which 
suits 
me 
perfectly, 
and 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
so 
cool; 
then 
Theodor 
Storm's 
Immensee, 
from 
Aunt 
Dora 
the 
black 
openwork 
stockings 
and 
long 
black 
silk 
gloves, 
and 
from 
Dora 
a 
dark 
grey 
leather 
wristband 
for 
my 
watch. 
But 
I 
shan't 
wear 
that 
until 
we 
are 
back 
in 
Vienna 
and 
I 
am 
going 
to 
school 
again. 
Grandfather 
and 
Grandmother 
sent 
fruit 
as 
usual, 
but 
nothing 
has 
come 
from 
Oswald. 
He 
can't 
possibly 
have 
forgotten. 
I 
suppose 
his 
present 
will 
come 
later. 
Father 
also 
gave 
me 
a 
box 
of 
delicious 
sweets. 
At 
dinner 
Aunt 
Dora 
had 
ordered 
my 
favourite 
chocolate 
cream 
cake, 
and 
every 
one 
said: 
Hullo, 
why 
have 
we 
got 
a 
Sunday 
dish 
on 
a 
weekday? 
And 
then 
it 
came 
out 
that 
it 
was 
my 
birthday, 
and 
the 
Weiner 
girls, 
who 
knew 
it 
already, 
told 
most 
of 
the 
other 
guests 
and 
nearly 
everyone 
came 
to 
wish 
me 
many 
happy 
returns. 
Olga 
and 
Nelly 
had 
done 
so 
in 
the 
morning, 
and 
had 
given 
me 
a 
huge 
nosegay 
of 
wild 
flowers 
and 
another 
of 
cut 
flowers. 
This 
afternoon 
we 
are 
all 
going 
to 
Flagg; 
it 
is 
lovely 
there. 


Evening: 
I 
must 
write 
some 
more. 
We 
could 
not 
have 
the 
expedition, 
because 
there 
was 
a 
frightful 
thunderstorm 
from 
2 
to 
4 
o'clock. 
But 
we 
enjoyed 



ourselves 
immensely. 
And 
I 
had 
another 
adventure: 
As 
I 
was 
leaving 
the 
dining-room 
in 
order 
to 
go 
to 
the 
. 
. 
. 
., 
I 
heard 
a 
voice 
say: 
May 
I 
wish 
you 
a 
happy 
birthday, 
Fraulein? 
I 
turned 
round, 
and 
there 
behind 
me 
stood 
the 
enormously 
tall 
fair-haired 
student, 
whom 
I 
have 
been 
noticing 
for 
the 
last 
three 
days. 
"Thank 
you 
very 
much, 
it's 
awfully 
kind 
of 
you," 
said 
I, 
and 
wanted 
to 
pass 
on, 
for 
I 
really 
had 
to 
go. 
But 
he 
began 
speaking 
again, 
and 
said: 
"I 
suppose 
that's 
only 
a 
joke 
about 
your 
being 
14. 
Surely 
you 
are 
16 
today?" 
"I 
am 
both 
glad 
and 
sorry 
to 
say 
that 
I 
am 
not, 
said 
I, 
but 
after 
all 
everyone 
is 
as 
old 
as 
he 
seems. 
Please 
excuse 
me, 
I 
really 
must 
go 
to 
my 
room," 
said 
I 
hurriedly, 
and 
bolted, 
for 
otherwise 
--------!! 
I 
hope 
he 
did 
not 
suspect 
the 
truth. 
I 
must 
write 
about 
it 
to 
Hella, 
it 
will 
make 
her 
laugh. 
She 
sent 
me 
a 
lovely 
little 
jewel 
box 
with 
a 
view 
of 
Berchtesgaden 
packed 
with 
my 
favourite 
sweets, 
filled 
with 
brandy. 
In 
her 
letter 
she 
complains 
of 
the 
"shortness 
of 
my 
last 
letter." 
I 
must 
write 
her 
a 
long 
letter 
to-morrow. 
At 
supper 
I 
noticed 
for 
the 
first 
time 
where 
"Balder" 
sits; 
that's 
what 
I 
call 
him 
because 
of 
his 
lovely 
golden 
hair, 
and 
because 
I 
don't 
know 
his 
real 
name. 
He 
is 
with 
an 
old 
gentleman 
and 
an 
old 
lady 
and 
a 
younger 
lady 
whose 
hair 
is 
like 
his, 
but 
she 
can't 
possibly 
be 
his 
sister 
for 
she 
is 
much 
too 
old. 


July 
31st. 
The 
family 
is 
called 
Scharrer 
von 
Arneck, 
and 
the 
father 
is 
a 
retired 
member 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Mines. 
The 
young 
lady 
is 
really 
his 
sister, 
and 
she 
is 
a 
teacher 
at 
the 
middle 
school 
in 
Brunn. 
I 
found 
all 
this 
out 
from 
the 
housemaid. 
But 
I 
went 
about 
it 
in 
a 
very 
cunning 
way, 
I 
did 
not 
want 
to 
ask 
straight 
out, 
and 
so 
I 
said: 
Can 
you 
tell 
me 
who 
that 
white-haired 
old 
gentleman 
is, 
he 
is 
so 
awfully 
like 
my 
Grandfather. 
(I 
have 
never 
see 
my 
Grandfather, 
for 
Father's 
Father 
has 
been 
dead 
12 
or 
15 
years, 
and 
Mother's 
Father 
does 
not 
live 
in 
Vienna 
but 
in 
Berlin.) 
Then 
Luise 
answered: 
"Ah, 
Fraulein, 
I 
expect 
you 
mean 
Herr 
Oberbergrat 
Sch., 
von 
Sch. 
But 
I 
expect 
Fraulein's 
Grandfather 
is 
not 
quite 
so 
grumpy." 
I 
said: 
"Is 
he 
so 
frightfully 
grumpy 
then?" 
And 
she 
answered: 
"I 
should 
think 
so; 
we 
must 
all 
jump 
at 
the 
word 
go 
or 
it's 
all 
up 
with 
us!" 
And 
then 
one 
word 
led 
to 
another, 
and 
she 
told 
me 
all 
she 
knew; 
the 
daughter 
is 
32 
already, 
her 
name 
is 
Hulda 
and 
her 
father 
won't 
let 
her 
marry, 
and 
the 
young 
gentleman 
has 
left 
home 
because 
his 
father 
pestered 
him 
so. 
He 
is 
a 
student 
in 
Prague, 
and 
only 
comes 
home 
for 
the 
holidays. 
It 
all 
sounds 
very 
melancholy, 
and 
yet 
they 
look 
perfectly 
happy 
except 
the 
daughter. 
By 
the 
way, 
it's 
horrid 
for 
the 
Weiners; 
Olga 
is 
13 
and 
Nelly 
actually 
15, 
and 
their 
mother 
is 
once 
more 
--------I 
mean 
their 
mother 



is 
in 
an 
i--c--. 
They 
are 
both 
in 
a 
frightful 
rage, 
and 
Nelly 
said 
to 
me 
to-day: 
"It's 
a 
perfect 
scandal;" 
they 
find 
it 
so 
awkward 
going 
about 
with 
their 
mother. 
I 
can't 
say 
I'd 
noticed 
anything 
myself; 
but 
they 
say 
it 
has 
really 
been 
obvious 
for 
a 
long 
time; 
"the 
happy 
event!! 
will 
take 
place 
in 
October," 
said 
Olga. 
It 
really 
must 
be 
very 
disagreeable, 
and 
I 
took 
a 
dislike 
to 
Frau 
W. 
from 
the 
first. 
I 
simply 
can't 
understand 
how 
such 
a 
thing 
can 
happen 
when 
people 
are 
so 
old. 
I'm 
awfully 
sorry 
for 
the 
two 
Weiner 
girls. 
Something 
of 
the 
same 
sort 
must 
have 
happened 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
Schs., 
for 
Luise 
has 
told 
me 
that 
the 
young 
gentleman 
is 
21 
and 
his 
sister 
not 
32 
but 
35, 
she 
had 
made 
a 
mistake; 
so 
she 
is 
14 
years 
older, 
appalling. 
I'm 
awfully 
sorry 
for 
her 
because 
her 
father 
won't 
let 
her 
marry, 
or 
rather 
would 
not 
let 
her 
marry. 
I'm 
sure 
Father 
would 
never 
refuse 
if 
either 
of 
us 
wanted 
to 
marry. 
I 
have 
written 
all 
this 
to 
Hella; 
I 
miss 
her 
dreadfully, 
for 
after 
all 
the 
Weiner 
girls 
are 
only 
strangers, 
and 
I 
could 
never 
tell 
my 
secrets 
to 
Dora, 
though 
we 
are 
quite 
on 
good 
terms 
now. 
Oswald 
is 
coming 
to-morrow. 


August 
1st. 
A 
young 
man 
has 
a 
fine 
time 
of 
it. 
He 
comes 
and 
goes 
when 
he 
likes 
and 
where 
he 
likes. 
A 
telegram 
arrived 
from 
Oswald 
to-day, 
saying 
he 
was 
not 
coming 
till 
the 
middle 
of 
August: 
Konigsee, 
Watzmann, 
glorious 
tramp. 
Letter 
follows. 
Father 
did 
not 
say 
much, 
but 
I 
fancy 
he's 
very 
much 
annoyed. 
Especially 
just 
now, 
after 
poor 
Mother's 
death, 
Oswald 
might 
just 
as 
well 
come 
home. 
Last 
year 
he 
was 
so 
long 
away 
after 
matriculation, 
quite 
alone, 
and 
now 
it's 
the 
same 
this 
year. 
One 
pleasure 
after 
another 
like 
that 
is 
really 
not 
the 
thing 
when 
one's 
Mother 
has 
been 
dead 
only 
three 
months. 
The 
day 
after 
we 
came 
here 
and 
before 
we 
had 
got 
to 
know 
anyone, 
I 
went 
out 
quite 
early, 
at 
half 
past 
8, 
and 
went 
alone 
to 
the 
cemetery. 
It 
is 
on 
the 
slope 
of 
the 
mountain 
and 
some 
of 
the 
tombstones 
are 
frightfully 
old, 
in 
many 
cases 
one 
can't 
decipher 
the 
inscriptions; 
there 
was 
one 
of 
1798 
in 
Roman 
figures. 
I 
sat 
on 
a 
little 
bank 
thinking 
about 
poor 
Mother 
and 
all 
the 
unhappi-ness, 
and 
I 
cried 
so 
terribly 
that 
I 
had 
to 
bathe 
my 
eyes 
lest 
anyone 
should 
notice 
it. 
I 
was 
horribly 
annoyed 
to-day. 
A 
letter 
came 
from 
Aunt 
Alma, 
she 
wants 
to 
come 
here, 
we 
are 
to 
look 
for 
rooms 
for 
her, 
to 
see 
if 
we 
can 
find 
anything 
suitable, 
Aunt 
Alma 
always 
means 
by 
that 
very 
cheap, 
but 
above 
all 
it 
must 
be 
in 
a 
private 
house; 
of 
course, 
for 
a 
boarding 
house 
would 
be 
far 
too 
dear 
for 
them. 
I 
do 
hope 
we 
shan't 
find 
anything 
suitable, 
we 
really 
did 
not 
find 
anything 
to-day, 
for 
a 
storm 
was 
threatening 
and 
we 
did 
not 
go 
far. 
I 
do 
so 
hope 
we 
shall 
have 
no 
better 
success 
to-morrow; 
for 
I 
really 
could 
not 
stand 



having 
Marina 
here, 
she 
is 
such 
a 
spy. 
Thank 
goodness 
Aunt 
Dora 
and 
Dora 
are 
both 
very 
much 
against 
their 
coming. 
But 
Father 
said: 
That 
won't 
do 
girls, 
she's 
your 
aunt, 
and 
you 
must 
look 
for 
rooms 
for 
her. 
All 
right, 
we 
can 
look 
for 
them; 
but 
seeking 
and 
finding 
are 
two 
very 
different 
things. 


August 
2nd. 
This 
morning 
we 
went 
out 
early 
to 
look 
for 
the 
rooms, 
and 
since 
Dora 
always 
makes 
a 
point 
of 
finding 
what's 
wanted, 
she 
managed 
to 
hunt 
up 
2 
rooms 
and 
a 
kitchen, 
though 
they 
are 
only 
in 
a 
farm. 
The 
summer 
visitors 
who 
were 
staying 
there 
had 
to 
go 
back 
suddenly 
to 
Vienna 
because 
their 
grandmother 
died, 
and 
so 
the 
rooms 
are 
to 
let 
very 
cheap. 
Dora 
wrote 
to 
Aunt 
directly, 
and 
she 
said 
that 
we 
shall 
all 
be 
delighted 
to 
see 
them, 
which 
is 
a 
downright 
lie. 
However, 
I 
wrote 
a 
P.S. 
in 
which 
I 
sent 
love 
to 
them 
all, 
and 
said 
that 
the 
journey 
was 
scandalously 
expensive; 
perhaps 
that 
may 
choke 
them 
off 
a 
bit. 
Owing 
to 
this 
silly 
running 
about 
looking 
for 
rooms 
I 
saw 
nothing 
of 
the 
Weiners 
yesterday 
afternoon 
or 
this 
morning, 
and 
of 
course 
nothing 
of 
God 
Balder 
either. 
And 
at 
dinner 
we 
can't 
see 
the 
Scharrers' 
table 
because 
they 
have 
a 
table 
in 
the 
bay 
window, 
for 
they 
have 
come 
here 
every 
year 
for 
the 
last 
9 
years. 
I'm 
absolutely 
tired 
out, 
but 
there's 
something 
I 
must 
write. 
This 
afternoon 
the 
Weiners 
and 
we 
went 
up 
to 
Kreindl's, 
and 
Siegfried 
Sch. 
came 
with 
us, 
for 
he 
knows 
the 
Weiners, 
who 
have 
been 
here 
every 
year 
for 
the 
last 
3 
years. 
He 
talked 
chiefly 
to 
Dora, 
and 
that 
annoyed 
me 
frightfully. 
So 
I 
said 
not 
a 
word, 
but 
walked 
well 
behind 
the 
others. 
On 
the 
way 
home 
he 
came 
up 
to 
me 
and 
said: 
"I 
say, 
Fraulein 
Grete, 
are 
you 
always 
so 
reserved? 
Your 
eyes 
seem 
to 
contradict 
the 
idea." 
I 
said: 
"It 
all 
depends 
on 
my 
mood, 
and 
above 
all 
I 
hate 
forcing 
myself 
on 
any 
one." 
"Could 
you 
not 
change 
places 
at 
table 
with 
your 
mother?" 
"In 
the 
first 
place, 
she 
is 
not 
my 
Mother, 
who 
died 
on 
April 
24th, 
but 
my 
Aunt, 
and 
in 
the 
second 
place, 
why 
do 
you 
say 
that 
to 
me, 
you 
had 
better 
say 
it 
to 
my 
sister!" 
"Don't 
be 
jealous! 
There's 
no 
reason 
for 
that. 
I 
can't 
help 
talking 
to 
your 
sister 
when 
we're 
in 
company; 
but 
I 
can 
assure 
you 
that 
you 
have 
no 
occasion 
whatever 
to 
be 
jealous." 
I 
wish 
I 
knew 
how 
I 
could 
manage 
that 
change 
of 
places, 
but 
I 
always 
sit 
next 
Father; 
anyhow 
I 
would 
not 
do 
it 
directly; 
next 
week 
at 
soonest. 
Farewell, 
my 
Hero 
Siegfried, 
sleep 
sweetly 
and 
dream 
of 
----. 


August 
3rd, 
Anneliese 
wrote 
to 
me: 
You 
heart 
of 
gold, 
so 
you 
are 
able 
to 
forgive 
my 
sins 
of 
youth? 
The 
world 
shines 
with 
a 
new 
light 
since 
I 
received 
your 
letter." 
I 
don't 
know 
that 
my 
letter 
was 
so 
forgiving 
as 
all 
that, 
for 
all 
I 



said 
was 
that 
I 
was 
very 
sorry 
she 
was 
so 
lonely 
in 
Gratsch, 
and 
that 
we 
could 
not 
alter 
the 
past, 
so 
we 
had 
better 
bury 
it. 
She 
sends 
me 
a 
belated 
birthday 
greeting 
(last 
winter 
we 
told 
one 
another 
when 
our 
birthdays 
were), 
and 
she 
sends 
me 
a 
great 
pressed 
forget-me-not. 
She 
waited 
to 
answer 
until 
it 
had 
been 
pressed. 
I 
don't 
know 
quite 
what 
I 
had 
better 
do. 
Big 
Siegfried 
could 
no 
doubt 
give 
me 
very 
good 
advice, 
but 
I 
can't 
very 
well 
tell 
him 
the 
whole 
story, 
for 
then 
I 
should 
have 
to 
tell 
him 
why 
we 
quarrelled, 
and 
that 
would 
be 
awful. 
I 
had 
better 
write 
to 
Hella 
before 
I 
answer. 
I 
must 
write 
to-day, 
for 
it 
will 
be 
quite 
three 
days 
before 
I 
can 
get 
an 
answer, 
and 
then 
1 
or 
two 
days 
more 
before 
Anneliese 
gets 
the 
letter, 
so 
that 
will 
be 
5 
days 
at 
least. 
It 
is 
raining 
in 
torrents, 
so 
it 
is 
very 
dull, 
for 
Father 
won't 
let 
us 
sit 
in 
the 
hall 
alone; 
I 
can't 
think 
why. 
Generally 
speaking 
Father's 
awfully 
kind, 
quite 
different 
from 
other 
fathers, 
but 
this 
is 
really 
disgusting 
of 
him. 
I 
shall 
lie 
down 
on 
the 
sofa 
after 
dinner 
and 
read 
Immensee, 
for 
I've 
not 
had 
a 
chance 
before. 


August 
6th. 
Well, 
the 
whole 
tribe 
arrived 
to-day; 
Marina 
in 
a 
dust-grey 
coat 
and 
skirt 
that 
fits 
her 
abominably, 
and 
Erwin 
and 
Ferdinand; 
Ferdinand 
is 
going 
through 
the 
artillery 
course 
in 
Vienna, 
at 
the 
Neustadt 
military 
academy; 
he's 
the 
most 
presentable 
of 
the 
lot. 
Uncle 
was 
in 
a 
frightful 
temper, 
growling 
about 
the 
journey 
and 
about 
the 
handbaggage, 
I 
think 
they 
must 
have 
had 
8 
or 
10 
packages, 
at 
least 
I 
had 
to 
carry 
a 
heavy 
travelling 
rug 
and 
Dora 
a 
handbag 
of 
which 
she 
said 
that 
it 
contained 
the 
accumulated 
rubbish 
of 
10 
years. 
Aunt 
Alma's 
appearance 
was 
enough 
to 
give 
one 
fits, 
a 
tweed 
dress 
kilted 
up 
so 
high 
that 
one 
saw 
her 
brown 
stockings 
as 
she 
walked, 
and 
a 
hat 
like 
a 
scarecrow's. 
When 
I 
think 
how 
awfully 
well 
dressed 
Mother 
always 
was, 
and 
how 
nice 
she 
always 
looked; 
of 
course 
Mother 
was 
at 
least 
20 
years 
younger 
than 
Aunt 
Alma, 
but 
even 
if 
Mother 
had 
lived 
to 
be 
80 
she 
would 
never 
have 
looked 
like 
that. 
Thank 
goodness, 
on 
the 
way 
from 
the 
station 
we 
did 
not 
meet 
any 
one, 
and 
above 
all 
we 
did 
not 
meet 
him. 
For 
once 
in 
a 
way 
they 
all 
came 
to 
dinner 
at 
our 
boarding 
house. 
We 
had 
two 
tables 
put 
together, 
and 
I 
seized 
the 
opportunity 
to 
change 
my 
place, 
for 
I 
offered 
Aunt 
Alma 
the 
place 
next 
Father 
and 
seated 
myself 
beside 
the 
lovely 
Marina, 
exactly 
opposite 
------! 
Anyway, 
Marina 
looked 
quite 
nice 
at 
dinner, 
for 
her 
white 
blouse 
suits 
her 
very 
well, 
and 
she 
has 
a 
lovely 
complexion, 
so 
white, 
with 
just 
a 
touch 
of 
pink 
in 
the 
cheeks. 
But 
that 
is 
her 
only 
beauty. 
The 
way 
she 
does 
her 
hair 
is 
hideous, 
parted 
and 
brushed 
quite 
smooth, 
with 
two 



pigtails. 
I've 
given 
them 
up 
long 
ago, 
though 
everyone 
said 
they 
suited 
me 
very 
well. 
But 
"snails" 
suit 
me 
a 
great 
deal 
better. 
He 
looked 
across 
at 
me 
the 
whole 
time, 
and 
Aunt 
Alma 
said: 
"Grete 
is 
blossoming 
out, 
I 
hope 
there's 
not 
a 
man 
in 
the 
case 
already." 
"Oh 
no," 
said 
Father, 
"country 
air 
does 
her 
such 
a 
lot 
of 
good, 
and 
when 
I 
take 
the 
children 
away 
for 
a 
change 
I 
don't 
forbid 
any 
innocent 
pleasures." 
My 
darling 
Father, 
I 
had 
to 
keep 
a 
tight 
hand 
on 
myself 
so 
as 
not 
to 
kiss 
him 
then 
and 
there. 
They 
were 
all 
so 
prim, 
with 
their 
eyes 
glued 
to 
their 
plates 
as 
if 
they 
had 
never 
eaten 
rum 
pudding 
before. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
Ferdinand 
winked 
at 
Marina, 
but 
of 
course 
she 
noticed 
nothing. 
They 
soon 
put 
away 
their 
first 
helps, 
and 
they 
all 
took 
a 
second, 
and 
then 
they 
went 
on 
talking. 
When 
we 
went 
to 
our 
rooms 
I 
knocked 
at 
Father's 
door 
and 
gave 
him 
the 
promised 
kiss 
and 
said: 
"You 
really 
are 
a 
jewel 
of 
a 
Father." 
"Well, 
will 
you, 
if 
you 
please, 
be 
a 
jewel 
of 
a 
daughter, 
and 
keep 
the 
peace 
with 
Marina 
and 
the 
others?" 
I 
said: 
"Oh 
dear, 
I 
simply 
can't 
stand 
her, 
she's 
such 
a 
humbug!" 
"Oh 
well," 
said 
Father, 
"it 
may 
be 
a 
pity, 
but 
you 
know 
one 
can't 
choose 
one's 
parents 
and 
one's 
relations." 
"I 
would 
not 
have 
chosen 
any 
different 
parents, 
for 
we 
could 
not 
have 
found 
another 
Father 
and 
another 
Mother 
like 
you." 
Then 
Father 
lifted 
me 
right 
up 
into 
the 
air 
as 
if 
I 
had 
still 
been 
a 
little 
girl, 
saying: 
"You 
are 
a 
little 
treasure," 
and 
we 
kissed 
one 
another 
heartily. 
I 
really 
do 
like 
Father 
better 
than 
anyone 
in 
the 
world; 
for 
the 
way 
I 
like 
Hella 
is 
quite 
different, 
she 
is 
my 
friend, 
and 
Dora 
is 
my 
sister; 
and 
I 
like 
Aunt 
Dora 
too, 
and 
Oswald 
if 
I 
ever 
see 
him 
again. 


August 
8th. 
Oh, 
I 
am 
so 
furious! 
To-day 
I 
got 
a 
postcard 
from 
Hella, 
with 
nothing 
on 
it 
but 
"Follow 
your 
own 
bent, 
with 
best 
wishes, 
your 
M." 
When 
we 
write 
postcards 
we 
always 
use 
a 
cipher 
which 
no 
one 
else 
can 
understand, 
so 
that 
M. 
means 
H. 
It's 
a 
good 
thing 
no 
one 
can 
understand 
it. 
Of 
course 
I 
wrote 
to 
Anneliese 
directly, 
and 
was 
most 
affectionate, 
and 
I 
sent 
a 
postcard 
to 
Hella, 
in 
our 
cipher, 
with 
nothing 
more 
than: 
Have 
done 
so, 
with 
best 
wishes, 
W. 
Not 
even 
your 
W. 
I 
do 
wonder 
what 
she 
will 
do. 
Hero 
Siegfried 
was 
lying 
with 
us 
to-day 
in 
the 
hayfield, 
and 
what 
he 
said 
was 
lovely. 
But 
I 
can't 
agree 
that 
all 
fathers 
without 
exception 
are 
tyrants. 
I 
said: 
"My 
Father 
isn't!" 
He 
rejoined: 
"Not 
yet, 
but 
you 
will 
find 
out 
in 
time. 
However, 
anyone 
with 
a 
character 
of 
his 
own 
won't 
allow 
himself 
to 
be 
suppressed. 
I 
simply 
broke 
with 
my 
Old 
Man 
and 
left 
home; 
there 
are 
other 
technical 
schools 
besides 
the 
one 
in 
Brunn. 
And 
since 
you 
say 
not 
all 
fathers; 
well 
just 
look 
at 
Hulda; 
whenever 
anyone 
fell 
in 
love 
with 
her 
the 
Old 
Man 
marred 
her 



chance, 
for 
no 
one 
can 
stand 
such 
tutelage." 
"Tutelage, 
what 
do 
you 
mean," 
said 
I, 
but 
just 
at 
that 
moment 
everyone 
got 
up 
to 
go 
away. 
To-morrow 
perhaps, 
poor 
persecuted 
man. 


August 
9th. 
Oh 
dear, 
it's 
horrible 
if 
it's 
all 
really 
true 
what 
Hella 
writes 
about 
being 
infected; 
an 
erup-tion 
all 
over 
the 
body, 
that 
is 
the 
most 
horrible 
thing 
in 
the 
world. 
I 
must 
tear 
up 
her 
letter 
directly, 
and 
since 
she 
could 
not 
write 
8 
whole 
pages 
in 
our 
cipher, 
I 
must 
absolutely 
destroy 
it, 
so 
that 
no 
one 
can 
get 
hold 
of 
a 
fragment 
of 
it. 
Above 
all 
now 
that 
Marina 
is 
here, 
for 
you 
never 
can 
tell 
------. 
But 
I 
know 
what 
I'll 
do; 
I'll 
copy 
the 
letter 
here, 
even 
if 
it 
takes 
2 
or 
3 
days. 
She 
writes: 


Darling 
Rita, 
what 
did 
you 
say 
when 
you 
got 
yesterday's 
postcard. 
If 
you 
were 
angry, 
you 
must 
make 
it 
up 
with 
me. 
Consort 
with 
whom 
you 
please 
and 
write 
to 
whom 
you 
please; 
but 
all 
the 
consequences 
be 
on 
your 
own 
head. 
Father 
always 
says: 
Beware 
of 
red 
hair! 
And 
I 
insist 
that 
the 
"innocent 
child" 
has 
foxy 
red 
hair. 
But 
you 
can 
think 
what 
you 
like. 


Now 
I've 
got 
something 
much 
more 
important 
to 
tell 
you. 
But 
you 
must 
promise 
me 
dirst 
that 
you 
will 
tear 
up 
my 
letter 
directly 
you 
have 
read 
it. 
Otherwise 
please 
send 
it 
back 
to 
me 
unread. 


Just 
fancy. 
Here 
in 
B. 
there 
is 
a 
young 
married 
woman 
living 
with 
her 
mother 
and 
her 
cousin, 
a 
girl 
who 
is 
studying 
medicine; 
they 
are 
Poles 
and 
I 
have 
always 
had 
an 
enthusiastic 
admiration 
for 
the 
Poles. 
The 
young 
wife 
has 
got 
a 
divorce 
from 
her 
husband, 
for 
she 
was 
infected 
by 
him 
on 
the 
wedding 
night. 
Of 
course 
you 
remember 
what 
being 
infected 
is. 
But 
really 
it 
is 
something 
quite 
different 
from 
what 
we 
imagined. 
Because 
of 
that 
she 
got 
a 
frightful 
eruption 
all 
over 
her 
body 
and 
her 
face, 
and 
most 
likely 
all 
her 
hair 
will 
fall 
out; 
is 
it 
not 
frightful? 
Her 
cousin, 
the 
medical 
student, 
who 
is 
apparently 
very 
poor, 
is 
there 
to 
nurse 
her. 
Our 
servant 
Rosa 
told 
me 
about 
it, 
she 
heard 
of 
it 
from 
the 
housemaid 
where 
they 
have 
rooms. 
As 
you 
know, 
one 
can't 
talk 
to 
Lizzi 
about 
anything 
of 
that 
kind, 
and 
so 
I 
did 
not 
learn 
any 
more; 
but 
the 
other 
day, 
when 
I 
went 
to 
buy 
some 
picture 
postcards, 
I 
met 
the 
three 
ladies. 
The 
young 
wife 
was 
wearing 
a 
very 
thick 
veil, 
so 
that 
one 
could 
see 
nothing. 
They 
were 
sitting 
on 
a 
bench 
in 
the 
garden 
in 
front 
of 
their 
house, 
and 
I 
bowed 
in 
passing, 
on 
the 
way 
back. 
They 
bowed, 
and 
smiled 
in 
a 
friendly 
way. 
In 
the 
afternoon 
I 
had 
to 
lie 
down, 
for 
I 
was 
feeling 
very 
bad 
because 
of 



. 
. 
. 
.!! 
Then 
I 
suddenly 
heard 
some 
people 
talking 
on 
the 
veranda 
just 
outside 
my 
window--the 
veranda 
runs 
all 
round 
the 
house. 
At 
first 
I 
saw 
shadows 
passing, 
and 
then 
they 
sat 
down 
outside. 
I 
recognised 
the 
soft 
voice 
of 
the 
Polish 
student 
directly, 
and 
I 
heard 
her 
say 
to 
the 
wife 
of 
the 
mayor 
of 
J.: 
"Yes, 
my 
unfortunate 
cousin's 
experience 
has 
been 
a 
terrible 
one; 
that 
is 
because 
people 
sell 
girls 
like 
merchandise, 
without 
asking 
them, 
and 
without 
their 
having 
the 
least 
idea 
what 
they 
are 
in 
for." 
I 
got 
up 
at 
once 
and 
sat 
down 
close 
to 
the 
window 
behind 
the 
curtain 
so 
that 
I 
could 
hear 
everything. 
The 
mayor's 
wife 
said: 
"Yes, 
it's 
horrible 
what 
one 
has 
to 
go 
through 
when 
one 
is 
married. 
My 
husband 
is 
not 
one 
of 
that 
sort 
but 
------And 
then 
I 
could 
not 
understand 
what 
she 
went 
on 
to 
say 
I 
overheard 
this 
conversation 
on 
Thursday. 
But 
that's 
not 
all 
I 
have 
to 
tell 
you. 
Of 
course 
my 
first 
thought 
was, 
if 
only 
I 
could 
have 
a 
talk 
with 
her; 
for 
she 
spoke 
about 
enlightenment 
and 
although 
we 
are 
both 
of 
us 
already 
very 
much 
enlightened, 
still, 
as 
a 
medical 
student, 
she 
must 
know 
a 
great 
deal 
more 
than 
we 
do, 
so 
that 
we 
can 
learn 
from 
her. 
And 
since 
she 
said 
that 
girls 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
allowed 
to 
run 
blindly 
into 
marriage, 
I 
thought 
she 
would 
probably 
tell 
me 
a 
little 
if 
I 
went 
cautiously 
to 
work. 
There 
was 
a 
word 
which 
she 
and 
the 
mayor's 
wife 
used 
more 
than 
once, 
segsual 
and 
I 
don't 
know 
what 
it 
means, 
and 
I'm 
sure 
you 
don't 
know 
either, 
darling 
Rita. 
She 
said 
something 
about 
segsual 
intimacies; 
of 
course 
when 
people 
talk 
about 
intimacies, 
one 
knows 
it 
has 
a 
meaning, 
but 
what 
on 
earth 
does 
segsual 
mean? 
It 
must 
mean 
something, 
since 
it 
is 
used 
with 
intimacy. 
Well, 
let 
me 
get 
on. 
On 
Saturday 
there 
was 
a 
party, 
and 
the 
medical 
student 
came, 
and 
I 
left 
my 
Alpine 
Songs 
lying 
on 
the 
piano, 
and 
somebody 
picked 
it 
up 
and 
turned 
over 
the 
pages, 
and 
the 
word 
went 
round 
that 
the 
person 
to 
whom 
it 
belonged 
must 
sing 
something. 
At 
first 
I 
did 
not 
let 
on, 
but 
went 
out 
for 
a 
moment, 
and 
then 
came 
back 
saying: 
I'm 
looking 
for 
my 
music 
book, 
I 
left 
it 
lying 
about 
somewhere. 
There 
was 
a 
general 
shout, 
and 
everyone 
said: 
We've 
agreed 
that 
the 
person 
to 
whom 
that 
book 
belongs 
has 
got 
to 
sing. 
Now 
I 
knew 
that 
Fraulein 
Karwinska 
had 
accompanied 
the 
singing 
on 
such 
evenings 
before. 
So 
I 
said: 
I 
shall 
be 
delighted 
to 
sing, 
provided 
Fraulein 
K. 
will 
accompany 
me, 
For 
you 
gentlemen 
play 
too 
loud 
for 
my 
voice. 
Great 
laughter, 
but 
I 
had 
got 
what 
I 
wanted. 
We 
were 
introduced, 
and 
I 
thought 
to 
myself: 
You 
will 
soon 
improve 
the 
acquaintance. 
On 
Sunday 
for 
once 
in 
a 
way 
I 
got 
up 
quite 
early, 
at 
half 
past 
6, 
for 
Fraulein 


K. 
can 
only 
go 
out 
walking 
early 
in 
the 
morning 
since 
she 
spends 
the 
whole 
day 
with 
her 
cousin. 
She 
sits 
near 
the 
Luisenquelle, 
so 
I 
went 
there 
with 
a 

book, 
and 
as 
soon 
as 
she 
came 
I 
jumped 
up, 
said 
good-morning, 
and 
went 
on: 
I'm 
afraid 
I've 
taken 
possession 
of 
your 
bench. 
"Not 
at 
all," 
she 
said, 
"Do 
you 
study 
on 
Sundays?" 
"Oh 
no, 
this 
is 
only 
light 
reading," 
I 
answered, 
and 
I 
made 
haste 
to 
sit 
on 
the 
book, 
for 
in 
my 
hurry 
I 
had 
not 
noticed 
what 
it 
was. 
But 
luck 
was 
with 
me. 
She 
sat 
down 
beside 
me 
and 
said: 
"What 
is 
it 
you 
are 
reading 
that 
you 
hide 
so 
anxiously? 
I 
suppose 
it's 
something 
that 
your 
mother 
must 
not 
know 
about." 
"Oh 
no," 
said 
I, 
"we 
have 
not 
brought 
any 
such 
books 
to 
the 
country 
with 
us." 
"I 
take 
it 
that 
means 
that 
you 
do 
manage 
to 
get 
them 
when 
you 
are 
in 
town?" 
"Goodness 
me, 
one 
must 
try 
and 
learn 
a 
little 
about 
life; 
and 
since 
no 
one 
will 
ever 
tell 
one 
anything, 
one 
looks 
about 
for 
oneself 
to 
see 
if 
one 
can 
find 
anything 
in 
a 
book." 
"In 
the 
encyclopedia, 
I 
suppose?" 
"No, 
that's 
no 
good, 
for 
one 
can't 
always 
find 
the 
truth 
there." 
She 
burst 
out 
laughing 
and 
said: 
"What 
sort 
of 
truth 
do 
you 
want?" 
"I 
think 
you 
can 
imagine 
very 
well 
what 
sort 
of 
things 
I 
want 
to 
know." 
Of 
course 
one 
can 
speak 
more 
plainly 
to 
a 
medical 
student 
than 
one 
can 
to 
other 
girls, 
and 
she 
was 
not 
in 
the 
least 
disgusted 
or 
angry 
but 
said: 
Yes, 
it's 
the 
same 
struggle 
everywhere. 
Then 
I 
made 
use 
of 
your 
favourite 
phrase 
and 
said: 
"Struggle, 
what 
do 
you 
mean? 
What 
I 
really 
want 
to 
know 
about 
is 
being 
infected." 
Then 
she 
flushed 
up 
and 
said: 
"Who's 
been 
talking 
to 
you 
about 
that? 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
the 
whole 
town 
is 
chattering 
about 
my 
unhappy 
cousin. 
You 
must 
see 
that 
I 
can't 
tell 
you 
that." 
But 
I 
answered: 
"If 
you 
don't, 
who 
will? 
You 
study 
medicine, 
and 
are 
seeing 
and 
talking 
about 
such 
things 
all 
day." 
"No, 
no, 
my 
dear 
child 
(you 
can 
imagine 
how 
furious 
that 
made 
me), 
you 
are 
still 
much 
too 
young 
for 
that 
sort 
of 
thing." 
What 
do 
you 
think 
of 
that, 
we 
are 
too 
young 
at 
14 
1/2, 
it's 
utterly 
absurd. 
I 
expect 
that 
really 
her 
studies 
have 
not 
gone 
very 
far, 
and 
she 
would 
not 
admit 
it. 
Anyhow, 
I 
stood 
up, 
and 
said: 
"I 
must 
not 
disturb 
you 
any 
longer," 
and 
bowed 
and 
went 
away; 
but 
I 
thought 
to 
myself: 
"A 
fig 
for 
her 
and 
her 
studies; 
fine 
sort 
of 
a 
doctor 
she'll 
make!" 
"What 
do 
you 
think 
about 
it 
all? 
We 
shall 
still 
have 
to 
trust 
to 
the 
encyclopedia, 
and 
after 
all 
a 
lot 
of 
what 
we 
can 
learn 
there 
is 
all 
right, 
and 
luckily 
we 
know 
most 
things 
except 
the 
word 
segsual. 
Next 
winter 
I 
expect 
we 
shall 
find 
it 
easier 
than 
we 
used 
to 
to 
get 
to 
the 
bookcase 
in 
your 
house. 
I 
don't 
bow 
to 
the 
silly 
idiot 
any 
more. 


But 
darling 
Rita, 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
"innocent 
child," 
I 
don't 
want 
to 
influence 
you 
in 
any 
way, 
and 
I 
shan't 
be 
angry 
with 
you 
for 
preferring 
an 
unworthy 
person 
to 
me!!! 
Faithless 
though 
you 
are, 
I 
send 
you 
half 
a 
million 
kisses, 



your 
ever 
faithful 
friend, 
H. 
P.S. 
I 
have 
been 
4 
days 
writing 
this 
letter; 
tear 
it 
up, 
whatever 
you 
do!!! 


Now 
that 
I 
have 
copied 
the 
letter, 
I 
really 
can't 
see 
why 
Hella 
wants 
me 
to 
tear 
it 
up. 
There's 
nothing 
so 
very 
dreadful 
in 
it. 
But 
there 
is 
one 
thing 
I 
shan't 
be 
able 
to 
do 
for 
Hella, 
to 
help 
her 
in 
looking 
up 
things 
in 
the 
encyclopedia. 
I 
think 
I 
should 
always 
feel 
that 
Mother 
would 
suddenly 
come 
in 
and 
stand 
behind 
us. 
No, 
I 
simply 
can't 
do 
it. 


August 
13th. 
Through 
that 
stupid 
copying 
I 
have 
been 
prevented 
writing 
about 
my 
own 
affairs, 
although 
they 
are 
far 
more 
important. 
Last 
Wednesday 
the 
Society 
for 
the 
Preservation 
of 
Natural 
Beauties 
had 
arranged 
a 
great 
excursion 
to 
Inner-Lahn 
in 
breaks. 
Dora 
did 
not 
want 
to 
go 
at 
first, 
but 
Father 
said 
that 
if 
it 
would 
give 
us 
pleasure, 
he 
would 
very 
much 
like 
to 
go 
with 
us, 
and 
Mother 
would 
be 
only 
too 
delighted 
to 
see 
that 
we 
were 
enjoying 
something 
once 
more. 
And 
two 
days 
before 
the 
excursion 
Dora 
finally 
decided 
that 
she 
would 
like 
to 
go; 
I 
knew 
why 
at 
once; 
she 
thought 
that 
by 
that 
time 
all 
the 
places 
would 
have 
been 
taken, 
and 
that 
we 
should 
have 
been 
told: 
Very 
sorry, 
no 
more 
room. 
But 
luckily 
she 
had 
made 
a 
great 
mistake. 
For 
the 
secretary 
said: 
With 
pleasure; 
how 
many 
places 
shall 
I 
reserve? 
and 
so 
we 
said: 
7; 
namely, 
Father, 
Dora, 
and 
I, 
Aunt 
Alma 
(unfortunately), 
Marina 
(very 
unfortunately), 
and 
the 
two 
boys 
(no 
less 
unfortunately). 
"That 
will 
need 
an 
extra 
conveyance," 
replied 
the 
secretary, 
and 
we 
thought 
we 
should 
make 
a 
family 
party. 
But 
it 
was 
not 
so: 
Next 
Dora 
sat 
a 
gentleman 
whom 
I 
had 
seen 
once 
or 
twice 
before, 
and 
he 
paid 
her 
a 
tremendous 
amount 
of 
attention. 
Besides 
that 
there 
were 
2 
strange 
gentlemen, 
Frau 
Bang 
and 
her 
2 
daughters 
and 
her 
son, 
who 
is 
not 
quite 
all 
there; 
opposite 
was 
Hero 
Siegfried, 
a 
young 
lady 
who 
is 
I 
believe 
going 
on 
the 
stage, 
the 
two 
Weiner 
girls 
and 
their 
Mother 
(notwithstanding!!!), 
then 
I, 
and 
afterwards 
Marina, 
Father, 
Aunt 
Alma, 
and 
the 
two 
boys 
opposite. 
I 
don't 
know 
who 
made 
up 
the 
other 
break-loads. 
At 
6 
in 
the 
morning 
we 
all 
met 
outside 
the 
school, 
for 
the 
schoolmaster 
acted 
as 
our 
guide. 
I 
did 
not 
know 
before 
that 
he 
has 
two 
daughters 
and 
a 
son 
who 
has 
matriculated 
this 
year. 
First 
of 
all 
they 
held 
a 
great 
review, 
and 
the 
gentlemen 
fortified 
themselves 
with 
a 
nip 
and 
so 
did 
some 
of 
the 
ladies; 
I 
did 
not, 
for 
I 
hate 
the 
way 
in 
which 
a 
liqueur 
burns 
one's 
throat 
so 
that 
every 
one, 
at 
any 
rate 
girls 
and 
ladies, 
make 
such 
faces 
when 
they 
are 
drinking, 
that 
is 
why 
I 
never 
drink 
liqueur. 
I 
did 
not 
care 
much 
about 



the 
drive 
out, 
for 
it 
was 
very 
cold 
and 
windy, 
most 
of 
us 
had 
red 
noses 
and 
blue 
lips; 
I 
kept 
on 
biting 
my 
lips 
to 
keep 
them 
red, 
for 
one 
looks 
simply 
hideous 
when 
one's 
lips 
are 
white 
or 
blue, 
I 
noticed 
that 
in 
Dora 
when 
we 
were 
skating 
last 
winter. 
Father 
went 
only 
on 
our 
account, 
and 
Aunt 
Dora 
stayed 
at 
home 
so 
that 
Aunt 
Alma 
could 
go. 
Marina 
wears 
"snails" 
now, 
the 
sight 
of 
her 
is 
enough 
to 
give 
one 
fits. 
Dora 
gets 
on 
with 
her 
quite 
well, 
which 
is 
more 
than 
I 
can 
say 
for 
myself. 
Only 
when 
we 
got 
out 
aid 
I 
notice 
that 
Siegfried's 
sister, 
Fraulein 
Hulda, 
had 
been 
sitting 
next 
the 
aspiring 
actress. 
She 
is 
awfully 
nice, 
and 
many, 
many 
years 
ago 
she 
must 
have 
been 
very 
pretty; 
she 
has 
such 
soft 
brown 
eyes, 
and 
her 
hair 
is 
the 
same 
colour 
as 
her 
brother's; 
but 
he 
has 
glorious 
blue 
eyes, 
which 
get 
quite 
black 
when 
he 
is 
angry, 
as 
he 
was 
when 
he 
was 
talking 
about 
his 
father. 
I 
should 
tremble 
before 
him 
in 
his 
wrath. 
He 
is 
so 
tall 
that 
I 
only 
come 
up 
to 
his 
shoulder. 
Father 
calls 
him 
the 
red 
tapeworm; 
but 
that's 
really 
not 
fair. 
He 
is 
very 
broad 
but 
so 
thin. 
In 
Unter-Toifen 
we 
stopped 
for 
breakfast, 
eating 
the 
food 
we 
had 
brought 
with 
us; 
about 
half 
an 
hour; 
then 
the 
schoolmaster 
hurried 
us 
all 
away, 
for 
we 
had 
quite 
10 
miles 
to 
walk. 
The 
two 
boys 
made 
a 
party 
with 
other 
boys, 
and 
we 
five 
girls, 
we 
2, 
the 
2 
Weiners, 
and 
Marina, 
led 
the 
way. 
Aunt 
Alma 
walked 
with 
a 
clergyman's 
wife 
from 
Hildesheim, 
or 
whatever 
it 
was 
called, 
and 
with 
the 
schoolmaster's 
wife. 
It 
was 
awfully 
dull 
at 
first, 
so 
that 
I 
began 
to 
be 
sorry 
that 
I 
had 
begged 
Father 
to 
let 
us 
go. 
But 
after 
we 
had 
gone 
a 
few 
miles 
the 
schoolmaster's 
son 
and 
three 
bright 
young 
fellows 
came 
along 
and 
walked 
with 
us. 
Then 
we 
had 
such 
fun 
that 
we 
could 
hardly 
walk 
for 
laughing, 
and 
the 
elders 
had 
continually 
to 
drive 
us 
on. 
Marina 
was 
quite 
unrestrained, 
I 
could 
never 
have 
believed 
that 
she 
could 
be 
so 
jolly. 
One 
of 
the 
schoolmaster's 
daughters 
fell 
down, 
and 
some 
one 
pulled 
her 
out 
of 
the 
brook 
into 
which 
she 
had 
slid 
because 
she 
was 
laughing 
so 
much. 
I 
really 
don't 
know 
what 
time 
we 
got 
to 
Inner-Lahn, 
for 
we 
were 
enjoying 
ourselves 
so 
much. 
Dinner 
had 
been 
ordered 
ready 
for 
us, 
and 
we 
were 
all 
frantically 
hungry. 
We 
laughed 
without 
stopping, 
for 
we 
had 
all 
sat 
down 
just 
as 
we 
had 
come 
in, 
although 
Aunt 
Alma 
did 
not 
want 
us 
to 
at 
first. 
But 
she 
was 
outvoted. 
I 
was 
especially 
pleased 
to 
show 
Hero 
Siegfried 
that 
I 
could 
amuse 
myself 
very 
well 
without 
him, 
for 
he 
had 
frozen 
on 
to 
the 
aspiring 
actress, 
or 
she 
had 
frozen 
on 
to 
him--I 
don't 
know 
which, 
or 
at 
least 
I 
did 
not 
know 
then! 
Since 
we 
were 
sitting 
all 
mixed 
up 
everyone 
had 
to 
pay 
for 
himself, 
and 
Father 
said 
next 
day 
we 
had 
spent 
a 
perfect 
fortune; 
but 
that 
was 
not 
in 
the 
hotel, 
it 
happened 
later, 
when 
we 
were 
buying 
mementoes. 
And 
I 
think 
Dora 



gave 
Marina 
3 
crowns, 
so 
that 
she 
could 
buy 
some 
things 
too. 
But 
Dora 
never 
lets 
on 
about 
anything 
of 
that 
sort. 
I 
must 
say 
I 
like 
her 
character 
better 
and 
better; 
in 
those 
ways 
she 
is 
very 
like 
Mother. 
Well, 
our 
purchases 
were 
all 
packed 
into 
two 
or 
three 
rucksacks, 
and 
were 
kept 
for 
a 
raffle 
in 
Unter-Toifen 
on 
the 
way 
back. 
I 
must 
have 
spent 
at 
least 
7 
crowns, 
for 
Father 
had 
given 
each 
of 
us 
5 
crowns 
before 
we 
started, 
and 
I 
still 
had 
a 
lot 
of 
my 
August 
pocket 
money 
left, 
and 
now 
I've 
got 
only 
40 
hellers. 
After 
we 
had 
had 
dinner 
and 
bought 
the 
things 
we 
lay 
about 
in 
the 
forest 
or 
walked 
about 
in 
couples. 
I 
had 
curled 
myself 
up 
for 
a 
nap 
when 
some 
one 
came 
up 
behind 
me, 
and 
when 
I 
sat 
up 
this 
someone 
put 
his 
hands 
over 
my 
eyes 
and 
said: 
"The 
Mountain 
Spirit." 
And 
I 
recognised 
his 
hands 
instantly, 
and 
said: 
"Hero 
Siegfried!" 
Then 
he 
laughed 
like 
anything 
and 
sat 
down 
beside 
me 
and 
said: 
"You 
were 
enjoying 
yourself 
so 
much 
this 
morning 
that 
you 
had 
not 
even 
a 
glance 
to 
spare 
for 
me." 
"Contrariwise 
(I've 
got 
that 
from 
Dora), 
I 
never 
foist 
myself 
on 
anyone, 
and 
never 
hang 
around 
anyone's 
neck." 
Then 
he 
wanted 
to 
put 
his 
arm 
round 
my 
waist 
(and 
probably, 
most 
probably, 
he 
would 
have 
kissed 
me), 
but 
I 
sprang 
to 
my 
feet 
and 
called 
Dora 
or 
rather 
Thea, 
for 
before 
the 
gentlemen 
we 
pretend 
that 
we 
never 
call 
one 
another 
anything 
but 
Thea 
and 
Rita. 
Father 
says 
that 
that 
is 
awfully 
silly, 
and 
no 
longer 
suitable 
for 
Dora 
(but 
of 
course 
it 
was 
alright 
for 
me!), 
but 
we 
keep 
to 
our 
arrangement. 
Then 
he 
raised 
my 
hand 
to 
his 
lips 
and 
said: 
"Don't 
call!" 
But 
Dora 
came 
up, 
and 
with 
her 
the 
gentleman 
with 
the 
pincenez, 
who 
is 
a 
doctor 
of 
law 
belonging 
to 
the 
District 
Court 
of 
Innsbruck, 
and 
Marina 
and 
one 
of 
the 
young 
men, 
and 
I 
asked, 
"I 
say, 
when 
are 
we 
going 
to 
have 
tea?" 
"Just 
fancy, 
she 
is 
hungry 
again 
already," 
they 
all 
said, 
and 
laughed 
like 
anything. 
And 
Dora 
looked 
frightfully 
happy. 
She 
was 
wearing 
an 
edelweiss 
buttonhole 
which 
she 
had 
not 
been 
wearing 
before; 
in 
the 
evening 
she 
told 
me 
that 
Dr. 
P. 
had 
given 
it 
her. 
If 
possible 
he 
is 
even 
taller 
than 
Hero 
Siegfried, 
for 
Dora 
is 
taller 
than 
I 
am 
and 
her 
head 
only 
comes 
up 
to 
his 
ear. 
At 
3 
o'clock 
the 
last 
party 
came 
up 
to 
the 
belvedere, 
we 
had 
got 
there 
earlier. 
The 
view 
was 
lovely. 
But 
I 
must 
say 
I 
can 
enjoy 
a 
fine 
view 
much 
better 
when 
I 
am 
alone, 
that 
is 
with 
Father 
or 
quite 
a 
few 
persons; 
it 
is 
no 
good 
when 
there's 
such 
a 
crowd; 
each 
additional 
person 
seems 
to 
take 
something 
more 
away. 
In 
a 
lovely 
place 
and 
at 
the 
cemetery 
one 
must 
be 
alone. 
For 
a 
beautiful 
view 
usually 
makes 
one 
feel 
frightfully 
sad, 
and 
one 
ought 
not 
to 
have 
been 
laughing 
so 
much 
just 
before, 
or 
laugh 
directly 
afterwards. 
If 
I 
were 
alone 
in 
Inner-Lahn 
I'm 
sure 
I 
should 
become 
melancholy, 
for 
it 
is 
so 
gloriously 
beautiful 
there. 



At 
4 
o'clock, 
after 
tea, 
we 
started 
back, 
for 
the 
schoolmaster 
thought 
the 
descent 
would 
not 
take 
more 
than 
two 
hours 
and 
a 
half, 
but 
we 
needed 
more 
than 
three. 
For 
we 
were 
all 
very 
tired, 
and 
a 
great 
many 
of 
them 
had 
sore 
feet, 
especially 
Aunt 
Alma! 
We 
had 
said 
before, 
that 
it 
would 
be 
too 
much 
for 
Aunt; 
but 
she 
had 
to 
come 
with 
us 
to 
take 
care 
of 
Marina, 
though 
Marina 
enjoyed 
herself 
extremely 
with 
a 
Herr 
Furtner, 
who 
is 
studying 
mining 
like 
Oswald, 
not 
in 
Leoben 
but 
in 
Germany. 
One 
does 
not 
really 
find 
out 
what 
a 
girl 
is 
like 
until 
one 
sees 
how 
she 
behaves 
with 
a 
man, 
or 
what 
she 
is 
like 
when 
one 
talks 
to 
her 
about 
certain 
things; 
as 
for 
the 
last, 
of 
course 
that's 
impossible 
with 
Marina 
since 
the 
experience 
we 
had. 
But 
anyhow 
she 
is 
nicer 
than 
one 
would 
have 
thought 
at 
first 
sight. 
It 
was 
lovely 
on 
the 
way 
home. 
Driving 
back 
from 
Unter-Toifen 
we 
sat 
quite 
differently. 


In 
our 
break, 
instead 
of 
the 
Weiners, 
there 
were 
three 
students 
from 
Munich, 
they 
were 
awfully 
nice, 
and 
we 
sang 
all 
the 
songs 
we 
knew; 
especially 
"Hoch 
vom 
Dachstein, 
wo 
der 
Aar 
nur 
haust," 
and 
"Forelle 
" 
and 
"Wo 
mein 
Schatz 
ist," 
were 
lovely, 
and 
the 
people 
in 
two 
different 
breaks 
sang 
together. 
And 
then 
some 
of 
them 
sang 
some 
Alpine 
songs 
and 
yodelled 
till 
the 
hills 
echoed. 
Two 
or 
three 
of 
the 
men 
in 
the 
third 
break 
were 
rather 
tipsy 
and 
Hero 
Siegfried!! 
was 
one 
of 
them. 
Aunt 
Alma 
had 
a 
frightful 
headache; 
it 
was 
utterly 
idiotic 
for 
her 
to 
come, 
and 
we 
did 
not 
know 
yet 
what 
was 
still 
to 
happen. 
At 
every 
house 
from 
which 
a 
girl 
had 
come 
there 
was 
a 
serenade. 
And 
next 
evening 
there 
was 
to 
be 
a 
great 
raffle 
of 
the 
mementoes 
we 
had 
bought, 
but 
Father 
would 
not 
let 
us 
go 
to 
that. 


August 
14th. 
It 
is 
desperately 
dull. 
I 
don't 
know 
what 
on 
earth 
to 
do, 
so 
I 
am 
writing 
my 
diary. 
Besides, 
I 
have 
not 
written 
about 
the 
row 
yet. 
The 
next 
afternoon 
Aunt 
Alma 
came 
just 
as 
we 
were 
going 
out 
and 
said 
to 
Father: 
Ernst, 
please 
let 
me 
have 
a 
word 
with 
you. 
Now 
we 
all 
know 
Aunt 
Alma's 
let 
me 
have 
a 
word 
with 
you. 
In 
plain 
language 
it 
means: 
I'm 
going 
to 
make 
a 
scene. 
She 
began 
: 
Ernst, 
you 
know 
I 
never 
like 
these 
big 
parties 
with 
a 
lot 
of 
strangers, 
for 
no 
good 
can 
come 
of 
them. 
Still, 
I 
made 
up 
my 
mind 
to 
go 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
the 
children, 
and 
chiefly 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
your 
motherless 
children. 
(Nobody 
asked 
her 
to; 
and 
Aunt 
Dora 
had 
to 
stay 
at 
home 
on 
her 
account.) 
Do 
you 
know 
what 
sort 
of 
people 
were 
in 
our 
company? 
That 
impudent 
young 
student 
whom 
Gretel 
is 
always 
running 
after 
(did 
you 
ever 
hear 



anything 
like 
it! 
I 
should 
like 
to 
know 
when 
I 
ran 
after 
him; 
I 
suppose 
in 
the 
wood 
I 
put 
my 
arm 
round 
his 
waist, 
and 
I 
suppose 
that 
it 
was 
I 
who 
began 
the 
acquaintance 
on 
my 
birthday) 
and 
that 
girl 
who's 
training 
for 
the 
stage 
did 
not 
come 
home 
after 
the 
excursion 
till 
the 
night 
was 
half 
over. 
God 
knows 
where 
they 
were! 
They 
were 
certainly 
no 
cleaner 
when 
they 
got 
home. 
(Naturally, 
for 
where 
could 
they 
have 
had 
a 
wash.) 
His 
father 
gave 
the 
young 
blackguard 
a 
fine 
talking 
to, 
but 
of 
course 
the 
girl's 
mother 
takes 
her 
side. 
It 
would 
positively 
kill 
me 
to 
think 
of 
my 
Marina 
doing 
anything 
of 
the 
kind." 
Father 
was 
able 
to 
get 
a 
word 
in 
at 
last: 
"But 
my 
dear 
Alma, 
what 
has 
all 
this 
to 
do 
with 
my 
girls? 
As 
far 
as 
I 
know 
these 
two 
people 
weren't 
in 
our 
break, 
isn't 
that 
so 
girls?" 
I 
was 
glad 
that 
Father 
turned 
to 
us, 
and 
I 
said: 
Siegfried 
Sch. 
and 
the 
girl 
drove 
in 
the 
fourth 
break, 
I 
saw 
them 
getting 
in. 
And 
it 
was 
toute 
meme 
chause 
where 
he 
drove 
and 
with 
whom 
he 
was 
driving." 
(Of 
course 
that's 
not 
true, 
but 
I 
said 
it 
was 
because 
of 
Aunt.) 
"Such 
language 
and 
such 
a 
tone 
to 
your 
own 
Father!" 
Directly 
she 
said 
that 
Father 
was 
in 
such 
a 
passion 
as 
I 
have 
never 
seen 
him 
in 
before. 
"My 
dear 
Alma, 
I 
really 
must 
beg 
you 
not 
to 
interfere 
with 
my 
educational 
methods, 
any 
more 
than 
I 
ever 
attempt 
to 
interfere 
in 
your 
affairs." 
Father 
said 
this 
quite 
quietly, 
but 
he 
was 
simply 
white 
with 
rage, 
and 
Dora 
told 
me 
afterwards 
that 
I 
was 
quite 
white 
too, 
also 
from 
rage 
of 
course. 
Aunt 
Alma 
said: 
"I 
don't 
want 
to 
prophesy 
evil, 
but 
the 
future 
will 
show 
who 
is 
right 
Goodbye." 
As 
soon 
as 
she 
had 
gone 
Dora 
and 
I 
rushed 
to 
Father 
and 
said: 
"Please 
Father, 
don't 
be 
so 
frightfully 
angry; 
there's 
no 
reason 
why 
you 
should." 
And 
Father 
was 
awfully 
sweet 
and 
said: 
"I 
know 
quite 
well 
that 
I 
can 
trust 
you; 
you 
are 
my 
Berta's 
children." 
And 
then 
I 
simply 
could 
not 
contain 
myself, 
and 
I 
said: 
"No, 
Father, 
I 
really 
did 
flirt 
with 
Siegfried, 
and 
in 
the 
wood 
he 
put 
his 
arm 
round 
my 
waist; 
but 
I 
did 
not 
let 
him 
kiss 
me, 
I 
give 
you 
my 
word 
I 
did 
not. 
And 
if 
you 
want 
me 
to 
I'll 
promise 
never 
to 
speak 
to 
him 
again." 
And 
then 
Father 
said: 
"Really, 
Gretel, 
you 
have 
plenty 
of 
time 
yet 
for 
such 
affairs, 
and 
even 
if 
that 
red-haired 
rascal 
plays 
the 
gallant 
with 
you, 
he 
is 
only 
making 
himself 
a 
laughingstock. 
And 
you 
don't 
want 
that, 
do 
you, 
little 
witch?" 
Then 
I 
threw 
my 
arms 
round 
Father 
and 
promised 
him 
on 
my 
word 
of 
honour 
that 
I 
would 
never 
speak 
to 
Siegfried 
again. 
For 
it 
really 
distresses 
me 
very 
much 
that 
he 
should 
make 
himself 
ridiculous; 
and 
that 
he 
should 
go 
out 
walking 
half 
the 
night 
with 
that 
girl; 
such 
shamelessness! 


We 
were 
so 
much 
upset 
that 
we 
did 
not 
go 
for 
a 
walk, 
and 
of 
course 
did 
not 



go 
to 
the 
raffle. 
But 
I'm 
frightfully 
sorry 
about 
those 
things 
I 
paid 
7 
crowns 
for. 
I 
do 
hope 
he 
did 
not 
win 
any 
of 
them. 


August 
15th. 
Just 
a 
few 
words 
more. 
Early 
this 
morning, 
as 
I 
was 
going 
to 
breakfast, 
in 
the 
corridor 
I 
met 
S. 
(it's 
a 
good 
thing 
that 
is 
the 
initial 
both 
of 
his 
name 
and 
of 
Strick 
[rascal] 
as 
Father 
called 
him) 
and 
he 
said: 
"Good 
morning, 
Fraulein 
Gretchen. 
Why 
weren't 
you 
at 
the 
raffle? 
Hadn't 
you 
any 
share?--"Oh 
yes, 
I 
had 
bought 
7 
crowns 
worth 
for 
it, 
but 
I 
had 
no 
fancy 
for 
the 
company 
I 
should 
meet."----Why, 
what 
has 
taken 
you 
all 
of 
a 
sudden? 
They 
were 
the 
same 
people 
as 
at 
the 
excursion! 
------"Precisely 
for 
that 
reason," 
said 
I, 
and 
passed 
on. 
I 
think 
I 
gave 
him 
what 
for, 
for 
he 
simply 
must 
have 
understood. 
Father 
is 
really 
quite 
right, 
and 
it 
is 
not 
at 
all 
nice 
to 
abuse 
one's 
parents 
to 
strangers 
as 
he 
is 
always 
doing. 
I 
could 
not 
say 
a 
word 
against 
my 
parents 
to 
anyone, 
although 
I'm 
often 
frightfully 
angry 
with 
them; 
of 
course 
not 
about 
Mother, 
for 
she 
is 
dead. 
But 
not 
even 
about 
Father; 
I 
would 
rather 
choke 
down 
the 
greatest 
injustice. 
For 
when 
we 
had 
that 
trouble 
with 
Aunt 
Alma 
about 
Marina, 
I 
was 
really 
not 
in 
the 
least 
to 
blame, 
but 
he 
scolded 
me 
so, 
even 
while 
Aunt 
Alma 
was 
there, 
so 
that 
I 
can 
never 
forget 
it. 
But 
still, 
to 
a 
stranger, 
to 
some 
one 
whom 
I 
had 
only 
just 
got 
to 
know, 
I 
would 
never 
say 
a 
word 
against 
anyone 
in 
our 
family; 
though 
I 
used 
to 
get 
on 
so 
badly 
with 
Dora, 
I 
never 
said 
much 
against 
her 
even 
to 
Hella; 
at 
most 
that 
she 
was 
deceitful, 
and 
that 
really 
used 
to 
be 
so, 
though 
she 
seldom 
is 
now. 


August 
19th. 
It 
is 
so 
filthyly 
dull 
here; 
I 
can't 
bear 
the 
word 
filthy, 
but 
it's 
the 
only 
one 
that's 
strong 
enough. 
Oswald 
is 
coming 
this 
evening, 
at 
last. 
Thank 
goodness. 
S. 
has 
made 
several 
advances, 
but 
I 
have 
ignored 
them. 
Let 
him 
stick 
to 
his 
actress 
who 
can 
go 
out 
walking 
with 
him 
half 
the 
night. 
I 
really 
should 
like 
to 
know 
where 
they 
went. 
In 
the 
night, 
I 
never 
heard 
of 
such 
a 
thing! 
Dora 
says 
she 
took 
a 
dislike 
to 
S. 
from 
the 
first 
because 
he 
---------it's 
an 
absolute 
lie! 
------has 
clammy! 
hands. 
It's 
simply 
not 
true, 
on 
the 
contrary 
he 
has 
such 
entrancingly 
cool 
hands, 
I'm 
sure 
I 
must 
know 
that 
better 
than 
Dora. 
But 
I've 
known 
for 
a 
long 
time 
that 
whenever 
anyone 
pays 
me 
attention 
Dora 
is 
unsympathetic, 
naturally 
enough. 
By 
the 
way, 
on 
Sunday 
I 
got 
a 
charming 
letter 
from 
Anneliese. 
I 
must 
answer 
it 
to-day. 


August 
22nd. 
Oswald 
is 
awfully 
nice. 
He 
did 
not 
forget 
my 
birthday, 
but 
he 
says 
that 
at 
that 
time 
he 
was 
stoney, 
in 
student's 
slang 
that 
means 
that 
he 



hadn't 
any 
money, 
and 
then 
he 
could 
not 
find 
anything 
suitable, 
but 
that 
he 
will 
repair 
the 
omission 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
get 
back 
to 
Vienna. 
But 
I 
don't 
know 
what 
I 
should 
like. 
Oswald 
is 
going 
to 
stay 
until 
we 
all 
go 
back 
to 
Vienna, 
and 
we 
are 
making 
a 
few 
excursions 
by 
ourselves. 
That 
is 
really 
the 
best 
way 
after 
all. 
I 
am 
not 
much 
with 
the 
Weiners 
now, 
for 
we 
had 
a 
little 
tiff 
on 
the 
big 
excursion. 
But 
Nelly 
is 
rather 
taken 
with 
Oswald, 
so 
she 
came 
twice 
to 
our 
table 
to-day, 
once 
about 
a 
book 
we 
had 
lent 
her, 
and 
once 
to 
arrange 
for 
a 
walk. 


August 
24th. 
It 
is 
really 
absurd 
that 
one's 
own 
brother 
can 
think 
such 
a 
lot 
of 
one; 
but 
if 
he 
does, 
I 
suppose 
he 
knows. 
Oswald 
said 
to 
me 
to-day: 
Gretl, 
you 
are 
so 
smart 
I 
could 
bite 
you. 
How 
you 
are 
developing." 
I 
said: 
"I 
don't 
want 
anyone 
to 
bite 
me, 
and 
he 
said: 
"Nor 
do 
I," 
but 
I 
was 
awfully 
delighted, 
though 
he 
is 
only 
my 
brother. 
He 
can't 
stand 
Marina, 
and 
as 
a 
man 
he 
finds 
Dora 
too 
stupid; 
I 
think 
he's 
right, 
really. 
And 
I 
simply 
can't 
understand 
Dr. 
P., 
that 
he 
can 
always 
find 
something 
to 
talk 
about 
to 
Dora. 
He 
has 
hardly 
said 
10 
words 
to 
me 
yet. 
Still, 
I 
don't 
care. 


August 
27th. 
We 
went 
up 
the 
Matscherkogel 
yesterday, 
and 
we 
had 
a 
lovely 
view. 
The 
two 
boys 
came, 
for 
they 
had 
begged 
their 
father 
to 
let 
them; 
but 
of 
course 
Aunt 
Alma 
and 
Marina 
did 
not 
come. 
Oswald 
calls 
Aunt 
Alma 
Angular 
Pincushion, 
but 
only 
when 
Father 
isn't 
there, 
for 
after 
all 
she 
is 
Father's 
sister. 
The 
Weiners 
wanted 
to 
come 
too, 
but 
I 
said 
that 
my 
brother 
was 
staying 
only 
a 
few 
days 
more, 
and 
that 
this 
was 
a 
farewell 
excursion 
en 
famille." 
They 
were 
rather 
hurt, 
but 
they 
have 
made 
me 
very 
angry 
by 
the 
way 
in 
which 
they 
will 
go 
on 
talking 
about 
S. 
in 
front 
of 
me, 
on 
purpose, 
saying 
that 
he 
is 
engaged 
or 
is 
going 
to 
be 
engaged 
to 
the 
actress 
girl 
against 
his 
father's 
will. 
What 
does 
it 
matter 
to 
me? 
They 
keep 
on 
exchanging 
glances 
when 
they 
say 
that, 
especially 
Olga, 
who 
is 
really 
rather 
stupid. 
I 
am 
so 
sad 
now 
at 
times 
that 
I 
simply 
can't 
understand 
how 
I 
could 
have 
enjoyed 
myself 
so 
much 
on 
the 
big 
excursion. 
I'm 
always 
thinking 
of 
dear 
Mother, 
and 
I 
often 
wear 
my 
black 
frock. 
It 
suits 
my 
mood 
better. 


August 
30th. 
I 
believe 
the 
Schs. 
are 
leaving 
to-morrow. 
At 
least 
the 
old 
gentleman 
said 
to 
Father 
the 
day 
before 
yesterday: 
"Thank 
the 
Lord, 
we 
shall 
soon 
be 
able 
to 
enjoy 
the 
comforts 
of 
home 
once 
more." 
That 
is 
what 
Hella's 
grandmother 
used 
to 
say 
before 
they 
came 
back 
from 
the 
country. 
And 
to-day 



I 
saw 
two 
great 
trunks 
standing 
in 
the 
passage 
just 
outside 
Herr 
Scharrer's 
room. 
Oswald 
thinks 
the 
old 
gentleman 
charming; 
well, 
there's 
no 
accounting 
for 
tastes. 
I 
don't 
believe 
he's 
ever 
spoken 
to 
S., 
though 
he 
is 
a 
German 
Nationalist 
too, 
but 
of 
a 
different 
section; 
Oswald 
belongs 
to 
the 
Sudmark, 
and 
S. 
abused 
that 
section 
frightfully 
when 
I 
told 
him 
that 
Oswald 
belonged 
to 
the 
Sudmark. 


August 
31st. 
He 
has 
really 
gone 
to-day, 
that 
is, 
the 
whole 
family 
has 
gone. 
They 
came 
to 
bid 
us 
goodbye 
yesterday 
after 
supper, 
and 
they 
left 
this 
morning 
by 
the 
9 
o'clock 
train 
to 
Innsbruck. 
And 
his 
hands 
are 
not 
clammy, 
I 
paid 
particular 
attention 
to 
the 
point; 
it 
is 
pure 
imagination 
on 
Dora's 
part. 
He 
and 
Oswald 
greeted 
one 
another 
with 
Hail! 
That's 
a 
splendid 
salutation, 
and 
I 
shall 
introduce 
it 
between 
Hella 
and 
me. 


September 
2nd. 
The 
Weiners 
left 
to-day 
too, 
because 
people 
are 
really 
beginning 
to 
stare 
at 
their 
mother 
too 
much. 
When 
Olga 
said 
goodbye 
to 
me 
she 
told 
me 
she 
hated 
having 
to 
travel 
with 
her 
mother 
and 
whenever 
possible 
she 
would 
lag 
behind 
a 
little 
so 
that 
people 
should 
not 
know 
they 
belonged 
together. 


September 
4th. 
I 
never 
heard 
of 
such 
a 
thing!! 
S. 
has 
come 
back, 
alone 
of 
course. 
Everyone 
is 
indignant, 
for 
he 
has 
only 
come 
back 
because 
of 
Fraulein 
A., 
the 
actress 
girl. 
But 
Oswald 
defends 
him 
like 
anything. 
This 
afternoon 
Frau 
Lunda 
said 
to 
Aunt 
Dora: 
"It's 
simply 
scandalous, 
and 
his 
parents 
certainly 
ought 
not 
to 
have 
allowed 
him 
to 
come, 
even 
if 
the 
girl's 
mother 
does 
not 
know 
any 
better." 
Then 
Oswald 
said: 
"Excuse 
me, 
Frau 
Lunda, 
Scharrer 
is 
no 
longer 
a 
schoolboy 
who 
must 
cling 
to 
his 
mother's 
apron-
string; 
such 
tutelage 
would 
really 
be 
unworthy 
of 
a 
full-grown 
German." 
I 
was 
so 
pleased 
that 
he 
gave 
a 
piece 
of 
his 
mind 
to 
Frau 
L., 
for 
she 
is 
always 
glaring 
at 
one 
and 
is 
so 
frantically 
inquisitive. 
And 
tutelage 
is 
such 
an 
impressive 
word, 
S. 
used 
it 
once 
when 
he 
was 
speaking 
of 
his 
sister 
and 
why 
she 
had 
never 
married. 
Frau 
L. 
was 
furious. 
She 
turned 
to 
Aunt 
Dora 
and 
said: 
"Young 
men 
naturally 
take 
one 
another's 
part, 
until 
they 
are 
fathers 
themselves 
and 
then 
they 
hold 
other 
views." 


September 
8th. 
Thank 
goodness 
we 
are 
going 
home 
the 
day 
after 
to-morrow. 
It 
really 
has 
been 
rather 
dull 
here, 
certainly 
I 
can't 
join 
in 
the 
paean 
Hella 
sang 
about 
the 
place 
last 
year; 
of 
course 
they 
were 
not 
staying 
in 
the 



Edelweiss 
boarding 
house 
but 
in 
the 
Hotel 
Kaiser 
von 
Oesterreich. 
It 
makes 
a 
lot 
of 
difference 
where 
one 
is 
staying. 
By 
the 
way, 
it 
has 
just 
occurred 
to 
me. 
The 
young 
wife 
who 
had 
the 
eruption 
after 
infection 
can't 
have 
been 
divorced, 
as 
Hella 
wrote 
me 
the 
week 
before 
last; 
for 
her 
husband 
has 
been 
there 
on 
a 
visit, 
he 
is 
an 
actor 
at 
the 
Theatre 
Royal 
in 
Munich. 
So 
it 
would 
seem 
that 
actors 
really 
are 
all 
infected; 
and 
Hella 
always 
says 
it 
is 
only 
officers! 
She 
takes 
rather 
an 
exaggerated 
view. 


September 
14th. 
We 
have 
been 
back 
in 
Vienna 
since 
the 
11th, 
but 
I 
have 
been 
absolutely 
unable 
to 
write, 
though 
there 
was 
plenty 
to 
write 
about. 
For 
the 
first 
person 
I 
met 
when 
I 
went 
out 
on 
the 
11th 
to 
fetch 
some 
cocoa 
which 
Resi 
had 
forgotten, 
was 
Lieutenant 
R. 
Viktor, 
the 
Conqueror!! 
Of 
course 
he 
recognised 
me 
immediately, 
and 
was 
awfully 
friendly, 
and 
walked 
with 
me 
a 
little 
way. 
He 
asked 
casually 
after 
Dora, 
but 
it 
is 
obvious 
that 
he 
is 
not 
in 
love 
with 
her 
any 
more. 
And 
it 
was 
so 
funny 
that 
he 
should 
not 
know 
that 
Dora 
had 
matriculated 
this 
year 
and 
so 
would 
not 
be 
going 
to 
the 
High 
School 
any 
more. 
I 
did 
not 
tell 
him 
that 
she 
intends 
to 
go 
on 
with 
her 
studies, 
for 
it 
is 
not 
absolutely 
settled 
yet. 


September 
16th. 
Hella 
came 
home 
yesterday; 
I 
am 
so 
glad; 
I 
greeted 
her 
with: 
Hail! 
but 
she 
said; 
"don't 
be 
silly," 
besides, 
it's 
unsuitable 
for 
an 
Austrian 
officer's 
daughter!!! 
Still, 
we 
won't 
quarrel 
about 
it 
after 
2 
months' 
separation, 
and 
Servus 
is 
very 
smart 
too 
though 
not 
so 
distinguished. 
She 
told 
me 
a 
tremendous 
lot 
more 
about 
that 
young 
married 
woman; 
some 
of 
the 
ladies 
in 


B. 
said 
that 
her 
cousin 
was 
in 
love 
with 
the 
husband. 
That 
would 
be 
awful, 
for 
then 
she 
would 
get 
infected 
too; 
but 
Hella 
says 
she 
did 
not 
notice 
anything, 
though 
she 
watched 
very 
closely 
during 
the 
fortnight 
he 
was 
there. 
He 
sang 
at 
two 
of 
the 
musical 
evenings, 
but 
she 
did 
not 
see 
any 
sign 
of 
it. 
Lizzi 
is 
engaged, 
but 
Hella 
could 
not 
write 
anything 
about 
it, 
for 
the 
engagement 
is 
only 
being 
officially 
announced 
now 
that 
they 
are 
back 
in 
Vienna; 
her 
fiance 
is 
Baron 
G. 
He 
is 
an 
attache 
in 
London, 
and 
she 
met 
him 
there. 
He 
is 
madly 
in 
love 
with 
her. 
In 
August 
he 
was 
on 
leave, 
and 
he 
came 
to 
B. 
to 
make 
an 
offer 
of 
marriage; 
that 
is 
why 
they 
stayed 
the 
whole 
summer 
in 
B. 
instead 
of 
going 
to 
Hungary. 
Those 
were 
the 
special 
circumstances, 
about 
which 
Hella 
said 
she 
could 
not 
write 
to 
me. 
I 
don 
t 
see 
why 
she 
could 
not 
have 
told 
me 
that, 
I 
should 
have 
kept 
it 
to 
myself; 
and 
after 
all, 
Lizzi 
is 
19 
1/2 
now, 
and 
no 
one 
would 
have 
been 
surprised 
that 
she 
is 
engaged 
at 
last. 

They 
can't 
have 
a 
great 
betrothal 
party, 
for 
Baron 
G.'s 
father 
died 
in 
July. 
Hella 
is 
very 
much 
put 
out. 
Lizzi 
says 
it 
does 
not 
matter 
a 
bit. 


September 
18th. 
Lizzi's 
betrothal 
cards 
arrived 
to-day. 
It 
must 
be 
glorious 
to 
send 
out 
betrothal 
cards. 
Dora 
got 
quite 
red 
with 
annoyance, 
though 
she 
said 
when 
I 
asked 
her: 
"Why 
do 
you 
flush 
up 
so, 
surely 
there's 
no 
reason 
to 
be 
ashamed 
when 
anyone 
is 
engaged!" 
"Really, 
why 
should 
you 
think 
I 
am 
ashamed, 
I 
am 
merely 
extremely 
surprised." 
But 
one 
does 
not 
get 
so 
red 
as 
that 
from 
surprise. 


September 
19th. 
School 
began 
to-day; 
unfortunately, 
for 
she 
has 
gone. 
And 
what 
was 
the 
Third 
is 
now 
the 
Fourth, 
and 
that 
is 
detestable, 
to 
sit 
in 
the 
classroom 
without 
her. 
Luckily 
we 
have 
Frau 
Doktor 
St. 
as 
class 
mistress, 
and 
she 
is 
to 
teach 
us 
mathematics 
and 
physics 
once 
more; 
Frau 
Doktor 
F., 
whom 
we 
used 
to 
call 
Nutling 
and 
the 
Fifth 
used 
to 
call 
Waterfall 
has 
gone, 
for 
she 
has 
been 
appointed 
to 
the 
German 
High 
School 
in 
Lemberg. 
For 
the 
time 
being 
we 
are 
sitting 
in 
our 
old 
place, 
but 
Hella 
says 
we 
must 
ask 
Frau 
Doktor 
S. 
to 
let 
us 
have 
another 
seat, 
for 
the 
memory 
of 
the 
three 
years 
when 
we 
had 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
might 
make 
us 
inattentive. 
That 
is 
a 
splendid 
idea. 
In 
German 
we 
have 
a 
master, 
in 
French 
I 
am 
sorry 
to 
say 
it's 
still 
Frau 
Doktor 
Dunker, 
whose 
complexion 
has 
not 
improved, 
and 
in 
English 
the 
head 
mistress. 
I 
am 
very 
pleased 
with 
that, 
for 
first 
of 
all 
I 
like 
her 
very 
much, 
and 
secondly 
I 
shall 
be 
in 
her 
good 
books 
from 
the 
start 
because 
Dora 
was 
her 
favourite. 
Of 
course 
I'm 
not 
learning 
Latin, 
for 
it 
would 
not 
interest 
me 
now 
that 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
has 
gone. 
Oh, 
and 
we 
have 
a 
new 
Religion 
teacher, 
for 
Herr 
Professor 
K. 
has 
retired, 
since 
he 
was 
60 
already. 


September 
21st. 
We 
have 
managed 
it. 
In 
the 
long 
interval, 
Hella 
said 
to 
Frau 
Doktor 
St., 
who 
was 
in 
charge. 
"Frau 
Doktor, 
may 
we 
venture 
to 
ask 
for 
something?" 
So 
she 
said: 
"What, 
in 
the 
very 
first 
week; 
well, 
what 
is 
it?" 
We 
said 
we 
should 
like 
to 
move 
from 
the 
third 
bench 
towards 
the 
window, 
for 
we 
found 
it 
very 
painful 
to 
go 
on 
sitting 
where 
we 
had 
sat 
when 
Frau 
Doktor 
M., 
was 
there. 
At 
first 
she 
refused, 
but 
after 
a 
while 
she 
said: 
I'll 
see 
what 
I 
can 
do, 
if 
you 
are 
really 
not 
happy 
where 
you 
are." 
From 
11 
to 
12 
was 
the 
mathematic 
lesson, 
and 
as 
soon 
as 
Frau 
Doktor 
Steiner 
had 
taken 
her 
place 
she 
said: 
"This 
arrangement 
of 
your 
seats 
was 
only 
provisional. 
You 
had 
better 
sit 
more 
according 
to 
height." 
Then 
she 
rearranged 
us 
all, 
and 
Hella 



and 
I 
were 
moved 
to 
the 
5th 
bench 
on 
the 
window 
side; 
the 
two 
twins, 
the 
Ehrenfelds 
got 
our 
places; 
in 
front 
of 
us 
is 
Lohr 
and 
a 
new 
girl 
called 
Friederike 
Hammer 
whose 
father 
is 
a 
confectioner 
in 
Mariahilferstrasse. 
We 
are 
awfully 
glad 
that 
we 
have 
got 
away 
from 
that 
hateful 
third 
bench 
where 
she 
used 
so 
often 
to 
stand 
near 
us 
and 
lay 
her 
hand 
on 
the 
desk. 


September 
29th. 
Professor 
Fritsch, 
the 
German 
professor, 
came 
to-day 
for 
the 
first 
time. 
He 
is 
always 
clearing 
his 
throat 
and 
he 
wears 
gold 
spectacles. 
Hella 
thinks 
him 
tolerably 
nice, 
but 
I 
don't. 
I'm 
quite 
sure 
that 
I 
shall 
never 
get 
an 
Excellent 
in 
German 
again. 
Yesterday 
the 
new 
Religion 
master 
came 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
and 
I 
sat 
alone, 
for 
Hella 
being 
a 
Protestant 
did 
not 
attend. 
He 
looks 
frightfully 
ill 
and 
his 
eyes 
are 
always 
lowered 
though 
he 
has 
burning 
black 
eyes. 
Next 
time 
I 
shall 
sit 
beside 
Hammer 
which 
will 
be 
company 
for 
us 
both. 


October 
2nd. 
We 
had 
confession 
and 
communion 
to-day, 
and 
since 
the 
staff 
will 
not 
allow 
us 
to 
choose 
our 
confessors, 
I 
had 
to 
go 
to 
Professor 
Ruppy. 
I 
did 
hate 
it. 
I 
whispered 
so 
low 
that 
he 
had 
to 
tell 
me 
to 
speak 
louder 
three 
times 
over. 
When 
I 
began 
about 
the 
sixth 
commandment 
he 
covered 
his 
eyes 
with 
his 
hand. 
But 
thank 
goodness 
he 
did 
not 
ask 
any 
questions 
about 
that. 
The 
only 
one 
of 
the 
staff 
who 
used 
to 
allow 
us 
to 
choose 
our 
confessors 
was 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
Really, 
she 
did 
not 
allow 
it 
directly 
but 
when 
one 
ran 
quickly 
to 
another 
confessional 
box, 
she 
pretended 
not 
to 
notice. 
The 
Herr 
Rel. 
Prof 
gives 
frightfully 
long 
penances; 
all 
the 
girls 
who 
went 
to 
him 
took 
a 
tremendous 
time 
to 
get 
through. 
I 
do 
hope 
he 
won't 
be 
so 
strict 
over 
his 
examinations 
or 
I 
shall 
get 
an 
Unsatisfactory; 
that 
would 
be 
awful. 
October 
3rd. 
Father 
was 
so 
splendid 
to-day! 
Aunt 
Dora 
must 
have 
told 
him 
that 
I 
asked 
her 
not 
long 
ago 
whether 
Father 
was 
likely 
to 
marry 
Frau 
Riedl, 
whose 
husband 
died 
almost 
exactly 
the 
same 
time 
as 
Mother, 
for 
Father 
is 
guardian 
to 
her 
three 
children. 
She 
was 
here 
to-day 
with 
Willi, 
because 
he 
has 
just 
begun 
going 
to 
school. 
Dora 
and 
I 
talked 
it 
over, 
and 
she 
said 
that 
if 
Father 
married 
Frau 
R., 
she 
would 
leave 
home. 
In 
the 
evening 
when 
we 
were 
at 
supper, 
I 
said: 
If 
only 
Frau 
v. 
R. 
was 
not 
so 
ugly. 
Father, 
don't 
you 
think 
she's 
perfectly 
hideous? 
And 
Father 
laughed 
so 
lovingly 
and 
said: 
You 
need 
not 
be 
anxious, 
little 
witch, 
I'm 
not 
going 
to 
inflict 
a 
stepmother 
on 
you." 
I 
was 
so 
glad, 
and 
so 
was 
Dora 
and 
we 
kissed 
Father 
such 
a 
lot, 
and 
Dora 
said: 
"I 
felt 
sure 
that 
you 
would 
never 
break 
your 
oath 
to 
Mother," 
and 
she 
burst 
out 



crying. 
And 
Father 
said: 
"No, 
girls, 
I 
did 
not 
give 
any 
promise 
to 
your 
Mother, 
she 
would 
never 
have 
asked 
anything 
of 
the 
kind. 
But 
with 
grown 
girls 
like 
you 
it 
would 
never 
do 
to 
bring 
a 
stepmother 
into 
the 
house." 
And 
then 
I 
told 
Father 
that 
Dora 
would 
have 
gone 
away 
from 
home, 
and 
as 
for 
me, 
I 
should 
certainly 
have 
been 
frightfully 
upset. 
For 
if 
Father 
really 
wanted 
to 
marry 
again 
I 
should 
have 
to 
put 
up 
with 
it; 
and 
so 
would 
Dora. 
But 
Father 
said 
once 
more: 
Don't 
worry, 
I 
certainly 
shan't 
marry 
again." 
And 
I 
said: 
"Not 
even 
Aunt 
Dora?" 
And 
he 
said: 
"Oh, 
as 
for 
her 
----" 
And 
then 
he 
pulled 
himself 
up 
and 
said: 
"No, 
no, 
not 
even 
Aunt 
Dora." 
Dora 
has 
just 
told 
me 
that 
I 
am 
a 
perfect 
idiot, 
for 
surely 
I 
must 
know 
that 
Father 
is 
not 
particularly 
charmed 
by 
Aunt. 
And 
then 
she 
blamed 
me 
for 
having 
told 
Father 
that 
she 
would 
leave 
home 
if 
he 
were 
to 
marry 
again. 
I 
am 
a 
child 
to 
whom 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
entrust 
any 
secrets!! 
Now 
we 
have 
been 
quarrelling 
for 
at 
least 
three 
quarters 
of 
an 
hour, 
so 
it 
is 
already 
half 
past 
11. 
Luckily 
to-morrow 
is 
a 
holiday, 
because 
of 
the 
Emperor's 
birthday. 
But 
I 
am 
so 
glad 
to 
know 
for 
certain 
that 
Father 
is 
not 
going 
to 
marry 
Frau 
v. 
R 
I 
could 
never 
get 
on 
with 
a 
stepmother. 


October 
9th. 
It's 
horribly 
difficult 
in 
German 
this 
year. 
In 
composition 
we 
are 
not 
allowed 
to 
make 
any 
rough 
notes, 
we 
have 
to 
write 
it 
straight 
off 
and 
then 
hand 
it 
in. 
I 
simply 
can't. 
Professor 
Fritsch 
is 
very 
handsome, 
but 
the 
girls 
are 
terribly 
afraid 
of 
him 
for 
he 
is 
so 
strict. 
His 
wife 
is 
in 
an 
asylum 
and 
his 
children 
live 
with 
his 
mother. 
He 
has 
got 
a 
divorce 
from 
his 
wife, 
and 
since 
he 
has 
the 
luck 
to 
be 
a 
Protestant 
he 
can 
marry 
again 
if 
he 
wants 
to. 
Hella 
is 
perfectly 
fascinated 
by 
him, 
but 
I'm 
not 
in 
the 
least. 
For 
I 
always 
think 
of 
Prof. 
W. 
in 
the 
Second, 
and 
that's 
enough 
for 
me. 
I'm 
not 
going 
to 
fall 
in 
love 
with 
any 
more 
professors. 
In 
the 
Training 
College, 
where 
Marina 
is 
now, 
in 
her 
fourth 
year 
one 
of 
the 
professors 
last 
year 
married 
a 
former 
pupil. 
I 
would 
not 
do 
that 
at 
any 
price, 
marry 
a 
former 
professor,: 
who 
knows 
all 
one's 
faults. 
Besides, 
he 
must 
be 
at 
least 
12 
or 
20 
years 
older 
than 
the 
girl; 
and 
that's 
perfectly 
horrible, 
one 
might 
as 
well 
marry 
one's 
father; 
he 
would 
be 
at 
least 
fond 
of 
her, 
and 
she 
would 
at 
least 
know 
the 
way 
he 
likes 
to 
have 
everything 
done; 
but 
to 
marry 
one's 
former 
professor, 
what 
an 
extraordinary 
thing 
to 
do! 


October 
15th. 
I'm 
frightfully 
anxious 
that 
Hella 
may 
have 
a 
relapse; 
she 
says 
that 
nothing 
would 
induce 
her 
to 
have 
a 
second 
operation, 
especially 
now 
that 



------; 
she 
says 
she 
would 
rather 
die. 
That 
would 
be 
awful! 
I 
did 
my 
best 
to 
persuade 
her 
to 
tell 
her 
mother 
that 
she 
has 
such 
pain; 
but 
she 
won't. 


October 
19th. 
In 
November, 
Hella's 
father 
will 
be 
made 
a 
general 
and 
will 
be 
stationed 
in 
Cracow. 
Thank 
goodness 
she 
is 
going 
to 
stay 
here 
with 
her 
grandmother 
until 
she 
leaves 
the 
Lyz. 
She 
will 
only 
go 
to 
Cracow 
at 
Christmas 
and 
Easter 
and 
in 
the 
summer 
holidays. 
She 
is 
frantically 
delighted. 
The 
good 
news 
has 
made 
her 
quite 
well 
again. 
Everyone 
at 
school 
is 
very 
proud 
that 
there 
will 
be 
a 
general's 
daughter 
in 
our 
class. 
It's 
true 
that 
there 
is 
a 
field-marshal's 
daughter 
in 
the 
Third, 
but 
he 
is 
retired. 
Father 
always 
says: 
Nobody 
makes 
any 
fuss 
over 
a 
retired 
officer. 


October 
22nd. 
We 
are 
so 
much 
excited 
that 
we've 
hardly 
any 
time 
to 
learn 
our 
lessons. 
At 
Christmas 
last 
year 
some 
one 
gave 
Hella's 
mother 
several 
of 
Geierstamm's 
novels. 
The 
other 
day 
one 
of 
them 
was 
lying 
on 
the 
table, 
and 
when 
her 
mother 
was 
out 
Hella 
had 
a 
hurried 
look 
at 
it 
and 
read 
the 
title 
The 
Power 
of 
Woman!!! 
When 
her 
mother 
had 
finished 
it, 
she 
watched 
to 
see 
where 
it 
was 
put 
in 
the 
bookcase, 
and 
now 
we 
are 
reading 
it. 
It's 
simply 
wonderful! 
It 
keeps 
me 
awake 
all 
night; 
Signe 
whom 
he 
is 
so 
passionately 
fond 
of 
and 
who 
deceives 
him. 
We 
cried 
so 
much 
that 
we 
could 
not 
go 
on 
reading. 
And 
Gretchen, 
the 
girl, 
to 
whom 
her 
father 
is 
everything; 
I 
can 
understand 
so 
well 
that 
she 
is 
always 
anxious 
lest 
her 
father 
should 
marry 
that 
horrid 
Frau 
Elise, 
although 
she 
has 
a 
husband 
already. 
And 
when 
she 
dies, 
oh, 
it's 
so 
horrible 
and 
so 
beautiful 
that 
we 
read 
it 
over 
three 
times 
in 
succession. 
The 
other 
day 
my 
eyes 
were 
quite 
red 
from 
crying, 
and 
Aunt 
said 
I 
must 
be 
working 
too 
hard; 
for 
she 
thinks 
that 
Hella 
and 
I 
are 
studying 
literature 
together. 
Oh 
dear, 
lessons 
are 
an 
awful 
nuisance 
when 
one 
has 
such 
books 
to 
read. 


October 
24th. 
When 
I 
look 
at 
Father 
I 
always 
think 
of 
the 
novel 
The 
Power 
of 
Woman; 
of 
course 
leaving 
Signe 
out 
of 
account. 
Hella 
hopes 
she'll 
be 
able 
to 
get 
hold 
of 
some 
other 
book, 
but 
it's 
not 
so 
easy 
to 
do 
without 
her 
mother 
finding 
it 
out, 
for 
she 
often 
lends 
books 
to 
her 
friends. 
Then 
there 
would 
be 
an 
awful 
row. 
We 
certainly 
don't 
want 
to 
read 
The 
Little 
Brother's 
Book, 
the 
title 
does 
not 
attract 
us; 
but 
there's 
a 
novel 
called 
The 
Comedy 
of 
Marriage, 
it 
must 
be 
splendid; 
we 
must 
get 
that 
whatever 
happens. 


October 
26th. 
The 
Bruckners 
are 
going 
to 
keep 
on 
their 
flat, 
and 
Hella's 



grandmother 
will 
come 
and 
live 
there; 
only 
the 
Herr 
General!!! 
is 
going 
to 
C., 
and 
of 
course 
Hella's 
mother 
too. 
Lizzi 
will 
stay, 
for 
she 
is 
taking 
cooking 
lessons, 
since 
she 
is 
to 
be 
married 
in 
Mid-Lent. 


October 
31st. 
Hella's 
parents 
left 
to-day, 
she 
cried 
frightfully, 
for 
she 
did 
so 
want 
to 
go 
with 
them. 
Lizzi 
was 
quite 
unconcerned, 
for 
she 
is 
engaged 
already, 
and 
the 
Baron, 
her 
fiance, 
is 
coming 
at 
Christmas, 
either 
to 
Vienna 
or 
Cracow; 
he 
does 
not 
care 
which. 


November 
4th. 
Some 
of 
the 
girls 
in 
our 
class 
were 
furious 
in 
the 
German 
lesson 
to-day. 
One 
or 
two 
of 
the 
girls 
did 
not 
know 
the 
proper 
places 
for 
commas, 
and 
Prof. 
Fritsch 
hinted 
that 
we 
had 
learned 
nothing 
at 
all 
in 
previous 
years. 
We 
understood 
perfectly 
well 
that 
he 
was 
aiming 
at 
Frau 
Doktor 
M., 
whose 
German 
lessons 
were 
10 
times 
or 
rather 
100 
times 
better 
than 
Professor 
F.'s. 
And 
on 
this 
very 
matter 
of 
punctuation 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
took 
a 
tremendous 
lot 
of 
trouble 
and 
gave 
us 
lots 
of 
examples. 
Besides, 
whether 
one 
has 
a 
good 
style 
or 
not 
does 
not 
depend 
upon 
whether 
one 
puts 
a 
comma 
in 
the 
right 
place. 
The 
two 
Ehrenfelds, 
who 
towards 
the 
end 
were 
awfully 
fond 
of 
Frau 
Doktor 
M., 
say 
that 
we, 
who 
were 
Frau 
Doktor 
M.'s 
favourites, 
ought 
to 
write 
a 
composition 
without 
a 
single 
comma, 
just 
to 
show 
him. 
That's 
a 
splendid 
idea, 
and 
Hella 
and 
I 
will 
do 
it 
like 
a 
shot 
if 
only 
the 
others 
can 
be 
trusted 
to 
do 
it 
too. 


November 
6th. 
This 
year 
all 
the 
classes 
must 
have 
at 
least 
two 
outings 
every 
month, 
even 
in 
winter. 
If 
that 
had 
been 
decided 
in 
the 
last 
school 
year, 
when 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
was 
still 
there, 
I 
should 
certainly 
have 
gone 
every 
time. 
But 
this 
year, 
when 
she 
has 
left, 
we 
can't 
enjoy 
it. 
Frau 
Doktor 
St. 
is 
awfully 
nice, 
but 
not 
like 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
Besides, 
we 
go 
somewhere 
with 
Father 
every 
Sunday, 
Hella 
comes 
with 
us, 
and 
Lizzi 
if 
she 
likes. 
As 
soon 
as 
the 
snow 
comes 
we 
are 
going 
to 
have 
tobogganing 
parties 
at 
Hainfeld 
or 
Lilienfeld. 


December 
3rd. 
Nearly 
a 
whole 
month 
has 
passed 
without 
my 
writing, 
but 
I 
must 
write 
to-day! 
There's 
been 
such 
a 
row 
in 
the 
German 
lesson!! 
We 
got 
back 
the 
compositions 
in 
which 
Hella 
and 
I, 
the 
2 
Ehrenfelds, 
Brauner, 
Edith 
Bergler, 
and 
Kuhnelt, 
had 
not 
put 
a 
single 
comma. 
Nothing 
would 
have 
been 
found 
out 
had 
not 
that 
idiot 
Brauner 
put 
in 
commas 
first 
and 
then 
scratched 
them 
out. 
We 
had 
agreed 
that 
if 
the 
Prof. 
noticed 
anything 
we 
would 
say 
we 
had 
meant 
to 
go 
through 
them 
together 
before 
the 
lesson, 
and 
to 
decide 
where 



to 
put 
in 
commas, 
but 
that 
we 
had 
had 
no 
time. 
Now 
the 
silly 
fool 
has 
given 
away 
the 
whole 
show. 
He 
is 
going 
to 
bring 
the 
matter 
before 
the 
staff 
meeting. 
But 
after 
all, 
it's 
simply 
impossible 
to 
give 
6 
girls 
out 
of 
25 
a 
bad 
conduct 
mark. 


December 
4th. 
The 
head 
mistress 
came 
to 
inspect 
the 
German 
lesson 
to-day. 
Afterwards 
she 
said 
that 
she 
expected 
us 
to 
make 
all 
the 
knowledge 
which 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
had 
instilled 
into 
us 
for 
3 
years, 
the 
firm 
foundation 
of 
our 
further 
development 
in 
the 
higher 
classes. 
In 
the 
English 
lesson 
she 
referred 
to 
the 
more 
restricted 
use 
of 
punctuation 
marks 
in 
English; 
and 
afterwards 
we 
6 
sinners 
were 
summoned 
to 
the 
office. 
The 
whole 
school 
knew 
about 
the 
trouble 
and 
was 
astonished 
at 
our 
courage, 
especially 
the 
lower 
classes; 
the 
Fifth 
and 
the 
Sixth 
were 
rather 
annoyed 
that 
we 
in 
the 
Fourth 
had 
dared 
to 
do 
it. 
The 
head 
gave 
us 
a 
terrible 
scolding, 
saying 
that 
it 
was 
an 
unexampled 
piece 
of 
impudence, 
and 
that 
we 
were 
not 
doing 
credit 
to 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
Then 
Hella 
said 
very 
modestly: 
"Frau 
Direktorin, 
will 
you 
please 
allow 
me 
to 
say 
a 
word 
in 
our 
defence?" 
Then 
she 
explained 
that 
Prof. 
Fritsch 
never 
missed 
a 
chance 
of 
casting 
a 
slur 
upon 
Frau 
Doktor 
M., 
not 
in 
plain 
words 
of 
course, 
but 
so 
that 
we 
could 
not 
fail 
to 
understand 
it, 
and 
that 
was 
why 
we 
acted 
as 
we 
did. 
The 
head 
answered 
we 
must 
certainly 
be 
mistaken, 
that 
no 
member 
of 
the 
staff 
could 
ever 
speak 
against 
another 
in 
such 
a 
way 
we 
had 
simply 
misunderstood 
Prof 
Fritsch! 
But 
we 
know 
perfectly 
well 
how 
often 
the 
Nutling 
used 
to 
say 
in 
the 
Maths 
lesson: 
"Don't 
you 
know 
that? 
Surely 
you 
must 
have 
been 
taught 
that." 
The 
emphasis 
does 
it!!!!! 
The 
staff 
meeting 
is 
to-morrow, 
and 
we 
were 
told 
to 
do 
our 
best 
to 
make 
amends 
before 
the 
meeting. 
The 
2 
Ehrenfelds 
suggested 
that 
we 
should 
write 
the 
compositions 
over 
again, 
of 
course 
with 
all 
the 
commas, 
and 
should 
place 
them 
on 
his 
desk 
to-morrow 
morning 
before 
the 
German 
lesson; 
but 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
us 
were 
against 
this, 
for 
we 
saw 
plainly 
that 
the 
head 
had 
changed 
colour 
when 
Hella 
said 
what 
she 
did. 
We 
shall 
make 
the 
corrections 
and 
then 
we 
shall 
all 
begin 
new 
copybooks. 


December 
8th. 
It 
is 
3 
days 
now 
since 
the 
staff 
meeting, 
but 
not 
a 
word 
has 
been 
said 
yet 
about 
our 
affair, 
and 
in 
the 
German 
lesson 
yesterday 
the 
Prof. 
gave 
out 
the 
subject 
for 
the 
third 
piece 
of 
home 
work 
without 
saying 
anything 
in 
particular. 
I 
think 
he 
is 
afraid 
to. 
Hella 
has 
saved 
us 
all, 
for 
everyone 
else 
would 
have 
been 
afraid 
to 
say 
what 
she 
did, 
even 
I. 
Hella 
said: 
"My 
dear 



Rita, 
I'm 
not 
an 
officer's 
daughter 
for 
nothing; 
if 
I 
have 
not 
courage, 
who 
should 
have? 
The 
girls 
stare 
at 
us 
in 
the 
interval 
and 
whenever 
they 
meet 
us, 
though 
in 
the 
office 
the 
head 
said 
to 
us: 
"I 
do 
hope 
that 
this 
business 
will 
not 
be 
spread 
all 
over 
the 
school." 
But 
Brauner 
has 
a 
sister 
in 
the 
Second 
and 
Edith 
Bergler's 
sister 
is 
in 
the 
Fifth 
and 
through 
them 
all 
the 
classes 
have 
heard 
about 
it. 
I 
suppose 
nothing 
is 
going 
to 
be 
said 
to 
our 
parents 
or 
something 
would 
have 
happened 
already. 
Besides, 
to 
be 
on 
the 
safe 
side, 
I 
have 
already 
dropped 
a 
few 
hints 
at 
home. 
And 
since 
Dora, 
thank 
goodness, 
is 
no 
longer 
at 
the 
school, 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
there 
can 
be 
much 
fuss. 
It 
was 
only 
at 
first 
that 
we 
were 
alarmed, 
but 
Hella 
was 
quite 
right 
when 
she 
said: 
"I'm 
sure 
nothing 
will 
happen 
to 
us, 
for 
we 
are 
in 
the 
right." 


December 
15th. 
A 
meeting 
with 
Viktor!!! 
Dora 
and 
I 
had 
gone 
to 
do 
our 
Christmas 
shopping, 
and 
we 
came 
across 
him 
just 
as 
we 
had 
turned 
into 
Tuchlauben. 
Dora 
got 
fiery 
red, 
and 
both 
their 
voices 
trembled. 
He 
does 
look 
fine, 
with 
his 
black 
moustache 
and 
his 
flashing 
eyes! 
And 
the 
green 
facings 
on 
his 
tunic 
suit 
him 
splendidly. 
He 
cleared 
his 
throat 
quickly 
to 
cover 
his 
embarrassment, 
and 
walked 
with 
us 
as 
far 
as 
the 
Upper 
Market-place; 
he 
has 
another 
six-months 
furlough 
because 
of 
throat 
trouble; 
so 
Dora 
can 
be 
quite 
easy 
in 
her 
mind 
in 
case 
she 
fancied 
that 
----------. 
When 
he 
said 
goodbye 
he 
kissed 
our 
hands, 
mine 
as 
well 
as 
Dora's, 
and 
smiled 
so 
sweetly, 
sadly 
and 
sweetly 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
Several 
times 
I 
wanted 
to 
turn 
the 
conversation 
upon 
him. 
But 
when 
Dora 
does 
not 
want 
a 
thing, 
you 
can 
do 
what 
you 
like 
and 
she 
won't 
budge; 
she's 
as 
obstinate 
as 
a 
mule! 
She's 
always 
been 
like 
that 
since 
she 
was 
quite 
a 
little 
girl, 
when 
she 
used 
to 
say: 
Dor 
not! 
That 
meant: 
Dora 
won't; 
little 
wretch! 
such 
a 
wilful 
little 
beast! 


December 
17th. 
Yesterday 
we 
had 
our 
first 
tobogganing 
party 
on 
the 
Anninger; 
it 
was 
glorious, 
we 
kept 
on 
tumbling 
into 
the 
snow; 
the 
snow 
lay 
fairly 
thick, 
especially 
up 
there, 
where 
hardly 
anyone 
comes. 
As 
we 
were 
going 
home 
such 
a 
ridiculous 
thing 
happened 
to 
Hella; 
she 
caught 
her 
foot 
on 
a 
snag 
and 
tore 
off 
the 
whole 
sole 
of 
a 
brand 
new 
shoe. 
She 
had 
to 
tie 
it 
on 
with 
a 
string, 
and 
even 
then 
she 
limped 
so 
badly 
that 
every 
one 
believed 
she 
had 
sprained 
her 
ankle 
tobogganing. 
Her 
grandmother 
was 
frightfully 
angry 
and 
said: 
"That 
comes 
of 
such 
unladylike 
amusements!" 
Aunt 
Dora 
was 
very 
much 
upset, 
for 
she 
had 
been 
with 
us, 
but 
Father 
said: 
Hella's 
grandmother 
is 
quite 
an 
old 
lady, 
and 
in 
her 
day 
people 
had 
very 
different 
views 
in 
this 



respect. 
I 
should 
say 
so, 
in 
this 
respect, 
Hella 
finds 
it 
out 
a 
dozen 
times 
a 
day, 
all 
the 
things 
she 
must 
not 
say 
and 
must 
not 
do, 
and 
all 
the 
things 
which 
are 
unsuitable 
for 
young 
girls! 
Her 
grandmother 
would 
like 
to 
keep 
her 
under 
a 
glass 
shade; 
but 
not 
a 
transparent 
one, 
for 
she 
must 
not 
be 
able 
to 
see 
out, 
and 
no 
one 
must 
be 
able 
to 
see 
in. 
(The 
last 
is 
the 
main 
point.) 


December 
20th. 
To-day 
was 
the 
last 
German 
lesson 
before 
Christmas, 
and 
not 
a 
word 
more 
has 
been 
said 
about 
our 
affair. 
Hella 
has 
proved 
splendidly 
right. 
Even 
Verbenowitsch, 
who 
curries 
favour 
with 
every 
member 
of 
the 
staff, 
has 
congratulated 
her, 
and 
so 
has 
Hammer, 
who 
is 
a 
newcomer 
and 
did 
not 
know 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
By 
the 
way, 
at 
1 
o'clock 
the 
other 
day 
we 
met 
Franke; 
she 
goes 
now 
to 
a 
school 
of 
dramatic 
art, 
and 
says 
that 
the 
whole 
tone 
of 
the 
place 
is 
utterly 
different, 
she 
is 
so 
glad 
to 
have 
done 
with 
the 
High 
School. 
She 
had 
heard 
of 
the 
affair 
with 
Prof. 
F. 
and 
she 
congratulated 
us 
upon 
our 
strength 
of 
character, 
especially 
Hella 
of 
course. 
She 
says 
that 
the 
matter 
is 
common 
talk 
in 
all 
the 
High 
Schools 
of 
Vienna, 
at 
least 
she 
heard 
of 
it 
from 
a 
girl 
at 
the 
High 
School 
for 
the 
Daughters 
of 
Civil 
Servants, 
a 
girl 
whose 
sister 
is 
at 
the 
School 
of 
Dramatic 
Art. 
She 
is 
very 
happy 
there, 
but 
she 
is 
annoyed 
that 
such 
an 
institution 
should 
still 
be 
called 
a 
school; 
it's 
not 
a 
school 
in 
the 
least; 
we 
would 
be 
astonished 
to 
see 
how 
free 
they 
all 
are. 
She 
is 
very 
pretty 
and 
has 
even 
more 
figure 
than 
she 
used 
to 
have. 
She 
speaks 
very 
prettily 
too, 
but 
rather 
too 
loudly, 
so 
that 
everyone 
turned 
round 
to 
look 
at 
us. 
She 
hopes 
that 
she 
will 
be 
able 
to 
invite 
us 
to 
see 
her 
debut 
in 
one 
year!!! 
I 
should 
never 
be 
able 
to 
stand 
on 
a 
stage 
before 
a 
lot 
of 
strangers, 
I 
know 
I 
would 
never 
be 
able 
to 
get 
a 
word 
out. 


December 
21st. 
Hella 
is 
awfully 
unlucky. 
The 
day 
before 
yesterday 
she 
got 
such 
bad 
influenza 
and 
sore 
throat 
that 
she 
can't 
go 
to 
Cracow. 
She 
says 
she 
is 
born 
to 
ill 
luck; 
this 
is 
the 
second 
Christmas 
that 
has 
been 
spoiled, 
two 
years 
ago 
the 
appendicitis 
operation, 
and 
now 
this 
wretched 
influenza. 
She 
hopes 
her 
mother 
will 
come 
to 
Vienna, 
but 
if 
so 
her 
father 
will 
be 
left 
quite 
alone. 
And 
how 
on 
earth 
shall 
we 
get 
on, 
Christmas 
without 
Mother, 
the 
first 
Christmas 
without 
Mother. 
I 
simply 
don't 
dare 
to 
think 
of 
it, 
for 
if 
I 
did 
it 
would 
make 
me 
cry. 
Dora 
says 
too 
that 
it 
can't 
be 
a 
proper 
Christmas 
without 
Mother. 
I 
wonder 
what 
Father 
will 
say 
when 
he 
sees 
Mother's 
portrait. 
I 
do 
hope 
the 
frame 
will 
be 
ready 
to-morrow. 
Hella 
is 
especially 
unhappy 
because 
she 
is 
not 
able 
to 
see 
Lajos. 
Besides, 
she 
is 
madly 
in 
love 
at 
the 
same 
time 



with 
a 
lieutenant 
of 
dragoons 
whom 
we 
meet 
every 
day 
and 
who 
is 
a 
count, 
and 
he 
is 
madly 
in 
love 
with 
her. 
He 
knows 
that 
her 
father 
is 
a 
general, 
for 
when 
her 
father 
went 
to 
kiss 
the 
Emperor's 
hand 
he 
took 
Hella 
part 
of 
the 
way 
with 
him 
in 
the 
motor, 
and 
she 
was 
introduced 
to 
the 
lieutenant 
then. 
So 
now 
he 
salutes 
her 
when 
they 
meet. 
He 
is 
tremendously 
tall 
and 
looks 
fearfully 
aristocratic. 
But 
what 
annoys 
me 
with 
Hella 
is 
that 
she 
invariably 
denies 
it 
when 
she 
is 
in 
love 
with 
anyone. 
I 
always 
tell 
her, 
or 
if 
she 
notices 
anything 
I 
don't 
deny 
it. 
What's 
the 
sense 
of 
it 
between 
friends? 
for 
example, 
the 
year 
before 
last 
she 
was 
certainly 
in 
love 
with 
the 
young 
doctor 
in 
the 
hospital. 
And 
in 
September 
when 
we 
came 
back 
from 
Theben 
with 
that 
magnificent 
lieutenant 
in 
the 
flying 
corps, 
I 
made 
no 
secret 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
I 
was 
frantically 
in 
love 
with 
him. 
But 
she 
did 
not 
believe 
me, 
and 
said: 
That 
is 
not 
real 
love, 
when 
people 
don't 
see 
one 
another 
for 
months 
and 
flirt 
with 
others 
between 
whiles. 
That 
was 
aimed 
at 
Hero 
Siegfried. 
Goodness 
me, 
at 
him!! 
it's 
really 
too 
absurd. 


December 
22nd. 
I 
am 
so 
delighted, 
Frau 
Doktor 
M., 
at 
least 
she 
is 
Frau 
Professor 
Theyer 
now, 
has 
written 
to 
me. 
I 
had 
sent 
her 
Christmas 
good 
wishes, 
and 
she 
sent 
a 
line 
to 
thank 
me, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
she 
wished 
me 
a 
happy 
New 
Year, 
she 
took 
the 
lead 
in 
this; 
it 
was 
heavenly. 
I 
was 
frightfully 
annoyed 
because 
Dora 
said 
that 
she 
had 
done 
it 
only 
to 
save 
herself 
the 
trouble 
of 
writing 
again; 
I'm 
sure 
that's 
not 
true. 
Dora 
always 
says 
things 
like 
that 
simply 
to 
annoy 
me. 
But 
her 
sweet, 
her 
divine 
letter, 
I 
carry 
it 
about 
with 
me 
wherever 
I 
go, 
and 
her 
photograph 
too. 
She 
sent 
Hella 
only 
a 
card, 
naturally, 
for 
that 
was 
all 
Hella 
had 
sent 
her. 
I 
can 
quite 
well 
fancy 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
as 
a 
stepmother, 
that 
is, 
not 
quite 
well, 
but 
better 
than 
anyone 
else. 
She 
wrote 
so 
sweetly 
about 
Mother, 
saying 
that 
of 
course 
I 
should 
find 
this 
Christmas 
less 
happy 
than 
usual. 
She 
is 
certainly 
right 
there. 
We 
can 
none 
of 
us 
feel 
as 
if 
the 
day 
after 
to-morrow 
is 
to 
be 
Christmas 
Eve. 
The 
only 
thing 
that 
I 
really 
enjoy 
thinking 
of 
is 
the 
way 
Father 
will 
stare 
when 
he 
sees 
the 
portrait. 
But 
really 
in 
the 
first 
years 
after 
such 
a 
loss 
one 
ought 
not 
to 
keep 
Christmas, 
for 
on 
such 
days 
one 
feels 
one's 
sadness 
more 
than 
ever. 


December 
23rd. 
I 
have 
still 
a 
frightful 
lot 
to 
do 
for 
Christmas, 
but 
I 
must 
write 
to-day. 
There 
was 
a 
ring 
at 
the 
front 
door 
this 
morning 
at 
about 
half 
past 
11. 
I 
thought 
it 
must 
be 
Hella 
come 
to 
fetch 
me, 
that 
she 
must 
be 
all 
right 
again, 
so 
I 
rushed 
out, 
tore 
the 
door 
open, 
prepared 
to 
greet 
Hella, 
and 
then 
I 



was 
simply 
kerblunxed, 
for 
there 
was 
a 
gentleman 
standing 
who 
asked 
most 
politely: 
Is 
anyone 
at 
home? 
I 
knew 
him 
in 
a 
moment, 
it 
was 
that 
Dr. 
Pruckmuller 
from 
Fieberbr. 
Meanwhile 
Dora 
had 
opened 
the 
drawing-room 
door, 
and 
now 
came 
the 
great 
proof 
of 
deceitfulness: 
She 
was 
not 
in 
the 
least 
surprised, 
but 
said: 
"Ah, 
Dr. 
Pruckmuller, 
I 
am 
so 
glad 
you 
have 
kept 
your 
word." 
So 
it 
was 
plain 
that 
he 
had 
promised 
her 
to 
come, 
and 
I 
am 
practically 
sure 
she 
knew 
he 
was 
coming 
to-day, 
for 
she 
was 
wearing 
her 
best 
black 
silk 
apron 
with 
the 
insertions, 
such 
as 
we 
only 
wear 
when 
visitors 
are 
expected. 
What 
a 
humbug 
she 
is! 
So 
I 
went 
into 
the 
drawing-room 
too. 
Then 
Aunt 
Dora 
came 
in 
and 
asked 
him 
to 
supper 
this 
evening. 
Then 
he 
went 
away. 
All 
the 
time 
he 
had 
not 
said 
a 
word 
to 
me, 
it 
seemed 
as 
if 
he 
had 
not 
even 
noticed 
that 
there 
was 
such 
a 
person 
as 
me 
in 
the 
world 
Not 
until 
he 
was 
actually 
leaving 
did 
he 
say: 
"Well; 
Fraulein, 
how 
are 
you?" 
"Oh 
well," 
said 
I, 
"I'm 
much 
as 
anyone 
can 
expect 
to 
be 
so 
soon 
after 
Mother's 
death." 
Dora 
got 
as 
red 
as 
fire, 
for 
she 
understood. 
I 
shall 
know 
how 
to 
treat 
him 
if 
he 
becomes 
my 
brother-in-law. 
But 
that 
may 
be 
a 
long 
way 
off; 
for 
he 
lives 
in 
Innsbruck, 
and 
Father 
is 
not 
likely 
to 
allow 
Dora 
to 
marry 
away 
to 
Innsbruck. 
At 
dinner 
I 
hardly 
said 
a 
word, 
I 
was 
so 
enraged 
at 
this 
deceitfulness. 
But 
there 
is 
more 
to 
come. 
At 
7, 
or 
whatever 
time 
it 
was, 
Dr. 
Pruckmuller 
turned 
up. 
Dora 
appeared 
in 
a 
white 
blouse 
with 
a 
black 
bow, 
and 
had 
remained 
in 
her 
room 
till 
the 
last 
minute 
so 
that 
I 
might 
not 
know 
what 
she 
was 
wearing. 
For 
I 
had 
believed 
she 
would 
wear 
her 
black 
dress 
with 
the 
insertions, 
and 
so 
I 
was 
wearing 
mine. 
Oh 
well, 
that 
did 
not 
matter. 
At 
supper 
he 
talked 
all 
the 
time 
to 
Dora, 
so 
I 
purposely 
talked 
to 
Oswald. 
Then 
he 
said 
that 
on 
March 
1st 
he 
was 
going 
to 
be 
transferred 
to 
Vienna. 
Once 
more 
Dora 
was 
not 
in 
the 
least 
astonished, 
so 
she 
must 
have 
known 
all 
about 
it! 
But 
now 
I 
remember 
quite 
well 
that 
in 
October 
the 
postman 
handed 
me 
a 
letter 
for 
her 
with 
the 
Innsbruck 
postmark. 
So 
she 
was 
corresponding 
with 
him 
openly 
the 
whole 
time, 
less 
than 
6 
months 
after 
Mother's 
death. 
It 
really 
is 
too 
bad! 
But 
when 
I 
was 
chattering 
about 
the 
country, 
she 
kicked 
me 
under 
the 
table 
as 
a 
hint 
not 
to 
laugh 
so 
frightfully. 
And 
when 
my 
brother-in-law 
in 
spe, 
oh 
how 
it 
does 
make 
me 
laugh, 
two 
or 
three 
years 
ago, 
in 
Goisern 
I 
think 
it 
was, 
we 
used 
to 
call 
Dora 
Inspe, 
because 
she 
had 
said 
of 
Robert 
Warth 
and 
me: 
The 
bridal 
pair 
in 
spe! 
And 
now 
she 
is 
in 
the 
same 
position. 
When 
he 
went 
away 
in 
the 
evening 
I 
was 
trembling 
lest 
Father 
should 
invite 
him 
to 
the 
Christmas 
tree, 
but 
thank 
goodness 
when 
Father 
asked: 
"What 
are 
you 
doing 
with 
yourself 
to-morrow," 
he 
answered: 
"To-morrow 
I 
am 
spending 
the 
day 
with 
my 



sister's 
family, 
she 
is 
married 
to 
a 
captain 
out 
Wieden 
way." 
Thank 
goodness 
that 
came 
to 
nothing, 
for 
we 
are 
not 
at 
all 
in 
the 
mood 
for 
visitors, 
especially 
the 
first 
Christmas 
without 
Mother. 
And 
if 
she 
knew 
------I 
wish 
I 
knew 
what 
really 
happens 
to 
the 
soul. 
Of 
course 
I 
gave 
up 
believing 
in 
Heaven 
long 
ago; 
but 
the 
soul 
must 
go 
somewhere. 
There 
are 
so 
many 
riddles, 
and 
they 
make 
one 
so 
unhappy; 
in 
a 
newspaper 
feuilleton 
the 
other 
day 
I 
saw 
the 
title 
of 
a 
chapter: 
The 
Riddle 
of 
Love. 
But 
this 
riddle 
does 
not 
make 
people 
sad, 
as 
one 
can 
see 
by 
Dora. 
Anyhow, 
all 
girls, 
that 
is 
all 
elder 
sisters, 
seem 
alike 
in 
this 
respect. 
I 
remember 
what 
Hella 
told 
me 
about 
Lizzi's 
engagement. 
It 
is 
true, 
she 
had 
first 
made 
his 
acquaintance 
in 
London, 
not 
at 
home; 
but 
there 
was 
just 
the 
same 
deceitfulness. 
What 
on 
earth 
does 
it 
mean? 
Would 
it 
not 
be 
much 
more 
kindly 
and 
reasonable 
to 
tell 
your 
sister 
everything? 
Otherwise 
how 
can 
anyone 
expect 
one 
to 
be 
an 
ally. 
Oh 
well, 
I 
don't 
care, 
I'm 
not 
going 
to 
let 
my 
Christmas 
Eve 
be 
disturbed 
by 
a 
thing 
like 
that; 
if 
one 
can 
call 
it 
a 
Christmas 
Eve 
at 
all. 
On 
Boxing 
Day, 
when 
he 
is 
to 
spend 
the 
evening 
here, 
I 
shall 
tell 
Hella 
that 
I 
want 
to 
come 
to 
her 
and 
her 
grandmother. 
After 
all, 
I 
am 
glad 
she 
has 
stayed 
in 
Vienna. 


December 
25th. 
Christmas 
Eve 
was 
very 
melancholy. 
We 
all 
three 
got 
Mother's 
picture, 
life 
size 
in 
beautiful 
green 
frames, 
for 
our 
rooms. 
Dora 
sobbed 
out 
loud, 
and 
so 
I 
cried 
too 
and 
went 
up 
to 
Father 
and 
put 
my 
arms 
around 
him. 
His 
eyes 
were 
quite 
wet; 
for 
he 
adored 
Mother. 
Only 
Oswald 
did 
not 
actually 
cry, 
but 
he 
kept 
on 
biting 
his 
lips. 
I 
was 
so 
glad 
that 
Dr. 
P. 
was 
not 
there, 
for 
it 
is 
horribly 
disagreeable 
to 
cry 
before 
strangers. 
We 
both 
got 
lovely 
white 
guipure 
blouses, 
not 
lace 
blouses, 
then 
Aunt 
gave 
me 
a 
splendid 
album 
for 
500 
postcards, 
and 
she 
also 
gave 
me 
an 
anthology 
which 
I 
had 
asked 
for. 
Brahms' 
Hungarian 
Dances, 
because 
Dora 
would 
not 
lend 
me 
hers 
last 
year 
because 
she 
said 
they 
were 
too 
difficult 
for 
me; 
as 
if 
that 
were 
any 
business 
of 
hers; 
surely 
my 
music 
mistress 
is 
a 
better 
judge; 
then 
some 
writing 
paper 
with 
my 
monogram, 
a 
new 
en-tout-cas 
with 
everything 
complete, 
and 
hair 
ribbons 
and 
other 
trifles. 
Father 
was 
awfully 
delighted 
with 
Mother's 
portrait; 
of 
course 
we 
had 
not 
known 
that 
he 
was 
getting 
us 
life-size 
portraits 
of 
Mother, 
and 
from 
the 
last 
photograph 
of 
the 
winter 
before 
last 
we 
had 
quite 
a 
small 
likeness 
painted 
by 
Herr 
Milanowitz, 
who 
is 
a 
painter, 
and 
who 
knew 
Mother 
very 
well--in 
colour 
of 
course. 
And 
we 
got 
a 
lovely 
rococo 
frame 
to 
close 
up; 
when 
it 
is 
open 
it 
looks 
as 
if 
Mother 
were 
looking 
out 
of 
the 
window. 
That 
was 
my 
idea, 
and 
Herr 
Milanowitz 
thought 
it 



most 
original. 
Dora 
considered 
it 
very 
awkward 
that 
he 
would 
not 
take 
any 
money 
for 
it, 
but 
it 
made 
it 
possible 
for 
us 
to 
get 
a 
much 
more 
elegant 
frame. 
After 
Christmas; 
for 
New 
Year, 
we 
are 
going 
to 
send 
Herr 
M. 
some 
of 
the 
best 
cigars, 
bought 
with 
our 
own 
money, 
I 
wanted 
to 
send 
them 
for 
Christmas, 
but 
we 
don't 
know 
anything 
about 
cigars, 
and 
we 
did 
not 
want 
to 
tell 
anyone 
because 
one 
can 
never 
know 
whether 
one 
won't 
be 
betrayed 
and 
you 
will 
be 
told 
it 
is 
unintentional; 
but 
that 
is 
not 
true, 
for 
when 
one 
betrays 
anything 
one 
has 
always 
secretly 
intended 
to 
do 
so; 
and 
then 
one 
says 
it 
was 
a 
slip 
of 
the 
tongue; 
but 
one 
really 
knows 
all 
the 
time. 
I 
can't 
write 
down 
all 
the 
extra 
things 
that 
Dora 
got, 
only 
one 
of 
them: 
At 
7 
o'clock 
just 
when 
Father 
was 
lighting 
the 
candles 
on 
the 
tree, 
a 
commissionaire 
brought 
some 
lovely 
roses 
with 
two 
sprays 
of 
mistletoe 
interwoven 
and 
beneath 
a 
nosegay 
of 
violets 
------of 
course 
from 
Dr. 
P. 
with 
a 
card, 
but 
she 
would 
not 
let 
anyone 
read 
that. 
All 
she 
said 
was: 
Dr. 
P. 
sends 
everyone 
Christmas 
greetings; 
I 
believe 
he 
had 
really 
written: 
Merry 
Christmas," 
but 
Dora 
did 
not 
dare 
to 
say 
that. 
Oh, 
and 
Hella 
gave 
me 
a 
bead 
bag, 
and 
I 
gave 
her 
a 
purse 
with 
the 
double 
eagle 
on 
it, 
for 
she 
wanted 
a 
purse 
that 
would 
have 
a 
military 
look. 
I 
never 
knew 
anyone 
with 
such 
an 
enthusiasm 
for 
the 
army 
as 
Hella; 
certainly 
I 
think 
officers 
look 
awfully 
smart; 
but 
surely 
it's 
going 
too 
far 
when 
she 
feels 
that 
other 
men 
practically 
don't 
exist. 
The 
others 
have 
to 
learn 
a 
lot, 
for 
example 
doctors, 
lawyers, 
mining 
engineers, 
not 
to 
speak 
of 
students 
at 
the 
College 
of 
Agriculture, 
for 
perhaps 
these 
last 
"hardly 
count" 
(that's 
the 
phrase 
Hella 
is 
always 
using); 
but 
all 
of 
them 
have 
to 
learn 
a 
great 
deal 
more 
than 
officers 
do; 
Hella 
never 
will 
admit 
that, 
and 
always 
begins 
to 
talk 
of 
the 
officers 
of 
the 
general 
staff; 
as 
if 
they 
all 
belonged 
to 
the 
general 
staff! 
We 
have 
often 
argued 
about 
it. 
Still, 
I 
do 
hope 
she 
will 
get 
an 
officer 
for 
her 
husband, 
of 
course 
one 
who 
is 
well 
enough 
off 
to 
marry, 
for 
otherwise 
it's 
no 
go; 
for 
Father 
says 
the 
Bruckners 
have 
no 
private 
means. 
It's 
true 
he 
always 
says 
that 
of 
us 
too, 
but 
I 
don't 
believe 
it; 
we 
are 
not 
so 
to 
say 
rich, 
but 
I 
fancy 
we 
should 
both 
of 
us 
have 
enough 
money 
for 
an 
officer 
to 
be 
able 
to 
marry 
us. 
Anyhow, 
Dora 
voluntarily 
renounces 
that 
possibility, 
if 
she 
is 
really 
going 
to 
marry 
Dr. 
P. 


27th. 
Well, 
I 
went 
to 
Hella's 
yesterday 
and 
stayed 
till 
9, 
and 
on 
Christmas 
Day 
she 
was 
here. 
I 
see 
that 
I 
wrote 
above 
that 
the 
Bs. 
were 
not 
well 
off; 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
be 
very 
much 
the 
reverse. 
We 
always 
get 
a 
great 
many 
things 
and 
very 
nice 
ones 
at 
Christmas 
and 
on 
our 
birthdays 
and 
name 
days 
(of 



course 
Protestants 
don't 
have 
these 
last), 
but 
we 
don't 
give 
one 
another 
such 
splendid 
things 
as 
the 
Bs. 
do. 
Hella 
had 
been 
given 
a 
piece 
of 
rose-coloured 
silk 
for 
a 
dress 
to 
wear 
at 
the 
dancing 
class 
which 
must 
have 
cost 
at 
least 
50 
crowns, 
and 
a 
lace 
collar 
and 
cuffs, 
which 
we 
had 
seen 
at 
the 
shop, 
and 
it 
had 
cost 
24 
crowns, 
then 
she 
had 
a 
gold 
ring 
with 
an 
emerald, 
and 
a 
number 
of 
smaller 
things 
which 
she 
never 
even 
looked 
at. 
And 
to 
see 
all 
the 
things 
her 
sister 
got, 
things 
for 
her 
trousseau! 
And 
the 
Bs. 
Christmas 
tree 
cost 
12 
crowns 
whilst 
ours 
cost 
only 
7, 
though 
ours 
was 
just 
as 
good. 
So 
I 
think 
that 
the 
Bs. 
really 
have 
plenty 
of 
money, 
and 
I 
said 
to 
Hella: 
"You 
must 
be 
enormously 
rich." 
And 
she 
said: 
"Oh 
well, 
not 
so 
rich 
as 
all 
that; 
I 
must 
not 
expect 
to 
marry 
an 
officer 
on 
the 
general 
staff. 
Lizzi 
has 
done 
very 
well 
for 
herself 
for 
Paul 
is 
a 
baron 
and 
is 
very 
well 
off. 
He 
is 
frantically 
in 
love 
with 
her; 
queer 
taste, 
isn't 
it?" 
I 
quite 
agree, 
for 
Lizzi 
has 
not 
much 
to 
boast 
of 
in 
the 
way 
of 
looks, 
beautiful 
fair 
hair, 
but 
she 
is 
so 
awfully 
thin, 
not 
a 
trace 
of 
b 
----, 
Hella 
has 
much 
more 
figure. 
And 
if 
one 
hasn't 
any 
by 
the 
time 
one 
is 
20 
one 
is 
not 
likely 
to 
get 
one. 


Something 
awfully 
funny 
happened 
to-day. 
Hella 
asked 
me: 
"I 
say, 
what's 
the 
Christian 
name 
of 
that 
Dr. 
who 
is 
dangling 
after 
your 
sister?" 
Then 
it 
struck 
me 
for 
the 
first 
time 
that 
on 
his 
visiting 
card 
he 
only 
has 
Dr. 
jur. 
A. 
Pruckmuller, 
and 
then 
I 
remembered 
that 
last 
summer, 
when 
we 
first 
made 
his 
acquaintance, 
Dora 
said, 
It's 
a 
pity 
he's 
called 
August, 
the 
name 
does 
not 
suit 
him 
at 
all. 
Well, 
we 
laughed 
till 
we 
felt 
quite 
ill, 
for 
of 
course 
Hella 
began 
to 
sing: 
"O 
du 
lieber 
Augustin," 
and 
then 
I 
thought 
of 
Der 
dumme 
August 
[clown's 
nickname 
in 
circus] 
and 
we 
wondered 
what 
Dora 
would 
call 
him. 
Gusti 
or 
Gustel, 
or 
Augi, 
my 
darling 
Augi, 
my 
beloved 
Gusterl, 
oh 
dear, 
we 
were 
in 
fits 
of 
laughter. 
Then 
we 
discussed 
what 
names 
we 
should 
like 
to 
have 
for 
our 
husbands, 
and 
I 
said: 
Ewald 
or 
Leo, 
and 
Hella 
said: 
Wouldn't 
you 
like 
Siegfried? 
But 
I 
put 
my 
hand 
on 
her 
mouth 
and 
said: 
"Shut 
up, 
or 
you 
will 
make 
me 
really 
angry, 
that 
is 
and 
must 
remain 
forgotten." 
She 
said 
what 
she 
would 
like 
best 
would 
be 
to 
have 
a 
husband 
called 
Peter 
or 
Thamian 
or 
Chrysostomus; 
then 
for 
a 
pet 
name 
she 
would 
use 
Dami 
or 
Sosti; 
and 
then 
she 
said 
quite 
seriously 
that 
she 
would 
only 
marry 
a 
man 
called 
Egon, 
or 
Alexander, 
or 
at 
least 
Georg. 
Just 
at 
that 
moment 
her 
mother 
came 
in 
to 
call 
us 
to 
tea, 
and 
she 
said: 
"What's 
an 
that 
about 
Alexander 
and 
Georg? 
You 
are 
such 
dreadful 
girls. 
If 
you 
are 
alone 
together 
for 
a 
couple 
of 
minutes 
(I 
had 
come 
at 
half 
past 
2 
and 
the 
Brs. 
have 
tea 
at 
4, 
and 
that's 
what 
Hella's 
mother 



calls 
2 
minutes), 
you 
begin 
to 
talk 
of 
unsuitable 
things." 
Hella 
was 
afraid 
her 
mother 
would 
think 
God 
knows 
what, 
so 
she 
said: 
"Oh 
no, 
Mother, 
we 
were 
only 
discussing 
what 
names 
we 
should 
like 
our 
fiances 
to 
have." 
You 
ought 
to 
have 
seen 
how 
her 
mother 
went 
on. 
"That's 
just 
it, 
that 
when 
you 
are 
barely 
15 
(I'm 
not 
15 
yet) 
you 
should 
have 
nothing 
but 
such 
things 
in 
your 
heads!" 
Such 
things, 
how 
absurd. 
At 
tea 
it 
was 
almost 
as 
dull 
as 
it 
was 
the 
other 
evening 
at 
home; 
for 
the 
Herr 
Baron 
was 
there, 
that 
is, 
they 
all 
say 
Du 
to 
one 
another 
now, 
for 
the 
wedding 
is 
to 
be 
in 
February, 
as 
soon 
as 
it 
is 
settled 
whether 
the 
Baron 
is 
to 
stay 
in 
London 
or 
to 
be 
transferred 
to 
Berlin. 
It 
must 
be 
funny 
to 
say 
"Du" 
to 
a 
strange 
man. 
Hella 
says 
she 
soon 
got 
used 
to 
it, 
and 
that 
she 
likes 
Paul 
well 
enough. 
When 
he 
brings 
Lizzi 
sweets, 
when 
he 
is 
taking 
her 
to 
the 
theatre, 
he 
always 
gives 
Hella 
a 
box 
for 
herself. 
Other 
people 
would 
certainly 
not 
do 
that, 
and 
I 
know 
other 
people 
who 
wouldn't 
accept 
it. 
When 
I 
got 
home, 
Father 
said: 
Well, 
another 
time 
I 
think 
you'd 
better 
stay 
and 
sleep 
at 
the 
Brs., 
and 
I 
said: 
I 
did 
not 
want 
to 
be 
a 
killjoy 
here. 
And 
Oswald 
said: 
"What 
you 
need 
is 
a 
box 
on 
the 
ear," 
Father 
was 
luckily 
out 
of 
the 
room 
already 
and 
so 
I 
said: 
"Your 
children, 
if 
you 
ever 
have 
any, 
can 
be 
kept 
in 
order 
by 
boxing 
their 
ears 
till 
they 
are 
green 
and 
blue, 
but 
you 
have 
no 
rights 
over 
your 
sisters, 
Father 
told 
you 
so 
in 
Fieberbrunn." 
"Oh, 
I 
know 
Father 
always 
backs 
you 
two 
up, 
he 
has 
done 
so 
from 
the 
first." 
"Please 
don't 
draw 
me 
into 
your 
quarrels," 
said 
Dora, 
as 
if 
she 
had 
been 
something 
quite 
different 
from 
me. 
And 
then 
Aunt 
Dora 
said: 
"I 
do 
wish 
you 
would 
not 
keep 
on 
quarreling." 
"I 
didn't 
begin 
it," 
said 
I, 
and 
went 
away 
without 
saying 
goodnight; 
that 
is 
I 
went 
to 
Father's 
room 
to 
say 
goodnight 
to 
him 
and 
I 
saw 
Aunt 
Dora 
in 
the 
hall, 
but 
I 
didn't 
say 
goodnight 
to 
Oswald 
and 
Dora, 
for 
I'm 
not 
going 
to 
put 
up 
with 
everything. 
And 
now 
it's 
half 
past 
11 
already, 
for 
I 
have 
been 
writing 
such 
a 
long 
time, 
and 
have 
cried 
such 
a 
lot, 
for 
I'm 
very 
unhappy. 
Even 
Hella 
doesn't 
know 
how 
unhappy 
I 
am. 
I 
must 
go 
to 
bed 
now; 
whether 
I 
shall 
sleep 
or 
not 
is 
another 
question. 
If 
I 
can 
possibly 
manage 
it, 
I 
shall 
go 
alone 
to 
the 
cemetery 
to-morrow. 


31st. 
Hella 
and 
I 
went 
to 
the 
cemetery 
to-day. 
Her 
father 
and 
mother 
returned 
to 
Cracow 
yesterday 
evening, 
and 
she 
told 
her 
grandmother 
she 
was 
going 
to 
spend 
the 
morning 
with 
me, 
and 
I 
said 
I 
was 
going 
to 
the 
Brs., 
so 
we 
went 
alone 
to 
Potzleinsdorf. 
Hella 
went 
for 
a 
walk 
round 
the 
cemetery 
while 
I 
went 
to 
darling 
Mother's 
grave. 
I 
am 
so 
unhappy; 
Hella 
consoles 
me 
as 
much 
as 
she 
can, 
but 
even 
she 
can't 
understand. 



January 
1, 
19--! 
Of 
course 
we 
did 
not 
keep 
New 
Year's 
Eve 
yesterday, 
but 
were 
quite 
alone 
and 
it 
was 
very 
melancholy. 
This 
morning 
Dr. 
P. 
brought 
Dora 
and 
Aunt 
Dora 
some 
roses 
and 
he 
gave 
me 
some 
lovely 
violets 
as 
a 
New 
Year's 
greeting. 
He 
is 
leaving 
on 
the 
4th, 
so 
he 
is 
coming 
here 
on 
the 
evening 
of 
the 
3rd. 
I 
can't 
say 
I 
look 
forward 
to 
it. 
To-morrow 
school 
begins 
thank 
goodness. 
I 
met 
a 
dust 
cart, 
that 
means 
good 
luck; 
Father 
says 
it 
is 
a 
scandal 
the 
way 
the 
dirt 
carts 
go 
on 
all 
through 
the 
day 
in 
Vienna, 
and 
that 
one 
should 
see 
one 
even 
on 
New 
Year's 
day 
at 
2 
in 
the 
afternoon. 
But 
still, 
if 
it 
means 
good 
luck! 


January 
2nd. 
The 
dust 
cart 
did 
bring 
good 
luck. 
We 
had 
a 
real 
piece 
of 
luck 
to-day! 
In 
the 
big 
interval 
I 
noticed 
a 
little 
knot 
of 
girls 
in 
the 
hall, 
and 
suddenly 
I 
felt 
as 
if 
my 
heart 
would 
stop 
beating. 
Frau 
Doktor 
M., 
I 
should 
say 
Frau 
Professor 
Theyer, 
was 
standing 
among 
them, 
she 
saw 
us 
directly 
and 
held 
out 
her 
hand 
to 
us 
so 
we 
kissed 
it. 
She 
has 
come 
to 
visit 
her 
parents 
and 
her 
husband 
is 
with 
her; 
since 
she 
did 
not 
know 
for 
certain 
whether 
she 
would 
be 
able 
to 
come 
to 
the 
school 
she 
had 
not 
written 
either 
to 
me 
or 
to 
Hella 
about 
it. 
She 
is 
so 
lovely 
and 
so 
entrancingly 
loveable. 
When 
the 
bell 
rang 
for 
class 
and 
Frau 
Doktor 
Dunker 
came 
in 
I 
saw 
that 
she 
was 
still 
standing 
outside. 
So 
I 
put 
my 
handkerchief 
up 
to 
my 
face 
as 
if 
my 
nose 
were 
bleeding, 
and 
rushed 
out 
to 
her. 
And 
because 
I 
slipped 
and 
nearly 
fell, 
she 
held 
out 
her 
arms 
to 
me. 
Hardly 
had 
I 
reached 
her, 
when 
Hella 
came 
out 
and 
said: 
"Of 
course 
I 
understood 
directly; 
I 
said 
you 
were 
awfully 
bad, 
so 
I 
must 
go 
and 
look 
after 
you." 
Then 
the 
Frau 
Professor 
laughed 
like 
anything 
and 
said: 
"You 
are 
such 
wicked 
little 
actresses; 
I 
must 
send 
you 
back 
immediately." 
But 
of 
course 
she 
did 
not 
but 
was 
frightfully 
sweet. 
Then 
we 
begged 
her 
to 
let 
us 
stay 
with 
her, 
but 
she 
said: 
"No, 
no, 
I've 
been 
your 
teacher 
here, 
and 
I 
must 
not 
encourage 
you 
in 
mischief. 
But 
here 
is 
a 
better 
idea. 
Would 
you 
like 
to 
come 
and 
see 
me 
to-morrow?" 
"Rather," 
we 
both 
exclaimed. 
She 
said 
she 
was 
staying 
in 
a 
hotel, 
but 
we 
must 
not 
come 
alone 
to 
a 
hotel, 
so 
she 
would 
see 
us 
at 
her 
parents, 
in 
Schwindgasse, 
and 
we 
were 
to 
come 
there 
at 
4 
or 
half 
past. 
Then 
we 
kissed 
both 
her 
hands 
and 
were 
so 
happy! 
To-morrow 
at 
4! 
Oh 
dear, 
a 
whole 
night 
more 
and 
nearly 
a 
whole 
day 
to 
wait. 
"If 
your 
parents 
allow 
you," 
she 
said; 
as 
if 
Father 
or 
even 
Hella's 
grandmother 
would 
not 
allow 
that! 
All 
Father 
said 
was: 
"All 
right 
Gretel, 
but 
don't 
go 
quite 
off 
your 
head 
first 
or 
you 
won't 
be 
able 
to 
find 
your 
way 
to 



Schwindgasse. 
Is 
Hella 
as 
crazy 
as 
you 
are?" 
Of 
course, 
how 
can 
one 
be 
otherwise? 


January 
3rd. 
Still 
2 
hours, 
it's 
awful, 
Hella 
is 
coming 
to 
fetch 
me 
at 
half 
past 


3. 
In 
school 
to-day 
we 
kept 
on 
looking 
at 
one 
another, 
and 
all 
the 
other 
girls 
thought 
it 
must 
be 
something 
to 
do 
with 
a 
man. 
Goodness, 
what 
do 
we 
care 
about 
a 
man 
now! 
We 
had 
a 
splendid 
idea, 
that 
we 
had 
just 
time 
to 
make 
a 
memento 
for 
her, 
since 
she 
does 
not 
leave 
until 
the 
evening 
of 
the 
5th. 
I 
am 
having 
traced 
on 
a 
piece 
of 
yellow 
silk 
for 
a 
book 
marker 
an 
edelweiss 
and 
her 
monogram 
E. 
T., 
the 
new 
one 
of 
course. 
Hella 
is 
painting 
a 
paperknife 
in 
imitation 
of 
tarsia 
mosaic. 
I 
would 
rather 
have 
done 
something 
of 
that 
sort 
too, 
but 
I 
have 
no 
patience 
for 
such 
work, 
so 
I 
often 
spoil 
it 
before 
I've 
finished. 
But 
one 
can't 
very 
well 
spoil 
a 
piece 
of 
embroidery. 
But 
I 
shan't 
get 
the 
tracing 
on 
the 
silk 
back 
from 
the 
shop 
until 
half 
past 
3, 
so 
I 
shall 
have 
to 
work 
all 
night 
and 
the 
whole 
day 
to-morrow. 
Evening. 
Thank 
goodness 
and 
confound 
it, 
whichever 
way 
you 
like 
to 
take 
it, 
the 
idiot 
at 
the 
shop 
had 
forgotten 
about 
the 
bookmarker 
and 
I 
shan't 
get 
it 
until 
to-morrow 
morning 
early. 
So 
I'm 
able 
to 
write 
now: 
It 
was 
heavenly! 
We 
had 
to 
walk 
up 
and 
down 
in 
front 
of 
her 
house 
for 
at 
least 
half 
an 
hour, 
until 
at 
last 
it 
was 
5 
minutes 
past 
4. 
She 
was 
so 
sweet 
to 
us! 
She 
wanted 
to 
say 
Sie 
to 
us, 
but 
we 
simply 
would 
not 
have 
it, 
and 
so 
she 
said 
Du 
as 
she 
used 
to. 
We 
talked 
of 
all 
sorts 
of 
things, 
I 
don't 
know 
what, 
only 
that 
I 
suddenly 
burst 
out 
crying, 
and 
then 
she 
drew 
me 
to 
her 
b 
----, 
no, 
I 
can't 
write 
that 
about 
her; 
she 
drew 
me 
to 
herself 
and 
than 
I 
felt 
her 
heart 
beating! 
and 
went 
almost 
crazy. 
Hella 
says 
that 
I 
put 
both 
my 
arms 
round 
her 
neck, 
but 
I'm 
sure 
that's 
all 
imagination, 
for 
I 
should 
never 
have 
dared. 
She 
has 
such 
fascinating 
hands, 
and 
the 
wedding 
ring 
glistens 
so 
on 
her 
divine 
ring 
finger. 
Of 
course 
we 
talked 
about 
the 
school, 
and 
then 
she 
suddenly 
said: 
Tell 
me 
what 
really 
happened 
about 
those 
compositions, 
when 
half 
the 
class 
deliberately 
refrained 
from 
putting 
any 
punctuation 
marks. 
"Oh," 
we 
said, 
"that 
is 
a 
frightful 
cram, 
it 
wasn't 
half 
the 
class, 
but 
only 
6 
of 
us 
who 
have 
a 
special 
veneration 
for 
you." 
Then 
we 
told 
her 
how 
it 
all 
came 
about. 
She 
laughed 
a 
little, 
and 
said: 
"Well, 
girls, 
you 
did 
not 
do 
me 
any 
particular 
service. 
It 
really 
was 
a 
great 
piece 
of 
impertinence." 
But 
I 
said: 
"Prof. 
Fritsch's 
remarks 
were 
10 
times 
more 
impertinent, 
for 
they 
related 
to 
another 
member 
of 
the 
staff, 
and 
what 
was 
worse 
to 
you." 
Then 
she 
said: 
"My 
darling 
girls, 
that 
often 



happens 
in 
life, 
that 
the 
absent 
are 
given 
a 
bad 
reputa-tion, 
whether 
justly 
or 
unjustly; 
one 
is 
liable 
to 
that 
in 
every 
profession." 
Hella 
said 
that 
the 
head 
mistress 
was 
not 
like 
that 
or 
there 
would 
have 
been 
a 
frightful 
row, 
since 
the 
matter 
had 
become 
known 
in 
all 
the 
High 
Schools 
of 
Vienna. 
Then 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
said: 
"Yes, 
the 
Frau 
Direktorin 
is 
really 
a 
splendid 
woman." 
Then 
there 
came 
something 
glorious, 
or 
really 
2 
glorious 
things: 
1). 
She 
gave 
us 
some 
magnificent 
sweets, 
better 
than 
I 
have 
ever 
eaten 
before. 
Hella 
agrees, 
and 
we 
are 
really 
connoisseurs 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
sweets. 
The 
second 
thing, 
even 
more 
glorious, 
was 
this: 
after 
we 
had 
been 
there 
some 
time, 
there 
was 
a 
knock 
at 
the 
door 
and 
in 
came 
her 
husband, 
the 
Herr 
Prof., 
and 
said: 
"How 
are 
you 
my 
treasure?" 
and 
to 
us: 
"Goodday, 
young 
ladies." 
Then 
she 
introduced 
us, 
saying: 
"Two 
of 
my 
best-loved 
pupils 
and 
my 
most 
faithful 
adherents." 
Then 
the 
Herr 
Prof. 
laughed 
a 
great 
deal 
and 
said: 
"That 
can't 
be 
said 
of 
all 
pupils." 
So 
I 
said 
quickly: 
"Oh 
yes, 
it 
can 
be 
said 
of 
Frau 
Doktor, 
the 
whole 
class 
would 
go 
through 
fire 
for 
her." 
Then 
he 
went 
away, 
and 
she 
said: 
"Excuse 
me 
for 
a 
moment," 
and 
we 
could 
hear 
quite 
plainly 
that 
he 
kissed 
her 
in 
the 
next 
room, 
and 
then 
she 
said 
as 
she 
came 
in 
again: 
"Oh 
well, 
be 
off 
with 
you, 
Karl, 
goodbye." 
It's 
a 
pity 
his 
name 
is 
Karl, 
it's 
so 
prosaic, 
and 
he 
calls 
her 
Lise, 
and 
I 
expect 
when 
they 
are 
alone 
he 
calls 
her 
Lieschen, 
since 
he 
is 
a 
North 
German. 
I 
must 
go 
to 
bed, 
it's 
half 
past 
11 
already. 
To 
be 
continued 
to-morrow. 
Sleep 
well, 
my 
sweet 
glorious 
ecstatic 
golden 
and 
only 
treasure! 
God, 
I 
am 
so 
happy. 


January 
6th. 
Thank 
goodness 
to-day 
is 
a 
holiday, 
and 
we 
can't 
go 
tobogganing 
because 
Dora 
has 
a 
chill!!! 
I 
got 
the 
bookmarker 
on 
the 
4th, 
worked 
at 
it 
all 
day 
and 
up 
till 
midnight, 
and 
yesterday 
I 
got 
up 
at 
half 
past 
5, 
went 
on 
working 
the 
whole 
morning, 
and 
at 
2 
o'clock 
we 
took 
our 
mementoes 
to 
the 
house. 
Though 
we 
should 
have 
liked 
to 
give 
them 
to 
her 
ourselves, 
we 
didn't, 
but 
only 
gave 
them 
to 
the 
maid. 
She 
said: 
Shall 
I 
show 
you 
in? 
but 
Hella 
said: 
"No, 
thank 
you, 
we 
don't 
want 
to 
disturb 
Frau 
Theyer, 
and 
when 
I 
reproached 
her 
for 
this 
she 
said: 
Oh 
no, 
it 
was 
better 
not; 
you 
are 
quite 
upset 
anyhow, 
you 
know 
what 
she 
said: 
But 
my 
dear 
child, 
you 
will 
make 
yourself 
ill; 
you 
must 
not 
do 
that 
on 
my 
account!" 
Oh 
dear, 
I'm 
crying 
so 
that 
I 
can 
hardly 
write, 
but 
I 
must 
write, 
for 
there 
is 
still 
so 
much 
that's 
glorious 
to 
put 
down, 
things 
that 
I 
must 
never, 
never 
forget, 
even 
if 
it 
should 
take 
me 
a 
week 
to 
write. 
The 
great 
thing 
is 
that 
I 
shall 
simply 
live 
upon 
this 
memory, 
and 
the 
only 
thing 
I 
want 
in 
life 
is 
that 
I 
may 
see 
her 
once 
more. 
Of 
course 
we 
took 



her 
some 
flowers 
on 
Friday, 
I 
lilies 
of 
the 
valley 
with 
violets 
and 
tuberoses, 
and 
Hella 
Christmas 
roses. 
She 
was 
delighted, 
and 
went 
directly 
to 
fetch 
2 
vases 
which 
her 
mother 
brought 
in. 
She 
is 
as 
small 
as 
Frau 
Richter, 
and 
her 
hair 
is 
grey, 
she 
is 
charming; 
but 
she 
is 
not 
in 
the 
least 
like 
Frau 
Doktor 
M. 
When 
we 
said 
goodbye 
she 
offered 
us 
still 
more 
sweets, 
but 
since 
we 
were 
both 
nearly 
crying 
already 
we 
did 
not 
want 
to 
take 
any 
more, 
but 
she 
wrapped 
them 
nearly 
all 
up 
for 
us, 
saying: 
"To 
console 
you 
in 
your 
sorrow." 
From 
anyone 
else 
it 
might 
have 
sounded 
ironical, 
but 
from 
her 
it 
was 
simply 
lovely. 
There 
were 
17 
large 
sweets, 
and 
Hella 
gave 
me 
9 
of 
them 
and 
took 
only 
8 
for 
herself. 
I 
shall 
eat 
only 
one 
every 
day, 
so 
that 
they 
will 
last 
me 
9 
days. 
Joy 
and 
sorrow 
combined!! 
Hella 
is 
not 
so 
frightfully 
in 
love 
as 
I 
am, 
and 
yesterday 
she 
said, 
in 
joke 
of 
course: 
"It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
your 
whole 
world 
is 
foundered; 
I 
must 
pull 
you 
out, 
or 
you'll 
be 
drowned." 
And 
then 
she 
asked 
me 
how 
I 
could 
have 
been 
so 
stupid 
as 
to 
use 
the 
word 
honeymoon 
to 
her, 
although 
she 
hemmed 
to 
warn 
me. 
She 
said 
it 
really 
was 
utterly 
idiotic 
of 
me, 
and 
that 
the 
Frau 
Prof. 
blushed. 
I 
did 
not 
notice 
it 
myself, 
but 
when 
her 
husband 
came 
in, 
she 
certainly 
did 
flush 
up 
like 
anything. 
Hella 
and 
I 
talked 
of 
quite 
a 
lot 
of 
other 
things 
of 
that 
sort. 
I 
should 
so 
much 
have 
liked 
to 
ask 
her 
whether 
she 
has 
given 
up 
going 
to 
church, 
for 
I 
think 
the 
Herr 
Prof. 
really 
is 
a 
Jew, 
though 
he 
does 
not 
look 
like 
one. 
For 
lots 
of 
other 
men 
wear 
black 
beards. 
But 
I 
did 
not 
venture 
to 
ask, 
and 
Hella 
thinks 
it 
is 
a 
very 
good 
thing 
I 
did 
not, 
for 
one 
does 
not 
talk 
about 
such 
things. 
I 
wonder 
whether 
she 
will 
have 
a 
baby? 
Oh, 
it 
would 
be 
horrible. 
Of 
course 
she 
may 
have 
entered 
into 
a 
marriage 
contract, 
that 
would 
have 
been 
the 
best 
way. 
However, 
Hella 
thinks 
that 
the 
professor 
would 
not 
have 
agreed 
to 
anything 
of 
the 
kind. 
But 
surely 
if 
he 
was 
frantically 
in 
love 
with 
her 
. 
. 
. 


January 
1 
5th. 
The 
girls 
in 
our 
class 
are 
frantically 
jealous. 
We 
did 
not 
say 
in 
so 
many 
words 
that 
we, 
alone 
among 
them 
all, 
had 
been 
invited 
to 
see 
her, 
but 
Hella 
had 
brought 
one 
of 
the 
sweets 
she 
had 
given 
us 
and 
in 
the 
interval 
she 
said: 
This 
must 
be 
eaten 
reverently, 
and 
she 
cut 
it 
in 
two 
to 
give 
me 
half. 
The 
Ehrenfelds 
thought 
it 
must 
have 
been 
given 
by 
some 
acquaintance 
made 
at 
the 
skating 
rink, 
and 
Trude 
said: 
"Doubly 
sweetened, 
by 
chocolate 
and 
love." 
"Yes," 
said 
I, 
"but 
not 
in 
the 
sense 
you 
imagine." 
And 
since 
she 
said: 
"Oh, 
of 
course, 
I 
know 
all 
about 
that, 
but 
I 
don't 
want 
to 
be 
indiscreet," 
Hella 
said: 
"I 
may 
as 
well 
tell 
you 
that 
Frau 
Doktor 
M., 
or 
I 
should 
say 
the 
married 
Frau 
Prof. 
Theyer, 
gave 
us 
this 
sweet 
and 
a 
great 
many 
more 
on 
the 
day 
she 



had 
invited 
us 
to 
go 
and 
see 
her." 
Then 
they 
were 
all 
utterly 
kerblunxed 
and 
said: 
"Great 
Scott, 
what 
luck, 
but 
you 
always 
were 
Frau 
Doktor 
M.'s 
favourites, 
especially 
Lainer. 
But 
Lainer 
always 
courted 
Frau 
Doktor 
M." 


January 
17th. 
The 
whole 
school 
knows 
about 
our 
being 
invited 
to 
see 
her, 
the 
glorious 
one! 
I've 
just 
been 
reading 
it 
over, 
and 
I 
see 
that 
I 
have 
left 
a 
frightful 
lot 
out, 
especially 
about 
her 
father. 
When 
we 
were 
leaving, 
just 
outside 
the 
house 
door 
we 
burst 
out 
crying 
because 
as 
I 
opened 
the 
door 
I 
had 
said, 
For 
the 
last 
time! 
Just 
then 
an 
old 
gentleman 
came 
up 
and 
was 
about 
to 
go 
in, 
and 
when 
he 
saw 
that 
we 
were 
crying, 
though 
we 
were 
standing 
quite 
in 
the 
shadow, 
he 
came 
up 
to 
us 
and 
asked 
what 
was 
the 
matter. 
Then 
Hella 
said: 
"We 
have 
lost 
out 
best 
friend." 
Then 
the 
old 
gentleman 
looked 
at 
us 
for 
a 
tremendously 
long 
time 
and 
said: 
"I 
say, 
do 
you 
happen 
to 
be 
the 
two 
ardent 
admirers 
of 
Frau 
Doktor 
Mallburg? 
She 
is 
my 
daughter, 
you 
know. 
And 
then 
he 
said: 
But 
you 
really 
can't 
go 
through 
the 
streets 
bathed 
in 
tears 
like 
that. 
Come 
upstairs 
again 
with 
me 
and 
my 
daughter 
will 
console 
you." 
So 
we 
really 
did 
go 
upstairs 
again, 
and 
she 
was 
perfectly 
unique. 
Her 
father 
opened 
the 
door 
and 
called 
out: 
Lieserl, 
your 
admirers 
simply 
can't 
part 
from 
you, 
and 
I 
found 
them 
being 
washed 
out 
to 
sea 
in 
a 
river 
of 
tears. 
Then 
she 
came 
out 
wearing 
a 
rose-coloured 
dressing-gown!!! 
exquisite. 
And 
she 
led 
us 
into 
the 
room 
and 
said: 
"Girls, 
you 
must 
not 
look 
at 
me 
in 
this 
old 
rag, 
which 
is 
only 
fit 
to 
throw 
away." 
I 
should 
have 
liked 
to 
say: 
"Give 
it 
to 
me 
then." 
But 
of 
course 
I 
could 
not. 
And 
when 
we 
made 
our 
final 
goodbye, 
perhaps 
for 
ever, 
she 
kissed 
each 
of 
us 
twice 
over 
and 
said: 
Girls, 
I 
wish 
you 
all 
the 
happiness 
in 
the 
world! 


January 
18th. 
Hella 
invited 
me 
there 
to-day, 
to 
meet 
Lajos 
and 
Jeno. 
But 
I'm 
not 
going, 
for 
Jeno 
does 
not 
interest 
me 
in 
the 
very 
least. 
That 
was 
not 
a 
real 
love. 
I 
don't 
care 
for 
anyone 
in 
the 
whole 
world 
except 
her, 
my 
one 
and 
only! 
Even 
Hella 
can't 
understand 
that, 
in 
fact 
she 
thinks 
it 
dotty. 
Father 
wanted 
me 
to 
go 
to 
Hella's 
to 
change 
the 
current 
of 
my 
thoughts. 
Of 
course 
I 
hardly 
say 
a 
word 
about 
her 
to 
anyone, 
for 
no 
one 
understands 
me. 
But 
I 
never 
could 
have 
believed 
that 
Father 
would 
be 
just 
like 
anyone 
else. 
It's 
quite 
true 
that 
I'm 
getting 
thin. 
I'm 
so 
glad 
that 
we 
are 
not 
going 
tobogganing 
to-day 
because 
Dora 
has 
a 
chill, 
a 
real 
chill 
this 
time. 
So 
I 
am 
going 
to 
the 
church 
in 
Schwindgasse 
and 
shall 
walk 
up 
and 
down 
in 
front 
of 
her 
house; 
perhaps 
I 
shall 
meet 
her 
father 
or 
her 
mother. 
I 
wrote 
to 
her 
the 
day 
before 
yesterday. 



January 
24th. 
I 
am 
so 
happy. 
She 
wrote 
to 
me 
by 
return! 
This 
is 
the 
second 
letter 
I 
have 
had 
from 
her! 
At 
dinner 
to-day 
Father 
said: 
"Hullo, 
Gretel, 
why 
are 
you 
looking 
so 
happy 
to-day? 
I 
have 
not 
seen 
you 
with 
such 
a 
sunny 
face 
for 
a 
long 
time." 
So 
I 
answered 
in 
as 
few 
words 
as 
possible: 
"After 
dinner 
I 
will 
tell 
you 
why." 
For 
the 
others 
need 
not 
know 
anything 
about 
it. 
And 
when 
I 
told 
Father 
vaguely 
that 
Frau 
Prof. 
Th. 
had 
written 
to 
me, 
Father 
said: 
"Oh, 
is 
that 
what 
has 
pleased 
you 
so 
much. 
But 
I 
have 
something 
up 
my 
sleeve 
which 
will 
also 
please 
you. 
February 
1st 
and 
2nd 
are 
Sunday 
and 
Monday, 
you 
have 
2 
days 
free, 
and 
if 
you 
and 
Hella 
can 
get 
a 
day 
off 
from 
school 
on 
Saturday 
we 
might 
make 
an 
excursion 
to 
Mariazell. 
How 
does 
that 
strike 
you?" 
It 
would 
be 
glorious, 
if 
only 
Hella 
is 
allowed 
to 
come, 
for 
her 
grandmother 
imagines 
that 
the 
sore 
throat 
she 
had 
before 
Christmas 
was 
due 
to 
the 
tobogganing 
on 
the 
Anninger, 
where 
the 
sole 
was 
torn 
off 
her 
shoe! 
As 
if 
we 
could 
help 
that. 
Still, 
by 
good 
luck 
she 
may 
have 
forgotten 
it; 
she 
is 
63 
already, 
and 
one 
forgets 
a 
lot 
when 
one 
is 
that 
age. 


Evening. 
Hella 
may 
come; 
it 
will 
be 
splendid! 
Perhaps 
we 
shall 
try 
a 
little 
skiing. 
But 
really 
Hella 
is 
a 
horrid 
pig; 
she 
said: 
"All 
right, 
I'll 
come, 
if 
you'll 
promise 
not 
to 
be 
continually 
talking 
about 
Frau 
Professor 
Th. 
I'm 
very 
fond 
of 
her 
too, 
but 
you 
are 
simply 
crazy 
about 
her." 
It's 
really 
too 
bad, 
and 
I 
shall 
never 
mention 
her 
name 
to 
the 
others 
any 
more. 
I 
am 
looking 
forward 
so 
to 
the 
tobogganing 
at 
Mariazell. 
We've 
never 
made 
any 
such 
excursion 
in 
winter 
before. 
Hurrah, 
it 
will 
be 
glorious! 
Oh 
I 
do 
wish 
the 
31st 
of 
January 
were 
here; 
I'm 
frantically 
excited. 


EDITOR'S 
NOTE 


Rita's 
joyful 
expectations 
of 
tobogganing 
among 
glistening 
snow-clad 
hills, 
remained 
unfulfilled. 
The 
rude 
hand 
of 
fate 
was 
thrust 
into 
the 
lives 
of 
the 
two 
sisters. 
On 
January 
29th 
their 
father, 
suddenly 
struck 
down 
with 
paralysis, 
was 
brought 
home 
in 
an 
ambulance, 
and 
died 
in 
a 
few 
hours 
without 
recovering 
consciousness. 



Torn 
from 
the 
sheltering 
and 
affectionate 
atmosphere 
of 
home, 
separated 
from 
her 
most 
intimate 
friend, 
the 
young 
orphan 
had 
to 
struggle 
for 
peace 
of 
soul 
in 
the 
isolation 
of 
a 
provincial 
town
