INTRODUCTION 


Felix 
qui 
potuit 
rerum 
cognoscere 
causas 


Prolix 
introductions 
are 
often 
neglected. 
An 
excellent 
reason 
to 
be 
concise. 


Many 
a 
symptom 
tells 
us 
that 
contemporary 
Logic 
is 
seriously 
ill. 
What 
credit 
could 
the 
common 
sense 
recognize 
to 
someone 
who 
assured 
the 
possibility 
to 
dissect 
an 
orange 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
with 
its 
pieces 
two 
oranges 
identical 
to 
the 
former 
could 
be 
recomposed? 
Neither 
Banach-Tarski’s 
and 
Hausdorff’s 
theorems 
(Skolem 
1962, 
Lecture 
11, 
or, 
more 
in 
details, 
Jech 
in 
Barwise 
1977) 
are 
the 
sole 
manifestations 
of 
a 
severe 
disease. 
The 
situation 
of 
uncertainty 
determined 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
logical 
paradoxes 
are 
still 
waiting 
for 
a 
general 
and 
definitive 
solution 
compels 
the 
orthodoxy 
to 
nearly 
unbelievable 
contortions 
in 
order 
to 
save 
a 
merely 
apparent 
coherence. 


Some 
examples. 
What 
about 
the 
theorem 
of 
the 
classical 
set 
theory 
according 
to 
which 
(Suppes, 
1972 
Theor.50) 
the 
set 
of 
individuals 
identical 
to 
themselves 
is 
empty? 
And 
what 
about 
the 
total 
elimination 
of 
variables 
(Schoenfinkel 
in 
V. 
Heijenoort 
1967)? 
What 
about 
Lowenheim’s 
Theorem? 
What 
about 
the 
truth 
functional 
analysis 
of 
conditionals? 
What 
about 
the 
theorization 
of 
truth? 
Nowadays 
Logic 
is 
a 
freakish 
and 
esoteric 
doctrine 
far 
from 
our 
common 
sense, 
and 
the 
crumbling 
zones 
are 
too 
numerous 
to 
hope 
that 
the 
vice 
be 
superficial. 
Problems 
cannot 
be 
solved 
until 
we 
do 
not 
get 
out 
of 
the 
approach 
by 
which 
they 
have 
been 
born, 
says 
an 
old 
adage. 
Actually 
a 
radically 
new 
approach 
is 
needed. 
For 
an 
unknown 
author, 
an 
almost 
infallible 
way 
to 
fall 
into 
ridicule 
is 
to 
begin 
by 
declaring 
that 
his 
results 
are 
important, 
My 
dilemma 
is 
then 
this: 
to 
lie 
or 
to 
face 
the 
charge 
of 
intellectual 
autolesionism? 
Someone 
says: 
My 
aim? 
To 
show 
the 
fly 
the 
way-out 
from 
the 
trap. 
and 
suddenly 
a 
chill 
casts 
over 
the 
gathering; 
yet 
the 
aphorism 
is 
not 
mine 
(Wittgenstein, 
1953 
p.309). 
It 
is 
a 
question 
of 
previous 
authoritativeness 
and 
mine, 
probably, 
entails 
a 
general 
inattention. 
Nevermind: 
the 
success 
is 
nearly 
always 
wrong, 
if 
Schopenauer 
is 
right. 
I 
am 
not 
so 
naive 
to 
think 
that 
history 
demonstrates 
the 
unavoidable 
success 
of 
meritorious 
works. 
History 
demonstrates 
only 
the 
unavoidable 
success 
of 
the 
meritorious 
successful 
works. 
What 
do 
we 
know 
about 
the 
rest? 
A 
bad 
destiny, 
yet 
not 
the 
worst: 
chronicles 
narrate 
that 
Hyppasus 
of 
Metaponto 
was 
put 
to 
death 
for 
having 
made 
public 
the 
existence 
of 
incommensurable 
quantities 
(hence 
my 
temptation 
to 
proceed 
apocryphally). 



On 
the 
other 
hand 
already 
Locke 
(probably 
inspired 
by 
my 
contingent 


situation) 
realized 
that 
a 
simple 
and 
private 
writer 
cannot 
avoid 
being 


censured 
when 
pursuing 
the 
truth 
through 
an 
autonomous 
path 
(too 
many 


quotations? 
they 
are 
simply 
an 
awkward 
attempt 
to 
mask 
frightening 
cultural 


gaps). 


Then 
to 
write 
with 
a 
serene 
irony, 
once 
the 
expositive 
clearness 
is 
assured. 
A 


really 
courageous 
aim, 
since 
an 
obscure 
text 
is 
the 
strongest 
defence 
against 


the 
Wildian 
terror 
of 
not 
being 
misunderstood. 


Indeed 
an 
altruistic 
reason 
too 
induces 
me 
to 
publish 
this 
work: 
to 
put 
a 
new 
and 
fecund 
viewpoint 
at 
public 
disposal. 
Yet 
the 
main 
reason 
is 
egoistic: 
to 
establish 
a 
paternity. 
I 
confess 
that 
I 
would 
be 
proud 
to 
be 
considered 
as 
a 
great 
thinker; 
also 
because 
of 
the 
high 
social 
qualification 
which 


traditionally 
is 
recognized 
to 
the 
category; 
he 
is 
a 
stupid, 
he 
thinks 
too 
much, 
King 
Arthur 
admonished. 


So 
to 
say 
roughly, 
the 
contemporary 
logic 
is 
crushed 
down 
by 
an 
intrinsically 
inadequate 
bidimensional 
approach: 
on 
one 
side 
the 
sign, 
on 
the 
other 
side 
the 
referent. 
But 
such 
an 
approach 
neglects 
the 
crucial 
protagonist 
of 
any 
reasoning, 
that 
is 
the 
information, 
the 
meaning, 
the 
mind. 
I 
agree 
that 
“information”, 
“meaning”, 
“mind” 
express 
difficult 
and 
dangerous 
notions, 
but 
to 
look 
elsewhere 
when 
they 
appear 
on 
the 
stage 
is 
a 
loosing 
ostrich 
strategy. 
The 
primigenial 
logic 
that 
allowed 
the 


animal 
evolution 
until 
the 
homo 
sapiens 
sapiens, 
cannot 
be 
a 
logic 
of 
the 
sign, 
since 
the 
sign 
appears 
millions 
of 
years 
later: 
it 
must 
be 
a 
logic 
of 
information, 
since 
information 
does 
exist 
wherever 
an 
even 
primigenial 
knower 
exists. 
No 
doubt 
that 
the 
sign 
and 
the 
referent 
too 
have 
an 
irrenunciable 
place 
in 
every 
realistic 
gnosiology, 
but 
to 
assume 
them 
as 
sole 
actors 
is 
like 
to 
reduce 
a 
cruise 
to 
the 
embarking 
and 
the 
landing. 


As 
soon 
as 
a 
third 
dimension 
is 
granted 
to 
logic, 
its 
problems 
find 
a 
sequence 
of 
harmonious 
solutions. 
The 
evidences 
are 
too 
many 
to 
represent 
mere 
concomitances; 
only 
when 
the 
path 
is 
the 
right 
one 
the 
lifting 
of 
the 
fog 
reveals 
a 
landscape 
corresponding 
to 
the 
map 
we 
are 
following. 
In 
this 
sense 
I 
firmly 
believe 
that 
these 
same 
ideas, 
perhaps 
better 
proposed 
by 
other 
authors, 
but 
anyhow 
these 
same 
ideas, 
sooner 
or 
later, 
will 
enter 
into 
the 
history 
of 
Logic. 


I 
spoke 
with 
absolute 
sincerity. 
Some 
smart 
spirit 
(Russell?) 
remarked 
that 
a 
reasonable 
private 
income 
is 
an 
indispensable 
requisite 
to 
practise 
the 
sincerity. 
Someone 
else 
(who?), 
not 
less 
smartly, 
remarked 
that 
to 
practise 
the 
sincerity 
is 
a 
rather 
dangerous 
behaviour 
if 
it 
is 
not 
coupled 
with 
a 
massive 
dose 
of 
dullness. 
Discouraging 
remarks 
for 
him 
who, 
like 
me, 
possesses 
a 
reasonable 
private 
income, 
shrinks 
from 
any 
danger 
and 
nevertheless 
thinks 
to 
be 
in 
the 
best 
conditions 
to 
practise 
the 
sincerity. 



CHAPTER 
1 
GENERALITIES 


Zilu 
asked 
Confucius: 
If 
the 
Prince 
entrusted 
You 
the 
Government, 
what 
the 
first 
measure? 


And 
the 
Master: 
A 
reform 
of 
the 
language, 
undoubtedly. 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
develop 
valid 
discourses 
if 
the 
nouns 
are 
not 
correct. 


1.1. 
In 
my 
opinion, 
the 
very 
consequential 
mistake 
affecting 
the 
current 
logic 
hides, 
so 
to 
say, 
in 
its 
constitutional 
flatness. 
At 
first 
sight, 
to 
by-pass 
meanings 
(fuzzy 
and 
elusive 
entities) 
in 
order 
to 
deal 
with 
signs 
(well 
determined 
and 
tangible 
objects), 
seems 
a 
quite 
advantageous 
choice. 
Yet 
such 
a 
decision 
presupposes 
erroneously 
that 
the 
meaning-stage 
is 
by-passable 
as 
an 
unessential 
intermediate 
landing. 
A 
theory 
which 
puts 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
things, 
properties, 
relations, 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
nouns, 


adjectives, 
verbs, 
neglects 
the 
real 
protagonist 
of 
whatever 
logos, 
that 
is 
the 
knower 
(the 
intelligent 
organism) 
whose 
presence 
is 
absolutely 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
settle 
a 
contact 
between 
the 
sphere 
of 
referents 
and 
the 
sphere 
of 
signs. 
Logic 
does 
not 
rule 
the 
world; 
it 
does 
rule 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
world: 
what 
space 
could 
logic 
have 
in 
a 
galaxy 
without 
any 
gnosiology? 
But 
where 
is 
the 
gnosiologic 


dimension 
in 
the 
current 
theorizations? 
An 
approach 
reducing 
a 
tridimensional 
matter 
to 
bidimensionality 
is 
intrinsically 
inadequate, 
and 
since 
the 
neglected 
third 
dimension 
is 
just 
the 
informational 
one, 
only 
a 
logic 
of 
information 
can 
overcome 
this 
inadequateness. 


1.1.1. 
To 
avoid 
misunderstandings, 
I 
am 
not 
claiming 
that 
the 
current 
theorizations 
are 
sterile; 
they 
are 
partial 
and 
reductive 
like 
the 
visit 
of 
a 
doctor 
who 
were 
to 
look 
at 
his 
patient 
exclusively 
through 
a 
little 
mirror. 
I 
claim 
that 
the 
only 
logic 
compatible 
with 
our 
common 
sense 
must 
be 
grounded 
on 
the 
concept 
of 
information, 
and 
that 
such 
a 
concept, 
wherever 
a 
linguistic 
component 
occurs 
in 
the 
process, 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
concept 
of 
meaning, 
an 
indispensable 
trait 
d’union 
between 
sign 
and 
referent. 


I 
recognize 
that 
to 
speak 
of 
meanings 
ex 
abrupto 
is 
a 
license. 
I 
agree 
with 
Chomsky 
where 
he 
says 
(I 


quote 
by 
memory) 
that 
the 
problem 
of 
meaning 
is 
huge 
and 
confused; 
modestly, 
my 
detailed 
notes 
on 
a 
semantic 
theory, 
though 
still 
in 
progress, 
already 
occupy 
hundreds 
of 
pages. 
For 
the 
moment 
I 
acritically 
appeal 
to 
the 
reader’s 
intuitive 
meaning 
of 
“meaning”, 
provided 
he 
agrees 
that 
pieces 
of 


information 
(then 
meanings) 
are 
a 
question 
of 
neurons. 


1.2. 
Advanced 
natural 
languages 
possess 
splendid 
faculties 
of 
self-improvement. 
Nevertheless, 
obviously, 
the 
first 
steps 
of 
the 
improvements 
can 
only 
move 
from 
the 
not 
yet 
improved 
situation. 
So 
I 
feel 
myself 
like 
an 
electrician 
who, 
called 
to 
renovate 
a 
plant, 
uses 
the 
old 
one 
to 
illuminate 
his 
work. 
Anyhow 
the 
renovation 
that 
I 
will 
agree 
on 
in 
this 
book 
is 
limited 
to 
fill 
up 
the 
gaps 
whose 
filling 
up 
is 
necessary 
to 
achieve 
the 
purposed 
results. 
1.3. 
The 
concept 
of 
information 
is 
polyvalent 
(information 
about 
something, 
information 
as 
something 
et 
cetera). 
Here 
I 
do 
not 
analyze 
it; 
I 
simply 
specify 
with 
a 
propaedeutic 
aim 
what 
I 
mean 
when 
I 
speak 
of 
information. 
And 
since 
I 
think 
that 
many 
potential 
misunderstandings 
follow 
from 
a 
too 
ambitious 

schematization 
of 
highly 
complex 
universes 
of 
reference, 
for 
the 
moment 
I 
focalise 
the 
outcomes 
of 
tossing 
a 
standard 
die. 
The 
concept 
of 
information 
is 
strictly 
linked 
to 
the 
concept 
of 
knowledge 
or, 
even 
better, 
to 
the 
concept 
of 
ignorance. 
A 
(non-null) 
piece 
of 
information 
(concerning 
a 
certain 
phenomenon) 
is 
any 
acquirement 


reducing 
our 
ignorance 
about 
such 
a 
phenomenon. 
Let 
me 
toss 
the 
die 
and 
let 
me 
suppose 
that 
we 
attain 
only 
to 
see 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
resulting 
face, 
so 
ascertaining 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
dot. 
The 
possibility 
space 
W 
(that 
is 
the 
set 
of 
all 
alternative 
outcomes) 
is 
W 
={1,2,3,4,5,6}. 
Then 
our 
acquirement 
(a 
dot 
in 
the 
center 
of 
the 
face) 
is 
a 
(non-null) 
piece 
of 
information 
(concerning 
the 
toss 
under 
scrutiny) 
only 


because 
it 
allows 
to 
exclude 
2, 
4 
and 
6 
from 
W. 
In 
this 
sense 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
(concerning 
a 
certain 
possibility 
space) 
implies 
the 
reduction 
of 
the 
possible 
outcomes. 
Of 
course 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
we 
can 
draw 
from 
a 
certain 
acquirement 
depends 
also 
on 
our 


previous 
knowledge. 
We 
continue 
referring 
to 
the 
above 
mentioned 
W, 
but 
if 
in 
a 
standard 
die 
the 
dots 
of 
a 
face 
were 
the 
vertexes 
of 
the 
correspondent 
regular 
polygon, 
the 
same 
acquirement 
(a 
dot 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
face) 
would 
exclude 
3 
and 
5 
too, 
so 
allowing 
us 
to 
infer 
that 
the 
outcome 
is 
1. 
And 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
possibility 
space 
reduces 
itself 
to 
a 
single 
alternative, 
the 
outcomes 
cannot 
be 
further 
reduced 


(actually, 
once 
we 
know 
that 
the 
outcome 
is 
1, 
under 
W 
no 
further 
information 
about 
such 
a 
toss 
can 
be 
acquired). 
The 
sight 
of 
the 
whole 
face 
could 
only 
confirm 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
we 
already 
know 
(the 
central 
dot 
is 
the 
only 
one). 
Just 
on 
these 
grounds 
I 
say 
that 
the 
logic 
of 
information 
must 
be 
idempotent 
(§7.1.1). 


1.3.1. 
A 
pedantry. 
Above 
I 
wrote 
“under 
W 
no 
further 
information 
… 
can 
be 
acquired” 
to 
specify 
that 
the 
many 
further 
pieces 
of 
information 
we 
can 
acquire 
once 
we 
know 
that 
the 
outcome 
is 
1 
(as 
for 
instance 
the 
position 
of 
the 
die 
on 
the 
green 
baize) 
do 
not 
concern 
the 
possibility 
space 
under 
scrutiny, 
since 
it 
classify 
the 
different 
outcomes 
as 
regards 
exclusively 
the 
number 
of 
dots 
marked 
on 
the 
six 
faces. 
And 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
refer 
to 
a 
more 
complex 
possibility 
space, 
the 
outcome 
1 
contains 
a 
plurality 
of 
sub-alternatives, 
so 
then 
further 
information 
is 
possible. 
1.3.2. 
The 
possibility 
space 
approach 
could 
be 
replaced 
by 
a 
(Kripkean) 
possible 
worlds 
approach. 
Yet 
I 
strongly 
prefer 
the 
former 
because 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
our 
effective 
gnosiologic 
life 
refers 
spontaneously 
to 
only 
one 
world 
and 
to 
acquirements 
able 
to 
reduce 
our 
ignorance 
about 
possible 
outcomes 
(in 
other 
words: 
the 
possible 
worlds 
are 
nothing 
but 
a 
fictitious 
way 
to 
deal 
with 
possibility 
spaces 
born 
by 
our 
ignorance 
about 
the 
real 
one). 
1.4. 
If 
a 
is 
a 
state 
of 
affairs 
(for 
instance 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
dot 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
face) 
concerning 
the 
universe 
of 
discourse 
W, 
(the 
tossing 
of 
a 
standard 
die) 
then 
ka,g,t 
is 
the 
piece 
of 


information 
(the 
image, 
the 
neuronal 
pattern) 
the 
knower 
g 
possesses 
about 
a 
at 
the 
moment 
t. 
By 


“gg,t 
” 
I 
generically 
indicate 
the 
cognitive 
relation 
(for 
instance 
the 
sight 
of 
the 
central 
dot) 
between 
a 


and 
ka,g,t 
(ka,g,t 
= 
gg,t(a)). 
The 
W 
-g-t-statute 
is 
the 
union 
of 
the 
pieces 
of 
information 
about 
W 


possessed 
by 
g 
at 
t, 
that 
is, 
so 
written 
concisely, 
kW,g,t. 
(for 
instance 
the 
knowledge 
about 
the 
dots 
marking 
the 
various 
faces 
of 
a 
cube, 
about 
the 
tossing 
procedures 
et 
cetera). 
If 
we 
refer 
to 
an 
ideal 
knower 
ig 
(an 
auspicious 
acronym, 
indeed) 
the 
specifications 
“for 
g 
at 
t” 
can 
be 


omitted 
since, 
thanks 
to 
a 
hot 
line 
to 
God, 
an 
ideal 
statute 
is 
not 
subjected 
to 
chronologic 
or 
personal 
variations. 



1.5. 
The 
concepts 
of 
information 
and 
of 
communication 
are 
strictly 
related; 
in 
fact 
a 
communication 
can 
be 
defined 
as 
a 
process 
of 
transferring 
information. 
Yet 
the 
concept 
of 
information 
is 
extremely 
broader, 
since 
the 
main 
channel 
to 
acquire 
information 
(the 
only 
channel, 
for 
millions 
of 
years) 
is 
(was) 
quite 
independent 
of 
any 
communication 
(as 
in 
the 
example 
above). 
Then, 
while 
the 
concept 
of 
information 
implies 
the 
figure 
of 
a 
knower 
(or 
interpreter, 
or 
receiver) 
it 
does 
not 
imply 
the 
figure 
of 
a 
speaker 
(or 
sender). 
A 
sound 
reason 
to 
privilege 
the 
viewpoint 
of 
the 
interpreter. 
1.5.1. 
In 
Fedro, 
Plato 
argues 
in 
favour 
of 
spoken 
languages 
and 
against 
written 
ones. 
Without 
discussing 
the 
topic, 
here 
I 
agree 
that, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
my 
discourse 
will 
mainly 
focalize 
written 
languages. 
Therefore 
expressions 
like 
“speech 
act”, 
“utterance” 
et 
cetera 
will 
be 
used 
without 
any 
intrinsic 
reference 
to 
the 
phonic 
dimension. 
A 
systematic 
theorization 
of 
the 
matter 
will 
be 
proposed 
in 
a 
subsequent 
book 
specifically 
devoted 
to 
such 
a 
task. 
Here 
I 
only 
sketch 
a 
linguistic 
process 
of 
communication 
performed 
under 
the 
most 
simple 
conditions 
(so 
lies, 
mistakes 
of 
codification, 
noises, 
distrustful 
interpreters, 
emotional 
components 
et 
cetera 
are 
banned). 
In 
compliance 
with 
this 
frame 


to 
communicate 
is 
schematically 
analysed 
as 
a 
tetradic 
relation: 
someone 
(the 
speaker) 
communicates 
something 
(a 
piece 
of 
information), 
to 
someone 
(the 
interpreter) 
by 
means 
of 
something 
other 
(the 
uttered 
expression 
e). 
Incidentally: 
personal 
note-books 
(or, 
where 
non-verbal 
communications 
are 
admitted, 
knots 
to 


handkerchiefs) 
show 
that 
speaker 
and 
interpreter 
are 
not 
necessarily 
distinct 
persons; 
anyhow, 
even 
where 
the 
speaker 
is 
also 
the 
interpreter 
the 
relation 
continues 
being 
tetradic, 
exactly 
as 
the 
division 
of 
a 
number 
by 
itself 
continues 
being 
a 
dyadic 
operation. 


1.6. 
In 
order 
to 
speak 
of 
something 
we 
must 
use 
signs. 
Not 
only 
we 
can 
speak 
of 
the 
Koh-i-noor 
without 
exhibiting 
the 
diamond, 
but 
if 
we 
exhibit 
it, 
we 
are 
no 
longer 
speaking 
of 
it, 
we 
are 
exhibiting 
it. 
Signs 
are 
intrinsically 
means 
to 
adduce 
conventional 
information 
(“to 
adduce” 
is 
just 
the 
technical 
term 
to 
express 
the 
semantic 
relation 
s 
between 
a 
sign 
and 
the 
conventional 
piece 
of 
information 
it 
is 
the 


bearer 
of). 
Being 
the 
source 
of 
a 
s-relation 
is 
the 
essential 
requisite 
in 
order 
to 
be 
a 
sign 
(without 
such 


a 
requisite, 
a 
sign 
would 
only 
be 
a 
mute 
object 
merely 
displaying 
itself 
as 
a 
blade 
of 
grass 
in 
a 
meadow). 
The 
s-relation 
is 
necessarily 
mental: 
The 
linguistic 
faculty 
is 
just 
the 
mental 
faculty 
of 
stating 
conventional 
associations 
between 
arbitrary 
couples 
of 
informational 
nuclei. 
The 
best 
evidence 
is 
the 
sovereignty 
of 
the 
decision 
through 
which 
we 
can 
assume 
any 
object 
as 
a 
name 
of 
any 
other 
object; 
a 
sovereignty 
showed 
by 
the 
possibility 
of 
establishing 
such 
an 
assumption 
in 
complete 
darkness 
and 
silence 
and 
immobility. 


1.6.1. 
Any 
language 
is 
a 
code; 
then 
any 
codification 
or 
decodification 
depends 
on 
the 
language 
we 
are 
referring 
to. 
Yet 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
concision 
(cf. 
also 
§9.2 
below) 
I 
agree 
to 
make 
explicit 
such 
a 
reference 
only 
where 
the 
context 
could 
otherwise 
entail 
some 
ambiguity. 
Let 
e 
be 
a 
sentence 
(of 
a 
language 
L). 
I 
say 
that 
(in 
L) 
e 
adduces 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
hg,t 
iff 
in 
g 


at 
t 
a 
(mental) 
relation 
sg,t 
does 
exist 
such 
that 
sg,t(gg,t(e)) 
= 
hg,t. 
I 
call 
generically 
“semantic” 


the 
relation 
s. 


Of 
course 
the 
relativizations 
to 
g 
at 
t 
can 
be 
omitted 
where 
reference 
is 
made 
to 
the 
ideal 
knower. 



1.7. 
The 
basic 
process 
of 
communication 
can 
be 
roughly 
sketched 
as 
follows 
-the 
speaker 
g’ 
intends 
to 
communicate 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
hg’ 
-the 
speaker 
knows 
that 
hg 
is 
adduced 
by 
e 
(linguistic 
codification) 


-the 
speaker 
utters 
e 


-the 
interpreter 
g” 
reads 
e 


-the 
interpreter 
knows 
that 
e 
adduces 
hg” 
(linguistic 
decodification) 


-the 
interpreter 
acquires 
hg”. 
Thus 
a 
process 
of 
communication 
is 
partitioned 
in 
two 
stages. 
The 
enunciatory 
stage 
leads 
the 
speaker 
to 
find 
and 
to 
utter 
the 
expression 
adducing 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
to 
transmit, 
the 
interpretative 
stage 
leads 
the 
interpreter 
to 
draw 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
the 
expression 
he 
reads. 
Some 
comments. 


1.7.1. 
Of 
course 
the 
scheme 
above 
is 
oversimplified. 
In 
order 
to 
generalize 
it 
we 
ought 
, 
al 
least, 
-introduce 
chronological 
indexes 
(for 
instance 
the 
moment 
g” 
reads 
e 
may 
differ 
from 
the 
moment 
g’ 
utters 
it) 
-the 
speaker 
may 
adapt 
the 
enunciatery 
stage 
to 
the 
interpretative 
stage 
he 
presumes 
and 
vice 
versa 
et 
cetera. 
Yet 
these 
pedantries 
are 
of 
no 
moment 
in 
the 
present 
analysis 
whose 
only 
aim 
is 
emphasizing 
a 
clean 


distinction 
between 
signs 
(e) 
and 
pieces 
of 
information 
(h). 
Moreover 
a 
not 
less 
clean 
distinction 
is 
emphasized 
between 
pieces 
of 
information 
and 
referents. 
For 
instance 
the 
speaker 
may 
intend 
to 
communicate 
that 
it 
is 
raining 
quite 
independently 
of 
the 
actual 
meteorological 
situation. 


1.7.1.1. 
The 
same 
sketch 
can 
be 
easily 
conformed 
to 
peculiar 
situations. 
For 
instance 
situations 
where 
the 
message 
to 
communicate 
concerns 
in 
its 
turn 
a 
meaning, 
or 
where 
the 
code 
is 
non-verbal 
(a 
non-comprehension 
communicated 
by 
a 
grimace 
instances 
both). 
1.7.2. 
To 
speak 
of 
meanings 
is 
incompatible 
with 
an 
extensional 
approach. 
Indeed 
the 
severe 
war 
between 
extensionalists 
and 
intensionalists 
seems 
rather 
gratuitous 
to 
me. 
A 
bipartisan 
pantensionalist 
approach 
witnessing 
our 
actual 
and 
evolutionally 
tested 
gnosiologic 
procedures 
seems 
to 
me 
the 
best 
one. 
Just 
as 
the 
easiest 
way 
to 
analyse 
the 
opinion 
of 
a 
guard 
controlling 
the 
guests 
is 
extensional 
(the 
guard 
is 
called 
to 
ascertain 
whether 
the 
(name 
of 
the) 
person 
under 
scrutiny 
belongs 
to 
a 
list, 
quite 
independently 
of 
his/her 
underlying 
requisites), 
the 
easiest 
way 
to 
analyse 
my 
opinion 
about 
the 
little 
animal 
squatted 
beneath 
the 
bush 
is 
intensional 
(I 
think 
it 
is 
a 
rabbit 
because 
I 
saw 
that 
its 
physical 
connotations 
and 
its 
behaviour 
are 
characteristic 
of 
the 
species, 
surely 
not 
because 
I 
ascertained 
that 
it 
belongs 
to 
a 
set 
the 
majority 
of 
whose 
members 
are 
unknown 
to 
me). 


1.7.3. 
The 
speech 
acts 
we 
shall 
deal 
with 
are 
declarative, 
yet 
also 
performative 
speech 
acts 
(such 
as 
questions, 
commands 
and 
so 
on) 
concern 
processes 
of 
communication, 
since 
anyhow 
they 
adduce 
some 
piece 
of 
information 
(a 
question 
informs 
the 
interlocutor(s) 
that 
an 
answer 
about 
a 
certain 
argument 
is 
wished, 
an 
order 
informs 
the 
interlocutor(s) 
that 
a 
certain 
behaviour 
is 
required 
and 
so 
on). 
1.8. 
Usually, 
in 
a 
specific 
process 
of 
communication, 
an 
important 
role 
is 
played 
by 
what 
Nørretrander 
(1998) 
calls 
“exformation”, 
that 
is 
by 
the 
unexpressed 
body 
of 
knowledge 
the 
speaker 
and 
the 

interpreter 
share. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
the 
correct 
approach 
to 
the 
topic 
entails 
a 
clear 
distinction 
between 
-the 
piece 
of 
information 
constituting 
the 
strict 
(content 
of 
the) 
message 
-the 
piece 
of 
information 
which, 
on 
the 
ground 
of 
his 
previous 
statute, 
the 
interpreter 
can 
infer 
(I 
evoke 
the 
tossing 
of 
a 
die). 


The 
example 
of 
the 
dots 
marking 
the 
various 
faces 
is 
enlightening. 
If 
the 
speaker 
utters 


(1.i) 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
face 
is 
marked 
by 
a 
dot 
the 
interpreter 
infers 


(1.ii) 
the 
outcome 
is 
either 
1 
or 
3 
or 
5 
if 
he 
thinks 
that 
the 
faces 
are 
marked 
in 
the 
usual 
way, 
while 
he 
infers 


(1.iii) 
the 
outcome 
is 
1 
if 
he 
thinks 
that 
the 
faces 
3 
and 
5 
are 
marked 
in 
the 
vertexes 
of 
the 
respective 
regular 
polygon. 
And 
of 
course 
the 
speaker 
can 
be 
perfectly 
aware 
that 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
he 
transmitted 
is 
not 
the 
mere 


(1.i) 
but, 
according 
to 
the 
real 
disposition 
of 
the 
dots, 
it 
is 
(1.ii) 
or 
(1.iii). 
The 
intriguing 
study 
of 
the 
various 
intents 
moving 
the 
interpreter 
is 
here 
forbidden 
by 
the 
above 
agreed 
restrictive 
conditions. 
Once 
these 
considerations 
are 
extrapolated 
from 
the 
analytically 
classifiable 
possibility 
space 
of 
a 
die 
(then 
from 
a 
set 
of 
analytically 
foreseeable 
inferences) 
to 
the 
extremely 
complex 
possibility 
space 
of 
our 
old 
world, 
the 
concept 
of 
exformation 
tends 
to 
assume 
a 
less 
sharp 
profile. 
1.9. 
No 
care 
is 
wasted 
if 
it 
can 
preserve 
the 
interpretation 
of 
a 
text 
from 
ambiguities. 
The 
basic 
requisite 
is 
simple: 
not 
to 
entrust 
the 
same 
sign 
with 
different 
semantic 
tasks. 
That 
is, 
briefly: 
no 
homonymy 
bearer 
(no 
word 
adducing 
more 
meanings). 
Homonymy 
is 
our 
irreducible 
enemy, 
since 
as 
soon 
as 
an 
informational 
non-identity 
is 
hidden 
behind 
a 
signic 
identity, 
a 
potential 
source 
of 
incoherence 
is 
introduced 
in 
the 
process 
of 
communication. 
And 
the 
less 
clear 
our 
ideas 
about 
the 
various 
pieces 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
the 
sign 
are, 
the 
more 
insidious 
the 
homonymy 
is. 
In 
this 
sense 
the 
worst 
one 
is 
an 
autonymic 
homonymy, 
where 
the 
same 
sign 
is 
one 
of 
its 
possible 
referents. 
In 
the 
final 
chapter 
an 
astonishing 
example 
of 
the 
dangers 
born 
by 
an 
analogous 
context 
will 
be 
studied 
in 
detail. 


1.9.1. 
A 
less 
hasty 
analysis 
of 
homonymy 
bearers 
suggests 
a 
specification. 
While 
“sentence” 
is 
used 
to 
mean 
a 
syntactic 
entity 
(that 
is 
a 
concatenation 
of 
words 
respecting 
the 
well 
formation 
rules) 
and 
“proposition” 
is 
used 
to 
mean 
a 
semantic 
entity 
(that 
is 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
a 
sentence), 
“message” 
will 
be 
used 
to 
mean 
either 
a 
sentence 
or 
a 
proposition 
(so 
“message” 
is 
institutionally 
a 
homonymy 
bearer). 
I 
keep 
this 
double 
acceptation 
not 
because 
a 
homeopathic 
war 
against 
homonymy 
suddenly 
seduced 
me 
but 
because 
there 
are 
peculiar 
problems 
(for 
instance 
the 
problem 
concerning 
the 
objects 
of 
truth) 
whose 
discussion 
is 
highly 
assisted 
by 
some 
homonymy 


bearers; 
in 
fact 
only 
if 
the 
problem 
can 
be 
formulated 
by 
an 
ambiguous 
word, 
its 
solution 
is 
not 
anticipated 
by 
the 
same 
formulation. 



1.9.2. 
In 
natural 
languages 
homonymy 
bearers 
are 
very 
numerous. 
So 
then 
at 
first 
sight, 
it 
may 
seem 
a 
miracle 
that 
in 
our 
current 
linguistic 
practice 
we 
can 
deal 
with 
them 
without 
being 
continuously 
misled 
towards 
wrong 
interpretations. 
No 
miracle, 
since 
we 
are 
helped 
by 
the 
rule 
usually 
called 
“principle 
of 
charity”, 
according 
to 
which 
any 
sentence 
must 
be 
interpreted 
in 
the 
way 
optimizing 
the 
adduced 
meaning. 
I 
prefer 
to 
call 
“criterion 
of 
(interpretative) 
collaboration” 
such 
a 
rule 
and, 
above 
all, 
I 
wish 
to 
extrapolate 
its 
range 
to 
non-linguistic 
contributions 
too, 
since 
actually 
our 
interpretations 
are 
influenced 
by 
non-linguistic 
sources 
of 
information 
too. 
For 
instance 
(1.iv) 
I 
wish 
to 
buy 
a 
black 
pen 
is 
spontaneously 
(and 
correctly) 
interpreted 
in 
two 
different 
ways 
if 
(1.iv) 
is 
uttered 
in 
a 
swan-breeding 
or 
in 
a 
writing 
material 
shop. 
Analogously, 
since 
neither 
a 
female 
swan 
nor 
an 
instrument 
for 
ink 
writing 
can 
reasonably 
enclose 
a 
pig, 
the 
reading 
of 
Bob 
wishes 
to 
buy 
a 
pen 
to 
enclose 
his 
pig 
suggests 
the 
perplexed 
interpreter 
to 
ascertain 
whether 
“pen” 
adduces 
a 
third 
meaning; 
and 
actually 
any 
perplexity 
disappears 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
learns 
that 
a 
pen 
is 
also 
a 
small 
enclosure 
for 
animals. 


1.9.2.1. 
An 
even 
more 
evident 
application 
of 
(1.iv) 
concerns 
situations 
where 
the 
homonymy 
bearer 
has 
different 
syntactic 
statuses. 
For 
instance, 
both 
(1.v) 
Bob 
felt 
cold 
and 


(1.vi) 
Bob’s 
felt 
has 
been 
manufactured 
in 
France 
would 
be 
word 
salads 
if 
we 
should 
read 
“felt” 
as 
a 
substantive 
in 
(1.v) 
or 
as 
a 
voice 
of 
“to 
feel” 
in 
(1.vi). 
But 
by 
the 
simple 
fact 
that 
the 
two 
reciprocal 
readings 
lead 
to 
sensible 
statements, 
such 
readings 
are 
automatically 
assumed. 
Anyway 
the 
criterion 
of 
collaboration 
is 
peculiarly 
applied 
to 
homonymy 
bearers 
with 
a 
common 
syntactic 
status, 
that 
is 
situations 
where 
the 
possible 
interpretations 
concern 
an 
anyhow 
well 
formed 
sentence. 
The 
above 
decision 
(§1.6.1) 
to 
specify 
the 
language 
of 
reference 
only 
where 
necessary 
can 
be 


legitimated 
just 
by 
an 
appeal 
to 
the 
criterion 
of 
collaboration; 
since 
normally 
if 
we 
read 
in 
L1 
a 
proper 
L2-sentence, 
we 
face 
a 
senseless 
expression, 
it 
is 
our 
duty 
to 
choose 
the 
language 
the 
sentence 
under 
scrutiny 
belongs 
to. 


1.10. 
Under 
the 
current 
notations 
italics, 
though 
implicitly, 
is 
a 
polyvalent 
type. 
In 
fact, 
besides 
some 
fanciful 
applications 
I 
neglect, 
it 
is 
used 
-for 
symbolic 
expressions 
-for 
expressions 
to 
emphasize 
-for 
expressions 
belonging 
to 
foreign 
languages 
-for 
direct 
quotations 
(in 
the 
last 
chapter 
we 
shall 
see 
that 
italics 
is 
also 
the 
type 
Goedel 
chose 
for 
arithmetization). 
I 
disapprove 
of 
this 
multipurpose 
practice 
which, 
among 
other 
inconveniences, 
forbids 
focusing 
more 
subtle 
distinctions 
(for 
instance, 
direct 
quotations 
are 
a 
wide 
topic 
where 
heteroquotations 
ought 
to 
be 
distinguished 
from 
autoquotations, 
sub-quotations 
and 
so 
on). 
Nevertheless 
I 
will 
resign 
to 
follow 
that 



practice 
with 
the 
only 
exception 
of 
the 
bold 
type 
for 
expressions 
to 
emphasize. 
My 
resignation 
follows 
from 
the 
conviction 
that 
to 
introduce 
a 
really 
satisfying 
set 
of 
graphical 
conventions 
would 
mean 
to 
lose 
even 
the 
best 
disposed 
of 
my 
few 
readers. 
The 
aim 
of 
these 
simple 
considerations, 
then, 
is 
to 
remark 
that 
my 
decision 
is 
a 
bitter 
compromise. 


1.11. 
On 
the 
contrary 
I 
cannot 
accept 
the 
current 
diacritical 
notations, 
since 
they 
are 
quite 
insufficient 
for 
my 
requirements. 
To 
enrich 
them 
is 
an 
indispensable 
step 
towards 
refining 
any 
approach 
to 
logic. 
I 
realize 
that 
my 
claim 
is 
unusual 
and 
perhaps 
presumptuous 
(ideas 
are 
lacking, 
not 
the 
means 
to 
express 
them, 
annotated 
Leonardo); 
nevertheless 
I 
hope 
that 
the 
next 
pages 
will 
legitimate 
it. 
Indeed 
mankind 
did 
without 
zips 
when 
only 
buttons 
existed, 
and 
did 
without 
buttons 
too 
before 
their 
invention, 
yet 
even 
emperors 
got 
dressed; 
nevertheless 
so 
unquestionable 
an 
evidence 
neither 
entails 
that 
buttons 
and 
zips 
are 
useless, 
nor 
that 
a 
note 
like 
dresses 
are 
lacking, 
not 
the 
means 
to 
close 
them 
eliminates 
the 
problem. 
More 
than 
seventy 
years 
ago 
Morris, 
genially, 
denounced 
the 
poorness 
of 
the 
means 
by 
which 
natural 
languages 
can 
speak 
of 
themselves: 
but 
till 
now 
what 
improvements 
have 
been 
realized? 
And 
almost 
half 
a 
millennium 
ago 
Montaigne, 
genially, 
wrote: 
la 
plupart 
des 
troubles 
du 
mond 
sont 
grammariennes 
(the 
troubles 
of 
our 
world 
are 
for 
the 
most 
part 
grammatical). 
With 
the 
aggravating 
circumstance, 
nowadays, 
that 
symbolic 
troubles 
add 
themselves 
to 
grammatical 
ones. 
Indeed 
the 
incapacity 
for 
realizing 
the 
insufficiency 
of 
the 
current 
diacritical 
notations 
is 
born 
by 
the 
opacity 
(the 
flatness, 
let 
me 
repeat) 
of 
the 
perspective 
through 
which 
the 
whole 
gnosiology 
is 
studied. 
1.11.1. 
Also 
the 
worst 
symbolic 
convention, 
that 
is 
the 
universal 
habit 
according 
to 
which 
affirmation 
is 
expressed 
by 
omitting 
the 
symbol 
of 
negation, 
can 
be 
classified 
as 
a 
failure 
in 
the 
diacritical 
notations. 
1.12. 
Orthodoxy 
states 
that 
the 
first 
aim 
of 
a 
formalized 
language 
is 
to 
settle 
a 
clear 
pattern 
able 
to 
explain 
how 
natural 
languages 
work 
and 
to 
show 
their 
limits. 
Although 
in 
due 
course 
formalized 
languages 
will 
be 
used 
massively. 
I 
exhort 
the 
reader 
not 
to 
mythicize 
them: 
just 
as 
a 
definition 
cannot 
allow 
new 
theorems 
to 
be 
proven, 
a 
formalized 
language 
cannot 
open 
new 
heuristic 
horizons. 
In 
fact, 
if 
natural 
languages 
should 
be 
conditioned 
by 
some 
limits 
intrinsically 
permeating 
our 
mind, 
the 
same 
limits 
would 
condition 
too 
whatever 
artificial 
language 
we 
can 
elaborate; 
and 
if 
such 
limits 
can 
be 
bypassed, 
then 
we 
have 
the 
faculty 
of 
refining 
directly 
natural 
languages. 
Anyhow 
the 
final 
chapters 
will 
show 
that 
the 
main 
danger 
entailed 
by 
formalized 
languages 
is 
their 
absolute 
(yet 
only 
presumed) 
trustworthiness. 
1.12.1. 
A 
natural 
language 
can 
be 
compared 
to 
a 
house 
obtained 
by 
successive 
enlargements 
and 

repairs 
from 
a 
very 
old 
nucleus: 
it 
is 
not 
rationally 
disposed, 
is 
lacking 
of 
some 
comforts 
et 
cetera, 
nevertheless 
the 
centuries 
of 
its 
story 
gave 
it 
an 
already 
tested 
usableness. 
A 
formalized 
language, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
can 
be 
compared 
to 
an 
aseptic 
scale 
model 
very 
fit 
for 
certain 
applications, 
but 
surely 
unfit 
for 
lodging. 
evacuees. 


1.12.2. 
Incidentally. 
The 
current 
claim 
that 
our 
thinking 
activity 
is 
necessarily 
linguistic 
seems 
to 
me 
radically 
untenable: 
if 
it 
were, 
by 
what 
kind 
of 
activity 
should 
natural 
languages 
be 
born? 

CHAPTER 
2 
DIACRITIC 
SYMBOLOGY 


Philip 
of 
Macedonia, 
warned 
by 
the 
oracle 
to 
beware 
of 
quadrigae, 
ordered 
their 
destruction 
and 
even 
avoided 
the 
so 
called 
region, 
nevertheless 
he 
was 
stabbed 
by 
Pausania’s 
dagger, 
whose 
hilt 
represented 
a 
quadriga. 
Object, 
name, 
representation. 


2.1. 
Diacritical 
and 
syncathegorematic 
symbology 
is 
a 
rather 
neglected 
matter 
although 
its 
shortcomings 
are 
much 
more 
detrimental 
than 
the 
shortcomings 
of 
the 
terminological 
endowment. 
For 
instance, 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
like 
a 
grotesquery 
that 
the 
English 
lexicon 
is 
so 
rich 
in 
terms 
expressing 
chromatic 
properties 
or 
fighting 
actions 
and 
so 
poor 
in 
terms 
expressing 
propositional 
connectives 
(disjunctions, 
in 
particular). 
Maliciously, 
I 
might 
suppose 
that 
the 
more 
ambiguous 
is 
a 
symbology, 
the 
more 
easy 
is 
to 
hide 
behind 
its 
ambiguity 
an 
insufficient 
perspicuity. 
Mindful 
of 
the 
mentioned 
Morris’s 
complaint 
I 
start 
improving 
the 
‘metalinguistic’ 
symbology. 


2.1.1. 
The 
meticulous 
analysis 
of 
the 
distinction 
between 
tokens 
and 
types 
(Peirce), 
that 
is 
the 
distinction 
between 
sign 
event 
and 
sign 
design 
(Carnap) 
is 
deferred 
to 
the 
next 
chapter. 
For 
the 
present 
I 
speak 
of 
a 
word 
to 
mean 
just 
the 
type, 
that 
is 
the 
abstract 
syntactical 
entity 
whose 
instances 
are 
its 
various 
tokens. 
2.2. 
In 
§1 
above 
I 
enclosed 
(2.i) 
metalinguistic 
within 
single 
inverted 
commas 
to 
mean 
that 
(2.ii) 
metalanguage 
is 
a 
rough 
notion. 
Awaiting 
for 
a 
better 
convention 
I 
assume 
dialanguage 
as 
a 
synonym 
of 
(2.ii) 
in 
such 
a 
rough 
acceptation, 
and 
hyphens 
as 
a 
dialinguistic 
operator. 
I 
make 
my 
point 
clearer. 
2.2.1. 
The 
scholastic 
distinction 
between 
suppositio 
materialis 
and 
suppositio 
formalis 
is 
the 
distinction 
between 
use 
and 
mention. 
For 
instance 
(2.iii) 
indulgent 
is 
used 
in 


(2.iv) 
Bob 
is 
indulgent 
since 
(2.iv) 
speaks 
of 
Bob’s 
indulgence; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
both 
in 



(2.v) 
-indulgent-is 
trisyllabic 
and 
in 
(2.vi) 
-indulgent-is 
commendatory 
-indulgent-is 
mentioned. 
According 
to 
the 
current 
symbology, 
hyphens 
could 
be 
substituted 
by 
quotation 
marks 
(“...”) 
both 
in 
(2.v) 
and 
in 
(2.vi); 
but 
I 
claim 
that 
this 
procedure 
is 
deeply 
misleading, 
since 
what 
(2.v) 
speaks 
of 
(a 
word, 
a 
syntactic 
entity) 
is 
not 
what 
(2.vi) 
speaks 
of 
(a 
meaning, 
a 
semantic 
entity). 
In 
fact, 
just 
as 


(2.vii) 
“indulgent” 
is 
trisyllabic 
is 
an 
unexceptionable 
statement, 
and 
the 
meaning 
of 
“indulgent” 
is 
trisyllabic 
is 
a 
senseless 
one 
(better: 
a 
sortally 
improper 
one) 
because 
meanings 
are 
not 
syllabic 
entities, 
the 
meaning 
of 
“indulgent” 
is 
commendatory 
is 
an 
unexceptionable 
statement, 
and 
(2.viii) 
“indulgent” 
is 
commendatory 
is 
a 
sortally 
improper 
one. 
In 
order 
to 
prove 
this 
last 
issue, 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
replace 
(2.iii) 
with 


(2.ix) 
fond 
and 
to 
remember 
the 
archaic 
meaning 
(-silly-) 
of 
(2.ix); 
since 
this 
meaning 
is 
not 
at 
all 
commendatory, 


if 
we 
insist 
claiming 
that 
the 
predicate 
refers 
to 
the 
word, 
we 
cannot 
avoid 
deriving 
“fond” 
is 
commendatory 
and 
not 
commendatory 


so 
falling 
into 
incoherence. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
acknowledge 
that 
commendatory 


refers 
to 
meanings 
and 
that 
(2.ix) 
adduces 
two 
different 
meanings, 
the 
present 
meaning 
of 
“fond” 
is 
commendatory 



and 


the 
archaic 
meaning 
of 
“fond” 
is 
not 
commendatory 
become 
two 
sortally 
proper 
(and 
even 
true) 
statements. 


2.2.2. 
To 
realize 
that 
we 
mention 
a 
linguistic 
entity 
with 
reference 
sometimes 
to 
the 
word 
and 
sometimes 
to 
its 
meaning 
(that 
is 
to 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
the 
same 
word) 
is 
so 
fundamental 
an 
achievement 
that 
I 
try 
to 
impress 
it 
through 
another 
example. 
The 
editor 
is 
criticizing 
the 
too 
inflamed 
tones 
of 
an 
article: 
-pusillanimous-is 
offensive 


he 
says, 
suggesting 
the 
choice 
of 
a 
more 
moderate 
adjective. 
Yet 
the 
editor 
is 
referring 
to 
a 
meaning; 
in 
fact 
to 
substitute 
“pusillanimous” 
with 
“coward” 
would 
be 
derisive, 
since 
the 
change 
of 
the 
word 
would 
not 
entail 
any 
change 
in 
the 
meaning. 


2.3. 
On 
this 
ground 
I 
say 
that 
a 
statement 
-is 
protolinguistic 
iff 
it 
does 
not 
concern 
a 
linguistic 
referent 
(giving 
“linguistic” 
its 
widest 
acceptation) 
-is 
dialinguistic 
iff 
it 
does 
concern 
a 
linguistic 
referent. 
Then, 
for 
instance, 
while 
(2.iv) 
is 
a 
protolinguistic 
statement, 
(2.v) 
and 
(2.vi) 
are 
dialinguistic 
ones. 
Moreover 
I 
say 
that 
a 
dialinguistic 
statement 
-is 
metalinguistic 
iff 
, 
just 
as 
(2.v), 
it 
concerns 
a 
syntactic 
referent 
(an 
expression) 
-is 
hyperlinguistic 
iff, 
just 
as 
(2.vi), 
it 
concerns 
a 
semantic 
referent 
(a 
piece 
of 
information, 
a 
meaning). 
Analogously 
I 
speak 
of 
the 
protolinguistic 
(or 
dialinguistic, 
metalinguistic, 
hyperlinguistic) 
faculties 
of 
a 
language. 
2.4. 
I 
call 
“asterisks” 
the 
(mute) 
symbol 
* 
... 
* 
and 
I 
agree 
that 
asterisks 
are 
an 
abbreviation 
of 


(2.x) 
the 
meaning 
of 
“ 
... 
” 
(that 
is: 
I 
introduce 
asterisks 
as 
a 
semantic 
symbol, 
just 
as 
quotation 
marks 
are 
a 
syntactic 
symbol 
and 
hyphens 
are 
a 
bivalent, 
therefore 
an 
ambiguous 
symbol). 
Consequently, 
for 
instance 
(2.xi) 
*indulgent* 
is 
commendatory 
is 
the 
accurate 
symbolization 
of 
(2.vi). 
There 
are 
two 
alternatives 
to 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
specific 
(and 
mute) 
semantic 
symbol, 
and 
precisely 
-to 
continue 
accepting 
quotation 
marks 
as 
an 
ambiguous 
symbol 
whose 
interpretation 
is 
sometimes 
syntactic 
(to 
mean 
the 
enclosed 
expression) 
and 
sometimes 
semantic 
(to 
mean 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
the 
enclosed 
expression) 
-to 
use 
an 
explicit 
formulation 
like 
(2.x). 
Yet 
both 
of 
them 
are 
unsatisfactory. 
The 
former 
because 
it 
does 
not 
overcome 
a 
general 
ambiguity, 
therefore 
it 
does 
not 
allow 
the 
great 
theoretical 
advantages 
we 
can 
draw 
from 
an 
accurate 
symbology. 



The 
latter 
because 
it 
does 
not 
account 
for 
the 
evidence 
that 
sentences 
like 
(2.v), 
where 
no 
“the 
meaning 
of” 
occurs, 
are 
perfectly 
grammatical 
in 
our 
usual 
practice. 
In 
other 
words: 
to 
introduce 
a 
periphrasis 
would 
not 
account 
for 
the 
silent 
ambiguity 
hidden 
under 
the 
lacking 
distinction 
between 
a 
metainguistic 
and 
a 
hyperlinguistic 
mention. 
Only 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
mute 
symbol 
different 
from 
the 
metalinguistic 
one 
can 
overcome 
the 
ambiguity 
affecting 
current 
languages; 
in 
this 
sense 
while 
(2.viii) 
is 
a 
wrong 
translation 
of 
(2.vi), 
(2.xi) 
is 
the 
right 
one. 


2.4.1. 
The 
tripartition 
sign-meaning-referent 
(starting 
from 
the 
lekton 
of 
the 
Stoicism 
until 
the 
triangle 
of 
Ogden 
and 
Richard) 
is 
well 
known. 
Asterisks 
fulfil 
a 
symbolic 
lack, 
so 
satisfying 
the 
mentioned 
Morris’s 
remark 
and, 
above 
all, 
so 
contributing 
to 
a 
clarification 
of 
our 
ideas 
about 
a 
very 
insidious 
topic. 
2.4.2. 
An 
easy 
analogy. 
Besides 
using 
(spending) 
a 
banknote, 
people 
can 
speak 
of 
it. 
But 
while 
a 
discourse 
between 
two 
mint 
technicians 
appreciating 
its 
filigree 
is 
‘syntactic’, 
a 
discourse 
between 
two 
housewives 
complaining 
its 
poor 
purchasing 
power 
is 
‘semantic’. 
2.4.3. 
Here 
I 
could 
exhibit 
a 
lot 
of 
illustrious 
quotations 
where 
the 
lack 
of 
a 
semantic 
symbol 
constraints 
the 
authors 
to 
untenable 
formulations. 
I 
avoid 
it 
mainly 
because 
I 
am 
interested 
in 
exposing 
my 
ideas, 
not 
in 
censuring 
methodically 
other 
people’s 
ones. 
Such 
a 
censure 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
only 
when 
necessary 
to 
support 
mine, 
and 
anyhow 
without 
any 
gossipy 
pleasure 
(in 
the 
most 
tedious 
way, 
then). 
Yet, 
if 
I 
were 
quite 
frank, 
I 
ought 
to 
confess 
that 
the 
strongest 
reason 
is 
the 
hope 
that 
my 
liberal 
attitude 
be 
reciprocated. 
2.5. 
All 
the 
dialinguistic 
symbols 
(hyphens, 
quotation 
marks 
and 
asterisks) 
have 
a 
substantivizing 
effect. 
For 
instance 
(§2.7 
as 
for 
the 
use 
of 
new 
lines) 
indulgent 


is 
an 
adjective, 
but 


-indulgent-“indulgent” 
*indulgent* 


are 
substantives; 
the 
same 
syntactic 
well 
formation 
of 
(2.v), 
(2.vii) 
and 
(2.xi) 
legitimates 
this 
conclusion. 
The 
obvious 
reason 
is 
that 
if 
we 
speak 
of 
words 
or 
of 
meanings, 
we 
speak 
of 
objects, 
therefore 
we 
need 
nouns. 


2.5.1. 
The 
distinction 
between 
metalanguages 
and 
hyperlanguages, 
of 
course, 
is 
not 
the 
well 
known 
distinction 
between 
different 
metalinguistic 
orders. 
For 
instance 
“indulgent” 
is 
an 
adjective 


is 
a 
true 
metalinguistic 
statement 
and 


“ 
“indulgent” 
” 
is 
a 
substantive 



is 
a 
true 
meta-metalinguistic 
statement, 
but 
surely 
it 
is 
not 
a 
hyperlinguistic 
statement, 
since 
it 
does 
not 
concern 
semantics. 


2.5.2. 
Dialinguistic 
symbols 
are 
freely 
concatenable. 
For 
instance 
“ 
*nor* 
” 
is 
a 
substantive 
is 
a 
formally 
correct 
(and 
true) 
statement 
saying 
that 
the 
expression 
obtained 
by 
enclosing 
between 
asterisks 
nor 


is 
a 
substantive 
naming 
the 
meaning 
of 
that 
conjunction. 
More 
about 
this 
point 
in 
§3.4. 


2.5.3. 
There 
are 
contexts 
where 
the 
clear 
distinction 
between 
quotation 
marks 
and 
asterisks 
is 
nearly 
impossible, 
just 
owing 
to 
the 
ambiguity 
of 
the 
message.. 
For 
instance, 
strictly, 
(2.xii) 
hyper 
derives 
from 
uper 
is 
a 
syntactically 
incorrect 
sentence 
(it 
is 
a 
word 
salad) 
since 
the 
first 
and 
the 
last 
words 
are 
prefixes, 
not 
substantives; 
and 
the 
mere 
criterion 
of 
interpretative 
collaboration 
makes 
(2.xii) 
understandable. 
Yet 
both 


“hyper” 
derives 
from 
“uper” 


and 


*hyper* 
derives 
from 
*uper* 


are 
tenable 
correct 
formulations; 
while 
the 
former 
speaks 
of 
a 
historical 
link 
between 
signs, 
the 
latter 
speaks 
of 
a 
historical 
link 
between 
notions. 
The 
interesting 
peculiarity 
of 
(2.xii) 
is 
that 
the 
lack 
of 
a 
dialinguistic 
symbol, 
superficially, 
seems 
to 
concern 
only 
the 
first 
word, 
because 
the 
typographical 


peculiarities 
of 
the 
last 
word 
(the 
Greek 
type) 
favours 
(even 
improperly) 
its 
objectification. 
In 
other 
words, 
though 
“hyper” 
derives 
from 
uper 


instances 
a 
syntactically 
incorrect 
expression 
too, 
such 
a 
kind 
of 
incorrectness 
is 
rather 
current. 


2.6. 
Cartesius 
taught 
us 
that 
the 
existence 
of 
our 
mental 
activity 
is 
even 
more 
unquestionable 
than 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
world 
around 
us. 
And 
a 
mental 
activity 
is 
the 
most 
essential 
factor 
in 
any 
linguistic 
process. 
In 
this 
sense 
to 
neglect 
such 
a 
factor 
entails 
the 
‘topological 
deformation’ 
(from 
tridimensionality 
to 
bidensionality) 
already 
denounced 
(§1.1). 
The 
worrying 
meta 
consideration 
is 
that 
the 
tacit 
acceptation 
of 
the 
inadequateness 
affecting 
the 
current 
(natural 
and 
artificial) 
languages 
reveals 
the 
intrinsic 
poorness 
of 
the 
ideas 
leading 
the 
approach. 
A 
poorness 
particularly 
prejudicial 
for 
logic, 
because 
to 
reason 
on 
the 
logos 
is 
necessarily 
to 
reason 
dialinguistically. 
First 
of 
all, 
in 
order 
to 
bridge 



the 
gap 
we 
must 
recognize 
that, 
besides 
the 
suppositio 
materialis 
and 
the 
suppositio 
formalis, 
a 


suppositio 
informationalis 
is 
also 
necessary 
(I 
apologize 
for 
the 
disconcerting 
expression, 
but 
more 
or 
less 
all 
new 
expressions, 
at 
their 
start, 
are 
disconcerting). 
Asterisks 
are 
just 
the 
first 
step 
to 
reaching 
this 
goal. 


2.7. 
A 
very 
precious 
dialinguistic 
operator 
(whose 
detailed 
analysis, 
as 
far 
as 
I 
know, 
has 
never 
been 
proposed) 
is 
represented 
by 
the 
new 
line. 
In 
the 
current 
linguistic 
practice 
the 
new 
line 
is 
a 
highly 
polyvalent 
operator; 
the 
paradigm 
of 
its 
various 
functions 
follows. 
2.7.1. 
The 
metalingustic 
use 
of 
a 
new 
line 
is 
exemplified 
by 
(2.i), 
since 
what 
can 
be 
enclosed 
within 
single 
inverted 
commas 
is 
an 
expression, 
not 
a 
meaning. 
A 
metalinguistic 
new 
line, 
of 
course, 
is 
an 
alternative 
to 
quotation 
marks; 
and 
actually 
(though 
at 
first 
sight 
more 
equivocal) 
(2.xiii) 
In 
§1 
I 
enclosed 
“metalinguistic” 
within 
single 
inverted 
commas 
is 
a 
perfectly 
equivalent 
formulation 
(a 
pedantry: 
the 
same 
(2.xiii) 
is 
a 
new 
example 
of 
a 
metalinguistic 
new 
line, 
since 
it 
is 
used 
to 
speak 
of 
a 
formulation). 
The 
comparison 
between 
(2.i) 
and 
(2.xiii) 
emphasizes 
that 
new 
lines, 
just 
because 
they 
consist 
of 
a 
spatial 
disposition 
without 
any 
intervention 
of 
graphic 
elements, 
are 
the 
cleanest 
dialinguistic 
operator. 
2.7.2. 
The 
hyperlingustic 
use 
of 
a 
new 
line 
is 
exemplified 
by 
(2.ii) 
since 
what 
can 
be 
a 
rough 
notion 
is 
a 
meaning, 
not 
a 
sign. 
A 
hyperlinguistic 
new 
line, 
of 
course, 
is 
an 
alternative 
to 
asterisks; 
and 
actually 
(2.xiv) 
*metalanguage* 
is 
a 
rough 
notion 
is 
an 
alternative 
formulation 
(a 
pedantry: 
(2.xiv) 
too 
is 
an 
example 
of 
a 
metalinguistic 
new 
line, 
since 
it 
too 
speaks 
of 
a 
formulation). 


2.7.3. 
The 
ambiguous 
dialinguistic 
use 
of 
a 
new 
line 
can 
be 
instanced 
by 
writing 
that 
Bob 
bought 
a 
pen. 


is 
the 
message 
under 
scrutiny; 
in 
fact 
the 
same 
ambiguity 
of 
*message* 
forbids 
a 
specifically 
metalinguistic 
or 
hyperlinguistic 
interpretation 
of 
the 
new 
line. 
In 
this 
ambiguous 
use, 
the 
new 
line 
can 
be 
replaced 
by 
hyphens. 


2.7.4. 
The 
mere 
emphasizing 
(therefore 
protolinguistic) 
use 
of 
a 
new 
line 
can 
be 
exemplified 
by 
enclosing 
(2.i) 
between 
quotation 
marks 
or 
(2.ii) 
between 
asterisks; 
in 
these 
new 
formulations 
the 
new 
line 
becomes 
only 
an 
emphasizing 
operator 
devoid 
of 
any 
dialinguistic 
import. 
2.7.5. 
A 
new 
line 
is 
sometimes 
recycled, 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
a 
further 
reference 
may 
change 
the 
original 
use. 
A 
clear 
example 
is 
in 
Chapter 
1, 
where 
(2.i) 
is 
introduced 
as 
a 
metalinguistic 
new 
line 
(if 
the 
speaker 
utters 
(1.i) 
...) 
but 
few 
lines 
below 
is 
recycled 
hyperlinguistically 
(the 
piece 
of 
information... 
(1.i) 
...). 
Did 
the 
reader 
realize 
it? 
2.7.6. 
Of 
course, 
owing 
to 
the 
proliferation 
of 
their 
different 
uses, 
new 
lines, 
so 
to 
say, 
are 
strong 
homonymy 
bearers. 
Yet 
a 
homonymy 
bearer 
can 
act 
as 
a 
catalyser 
of 
incoherence 
only 
on 
condition 

that 
we 
are 
unaware 
of 
its 
status. 
And 
the 
proposed 
analysis 
not 
only 
allows 
us 
to 
exclude 
any 
risk 
of 
unawareness; 
it 
stimulates 
too 
a 
critical 
interpretation 
of 
the 
various 
new 
lines 
occurring 
in 
the 
text 
(for 
instance 
the 
new 
lines 
of 
§2.5, 
§2.5.1, 
§2.5.2). 
Anyway, 
in 
order 
to 
help 
the 
reader, 
from 
the 
start 
I 
will 
comment 
on 
the 
more 
interesting 
applications. 


2.8. 
A 
meaning 
postulate 
(Carnap) 
associates 
a 
certain 
piece 
of 
information 
to 
a 
certain 
word, 
and 
in 
§1.6.1 
I 
called 
“semantic” 
(symbolically 
“s”) 
the 
respective 
relation. 
Obviously 
different 
languages 
(different 
linguistic 
codes) 
may 
associate 
different 
meanings 
to 
a 
same 
word. 
For 
instance 
“largo” 
adduces 
*long* 
in 
Spanish 
(S) 
and 
*broad* 
in 
Italian 
(I). 
Therefore 
(2.xv) 
*largo* 
(metalinguistic 
new 
line) 
is 
an 
elliptic 
expression 
since 
the 
omission 
of 
the 
linguistic 
code 
does 
not 


allow 
to 
single 
out 
the 
meaning 
(2.xv) 
speaks 
of. 
In 
order 
to 
overcome 
this 
ambiguity 
I 
agree 
that 
asterisks 
must 
be 
completed 
by 
an 
index 
specifying 
the 
linguistic 
code 
of 
reference; 
accordingly 
*largo*S 
= 
*lungo*I 
= 
*long*E 
is 
a 
sentence 
where 
the 
agreement 
is 
applied. 
Another 
way 
to 
present 
the 
same 
passage 
is 
refering 
the 
index 
to 
the 
s-relations, 
so 
writing 


sS(“largo”)=sI(“lungo”) 
=sE(“long”) 
in 
order 
to 
mean 
that 
the 
informational 
nucleus 
associated 
in 
Spanish 
with 
“largo” 


(merely 
emphasizing 
new 
line 
which 
becomes 
a 
metalinguistic 
new 
line 
if 
we 
cancel 
the 
pair 
of 
quotation 
marks) 
is 
the 
same 
associated 
in 
Italian 
with 
“lungo” 
et 
cetera. 
In 
other 
words: 
the 
English 
code 
book 
assigns 
to 
“long” 
the 
same 
attribute 
(characteristic, 
quality) 
the 
Spanish 
code 
book 
assigns 


to 
“largo” 
et 
cetera. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
concision 
the 
index 
may 
be 
omitted 
when 
the 
linguistic 
code 
of 
reference 
is 
the 
contextual 
one 
(English, 
in 
this 
case). 


2.8.1. 
Here 
too 
homonymy 
is 
a 
disagreeable 
enemy; 
in 
fact, 
for 
instance, 
in 
spite 
of 
its 
index, 
(2.xvi) 
*sole*E 
is 
an 
ambiguous 
expression, 
since 
in 
English 
“sole” 
is 
a 
homonymy 
bearer. 
A 
first 
way 
out 
from 
this 
impasse 
is 
the 
appeal 
to 
another 
language 
where 
the 
various 
meanings 
are 
adduced 
by 
different 
words, 
as, 
with 
reference 
to 
(2.xvi), 


*solo*I 
(alone) 


*suola*I 
(bottom 
of 
a 
shoe) 
and 


*sogliola*I 
(flatfish). 



Reciprocally 
as 
for 


(2.xvii) 
*lira*I 
(*lyre* 
and 
*lira*). 
A 
second 
way 
out 
is 
the 
enrichment 
of 
the 
homonymy 
bearer 
by 
different 
graphic 
elements. 
So, 
for 
instance, 
the 
ambiguity 
of 
(2.xvii) 
disappears 
as 
soon 
as 
a 
“lira0” 
(that 
of 
course, 
owing 
to 
the 
index, 


would 
name 
my 
troubled 
national 
(ex)currency) 
were 
distinguished 
from 
a 
“lira1” 
(that 
would 
name 
the 
musical 
instrument 
played 
by 
Nero). 
Anyhow, 
since 
these 
minutiae 
do 
not 
influence 
my 
discourse, 
I 
remarked 
them 
only 
to 
underline 
(meta-theoretically) 
that 
also 
expressions 
like 


the 
meaning 
of 
“...” 
in 
L 


or 
like 


the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
“...” 
in 
L 


are 
ambiguous 
when 
the 
expression 
within 
inverted 
commas 
is 
a 
homonymy 
bearer 
in 
L. 


2.9. 
Owing 
to 
the 
crucial 
role 
of 
asterisks 
I 
pay 
attention 
to 
the 
following 
objection. 
There 
is 
no 
necessity 
to 
introduce 
a 
semantic 
symbol 
because 
even 
if 
actually 
some 
attributes 
pertain 
to 
meanings, 
no 
one 
can 
forbid 
us 
from 
defining 
their 
correspondents 
pertaining 
to 
the 
respective 
words: 
For 
instance, 
we 
can 
define 
(2.xviii) 
commendophorous 
(ambiguous 
new 
line, 
since 
we 
have 
not 
yet 
specified 
whether 
words 
or 
meanings 
are 
the 
real 
objects 
of 
definitions) 
by 
agreeing 
that 
an 
adjective 
is 
commendophorous 
iff 
its 
meaning 
(iff 
the 
attribute 
it 
adduces) 
is 
commendatory. 
Then 
the 
message 
transmitted 
by 
(2.xi) 
is 
also 
transmitted 
by 


(2.xix) 
“indulgent” 
is 
commendophorous 
and 
(2.xix) 
allows 
us 
to 
reason 
unobjectionably 
on 
signs, 
thus 
rendering 
asterisks 
a 
superfluous 
device. 
As 
we 
shall 
see, 
the 
objection 
is 
very 
momentous; 
yet 
my 
first 
reply 
is 
playful. 
Ava, 
Bob’s 
wife, 
is 
suspected 
of 
conjugal 
infidelity 
by 
her 
father-in-law 
Anyl 
(nomen 
omen). 
Indeed 
he 
thinks 
that 
a 
true 
gentleman 
cannot 
pay 
a 
detective 
to 
shadow 
a 
lady; 
then, 
since 
notoriously 
if 
a 
wife 
is 
conjugally 
infidel 
her 
husband 
is 
a 
cuckold, 
Anyl 
commissions 
the 
detective 
to 
shadow 
Bob 
in 
order 
to 
ascertain 
his 
eventual 
cuckoldness. 
What 
of 
Anyl’s 
idea? 


2.9.1. 
Awaiting 
for 
a 
stricter 
approach 
to 
the 
notion 
of 
a 
dilemma 
(§6.7), 
here 
I 
recall 
Frege’s 
notion 
of 
a 
Satzfrage: 
a 
Satzfrage 
contains 
a 
demand 
that 
we 
should 
either 
aknowledge 
the 
truth 
or 
reject 
it 
as 

false 
[Black 
and 
Geach, 
1960]. 
Roughly, 
a 
dilemma 
is 
the 
cognitional 
situation 
where 
two 
opposite 
alternatives 
(the 
horns 
of 
the 
dilemma) 
are 
considered, 
but 
none 
of 
them 
is 
asserted. 
So, 
for 
instance 


(2.xx) 
is 
Ava 
an 
infidel 
wife? 
is 
Anyl’s 
dilemma 
(the 
interrogation 
point 
is 
the 
spontaneous 
symbol 
to 
express 
a 
dilemma). 
The 
(right 
or 
wrong) 
solution 
of 
a 
dilemma 
is 
the 
assignation 
of 
a 
‘truth-value’ 
to 
its 
horns. 
The 
(basic) 
datum 
of 
a 
dilemma 
is 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
on 
whose 
ground 
the 
solution 
is 
attained. 


The 
core 
of 
a 
dilemma 
is 
the 
fact 
whose 
knowledge 
constitutes 
the 
(basic) 
datum. 
Therefore, 
while 
the 
core 
of 
Anyl’dilemma 
is 
Ava’s 
behaviour, 
the 
datum 
is 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
on 
whose 
ground 
one 
horn 
of 
the 
dilemma 
is 
(rightly 
or 
wrongly) 
asserted. 
Evidently 
*core* 
and 
*datum* 
are 
two 
different 
notions; 
an 
easy 
way 
to 
understand 
the 
difference 
is 
to 
think 
of 
a 
untrustworthy 
detective 
who, 
instead 
of 
pursuing 
the 
datum 
of 
Anyl’s 
dilemma, 
would 
pursue 
its 
core 
on 
his 
own 
account. 


2.9.2. 
If 
the 
reality 
were 
made 
of 
monads, 
a 
dilemma 
could 
be 
proposed 
only 
by 
focusing 
on 
the 
concerned 
monad. 
Reality 
is 
an 
interrelated 
network 
of 
nearly 
unconceivable 
fineness, 
and 
just 
owing 
to 
these 
interrelations 
we 
can 
formulate 
various 
dilemmas 
whose 
core 
(then 
whose 
datum) 
is 
anyhow 
the 
same 
(I 
recall 
the 
Aristotelian 
pollakos 
legomenon, 
that 
is 
what 
can 
be 
said 
in 
many 
ways). 
In 
this 
sense 
to 
define 
consequent 
properties 
pertaining 
to 
Ava’s 
husband 
(is 
he 
a 
cuckold?) 
or 
to 
her 
sons 
(are 
they 
sons 
of 
a 
promiscuous 
woman?) 
and 
so 
on, 
is 
a 
procedure 
which 
modifies 
only 
the 
superficial 
aspect 
of 
the 
discourse, 
since 
they 
all 
depend 
on 
the 
same 
factual 
evidence 
(they 
all 
concern 
Ava’s 
corporeal 
liberality, 
which 
is 
anyhow 
the 
common 
core 
of 
all 
dilemmas). 
The 
theoretically 
momentous 
distinction 
between 
pertinence 
and 
regard 
(of 
an 
attribute) 
is 
based 
just 
on 
this 
discriminating 
element. 
So, 
for 
instance, 
we 
say 
that 
cuckoldness 
pertains 
to 
husbands, 
but 
regards 
wifes. 
Consequently, 
among 
the 
various 
dilemmas 
concerning 
the 
same 
core, 
we 
can 
privilege 
the 
one 
where 
pertinence 
and 
regard 
coincide, 
that 
is, 
in 
the 
contingency, 
(2.xx). 
Coming 
back 
to 
the 
objection 
of 
§2.9, 
(2.xviii) 
legitimately 
defines 
an 
attribute 
pertaining 
to 
adjectives, 
yet 
no 
definition 
can 
modify 
the 
core 
of 
the 
respective 
dilemma, 
whose 
solution 
continues 
depending 
on 
the 
commendableness 
of 
the 
attribute 
adduced 
by 
the 
adjective 
whose 
‘commendophorablesness’ 
we 
have 
to 
ascertain. 
Then 
, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
considerations 
proposed 
in 
§2.4, 
the 
use 
of 
a 
mute 
semantic 
symbol 
is 
not 
by-passable. 


2.10. 
Synonymy 
is 
another 
topic 
directly 
affected 
by 
the 
mentioned 
distinction. 
In 
fact, 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
realize 
that 
any 
formal 
transformation 
of 
signs 
presupposes 
implicitly 
the 
signic 
nature 
of 
the 
same 
signs 
(no 
thing 
without 
a 
semantic 
dimension 
can 
be 
a 
sign) 
a 
conclusion 
becomes 
evident: 
synonymy 
is 
a 
relation 
whose 
pertinence 
is 
syntactic, 
but 
whose 
regard 
is 
semantic. 
I 
make 
my 
point 
clearer. 
The 
formal 
approach 
to 
signs 
leaves 
their 
meanings 
out 
of 
consideration; 
nevertheless 
it 
concerns 
signs, 
whch 
is 
to 
say 
objects 
having 
that 
certain 
characteristics. 
We 
can 
reason 
on 
European 


citizens 
leaving 
their 
nationality 
out 
of 
consideration 
(for 
instance 
stating 
that 
they 
have 
the 
right 
to 
cross 
freely 
the 
European 
frontiers), 
yet 
we 
cannot 
extrapolate 
automatically 
our 
statements 
to 
persons 
who 
are 
not 
European 
citizens, 
so 
then 
we 
can 
leave 
their 
nationality 
out 
of 
consideration 
provided 


that 
they 
have 
a 
certain 
requisite. 
Analogously 
we 
can 
leave 
the 
meanings 
out 
of 
consideration, 
provided 
that 
the 
objects 
we 
are 
reasoning 
about 
have 
a 
meaning. 


In 
formal 
treatments 
definitions 
are 
introduced 
as 
abbreviations, 
and 
abbreviations 
are 
managed 
through 
a 
purely 
syntactic 
approach. 
Yet 
no 
syntactical 
approach 
can 
overcome 
the 
semantic 
role 
of 
a 



given 
sign: 
to 
introduce 
an 
abbreviation 
in 
a 
formal 
theory 
is 
to 
agree 
that 
in 
every 
interpretation 
of 
the 
same 
theory, 
definiendum 
and 
definiens 
adduce 
the 
same 
piece 
of 
information, 
though 
any 
specific 
piece 
of 
information 
is 
left 
out 
of 
consideration. 


In 
other 
words, 
the 
way 
we 
deal 
formally 
with 
signs 
(leaving 
their 
meanings 
out 
of 
consideration) 
is 
far 
from 
being 
the 
way 
we 
deal 
with 
arabesques 
(where 
the 
same 
notion 
of 
an 
abbreviation 
is 
meaningless). 


2.10.1. 
The 
same 
current 
symbolization 
of 
synonymy 
through 
something 
like 
“x”=“y” 


evidences 
my 
claim. 
Such 
a 
symbolization 
is 
surely 
misleading 
since 
manifestly 
the 
two 
synonymous 
expressions 
are 
not 
identical. 
As 
what 
is 
identical 
is 
their 
meaning, 


*x*=*y* 


is 
the 
correct 
symbolization; 
therefore 
by 


“x”D“y” 
iff 
*x*=*y* 


I 
introduce 
the 
symbol 
for 
synonymy 


(2.xxi) 
D 
which 
is 
called 
“inverted 
arrows”. 
By 
definition 
(2.xxi) 
is 
a 
symbol 
of 
equivalence 
having 
syntactic 


pertinence 
(it 
is 
established 
between 
signs) 
and 
semantic 
regard 
(it 
depends 
on 
a 
relation 
between 
meanings). 
It 
plays 
an 
important 
role 
in 
definitions 
(§4.6)) 
allowing 
to 
adequate 
symbolic 
formulations 
to 
usual 
expressions. 


2.10.2. 
An 
etymologic 
pedantry. 
Just 
as 
*synonymous* 
pertains 
to 
signs 
(which 
are 
synonymous 
iff 
they 
adduce 
the 
same 
meaning), 
*homonymous* 
pertains 
to 
meanings 
(which 
are 
homonymous 
iff 
they 
are 
adduced 
by 
the 
same 
sign). 
Then, 
since 
the 
two 
attributes 
pertain 
to 
heterogeneous 
referents, 
to 
give 
them 
a 
common 
ending 
(“onymous” 
from 
“onoma”, 
where 
*onoma*Gr 
= 
*noun*) 
is 
misleading; 
while 
it 
is 
etymologically 
correct 
to 
say 
that 
different 
meanings 
adduced 
by 
a 
same 
word 
are 
homonymous, 
it 
would 
be 
better 
to 
say 
that 
different 
words 
having 
the 
same 
meaning 
are 
homosignificant. 
But 
of 
course 
this 
is 
not 
a 
proposal, 
this 
is 
only 
a 
pedantry, 
I 
repeat. 


2.10.3. 
Synonymy 
(homosignificance) 
and 
homonymy 
are 
not 
absolute 
relations; 
they 
must 
bereferred 
to 
a 
language 
(*sideboard* 
and 
*belief* 
are 
homonymous 
in 
Italian, 
where 
“credenza” 
adduces 
both 
of 
them, 
but 
evidently 
they 
are 
not 
homonymous 
in 
English). 
And 
just 
because 
we 
write 
signs, 
not 
meanings, 
synonymy 
can 
be 
directly 
formulated 
(“wide” 
and 
“broad” 
are 
synonymous), 
but 
homonymy 
cannot 
(*pen* 
and 
*pen* 
are 
homonymous?). 
For 
instance, 

in 
English 
*pen* 
is 
both 
*female 
swan* 
and 
*instrument 
for 
ink 
writing* 
or 
“pen” 
is 
in 
English 
a 
homonymy 
bearer 
for 
*female 
swan* 
and 
*instrument 
for 
ink 
writing* 
are 
two 
correct 
(but 
indirect) 
ways 
to 
formulate 
a 
homonymy. 



CHAPTER 
3 
DIALINGUSTIC 
REFINEMENTS 


3.1. 
This 
chapter 
is 
mainly 
devoted 
to 
showing 
how 
poor 
is 
the 
current 
dialinguistic 
symbologic 
endowment 
and 
how 
fuzzy 
are 
the 
ideas 
of 
celebrated 
authors 
on 
the 
matter. 
A 
language, 
obviously, 
can 
concern 
several 
different 
sensorial 
channels 
(for 
instance 
a 
Braille 
text 
is 
read 
through 
touch), 
yet 
the 
following 
analysis 
deals 
only 
with 
written 
and 
spoken 
languages. 
I 
start 
from 
the 
well 
known 
distinction 
between 
tokens 
(sign 
events) 
and 
types 
(sign 
designs). 
both 
graphic 
and 
phonic 
token 
are 
considered 
as 
utterances. 
I 
hope 
the 
reader 
will 
forgive 
the 
frivolousness 
of 
the 
following 
examples 
(que 
le 
lecteur 
ne 
se 
scandalise 
pas 
de 
cette 
frivolité 
dans 
le 
grave, 
Baudelaire 
would 
comment), 
since 
its 
aim 
is 
just 
to 
involve 
our 
usual 
lingustic 
behaviours. 


3.2. 
Hyphens 
have 
been 
introduced 
as 
a 
diacritic 
symbol 
that 
generically 
stands 
for 
quotation 
marks 
(when 
the 
referent 
is 
the 
enclosed 
term) 
or 
for 
asterisks 
(when 
the 
referent 
is 
the 
meaning 
adduced 
by 
the 
enclosed 
term). 
Yet 
a 
much 
more 
detailed 
analysis 
is 
possible. 
3.2.1. 
The 
press-corrector 
who 
says 
(3.i) 
-shuFFLer-is 
misprinted 
refers 
to 
(and 
exactly 
to) 
the 
graphic 
token 
appearing 
in 
the 
single 
copy 
typewritten 
he 
is 
reading. 


Therefore 
if 
we 
should 
agree 
a 
specific 
diacritical 
symbol 
(quadruple 
inverted 
commas, 
say) 
to 
mean 
the 
mentioned 
word 
where 
it 
occurs 
as 
a 
graphic 
token, 
the 
hyphens 
of 
(3.i) 
ought 
to 
be 
substituted 
just 
by 
quadruple 
inverted 
commas. 


3.2.2. 
The 
lady 
I 
am 
helping 
in 
the 
solution 
of 
a 
cross-word 
puzzle 
tells 
me 
(3.ii) 
-shuffler-is 
too 
short 
explaining 
that 
the 
letters 
are 
eight, 
while 
the 
cases 
to 
fill 
are 
nine. 
But 
what 
exactly 
is 
she 
referring 
to? 
Surely 
she 
does 
not 
refer 
to 
something 
phonic, 
because 
if 
the 
sound 
of 
“sh” 
were 
written 
in 
English 
as 
it 
is 
in 
German 
(“sch”), 
the 
length 
of 
the 
suggested 
word 
would 
be 
exact. 
Reciprocally, 
any 
modification 
of 
English 
orthoepy 
(for 
instance 
to 
pronounce 
“shuffler” 
like 
we 
now 
pronounce 
“skiuffler”) 
would 
be 
of 
no 
moment 
as 
for 
the 
shortness 
of 
the 
suggested 
word. 
She 
is 
referring 
to 
something 
graphic; 
but 
if 
the 
referent 
were 
a 
token, 
then 
the 
attempt 
at 
filling 
the 
nine 
cases 
with 
another 
token 
would 
not 
be 
an 
absurdity. 
She 
(perhaps 
without 
realizing 
it) 


is 
exactly 
speaking 
of 
the 
graphic 
type, 
so 
that, 
if 
we 
should 
agree 
a 
specific 
diacritical 
symbol 
(triple 
inverted 
commas, 
say) 
to 
mean 
the 
mentioned 
word 
where 
is 
occurs 
as 
a 
graphic 
type, 
the 
hyphens 
of 


(3.ii) 
ought 
to 
be 
substituted 
by 
triple 
inverted 
commas. 
3.2.3. 
The 
director 
who 
reproaches 
the 
bad 
actor 
with 

(3.iii) 
-shuffler-thus 
you 
have 
to 
pronounce, 
with 
only 
a 
nuance 
of 
disdain 
refers 
evidently 
to 
a 
phonic 
token, 
that 
is 
to 
the 
sound 
event 
consisting 
in 
the 
same 
utterance 
of 
the 
master. 
Therefore 
if 
we 
should 
agree 
a 
specific 
diacritical 
symbol 
to 
mean 
the 
mentioned 
word 
where 
it 
occurs 
as 
a 
phonic 
token, 
the 
hyphens 
of 
(3.iii) 
ought 
to 
be 
et 
cetera. 


3.2.4. 
The 
bad 
actor 
who, 
after 
hundred 
fruitless 
rehearsals, 
dares 
to 
say 
(3.iv) 
-shuffler-is 
cacophonous, 
-trickster-is 
better 
is 
speaking 
of 
the 
phonic 
type. 
Of 
course 
also 
the 
hundred 
phonic 
tokens 
he 
uttered 
were 
cacophonous, 
but 
this 
is 
only 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
phonic 
type 
cacophony, 
and 
the 
best 
proof 
is 
simply 
that, 
because 
the 
cacophony 
of 
a 
type 
entails 
the 
cacophony 
of 
all 
its 
tokens, 
his 
intuition 
disclosed 
him 
the 
absolute 


uselessness 
of 
new 
attempts. 
Therefore 
if 
we 
should 
agree 
et 
cetera, 
the 
hyphens 
of 
(3.iv) 
ought 
to 
be 
et 
cetera 


3.2.5. 
The 
scholar 
who 
says 
(3.v) 
-shuffler-is 
a 
noun 
refers 
to 
the 
type 
in 
its 
generic 
acceptation. 
Here 
too, 
of 
course, 
if 
a 
term 
is 
a 
noun, 
also 
the 
respective 
graphic 
(or 
phonic) 
type 
is 
a 
noun, 
yet 
to 
read 
(3.v) 
with 
reference 
to 
a 
specifically 
graphic 
(or 
phonic) 


dimensions 
would 
mean 
to 
add 
an 
abusive 
specification, 
then 
to 
adulterate 
the 
original 
message. 
Therefore 
in 
(3.v) 
hyphens 
are 
properly 
used. 
In 
§2.5.3 
another 
context 
legitimating 
the 
use 
of 
hyphens 
is 
instanced. 
Analogously 


-orthodoxy-derives 
from 
-orqos-and 
-doxa


may 
be 
interpreted 
syntactically 
(the 
mentioned 
English 
word, 
quite 
independently 
of 
any 
semantic 
consideration, 
follows 
from 
the 
mentioned 
Greek 
words) 
as 
well 
as 
semantically 
(*orthodoxy* 
follows 
from 
*orqos 
*GR 
and 
*doxa*GR, 
that 
is 
from 
*right* 
and 
*opinion*). 


3.2.6. 
The 
director 
who, 
offended 
by 
(3.iv), 
thunders 
out 
(3.vi) 
-trickster-is 
too 
offensive 
is 
speaking 
of 
a 
meaning 
(§2.2.1) 
therefore 
asterisks 
are 
the 
right 
specific 
diacritical 
symbol 
to 
replace 
the 
hyphens 
in 
(3.vi). 


3.3. 
Of 
course 
I 
have 
no 
intention 
of 
agreeing 
and 
dragging 
on 
a 
so 
Pharaonic 
diacritical 
symbology. 
I 
maintain 
the 
only 
distinction 
between 
quotation 
marks 
and 
asterisks 
since 
it 
is 
actually 
indispensable 
to 
develop 
my 
theses 
(a 
simple 
analogy 
which 
can 
enlighten 
this 
indispensability 
will 
be 
proposed 
in 

§3.4). 
The 
aim 
of 
the 
more 
detailed 
paradigm 
above 
was 
to 
show 
not 
only 
that 
ordinary 
semantics 
is 
rough, 
but 
also 
that 
this 
roughness 
is 
usually 
unperceived 
and 
then 
that 
the 
approximations 
I 
often 
accept 
are 
not 
born 
by 
a 
congenital 
incapacity 
to 
refine 
the 
analysis. 


3.3.1. 
I 
am 
not 
a 
linguist 
(and 
some 
rude 
person 
might 
even 
think 
that 
even 
as 
a 
logician 
...). 
My 
interest 
in 
linguistics 
follows 
not 
only 
from 
the 
(internal?) 
fact 
that 
a 
natural 
language 
is 
my 
main 
instrument 
to 
express 
rather 
difficult 
theses, 
but 
also 
from 
the 
(external?) 
fact 
that 
linguistics 
(through 
semiology) 
belongs 
to 
every 
logic 
which 
refuses 
to 
be 
reduced 
to 
pure 
formalism. 
Therefore, 
just 
as 
it 
is 
highly 
restrictive 
studying 
linguistics 
without 
involving 
semiology 
and 
studying 
semiology 
without 
involving 
logic, 
it 
is 
highly 
restrictive 
studying 
logic 
without 
involving 
gnosiology, 
and 
studying 
gnosiology 
without 
involving 
ontology 
(I 
do 
not 
dare 
to 
follow 
with 
a 
last 
step 
from 
ontology 
to 
metaphysics 
in 
order 
to 
preserve 
my 
last 
reader). 
The 
viewpoint 
of 
linguistics 
is 
undoubtedly 
able 
to 
focus 
on 
fine 
miniatures, 
yet 
it 
grows 
dim 
where 
the 
problems 
concern 
wider 
horizons 
(even 
the 
great 
Saussure 
speak 
of 
the 
semantic 
mystery, 
if 
I 
remember 
correctly): 
a 
microscope 
is 
not 
the 
best 
instrument 
to 
observe 
elephants 
fighting. 
To 
look 
at 
a 
territory 
through 
the 
mentality 
of 
a 
resident 
who 
never 
left 
it 
or 
through 
the 
mentality 
of 
a 
far-coming 
and 
far-going 
traveller 
entails 
momentous 
differences. 
A 
nearly 
sacred 
example: 
until 
today 
the 
common 
mistake 
affecting 
all 
the 
proofs 
I 
know 
of 
Goedel’s 
Incompleteness 
Theorem 
succeeded 
in 
hiding 
itself 
mainly 
because 
the 
same 
proofs 
have 
been 
scrutinized 
by 
mathematically 
sharp 
but 
dialinguistically 
somewhat 
dull 
eyes. 
Even 
the 
image 
reflected 
by 
a 
deforming 
mirror 
is 
perfect 
for 
those 
who 
are 
ascertaining 
whether 
it 
respects 
exactly 
the 
laws 
of 
optics. 
3.4. 
Here 
is 
the 
analogy. 
We 
took 
a 
magnetic 
picture 
p1 
of 
a 
certain 
object 
c 
(the 
Coliseum, 
say). 
Through 
a 
fit 
apparatus 
able 
to 
read 
the 
magnetic 
micro-arabesque 
on 
the 
tape 
we 
project 
an 
illuminated 
c-image 
on 
a 
screen. 
The 
analogy 
associates 
the 
magnetic 
micro-arabesque 
with 
the 
name 
of 
the 
object 
(that 
is 
“c”), 
and 
its 
image 
on 
the 
screen 
with 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
“c” 
(that 
is 
*c*). 
In 
other 
words, 
the 
analogy 
associates 
the 
apparatus 
to 
our 
semantic 
faculty. 
During 
the 
projection 
of 
p1, 
we 
take 
a 
picture 
p2 
of 
the 
whole 
scene, 
so 
that 
when 
p2 
is 
projected, 
we 


see 
both 
the 
image 
of 
the 
p1-micro-arabesque 
(that 
is 
* 
“c” 
*) 
and 
the 
image 
of 
the 
image 
of 
Coliseum 


(that 
is 
* 
*c* 
*). 
Two 
words 
to 
avoid 
any 
confusion 
between 
* 
*c* 
* 
and 
*c*: 
if, 
after 
p1, 
the 
Coliseum 
were 
destroyed, 
we 
could 
not 
take 
new 
pictures 
of 
the 
intact 
monument, 
but 
we 
could 
continue 
to 
take 
new 
pictures 
of 
its 
intact 
image 
on 
the 
screen 
during 
the 
projections 
of 
p1, 
therefore 
what 
we 
see 
on 
the 


screen 
during 
the 
projection 
of 
p2 
is 
not 
the 
image 
of 
the 
Coliseum 
(that 
is 
*c*), 
but 
the 
image 
of 
its 
p1-image 
(that 
is 
* 
*c* 
*). 


Analogously 
“ 
“c” 
” 
and 
“ 
*c* 
” 
are 
associated 
respectively 
to 
the 
magnetic 
p2-micro-arabesque 


impressed 
by 
the 
p1-micro-arabesque 
corresponding 
to 
“c”, 
and 
to 
the 
magnetic 
p2-micro-arabesque 


impressed 
by 
the 
p1-micro-arabesque 
corresponding 
to 
*c*, 
I 
do 
not 
insist 
on 
the 
sequence 
because 
the 
exponential 
function 
increases 
swiftly 
(although 
less 
swiftly 
than 
Cantor’s 
opinion). 
Anyhow 
the 
crucial 
passage 
is 
clear: 
a 
dialinguistic 
symbology 
formed 
by 
only 
one 
symbol 
would 
be 
highly 
inadequate. 


3.5. 
In 
order 
to 
refine 
the 
distinction 
among 
various 
dialinguistic 
orders, 
I 
start 
from 
a 
quotation: 

(3.vii) 
If 
we 
describe 
in 
English 
the 
grammatical 
structure 
of 
modern 
German 
... 
then 
German 
is 
our 
object 
language 
and 
English 
is 
our 
metalanguage 
(Carnap, 
1942, 
§1). 
According 
with 
(3.vii) 
der 
Himmel 
ist 
blau 
is 
a 
protolinguistic 
sentence 
of 
the 
object 
language 
the 
sky 
is 
blue 
is 
a 
protolinguistic 
sentence 
of 
the 
metalanguage, 
"blau" 
ist 
ein 
Adjectiv 
is 
a 
metalinguistic 
sentence 
of 
the 
object 
language 
(which 
just 
possesses 
metalinguistic 
faculties), 
"blue" 
is 
an 
adjective 
is 
a 
metalinguistic 
sentence 
of 
the 
metalanguage 
which 
speaks 
of 
itself 
as 
object 
language, 
and 


(3.viii) 
"blau" 
is 
a 
German 
adjective 
is 
a 
metalinguistic 
sentence 
of 
the 
metalanguage 
which 
speaks 
of 
the 
object 
language. 
Finally 
“blau” 
means 
in 
German 
what 
“blue” 
means 
in 
English 
that 
is, 
in 
short, 
“blau” 
means 
*blue* 
in 
German 
is 
a 
hyperlinguistic 
sentence 
of 
the 
metalanguage 
(which 
just 
possesses 
hyperlinguistic 
faculties) 


concerning 
a 
German 
semantic 
relation 
(that 
is 
a 
sD-relation 
whose 
correlatum 
is 
singled 
out 
through 


an 
English 
connotation). 


3.5.1. 
The 
intervention 
of 
a 
third 
language 
does 
not 
modify 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
discourse. 
For 
instance 
“ 
“blau” 
is 
a 
German 
adjective” 
è 
un 
enunciato 
inglese 
is 
a 
meta-metalinguistic 
sentence 
where 
English 
(metalanguage 
of 
German) 
is 
the 
object 
language 
of 
Italian. 



3.6. 
Now 
let 
me 
agree 
that 
lulù 


is 
the 
name 
in 
English 
of 
the 
German 
adjective 
“blau”. 
Then 


(3.ix) 
lulù 
is 
a 
German 
adjective 
becomes 
a 
perfect 
synonym 
of 
(3.viii). 
The 
discrepancy 
between 
(3.viii) 
and 
(3.ix) 
depends 
on 
the 
discrepant 
criterion 
adopted 
in 
order 
to 
form 
the 
metalinguistic 
lexicon 
through 
which 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
object 
language 
one. 
While 
I 
call 
“standard” 
the 
criterion 
of 
(3.viii), 
that 
obtains 
any 
metalinguistic 
word 
by 
enclosing 
the 
object 
word 
within 
quotation 
marks, 
I 
call 
“autonomous” 
the 
criterion 
of 
(3.ix), 
that 
coins 
a 
specific 
metalinguistic 
word 
for 
any 
object 
word. 
Of 
course 
the 
autonomous 
criterion 
is 
too 
expensive 
to 
result 
practicable: 
yet 
to 
not 
have 
spoken 
of 
it 
would 
have 
been 
a 
censurable 
theoretical 
omission. 


3.6.1. 
A 
pedantry. 
The 
autonomous 
criterion 
would 
also 
forbid 
the 
use 
of 
asterisks. 
In 
fact 
while 
*blau*D 
is 
a 
chromatic 
notion 
is 
a 
correct 
(a 
proper) 
sentence, 


*lulu*E 
is 
a 
chromatic 
notion 


is 
an 
incorrect 
(an 
improper) 
one; 
in 
fact 
to 
be 
correct 
“lulu”, 
instead 
of 
being 
the 
name 
(in 
English) 
of 
a 
(German) 
adjective 
adducing 
a 
chromatic 
notion), 
ought 
to 
be 
an 
adjective 
adducing 
a 
chromatic 
notion. 
The 
name 
relation 
is 
the 
most 
insidious 
of 
logic 
because 
mistaking 
two 
referents 
separated 
by 
a 
dialinguistic 
order 
is 
the 
paramount 
trap. 


3.7. 
Omissis 
3.8. 
Omissis 
3.8.1. 
Omissis 
3.8.2. 
Omissis 
3.9. 
Two 
words 
about 
the 
autonymic 
homonymy, 
which, 
with 
arrogance 
and 
hypocrisy, 
is 
my 
most 
hated 
thing. 
A 
pure 
autonymy 
is 
legitimate; 
every 
natural 
language 
with 
dialinguistic 
faculties 
possesses 
autonymic 
expressions 
as, 
for 
instance 
“these 
same 
words”. 
The 
dangerous 
passage 
arises 
when 
autonymy 
is 
homonymically 
hybridized, 
so 
that 
the 
same 
expression, 
besides 
being 
a 
name 
for 
itself, 
is 
also 
the 
name 
for 
something 
else. 



Anyway 
I 
am 
afraid 
that 
the 
fight 
I 
want 
to 
put 
up 
against 
autonymic 
homonymy 
will 
add 
a 
new 
pearl 
to 
the 
collection 
of 
brilliant 
failures 
I 
have 
already 
recorded 
in 
my 
fights 
against 
arrogance 
and 
hypocrisy. 


3.10. 
An 
analogous 
dialinguistic 
mistake 
affects 
the 
application 
of 
quantifiers. 
For 
instance 
Cappelen 
and 
Lepore 
(under 
the 
voice 
Quotation 
in 
Stanford 
Encyclopedia 
od 
Philosophy) 
argue 
their 
claim 


(3.xvii) 
BQ2. 
It 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
quantify 
into 
quotation 
through 
the 
following 
example 
(quotation 
marks 
replace 
their 
single 
inverted 
commas). 
While 


(3.xviii) 
“bachelor” 
has 
eight 
letters 
is 
a 
true 
statement, 
the 
respective 
existential 
quantification 
(3.xix) 
$x(“x” 
has 
eight 
letters) 
is 
false, 
since 
evidently 
“x” 
is 
a 
one 
letter 
symbol. 


The 
mistake 
affecting 
(3.xix) 
concerns 
the 
absolutely 
abusive 
quotation 
marks 
enclosing 
the 
second 
occurrence 
of 
the 
variable. 
Once 
such 
a 
variable 
in 
its 
first 
occurrence 
ranges 
over 
the 
term 
representing 
the 
subject 
which 
the 
predicate 
of 
(3.xviii) 
is 
ascribed 
to, 
in 
(3.xix) 
the 
same 
predicate 
must 
be 
ascribed 
to 
the 
variable, 
not 
to 
its 
name. 


In 
other 
words. 
Since 
the 
universally 
accepted 
axiom 
for 
“$”-introduction 
is 
not 


(3.xx) 
P(a) 
É$x(P(“x”)) 
but 
rather 
(for 
instance 
Kleene 
1971, 
§19, 
postulate 
11) 


(3.xxi) 
P(a) 
É$x(P(x)) 
the 
derivation 
of 
(3.xix) 
is 
wrong; 
on 
the 
contrary 


(3.xxii) 
$x(x 
has 
eight 
letters) 
is 
the 
perfectly 
sensible 
(and 
even 
true) 
quantification 
stating 
that 
a 
term 
having 
eight 
letters 
does 
exist. 
Of 
course 
such 
a 
conclusion 
does 
not 
at 
all 
entail 
that 
(3.xix) 
is 
a 
statement 
to 
reject 
always; 
there 
are 
contexts 
where 
it 
is 
unobjectionable. 
For 
instance, 
as 
Coliseum 
is 
the 
most 
famous 
Roman 
amphitheatre 


(3.xxiii) 
the 
name 
of 
the 
most 
famous 
Roman 
amphitheatre 
has 
eight 
letters 
is 
a 
true 
statement. 
But 
the 
correct 
procedure 
force 
us 
-either 
to 
quantify 
over 
names 
of 
monuments, 
and 
then 
(3.xviii) 
continues 
being 
wrong 
and 
(3.xxi) 
true 



-or 
to 
quantify 
over 
monuments, 
and 
then 
(3.xix) 
is 
unobjectionable 
(actually 
a 
monument 
whose 
name 
has 
eight 
letters 
does 
exist) 
while 
(3.xxii) 
is 
wrong 
(no 
monument 
has 
eight 
letters, 
obviously). 
In 
the 
latter 
case 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
the 
change 
of 
subject 
entails 
a 
change 
in 
the 
respective 
predicates 
(“to 
have 
eight 
letters” 
vs. 
”to 
have 
an 
eight 
letters 
name”), 
so 
that 
the 
dialinguistic 
import 
of 
quotation 
marks 
and 
the 
dialinguisticity 
of 
*name* 
compensate 
one 
another. 
I 
do 
not 
enter 
into 
the 
legitimity 
of 
(3.xvii); 
I 
simply 
note 
however 
that 
the 
claim 
is 
not 
supported 
by 
the 
example, 
since 
(3.xix) 
is 
not 
the 
correct 
quantification 
of 
(3.xviii). 
I 
think 
that 
mistakes 
of 
this 
sort 
are 
favoured 
by 
an 
insufficiently 
sharp 
distinction 
between 
values 
and 
substitutors 
of 
a 
variable. 


3.11. 
A 
conclusion 
imposes: 
a 
discipline 
which 
arrogates 
to 
itself 
the 
right 
of 
facing 
very 
difficult 
arguments 
before 
having 
made 
ready 
adequate 
mental 
and 
symbolic 
apparatuses, 
brings 
about 
its 
own 
ruin. 
In 
this 
sense 
the 
impudence 
of 
contemporary 
Logic 
recalls 
the 
usages 
of 
many 
Renaissance 
ladies, 
who 
paid 
much 
more 
attention 
to 
their 
making 
up 
and 
paludaments 
than 
to 
their 
personal 
hygiene. 
Purificatory 
lavacres 
are 
indispensable. 
This 
notwithstanding, 
mankind 
seems 
to 
meet 
with 
difficulties 
in 
realizing 
what 
a 
great 
piece 
of 
luck 
is 
my 
arrival 
on 
the 
stage 
of 
Logic 

CHAPTER 
4 
DEFINITIONS 


4.1. 
The 
usual 
acceptation 
of 
“to 
define” 
is 
very 
wide, 
since 
we 
can 
define 
the 
rules 
of 
a 
play, 
the 
boundaries 
of 
a 
State, 
the 
powers 
of 
an 
office 
et 
cetera. 
In 
this 
sense 
whatever 
intervention 
adducing 
sufficient 
information 
to 
identify 
a 
certain 
referent 
is 
a 
definition. 
Even 
a 
jaguar 
marking 
its 
territory 
is 
defining 
it. 
Fortunately 
we 
can 
avoid 
being 
involved 
in 
urological 
practices, 
since 
our 
interest 
is 
focused 
on 
definitions 
concerning 
the 
information 
adduced 
by 
a 
linguistic 
expression. 
This 
notwithstanding, 
under 
the 
informational 
approach 
(Suppes 
1957 
§8.2) 


(4.i) 
A 
definition 
is 
a 
statement 
which 
establishes 
the 
meaning 
of 
an 
expression 
is 
too 
restrictive 
a 
definition 
of 
-definition-. 
In 
fact 
the 
wider 
viewpoint 
of 
the 
informational 
approach 
can 
easily 
concern 
definitions 
which 
are 
not 
statements. 
For 
instance 
the 
young 
mother 
uttering 
“hat”, 
“hat”, 
“hat” 
while 
showing 
different 
hats 
to 
her 
son 
is 
evidently 
performing 
a 
definition. 


The 
crucial 
requisite 
is 
supplying 
the 
information 
through 
which 
a 
meaning 
is 
assigned 
to 
a 
definiendum, 
not 
the 
means 
(linguistic 
or 
ostensive) 
adopted 
in 
order 
to 
supply 
such 
an 
information. 
However 
linguistic 
definitions 
will 
be 
henceforth 
privileged. 


4.2. 
Assuming 
(roughly) 
(4.ii) 
xsy 
as 
the 
general 
scheme 
of 
a 
definition, 
is 
assuming 
that 
the 
first 
variable 
ranges 
over 
expressions 
(of 
a 
given 
language 
L 
s 
refers 
to) 
and 
the 
last 
variable 
ranges 
over 
meanings 
(a 
more 
detailed 
analysis 
in 
§4.6)). 
The 
informational 
levels 
involved 
by 
(4.ii) 
are 
evidently 
two: 
one 
for 
the 
object 
piece 
of 
information 
y 
(that 
is 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
which 
by 
definition 
is 
adduced 
by 
the 
definiendum 
x), 
and 
one 
for 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
the 
whole 
(4.ii), 
that 
is 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
telling 
us 
that 
(in 
L) 
the 
object 
piece 
of 
information 
y 
is 
adduced 
by 
the 
expression 
x. 
Therefore 
a 
definition 
is 
an 
intrinsically 
hyperlinguistic 
intervention. 
A 
due 
conclusion 
whose 
insidiousness 
is 
evidenced 
by 
the 
acritical 
resort 
to 
non-synonymous 
verbs 
(as 
-to 
be-. 
-to 
mean-, 
-to 
stand 
for-, 
-to 


be 
equivalent 
to-et 
cetera), 
or 
even 
to 
different 
symbols 
(as 
“®”, 
“=”, 
“º”) 
in 
order 
to 
express 
the 
relation 
between 
a 
definiendum 
and 
its 
definiens. 


4.2.1. 
In 
order 
to 
avoid 
misinterpretations, 
let 
me 
recall 
some 
previous 
assumptions. 
The 
s-relation 
between 
a 
sign 
(strictly: 
between 
the 
image 
of 
a 
sign) 
and 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
it 
adduces 
(§1.6) 
is 
intrinsically 
mental: 
no 
s–relation 
without 
a 
knower. 


The 
s-relation 
is 
conventional; 
it 
depends 
on 
a 
code, 
usually 
the 
code 
of 
a 
public 
language, 



The 
linguistic 
ability 
is 
the 
mental 
faculty 
of 
establishing 
a 
net 
of 
(conventional) 
s-
relations. 
The 
mental 
intervention 
necessary 
to 
abstract 
a 
type 
from 
tokens 
is 
absolutely 
distinct 
from 
the 
mental 
intervention 
necessary 
to 
associate 
a 
certain 
meaning 
to 
a 
certain 
sign. 
The 
latter, 
so 
to 
say, 
is 
the 
second 
stage 
of 
a 
procedure 
whose 
first 
stage 
is 
just 
the 
abstraction 
of 
the 
type 
(otherwise 
every 
occurrence 
of 
a 
token 
should 
demand 
a 
specific 
definition). 


4.2.2. 
The 
mental 
character 
of 
the 
s–relation 
is 
a 
claim 
subject 
to 
the 
following 
(and 
superficial) 
objection. 
The 
physical 
contiguity 
between 
the 
golden 
(4.iii) 
Beatrice 
finely 
painted 
on 
its 
stern 
makes 
(4.iii) 
the 
name 
of 
this 
same 
yacht, 
quite 
independently 
of 
any 
mental 
intervention. 
Reply. 
Their 
physical 
contiguity 
is 
nothing 
but 
an 
ostensive 
informational 
source 
telling 
us 
that 


actually 
the 
(image 
of 
the) 
name 
and 
the 
(image 
of 
the) 
yacht 
are 
connected 
by 
a 
s-relation. 
Yet 
identifying 
the 
physical 
relation 
of 
contiguity 
between 
the 
painted 
name 
and 
the 
yacht 
with 
the 
semantic 
one, 
is 
a 
mistake: 
also 
the 
golden 
arabesques 
finely 
painted 
to 
enclose 
(4.iii) 
are 
physically 


contiguous 
to 
the 
yacht, 
nevertheless 
they 
do 
not 
name 
anything, 
simply 
because 
they 
are 
not 
interpreted 
as 
meaningful 
marks 
(i.e.: 
simply 
because 
we 
assume 
that 
their 
image 
is 
not 
the 
origin 
of 
any 
s-relation). 


4.3. 
In 
order 
to 
classify 
formal 
definitions 
let 
me 
propose 
a 
fanciful 
example. 
By 
supposition 
the 
worldwide 
envied 
lady 
who 
owns 
the 
Parthenon, 
owns 
the 
Coliseum 
too. 
This 
piece 
of 
information 
can 
be 
indifferently 
adduced 
by 


(4.iv) 
The 
Coliseum 
is 
owned 
by 
the 
owner 
of 
the 
Parthenon 
or 
by 


(4.v) 
The 
owner 
of 
the 
Parthenon 
is 
the 
owner 
of 
the 
Coliseum 
or 
by 


(4.vi) 
The 
Coliseum 
and 
the 
Parthenon 
are 
co-owned 
(of 
course 
two 
or 
more 
things 
are 
co-owned 
iff 
they 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
owner(s)). 


Nevertheless 
while 
(4.iv) 
is 
centred 
on 
a 
relation 
(“to 
be 
owned 
by”) 
between 
a 
monument 
and 
an 
owner, 
(4.v) 
is 
centred 
on 
a 
relation 
(“to 
be”) 
between 
owners, 
and 
(4.vi) 
is 
centred 
on 
a 
relation 
(“to 
be 
co-owned”) 
between 
monuments. 


The 
three 
formulations 
above 
correspond 
respectively 
to 
the 
three 
strict 
linguistic 
formulations 
of 
a 
definition 
(where 
monuments 
become 
signs 
and 
owners 
become 
meanings). 
In 
fact 
a 
linguistic 
definition 
can 
be 
strictly 
formulated 
-by 
signification 
(§4.6) 



-by 
semantic 
identity 
(§4.7) 
-by 
synonymy 
(§4.8) 
(I 
speak 
of 
strict 
formulations 
because 
(§4.8) 
there 
are 
linguistic 
formulations 
whose 
hyperlinguistic 
dimension 
is 
not 
explicit). 


4.4. 
The 
scheme 
(4.vii) 
"....." 
s 
*.-.-.* 
that 
is, 
for 
instance, 


(4.viii) 
“regular 
(polygon)” 
means 
*equilateral 
and 
equiangular 
(polygon)* 
illustrates 
the 
simplest 
version 
(§4.4.3) 
of 
definitions 
by 
signification. 
Both 
the 
presence 
of 
“s” 
and 
of 
asterisks 
make 
manifest 
the 
hyperlinguistic 
dimension 
of 
(4.vii). 
The 
formulation 
by 
signification 
(which 
anyhow 
can 
be 
immediately 
and 
plainly 
translated 
into 
a 
formulation 
by 
semantic 
identity 
or 
by 
synonymy) 
plays 
a 
privileged 
role 
since 
it 
respects 
in 
the 
most 
scrupulous 
manner 
the 
task 
of 
assigning 
a 
meaning 
to 
a 
definiendum 
(4.i). 
A 
fastidiousness. 
In 
(4.viii) 
“polygon” 
occurs 
between 
parentheses 
because 
when 
we 
do 
not 
speak 
of 
polygons 
but, 
say, 
of 
soldiers, 
“regular” 
does 
not 
at 
all 
mean 
*equilateral 
and 
equiangular*. 
Another 
fastidiousness: 
“polygon” 
has 
been 
and 
will 
be 
used 
as 
an 
abbreviation 
of 
“plane 
polygon 
with 
rectilinear 
sides”. 


4.4.1. 
Since 
s 
is 
a 
projective 
relation 
(that 
is 
a 
relation 
connecting 
a 
syntactic 
entity 
with 
a 
semantic 
one), 
a 
semantic 
diacritical 
symbol 
as 
asterisks 
is 
necessary 
to 
write 
down 
a 
correct 
formulation 
by 
signification. 
Two 
illustrious 
examples 
of 
the 
impasse 
otherwise 
impending 
are 
given 
by 
Pap, 
where 
he 
writes 
(4.ix) 
... 
“fy” 
means 
“the 
number 
which 
is 
the 
immediate 
successor 
of 
y” 
(1964, 
in 
Olshewsky 
1969, 
p.287), 
and 
by 
Tarski, 
where 
he 
writes 


(4.x) 
It 
might 
appear 
... 
that 
“true 
sentence” 
....means 
nothing 
other 
than 
“provable 
theorem” 
(1936, 
§3); 
they 
did 
not 
realize 
that 
a 
scheme 
like 


(4.xi) 
“x” 
means 
“y” 
is 
either 
ambiguous 
or 
incoherent. 
In 
fact 
I 
remind 
the 
reader 
that 
the 
only 
way 
to 
save 
(4.xi) 
from 


incoherence 
is 
to 
accept 
quotation 
marks 
as 
an 
ambiguous 
symbol 
which 
in 
its 
first 
occurrence 
must 
be 
interpreted 
as 
a 
name 
of 
the 
enclosed 
expression 
and 
in 
its 
second 
occurrence 
must 
be 
interpreted 
as 
a 
name 
of 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
the 
enclosed 
expression. 
Yet, 
also 
leaving 
out 
of 
consideration 
that 
neither 
Pap 
nor 
Tarski 
point 
out 
the 
problem, 
the 
ambiguous 
agreement 
would 



represent 
however 
a 
very 
unprofitable 
way 
out: 
logic 
and 
ambiguity 
are 
(at 
least: 
ought 
to 
be) 
mortal 


enemies. 
In 
this 
sense, 
frankly, 
I 
think 
that 
(4.ix) 
and 
(4.x) 
are 
further 
evidence 
of 
the 
already 
denounced 
insufficient 
dialinguistic 
perspicuity. 
Let 
me 
indulge 
in 
a 
frivolous 
analogy. 
Just 
as 
it 
would 
be 
a 
very 
hard 
task 
to 
put 
a 
flattened 
top 
hat 


on 
before 
the 
magic 
touch 
of 
the 
viveur 
restores 
its 
third 
dimension, 
it 
is 
a 
very 
hard 
task 
to 
solve 
enormous 
problems 
of 
logic 
(one 
for 
all: 
the 
problem 
of 
truth) 
with 
a 
diacritical 
symbology 
unable 
to 
account 
for 
their 
informational 
dimension. 


4.4.2. 
The 
explicit 
formulation 
of 
(4.vii) 
in 
ordinary 
language 
is 
(4.xii) 
“...” 
means 
the 
meaning 
of 
“.-.-.” 
and 
(4.xii) 
may 
ring 
like 
a 
false 
note; 
yet 
this 
remark 
concerns 
only 
the 
elegance 
of 
the 
sentence. 
In 
fact, 
if 
what 
a 
human 
being 
writes 
is 
a 
writing 
and 
what 
a 
machinery 
produces 
is 
a 
product, 
what 
an 
expression 
means 
is 
a 
meaning; 
then 
(4.xii) 
is 
perfectly 
proper. 
The 
conclusion 
can 
be 
confirmed 
by 
instancing 
(4.xii) 
on 
an 
example 
where 
both 
couples 
of 
quotation 
marks 
enclose 
the 
same 
expression 
(“equilateral” 
means 
the 
meaning 
of 
”equilateral”, 
say): 
the 
definition 
becomes 
a 
mere 
tautology, 
but 
a 
tautology 
entails 
automatically 
its 
properness. 
Moreover 
if 
we 
substitute 
“means” 
by 
“adduces”, 
(4.xii) 
does 
no 
longer 
ring 
like 
a 
false 
note 
since 
the 
inelegant 
repetition 
is 
avoided. 


4.4.3. 
Indeed 
(4.vii) 
is 
a 
simplified 
scheme. 
The 
general 
scheme 
is 
(4.xiii) 
“ 
... 
” 
sL1 
* 
.-.-. 
* 
L2 
where 
L1 
is 
the 
language 
the 
established 
signification 
belongs 
to, 
and 
L2 
is 
the 
language 
whose 
semantics 
is 
used 
to 
identify 
the 
meaning 
adduced 
by 
the 
definiens; 
then 
(4.vii) 
is 
a 
simplified 
scheme 
because, 
under 
the 
implicit 
assumption 
L1=L2, 
the 
indexes 
are 
omitted. 


In 
order 
to 
write 
down 
a 
definition 
by 
signification, 
the 
basic 
problem 
is 
finding 
out 
the 
(three) 
expressions 
through 
which 
the 
identification 
of 
the 
(three) 
elements 
occurring 
in 
(4.ii) 
can 
be 
achieved. 
As 
for 
the 
definiendum, 
under 
the 
standard 
criterion 
(§3.6) 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
enclose 
the 
same 
definiendum 
within 
quotation 
marks. 
As 
for 
the 
relation, 
“s” 
is 
the 
obvious 
solution. 
But 
as 
for 
the 
definiens, 
its 
identification 
implies 
the 
appeal 
to 
another 
signification 
(not 
necessarily 
belonging 
to 
the 
language 
of 
the 
definieindum). 
So 
for 
instance 
the 
understanding 
of 


(4.xiv) 
“casque” 
means 
in 
English 
*parte 
della 
armatura 
a 
protezione 
della 
testa*I 
presupposes 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
pieces 
of 
information 
adduced 
in 
Italian 
by 
“parte”, 
“della” 
et 
cetera. 
Yet 
a 
doubt 
may 
arise 
as 
soon 
as 


(4.xv) 
(4.xiv) 
defines 
-casqueis 
recognized 
as 
a 
proper 
(and 
true) 
proposition: 
in 
(4.xv) 
what 
specific 
dialinguistic 
symbol 
hyphens 
do 
stand 
for? 
The 
answer 
is 
clear: 
since 
(4.i) 
defining 
is 
establishing 
the 
meaning 
of 
an 
expression, 
hyphens 
stand 
for 
quotation 
marks. 
In 
fact 
if 
we 
should 
read 
(4.xv) 
as 



(4.xiv) 
defines 
*casque* 
the 
same 
definition 
of 
asterisks 
(§2.4) 
would 
lead 
us 
to 
(4.xiv) 
establishes 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
meaning 
of 
“casque” 
that 
is 
to 
an 
improper 
sentence. 
Therefore 
also 
in 
the 
informational 
approach 
what 
we 
define 
are 
words, 
not 
meanings. 


4.4.4. 
Ostensive 
definitions 
can 
be 
easily 
interpreted 
as 
definitions 
by 
signification. 
For 
instance, 
in 
the 
case 
mentioned 
in 
§1, 
the 
definiendum 
is 
uttered 
( 
“hat”, 
“hat”, 
“hat”), 
the 
meaning 
is 
inferred 
by 
an 
abstraction 
on 
the 
common 
connotation 
characterizing 
the 
various 
exhibited 
objects 
(roughly: 
all 
of 
them 
are 
covering 
for 
the 
head), 
and 
the 
s-relation 
linking 
the 
uttered 
word 
with 
this 
inferred 
meaning 
results 
from 
the 
context. 
Although 
affected 
by 
informal 
factors 
(the 
hyperlinguistic 
intervention 
follows 
from 
an 
intuitive 
association) 
and 
by 
intrinsic 
limits 
((how 
could 
the 
young 
mother 
define 
*otherwise* 
through 
an 
ostension?), 
ostensive 
definitions 
represent 
the 
basis 
of 
every 
natural 
semantics. 


4.5. 
The 
scheme 
(4.xvi) 
*....* 
= 
*.-.-.* 
that 
is, 
for 
instance, 
(4.xvii) 
*regular 
(polygon)* 
= 
= 
*equilateral 
and 
equiangular 
(polygon)* 
illustrates 
the 
formulations 
by 
semantic 
identity 
in 
its 
simplest 
version. 
In 
fact 
(4.xvi) 
says 
that 
the 
definiendum 
and 
the 
definiens 
adduce 
the 
same 
piece 
of 
information 
(therefore 
“=” 
occurs 
in 
(4.xvi) 
as 
an 
unobjectionable 
symbol 
of 
identity). 
Of 
course 


(4.xviii) 
the 
meaning 
of 
“regular 
(polygon)” 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
“equilateral 
and 
equiangular 
(polygon)” 
is 
the 
explicit 
formulation 
of 
(4.xvii). 
The 
hyperlinguistic 
dimension 
of 
(4.xvi) 
and 
(4.xvii) 
results 
from 
the 
occurrence 
of 
asterisks, 
just 
as 
the 
hyperlinguistic 
dimension 
of 
(4.xviii) 
results 
from 
the 
occurrence 
of 
“meaning”. 


4.5.1. 
Exactly 
as 
(4.xiii) 
is 
the 
general 
version 
of 
(4.vii) 
(4.xix) 
*....*L1 
= 
*.-.-.*L2 



is 
the 
general 
version 
of 
(4.xvi). 


4.5.2. 
What 
I 
stated 
in 
§4.4.1 
with 
reference 
to 
formulations 
by 
signification 
can 
be 
re-proposed 
with 
reference 
to 
formulations 
by 
semantic 
identity, 
since 
if 
our 
endowment 
of 
diacritical 
symbols 
were 
limited 
to 
quotation 
marks, 
a 
scheme 
focused 
on 
the 
relation 
of 
identity 
would 
be 
either 
incoherent 
or 
ambiguous 
(§4.6.2). 


4.6. 
The 
scheme 
(4.xx) 
“...” 
≡ 
“.-.-.” 
s 


that 
is, 
for 
instance 


“regular 
(polygon)” 
is 
semantically 
equivalent 
to 
“equilateral 
and 
equiangular 
(polygon)” 


llustrates 
the 
definitions 
by 
synonymy 
in 
its 
simplest 
version. 
In 
(4.xx) 
“≡” 
is 
a 
symbol 
of 
equivalence 
and 
the 
index 
“s” 
tells 
us 
that 
the 
equivalence 
concerns 
the 
semantic 
dimension 
(a 
synonymy 
is 
nothing 
but 
a 
semantic 
equivalence). 
So, 
since 
inverted 
arrows 
have 
been 
introduced 
as 
a 
symbol 
of 
synonymy 
(§2.10.1), 


(4.xxi) 
“...” 
D 
“.-.-.” 
is 
the 
alternative 
formulation 
of 
(4.xx) 
which 
will 
be 
privileged. 
Here 
I 
do 
not 
dwell 
on 
the 
relations 
of 
equivalence, 
which 
will 
be 
analyzed 
in 
the 
course. 


4.6.1. 
I 
recall 
§4.4.3 
and 
§4.5.1 
to 
underline 
that 
(4.xxi) 
is 
a 
simplified 
scheme; 
in 
fact 
(4.xxii) 
“...” 
L1D 
L2 
“.-.-.” 


is 
the 
general 
scheme 
applicable 
where 
the 
two 
expressions 
belong 
to 
different 
linguistic 
codes. 
Yet, 
for 
sake 
of 
concision, 
wherever 
possible 
I 
will 
reason 
on 
the 
simplified 
schemata 
(which 
obviously 
hold 
in 
formal 
systems, 
where 
we 
act 
within 
an 
only 
language). 
Once 
we 
agree 
that 
in 
its 
technical 
acceptation 
an 
abbreviation 
does 
not 
imply 
any 
shortening 
component, 
we 
can 
also 
call 
“by 
abbreviation” 
this 
kind 
of 
definitions; 
this 
notwithstanding, 
though 
the 
definiendum 
of 
a 
definition 
by 
abbreviation 
may 
also 
be 
longer 
than 
its 
definiens, 
it 
is 
usually 
shorter 
(mainly 
because 
if 
we 
already 
have 
a 
shorter 
expression 
for 
a 
meaning, 
it 
would 
be 
an 
anti-
economic 
intervention 
to 
introduce 
a 
longer 
one). 


4.6.2. 
In 
the 
current 
treatments, 
strict 
formulations 
as 
(4.xiii) 
and 
(4.xxii) 
are 
often 
replaced 
by 
(4.xxiii) 
“...” 
= 
“.-.-.” 
that 
is 
by 
a 
hybrid 
scheme 
which, 
once 
more, 
compels 
celebrated 
authors 
to 
untenable 
devices. 
In 
fact 
a 
point 
is 
sure: 
except 
the 
trivial 
case 
of 
a 
tautology, 
the 
two 
expressions 
enclosed 
within 
quotation 
marks 
in 
a 
particularization 
of 
(4.xxiii) 
are 
different, 
therefore 
the 
identity 
symbol 
“=” 
cannot 
be 
read 
as 
an 
identity 
symbol. 
Actually, 
for 
instance, 
Carnap 
reads 
it 
as 
“to 
be 

interchangeable 
with”, 
and 
Church 
(in 
Runes) 
as 
“to 
stand 
for”. 
But 
consequently 
and 
evidently, 
since 
elsewhere 
“=” 
continues 
adducing 
identity, 
these 
readings 
make 
it 
an 
ambiguous 
symbol 
and, 
moreover, 
an 
ambiguous 
symbol 
whose 
secondary 
meaning 
ought 
to 
be 
formally 
defined. 
On 
the 
contrary 
-in 
(4.xvi) 
“=” 
occurs 
properly, 
because 
in 
(4.xvi) 
it 
actually 
adduces 
identity 
(of 
meaning) 


-in 
(4.xix) 
“D” 
can 
properly 
be 
read 
as 
“to 
be 
interchangeable 
with” 
or 
as 
“to 
stand 
for” 
or 
as 
“to 
be 
an 
abbreviation 
of” 
because, 
once 
asterisks 
have 
been 
introduced 
in 
the 
formal 
system, 
such 
readings 
are 
exactly 
entailed 
by 
the 
definition 
of 
inverted 
arrows 
(Chapter 
2, 
§ 
10.1). 


4.6.3. 
An 
important 
note. 
The 
fact 
that 
in 
(4.xxi) 
neither 
asterisks 
nor 
“s” 
occur 
does 
not 
at 
all 
mean 
that, 
therefore, 
a 
definition 
by 
synonymy, 
far 
from 
being 
hyperlinguistic, 
is 
simply 
metalinguistic; 
the 
hyperlinguistic 
dimension 
of 
(4.xxi) 
hides 
in 
inverted 
arrows 
(§2.10). 
Accepting 
the 
reciprocal 
substitutability 
of 
two 
signs 
without 
imposing 
the 
identity 
of 
meaning 
(in 
the 
same 
interpretation) 
would 
be 
a 
ruinous 
step 
for 
the 
consistence 
of 
whatsoever 
theory. 
In 
order 
to 
support 
this 
conclusion 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
evoke 
the 
admissibility 
criterion 
(Salmon 
1966 
p. 
64 
quoted 
in 
Hajek 
2003, 
§2): 
the 
meanings 
assigned 
to 
the 
primitive 
terms 
... 
transform 
the 
formal 
axioms, 
and 


consequently 
all 
the 
theorems, 
into 
true 
statements. 
In 
other 
words: 
the 
risk 
connected 
with 
Carnap’s 
and 
Church’s 
position 
is 
not 
to 
realize 
that 
*to 
be 
interchangeable* 
or 
*to 
stand 
for* 
mask 
under 
their 
syntactic 
pertinence 
a 
semantic 
regard. 
Let 
me 
insist. 
In 
a 
formal 
system, 
definitions 
are 
simply 
the 
means 
to 
introduce 
non-primitive 
symbols 
as 
abbreviations 
of 
primitive 
or 
previously 
defined 
symbols; 
therefore 
the 
strict 
formulation 
of 
such 
definitions 
is 
(4.xxi). 
But 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
interpret 
“symbol” 
(or 
“sign”) 
in 
compliance 
with 
its 
strict 
acceptation, 
the 
semantic 
regard 
becomes 
evident, 
since 
a 
symbol 
is 
something 
which 
belongs 
to 
a 
language, 
and 
a 
language 
is 
intrinsically 
an 
instrument 
to 
communicate 
information. 
Thus, 
though 
a 
formal 
system 
leaves 
any 
specific 
interpretation 
out 
of 
consideration, 
two 
expressions, 
in 
order 
to 
be 
reciprocally 
substitutable, 
must 
adduce 
the 
same 
meaning; 
otherwise 
the 
admissibility 
criterion 
might 
be 
respected 
by 
one 
of 
them 
and 
violated 
by 
the 
other 
one. 
Shortly: 
in 
whatever 
formal 
theory 
whatever 
abbreviation 
entails 
an 
interpretative 
equivalence. 
The 
understanding 
of 
this 
claim 
might 
be 
helped 
by 
reconsidering 
(4.vi); 
it 
speaks 
of 
monuments, 
but 
the 
involved 
(cadastral) 
relation 
is 
‘semantic’, 
as 
it 
implies 
the 
figure 
of 
an 
owner. 
In 
this 
sense, 


as 
soon 
as 
we 
realize 
that 
in 
*sign* 
the 
semantic 
dimension 
is 
essential, 
we 
realize 
that 
“to 
be 
synonymous” 
expresses 
a 
relation 
of 
semantic 
regard 
in 
spite 
of 
its 
syntactic 
pertinence. 


4.7. 
Let 
me 
spend 
two 
lines 
apropos 
of 
a 
coarse 
puzzle 
concerning 
definitions. 
On 
the 
one 
hand 
a 
definition 
adduces 
a 
new 
piece 
of 
information 
(without 
it, 
obviously, 
we 
could 
not 
manage 
the 
definiendum); 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
since 
(I 
am 
re-quoting 
Suppes) 
a 
new 
definition 
does 
not 
permit 


the 
proof 
of 
relationship 
among 
the 
old 
symbols 
which 
were 
previously 
unprovable, 
the 
same 
definition 
should 
not 
adduce 
any 
new 
piece 
of 
information. 
In 
order 
to 
solve 
the 
puzzle 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
mind 
the 
distinction 
between 
the 
object 
formal 
language 
the 
definiendum 
belongs 
to 
and 
its 
‘metalanguage’ 
(hyperlanguage) 
the 
definition 
belongs 
to. 
I 
repeat: 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
a 
definition 
is 
a 
‘meta-information’ 
(a 
hyper-
information) 
concerning 
the 
assignation 
of 
an 
object 
information 
to 
a 
definiendum. 
A 
situation 
analogous 
to 
a 
direction 
teaching 
us 
how 
to 
consult 
a 
telephone 
book; 
it 
explains 
how 
to 
read 
the 
list 
of 
the 
users, 
yet 
it 
does 
not 
enrich 
the 
same 
list. 



4.7.1. 
This 
dialinguistic 
distinction 
(also: 
this 
projective 
distinction) 
between 
the 
planes 
of 
the 
definiendum 
and 
of 
the 
definition 
explains 
immediately 
why 
the 
syntactic 
status 
of 
the 
definiendum 
does 
not 
influence 
the 
syntactic 
well 
formation 
of 
a 
formal 
definition. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
concision 
I 
limit 
to 
definitions 
by 
signification 
a 
discourse 
which 
can 
be 
immediately 
referred 
to 
definitions 
by 
semantic 
identity 
or 
by 
synonymy). 
For 
instance 
(4.xxiv) 
by 
definition 
“femur” 
means 
*thigh 
bone* 
(4.xxv) 
by 
definition 
“to 
susurrate” 
means 
*to 
speak 
softly* 
(4.xxvi) 
by 
definition 
“otherwise” 
means 
*in 
a 
different 
manner 
or 
by 
other 
means* 
are 
syntactically 
well-formed 
hyperlinguistic 
sentences 
concerning 
respectively 
a 
substantive, 
a 
verb 
and 
an 
adverb 
(of 
the 
object 
language). 
As 
we 
already 
know 
(§2.5), 
the 
syntactical 
well 
formation 
of 
(4.xxiv), 
(4.xxv) 
and 
(4.xxvi), 
notwithstanding 
the 
different 
syntactical 
status 
of 
the 
three 
definienda, 
depends 
on 
the 
fact 
that 
quotation 
marks 
and 
asterisks 
are 
dialinguistic 
symbols 
substantivizing 
(in 
the 
dialanguage) 
whatever 
expression 
(of 
the 
object 
language) 
they 
enclose. 


From 
this 
viewpoint 
the 
distinction 
between 
explicit 
and 
contextual 
definitions 
(for 
instance 
Pap 
1964 
in 
Olshewsky 
1969, 
p.285) 
is 
of 
no 
theoretical 
moment, 
since 
we 
can 
consider 
all 
definitions 
as 
contextual 
and 
remark 
that 
there 
are 
contexts 
where 
some 
syntactical 
simplification 
is 
attainable. 
In 
particular 
the 
distinction 
emphasized 
by 
Pap’s 
examples 
on 
-brother-is 
influenced 
by 
the 
double 
reading 
discussed 
in 
Chapter 
19, 
§7 
(the 
brotherhood 
function, 
so 
to 
write, 
is 
not 
its 
generic 
‘value’). 


4.8. 
A 
traditional 
(yet 
naive) 
distinction 
opposes 
nominal 
and 
real 
definitions 
(that 
is, 
in 
Ockham’s 
terminology, 
definitiones 
quid 
nominis 
and 
quid 
rei). 
This 
distinction 
is 
currently 
explained 
by 
statements 
like 


Real 
definition 
is 
distinguished 
from 
nominal 
definition 
as 
being 
the 
definition 
of 
a 
thing 
rather 
than 
of 
a 
notation 


(Church 
under 
the 
voice 
“Definition” 
in 
Encyclopædia 
Britannica 
1963) 
or 
like 


A 
real 
definition 
is 
understood 
to 
define 
the 
object 
for 
which 
a 
term 
is 
used, 
a 
nominal 
definition 
to 
define 
the 
term 
... 


(Olshewsky 
1969, 
footnote 
p.280). 
I 
dissent 
because 
of 
a 
basic 
difficulty: 
what 
on 
earth 
do 


the 
definition 
of 
a 
thing 


or 


to 
define 
an 
object 


mean? 
Once 
any 
metaphoric 
interpretation 
under 
which, 
say, 
“to 
define” 
becomes 
a 
synonym 
of 
“to 
make” 
or 
of 
“to 
design” 
is 
banned, 



to 
define 
a 
hat 


is 
an 
improper 
expression. 
Logicians 
are 
not 
jaguars, 
but 
neither 
hatters; 
what 
they 
can 
define 
is 
the 
informational 
import 
of 
a 
word, 
not 
the 
shape 
of 
a 
garment. 


Let 
me 
apply 
Carnap’s 
well 
known 
distinction 
between 
material 
and 
formal 
modes 
of 
speech 
to 
a 
topic 
where 
it 
is 
actually 
enlightening, 
that 
is 
to 
definitions. 
Then 


(4.xxvii) 
a 
pentagon 
is 
a 
polygon 
with 
five 
sides 
is 
the 
material 
version 
and 
(4.xxviii) 
“pentagon” 
means 
*polygon 
with 
five 
sides* 
et 
cetera 
are 
the 
formal 
versions 
of 
the 
same 
definition. 
But 
what 
we 
can 
introduce 
in 
a 
formal 
system 
are 
words, 
not 
geometric 
figures: 
(4.xxvii) 
is 
nothing 
but 
a 
pseudo-objective 
way 
to 
express 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
(4.xxviii) 
(or 
by 
(4.xxix) 
et 
cetera). 
In 
my 
opinion 
‘real 
definitions’ 
are 
nothing 
but 
definitions 
formulated 
in 
the 
material 
mode 
of 
speech. 


4.8.1. 
Incidentally. 
So 
far 
as 
his 
original 
examples 
are 
concerned 
(1935, 
7), 
Carnap’s 
distinction 
is 
untenable. 
To 
read 
(4.xxix) 
This 
book 
treats 
of 
Africa 
as 
a 
pseudo 
objective 
sentence 
for 
the 
formally 
correct 
(4.xxx) 
This 
book 
contains 
the 
word 
“Africa” 
is 
a 
manifest 
far-fetched 
claim: 
*being 
treated 
in 
this 
book* 
is 
a 
connotation 
(a 
quality) 
of 
Africa 
exactly 
as 
*being 
visited 
by 
Mr. 
A*. 


Furthermore, 
while 
the 
alethic 
values 
of 
(4.xxvii) 
and 
(4.xxviii) 
must 
be 
the 
same, 
the 
alethic 
values 
of 
(4.xxix) 
and 
(4.xxx) 
may 
be 
different. 
The 
informational 
approach 
is 
also 
fit 
for 
avoiding 
another 
analogous 
mistake. 
In 
fact 
he 
claims 
that 


(4.xxxi) 
(the 
words) 
“Morning-star” 
and 
“Evening-star” 
are 
synonymous 
is 
the 
formal 
mode 
of 
speech 
through 
which 
we 
can 
translate 
the 
pseudo 
object 
sentence 
the 
Morning-star 
is 
the 
Evening-star 
(material 
mode 
of 
speech). 
I 
dissent 
as 
I 
think 
that 
his 
position 
does 
not 
account 
for 
a 
basic 
informational 
discrepancy. 
In 
fact, 
for 
instance, 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
compare 
(4.xxxi) 
with 


(4.xxxii) 
(the 
words) 
“femur” 
and 
“thigh 
bone” 
are 
synonymous 

we 
can 
realize 
that 
while 
in 
(4.xxxii) 
the 
two 
mentioned 
expressions 
refer 
to 
the 
same 
informational 
nucleus 
(to 
the 
same 
image, 
so 
to 
say 
briefly), 
in 
(4.xxxi) 
they 
do 
not, 
since 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
we 
draw 
from 
the 
sight 
of 
the 
Morning-star 
is 
absolutely 
different 
from 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
we 
draw 
from 
the 
sight 
of 
the 
Evening-star. 
In 
other 
words. 
While, 
until 
the 
discovery 
of 
their 
identity, 
“Morning 
star” 
and 
“Evening 
star” 
named 
two 
different 
heavenly 
bodies, 
never 
“femur” 
and 
“ 
thigh 
bone” 
named 
two 
different 
bones; 
in 
this 
sense 
they 
are 
connected 
by 
a 
very 
synonymy. 


As 
soon 
as 
we 
realize 
that 
a 
third 
protagonist 
(the 
meaning) 
does 
exist 
between 
sign 
and 
referent, 
statements 
of 
identity 
are 
no 
longer 
puzzling. 
Anyhow 
I 
shall 
retake 
this 
crucial 
passage. 


4.8.2. 
Ajdukiewicz 
(1958) 
writes: 
there 
is 
no 
general 
concept 
of 
definition 
of 
which 
the 
concepts 
of 
real 
definition 
and 
nominal 
definition 
would 
be 
specifications 
..... 
the 
word 
“definition”.... 
has 
in 
isolation 
no 
meaning 
at 
all. 
Indeed, 
on 
the 
ground 
of 
the 
proposed 
considerations, 
Ajdukiewicz’s 
claim 
seems 
to 
me 
too 
hazardous 
to 
be 
tenable 
(all 
the 
tenable 
hazardous 
claims 
I 
know 
are 
exactly 
mine). 
The 
word 
“definition” 
has 
in 
isolation 
a 
precise 
meaning 
since 
a 
definition 
is 
any 
intervention 
supplying 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
necessary 
to 
assign 
a 
meaning 
to 
a 
definiendum, 
quite 
independently 
on 
the 
means 
through 
which 
such 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
is 
supplied 
(let 
me 


evoke 
again 
the 
mother 
uttering 
“hat”, 
“hat”, 
“hat”). 
His 
too 
hazardous 
claim 
is 
born 
by 
the 
lacking 


informational 
dimension 
inducing 
him 
to 
over-estimate 
unessential 
peculiarities. 


4.9. 
Definitions 
are 
actually 
classified 
through 
paradigms 
inspired 
by 
numerous 
and 
heterogeneous 
criteria. 
Yet 
many 
of 
these 
criteria 
can 
be 
neglected 
because 
they 
are 
superficial 
enough 
to 
result 
of 
no 
theoretical 
interest. 
A 
current 
intriguing 
criterion 
(for 
instance 
Wikipedia, 
under 
the 
same 
voice) 
opposes 
descriptive 
definitions 
(which 
refer 
to 
the 
general 
use) 
to 
stipulative 
ones 
(which 
refer 
to 
the 
speaker’s 
immediate 
intentional 
meaning). 
So, 
while 
(4.xxvii) 
instances 
a 
descriptive 
definition 
(for 
the 
notion 
of 
a 
pentagon 
belongs 
to 
the 
general 
use), 


(4.xxxiii) 
a 
pentahusband 
is 
a 
man 
with 
five 
wives 
instances 
a 
stipulative 
definition 
(for, 
as 
far 
as 
I 
know, 
the 
notion 
of 
a 
pentahusband 
has 
just 
been 
introduced 
by 
my 
personal 
intervention, 
that 
is 
by 
(4.xxxiii)). 
Of 
course, 
in 
spite 
of 
its 
vagueness, 
the 
opposition 
between 
descriptive 
and 
stipulative 
definitions 
concerns 
different 
informational 


situations 
and 
as 
such 
it 
deserves 
a 
more 
systematic 
analysis. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
concision, 
henceforth 
I 
only 
consider 
definitions 
by 
signification. 


4.10. 
Let 
me 
scrutinize 
the 
matter 
from 
the 
viewpoint 
of 
the 
interpreter. 
The 
piece 
of 
information 
he 
draws 
from 
a 
given 
definition, 
that 
is 
from 
the 
acquirement 
of 
the 
signification 
through 
which 
a 
certain 
meaning 
is 
assigned 
to 
a 
certain 
definiendum, 
depends 
on 
what 
the 
same 
interpreter 
previously 
knows 
about 
such 
a 
signification 
(two 
different 
interpreters 
or 
the 
same 
interpreter 
in 
different 
moments 
may 
draw 
different 
pieces 
of 
information 
from 
the 
same 
definition). 
If 
we 
schematically 
and 
propaedeutically 
assume 
that 
these 
possible 
cognitive 
situations 
are 
only 
two 
(*known* 
vs. 
*unknown*), 
such 
situations 
are 
four, 
and 
precisely 
-both 
definiendum 
and 
meaning 
are 
previously 
unknown 
(total 
definitions) 
-the 
only 
meaning 
is 
previously 
known 
(christening 
definitions) 



-the 
only 
definiendum 
is 
previously 
known 
(connotative 
definitions) 
-both 
definiendum 
and 
meaning 
are 
previously 
known 
(heuristic 
definitions). 


Indeed 
under 
the 
mentioned 
assumption 
(*known* 
vs. 
*unknown*) 
heuristic 
definitions 
are 
border-line 
cases. 
In 
fact 
if 
both 
correlata 
x 
and 
y 
are 
previously 
known, 
there 
is 
no 
informational 
gap 
to 
fill 
(the 
definition 
does 
not 
increase 
the 
statute). 
Yet 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
refine 
the 
opposition, 
so 
accounting 
for 
the 
thousand 
degrees 
of 
our 
actual 
knowledge 
about 
a 
topic, 
we 
can 
reasonably 
refer 
heuristic 
definitions 
to 
cognitive 
situations 
where 
a 
previously 
gross 
signification 
is 
better 
specified 
(§4.12). 


4.10.1. 
The 
basic 
achievement 
is 
that, 
according 
to 
the 
above 
approach, 
the 
status 
of 
a 
definition 
varies 
with 
the 
statute 
of 
the 
interpreter; 
an 
unquestionable 
relativization, 
yet, 
because 
what 
can 
be 
a 
total 
definition 
for 
Plato, 
say, 
may 
be 
a 
christening 
definition 
for 
Socrates. 
Getting 
over 
this 
relativization 
by 
making 
reference 
to 
the 
(indeed 
vague) 
figure 
of 
an 
average 
interpreter 
(whose 
statute 
corresponds 
just 
to 
the 
current 
knowledge 
about 
the 
topic 
involved 
by 
the 
definition 
under 
scrutiny) 
is 
restoring 
the 
(indeed 
vague) 
opposition 
between 
descriptive 
and 
stipulative 
definitions. 


4.11. 
In 
order 
to 
emphasize 
the 
dependence 
of 
the 
classification 
on 
the 
statute 
of 
reference, 
in 
the 
first 
example, 
instead 
of 
considering 
different 
interpreters, 
I 
consider 
the 
same 
interpreter 
in 
different 
cognitive 
situations. 
So 
let 
(4.xxxiv) 
“duagon” 
means 
*(regular) 
polygon 
with 
two 
sides* 
be 
the 
example 
under 
scrutiny 
(incidentally: 
the 
parentheses 
of 
(4.xxxiv) 
say 
that 
the 
specification 
of 
regularity 
is 
superfluous 
because, 
as 
we 
shall 
see, 
irregular 
polygons 
with 
two 
sides 
do 
not 
exist). 


4.11.1. 
Total 
definition. 
Plato 
never 
met 
“duagon” 
and 
never 
minded 
the 
notion 
of 
a 
polygon 
with 
two 
sides, 
then 
(4.xxxiv) 
defines 
a 
signification 
concerning 
a 
previously 
unknown 
term 
and 
a 
previously 
unknown 
meaning. 
4.11.2. 
Christening 
definition. 
Plato 
was 
previously 
convinced 
that 
Euclide’s 
notion 
of 
a 
polygon 
was 
too 
restrictive, 
since 
the 
case 
of 
n=2 
is 
neither 
considered; 
but 
the 
same 
Plato 
never 
coined 
a 
name 
for 
this 
new 
geometrical 
figure, 
nor 
met 
such 
a 
name 
before 
facing 
(4.xxxiv), 
which 
then 
assigns 
a 
previously 
unknown 
name 
to 
a 
previously 
known 
notion. 


4.11.3. 
Connotative 
definition. 
The 
advanced 
essay 
on 
plane 
geometry 
Plato 
is 
studying 
speaks 
of 
duagons 
without 
any 
explanation. 
-What 
is 
a 
duagon? 
he 
asks 
Socrates. 
And 
the 
master: 
-By 
definition 
a 
duagon 
is 
a 
regular 
polygon 
with 
two 
sides. 
4.11.4. 
Heuristic 
definition. 
Plato 
replies: 
-But 
what 
on 
earth 
is 
a 
regular 
polygon 
with 
two 
sides? 
And 
the 
master: 
-Have 
you 
a 
clear 
idea 
of 
a 
polygon 
with 
three 
or 
more 
sides? 

-Yes, 
I 
have. 
A 
polygon 
is 
a 
plane 
closed 
figure 
bounded 
by 
straight 
sides, 
so 
that 
if 
we 
start 
from 
a 


vertex 
and 
run 
along 
its 
perimeter, 
we 
come 
back 
to 
the 
point 
we 
started 
from. 
-Do 
you 
agree 
that 
a 
polygon 
with 
n>2 
sides 
is 
regular 
iff 
it 
is 
equiangular 
and 
equilateral? 
And 
Plato, 
after 
a 
quick 
reflection 
-Yes, 
I 
do. 


-Do 
you 
agree 
that 
the 
common 
value 
q 
of 
its 
n 
internal 
angles 
is 
(n 
-2)180°/ 
n? 
And 
Plato, 
after 
meticulous 
computations 
-Yes, 
I 
do. 
-Do 
you 
agree 
that, 
therefore, 
in 
a 
duagon 
the 
internal 
angles 
must 
be 
two, 
both 
of 
0°? 
-Yes, 
I 
do. 
-Do 
you 
agree 
that, 
once 
fixed 
a 
point 
as 
the 
starting 
vertex 
and 
an 
arbitrary 
segment 
as 
the 
first 
side, 
to 
follow 
with 
a 
0° 
internal 
angle 
is 
to 
come 
back 
towards 
the 
starting 
vertex? 
-Yes, 
I 
do, 
-Do 
you 
agree 
that 
a 
segment 
in 
going 
and 
coming 
back 
binds 
a 
closed 
plane 
figure 
(although 
with 
a 
null 
surface)? 
-Yes, 
I 
do. 
-Do 
you 
agree 
that 
such 
a 
figure 
satisfies 
all 
the 
mentioned 
requisites 
of 
a 
regular 
polygon? 
-Yes, 
I 
do. 
-Therefore 
you 
have 
a 
precise 
geometrical 
idea 
of 
what 
a 
regular 
polygon 
with 
two 
sides 
is. 
And 


indeed 
it 
complies 
too 
with 
our 
gross 
intuition 
according 
to 
which 
a 
regular 
polygon 
with 
n 
sides 
is 


the 
most 
regular 
polygonal 
arrangement 
of 
a 
regular 
polygon 
with 
n 
+1 
sides 
once 
we 
erase 
one 
of 
its 
sides. 
-But 
are 
we 
sure 
that 
also 
the 
other 
quantities 
characterizing 
the 
notion 
of 
a 
regular 
polygon 
apply 
as 
well 
to 
a 
duagon? 
-As 
far 
as 
I 
know, 
they 
do. 
For 
instance 
the 
notions 
of 
inscribed 
and 
circumscribed 
circumferences 
survive 
respectively 
in 
the 
middle 
point 
of 
the 
segment 
and 
in 
the 
circumference 
admitting 
it 
as 
a 
diameter. 
For 
instance 
the 
sum 
of 
its 
external 
angles 
(720°) 
continues 
satisfying 
the 
general 
formula 
n(360°-q). 
And 
so 
on. 
-I 
understand: 
a 
regular 
polygon 
with 
two 
sides 
is 
a 
couple 
of 
identical 
and 
superimposed 
segments. 


4.12. 
Besides 
the 
Socratic 
maieutics, 
heuristic 
definitions 
play 
a 
momentous 
role 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
human 
culture 
because 
many 
fundamental 
philosophic 
problems 
can 
be 
conceived 
as 
the 


research 
for 
an 
heuristic 
definition. 
The 
best 
example 
is 
Tarski’s 
research 
for 
a 
definition 
(definition, 
I 
emphasize) 
of 
“truth”. 
Awaiting 
it 
(Chapter 
5), 
I 
can 
remind 
St. 
Augustine’s 
reflection 
about 
*time*, 
or, 
even 
better, 
Frege’s 
studies 
on 
a 
satisfying 
definition 
(definition, 
I 
re-emphasize) 


of 
“number”. 
Also 
before 
the 
publication 
of 
his 
Die 
Grundlagen 
der 
Arithmetik, 
“number” 
and 
*number* 
were 
respectively 
a 
word 
and 
a 
notion 
of 
consolidated 
use 
(thence 
the 
heuristic 
character 
of 
the 
pursued 
definition), 
yet 
any 
attempt 
failed 
to 
answer 
the 
question: 
what 
is 
a 
number? 
For 
instance, 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
mathematician 
who 
claimed 
that 
“number” 
was 
nothing 
but 
a 
synonym 


of 
“difference” 
was 
to 
find 
out 
and 
display 
the 
connotation 
that, 
although 
hidden 
in 
the 
semantic 


tissue 
of 
ordinary 
language, 
is 
essential 
in 
*number*. 
And 
in 
order 
to 
understand 
that 
his 
claim 
is 


untenable 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
remember 
the 
bon-vivant 
who 
would 
be 
struck 
with 
horror 
at 
the 
idea 


that 
his 
“Vive 
la 
difference!” 
should 
be 
interpreted 
as 
an 
ode 
to 
the 
number. 



4.13. 
Let 
me 
insist 
through 
an 
example 
concerning 
a 
translation 
dictionary 
(in 
its 
two 
sections 
English-Italian 
and 
Italian-English, 
say). 
The 
manifest 
ellipticity 
of 
a 
formulation 
like 
(4.xxxv) 
meddlesome 
invadente 
is 
inconsequential 
because, 
since 
he 
who 
consults 
a 
dictionary 
is 
previously 
aware 
of 
the 
context 
(is 
previously 
aware 
that 
he 
is 
dealing 
with 
definitions), 
simplified 
graphic 
conventions 
are 
legitimate. 
And 
exactly 
the 
ellipticity 
of 
(4.xxxv) 
allows 
its 
reading 
as 
a 
definition 
by 
signification, 
or 
indifferently 
by 
semantic 
identity, 
or 
by 
synonymy; 
these 
readings 
follow 
directly 
from 
the 
interpretation 
of 
the 
mentioned 
graphic 
conventions. 
In 
all 
cases 
the 
same 
title 
of 
the 
volume 
under 
consultation 
(“English 
Italian 
Dictionary”, 
say), 
through 
its 
first 
word 
tells 
us 
that 
the 
first 
word 
of 
(4.xxxv) 
belongs 
to 
the 
lexicon 
of 
English, 
therefore 
that 
L1 
is 
English, 
and 
through 
its 
second 
word 
tells 
us 
that 
L2 
is 
Italian. 
Under 
a 
reading 
by 
signification 
(I 
evoke 
(4.xiii)) 
the 
boldface 
acts 
as 
a 
couple 
of 
inverted 
commas, 
the 
following 
space 
acts 
as 
a 
“s”, 
the 
Roman 
type 
acts 
as 
a 
pair 
of 
asterisks. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
under 
a 
reading 
by 
semantic 
identity, 
both 
boldface 
and 
Roman 
type 
act 
as 
asterisks, 
the 
space 
between 
them 
acts 
as 
a 
predication 
of 
(semantic) 
identity 
and 
so 
on. 
Now 
I 
analyze 
(4.xxxv) 
according 
to 
the 
cognitive 
endowment 
of 
four 
different 
readers. 


4.13.1. 
First 
reader. 
My 
deeply 
uncultured 
Italian 
friend 
Jim, 
glancing 
inattentively 
through 
the 
English-Italian 
section, 
meets 
casually 
(4.xxxv); 
thus 
he 
learns 
that 
this 
previously 
unknown 
“meddlesome” 
means 
in 
English 
the 
previously 
unknown 
*invadente*I 
and 
fills 
his 
latter 
informational 
lack 
by 
asking 
me 
what 
“invadente” 
means 
in 
Italian. 
For 
Jim 
(4.xxxv) 
is 
then 
a 
total 
definition. 


4.13.2. 
Second 
reader. 
My 
semi-cultured 
English 
friend 
Ted, 
who 
knows 
the 
meaning 
of 
“meddlesome”, 
consults 
that 
voice 
to 
learn 
the 
Italian 
adjective 
such 
a 
meaning 
is 
adduced 
by. 
For 
Ted 
(4.xxxv) 
is 
then 
a 
christening 
definition 
telling 
him 
that 
“invadente” 
is 
the 
Italian 
adjective 
he 
is 
searching 
for. 
4.13.3. 
Third 
reader. 
My 
semi-cultured 
Italian 
friend 
Bob 
meets 
“meddlesome” 
while 
he 
is 
reading 
an 
English 
novel 
and, 
since 
he 
does 
not 
know 
its 
meaning 
(since 
he 
does 
not 
know 
*meddlesome*E), 
he 
brings 
himself 
to 
consult 
the 
voice 
“meddlesome” 
in 
the 
dictionary. 
For 
Bob 
(4.xxxv) 
is 
then 
a 
connotative 
definition 
telling 
him 
that 
the 
well 
known 
*invadente*I 
is 
the 
meaning 
to 
correlate 
with 
the 
well 
known 
“meddlesome” 
he 
was 
starting 
from. 
4.13.4. 
Fourth 
reader. 
My 
superficially 
polyglot 
friend 
Tom 
knows 
vaguely 
that 
*meddlesome*E 
is 
a 
rather 
negative 
connotation, 
then 
he 
consults 
the 
dictionary 
just 
to 
improve 
this 
fuzzy 
signification. 
For 
Tom 
(4.xxxv) 
is 
then 
a 
heuristic 
definition. 


4.13.5. 
Concisely. 
The 
English-Italian 
section, 
normally, 
is 
a 
book 
of 
christening 
definitions 
when 
in 
English 
hands, 
and 
a 
book 
of 
connotative 
definitions 
when 
in 
Italian 
hands. 
Vice 
versa, 
obviously, 
as 
for 
the 
Italian-English 
section. 
4.14. 
Another 
interesting 
and 
non-fictitious 
example 
concerns 
*planet*. 
The 
four 
contexts 
can 
be 
clearly 
singled 
out, 
as 
ancient 
astronomers 
observed 
that 
seven 
heavenly 
bodies 
were 
in 
apparent 
wandering 
motion 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
and 
agreed 
to 
call 
them 
“planets” 

(“planaw” 
GRDE 
“I 
wander”), 
but 
just 
in 
our 
days 
a 
congress 
of 
astronomers 
is 
discussing 
the 
precise 
connotations 
a 
heavenly 
body 
must 
possess 
in 
order 
to 
be 
classified 
as 
a 
planet, 
While 
this 
congress 
is 
pursuing 
a 
heuristic 
definition, 
the 
absolutely 
incompetent 
Plato 
who, 
reading 
an 
astronomical 
report, 
asks 
Socrates 
“What 
is 
a 
planet?” 
is 
pursuing 
a 
connotative 
definition 
et 
cetera. 


4.15. 
The 
tripartition 
of 
§4.3 
and 
the 
tetrapartition 
of 
§4.10 
are 
completely 
independent. 
The 
latter 
can 
be 
applied 
to 
definitions 
by 
semantic 
identity 
or 
by 
synonymy, 
but 
even 
to 
ostensive 
definitions. 
For 
instance 
the 
mother 
uttering 
“hat” 
is 
performing 
-a 
total 
definition 
if 
the 
child 
ignores 
both 
the 
notion 
of 
a 
covering 
for 
the 
head 
and 
the 
uttered 
word 
-a 
christening 
definition 
if 
her 
son 
already 
knows 
the 
notion 
but 
ignores 
the 
word, 
-a 
connotative 
definition 
if 
the 
child 
asked 
her 
what 
is 
a 
hat 
(he 
knows 
the 
word 
but 
ignores 
its 
meaning) 
-a 
heuristic 
definition 
if 
the 
child 
is 
learning 
that 
there 
are 
covering 
for 
the 
head 
which 
are 
not 
hats, 
but 
caps, 
helmets 
et 
cetera. 

CHAPTER 
5 
OBJECTS 
OF 
TRUTH 


5.1. 
I 
call 
“alethics” 
(from 
“aleqeia”) 
the 
doctrine 
studying 
the 
matter 
of 
truth, 
once 
*matter 
of 
truth* 
is 
assumed 
in 
the 
wide 
acceptation 
according 
to 
which, 
for 
instance, 
also 
the 
notions 
of 
decidability, 
probability, 
falsity 
concern 
the 
matter 
of 
truth. 
This 
notwithstanding, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
concision, 
everywhere 
possible 
I 
will 
reason 
only 
on 
*true*, 
entrusting 
the 
reader 
with 
the 
immediate 
extrapolations. 
Consequently 
I 
call 
“alesis” 
a 
statement 
where 
an 
alethic 
attribute 
is 
ascribed 
to 
an 
object 
statement. 
Why 
a 
new 
word? 
To 
fill 
a 
lexical 
gap. 
“False”. 
“decidable” 
et 
cetera 
adduce 
alethic 
attributes 
(values) 
just 
as 
“female”, 
“hermaphrodite” 
et 
cetera 
adduce 
sexual 
attributes 
(values). 
Without 
the 
new 
word, 
for 
instance, 
we 
should 
say 
that 
“false” 
adduces 
a 
truth 
attribute, 
and 
this 
seems 
to 
me 
a 


para-oxymoron 
like 
saying 
that 
“female” 
adduces 
an 
attribute 
of 
masculinity. 
Furthermore 
every 
important 
doctrine 
has 
its 
specific 
name, 
and 
for 
sure 
alethics 
is 
an 
important 
one. 


5.2. 
The 
only 
aim 
of 
this 
chapter 
is 
to 
show 
that 
the 
question 
(5.i) 
are 
sentences 
or 
propositions 
the 
very 
objects 
of 
truth? 
admits 
only 
one 
consistent 
answer: 
propositions. 
In 
subsequent 
chapters 
alethics 
will 
be 
faced 


formally 
through 
an 
axiomatic 
system 
where 
deductive 
logic 
becomes 
simply 
a 
border 
case 
of 
inductive 
one. 


5.2.1. 
Indeed, 
at 
first 
sight, 
(5.i) 
seems 
a 
pseudoproblem. 
Already 
Parsons 
(1974, 
Note 
p.407) 
had 
written: 
I 
assume 
that 
the 
primary 
truth 
vehicles 
are 
sentences; 
otherwise 
“is 
true” 
should 
be 
read 
as 
“expresses 
a 
true 
proposition”. 
And 
Gupta 
(1982, 
p.4): 
I 
assume 
that 
the 
objects 
of 
truth 
are 
sentences…... 
A 
more 
intensional 
proposal, 
such 
as 
that 
the 
objects 
of 
truth 
are 
… 
propositions, 
is 
not 
acceptable 
to 
us 
…. 
In 
any 
case 
a 
theorist 
who 
insists 
that 
it 
is 
the 
latter 
that 
are 
the 
objects 
of 
truth 
may 
take 
us 
to 
be 
giving 
a 
theory 
not 
of 
truth 
but 
rather 
of 
the 
concept 
“being 
a 
sentence 
that 
expresses 
a 
true 
… 
proposition”. 


On 
these 
grounds 
their 
basic 
argument 
can 
be 
extrapolated 
as 
follows: 
these 
who 
insist 
that 
propositions 
are 
the 
objects 
of 
truth 
can 
define 
“veracious” 
(“fallacious” 
et 
cetera) 
to 
mean 
*expressing 
a 
true 
(a 
false 
et 
cetera) 
proposition* 
and 
refer 
the 
theory 
to 
veraciousness 
(fallaciousness 
et 
cetera). 
I 
call 
such 
an 
argument 
“pertinence 
trick” 
to 
mean 
simply 
that 
in 
my 
opinion 
it 
is 
intrinsically 
misleading. 


5.3. 
The 
current 
canonical 
position, 
according 
to 
which 
sentences 
are 
the 
actual 
objects 
of 
truth, 
follows 
from 
a 
famous 
article 
(1943), 
where 
Tarski, 
inquiring 
into 
a 
definition 
(definition, 
I 
reemphasize) 
of 
truth, 
claims 
that 
his 
purpose 
is 
not 
to 
assign 
a 
new 
meaning 
to 
a 
familiar 
word, 
but, 

on 
the 
contrary, 
to 
understand 
its 
current 
meaning. 
I 
agree 
totally 
with 
his 
purpose: 
the 
task 
is 
not 
to 
dictate 
a 
sovereign 
(stipulative) 
definition, 
but 
to 
reach 
an 
heuristic 
one. 
Then 
both 
of 
us 
agree 
that 


(5.ii) 
when 
we 
currently 
say 
that 
something 
is 
true 
what 
are 
we 
speaking 
of? 
is 
an 
equivalent 
formulation 
of 
(5.i). 
Tarski 
remarks 
that 
“true” 
is 
used 
with 
reference 
sometimes 
to 
sentences, 
and 
sometimes 
to 
propositions, 
yet 
he 
concludes 
that 
for 
many 
reasons 
the 
former 
choice 
represents 
the 
best 
one, 
also 
because 
“proposition” 
is 
a 
term 
whose 
meaning 
has 
been 
very 
debated 
but 
never 
satisfactorily 
clarified 
(certain 
ideal 
entities 
called 
“propositions”). 
Since 
he 
does 
not 
expose 
the 
many 
reasons 
supporting 
his 
choice 
I 
cannot 
discuss 
them; 
anyhow 
I 
can 
expose 
some 
very 
strong 
arguments 
supporting 
my 
claim 
according 
to 
which 
sentences, 
far 
from 
being 
the 
best 
choice, 
are 
even 
an 
incoherent 
one. 


5.4. 
The 
first 
argument 
is 
based 
on 
a 
rule 
I 
call 
“criterion 
of 
influence”. 
By 
no 
predicate 
can 
concern 
a 
kind 
of 
referent 
whose 
characteristics 
do 
not 
influence 
the 
alethic 
value 
of 
the 
respective 
message 


I 
epitomize 
a 
propaedeutic 
version 
of 
this 
criterion, 
whose 
obviousness 
is 
promptly 
showed 
through 
some 
minute 
examples. 


5.4.1. 
Bob 
shows 
us 
a 
one 
dollar 
banknote 
and 
says 
(5.iii) 
it 
is 
a 
little 
bill, 
indeed 
thus 
puzzling 
us: 
is 
he 
speaking 
‘syntactically’ 
of 
its 
small 
size 
or 
is 
he 
speaking 
‘semantically’ 
of 
its 
poor 
purchasing 
power? 
In 
other 
words: 
does 
his 
“little”, 
which 
surely 
pertains 
to 
the 
banknote, 
also 
regard 
the 
banknote 
itself 
or 
rather 
its 
purchasing 
power? 
Of 
course, 
as 
logicians, 
we 
cannot 
follow 
the 
simplest 
procedure 
(to 
submit 
directly 
our 
perplexity 
to 
Bob). 
Yet 
Tom 
is 
enlightened 
by 
a 
genial 
idea: 


is 
this 
one 
little 
too? 


he 
asks 
Bob 
showing 
him 
a 
1000$ 
banknote. 
If 
Bob 
answers 


yes, 
obviously! 


we 
all 
understand 
that 
(5.iii) 
speaks 
of 
the 
size; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
if 
Bob 
answers 


no, 
obviously! 


we 
all 
understand 
that 
(5.iii) 
speaks 
of 
the 
purchasing 
power. 
Why? 
Because, 
since 
the 
two 
banknotes 
have 
the 
same 
size 
and 
a 
very 
different 
purchasing 
power, 
if 
a 
change 
involving 
only 
the 



purchasing 
power 
overturns 
Bob’s 
opinion, 
surely 
he 
was 
not 
speaking 
of 
the 
size 
(as 
to 
the 
size, 
nothing 
is 
changed). 
Et 
cetera. 


5.4.2. 
Another 
example 
(§3.2.2) 
is 
the 
lady’s 
cross-word. 
Her 
(5.iv) 
-shuffler-is 
too 
short 
cannot 
but 
refer 
to 
the 
word 
intended 
as 
a 
graphic 
type 
because 
any 
modification 
preserving 
the 
same 
graphic 
type 
(any 
modification 
of 
the 
phonetics 
or 
of 
the 
graphic 
token) 
is 
of 
no 
moment 
as 
for 
the 
alethic 
value 
of 
(5.iv). 


5.4.3. 
The 
criterion 
of 
influence, 
above 
applied 
to 
-is 
little-and 
to 
-is 
too 
short-, 
can 
be 
identically 
applied 
to 
any 
alethic 
predicate 
(that 
is 
to 
any 
alesis). 
On 
its 
basis 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
ascertain 
whether 
an 
alesis, 
so 
to 
say, 
is 
homonymy-independent 
or 
synonymy-independent. 
An 
easy 
task 
indeed, 
since 
we 
can 
ascertain 
both 
the 
homonymy 
dependence 
and 
the 
synonymy 
independence 
of 
an 
alesis. 
In 
fact, 
since 
in 
a 
situation 
where 
different 
sentences 
adduce 
the 
same 
proposition 
the 
alethic 
value 
must 
be 
only 
one, 
while 
in 
the 
reciprocal 
situation 
(only 
one 
sentence 
adducing 
different 
propositions) 
the 
alethic 
values 
may 
be 
different, 
alethic 
predicates 
cannot 
regard 
sentences 
and 
can 
regard 
propositions. 
5.4.4. 
Let 
me 
recall 
the 
example 
of 
§1.9.2. 
Bob 
wishes 
a 
new 
female 
swan 
to 
marry 
his 
cob 
and 
a 
new 
instrument 
for 
ink 
in 
his 
drawings, 
yet, 
since 
he 
cannot 
meet 
both 
expenses, 
he 
renounces 
the 
latter. 
Then, 
since 
(5.v) 
Bob 
bought 
a 
pen 
is 
only 
one 
sentence, 
should 
we 
insist 
on 
the 
syntactical 
pertinence 
of 
alethic 
predicates, 
we 
ought 
to 
conclude 
that 
(4.v) 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
true 
(under 
the 
zoological 
interpretation 
of 
“pen”) 
and 
false 
(under 
the 
other 
one), 
so 
falling 
into 
incoherence. 
On 
the 
contrary 
if 
we 
acknowledge 
that 
alethic 
predicates 
pertain 
to 
propositions, 
all 
is 
right: 
since 
“pen” 
is 
a 
homonymy 
bearer, 
(4.v) 
adduces 
(at 
least) 
two 
different 
propositions, 
and 
while 
one 
of 
them 
is 
true, 
the 
other 
is 
false. 
In 
other 
words. 
The 
truth 
(or 
falsity 
et 
cetera) 
of 


(5.vi) 
A 
female 
swan 
has 
been 
purchased 
by 
Bob 
can 
be 
inferred 
from 
the 
truth 
(or 
falsity 
et 
cetera) 
of 
(5.v) 
in 
its 
zoological 
interpretation; 
and 
vice 
versa. 
But 
what 
(5.v) 
in 
its 
zoological 
interpretation 
and 
(5.vi) 
have 
in 
common 
is 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
they 
adduce, 
surely 
not 
the 
linguistic 
vehicle 
adducing 
such 
a 
piece 
of 
information. 
And 
just 
because 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
is 
the 
same, 
the 
alethic 
value 
must 
be 
the 
same. 


5.4.5. 
Another 
example. 
Here 
we 
have 
two 
documents: 
the 
(ideographic) 
report 
of 
the 
Japanese 
Intelligence 
about 
the 
secret 
nuclear 
programs 
of 
an 
Asian 
State, 
and 
its 
English 
translation. 
Once 
agreed 
by 
hypothesis 
that 
the 
translation 
is 
perfect 
(contents-conservative) 
we 
cannot 
coherently 
assign 
different 
alethic 
values 
to 
the 
two 
reports., 
though 
their 
texts 
are 
radically 
different. 
And 
why 
is 
it 
necessary 
to 
suppose 
that 
the 
translation 
is 
perfect? 
Merely 
because 
it 
it 
were 
not, 
a 
discrepancy 

in 
the 
respective 
contents 
(meanings, 
propositions) 
could 
justify 
the 
assignation 
of 
two 
different 
alethic 
values. 


5.5. 
The 
argument 
is 
immediately 
extrapolable 
from 
informational 
identities 
to 
informational 
implications. 
For 
instance 
it 
would 
be 
manifestly 
incoherent 
to 
state 
that 
Bill 
is 
an 
Irish 
setter 


is 
true 
and 
that 


Bill 
is 
a 
dog 


is 
false 
just 
because 
*Irish 
setter* 
implies 
*dog*, 
and 
this 
meaning 
dependence 
entails 
an 
alethic 
dependence. 
Reciprocally 
if 
we 
know 
that 
the 
truth 
of 


This 
animal 
is 
a 
celep 


implies 
the 
falsity 
of 


This 
animal 
is 
a 
bird 


we 
do 
not 
need 
to 
know 
exactly 
what 
a 
celep 
is 
to 
conclude 
that 
*celep* 
implies 
*non-bird*. 


5.5.1. 
Of 
course 
we 
cannot 
forbid 
Tarski 
and 
his 
epigones 
to 
agree 
that 
a 
sentence 
is 
veracious 
iff 
it 
adduces 
a 
true 
proposition. 
Actually 
heuristic 
definitions 
allow 
the 
introduction 
of 
attributes 
whose 
pertinence 
depends 
on 
our 
free 
choices. 
This 
notwithstanding 
the 
regard 
of 
such 
attributes 
is 
not 
at 
all 
free; 
and 
so 
then 
assimilating 
the 
use 
of 
“veracious” 
to 
the 
current 
use 
of 
“true” 
is 
radically 
untenable. 
We 
come 
back 
to 
Bob’s 
cuckoldries 
(§2.9). 
A 
theory 
of 
conjugal 
honesty 
grounded 
on 
a 
definition 
as 
“cuckold” 
means 
*husband 
of 
an 
unfaithful 
wife* 


is 
an 
only 
apparent 
‘husbandization’ 
of 
the 
matter: 
undoubtedly 
husbands 
are 
the 
objects 
of 
cuckholdness, 
but 
to 
dog 
husbands 
would 
be 
a 
stupid 
measure 
just 
because 
the 
only 
way 
to 
ascertain 
if 
a 
husband 
is 
a 
cuckold 
is 
to 
ascertain 
if 
his 
wife 
is 
unfaithful. 
Therefore 
we 
fall 
again 
into 
a 
situation 
dealing 
with 
the 
behaviour 
of 
a 
wife. 
Analogously, 
since 
we 
have 
ascertained 
that 
in 
its 
current 
use 
*true* 
necessarily 
concerns 
propositions, 
a 
theory 
of 
veraciousness 
grounded 
on 
the 
assumption 
of 
“veracious” 
as 
an 
abbreviation 
of 
“expressing 
a 
true 
proposition” 
is 
an 
only 
apparent 
‘syntactization’ 
of 
the 
matter. 
For 
instance, 
we 
can 
assign 
an 
alethic 
value 
to 


“Ava 
loves 
Bob 
or 
Tom” 
is 
a 
disjunctive 
sentence 



on 
the 
basis 
of 
merely 
syntactic 
considerations 
(roughly: 
a 
sentence 
is 
disjunctive 
iff 
an 
“or” 
occurs); 
but 
in 
order 
to 
assign 
an 
alethic 
value 
to 


”Ava 
loves 
Bob 
or 
Tom” 
is 
a 
veracious 
sentence 


we 
must 
ascertain 
whether 
Ava 
loves 
Bob 
or 
Tom, 
then 
whether 
*Ava 
loves 
Bob 
or 
Tom* 
is 
true. 
And 
exactly 
because 
scrutinizing 
the 
sentence 
without 
looking 
at 
the 
proposition 
would 
be 
a 
hopeless 
procedure, 
the 
appeal 
to 
“veracious” 
is 
a 
mere 
artifice; 
such 
an 
attribute 
pertains 
to 
sentences, 
but 
unavoidably 
regards 
propositions. 
Here 
is 
the 
pertinence 
trick. 


5.6. 
In 
subsequent 
chapters 
all 
these 
intuitive 
conclusions 
will 
be 
formally 
derived 
from 
a 
strictly 
axiomatic 
definition 
of 
*true* 
(*false* 
et 
cetera). 
However 
they 
represent 
a 
massive 
proof 
that 
when 
in 
our 
everyday 
language 
we 
say 
that 
something 
is 
true 
(or 
false 
et 
cetera) 
we 
(necessarily 
though 
perhaps 
unconsciously) 
are 
referring 
to 
pieces 
of 
information. 
I 
write 
“pieces 
of 
information” 
instead 
of 
“propositions” 
in 
order 
to 
point 
out 
that 
a 
very 
general 
discourse 
about 
the 
objects 
of 
truth 
cannot 
be 
limited 
to 
propositions. 
In 
fact 
the 
Tarskian 
dilemma 
sentences 
or 
propositions? 


is 
reductive, 
since 
it 
tacitly 
presupposes 
a 
linguistic 
component 
while, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
alethic 
predicates 
can 
also 
be 
ascribed 
to 
non-linguistic 
objects, 
that 
is 
to 
non-linguistically 
mediated 
pieces 
of 
information. 


A 
proposition 
is 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
a 
sentence, 
where 
a 
sentence 
is 
a 
sequence 
of 
words 
concatenated 
in 
compliance 
with 
well 
specifiable 
rules 
of 
formation. 
But 
even 
if 
we 
widen 
*language* 
(then 
*sentence*) 
in 
order 
to 
admit 
also 
non 
strictly 
linguistic 
transmissions 
of 
signs, 
the 
consequently 
widened 
*proposition* 
is 
still 
insufficient 
to 
contain 
the 
pieces 
of 
information 
acquired 
without 
any 
intervention 
of 
signs. 
Therefore, 
since 
alethic 
predicates 
can 
be 
properly 
ascribed 
to 
such 
pieces 
of 
information 
too, 
it 
would 
be 
reductive 
to 
claim 
that 
propositions 
are 
the 
very 
object 
of 


truth. 
The 
very 
objects 
of 
truth 
are 
pieces 
of 
information, 
and 
propositions 
are 
only 
a 
subset 
(the 
linguistically 
mediated 
pieces 
of 
information). 


5.6.1. 
An 
example. 
Immersed 
in 
a 
thick 
fog 
and 
escorted 
by 
my 
mastiff 
Tabù 
I 
am 
going 
through 
an 
unknown 
vineyard. 
Suddenly 
we 
realize 
that 
a 
gigantic, 
anthropomorphic 
and 
hostile 
figure 
is 
bobbing 
very 
close 
to 
us. 
While 
my 
heart 
goes 
mad, 
Tabù 
growls 
darkly. 
Two 
ridiculous 
reactions, 
because 
a 
bee-master’s 
overalls 
hanging 
from 
a 
branch 
and 
tossed 
by 
a 
gust 
of 
wind 
can 
neither 
represent 
a 
danger, 
nor 
can 
be 
intimidated 
by 
a 
dark 
growl. 
Though 
(5.vii) 
a 
gigantic, 
anthropomorphic 
and 
hostile 
figure 
is 
threatening 
us 
is 
a 
reasonable 
way 
to 
express 
in 
English 
the 
conviction 
which 
caused 
my 
reaction, 
I 
firmly 
believe 
that 
no 
linguistic 
mediation 
intervened 
in 
the 
process, 
also 
because 
finding 
acceptable 
words 
for 
describing 
the 
experience 
would 
have 
requested 
much 
more 
time 
than 
the 
flashing 
start 
of 
my 
tachycardia. 
And 
anyhow 
it 
is 
obvious 
that 
no 
linguistic 
mediation 
is 
hypothesizable 
in 
a 
dog, 
particularly 
in 
a 
dog 
whose 
intelligence 
is 
rather 
torpid. 
Then, 
the 
immediate 
and 
alinguistic 
information 
which 
finds 
in 
something 
like 
(5.vii) 
its 
linguistic 
expression 
was 
false 
(actually 
our 
reactions 
are 
ridiculous 
because 
dictated 
by 
a 
quite 
erroneous 



interpretation 
of 
certain 
sensorial 
perceptions). 
Neither 
are 
the 
overalls 
a 
sign, 
as 
the 
bee-master 
who 
hanged 
it 
on 
the 
branch 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
communicate 
anything 
to 
anybody. 
This 
notwithstanding 
I 
am 
quite 
legitimated 
to 
say 
that 
I 
mistook 
myself, 
then 
that 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
which 
finds 
in 


(5.vii) 
its 
linguistic 
formulation 
was 
already 
false 
before 
finding 
such 
a 
formulation; 
but 
thus 
I 
am 
ascribing 
an 
alethic 
predicate 
to 
a 
non-propositional 
piece 
of 
information. 
More 
about 
this 
matter 
in 
§13.8.1. 
5.6.2. 
In 
this 
essay 
we 
shall 
only 
deal 
with 
linguistic 
sentences 
and 
consequently 
with 
pieces 
of 
information 
whose 
propositional 
trait 
is 
assured. 
Yet 
these 
considerations 
about 
non-propositional 
pieces 
of 
information 
are 
not 
superfluous, 
since 
they 
show 
that 
the 
informational 
approach 
looks 
at 
the 
whole 
matter 
from 
a 
higher 
viewpoint. 
I 
mean 
that 
while 
the 
occurrence 
of 
a 
sign 
is 
necessary 
to 
configure 
a 
sentence 
(in 
its 
widest 
acceptation 
of 
a 
linguistic 
informational 
source), 
no 
occurrence 
of 
a 
sign 
is 
necessary 
to 
configure 
the 
source 
of 
an 
alethic 
object. 
Hence 
a 
concise 
argument 
supporting 
the 
impossibility 
to 
give 
the 
syntactical 
solution 
to 
(5.ii): 
logic 
was 
born 
millions 
years 
before 
any 
language 
therefore, 
either 
logic 
does 
not 
concern 
sentences, 
or 
through 
millions 
of 
years 
it 
existed 
without 
any 
concern. 
Once 
clarified 
this 
point, 
the 
mentioned 
linguistic 
character 
of 
the 
matter 
under 
scrutiny 
induces 
me 
to 
continue 
speaking 
of 
propositions 
to 
mean 
generically 
*pieces 
of 
information*. 


5.7. 
A 
classical 
argument 
against 
the 
claim 
that 
sentences 
are 
the 
objects 
of 
truth 
is 
based 
on 
indexicality. 
According 
to 
it, 
for 
instance, 
since 
the 
alethic 
value 
of 
a 
message 
like 
(5.viii) 
yesterday 
it 
was 
raining 
here 
varies 
with 
the 
moment 
“yesterday” 
and 
the 
place 
“here” 
refer 
to, 
it 
cannot 
concern 
the 
sentence, 
which 
is 
always 
the 
same. 
I 
obviously 
agree 
with 
the 
conclusion, 
yet 
I 
think 
that 
the 
argument 
does 
not 
grip. 
Very 
briefly 
(awaiting 
the 
detailed 
analysis 
proposed 
in 
Chapter 
16). 
Indexical 
terms 
are 
contextual 
variables, 
that 
is 
variables 
whose 
contingent 
values 
are 
fixed 
by 
the 
context 
in 
which 
they 
are 
uttered; 
therefore, 
since 
(5.viii) 
is 
an 
open 
sentence 
(a 
free-variables-laden 
sentence), 
the 
adduced 
(open) 
proposition 
can 
be 
alethically 
judged 
only 
after 
its 
closure 
(after 
the 
promotion 
of 
its 
two 
indexical 
variables). 
In 
this 
sense 
(5.viii) 
is 
a 
scheme 
of 
various 
free-variable-free 
sentences, 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
different 
free-variable-free 
sentences 
have 
potentially 
different 
alethic 
values 
is 
not 
evidence 
against 
the 
syntactic 
regard 
of 
alethic 
attributes. 



CHAPTER 
6 
REPRESENTATION 


6.1. 
In 
order 
to 
achieve 
an 
axiomatization 
of 
the 
informational 
approach 
in 
the 
easiest 
way, 
I 
begin 
by 
reasoning 
informally 
under 
some 
schematizations. 
Though 
in 
our 
everyday 
practice 
a 
reliability 
degree 
(from 
0 
to 
1, 
say) 
can 
be 
associated 
to 
any 
piece 
of 
information 
belonging 
to 
our 
knowledge, 
for 
the 
moment 
we 
only 
consider 
the 
extreme 
values, 
thus 
sharply 
opposing 
*known* 
to 
*unknown*. 


For 
instance 
let 
me 
consider 
three 
consecutive 
tosses 
of 
a 
well-balanced 
coin. 
Since 
any 
outcome 
is 
either 
head 
(A) 
or 
tail 
(B); 
the 
possibility 
space 
W 
of 
such 
a 
sequence 
contains 
eight 
alternatives 
(either 
AAA 
or 
AAB 
or 
ABA 
or 
ABB 
or 
BAA 
or 
BAB 
or 
BBA 
or 
BBB). 


I 
call 
“basic 
statute” 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
k° 
defining 
W 
and 
“acquirement” 
any 


subsequent 
piece 
of 
information 
k’ 
concerning 
the 
same 
W. 
Simple 
but 
general 
evidence 
is 
that 
any 
acquirement 
corresponds 
to 
the 
preclusion 
of 
some 
alternative 
(and 
vice 
versa). 
For 
instance 
to 
learn 
that 
two 
consecutive 
but 
not 
better 
specified 
tosses 
gave 
the 
same 
but 
not 
better 
specified 
outcome 


precludes 
ABA 
and 
BAB. 
I 
call 
“free” 
the 
non-precluded 
alternatives 
and 
“statute 
(of 
g 
at 
t 
about 
W)” 


the 
conjunction 
k=k°&k’, 
that 
is 
the 
whole 
information 
about 
W 
possessed 
by 
the 
knower 
g 
at 
the 


moment 
t. 


6.2. 
In 
order 
not 
to 
waste 
time 
with 
analyses 
of 
negligible 
interest, 
the 
coherence 
of 
the 
statute 
is 
presupposed; 
this 
only 
means 
that 
the 
eventual 
incoherence 
of 
a 
statute 
must 
be 
explicitly 
remarked. 
The 
existence 
of 
a 
statute 
does 
not 
entail 
the 
ontological 
reality 
of 
the 
universe 
it 
describes. 
Since 
both 
information 
and 
imagination 
are 
mental 
things, 
we 
can 
speak 
of 
Plato 
(whose 
historical 
existence 
is 
sure) 
exactly 
as 
we 
can 
speak 
of 
Homer 
(whose 
historical 
existence 
is 
controversial) 
or 
of 


Polyphemus. 
Analogously, 
in 
order 
to 
reason 
on 
our 
W 
, 
it 
is 
not 
at 
all 
necessary 
to 
perform 
materially 
the 
tosses. 
Of 
course 
a 
radical 
difference 
distinguishes 
the 
actual 
world 
from 
fictitious 
ones, 
giving 
the 
former 
a 
quite 
privileged 
role; 
yet 
this 
topic 
will 
be 
analysed 
in 
Chapter 
13. 


6.3. 
The 
informational 
approach 
is 
strongly 
helped 
by 
the 
intensional 
representation 
® 
whose 
main 
lines 
I 
am 
about 
to 
illustrate. 
6.3.1. 
Figure 
6.1 



illustrates 
the 
first 
basic 
idea 
of 
®: 
representing 
k° 
by 
a 
circle 
partitioned 
in 
as 
many 
sectors 
as 
the 


alternatives 
of 
the 
respective 
possibility 
space 
W: 
so, 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
example 
above, 
the 
sector 
1 


represents 
AAA 
et 
cetera, 
till 
the 
sector 
8 
for 
BBB. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
concision 
“sector 
representing 
the 
outcome 
so 
and 
so” 
can 
be 
abbreviated 
in 
“sector 
so 
and 
so” 
and 
“outcome 
represented 
by 
the 
sector 
so 
and 
so” 
in 
“outcome 
so 
and 
so”. 
These 
terminological 
licenses 
are 
not 
affected 
by 
any 
reasonable 
risk 
of 
interpretative 
confusions. 


6.3.1.1. 
Incidentally. 
I 
choose 
a 
circle 
to 
recall 
Venn’s 
diagrams, 
yet, 
if 
the 
alternatives 
were 
numerous, 
dealing 
with 
very 
narrow 
sectors 
would 
be 
an 
annoying 
practice; 
then 
a 
more 
general 
convention 
could 
represent 
k° 
with 
a 
rectangle 
of 
convenient 
size, 
partitioned 
in 
the 
necessary 
number 
of 
sub-rectangles. 


6.3.2. 
The 
second 
basic 
idea 
of 
® 
is 
representing 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
h 
(for 
the 
moment 
h 
can 
indifferently 
be 
an 
acquirement 
or 
an 
hypothesis) 
by 
shading 
the 
sectors 
respectively 


precluded. 
Each 
of 
the 
2n 
different 
pieces 
of 
information 
concerning 
a 
possibility 
space 
of 
n 
alternatives 
can 
thus 
be 
unequivocally 
represented. 
For 
instance 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
that 
a 
not 
better 
specified 
outcome 
is 
B 
is 
represented 
by 
shading 
the 
sector 
1 
(obviously 
if 
an 
unspecified 


outcome 
is 
B, 
every 
sequence 
is 
possible 
except 
AAA); 
analogously 
the 
piece 
of 
information 


(6.i) 
the 
first 
outcome 
is 
B 
is 
represented 
by 
shading 
the 
sectors 
1, 
2, 
3 
and 
4 
because, 
of 
course, 
(6.i) 
precludes 
the 
four 
possible 
sequences 
whose 
first 
outcome 
is 
A. 


I 
call 
“virgin” 
any 
non 
shaded 
sector 
and 
“virgin 
field” 
the 
union 
of 
the 
virgin 
sectors. 
So, 
for 
instance, 
the 
virgin 
field 
representing 
(6.i) 
is 
the 
lower 
semicircle. 


The 
intensionality 
of 
Ò 
results 
from 
the 
above 
explained 
ideas. 
Since 
its 
space 
does 
not 
represent 
sets 
of 
individuals, 
but 
pieces 
of 
information, 
any 
increment 
of 
information 
is 
represented 
by 
an 
increment 
of 
the 
shaded 
field, 
therefore 
by 
a 
decrement 
of 
the 
virgin 
field. 
In 
this 
sense 
the 
virgin 
field 
represents 
the 
residual 
margin 
of 
uncertainty. 


6.3.3. 
Exactly 
in 
order 
to 
comply 
with 
this 
approach 
the 
third 
basic 
idea 
of 
® 
is 
representing 
any 
alternative 
by 
a 
sector 
whose 
area 
depends 
on 
the 
characteristics 
of 
the 
represented 
universe, 
that 
is, 



roughly 
speaking, 
on 
the 
probability 
of 
the 
respective 
alternative. 
I 
make 
myself 
clearer. 
Until 
now 
I 
reasoned 
under 
a 
tacit 
assumption: 
the 
equiprobability 
of 
the 
various 
outcomes 
(here 
is 
the 
reason 


why 
I 
specified 
that 
the 
coin 
is 
well-balanced). 
And 
actually 
Figure 
6.1 
is 
suited 
to 
represent 
also 
different 
operative 
contexts, 
provided 
that 
the 
octo-partition 
of 
the 
respective 
possibility 
spaces 
be 
uniform. 
For 
instance, 
so 
that 
Figure 
6.1 
can 
correctly 
represent 
the 
results 
of 
a 
well 
balanced 
mini-
roulette 
with 
eight 
numbers, 
the 
condition 
must 
hold 
that 
the 
eight 
boxes 
have 
the 
same 
size. 
A 
well 
balanced 
mini-roulette 
where 
the 
numbers 
1 
and 
2 
have 
a 
box 
of 
80°, 
the 
numbers 
3, 
4, 
5 
and 
6 
have 
a 
box 
of 
40°, 
the 
numbers 
7 
and 
8 
have 
a 
box 
of 
20°, 
finds 
its 
correct 
(even 
iconic) 
representation 
in 
Figure 
6.2. 


6.4. 
I 
call 
“measure 
(of 
h 
under 
k°)”, 
and 
I 
symbolize 
by 
(6.ii) 
mk°(h) 
the 
quantity 
represented 
by 
the 
area 
of 
the 
h&k°-virgin 
field. 
Of 
course 
to 
speak 
of 
a 
triple 
ák°,h,mñ 


would 
be 
a 
more 
canonical 
(but, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
an 
intuitively 
less 
adequate) 
expressive 
way. 
So, 
for 
instance, 
with 
reference 
to 
an 
octo-partitioned 
mini 
roulette, 
the 
measure 
of 


(6.iii) 
the 
outcome 
is 
<5 
is 
represented 
by 
shading 
the 
inferior 
semicircle 
if 
we 
refer 
to 
the 
k° 
of 
Figure 
6.1, 
while 
it 
is 


represented 
by 
shading 
the 
last 
third 
of 
the 
circle 
if 
we 
refer 
to 
the 
k° 
of 
Figure 
6.2; 
in 
fact 
as 
(6.iii) 
precludes 
the 
alternatives 
5, 
6, 
7 
and 
8, 
it 
is 
represented 
by 
shading 
such 
sectors, 
thus 
leaving 
virgin 
the 
sectors 
1, 
2, 
3 
and 
4. 


The 
criteria 
ruling 
the 
assignation 
of 
a 
measure 
to 
the 
various 
alternatives 
of 
a 
possibility 
space 
will 
be 
studied 
in 
due 
course; 
here 
I 
only 
introduce 
the 
notion, 
emphasizing 
its 
intrinsically 
relational 
character. 
In 
fact 
the 
above 
example 
shows 
that 
the 
measure 
of 
(6.iii) 
depends 
also 
on 
k° 
(that 
is, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
mini-roulette, 
also 
on 
the 
sizes 
of 
its 
eight 
boxes). 
I 
advance 
that 
uniform 
partitions 
will 
be 
privileged; 
yet 
I 
underline 
that 
this 
agreement 
is 
not 
an 
artful 
way 
for 
intruding 
a 
sort 
of 
equiprobability; 
it 
is 
only 
a 
way 
for 
avoiding 
mathematic 
and 
geometric 
complications 
of 
no 
theoretical 
moment 
(a 
uniform 
partition 
is 
anyhow 
a 
partition). 


6.4.1. 
Precisely 
as 
(6.ii) 
symbolizes 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
h 
under 
the 
statute 
k°, 
(iv) 
mk°&h1(h2& 
h3) 


symbolizes 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
h2&h3 
under 
the 
statute 
k°&h1 
that 
is 
under 
the 


statute 
increased 
by 
adding 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
h1 
to 
k°. 
For 
instance, 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
k° 


of 
our 
mini-roulette, 
once 
hi 
precludes 
the 
even 
numbers, 
h2 
is 
~1 
and 
h2 
is 
<5, 
(6.iv) 
is 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
outcome 
3. 


6.4.2. 
Obviously 
an 
actual 
measure 
corresponds 
to 
(6.ii) 
only 
on 
condition 
(sufficiency 
condition) 
that 
k° 
configure 
an 
actual 
possibility 
space. 
In 
other 
words 
we 
can 
say 
that 
an 
expression 

like 
(6.ii) 
succeeds 
in 
defining 
an 
actual 
measure 
only 
if 
the 
sufficiency 
condition 
is 
satisfied. 
This 
condition 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
intensional 
counter-part 
of 
the 
presupposition 
upon 
which 
the 
set-
theoretic 
approach 
to 
probability 
is 
based; 
in 
fact 
(Hayek 
2003 
§1, 
Howson 
and 
Urbach 
2006 
§2.a}) 


such 
an 
approach 
presupposes 
a 
space 
of 
possibilities 
W 
(also: 
a 
universal 
set, 
a 
class 
of 
elementary 


events) 
and 
refers 
the 
probability 
of 
an 
event 
to 
the 
members 
of 
F, 
where 
F 
is 
the 
field 
of 
W-subsets. 


6.4.2.1. 
If 
the 
measure 
of 
an 
h 
is 
actually 
defined 
with 
regards 
to 
a 
basic 
statute 
k°, 
then 
it 
is 
also 
defined 
with 
regards 
to 
a 
statute 
k=k°&h1; 
in 
fact 
if 
the 
information 
k° 
satisfies 
the 
sufficiency 
condition 
for 
h, 
the 
information 
obtained 
by 
adding 
h1 
to 
the 
previous 
one 
configures 
either 
the 
same 
possibility 
space 
(h1= 
Ø) 
or 
a 
more 
punctual 
possibility 
space 
(that 
is 
a 
possibility 
space 
whose 
alternatives 
are 
a 
subset 
of 
the 
previous 
and 
less 
punctual 
one). 
Therefore 
while 
any 
increment 
of 
the 
basic 
statute 
does 
avoid 
the 
risk 
of 
losing 
sufficiency, 
a 
decrement 
does 
not. 


For 
instance, 
the 
possibility 
of 
assigning 
a 
measure 
to 
the 
outcome 
5 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
k° 
of 
our 
mini-roulette 
entails 
the 
possibility 
of 
assigning 
a 
measure 
to 
the 
same 
outcome 
5 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
aforementioned 
statute 
k°&h1 
telling 
us, 
say, 
that 
even 
outcomes 
are 
precluded, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
entail 
the 
same 
possibility 
if 
we 
forget 
the 
exact 
numbers 
of 
outcomes 
in 
such 
a 
mini-roulette. 


6.4.3. 
Normally, 
increasing 
a 
quantity 
is 
increasing 
its 
measure. 
Therefore, 
since 
here 
we 
are 
dealing 
with 
pieces 
of 
information 
and 
the 
quantity 
of 
information 
h1&h2 
is 
equal 
(h2= 
Ø) 
or 
greater 
than 
h1, 
we 
might 
be 
induced 
to 
think 
that 
mk(h1&h2) 
is 
equal 
or 
greater 
than 
mk(h1). 
On 
the 
contrary 
we 
shall 
see 
even 
formally 
that 
mk(h1&h2) 
is 
equal 
(h2= 
Ø) 
or 
less 
than 
mk(h1). 
This 
conclusion 
is 
confirmed 
by 
diagrammatical 
evidence; 
in 
fact 
the 
virgin 
field 
corresponding 
to 
mk(h1& 
h2) 
is 
equal 
or 
less 
than 
the 
virgin 
field 
corresponding 
to 
mk(h1). 
Let 
me 
insist: 
m 
measures 
the 
residual 
uncertainty. 
In 
this 
sense 
calling 
m 
“measure” 
is 
a 
potentially 
misleading 
choice. 
Yet 
such 
a 
choice 
is 
constrained 
by 
the 
current 
terminology; 
in 
fact 
(§7.12) 
the 
above 
defined 
notion 
(owing 
to 
the 
role 
it 
plays 
in 
the 
definition 
of 
probability) 
is 
strictly 
linked 
with 
the 
notion 
Waismann, 
Carnap 
and 
followers 
name 
“measure”. 


6.5. 
Indeed, 
once 
its 
rudiments 
have 
been 
understood, 
® 
is 
a 
rather 
intuitive 
representation. 
Nevertheless 
some 
comments 
are 
suitable 
about 
the 
representation 
of 
the 
two 
connectives 
(conjunction 
and 
negation) 
through 
which 
we 
can 
create 
new 
pieces 
of 
information. 
6.6. 
The 
conjunction 
h1&h2 
is 
represented 
by 
a 
shaded 
field 
whose 
sectors 
are 
the 
ones 
shaded 
by 
h1 
or 
by 
h2. 
Yet 
a 
fundamental 
ambiguity 
arises. 
For 
instance, 
once 
assumed 
that 
h1 
precludes 
the 
last 
four 
sectors 
and 
h2 
precludes 
the 
sectors 
1 
and 
8, 
is 
their 
conjunction 
represented 
by 
Figure 
6.3 



or 
by 
Figure 
6.4? 
In 
other 
words; 
are 
there 
many 
or 
only 
one 
degree 
of 
shading? 
My 
answer 
is 
that 
assuming 
(as 
in 
§6.1) 
the 
opposition 
between 
*known* 
and 
*unknown* 
without 
considering 
intermediate 
cognitive 
situations 
is 
assuming 
an 
idempotent 
logic 
where 
the 
reliability 
of 
any 
acquirement 
cannot 
be 
strengthened 
by 
iteration. 
Therefore 
Figure 
6.4 
is 
the 
right 
representation. 


In 
other 
words. 
Once 
we 
assume 
that 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
h 
belongs 
to 
a 
statute 
k, 
no 
assumption 


is 
possible 
according 
to 
which, 
so 
to 
say, 
h 
super-belongs 
to 
k. 


6.6.1. 
On 
these 
grounds 
implication 
is 
defined 
through 
conjunction; 
in 
fact 
(6.v) 
(h1Éh2) 
iff 
(h1& 
h2= 
h1) 


is 
immediately 
legitimated 
in 
Ò. 


Until 
(6.v) 
is 
considered 
as 
a 
strictly 
formal 
definition, 
it 
is 
a 
sovereign 
intervention 
which 
as 
such 
does 
not 
require 
any 
legitimation, 
but 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
relate 
*É* 
and 
*implication* 
the 
sovereignty 
fails. 
In 
fact 
defining 
formally 
a 
symbol 
that 
previously 
belongs 
to 
the 
current 
lexicon 
with 
a 
universally 
accepted 
meaning 
is 
a 
risky 
procedure, 
because 
it 
might 
facilitate 
argumentative 
abuses, 
that 
is 
undue 
inferences 
implicitly 
based 
on 
the 
universally 
accepted 
meaning. 
Yet, 
enucleating 
and 
emphasizing 
such 
a 
risk 
is 
already 
a 
good 
manner 
of 
keeping 
it 
under 
control. 
Moreover, 
in 
our 
case, 
no 
undue 
inferences 
are 
derivable, 
since 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
evident 
that 
in 
an 


idempotent 
logic 
if 
h1 
implies 
h2, 
then 
adding 
h2 
to 
h1 
does 
not 
enhance 
the 
same 
h1, 
and 
vice 


versa 
if 
adding 
h2 
to 
h1 
does 
not 
enhance 
h1, 
this 
means 
that 
knowing 
h1 
is 
knowing 
h2 
too, 


therefore 
that 
the 
same 
h1 
implies 
h2. 
For 
instance, 
with 
reference 
to 
our 
mini-roulette, 
if 
we 
know 
that 
only 
odd 
outcomes 
are 
possible 
(shading 
of 
the 
even 
sectors), 
to 
learn 
that 
an 
outcome 
is 
not 
4 


(shading 
of 
such 
a 
sector) 
does 
not 
increase 
what 
we 
already 
know. 
Therefore 
(6.v) 
complies 
with 
the 
usual 
meaning 
of 
“É”. 
If 
h1Éh2, 
I 
say 
that 
h1 
is 
an 
expansion 
of 
h2 
and 
h2 
is 
a 
restriction 
of 
h1. 


6.7. 
By 
|h| 



I 
mean 
the 
dilemma 
concerning 
the 
pair 
of 
opposite 
pieces 
of 
information 
h 
and 
~h 
(§2.9.1). 
A 
dilemma 
is 
k-decidable 
iff 
k 
allows 
to 
infer 
which 
of 
its 
horn 
is 
true 
and 
consequently 
which 
is 
false. 
Therefore 
the 
decidability 
can 
indifferently 
be 
referred 
to 
any 
of 
the 
two 
opposite 
hypotheses. 


6.8. 
The 
negation 
~h 
is 
represented 
by 
a 
shaded 
field 
whose 
sectors 
are 
exactly 
the 
virgin 
sectors 
of 
h. 
That 
is: 
two 
opposite 
pieces 
of 
information 
are 
represented 
by 
complementary 
shadings. 
It 
follows 
that 
incoherence 
is 
represented 
by 
a 
wholly 
shaded 
circle; 
and 
actually 
incoherence 
is 
an 
excess 
of 
information 
(precluding 
every 
k°-compatible 
alternative, 
therefore 


contradicting 
the 
basic 
previous 
assumption). 
By 


h&~h 
=^ 


and 


~ 
(h&~h)= 
Ø 


I 
introduce 
the 
abbreviative 
symbols 
“^” 
(incoherence, 
excess 
of 
information) 
and 
“Ø” 
(tautology, 
null 
information). 
Therefore 
^ 
and 
Ø 
are 
respectively 
represented 
by 
a 
totally 
shaded 
and 
by 
a 
totally 
virgin 
circle. 


6.9. 
The 
maximal 
coherent 
information 
regarding 
a 
possibility 
space 
is 
represented 
by 
shading 
all 
the 
sectors 
but 
one; 
in 
fact 
such 
a 
virgin 
sector, 
telling 
us 
exactly 
the 
actual 
alternative, 
crowns 
our 
way 
to 
a 
complete 
knowledge. 
In 
this 
sense 
I 
call 
“exhaustive” 
a 
statute 
leaving 
only 
one 
free 
alternative 
and 
“k-exhaustive” 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
h 
such 
that 
k&h 
is 
exhaustive. 
For 
instance, 
in 
its 
‘pitch-and-toss-interpretation’ 
of 
Figure 
6.1, 
if 
we 
know 
(h1) 
that 
the 
second 


outcome 
was 
B, 
to 
learn 
(h2) 
that 
no 
pair 
of 
consecutive 
tosses 
gave 
the 
same 
outcome 
is 
a 
k°&h1exhaustive 
acquirement, 
since 
it 
allows 
us 
to 
infer 
that 
the 
sequence 
is 
ABA. 
Yet 
the 
same 
acquirement 
is 
not 
k°-exhaustive, 
since 
not 
to 
know 
that 
the 
second 
outcome 
was 
B, 
admits 
also 
BAB 
as 
a 
k°-compatible 
sequence. 


6.10. 
Any 
propositional 
connective 
can 
be 
formulated 
in 
terms 
of 
conjunctions 
and 
negations; 
therefore, 
once 
we 
know 
how 
to 
represent 
conjunctions 
and 
negations, 
we 
also 
know 
how 
to 
represent 
any 
propositional 
connection. 
For 
instance, 
let 
me 
consider 
informally 
the 
inclusive 
(OR), 
the 
exclusive 
(NAND) 
and 
the 
partitive 
or 
disequivalent 
(XOR) 
disjunction 
(their 
formal 
introduction 
in 
§ 
7.10.1); 
then 
Figure 
6.5, 
Figure 
6.6 
and 
Figure 
6.7 

represent 
respectively 
the 
three 
disjunctions 
of 
(6.iii) 
and 
of 


(6.vi) 
the 
outcome 
is 
even 
with 
reference 
to 
our 
mini-roulette. 
The 
three 
figures 
have 
been 
obtained 
through 
the 
strictly 
graphic 
procedures 
dictated 
by 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
disjunction 
under 
contingent 
scrutiny, 
that 
is, 
respectively, 
-OR: 
shading 
the 
sectors 
shaded 
both 
in 
the 
representation 
of 
(6.iii) 
and 
of 
(6.vi), 
-NAND: 
shading 
the 
virgin 
sectors 
both 
in 
the 
representation 
of 
(6.iii) 
and 
of 
(6.vi), 
-XOR: 
shading 
all 
the 
sectors 
shaded 
in 
the 
two 
preceding 
figures. 


Yet 
the 
same 
figures 
can 
also 
be 
obtained 
through 
simply 
argumentative 
procedures. 
For 
instance 
(Figure 
6.5) 
the 
inclusive 
disjunction 
of 
(6.iii) 
and 
(6.vi) 
precludes 
only 
the 
eventuality 
of 
an 
odd 
and 
>4 
outcome, 
because 
such 
an 
outcome 
would 
contradict 
both 
6.iii) 
and 
(6.vi), 
therefore 
it 
would 
falsify 
the 
same 
disjunction. 
And 
so 
on. 


6.11. 
Since 
in 
next 
chapters 
these 
considerations 
will 
be 
retaken 
and 
deepened, 
I 
propose 
a 
particularly 
flexible 
example. 
A 
tract 
of 
a 
rail 
is 
partitioned 
in 
eight 
consecutive 
segments 
of 
different 
colours, 
and 
an 
automatic 
spring 
mechanism 
pulls 
a 
slider 
on 
the 
rail; 
the 
slider 
moves 
any 
time 
from 
the 
same 
starting 
point 
and 
its 
final 
position 
is 
exactly 
determined 
by 
a 
lubber 
line, 
so 
that 
the 
eight 
alternatives 
correspond 
to 
the 
eight 
segments 
where 
the 
slider 
can 
stop. 
Although 
it 
would 
be 
easy 
to 
sketch 
contexts 
where 
the 
final 
position 
depends 
on 
many 
parameters 
(variable 
friction, 
non 
horizontal 
altimetry 
et 
cetera) 
I 
assume 
that 
the 
resistances 
to 
the 
motion 
are 
the 
same 
in 
every 
point 
of 
the 
tract, 
and 
thus 
that 
the 
distance 
is 
the 
only 
parameter 
(monoparametric 
context). 
Of 
course 
the 
final 
position 
of 
the 
slider 
depends 
on 
the 
impulse 
I 
transmitted 
by 
the 
spring, 
and 
this 


impulse 
ranges 
from 
an 
Imin 
to 
an 
Imax 
according 
to 
which 
the 
slider 
stops 
respectively 
at 
the 
beginning 
or 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
tract. 
First 
of 
all 
the 
flexibility 
of 
the 
example 
allows 
to 
see 
Figure 
6.1 
and 
6.2 
as 
concerning 
simply 
two 
different 
partitions 
of 
the 
tract 
(the 
area 
of 
every 
sector 
is 
directly 
proportional 
to 
the 
length 
of 
the 



segment 
it 
represents). 
Such 
a 
flexibility 
could 
also 
allow 
the 
introduction 
of 
new 
distinctions 
based 
on 
further 
connotations. 
For 
instance 
a 
distinction 
based 
on 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
every 
segment 
of 
the 
tract 
is 
partitioned 
in 
three 
sub-segments, 
each 
of 
them 
identified 
by 
a 
nuance 
of 
the 
respective 
colour 


would 
increase 
the 
respective 
possibility 
space 
and 
could 
be 
represented 
in 
the 
intuitive 
way 
(the 
partition 
of 
each 
sector 
in 
three 
subsectors). 
Nevertheless, 
since 
an 
octo-partition 
of 
the 
circle 
is 
already 
sufficient 
to 
support 
adequate 
examples 
and 
since 
a 
non-uniform 
assignation 
would 
mean 
overcharging 
the 
exposition 
with 
arithmetical 
complications 
of 
no 
theoretical 
moment 
(let 
me 
repeat: 
uniformity 
too, 
after 
all, 
is 
an 
assignation 
of 
measures, 
and 
its 
peculiarity 
does 
not 
influence 


the 
following 
discourse), 
the 
statute 
k° 
represented 
in 
Figure 
6.1 
will 
be 
privileged. 
Of 
course 
once 
every 
sector 
is 
considered 
as 
an 
elementary 
entity, 
every 
piece 
of 
information 
referring 
to 
further 
distinctions 
is 
of 
no 
moment. 
For 
instance 


the 
slider 
stopped 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
sector 
3 


does 
not 
increase 


the 
slider 
stopped 
in 
sector 
3 


since 
under 
k° 
the 
specification 
adduced 
by 
“second 
half 
of” 
is 
meaningless 
when 
referred 
to 
a 
segment 
of 
the 
tract. 


6.12. 
The 
above 
representation 
presupposes 
the 
assignation 
of 
a 
precise 
measure 
to 
the 
various 
alternatives. 
Of 
course 
any 
partition 
where 
the 
virgin 
(free) 
field 
is 
composed 
by 
more 
than 
one 
sector 
represents 
an 
uncertainty 
(the 
certainty 
is 
represented 
by 
a 
monosectorial 
virgin 
field 
whose 
only 
sector 
represents 
exactly 
the 
actual 
alternative). 
Yet 
a 
‘meta-uncertainty’ 
may 
concern 
the 
same 
assignation 
of 
a 
measure 
to 
some 
alternative. 
If 
we 
are 
studying 
the 
three 
tosses 
sequence 
of 
a 
well 
balanced 
coin, 
Figure 
6.1 
is 
undoubtedly 
the 
right 
one; 
but 
not 
all 
contexts 
are 
analytically 
quantifiable. 
For 
instance, 
what 
about 
the 
possible 
results 
of 
a 
foot-race 
with 
eight 
competitors? 
Of 
course 
we 
can 
assign 
to 
each 
of 
them 
a 
measure 
inspired 
by 
our 
previous 
information 
on 
his 
chances, 
so 
in 
general 
obtaining 
a 
non-uniform 
diagram 
like, 
say, 
Figure 
6.2. 
This 
notwithstanding 
any 
single 
assignation 
might 
suffer 
a 
margin 
of 
ambiguity 
(different 
bookmakers 
might 
propose 
different 
rates). 
A 
situation 
like 
this 
could 
be 
represented 
by 
fuzzy 
sectors, 
that 
is 
by 
replacing 
the 
various 
radii 
which 
separate 
the 
various 
sectors 
with 
sub-sectors 
more 
or 
less 
narrow 
according 
to 
the 
margin 
of 
ambiguity 
in 
the 
assignation 
of 
the 
respective 
measure. 
Anyway 
I 
neglect 
such 
a 
topic 
because 
my 
present 
task 
is 
only 
to 
sketch 
the 
theoretical 
frame 
of 
a 
representation, 
not 
to 
enter 
into 
details 
of 
its 
possible 
refinements. 
6.13. 
Let 
k=k°&k’ 
be 
the 
statute 
concerning 
the 
possibility 
space 
under 
scrutiny. 
According 
to 
the 
above 
explained 
technique 
(henceforth 
I 
call 
it 
“by 
shading”) 
we 
shade 
the 
k’-sectors 
of 
a 
circle 


partitioned 
in 
conformity 
with 
k°. 
But, 
since 
shading 
a 
sector 
is 
precluding 
it 
(that 
is 
cancelling 
it 
from 
the 
possible 
alternatives), 
another 
technique 
(I 
call 
it 
“by 
re-partitioning”) 
is 
performable: 
drawing 
a 
new 
and 
completely 
virgin 
circle 
whose 
sectors 
are 
only 
the 
virgin 
sectors 
of 
the 
previous 
one. 
For 
instance, 
once 
translated 
into 
the 
re-partitioning 
technique, 
the 
situation 
represented 
in 
Figure 
6.7 
leads 
to 
a 
uniformly 
tetrapartitioned 
circle 
(uniformly 
because 
the 
four 
virgin 
sectors 
of 



Figure 
6.7 
have 
the 
same 
area 
and 
the 
areal 
ratios 
of 
the 
virgin 
sectors, 
obviously, 
must 
be 
conserved). 


The 
re-partitioning 
technique, 
follows 
from 
interpreting 
the 
shadings 
of 
this 
technique 
as 
a 
radical 
elimination 
of 
the 
respective 
alternatives 
from 
the 
possibility 
space 
(so 
entailing 
a 
redistribution 
of 
the 
resulting 
vigin 
field). 
Yet 
the 
most 
general 
approach 
concerns 
acquirements 
that, 
far 
from 
forbidding 
the 
radical 
elimination 
of 
an 
alternative, 
increase 
or 
decrease 
its 
respective 
assignation 
(that 
is 
the 
area 
of 
the 
sector 
representing 
such 
an 
alternative). 
This 
topic 
will 
be 
faced 
in 
§6.2 
of 
Chapter 
13. 


6.14. 
The 
incidental 
note 
of 
§6.3.1.1 
deserves 
a 
last 
remark. 
I 
only 
know 
that 
A 
and 
B 
are 
among 
the 
(how 
many?) 
competitors 
of 
a 
foot 
race, 
and 
that 
their 
chances 
are 
the 
same. 
This 
situation, 
which 
cannot 
be 
represented 
through 
a 
circle 
because 
of 
its 
fixed 
area, 
can 
be 
represented 
through 
an 
open 
rectangle 
(where 
two 
equal 
sub-rectangles 
are 
part 
of 
a 
rectangle 
whose 
total 
area 
is 
unknown). 



CHAPTER 
7 


AXIOMS 


7.1. 
Here 
I 
formalize 
the 
informational 
approach 
through 
a 
propaedeutic 
system 
of 
logical 
axioms. 
The 
reasons 
why 
I 
speak 
of 
a 
propaedeutic 
system 
will 
be 
explained 
in 
§8.5. 
Obviously 
the 
variables 
“h”, 
“h1” 
et 
cetera 
range 
over 
pieces 
of 
information. 
The 
axioms 
are 


AX1 
IDENTITY 
if 
h 
then 
h 
AX2 
REPLACEMENT 
if 
h1 
and 
if 
h1= 
h2 
then 
h2 
AX3 
ASSOCIABILITY 
if 
h1, 
and 
if 
h2 
then 
h1& 
h2 
AX4 
COMMUTABILITY 
if 
h1& 
h2, 
then 
h2& 
h1 
AX5 
RESTRICTION 
if 
h1&h2, 
then 
h1 
AX6 
COHERENCE 
if 
h1&~h1, 
then 
h2 
AX7 
COMPLEMENTARINESS 
if 
h1&h2= 
h1&~h1 
then 
h1&~h2= 
h1 


and 
could 
be 
re-proposed 
in 
the 
well 
known 
fractional 
notation 
where 
for 
instance 
AX2 
becomes 


h1 
h1=h2 
h2 


et 
cetera. 
I 
preferred 
“if 
then” 
only 
for 
minute 
typographical 
convenience. 


7.1.1. 
The 
above 
axioms 
draw 
an 
idempotent 
logic 
(§1.3). 
In 
fact 
Theor1. 
If 
h, 
then 
h&h 
and 
if 
h&h, 
then 
h. 


Proof, 
By 
AX1 
and 
AX3, 
if 
h 
then 
h&h; 
by 
AX5, 
if 
h&h, 
then 
h. 
Obviously 
the 
theorem 
of 
idempotence 
concerns 
pieces 
of 
information. 
For 
instance 
it 
states 
that, 
if 
we 
know 
that 
2<3, 
we 
can 
infer 
that 
2<3 
and 
2<3; 
therefore, 
since 
reciprocally 
(AX5) 
if 
we 
know 
that 
2<3 
and 
2<3, 
we 
can 
infer 
that 
2<3, 
to 
know 
that 
2<3 
and 
2<3 
is 
nothing 
more 
and 
nothing 
less 
than 
to 
know 
that 
2<3 
(Theor4 
below). 


7.2. 
Some 
comments 
are 
opportune 
in 
order 
to 
show 
that 
the 
usual 
interpretation 
of 
symbols 
satisfies 
the 
admissibility 
criterion. 
7.2.1. 
AX1 
is 
obvious: 
any 
piece 
of 
information 
can 
be 
inferred 
from 
its 
assumption. 

7.2.2. 
AX2 
rules 
the 
substitution 
of 
identity. 
Indeed 
“substitution 
of 
identity” 
is 
a 
patent 
oxymoron, 
because 
in 
the 
meaning 
of 
“substitution” 
there 
is 
a 
component 
of 
diversity 
quite 
incompatible 
with 
the 
very 
meaning 
of 
“identity” 
(scholasticism 
taught: 
si 
duo 
idem 
faciunt, 
non 
est 
idem); 
this 
notwithstanding 
I 
respect 
the 
current 
terminology. 
Anyhow 
the 
topic 
will 
be 
better 
analyzed 
in 
Chapter 
8. 


7.2.2.1. 
Besides 
the 
substitution 
of 
identity, 
current 
theorizations 
list 
Modus 
Ponens 
as 
a 
further 
inference 
rule. 
Here, 
by 
the 
definition 
(6.vi), 
it 
is 
a 
theorem. 
In 
fact 
Theor2. 
If 
h1 
and 
if 
h1 
= 
h1& 
h2, 
then 
h2. 


Proof. 
By 
AX2 
we 
get 
h1&h2, 
then, 
by 
AX5, 
h2. 
Of 
course 
if 
“h1 
” 
and 
“h2 
” 
were 
variables 
over 
sentences, 


h1= 
h1& 
h2 
would 
be 
an 
absurdity. 


7.2.3. 
The 
admissibility 
of 
AX3 
follows 
immediately 
from 
the 
same 
meaning 
of 
“and”, 
that 
is 
from 
the 
same 
*conjunction* 
(when 
referred 
to 
pieces 
of 
information). 
The 
repetition 
of 
“if” 
says 
just 
that 
the 
two 
acquirements 
are 
singularly 
considered. 
7.2.4. 
At 
first 
sight 
a 
superficial 
objection 
might 
suggest 
some 
perplexity 
about 
the 
admissibility 
of 
AX4, 
that 
is 
about 
the 
commutative 
property 
of 
conjunction. 
For 
instance 
(7.i) 
Ava 
took 
a 
lover 
and 
Ava’s 
husband 
abandoned 
her 
and 


(7.ii) 
Ava’s 
husband 
abandoned 
her 
and 
Ava 
took 
a 
lover 
are 
obtained 
by 
commutating 
the 
same 
two 
atomic 
statements, 
yet 
(7.i) 
and 
(7.ii) 
adduce 
two 
different 
pieces 
of 
information, 
otherwise 
it 
would 
be 
unexplainable 
why 
the 
respective 
lawyers 
are 
quarrelling 
about 
(7.i) 
and 
(7.ii). 
The 
reply 
is 
immediate: 
(7.i) 
and 
(7.ii) 
are 
elliptic 
formulations 
suggesting 
that 
the 
consequentiality 
of 
the 
facts 
corresponds 
to 
the 
consequentiality 
of 
the 
atomic 
statements. 
Indeed, 
making 
(7.i) 
explicit 
leads 
to 


(7.iii) 
Ava 
took 
a 
lover 
at 
t1 
and 
Ava’s 
husband 
abandoned 
her 
at 
t2 
exactly 
as 
making 
(7.ii) 
explicit 
leads 
to 


(7.iv) 
Ava’s 
husband 
abandoned 
her 
at 
t2 
and 
Ava 
took 
a 
lover 
at 
t3 

therefore 
the 
example, 
far 
from 
confuting 
AX4, 
corroborates 
it 
(both 
(7.iii) 
and 
(7.iv) 
are 
perfectly 
commutative). 


7.2.5. 
While 
AX2, 
AX3 
and 
AX4 
do 
satisfy 
the 
admissibility 
criterion 
also 
under 
the 
dual 
interpretation 
which 
reads 
“&” 
as 
a 
symbol 
of 
inclusive 
disjunction, 
AX5 
does 
not, 
so 
rejecting 
this 
dual 
interpretation. 
On 
the 
contrary 
AX5 
legitimates 
in 
the 
most 
obvious 
way 
the 
usual 
interpretation 
of 
“&”: 
in 
fact 
while 
a 
conjunction 
increases 
the 
information 
adduced 
by 
each 
conjunct, 
the 
inclusive 
disjunction 
decreases 
the 
information 
adduced 
by 
each 
disjunct. 
7.2.6. 
AX6 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
formalization 
of 
the 
classical 
Ex 
absurdo 
quodlibet. 
In 
other 
words 
it 
states 
that 
the 
conjunction 
of 
two 
opposite 
pieces 
of 
information 
precludes 
every 
possible 
alternative. 
7.2.7. 
AX7 
states 
that 
two 
opposite 
pieces 
of 
information 
do 
not 
intersect. 
Therefore 
AX6 
and 
AX7 
in 
conjunction 
define 
exactly 
the 
complementary 
import 
of 
*~* 
which 
finds 
in 
Ò 
its 
immediate 
visualization: 
the 
shaded 
fields 
of 
two 
opposite 
pieces 
of 
information 
do 
not 
leave 
any 
virgin 
sector 
and 
do 
not 
overlap. 


7.3. 
I 
recall 
the 
definition 
(7.v) 
(h1Éh2)=(h1& 
h2= 
h1) 


(§6.6.1); 
I 
also 
recall 
that 
under 
(7.v) 
h1 
is 
an 
expansion 
of 
h2 
and 
h2 
is 
a 
restriction 
of 
h1. 


7.4. 
Here 
I 
list 
some 
theorems 
involving 
only 
conjunctions, 
that 
is 
only 
AX1, 
AX2, 
AX3, 
AX4 
and 
AX5. 
Theor3 
h1&h2 
É 
h1 


Proof. 
By 
AX4 
h1&h2 
& 
h1= 
h1& 
h1&h2 


By 
Theor1 
h1&h1& 
h2= 
h1&h2 


By 
(7.v) 
h1&h2 
É 
h1 


7.4.1. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
concision 
proofs 
are 
omitted. 
Theor4 
If 
h1É 
h2 
and 
h2É 
h1, 
then 
h1= 
h2 


7.4.1.1. 
Since 
(Theor1) 
if 
h, 
then 
h&h 
and 
if 
h&h, 
then 
h, 
it 
follows 
from 
Theor4 
Corollary 
4 
h&h 
= 
h 


that 
is 
the 
identity 
between 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
and, 
so 
to 
say, 
its 
iteration. 
Yet 
we 
must 
avoid 
interpreting 
such 
a 
conclusion 
in 
an 
abusive 
way. 
A 
little 
example. 
Bob 
looks 
at 
the 
outcome 
of 
this 
die, 
and 
sees 
a 
six; 
yet 
he 
is 
astigmatic, 
and 
as 
such 
a 
little 
doubt 
remains: 
a 
six 
or 
a 
four? 
He 
puts 
on 



his 
spectacles 
and 
verifies: 
surely 
a 
six. 
In 
this 
sense 
someone 
could 
object 
that, 
since 
the 
‘spectaclesassisted’ 
acquirement 
strengthens 
the 
first 
one, 
Corollary 
4 
is 
violated. 
No 
violation 
indeed, 
since 
the 
little 
doubt 
concerning 
Bob’s 
first 
acquirement 
forbids 
its 
acceptation 
as 
an 
acquirement. 
When 
we 
accept 
a 
piece 
of 
information, 
we 
assume 
it 
as 
an 
unobjectionable 
datum 


which 
no 
further 
acquirement 
can 
strengthen. 
That 
is: 
here 
we 
are 
theorizing 
an 
idempotent 
logic 
where 
no 
intermediate 
degree 
of 
knowledge 
is 
admitted 
between 
*known* 
and 
*unknown*. 


7.4.2. 
Some 
other 
theorems 
involving 
only 
conjunctions. 
Theor5 
If 
h1= 
h2, 
then 
h1É 
h2 
and 
h2É 
h1 


Theor6 
If 
h1É 
h2 
and 
h2É 
h3, 
then 
h1É 
h3 
(Transitivity) 


Theor7 
If 
h1É 
h2 
and 
h1É 
h3, 
then 
h1É(h2&h3) 


Theor8 
If 
h1&h2= 
h3, 
then 
h3&h1= 
h3 


7.4-3. 
While 
an 
implication 
where 


(h1É 
h2) 
& 
~( 
h2É 
h1) 


is 
called 
“simple 
implication”, 
an 
implication 
where 


(h1É 
h2) 
& 
(h2É 
h1) 


is 
called 
“reciprocal 
implication”. 
Then 
Theor4 
and 
Theor5 
say 
that 
identity 
is 
nothing 
but 
a 
reciprocal 
implication. 
Though 
identity 
is 
a 
relation 
linking 
every 
category 
of 
referents, 
Theor4 
and 
Theor5 
are 
not 
so 
ambitious 
as 
to 
state 
that 
any 
identity 
can 
always 
be 
interpreted 
as 
a 
reciprocal 
implication. 
Since 
such 
theorems 
concern 
pieces 
of 
information, 
they 
simply 
state 
that, 
when 
we 
are 
dealing 
with 
pieces 
of 
information, 
identity 
can 
be 
conceived 
as 
a 
reciprocal 
implication 
and 
vice 
versa.

7.6. 
The 
theorems 
of 
the 
propositional 
calculus 
can 
be 
easily 
proved. 
For 
instance 
(Kleene 
1974, 
§23) 
Implication 
(introduction): 
((h1&h2)É 
h3) 
É 
(h1É(~ 
(h2&~h3)) 
Modus 
tollendo 
ponens. 
(~ 
(~h1&~h2)& 
~h1)É 
h2. 
and 
so 
on. 


7.6.1. 
The 
reductio 
ad 
absurdum 
is 
nothing 
but 
a 
technique 
derivable 
from 
the 
axioms. 
In 
fact, 
given 
a 
statute 
k, 
if 
h 
is 
such 
that 
k&h=^, 
by 
Theor11 
k&~h=k, 
therefore 
~h 
is 
implied 
by 
the 
statute. 
7.7. 
The 
definition 
(7.vi) 
(h1-h2 
= 
h3)=(h1=h2 
& 
h3) 
introduces 
the 
symbol 
“-“ 
for 
the 
operation 
I 
call 
“ablation”. 


The 
second 
member 
of 
(7.vi) 
tells 
us 
that 
an 
ablation 
is 
defined 
only 
where 
the 
minuend 
h1 
implies 
the 
subtrahend 
h2: 
in 
fact 
if 
h1=h2 
& 
h3, 
since 
h2 
& 
h3=h2 
& 
h2& 
h3, 
then 
h1&h2 
= 
h1. 
And 
actually 
we 
cannot 
cancel 
from 
a 
statute 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
which 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
statute. 


7.7.1. 
In 
spite 
of 
the 
manifest 
similarities 
connecting 
*sum* 
with 
*conjunction* 
and 
*subtraction* 
with 
*ablation*, 
while 
in 
mathematics 
(n1-n2)=(n1+(-n2) 
and 
therefore 
a 
subtraction 
can 
be 
conceived 
as 
the 
sum 
of 
a 
negative 
quantity, 
in 
the 
informational 
logic, 
evidently, 
(h1-h2)= 
(h1&(~h2)) 
does 
not 
hold, 
since 
cancelling 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
is 
far 
from 
stating 
its 
opposite 
(forgetting 
that 
Bob 
loves 
Ava 
is 
far 
from 
believing 
that 
Bob 
does 
not 
love 
Ava). 
Therefore 
the 
ablation 
cannot 
be 
conceived 
as 
the 
conjunction 
of 
a 
negative 
piece 
of 
information. 
In 
our 
minute 
practice 
ablations 
are 
mainly 
involved 
in 
situations 
where 
an 
absolutely 
trustworthy 
new 
acquirement 
incompatible 
with 
our 
previous 
statute 
constrains 
us 
to 
correct 
the 
same 
statute, 
therefore 
to 
reject 
(to 
ablate) 
some 
previously 
accepted 
pieces 
of 
information. 
This 
topic 
will 
be 
deepened 
in 
due 
course. 
Here 
I 
only 
emphasize 
that 
conjoining 
pieces 
of 
information 
continues 
being 
an 
increasing 
operation 
(Theor3). 



7.8. 
The 
three 
axioms 
for 
m 
(§6.4) 
are 
AX8 
POSITIVITY 


If 
(~ 
(k&h 
=^)) 
then 
(mk(h)>0) 
AX9 
OPPOSITION 


mk(h) 
+ 
mk(~h) 
= 
mk(k) 


AX10 
CONDIZIONALIZATION 


mk(h1& 
h2) 
= 
mk&h1(h2) 


(AX10 
is 
so 
called 
for 
it 
is 
the 
father 
of 
the 
Principle 
of 
Condizionalization). 


Since 
a 
measure 
is 
a 
number, 
the 
relations 
among 
measures 
are 
relations 
among 
numbers. 
This 
entails 
the 
presence 
of 
mathematical 
symbols 
such 
as 
“>”, 
“0”, 
“+”, 
and 
also 
of 
other 
commonplace 
ones 
such 
as 
“/” 
for 
the 
division 
et 
cetera. 
As 
far 
as 
I 
know, 
the 
theories 
of 
probability 
omit 
the 
axiomatization 
of 
mathematics, 
and 
I 
follow 
this 
procedure. 


7.8.1. 
The 
symbol 
“-“ 
occurring 
below 
does 
not 
mean 
ablation; 
it 
does 
mean 
subtraction. 
This 
notwithstanding 
such 
a 
symbol 
is 
not 
a 
homonymy 
bearer 
because 
the 
context 
overcomes 
any 
ambiguity 
(where 
“-” 
connects 
numbers, 
it 
expresses 
subtraction, 
where 
“-“ 
connects 
pieces 
of 
information, 
it 
expresses 
ablation). 
7.8.2. 
Since 
mk(h) 
is 
represented 
in 
Ò 
by 
the 
k&h-virgin 
field, 
the 
admissibility 
of 
the 
three 
axioms 
for 
m 
is 
diagrammatically 
immediate. 
For 
instance 
AX8 
states 
that 
if 
the 
k&h-shaded 
field 
is 
not 
the 
whole 
circle, 
the 
respective 
virgin 
field 
is 
not 
null. 
Anyhow 
the 
diagrammatic 
interpretation 
of 
some 
theorems 
is 
proposed 
below. 


7.9. 
Contrary 
to 
the 
already 
listed 
theorems, 
indicated 
by 
“Theor”, 
the 
m-theorems 
(that 
is 
the 
theorems 
depending 
also 
on 
the 
non-logical 
axioms 
AX8, 
AX9 
and 
AX10 
will 
be 
indicated 
by 
“THEOR” 
in 
order 
to 
facilitate 
immediate 
references. 
The 
formal 
discriminating 
factor 
between 
Theors 
and 
THEORS, 
obviously, 
is 
the 
absence 
or 
presence 
of 
“m”. 
THEOR1 
mk(k&h) 
= 
mk(h) 
= 
mk&h(k&h)= 
mk&h(h) 


Of 
course 
a 
derivation 
like 


mk(h)=mk&h(h)=mk&h(k&h)= 
mh(k&h)= 
mh(k) 


is 
illegitimate 
because 
presupposing 
that 
the 
sufficiency 
condition 
(§6.4.2) 
is 
satisfied 
by 
mk(h) 
does 


not 
imply 
that 
such 
a 
condition 
is 
satisfied 
by 
mh(k) 
too 
(and 
actually, 
in 
general, 
it 
is 
not). 


THEOR2 
mk(~k) 
= 
0. 


THEOR3 
mk&h1(h2)= 
mk&h2(h1). 



THEOR4 


mk(h1&h2) 
+ 
mk(h1&~h2) 
= 
mk(h1). 


Equivalent 
formulation: 
THEOR4’ 


mk(h1&h2) 
= 
mk(h1) 
-mk&h1(~h2) 
THEOR4 
shows 
that, 
given 
a 
k, 
increasing 
a 
hypothesis 
decreases 
its 
k-measure. 


THEOR5 
mk(h&~h) 
= 
0 
Equivalent 
formulations: 
THEOR5’ 
mk(^)=0 


THEOR5” 
mk&h(~h) 
= 
0. 
Diagrammatic 
interpretation. 
Since 
the 
representation 
of 
two 
opposite 
pieces 
of 
information 
shades 
the 
whole 
circle, 
its 
virgin 
field, 
quite 
independently 
of 
the 
statute, 
is 
null. 


THEOR6 
mk(Ø)=mk(k). 
Equivalent 
formulation. 
THEOR5’: 
mk(^)=0. 


THEOR7 
If 
(mk(h)=0) 
then 
(k&h=^). 


THEOR8 
If 
(k&h=^) 
then 
(mk(h)=0). 


Until 
now 
k=^ 
has 
only 
been 
a 
particular 
case, 
since 
THEOR8 
shows 
that 
an 
incoherent 
statute 
entails 
a 
null 
measure 
for 
any 
hypothesis. 
In 
§7.13 
this 
point 
will 
be 
deepened. 


THEOR9 
If 
(kÉh) 
then 
(mk(h)=mk(k)). 


Diagrammatic 
interpretation: 
if 
the 
shaded

of 
k 
includes 
the 
whole 
shaded 
field 
of 
h, 
the 
virgin 


field 
of 
k&h 
is 
the 
virgin 
field 
of 
k 


THEOR10 
0

mk(h)

mk(k). 


Diagrammatic 
interpretation: 
the 
k&h-virgin

cannot 
be 
greater 
than 
the 
k–virgin 
field. 


THEOR11 
mk(h1&h2) 
£ 
mk(h2). 


THEOR12 
If 
mk(h1&h2)= 
mk(h1) 
then 
mk(k&~ 
(h1&~h2)) 
= 
mk(k). 


THEOR12 
is 
the 
m–correspondent 
of 
the 
Deduction 
Theorem. 



THEOR13 
If

then 
(kÉ

Diagrammatic 
interpretation. 
If 
the 
representation 
of 
h 
shades 
some 
k-virgin 
sector, 
the 
k&h-virgin 


field 
is 
less 
than 
the 
k-virgin 
one. 


7.10. 
The 
argument 
proposed 
in 
§6.10 
can 
be 
re-proposed 
here. 
Since 
(AX9) 
(7.vii) 
mk(~h) 
= 
mk(k) 
-mk(h) 
and 
(THEOR4’) 
(7.viii) 
mk(h1&h2) 
= 
mk(h1) 
-mk&h1(~h2) 
give 
us 
the 
measures 
of 
negations 
and 
conjunctions, 
and 
since 
any 
propositional 
connective 
can 
be 
formulated 
in 
terms 
of 
negations 
and 
conjunctions, 
we 
can 
derive 
from 
(7.vii) 
and 
(7.viii) 
the 
measure 
of 
any 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
a 
proper 
formula 
of 
the 
propositional 
calculus. 
Let 
me 
enter 
into 
some 
(useful) 
detail. 


7.10.1. 
The 
three 
disjunctions 
informally 
introduced 
in 
§6.10 
can 
be 
formally 
introduced 
by 
(ix) 
(h1Úh2Ú…Úhn)=(~(~h1&~h2&…&~hn)) 
for 
the 
inclusive 
disjunction 
OR, 
by 
(h1| 
h2|...| 
hn)= 


=(~(h1&h2)& 
~(h1&h3) 
& 
... 
& 
~(h1&hn)& 


& 
~(h2&h3) 
&…& 
~(h2&hn) 
& 
... 
& 
~(hn-1&hn)) 
for 
the 
exclusive 
disjunction 
NAND, 
and 
by 
(h1¯ 
h2¯…¯ 
hn)=((h1Úh2Ú...Úhn)&(h1| 
h2|...| 
hn)) 


for 
the 
partitive 
disjunction 
XOR. 
The 
last 
disjunction 
is 
called 
“partitive” 
because 
an 
n-uple 
h1.... 
hn 


constitutes 
a 
proper 
partition 
of 
the 
k-compatible 
eventualities 
iff 
the 
two 
conditions 
(k&~h1&~h2&....&~hn) 
=^ 


(stating 
that 
h1.... 
hn 
are 
inclusively 
disjoined) 
and 


(~ 
(hi= 
hj)) 
É 
(k&hi&hj=^) 


(stating 
that 
h1.... 
hn 
are 
exclusively 
disjoined) 
are 
satisfied. 
Accordingly 
“¯”could 
almost 
be 
read 
as 
a 
synthesis 
of 
“Ú” 
and 
“|”. 


7.10.2. 
As 
for 
the 
measures 
of 
the 
disjunctions 
I 
limit 
myself 
to 
the 
following 
theorems. 
THEOR15 


mk(h1Úh2) 
= 
mk(h1) 
+ 
mk(h2) 
-mk(h1&h2) 


THEOR16 


mk(h1| 
h2)= 
mk(~h1)+ 
mk&h1(~h2) 



THEOR17 
mk(h1¯ 
h2) 
= 
= 
mk(h1&~h2) 
+ 
mk(h2&~h1) 


Equivalent 
formulation: 
THEOR17’ 
mk(h1¯ 
h2) 
= 
= 
mk(h1)-mk(h1&h2)+mk(h2)-mk(h1&h2) 


THEOR18 
mk(h1¯ 
h2¯…¯ 
hn) 
= 
= 
mK(h1&~h2&...&~hn) 
+ 


+ 
mk(h2&~h1&...&~hn) 
+ 
...+ 
+ 
mk(hn&~h1&~h2&….&~hn-1) 
THEOR19 
If 
(k=(h1¯ 
h2¯…¯ 
hn)), 
then 
then 
mK(h1¯ 
h2¯…¯ 
hn) 
= 
mk(h1) 
+ 


+ 
mk(h2) 
+ 
... 
+ 
mk(hn) 
(addictiveness). 
7.10.3. 
A 
dilemma 
is 
a 
partitive 
disjunction 
between 
two 
(opposite) 
alternatives. 
Therefore, 
with 
reference 
to 
a 
dilemma 
(n=2, 
h2=~h1) 
(7.x) 
mk(h1Úh2) 
= 
mk(h1| 
h2) 
= 
= 
mk(h1¯ 
h2) 
= 
= 
mk(h1) 
+ 
mk(h2) 
= 
mk(k) 


follows 
from 
THEOR15, 
THEOR 
16 
and 
THEOR17. 
Indeed 
(7.x) 
can 
shed 
light 
upon 
some 
poor 
uses 
of 
the 
various 
disjunctions. 
An 
example: 


if 
h1Ú 
h2Ú…Ú 
hn 
and 
hi 
entails 
~hj 
for 
all 
i¹j, 
then 


is 
a 
habitual 
expression 
meaning 
what 
can 
be 
advantageously 
meant 
by 


If 
h1¯ 
h2¯…¯ 
hn, 
then 


since 
the 
condition 
that 
hi 
entails 
~hj 
for 
all 
i¹j 
is 
exactly 
the 
condition 
that 
the 
n 
inclusively 
disjoined 
pieces 
of 
information 
are 
also 
exclusively 
disjoined 
(an 
example 
in 
the 
formulation 
of 
THEOR33 
below). 


7.11. 
The 
definition 
(7.xi) 
(h1→h2) 
= 
~( 
h1&~ 
h2) 

introduces 
the 
(obviously 
non-primitive) 
symbol 
“→”, 
that 
is 
the 
symbol 
for 
the 
connections 
I 
call 
“pseudo-hypothetics” 
(pseudo-hypothetics 
will 
be 
exhaustively 
analyzed 
in 
Chapter 
14, 
specifically 
destined 
to 
conditionals). 
And 


THEOR20 
mk(h1→h2) 
= 
mk(~h1)+ 
mk(h1& 
h2) 
(whose 
proof 
follows 
plainly 
from 
(7.xi)) 
gives 
us 
the 
measure 
of 
pseudo-hypothetics. 


7.12. 
In 
§6.3.3 
I 
affirmed 
that 
m 
is 
strictly 
linked 
to 
the 
notion 
Waismann, 
Carnap 
and 
followers 
call 
“measure”. 
In 
fact 
by 
(7.xii) 
P(h|k) 
= 
mk(h)/ 
mk(k) 
I 
define 
the 
probability 
of 
h 
given 
k. 
The 
main 
difference 
is 
that, 
contrary 
to 
them, 
conceiving 
the 


measure 
as 
an 
absolute 
or 
unconditional 
quantity, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
is 
an 
unsustainable 
thesis 
(§15.1.2). 
Of 
course 
the 
real 
number 
that 
m 
assigns 
to 
a 
h 
as 
to 
a 
k° 
depends 
also 
on 
the 
unity 
we 
choose 
for 
m 
; 
I 
will 
deal 
with 
this 
marginal 
aspect 
in 
§7.15. 


7.13. 
On 
the 
grounds 
of 
(7.xii) 
~(k=^) 
becomes 
a 
strict 
condition 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
mk(k)=0, 
that 
is 
a 
null 
denominator. 
Informally 
I 
remark 
that 
actually 
the 
same 
notion 
of 
probability 
would 
be 
senseless 
when 
referred 
to 
an 
incoherent 
statute. 
Although 
the 
main 
stream 
of 
the 
contemporary 
orthodoxy 
starts 
from 
a 
monadic 
(absolute, 
unconditional) 
probability 
and 
(either 
by 
a 
definition 
or 
by 
an 
axiom) 
introduces 
the 
dyadic 
(relative, 
conditional) 
probability 
as 
a 
ratio 
between 
two 
monadic 
ones, 
in 
my 
opinion 
no 
monadic 
probability 
can 
exist, 
since 
the 
probability 
of 
a 
hypothesis 
depends 
intrinsically 
on 
the 
statute 
the 
same 
hypothesis 
is 
referred 
to. 
And 
the 
same 
(7.xii) 
makes 
evident 
such 
a 
claim. 
Yet 
I 
am 
far 
from 
criticizing 
the 
distinction 
between 
prior 
and 
posterior 
probabilities. 
Such 
a 
distinction 
is 
a 
correct 
and 
essential 
achievement 
focusing 
on 
the 
variations 
determined 
upon 
the 
respective 
probabilistic 
values 
by 
increments 
of 
information. 
I 
am 
claiming 
that 
the 
same 
notion 
of 
an 
absolute 
probability 
is 
even 
more 
insensate 
than 
the 
already 
criticized 
notion 
of 
an 
absolute 
measure, 
because 
P 


would 
result 
dyadic 
even 
if 
m 
were 
monadic. 
The 
trap, 
generally 
speaking, 
is 
that 
while 
an 
‘unconditional’ 
probability 
deals 
with 
only 
one 
statute 
(the 
prior), 
a 
‘conditional’ 
probability 
deals 
with 
two 
(the 
prior 
and 
the 
posterior); 
nevertheless 
this 
evident 
difference 
must 
be 
not 
mistaken 
for 
an 
untenable 
difference 
of 
valences. 
In 
both 
cases 
the 
function 
concerns 
two 
variables 
(hypothesis 
and 
statute), 
and 
only 
in 
the 
latter 
must 
two 
different 
values 
of 
the 
second 
variable 
be 
accounted 
for. 
Thus 
a 


sound 
formalization 
must 
always 
deal 
with 
a 
dyadic 
function 
P(h|k) 
and 
recognize 
that 
there 
are 
probability 
problems 
concerning 
single 
values 
of 
such 
a 
function, 
and 
probability 
problems 
concerning 
the 
two 
values 
corresponding 
to 
the 
prior 
and 
to 
the 
posterior 
statute 
(prior 
and 
posterior 
as 
for 
the 
increment 
of 
information, 
obviously). 
Symbolically: 
there 
are 
probability 
problems 
concerning 


(7.xiii) 
P(h|k°) 
and 
probability 
problems 
concerning 
the 
relation 
between 
P(h|k°&k’) 


and 
(7.xiii). 


7.13.1. 
Moreover, 
a 
purely 
dimensional 
consideration 
suggests 
that 
to 
define 
the 
conditional 
probability 
as 
a 
ratio 
between 
two 
absolute 
probabilities 
is 
a 
rather 
arrogant 
procedure. 
Its 
arrogance 
does 
not 
regard 
the 
legitimacy 
of 
defining 
the 
values 
of 
a 
dyadic 
function 
as 
a 
ratio 
between 
the 
values 
of 
two 

monadic 
functions; 
it 
does 
regard 
the 
legitimacy 
of 
identifying 
the 
thus 
defined 
dyadic 
function 
with 
the 
definiens 
one. 
I 
intend 
that 
while 
a 
definition 
like 


B(x,y) 
= 
A(x)/A(y) 


is 
a 
formally 
unexceptionable 
procedure, 
a 
definition 
like 


A(x,y) 
= 
A(x)/A(y) 
is 
at 
the 
very 
least 
an 
insidious 
one. 
A 
minute 
example. 
If 
A(x) 
is 
a 
monadic 
function 
assigning 
to 


every 
person 
x 
his/her 
wealth 
(computed, 
say, 
in 
US-dollars), 
the 
ratio 
A(x)/A(y) 
defines 
a 
new 
dyadic 


function 
whose 
values 
are 
no 
longer 
US-dollars, 
but 
pure 
numbers 
(for 
instance: 
since 
x 
is 
three 
times 


richer 
than 
y, 
the 
ratio 
between 
the 
wealth 
of 
x 
and 
the 
wealth 
of 
y 
is 
3); 
therefore 
it 
would 
not 
be 
correct 
to 
use 
the 
same 
“A” 
to 
indicate 
this 
new 
function 
too. 
Of 
course 
the 
values 
of 
both 
conditional 
and 
unconditional 
probabilities 
are 
pure 
numbers, 
but 
this 
particularity 
might 
be 
only 
the 
mask 
of 
a 
logical 
abuse: 
in 
fact 
a 
probability 
value 
and 
a 
ratio 
between 
two 
probability 
values 
continue 
being 
two 
heterogeneous 
entities, 
and 
this 
heterogeneity 
cannot 
at 
all 
mirror 
the 
real 
situation, 
as 
“probability” 
keeps 
a 
common 
meaning 
both 
in 
its 
‘unconditional’ 
and 
in 
its 
‘conditional’ 
applications. 


7.13.2. 
Perhaps 
someone 
might 
be 
tempted 
to 
object 
that 
the 
notion 
of 
monadic 
probability 
is 
not 
at 
all 
insensate 
since, 
for 
instance, 
when 
we 
roll 
a 
just 
purchased 
die, 
1/6 
is 
the 
absolute 
value 
of 
each 
outcome. 
The 
reply 
is 
easy. 
This 
value 
is 
not 
absolute, 
it 
actually 
depends 
on 
the 
cognitive 
endowment 
implicitly 
transmitted 
by 
“(purchased) 
die”, 
since 
statistical 
elements 
suggest 
us 
to 
interpret 
the 
word 
as 
“perfectly 
balanced 
cube”. 
In 
fact, 
almost 
in 
their 
totality, 
the 
dice 
on 
sale 
are 
perfectly 
balanced 
cubes. 
But 
if 
the 
die 
has 
been 
purchased 
on 
line 
at 
www.Falsaria.com, 
renowned 
firm 
specialized 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
deceitful 
dice, 
the 
probability 
of 
the 
various 
outcomes 
can 
be 
assigned 
only 
on 
the 
ground 
of 
a 
statute 
partitioning 
the 
space 
of 
possibilities 
in 
some 
non-uniform 
way. 
So 
1/6 
is 
only 
the 
conditional 
probability 
relative 
to 
a 
statistically 
privileged 
statute. 
Dissembling 
the 
intrinsic 
relational 
nature 
of 
a 
quantity 
by 
implicit 
assumptions 
is 
an 
unsound 
yet 


frequent 
habit. 
For 
instance 
I 
am 
reading 
that 
the 
distance 
of 
Proxima 
Centauri 
is 
4.2 
light-years, 
but 
for 
sure 
my 
perfect 
understanding 
does 
not 
entail 
that 
the 
distance 
is 
a 
monadic 
notion, 
it 
simply 
means 
that 
it 
is 
a 
dyadic 
notion 
whose 
second 
term 
(our 
planet) 
is 
tacitly 
understood. 
And 
actually 
such 
elliptic 
ways 
of 
speaking 
are 
only 
fully 
legitimated 
where 
the 
context 
clearly 
privileges 
the 
second 
term. 


7.14. 
The 
above 
considerations 
show 
that 
a 
Kolmogorov-style 
axiomatization 
is 
not 
acceptable; 
in 
fact 
-it 
proposes 
the 
probability 
as 
a 
primitive 
notion 
-it 
starts 
from 
a 
monadic 
absolute 
probability 
-it 
grounds 
upon 
a 
set-theoretic 
approach 
whose 
exasperated 
extensionality 
and 
homonymy-blindness 
are 
quite 
unfit 
to 
account 
for 
our 
very 
gnosiology, 
often 
led 
by 
intensional 
processes. 
7.15. 
As 
for 
the 
unity 
of 
measure, 
(7.xiv) 
mk 
(k)=1 
is 
the 
explicit 
choice 
complying 
with 
the 
implicit 
assumptions 
of 
the 
canonical 
approaches 
to 
the 
measure 
function. 
But 
I 
am 
afraid 
that 
(7.xiv) 
also 
represents 
the 
worst 
choice: 
in 
fact, 
under 
it, 
the 
same 
number 
expresses 
both 
mk(h) 
and 
P(h|k), 
a 
coincidence 
that 
seems 
to 
me 
an 
awkward 
help 
to 
possible 
mistakes 
between 
two 
quite 
distinct 
quantities. 


Hajek 
(2003, 
§1) 
claims 
that 
the 
non-negativity 
and 
normalization 
axioms 
here 
resumed 
in 


(7.xv) 
0 
£ 
P(h|k) 
£ 
1 

are 
largely 
matter 
of 
convention. 
I 
disagree: 
what 
is 
largely 
matter 
of 
convention 
is 
the 
choice 
of 
the 
m-unit, 
but 
(7.xii) 
shows 
that 
this 
choice 
is 
irrelevant 
on 
the 
P-range, 
which 
always 
will 
respect 
(7.xv). 
In 
fact, 
while 
both 
mk(h)<0 
and 
mk(h)>mk(k) 
are 
incoherent 
values, 
both 
mk(h)=0 
and 
a 


mk(h)=mk(k) 
are 
exactly 
the 
coherent 
values 
accounting 
for 
the 
two 
border 
cases 
(of 
a 
h 
respectively 
k-incompatible 
and 
k-implied). 


7.16. 
The 
well 
known 
probability 
theorems 
are 
derivable 
by 
the 
simple 
application 
of 
(7.xii) 
to 
the 
respective 
axioms 
and 
theorems 
for 
m. 
In 
particular 
THEOR21 
P(h|k) 
+ 
P(~h|k) 
= 
1 
follows 
directly 
from 
AX9, 


THEOR22 
0£P(h|k)£1 
follows 
directly 
from 
THEOR9, 


THEOR23 
If 
h1&h2=^ 
then 
then 
P(h1Ú 
h2|k)=P(h1|k)+P(h2|k) 
follows 
directly 
from 
THEOR15. 
Finally, 
in 
order 
to 
adequate 
my 
formulae 
to 
the 
current 
ones, 
let 
me 
use 
“e” 
as 
a 
new 
variable 
ranging 
over 
‘evidences’, 
that 
is 
on 
acquirements 
increasing 
a 
basic 
statute 
k°): 


THEOR24 
P(h1|k°&e) 
= 
P(h1&e|k°) 
/ 
P(e|k°) 


These 
four 
theorems 
express 
in 
dyadic 
notation 
the 
four 
axioms 
upon 
which 
the 
usual 
theories 
are 
normally 
based 
(Howson 
and 
Urbach 
2006, 
§2a); 
thence 
the 
usual 
theorems 
could 
be 
considered 
as 
already 
proved. 
Yet 
I 
carried 
out 
the 
task 
of 
deriving 
them 
again 
not 
only 
because 
of 
the 
new 
dyadic 
notation, 
but 
also 
because 
of 
the 
formal 
compromises 
affecting 
some 
current 
proofs. 
For 
example 


AXIOM 
P(t)=1 
if 
t 
is 
a 
logical 
truth 
THEOREM 
P(^)=0 
Proof 
~^ 
is 
a 
logical 
truth, 
hence... 


(ibidem, 
§2.b, 
(6)) 
seems 
to 
me 
a 
rather 
rough 
argument. 
No 
doubt 
that 
~^ 
is 
a 
logical 
truth, 
but 
this 
means 
only 
that 
a 
theorization 
entailing 
such 
a 
conclusion 
is 
admissible. 
A 
formal 
proof 
must 
start 
from 
some 
axiomatic 
formula 
and 
must 
transform 
it 
into 
the 
theoremic 
one 
with 
only 
the 
help 
of 
the 
inference 
rule(s); 
as 
such, 
maintaining 
the 
example, 
no 
proof 
can 
appeal 
to 
the 
notion 
of 
logical 
truth 
before 
its 
formal 
definition 
within 
the 
system, 
and 
no 
expression 
can 
be 
assumed 
as 
a 
logical 
truth 
before 
its 
formal 
derivation. 


7.16.1.

theorems

a 
milestone 
along 
the 
way

it

that

CHAPTER 
8 
ALETHICS 


8.1. 
The 
formal 
treatment 
of 
alethics 
could 
proceed 
quite 
independently 
of 
any 
representation. 
Yet, 
since 
® 
helps 
both 
the 
exposition 
and 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
matter, 
I 
will 
make 
a 
large 
use 
of 
diagrams. 
Of 
course 
such 
diagrams 
can 
be 
applied 
to 
whatever 
universe 
of 
reference 
where 
the 
statute 
allows 
a 
partition 
of 
the 
possibility 
space, 
that 
is 
a 
codification 
of 
the 
alternatives. 
Yet, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
simplicity, 
I 
will 
mainly 
reason 
about 
the 
example 
sketched 
in 
§6 
of 
Chapter 
6 
(the 
slider 
on 
the 
rail). 
Then 
a 
generic 
®-diagram 
represents 
the 
basic 
statute 
k° 
(concerning 
the 
eight 
segments 
of 
the 
tract) 


by 
partitioning 
the 
circle 
in 
eight 
virgin 
sectors 
and 
the 
acquirements 
k’, 
k” 
et 
cetera 
by 
shading 
the 
sectors 
corresponding 
to 
the 
segments 
of 
the 
tract 
precluded 
by 
such 
acquirements 
(for 
the 
sake 
of 
concision, 
we 
can 
only 
consider 
a 
single 
acquirement). 
Our 
fundamental 
problem 
is 
representing 
an 
hypothesis 
and 
assigning 
an 
alethic 
value 
(a 
‘truth 
value’) 
to 
it. 
I 
emphasize 
that 
*alethic 
value* 
must 
be 
intended 
in 
its 
widest 
acceptation, 
according 
to 
which 
not 
only 
*true* 
and 
*false*, 
but 
also 
*probable*, 
*decidable* 
et 
cetera 
are 
alethic 
values. 
The 
link 


among 
such 
notions 
is 
evident. 
For 
instance 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
h 
is 
k-true 
iff 
P(h|k)=1 
and 
is 
k-

false 
iff 
P(h|k)=0. 
Therefore 
the 
intrinsically 
relational 
nature 
of 
*probable* 
is 
the 
intrinsically 
relational 
nature 
of 
*true* 
et 
cetera. 
Without 
a 
reference 
to 
a 
statute, 
all 
alethic 
predicates 
are 
senseless. 


8.1.1. 
In 
order 
not 
to 
waste 
time 
with 
analyses 
of 
too 
scarce 
an 
interest, 
incoherent 
statutes 
will 
be 
neglected 
(that 
is, 
formally: 
~(kÉh&~h) 
is 
a 
presupposed 
condition). 
I 
recall 
§2 
of 
Chapter 
6: 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
coherent 
statute 
does 
not 
imply 
the 
ontological 
existence 
of 
the 
universe 
it 
describes. 
We 
can 
reason 
about 
Polyphemus 
exactly 
because 
the 
objects 
of 
logic 
are 
pieces 
of 
information 
quite 
independently 
on 
their 
eventual 
fictitiousness. 
Anyhow 
the 
privileged 
role 
we 
must 
recognize 
to 
the 
actual 
statute; 
will 
be 
treated 
in 
Chapter 
13. 


8.2. 
An 
alethic 
procedure 
is 
essentially 
an 
informational 
collation 
which, 
as 
such, 
can 
be 
analysed 
in 
the 
institutive, 
in 
the 
propositive 
and 
in 
the 
properly 
collative 
stages. 
The 
institutive 
stage 
consists 
in 
the 
assumption 
of 
a 
statute 
k 
(k=k°&k’) 
that 
is 
of 
an 
arbitrary 
informational 
endowment 
constituting 
the 
basic 
element 
of 
the 
collation. 


The 
propositive 
stage 
consists 
in 
the 
assumption 
of 
a 
hypothesis 
h, 
that 
is 
of 
an 
arbitrary 
piece 
of 


information 
constituting 
the 
element 
to 
collate 
with 
the 
basic 
element. 
The 
collative 
stage 
consists 
in 
the 
comparison 
between 
h 
and 
k. 
The 
various 
alethic 
predicates 
correspond 
to 
the 
different 
results 
of 
this 
comparison. 


8.3. 
Although 
both 
an 
acquirement 
and 
a 
hypothesis 
are 
pieces 
of 
information, 
they 
play 
an 
opposite 
role 
in 
any 
alethic 
procedure. 
Let 
me 
spend 
few 
informal 
words 
about 
such 
an 
opposition. 
This 
academic 
hall 
is 
crowded 
by 
teachers 
and 
students. 
All 
of 
them, 
after 
all, 
are 
human 
beings, 
therefore, 
till 
the 
discourse 
concerns 
generically 
the 
human 
beings 
crowding 
this 
hall, 
one 
only 
sort 
of 
individual 
variables 
is 
sufficient. 
But, 
since 
the 



role 
of 
teachers 
and 
students, 
as 
for 
the 
examinations 
in 
course, 
is 
opposite; 
once 
the 
discourse 
involves 
examinations, 
the 
strictly 
complete 
symbolic 
endowment 
to 
reason 
on 
the 
universe 
constituted 
by 
the 
persons 
crowding 
the 
hall 
ought 
to 
list 
three 
sorts 
of 
individual 
variables; 
for 
instance 
“x” 
ranging 
over 
the 
subset 
of 
teachers, 
“y” 
ranging 
over 
the 
subset 
of 
students 
and 
“z” 
ranging 
over 
the 
whole 
set. 
We 
could 
even 
accept 
to 
renounce 
“z” 
(replacing 
it 
by 
a 
disjunction) 
but 
we 
could 
never 
accept 
further 
renounces, 
since 
a 
symbolic 
endowment 
listing 
only 
one 
sort 
of 
variables 
would 
mutilate 
our 
same 
expressive 
power. 
Analogously, 
with 
reference 
to 
pieces 
of 
information, 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
deal 
with 


collations, 
we 
need 
at 
least 
two 
sorts 
of 
variables 
as 
“k” 
(for 
cognitions) 
and 
“h” 
(for 
hypotheses). 
Correspondingly 
in 
® 
we 
need 
two 
sorts 
of 
marks. 
and 
I 
agree 
that 
in 
® 
cognitions 
are 
represented 
by 
shadings 
and 
hypotheses 
by 
hatchings. 


Therefore 
the 
elementary 
representation 
of 
an 
alethic 
procedure 
can 
be 
performed 
by 
two 
Ò-diagrams. 


Both 
of 
them 
start 
from 
the 
virgin 
circle 
representing 
k°: 
in 
the 
first 
(institutive) 
diagram 
the 
sectors 


representing 
the 
alternatives 
precluded 
by 
k’ 
are 
shaded; 
in 
the 
second 
(propositive) 
diagram 
the 


sectors 
representing 
the 
alternatives 
precluded 
by 
h 
are 
hatched. 
The 
collative 
stage 
is 
realized 
by 
comparing 
the 
relations 
between 
shaded 
field 
and 
hatched 
field. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
simplicity, 
once 
agreed 
that 
shadings 
and 
hatchings 
can 
overlap, 
the 
two 
diagrams 
can 
be 
unified, 
thus 
helping 
the 
comparison. 


8,4. 
Let 
h 
be 
a 
hypothesis 
concerning 
a 
statute 
k. 
We 
say 


a) 
that 
h 
is 
k-true 
(symbolically: 
Tk(h)) 
iff 
h 
does 
not 
preclude 
any 
k-free 
alternative 
2. 
that 
h 
is 
k-false 
(symbolically: 
Fk(h)) 
iff 
~h 
is 
k-true, 
that 
is 
if 
h 
precludes 
all 
the 
k-free 
alternatives 
3. 
that 
h 
is 
k-decidable 
(symbolically: 
Dk(h)) 
iff 
h 
is 
either 
k-true 
or 
k-false 
4. 
that 
h 
is 
k-undecidable 
(symbolically: 
Uk(h)) 
iff 
h 
is 
neither 
k-true 
nor 
k-false 
5. 
that 
k 
is 
h-exhaustive 
iff 
h 
is 
k-decidable 
(§6.4.3) 
6. 
that 
k 
is 
h-incomplete 
iff 
h 
is 
k-undecidable. 
8.4.1. 
In 
§10.1 
the 
theme 
concerning 
the 
choice 
of 
“undecidable” 
in 
order 
to 
adduce 
the 
above 
agreed 
piece 
of 
information 
will 
be 
deepened. 
8.4.2. 
The 
notion 
of 
h-exhaustiveness 
(of 
h-incompleteness) 
can 
be 
strengthened 
by 
agreeing 
that 
a 
statute 
k 
is 
absolutely 
exhaustive 
(absolutely 
incomplete) 
iff 
it 
is 
h-exhaustive 
(h-incomplete) 
for 


every 
h 
concerning 
its 
possibility 
space. 


8.5. 
The 
definitions 
of 
§8.4 
are 
not 
affected 
by 
any 
arbitrariness: 
they 
are 
dictated 
by 
previous 
assumptions 
and 
by 
the 
usual 
meanings 
of 
alethic 
predicates. 
In 
fact, 
owing 
to 
the 
link 
between 
*truth* 
and 
*probability* 
(§1: 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
h 
is 
k-true 
iff 
P(h|k)=1 
and 
is 
k-false 
iff 
P(h|k)=0), 


h 
is 
k-true 
implies 


mk(h)= 
mk(k) 
k&h=k 
kÉh 



and 


h 
is 
k-false 
implies 


mk(h)= 
0 
k&h=^ 
kÉ~h. 


Once 
expressed 
in 
terms 
of 
measures 
the 
definitions 
Uk(h) 
= 
(0< 
mk(h)< 
mk(k)) 


Dk(h) 
=(~(~(mk(h)=mk(k)&~(mk(h)=0))) 


Tk(h) 
=(mk(h)= 
mk(k)) 


Fk(h) 
=(mk(h)= 
0) 
evidence 
immediately 
some 
intuitive 
alethic 
relations. 
For 
instance 
-that 
the 
opposite 
of 
a 
k-undecidable 
hypothesis 
is 
k-undecidable, 
too 


-that 
the 
opposite 
of 
a 
k-decidable 
and 
k-true 
hypothesis 
is 
a 
k-decidable 
and 
k-false 
one 


-that 
for 
every 
coherent 
statute 
Tk(Ø) 
and 
Fk(^) 
et 
cetera. 
Let 
me 
insist. 
Alethics 
is 
an 
intrinsically 
relational 
doctrine 
because 
the 
truth 
(or 
falsity 
et 
cetera) 
of 
a 
hypothesis 
results 
from 
its 
collation 
with 
another 
information 
(the 
statute). 
And 
the 
informational 
approach 
evidences 
the 
intrinsically 
relational 
character 
of 
alethic 
predicates. 
In 
this 
sense 
*k-true* 
(*kfalse* 
et 
cetera) 
is 
the 
correct 
notion 
by 
which 
*true* 
(*false* 
et 
cetera) 
must 
always 
be 
replaced. 


8.6. 
The 
representation 
is 
immediate. 
So 
while 
the 
hatched 
field 
representing 
a 
k-true 
hypothesis 
must 
respect 
every 
k-virgin 
sector 
(as 
mk(h)= 
mk(k)), 
the 
hatched 
field 
representing 
a 


k-false 
hypothesis 
must 
involve 
every 
k-virgin 
sector 
and 
the 
hatched 
field 
representing 
a 
k-

undecidable 
hypothesis 
must 
involve 
some 
but 
not 
every 
k-virgin 
sectors. 
Therefore 
undecidableness 


entails 
at 
least 
two 
k-virgin 
sectors, 
that 
is 
(obviously) 
the 
non-exhaustiveness 
of 
the 
statute 
(undecidableness 
follows 
from 
some 
kind 
of 
ignorance). 
The 
problem 
of 
verifying 
an 
undecidable 
hypothesis 
is 
the 
problem 
of 
acquiring 
new 
cognitions, 
so 
that 
the 
increased 
shaded 
field 
covers 
either 
the 
hatched 
one 
(thus 
making 
true 
the 
hypothesis 
under 
scrutiny) 
or 
the 
non-hatched 
one 
(thus 
making 
it 
false). 


8.6.1. 
I 
do 
not 
show 
in 
detail 
that 
every 
formal 
interdependence 
among 
the 
various 
alethic 
predicates 
as, 
for 
instance, 
Tk(h) 
= 
Fk(~h), 


Uk(h) 
=(~Tk(h) 
& 
~Fk(h)) 


Dk(h) 
= 
~(~Tk(h) 
& 
~Fk(h)) 


is 
adequately 
and 
unambiguously 
represented 
in 
Ò. 
For 
instance 
the 
absolute 
exhaustiveness 
is 
represented 
by 
a 
diagram 
where 
only 
one 
sector 
is 
virgin; 
in 
fact 
whatever 
complementary 
bipartition 
of 
the 
circle 
is 
such 
that 
exactly 
one 
of 
its 
two 
fields 
falls 
into 



the 
previously 
shaded 
one, 
therefore 
whatever 
hypothesis 
is 
decidable. 
Analogously 
the 
absolute 
incompleteness 
is 
represented 
by 
a 
completely 
virgin 
circle. 


8.6.1.1. 
A 
pedantry. 
While 
in 
§8.6.1 
the 
decidability 
is 
defined 
through 
the 
inclusive 
disjunction 
~(~Tk(h) 
& 
~Fk(h)) 
in 
§8.4 
it 
is 
explained 
through 
a 
partitive 
disjunction 
(either 
true 
or 
false). 
The 
inaccuracy 
is 
only 
apparent, 
because 
the 
prejudicial 
condition 
of 
coherence 
entails 


~(Tk(h) 
& 
Fk(h)) 
that 
is 
the 
exclusive 
component 
of 
the 
partitive 
disjunction. 


8.6.2. 
Let 
me 
insist. 
In 
® 
the 
various 
alethic 
predicates 
correspond 
to 
precise 
diagrammatic 
situations 
whose 
essential 
discriminating 
factor 
is 
the 
‘topological’ 
relation 
between 
the 
k-virgin 
and 
the 
h-
hatched 
fields. 
Therefore 
the 
possible 
and 
reciprocally 
incompatible 
results 
of 
a 
collation 
are 


I) 
the 
hatched 
field 
does 
not 
involve 
the 
k-virgin 
field 
(that 
is: 
the 
whole 
hatched 
field 
falls 
into 
the 
shaded 
field) 
II) 
the 
hatched 
field 
involves 
the 
whole 
k-virgin 
field 
(and, 
eventually, 
a 
part 
of 
the 
shaded 
field) 
III) 
the 
hatched 
field 
involves 
only 
a 
part 
of 
the 
k-virgin 
field 
(and, 
eventually, 
a 
part 
of 
the 
shaded 
field). 
The 
case 
I) 
represents 
a 
k-true, 
the 
case 
II) 
represents 
a 
k-false 
and 
the 
case 
III 
reepresents 
a 
k-
undecidable 
hypothesis 
(of 
course 
the 
case 
III) 
entails 
an 
incomplete 
statute, 
because 
a 
virgin 
field 
constituted 
by 
only 
one 
sector 
cannot 
be 
partially 
hatched). 


8.6.3. 
The 
example 
I 
am 
about 
to 
analyse 
starts 
from 
the 
statute 
k=k°&k’ 
got 
by 
adding 
the 
acquirement 
k’ 


the 
slider 
is 
in 
the 
last 
quarter 
of 
the 
tract 


to 
our 
basic 
k°. 
Then 
Figure 
8.0 



represents 
k. 
With 
reference 
to 
it, 



the 
slider 
is 
not 
in 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
the 
tract 
(h1 
represented 
in 
Figure 
8.1) 


the 
slider 
is 
in 
the 
first 
half 
of 
the 
tract 
(h2 
represented 
in 
Figure 
8.2) 


the 
slider 
is 
in 
an 
odd 
segment 
(h3 
represented 
in 
Figure 
8.3) 



are 
the 
three 
different 
hypotheses 
under 
alethic 
scrutiny. 
Once 
recalled 
that 
the 
k-measure 
of 
a 
h 
is 
represented 
by 
the 
area 
of 
the 
k&h-virgin 
field, 
we 
can 


diagrammatically 
infer 
that 
Tk(h1),that 
Fk(h2) 
and 
that 
Uk(h3). 
In 
fact 
mk(k&h1)= 
mk(k) 


(both 
the 
virgin 
sectors 
of 
Figure 
8.0, 
that 
is 
the 
sectors 
7 
and 
8, 
are 
virgin 
in 
Figure 
8.1 
too) 


mk(k&h2)= 
0 


(both 
the 
virgin 
sectors 
of 
Figure 
8.0 
are 
hatched 
in 
Figure 
8.2) 
0< 
mk(k&h3)< 
mk(k) 
(only 
one 
virgin 
sectors 
of 
Figure 
8.0 
is 
hatched 
in 
Figure 
8.3). 
Of 
course 
the 
probabilistic 
values 
resulting 
from 
the 
areal 
ratios, 
that 
is 
P(h1|k)=1, 
P(h2|k)=0, 


P(h3|k)=1/2, 
correspond 
to 
our 
intuitive 
suggestions. 


8.7. 
A 
momentous 
theme 
concerns 
the 
formulation 
adopted 
in 
§7.1 
in 
order 
to 
present 
a 
system 
of 
axioms. 
First 
of 
all 
I 
wish 
to 
avoid 
a 
possible 
equivocation; 
the 
momentousness 
does 
not 
follow 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
those 
variables, 
instead 
of 
ranging 
as 
usual 
over 
sentences, 
range 
over 
propositions. 
In 
fact, 
for 
instance, 
once 
recalled 
that 
“s” 
names 
the 
semantic 
relation 
and 
once 
agreed 
that 
“e” 
is 
a 
variable 
ranging 
over 
sentences 
so 
that 
“se” 
simply 
means 
*the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
e*, 


if 
se1 
and 
if 
se2, 
then 
s(e1&e2) 


could 
replace 
AX3 
et 
cetera. 
Keeping 
propositions 
as 
objects 
of 
axioms 
overcomes 
even 
the 
problem 
concerning 
the 
oxymoron 
between 
*substitution* 
and 
*identity* 
(Chapter 
7, 
§2.2) 
for, 
of 
course, 
since 
se1=se2 
does 
not 
imply 
e1=e2, 
in 



if 
se1 
and 
if 
se1=se2, 
then 
se2 


we 
deal 
with 
two 
different 
(therefore 
non 
identical) 
sentences 
adducing 
the 
same 
(therefore 
identical) 
piece 
of 
information. 


8.7.1. 
The 
momentousness 
of 
the 
theme 
(that 
is 
the 
reason 
why 
I 
spoke 
of 
a 
propaedeutic 
system 
of 
axioms) 
depends 
on 
the 
non-strictness 
of 
such 
formulations: 
in 
fact 
they 
are 
omissive. 
Let 
me 
be 
meticulous, 
looking 
at 
the 
same 
notion 
of 
an 
axiom 
from 
a 
general 
informational 
viewpoint. 
An 
axiom 
assigns 
an 
alethic 
value 
to 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
connected 
in 
some 
way 
with 
pieces 
of 
information 
whose 
alethic 
value 
is 
presupposed. 
In 
other 
words, 
an 
axiom 
is 
an 
instrument 
for 
inferring. 
Of 
course, 
since 
alethic 
values 
depend 
on 
the 
statutes 
of 
reference, 
any 
inference 
too 
depends 
on 
the 
statutes 
of 
reference. 
Actually 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
propose 
inferences 
concerning 
various 
alethic 
values 
and 
various 
statutes. 
For 
instance 


if 
h1 
is 
k°&k’-undecidable, 
then 
h1& 
h2 
cannot 
be 
k°-true 


is 
a 
correct 
inference 
concerning 
two 
different 
hypotheses 
and 
two 
different 
statutes. 
The 
essential 
dependence 
of 
alethic 
predicates 
on 
the 
statute 
of 
reference 
is 
a 
necessary 
consequence 
of 
their 
intrinsically 
relational 
nature. 
A 
logic 
for 
statements 
concerning 
different 
statutes 
is 
a 
very 
wide 
matter 
(few 
notes 
in 
§15 
below). 


Here 
I 
only 
deal 
with 
one 
only 
statute 
and 
with 
true 
pieces 
of 
information. 
These 
agreements 
allow 
us 
to 
omit 
both 
indications, 
so 
for 
instance 
reducing 
an 
explicit 
(therefore 
a 
non-omissive) 
formulation 
like 


if 
h1 
is 
k-true 
and 
h2 
is 
k-true, 
then 
h1& 
h2 
is 
k-true 


or 
better 
like 


(8.i) 
if 
Tk(h1) 
and 
if 
Tk(h2) 
then 
Tk(h1&h2) 
to 
an 
implicit 
formulation 
like 


if 
h1 
and 
h2, 
then 
h1& 
h2 


that 
is 
to 
the 
formulation 
of 
AX3 
proposed 
in 
§7.1. 
Analogously 


if 
Tk(h1) 
and 
if 
Tk(h1=h2) 
then 
Tk(h2) 


is 
the 
explicit 
formulation 
of 
AX2. 
And 
so 
on. 
Therefore 
any 
inference 
concerning 
different 
statutes 
must 
make 
explicit 
the 
various 
statutes 
of 
contingent 
reference 
(explicit 
inferences). 
That 
is: 
only 
inferences 
concerning 
one 
only 
statute 
can 
omit 



the 
respective 
reference 
(implicit 
inferences). 


8.7.1.1. 
A 
pedantry. 
In 
order 
to 
avoid 
any 
autonymy,“&” 
and 
“~” 
might 
be 
replaced 
by 
their 
names 
as 
“CONG” 
and 
“NEG”. 
Under 
this 
convention, 
for 
instance, 
(8.ii) 
If 
Tk(h1) 
and 
if 
Tk(h2) 
then 
Tk(CONG(h1,h2) 
is 
the 
re-formulation 
of 
(8.i) 
et 
cetera. 
Yet, 
once 
this 
passage 
has 
been 
emphasized, 
I 
will 
prefer 
(8.i) 
to 


(8.ii) 
merely 
in 
order 
not 
to 
go 
too 
far 
from 
the 
usual 
symbolizations. 
8.8. 
I 
call 
“competence 
condition” 
the 
fundamental 
rule 
according 
to 
which, 
in 
an 
implicit 
inference 
only 
pieces 
of 
information 
belonging 
to 
the 
same 
statute 
can 
be 
used. 
The 
violation 
of 
the 
competence 
condition 
leads 
to 
potential 
absurdities. 
8.8.1. 
An 
easy 
example 
(all 
new 
lines 
are 
metalinguistic). 
While 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
(8.iii) 
Tegucigalpa 
is 
the 
capital 
of 
Guatemala 
is 
kAva-true 
(belongs 
to 
Ava’s 
present 
statute) 
because 
actually 
Ava 
thinks 
so, 
and 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 


(8.iv) 
Tegucigalpa 
is 
the 
capital 
of 
Nicaragua 
is 
kBob-true 
because 
actually 
Bob 
thinks 
so, 
evidently 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
the 
conjunction 
of 
(iii) 
and 
(iv), 
that 
is 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 


Tegucigalpa 
is 
the 
capital 
of 
Guatemala 
and 
Tegucigalpa 
is 
the 
capital 
of 
Nicaragua 


is 
neither 
kAva-true 
nor 
kBob-true 
(none 
of 
them 
thinks 
that 
Guatemala 
and 
Nicaragua 
have 
the 
same 
capital). 
Yet 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
realize 
that 
we 
are 
reasoning 
about 
two 
different 
(and 
incompatible) 
statutes, 
we 
realize 
that 
the 
competence 
condition 
compels 
us 
to 
make 
explicit 
the 
respective 
references. 
And 
indeed, 
since 
both 
the 
pieces 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 


(8.v) 
Ava 
thinks 
that 
Tegucigalpa 
is 
the 
capital 
of 
Guatemala 
and 
by 
Bob 
thinks 
that 
Tegucigalpa 
is 
the 
capital 
of 
Nicaragua 
are 
speaker-true, 
AX3 
assures 
us 
that 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
their 
conjunction 
too, 
that 
is 



Ava 
thinks 
that 
Tegucigalpa 
is 
the 
capital 
of 
Guatemala 
and 
Bob 
thinks 
that 
Tegucigalpa 
is 
the 
capital 
of 
Nicaragua 


is 
speaker-true. 
Actually, 
since 
we 
know 
that 
Tegucigalpa 
is 
the 
capital 
of 
Honduras, 


(8.vi) 
Tegucigalpa 
is 
the 
capital 
of 
Honduras 
states 
a 
speaker-true 
identity. 
If 
we 
use 
(8.vi) 
for 
a 
substitution 
in 
(8.v) 
we 
get 


(8.vii) 
Ava 
thinks 
that 
the 
capital 
of 
Honduras 
is 
the 
capital 
of 
Guatemala 
that 
is 
a 
sentence 
whose 
interpretation, 
in 
spite 
of 
its 
resemblance 
to 
(8.v), 
is 
ambiguous. 
In 
fact 
if 
we 
read 
(8.vii) 
as 


(8.viii) 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
“the 
capital 
of 
Honduras 
is 
the 
capital 
of 
Guatemala” 
belongs 
to 
kAva 
we 
face 
a 
sentence 
adducing 
a 
false 
proposition 
(Ava 
does 
not 
at 
all 
think 
that 
Honduras 
and 
Guatemala 
have 
the 
same 
capital). 
On 
the 
contrary 
if 
we 
read 
(8.vii) 
as 


(8.ix) 
Ava 
erroneously 
thinks 
that 
the 
town 
which 
is 
the 
real 
capital 
of 
Honduras 
is 
the 
capital 
of 
Guatemala 
we 
face 
a 
sentence 
adducing 
a 
true 
proposition. 
And 
the 
opposite 
alethic 
values 
of 
(8.viii) 
and 
(8.ix) 
are 
the 
due 
consequences 
of 
the 
competence 
condition. 
In 
fact 
the 
falsity 
of 
(8.viii) 
(recycling 
use 
of 
a 
new 
line, 
what 
can 
be 
false 
is 
a 
proposition, 
not 
a 
sentence), 
the 
falsity 
of 
(8.viii), 
then, 
follows 
from 
the 
violation 
of 
the 
same 
condition: 
as 
the 


piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
(8.vi) 
does 
belong 
to 
kspeaker 
but, 
like 
(8.iv), 
does 
not 
belong 
to 


kAva, 
it 
cannot 
be 
used 
for 
a 
substitution 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
“belongs 
to 
kAva”. 
On 
the 
contrary 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
(8.ix) 
follows 
from 
respecting 
the 
mentioned 
condition: 
in 
fact 
such 
an 
interpretation 
refers 
to 
kspeaker, 
and 
as 
both 
the 
pieces 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
(8.v) 
and 
by 
(8.vi) 
belong 
to 
such 
a 
statute, 
the 
identity 
stated 
by 
(8.vii) 
can 
be 
used 
for 
a 
substitution 
in 
(8.v) 


because 
we 
are 
looking 
at 
Ava’s 
beliefs 
from 
the 
speaker’s 
viewpoint 
(that 
is 
because 
the 
statute 
of 
reference 
is 
kspeaker). 


8.8.2. 
The 
chronological 
dimension 
is 
not 
involved 
in 
the 
example 
above. 
Yet, 
of 
course, 
the 
difference 
between 
two 
statutes 
may 
also 
depend 
exclusively 
on 
a 
difference 
between 
the 
temporal 
reference. 
Here 
is 
an 
example.. 
Though 
at 
t° 
Ava 
thought 
(8.iii), 
at 
t’ 
she 
realized 
her 
mistake, 
and 
consequently 
replaced 
(8.iii) 
with 
(8.vi), 
which 
then 
belongs 
to 
kAva 
too, 
thus 
legitimating 
the 
inference 
of 
(8.vii); 
nevertheless 
(8.vii) 
continues 
being 
false, 
since 
Ava 
does 
not 
at 
all 
think 
that 
Honduras 
and 
Guatemala 
have 
the 
same 



capital. 
But 
here 
too 
we 
are 
dealing 
with 
two 
(incompatible) 
statutes: 
kAva,t° 
(shortly 
k°) 
and 
kAva,t’ 
(shortly 
k’). 
If 
we 
choose 
to 
reason 
under 
k° 
we 
recover 
the 
above 
analysis, 
and 
if 
we 
choose 
to 
reason 
under 
k’, 
we 
cannot 
use 
(8.ii) 
because 
under 
k’ 
Ava 
no 
longer 
thinks 
that 
Tegucigalpa 
is 
the 
capital 
of 
Guatemala. 
What 
we 
can 
correctly 
argue 
is 
that, 
since 
at 
t° 
Ava 
thought 
that 
Tegucigalpa 
is 
the 
capital 
of 
Guatemala 
belongs 
to 
k’ 
(Ava 
remembers 
her 
previous 
erroneous 
belief), 
the 
competence 
condition 
makes 
at 
t°Ava 
thought 
that 
the 
capital 
of 
Honduras 
is 
the 
capital 
of 
Guatemala 
a 
k’-legitimate 
inference; 
and 
accordingly 
we 
recognize 
that 
its 
conclusion 
is 
k’-true. 


8.8.3. 
The 
competence 
condition 
rules 
all 
pieces 
of 
information 
occurring 
in 
an 
inference, 
and 
therefore 
the 
implicative 
relations 
too. 
So 
it 
would 
be 
easy 
to 
contradict 
the 
Theorem 
of 
Transitivity 
(Chapter 
6, 
Theor6) 
or 
even 
the 
Modus 
Ponens 
by 
an 
application 
as 


if 
kÉh1 
and 
if 
h1Éh2 
then 
kÉh2 


and 
by 
supposing 
that 
h1Éh2 
does 
not 
hold 
in 
k. 
For 
instance 
(hyperlinguistic 
new 
lines) 
Flipper 
is 
a 
dolphin 
is 
true 
for 
Ava, 
but, 
though 
*dolphin* 
implies 
*mammal* 
is 
speaker-true, 
since 
Ava 
is 
unaware 
that 
dolphins 
are 
mammals, 


Flipper 
is 
a 
mammal 
is 
not 
true 
for 
Ava. 
Yet 
the 
necessity 
of 
respecting 
the 
competence 
condition 
makes 
(8.x) 
If 
kÉh1 
and 
kÉ(h1Éh2) 
then 
kÉh2 
the 
correct 
formulation 
(which, 
as 
such, 
cannot 
be 
the 
source 
of 
the 
well 
known 
puzzling 
questions 


about 
oblique 
contexts). 
Anyhow 
this 
topic 
will 
be 
scrutinized 
in 
Appendix 
16. 


8.8.4. 
Even 
the 
most 
obvious 
statement 
as 

if 
h 
then 
h 


could 
be 
immediately 
contradicted 
by 
referring 
the 
two 
occurrences 
of 
h 
to 
two 
locally 
incompatible 
statutes. 
In 
this 
sense 
contexts 
where 
one 
of 
the 
different 
statutes 
is 
the 
speaker’s 
one 
(so 
calling 
the 
statute 
containing 
previously 
supplied 
or 
universally 
known 
pieces 
of 
information) 
are 
peculiarly 
insidious. 


8.9. 
The 
explicit 
formulations 
allow 
a 
stricter 
approach 
to 
nothing 
less 
than 
the 
same 
Aristotelian 
Non 
Contradictio 
(NC) 
and 
Tertium 
Non 
Datur 
(TND) 
principles. 
Their 
usual 
symbolization, 
that 
is 


(8.xi) 
~(h&~h) 
for 
NC 
and 
(8.xii) 
hÚ 
~ 
h 
for 
TND, 
leads 
to 
an 
impasse. 
In 
fact, 
since 
by 
definition 
h1Ú 
h2 
is 


~ 
(~ 
h1& 
~h2) 
and 
since 
(Theor15) 
~~h=h 
it 
follows 
that 
(8.xi) 
and 
(8.xii) 
are 
equivalent 
(reciprocally 
derivable). 
Quite 
a 
disconcerting 
conclusion, 
indeed, 
at 
least 
because 
qualified 
scholars 
(intuitionists, 
for 
instance) 
accept 
the 
universal 
validity 
of 
NC 
but 
not 
of 
TND. 
I 
claim 
that 
the 
root 
of 
the 
impasse 
is 
exactly 
the 
inadequateness 
of 
the 
quoted 
formulations. 
What 
NC 


and 
TND 
intend 
to 
establish 
is 
that 
two 
opposite 
pieces 
of 
information 
cannot 
be 
both 
true 
nor 
both 
non-true. 
Therefore 
both 
principles 
are 
hyperlinguistic 
statements 
whose 
(hyper-)information 
results 
from 
the 
attribution 
of 
an 
alethic 
predicate 
to 
some 
(object-)information. 
In 
this 
sense 
(8.xi) 
and 
(8.xii) 
are 
mutilating 
because 
the 
alethic 
predicates 
are 
omitted. 
And 
as 
soon 
as 
this 
undue 
mutilation 
is 
corrected 
by 
replacing 
(8.xi) 
and 
(8.xii) 
respectively 
with 


(8.xiii) 
~ 
(Tk(h) 
& 
Tk(~h)) 
and 
with 
Tk(h) 
Ú 
Tk(~h)) 
that 
is 
with 
(8.xiv) 
~(~ 
(Tk(h) 
& 
~Tk(~h)) 
the 
impasse 
vanishes; 
in 
fact 
(8.xiii) 
and 
(8.xiv) 
are 
not 
at 
all 
equivalent. 
While 
NC 
holds 
both 
in 


bivalence 
and 
in 
trivalence 
(no 
coherent 
logic 
can 
accept 
dilemmas 
|h| 
where 
both 
h 
and 
~h 
are 
true) 


TND 
holds 
only 
in 
bivalence 
(trivalence 
rules 
undecidable 
dilemmas 
too, 
and 
any 
undecidable 
dilemma 


contradicts 
(8.xiv)). 
In 
other 
words: 
the 
simple 
coherence 
of 
a 
statute 
k 
is 
sufficient 
to 
exclude 
that 



both 
h 
and 
~h 
can 
be 
k-true, 
but 
only 
the 
|h|-exhaustiveness 
of 
a 
statute 
k 
can 
assure 
that 
at 
least 
one 
of 
the 
two 
opposite 
hypotheses 
is 
k-true. 
Thus 
the 
reason 
is 
explained 
why 
TND 
may 
fail 
with 


reference 
to 
incomplete 
statutes: 
because 
the 
non-incompleteness 
condition 
limits 
its 
universal 
validity. 
And 
just 
because 
reality 
is 
absolutely 
exhaustive 
(the 
exhaustive 
coherence 
of 
the 
world 
we 
live 
in 
is 
recognized 
even 
by 
some 
logicians) 
TND 
is 
valid 
in 
the 
logic 
of 
an 
ideal 
knower. 


8.9.1. 
The 
definitions 
of 
§8.4 
allow 
the 
formal 
derivation 
of 
the 
conclusions 
above 
(I 
remind 
the 
reader 
that, 
in 
order 
not 
to 
waste 
time, 
we 
are 
reasoning 
under 
the 
presupposition 
of 
coherence 
for 
k). 
As 
for 
NC. 
Let 
Tk(h). 
By 
definition: 
k&h=k. 
By 
Theor9: 
k&~h=^. 
By 
definition: 
Fk(~h). 
By 
definition: 
~Tk(~h). 
Therefore 
NC 
is 
derivable 
without 
any 
condition 
of 
bivalence. 


As 
for 
TND. 
Let 
Tk(h)Ú 
Tk(~h)), 
that 
is 
~(~ 
(Tk(h) 
& 
~Tk(~h).) 
By 
NC: 
~(Tk(h)& 
Tk(~h)). 
Therefore 
either 
Tk(h) 
or 
Tk(~h). 
By 
definition 
either 
Tk(h) 
or 
Fk(h). 
Therefore 
~(~ 
Tk(h)& 
~Fk(h)) 
that 
is 
~Uk(h): 
Ergo 
TND 
implies 
bivalence. 


8.10. 
Also 
the 
diagrammatic 
counter-part 
of 
the 
derivations 
proposed 
in 
§8.9.1 
is 
immediate 
(the 
k-
coherence 
entails 
a 
non 
completely 
shaded 
circle, 
that 
is 
the 
presence 
of 
at 
least 
one 
virgin 
sector). 
As 
for 
NC. 
The 
complement 
of 
a 
hatched 
field 
falling 
into 
the 
shaded 
field 
cannot 
fall 
into 
the 
same 
shaded 
field 
quite 
independently 
on 
the 
number 
of 
virgin 
sectors 
(therefore 
NC 
rules 
also 
non-
exhaustive 
statutes, 
that 
is 
it 
rules 
both 
bivalence 
and 
trivalence). 


As 
for 
TND. 
In 
order 
to 
be 
sure 
that 
at 
least 
one 
of 
two 
complementary 
fields 
falls 
into 
the 
shaded 
field, 
the 
virgin 
field 
cannot 
be 
formed 
by 
more 
than 
one 
sector. 
Therefore 
TND 
is 
valid 
only 
under 
exhaustive 
statutes, 
that 
is 
only 
in 
bivalence. 


8.11. 
Two 
last 
words 
(referred 
directly 
to 
Ò) 
about 
the 
decision 
of 
neglecting 
incoherent 
statutes. 
Let 
me 
consider 
a 
k=^, 
that 
is 
a 
completely 
shaded 
circle, 
that 
is 
a 
mk(k)= 
0 
. 
On 
the 
one 
hand 
I 
could 
claim 
that 
every 
hypothesis 
is 
k–true 
because 
any 
hatching 
falls 
into 
the 
shaded 
field 
(here 
is 
the 
representation 
of 
the 
scholastic 
ex 
absurdo 
quodlibet). 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
I 
could 
also 
claim 
that 
every 
hypothesis 
is 
k–false, 
because 
no 
virgin 
sector 
survives 
to 
shading 
and 
hatching. 
The 
absurdity 
of 
the 
situation, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
legitimates 
only 
one 
trustworthy 
conclusion: 
that 
incoherence 
is 
too 
deceiving 
a 
topic 
to 
be 
analyzed 
in 
a 
rational 
way. 
Therefore 
I 
firmly 
insist 
in 
neglecting 
incoherent 
statutes. 


8.12. 
A 
possible 
objection 
concerning 
the 
re-partitioning 
technique 
runs 
as 
follows. 
Let 
us 
call 
“k°-pregnant” 
a 
hypothesis 
iff 
it 
concerns 
such 
a 
possibility 
space, 
being 
neither 
tautologic 
nor 
contradictory. 
While 
the 
technique 
by 
shading 
admits 
pregnant 
and 
true 
hypotheses, 
the 
technique 
by 
re-partitioning 
does 
not. 
For 
instance, 
if 
we 
reduce 
Figure 
8.0 
to 
a 
virgin 
circle 
bi-
partitioned 
in 
the 
sectors 
7 
and 
8, 
no 
hatching 
can 
interest 
only 
shaded 
sectors, 
therefore 
no 
pregnant 
hypothesis 
can 
be 
true. 


Reply. 
Under 
the 
re-partitioning 
technique 
those 
k°-pregnant 
hypotheses 
are 
true 
whose 
hatching 
does 


not 
interest 
the 
virgin 
circle. 
I 
remind 
the 
reader 
(§6.13) 
that 
this 
technique 
is 
less 
complete 
(it 
adduces 
less 
information) 
than 
the 
technique 
by 
shading, 
where 
the 
precluded 
alternatives 
too 
are 
represented. 



In 
other 
words. 
Once 
we 
agree 
that 
the 
precluded 
alternatives 
are 
neither 
represented, 
we 
agree 
not 
to 
represent 
any 
true 
piece 
of 
information.

The

in 
TABLE 
1, 
while 
(8.xv) 
and 
(8.xvi) 
concern 
bivalence, 
(8.xvii) 
concerns 
trivalence. 
A 
tetravalent 
approach 
to 
trivalence 
(no 
oxymoron) 
will 
be 
proposed 
in 
Chapter 
9. 
Here 
I 
presuppose 
that 
every 
piece 
of 
information 
we 
deal 
with 
is 
sortally 
correct. 
Diagrammatically 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
a 
trivalent 
logic 
cannot 
concern 
an 
absolutely 
exhaustive 
statute 
(if 


k 
leaves 
a 
monosectorial 
virgin 
field, 
either 
such 
a 
sector 
is 
h-hatched, 
and 
then 
h 
is 
k-false, 
or 
it 
is 
h-

virgin, 
and 
then 
h 
is 
k-true). 
Since 
a 
trivalent 
logic 
can 
only 
depend 
on 
some 
lack 
of 
information, 
we 
could 
say 
that 
bivalence 
is 
the 
logic 
of 
the 
ideal 
knower 
(or 
of 
a 
human 
knower 
whose 
statute 
is 
exhaustive 
as 
for 
the 
hypotheses 
under 
scrutiny). 
I 
emphasize 
that 
the 
compilation 
of 
TABLE 
1 
does 
not 
need 
any 
integrative 
assumption; 
in 
fact 
all 
the 


alethic 
values 
for 
~h 
follow 
theoremically 
from 
the 
respective 
alethic 
values 
for 
h.

2 
does 
not 
need 
any 
integrative 
assumption, 
since 
all 
the 
alethic 
values 
for 


h1& 
h2 
follow 
theoremically 
from 
the 
respective 
alethic 
values 
for 
h1 
and 
for 
h2. 
Let 
me 
show 
this 


concisely. 
The 
derivations 
of 
(8.xviii) 
(8.xix), 
(8.xx) 
and 
(8.xxi) 
are 
similar. 
I 
sketch 
the 
derivation 
of 
(8.xix): 
Tk(h1) 
ergo 
k&h1=k; 
Fk(h2)ergo 
k&~h2=k. 
Theor7: 
k&h1&~h2= 
k. 
Theor10 
k&h1&h2= 
^. 
By 


definition 
Fk(h1&h2). 


The 
compatibility 
of 
h1 
and 
h2 
is 
implicitly 
assured 
in 
(8.xviii) 
and 
in 
(8.xxi), 
since 
two 
incompatible 
pieces 
of 
information 
(owing 
to 
the 
coherence 
of 
k) 
cannot 
be 
both 
k-true 
or 
both 
k-false. 
And 
the 
eventual 
incompatibility 
of 
h1 
and 
h2 
is 
of 
no 
moment 
in 
(8.xix) 
and 
(8.xx), 
since 
their 


conjunction 
would 
anyway 
be 
false. 
The 
derivation 
of 
(8.xxii) 
runs 
as 
follows. 
Since 
k&h1=k, 
~(k&h2=k), 
~(k&~h2=k), 
surely 
h1&h2 
cannot 
be 
k-true 
because, 
if 
it 
were, 
then 
k&h2=k, 
contrary 
to 
Uk(h2). 
But 
neither 
h1&h2 
can 
be 
k-
false, 
because 
if 
k&~(h1&h2)=k, 
since 
k&h1=k 
and 
h1&~(h1&h2)É~h2, 
then 
k&~h2=k, 
contrary 
to 
Uk(h2). 
But 
~Tk(h1&h2)& 
~Fk(h1&h2) 
is 
just 
Uk(h1&h2). 
The 
incompatibility 
between 
h1 
and 
h2 
is 
an 
eventuality 
that 
we 
must 
reject 
because 
if 
they 
were 
incompatible, 
Tk(h1) 
would 
entail 
Fk(h2). 


The 
derivation 
of 
(8.xxiii), 
(8.xxiv) 
and 
(8.xxv) 
is 
analogous. 
On 
the 
contrary 
the 
derivation 
of 
(8.xxvi) 
and 
(8.xxvii) 
requires 
a 
more 
detailed 
analysis. 
Since 
Uk(h1), 
h1&h2 
cannot 
be 
k-true 
because 
if 
it 
were 
k-true 
k& 
h1&h2 
=k, 
therefore 
k&h1=k, 
contrary 
to 
Uk(h1). 
So 
either 
Fk(h1&h2) 
or 
Uk(h1&h2). 
If 
Fk(h1&h2), 
then 
(k&(h1&h2)=^, 
then 



((k&h1)&h2)=^), 
then 
And 
if 
then 
~((k&h1)&h2=^), 
then 
~(k& 


Fk&h1(h2). 
~Fk&h1(h2), 


(h1&h2)=k), 
then 
~Fk(h1&h2). 
But 
~Tk(h1&h2)& 
~Fk(h1&h2) 
is 
just 
Uk(h1&h2). 
This 
analysis 
corresponds 
to 
the 
paradigm 
offered 
by 
®. 
In 
fact 
we 
have 
two 
topologically 
different 
diagrams 
representing 
an 
h1 
and 
an 
h2 
such 
that 
Uk(h1) 
and 
Uk(h2). 
In 
one 
of 
them 
the 
two 
hatchings, 
once 


joined, 
do 
not 
leave 
any 
virgin 
sector, 
and 
then 
Fk(h1&h2)). 
In 
the 
other 
they 
do, 
and 
then 
Uk(h1&h2)). 
For 
instance, 
under 
the 
usual 
k° 
(a 
rail 
partitioned 
in 
8 
segments 
et 
cetera), 
once 


the 
slider 
is 
in 
the 
first 
half 
of 
the 
tract 


is 
assumed 
as 
k’ 
and 


the 
slider 
is 
in 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
the 
tract 


is 
assumed 
as 
the 
k-undecidable 
h1. 
if 
the 
k-undecidable 
h2 
is 


(8.xxvi*) 
the 
slider 
is 
in 
the 
second 
quarter 
of 
the 
tract 


h1&h2 
is 
k-false, 
while 
if 
the 
k-undecidable 
h2 
is 


(8.xxvii*) 
the 
slider 
is 
in 
the 
segment 
2 


h1&h2 
is 
k-undecidable. 


8.15. 
Since 
the 
alethic 
value 
of 
a 
h 
depends 
strictly 
on 
the 
statute 
of 
reference, 
in 
general 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
infer 
the 
k1-alethic 
value 
of 
a 
h 
from 
its 
k2-alethic 
value, 
unless 
k1 
and 
k2 
are 
linked 
by 
some 
implicative 
relation. 
With 
the 
aim 
of 
widening 
our 
theoretical 
perspective 
I 
propose 
the 
following 
TABLE 
3 


hh 


(8.xxviii) 
Tk° 
Tk°&k’ 
(8.xxix) 
Fk° 
Fk°&k’ 
(8.xxx) 
Uk° 
Tk°&k’¯Fk°&k’ 
¯Uk°&k’ 
(8.xxxi) 
Tkç&k’ 
~Fk 
(8.xxxii) 
Fk°&k’ 
~Tk° 
(8.xxxiii) 
Uk°&k’ 
Uk° 

where 
the 
alethic 
values 
of 
an 
h 
are 
referred 
to 
a 
basic 
statute 
k° 
and 
to 
a 
statute 
k=k°&k’ 
obtained 
by 


increasing 
k° 
with 
a 
cognition 
k’. 
Also 
the 
compilation 
of 
TABLE 
3 
does 
not 
need 
any 
integrative 
assumption, 
since 
et 
cetera. 
For 
instance 
(8.xxviii) 
ensues 
from 
the 
Theorem 
of 
Transitivity. 
In 
fact 
if 
Tk°(h), 
then 
by 
definition 
k°Éh 
, 
thence, 
as 
k°&k’Ék°. 
k°&k’Éh, 
that 
is 
Tk°&k’(h). 
Analogously 
for 


(8.xxix): 
if 
Fk°(h), 
then 
by 
definition 
k°É~h 
, 
thence, 
as 
k°&k’Ék°, 
k°&k’É~h, 
that 
is 
Fk°&k’(h) 
. 
Both 
(8.xxviii) 
and 
(8.xxix) 
are 
immediately 
evident 
in 
®. 
For 
instance, 
as 
for 
(8.xxviii), 
if 
the 
hatching 
involves 
no 
virgin 
sector 
of 
k°, 
it 
involves 
no 
virgin 
sector 
of 
k°&k’ 
whose 
shaded 
field 
is 
either 
the 
same 
(k’=Ø) 
or 
greater 
than 
k°. 
Analogously, 
as 
for 
(8.xxx) 
if 
the 
k°-diagram 
entails 
that 
the 
non-shaded 
sectors 
be 
partially 
hatched, 
the 
further 
k’-shading 
is 
compatible 
with 
three 
different 
situations 
et 
cetera. 


Not 
less 
immediate 
is 
the 
diagrammatic 
verification 
of 
(8.xxxi) 
(8.xxxii) 
and 
(8.xxxiii). 
The 
respective 
formal 
proofs 
are 
obtainable 
from 
the 
same 
line, 
here 
limited 
to 
(8.xxxi). 
Tkç&k’&Fk 
is 
contradictory 
because, 
owing 
to 
(8.xxix), 
Fk° 
implies 
Fk°&k’ 
which 
implies 
~Tk°&k’, 
therefore 
by 
Modus 
Tollens 
Tk°&k’ 
implies~Fk. 


8.15.1. 
TABLE 
3 
leads 
directly 
to 
the 
Theorem 
of 
Conservation. 
Incrementative 
acquirements 
of 
a 
statute 
do 
not 
alter 
the 
truth 
or 
falsity 
of 
a 
hypothesis. 
This 
theorem 
ensues 
directly 
from 
(8.xxviii) 
and 
(8.xxix) 
and 
constitutes 
a 
milestone 
for 
human 
knowledge. 
In 
fact 
it 
assures 
that, 
once 
an 
assumed 
statute 
leads 
to 
a 
conclusion 
about 
the 
alethic 
value 
of 
a 
hypothesis, 
such 
a 
conclusion 
continues 
holding 
under 
every 
increment 
of 
the 
assumed 
statute. 
Of 
course 
the 
circumstances 
where 
we 
must 
modify 
our 
previous 
conclusions 
about 
te 
alethic 
value 
of 
a 
hypothesis 
abound, 
yet 
they 
presuppose 
a 
correction 
of 
the 
statute, 
and 
any 
correction 
presupposes 
an 
ablation, 
therefore, 
first 
of 
all, 
a 
decrement. 
8.15.2. 
TABLE 
3 
concerns 
a 
single 
hypothesis. 
Its 
complete 
extrapolation 
to 
the 
case 
of 
two 
hypotheses 
would 
entail 
a 
too 
detailed 
tabulation. 
I 
simply 
emphasize 
that 
the 
task 
of 
compiling 
TABLE 
4 
as, 
for 
instance, 
h1 
h2 
h1&h2 


..... 
..... 
..... 


(8.xxxiv) 
Tk° 
Uk°&k’ 
Uk°&k’ 
.... 
.... 
.... 
is 
only 
a 
matter 
of 
patience. 
So 
(8.xxxiv), 
ruling 
the 
alethic 
value 
corresponding 
to 
the 
conjunction 
of 
a 
k°-true 
h1 
with 
a 
k°&k’-undecidable 
h2, 
is 
derivable 
as 
follows. 
If 
Tk°&k’(h1&h2),then 
Tk°&k’(h2) 
incompatible 
with 
the 
presupposition 
Uk°&k’(h2); 
therefore 


~(Tk°&k’(h1&h2)). 
If 
Fk°&k’(h1&h2), 
since 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
(8.xxviii) 
Tk°(h1)ÉTk°&k’(h1), 
then 
Fk°&k’(h2), 
incompatible 
with 
the 
presupposition 
Therefore 
But 
if 
and 
~(Fk

Uk°&k’(h2).~(Fk°&k’(h1&h2)).~(Tk°&k’(h1&h2)) 
°&k’(h1&h2)) 
then 
by 
definition 
Uk°&k’(h1&h2). 



8.15.3. 
Far 
from 
being 
a 
fault, 
the 
complexity 
of 
the 
paradigm 
is 
quite 
favourable 
evidence. 
In 
fact, 
since 
each 
line 
of 
the 
above 
tables 
refers 
to 
a 
punctual 
and 
distinct 
situation, 
any 
approach 
leading 
to 
a 
less 
articulate 
paradigm 
would 
only 
reveal 
its 
insufficiency. 
8.16. 
Two 
important 
theorems 
follow. 
Theorem 
of 
Restriction: 


(8.xxxv) 
Every 
k-restriction 
of 
a 
k-true 
piece 
of 
information 
is 
necessarily 
k-true 
(of 
course 
a 
k-restriction 
is 
a 
restriction 
valid 
in 
k), 
then 
(8.xxxv) 
is 
nothing 
but 
(8.x), 
that 
is 
the 
correct 


formulation 
of 
Modus 
Ponens). 
The 
formal 
proof 
of 
(8.xxxv) 
passes 
through 
the 
Theorem 
of 


Transitivity, 
yet 
it 
is 
immediately 
derivable 
from 
TABLE 
2 
since 
Tk(h1) 
and 
Tk(h2) 
is 
the 
only 


combination 
of 
values 
corresponding 
to 
Tk(h1&h2). 


Theorem 
of 
Expansion: 


(8.xxxvi) 
Every 
k-expansion 
of 
a 
k–false 
piece 
of 
information 
is 
necessarily 
k-false 
(of 
course 
a 
k-expansion 
is 
an 
expansion 
valid 
in 
k); 
(8.xxxvi) 
is 
immediately 
derivable 
from 
TABLE 
2 


since 
Fk(h1) 
or 
Fk(h2), 
are 
separately 
sufficient 
to 
imply 
Fk(h1&h2). 


Corollary: 


(8.xxxvii) 
No 
k-restriction 
of 
a 
k-undecidable 
piece 
of 
information 
can 
be 
k-false 
(otherwise 
we 
could 
exhibit 
a 
k-undecidable 
expansion 
of 
a 
k-false 
piece 
of 
information, 
so 
contradicting 
(8.xxxvi)) 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
(8.xxxv), 
(8.xxxvi) 
and 
(8.xxxvii) 
we 
can 
establish 
a 
sort 
of 
alethic 
hierarchy 
among 
truth 
(wherever 
recessive), 
undecidableness 
(truth-dominant 
but 
falsity-recessive) 
and 
falsity 
(wherever 
dominant). 


8.17. 
Summarising. 
Since 
the 
information 
we 
can 
infer 
from 
a 
certain 
acquirement 
depends 
also 
on 
the 
statute 
incremented 
by 
the 
same 
acquirement, 
the 
statute 
plays 
a 
fundamental 
role: 
therefore 
we 
must 
be 
aware 
of 
the 
necessity 
to 
inhibit 
any 
confusion 
among 
different 
statutes 
even 
where 
no 
explicit 
reference 
occurs. 
The 
puzzles 
affecting 
intentional 
identity 
contexts 
are 
born 
simply 
by 
a 
confusion 
among 
the 
plurality 
of 
statutes 
they 
involve 
(in 
Appendix 
to 
Chapter 
16 
we 
shall 
see 
that 
inhibiting 
any 
confusion 
is 
overcoming 
such 
puzzles). 
Recognizing 
a 
plurality 
of 
possible 
statutes, 
obviously, 
is 
perfectly 
compatible 
with 
the 
incontestable 
existence 
of 
a 
privileged 
one, 
that 
is, 
so 
to 
say, 
the 
final 
appeal 
statute 
concerning 
the 
real 
world 
we 
live 
in 
(Chapter 
13 
is 
specifically 
devoted 
to 
this 
topic). 
8.18. 
In 
Chapter 
9 
the 
well 
known 
distinction 
between 
oppositive 
and 
exclusive 
negation 
will 
be 
analyzed 
carefully. 
Here 
sortally 
incorrect 
propositions 
are 
neglected, 
and 
as 
such 
only 
oppositive 
negations 
are 
considered. 
Nevertheless 
an 
even 
more 
fundamental 
distinction 
concerning 
negations 
needs 
to 
be 
focalized. 

Let 
me 
reason 
directly 
on 
® 
and 
let 
me 
consider 
two 
complementary 
propositive 
diagrams 
(hatching 
on 
a 
virgin 
circle); 
in 
the 
former 
only 
the 
sector 
3 
is 
not 
hatched, 
in 
the 
latter 
only 
the 
sector 
3 
is 
hatched. 
Therefore 


(8.xxxviii) 
the 
slider 
is 
in 
sector 
3 
and 
respectively 


(8.xxxix) 
the 
slider 
is 
not 
in 
sector 
3 
are 
the 
sentences 
adducing 
the 
represented 
propositions 
h 
and~h. 


Now 
let 
me 
suppose 
that 
in 
the 
institutive 
diagram 
representing 
the 
statute 
of 
reference 
k 
(shading 
on 
a 


virgin 
circle) 
the 
sector 
3 
is 
shaded, 
so 
making 
(8.xxxviii) 
k-false 
and 
(8.xxxix) 
k-true. 
Of 
course 
we 
can 
state 
the 
result 
of 
the 
collation 
between 
hatched 
and 
shaded 
fields 
through 


(8.xxxx) 
*the 
slider 
is 
not 
in 
sector 
3* 
is 
k-true 
but 
in 
the 
usual 
practice, 
particularly 
where 
the 
statute 
of 
reference 
is 
unmistakable, 
(8.xxxx) 
is 


replaced 
by 
(8.xxxix), 
which 
then 
becomes 
an 
ambiguous 
message. 
In 
fact 
(I 
continue 
availing 
myself 
of 
Ò) 
given 
the 
representation 
of 
a 
hypothesis 
(for 
instance 
the 
diagram 
representing 
(8.xxxviii)) 
the 
“not” 
through 
which 
we 
mean 
its 
complementary 
diagram 
(that 
is 
the 
diagram 
representing 
(8.xxxix)), 
is 
the 
same 
“not” 
through 
which 
we 
mean 
the 
(anti-collative) 
result 
of 
the 
collation 
between 
the 
hypothesis 
and 
the 
statute. 
Thus 
we 
fall 
into 
a 
projective 
ambiguity 
(that 
is 
an 
ambiguity 
involving 
the 
dialinguistic 
order) 
because 
a 
hyperlinguistic 
statement 
as 
(8.xxxx) 
may 
be 
confused 
with 
a 
protolinguistic 
statement 
as 
(8.xxxix). 


The 
above 
(§8.9) 
critical 
approach 
to 
the 
current 
formulations 
of 
NC 
and 
TND 
is 
nothing 
but 
an 


application 
of 
the 
just 
proposed 
considerations. 
And 
actually 
this 
topic 
is 
strictly 
connected 
with 
the 
already 
denounced 
convention 
(§1.11.1): 
the 
worst 
symbolic 
convention 
… 
is 
the 
universal 
habit 
according 
to 
which 
affirmation 
is 
expressed 
by 
omitting 
the 
symbol 
of 
negation. 


8.19. 
Just 
as 
if 
Tk(h1) 
and 
Tk(h1Éh2) 
then 
Tk(h2)) 
symbolizes 
the 
Theorem 
of 
Restriction, 
if 
Fk(h1) 
and 
Tk(h2Éh1) 
then 
Fk(h2)) 
symbolizes 
the 
Theorem 
of 
Expansion. 
As 
for 
undecidable 
hypotheses 


(8.xxxxi) 
if 
Uk(h1) 
and 
Tk(h1Éh2 
) 
then 
~Fk(h2)) 
(in 
fact 
if 
Fk(h2) 
then 
since 
Tk(h1Éh2) 
by 
Theorem 
of 
Expansion 
Fk(h1), 
contrary 
to 
Uk(h1)) 
and 


(8.xxxxii) 
if 
Uk(h1) 
and 
Tk(h2Éh1 
) 
then 
~Tk(h2)) 
(in 
fact 
if 
Tk(h2) 
then 
since 
Tk(h2Éh1) 
by 
Theorem 
of 
Restriction 
Tk(h1), 
contrary 
to 
Uk(h1)); 
therefore 
(I 
recall 
that 
the 
identity 
between 
two 
pieces 
of 
information 
is 
a 
reciprocal 
implication, 
and 
as 
such 
it 
entails 
both 
of 
them) 



if 
Uk(h1) 
and 
Tk(h1=h2 
) 
then 
Uk(h2)) 
since 
both 
(8.xxxxi) 
and 
(8.xxxxii) 
hold. 


So, 
once 
assumed 


א 
“ ” as a variable on alethic values (*true*, *false*, *(un)decidable*), we can 


resume 
the 
above 
achievements 
in 


א 
k(h2)) 
א 
k(h1) and Tk(h1=h2) then 
if 


which 
tells 
us 
that 
the 
substitution 
of 
identity 
is 
an 
alethically 
conservative 
operation 
(rule 
of 
inference). 
In 
other 
words: 
contrary 
to 
Modus 
Ponens 
the 
substitution 
of 
identity 
does 
not 
maintain 
only 
the 
truth, 
but 
also 
the 
falsity 
and 
the 
(un)decidability. 



CHAPTER 
9 
MULTIVALENT 
LOGICS 


9.1. 
In 
this 
chapter 
I 
sketch 
a 
truth-functional 
tetravalent 
approach 
to 
multivalence. 
I 
speak 
of 
a 
sketch 
because 
the 
matter 
is 
vast. 
Subsequent 
chapters 
(in 
particular 
Chapter 
15 
on 
variables 
and 
Chapter 
16 
on 
indexicality) 
will 
better 
enlighten 
some 
here 
apodictic 
assumptions. 
Anyhow, 
in 
order 
to 
simplify 
all 
that 
can 
be 
simplified 
without 
adulterating 
the 
main 
discourse, 
I 
agree 
-to 
consider 
only 
propositions 
adduced 
by 
sentences 
of 
the 
atomic 
form 
subject-predicate; 
-to 
presuppose 
the 
semantic 
competence 
of 
the 
interpreter, 
who 
then 
can 
distinguish 
between 
sortally 
correct 
and 
sortally 
incorrect 
propositions. 
Furthermore, 
in 
order 
not 
to 
be 
charged 
with 
my 
own 
admission 
(Introduction: 
too 
many 
quotations? 
they 
are 
simply 
an 
awkward 
attempt 
to 
mask 
frightening 
cultural 
gaps) 
many 
quotations 
have 
been 
censored. 


9.2. 
The 
hard 
difficulties 
entailed 
by 
truth-functional 
approaches 
to 
trivalence 
induced 
many 
authors 
to 
abandon 
them; 
I 
claim 
that 
overcoming 
a 
basic 
inadequacy 
affecting 
the 
current 
trivalent 
logics 
is 
sufficient 
to 
overcoming 
such 
difficulties. 
First 
of 
all, 
let 
me 
distinguish 
between 
two 
families 
of 
trivalences, 
respectively 
called 
“cognitive” 
and 
“sortal”. 
9.2.1. 
The 
cognitive 
trivalence, 
via 
Lukasiewicz, 
ascends 
to 
Aristotle 
himself. 
It 
refers 
its 
third 
alethic 
value 
to 
some 
informational 
gap; 
while 
Kripke 
(1975, 
p.87) 
claims 
that 
the 
third 
alethic 
value 
may 
be 
interpreted 
as 
“possibility”, 
Kleene 
(1974, 
p.333) 
claims 
(more 
clearly, 
in 
my 
opinion) 
that 
it 
means 
only 
the 
absence 
of 
information. 
When 
we 
speak 
of 
bivalence 
or 
multivalences, 
we 
are 
speaking 
of 
alethic 
values 
(of 
their 
number); 
and 
any 
alethic 
value 
results 
from 
a 
collation. 
Now 
ascertaining 
the 
cognitive 
impossibility 
of 
concluding 
a 
collation 
with 
a 
pro-collation 
(truth) 
or 
with 
an 
anti-collation 
(falsity) 
is 
ascertaining 
the 
undecidability 
of 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
(proposition) 
under 
scrutiny 
(§8.4). 
Usually 
(§10.1) 
this 
undecidability 
depends 
on 
the 
poorness 
of 
the 
statute 
which, 
as 
such, 
does 
not 
allow 
the 
verification 
of 
the 
unambiguous 
proposition 
to 
collate; 
yet 
it 
may 
also 
depend 
on 
some 
ambiguity 
of 
the 
proposition 
under 


collation. 
In 
other 
words, 
the 
absence 
of 
information 
which 
usually 
affects 
the 
institutive 
stage, 
may 
affect 
the 
propositive 
stage. 
For 
instance, 
since 
we 
know 
that 
Ava 
is 
a 
silent 
but 
mentally 
troubled 
lady, 
the 
undecidability 
of 


Ava 
is 
quiet 


does 
not 
depend 
on 
our 
ignorance 
about 
Ava’s 
personality, 
but 
on 
the 
ambiguity 
of 
*quiet*. 
Nevertheless 
both 
an 
incompleteness 
of 
the 
statute 
or 
a 
fuzziness 
(Fine 
1975) 
of 
the 
proposition 
entail 
a 
lack 
of 
information, 
therefore 
they 
can 
be 
associated 
in 
a 
classification 
focused 
on 
the 
distinction 
between 
cognitive 
and 
sortal 
trivalences. 



9.2.2. 
The 
sortal 
trivalence 
refers 
its 
third 
alethic 
value 
to 
propositions 
vitiated 
by 
some 
semantic 
improperness. 
For 
instance 
while 
Martin 
(1968, 
p.325) 
writes 
there 
is 
a 
distinguishable 
class 
of 
odd 
sentences 
whose 
oddity 
results 
from 
a 
kind 
of 
category-incorrectness 
or 
non-fitting 
of 
subject 
and 
predicate, 
Thomason 
(1972, 
p 
209) 
calls 
“deviant” 
the 
sortally 
incorrect 
‘sentences’ 
(propositions) 
and 
writes: 
the 
deviation 
arises 
from 
the 
application 
of 
the 
predicate 
to 
something 
of 
the 
wrong 
sort. 
The 
point 
is 
clear. 


9.2.3. 
No 
reasonable 
confusion 
is 
possible 
between 
undecidability 
and 
improperness. 
The 
former 
needs 
more 
information, 
therefore 
it 
presupposes 
the 
sortal 
correctness, 
otherwise 
merely 
semantic 
considerations 
would 
be 
sufficient 
to 
refuse 
the 
proposition 
under 
scrutiny. 
At 
most 
we 
can 
remark 
that 
the 
criterion 
of 
interpretative 
collaboration 
(the 
principle 
of 
charity) 
induces 
us 
to 
privilege 
a 
proper 
reading 
wherever 
it 
is 
possible. 
9.3. 
The 
mentioned 
difficulties 
(§9.2) 
are 
well 
known. 
In 
fact 
(Thomason 
1972, 
p.229) 
intuition 
seems 
to 
pull 
in 
opposite 
directions: 
and 
the 
presence 
of 
incompatible 
alethic 
tables 
for 
the 
same 
connective, 
as 
for 
instance 
Kleene’s 
strong 
and 
weak 
ones 
(Kleene 
1974, 
p. 
334) 
is 
the 
direct 
consequence 
of 
such 
contradictory 
pulls. 
With 
an 
eye 
toward 
the 
examples 
below 
I 
agree 
that 


(9.i) 
Ava 
is 
married 
Ava 
is 
pleasant 
are 
true 
propositions, 


(9.ii) 
Ava 
is 
quiet 
Ava 
is 
unquiet 
are 
undecidable 
propositions, 


(9.iii) 
Ava 
is 
unmarried 
Ava 
is 
unpleasant 
are 
false 
propositions, 


(9.iv) 
Ava 
is 
demonstrable 
Ava 
is 
undemonstrable 
are 
improper 
propositions. 
Furthermore, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
concision, 
in 
the 
examples 
below 
pairs 
of 
conjoined 
propositions 
are 
reduced 
to 
pairs 
of 
conjoined 
predicates 
et 
cetera. 


9.4. 
First 
of 
all, 
I 
treat 
a 
strictly 
cognitive 
trivalence 
(where 
improper 
propositions 
are 
excluded).While 
AT1 
(where 
the 
current 
and 
more 
compact 
tabulation 
is 
adopted) 
AT1 
h1&h2| 
TUF 



T|TUF 
U|UUF 
F|FFF 


is 
the 
unproblematic 
table 
for 
the 
conjunction, 
AT2 
AT2 


h 
~h 
TF 
UU 
FT 


is 
the 
unproblematic 
table 
for 
the 
(oppositive) 
negation 
(symbolized 
by 
“~“).To 
avoid 
misundestandings, 
alethic 
tables, 
generally 
speaking, 
say 
that 
if 
certain 
basic 
propositions 
have 
certain 
alethic 
values 
(if 
the 
collation 
between 
certain 
basic 
propositions 
and 
the 
statute 
of 
reference 
gives 
certain 
results), 
then 
the 
proposition 
obtained 
by 
operating 
on 
the 
previous 
ones 
through 
the 
logical 
connection 
under 
scrutiny 
have 
a 
certain 
alethic 
value. 


So 
for 
instance 
the 
“F” 
occurring 
in 
the 
first 
column, 
third 
row 
of 
AT1 
says 
that 
where 


k&h1 
=^ 


and 


k&h2 
=k 


then 


k&h1&h2 
= 
^ 
. 


9.4.1. 
Both 
AT1 
and 
AT2 
are 
unproblematic 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
our 
intuition 
does 
not 
offer 
room 
for 
any 
tenable 
alternative 
in 
the 
assignation 
of 
their 
alethic 
values. 
For 
instance, 
under 
(9.iii) 
and 
(9.ii), 
(9.v) 
Ava 
is 
unmarried 
and 
quiet 
must 
be 
false, 
though 
we 
do 
not 
know 
whether 
Ava 
is 
actually 
quiet, 
because 
to 
know 
that 
she 
is 
not 
unmarried 
is 
sufficient 
to 
conclude 
that 
she 
is 
not 
unmarried-and-quiet. 
The 
same 
structure 
of 
AT1 
validates 
the 
already 
remarked 
hierarchy 
(§8.16) 
among 
alethic 
values: 
in 


cognitive 
trivalence 
the 
dominance 
scale 
for 
conjunction 
F>U>T 
complies 
with 
the 
standard 
interpretation 
according 
to 
which 
a 
conjunction 
takes 
the 
value 
of 
the 
‘least 
true’ 
conjunct. 


9.4.2. 
Of 
course 
AT1 
and 
AT2 
allow 
the 
compilation 
of 
the 
alethic 
table 
for 
whatever 
propositional 
connective 
in 
cognitive 
trivalence. 
In 
particular 
AT3 
AT3 


h1Ú 
h2| 
TUF 
T|TTT 
U|TUU 
F|TUF 



is 
the 
alethic 
table 
for 
the 
inclusive 
disjunction 
(in 
cognitive 
trivalence). 
A 
passage 
to 
emphasize 
is 
that 
though 
AT3 
has 
been 
obtained 
by 
a 
mechanical 
(a 
dull?) 
application 
of 
AT1 
and 
AT2 
to 


(9.vi) 
not(not 
... 
and 
not 
...) 
(that 
is 
to 
the 
canonical 
definition 
of 
inclusive 
disjunction), 
the 
same 
AT3 
can 
also 
be 
obtained 
through 
the 
merely 
intuitive 
way 
telling 
us 
that 
an 
inclusive 
disjunction 
takes 
the 
value 
of 
its 
‘most 
true’ 
disjunct. 
So, 
under 
(9.iii) 
and 
(9.ii) 


(9.vii) 
Ava 
is 
unmarried 
or 
quiet 
must 
be 
undecidable; 
and 
really, 
since, 
contrary 
to 
(9.v), 
if 
Ava 
were 
quiet 
(9.vii) 
would 
be 
true 
but 
if 
Ava 
were 
unquiet 
(9.vii) 
would 
be 
false, 
not 
knowing 
whether 
Ava 
is 
quiet 
or 
unquiet 
is 
not 
knowing 
whether 
(9.vii) 
is 
true 
or 
false. 
Just 
because 
in 
this 
context 
truth 
prevails 
over 
undecidability 
and 
undecidability 
prevails 
over 
falsity, 


we 
can 
say 
that 
the 
dominance 
scale 
for 
inclusive 
disjunction 
in 
cognitive 
trivalence 
is 
T>U>F. 


9.5. 
A 
strictly 
sortal 
trivalence 
(where 
no 
cognitional 
gaps 
are 
admitted) 
requires 
a 
much 
more 
meticulous 
analysis. 
The 
logic 
of 
improperness, 
at 
least 
from 
the 
social 
viewpoint, 
is 
a 
risky 
matter; 
if 
we 
insist 
on 
submitting 
improper 
propositions 
to 
our 
honourable 
neighbours, 
their 
probable 
reaction 
is 
not 
to 
debate 
our 
sortal 
theory, 
but 
to 
assure 
us 
we 
are 
absolutely 
right 
and 
to 
disappear 
forever. 
This 
notwithstanding, 
until 
we 
deal 
with 
conjunctions, 
no 
problem 
arises. 
In 
fact 
AT4 
AT4 


h1&h2| 
TFI 
T|TFI 
F|FFI 
I|III 


complies 
perfectly 
with 
our 
intuition. 
For 
instance, 
under 
(9.i) 
and 
(9.iv), 


(9.viii) 
Ava 
is 
married 
and 
demonstrable 
is 
manifestly 
improper 
(T&I=I, 
concisely 
written) 
because 
under 
(9.iv) 
no 
married-and-demonstrable 


lady 
can 
exist. 
The 
only 
(and 
quite 
superficial) 
perplexity 
might 
concern 
F&I=I. 
Why 
not 
F&I=F?. 
The 
answer 
is 
easy. 
If 


Ava 
is 
unmarried-and-demonstrable 


were 
false, 
its 
(oppositive) 
negation 
ought 
to 
be 
true; 
then, 
as 


Ava 
is 
not 
unmarried-and-demonstrable 



is 


(9.ix) 
Ava 
is 
unmarried-and-undemonstrable, 
or 
married-and-demonstrable, 
or 
married-andundemonstrable 
the 
same 
(9.ix) 
ought 
to 
be 
true: 
is 
it? 
I 
read 
(9.ix) 
as 
a 
manifestly 
improper 
proposition. 
Another 
argument 
supporting 
F&I=I 
runs 
as 
follows. 
In 
general, 
while 
a 
false 
proposition 
like 
for 
instance 


371293 
is 
prime 
is 
refused 
on 
the 
grounds 
of 
a 
verification, 
a 
sortally 
incorrect 
proposition 
like 
for 
instance 
371293 
is 
vegetarian 
is 
refused 
only 
on 
the 
grounds 
of 
semantic 
considerations; 
therefore, 
since 
a 
proposition 
like 
2599051 
is 
prime-and-vegetarian 
does 
not 
need 
any 
verification 
in 
order 
to 
be 
refused 
(that 
is; 
since 
the 
arithmetical 
characteristics 
of 


2599051 
are 
of 
no 
moment) 
the 
proposition 
is 
improper. 
So, 
as 
our 
intuition 
does 
not 
offer 
room 
for 
any 
tenable 
alternative 
in 
the 
assignation 
of 
alethic 
values, 
AT4 
is 
the 
unproblematic 
table 
for 
conjunction 
in 
sortal 
trivalence. 


9.5.1. 
The 
ticklish 
problem 
concerns 
the 
table 
for 
negation(s). 
In 
order 
to 
argue 
in 
the 
ordinary 
language 
about 
this 
matter 
we 
have 
to 
fix 
an 
informal 
reading 
for 
exclusive 
negation; 
thus 
I 
propose 
to 
read 
the 
exclusive 
negation 
of 
“Pa” 
as 
“a 
cannot 
at 
all 
be 
P” 
so 
making 
“cannot 
at 
all 
be” 
a 
declaration 
of 
improperness. 


Denying 
a 
proposition 
is 
rejecting 
its 
truth. 
Therefore, 
until 
the 
denied 
proposition 
is 
proper, 
denying 
it 
is 
affirming 
the 
truth 
of 
its 
opposite; 
but 
if 
the 
denied 
proposition 
is 
improper, 
its 
opposite 
too 
is 
improper, 
and 
no 
improper 
proposition 
can 
be 
true. 
So 
for 
instance, 


(9.x) 
Ava 
is 
not 
unmarried 
and 
Ava 
is 
married 
are 
equivalent, 
but 
(9.xi) 
Ava 
is 
not 
undemonstrable 

and 


(9.xii) 
Ava 
is 
demonstrable 
are 
far 
from 
being 
equivalent: 
in 
fact 
while 
(9.xii) 
is 
surely 
improper, 
in 
(9.xi) 
the 
exclusive 
reading 
of 
“is 
not” 
(that 
is 
the 
reading 
making 
it 
a 
synonym 
of 
“cannot 
at 
all 
be”), 
makes 
true 
the 
same 
(9.xi). 
But 
just 
because 
both 
in 
(9.x) 
and 
in 
(9.xi) 
the 
denials 
are 
performed 
by 
a 
“not”, 
as 
soon 
as 
improper 
propositions 
are 
admitted, 
either 
we 
accept 
“~” 
as 
an 
intrinsically 
ambiguous 
symbol, 
or 
we 
must 
introduce 
a 
second 
symbol 
(“¬”, 
say) 
for 
exclusive 
negations. 
The 
decision 
is 
obvious: 
ambiguity 
is 
the 
worst 
enemy 
of 
logic. 


Unfortunately 
there 
is 
so 
faint 
a 
consent 
about 
what 
exactly 
an 
exclusive 
negation 
is, 
that 
some 
authors 
refuse 
tout 
court 
its 
right 
to 
exist. 
In 
this 
sense 
establishing 
the 
respective 
alethics 
might 
reveal 
itself 
a 
rather 
questionable 
task. 
For 
instance 
someone 
could 
claim 
that 
only 
improper 
propositions 
can 
be 
denied 
exclusively 
or 
that 
the 
exclusive 
negation 
of 
a 
proper 
proposition 
is 
equivalent 
to 
its 
oppositive 
negation 
and 
so 
on. 
These 
different 
opinions 
more 
that 
symptoms 
of 
a 
puzzling 
situation, 
are 
choices 
born 
just 
by 
the 
mentioned 
vagueness 
of 
*exclusive 
negation*. 
Is 
there 
some 
puzzle 
regarding 
Ava’s 
quietness, 
or 
simply 
the 
necessity 
to 
achieve 
a 
better 
(heuristic) 
definition 
of 
*quiet*? 
My 
claim 
is 
that 
in 
sortal 
trivalence 
oppositive 
and 
exclusive 
negations 
are 
ruled 
by 
AT5 



AT5 


h 
~h 
¬h 
TFF 
FTF 
IIT 


where 
the 
only 
debatable 
assignations 
concern 
the 
third 
column 
(concisely 
written, 
~ 
T=F 
and 
~ 
F=T 


follow 
directly 
from 
AT2 
and 
~I=I 
is 
banal). 
First 
of 
all 
I 
emphasize 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
define 
“¬” 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
primitive 
“& 
” 
and 
“~”. 
The 
simplest 
way 
to 
ascertain 
this 
impossibility 
is 
to 
scrutinize 
the 
last 
rows 
of 
AT4 
and 
AT5. 
Since 
in 
AT4 


“I” 
is 
dominant 
and 
in 
AT5 
~I=I 
no 
combination 
of 
conjunctions 
and 
oppositive 
negations 
can 
lead 
to 


a 
result 
different 
from 
I; 
on 
the 
contrary 
in 
AT5 
¬I 
= 
T. 
Such 
an 
assignation 
follows 
directly 
from 
the 
same 
notion 
of 
exclusive 
negation 
(it 
is 
true 
that 
Ava 
cannot 
at 
all 
be 
demonstrable). 
On 
the 
contrary 
¬T=F 
and 
¬F=F 
are 
intuitively 
supported 
by 
the 
evidence 
that, 
as 
*improper* 
is 
exactly 
the 
opposite 


of 
*proper*, 
the 
exclusive 
negation 
of 
a 
proper 
proposition 
is 
false 
(not 
improper); 
for 
instance, 
stating 
that 
Ava 
cannot 
at 
all 
be 
(un)married 
is 
false, 
not 
improper. 


9.6. 
The 
basic 
idea 
of 
a 
tetravalent 
approach 
to 
trivalence 
is 
simple: 
since 
proper 
and 
improper 
statements 
can 
be 
freely 
conjoined 
(as 
for 
instance 
in 
(9.viii)) 
and 
since 
both 
proper 
and 
improper 
statements 
can 
be 
oppositively 
or 
exclusively 
denied, 
the 
two 
proposed 
theorizations 
can 
be 
unified 
through 
a 
table 
for 
conjunction 
and 
a 
table 
for 
negations 
where 
both 
U 
and 
I 
occur. 
The 
task 
is 
unequivocally 
accomplished 
on 
the 
only 
grounds 
of 
the 
above 
tables, 
that 
is 
on 
the 
only 
grounds 
of 
the 
different 
rank 
U 
and 
I 
have 
in 
the 
respective 
hierarchies. 
While 
AT1 
tells 
us 
that 
in 
conjunction 
U, 
so 


to 
say, 
is 
F-recessive, 
AT4 
tells 
us 
that 
F 
is 
I-recessive. 


In 
other 
words. 
The 
tetravalent 
approach 
follows 
from 
a 
paradigm 
according 
to 
which 
a 
proposition 
is 


(9.xiii) 
-either 
P 
(proper, 
sortally 
correct) 
or 
I 
(improper, 
sortally 
incorrect) 
-whether 
proper, 
either 
D 
(decidable) 
or 
U 
(undecidable) 


-whether 
decidable 
(therefore 
proper), 
either 
T 
(true) 
or 
F 
(false). 


Of 
course 
(9.xiii) 
is 
not 
the 
only 
possible 
paradigm. 
In 
my 
opinion 
it 
is 
the 
best 
one 
yet, 
in 
order 
not 
to 
be 
involved 
in 
superfluous 
quarrels, 
I 
simply 
claim 
that 
it 
is 
the 
reasonable 
paradigm 
here 
followed. 


So 
AT6 


h1&h2| 
TUFI 
T|TUFI 
U|UUFI 
F|FFFI 
I|IIII 


and 
AT7 



h 
~h 
¬h 
TFF 
UUF 
FTF 
IIT 


are 
the 
tetravalent 
alethic 
tables 
for 
conjunction 
and 
negations. 
Let 
me 
emphasize 
that 
no 
arbitrary 
intervention 
affects 
the 
editing 
of 
AT6 
and 
AT7 
(¬U=F 
, 
follows 
from 
the 
same 
consideration 
leading 


to 
¬T=F 
and 
¬F=F: 
for 
instance, 
quite 
independently 
of 
the 
undecidability 
of 
Ava’s 
(un)quietness, 
to 
state 
that 
Ava 
cannot 
at 
all 
be 
quiet 
is 
false). 


9.6.1. 
Realizing 
the 
different 
rank 
of 
U 
and 
I 
is 
understanding 
the 
root 
of 
the 
puzzles 
affecting 
the 
usual 
approaches 
to 
trivalence: 
if 
we 
pretend 
to 
identify 
U 
and 
I 
in 
one 
only 
value 
(the 
value 
expressed 
by 
Thomason’s 
asterisk, 
say) 
we 
introduce 
an 
incurable 
conflict 
of 
dominance. 
This 
passage 
may 
be 
even 
more 
evident 
in 
AT8

h1Úh2 
| 
T 
U 
F 
I 
T|TTTT 
U|TUUU 
F|TUFF 
I|TUFI 


that 
is 
in 
the 
table 
for 
inclusive 
disjunction 
where 
(obviously 
because 
of 
its 
duality 
with 
conjunction) 
the 
aforementioned 
I>F>U>T 
becomes 
T>U>F>I. 


9.6.1.1. 
Indeed 
AT8 
has 
been 
compiled 
by 
a 
(dull) 
application 
of 
the 
previous 
tables 
to 
the 
canonical 
scheme 
(9.xiv) 
~ 
(~...&~...) 
yet 
its 
values 
could 
also 
be 
obtained 
by 
the 
intuitive 
suggestion, 
evidence 
showing 
that 
such 
compilation 
is 
not 
affected 
by 
any 
puzzling 
situation. 
9.7. 
From 
AT6 
and 
AT7 
we 
can 
derive 
any 
other 
connective. 
The 
set 
of 
combinatory 
connections, 
owing 
to 
the 
presence 
of 
two 
different 
primitive 
symbols 
for 
negation, 
is 
very 
numerous. 
For 
instance 
the 
scheme 
not 
(not 
h’ 
and 
not 
h”) 


bears 
eight 
different 
symbolizations 
((9.xiv) 
is 
nothing 
but 
one 
of 
them, 
precisely 
that 
where 
the 
three 
“not”s 
are 
read 
as 
oppositive 
negations). 
The 
sake 
of 
frankness 
compels 
me 
to 
confess 
that 
I 
have 
analyzed 
only 
a 
little 
fragment 
of 
the 
whole 
set; 
what 
I 
can 
assure 
is 
that, 
as 
far 
as 
I 
verified 
it, 
the 
suggestions 
of 
our 
intuition 
are 
satisfied 
by 
the 


values 
resulting 
from 
the 
(dull?) 
application 
of 
AT6 
and 
AT7. 
In 
order 
to 
show 
that 
the 
very 
reason 
why 
our 
intuition 
seems 
sometimes 
to 
pull 
in 
opposite 
directions 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
ambiguity 
of 
the 
problem 
under 
scrutiny 
I 
dwell 
on 
a 
specific 
scheme. 


9.8. 
The 
scheme 
concerns 
the 
propositional 
connective 

(9.xv) 
if 
h’ 
then 
h” 
that 
is 
the 
connective 
which 
in 
the 
truth 
functional 
approach 
to 
conditionals 
corresponds 
to 
(9.xvi) 
not(h’ 
and 
not 
h”) 
(I 
remind 
the 
reader 
that 
a 
systematic 
theorization 
of 
conditionals, 
that 
is 
a 
wider 
approach 
to 
(9.xv), 
will 
be 
proposed 
in 
Chapter 
14). 
The 
scheme 
is 
here 
applied 
to 
some 
contingent 
examples.

In 
conclusion, 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
free 
the 
truth 
functional 
approach 
from 
abusive 
assumptions 
and 
undue 
restrictions, 
tetravalence, 
besides 
avoiding 
any 
puzzle, 
opens 
wider 
horizons 
to 
our 
intuition. 

CHAPTER 
10 


ASSIGNATION 


10.1. 
In 
this 
chapter 
I 
face 
the 
problem 
concerning 
the 
assignation 
of 
the 
respective 
measures 
to 
the 
alternatives 
partitioning 
a 
possibility 
space 
(assignation 
problem). 
Even 
once 
agreed 
that 
henceforth 
sortal 
trivalence 
is 
abandoned, 
so 
that 
the 
third 
alethic 
value 
depends 
exclusively 
on 
a 
lack 
of 
information 
about 
proper 
propositions, 
and 
even 
once 
agreed 
that 
such 
a 
lack 
of 
information 
depends 
exclusively 
on 
the 
institutive 
stage 
(Chapter 
9, 
§2.1), 
a 
momentous 
ambiguity 
survives 
because, 
so 
to 
say, 
a 
statute 
can 
be 
affected 
by 
at 
least 
two 
kinds 
of 
informational 


lacks 
entailing 
different 
consequences 
on 
the 
undecidability 
of 
the 
hypothesis 
h 
to 
collate. 
In 
fact 


sometimes 
h 
is 
probabilistically 
valuable 
and 
sometimes 
it 
is 
not. 
In 
other 
words, 
while 
it 
is 
reasonable 
to 
classify 
all 
the 
dilemmas 
whose 
two 
horns 
are 
true 
and 
false 
as 
(alethically) 
decidable, 
to 
classify 
as 
undecidable 
all 
the 
dilemmas 
which 
are 
not 
decidable 
entails 
(at 
least) 
a 
missing 
distinction 
between 
probabilistically 
valuable 
and 
probabilistically 
unvaluable 
dilemmas. 


Let 
me 
enter 
into 
details. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
simplicity 
I 
will 
mainly 
reason 
through 
® 
on 
Ω°. 


10.2. 
In 
® 
the 
assignation 
problem 
is 
the 
problem 
of 
quantifying 
the 
areas 
of 
the 
sectors 
involved 
by 
such 
fields, 
that 
is 
the 
problem 
of 
establishing 
the 
number 
and 
the 
position 
of 
the 
radii 
separating 
the 
various 
sectors. 
For 
instance, 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
aforementioned 
slider 
on 
the 
rail, 
if 
the 
assignation 
is 
uniform 
(k1 
assigns 
the 
same 
measure 
to 
the 
eight 
alternatives) 
we 
obtain 
Figure 
10.1 
(reproducing 


Figure 
6.1) 
exactly 
as 
we 
obtain 
Figure 
10.2 
(reproducing 
Figure 
6.2) 
if 
the 
measure 
k2 
assigns 
to 
alternatives 
1 
and 
2 
is 
the 
double 
of 
the 
measure 
assigned 
to 
alternatives 
3, 
4, 
5, 
6 
and 
the 
quadruple 
of 
the 
measure 
assigned 
to 
alternatives 
7 
and 
8. 



Anyhow 
a 
statute 
may 
also 
concern 
only 
a 
part 
of 
the 
tract. 
For 
instance 
(Figure 
10.3) 



while 
the 
represented 
statute 
k3 
tells 
us 
that 
the 
first 
half 
of 
the 
tract 
is 
uniformly 
tetra-partitioned 
and 
that 
the 
slider 
is 
not 
in 
its 
first 
quarter, 
it 
does 
not 
tell 
us 
anything 
about 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
same 
tract. 
Under 
this 
k3, 
while 
h1 


(10.i) 
the 
slider 
is 
in 
segment 
1 
is 
a 
decidable 
(and 
false) 
hypothesis, 
both 
h2 


(10.ii) 
the 
slider 
is 
in 
segment 
3 
and 
h3 


(10.iii) 
the 
slider 
is 
in 
segment 
5 
are 
undecidable. 
Yet 
a 
momentous 
difference 
exists 
between 
(10.ii) 
and 
(10.iii): 
in 
fact 
we 
can 
assign 
a 
probabilistic 
value 
(1/8, 
obviously) 
to 
the 
former, 
but 
not 
to 
the 
latter. 
The 
probability 
(under 
k) 
of 
a 
h 


is 
the 
ratio 
between 
the 
k-measure 
of 
h 
and 
the 
k-measure 
of 
the 
same 
k, 
therefore 
it 
is 
represented 
by 
the 
ratio 
between 
the 
respective 
virgin 
fields. 
So 
the 
impossibility 
to 
draw 
the 
second 
radium 
delimitating 
sector 
5 
(whose 
positions 
we 
do 
not 
know) 
forbids 
the 
identification 
of 
the 
respective 
measure. 
An 
even 
more 
undecidable 
hypothesis 
is 


(10.iv) 
the 
slider 
is 
in 
segment 
7 
for 
the 
same 
existence 
of 
a 
segment 
7 
is 
unknown. 


10.3. 
In 
this 
sense 
a 
refinement 
of 
the 
classification 
proposed 
in 
§8.4 
is 
needed. 
In 
accordance 
with 
it, 
a 
h-incomplete 
statute 
is 
either 
h-adequate 
(if 
it 
allows 
the 
assignation 
of 
P(h|k)) 
or 
h-
defective. 
Reciprocally 
a 
k-undecidable 
hypothesis 
h 
is 
either 
k-valuable 
(for 
instance 
(10.ii)) 
or 
kunvaluable 
(for 
instance 
(10.iii)). 


A 
statute 
is 
absolutely 
adequate 
iff 
it 
is 
h-adequate 
for 
every 
h 
concerning 
its 
possibility 
space; 
an 
absolutely 
adequate 
statute 
is 
represented 
by 
a 
totally 
partitioned 
circle. 
Reciprocally 
a 
circle 
whose 
partition 
is 
totally 
unknown 
represents 
an 
absolutely 
defective 
(or 
empty) 
statute. 
For 
instance 
Figure 



10.1 
and 
10.2 
represent 
two 
absolutely 
adequate 
statutes. 
Instead 
the 
statute 
k3 
represented 
in 
Figure 
10.3 
is 
h1-exhaustive, 
h2-adequate, 
and 
h3-defective, 
so 
showing 
that 
the 
same 
statute 
may 
be 
exhaustive, 
adequate 
and 
defective 
in 
dependence 
of 
the 
hypothesis 
under 
scrutiny. 
Of 
course 
an 
absolutely 
exhaustive 
statute 
is 
represented 
by 
a 
circle 
whose 
sectors 
but 
one 
are 
shaded, 
that 
is, 
under 
the 
re-partitioning 
technique, 
by 
a 
circle 
which 
is 
also 
its 
only 
sector. 


10.4. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
pedantry 
I 
remark 
that 
the 
same 
notion 
of 
h-adequateness 
could 
be 
ulteriorly 
refined 
by 
the 
distinction 
opposing 
strong 
and 
weak 
h-adequate 
statutes. 
Let 
me 
sketch 
such 
an 
opposition 
through 
an 
extremely 
simple 
pair 
of 
connected 
examples. 


Example 
I. 
Under 
the 
following 
statute 
k1 


a) 
in 
an 
urn 
m 
there 
are 
two 
counters 
(m=m2) 
b) 
one 
counter 
is 
blue 
and 
one 
is 
red 
((m=m1+1 
) 
c) 
the 
other 
physical 
characteristics 
of 
the 
counters 
(size, 
material, 
shape 
et 
cetera) 
are 
exactly 
equal 
d) 
the 
withdrawing 
mechanism 
is 
chromatically 
impartial 
(no 
privileging 
photoelectric 
apparatus) 
the 
theoretic 
probability 
of 
withdrawing 
a 
blue 
counter 
is 


P(B| 
k1) 
= 
1/2 
and 
the 
frequency 
we 
can 
empirically 
realize 
is 
1/2 
too. 
In 
order 
to 
express 
this 
identity 
we 
could 
say 
that 
k1 
is 
strongly 
adequate 
as 
for 
the 
mentioned 
hypothesis. 
Example 
II. 
A 
third 
equal 
counter 
is 
inserted 
(blue? 
red? 
We 
only 
know 
that 
no 
colour 
is 
privileged). 
Under 
this 
new 
statute 
k2 
the 
theoretic 
probability 
of 
withdrawing 
a 
blue 
counter 
is 


P(B|k2) 
= 
2/3(1/2)+1/3(1/2) 
therefore 
it 
is 
again 
1/2. 
Yet 
the 
limit 
value 
of 
the 
frequency 
we 
can 
empirically 
realize 
will 
be 
either 
2/3 
(if 
m=m2+1) 
or 
1/3 
(if 
m=m1+2) 
surely 
not 
1/2. 
In 
order 
to 
express 
this 
non-identity 
between 


theoretic 
probability 
and 
frequency 
we 
could 
say 
that 
k2 
is 
weakly 
adequate 
as 
for 
the 
mentioned 
hypothesis 
II. 


I 
do 
not 
dwell 
on 
this 
rather 
marginal 
topic. 
Simply 
I 
remark 
that 
the 
reason 
of 
the 
discrepancy 


is 
that 
the 
Example 
II 
refers 
to 
a 
second 
order 
probabilistic 
problem, 
that 
is 
to 
a 
context 
where 
the 
probabilistic 
value 
is 
grounded 
on 
data 
which 
are 
in 
their 
turn 
grounded 
on 
probabilistic 
data. 
This 
means 
that 
in 
Ò 
the 
weakly 
adequate 
(the 
second 
order) 
partition 
of 
the 
circle 
does 
not 
correspond 
to 
any 
composition 
of 
the 
urn; 
in 
fact, 
since 
we 
ignore 
its 
real 
composition, 
so 
to 
say, 
such 
a 
second 
order 
partition 
results 
from 
a 
pondered 
valuation 
of 
the 
two 
first 
order 
partitions 
(I 
mean 
(m=m2+1) 
¯ 


(m=m1+2)), 
each 
of 
them 
representing 
a 
strongly 
adequate 
statute 
(no 
doubt 
that 
if 
we 
compose 
109 


urns 
under 
k2, 
the 
number 
of 
m2+1 
tends 
to 
109/2). 


Henceforth 
I 
will 
only 
speak 
of 
adequate 
statutes, 
leaving 
out 
of 
consideration 
the 
distinction 
between 
strong 
and 
weak 
adequateness. 



10.5. 
The 
considerations 
above 
do 
not 
involve 
the 
theme 
concerning 
any 
eventual 
subjective 
intervention 
in 
the 
assumption 
of 
a 
statute 
Here 
I 
tackle 
it. 
Once 
fixed 
the 
hypothesis 
h 
under 
scrutiny, 
the 
promotion 
of 
an 
h-defective 
statute 
to 
h-

adequateness 
or 
of 
an 
h-adequate 
statute 
to 
h-exhaustiveness 
is 
realized 
by 
acquiring 
new 
pieces 
of 
information 
improving 
the 
same 
statute. 
Since 
the 
procedure 
is 
the 
same, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
concision 
I 
will 
only 
treat 
the 
former 
case. 
Actually 
in 
every 
moment 
of 
our 
life 
we 
need 
to 
take 
decisions 
about 
undecidable 
hypotheses; 
in 
fact 
they 
concern 
possibility 
spaces 
whose 
complexity 
is 
too 
high 
to 
be 
analytically 
framed 
and 
whose 
context 
does 
not 
allow 
the 
acquirement 
of 
sure 
data 
able 
to 
promote 
the 
previously 
defective 
statute 
we 
are 
dealing 
with. 
Therefore, 
in 
order 
to 
take 
such 
decisions, 
we 
must 
resort 
to 
some 
vague 
and 
personal 
estimates. 
A 
classical 
example 
is 
the 
bookmaker 
who 
rates 
the 
next 
match; 
of 
course 
such 
rates 
are 
inversely 
proportional 
to 
his 
opinion 
about 
the 
respective 
chances, 
but 
evidently 
any 
mathematically 
quantifiable 
(therefore 
objective) 
analysis 
of 
the 
thousand 
factors 
influencing 
these 
chances 
(influencing 
this 
assignation 
of 
measures) 
is 
beyond 
his 
cognitive 
possibilities. 
In 
this 
sense 
I 
speak 
of 
a 
subjective 
intervention. 
Yet 
the 
subjectivism 
I 
am 
speaking 
of, 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
fundamentalist 
subjectivism 
in 
the 
style 
of 
de 
Finetti, 
is 
a 
critical 
and 
integrative 
subjectivism. 
It 
is 
critical 
because 
the 
subjective 
intervention 
is 
not 
arbitrary 
in 
the 
broad 
sense 
that 
everyone 
is 
free 
to 
assign 
the 
measures 
he 
prefers; 
these 
measures 
have 
to 
comply 
with 
a 
sensible 
estimate 
of 
the 
situation, 
and 
such 
an 
estimate 
must 
be 
strictly 
inferred 
from 
the 
contingent 
physical 
context 
of 
the 
phenomenon 
under 
scrutiny 
(bookmakers 
who 
were 
to 
pay 
a 
high 
rate 
for 
a 
nearly 
sure 
winner 
would 
be 
condemned 
to 
a 
prompt 
extinction). 
It 
is 
integrative 
because, 
though 
critical, 
the 
subjective 
intervention 
is 
legitimate 
exclusively 
where 
an 
insufficient 
knowledge 
of 
the 
same 
context 
makes 
a 
personal 
assignation 
the 
only 


reasonable 
alternative 
to 
a 
sterile 
suspension 
of 
any 
judgement 
(the 
classical 
epoch). 
Even 
a 
scale 
of 
subjectivity 
could 
be 
proposed 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
ratio 
between 
objective 
and 
subjective 
components 
in 
the 
statute 
on 
whose 
basis 
the 
assignation 
is 
achieved. 


Two 
comments 
are 
opportune. 


10.5.1. 
Under 
my 
severely 
deterministic 
approach 
(but 
are 
there 
deterministic 
approaches 
which 
are 
not 
severely 
deterministic?) 
*probability* 
and 
*ideal 
knower* 
are 
almost 
incompatible 
notions, 
because 
they 
lead 
to 
an 
apparent 
contradiction. 
On 
the 
one 
hand, 
for 
an 
ig 
whatever 
hypothesis 
is 
either 
true 
or 
false, 
therefore 
there 
is 
no 
room 
for 
any 
properly 
probabilistic 
approach. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
for 
instance, 
stating 
that, 
when 
we 
toss 
a 
(well 
balanced) 
die, 
the 
probability 
of 
a 
certain 
result 
is 
1/6 
is 
stating 
an 
exact 
and 
unobjectionable 
truth. 


No 
contradiction: 
ig 
knows 
the 
next 
result 
because 
he 
(she?), 
knowing 
the 
specific 
values 
of 
the 
parametric 
quantities, 
knows 
such 
a 
specific 
rototranslatory 
run 
of 
the 
die 
et 
cetera; 
but 
if 
we 
make 
reference 
to 
a 
generic 
toss 
we 
leave 
institutionally 
out 
of 
consideration 
the 
specific 
parameters 
characterizing 
any 
specific 
toss, 
therefore 
we 
introduce, 
so 
to 
say, 
an 
institutional 
lack 
of 
information 


subjecting 
even 
ig. 
In 
this 
sense 
the 
range 
of 
probabilistic 
values 
has 
an 
absolutely 
objective 
import. 
In 
other 
words. 
The 
value 
of 
1/6 
expresses 
the 
unobjectionable 
fact 
that 
1/6 
is 
exactly 
the 
value 
a 
correctly 
performed 
frequency 
(henceforth, 
a 
reliable 
frequency 
or 
even, 
shortly, 
a 
frequency) 
tends 
to. 


10.5.2. 
Carnap 
(and 
followers) 
claim 
that 
the 
frequency 
is 
a 
second 
kind 
of 
probability. 
In 
my 
opinion 
a 
frequency 
is 
simply 
the 
empirical 
way 
to 
reach 
a 
certain 
result, 
exactly 
as 
the 
time 
necessary 
to 
fill 
this 
tub 
by 
this 
water-tap 
can 
be 
experimentally 
ascertained 
even 
when 
the 
strange 
shape 
of 
the 
tub 
or 
the 
sobbing 
flow 
from 
the 
water-tap 
renders 
very 
hard 
any 
mathematic 
computation. 
Analogously, 
where 
both 
a 
theoretical 
assignation 
and 
a 
reliable 
frequency 
are 
realizable, 
the 
latter 
can 
control 
the 
former 
(either 
validating 
or 
invalidating 
it), 
and 
where 
no 
theoretical 
assignation 
is 
possible, 
the 
reliable 
frequency 
supplies 
an 
otherwise 
unachievable 
datum. 

Of 
course 
an 
invalidating 
reliable 
frequency 
(a 
discrepancy 
between 
empirical 
and 
theoretical 


assignations), 
once 
excluded 
a 
too 
hasty 
conclusion 
suggested 
by 
some 
strange 
contingent 
peculiarity 
(as 
for 
instance 
the 
famous 
21 
consecutive 
rouge 
in 
Montecarlo) 
is 
an 
unobjectionable 
symptom 
of 
some 
mistake 
in 
the 
theoretical 
approach, 
that 
is 
of 
some 
mistake 
affecting 
the 
objective 
computation 
or 
(inclusive) 
the 
subjective 
intervention; 
thus 
the 
non-arbitrariness 
of 
the 
same 
subjective 
intervention 
is 
argued. 


10.6. 
My 
basic 
claim 
is 
that 
the 
assignation 
of 
a 
measure 
to 
the 
various 
alternatives 
concerning 
a 
possibility 
space 
(that 
is 
a 
partition 
of 
the 
circle) 
is 
dictated 
by 
our 
knowledge 
of 
the 
physical 
phenomenon 
the 
same 
possibility 
space 
refers 
to. 
In 
order 
to 
argue 
about 
this 
claim 
I 
enter 
into 
details 
of 
Ω°; 
that 
is 
I 
analyse 
the 
procedure 
allowing 
me 
to 
assign 
a 
respective 
measure 
to 
the 
eight 
possible 
alternatives 
(from 
now 
on 
“upshot”, 
symbolically 
“u”, 
is 
the 
technical 
term 
to 
mean 
the 
result 
of 
a 
throwing). 
Given 
a 
certain 
impulse 
(a 
certain 
value 
of 
the 
parametric 
quantity 
I) 
and 
a 
statute 
specifying 
the 
various 
resistances 
to 
the 
motion 
(frictional, 
gravitational, 
aerodynamic, 
magnetic 
and 
so 
on) 
that 
the 
slider 
meets 
from 
point 
to 
point 
(let 
R 
be 
their 
resultant), 
rational 
mechanics 
establishes 
where 
the 
slider 
will 
stop 
(that 
is 
the 
value 
of 
the 
covered 
distance 
L 
such 
that 
I 
is 
the 
integral 


of 
RdL 
from 
0 
to 
L). 
In 
order 
to 
avoid 
superfluous 
complications 
here 
too 
(§6.11) 
I 
assume 
that 
R 
is 
the 
same 
in 
every 
point 
of 
the 
tract, 
so 
that 
a 
direct 
proportionality 
exists 
between 
covered 
distances 
and 
impulses 
(let 
me 
insist: 
this 
simplification 
is 
not 
at 
all 
a 
theoretically 
reductive 
trick 
to 
introduce 


implicitly 
a 
positional 
equiprobability). 
Thanks 
to 
such 
an 
R-uniformity 
the 
octo-partitioned 
segment 
AB 
of 
Figure 
10.4 
can 
be 
indifferently 
interpreted 
as 
the 
iconic 
representation 
of 
the 
tract 
or 
as 
the 


(non-iconic) 
representation 
of 
DI 
that 
is 
of 
the 
impulsive 
range 
Imax 
-Imin. 
(where 
Imin 
and 
Imax 
are 
the 
impulses 
necessary 
to 
reach 
respectively 
the 
initial 
point 
of 
section 
1 
and 
the 
final 
point 
of 
section 
8). 


10.6.1. 
The 
probabilistic 
character 
of 
the 
problem 
depends 
on 
the 
fact 
that 
I 
is 
a 
parametric 
quantity. 
Of 
course 
the 
links 
between 
*parametric 
quantity* 
and 
*casual 
variable* 
are 
many, 
yet 
I 
follow 
my 
way 
without 
dwelling 
on 
a 
rather 
secondary 
theme; 
therefore 
I 
say 
that 
Ω° 
is 
a 
possibility 
space 
ruled 


by 
the 
parametric 
quantity 
I 
over 
the 
range 
DI 
(only 
impulses 
belonging 
to 
DI 
will 
be 
considered). 
Let 
me 
recall 
(ibidem) 
the 
flexibility 
of 
the 
example. 
Contrary 
to 
a 
die, 
where, 
say, 
an 
epta-partition 
of 
the 
possibility 
space 
would 
be 
rather 
difficult, 
here 
it 
would 
be 
easy 
to 
replace 
the 
octo-partition 
with 
an 
epta-partition, 
for 
instance 
by 
annexing 
section 
2 
to 
section 
3 
or 
by 
re-partitioning 
the 
entire 
tract. 
The 
crucial 
passage 
is 
that, 
since 
the 
potential 
final 
positions 
of 
the 
slider 
are 
‘infinite’, 
any 
finite 
partition 
(for 
instance 
our 
octo-partition) 
entails 
that 
physically 
different 
upshots 
must 
be 
considered 
equivalent 
as 
for 
their 
probabilistic 
classification. 


So, 
for 
instance, 
let 
I4min 
and 
I4max 
be 
the 
minimal 
and 
maximal 
impulses 
relative 
to 
the 
section 
4; 


I 
call 
“parametric 
differential 
(relative 
to 
the 
section 
4)” 
the 
value 
D4I=I4max-I4min. 
Generically 
but 


propaedeutically 
speaking 
the 
parametric 
differential 
Dj(x) 
relative 
to 
a 
certain 
parameter 
X 
and 
to 
a 


certain 
upshot 
uj 
is 
given 
by 
all 
the 
parametric 
values 
determining 
uj. 
In 
the 
next 
chapter 
more 
punctual 
considerations 
will 
be 
proposed. 



10.6.2. 
To 
object 
that 
both 
*parameter* 
and 
*parametric 
differential* 
are 
marginal 
notions 
because 
we 
can 
speak 
of 
probability 
also 
with 
reference 
to 
single 
events, 
seems 
to 
me 
a 
naivety. 
In 
fact 
the 
assignation 
of 
a 
probability 
to 
a 
single 
event 
is 
only 
possible 
if 
we 
insert 
the 
single 
event 
in 
a 
parametric 
context. 
For 
an 
omniscient 
subject 
the 
probability 
p 
that 
I 
will 
be 
alive 
in 
ten 
years 
is 
anyhow 
a 
certainty: 
either 
negative 
or 
(as 
I 
am 
inclined 
to 
hope) 
positive; 
in 
fact 
his 
omniscience 
allows 
him 
to 
know 
the 
future 
of 
that 
single 
and 
incomparable 
(in 
the 
most 
immodest 
acceptation) 
individual 
I 
am. 
But 
the 
probabilistic 
result 
of 
any 
non-omniscient 
approach 
will 
depend 
on 
the 
set 
I 
am 


inserted 
in: 
the 
probability 
p1 
relative 
to 
my 
being 
a 
seventy-years 
old 
Italian 
without 
severe 
diseases 


is 
greater 
than 
the 
probability 
p2 
relative 
to 
my 
being 
a 
person 
whose 
mother 
and 
maternal 
grand


father 
died 
at 
fifty 
by 
ictus; 
et 
cetera. 
And 
even 
if 
we 
claim 
that 
p 
is 
the 
pondered 
average 
of 
the 


various 
pi, 
we 
cannot 
avoid 
the 
conclusion 
that 
the 
probability 
of 
a 
single 
event 
passes 
necessarily 
through 
parametric 
probabilities. 


10.7. 
Coming 
back 
to 
our 
slider, 
concluding 
that 
the 
measure 
of 
each 
alternative 
(therefore 
the 
areas 
of 
the 
eight 
sectors 
occurring 
in 
a 
®-diagram) 
must 
be 
directly 
proportional 
to 
the 
respective 
parametric 
differentials 
(therefore 
to 
the 
lengths 
of 
the 
respective 
segments 
occurring 
in 
Figure 
10.4) 
would 
be 
a 
serious 
mistake. 
In 
fact 
concluding 
that 
the 
probability 
of 
a 
generic 
upshot 
uj 
is 
given 
by 
the 
ratio 


Dj(I)/ 
D(I) 
is 
postulating 
implicitly 
the 
uniform 
distribution 
of 
the 
impulses 
over 
the 
whole 
range 
D(I) 
because, 
evidently, 
if 
the 
rule 
determining 
the 
charge 
of 
the 
spring 
privileges 
some 
values, 
the 
corresponding 
upshots 
too 
are 
privileged. 
In 
other 
words, 
such 
a 
postulation 
is 
abusive, 
since 
a 
uniform 
distribution 
of 
the 
impulses 
is 
a 
possibility, 
not 
a 
necessity. 


10.7.1. 
I 
call 
“density 
function” 
(symbolically 
“y(I)”) 
the 
function 
establishing 
how 
the 
various 
I-
values 
are 
distributed 
over 
D(I). 
So 
the 
measure 
assigned 
to 
the 
j-alternative 
is 
directly 
proportional 
to 


(10.v) 
Dj(I)yj(I) 
where 
yj(I) 
is 
the 
average 
value 
of 
the 
density 
function 
on 
the 
respective 
differential 
(strictly, 
(10.v) 


ought 
to 
be 
replaced 
by 
the 
integral 
of 
the 
y–function 
from 
Ij,min 
to 
Ij,max). 
The 
coefficient 
of 
proportionality 
between 
measures 
and 
(10.v) 
depends 
on 
the 
choice 
of 
a 
unit, 
but 
it 
is 
of 
no 
theoretical 
moment 
(§7.15); 
for 
instance, 
with 
reference 
to 
Figure 
10.5 




(where 
a 
generic 
density 
function 
is 
represented 
in 
ordinate), 
the 
important 
factor 
is 
the 
ratio 
between 
the 
area 
of 
any 
single 
mixtilinear 
rectangle 
and 
the 
area 
of 
the 
whole 
figure, 
and 
such 
a 
ratio, 
manifestly, 
is 
not 
at 
all 
influenced 
by 
the 
unit 
we 
choose. 


10.7.2. 
Therefore, 
shortly, 
(10.vi) 
P(uj|k) 
= 
Dj 
(I)yj(I)/ 
Σ(Dj(I)yj(I)) 
is 
the 
general 
formula, 
and 
(10.vii) 
P(uj|k) 
= 
Dj 
(I)/ 
Σ(Dj 
(I)) 
is 
the 
particular 
formula 
where 
the 
uniformity 
of 
the 
density 
function 
allows 
the 
respective 
simplification. 


10.7.2.1. 
From 
a 
formal 
viewpoint 
it 
must 
be 
remarked 
that 
the 
reason 
why 
“k” 
does 
not 
occur 
in 
the 
second 
members 
of 
(10.vi) 
and 
(10.vii) 
is 
that 
the 
parametric 
differential 
and 
the 
density 
function 
can 
only 
be 
determined 
through 
a 
statute; 
however, 
if 
we 
prefer 
a 
heavier 
but 
more 
explicit 
formulation 
“Dj 
” 
and 
“yj 
” 
can 
be 
replaced 
by 
“Djk 
” 
and 
“yj,k 
” 
respectively. 
10.8. 
Two 
particular 
cases 
are 
represented 
in 
Figure 
10.6 
and 
10.7. 
In 
the 
former 
the 
density 
is 
uniform 
(therefore 
the 
areas 
are 
directly 
proportional 
to 
the 
parametric 
differentials 
(to 
the 
bases 
of 
the 
rectangles). 
In 
the 
latter 
the 
partition 
in 
parametric 
differentials 
is 
uniform, 
therefore 
the 
areas 
are 
directly 
proportional 
to 
the 
density 
(to 
the 
average 
heights 
of 
the 
rectangles). 
A 
doubly 
particular 
case 
is 
represented 
in 
Figure 
10.8, 
where 
both 
the 
differentials 
and 
the 
density 
are 
uniform, 
and 
consequently 
the 
upshots 
are 
equiprobable 
(the 
various 
rectangles 
have 
the 
same 
area). 
Equiprobable 
upshots 
(rectangles 
of 
the 
same 
area) 
are 
also 
obtained 
where 
(Figure 
10-9) 
both 
parametric 
differentials 
and 
densities 
are 
non-uniform, 
but 
an 
inverse 
proportionality 
exists 
between 



them, 
so 
that, 
according 
to 
(10.v), 
their 
product 
is 
invariant. 
These 
two 
kinds 
of 
equiprobability 
can 
be 
distinguished 
by 
calling 
“uniform” 
the 
former 
and 
“compensative” 
the 
latter. 


10.9. 
The 
proposed 
analysis 
shows 
that 
an 
assignation, 
besides 
depending 
on 
the 
parametric 
partition, 
depends 
on 
the 
density 
function 
y 
too. 
Then 
an 
easy 
puzzle 
(whose 
solution 
will 
be 
exposed 
in 
the 
next 
chapter) 
runs 
as 
follows. 
In 
the 
usual 
games 
of 
chances 
only 
the 
parametric 
partition 
is 
ascertained; 
for 
instance 
we 
see 
that 
every 
number 
has 
a 
sector 
of 
equal 
width 
in 
the 
rotating 
disk 
of 
a 
roulette, 
but 
we 
do 
not 
know 
the 
distribution 
of 
impulses 
transmitted 
by 
the 
croupier 
to 
the 
same 
disk 
and 
to 
the 
rolling 
ball: 
under 
the 
obvious 
condition 
that 
the 
roulette 
is 
well 
balanced, 
how 
on 
earth 
is 
the 
equiprobability 
of 
the 
upshots 
universally 
accepted? 
In 
other 
words: 
how 
on 
earth 
can 
we 
presuppose 
the 
uniformity 
of 
a 
density 
function 
we 
do 
not 
know? 
Particularly 
because 
this 
universally 
accepted 
presupposition 
is 
not 
limited 
to 
equiprobable 
assignations. 
For 
instance 
if 
we 
roll 
two 
dice, 
the 
partition 
is 
heteroprobable 
(1/36 
for 
a 
two 
or 
a 
twelve, 
1/18 
for 
a 
three 
or 
an 
eleven 
et 
cetera 
until 
1/6 
for 
a 
seven), 
but 
this 
heteroprobability 
respects 
exactly 
the 
combinatory 
mathematics 
and 
consequently, 
in 
the 
end, 
the 
partition 
of 
parametric 
differentials; 
therefore 
Figure 
10.6 
tells 
us 
that 
here 
too 
a 
uniform 
y 
is 
postulated. 



CHAPTER 
11 
PRINCIPLE 
OF 
INDIFFERENCE 


11.1. 
In 
order 
to 
epitomize 
my 
reasoning, 
I 
specify 
-that 
a 
cognition 
is 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
belonging 
to 
the 
statute 
of 
reference 
k, 
-that, 
once 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
derived 
from 
a 
subjective 
intervention 
is 
assumed 
as 
a 
part 
of 
a 
statute, 
it 
achieves 
the 
full 
status 
of 
a 
cognition 
(actually, 
in 
the 
current 
practice, 
distinguishing 
between 
subjective 
interventions 
and 
objective 
acquirements 
is 
often 
a 
difficult 
task) 


-that 
an 
assignation 
is 
k-equiprobable 
or 
k-uniform 
(k-heteroprobable 
or 
k-non-uniform) 
iff 
it 
does 


(not) 
assign 
the 
same 
k-probability 
(the 
same 
k-measure) 
to 
all 
the 
k-compatible 
alternatives 


-that, 
under 
a 
k 
entailing 
a 
uniform 
assignation, 
a 
further 
cognition 
k’ 
privileges 
a 
hypothesis 
h 


concerning 
the 
possibility 
space 
under 
scrutiny 
iff 
P(h|k&k’) 
> 
P(h|k). 
Therefore 


(11.i) 
in 
absence 
of 
privileging 
cognitions 
the 
assignation 
must 
be 
equiprobable 
is 
a 
formulation 
of 
the 
Principle 
of 
Indifference 
as 
currently 
intended. 
In 
any 
theory 
of 
probability 
I 
know, 
far 
from 
being 
a 
theorem; 
such 
a 
Principle 
represents 
an 
integrative 
criterion 
which 
ought 
to 
overcome 
the 
circularity 
affecting 
the 
classical 
definition 
of 
probability. 
Yet 
its 
validity 
is 
highly 
controversial. 
Indeed 
there 
are 
many 
contexts 
where 
the 
uniformity 
is 
a 
very 
unreasonable 
integrative 
criterion. 
A 
trivial 
example: 
under 
a 
defective 
statute 
telling 
us 
only 
that 
the 
heights 
of 
a 
crew 
vary 
from 
1,55m 
to 
1,95m, 
are 
we 
induced 
to 
a 
uniform 
assignation 
(according 
to 
which 
1,55 
and 
1.75 
are 
equiprobable 
heights) 
or 
rather 
to 
a 
bell-shaped 
one, 
according 
to 
which 
the 
average 
height 
is 
more 
probable 
than 
the 
extreme 
ones? 


11.2. 
I 
refuse 
(11.i). 
And 
since 
(11.ii) 
every 
assignation 
is 
legitimated 
only 
by 
the 
presence 
of 
confirming 
cognitions 
is 
an 
obvious 
rule, 


(11.iii) 
a 
heteroprobable 
assignation 
is 
legitimated 
only 
by 
the 
presence 
of 
privileging 
cognitions 
is 
the 
unquestionable 
particularization 
of 
(11.ii). 
At 
first 
sight 
refusing 
(11.i) 
and 
accepting 
(11.iii) 
seems 
a 
pathetic 
contradiction. 
In 
fact, 
since 
*heteroprobable* 
is 
the 
opposite 
of 
*equiprobable* 
and 
*absence* 
is 
the 
opposite 
of 
*presence*, 


(11.iv) 
heteroprobability 
É 
presence 
of 
privileging 
cognitions 

seems 
to 
imply 


(11.v) 
absence 
of 
privileging 
cognitions 
É 
equiprobability 
by 
Modus 
Tollens. 
Yet 
this 
schematic 
deduction 
is 
misleading. 
In 
fact 
the 
apodosis 
of 
(11.iv) 
concerns 
two 
oppositions: 
*presence* 
vs. 
*absence*, 
and 
*privileging* 
vs. 
*non-privileging*. 
So, 
since 
the 
opposition 
*equiprobable* 
vs. 
*heteroprobable* 
concerns 
two 
assignations, 
and 
since 
both 
of 
them 


must 
be 
based 
upon 
cognitions, 
the 
opposition 
to 
consider 
for 
the 
correct 
application 
of 
Modus 
Tollens 
cannot 
be 
*known* 
vs. 
*unknown* 
(cannot 
be 
*presence* 
vs. 
*absence*), 
but 
rather 
*privileging* 
vs. 
*non-privileging*. 
Therefore 


(11.vi) 
presence 
of 
non-privileging 
cognitions 
É 
equiprobability 
is 
the 
right 
inference 
by 
which 
(11.v) 
must 
be 
replaced. 
Aphoristically: 
since 
ignorance 
is 
not 
evidence, 
an 
ignorance-supported 
equiprobability 
is 
a 
logical 
abuse. 


11.2.1. 
In 
other 
words. 
Every 
assignation 
is 
grounded 
on 
a 
statute. 
If 
it 
is 
adequate, 
the 
absence 
of 
privileging 
cognitions 
implies 
the 
presence 
of 
non-privileging 
cognitions 
(otherwise 
the 
statute 
could 
not 
be 
adequate); 
therefore 
in 
condition 
of 
adequateness 
(11.i) 
is 
unobjectionable 
simply 
because 
it 
is 
equivalent 
to 
(11.vi). 
But 
of 
course 
if 
the 
statute 
is 
adequate, 
the 
Principle 
of 
Indifference 
is 
superfluous, 
as 
no 
integrative 
intervention 
is 
needed 
in 
order 
to 
perform 
the 
assignation 
complying 
with 
the 
same 
statute. 
11.3. 
This 
conclusion 
is 
immediately 
evident 
in 
Ò: 
while 
a 
really 
well-grounded 
assignation 
follows 
from 
an 
adequate 
statute 
and 
is 
represented 
by 
a 
specific 
partition 
of 
the 
circle, 
ignorance 
is 
ignorance 
of 
the 
partition, 
and 
as 
such 
is 
not 
represented 
by 
a 
uniform 
partition 
but 
by 
a 
defective 
partition. 
In 
Chapter 
12 
this 
matter 
will 
be 
more 
carefully 
approached. 
Here 
I 
examine 
some 
(misleading) 
arguments 
which 
might 
be 
proposed 
in 
order 
to 
sustain 
the 
Principle 
of 
Indifference 
in 
its 
current 
interpretation. 


11.4. 
A 
first 
argument 
pro 
Principle 
of 
Indifference 
might 
run 
as 
follows. 
Usually 
the 
text 
of 
a 
problem 
adduces 
all 
of 
the 
information 
necessary 
to 
make 
it 
a 
well 
determinate 
problem, 
that 
is 
all 
of 
the 
information 
necessary 
to 
solve 
it. 
So, 
when 
some 
datum 
is 
lacking, 
we 
are 
implicitly 
induced 
to 
think 
that 
such 
a 
lack 
can 
be 
filled 
by 
an 
intuitive 
additional 
cognition 
clearly 
suggested 
by 
the 
context. 
And 
actually 
in 
thousands 
of 
ordinary 
applications 
such 
an 
additional 
cognition 
follows 
from 
some 
kind 
of 
uniformity. 
For 
instance 
(11.vii) 
Given 
a 
circle 
C 
and 
an 
inscribed 
equilateral 
triangle 
T, 
what 
is 
the 
probability 
p 
that 
a 
point 
of 
C 
belong 
to 
T? 

is 
spontaneously 
interpreted 
as 
a 
well 
determinate 
problem 
whose 
solution 
is 
the 
ratio 
between 
the 
areas 
of 
T 
and 
C, 
that 
is 
p=3√3/4π. 
But 
this 
solution 
is 
right 
only 
under 
the 
presupposition 
of 
equiprobability 
(uniform 
density) 
for 
the 
points 
of 
C, 
therefore 
only 
under 
a 
tacit 
appeal 
to 
the 
Principle 
of 
Indifference. 
If 
the 
circle 
were 
the 
target 
of 
Robin 
Hood, 
the 
probability 
would 
be 
nearly 
1, 
because 
all 
his 
arrows 
would 
run 
into 
the 
immediate 
nearness 
of 
the 
centre. 
In 
other 
words. 
Since 
-we 
presuppose 
that 
(11.vii) 
formulates 
a 
determinate 
problem, 
-without 
a 
density 
function 
the 
problem 
is 
indeterminate, 
-no 
density 
function 
is 
indicated 
in 
(11.vii), 
we 
are 
induced 
to 
think 
that 
the 
omitted 
density 
function 
is 
the 
uniform 
one. 
Why 
the 
uniform 
one? 
Not 
only 
because 
the 
uniform 
density 
function 
is 
the 
simplest 
one, 
but 
also 
and 
mainly 
because 
it 
is 
the 
only 
one 
which 
can 
be 
tacitly 
understood 
(while 
there 
is 
only 
one 
uniform 
density 
function, 
there 
are 
infinite 
non-uniform 
density 
functions, 
so 
if 
we 
refuse 
the 
simplest 
choice, 
it 
becomes 
impossible 
to 
determine 
the 
problem, 
as 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
divine 
what 
of 
the 
non-uniform 
density 
functions 
must 
be 
assumed 
in 
order 
to 
fill 
the 
omission). 
Reply. 
The 
argument 
shows 
only 
that 
in 
some 
contexts 
we 
appeal 
to 
the 
Principle 
of 
Indifference. 
Nevertheless 
in 
other 
contexts 
we 
appeal 
to 
other 
criteria 
(for 
instance 
in 
the 
example 
of 
the 
crew 
we 
could 
appeal 
to 
a 
standard 
bell-shaped 
distribution) 
or 
even 
(where 
the 
context 
does 
not 
suggest 
any 
reasonable 
way 
out) 
we 
accept 
the 
indeterminateness 
of 
the 
problem, 
thus 
renouncing 
any 
assignation. 
In 
this 
sense 
claiming 
that 
(11.i) 
constitutes 
a 
general 
rule 
is 
a 
logical 
abuse. 


11.5. 
A 
second 
argument 
pro 
Principle 
of 
Indifference 
might 
be 
based 
on 
the 
example 
proposed 
in 
§7.13.2. 
Bob 
has 
just 
purchased 
a 
die 
about 
which 
he 
possesses 
no 
information; 
nevertheless 
there 
is 
nothing 
abusive 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
assigns 
the 
same 
probability 
to 
the 
six 
possible 
outcomes. 
Reply. 
His 
equiprobable 
assignation 
is 
legitimate, 
but 
the 
legitimation 
follows 
from 
statistical 
cognitions 
supporting 
it. 
In 
fact, 
almost 
in 
their 
totality, 
the 
dice 
on 
sale 
are 
well 
balanced. 
If 
Bob 
were 
to 
have 
purchased 
the 
die 
at 
www.Falsaria.com, 
he 
would 
have 
immediately 
rejected 
the 
equiprobable 
assignation. 


11.6. 
A 
third 
and 
more 
subtle 
argument 
pro 
Principle 
of 
Indifference 
runs 
as 
follows. 
Thousands 
of 
frequencies 
relative 
to 
honestly 
performed 
games 
of 
chance 
prove 
that 
their 
outcomes 
are 
equiprobable. 
Yet 
(§10.8) 
it 
cannot 
be 
a 
compensative 
equiprobability: 
in 
fact, 
since 
the 
parametric 
differentials 
are 
uniform 
(an 
honest 
die 
is 
cubic 
and 
well 
balanced, 
the 
rotating 
disk 
of 
a 
honest 
roulette 
is 
partitioned 
in 
37 
equal 
sectors 
et 
cetera) 
the 
density 
function 
too, 
although 
unknown, 
must 
be 
uniform. 
The 
concise 
reply 
is 
that 
a 
radical 
discrepancy 
forbids 
assimilating 
the 
context 
concerning 
the 
slider 
(§6.11) 
with 
the 
contexts 
concerning 
a 
die 
or 
a 
roulette, 
since 
only 
in 
the 
former 
case 
a 
uniformity 
of 
the 
parametric 
differential 
and 
the 
equiprobability 
of 
the 
upshots 
imply 
a 
uniform 
density 
function. 
The 
detailed 
reply 
below 
directs 
us 
towards 
a 
momentous 
theorization 
of 
the 
matter. 
11.6.1. 
First 
of 
all, 
let 
me 
summarise 
the 
general 
frame 
of 
the 
analysis. 
A 
probabilistic 
problem 
concerns 
factual 
contexts 
where 
at 
least 
one 
quantity 
can 
assume 
different 
values 
(the 
parametric 
range 
is 
the 
domain 
of 
a 
function 
whose 
co-domain 
is 
the 
set 
of 
possible 
upshots). 
Usually 
the 
different 
values 
of 
the 
parametric 
quantity 
are 
infinite, 
exactly 
as 
the 
final 
configurations 
they 
cause. 
For 
instance, 
the 
infinite 
different 
impulses 
to 
the 
slider 
and 
consequently 
the 
infinite 
different 
positions 
where 
it 
stops; 
analogously, 
the 
infinite 
different 
tosses 
to 
a 
die 
and 
consequently 
its 
infinite 
dynamic 
destiny 
(that 
is 
the 
complex 
sequence 
of 
rototranslations 
ending 
in 
its 
final 
position 
on 
the 
green 
baize). 
Yet 
a 
classification 
(a 
partition) 
is 
agreed 
upon 
whose 
ground 
physically 
different 
final 
configurations 
are 
made 
equal 
(in 
this 
sense 
I 
speak 
of 
conventional 
upshots). 
For 
instance 
a 
conventional 
upshot 
of 
the 
slider 
is 
constituted 
by 
all 
the 
punctual 
positions 
belonging 
to 
the 
same 
segment 
of 
the 
tract; 

analogously 
a 
conventional 
upshot 
of 
the 
die 
is 
constituted 
by 
all 
the 
outcomes 
where 
the 
die, 
quite 
independently 
on 
its 
specific 
rototranslative 
process 
and 
on 
its 
final 
position, 
stops 
with 
a 
certain 
side 
up. 
The 
parametric 
differential 
(relative 
to 
a 
certain 
conventional 
partition) 
is 
constituted 
by 
all 
the 
values 
of 
the 
parametric 
quantity 
determining 
a 
punctual 
final 
configuration 
which 
belongs 
to 
the 
conventional 
upshot 
under 
scrutiny 
(§10.6.1). 
But 
at 
this 
point 
we 
have 
to 
recognize 
that 
the 
same 
notion 
of 
parametric 
differential 
must 
be 
refined 
in 
order 
to 
distinguish 
a 
theoretically 
momentous 
discrepancy 
between 
two 
situations, 
both 
of 
them 
respecting 
the 
proposed 
condition. 
I 
clarify, 
and 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
concision 
henceforth 
I 
will 
speak 
of 
upshots 
to 
mean 
final 
configurations 
belonging 
to 
a 
conventional 
partition. 


Let 
I1 
and 
I2 
be 
two 
values 
leading 
to 
a 
same 
upshot 
uj. 
I 
say 
that 
I2– 
I1 
is 
a 
compact 
parametric 


differential 
iff 
every 
I3 
such 
that 
I1< 
I3 
< 
I2 
leads 
to 
uj. 
But 
if 
the 
number 
of 
upshots 
is 
less 
than 
the 


number 
of 
parametric 
differentials, 
this 
means 
that 
there 
are 
distinct 
compact 
parametric 
differentials 
leading 
to 
the 
same 
upshot. 
In 
this 
sense 
I 
will 
speak 
of 
composite 
parametric 
differentials 
to 
mean 
the 
union 
of 
all 
the 
compact 
ones 
leading 
to 
the 
same 
upshot. 
That 
is, 
symbolically, 
DjI 
=Σmdj,mI, 
where 


DjI 
is 
the 
composite 
differential 
leading 
to 
uj 
and 
dj,m 
is 
the 
generic 
compact 
differential 
leading 
to 


uj. 
Accordingly, 
I 
will 
speak 
of 
macropartitions 
to 
mean 
partitions 
where 
all 
parametric 
differentials 
are 
compact 
(that 
is 
where 
the 
number 
of 
upshots 
is 
also 
the 
number 
of 
parametric 
differentials) 
and 
of 
micropartitions 
in 
the 
contrary 
case. 
The 
radical 
discrepancy 
mentioned 
in 
the 
concise 
reply 
of 
§6 
above 
is 
that 
while 
a 
rail 
partitioned 
in 
eight 
segments 
determines 
a 
macropartition, 
a 
rolled 
die 
or 
a 
roulette 
determines 
micropartitions. 
In 
order 
to 
emphasize 
the 
theoretical 
importance 
of 
this 
discrepancy 
I 
insert 
the 
slider 
in 
a 
new 
context. 


11.6.2. 
The 
possible 
upshots 
are 
always 
8, 
each 
of 
them 
identified 
by 
a 
specific 
colour 
(so 
for 
instance 
u1 
is 
red, 
u2 
is 
yellow 
and 
so 
forth 
until 
u8, 
blue). 
Yet 
the 
tract 
of 
the 
rail 
is 
partitioned 
in 
eight 
million 
equal 
sections 
(the 
parametrical 
range 
is 
uniformly 
partitioned 
in 
eight 
million 
compact 
microdifferentials 
dI) 
so 
that 
the 
sections 
1, 
9, 
17, 
...7999993 
are 
red, 
the 
sections 
2, 
10, 
18, 
...7999994 
are 
yellow, 
and 
so 
forth 
until 
the 
sections 
8, 
16, 
24, 
... 
8000000 
which 
are 
blue. 
The 
crucial 
point 
is 
that, 
under 
this 
partition, 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
to 
suppose 
a 
uniform 
density 
function 
in 
order 
to 
get 
a 
uniform 
assignation. 
In 
fact, 
for 
instance, 
even 
a 
density 
function 
like 
the 
one 
represented 
in 
Figure 
10.5 
compensates 
statistically 
(I 
would 
dare 
to 
write 
“by 
entropy”) 
the 
one 
million 
occurrences 
of 
any 
colour. 
Let 
me 
insist: 
the 
same 
(and 
non-uniform) 
density 
function 
that 
under 
a 
macropartition 
would 
entail 
a 
non-uniform 
assignation, 
under 
a 
micropartition 
entails 
a 
uniform 
assignation. 


11.6.2.1. 
Objection. 
There 
are 
peculiar 
density 
functions 
which 
present 
different 
average 
values 
for 
the 
various 
upshots. 
For 
instance 
if 
we 
miniaturize 
Figure 
10.5 
so 
that 
its 
new 
range 
is 
dI 
= 
DI/106, 
the 
density 
function 
reproducing 
one 
million 
times 
that 
same 
function 
assigns 
to 
the 
various 
upshots 
the 
same 
values 
of 
Figure 
10.5. 


Reply. 
These 
ad 
hoc 
density 
functions 
constitute 
only 
an 
infinitesimal 
part 
of 
the 
possible 
ones, 
therefore, 
again 
for 
statistic 
reasons, 
the 
assumption 
of 
a 
common 
average 
density 
is 
highly 
justified. 
Furthermore 
it 
is 
totally 
implausible 
to 
claim 
that 
a 
croupier 
is 
able 
to 
realize 
manually 
one 
of 
these 
ad 
hoc 
functions. 
Both 
considerations 
represent 
a 
strong 
cognition 
supporting 
the 
assumption 
of 
equiprobability, 
which 
therefore 
is 
perfectly 
compatible 
with 
a 
non-uniform 
density 
function. 
Comment 
to 
the 
reply. 
Even 
supposing 
that 
the 
lengths 
of 
the 
eight 
million 
sections, 
far 
from 
being 
equal, 
are 
casually 
chosen, 
does 
not 
influence 
the 
probabilistic 
conclusions, 
since 
here 
too 
the 
average 



length 
is 
anyway 
the 
same. 
In 
order 
to 
exhibit 
a 
context 
where 
a 
micropartition 
leads 
to 
a 
non-uniform 
assignation 
we 
must 
assure 
a 
peculiar 
length 
to 
all 
the 
microsections 
of 
the 
same 
color: 
but 
this 
is 
so 
anti-entropic 
a 
case 
(obviously 
the 
more 
micro 
is 
the 
micropartition, 
the 
more 
anti-entropic 
is 
the 
anti-
entropic 
case) 
that 
our 
old 
world 
continues 
coherently 
running 
under 
the 
opposite 
hypothesis. 


11.7. 
I 
epitomise 
the 
topic 
through 
a 
schematic 
paradigm 
enriched 
by 
some 
remarks. 
Once 
agreed 
-that 
n 
is 
the 
number 
of 
converging 
compact 
differentials 
(for 
the 
sake 
of 
simplicity 
I 
assume 
that 
every 
composite 
differential 
results 
from 
the 
same 
number 
of 
compact 
differentials), 


-that 
DjI 
=Σm(1,n)dj,mI 
(the 
composite 
differential 
relative 
to 
a 
generic 
upshot 
is 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
respective 
compact 
differentials), 


-that 
ψj 
=Σm(1,n)yj,m/n 
(the 
density 
relative 
to 
the 
composite 
differential 
is 
the 
average 
of 
the 
respective 
densities 
relative 
to 
the 
correspondent 
n 
compact 
differentials), 
the 
general 
formula 
is 


(11.viii) 
μ(uj) 
= 
c(ψjDjI) 
(that 
is: 
the 
measure 
of 
an 
upshot 
is 
directly 
proportional 
to 
the 
product 
of 
its 
composite 
differential 
and 
the 
correspondent 
average 
density). 
Some 
particular 
formulas 
are 
obtainable 
by 
simplifying 
(11.viii) 
in 
accordance 
with 
some 
particular 
contexts. 


11.7.1. 
Under 
a 
non-uniform 
macropartition 
and 
an 
uniform 
density 
function 
(that 
is, 
concisely, 
under 
n=1, 
~(DjI 
=DlI), 
ψj=ψl= 
ψ), 
(11.viii) 
becomes 
(11.ix) 
μ(uj) 
= 
c*(DjI) 
where 
of 
cours 
c* 
is 
cψ 
and 
any 
DjI 
is 
a 
compact 
differential. 
The 
upshots 
are 
heteroprobable 
in 


accordance 
with 
DjI. 
It 
is 
the 
situation 
represented 
in 
Figure 
10.6. 


11.7.1.1. 
Just 
as 
(11.ix) 
is 
a 
particular 
case 
of 
(11.viii), 
(11.x) 
μ(uj) 
= 
c** 
is 
the 
particular 
case 
of 
(11.ix) 
where, 
besides 
the 
density, 
the 
macropartition 
too 
is 
uniform 
(DjI=DlI=DI 
and 
c**=c*DI. 
The 
upshots 
are 
equiprobable. 
It 
is 
the 
situation 
represented 
in 
Figure 
10.8. 
11.7.2. 
Under 
a 
non-uniform 
macropartition 
and 
a 
non-uniform 
density 
function 
(that 
is, 
concisely, 
under 
n=1, 
~(DjI 
=DlI), 
~(ψj=ψl)), 
the 
only 
simplification 
of 
(11.viii) 
is 
that 
no 
sum 
and 
no 
average 
are 
needed. 
The 
probability 
of 
the 
upshots 
is 
directly 
proportional 
to 
yjDjI. 
Then, 
in 
general, 
the 
upshots 
will 
be 
heteroprobable 
(it 
is 
the 
situation 
represented 
in 
10.5); 
yet 
a 
compensative 
equiprobability 
follows 
from 
an 
extremely 
ad 
hoc 
and 
non-uniform 
density 
function 
counterbalancing 


the 
non-uniformity 
of 
the 
parametric 
differentials, 
so 
assuring 
the 
invariance 
of 
(11.viii). 
It 
is 
the 
situation 
represented 
in 
Figure 
10.9, 
where 
all 
the 
mixtilinear 
rectangles 
have 
the 
same 
area. 


11.7.2.1. 
Under 
the 
particular 
case 
of 
an 
uniform 
macropartition, 
(11.viii) 
becomes 

(11.xi) 
μ(uj) 
= 
c*** 
ψj 
where 
of 
course 
c*** 
= 
cDI. 
The 
upshots 
are 
heteroprobable 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
density 
function. 
It 
is 
the 
situation 
represented 
in 
Figure 
10.7. 


11.7.3. 
Uniform 
micropartition. 
The 
upshots 
are 
analytically 
equiprobable 
under 
a 
uniform 
ψ 
and 
statistically 
equiprobable 
under 
a 
non-uniform 
ψ 
because, 
statistically, 
also 
in 
the 
latter 
case 
ψj=ψl, 
that 
is 
because. 
statistically, 
also 
in 
the 
latter 
case 
Σm(1,n)yj,m=Σm(1,n)yl,m. 


11.7.4. 
Contrary 
to 
uniform 
micropartitions, 
which 
are 
always 
non-privileging, 
both 
privileging 
and 
non-privileging 
non-uniform 
micropartitions 
do 
exist. 
I 
make 
my 
point 
clearer 
with 
reference 
to 
our 
canonical 
example. 
11.7.4.1. 
A 
non-uniform 
and 
privileging 
micropartition 
results 
from 
a 
miniaturization 
similar 
to 
the 
one 
proposed 
in 
§11.6.2.1, 
provided 
that 
here 
we 
are 
under 
condition 
of 
non-uniformity. 
Since 
the 
ratio 
dj,/dl 
is 
always 
the 
same, 
it 
reproduces 
itself 
in 
the 
ratio 
Dj,/Dl; 
and 
since 
the 
micropartition 
entails 


Σm(1,n)yj,m=Σm(1,n)yl,m 
, 
we 
are 
in 
a 
situation 
analogous 
to 
§11.7.1 
(non 
uniform 
macropartitions 
with 
uniform 
density). 
A 
non-uniform 
and 
privileging 
micropartition 
could 
also 
be 
easily 
realized 
by 
a 
deformed 
die, 
or 
by 
a 
cyclic 
context 
(for 
instance 
by 
a 
roulette 
where 
the 
rotating 
disk 
is 
fixed, 
its 
various 
spaces 
are 
not 
the 
same 
for 
every 
number, 
and 
the 
parametric 
range 
of 
the 
rolled 
ball 
is 
wide). 
Only 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
completeness 
I 
evoke 
the 
theoretical 
possibility 
of 
a 
compensative 
equiprobability. 


11.7.4.2. 
A 
non-uniform 
and 
non-privileging 
micropartition 
is 
realized 
where 
the 
microdifferentials 
are 
different, 
but 
casually 
determined 
(for 
instance: 
the 
rail 
is 
partitioned 
in 
eight 
million 
microsegments 
following 
the 
chromatic 
order, 
the 
possible 
lengths 
are 
eight, 
but 
the 
eight 
million 
assignations 
of 
a 
length 
to 
any 
microsegment 
are 
casual). 
In 
such 
a 
context, 
though 
~( 
dj=dl), 
Dj=Dl. 


11.8. 
At 
this 
point 
the 
solution 
of 
the 
puzzle 
proposed 
in 
§10.9 
ought 
to 
be 
clear: 
owing 
to 
the 
micropartition 
of 
impulses 
transmitted 
by 
the 
croupier 
to 
the 
rotating 
disk 
and 
to 
the 
rolling 
ball, 
the 
density 
function 
is 
statistically 
uniform, 
then 
the 
upshots 
are 
equiprobable. 
Yet 
I 
hope 
that 
some 
more 
detailed 
reflections 
will 
be 
welcomed, 
also 
because 
the 
same 
notion 
of 
probability, 
historically, 
was 
born 
by 
questions 
about 
games 
of 
chance. 
First 
of 
all 
I 
focus 
on 
the 
notions 
of 
compact 
and 
composite 
parametric 
differentials 
making 
reference 
to 
the 
simplest 
game 
of 
chance, 
that 
is 
to 
a 
coin 
rolled 
by 
a 
mechanized 
apparatus 
(the 
extrapolation 
to 
others 
games 
of 
chance 
is 
immediate). 
The 
range 
of 
the 
possible 
impulses 
transmitted 
to 
the 
coin 
is 
wide, 
but 
it 
can 
be 
partitioned 
in 
many 
compact 
microdifferentials, 
each 
of 
them 
delimitated 
(in 
accordance 
with 
the 
definition) 
by 
those 
impulsive 
microvariations 
which 
should 
determine 
the 
opposite 
upshot 
(that 
is, 
roughly, 
those 
impulsive 
microvariations 
which 
would 
modify 
the 
number 
of 
rototranslations 
of 
the 
coin) 
and 
the 
union 
of 
all 
the 
microdifferentials 
converging 
on 
a 
single 
upshot 
is 
its 
composite 
impulsive 
differential. 
A 
serious 
game 
of 
chance 
must 
assure 
a 
basic 
equiprobability. 
Yet 
a 
compensative 
equiprobability 
is 
practically 
unrealizable 
(for 
instance, 
in 
order 
to 
realize 
it 
we 
should 
compensate 
a 
deceptive 
coin 
through 
an 
impulsive 
program 
privileging 
at 
the 
same 
ratio 
the 
unfavoured 
side). 
Therefore 
the 
equiprobability 
is 
uniform. 
The 
paradigm 
shows 
that 
a 
uniform 
equiprobability 
can 
be 
realized 
a) 
either 
by 
the 
context 
of 
§11.7.1.1 
(uniform 
macropartition 
and 
uniform 
density). 
b) 
or 
by 
the 
context 
of 
§11.7.3, 
that 
is 

b1) 
uniform 
micropartition 
and 
uniform 
density 
b2) 
uniform 
micropartition 
and 
non-uniform 
density. 
Then, 
since 
no 
usual 
game 
of 
chance 
can 
assure 
a 
uniform 
density, 
the 
equiprobability 
of 
the 
upshots 
follows 
from 
b2). 
Why? 
Because 
b2) 
is 
the 
simplest 
and 
best 
context 
to 
avoid 
the 
previous 
programmability 
of 
certain 
upshots 
(trivially: 
to 
avoid 
tricks). 
In 
fact 
the 
various 
trials 
are 
not 
realized 
through 
mechanized 
apparatus, 
but 
through 
manual 
interventions, 
and 
within 
a 
macropartition 
a 
short 
training 
would 
be 
sufficient 
to 
instruct 
the 
croupier 
in 
obtaining 
certain 
upshots 
(for 
instance, 
to 
instruct 
him 
in 
opportunely 
impulsing 
the 
slider 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
actual 
stakes). 
In 
other 
words. 
The 
uniformity 
of 
the 
parametric 
differentials 
is 
usually 
assured 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
normal 
coin 
is 
well 
balanced, 
or 
that 
a 
normal 
die 
is 
a 
cube 
whose 
geometrical 
centre 
is 
also 
its 
barycentre, 
or 
that 
the 
various 
numbers 
in 
the 
disk 
of 
a 
roulette 
have 
the 
same 
room, 
or 
that 
the 
sections 
of 
our 
rail 
have 
the 
same 
length 
and 
resistance, 
et 
cetera). 
But 
under 
a 
macropartition 
of 
the 
parametric 
range, 
the 
equiprobability 
can 
be 
assured 
only 
by 
a 
uniform 
density, 
and 
to 
alter 
cunningly 
this 
condition 
is 
a 
rather 
easy 
task; 
therefore 
a) 
is 
rejected. 
As 
for 
b), 
so 
to 
say, 
the 
more 
micro 
the 
partition, 
the 
more 
difficult 
it 
is 
to 
alter 
cunningly 
the 
density 
function: 
in 
fact 
-the 
microdifferentials 
render 
more 
difficult 
to 
perform 
a 
pre-programmed 
value 
belonging 
to 
one 
of 
them, 
-the 
uniformity 
of 
the 
density 
function 
is 
not 
a 
condition 
for 
the 
equiprobability 
of 
the 
upshots. 


In 
other 
words; 
the 
same 
empirical 
structure 
of 
the 
games 
of 
chance 
has 
been 
specifically 
studied 
in 
order 
to 
render 
practically 
impossible 
any 
trick 
(there 
is 
no 
human 
croupier 
able 
to 
transmit 
to 
the 
rotating 
disk 
of 
a 
well 
balanced 
roulette 
and 
to 
the 
rolled 
ball 
two 
impulses 
leading 
to 
a 
specific 
upshot). 
Of 
course 
there 
are 
other 
possibilities 
to 
cheat 
(for 
instance 
a 
hidden 
magnet 
et 
cetera), 
but 
while 
these 
eventualities 
concern 
a 
documentable 
modification 
of 
the 
context, 
a 
diabolically 
able 
croupier 
would 
not 
modify 
it. 
In 
this 
sense 
I 
say 
that 
in 
a 
micropartition 
the 
upshots 
are 
not 
preprogrammable. 
Indeed 
the 
distinction 
*micro* 
vs. 
*macro* 
is 
not 
focused 
on 
the 
pre-programmability 
of 
the 
parametric 
values, 
but 
on 
the 
number 
of 
distinct 
compact 
differentials 
converging 
on 
the 
same 
upshot 
(that 
is: 
on 
the 
ratio 
1/n). 
The 
criterion 
of 
the 
pre-programmability 
is 
important 
with 
regards 
to 
the 
possibility 
to 
cheat, 
but 
nothing 
more. 


11.8.1. 
Of 
course 
the 
mentioned 
statistical 
reasons 
weaken 
with 
the 
decreasing 
of 
n; 
for 
instance 
if 
the 
segments 
of 
the 
tract 
were 
only 
16 
(n=2) 
the 
uniformity 
of 
the 
average 
density 
values 
would 
be 
a 
quite 
debatable 
conclusion. 
Yet 
this 
is 
only 
a 
theoretical 
specification; 
in 
the 
actual 
game 
of 
chances 
n 
is 
extremely 
high 
and 
consequently 
the 
statistical 
reasons 
do 
not 
give 
any 
pretext 
to 
dissent. 


11.9. 
The 
best 
evidence 
showing 
that 
the 
Principle 
of 
Indifference 
in 
its 
canonical 
formulation 
is 
untenable 
consists 
in 
the 
lot 
of 
paradoxes 
following 
from 
its 
acritical 
application. 
11.9.1. 
A 
first 
family 
of 
paradoxes 
involving 
the 
Principle 
of 
Indifference 
concerns 
polyadic 
partitions 
(that 
is: 
the 
possibility 
spaces 
whose 
alternatives 
are 
more 
than 
two), 
and 
can 
be 
exemplified 
as 
follows. 
A 
beautiful 
blonde 
enters 
into 
the 
railway 
compartment 
where 
Tom 
is 
growing 
weary. 
Ten 
minutes 
pass 
and 
he 
already 
knows 
she 
is 
a 
thirty-five-years-old 
and 
unmarried 
Norwegian 
pediatrist 
named 
“Greta”. 
-Is 
Greta 
single?-Tom 
asks 
himself, 
and 
for 
want 
of 
privileging 
cognitions, 
the 
Principle 
of 
Indifference 
teaches 
him 
that 
the 
respective 
probability 
is 
50%. 
Analogously, 
if 
his 
question 
were 
-Is 
Greta 
a 
divorcee?-, 
for 
want 
of 
privileging 
cognitions 
the 
Principle 
would 
teach 
him 
that 
the 
respective 
probability 
is 
50%. 
Exactly 
as 
if 
his 
question 
were 
-Is 
Greta 
a 
widow?-Then, 
absurdly, 
the 
probability 
that 
she 
is 
a 
single 
or 
a 
divorcee 
or 
a 
widow 
ought 
to 
be 
150%. 

The 
solution 
is 
trivial. 
Everyone 
has 
the 
right 
to 
reason 
on 
the 
hypotheses 
he 
prefers, 
but 
if 
at 
least 
one 
of 
the 
two 
following 
conditions 
-the 
coherence 
of 
his 
hypotheses 
-the 
coherence 
of 
his 
reasoning 
is 
not 
respected, 
the 
conclusions 
he 
draws 
are 
manifestly 
and 
completely 
valueless. 
In 
the 
case 
to 
assign 


P=50% 
to 
one 
of 
the 
three 
alternatives 
is 
to 
assign 
P=50% 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
remaining 
two. 
Since 
whatever 
assignation 
is 
based 
on 
an 
(objective 
or 
subjective) 
partition 
of 
the 
possibility 
space, 
and 
since 
all 
the 
theories 
of 
probability 
converge 
on 
the 
same 
theorems, 
an 
anti-theoremic 
partition 
is 
incoherent. 
Then, 
assuming 
that 
Tom 
has 
no 
information 
about 
the 
percentages 
of 
singles, 
divorcees 
and 
widows 
relative 
to 
the 
thirty-five-years-old 
and 
unmarried 
Norwegian 
pediatrists, 
either 
he 
recognizes 
the 
impossibility 
of 
an 
assignation, 
or 
he 
must 
appeal 
to 
some 
informational 
integration 
(either 
ruled 
by 
the 
Principle 
of 
Indifference 
or 
by 
some 
subjective 
opinion). 
Then, 
if 
Tom 
decides 
to 
follow 
the 
Principle, 
since 
the 
possibility 
space 
relative 
to 
*unmarried* 
is 
partitioned 
in 
*single*, 
*divorcee* 
and 
*widow*, 
he 
must 
assign 
the 
same 
probability 
(1/3) 
to 
the 
three 
alternatives. 
And 
if 
(much 
more 
plausibly) 
Tom 
refuses 
the 
Principle 
and 
accepts 
the 
subjective 
integration 
suggested 
by 
his 
common 
sense 
(according 
to 
which 
singles 
are 
much 
more 
numerous 
than 
widows 
among 
the 
thirty-five-years-old 
and 
unmarried 
Norwegian 
pediatrists) 
he 
will 
assign 
to 
the 
first 
hypothesis 
a 


greater 
probability 
et 
cetera, 
respecting 
anyhow 
the 
theoremic 
condition 
P1+ 
P2+ 
P3 
=1). 
In 
other 
words. 
While 


P(h|k) 
+ 
P(~h|k) 
> 
1 


is 
absurd 
(antitheoremic) 


P(h|k1) 
+ 
P(~h|k2) 
> 
1 


is 
perfectly 
possible, 
provided 
that 
k1 
and 
k2 
are 
distinct 
statutes. 
And 
the 
three 
previous 
assignations 
can 
only 
be 
justified 
by 
a 
reference 
to 
three 
incompatible 
statutes. 


11.9.2. 
A 
second 
family 
of 
paradoxes 
involving 
the 
Principle 
of 
Indifference 
concerns 
the 
inverse 
quantities 
and 
can 
be 
exemplified 
as 
follows. 
In 
this 
store 
there 
are 
one 
hundred 
well 
piled 
heaps 
of 
different 
timbers: 
we 
know 
only 
that 
each 
of 
them 
weighs 
exactly 
2 
tons 
and 
that 
the 
specific 
weight 
sw 
of 
the 
hundred 
timbers 
varies 
from 
0.50 
to 
1,00. 
The 
Principle 
of 
Indifference 
(in 
its 
naive 
formulation) 
assigns 
the 
same 
probability 
to 
any 
given 
sw 
of 
the 
range, 
therefore, 
taken 
a 
generic 
heap, 
its 
probability 
of 
having 
a 
sw>0.75 
is 
equal 
to 
its 


probability 
of 
having 
a 
sw<0.75. 
Yet 
the 
Principle 
can 
also 
be 
applied 
to 
the 
volumes 
v, 
which 


obviously 
vary 
from 
4,00m3 
to 
2,00m3, 
therefore 
if 
we 
choose 
to 
reason 
on 
volumes, 
since 
the 
same 


probability 
is 
assigned 
to 
each 
of 
them, 
the 
probability 
for 
a 
generic 
heap 
of 
having 
a 
v>3,00m2 
is 


equal 
to 
the 
probability 
of 
having 
a 
v<3,00m2 
. 
The 
contradiction 
is 
that 
two 
inferences 
applied 
to 
the 
same 
situation 
lead 
to 
incompatible 
conclusions, 
as 
the 
specific 
weight 
of 
a 
2 
ton 
heap 
whose 
volume 
is 


3,00m3 
is 
not 
0.75. 
but 
0.66. 


The 
solution 
is 
easy. 
Since 
sw 
and 
v 
are 
inverse 
quantities, 
their 
link 
is 
not 
linear, 
but 
hyperbolic, 
so 
that 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
assume 
a 
uniform 
distribution 
of 
the 
specific 
weights 
we 
are 
assuming 
a 
nonuniform 
distribution 
of 
the 
volumes 
(and 
vice 
versa). 
Let 
me 
insist 
through 
a 
concise 
appeal 
to 
analytic 
geometry: 


v=2/sw 


is 
the 
equation 
of 
a 
hyperbole, 
that 
is 
of 
a 
curve 
whose 
average 
abscissa, 
owing 
to 
strictly 
mathematical 
reasons, 
cannot 
correspond 
to 
its 
average 
ordinate. 



Here 
too, 
then, 
the 
correct 
procedure 
is 
sufficient 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
the 
paradox. 
Since 
every 
assignation 


must 
be 
based 
on 
(objective 
or 
subjective) 
cognitions 
supporting 
it, 
an 
equiprobable 
assignation 
relative 
to 
sw 
presupposes 
cognitions 
supporting 
it; 
and 
these 
same 
cognitions, 
necessarily, 
sustain 
a 
nonuniform 
distribution 
of 
the 
respective 
volumes 
(or 
vice 
versa) 
since 
specific 
weights 
and 
volumes 
are 
non-linearly 
related 
parameters. 


11.9.2.1. 
Indeed 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
the 
distribution 
of 
the 
specific 
weights 
is 
uniform 
between 
0.50 
and 
1.00 
has 
been 
dictated 
by 
the 
opportunity 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
paradox 
in 
its 
usual 
formulation, 
nevertheless 
it 
is 
rather 
implausible; 
here 
too 
(as 
in 
the 
example 
of 
the 
crew) 
the 
most 
plausible 
hypothesis 
suggests 
a 
normal 
distribution, 
that 
is 
bell-shaped 
curve). 
Anyhow 
the 
solution 
holds 
even 
in 
this 
case, 
since 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
suppose 
the 
symmetry 
of 
the 
sw-curve 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
value 
0.75t/m3 
(so 
legitimating 
the 
conclusion 
that 
the 
probabilities 
of 
being 
less 
and 
of 
being 
more 
are 
equal), 
we 
are 
supposing 
an 


asymmetry 
(a 
deformation) 
of 
the 
v-curve 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
value 
3.00m3 
(so 
entailing 
the 
conclusion 


that 
the 
probabilities 
of 
being 
<3.00m3 
and 
of 
being 
>3.00m3 
are 
different) 
et 
cetera. 


11.10. 
A 
deeper 
analysis 
is 
needed 
to 
evaluate 
satisfactorily 
a 
family 
of 
geometrical 
paradoxes 
involving 
the 
Principle 
of 
Indifference. 
I 
summarize 
the 
most 
renowned 
one, 
that 
is 
Bertrand’s 
paradox, 
as 
follows. 
Given 
a 
circle 
of 
radius 
R, 
in 
condition 
of 
parametric 
uniformity 
the 
problem 
(11.xii) 
what 
is 
the 
probability 
P 
that 
a 
randomly 
drawn 
chord 
will 
have 
a 
length 
more 
than 
R√3? 
admits 
three 
incompatible 
solutions. 
If 
we 
reason 
on 
a 
sheaf 
of 
parallel 
chords 
(parallel 
approach 
S1) 


the 
answer 
is 
P1=1/2. 
If 
we 
reason 
on 
the 
sheaf 
of 
chords 
rotating 
on 
a 
point 
of 
the 
circumference 


(polar 
approach 
S2) 
the 
answer 
is 
P2=1/3. 
If 
we 
reason 
on 
the 
mid-points 
of 
the 
chords 
(areal 
approach 


S3) 
the 
answer 
is 
P3=1/4. 
Its 
current 
solution 
(Van 
Fraassen, 
Hajek) 
claims 
that 
the 
paradox 
is 
born 
by 
the 
application 
of 
the 
Principle 
of 
Indifference 
to 
non-linearly 
related 
parameters. 
In 
my 
opinion 
such 
a 
claim 
is 
not 
a 
solution 
because 
it 
does 
not 
realize 


I) 
that 
S1 
and 
S2 
are 
only 
two 
different 
instances 
of 
the 
same 
application 
II) 
that 
S3 
is 
vitiated 
by 
a 
geometrical 
mistake. 
11.10.1. 
As 
for 
I) 
I 
start 
from 
a 
more 
punctual 
formulation 
of 
the 
probabilistic 
problem. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
simplicity 
the 
discourse 
is 
limited 
to 
a 
semicircle. 
So, 
with 
reference 
to 
Figure 
11.1, 

where 
-O 
is 
the 
centre 
of 
a 
semicircle 
of 
radius 
R 
-A 
is 
an 
external 
and 
generic 
point 
on 
the 
diametric 
straight 
of 
basic 
reference 
-X 
is 
the 
distance 
between 
O 
and 
A 
(obviously 
X 
varies 
from 
R 
to 
∞) 
-AT 
is 
the 
tangent, 
-ABC 
is 
a 
generic 
straight 
intersecting 
the 
semi-circumference 
in 
B 
and 
C 
-ADE 
is 
the 
straight 
intersecting 
the 
chord 
of 
critical 
length 
(R√3) 
-M 
is 
the 
mid-point 
of 
DE, 
therefore 
AM 
is 
the 
tangent 
to 
the 
concentric 
circle 
with 
radius 
R/2 
-F 
is 
the 
intersection 
OT-BC 
-Y 
is 
the 
distance 
OF 


-a 
is 
the 
angle 
OAT 


-x 
is 
the 
generic 
angle 
OAB 


-b 
is 
the 
angle 
OAD 


the 
probabilistic 
problem 
to 
solve 
finds 
in 


(11.xiii) 
what 
is 
the 
probability 
P 
that 
BC 
is 
longer 
than 
R√3? 
its 
new 
formulation. 
Thus 
we 
have 
specified 
(11.xii) 
by 
considering 
the 
sheaf 
of 
chords 
passing 
for 
a 
generic 
point 
A 
of 
the 
plane. 
In 
such 
a 
context, 
x 
is 
the 
parameter 
to 
which 
the 
Principle 
of 
Indifference 
must 
be 
applied, 
so 
establishing 
a 
polar 
uniformity 
(equiprobability) 
for 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
various 
chords. 
Therefore 


(11.xiv) 
b/ 
a 
is 
the 
probability 
that 
BC 
is 
longer 
than 
DE. 
Since 
elementary 
trigonometry 
teaches 
us 
that 
a 
= 
arc 
sin(R/X) 
b 
= 
arc 
sin(R/2X) 


and 
since 
the 
lengths 
of 
OT 
and 
OM 
are 
respectively 
R 
and 
R/2, 
a=arc 
sin(2sinb) 


(AO 
sin 
a 
= 
R 
= 
2AO 
sin 
b); 
the 
conclusion 
is 
that, 
on 
the 
ground 
of 
(11.xiv), 


(11.xv) 
b/arc 
sin(2sinb) 
or 
indifferently 



(11.xvi) 
arc 
sin(R/2X) 
/ 
arc 
sin(R/X) 
is 
the 
ratio 
expressing 
P. 
I 
wrote 
“indifferently” 
to 
mean 
that 
(11.xv) 
and 
(11.xvi) 
can 
be 
immediately 
and 
reciprocally 
transformed, 
for 
their 
discrepancy 
depends 
only 
on 
the 
variable 
we 
choose 
to 
express 
the 
generic 
position 
of 
A: 
exactly 
as 
we 
get 
(11.xv) 
if 
we 
choose 
“b”, 
we 
get 
(11.xvi) 
if 
we 
choose 
“X”. 


Anyhow 
the 
crucial 
conclusion 
is 
that 
P 
depends 
on 
the 
position 
of 
A. 
For 
instance 


(11.xvii) 
when 
X=R, 
a=90°, 
sin 
a=1, 
sin 
b=1/2, 
b=30°, 
b/ 
a=1/3 
(that 
is 
P2) 
when 
X=2R/√3, 
a=60°, 
sin 
a=√3/2, 
sin 
b 
=√3/4, 
b≈25°40’, 
b/ 
a≈0,428 
when 
X=R√2 
a=45°, 
sin 
a=√2/2, 
sin 
b 
=√2/4, 
b≈21°, 
b/ 
a≈0,466 
when 
X=2R, 
a=30°, 
sin 
a=1/2, 
sin 
b 
=1/4, 
b≈14°30’, 
b/ 
a≈0,483 


• 
when 
X®∞, 
a®0, 
b®0, 
sin2b®2sin 
b, 
b/ 
a®1/2 
(that 
is 
P1). 
All 
these 
instances 
are 
deduced 
by 
the 
same 
polar 
application 
of 
the 
Principle 
of 
Indifference 
(dx 
constant). 
Thus 
it 
is 
mathematically 
proved 
that 
S1 
and 
S2 
are 
nothing 
but 
two 
particular 
cases 
of 
the 


same 
approach: 
while 
S2 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
application 
of 
a 
x-uniformity 
when 
A 
is 
a 
point 
of 
the 


circumference, 
S1 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
application 
of 
the 
same 
x-uniformity 
when 
A 
is 
a 
point 
at 
∞, 
for 


in 
this 
case 
the 
x-uniformity 
implies 
the 
linear 
Y-uniformity). 
Therefore 


-the 
difference 
between 
P1 
and 
P2 
(contrary 
to 
Van 
Fraassen’s 
and 
Hajek’s 
claim) 
cannot 
depend 
on 


the 
application 
of 
the 
Principle 
of 
Indifference 
to 
non-linearly 
related 
parameters, 
because 
both 
of 
them 
are 
simply 
two 
particular 
cases 
of 
the 
situation 
generically 
illustrated 
in 
Figure 
11.1; 
-the 
difference 
between 
P1 
and 
P2 
depends 
on 
the 
fact 
that 
while 
P1 
is 
the 
value 
of 
the 
function 
PX 


when 
X=∞, 
P2 
is 
the 
value 
of 
the 
same 
function 
when 
X=R; 
-there 
is 
nothing 
paradoxical 
in 
ascertaining 
that 
different 
values 
of 
a 
function 
correspond 
to 
different 
values 
of 
its 
argument. 


11.10.1.1. 
Incidentally. 
The 
crucial 
conclusion 
that 
P 
depends 
on 
a 
free 
variable 
is 
also 
valid 
if 
we 
renounce 
the 
assumption 
of 
x-uniformity 
for 
an 
assumption 
of 
x-non-uniformity 
(that 
is 
if 
we 
privilege 
some 
directions). 
Such 
a 
new 
assumption 
entails 
simply 
the 
substitution 
of 
(11.xv) 
or 
(11.xvi) 
by 
more 
complicated 
trigonometric 
expressions 
where 
anyhow 
the 
free 
variable 
continues 
occurring 


because 
P 
continues 
depending 
on 
the 
ratio 
b/a, 
and 
this 
ratio 
continues 
depending 
on 
the 
position 
of 
A. 


11.10.2. 
Coming 
back 
to 
the 
assumption 
of 
x-uniformity 
I 
prove 
that 
S3 
is 
vitiated 
by 
a 
geometric 
mistake 
(claim 
II) 
of 
§9). 

First 
of 
all 
I 
reason 
in 
compliance 
with 
S1 
(X=∞). 
In 
this 
case 
OT 
is 
perpendicular 
to 
OA, 
the 
points 
M, 
F, 
T 
are 
aligned 
and 
M 
is 
also 
the 
mid-point 
of 
OT. 
If 
F 
belongs 
to 
OM, 
the 
length 
of 
the 
respective 


chord 
is 
>R√3, 
and 
if 
F 
belongs 
to 
MT, 
the 
length 
of 
the 
respective 
chord 
is 
<R√3. 
Therefore, 
since 
OM=MT 
and 
since 
the 
geometric 
situation 
holds 
for 
whatever 
basic 
direction 
(it 
does 
not 
depend 
on 
the 
specific 
direction 
OA), 
P1=1/2. 


Now 
I 
reason 
in 
compliance 
with 
S3. 
Since 
each 
chord 
whose 
length 
is 
>R√3 
(<R√3) 
has 
a 
mid-point 
internal 
(external) 
to 
the 
concentric 
circle 
with 
radius 
R/2, 
the 
probability 
that 
a 
chord 
is 
longer 
than 


R√3 
is 
the 
probability 
of 
its 
mid-point 
being 
in 
the 
internal 
circle. 
And 
since 
the 
ratio 
between 
the 
areas 
of 
two 
circles 
whose 
radii 
are 
respectively 
R/2 
and 
R 
is 
1/4, 
we 
must 
conclude 
that 
the 
respective 
probability 
P3 
is 
not 
1/2, 
but 
1/4. 
Here 
too 
Van 
Fraassen’s 
and 
Hajek’s 
claim 
is 
not 
a 
solution 
because 
here 
too 
both 
approaches 
follow 
from 
the 
same 
assumption 
of 
x-uniformity 
(the 
same 
sheaf 
leading 
to 
P1 
if 
we 
reason 
on 
intersections 


with 
OT 
leads 
to 
P3 
if 
we 
reason 
on 
mid-points). 
The 
right 
solution 
follows 
immediately 
as 
soon 
as 
we 


realize 
the 
logical 
error 
affecting 
S3. 
In 
fact 
S3 
grounds 
on 
an 
implicit 
postulate, 
that 
is 
a 
one-to-one 


correspondence 
between 
chords 
and 
mid-points: 
but 
such 
a 
postulate 
is 
wrong 
because 
actually 
every 
chord 
has 
one 
and 
only 
one 
mid-point, 
and 
every 
point 
of 
the 
circle 
(except 
O) 
is 
the 
mid-point 
of 
one 
and 
only 
one 
chord, 
but 
O 
is 
the 
mid-point 
of 
infinite 
chords 
(diameters), 
therefore 
P3=1/4 
is 
an 
erroneous 
and 
underestimated 
value 
(which 
from 
now 
on 
will 
be 
neglected). 


11.11. 
All 
these 
considerations, 
strictly, 
could 
lead 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
the 
problem 
proposed 
by 
(11.xii) 
is 
indeterminate 
for 
lack 
of 
a 
datum. 
In 
fact 
(11.xviii) 
Let 
O 
be 
the 
centre 
and 
R 
the 
radius 
of 
a 
circle; 
in 
conditions 
of 
parametric 
uniformity, 
what 
is 
the 
probability 
P 
that 
a 
chord 
passing 
for 
a 
point 
A 
at 
a 
distance 
X 
from 
O 
be 
longer 
than 
R√3? 
is 
a 
surely 
determinate 
problem 
and 


(11.xix) 
P 
= 
arc 
sin(R/2X) 
/ 
arc 
sin(R/X) 
is 
its 
unobjectionable 
solution 
(since 
the 
parameter 
to 
which 
the 
Principle 
of 
Indifference 
can 
be 
applied 
is 
only 
one, 
that 
is 
x, 
no 
ambiguity 
affects 
the 
application 
of 
the 
same 
Principle). 
On 
the 
grounds 
of 
(11.xix) 
we 
can 
compute 
whatever 
specific 
value 
of 
P 
(for 
instance 
the 
values 
listed 
in 



(11.xvii)); 
so 
in 
particular 
we 
legitimate 
the 
perfect 
compatibility 
of 
S1 
and 
S2, 
in 
spite 
of 
P1≠P2. 
(the 
indeterminateness 
of 
S1 
and 
S2 
is 
only 
apparent, 
since 
both 
of 
them, 
although 
tacitly, 
fix 
a 
distance, 
that 
is 
∞ 
and 
R, 
so 
making 


computable 
the 
respective 
probabilistic 
values). 
Nevertheless, 
the 
following 
puzzle 
is 
pending. 


11.11.1. 
Let 
us 
draw 
the 
most 
casual 
and 
rich 
interlacement 
of 
straight 
lines 
over 
a 
circle, 
and 
let 
us 
compute 
the 
per 
cent 
of 
chords 
whose 
length 
is 
>R√3. 
The 
author 
who 
performed 
systematically 
this 
2

experiment 
[Jaines 
1973] 
reports 
he 
achieved 
results 
with 
an 
embarassingly 
low 
value 
of 
c 
, 
that 
is 
he 
achieved 
highly 
converging 
arithmetical 
values 
of 
such 
a 
per 
cent, 
that 
is 
50% 
(and, 
modestly, 
I 
can 
confirm 
both 
the 
convergence 
and 
the 
value). 
The 
puzzle 
is 
manifest: 
we 
empirically 
give 
a 
univocal 
and 
sound 
answer 
to 
an 
indeterminate 
problem. 


In 
order 
to 
overcome 
such 
a 
puzzle, 
firstly 
we 
have 
to 
realize 
that 
under 
a 
more 
liberal 
interpretation, 
(11.xii) 
can 
be 
read 
as 
a 
shortened 
formulation 
appealing 
(implicitly, 
of 
course) 
to 
some 
average 
value 
of 
P. 
Under 
this 
more 
liberal 
interpretation, 
the 
problem 
proposed 
by 
(11.xii) 
is 
no 
longer 
indeterminate, 
since 
an 
average 
of 
various 
values 
is 
a 
single 
value. 
Yet 
in 
order 
to 
compute 
the 
average 
we 
need 
a 
density 
function 
for 
the 
various 
specific 
positions 
of 
A, 
that 
is 
for 
the 
various 
specific 
values 
resulting 
from 
the 
application 
of 
(11.xix). 
Here 
too 
the 
Principle 
of 
Indifference 
suggests 
us 
to 
adopt 
a 
criterion 
of 
uniformity; 
yet 
here 
the 
suggestion 
is 
insufficient. 
In 
§10.1, 
once 
fixed 
a 
certain 
position 
of 
A, 
we 
applied 
the 
Principle 
to 
the 
various 
possible 
directions 
of 
the 
chords 


passing 
through 
A, 
therefore 
to 
the 
parameter 
x. 
But 
any 
given 
position 
of 
A 
corresponds 
to 
a 
precise 


value 
both 
of 
the 
linear 
parameter 
X 
and 
of 
the 
polar 
parameter 
b 
(or 
indifferently 
a). 
As 
such 
we 


must 
decide 
if 
the 
parametric 
uniformity 
suggested 
by 
the 
Principle 
of 
Indifference 
is 
a 
linear 
uniformity 
(the 
various 
distances 
X 
are 
equiprobable) 
or 
a 
polar 
uniformity 
(the 
various 
angles 
b 
are 
equiprobable). 
The 
decision 
is 
momentous 
because, 
generally 
speaking, 
a 
linear 
uniformity 
does 
not 
imply 
a 
polar 
uniformity, 
and 
in 
this 
case 
it 
implies 
a 
polar 
non-uniformity. 
I 
make 
my 
point 
clearer 
through 
a 
geometrically 
similar 
example. 


Let 
ABC 
be 
a 
right-angled 
triangle 
having 
the 
cathetus 
AB 
of 
unitary 
length 
and 
the 
angle 
g 
in 
C 
of 
60° 
(therefore 
the 
hypotenuse 
BC 
is 
2/√3 
and 
AC 
is 
1/√3); 
let 
D 
be 
the 
point 
where 
the 
bisector 
of 
g 
intersects 
AB. 
The 
probability 
that 
a 
generic 
point 
Y 
of 
AB 
belongs 
to 
AD 
is 
by 
hypothesis 
1/2 
if 
we 
reason 
on 
angles, 
that 
is 
if 
we 
apply 
the 
parametric 
uniformity 
to 
the 
generic 
angle 
q 
between 
CA 
and 
CY, 
but 
it 
is 
1/3 
if 
we 
reason 
on 
segments, 
that 
is 
if 
we 
apply 
the 
parametric 
uniformity 
to 
the 
distance 
AY 
(AD=1/3, 
BD=2/3). 
No 
paradox, 
of 
course. 
Postulating 
the 
q-equiprobability 
(i.e.: 
dq=constant) 
means 
postulating 
the 
equiprobability 
of 
each 
non-constant 
linear 
interval 
tg(q+dq)-tgq 
on 
AB. 
Thus 
an 
example 
of 
discrepancy 
between 
polar 
and 
linear 
uniformity 
is 
exhibited 


Of 
course 
there 
are 
geometrical 
contexts 
where 
linear 
and 
polar 
uniformities 
correspond 
(an 
elementary 
example 
is 
a 
point 
running 
on 
a 
circumference 
and 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
respective 
radius). 
Yet, 
manifestly, 
Figure 
11.1 
shows 
that 
in 
the 
situation 
under 
scrutiny 
tg(b+db)-tgb 
is 
a 
non



constant 
linear 
interval. 
Therefore 
the 
average 
we 
obtain 
by 
applying 
the 
linear 
uniformity 
must 
differ 
from 
the 
average 
we 
obtain 
by 
applying 
the 
polar 
uniformity.. 
Concisely: 
wherever 
a 
linear 
equiprobability 
implies 
a 
polar 
heteroprobability 
(and 
vice 
versa, 
obviously), 
a 
very 
paradox 
would 
arise 
only 
if 
those 
two 
different 
criteria 
should 
lead 
us 
to 
the 
same 
probabilistic 
assignation. 


The 
three 
following 
arguments 
tell 
us 
that 
in 
this 
context 
the 
linear 
uniformity 
is 
the 
right 
choice. 


11.11.1.1. 
A 
polar 
uniformity 
entails 
a 
sort 
of 
spacial 
rarefaction, 
so 
to 
say, 
because 
as 
X 
increases 
a 
progressively 
longer 
dX 
corresponds 
to 
the 
same 
db 
(until 
an 
infinite 
dX 
where 
b+db=0°) 
But 
when 
we 
draw 
the 
mentioned 
interlacement 
of 
straight 
lines, 
quite 
independently 
of 
its 
position 
on 
the 
plane 
every 
point 
has 
the 
same 
chance 
of 
becoming 
a 
point 
on 
a 
randomly 
drawn 
straight 
line 
(the 
space 
we 
move 
into 
does 
not 
rarefy). 


11.11.1.2. 
While 
the 
empirical 
value 
is 
50%, 
the 
mathematical 
average 
corresponding 
to 
a 
polar 
uniformity 
is 
nearly 
46,6% 
(very 
roughly 
, 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
any 
appeal 
to 
integral 
calculi, 
we 
can 
simply 
remark 
that 
the 
middle 
b 
is 
15°). 
The 
discrepancy 
between 
50% 
and 
46,6% 
is 
just 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
above 
denounced 
linear 
rarefaction 
entailed 
by 
the 
polar 
uniformity. 


11.11.1.3. 
The 
mathematical 
average 
corresponding 
to 
a 
linear 
uniformity 
is 
just 
50% 
since 
it 
identifies 
with 
the 
value 
for 
X®∞ 
(very 
roughly: 
the 
mid-point 
of 
a 
semi-straight 
is 
at 
∞). 
11.11.2. 
A 
subtle 
objection 
runs 
as 
follows. 
Jaines 
(and 
Gandolfi) 
were 
mistaken, 
as 
the 
same 
(11.xvii) 
shows 
that 
in 
an 
actually 
random 
set 
of 
chords 
P=50% 
is 
an 
unattainable 
average. 
In 
fact, 
once 
the 
interlacement 
of 
straight 
lines 
is 
drawn, 
let 
us 
classify 
the 
set 
of 
chords 
by 
couples 
of 
non-parallel 
straight 
lines; 
then 
if 
Aj 
is 
the 
intersection 
of 
the 
generic 
j-couple 
and 
Xj 
is 
its 
(finite) 
distance 
from 
O, 


a 
look 
at 
(11.xvii) 
shows 
that 
anyhow 
Pj<50%; 
therefore 
it 
is 
mathematically 
impossible 
to 
obtain 
50% 


as 
an 
average 
of 
values 
<50%. 
Reply. 
The 
objection 
does 
not 
hold 
because 
-either 
we 
do 
not 
account 
for 
the 
couples 
whose 
intersections 
are 
inside 
the 
circumference 
(x<R), 
therefore 
actually 
P<50%, 
but 
it 
concerns 
only 
a 
subset 
of 
the 
chords 
we 
have 
drawn, 
-or 
we 
do 
account 
for 
all 
the 
couples, 
and 
then 
we 
must 
recognize 
that 
the 
couples 
of 
chords 
whose 
Aj 
are 
inside 
the 
circumference 
have 
a 
Pj>50% 


(P=666% 
where 
R>AjO>R/2, 
and 
P=90% 
where 
R/2≥ 
AjO); 
therefore 
an 
average 
P=50% 
is 
quite 
possible. 


11.11.3. 
In 
conclusion. 
Since 
every 
chord 
has 
a 
direction, 
since 
no 
chord 
has 
more 
than 
one 
direction, 
since 
these 
obvious 
evidences 
do 
not 
depend 
on 
some 
peculiar 
direction, 
to 
classify 
the 
set 
of 
chords 
by 
parallels 
means 
to 

exhaust 
it 
without 
omissions 
and 
duplications. 
Therefore 
S1 
is 
the 
unexceptionable 
approach 
and 
P1 
is 
the 
unexceptionable 
probabilistic 
value. 


A 
last 
objection. 
If 
also 
from 
the 
experimental 
viewpoint 
P1 
is 
the 
unexceptionable 
probabilistic 
value, 
then 
P2 
is 
experimentally 
unjustifiable. 
Reply. 
The 
geometric 
context 
leading 
to 
P1 
(§11.1: 
the 
most 
casual 
and 
rich 
interlacement 
of 
straight 
lines) 
is 
evidently 
unfit 
for 
S2, 
where 
all 
the 
straight 
lines 
ought 
to 
intersect 
at 
a 
single 
point 
(belonging 
to 
the 
circumference, 
furthermore). 
And 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
draw 
a 
sheaf 
complying 
with 
S2 
we 
get 
the 
empiric 
confirmation 
of 
P2. 
In 
other 
words: 
P1 
and 
P2 
are 
connected 
to 
two 
different 
‘metrics’ 
(that 
is 


two 
incompatible 
geometric 
contexts), 
and 
it 
is 
not 
at 
all 
puzzling 
that 
two 
structurally

CHAPTER 
12 
CONFIRMATION 


12.1. 
I 
claim 
(a) 
that 
what 
is 
nowadays 
considered 
the 
canonical 
Bayesian 
position 
on 
Hempel’s 
paradox 
is 
incomplete, 
since 
it 
examines 
only 
one 
among 
many 
possible 
alternatives; 
(b) 
that 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
examined 
alternative 
and 
the 
consequent 
solution 
are 
misleading 
(c) 
that 
there 
is 
an 
exhaustive 
solution 
whose 
conclusions 
comply 
punctually 
with 
our 
intuition. 
Since, 
in 
order 
to 
report 
the 
canonical 
Bayesian 
position, 
I 
make 
reference 
to 
Howson 
and 
Urbach’s 
work 
listed 
in 
Bibliography 
(from 
now 
on: 
H&U), 
I 
accept 
their 
notational 
conventions, 
although 
I 
dissent 
from 
a 
symbology 
where 
the 
probability 
is 
sometimes 
monadic 
(unconditional) 
and 
sometimes 
dyadic 
(conditional). 
12.2. 
First 
of 
all, 
I 
define 
by 
(12.i) 
We,h 
= 
P(h|e) 
– 
P(h) 
that 
is, 
in 
my 
symbology, 
(12.i*) 
Wk’,k°,h 
= 
P(h|k°&k’) 
– 
P(h|k°) 
the 
confirmation 
value 
of 
evidence 
e 
on 
a 
hypothesis 
h, 
(the 
confirmation 
value 
of 
an 
acquirement 
k’ 


on 
a 
hypothesis 
h, 
given 
a 
basic 
statute 
k°) 
and 
I 
say 
that 
e 
validates 
h 
(invalidates 
h; 
is 
uninfluential 


upon 
h), 
iff 
We,h>0 
(iff 
We,h<0; 
iff 
We,h=0). 
So, 
according 
to 
(12.i), 
not 
only 
“to 
validate”, 
but 
also 
“to 
invalidate” 
and 
“to 
be 
uninfluential” 
express 
values 
of 
confirmation 
(ranging 
from 
-1 
to 
+1). 
In 
§13.5.2.1 
a 
representation 
of 
confirmation 
values 
will 
be 
sketched. 


12.3. 
Hempel’s 
paradox 
is 
well 
known. 
Briefly. 
Nicod’s 
postulate, 
applied 
to 
the 
classical 
example, 
states 
that 
a 
hypothesis 
like 
(12.ii) 
All 
Rs 
are 
B 
(all 
ravens 
are 
black) 
is 
validated 
by 
evidence 
of 
something 
that 
is 
both 
R 
and 
B. 
Then, 
since 
the 
unexceptionable 
Principle 
of 
Equivalence 
states 
that 
any 
evidence 
has 
the 
same 
confirmation 
value 
on 
logically 
equivalent 
hypotheses, 
and 
since 
by 
Modus 
Tollens 
(12.ii) 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
to 


(12.iii) 
All 
~Bs 
are 
~R 
evidence 
of 
a 
~B~R 
(of 
a 
grey 
pistol 
GP, 
say) 
ought 
to 
validate 
(12.ii); 
a 
conclusion 
which 
indeed 
hurts 
our 
common 
sense. 



12.4. 
The 
deep 
incompatibilities 
among 
the 
various 
theories 
of 
probability 
regard 
many 
aspects 
of 
the 
matter 
(the 
philosophical 
approach, 
the 
Principle 
of 
Indifference, 
the 
problem 
of 
inductive 
generalizations 
and 
so 
on); 
but, 
as 
far 
as 
I 
know, 
they 
do 
not 
regard 
the 
logical 
and 
mathematical 
structure. 
In 
particular 
no 
one 
denies 
the 
validity 
of 
Bayes’s 
theorem, 
since 
it 
is 
formally 
derivable 
from 
universally 
accepted 
axioms. 
In 
this 
sense 
speaking 
of 
the 
Bayesian 
position 
seems 
to 
me 
rather 
misleading; 
how 
could 
we 
legitimate 
an 
anti-Bayesian 
position? 
In 
this 
sense, 
then, 
I 
think 
it 
would 
be 
better 
to 
speak 
of 
a 
strictly 
axiomatic 
approach. 
12.4.1. 
Since 
Bayes’s 
Theorem 
(H&U, 
p.21) 
states 
that 
(12.iv) 



we 
can 
formally 
derive 


P(h|e) 
> 
P(h) 
iff 
P(e|h) 
> 
(P(h)P(e|h) 
+ 
P(~h)P(e|~h)) 


that 
is 
iff 


P(e|h) 
>(1-P(~h))P(e|h)) 
+ 
P(~h)P(e|~h)) 


that 
is 
iff 


P(e|h) 
>P(e|h)-P(~h)P(e|h)) 
+ 
P(~h)P(e|~h)) 


therefore 


(12.v) 
P(h|e) 
> 
P(h) 
iff 
P(e|h) 
> 
P(e|~h)) 
(obviously 
P(e|h) 
> 
P(e|~h)). 
implies 
P(~h)P(e|h)) 
> 
P(~h)P(e|~h)). 


In 
our 
specific 
case 
(12.v) 
becomes 


(12.vi) 
P(h|RB) 
> 
P(h) 
iff 
P(RB|h) 
> 
P(RB|~h)) 
and 
the 
formal 
derivation 
above 
proves 
that 
(12.v) 
and 
(12.vi) 
are 
theorems, 
that 
is 
unobjectionable 
achievements. 
Furthermore, 
since 
analogous 
derivations 
can 
be 
re-proposed 
where 
“>” 
is 
replaced 
by 
“<” 
or 
by 
“=”, 
we 
can 
conclude 
that 
evidence 
of 
a 
black 
raven 
validates 
(invalidates, 
is 
uninfluential 


upon) 
the 
hypothesis 
h 
that 
all 
ravens 
are 
black 
iff 
such 
evidence 
is 
more 
(less, 
equally) 
probable 
under 


h 
than 
under 
~h. 
Yet 
Nicod’s 
postulate 
omits 
the 
conditioning 
clause 
(in 
the 
case 
under 
scrutiny 
it 
reduces 
(12.vi) 
to 
its 
first 
member) 
and 
as 
such 
it 
is 
valid 
only 
in 
those 
contexts 
where 
the 
same 
conditioning 
clause 
is 
satisfied. 
And 
simply 
because, 
roughly, 
the 
assumption 
that 
observing 
a 
black 



raven 
is 
more 
probable 
if 
all 
ravens 
are 
black 
seems 
plausible 
(here 
is 
the 
second 
member 
of 
(12.vi)), 
Nicod’s 
postulate, 
roughly, 
seems 
correct. 
Nevertheless, 
simply 
because 
discordant 
contexts 
(that 
is 
contexts 
where 
the 
second 
member 
of 
(12.vi) 
is 
not 
valid) 
are 
possible 
(although 
less 
plausible), 
Nicod’s 
postulate 
cannot 
constitute 
a 
general 
rule 
for 
a 
systematic 
approach 
to 
the 
matter. 


12.4.2. 
The 
general 
rule 
is 
inferred 
by 
(12.v) 
and 
runs 
as 
follows: 
(12.vii) 
Evidence 
of 
something 
that 
is 
both 
X 
and 
Y 
validates 
(invalidates, 
is 
uninfluential 
upon) 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
all 
Xs 
are 
Y, 
iff 
the 
eventual 
presence 
of 
some 
X~Y 
decreases 
(increases, 
does 
not 


change) 
the 
probability 
of 
observing 
a 
XY. 


In 
its 
turn, 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
realize 
that 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
to 
restrict 
the 
evidence 
to 
the 
observation 
of 
a 
XY. 
(12.vii) 
can 
be 
furtherly 
generalized 
in 


(12.viii) 
An 
evidence 
validates 
(invalidates, 
is 
uninfluential 
upon) 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
all 
Xs 
are 
Y 
iff 
the 
eventual 
presence 
of 
some 
X~Y 
decreases 
(increases, 
does 
not 
change) 
the 
probability 
of 
the 
same 
evidence 


The 
fundamental 
point 
is 
that 
Nicod’s 
postulate, 
(12.vii) 
and 
(12.viii) 
do 
not 
have 
the 
same 
rank: 
while 
the 
former 
is 
a 
questionable 
supplementary 
proposal, 
(12.vii) 
and 
(12.viii) 
are 
unquestionable 
achievements 
inferred 
by 
universally 
accepted 
axioms. 


12.4.3. 
The 
inversion 
between 
the 
roles 
of 
h 
and 
e 
showed 
by 
(12.v) 
is 
momentous: 
a 
problem 
of 
confirmation 
can 
be 
solved 
without 
any 
collation 
between 
the 
probabilities 
of 
h 
ante 
and 
post 
the 
acquirement 
of 
e, 
since 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
collate 
the 
probability 
of 
e 
under 
h 
and 
the 
probability 
of 
e 
under 
~h. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
explicitly 
and 
formally 
ascertained 
that 
every 
problem 
of 
confirmation 
concerns 
the 
collation 
between 
two 
incompatible 
universes 
which 
differ 
with 
respect 
to 
h 
or 
~h. 
It 
is 
understood 
that 
I 
speak 
of 
two 
universes 
without 
any 
ontological 
implication. 
We 
have 
to 
remember 
the 
general 
scenery 
of 
reference. 
The 
universe 
we 
are 
living 
in 
is 
the 
only 
real 
universe; 
but 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
ask 
ourselves 
about 
the 
problem 
under 
scrutiny, 
we 
must 
compare 
two 
incompatible 
configurations 
and 
the 
probabilities 
of 
observing 
a 
black 
raven 
in 
each 
of 
them. 
12.4.4. 
In 
empirical 
practice, 
the 
probability 
of 
observing 
a 
certain 
individual 
in 
our 
real 
universe 
depends 
on 
hundreds 
of 
parameters, 
yet, 
in 
order 
not 
to 
complicate 
the 
discourse 
with 
contingencies 
of 
no 
theoretical 
moment, 
I 
assume 
-that 
a 
number 
is 
assigned 
to 
every 
individual 
of 
the 
universal 
population 
to 
which 
the 
reasoning 
is 
referred 
-that 
the 
numerical 
output 
of 
an 
opportunely 
programmed 
computer 
indicates 
the 
observed 
individual 

-that 
the 
outputs 
are 
equiprobable, 
so 
that 
the 
probability 
of 
observing 
an 
individual 
belonging 
to 
a 
certain 
set 
is 
directly 
proportional 
to 
the 
cardinality 
of 
the 
same 
set. 
These 
assumptions 
are 
of 
no 
theoretical 
moment 
since 
Hempel’s 
paradox 
can 
be 
exactly 
re-proposed 
even 
under 
them. 


12.5. 
The 
intuitive 
understanding 
of 
my 
analysis 
can 
be 
helped 
by 
an 
easy 
representation 
where 
the 
various 
configurations 
are 
represented 
by 
circles 
partitioned 
in 
sectors: 
one 
circle 
for 
each 
configuration, 
one 
sector 
for 
each 
set 
of 
individuals. 
Let 
me 
emphasize 
that 
this 
representation 
is 
simply 
an 
adaptation 
of 
Eulerian 
circles 
(Venn’s 
diagrams); 
contrary 
to 
our 
usual 
Ò, 
it 
is 
intrinsically 
extensional. 
Yet, 
since 
for 
the 
moment 
I 
am 
mainly 
interested 
in 
the 
clearness 
of 
the 
diagrams 
and 
of 
their 
collations, 
the 
areas 
of 
the 
various 
sectors 
have 
a 
merely 
qualitative 
course; 
the 
only 
areal 
dependences 
are 
-an 
empty 
set 
is 
represented 
by 
a 
null 
sector 
-although 
the 
area 
of 
a 
sector 
increases 
(decreases) 
with 
the 
cardinality 
of 
the 
represented 
set, 
no 
direct 
proportionality 
exists 
between 
areas 
and 
cardinalities. 


So 
for 
instance 
the 
RB-sector 
of 
Figure 
12.0 



is 
greater 
by 
far 
than 
the 
quantitatively 
correct 
one 
(black 
ravens 
are 
not 
a 
quarter 
of 
all 
the 
individuals). 
Figure 
12.0 
represents 
the 
basic 
configuration 
Ω°, 
that 
is 
the 
h–compatible 
configuration 
where 
all 
ravens 
are 
black 
(no 
R~B-sector). 
Of 
course 
there 
are 
many 
different 
~h-compatible 
configurations. 
In 
some 
of 
them 
the 
RB-set 
is 
smaller 
than 
in 
Ω° 
(the 
sector 
representing 
such 
a 
set 
is 
smaller 
than 
in 
Figure 
12.0), 
and 
as 
such 
evidence 
of 
a 
black 
raven 
validates 
h. 
In 
others 
the 
RB-set 
is 
greater 
than 
in 
Ω° 
(…) 
and 
as 
such 
evidence 
of 
a 
black 
raven 
invalidates 
h. 
In 
the 
remainder 
the 
RB-sector 
is 
the 
same 
of 
Ω° 
(…) 
and 
as 
such 
evidence 
of 
a 
black 
raven 
is 
uninfluential 
upon 
h. 
Therefore, 
since 
a 
problem 
of 
confirmation 
is 
represented 
by 
the 
comparison 
between 
two 
figures, 
the 
specification 
of 
the 
~hcompatible 
configuration 
to 
be 
collated 
with 
Ω° 
is 
indispensable. 


12.5.1. 
Once 
assumed 
that 
Ω° 
is 
the 
basic 
configuration 
where 
(12.ix) 
All 
ravens 
are 
black 
the 
privileged 
configuration 
where 
(12.x) 
Not 
all 
ravens 
are 
black 
is 
suggested 
by 
the 
same 
formulation 
of 
(12.ix) 
and 
(12.x); 
in 
fact 
the 
opposition 
between 
the 
“all” 
of 
(12.ix) 
and 
the 
“not 
all” 
of 
(12.x) 
suggests 
the 
reference 
to 
a 
same 
domain 
of 
quantification. 
Therefore 
we 
are 
induced 
to 
think 
of 
a 
common 
set 
of 
ravens 
without 
involving 
other 
(and 
not 
even 
named) 

categories 
of 
individuals. 
In 
other 
words, 
under 
their 
most 
spontaneous 
interpretation 
(12.ix) 
and 
(12.x) 
propose 
a 
dilemma 
whose 
empirical 
solution 
consists 
in 
examining 
the 
colour 
of 
any 
raven 
belonging 
to 
a 
previously 
given 
set. 
Figure 
12.1 
represents 
just 
this 
configuration 
Ω1 
which 
differs 
from 
Ω° 
only 


because 
in 
Ω1 
the 
ravens-sector 
of 
W° 
is 
now 
partitioned 
in 
an 
RB 
sector 
and 
in 
an 
R~B–sector. 


Under 
such 
an 
interpretation, 
since 
in 
Figure 
12.0 
(where 
h) 
the 
RB-sector 
is 
greater 
than 
in 
Figure 


12.1 
(where 
~h), 
evidence 
of 
a 
black 
raven 
validates 
h. 
12.5.2. 
If 
all 
ravens 
are 
black, 
all 
non-black 
individuals 
are 
non-ravens 
(Modus 
Tollens). 
Therefore 
also 
(12.xi) 
All 
non-black 
individuals 
are 
non-ravens 
is 
true 
under 
Ω° 
(actually 
Figure 
12.0 
respects 
(12.xi)). 
Nevertheless 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
considerations 
proposed 
in 
§12.5.1 
are 
applied 
to 
the 
opposition 
between 
(12.xi) 
and 


(12.xii) 
Not 
all 
non-black 
individuals 
are 
non-ravens 
we 
realize 
that, 
contrary 
to 
(12.ix) 
and 
(12.x) 
where 
“all” 
and 
“not 
all” 
refer 
to 
the 
set 
of 
ravens, 
in 
(12.xi) 
and 
(12.xii) 
“all” 
and 
“not 
all” 
refer 
to 
the 
set 
of 
non-black 
individuals 
and 
that, 
therefore, 
the 
most 
spontaneous 
interpretation 
leads 
to 
the 
configuration 
Ω2 
represented 
in 
Figure 
12.2 
that 
is 
the 
configuration 
which 
differs 
from 
Ω° 
because 
some 
non-black 
raven 
takes 
the 
place 
of 
some 
non-black 
non-raven. 
In 
other 
words, 
under 
their 
most 
spontaneous 
interpretation, 
(12.xi) 
and 
(12.xii) 
propose 
a 
dilemma 
whose 
empirical 
solution 
consists 
in 
examining 
a 
previously 
given 
set 
of 
non-black 
individuals 
in 
order 
to 
ascertain 
if 
any 
among 
them 
is 
a 
raven. 
The 
figures 
make 
immediately 
evident 
that 
while 
Nicod’s 
criterion 
in 
the 
formulation 
(12.ii) 
is 
valid 


with 
reference 
to 
(Ω°, 
Ω1) 
for 
the 
number 
of 
black 
ravens 
(the 
area 
of 
the 
RB-sector) 
is 
greater 
in 
Ω° 


than 
in 
Ω1, 
the 
same 
criterion 
is 
not 
valid 
with 
reference 
to 
(Ω°, 
Ω2) 
for 
the 
number 
of 
black 
ravens 


(the 
area 
of 
the 
RB-sector) 
is 
the 
same 
in 
Ω° 
and 
in 
Ω2. 
Reciprocally, 
while 
Nicod’s 
criterion 
in 
the 


formulation 
(12.iii) 
is 
valid 
with 
reference 
to 
(Ω°, 
Ω2), 
it 
is 
not 
valid 
with 
reference 
to 
(Ω°, 
Ω1). 
On 
the 
contrary 
(12.vii) 
and 
(12.viii) 
are 
always 
valid. 


12.5.3. 
Incidentally. 
While 
(12.ix) 
and 
(12.x) 
are 
introduced 
by 
merely 
emphasizing 
new 
lines, 
(12.xi) 
and 
(12.xii) 
are 
introduced 
by 
hyperlinguistic 
new 
lines 
(… 
is 
true 
under 
Ω°…); 
furthermore 
they 
all 
are 
metalinguistically 
recycled 
(… 
the 
“all” 
…). 



12.6. 
As 
for 
our 
problem 
(let 
me 
reason 
directly 
on 
the 
representation), 
the 
numerous 
diagrams 
Ωi 
resulting 
from 
the 
various 
tetrapartitions 
of 
a 
circle 
in 
the 
four 
sectors 
representing 
BR, 
B~R, 
R~B 
and 


~R~B, 
can 
be 
classified 
in 
compliance 
with 
their 
respective 
confirmation 
values, 
that 
is 
in 
compliance 


with 
the 
areal 
ratios 
of 
homologous 
sectors 
in 
Ω° 
and 
in 
Ωj. 
So, 
for 
instance, 
an 
easy 
collation 
between 
Figure 
12.0 
and 
Figure 
12.3 
shows 
that 
the 
latter 
represents 
a 
configuration 
where 


P(RB|h) 
> 
P(RB|~h) 


P(R~B|h) 
< 
P(R~B|~h) 
(in 
particular 
P(R|h) 
= 
P(R|~h)) 
P(~R~B|h) 
> 
P(~R~B|~h) 
P(B~R|h) 
< 
P(B~R|~h) 


(in 
particular 
P(~B|h) 
= 
P(~B|~h)). 
Analogously 
Figure 
12.4 



represents 
a 
configuration 
where 


P(RB|h) 
< 
P(RB|~h) 


P(R~B|h) 
< 
P(R~B|~h) 
(therefore 
P(R|h) 
< 
P(R|~h)) 
P(~R~B|h) 
> 
P(~R~B|~h) 
P(B~R|h) 
= 
P(B~R|~h) 
(therefore 
P(~B|h) 
< 
P(~B|~h)) 


Figure 
12.5 
represents 
a 
configuration 
where 


P(RB|h) 
> 
P(RB|~h) 


P(R~B|h) 
< 
P(R~B|~h) 
(in 
particular 
P(R|h) 
> 
P(R|~h)) 
P(~R~B|h) 
< 
P(~R~B|~h) 
P(B~R|h) 
= 
P(B~R|~h) 


and 
so 
on. 


12.7. 
In 
order 
to 
connect 
my 
analysis 
with 
the 
solution 
proposed 
by 
Howson 
and 
Urbach 
I 
need 
to 
transform 
unconditional 
probabilities 
into 
conditional 
ones 
and 
vice 
versa. 
This 
task 
is 
accomplished 
by 
the 
equivalence 

(12.xiii) 
(P(R|h) 
= 
P(R)) 
iff 
(P(R|h) 
= 
P(R|~h)) 
whose 
formal 
proof 
follows: 


P(R|h) 
= 
P(R) 
(protasis) 


P(R|h) 
= 
P(R&h)/P(h) 
(definition 
of 
conditional 
probability; 
H&U 
(4) 
p.14) 


P(R&h) 
= 
P(R)P(h) 
(from 
protasis 
and 
definition) 


P(R&h) 
= 
P(R)P(h|R) 
(well 
known 
theorem) 


P(R&~h) 
= 
P(R)P(~h|R) 
(idem) 


P(R&h) 
+ 
P(R&~h) 
= 
P(R) 
(since 
(P(~h) 
= 
1-P(h)) 
P(R)P(h) 
= 
P(R) 
-P(R&~h) 
P(R)(1-P(h)) 
= 
P(R&~h) 
P(R)P(~h) 
= 
P(R&~h) 


P(R)=P(R&~h)/P(~h)=P(R|~h) 
(definition 
of 
conditional 
probability) 


therefore 


if 
P(R|h) 
= 
P(R) 
then 
P(R|h) 
= 
P(R|~h). 


Reciprocally 
P(R|h) 
= 
P(R|~h) 
(protasis) 


(P(R&~h) 
/ 
P(~h)) 
= 
(P(R&h) 
/ 
P(h)) 
(definition 
of 
conditional 
probability) 


P(R&~h)P(h) 
= 
P(R&h)(1-P(h)) 


(P(~h) 
= 
1-P(h)) 
P(R&h) 
= 
P(R&~h)P(h) 
+ 
(P(R&h)P(h) 
= 
P(R)P(h) 
P(R) 
= 
(P(R&h)/ 
P(h) 
= 
(P(R|h) 
(definition 
of 
conditional 
probability) 


therefore 


if 
(P(R|h) 
= 
P(R|~h)) 
then 
(P(R|h) 
= 
P(R)). 


12.8. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
(12.xiii), 
to 
assume, 
as 
Howson 
and 
Urbach 
do 
(last 
lines 
of 
p.100), 
(12.xiv) 
P(R|h) 
= 
P(R) 
means 
to 
assume 
(12.xv) 
P(R|h) 
= 
P(R|~h) 
therefore 
(I 
continue 
reasoning 
directly 
on 
the 
representation) 
it 
means 
to 
admit 
only 
configurations 
where 
the 
R–sector 
(as 
in 
Figure 
12.1 
and 
12.3) 
is 
the 
same 
of 
Figure 
12.0; 
in 
fact 
(12.xiv) 
and 
(12.xv) 


are 
contradicted 
by 
configurations 
where 
(as 
in 
Figure 
12.2 
and 
12.4 
and 
12.5) 
the 
R–sector 
is 
different 
from 
Figure 
12.0. 



12.8.1. 
Yet, 
besides 
(12.xiv), 
Howson 
and 
Urbach 
(second 
line 
of 
p. 
101: 
By 
parallel 
reasoning... 
) 
assume 
(12.xvi) 
P(~B|h)=P(~B) 
so 
that 
(12.xvii) 
(P(R|h)=P(R)) 
& 
P(~B|h)=P(~B) 
is 
their 
total 
assumption. 
This 
means 
that 
the 
~h-configuration 
they 
oppose 
to 
Ω° 
is 
Ω3 
that 
is 
the 
configuration 
represented 
in 
Figure 
12.3, 
where 
-the 
R~B–sector 
is 
non-null, 
thus 
complying 
with 
~h 


-the 
area 
of 
both 
the 
R-sector 
and 
the 
~B-sector 
are 
the 
same 
as 
Ω°, 
thus 
complying 
with 
(12.xvii). 


In 
Ω3 
both 
the 
observation 
of 
a 
black 
raven 
and 
of 
a 
non-black 
non-raven 
validate 
h 
, 
as 
both 
the 
RB– 


sector 
and 
the 
(~R~B)–sector 
are 
greater 
in 
Figure 
12.0 
than 
in 
Figure 
12.3. 
The 
canonical 
Bayesian 
solution 
accepts 
such 
a 
conclusion 
and 
claims 
it 
is 
not 
at 
all 
paradoxical 
because, 
since 
confirmation 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
degree 
(H&U, 
p.100), 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
give 
the 
raven 
sector 
its 


nearly 
infinitesimal 
area 
we 
realize 
that 
the 
h-validation 
by 
a 
~R~B–observation 
(diagrammatically: 
the 


difference 
between 
the 
areas 
of 
the 
two 
~R~B-sectors) 
is 
of 
so 
low 
a 
degree 
as 
to 
be 
intuitively 
imperceptible. 


12.9. 
I 
agree 
with 
the 
claim 
that 
confirmation 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
degree. 
yet 
I 
disagree 
radically 
with 
the 
claim 
that 
the 
solution 
of 
Hempel’s 
paradox 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
degree. 
No 
doubt 
that 
the 
ratio 
1/N 
between 
ravens 
and 
individuals 
of 
the 
universe 
is 
very 
little, 
but 
anyhow 
it 
is 
not 
zero, 
since 
ravens 
do 
exist. 
Therefore 
MN 
observations 
of 
non-black 
non-ravens 
and 
M 
observations 
of 
black 
ravens 
ought 
to 


validate 
h 
at 
the 
same 
degree. 
Which 
is 
not 
the 
case. 
The 
discovery 
of 
a 
huge 
mafia 
armoury 
crammed 


with 
1000N 
grey 
pistols, 
would 
be 
a 
hard 
stroke 
to 
organized 
crime, 
but 
it 
would 
not 
be 
a 
validation 
of 
h, 
neither 
at 
a 
lowest 
degree; 
also 
because, 
if 
it 
were, 
it 
would 
also 
be 
a 
validation 
of 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
all 
dolphins 
are 
trifling 
or 
that 
all 
Messalina’s 
lovers 
were 
brown-haired 
and 
so 
on. 
These 
considerations 
induce 
me 
to 
think 
firmly 
that 
the 
path 
leading 
to 
the 
very 
solution 
of 
Hempel’s 
paradox 
is 
not 
the 
standard 
Bayesian 
one. 


12.10. 
In 
order 
to 
expose 
plainly 
what 
seems 
to 
me 
the 
right 
path, 
let 
me 
imagine 
an 
ornithological 
phenomenon 
entailing 
a 
configuration 
where 
(12.xvii) 
is 
satisfied. 
Some 
mutation 
in 
the 
genoma 
of 
ravens 
resulted 
in 
a 
new 
and 
very 
aggressive 
breed 
of 
black-and-white 
ravens; 
this 
phenomenon 
determined 
a 
chromatic 
disturbance 
in 
the 
neighbouring 
species 
such 
that 
for 
every 
raven 
proceeding 
from 
black 
to 
black-and-white, 
a 
magpie 
proceeded 
from 
black-and-white 
to 
black. 
The 
plausibility 
of 
this 
phenomenon 
is 
scarce, 
nevertheless 
its 
scarce 
plausibility, 
far 
from 
weakening 
my 
argument, 
strengthens 
it. 
In 
fact 
the 
solution 
I 
claim 
is 
based 
on 
the 
following 
manifest 
points: 
a) 
the 
set 
of 
non-black 
non-ravens 
is 
extremely 
heterogeneous, 
since 
it 
includes 
pink 
pillows, 
green 
apples, 
white 
freezers, 
yellow 
geishas, 
grey 
pistols, 
blue 
hand-bombs, 
black-and-white 
magpies 
et 
cetera; 
b) 
in 
order 
to 
satisfy 
(12.xvii) 
we 
must 
renounce 
the 
most 
plausible 
way 
out 
(that 
is 
Ω1) 
according 
to 
which 
the 
apparition 
of 
non-black 
ravens 
is 
an 
ornithological 
phenomenon 
confined 
to 
the 
set 
of 
ravens; 



c) 
renouncing 
Ω1 
does 
not 
at 
all 
mean 
renouncing 
the 
conviction 
that 
the 
apparition 
of 
non-black 
ravens 
is 
an 
ornithological 
phenomenon: 
simply 
we 
think 
that 
the 
apparition 
in 
Ω3 
of 
non-black 


ravens, 
instead 
of 
being 
an 
ornithological 
phenomenon 
confined 
to 
the 
set 
of 
ravens 
as 
in 
Ω1, 
is 
an 
ornithological 
phenomenon 
affecting 
also 
individuals 
which 
are 
not 
ravens; 


d) 
under 
this 
condition, 
the 
most 
plausible 
belief 
is 
that 
the 
non-ravens 
affected 
by 
an 
ornithological 
phenomenon 
born 
in 
the 
set 
of 
ravens 
are 
individuals 
of 
the 
neighbouring 
species, 
since 
it 
would 
be 
grotesque 
to 
claim 
that 
a 
mutation 
in 
the 
genoma 
of 
ravens 
determines 
a 
magic 
blackening 
of 
some 
grey 
pistols 
or 
pink 
pillows 
et 
cetera; 
e) 
if 
the 
grey 
pistols 
subset 
is 
not 
affected 
by 
the 
eventual 
appearance 
of 
non-black 
ravens, 
evidence 
of 
a 
grey 
pistol 
is 
uninfluential 
upon 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
all 
ravens 
are 
black. 
12.10.1. 
Diagrammatically 
the 
extreme 
heterogeneity 
of 
the 
non-black 
non-ravens 
set 
is 
represented 
by 
a 
partition 
of 
the 
~R~B–sector 
in 
as 
many 
subsectors 
as 
the 
specific 
subsets. 
And 
d) 
tells 
us 
that 
the 
GP-subsector 
representing 
the 
grey 
pistols 
of 
Ω3 
is 
the 
same 
as 
that 
of 
Ω°, 
therefore 
that 
the 
observation 
of 
a 
grey 
pistol 
is 
uninfluential 
upon 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
all 
ravens 
are 
black 
(so 
legitimating 
also 
under 
Ω3 
my 
position 
about 
the 
mafia 
armoury). 


12.10.2. 
Symbolically. 
I 
recognize 
that 
if 
we, 
setting 
aside 
any 
consideration 
of 
plausibility, 
accept 
(12.xvii) 
(12.xviii) 
P(~R~B|h) 
> 
P(~R~B|~h) 
is 
unobjectionably 
valid; 
nevertheless 
(12.xviii), 
far 
from 
entailing 
the 
grotesque 


(12.xix) 
P(GP|h) 
> 
P(GP|~h) 
strongly 
suggests 


P(GP|h) 
= 
P(GP|~h) 


that 
is, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
(12.v) 
and 
(12.xiii), 


(12.xx) 
P(h|GP) 
= 
P(h) 
and 
(12.xx), 
through 
(12.i), 
implies 
WGP,h 
= 
0. 


12.10.3. 
My 
solution 
also 
explains 
why, 
under 
(12.xvii), 
ascertaining 
that 
the 
black-and-white 
vest 
over 
yonder 
is 
a 
football 
jersey 
provides 
us 
with 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
uninfluential 
upon 
h, 
while 
ascertaining 
that 
the 
black-and-white 
bird 
over 
yonder 
is 
a 
magpie 
provides 
us 
with 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
validating 
h. 


12.10.4. 
Let 
me 
imagine 
a 
universe 
whose 
members 
are 
only 
ravens, 
magpies 
and 
pistols. 
The 
argument 
based 
on 
the 
degree 
of 
confirmation 
would 
fail, 
but 
the 
paradoxicality 
of 
the 
conclusion 

would 
remain. 
Another 
good 
reason 
for 
rejecting 
the 
standard 
Bayesian 
solution. 


12,11. 
A 
final 
step 
is 
necessary 
to 
overcome 
any 
eventual 
suspicion 
of 
residuary 
paradoxicality. 
Since 
a 
grotesque 
claim 
is 
not 
a 
self-contradictory 
claim, 
somebody 
might 
refuse 
to 
renounce 
(12.xix), 
thus 
legitimating 
a 
configuration 
where 
undoubtedly 
evidence 
of 
a 
grey 
pistol 
validates 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
all 
ravens 
are 
black. 
Would 
then 
the 
paradox 
revive? 
Not 
at 
all. 
A 
paradox 
arises 
only 
when 
its 
disconcerting 
conclusion 
ensues 
from 
non-disconcerting 
premises. 
And 
if 
someone 
is 
so 
credulous 
to 
believe 
(or 
so 
arrogant 
to 
pretend) 
that 
a 
mutation 
in 
the 
chromatic 
gene 
of 
some 
raven 
also 
entails 
a 
counterbalancing 
chromatic 
modification 
in 
the 
metallurgy 
of 
some 
grey 
pistol, 
then 
he 
cannot 
consider 


as 
a 
paradoxical 
result 
that 
evidence 
of 
a 
grey 
pistol 
validates 
h. 
Such 
a 
conclusion 
is 
simply 
the 
due 


consequence 
of 
the 
disconcerting 
premise 
(since 
under 
(12.xix) 
there 
are 
more 
grey 
pistols 
in 
Ω° 
than 


in 
Ω3, 
the 
probability 
of 
observing 
a 
grey 
pistol 
is 
greater 
in 
the 
configuration 
where 
all 
ravens 
are 
black). 


12.12. 
Until 
now, 
in 
order 
to 
follow 
the 
standard 
Bayesian 
solution, 
I 
have 
reasoned 
under 
(12.xvii). 
Yet 
the 
extrapolation 
of 
the 
analysis 
to 
configurations 
where 
(P(R|h) 
≠ 
P(R|~h)) 


or 
where 
(P(~B|h)≠ 
P(~B|~h) 
does 
not 
present 
any 
difficulty. 
For 
instance 
Figure 
12.4 
represents 
a 
configuration 
(Ω4) 
where 


(P(R|h)<P(R|~h))&(P(~B|h)>P(~B|~h)) 
(Ω4 
can 
be 
justified 
by 
supposing 
that 
the 
mentioned 
very 
aggressive 
breed 
of 
black-and-white 
ravens 
carried 
out 
a 
massacre 
of 
the 
neighbouring 
non-black 
species, 
so 
promoting 
a 
proliferation 
of 
black 


ravens). 
Analogously 
Figure 
12.5 
represents 
a 
configuration 
(Ω5) 
where 


(12.xxi) 
(P(R|h) 
> 
P(R|~h)) 
& 
&(P(~B|h) 
< 
P(~B|~h)) 
(Ω5 
can 
be 
justified 
by 
supposing 
that 
the 
aggressivity 
of 
black-and-white 
ravens 
provoked 
so 
violent 
a 
raven-phobic 
reaction 
of 
the 
neighbouring 
non-black 
species 
that 
both 
breeds 
of 
ravens 
are 
at 
the 
risk 
of 
extintion 
while 
the 
non-black 
neighbouring 
species 
are 
proliferating). 
And 
so 
on. 
In 
this 
sense 
my 
approach, 
grounded 
on 
-the 
substitution 
of 
(12.vi) 
or 
(12.vii) 
to 
Nicod’s 
postulate 


-the 
partition 
of 
the 
~R~B–set 
in 
distinct 
subsets 
(categories) 
-the 
disconcerting 
unreasonableness 
of 
the 
hypothesis 
according 
to 
which 
a 
chromatic 
mutation 
in 
some 
ravens 
ought 
to 
determine 
a 
change 
in 
the 
colour 
of 
individuals 
belonging 
to 
absolutely 
far 
categories 
(as 
for 
instance 
grey 
pistols) 
-the 
non-paradoxicality 
of 
a 
disconcerting 
conclusion 
inferred 
by 
disconcerting 
premises, 
allows 
a 
systematic 
analysis 
whose 
results 
are 
in 
full 
accordance 
with 
our 
intuitive 
requirements. 


For 
instance, 
let 
me 
take 
two 
lines 
to 
discuss 
(12.xxi). 
Since 
black 
ravens 
are 
very 
rare 
in 
Ω5, 
evidence 


of 
a 
black 
raven 
validates 
h. 
On 
the 
contrary 
evidence 
of 
a 
non-black 
non-raven, 
owing 
to 
the 


proliferation 
of 
the 
non-black 
neighbouring 
species, 
validates 
~h 
if 
the 
observed 
individual 
belongs 
to 
a 
proliferating 
species 
(a 
magpie, 
say), 
while 
it 
is 
uninfluential 
if 
the 
observed 
individual 
belongs 
to 
an 
unaffected 
ornithological 
species 
(a 
golden 
eagle, 
say) 
or 
even 
more 
if 
the 
observed 
individual 
belongs 
to 
a 
totally 
heterogeneous 
category 
of 
individuals 
(a 
grey 
pistol, 
say). 



CHAPTER 
13 
ACTUAL 
STATUTE 


13.1. 
Undoubtedly 
(13.i) 
how 
can 
we 
prove 
the 
truth 
of 
our 
cognitions? 
is 
the 
basic 
question 
of 
every 
gnosiology. 
The 
well 
known 
sceptic 
answer 
is 
that 
if 
we 
try 
to 
prove 
the 
truth 
of 
our 
cognitions 
we 
meet 
with 
-either 
a 
vicious 
circle 
(diallelus) 


-or 
a 
regressum 
ad 
infinitum 


-or 
some 
apodictically 
postulated 
truth. 
(Münchhausen 
trilemma) 
and 
that 
therefore 
such 
a 
proof 
is 
unattainable. 
I 
think 
that 
a 
more 
constructive 
position 
is 
possible. 


13.1.1. 
The 
coherence 
of 
the 
reality 
we 
live 
in, 
thence 
the 
coherence 
of 
the 
cognitions 
constituting 
any 
actual 
statute 
kact, 
is 
an 
irremovable 
presupposition 
of 
our 
knowledge. 
Yet 
a 
cognition 
about 
a 
world 
does 
not 
entail 
the 
objective 
existence 
of 
the 
same 
world. 
The 
powerful 
faculties 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
allow 
the 
creation 
of 
fictitious 
worlds 
and 
therefore 
the 
possibility 
of 
referring 
alethic 
predicates 
to 
the 
respective 
fictitious 
statutes 
(as, 
say, 
kmyt 
for 
the 
Greek 
mythology). 
This 
notwithstanding, 
a 
peculiar 


rank 
must 
be 
recognized 
to 
kact: 
in 
fact 
a 
fundamental 
asymmetry 
distinguishes 
it 
from 
any 
fictitious 
statute. 
I 
mean 
that, 
for 
instance, 
just 
as 


(13.ii) 
Socrates 
was 
one-headed 
is 
kact-true 
because 
unquestionable 
evidence 
tells 
us 
that 
really 
there 
was 
a 
one-headed 
man 
named 
“Socrates”, 


(13.iii) 
Cerberus 
was 
three-headed 
is 
kmyt-true 
because 
the 
Greek 
mythology 
tells 
us 
that 
the 
portals 
of 
Hades 
were 
guarded 
by 
a 
three-
headed 
dog 
named 
“Cerberus”. 
Analogously, 
just 
as 


(13.iv) 
Socrates 
was 
three-headed 

is 
kact-false, 


(13.v) 
Cerberus 
was 
one-headed 
is 
kmyt-false. 
The 
acceptation 
of 
“true” 
(or 
“false”) 
is 
the 
same 
in 
both 
cases: 
exactly 
as 
stating 
that 


(13.ii) 
is 
kact-true 
(that 
(13.iv) 
is 
kact-false) 
is 
stating 
that 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
under 
scrutiny 
is 
pro-collated 
(anti-collated) 
in 
the 
respective 
statute 
kact, 
stating 
that 
(13.iii) 
is 
kmyt-true 
(that 
(13.v) 
is 
kmyt-false) 
is 
stating 
that 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
under 
scrutiny 
is 
pro-collated 
(anti-collated) 
in 
the 


respective 
statute 
kmyt. 
The 
mentioned 
fundamental 
asymmetry 
is 
that 
fictitious 
statutes 
are, 
so 
to 
say, 
son-statutes 
of 
the 
actual 
mother-statute; 
in 
fact, 
for 
instance, 


(13.iii)* 
in 
the 
Greek 
mythology 
Cerberus 
was 
three-headed 


and 


in 
the 
Greek 
mythology 
Cerberus 
was 
one-headed 


are 
respectively 
kact-true 
and 
kact-false 
because 
unquestionable 
evidence 
tells 
us 
that 
the 
Greek 
mythology 
tells 
us 
that 
et 
cetera.. 


13.2. 
In 
spite 
of 
the 
peculiar 
rank 
we 
assign 
to 
kact, 
the 
real 
existence 
of 
the 
respective 
world 
is 
not 
absolutely 
sure: 
the 
ontological 
dimension 
of 
such 
a 
world 
can 
only 
be 
postulated. 
Personally 
I 
agree 


with 
this 
postulate, 
nevertheless 
a 
margin 
of 
arbitrariness 
survives. 
The 
super-ascertained 
coherence 
of 
the 
huge 
flow 
of 
information 
we 
are 
immersed 
in 
from 
the 
date 
of 
our 
birth 
renders 
probabilistically 
absurd 
thinking 
that 
the 
same 
coherence 
follows 
from 
a 
merely 
casual 
knowledge 
of 
a 
universal 
chaos. 


Yet 
none 
of 
us 
can 
a 
priori 
refuse 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
such 
a 
coherence 
is 
born 
by 
the 
coherent 
but 
deceiving 
intervention 
of 
a 
Superior 
Will. 
How 
could 
I 
peremptorily 
exclude 
that, 
one 
day 
or 
another, 
I 
should 
awake 
in 
an 
ultra-galactic 
laboratory, 
thus 
realizing 
I 
am 
only 
a 
sphere 
of 
intelligent 
matter 
stimulated 
by 
a 
lot 
of 
electrodes? 
All 
my 
life 
was 
only 
a 
virtual 
experience, 
and 
a 
smiling 
God 
in 
a 
bright 
uniform 
asks 
me: 
And 
so? 
What 
about 
the 
objective 
existence 
of 
the 
‘real’ 
world 
you 
believed 
to 
live 
in? 
This 
non-absolute 
sureness, 
nevertheless, 
does 
not 
legitimate 
the 
scepticism 
in 
its 
canonical 
or 
modern 


version 
(Albert 
1985, 
Chapter 
I, 
section 
2), 
because 
(13.i) 
can 
be 
proposed 
even 
under 
such 
a 
non-
absolute 
sureness. 
Anyhow, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
expressive 
simplicity, 
I 
will 
reason 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
stone-age 
metaphysics 
represented 
by 
the 
most 
common 
realism 
(no 
ultra-galactic 
laboratory, 
no 
smiling 
God 
et 
cetera); 
and 
just 
in 
this 
restrained 
sense 
I 
will 
speak 
of 
an 
absolute 
truth. 


13.3. 
In 
the 
current 
practice, 
the 
statute 
of 
reference 
is 
often 
omitted 
even 
where 
it 
is 
not 
the 
actual 
one. 
This 
elliptic 
habit 
may 
find 
a 
justification 
in 
the 
remark 
that, 
usually, 
the 
omitted 
reference 
is 
specified 
by 
the 
context. 
For 
instance 
we 
read 
(13.iii) 
as 
an 
elliptical 
form 
of 
(13.iii)* 
because 
the 
reference 
to 

kmyt 
is 
contextually 
clear. 
Some 
ambiguities 
may 
arise 
where 
actual 
and 
fictitious 
statutes 
overlap. 
Let 
me 
suppose 
that, 
according 
to 
the 
official 
historical 
report, 


(13.vi) 
Vae 
conspiratoribus! 
were 
the 
first 
Marco 
Antonio’s 
words 
after 
Caesar 
was 
stabbed 
to 
death. 
Therefore 
(13.vi) 
is 
the 
right 
answer 
for 
the 
student 
questioned 
by 
his 
history 
teacher 
about 
those 
first 
words. 
But 
since, 
according 
to 
Shakespeare’s 
tragedy, 


(13.vii) 
Friends, 
Romans, 
countrymen 
were 
the 
words 
under 
scrutiny, 
(13.vii) 
is 
the 
right 
answer 
for 
the 
same 
student 
questioned 
by 
his 
English 
literature 
teacher. 
No 
contradiction 
affects 
these 
two 
incompatible 
answers 
to 
the 
same 
question 
because 
the 
two 
teachers 
refer 
to 
different 
(and 
locally 
incompatible) 
statutes 
as 
kact 
and 


kShakespeare 
are. 
Here 
too, 
obviously, 
any 
ambiguity 
disappears 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
existence 
of 
two 
overlapping 
statutes 
is 
focused 
on: 
in 
fact 


According 
to 
Shakespeare’s 
tragedy 
“Friends, 
Romans, 
countrymen” 
were 
the 
first 
Marco 
Antonio’s 


words 
after 
Caesar 
was 
stabbed 
to 
death 


is 
an 
unquestionable 
kact-truth. 


13.3.1. 
Henceforth 
I 
put 
aside 
fictitious 
statutes 
(owing 
to 
their 
reducibility), 
therefore 
the 
index 
can 
be 
omitted. 
Nevertheless, 
since 
different 
knowers 
or 
even 
the 
same 
knower 
at 
different 
“ 
act 
” 
moments 
may 
have 
a 
different 
knowledge 
of 
the 
actual 
world, 
wherever 
there 
is 
the 
risk 
of 
a 
potential 
ambiguity, 
the 
punctual 
reference 
will 
be 
specified 
through 
indexes 
like 
“ 
g 
” 
and 
“ 
t”. 
This 


subordination, 
far 
from 
being 
a 
theoretical 
limit, 
is 
a 
weapon 
to 
refine 
our 
analyses 
wherever, 
say, 
a 
kg 


°t°-truth 
must 
be 
distinguished 
from 
a 
kg°t’-truth 
or 
from 
a 
kg’t°-truth. 
Let 
me 
quote 
§8.8.4: 
contexts 
where 
one 
of 
the 
two 
different 
statutes 
is 
the 
speaker’s 
one 
… 
are 
peculiarly 
insidious. 
Anyhow 
this 
theme 
will 
be 
re-taken 
in 
Appendix 
16. 


13.4. 
An 
alethic 
procedure 
is 
always 
organized 
through 
the 
institutive, 
the 
propositive 
and 
the 
collative 
stages. 
The 
institutive 
stage 
consists 
basically 
in 
the 
sensorial 
perception 
of 
the 
reality 
we 
live 
in. 
Once 
we 
banish 
hallucinations 
(mirages, 
deliriums 
et 
cetera), 
the 
trustworthiness 
of 
our 
sensorial 
perceptions 
is 
assured. 
This 
notwithstanding 
current 
statutes 
(even 
mine!) 
include 
false 
cognitions. 
But 
how 
can 
a 
non-hallucinatory 
sensorial 
cognition 
be 
false? 
13.4.1. 
My 
answer 
runs 
as 
follows. 
Although 
the 
interpretative 
process 
is 
normally 
unrealized 
because 
of 
its 
naturalness 
and 
immediateness, 
our 
usual 
cognitions 
are 
not 
the 
brute 
sensorial 
data, 
but 
the 
pieces 
of 
information 
inferred 
by 
our 
interpretation 
of 
such 
data. 
Therefore 
banishing 
hallucinations 
et 



cetera 
assures 
the 
trustworthiness 
of 
the 
brute 
perceptions, 
but 
of 
course 
it 
cannot 
assure 
the 
trustworthiness 
of 
the 
inferred 
pieces 
of 
information. 
The 
little 
spot 
I 
saw 
squatted 
beneath 
the 
bush 
is 
not 
a 
hallucination, 
yet 
if 
subsequent 
and 
unquestionable 
acquirements 
should 
show 
that 
it 
was 
a 
hare 
I 
would 
be 
compelled 
to 
admit 
that 
my 
previous 
identification 
was 
wrong. 


13.5. 
Once 
the 
coherence 
of 
our 
informational 
flow 
(of 
our 
statute 
in 
progress) 
is 
assumed 
as 
the 
fundamental 
gnosiologic 
milestone 
which 
must 
be 
always 
preserved, 
acknowledging 
that 
sometimes 
a 
new 
acquirement 
results 
incompatible 
with 
our 
previous 
statute 
is 
acknowledging 
that, 
in 
order 
to 
restore 
the 
coherence, 
some 
correction 
(that 
is 
the 
substitution 
of 
some 
piece 
of 
information 
with 
its 
opposite) 
is 
necessary. 
Yet, 
in 
general, 
the 
coherence 
can 
be 
restored 
through 
different 
corrections; 
I 
claim 
that 
our 
choice 
complies 
with 
a 
rule 
(let 
me 
call 
it 
“criterion 
of 
minimal 
charge”) 
shortly 
and 
intuitively 
expressible 
by 
saying 
that 
we 
must 
choose 
the 
simplest 
(the 
cheapest?) 
correction. 


The 
plain 
theorization 
of 
this 
rule 
follows. 


13.5.1. 
A 
characteristic 
rustle 
awakes 
me; 
I 
bet 
it 
is 
raining. 
I 
open 
the 
shutters 
and 
my 
opinion 
is 
confirmed: 
pines 
are 
trickling 
under 
a 
dark 
sky 
and 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
swimming 
pool 
is 
stippled 
by 
thousand 
of 
drops. 
Let 
me 
assume 
“(degree 
of) 
reliability” 
as 
a 
synonym 
of 
“(value 
of) 
probability” 
(Carnap 
would 
speak 
of 
the 
degree 
of 
confirmation) 
peculiarly 
intended 
to 
emphasize 
the 
eventual 
presence 
of 
non 
objectively 
quantifiable 
components 
in 
the 
respective 
assignation. 


A 
momentous 
part 
of 
our 
gnosiologic 
life 
consists 
in 
assigning 
a 
degree 
of 
reliability 
to 
hypotheses. 
Given 
a 
certain 
h, 
its 
degree 
of 
reliability, 
obviously, 
depends 
on 
the 
statute 
k; 
In 
the 
example 
h 
is 
*it 
is 
raining* 
and 
the 
acquirement 
k’ 
obtained 
by 
opening 
the 
shutters, 
improving 
my 
previous 
statute 
k° 
(the 
rustle), 
increases 
the 
reliability 
of 
h, 
that 
is 
its 
probability 
(P(h|k°&k’) 
> 
P(h|k 
°)). 


13.5.2. 
Let 
me 
start 
from 
the 
simplest 
possibility 
space, 
that 
is 
from 
a 
dilemma, 
in 
order 
to 
introduce 
a 
simplified 
version 
Ò* 
of 
Ò. 
If 
we 
represent 
the 
probability 
of 
h 
and 
of 
~h 
(obviously 
linked 
by 
P(h|k) 
+ 
P(~h|k)=1) 
on 
a 
unitary 
segment 
0÷1, 
we 
get 
two 
symmetric 
points, 
whose 
absolute 
distance 
|Pb(h|k) 
-Pb(~h|k)| 
varies 
from 
0 
(the 
two 
opposite 
hypotheses 
are 
equiprobable, 
so 
both 
points 
are 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
segment) 
to 
1 
(one 
of 
the 
opposite 
hypotheses 
is 
true 
and 
the 
other 
false, 
so 
the 
two 
points 
are 
in 
the 
extremes). 


The 
quantity 
ih 
= 
(ph-p~h)/ 
(1-| 
ph-p~h 
|) 


(where 
“ph 
” 
is 
an 
abbreviation 
for 
“P(h|k)” 
et 
cetera) 
is 
called 
“import 
(of 
the 
h-correction)” 
or 
also, 


picturesquely, 
“cost 
(of 
the 
h-correction)”. 
The 
import 
is 
a 
ratio, 
and 
since 
in 
its 
numerator 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
two 
probabilities 
does 
not 
occur 
in 
absolute 
value, 
the 
same 
import 
is 
a 
relative 
quantity 
(a 
negative 
cost 
is 
a 
gain). 
So 


ph 
=1 
ih 
=¥ 


ph 
= 
9/10 
ih 
=4 


ph 
= 
5/6 
ih 
=2 


ph 
= 
3/4 
ih 
=1 



ph 
= 
3/5 
ih 
= 
1/4 


ph 
= 
1/2 
ih 
=0 


ph 
= 
2/5 
ih 
= 
-1/4 


ph 
= 
1/4 
ih 
= 
-1 


……… 
…….. 


ph 
=0 
ih 
= 
-¥ 
are 
some 
instances 
of 
the 
import 
function 
(whose 
asymptotic 
course 
is 
highly 
significant). 


I 
claim 
that 
wherever 
we 
have 
to 
correct 
our 
statute, 
the 
rule 
to 
follow 
is: 
minimize 
the 
total 
import 
of 
the 
corrections 
(hence 
“criterion 
of 
minimal 
charge”). 
The 
rule, 
for 
instance, 
states 
that 
a 
correction 
concerning 
a 
surely 
true 
piece 
of 
information 
(ph 
= 
1) 
entails 
an 
infinite 
cost 
(is 
a 
logical 


contradiction) 
exactly 
as 
a 
correction 
concerning 
a 
surely 
false 
piece 
of 
information 
(ph 
= 
0) 
entails 
an 
infinite 
gain 
(is 
a 
logical 
necessity). 
Analogously, 
if 
two 
opposite 
hypotheses 
have 
the 
same 
reliability 
(ph 
= 
1/2 
= 
p~h) 
the 
import 
of 
the 
respective 
correction 
is 
null. 
All 
these 
instances 
comply 
with 
our 
intuition, 


13.5.2.1. 
Exactly 
as 
in 
Ò 
a 
confirmation 
value 
is 
represented 
by 
the 
(relative) 
areal 
difference 
between 
the 
sector 
representing 
h 
under 
k° 
and 
the 
sector 
representing 
h 
under 
k°&k’ 
(that 
is 
under 
k 


°&e), 
in 
Ò* 
a 
confirmation 
value 
is 
represented 
by 
the 
(relative) 
distance 
between 
the 
point 


representing 
h 
under 
k° 
and 
under 
k°&k’ 
(under 
k°&e). 
Of 
course 
any 
e 
validating 
(invalidating) 
h 


invalidates 
(validates) 
~h. 


13.5.2.2. 
Before 
abandoning 
this 
topic 
I 
wish 
to 
remark 
that 
also 
an 
n-ary 
possibility 
space 
can 
be 
represented 
through 
Ò*. 
In 
this 
case 
we 
have 
to 
deal 
with 
a 
unitary 
segment 
and 
n 
points 
whose 
distances 
from 
the 
origin 
have 
a 
unitary 
sum 
because 
they 
represent 
the 
probability 
of 
the 
respective 
piece 
of 
information. 
Obviously 
any 
distribution 
is 
dictated 
by 
the 
statute 
of 
reference; 
therefore 
a 
new 
acquirement 
increasing 
some 
distances 
will 
decrease 
the 
others 
et 
cetera. 


13.6. 
Let 
me 
re-approach 
the 
matter 
through 
some 
easy 
examples. 
Example 
1. 
I 
am 
walking 
along 
a 
lonely 
and 
narrow 
road. 
Over 
yonder 
a 
white 
car 
is 
daringly 
overtaken 
by 
a 
very 
fast 
red 
coupé, 
whose 
driver 
waves 
at 
me 
when 
he 
passes 
by. 
I 
am 
pleased 
with 
the 
acuteness 
of 
my 
sight 
because 
the 
quick 
reflections 
in 
his 
windshield 
did 
not 
forbid 
me 
from 
recognizing 
my 
old 
friend 
Bob. 
In 
the 
meanwhile 
the 
white 
car 
arrives, 
its 
driver 
stops 
and 
gets 
out: 
he 
too 
is 
my 
old 
friend 
Bob! 
I 
feel 
dismayed: 
are 
there 
two 
Bobs? 
A 
hypothesis 
I 
reject: 
if 
Bob 
were 
a 
pair 
of 
persons, 
after 
sixty 
years 
of 
frequentation, 
sooner 
or 
later 
my 
proverbial 
acumen 
would 
have 
realized 
so 
unusual 
a 
peculiarity. 
A 
hallucination? 
I 
am 
not 
drunk, 
anyhow 
I 
pinch 
myself 
and 
I 
force 
him 
to 
pinch 
me. 
No 
hallucination. 
A 
mistaken 
identity? 
I 
control 
his 
features 
scrutinize 
his 
identity 
card 
and 
ask 
him 
some 
particulars 
that 
only 
Bob 
can 
know; 
at 
the 
end 
I 
must 
reject 
also 
the 
hypothesis 
of 
a 
mistaken 
identity. 
Was 
then 
the 
red 
coupé 
a 
hallucination? 
I 
remember 
the 
roar 
of 
its 
engine, 
the 
Doppler 
effect, 
the 
quake 
of 
the 
ground 
at 
its 
passage, 
the 
birds 
flying 
away 
and 
so 
on. 
Another 
hypothesis 
I 
must 
reject: 
too 
punctual 
and 
well 
organized 
was 
the 
chain 
of 
poly-sensorial 
perceptions. 
Indeed 
I 
am 
facing 
an 
incoherence 
born 
by 
some 
mistaken 
inference 
from 
absolutely 
trustworthy 



sensorial 
data. 
And 
I 
think 
that 
all 
of 
us 
would 
overcome 
such 
an 
incoherence 
by 
the 
same 
correction: 
the 
driver 
of 
the 
coupé 
was 
not 
Bob. 
A 
conclusion 
dictated 
just 
by 
the 
criterion 
of 
minimal 
charge. 
In 
fact 


(13.x) 
a 
red 
coupé 
passed 
me 
by 
and 


(13.xi) 
the 
driver 
of 
the 
white 
car 
is 
not 
the 
driver 
of 
the 
coupé 
and 


(13.xii) 
the 
driver 
of 
the 
white 
car 
is 
Bob 
have 
so 
high 
a 
degree 
of 
reliability 
that 
to 
replace 
one 
of 
them 
with 
its 
respective 
opposite 
would 
be 
too 
expensive 
a 
correction. 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
the 
low 
reliability 
of 


(13.xiii) 
the 
driver 
of 
the 
coupé 
is 
Bob 
makes 
its 
substitution 
with 


(13.xiv) 
the 
driver 
of 
the 
coupé 
is 
not 
Bob 
a 
reasonable 
correction. 
In 
fact 
a 
tanned 
and 
moustached 
person 
resembling 
Bob 
might 
have 
deceived 
even 
the 
acuteness 
of 
my 
sight, 
while 
his 
casual 
gesture 
to 
chase 
a 
fly 
or 
to 
encourage 
so 
energetic 
an 
old 
walker 
might 
have 
deceived 
even 
the 
acuteness 
of 
my 
mind, 
inducing 
me 
to 
read 
it 
as 
the 
wave 
of 


an 
old 
friend. 
Briefly: 
as 
(13.xiv) 
is 
perfectly 
compatible 
with 
(13.x), 
(13.xi) 
and 
(13.xii), 
its 
replacement 
to 
(13.xiii) 
is 
the 
cheapest 
way 
out 
toward 
a 
restored 
coherence. 
And 
just 
because 
such 
a 
replacement 
is 
not 
only 
the 
cheapest 
way 
out, 
but 
even 
the 
only 
reasonable 
one, 
all 
of 
us 
would 
accept 
it 
spontaneously. 


13.6.1. 
Anyhow 
the 
same 
procedure 
rules 
also 
less 
univocal 
contexts. 
Example 
2. 
The 
driver 
of 
the 
white 
car 
too 
passes 
by 
and 
waves 
at 
me 
without 
stopping, 
he 
too 
resembles 
Bob. 
As 
(13.xii) 
is 
no 
longer 
a 
sure 
cognition, 
I 
find 
myself 
in 
perplexity 
facing 
a 
possibility 
space 
partitioned 
in 
the 
three 
incompatible 
alternatives 
(13.xii), 
(13.xiii) 
and 
(13.xv) 
Bob 
is 
neither 
the 
first 
nor 
the 
second 
driver 
each 
of 
them 
with 
its 
degree 
of 
reliability 
(the 
absurdity 
of 
the 
fourth 
alternative 
according 
to 
which 
Bob 
ought 
to 
be 
both 
drivers 
allows 
me 
to 
neglect 
it 
directly). 
The 
respective 
representation 
is 
then 
a 
circle 
partitioned 
in 
three 
sectors 
whose 
measures 
may 
be 
modified 
by 
any 
subsequent 
acquirement 
or 


consideration. 
For 
instance, 
as 
soon 
as 
I 
ponder 
that 
Bob 
is 
a 
prudent 
driver 
the 
reliability 
of 
(13.xiii) 
decreases, 
and 
it 
continues 
decreasing 
as 
soon 
as 
I 
ponder 
that 
hitherto 
Bob’s 
reservedness 
(and 
parsimoniousness?) 
kept 
him 
far 
from 
ostentatious 
cars. 
And 
as 
soon 
as 
I 
remember 
that 
few 
days 
ago 
Bob 
sprained 
his 
ankle, 
the 
highly 
increased 
reliability 
of 
(13.xv) 
makes 
it 
a 
practically 
irreplaceable 



piece 
of 
information 
(that 
is, 
in 
Ò: 
the 
highly 
increased 
area 
of 
the 
sector 
representing 
(13.xv) 
makes 
it 
the 
only 
partition 
of 
the 
circle). 
Only 
some 
absolutely 
sure 
new 
acquirement 
contradicting 
some 
absolutely 
sure 
previous 
cognition 
could 
throw 
me 
into 
a 
deeply 
bewildering 
puzzle. 
But 
just 
the 
fact 
that 
after 
trillions 
and 
trillions 
of 


acquirements 
all 
the 
(relatively 
rare) 
situations 
affected 
by 
an 
apparent 
incoherence 
have 
been 
solved 
through 
a 
severe 
re-examination 
of 
the 
whole 
context 
and 
the 
detection 
of 
a 
mistake 
affecting 
the 
acquirement 
or 
the 
cognition 
(therefore 
their 
only 
presumed 
irreplaceableness), 
just 
this 
fact, 
then, 
induces 
me 
to 
accept 
as 
an 
incontrovertible 
datum 
the 
coherence 
of 
the 
informational 
flow 
constituting 
my 
mental 
life 
(quite 
independently 
of 
the 
ontological 
dimension 
of 
its 
source). 
In 
this 
sense 
the 
falsity 
of 
a 
hypothesis 
results 
from 
its 
incoherence 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
informational 
flow 
(§8 
below). 


13.6.2. 
I 
recall 
§6.13. 
Making 
reference 
to 
Example 
1, 
let 
me 
represent 
the 
possibility 
space 
concerning 
the 
four 
t°-alternatives 
determined 
by 
applying 
the 
opposition 
between 
being 
Bob 
(=b) 
and 
not 
being 


Bob 
(¹b) 
to 
the 
two 
drivers 
(d1 
for 
the 
driver 
of 
the 
coupé 
and 
d2 
for 
the 
driver 
of 
the 
white 
car). 
Once 


excluded 
the 
possibility 
that 
both 
drivers 
are 
Bob 
(alternative 
4) 
the 
t°-circle 
is 
partitioned 
in 
three 
only 
sectors 
whose 
areas, 
before 
the 
coupé 
passes 
me 
by, 
are 
determined, 
say, 
by 
some 
previous 
statistical 
pieces 
of 
information 
about 
the 
identity 
of 
the 
drivers 
running 
that 
road; 
so 
the 
measure 
of 
the 


alternative 
1 
(d1 
¹b 
&d2 
¹b) 
will 
be 
rather 
high 
et 
cetera. 


When 
at 
t’ 
the 
coupé 
passes 
me 
by, 
the 
sight 
of 
its 
driver 
modifies 
my 
cognitive 
situation 
increasing 


the 
probability 
(the 
measure) 
of 
the 
alternative 
2 
(d1 
=b 
&d2 
¹b). 
If 
I 
were 
absolutely 
sure 
that 
d1=b,I 


could 
represent 
my 
(new) 
t’-cognitive 
situation 
by 
shading 
the 
sectors 
1 
and 
3. 
but 
if 
I 
am 
not 
sure, 
an 


appeal 
to 
a 
(new) 
t’ 
diagram 
is 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
represent 
through 
the 
re-partitioning 
technique 
the 
new 
assignation 
concerning 
the 
three 
mentioned 
alternative. 
In 
other 
words. 
Either 
we 
introduce 
a 
scale 
of 
shading 
intensities, 
or 
we 
must 
acknowledge 
that 
shadings 
can 
only 
represent 
the 
elimination 
of 
an 
alternative. 
In 
this 
sense 
shadings 
are 
an 
abbreviative 
technique 
only 
somewhere 
applicable, 
since 
the 
most 
powerful 
and 
universal 
representation 
is 
realized 
by 
a 
sequence 
of 
diachronic 
diagrams 
each 
of 
them 
ruled 
by 
the 
re-partitioning 
technique. 
Of 
course 
a 
hybridization 
of 
the 
two 
techniques 
is 
realizable 
in 
order 
to 
reduce 
the 
number 
of 
diagrams. 


13.7. 
A 
paradigm 
where 
the 
opposition 
between 
cognitions 
and 
propositions 
is 
combined 
with 
the 
opposition 
between 
alinguistic 
(factual) 
and 
linguistic 
informational 
sources, 
comprehends 
four 
points. 
Opposing 
*factual* 
to 
*linguistic*, 
strictly, 
is 
an 
approximation, 
since 
the 
hearing 
of 
a 
voice 
or 
the 
reading 
of 
a 
text 
too 
are 
factual 
perceptions. 
This 
notwithstanding 
the 
opposition 
is 
right 
because 
a 
linguistic 
source, 
besides 
adducing 
the 
non 
conventional 
pieces 
of 
information 
concerning 
its 
material 
nature, 
adduces 
also 
further 
and 
conventional 
pieces 
of 
information, 
that 
is 
because 
the 
essential 
step 


does 
not 
regard 
the 
inference 
from 
the 
listening 
of 
modulated 
sounds 
or 
the 
sight 
of 
ink 
arabesques 
to 
their 
classification 
as 
meaningful 
expressions, 
but 
from 
the 
text 
resulting 
from 
such 
a 
classification 
to 
its 
meaning. 
Therefore, 
although 
the 
above 
examples 
privilege 
alinguistic 
sources, 
the 
analysis 
is 
valid 
even 
where 
the 
pieces 
of 
information 
are 
linguistically 
mediated, 
that 
is 
where 
they 
result 
from 
a 
semantic 
interpretation. 


Example 
3. 
Like 
Example 
1, 
except 
that 
the 
driver 
who 
gets 
out 
from 
the 
white 
car 
is 
Tom, 
who 


tells 
me: 
“Did 
you 
see? 
Since 
he 
fell 
in 
love 
and 
bought 
a 
Ferrari, 
Bob 
has 
become 
a 
risky 
driver!”. 
In 
a 
situation 
like 
this, 
not 
only 
is 
(13.xiii) 
no 
longer 
an 
incompatible 
assumption, 
but 
its 
reliability 
is 
increased 
by 
Tom’s 
comment, 
that 
is 
by 
a 
completely 
separate 
phonic 
utterance. 



Example 
4. 
Like 
Example 
1, 
except 
that 
my 
wife 
is 
walking 
with 
me 
(better: 
I 
am 
walking 
with 
my 
wife). 
When 
the 
red 
coupé 
passes 
us 
by, 
I 
do 
not 
recognize 
its 
driver 
but 
I 
hear 
her 
exclaiming 
“It 
is 
Bob!”. 
The 
piece 
of 
information 
(13.xiii) 
is 
now 
inferred 
exclusively 
from 
the 
semantic 
interpretation 
of 
sounds 
modulated 
by 
my 
wife’s 
voice; 
the 
reliability 
of 
(13.xiii) 
depends 
on 
the 
confidence 
I 
have 
in 
her 
sight 
(and 
her 
sincerity). 
Of 
course 
if 
I 
believe 
her, 
when 
the 
white 
car 
stops 
and 
Bob 
himself 
gets 
out, 
the 
criterion 
of 
minimal 
charge 
compels 
me 
to 
conclude 
that 
sometimes 
we 
confide 
excessively 
in 
our 
wives. 
Example 
5. 
My 
wife’s 
exclamation 
(Example 
4) 
is 
verified 
by 
Tom’s 
comment 
(Example 
3). 
I 
only 
deal 
with 
uttered 
sounds, 
but 
in 
the 
end 
I 
believe 
(13.xiii) 
et 
cetera. 


13.8. 
Let 
me 
insist 
(§4.1). 
The 
eventual 
occurrence 
of 
linguistic 
sources 
(then 
of 
semantic 
components 
in 
the 
interpretative 
stage) 
is 
a 
primary 
factor 
for 
emphasizing 
the 
distinction 
between 
the 
institutive 
and 
the 
propositive 
stage; 
nevertheless 
it 
is 
a 
secondary 
factor 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
alethic 
procedure 
because 
this 
procedure 
deals 
with 
a 
collation 
between 
pieces 
of 
information, 
quite 
independently 
of 
the 
way 
in 
which 
such 
pieces 
of 
information 
are 
obtained 
(a 
conclusion 
confirmed 
also 
by 
the 
applicability 
of 
alethic 
predicates 
to 
fictitious 
statutes). 
The 
fact 
that 
the 
core 
of 
an 
alethic 
procedure 
is 
not 
influenced 
by 
the 
informational 
source 
strongly 
evidences 
the 
short-sightedness 
of 
a 
merely 
linguistic 
approach 
to 
logic. 
Although 
the 
usual 
objects 
of 
alethics 
are 
the 
pieces 
of 
information 
drawn 
by 
interpreting 
linguistic 
texts, 
the 
linguistic 
component 
is 
not 
essential 
for 
alethics. 


13.8.1. 
Where 
the 
informational 
source 
is 
non-linguistic, 
a 
clean 
distinction 
between 
brute 
sensorial 
data 
and 
inferred 
pieces 
of 
information 
is 
often 
hampered 
by 
the 
naturalness 
and 
immediateness 
of 
the 
same 
inferential 
stage. 
For 
instance 
what 
I 
wrote 
in 
§13.6 
(“over 
yonder 
a 
white 
car 
is 
daringly 
overtaken 
...”) 
does 
not 
describe 
my 
sensorial 
experience; 
what 
I 
wrote 
describes 
my 
interpretation 
of 
a 
red 
and 
a 
white 
spots 
moving 
on 
a 
grey 
line. 
I 
firmly 
believe 
in 
that 
interpretation 
because 
all 
of 
my 
subsequent 
perceptions 
confirmed 
it: 
in 
fact 
the 
red 
spot 
over 
yonder 
became 
larger 
in 
conformity 
with 
its 
presumed 
speed 
and 
with 
the 
laws 
of 
perspective, 
the 
noise 
I 
heard 
corresponded 
to 
the 
roar 
of 
a 
speedily 
approaching 
powerful 
engine, 
and 
so 
on. 
The 
initial 
interpretation 
is 
progressively 
legitimated 
by 
the 
immense 
quantity 
of 
subsequent 
sensorial 
data 
which 
can 
be 
coherently 
inserted 
into 
the 
same 
interpretation, 
that 
is 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
a 
credible 
alternative 
interpretation. 
What 
should 
I 
have 
thought? 
that 
the 
red 
spot 
was 
a 
coupè-shaped 
horse 
whose 
whinnies 
sounded 
like 
a 
powerful 
engine 
and 
so 
on? 
The 
vineyard 
in 
the 
fog 
(§5.6.1) 
is 
a 
perhaps 
more 
punctual 
example 
showing 
what 
I 
mean 
by 
“immediateness 
of 
an 
interpretative 
stage”. 
The 
sight 
of 
a 
near 
and 
moving 
shadow 
is 
the 
sensorial 
datum, 
the 
awareness 
of 
my 
perfect 
clearness 
of 
mind 
(everything 
is 
relative) 
legitimates 
my 
convincement 
that 
such 
a 
datum 
is 
not 
a 
hallucination, 
its 
interpretation 
as 
a 
bad 
giant 
is 
the 
inferred 


piece 
of 
information. 
Hence 
the 
sensation 
of 
impending 
danger 
and 
my 
reaction. 
Yet 
subsequent 
and 
absolutely 
reliable 
acquirements 
incompatible 
with 


a 
gigantic, 
anthropomorphic 
and 
hostile 
figure 
is 
threatening 
us 


make 
it 
an 
untenable 
hypothesis; 
therefore 
its 
substitution 
with 


(13.xvi) 
no 
gigantic, 
anthropomorphic 
and 
hostile 
figure 
is 
threatening 
us 
becomes 
a 
necessary 
correction. 
Analogously 
subsequent 
and 
absolutely 
reliable 
acquirements 
make 



(13.xvii) 
a 
bee-master 
overalls 
hung 
on 
a 
stake 
are 
tossed 
by 
a 
gust 
of 
wind 
a 
further 
and 
absolutely 
reliable 
hypothesis 
whose 
perfect 
compatibility 
with 
(13.xvi) 
restores 
the 
perfect 
coherence 
of 
my 
whole 
experience 
(indeed 
(13.xvi) 
does 
not 
imply 
(13.xvii), 
the 
former 
is 
achieved 
before 
recognizing 
that 
the 
tossed 
cloth 
is 
a 
bee-master 
overalls). 
As 
for 
the 
ridiculousness 
of 


my 
instinctive 
reaction, 
it 
follows 
from 
the 
roughness 
of 
mistaking 
overalls 
and 
bad 
giants, 
two 
rather 


unlike 
categories 
of 
individuals, 
particularly 
with 
respect 
to 
their 
faculty 
of 
threatening. 


13.8.2. 
A 
specification 
about 
*alinguistic*. 
The 
alinguisticity 
I 
spoke 
of 
in 
§5.6.1 
concerns 
the 
practical 
impossibility 
of 
a 
linguistic 
mediation 
for 
my 
initial 
inference 
from 
the 
sensorial 
datum. 
The 
alinguisticity 
of 
Example 
1 
and 
Example 
2 
concerns 
the 
(factual) 
way 
in 
which 
the 
various 
pieces 
of 
information 
are 
obtained 
without 
conditioning 
eventual 
linguistic 
factors 
in 
the 
inferential 
procedure. 
13.8.3. 
The 
assumption 
according 
to 
which 
hallucinations 
et 
cetera 
are 
banished 
is 
not 
theoretically 
reductive, 
since 
not 
banishing 
them 
would 
only 
mean 
admitting 
a 
subordinate 
order 
of 
possible 
mistakes. 
In 
fact 
and 
by 
far, 
the 
usual 
mistakes 
we 
(at 
least: 
we 
sober) 
fall 
into 
concern 
the 
interpretative 
stage, 
not 
the 
perceptive 
one 
(as 
for 
instance 
the 
fading 
out 
of 
the 
red 
spot 
I 
interpreted 
as 
a 
coupé 
over 
yonder). 
Example 
6. 
Like 
Example 
1, 
but 
I 
am 
under 
a 
heavy 
LSD-effect. 
The 
red 
coupé, 
instead 
of 
passing 
me 
by, 
takes 
off 
and 
fades 
out 
in 
a 
flash. 
Yet 
as 
soon 
as 
my 
clearness 
revives, 
the 
recollection 
of 
my 
previous 
LSD-assumptions 
supplies 
a 
coherent 
explanation 
enlightening 
the 
pleasant 
hallucinatory 
phenomenon 
too. 


13.9. 
Strictly, 
since 
everyone 
can 
likewise 
utter 
fallacious 
and 
veracious 
sentences, 
the 
intrinsic 
reliability 
of 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
inferred 
from 
a 
linguistic 
source 
(that 
is 
the 
reliability 
of 
the 
proposition 
we 
get 
from 
the 
interpretation 
of 
the 
sentence 
before 
collating 
it 
with 
our 
statute) 
ought 
to 
be 
null. 
Yet 
this 
is 
not 
the 
current 
case 
because, 
usually, 
the 
context 
supplies 
a 
meta-information 
suggesting 
us 
an 
a 
priori 
assignation. 
For 
instance 
I 
did 
not 
witness 
Caesar’s 
murder, 
and 
by 
hypothesis 
neither 
did 
I 
see 
any 
indisputable 
Hollywood 
movie 
on 
the 
topic, 
nor 
do 
I 
know 
how 
he 
died; 
therefore 
when 
I 
read 
in 
a 
celebrated 
encyclopaedia 


(13.xviii) 
Brutus 
stabbed 
Caesar 
I 
cannot 
collate 
(the 
proposition 
adduced 
by) 
(13.xviii) 
with 
its 
homologous 
cognition 
in 
my 
statute. 


Nevertheless 
I 
assign 
a 
very 
high 
degree 
of 
reliability 
to 
(13.xviii) 
uniquely 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
authoritativeness 
I 
recognize 
to 
the 
speaker 
as 
having. 
In 
fact 
its 
falsity 
would 
entail 
the 
correction 
of 
many 
nearly 
incorrigible 
‘meta-cognitions’ 
about 
the 
trustworthiness 
of 
the 
propositions 
warranted 
by 
the 
same 
celebrated 
encyclopaedia 
et 
cetera 
(or 
should 
I 
believe 
in 
a 
world-wide 
conspiracy 
aimed 
at 
deceiving 
my 
opinion 
about 
Caesar’s 
death?). 
In 
contexts 
like 
this 
the 
standard 
procedure 
(reading 
the 
sentence, 
understanding 
the 
adduced 
proposition, 
collating 
it 
with 
its 
homologous 
cognition 
and 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
such 
a 
collation 
assigning 
the 
respective 
degree 
of 
reliability 
to 
the 
proposition 
under 
scrutiny) 
is 
inverted: 
the 
degree 
of 
reliability 
is 
derived 
from 
the 
authoritativeness 
of 
the 
speaker. 



Of 
course 
these 
reciprocal 
procedures 
can 
be 
(and 
often 
are) 
hybridized, 
so 
that 
the 
reliability 
of 
a 
new 
proposition 
results 
from 
the 
combination 
of 
our 
previous 
cognitions 
and 
the 
authoritativeness 
of 
the 
speaker. 


13.10. 
The 
millenary 
wisdom 
of 
natural 
languages 
grasps 
spontaneously 
the 
similarities 
among 
very 
heterogeneous 
referents 
of 
alethic 
predicates. 
For 
instance, 
there 
is 
a 
strong 
reason 
why 
*false*, 
besides 
its 
official 
acceptation 
concerning 
propositions, 
can 
be 
properly 
attributed 
to 
banknotes, 
to 
keels 
and 
so 
on. 
These 
attributions 
follow 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
all 
cases 
something 
is 
false 
(fallacious) 
iff 
it 
adduces 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
incompatible 
with 
the 
statute 
(quite 
independently 
of 
its 
eventual 
apparent 
compatibility). 


Therefore 
the 
falsity 
of 
a 
banknote 
follows 
from 
the 
accurate 
reproduction 
of 
the 
authentic 
ones; 
the 
banknotes 
of 
Monopoli 
are 
not 
false 
simply 
because, 
as 
they 
do 
not 
counterfeit 
anything, 
none 
of 
us 
is 
induced 
to 
think 
that 
a 
$100 
Monopoli 
banknote 
is 
an 
actual 
one. 
Yet 
the 
deceptive 
component 


characterizing 
a 
‘truly 
false’ 
banknote 
is 
unessential. 
A 
false 
keel 
is 
a 
bar 
attached 
to 
the 
actual 
one 
(to 
the 
true 
one) 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
the 
nautical 
performances 
of 
the 
vessel, 
not 
in 
order 
to 
deceive 
the 
knower, 
its 
falsity 
follows 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
an 
incompetent 
person 
is 
induced 
to 
think 
that 
it 
is 
the 
spine 
of 
the 
hull, 
which 
it 
is 
not. 


13.10.1. 
The 
criterion 
of 
minimal 
charge 
and 
the 
condition 
of 
confirmation 
(§12.2) 
Wk’, 
k°,h 
= 
P(h|k°&k’) 
– 
P(h|k°) 


are 
strictly 
related. 
In 
fact 
if 
k’ 
validates 
(invalidates, 
is 
irrelevant 
to) 
h, 
by 
definition 
(§8.5.2) 
it 


increases 
(decreases, 
does 
not 
change) 
the 
import 
of 
the 
h-correction. 
In 
other 
words, 
the 
gt-reliability 


of 
h 
is 
increased 
by 
the 
admission 
in 
kgt 
of 
h-corroborating 
acquirements 
because 
as 
soon 
as 
~h 
takes 


the 
place 
of 
h, 
such 
acquirements 
too 
must 
be 
corrected, 
thus 
incresing 
the 
cost 
of 
the 
correction. 
On 


the 
other 
hand 
the 
gt-reliability 
of 
h 
cannot 
be 
increased 
by 
the 
gt-lack 
of 
h-invalidating 
acquirements 


as 
this 
lack 
may 
follow 
from 
the 
gt-ignorance 
of 
such 
invalidating 
elements. 
And 
indeed 
our 
actual 
statutes 
are 
affected 
by 
many 
mistakes 
we 
shall 
never 
be 
aware 
of. 


13.10.2. 
Incidentally. 
The 
more 
powerful 
the 
elaborative 
faculties 
of 
a 
mind, 
the 
more 
meaningful 
*false* 
is; 
in 
fact, 
once 
the 
coherence 
of 
the 
informational 
source 
and 
the 
non-hallucinatory 
character 
of 
the 
sensorial 
perceptions 
are 
postulated, 
the 
falsity 
can 
only 
concern 
the 
inferences 
drawn 
by 
the 
knower. 
And 
the 
more 
articulated 
is 
an 
inference, 
the 
more 
it 
is 
probable 
that 
some 
of 
its 
steps 
are 
misleading. 
13.11. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
above 
mentioned 
homogeneity 
between 
the 
two 
terms 
involved 
in 
a 
collation 
(both 
cognitions 
and 
propositions, 
obviously, 
are 
pieces 
of 
information) 
the 
scholastic 
aphorism 


(13.xix) 
Veritas 
est 
adequatio 
intellectus 
et 
rei 
finds 
in 
(13.xx) 
Veritas 
est 
adequatio 
intellectus 
et 
intellectus 

an 
enlightening 
paraphrase. 


13.12. 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
detect 
steady 
points 
of 
contact 
relating 
my 
approach 
with 
each 
of 
the 
three 
main 
alethic 
theories. 
In 
fact 
-the 
intrinsically 
relational 
nature 
of 
alethic 
predicates 
presupposes 
a 
collation, 
which 
is 
to 
say 
a 
correspondence 
between 
two 
informational 
entities; 
-the 
same 
opposition 
between 
*k-true* 
and 
*k-false* 
is 
the 
opposition 
between 
*k-coherent* 
and 
*kincoherent*; 
-the 
pragmatic 
functionality 
is 
the 
compatibility 
with 
the 
flow 
of 
information. 
These 
points 
of 
contact 
do 
not 
follow 
from 
a 
pre-programmed 
syncretism. 
They 
are 
only 
the 
consequences 
of 
a 
completely 
autonomous 
approach 
(the 
informational 
one) 
which, 
moreover, 
is 
free 
from 
the 
difficulties 
affecting 
the 
other 
three. 
I 
mean 
that 
-as 
soon 
as, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
substitution 
of 
(13.xx) 
to 
(13.xix), 
we 
recognize 
that 
the 
correlata 
linked 
by 
the 
correspondence 
are 
not 
heterogeneous 
(as 
facts 
and 
thoughts), 
but 
homogeneous 
(as 
cognitions 
and 
propositions) 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
same 
correspondence 
is 
no 
longer 
problematic, 
since 
it 
reduces 
itself 
to 
an 
implication; 
-to 
say 
that 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
may 
be 
coherent 
(true) 
with 
respect 
to 
many 
statutes 
is 
to 
say 
that 
some 
lack 
of 
information 
affects 
the 
collation; 
yet 
as 
soon 
as 
such 
a 
gap 
is 
progressively 
reduced 
through 
further 
acquirements, 
the 
number 
of 
compatible 
statutes 
is 
also 
reduced, 
until 
singling 
out 
the 
right 
one 
-since 
the 
truth 
of 
a 
proposition 
is 
its 
compatibility 
with 
the 
actual 
flow 
of 
information, 
the 
pragmatic 
functionality 
of 
every 
true 
proposition 
is 
necessary, 
and 
as 
such 
it 
can 
be 
assumed 
as 
an 
empiric 
criterion 
of 
truth. 



CHAPTER 
14 
CONDITIONALS 


14.1. 
I 
call 
generically 
“conditional” 
the 
propositional 
connection 
(14.i) 
if 
p 
(then) 
q 
where 
p 
and 
q 
are 
respectively 
the 
protasis 
(or 
antecedent) 
and 
the 
apodosis 
(or 
consequent). 


Nowadays, 
as 
far 
as 
I 
know, 
conditionals 
are 
canonically 
theorized 
through 
a 
truth 
functional 
approach. 
Since 
this 
approach 
seems 
to 
me 
fragmentary 
and 
inadequate, 
in 
this 
chapter 
I 
propose 
a 
systematic 
alternative. 
The 
formalization 
of 
such 
an 
alternative 
leads 
to 
a 
rather 
complex 
paradigm; 
yet 
far 
from 


being 
a 
fault, 
such 
a 
complexity 
is 
quite 
favourable 
evidence. 
In 
fact 
(let 
me 
repeat 
the 
consideration 
proposed 
in 
§8.15.3), 
since 
all 
its 
voices 
can 
be 
supported 
by 
punctual 
and 
non-interchangeable 
examples, 
a 
simpler 
paradigm 
would 
only 
mean 
too 
rough 
a 
classification. 


For 
the 
sake 
of 
peace 
I 
will 
do 
my 
best 
in 
order 
to 
adapt 
my 
terminology 
to 
the 
current 
one 
(and 
“truth 
functional” 
is 
an 
example). 
And 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
concision, 
for 
instance, 
I 
will 
write 


(14.ii) 
if 
even, 
(then) 
<6 
in 
order 
to 
mean 
that 
if 
a 
certain 
outcome 
is 
even 
then 
it 
is 
less 
than 
6. 
14.2. 
Let 
“Д” 
be 
a 
variable 
on 
propositional 
connectives, 
“À” 
a 
variable 
on 
alethic 
values, 
“x” 
and 
“y” 
(with 
or 
without 
indexes) 
variables 
on 
propositions. 
An 
n-adic 
propositional 
connective 


Д(x1 
.... 
xn) 


is 
a 
truth 
function 
iff 
the 
alethic 
value 
À(Д(x1 
...., 
xn)) 
is 
deducible 
from 
À(x1) 
... 
À(xn). 
Therefore 
if 


Д(x1, 
...., 
xn) 
is 
a 
truth-function, 
its 
alethic 
value 
does 
not 
change 
if 
we 
replace 
xi 
with 
an 
yi 
such 
that 
À(xi)=À(yi). 


14.3. 
Let 
-conjunction 
is 
a 
truth 
function 
-negation 
is 
a 
truth 
function 
-the 
conjunction 
of 
truth 
functions 
is 
a 
truth 
function 
-the 
negation 
of 
truth 
functions 
is 
a 
truth 
function 
-the 
only 
truth 
functions 
are 
those 
given 
above 


be 
the 
recursive 
definition 
of 
truth 
functions. 
Therefore 


(14.iii) 
~(p&~q) 
is 
a 
truth 
function 
(false 
iff 
p 
is 
true 
and 
q 
is 
false). 



14.4. 
Reading 
(14.iii) 
as 
(14.i) 
gives 
rise 
to 
well 
known 
conclusions 
in 
frontal 
contrast 
with 
our 
common 
sense. 
Bob 
bet 
on 
6, 
but 
the 
outcome 
was 
3. 
I 
comment 
If 
the 
outcome 
had 
been 
2, 
you 
would 
have 
won 


and 
I 
reply 
to 
his 
astonished 
glance 
that 
until 
we 
agree 
to 
read 
(14.iii) 
as 
(14.i), 
every 
outcome 
different 
from 
3 
implies 
the 
truth 
of 
my 
comment 
(obviously 
a 
conjunction 
where 
a 
false 
statement 
occurs 
is 
anyhow 
false, 
and 
as 
such 
its 
negation 
is 
anyhow 
true). 
His 
new 
astonished 
glance 
reveals 
that, 
in 
his 
opinion, 
logic 
is 
a 
perhaps 
esoteric 
but 
surely 
crazy 
doctrine 
totally 
incompatible 
with 
his 
most 
deep-seated 
convictions. 


Orthodox 
logicians 
neglect 
these 
difficulties; 
they 
claim 
that 
the 
task 
of 
the 
truth 
functional 
approach 
is 
to 
present 
an 
alethic 
table 
for 
each 
connective, 
not 
to 
justify 
consequences 
entailed 
by 
reading 
the 
same 
connectives 
in 
a 
certain 
way. 
Yet 
their 
attitude 
eludes 
the 
very 
hearth 
of 
the 
problem, 
that 
is 
giving 
a 
trustworthy 
theoretic 
frame 
to 
the 
logic 
by 
which 
the 
current 
use 
of 
“if 
(then)” 
is 
ruled. 
Surely 
this 
logic 
does 
exist, 
since 
in 
current 
practice 
we 
are 
able 
to 
distinguish 
sensible 
and 
senseless 
conditionals. 
And 
the 
problem 
too 
exists: 
why, 
for 
instance, 
does 
reading 


~p&~q 


as 
neither 
p 
nor 
q 
not 
create 
any 
impasse, 
while 
reading 
(14.iii) 
as 
(14.i) 
does? 
My 
answer 
is 
that 
the 
logic 
of 
*if 
(then)* 
(exactly 
as 
the 
logic 
of 
*because* 
or 
of 
*though*) 
cannot 
be 
theorized 
through 
a 
truth 
functional 
approach, 
but, 
once 
more, 
through 
an 
informational 
approach. 
According 
to 
this 
approach 
the 
soundness 
of 
a 
conditional 
depends 
on 
some 
link 
between 
the 
pieces 
of 
information 
respectively 
adduced 
by 
its 
protasis 
and 
its 
apodosis. 
And 
the 
conclusions 
we 
reach 
agree 
perfectly 
with 
our 
common 
sense. 


14.5. 
For 
the 
present 
(until 
§14.15) 
let 
me 
reason 
on 
the 
possibility 
space 
(Howson 
& 
Urbach 
2006, 
§2.a) 
or 
universal 
et 
(Hajek 
2003, 
§1) 
Ω 
constituted 
by 
the 
outcomes 
of 
a 
die. 
In 
particular 
while 
Ω° 
is 
the 
possibility 
space 
related 
to 
a 
standard 
(cubic) 
die, 
Ω’ 
is 
the 
possibility 
space 
related 
to 
a 
dodecahedral 
die. 
Therefore, 
since 
every 
outcome 
must 
present 
one 
and 
only 
one 
number, 
the 
possible 
outcomes 
are 
connected 
by 
partitive 
disjunctions 
(XOR), 
so 
that 
(14.iv) 
either 
1 
or 
2 
or 
3 
or 
4 
or 
5 
or 
6 
is 
the 
basic 
statute 
k° 
for 
Ω°. 
just 
as 


(14.iv’). 
either 
1 
or 
2 
or 
3 
or 
4 
or 
5 
or 
6 
or 
7 
or 
8 
or 
9 
or 
10 
or 
11 
or 
12 


is 
the 
basic 
statute 
k’ 
for 
Ω’. 


14.6. 
Statutes 
play 
a 
fundamental 
role 
in 
the 
informational 
approach 
to 
conditionals. 
Generally 
speaking, 
to 
agree 
that 
we 
are 
reasoning 
under 
a 
certain 
statute 
is 
to 
agree 
that 
the 
pieces 
of 
information 
constituting 
such 
a 
statute 
enter 
into 
the 
knowledge 
we 
use 
in 
order 
to 
state 
our 
conditionals. 
For 
instance, 
again 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
rolling 
of 
a 
die, 
if 
we 
assume 
that 
all 
we 
know 
about 
a 
certain 
outcome 
is 

(14.v) 
Bob 
bet 
on 
6 
and 
lost 
then 
(14.ii) 
is 
true 
with 
reference 
to 
k°, 
but 
false 
with 
reference 
to 
k’ 
where 
also 
8, 
10 
and 
12 
are 


possible 
even 
(yet 
~<6) 
outcomes. 
This 
dependence 
of 
the 
truth 
value 
on 
the 
statute 
of 
reference 
shows 
that, 
strictly, 
statements 
like 


(14.vi) 
(14.ii) 
is 
true 
are 
elliptical. 


Let 
me 
insist: 
(14.vi) 
is 
elliptical 
because, 
given 
(14.v), 
(14.ii) 
is 
k°–true 
and 
k’–false. 
In 
the 
current 
practice 
we 
can 
unequivocally 
use 
elliptical 
conditionals 
only 
where 
the 
statute 
of 
reference 
is 
unequivocally 
established 
by 
the 
specific 
context 
(for 
instance 
when 
we 
simply 
speak 
of 
a 
die, 
our 
interlocutor 
is 
induced 
to 
think 
of 
a 
cubic 
one, 
not 
of 
a 
dodecahedral 
one). 
But 
of 
course 
in 
a 
formal 
approach 
we 
must 
make 
explicit 
reference 
to 
the 
statute, 
because 
its 
pieces 
of 
information 
are 
a 
necessary 
component 
of 
the 
implicative 
relations 
on 
whose 
grounds 
the 
paradigm 
is 
structured. 


14.7. 
The 
informational 
approach 
leads 
to 
a 
paradigm 
where 
the 
various 
kinds 
of 
conditionals 
are 
classified 
on 
the 
grounds 
of 
implicative 
relations 
among 
the 
three 
protagonists 
of 
any 
conditional, 
that 
is 
its 
protasis 
p, 
its 
apodosis 
q 
and 
its 
statute 
of 
reference 
k. 
Yet, 
in 
order 
to 
simplify 
the 
formulae 
of 
the 
following 
theorization, 
the 
statute 
of 
reference 
is 
omitted 
(that 
is: 
it 
is 
given 
as 
implicitly 
understood). 


First 
of 
all 
let 
me 
underline 
two 
preliminary 
assumptions. 


14.7.1. 
The 
assumption 
of 
coherence 
(14.vii) 
~(pÉ~q) 
avoids 
wasting 
time 
about 
conditionals 
like 


if 
even, 
then 
3 


whose 
absurdity 
is 
immediately 
evident 
owing 
to 
the 
logical 
incompatibility 
between 
protasis 
and 
apodosis. 
Without 
the 
agreed 
simplification 
concerning 
the 
omission 
of 
the 
statute, 
of 
course, 


(14.viii) 
~(k&pÉ~q) 
should 
replace 
(14.vii). 
Yet 
such 
a 
simplification 
is 
confirmed 
for 
every 
formula 
till 
(4.xxxii). 


14.7.2. 
The 
assumption 
of 
properness 
is 
grounded 
on 
the 
distinction 
opposing 
proper 
conditionals 
to 
spurious 
(improper) 
ones. 
A 
conditional 
is 
proper 
iff 
both 
its 
protasis 
and 
its 
apodosis 
adduce 

information 
about 
the 
same 
possibility 
space. 
In 
Ò 
such 
an 
assumption 
imposes 
that 
the 
sectors 
representing 
the 
protasis 
and 
the 
apodosis 
concern 
the 
partition 
of 
a 
same 
circle. 
So, 
normally, 


(14.ix) 
if 
the 
croupier 
is 
a 
polygamist, 
then 
~3 
is 
a 
spurious 
conditional 
because, 
normally, 
his 
polygamy 
does 
not 
influence 
the 
outcomes 
of 
the 
die 
he 
rolls. 
Yet 
if 
we 
reason 
within 
a 
(whimsical) 
context 
where 
-there 
is 
only 
one 
polygamous 
croupier 


-the 
polygamous 
croupier 
is 
an 
ill-famed 
trickster 
-the 
trick 
of 
the 
die 
he 
rolls 
forbids 
the 
outcome 
3 
then 
(14.ix) 
is 
a 
proper 
(and 
true) 
conditional; 
in 
fact 
under 
such 
a 
(whimsical) 
context 
to 
learn 
that 
the 
croupier 
is 
the 
polygamist 
is 
to 
acquire 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
about 
the 
possible 
outcomes 
of 
the 
die, 
that 
is 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
which 
increases 
the 
statute 
by 
erasing 
“or 
3” 
from 
(14.iv) 
(or 
from 
(14.iv’) 
if 
the 
rolled 
die 
were 
dodecahedral). 
Anyhow, 
according 
to 
the 
properness 
assumption 
we 
neglect 
spurious 
conditionals 
and 
whimsical 
contexts: 
only 
proper 
conditionals 
are 
the 
objects 
of 
the 
following 
theorization. 


14.8. 
The 
piece 
of 
information 
c 
such 
that 
(14.x) 
p&c 
É 
q 
and 


(14.xi) 
p&~q 
É~c 
is 
called 
“content 
(of 
the 
conditional)”. 
Informally 
speaking, 
c 
is 
the 
smallest 
piece 
of 
information 
which 
(under 
the 
statute 
of 
reference) 
must 
be 
added 
to 
the 
protasis 
in 
order 
to 
imply 
the 
apodosis. 
In 
other 
words, 
(14.x) 
and 
(14.xi) 
are 
rules 
that 
every 
kind 
of 
conditional 
must 
satisfy. 


Let 
me 
emphasize 
that 
the 
content 
c 
depends 
not 
only 
on 
the 
protasis 
p 
and 
on 
the 
apodosis 
q, 


but 
also 
on 
the 
statute 
k. 
For 
instance, 
under 
our 
k°, 
the 
content 
of 


(14.xii) 
if 
even, 
then 
6 
is 


(4.xiii) 
~2&~4 


because 
(14.xiii) 
is 
the 
smallest 
piece 
of 
information 
which, 
added 
to 
(14.iv) 
and 
to 
the 
respective 
protasis 
~1&~3&~5 
implies 
exactly 



6 
that 
is 
the 
apodosis. 
But 
under 
k’ 
the 
content 
of 
(14.xii) 
would 
be 


(14.xiii’) 
~2&~4&~8&~10&~12 


because 
(14.xiii’) 
is 
exactly 
the 
smallest 
piece 
of 
information 
which 
must 
be 
added 
to 
the 
conjunction 
of 
the 
statute 
(14.iv’) 
and 
to 
the 
respective 
protasis 
~1&~3&~5&~7&~9&~11 


in 
order 
to 
imply 
the 
apodosis. 
Henceforth 
the 
examples 
neglect 
k’ 
and 
make 
(implicit) 
reference 
to 
k°. 


14.8.1. 
The 
insertion 
in 
c 
of 
superfluous 
elements 
is 
precluded 
by 
(14.xi). 
For 
instance 
(14.xiv) 
~2 
& 
~4 
and 
the 
die 
is 
red 
cannot 
be 
the 
content 
of 
(14.xii) 
because 


(14.xv) 
~(~2 
& 
~4 
and 
the 
die 
is 
red) 
is 
the 
opposite 
of 
(14.xiv), 
but 
evidently 
while 
p&~q, 
that 
is 


even 
& 
~6 
does 
imply 
the 
opposite 
of 
(14.xiii), 
that 
is 
~(~2&~4) 
it 
does 
not 
imply 
(14.xv) 
because 
it 
does 
not 
tell 
us 
anything 
about 
the 
colour 
of 
the 
die. 


14.9. 
My 
central 
claim 
is 
that 
the 
alethic 
value 
of 
a 
conditional 
is 
the 
alethic 
value 
of 
its 
content. 
This 
claim 
can 
be 
informally 
but 
easily 
supported 
by 
ascertaining 
that, 
after 
all, 
the 
content 
of 
a 
conditional 
is 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
the 
conditional 
in 
question 
transmits 
us. 
Many 
kinds 
of 
conditionals 
can 
be 
distinguished. 
Their 
classification 
is 
centred 
on 
the 
informational 
relations 
among 
p,~p, 
q 
and 
~q. 
The 
conditionals 
where 


(14.xvi) 
pÉq 
are 
called 
“implications”. 
The 
conditionals 
where 


(14.xvii) 
~pÉq 
are 
called 
“para-enthymemes”. 
No 
conditional 
can 
be 
at 
the 
same 
time 
an 
implication 
and 
a 
para-enthymeme: 
if 
it 
were, 
by 
Modus 
Tollens 
we 
could 
derive 
from 
(14.xvi) 
and 
14.xvii) 


(14.xviii) 
~qÉ(p& 
~p) 

that 
is 
an 
incoherence. 
The 
conditionals 
where 


(14.xix) 
~(pÉq) 
& 
~(~pÉq) 
are 
called 
“enthymemes”. 
Evidently, 
since 
(14.xix) 
refuses 
both 
(14.xvi) 
and 
(14.xvii), 
no 
enthymeme 
can 
be 
an 
implication 
or 
a 
para-enthymeme; 
therefore 
the 
set 
of 
proper 
conditionals 
is 
partitioned 
(no 
blank, 
no 
overlap) 
by 
the 
three 
mentioned 
kinds 
of 
conditionals. 
In 
particular 
the 
enthymemes 
where 


(14.xìx) 
~(~p 
É~q) 


are 
called 
“weak 
(enthymemes)”, 
and 
their 
opposites, 
that 
is 
the 
enthymemes 
where 


(14.xxi) 
~p 
É~q 
area 
called 
“strong 
(enthymemes)”. 


Of 
course 
every 
kind 
of 
conditional 
must 
possess 
all 
the 
respective 
requisites. 
So 
for 
instance 
the 
complete 
rule 
for 
weak 
enthymemes 
is 


(14.xxii) 
~(pÉ~q) 
& 
~(pÉq) 
& 
~(~pÉq) 
& 
~(~pÉ~q)) 
stating 
respectively 
that 
the 
conditional 
under 
scrutiny 
is 
coherent, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
neither 
an 
implication 
nor 
a 
para-enthymeme 
nor 
a 
strong 
enthymeme. 
Analogously 


(14.xxiii) 
~(pÉ~q) 
& 
~(pÉq) 
& 
~(~pÉq) 
& 
(~pÉ~q)) 
is 
the 
complete 
rule 
for 
strong 
enthymemes. 
Now 
let 
me 
analyse 
the 
classification. 


14.10. 
Implications 
are 
a 
rather 
trivial 
topic. 
A 
collation 
between 
(14.x) 
and 
(14.xvi) 
shows 
immediately 
that 
an 
implication 
is 
a 
conditional 
with 
a 
null 
content. 
For 
instance 
(14.xxiv) 
if 
even, 
then 
>1 
satisfies 
(14.xvi), 
and 
indeed 
(14.iv) 
tells 
us 
that 
no 
further 
information 
is 
needed 
to 
conclude 
that 
(14.xxiv) 
is 
true. 
14.10.1. 
To 
claim 
that 
conditionals 
are 
not 
truth 
functions 
is 
to 
claim 
that 
implications 
are 
not 
truth 
functions. 
In 
fact, 
since 
negations 
and 
conjunctions 
are 
truth 
functions 
and 
since 
(§9) 
the 
various 
kinds 
of 
conditionals 
are 
defined 
on 
the 
sole 
basis 
of 
negations, 
conjunctions 
and 
implications, 
if 
implications 
were 
truth 
functions, 
the 
recursive 
definition 
of 
§3 
would 
entail 
that 
conditionals 
too 
are 
truth 
functions. 
Let 
me 
propose 
a 
little 
example 
validating 
this 
conclusion. 
Although 
it 
is 
true 
that 
Germany 
is 
in 
Europe 
(g), 
that 
Berlin 
is 
in 
Germany 
(b), 
that 
Kyoto 
is 
in 
Japan 
(j) 
and 
that 
Berlin 
is 
in 
Europe 
(e), 
b&g 
É 
e 



is 
true, 
but 


b&gÉ 
j 


is 
false 
(contrary 
to 
*Berlin 
is 
in 
Europe*, 
*Kyoto 
is 
in 
Japan* 
is 
not 
deducible 
from 
*Berlin 
is 
in 
Germany* 
and 
*Germany 
is 
in 
Europe*); 
therefore 
both 
true 
and 
false 
implications 
exist 
whose 
protasis 
and 
apodosis 
are 
true. 
This 
conclusion 
is 
perfectly 
compatible 
with 
the 
informational 
approach, 
where 
an 
implication 
is 
valid 
(under 
a 
certain 
statute) 
iff 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
its 
apodosis 
is 
deducible 
(under 
the 
same 
statute) 
from 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
its 
protasis. 


14.10.2. 
Conditionals 
like 
(14.xxv) 
if 
p 
then 
even 
or 
odd 
(that 
is 
conditionals 
whose 
apodosis 
is 
necessarily 
true) 
could 
be 
read 
as 
limit 
implications. 
14.10.3. 
Conditionals 
like 
if 
even, 
then 
even 
instance 
a 
trivial 
sort 
of 
implication 
where 
p=q 
(tautological 
conditional). 


14.10.4. 
The 
existence 
of 
implications 
like 
if 
the 
outcome 
is 
>2 
and 
not 
divisible 
by 
3, 
it 
is 
either 
quadratic 
or 
prime 
whose 
understanding 
is 
not 
so 
immediate, 
is 
of 
no 
theoretical 
moment. 
14.11. 
Para-enthymemes 
are 
a 
strained 
kind 
of 
conditionals 
where 
the 
same 
“if” 
becomes 
a 
potentially 
misleading 
occurrence, 
since 
it 
seems 
to 
subordinate 
the 
apodosis 
to 
a 
condition 
which 
such 
an 
apodosis 
is 
not 
at 
all 
subordinate 
to. 
For 
instance 
(14.xxvi) 
if 
even, 
then 
~2&~4 
is 
an 
unquestionable 
para-enthymeme 
because 
(14.xxvii) 
if 
odd, 
then 
~2&~4 
is 
an 
unquestionable 
implication. 
The 
formal 
proof 
that 
in 
a 
para-enthymeme 
(without 
any 
appeal 
to 
p) 
c 
is 
sufficient 
to 
imply 
q 
runs 
(concisely) 
as 
follows: 
Omissis 


14.11.1. 
Conditionals 
like 

if 
even 
or 
odd, 
then 
q 


(that 
is 
conditionals 
whose 
protasis 
is 
necessarily 
true) 
could 
be 
read 
as 
limit 
para-enthymemes, 
since 
the 
basic 
requisite 
is 
kept 
according 
to 
which 
the 
protasis 
does 
not 
give 
any 
informational 
contribute. 
Indeed 
also 
conditionals 
like 
(14.xxv) 
can 
be 
read 
as 
para-enthymemes, 
since 
their 
apodosis 
holds 
quite 
independently 
on 
the 
protasis. 
In 
spite 
of 
this 
double 
reading 
(as 
limit 
implication 
and 
limit 
para


enthymemes), 
the 
specific 
context 
makes 
(14.xviii) 
an 
acceptable 
consequence, 
because 
~q 
becomes 
^. 


14.11.1.1. 
Conditionals 
like 
if 
even 
or 
odd, 
then 
<7 


(that 
is 
conditionals 
whose 
protasis 
and 
apodosis 
are 
necessarily 
true) 
sound 
as 
a 
rhetorical 
way 
to 
emphasize 
the 
necessary 
truth 
of 
the 
apodosis 
by 
the 
necessary 
truth 
of 
the 
protasis. 


14.12. 
Enthymemes 
are 
the 
core 
of 
conditionals, 
exactly 
because 
both 
protasis 
and 
content 
play 
a 
non 
superfluous 
role. 
First 
of 
all 
I 
propose 
two 
examples 
where 
(always 
under 
our 
statute 
k°), 
the 
same 
protasis 
(if 
even) 
and 
the 
same 
content 
(~2&~4) 
lead 
to 
different 
enthymemes 
owing 
to 
their 
different 
apodoses. 


14.12.1. 
The 
conditional 
(14.xxviii) 
if 
even, 
then 
>4 
is 
a 
weak 
enthymeme. 
In 
fact, 
as 
-being 
even 
does 
not 
imply 
being 
>4 
(for 
instance 
2 
is 
even 
and 
~>4) 


-being 
even 
does 
not 
imply 
being 
~>4 
(for 
instance 
6 
is 
even 
and 
>4) 
-being 
odd 
does 
not 
imply 
being 
>4 


(for 
instance 
3 
is 
odd 
and 
~>4) 


-being 
odd 
does 
not 
imply 
being 
~>4 
(for 
instance 
5 
is 
odd 
and 
>4) 
the 
complete 
rule 
(14.xxii) 
is 
satisfied 
by 
(14.xxviii). 


14.12.2. 
The 
already 
proposed 
conditional 
(14.xii), 
that 
is 
(14.xii) 
if 
even, 
then 
6 
is 
a 
strong 
enthymeme. 
In 
fact, 
as 
-being 
even 
does 
not 
imply 
being 
6 
(for 
instance 
4 
is 
even 
and 
~6) 


-being 
even 
does 
not 
imply 
being 
~6 


(for 
instance 
6 
is 
even 
and 
~(~6)) 
-being 
odd 
does 
not 
imply 
being 
6 



(for 
instance 
3 
is 
odd 
and 
~6) 


-being 
odd 
implies 
being 
~6 
(no 
odd 
number 
can 
be 
6) 
the 
complete 
rule 
(14.xxiii) 
is 
satisfied 
by 
(14.xii). 


14.12.3. 
The 
passage 
from 
a 
weak 
enthymeme 
to 
a 
strong 
one 
having 
the 
same 
content, 
is 
legitimated 
by 
a 
variation 
of 
the 
informational 
endowment 
entailing 
the 
refusal 
of 
q 
when 
~p. 
And 
such 
a 
variation 
can 
be 
attained 
through 
two 
reciprocal 
paths, 
that 
is 
either 
through 
an 
increment 
of 
q 


or 
through 
a 
decrement 
of 
p. 
For 
instance, 
in 
order 
to 
transform 
(14.xxviii) 
into 
(14.xii), 
we 
can 


-either 
to 
follow 
the 
first 
path 
by 
adding 
~5 
to 
its 
apodosis 
>4 
(the 
increased 
apodosis 
>4&~5 
is 


exactly 
6); 
-or 
to 
follow 
the 
second 
path 
by 
ablating 
the 
same 
~5 
from 
its 
protasis 
which 
thus 
becomes 
~1&~3 
(evidently 


if 
~1&~3, 
then 
>4 
is 
a 
strong 
enthymeme 
because 
the 
opposite 
of 
its 
protasis 
(~(~1&~3), 
that 
is 
1Ú3) 
implies 
the 
opposite 
of 
the 
apodosis 
(~ 
>4)). 


14.13. 
The 
diagrams 
of 
® 
can 
efficaciously 
help 
the 
intuitive 
understanding 
of 
the 
classification. 
Of 
course 
k° 
results 
from 
the 
uniform 
partition 
of 
the 
circle 
in 
six 
sectors. 
So, 
while 
Figures 
14.1 
represents 
p, 
(odd 
sectors 
precluded) 
and 
Figure 
14.2 
represents 
~p 
(even 
sectors 
precluded) 



Figure 
14.3 
and 
Figure 
14.4 




represent 
respectively 
>1, 
and 
~2&~4, 
that 
is 
respectively 
the 
apodoses 
of 
the 
implication 
(14.xxiv) 
and 
of 
the 
para-enthymeme 
(14.xxvi), 
exactly 
as 
Figure 
14.5 
and 
Figure 
14.6 



represent 
respectively 
>4 
and 
6, 
that 
is 
respectively 
the 
apodoses 
of 
the 
weak 
enthymeme 
(14.xxviii) 
and 
of 
the 
strong 
enthymeme 
(14.xii). 


On 
the 
ground 
of 
what 
I 
affirmed 
in 
§14.8 
(“c 
is 
the 
smallest 
piece 
of 
information 
which 
must 
be 
added 
to 
the 
protasis 
in 
order 
to 
imply 
the 
apodosis”) 
such 
a 
content 
is 
represented 
by 
shading 
in 
Figure 
14.1 
all 
the 
sectors 
necessary 
to 
make 
the 
shaded 
field 
of 
the 
apodosis 
under 
scrutiny 
completely 
covered 
by 
the 
shaded 
field 
of 
the 
new 
diagram. 
Therefore 
the 
collation 
between 
Figure 
14.1 
and 
Figure 
14,3 
shows 
that 
no 
sector 
must 
be 
shaded 
(null 
content 
of 
an 
implication) 
in 
order 
to 
achieve 
such 
a 
result: 
Analogously 
a 
collation 
between 
the 
pairs 
of 
the 
other 
three 
conditionals 
shows 
that 
their 
content 
is 
the 
same, 
since 
in 
all 
of 
them 
it 
is 
represented 
by 
shading 
the 
sectors 
2 
and 
4 
(that 
is: 
such 
a 


content 
is 
in 
any 
case 
~2&~4). 


All 
the 
conclusions 
of 
the 
above 
analysis 
are 
punctually 
verifiable 
through 
the 
figures. 
Two 
examples. 


14.13.1. 
According 
to 
the 
definition 
(14.xvii), 
(14.xxvi) 
is 
a 
para-enthymeme 
because 
(14.xxvii) 
is 
an 
implication. 
Such 
evidence 
is 
represented 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
shading 
field 
of 
Figure 
14.2 
covers 
the 
shading 
field 
of 
Figure 
14.4. 
14.13.2. 
The 
diagram 
obtained 
by 
representing 
also 
the 
content, 
that 
is 
by 
shadings 
also 
sectors 
2 
and 
4 
of 
Figure 
14.1 
is 
exactly 
Figure 
14.6; 
this 
means 
that 
the 
apodosis 
of 
the 
strong 
enthymeme 
(14.xii) 
adduces 
precisely 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
resulting 
from 
p&c. 
The 
argument 
proposed 
in 
§14.12.3 
results 
from 
a 
collation 
between 
Figure 
14.5 
and 
Figure 
14.6, 
whose 
only 
difference 
concerns 
sector 
5. 


14,13.3. 
The 
representation 
of 
a 
spurious 
conditional 
would 
need 
two 
circles, 
one 
for 
the 
possibility 
space 
of 
the 
protasis 
and 
one 
for 
the 
possibility 
space 
of 
the 
apodosis. 
The 
whimsical 
context 
of 
§14.7.2 
allows 
us 
to 
shade 
sector 
3 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
croupier’s 
polygamy; 
otherwise 
such 
a 
sector 
is 
virgin. 
In 
this 
sense 
spurious 
conditionals 
might 
be 
considered 
as 
a 
degenerate 
form 
of 
paraenthymemes 
(§14.11.1.1). 


14.14. 
The 
definitions 
(14.xvii) 
(14.xx) 
and 
(14.xxi) 
show 
that 
the 
answer 
to 
the 
crucial 
question 
(14.xxix) 
and 
if 
~p? 
is 
the 
essential 
factor 
ruling 
not 
only 
the 
distinction 
between 
para-enthymemes 
and 
enthymemes, 
but 
also 
the 
distinction 
between 
strong 
and 
weak 
enthymemes. 
In 
fact 
the 
answer 
to 
(14.xxix) 
must 
be 

(14.xxx) 
then 
q 
if 
the 
conditional 
is 
a 
para-enthymeme 
(as 
for 
instance 
(14.xxvi)), 


(14.xxxi) 
then 
may 
be 
q, 
may 
be 
~q 
if 
the 
enthymeme 
is 
weak 
(as 
for 
instance 
(14.xxviii)), 
and 


(4.xxxii) 
then 
~q 
if 
the 
conditional 
is 
a 
strong 
enthymeme 
(as 
for 
instance 
(14.xii)). 


14.15. 
Until 
now 
I 
reasoned 
on 
the 
extremely 
simple 
possibility 
space 
represented 
by 
the 
outcomes 
of 
a 
die. 
Yet 
in 
our 
minute 
practice 
we 
mainly 
use 
conditionals 
with 
reference 
to 
highly 
complex 
possibility 
spaces 
concerning 
the 
world 
we 
live 
in. 
In 
order 
to 
acknowledge 
the 
deep 
differences 
between 
conditionals 
like 
the 
above 
instanced 
ones 
and 
conditionals 
like 
(14.xxxiii) 
if 
Jim 
wins 
the 
lottery 
prize, 
he 
will 
purchase 
a 
country 
seat 
I 
speak 
respectively 
of 
analytic 
(or 
unambiguous) 
and 
of 
synthetic 
(or 
ambiguous) 
conditionals. 
Since 
an 
explicit 
protasis 
and 
an 
explicit 
apodosis 
occur 
in 
synthetic 
conditionals 
too, 
their 
ambiguity 
depends 
only 
on 
their 
statute 
(and, 
consequently, 
on 
their 
content). 
This 
means, 
following 
the 
example, 
that 
the 
same 
(14.xxxiii) 
which 
under 
some 
statute 
may 
be 
read 
as 
a 
para-enthymeme 
under 
another 
statute 
may 
be 
read 
as 
a 
weak 
or 
as 
a 
strong 
enthymeme. 
In 
other 
words, 
a 
univocal 
classification 
of 


(14.xxxiii) 
may 
be 
hampered 
or 
even 
forbidden 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
more 
specific 
information 
about 
the 
context, 
that 
is 
by 
the 
impossibility 
of 
establishing 
a 
univocal 
statute 
(and, 
consequently, 
a 
univocal 
content). 
The 
necessity 
of 
establishing 
a 
precise 
statute 
of 
reference 
in 
order 
to 
derive 
a 
precise 
content, 
then 
a 
precise 
alethic 
value, 
entails 
the 
necessity 
of 
replacing 
the 
simplified 
rule 
(14.vii) 
with 
(14.viii) 
and 
analogously 
the 
necessity 
of 
replacing 
(14.x) 
and 
(14.xi) 
with 


(14.xxxiv) 
k&p&c 
É 
q 
and 
(14.xxxv) 
k&p&~q 
É~c 
respectively. 
14.15.1. 
There 
are 
many 
(and 
potentially 
contrasting) 
reasons 
that 
can 
induce 
Jim 
to 
purchase 
a 
country 
seat 
if 
he 
wins 
the 
lottery 
prize: 
the 
social 
ambition 
(only 
the 
owners 
of 
a 
country 
seat 
can 
...), 
a 
damnable 
promise 
to 
his 
wife 
(I 
promise 
you 
that 
if 
I 
win 
...), 
a 
mere 
financial 
choice 
(today 
the 
best 
investment 
is 
...) 
et 
cetera. 
Yet, 
since 
(4.xxxiii) 
does 
not 
inform 
us 
about 
such 
reasons, 
I 
will 
speak 
of 
a 
firm 
intention 
to 
summarize 
generically 
all 
of 
them. 
Once 
obviously 
assumed 



Jim 
wins 
the 
lottery 
prize 


as 
p 
and 


Jim 
purchases 
a 
country 
seat 


as 
q, 
let 
me 
schematically 
assume 


(14.xxxvi) 
the 
lottery 
prize 
gives 
sufficient 
suitable 
funds 
for 
purchasing 
a 
country 
seat 
-sufficient 
suitable 
funds 
and 
the 
firm 
intention 
to 
purchase 
entail 
a 
purchase 
as 
k, 
and 


(4.xxxvii) 
Jim 
firmly 
intends 
to 
purchase 
a 
country-seat 
as 
c. 
Under 
these 
assumptions, 
since 
q 
(Jim 
purchases 
a 
country 
seat) 
is 
actually 
deducible 
from 


k&p&c 
in 
conformity 
with 
(14.xxxiv), 
no 
further 
information 
is 
necessary 
to 
make 
true 
(14.xxxiii). 
Furthermore, 
since 
(14.xxxv) 
too 
is 
satisfied, 
(the 
lottery 
gave 
Jim 
sufficient 
suitable 
funds, 
nevertheless 
he 
did 
not 
make 
the 
purchase, 
then 
he 
had 
not 
the 
firm 
intention), 
the 
content 
of 


(14.xxxiii) 
is 
actually 
(14.xxxvii). 
Yet 
which 
kind 
of 
conditional 
(14.xxxiii) 
is? 
In 
compliance 
with 
(14.xxix), 
that 
is 
and 
if 
Jim 
does 
not 
win? 


is 
the 
basic 
question 
whose 
answer 
allows 
the 
classification 
of 
(14.xxxiii). 
And 
such 
an 
answer 
depends 
on 
the 
pieces 
of 
information 
we 
add 
to 
(14.xxxvi). 
I 
sketch 
three 
possible 
contexts. 


Under 
k1 
Jim, 
besides 
being 
a 
very 
rich 
person 
who 
recently 
inherited 
a 
lot 
of 
gold 
bars 
(thus 
disposing 
of 
sufficient 
suitable 
funds) 
is 
a 
hard 
speculator 
who 
thinks 
that 
today 
the 
purchase 
of 
a 
country 
seat 
is 
the 
best 
investment 
and 
an 
ambitious 
man 
aspiring 
at 
the 
admission 
to 
an 
illustrious 
club 
where 
only 
important 
land 
owners 
are 
welcome. 
Under 
this 
k1, 
(14.xxxiii) 
tends 
to 
be 
read 
as 
a 
paraenthymeme 
(Jim 
will 
purchase 
anyway). 


Under 
k2, 
Jim, 
besides 
being 
a 
very 
rich 
person 
who 
recently 
inherited 
a 
lot 
of 
gold 
bars, 
is 
an 
absolutely 
unforeseeable 
guy: 
what 
then 
will 
he 
decide 
about 
the 
purchase 
if 
he 
does 
not 
win? 
Under 
this 
k2, 
(14.xxxiii) 
tends 
to 
be 
read 
as 
a 
weak 
enthymeme. 


Under 
k3, 
Jim 
is 
a 
poor 
and 
honest 
pensioner 
with 
no 
chance 
of 
borrowing 
money 
or 
of 
robbing 


a 
bank 
et 
cetera. 
Under 
this 
k3, 
(14.xxxiii) 
tends 
to 
be 
read 
as 
a 
strong 
enthymeme. 


The 
point 
to 
remark 
is 
that 
the 
considerations 
about 
the 
alethic 
value 
of 
(14.xxxiii), 
which 
depends 
on 
the 
alethic 
value 
of 
its 
respective 
content 
are 
quite 
distinct 
from 
the 
considerations 
about 
the 
alethic 
value 
of 
the 
protasis, 
which 
depends 
on 
the 
result 
of 
the 
lottery. 


14.15.2. 
Of 
course 
the 
analysis 
above 
is 
far 
from 
exhausting 
the 
informational 
nuances 
offered 
by 
the 
huge 
complexity 
of 
the 
statute 
in 
which 
the 
conditional 
under 
scrutiny 
is 
inserted. 
For 
instance, 
let 

(14.xxxiii) 
be 
a 
gossip 
Bob 
imparts 
to 
me; 
since 
both 
of 
us 
know 
that 
while 
Jim 
repeatedly 
declared 
his 
intention 
to 
purchase 
a 
yacht 
if 
should 
he 
win 
the 
lottery 
prize, 
Jim’s 
wife 
repeatedly 
declared 
her 
intention 
to 
purchase 
a 
country 
seat 
if 
should 
she 
win 
the 
lottery 
prize, 
in 
such 
a 
situation 
the 
content 
of 
(14.xxxiii) 
is 
something 
like 
*Jim 
is 
dominated 
by 
his 
wife*. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
if 
we 
know 
that 
while 
Jim’s 
wife 
repeatedly 
declared 
her 
intention 
to 
purchase 
a 
yacht 
if 
should 
she 
win 
the 
lottery 
prize, 
Jim 
(who 
cordially 
detests 
the 
country 
life) 
repeatedly 
lamented 
that 
his 
condition 
of 
a 
without 
property 
guy 
forbids 
his 
admission 
to 
the 
mentioned 
club, 
the 
content 
of 
(14.xxxiii) 
is 
something 
like 
*Jim 
is 
dominated 
by 
his 
social 
ambition*. 
A 
more 
sophisticated 
analysis 
could 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
supposing 
that 
only 
Bob 
knows 
the 
context, 
so 
that 
his 
statute 
and 
mine 
(therefore 
his 
content 
and 
mine) 
are 
different 
et 
cetera. 
A 
last 
example 
follows 
from 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
(14.xxxiii) 
is 
a 
statement 
I 
hear 
casually, 
without 
knowing 
Jim; 
under 
such 
a 
hypothesis 
the 
absolute 
ambiguity 
of 
the 
respective 
statute 
(the 
disjunction 
of 
too 
many 
alternatives, 
each 
of 
them 
with 
its 
respective 
content) 
forbids 
any 
alethic 
assignation 
and 
any 
classification. 
14.16. 
The 
truth 
functional 
connection 
(14.iii), 
that 
is, 
more 
generally 
(§7.11), 
(14.xxxviii) 
~(h1&~h2) 


is 
called 
“pseudo-hypothetic”. 
While 
an 
inference 
from 
the 
proper 
conditional 


(4.xxxix) 
if 
h1, 
then 
h2 
to 
the 
corresponding 
pseudo-hypothetic 
is 
always 
legitimate, 
the 
reciprocal 
inference 
may 
be 
illegitimate. 
In 
fact 
while 
the 
truth 
of 
(14.xxxix), 
besides 
assuring 
the 
truth 
of 
(14.xxxviii), 
that 
is 
the 
falsity 
of 


(14.xxxx) 
h1&~h2 


assures 
also 
that 
h1 
and 
h2 
are 
two 
pieces 
of 
information 
concerning 
the 
same 
possibility 
space, 
no 
properness 
condition 
binds 
the 
truth 
of 
(14.xxxviii), 
that 
is 
the 
falsity 
of 
(14.xxxx), 
therefore 
the 
properness 
of 
(14.xxxix) 
is 
not 
assured. 


For 
instance, 
the 
truth 
of 
(14.xxxiii) 
entails 
that 


Jim 
wins 
and 
he 
does 
not 
make 
the 
purchase 


is 
false; 
but 
the 
falsity 
of 


Jim 
wins 
and 
Kyoto 
is 
not 
in 
Japan 


does 
not 
entail 
that 


If 
Jim 
wins, 
then 
Kyoto 
is 
in 
Japan 


is 
a 
proper 
conditional. 
Connecting 
two 
spurious 
statements 
by 
“if 
(then)” 
is 
a 
misleading 
procedure. 



14.17. 
As 
to 
composite 
conditionals 
like 
(4.xxxxi) 
p1É 
(p2É 
q) 


it 
is 
easy 
to 
ascertain 
that 
(14.xxxxi) 
and 


(4.xxxxii) 
(p1&p2)É 
q 


are 
equivalent; 
in 
fact 


(p1&p2&q)=(p1&p2) 


can 
be 
indifferently 
deduced 
by 
definition 
from 
(14.xxxxii) 
or 
by 
substitution 
of 
identity 
(p2&q=p2) 
from 
(14.xxxxi). 


14.18. 
Another 
traditional 
theme 
disqualifying 
the 
truth 
functional 
approach 
to 
conditionals 
(Quine 
1959, 
§§ 
2 
and 
3) 
concerns 
counterfactuals 
(i.e. 
conditionals 
whose 
protases 
are 
openly 
assumed 
as 
false). 
In 
my 
opinion 
an 
approach 
entailing 
that 
an 
outcome 
3 
makes 
true 
both 


(14.xxxxiii) 
if 
the 
outcome 
had 
been 
2, 
Bob 
would 
have 
won 
and 


(14.xxxxiv) 
if 
the 
outcome 
had 
been 
2, 
Bob 
would 
have 
lost 
is 
to 
refuse 
without 
appeal, 
particularly 
because 
the 
informational 
approach 
theorizes 
counterfactuals 
in 
a 
way 
which 
complies 
perfectly 
with 
our 
intuitive 
suggestions. 
Briefly, 
I 
explain 
myself 
by 
comparing 


(14.xxxxv) 
if 
the 
outcome 
is 
2, 
Bob 
wins 
with 
(14.xxxxiii). 
The 
difference 
between 
moods 
and 
tenses 
of 
their 
verbs 
means 
just 
two 
different 
positions 
about 
the 
alethic 
value 
of 
the 
protasis 
(false 
in 
the 
counterfactual 
(14.xxxxiii), 
unknown 
in 
the 
indicative 
conditional 
(14.xxxxv)). 
Yet 
their 
content 
is 
the 
same 
(*Bob 
bet 
on 
2*). 
Therefore, 
since 
in 
the 
informational 
approach 
the 
alethic 
value 
of 
a 
conditional 
is 
the 
alethic 
value 
of 
its 
content, 
if 


(14.xxxxiii) 
is 
true 
(14.xxxxv) 
too 
is 
true, 
and 
if 
(14.xxxxiii) 
is 
false 
(14.xxxxv) 
too 
is 
false. 
Reciprocally, 
since 
the 
content 
of 
(14.xxxxiv) 
is 
the 
exact 
opposite 
(*Bob 
did 
not 
bet 
on 
2*), 
if 
(14.xxxxiii) 
is 
true 
(14.xxxxiv) 
is 
false, 
and 
if 
(14.xxxxiii) 
is 
false, 
(14.xxxxiv) 
is 
true. 
In 
other 
words. 
The 
transformation 
of 
an 
indicative 
conditional 
into 
the 
corresponding 
counterfactual 
(or 
vice 
versa) 
modifies 
the 
adduced 
pieces 
of 
information 
only 
as 
for 
the 
alethic 
value 
of 
the 
protasis 
(perhaps 
true 
or 
perhaps 
false 
in 
the 
indicative 
conditional, 
surely 
false 
in 
the 
counterfactual); 
yet, 
since 
such 
a 
transformation 
does 
not 
modify 
their 
common 
content, 
it 
does 
not 
modify 
their 
common 
alethic 
value. 



14.19. 
Indeed 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
all 
these 
conclusions 
agree 
perfectly 
with 
our 
intuition. 

CHAPTER 
15 
VARIABLE 


15.1. 
In 
§6 
of 
The 
principles 
of 
mathematics 
Russell 
says 
that 
*variable* 
is 
one 
among 
the 
most 
difficult 
notions 
of 
Logic. 
From 
my 
informational 
viewpoint 
things 
are 
quite 
simpler: 
a 
free 
individual 
variable 
is 
a 
sign 
(a 
sign, 
I 
repeat) 
which 
refers 
to 
a 
precise 
member 
of 
the 
set 
constituting 
its 
domain 
without 
supplying 
sufficient 
information 
to 
single 
out 
the 
precise 
member 
it 
refers 
to. 
In 
other 
words 
a 
free 
variable 
is 
a 
sign 
affected 
by 
an 
institutional 
lack 
of 
information, 
and 
“the 
specific 
but 
here 
unspecified 
individual 
belonging 
to 
the 
domain 
of 
reference” 
or, 
roughly, 
“the 
individual 
to 
specify” 
are 
reasonable 
periphrases. 
15.1.1. 
Of 
course 
even 
an 
indefinite 
article 
like 
“a” 
does 
not 
specify 
a 
precise 
member. 
Awaiting 
a 
detailed 
analysis, 
here 
I 
shortly 
note 
that 
the 
difference 
consists 
in 
the 
opposition 
*free* 
vs. 
*bond*, 
that 
is, 
for 
instance, 
the 
difference 
between 
*he* 
and 
*someone* 
(so 
to 
write, 
whatever 
he 
is 
someone, 
but 
only 
a 
particular 
someone 
is 
he). 
15.1.2. 
Therefore, 
though 
constants 
and 
variables 
are 
signs 
(syntactical 
entities), 
their 
discriminating 
factor 
is 
semantic. 
The 
distinction 
between 
pertinence 
and 
regard 
(Chapter 
2, 
§9.2) 
shows 
that 
defining 
an 
attribute 
concerning 
signs 
on 
the 
grounds 
of 
a 
semantic 
characteristic 
is 
a 
perfectly 
legitimate 
procedure. 
The 
(indeed 
rather 
consequential) 
opposition 
between 
impotent 
and 
active 
men 
is 
grounded 
on 
certain 
sexual 
faculties, 
but 
it 
concerns 
men, 
not 
sexual 
faculties. 
A 
variable, 
so 
to 
say, 
is 
a 
referentially 
impotent 
term. 
15. 
1.3. 
The 
current 
formal 
approaches 
conceal 
a 
lot 
of 
semantics 
behind 
*sign*. 
The 
semantic 
dimension 
is 
essential 
to 
something 
being 
a 
sign 
just 
as 
the 
matrimonial 
dimension 
is 
essential 
to 
someone 
being 
an 
ill-married 
man. 
Once 
castrated 
(I 
an 
speaking 
of 
the 
sign), 
that 
is 
once 
deprived 
of 
any 
meaning, 
it 
becomes 
a 
dead 
support 
of 
nothing 
more 
than 
itself, 
an 
arabesque 
devoid 
of 
any 
component 
able 
to 
make 
it 
a 
genuine 
sign. 
15.2. 
I 
try 
to 
explain 
my 
viewpoint 
through 
a 
picturesque 
example. 
The 
individual 
constants 
of 
an 
emblematic 
language 
Le 
are 
exactly 
(metalinguistic 
new-lines) 


(15.i)
(which 
in 
the 
privileged 
interpretation 
designates 
Jesus), 
(15.ii) 



(whichintheprivilegedinterpretationdesignatesHitler)and(15.iii)
(which 
in 
the 
privileged 
interpretation 
designates 
De 
Gaulle). 
In 
Le 
the 
graphically 
enlighting 
choice 
for 
the 
respective 
variable 
would 
then 
be 


(15.iv)
because, 
since 
(15.iv) 
is 
the 
graphic 
core 
common 
to 
(15.i), 
(15.ii) 
and 
(15.iii), 
any 
constant 
is 
obtainable 
by 
(15.iv) 
through 
a 
graphic 
completion 
of 
this 
core-emblem; 
and 
the 
semantic 
integration 
saturating 
the 
lack 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
the 
variable 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
informational 
consequence 
of 
such 
a 
completion. 
In 
other 
words: 
three 
different 
fixations 
of 
(15.iv) 
lead 
to 
(15.i), 
(15.ii) 
and 


(15.iii) 
respectively, 
so 
determining 
three 
different 
semantic 
integrations. 
Indeed, 
in 
general, 
settling 
a 
correspondence 
between 
graphic 
increments 
(decrements) 
of 
a 
sign 
and 
increments 
(decrements) 
of 
the 
adduced 
pieces 
of 
information 
would 
be 
a 
very 
precious 
convention. 
And 
I 
proposed 
Le 
precisely 
because, 
except 
rare 
and 
ad 
hoc 
exceptions 
(for 
instance 
assuming 
“Ed” 
as 
a 
variable 
ranging 
over 
a 
domain 
whose 
members 
are 
Edgar, 
Edmond, 
Edward 
and 
Edwin) 
a 
convention 
like 
this 
is 
practically 
unrealizable 
in 
usual 
languages, 


15.2.1. 
Obviously, 
since 
(15.v)
does 
not 
belong 
to 
Le 
, 
the 
fixation 
from 
(15.iv) 
to 
(15.v) 
is 
senseless; 
in 
order 
to 
overcome 
this 


senselessness 
we 
should 
agree 
that 
in 
Le 
(15.v) 
designates 
someone 
(Mondrian, 
say). 


15.2.2. 
In 
§15.1 
I 
emphasized 
that 
variables 
are 
signs. 
Particularly 
where 
variables 
are 
concerned, 
any 
ambiguity 
between 
the 
syntactic 
and 
the 
semantic 
planes 
is 
a 
calamity. 
Yet 
*variable*, 
in 
its 
current 
acceptation, 
is 
far 
from 
being 
an 
unambiguous 
notion: 
for 
instance 
in 
the 
same 
article 
of 
Wikipedia 
I 
read 
“a 
variable 
is 
a 
value 
…” 
and 
“a 
variable 
is 
used 
to 
designate 
a 
value…”. 
And 
actually 
the 
contemporary 
orthodoxy 
considers 
as 
a 
variable 
both 
a 
variable 
quantity 
and 
a 
symbol 
(an 
expression) 
representing 
a 
variable 
quantity. 
But 
as 
“to 
be” 
and 
“to 
represent” 
are 
not 
synonyms, 
an 
ambiguity 
is 
consequently 
inevitable. 


Before 
deepening 
this 
theme 
(§4), 
some 
(perhaps 
obvious) 
terminological 
agreement. 



15.3. 
Variables 
range 
over 
domains 
(that 
is 
set 
of 
individuals). 
Sentences 
where 
at 
least 
one 
free 
variable 
occurs 
(free-variable-laden 
sentences) 
are 
open; 
otherwise 
(free-variable-free 
sentences) 
they 
are 
closed. 
The 
valence 
of 
an 
open 
sentence 
is 
the 
number 
of 
its 
different 
free 
variables. 
The 
proposition 
adduced 
by 
an 
open 
(closed) 
sentence 
is 
variant 
(invariant). 
The 
valence 
of 
a 
variant 
proposition 
is 
the 
valence 
of 
the 
open 
sentence 
it 
is 
adduced 
by. 
For 
instance 
the 
river 
x 
is 
a 
border 
of 
state 
between 
y 
and 
z 


is 
a 
trivalent 
sentence 
and 


the 
Danube 
is 
a 
border 
of 
state 
between 
y 
and 
Bulgaria 


is 
the 
monovalent 
sentence 
resulting 
from 
the 
fixation 
of 
“x” 
and 
“z”. 


15.3.1. 
I 
spoke 
repeatedly 
of 
fixations. 
The 
syntactic 
component 
of 
a 
fixation 
is 
the 
replacement 
of 
a 
variable 
with 
a 
constant, 
that 
is, 
in 
Le 
, 
the 
graphic 
integration 
transforming 
(15.iv) 
either 
in 
(15.i) 
or 
in 
(15.ii) 
or 
in 
(15.iii)). 
The 
informational 
component 
of 
a 
fixation 
is 
the 
filling 
up 
of 
the 
previous 
lack. 
A 
more 
punctual 
lexicon 
can 
distinguish 
between 
closure 
(operation 
on 
signs) 
and 
saturation 
(operation 
on 
pieces 
of 
information). 


“Conversion” 
is 
another 
term 
I 
shall 
introduce 
(§16,4) 
to 
mean 
a 
peculiar 
fixation. 
Of 
course 
“substitution” 
(§15.9) 
is 
a 
less 
punctual 
term, 
since 
it 
can 
also 
refer 
to 
a 
case 
where 
a 
variable 
is 
replaced 
by 
a 
different 
variable, 
therefore 
to 
a 
case 
where 
no 
saturation 
is 
achieved. 


15.4. 
*Variable* 
and 
*abstraction* 
are 
strictly 
related. 
With 
reference 
to 
Le 
, 
just 
owing 
to 
the 
mentioned 
correspondence 
between 
graphic 
interventions 
on 
emblems 
and 
informational 
consequences, 
we 
can 
conceive 
(15.iv) 
as 
the 
result 
of 
an 
abstraction 
concerning 
the 
various 
constants, 
that 
is 
as 
the 
result 
of 
the 
operation 
through 
which 
we 
enucleate 
what 
the 
emblems 
(15.i), 
(15.ii) 
and 
(15.iii) 
have 
in 
common. 
In 
other 
words: 
if 
we 
neglect 
the 
peculiarities 
differentiating 
the 
single 
individuals 
of 
a 
certain 
set, 
we 
get 
a 
pattern 
that, 
covering 
the 
same 
path 
in 
the 
opposite 
direction, 
ramifies 
toward 
the 
various 
individuals 
of 
the 
domain. 
To 
abstract 
is 
to 
mutilate, 
to 
prune. 
In 
this 
sense, 
although 
the 
author 
himself 
seems 
not 
to 
realize 
the 
point, 
what 
Minsky 
(1989) 
calls 
“frame” 
can 
be 
called 
“variable”. 
Also 
*archetype* 
and 
*common 
noun* 
are 
notions 
strictly 
related 
to 
*variable*. 
The 
Snake, 
trivially, 
is 
not 
the 
hyper-uranic 
snake, 
but 
the 
approximative 
image 
we 
get 
from 
the 
attributes 
characterizing 
any 
real 
snake 
(a 
limbless 
et 
cetera 
animal); 
in 
this 
sense 
the 
Snake 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
referent 
of 
the 
variable 
ranging 
over 
the 
set 
of 
snakes. 
But, 
exactly 
as 
the 
Personage 
(the 
referent 
of 
(15.iv)), 
the 
Snake 
is 
only 
the 
necessarily 
vague 
objectification 
of 
a 
necessarily 
vague 
mental 
pattern 
(obviously 
the 
more 
comprehensive 
is 
a 
pattern, 
the 
less 
detailed 
it 
is). 
Where 
the 
domain 
of 
a 
variable, 
instead 
of 
being 
constituted 
by 
a 
set 
of 
well 
distinguishable 
individuals 
(as 
the 
personages 
above) 
is 
constituted 
by 
a 
variable 
quantity 
(the 
flow 
of 
this 
river), 
the 
separation 
among 
the 
various 
individuals 
of 
the 
domain 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
convention 
(the 
various 
flows) 
and 
as 
such 
it 
results 
less 
evident; 
so 
the 
whole 
phenomenon 
is 
spontaneously 
reduced 
to 
a 
diachronic 
identity 
(the 


flow 
of 
this 
river), 
that 
is 
to 
a 
variable 
quantity. 
Nevertheless 
the 
two 
contexts 
are 
not 
separated 
by 
any 
theoretically 
momentous 
factor. 
In 
both 
of 
them 
we 
have 
a 
variable 
(a 
sign) 
a 
domain 
et 
cetera; 
the 
difference 
is 
that 
in 
some 
contexts 
the 
values 
are 
similar 
enough 
to 
be 
assumed 
as 
instances 
of 
a 
same 
and 
diachronically 
mutable 
individual. 
And 
the 
example 
of 
§15.2 
shows 
that 
the 
use 
of 
a 
variable 
is 
perfectly 
legitimate 
even 
where 
there 
is 
no 
variable 
quantity. 



In 
other 
words. 
A 
variable 
is 
not 
characterized 
by 
a 
peculiarity 
(the 
variability) 
of 
its 
referent, 
but 
by 
a 
peculiarity 
(the 
institutional 
incompleteness) 
of 
the 
information 
adduced 
by 
the 
same 
variable. 
The 
introduction 
of 
(15.iv) 
far 
from 
influencing 
the 
fact 
that 
Jesus, 
Hitler 
and 
De 
Gaulle 
keep 
on 
being 
the 
only 
members 
of 
our 
universe, 
influences 
our 
faculties 
of 
speaking 
about 
them, 
giving 
us 
the 
possibility 
to 
generalize 
our 
discourse 
by 
leaving 
the 
individual 
attributes 
out 
of 
consideration. 


15.5. 
Another 
notion 
I 
wish 
to 
compare 
with 
*variable* 
is 
*(inclusive) 
disjunction*. 
Neither 
of 
them 
singles 
out 
anything, 
yet 
while 
ascribing 
(15.vi) 
was 
a 
dictator 
to 
the 
(inclusive) 
disjunction 
of 
(15.i), 
(15.ii) 
and 
(15.iii) 
adduces 
a 
true 
(then 
a 
closed) 
proposition 
because 
at 
least 
one 
of 
the 
three 
constants 
designates 
a 
dictator, 
ascribing 
(15.vi) 
to 
(15.iv) 
adduces 
a 
variant 
proposition, 
and 
as 
such 
a 
proposition 
to 
which 
no 
alethic 
value 
can 
be 
assigned. 
Hintikka 
(1973, 
I.5 
footnote 
26) 
refuses 
to 
read 
the 
quantifiers 
as 
disjunctions 
and 
conjunctions, 
yet 
my 
opinion 
is 
different; 
according 
to 
common 
sense 
I 
think 
that 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
the 
existential 
(or 
respectively 
the 
universal) 
quantification 
of 
a 
variable 
is 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
the 
inclusive 
disjunction 
(or 
respectively 
the 
conjunction) 
of 
its 
substitutors 
and 
that, 
therefore, 
no 
variance 
occurs. 
The 
actual 
root 
of 
the 
difference 
between 


(15.vii) 
Jesus 
or 
Hitler 
or 
De 
Gaulle 
was 
a 
dictator 
and 
(15.viii) 
x 
was 
a 
dictator 
(even 
when 
it 
is 
agreed 
that 
the 
same 
variable 
ranges 
over 
Jesus, 
Hitler 
and 
De 
Gaulle) 
is 
that 
while 
(15.vii) 
adduces 
*one 
of 
those 
personages* 
(then 
no 
blank), 
(15.viii) 
adduces 
*the 
specific 
but 
here 
unspecified 
personage* 
(then 
an 
intrinsic 
blank). 
In 
neither 
case 
is 
any 
personage 
singled 
out, 
but 
a 
disjunction 
adduces 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
which, 
so 
to 
say, 
is 
self-sufficient 
although 
it 
is 
less 
than 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
a 
precise 
constant 
(under 
the 
informational 
viewpoint, 
disjoining 
is 
decreasing). 
In 
this 
sense 
I 
agree 
with 
Tarski’s 
claim 
that 
a 
variable 
is 
something 
like 
the 
blanks 
of 
a 
questionnaire; 
this 
notwithstanding 
I 
cannot 
agree 
with 
his 
claim 
that 
variables 
have 
no 
specific 
meaning, 
since 
such 
a 
claim 
mistakes 
the 
meaning 
for 
the 
referent. 
15.6. 
Also 
a 
proper 
name 
acts 
as 
a 
variable 
where 
there 
is 
a 
referential 
ambiguity. 
For 
instance, 
since 
in 
our 
party 
there 
are 
three 
fellows 
named 
“George”, 
when 
I 
confide 
(15.ix) 
George 
is 
in 
love 
to 
Bob, 
he 
immediately 
asks 
me 


George 
who? 


(“who?” 
“what?” 
et 
cetera 
are 
the 
classical 
questions 
revealing 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
free 
variable; 
and 
actually, 
in 
this 
context 
(15.ix) 
is 
an 
open 
sentence, 
“George” 
is 
a 
free 
variable, 


All 
Georges 
(of 
this 
party) 
are 
married 


is 
a 
true 
(then 
legitimate) 
quantification 
et 
cetera. 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
if 
I 
confide 
(15.ix) 
to 
the 
wife 
of 
one 
of 
the 
Georges, 
owing 
to 
the 
privileged 
role 
her 
husband 
plays 
(ought 
to 
play) 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
a 



wife, 
“George” 
becomes 
(ought 
to 
become) 
a 
constant 
designating 
a 
precise 
individual 
(her 
George, 
so 
to 
write). 
Here 
too 
the 
context 
is 
an 
important 
informational 
source; 
the 
use 
of 
a 
proper 
name 
with 
different 
referents 
in 
accordance 
with 
different 
interlocutors 
is 
a 
common 
practice, 
and 
actually 
(15.ix) 
is 
a 
closed 
sentence 
adducing 
three 
different 
propositions 
depending 
on 
which 
wife 
I 
address. 


15.6.1. 
These 
simple 
considerations 
overcome 
the 
problem 
of 
individual 
descriptions 
where 
the 
uniqueness 
condition 
is 
not 
satisfied; 
such 
descriptions 
act 
as 
variables 
et 
cetera. 
15.6.2. 
Of 
course 
referential 
ambiguity 
is 
not 
referential 
poorness. 
Bob, 
roughly 
speaking, 
has 
three 
rich 
images 
of 
his 
fellows 
named 
“George”, 
but 
he 
does 
not 
know 
which 
of 
them 
is 
the 
one 
I 
am 
speaking 
of. 
On 
the 
contrary 
if 
I 
speak 
of 
Goedel 
with 
my 
mother-in-law, 
tacit 
reference 
is 
made 
to 
the 
only 
Goedel 
she 
knows, 
that 
is 
our 
enigmatic 
cat, 
while 
if 
I 
speak 
of 
Goedel 
with 
my 
barber, 
the 
only 
result 
is 
to 
put 
him 
in 
troubles 
(nearly 
as 
if 
I 
speak 
of 
Goedel 
with 
some 
logician 
I 
know). 
15.7. 
The 
power 
of 
the 
informational 
approach 
is 
validated 
by 
its 
applicability 
to 
non-linguistic 
contexts, 
too. 
The 
theme 
will 
be 
carefully 
analyzed 
in 
next 
chapter: 
here 
I 
only 
propose 
a 
little 
example. 
The 
absolute 
silence 
of 
a 
crowded 
black-jack 
table 
is 
broken 
by 
the 
(15.x) 
you 
are 
a 
cheat 
the 
croupier 
utters 
staring 
at 
a 
precise 
gambler. 
While 
“you” 
is 
a 
constant 
for 
those 
who 
are 
looking 
at 
the 
croupier, 
since 
the 
direction 
of 
his 
eyes 
is 
the 
source 
of 
the 
informational 
integration 
necessary 
to 
single 
out 
the 
(presumed) 
cheat, 
the 
same 
pronoun 
is 
a 
variable 
(you 
who?) 
for 
those 
who 
are 
looking 
at 
the 
green 
baize 
and 
therefore 
do 
not 
perceive 
the 
stare. 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
if 
the 
croupier, 
instead 
of 
(15.x), 
says 


(15.xi) 
here 
there 
is 
a 
cheat 
he 
is 
quantifying 
($x(C(x)) 
and 
the 
proposition 
adduced 
by 
(15.xi) 
is 
true 
or 
false 
simply 
because 
it 
is 
invariant. 


15.8. 
While 
the 
connections 
relating 
*variable* 
with 
*parameter* 
and 
with 
*indeterminate* 
are 
well 
known 
and 
unproblematic, 
the 
distinction 
between 
*variable* 
and 
*unknown* 
needs 
a 
more 
punctual 
analysis. 
Though 
the 
“x” 
occurring 
properly 
in 
(15.xii) 
x 
is 
odd 
occurs 
properly 
and 
analogously 
in 


(15.xiii) 
20x 
+ 
177 
= 
133 


we 
spontaneously 
read 
(15.xii) 
as 
a 
propositional 
function 
(therefore 
its 
“x” 
as 
a 
very 
variable) 
and 


(15.xiii) 
as 
an 
equation 
(therefore 
its 
“x” 
as 
an 
unknown). 
Why? 
Because 
of 
course 
(of 
course?) 
while 
we 
read 
(15.xii) 
as 
a 
formula 
adducing 
a 
proposition 
affected 
by 
an 
intrinsic 
lack 
of 
information 
(therefore 
as 
a 
formula 
adducing 
a 
variant 
proposition 
whose 
alethic 

assignation 
requires 
a 
previous 
saturation), 
we 
read 
(15.xiii) 
as 
a 
formula 
adducing 
a 
true 
proposition 
and 
therefore 
we 
read 
its 
“x” 
as 
a 
symbol 
used 
simply 
to 
mean 
that 
at 
first 
sight 
we 
are 
not 
in 
conditions 
to 
recognize 
what 
exact 
number 
it 
designates 
(what 
numeral 
it 
stands 
for). 
The 
particular 
that 
while 
(15.xii) 
admits 
‘infinite’ 
solutions, 
(15.xiii) 
admits 
only 
one, 
probably 
favours 
this 
discrepant 
readings; 
yet 
it 
is 
unquestionable 
that 
we 
can 
also 
read 
the 
“x” 
in 
(15.xii) 
as 
an 
unknown 


(x 
=1 
or 
x 
=3 
or 
et 
cetera) 
and 
the 
“x” 
in 
(15.xiii) 
as 
a 
variable, 
thus 
making 
(15.xiii) 
a 
propositional 


function 
(recycling 
use 
of 
a 
new 
line); 
in 
this 
case, 
obviously, 
only 
an 
‘external’ 
fixation 
of 
the 
variable 
can 
transform 
the 
same 
(15.xiii) 
into 
an 
invariant 
proposition 
either 
true 
(for 
x=101) 
or 
false 
(otherwise). 


The 
distinction 
between 
variables 
and 
unknowns 
is 
then 
reduced 
to 
the 
distinction 
between 


the 
specific 
but 
here 
unspecified 
referent 


and 


the 
specific 
but 
here 
indirectly 
specified 
referent 


and 
the 
similarity 
between 
the 
two 
periphrasis 
legitimates 
the 
use 
of 
similar 
symbols, 
so 
supporting 
the 
informational 
approach. 
In 
other 
words. 
The 
use 
of 
the 
same 
symbols 
both 
for 
variables 
and 
unknowns 
is 
justified 
by 
the 
common 
situation 
of 
interpretative 
perplexity; 
yet 
while 
the 
informational 
perplexity 
determined 
by 
an 
authentic 
free 
variable 
can 
only 
be 
overcome 
by 
an 
external 
supplement 
of 
information 
(the 
fixation), 
the 
informational 
perplexity 
determined 
by 
an 
unknown 
is 
overcome 
by 
the 
information 
adduced 
by 
the 
same 
unknown-laden 
sentence. 


A 
certain 
misleading 
effect 
of 
the 
current 
terminology 
is 
that 
the 
unknown 
is 
(contextually) 
known. 
Anyhow 
I 
emphasize 
that, 
exactly 
as 
variables, 
unknowns 
too 
are 
signs, 
not 
‘quantities’. 


15.9. 
The 
substitution 
of 
variables 
is 
a 
theme 
to 
treat 
in 
meticulous 
detail; 
particularly 
because 
the 
above 
stigmatized 
ambiguity 
affecting 
*variable* 
favours 
the 
diffused 
confusion 
between 
substitutors 
and 
values. 
For 
instance 
it 
is 
rather 
usual 
to 
read 
that 
if 
“x” 
is 
a 
numerical 
variable, 
then 
numbers 
are 
its 
values, 
or 
that 
if 
we 
substitute 
to 
a 
variable 
one 
of 
its 
values 
et 
cetera. 
The 
two 
expressions 
are 
radically 
incompatible; 
the 
(proper) 
values 
of 
a 
variable 
are 
the 
members 
of 
the 
set 
constituting 
the 
domain 
of 
the 
same 
variable, 
and 
its 
(proper) 
substitutors 
are 
the 
names 
of 
its 
(proper) 
values. 
Then, 
for 
instance, 
while 
the 
(proper) 
values 
of 
a 
numerical 
variable 
are 
numbers, 
its 
(proper) 
substitutors 
are 
numerals. 


This 
simple 
distinction 
is 
very 
often 
neglected 
even 
by 
celebrated 
authors. 
The 
first 
instance 
in 
my 
hands 
involves 
Russell 
himself 
(The 
Principles 
of 
Mathematics, 
§ 
87): 
in 
order 
to 
legitimate 
a 
statement 
like 


every 
value 
of 
a 
variable 
is 
then 
a 
constant 


we 
must 
ambiguously 
agree 
that 
constants 
are 
both 
signs 
and 
represented 
values, 
so 
implicitly 
rejecting 
the 
unambiguous 
agreement 
according 
to 
which 
constants 
are 
signs 
(naming 
well 
specified 
referents). 


15.10. 
Generally 
speaking, 
the 
main 
elements 
in 
a 
substitution 
are 
four, 
and 
precisely 
-the 
situation 
ante 
substitution 
(I 
call 
it 
“initial 
configuration” 
or 
“base”) 
-what 
is 
replaced 
(“the 
substituendum”) 

what 
takes 
its 
place 
(“the 
substitutor”) 
-the 
situation 
post 
substitution 
(“final 
configuration” 
or 
“resultant”). 


15.10.1. 
A 
substitution 
can 
be 
performed 
on 
very 
different 
situations 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
very 
different 
operative 
modalities. 
For 
instance, 
let 
the 
banknotes 
in 
my 
wallet 
be 
the 
initial 
configuration, 
and 
let 
me 
consider 
the 
three 
substitutions 
where 
a 
20$ 
banknote 
is 
replaced 
respectively 
by 
(a) 
another 
$20 
banknote 
(b) 
four 
$5 
banknotes 
(c) 
one 
$10 
banknote. 
Evidently 
while 
under 
(a) 
and 
(b) 
the 
initial 
and 
the 
final 
configurations 
have 
equal 
amounts, 
under 
(a) 
and 
(c) 
they 
are 
different; 
in 
order 
to 
mean 
this 
aspect 
I 
say 
concisely 
that 
while 
(a) 
and 
(b) 
are 
conservative, 
(c) 
is 
not. 
My 
statement 
is 
concise 
because, 
strictly, 
the 
notion 
of 
conservativeness 
is 
relative 
to 
a 
certain 
criterion 
(the 
purchasing 
power, 
in 
this 
case); 
in 
fact 
if 
the 
criterion 
were 
the 
number 
of 
banknotes 
in 
my 
wallet, 
(a) 
and 
(c) 
would 
be 
conservative 
and 
(b) 
would 
not. 
In 
this 
sense 
the 
correct 
expression 
must 
speak 
of 
conservativeness 
as 
regards 
a 
certain 
criterion; 
and 
preciselyt 
because 
when 
we 
deal 
with 
banknotes 
the 
main 
criterion 
is 
their 
purchasing 
power, 
if 
the 
specification 
is 
wanting 
we 
are 
induced 
to 
think 
of 
the 
economic 
value. 
I 
agree 
that 
“X-conservative” 
abbreviates 


“conservative 
as 
regards 
the 
criterion 
X”, 
and 
that 


u’ 
= 
Subst(u° 
20$/10$) 


symbolizes 
the 
(c) 
substitution, 
being 
u° 
and 
u’ 
the 
initial 
and 
the 
final 
configuration 
of 
my 
wallet. 


15.10.1.1. 
To 
speak 
of 
substitutions 
where 
the 
initial 
configuration 
is 
not 
modified 
(where 
the 
original 
$20 
banknote 
is 
‘substituted’ 
by 
the 
same 
banknote) 
would 
evidently 
be 
a 
terminological 
abuse; 
in 
fact 
“substitute” 
means 
*to 
put 
something 
in 
place 
of 
something 
else* 
and 
*else* 
is 
intrinsically 
incompatible 
with 
*same*. 
Just 
in 
this 
sense 
I 
remarked 
in 
§7.2.2 
that 
“substitution 
of 
identity” 
is 
an 
oxymoron. 
15.11. 
Logic 
is 
firstly 
interested 
in 
linguistic 
substitutions, 
that 
is 
in 
substitutions 
whose 
bases, 
substituends, 
substitutors 
and 
resultants 
are 
linguistic 
expressions. 
In 
order 
to 
limit 
the 
analysis 
to 
the 
very 
problems 
themselves, 
I 
only 
deal 
with 
particular 
linguistic 
substitutions, 
and 
precisely 
with 
substitutions 
whose 
bases 
are 
syntactically 
and 
semantically 
proper 
atomic 
sentences 
(of 
course 
a 
sentence 
is 
syntactically 
proper 
iff 
it 
respects 
the 
well 
formation 
rules 
and 
semantically 
proper 
iff 
it 
is 
not 
affected 
by 
any 
sortal 
improperness). 
Furthermore 
the 
general 
formulation 
of 
an 
atomic 
sentence 


Rn(u1,…., 
un) 


is 
epitomized 
in 


P(u) 
where 
P 
(without 
inverted 
commas, 
I 
am 
not 
speaking 
of 
the 
ML-symbol 
in 
boldface, 
but 
of 
an 


unspecified 
object 
predicate 
as, 
for 
instance, 
“<(x+y-z)”) 
is 
just 
an 
n–adic 
object 
relator 
et 
cetera. 


Therefore 
a 
substitution 
(performed 
on 
a 
syntactically 
and 
semantically 
proper 
base) 
-is 
syntactically 
proper 
iff 
substituends 
and 
substitutors 
have 
the 
same 
syntactical 
status 
-is 
semantically 
proper 
iff 
substituends 
and 
substitutors 
are 
semantically 
homogeneous 
-is 
proper 
iff 
it 
is 
syntactically 
and 
semantically 
proper. 


So, 
for 
instance, 
let 



V(b) 


(Bob 
is 
vegetarian) 
be 
the 
(true 
or 
false, 
but 
anyhow 
proper) 
initial 
sentence. 
Then 
Subst 
(“V(b)” 
“b”/“V”) 
is 


V(V) 
that 
is 
a 
syntactically 
improper 
sentence. 
Analogously, 
once 
“Q” 
is 
assumed 
to 
symbolize 
“quadratic”, 


Subst 
(“V(b)” 
“V”/“Q”) 
is 


Q(b) 


that 
is 
a 
syntactically 
proper 
(both 
the 
substituend 
and 
the 
substitutor 
are 
adjectives 
and 
both 
of 
them 
belong 
to 
L), 
but 
a 
semantically 
improper 
sentence 
(the 
adduced 
attributes 
are 
heterogeneous, 
since 
*vegetarian* 
concerns 
living 
beings, 
while 
*quadratic* 
concerns 
numbers). 


A 
quite 
peculiar 
kind 
of 
semantically 
improper 
substitutions 
are 
the 
projectively 
improper 
ones. 
For 
instance, 
since 
in 


(15.xiv) 
Subst 
(“V(b)” 
“b”/“ 
“b””) 
both 
the 
substitutend 
and 
the 
substitutor 
have 
the 
same 
syntactical 
status 
(both 
of 
them 
are 
terms), 
the 
substitution 
is 
syntactically 
proper 
(indeed 
(15.xv) 
V(“b”) 
is 
a 
syntactically 
proper 
sentence). 
This 
notwithstanding, 
since 
manifestly 
a 
name 
(“Bob”, 
in 
this 
case) 
cannot 
be 
vegetarian, 
(15.xv) 
is 
semantically 
improper. 
What 
makes 
it 
a 
projectively 
improper 
sentence 
(then 
what 
makes 
(15.xiv) 
a 
projectively 
improper 
substitution) 
is 
the 
peculiar 
link 
between 
the 
susbstituend 
and 
the 
substitutor, 
that 
is 
the 
name-relation). 
A 
projectively 
improper 
substitution 
occurs 
wherever 
the 
substitutor 
and 
the 
substitutend 
belong 
to 
different 
dialinguistic 
orders 
(in 
our 
case 
the 
substitutor 
belongs 
to 
the 
metalanguage 
of 
the 
language 
the 
substituend 
belongs 
to). 
The 
example 
(15.xiv) 
has 
been 
purposely 
chosen 
in 
order 
to 
make 
evident 
its 
projective 
improperness: 
while 
it 
is 
rather 
improbable 
to 
confuse 
a 
man 
with 
his 
name, 
it 
is 
much 
less 
improbable 
to 
confuse 
a 
name 
with 
its 
name 
(we 
shall 
see 
in 
due 
course 
how 
insidious 
is 
such 
a 
kind 
of 
improperness). 
15 
12. 
A 
(linguistic) 
substitution 
is 
m-conservative 
(meaning-conservative) 
iff 
its 
base 
and 
its 
resultant 
adduce 
the 
same 
piece 
of 
information 
(have 
the 
same 
meaning). 
So, 
for 
instance, 
Subst 
(“Jim 
is 
cowardly” 
“cowardly”/”brave”) 
is 
a 
proper 
yet 
a 
non-m-conservative 
substitution. 


An 
m-conservative 
substitution, 
of 
course, 
is 
alethically 
conservative 
(À-conservative); 
in 
fact, 


since 
alethic 
values 
concern 
pieces 
of 
information, 
an 
m-conservative 
substitution 
cannot 
modify 
the 
alethic 
value 
of 
the 
unmodified 
piece 
of 
information 
both 
the 
initial 
and 
the 
final 
configuration 
adduce. 
This 
conclusion 
can 
be 
extrapolated 
as 
follows 
on 
the 
ground 
of 
the 
Theorems 
of 
Restriction 
and 


Expansion 
(§8.16). 
If 
the 
initial 
proposition 
is 
k-true 
and 
the 
substitutor 
adduces 
a 
piece 
of 
information 


implied 
by 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 
the 
substituend, 
then 
the 
resulting 
proposition 
too 
is 
k-
true. 
Concisely: 
a 
restrictive 
substitution 
is 
truth-conservative. 
Reciprocally, 
if 
the 
initial 
proposition 
is 
k-false 
and 
the 
substitutor 
adduces 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
implying 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
adduced 
by 


the 
substituend, 
then 
the 
resulting 
proposition 
too 
is 
k-false. 
Concisely: 
an 
expansive 
substitution 
is 


falsity-conservative. 
Of 
course 
an 
m-conservative 
substitution 
is 
both 
restrictive 
and 
expansive, 


therefore 
it 
is 
both 
truth-conservative 
and 
falsity-conservative 
(that 
is, 
À-conservative). 



15.13. 
In 
order 
to 
conform 
(provisionally) 
this 
text 
to 
the 
habitual 
terminology, 
in 
the 
subsequent 
sections 
truth 
and 
falsity 
will 
be 
directly 
ascribed 
to 
formulas 
and 
sentences. 
Therefore 
an 
expression 
like 
“the 
formula 
so 
and 
so 
is 
false” 
must 
be 
read 
as 
an 
abbreviation 
of 
“the 
proposition 
adduced 
by 
the 
formula 
so 
and 
so 
is 
false” 
or 
of 
“the 
formula 
so 
and 
so 
is 
fallacious”. 
For 
instance 
(metalinguistic 
newline) 
(15.xvi) 
Subst(“x<f0” 
“x”/”ff0”)=”ff0<f0” 


the 
L-constant 
“ff0” 
to 
the 
L-variable 
“x” 
occurring 
in 
the 
open 
L-formula 
“x<0” 
we 
obtain 
the 


closed 
L-formula 
”ff0<f0”. 
Indeed 
(15.xvi) 
is 
a 
closed 
ML-formula 
(no 
ML-variable 
occurs 
in 
(15.xvi) 


since 
in 
ML 
the 
name 
of 
any 
L-variable 
is 
a 
constant); 
and 
actually 
(15.xvi) 
is 
true 
because 
the 
described 
substitution 
actually 
yields 
the 
described 
resultant. 
Nevertheless 
(metalinguistic 
new-line) 


(15.xvii) 
ff0<f0 


is 
an 
evidently 
false 
L-formula. 
This 
alethic 
independence, 
owing 
to 
the 
(projective) 
difference 
between 
two 
dialinguistic 
orders, 
is 
absolutely 
unproblematic; 
in 
fact 
(let 
me 
insist) 
-(15.xvi) 
speaks 
(in 
ML) 
of 
a 
relation 
between 
the 
operation 
on 
L-symbols 
described 
at 
first 
member 


and 
the 
L-formula 
at 
second 
member, 
then 
(15.xvi) 
is 
true 
because 
actually 
such 
an 
operation 
yields 


exactly 
the 
formula 
at 
second 
member; 
-(15.xvii) 
speaks 
(in 
L) 
of 
a 
relation 
between 
numbers; 
then 
it 
is 
false 
because 
actually 
such 
a 
relation 
(to 
be 
less 
than) 
does 
not 
link 
the 
numbers 
that 
(15.xvii) 
speaks 
of. 


Reciprocally 
(15.xviii) 
Subst(“x<f0” 
“x”/”ff0”)=”f0<ff0” 
is 
false 
because 
the 
described 
substitution 
does 
not 
yield 
the 
described 
resultant, 
which 
nevertheless 
is 
true 
because 
et 
cetera. 


15.13.1. 
In 
general 
Subst(A 
v/n) 
is 
the 
substitution 
performed 
on 
an 
L-formula 
A, 
(here 
too 
without 
inverted 
commas, 
I 
am 
not 
speaking 


of 
the 
ML-symbol 
in 
boldface, 
but 
of 
an 
unspecified 
object 
formula 
as, 
for 
instance, 
“x<f0”) 
by 


replacing 
the 
variable 
v 
(as, 
for 
instance. 
“x”) 
with 
the 
numeral 
n 
(as, 
for 
instance 
“ff0”). 
The 


(sometimes 
very 
insidious) 
danger 
to 
avoid 
is 
mistaking 
a 
ML-variable 
like 
“v” 
(within 
inverted 


commas, 
now 
I 
am 
speaking 
of 
the 
symbol 
in 
boldface) 
with 
a 
L-variable 
like 
“x”; 
the 
former 
variable 


ranges 
over 
L-symbols, 
the 
latter 
over 
numbers). 
I 
wrote 
“sometimes 
very 
insidious” 
because 
peculiar 


conventions 
are 
possible 
(arithmetizations), 
under 
which 
both 
ML-variables 
and 
L-variables 
range 
over 
numbers, 
so 
masking 
a 
potentially 
pernicious 
projective 
improperness. 


15.13.1.1. 
The 
relationship 
between 
ML-variables 
and 
L-variables 
is 
manifestly 
connected 
with 
the 
relation 
(§3.8.1 
and 
§3.8.2) 
between 
*to 
abbreviate* 
(linking 
“Bob” 
with 
“Robert”) 
and 
*to 
denominate* 
(linking 
“Bob” 
with 
Bob). 
Since 
this 
passage 
is 
highly 
consequential, 
I 
will 
be 
pedantic. 
Both 
the 
“x” 
occurring 
in 
(15.xii) 
and 
the 
“n” 
occurring 
in 
n 
is 
a 
numeral 



deal 
with 
numerals. 
Yet 
while 
“x” 
is 
an 
abbreviative 
variable 
which 
then 
stands 
for 
a 
numeral 
(so 
that 
any 
sentence 
obtained 
by 
erasing 
such 
variable 
and 
by 
writing 
a 
numeral 
in 
its 
place 
as 
for 
instance 
fff0 
is 
odd 
is 
a 
proper 
sentence 
(speaking 
of 
the 
number 
3, 
in 
the 
case), 
the 
latter 
is 
a 
designative 
variable, 
and 
as 


such, 
once 
erased, 
must 
be 
replaced 
by 
the 
name 
of 
a 
numeral; 
and 
in 
fact 
“fff0” 
is 
a 
numeral 
is 
a 
proper 
sentence 
(speaking 
of 
the 
expression 
naming 
the 
number 
3). 


In 
other 
words, 
numerals 
-are 
the 
substitutors 
of 
“x” 
because 
they 
name 
numbers 
and 
the 
domain 
of 
“x” 
is 
just 
constituted 
by 
numbers: 
-are 
the 
values 
of 
“n” 
because 
the 
domain 
of 
“n” 
is 
just 
constituted 
by 
numerals. 


15.13.2. 
I 
take 
advantage 
of 
the 
occasion 
for 
a 
quite 
collateral 
(yet 
theoretically 
momentous) 
consideration. 
In 
the 
formal 
approach 
to 
arithmetic 
the 
names 
of 
the 
various 
numbers 
are 
not 
“0”, 
“1”, 
“2” 
et 
cetera, 
but 
“0” 
“f0”, 
“ff0” 
et 
cetera. 
Since 
what 
does 
vary 
is 
the 
number 
of 
“f”s 
concatenated 
to 
a 
final 
“0”, 
the 
adequate 
choice 
of 
the 
respective 
variables 
ought 
to 
substitute 
“x”, 
“y” 
et 
cetera 
with 
something 
like 
"x0", 
"y0" 
et 
cetera 
(of 
course 
this 
consideration 
concerns 
metamathematics, 
since 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
the 
usual 
choice 
is 
more 
economic 
for 
minute 
mathematical 
uses). 
The 
theoretical 
importance 
of 
the 
mentioned 
new 
variables 
is 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
direct 
(non-recursive) 
definition 
of 
addition 
(x0+ 
y0= 
xy0); 
and 
the 
fact 
that, 
nevertheless, 
multiplication 
could 
not 
be 
defined 
directly, 
offers 
wide 
room 
of 
reflection 
about 
the 
respective 
consequences 
on 
the 
incompleteness 
(Presburger). 
15.14. 
The 
choice 
of 
the 
variables 
occurring 
in 
a 
formula 
is 
an 
absolutely 
crucial 
topic. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
concision, 
let 
me 
refer 
to 
numerical 
variables. 
Since 
they 
all 
adduce 
the 
same 
piece 
of 
information 
(roughly: 
*the 
number 
to 
specify*), 
the 
choice 
of 
“x” 
or 
“y” 
et 
cetera 
is 
arbitrary 
under 
many 
aspects. 
Yet 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
complexity 
of 
the 
formula 
increases, 
that 
is, 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
numbers 
to 
specify 
are 
more 
than 
one, 
the 
choice 
is 
conditioned 
by 
the 
necessity 
to 
respect 
the 
identity 
and 
non-identity 
among 
the 
various 
unspecified 
numbers 
we 
are 
speaking 
of 
through 
the 
identity 
and 
non-identity 
among 
the 
respective 
variables. 
Therefore 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
undue 
interferences 
and 
highly 
misleading 
conclusions 
our 
choice 
must 
comply 
with 
the 
two 
following 
rules: 
R1: 
not 
to 
choose 
the 
same 
variable 
for 
non-necessarily 
identical 
numbers 
(or, 
worse, 
for 
necessarily 
non-identical 
numbers) 
R2: 
not 
to 
choose 
different 
variables 
for 
necessarily 
identical 
numbers. 


15.14.1. 
The 
two 
rules 
are 
nearly 
obvious, 
yet 
I 
support 
them 
by 
some 
example. 
Since 
both 
(15.xix) 
x/y=z 
and 
(15.xx) 
x/w=z 
say 
generically 
that 
a 
certain 
number 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
ratio 
of 
two 
others, 
(15.xix) 
and 
(15.xx) 
are 
interchangeable 
formulations. 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
(15.xxi) 
(.x=yz) 
É 
(x/y=z) 
symbolizes 
correctly 
an 
elementary 
mathematical 
truth, 
and 
(15.xix) 
is 
the 
apodosis 
of 
(15.xxi); 
this 
notwithstanding 
the 
substitution 
of 
(15.xx) 
to 
(15.xix) 
in 
such 
an 
apodosis 
would 
lead 
to 
(15.xxii) 
(x=yz)É(x/w=z) 

and 
(15.xxii) 
is 
an 
evidently 
unacceptable 
formula 
because 
“w” 
does 
not 
witness 
the 
necessary 
identity 
with 
the 
number 
indicated 
by 
“y” 
in 
the 
protasis, 
that 
is 
because 
R2 
is 
violated. 
Reciprocally 


(15.xxiii) 
(x=yz) 
É 
(x/y=y) 
is 
an 
evidently 
unacceptable 
formula 
because 
the 
third 
occurrence 
of 
“y” 
in 
the 
apodosis 
of 
(15.xxiii) 
entails 
a 
false 
identity 
between 
the 
divisor 
and 
the 
result 
of 
the 
division, 
that 
is 
because 
R1 
is 
violated. 
Let 
me 
insist 
through 
a 
comprehensive 
example. 
While 


$ 
u(u<y) 


and 


$ 
u(u<x) 


are 
interchangeable 
formulations 


(x+y 
≠ 
x) 
É 
$u(u<y) 


is 
a 
true 
conditional, 
but 


(15.xxiv) 
(x+y 
≠ 
x) 
É 
$ 
u(u<x) 
is 
false, 
exactly 
because 
the 
last 
occurrence 
of 
"x" 
violates 
both 
R1 
and 
R2; 
in 
fact, 
with 
reference 
to 


the 
last 
variable 
occurring 
in 
(15.xxiv), 
whatever 
choice 
different 
from 
"y" 
violates 
R1 
because 
it 
does 


not 
witness 
an 
actual 
identity 
with 
the 
“y” 
occurring 
in 
the 
protasis, 
moreover 
the 
choice 
of 
"x" 


violates 
R2, 
too, 
because 
it 
entails 
an 
abusive 
identity 
with 
the 
“x” 
already 
occurring 
in 
the 
protasis. 


15.15. 
The 
well 
known 
condition 
ruling 
the 
substitutions 
where 
variables 
occur 
(the 
substitutor 
must 
be 
free 
for 
the 
substituendum) 
is 
usually 
justified 
by 
an 
empirical 
procedure, 
that 
is 
by 
exhibiting 
examples 
where 
some 
absurdity 
is 
derived 
from 
the 
violation 
of 
the 
mentioned 
condition 
(cf. 
for 
instance 
Kleene 
1971; 
§18 
Example 
8; 
Hermes 
1973, 
IX 
§1; 
Shoenfield 
1967 
§2.4). 
The 
informational 
approach 
allows 
a 
theoretical 
explanation, 
just 
by 
remembering 
the 
necessity 
to 
avoid 
undue 
identifications. 
In 
fact 
if 
the 
substituendum 
occurs 
free 
in 
the 
scope 
of 
a 
quantifier 
concerning 
a 
variable 
occurring 
in 
the 
substitutor, 
then 
the 
substitution 
would 
violate 
R2 
by 
establishing 
an 
undue 
identity 
(that 
is 
an 
identity 
absent 
in 
the 
initial 
formula). 
The 
formal 
procedure 
to 
avoid 
such 
a 
risk, 
that 
is 
the 
re-denomination 
of 
the 
bound 
variables 
(Hermes, 
ibidem 
IX 
§2) 
is 
simply 
the 
way 
to 
restore 
the 


respect 
of 
R2. 
The 
fundamental 
conclusion 
is 
that 
a 
substitution 
may 
restrict 
the 
arbitrariness 
in 
the 
choice 
of 
variables. 


15.16. 
The 
informational 
approach 
to 
*variable* 
allows 
also 
the 
derivation 
of 
(15.xxv) 
$xP(x) 
from 
(15.xxvi) 
P(a) 
and 
the 
derivation 
of 
(15.xxvi) 
from 
(15.xxvii) 
"xP(x) 
because 
(15.xxv) 
is 
a 
restriction 
of 
(15.xxvi) 
and 
(15.xxvi) 
is 
a 
restriction 
of 
(15.xxvii), 
therefore 
the 
truth 
of 
(15.xxvi) 
implies 
the 
truth 
of 
(15.xxv) 
and 
the 
truth 
of 
(15.xxvii) 
implies 
the 
truth 
of 
(15.xxvi). 
An 
analogous 
achievement 
is 
§17.5.2. 

CHAPTER 
16 
INDEXICALITY 


1. 
Just 
in 
the 
moment 
when 
the 
object 
seems 
to 
be 
caught 
in 
its 
immediateness, 
it 
dissolves 
in 
the 
total 
interchangeableness 
of 
every 
single 
in 
front 
of 
the 
abstractive 
power 
of 
the 
language, 
which 
then 
comes 
forth 
as 
the 
exclusive 
possible 
object 
of 
itself: 
it 
is 
the 
Spirit 
that 
reveals 
itself 
in 
the 
linguistic 
act 
just 
as 
the 
Word 
reveals 
himself 
in 
the 
Incarnation. 
More 
or 
less 
(I 
quote 
by 
memory) 
this 
is 
Hegel’s 
subduing 
opinion 
on 
indexicality. 
Of 
course 
I 
will 
face 
the 
matter 
from 
a 
much 
more 
trivial 
(but 
a 
little 
less 
metaphysic) 
viewpoint. 
In 
order 
to 
avoid 
superfluous 
distinctions, 
I 
assume 
that 
the 
language 
under 
scrutiny 
is 
free 
from 
any 
homonymy 
and 
any 
metaphoric 
use. 
2. 
Indexicality 
is 
a 
very 
important 
but 
a 
rather 
neglected 
matter. 
I 
call 
“indexical” 
an 
expression 
adducing 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
which 
depends 
on 
the 
context, 
and 
I 
call 
“absolute” 
a 
non-indexical 
expression, 
that 
is 
an 
expression 
adducing 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
which 
does 
not 
depend 
on 
the 
context. 
So, 
for 
instance, 
“aborigine”, 
“your”, 
“here” 
are 
indexical 
expressions, 
“Papuan” 
“owned 
by 
Ronald 
Reagan”, 
“spherical” 
are 
absolute 
expressions. 
“Papuan” 
is 
absolute 
because 
(roughly) 
it 
will 
always 
and 
anyhow 
mean 
an 
individual 
born 
in 
Polinesia, 
“aborigine” 
is 
indexical 
because 
it 
will 
mean 
a 
Papuan 
if 
the 
discourse 
concerns 
Polynesia, 
precisely 
as 
it 
will 
mean 
an 
Eskimo 
if 
the 
discourse 
concerns 
Greenland 
and 
so 
on 
(that 
is: 
“aborigine” 
adduces 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
which 
depends 
on 
its 
contingent 
utterance). 
2.1. 
As 
far 
as 
I 
know, 
indexical 
expressions 
are 
present 
in 
every 
natural 
language. 
The 
reason 
is 
that 
the 
basic 
problem 
of 
any 
communication 
is 
to 
find 
an 
informational 
ground 
shared 
by 
speaker 
and 
interpreter; 
and 
undoubtedly 
the 
same 
context 
(in 
particular 
the 
same 
utterance), 
is 
often 
the 
most 
immediate 
common 
evidence. 
2.2. 
Ellipses 
(omissions) 
too 
can 
have 
an 
indexical 
import. 
For 
instance 
it 
is 
raining 
is 
a 
doubly 
indexical 
expression; 
but 
while 
the 
when 
is 
adduced 
by 
the 
verbal 
tense 
(*is* 
entails 
*in 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
utterance*) 
the 
where 
is 
adduced 
by 
an 
omitted 
”here”. 
3. 
Indexical 
expressions 
are 
strictly 
related 
to 
variables 
and 
unknowns, 
since 
they 
too 
adduce 
a 
lack 
of 
information 
(henceforth: 
a 
blank). 
The 
reason 
why 
the 
indexical 
expressions 
we 
usually 
read 
do 
not 
communicate 
blanks, 
but 
plainly 
understandable 
pieces 
of 
information 
is 
that 
usually 
they 
are 
inserted 
in 
a 
context 
able 
to 
saturate 
(Chapter 
15, 
§3.1) 
the 
same 
blanks. 
Two 
kinds 
of 
indexicality 
(the 
textual 
and 
the 
deictic 
ones) 
can 
then 
be 
immediately 
distinguished: 
in 
textual 
indexicality 
the 
contextual 
source 
saturating 
the 
blank 
is 
linguistic, 
in 
deictic 
indexicality 
it 
is 
extra-linguistic 
since 
it 
depends 
on 
some 
contingencies 
of 
the 
utterance 
(the 
speaker, 
the 
interlocutor, 
the 
moment, 
the 
place 
et 
cetera). 
For 
instance, 
in 
Tom’s 
comment, 


6. 
Yesterday 
Bob 
dismissed 
all 
his 
grooms, 
and 
tomorrow 
they 
will 
apply 
to 
their 
trade-union 

seven 
indexical 
expressions 
occur 
(“yesterday”, 
“his”, 
“tomorrow”, 
“they”, 
“their” 
and 
the 
two 
verbal 
tenses). 
Yet 
I 
understand 
perfectly 
his 
message 
because 
all 
the 
seven 
blanks 
are 
saturated 
through 
the 
context. 
Three 
of 
them 
are 
promoted 
to 
absoluteness 
by 
a 
grammatical 
antecedent, 
then 
by 
a 
textual 
source 
of 
information 
(His 
of 
whom? 
Of 
Bob. 
They 
who? 
His 
grooms, 
therefore 
Bob’s 
grooms. 
Their 
of 
whom? 
Of 
Bob’s 
groom), 
and 
the 
remaining 
four 
are 
promoted 
to 
absoluteness 
by 
extra-textual 
(deictic) 
informational 
sources 
that 
is 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
moment 
Tom 
speaks 
(Yesterday 
when? 
The 
day 
before 
the 
day 
(i) 
is 
uttered 
et 
cetera). 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
completeness 
(incidentally: 
in 
my 
lexicon, 
“sake 
of 
completeness” 
and 
“boring 
pedantry” 
denote 
the 
same 
attitude, 
the 
only 
difference 
is 
that 
the 
former 
refers 
to 
myself 
and 
friends, 
the 
latter 
to 
my 
opponents), 
then 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
completeness 
I 
note 
that 
the 
classification 
could 
be 
refined, 
for 
instance 
by 
distinguishing 
a 
chrononymic 
indexicality 
(“tomorrow” 
...) 
from 
a 
toponymic 
indexicality 
(“here” 
...) 
and 
so 
on. 


3.1. 
Obviously 
an 
indexical 
expression 
appealing 
to 
an 
unattainable 
source 
of 
integrative 
information 
fails 
in 
its 
promotion 
to 
absoluteness. 
For 
instance 
while 
(ii) 
we 
are 
sinking 
at 
7°22’East, 
42°38’North 
is 
a 
sensible 
radio 
mayday, 
(iii) 
we 
are 
sinking 
at 
0908GMT, 
February 
the 
14, 
1978 
would 
be 
an 
astonishing 
stupidity. 
In 
fact 
a 
radio 
broadcast 
does 
deictically 
provide 
the 
when, 
not 
the 
where, 
and 
as 
such 
the 
broadcasted 
text, 
as 
in 
(ii), 
must 
provide 
the 
unknown 
where; 
on 
the 
contrary 
in 
(iii) 
the 
when 
is 
both 
deictically 
and 
textually 
provided, 
but 
the 
where 
remains 
unknown. 
4. 
I 
call 
-“conversion” 
a 
fixation 
performed 
through 
the 
context; 
-“effective 
(for 
an 
indexical 
expression)” 
a 
context 
iff 
it 
allows 
the 
conversion 
of 
such 
an 
indexical 
expression; 
-“defective 
(for 
an 
indexical 
expression)” 
a 
context 
iff 
it 
is 
not 
effective 
for 
such 
an 
indexical 
expression. 


For 
instance, 
if 
Tom 
tells 
me 


(iv) 
He 
is 
an 
unforeseeable 
guy 
when 
we 
are 
speaking 
of 
Hildegard 
von 
Bingen 
along 
a 
desert 
road, 
the 
context 
is 
defective 
(he 
who?); 
on 
the 
contrary 
if 
Tom 
utters 
(iv) 
when 
we 
are 
speaking 
of 
Bob 
or 
when 
Bob 
itself 
is 
hailing 
us 
from 
his 
magnificent 
coupé, 
the 
context 
is 
effective 
because 
the 
blank 
is 
deictically 
saturated 
(he 
who? 
the 
protagonist 
of 
our 
present 
attention, 
that 
is 
Bob). 
5. 
The 
informational 
approach, 
thanks 
to 
its 
distinction 
between 
textual 
and 
deictic 
indexicality, 
shows 
that 
Quine’s 
claim 
(also 
Dowty, 
Wall, 
Peters, 
1989 
p. 
68) 
according 
to 
which 
in 
ordinary 
languages 
variables 
are 
pronouns 
without 
any 
grammatical 
antecedent 
is 
highly 
reductive 
Let 
me 
get 
it 
straight. 
Currently 
the 
anaphoric 
function 
is 
the 
function 
selecting 
the 
grammatical 
antecedent 
of 
an 
indexical 
expression. 
Yet, 
as 
soon 
as 
deictic 
indexicalities 
too 
are 
considered, 
no 
grammatical 
antecedent 
does 
exist, 
therefore 
the 
same 
notion 
of 
an 
antecedent 
must 
be 
widened, 
and 
the 
anaphoric 
function 
becomes 
the 
function 
selecting 
the 
integrative 
informational 
source 
through 
which 
the 
blank 
adduced 
by 
the 
indexical 
expression 
under 
scrutiny 
is 
saturated. 
A 
first 
example 
is 
the 
already 
mentioned 
you 
are 
a 
cheat 
(Chapter 
15, 
§7). 
Since 
the 
same 
“you” 
which 
acts 
as 
a 
variable 
(you 
who?) 
for 
those 
who 
are 
looking 
at 
the 
green 
baize 
singles 
out 
a 
specific 
gambler 
for 
those 
who 
are 
looking 
at 
the 
croupier, 



the 
source 
of 
the 
informational 
integration 
necessary 
to 
convert 
the 
pronoun, 
therefore 
its 
antecedent, 
is 
exactly 
the 
direction 
of 
his 
stare. 
A 
second 
example. 
Both 
the 
Bob 
presented 
me 
with 
a 
nice 
manual 
drill; 
in 
spite 
of 
its 
antiquity, 
this 
drill 
is 
still 
a 


very 
efficient 
tool 
Tom 
tells 
me 
when 
we 
are 
walking 
far 
from 
any 
drill, 
and, 
two 
hours 
later, 
the 
This 
drill 
would 
not 
bore 
even 
butter! 
Tom 
himself 
tells 
the 
devil, 
when 
he 
is 
trying 
in 
vain 
to 
bore 
a 
thin 
wooden 
wall 
using 
the 
just 
mentioned 
very 
efficient 
tool, 
are 
indexical 
statements; 
in 
both 
of 
them 
the 
conversion 
of 
“this 
drill” 
is 
effective 
(no 
doubt 
about 
the 
drill 
Tom 
is 
speaking 
of). 
Yet 
while 
in 
the 
former 
case 
the 
source 
of 
information 
on 
whose 
basis 
the 
conversion 
has 
been 
performed 
is 
textual 
(Tom’s 
previous 
words 
describing 
Bob’s 
present) 
in 
the 
latter 
it 
is 
deictic 
(the 
damned 
tool 
Tom 
has 
in 
his 
hands); 
therefore 
the 
anaphoric 
function 
appeals 
to 
a 
non-linguistic 
(ostensive) 
antecedent. 
The 
existence 
of 
non 
linguistic 
antecedents 
is 
a 
strong 
piece 
of 
evidence 
supporting 
the 
power 
of 
the 


informational 
approach. 
Anyway 
from 
now 
on 
I 
only 
deal 
with 
the 
textual 
indexicality, 
thus 
the 
formal 
exigency 
to 
have 
expressions 
as 
saturating 
sources 
is 
satisfied, 
and 
the 
use 
of 
“grammatical 
antecedents” 
to 
mean 
such 
sources 
is 
etymologically 
justified. 
A 
pedantry. 
An 
antecedent 
can 
also 
be 
subsequent 
to 
and 
far 
from 
‘its’ 
indexical 
expression. 
For 
instance 
the 
grammatical 
antecedent 
of 
the 
various 
“I” 
occurring 
in 
a 
long 
letter 
is 
its 
signature, 
then 
the 
last 
word. 


5.1. 
Once 
the 
approach 
is 
well 
understood, 
translating 
syntactic 
formulations 
into 
semantic 
ones 
is 
an 
easy 
task. 
For 
instance 
saying 
that 
a 
free 
variable 
cannot 
be 
fixed 
through 
a 
substitutor 
where 
the 
same 
variable 
occurs 
free, 
is 
saying 
that 
an 
informational 
blank 
cannot 
be 
saturated 
through 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
affected 
by 
the 
same 
blank. 
5.2. 
The 
attempt 
at 
formalizing 
the 
anaphoric 
function 
on 
mere 
syntactical 
criteria 
is 
utopia 
itself. 
In 
fact 
a 
minute 
example 
shows 
that 
the 
selection 
of 
the 
right 
antecedent 
may 
require 
semantic 
considerations, 
too. 
The 
syntactical 
structure 
of 
(v) 
Yesterday 
Dan 
killed 
Ted, 
and 
today 
he 
has 
been 
arrested 
is 
exactly 
the 
same 
of 
(vi) 
Yesterday 
Dan 
killed 
Ted, 
and 
today 
he 
has 
been 
buried 
nevertheless 
what 
we 
actually 
understand 
by 
reading 
(v) 
and 
(vi) 
is 
that 
Dan 
has 
been 
arrested 
and 
Ted 
has 
been 
buried; 
therefore, 
since 
the 
antecedent 
of 
“he” 
is 
the 
subject 
“Dan” 
in 
(v) 
and 
the 
complement 
“Ted” 
in 
(vi), 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
formalize 
on 
mere 
syntactical 
data 
a 
conversion 
depending 
on 
*to 
be 
arrested* 
and 
*to 
be 
buried*. 
I 
think 
that, 
in 
order 
to 
theorize 
the 
rules 
of 
conversion, 
linguists 
ought 
not 
to 
neglect 
the 
criterion 
of 
interpretative 
collaboration 
(the 
principle 
of 
charity), 
thus 
joining 
the 
syntactical 
and 
the 
semantic 
approach. 
Fortunately 
accomplishing 
this 
theorization 
is 
not 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
prosecute 
my 
discourse, 
since 
the 
sentences 
of 
specific 
interest 
(the 
paradoxical 
and 
the 
para-paradoxical 
ones) 
are 
not 
affected 
by 
any 
doubt 
about 
the 
conversion 
of 
their 
variables. 
Anyhow, 
awaiting 
deeper 
considerations, 
we 
can 
agree 
that 
the 
right 
antecedent 
is 
the 
nearest 
available 
term, 
assuming 
that 
a 
term 
is 
available 
iff 
the 
resulting 
statement 
is 
not 
senseless 
(a 
corpse 
cannot 
be 
arrested). 


6. 
Let 
me 
propose 
a 
detailed 
example 
which 
will 
be 
quite 
useful 
also 
in 
due 
course. 
I 
call 
-“far” 
(symbolically 
“F”) 
a 
couple 
of 
towns 
x 
and 
y 
iff 
the 
distance 
d 
between 
them 
is 
more 
than 
500 
kilometres 



-“far 
from 
y" 
(“Fy”) 
a 
town 
x 
iff 
the 
respective 
couple 
is 
far 
-“barbarous” 
(“B”) 
a 
town 
iff 
it 
is 
far 
from 
Athens 
(“Fa”) 


-“peripheral” 
(“P”, 
provisionally) 
a 
town 
iff 
it 
is 
far 
from 
its 
capital. 
Then 
the 
respective 
symbolic 
definitions 
are 


(vii) 
F 
(4.x,y) 
« 
dx.y 
> 
500 
(viii) 
Fy 
(4.x) 
« 
F(4.x,y) 
) 
« 
dx.y 
> 
500 
(ix) 
B(4.x) 
« 
Fa(4.x) 
« 
F(4.x,a) 
« 
dx.a 
> 
500 
and, 
provisionally, 
(4.x) 
P(4.x) 
« 
dx, 
b(4.x) 
> 
500 
(where 
b 
is 
the 
function 
from 
a 
town 
to 
its 
capital). 


Under 
a 
k 
stating 
the 
position, 
the 
nationality 
and 
the 
rank 
of 
any 
town 
in 
object, 
all 
the 
above 
attributes 
are 
perfectly 
meaningful 
and 
the 
respective 
proposition 
are 
perfectly 
valuable. 
For 
instance 
Toledo 
is 
far 
from 
Lyon, 
barbarous 
and 
non-peripheral, 
Cadiz 
is 
non-far 
from 
Sevilla, 
barbarous 
and 
peripheral, 
Piraeus 
is 
far 
from 
Paris, 
non-barbarous 
and 
non-peripheral. 
In 
the 
above 
definitions 
replacing 


F 
(4.x,y) 


or 


Fy 
(4.x) 


with 
(4.xi) 
F(4.x) 


would 
be 
a 
trivial 
error, 
for 
in 
(4.xi) 
the 
second 
free 
variable 
is 
missing: 
by 
definition 
“far” 
cannot 


be 
a 
closed 
predicate 
pertaining 
to 
single 
towns. 
In 
fact 
(vii) 
defines 
a 
closed 
predicate 
pertaining 
to 
couples 
of 
towns, 
just 
as 
(viii) 
defines 
an 
open 
predicate 
pertaining 
to 
single 
towns. 
Analogously 
(ix) 
defines 
a 
closed 
predicate 
pertaining 
to 
single 
towns 
and 
(4.x) 
defines 
an 
indexical 
predicate 
pertaining 
to 
single 
towns. 
The 
evident 
discrepancy 
opposing 
(viii) 
to 
(ix) 
and 
to 
(4.x) 
is 
that 
only 
in 


(viii) 
the 
fixation 
of 
x 
is 
insufficient 
to 
close 
the 
formula. 
Yet 
(here 
is 
a 
fundamental 
passage)a 
subtle 
yet 
crucial 
discrepancy 
opposes 
(ix) 
to 
(4.x), 
precisely 
because 
the 
former 
is 
absolute 
and 
the 
latter 
is 
indexical: 
while 
a 
town 
is 
or 
is 
not 
barbarous 
in 
function 
of 
its 
distance 
from 
a 
constant 
point 
(Athens), 
a 
town 
is 
or 
is 
not 
peripheral 
in 
function 
of 
its 
distance 
from 
a 
point 
which 
depends 
on 
the 
same 
town 
whose 
peripheralness 
is 
under 
scrutiny 
(the 
non-peripheralness 
of 
Toledo 
and 
the 
peripheralness 
of 
Cadiz 
depend 
on 
their 
distance 
from 
Madrid, 
the 
non-peripheralness 
of 
Reims 
depends 
on 
its 
distance 
from 
Paris, 
the 
peripheralness 
of 
Trieste 
depends 
on 
its 
distance 
from 
Rome 
et 
cetera). 
In 
other 
words, 
while 
*peripheral* 
is 
equivalent 
to 
*far 
from 
Madrid* 
if 
we 
are 
speaking 
of 
a 
Spanish 
town, 
it 
is 
equivalent 
to 
*far 
from 
Paris* 
if 
we 
are 
speaking 
of 
a 
French 
town, 
it 
is 
equivalent 
to 
*far 
from 
Rome* 
if 
we 
are 
speaking 
of 
an 
Italian 
town 
et 
cetera. 
In 
order 
to 
emphasize 
the 
essential 
role 
of 
b 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
realize 
that 
the 
annexation 
of 
Trieste 
to 
Slovenia 
would 
transform 
its 
previous 
peripheralness 
into 
a 
non-peripheralness 
without 
involving 
its 
barbarousness 
et 
cetera. 
The 
purpose 
of 
overcoming 
this 
indexicality 
by 
finding 
out 
a 
magic 
town 
Utopolis 
(b) 
such 
that 


(4.xii) 
P(4.x) 
« 
Fb(4.x) 
(i.e.: 
such 
that 
*peripheral* 
= 
*far 
from 
Utopolis*) 
would 
be 
a 
manifest 
absurdity, 
exactly 
like 
the 
purpose 
of 
finding 
out 
on 
the 
geoid 
a 
magic 
point 
whose 
co-ordinates 
are 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
coordinates 
of 
Madrid, 
of 
Paris, 
of 
Rome 
et 
cetera). 
Absolute 
and 
indexical 
predicates 
are 



congenitally 
incompatible 
because 
the 
formers 
(the 
latters) 
adduce 
an 
invariant 
(a 
variant) 
piece 
of 
information. 
The 
highly 
deceiving 
factor 
in 
(4.x) 
is 
the 
omission 
of 
a 
free 
variable 
in 
the 
definiendum 
(here 
is 
the 
reason 
why 
I 
wrote 
“provisionally”). 
While 
such 
an 
omission 
is 
manifest 
in 
(4.xi) 
because 
without 


the 
second 
fixation 
we 
face 
a 
variant 
proposition, 
in 
(4.x), 
once 
x 
is 
fixed, 
the 
possibility 
of 


computing 
through 
b 
its 
correlatum 
b(4.x) 
saturates 
the 
blank. 
In 
other 
words: 
(4.x) 
seems 
a 


correct 
definition 
because 
actually 
P 
pertains 
to 
single 
towns 
and 
whenever 
it 
is 
ascribed 
to 
a 


specific 
town, 
the 
blank 
affecting 
*peripheral* 
is 
automatically 
saturated 
through 
b. 
This 
notwithstanding 
such 
evidence 
does 
not 
at 
all 
mean 
that 
the 
second 
term 
is 
superfluous. 
Since 
all 
the 
above 
defined 
attributes 
depend 
on 
distances 
and 
*distance* 
is 
an 
intrinsically 
dyadic 
notion, 
they 
all 
depend 
on 
couples; 
*barbarous* 
concerns 
a 
single 
town 
and 
it 
is 
absolute 
because 
the 
second 
town 
is 
established 
once 
for 
all, 
*peripheral* 
concerns 
a 
single 
town 
but 
it 
is 
indexical 
because 
the 
second 
town 
varies 
in 
dependence 
of 
the 
first. 
Therefore, 
correcting 
(4.x) 
is 
strictly 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
achieve 
a 
right 
definition 
of 
*peripheral*. 
Such 
a 
correction 
can 
be 
carried 
out 
through 
two 
different 
ways, 
the 
pertinential 
and 
the 
variational 
ones: 


• 
under 
the 
pertinential 
way 
we 
impose 
that 
*peripheral* 
is 
an 
absolute 
attribute, 
and 
then 
we 
must 
accept 
that 
it 
pertains 
to 
couples 
of 
towns 
• 
under 
the 
variational 
way 
we 
impose 
that 
*peripheral* 
pertains 
to 
single 
towns, 
and 
then 
we 
must 
accept 
its 
indexicality. 
What 
we 
cannot 
impose 
is 
that 
*peripheral* 
is 
an 
absolute 
attribute 
pertainig 
to 
single 
towns, 
because 
these 
two 
assumptions 
are 
logically 
incompatible. 
Symbolically, 
-under 
the 
pertinential 
approach 
we 
must 
appeal 
to 
a 
notation 
like 


(4.xiii) 
P(4.x, 
b(4.x)) 
« 
dx, 
b(4.x) 
> 
500 
where 
“P”, 
representing 
an 
absolute 
attribute, 
does 
not 
need 
any 
index, 


-under 
the 
variational 
approach 
we 
must 
appeal 
to 
a 
notation 
like 
(4.xiv) 
Pb(4.x)(4.x) 
« 
dx, 
b(4.x) 
> 
500 


where 
“P” 
is 
replaced 
with 
“P 
b(4.x) 
” 
just 
in 
order 
to 
witness 
formally 
the 
indexicality 
of 
the 
defined 
attribute. 
Of 
course 
both 
(4.xiii) 
and 
(4.xiv) 
respect 
the 
formal 
necessity 
to 
present 
in 
the 
definiendum 
the 
“b(4.x)” 
occurring 
in 
their 
common 
definiens. 
And 
actually, 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
put 


(4.xv) 
y= 
b(4.x) 
we 
can 
immediately 
derive 
(4.xiii) 
from 
(vii) 
and 
(4.xiv) 
from 
(viii) 
by 
the 
substitution 
of 
identity 
(4.xv). 
The 
general 
conclusion 
(meta-conclusion?) 
is 
that 
every 
attempt 
at 
operating 
formally 
on 
symbols 
ought 
to 
be 
preceded 
by 
an 
extremely 
careful 
critical 
analysis 
intended 
to 
reduce 
the 
risk 
of 
misleading 
notations. 
And 
the 
acritical 
omission 
of 
a 
free 
variable 
is 
probably 
the 
worst 
one. 
However 
the 
whole 
matter 
will 
be 
better 
probed 
in 
Chapter 
17, 
thanks 
to 
the 
introduciton 
of 
the 
reflexive 
variable. 


6.1. 
If 
we, 
in 
analogy 
with 
the 
relation 
between 
“noun” 
and 
“pronoun”, 
agree 
to 
call 
“pro-adjectives” 
the 
indexical 
ones, 
“peripheral” 
(under 
the 
privileged 
variational 
approach) 
is 
a 
pro-adjective: 

exactly 
as 
“she” 
stands 
for 
“Ava”, 
“Eve”, 
“Jane” 
and 
so 
on 
according 
to 
the 
woman 
we 
are 
speaking 
of, 
“peripheral” 
stands 
for 
“far 
from 
Madrid”, 
“far 
from 
Paris”, 
“far 
from 
Rome” 
and 
so 
on 
according 
to 
the 
town 
we 
are 
speaking 
of. 


6.2. 
The 
immediate 
recognition 
of 
indexical 
attributes 
may 
be 
difficult. 
For 
instance, 
while 
*infanticide* 
is 
absolute, 
*uxoricide* 
is 
indexical. 
In 
fact 
while 
in 
order 
to 
become 
an 
infanticide 
any 
infant 
is 
an 
adequate 
victim 
(the 
variable 
is 
quantified), 
in 
order 
to 
become 
an 
uxoricide 
the 
killer 
must 
join 
profit 
and 
pleasure, 
that 
is 
he 
must 
apply 
to 
his 
own 
wife. 


7. 
The 
reason 
why 
(Chapter 
5, 
§9) 
I 
cannot 
accept 
the 
argument 
based 
on 
indexicality 
as 
evidence 
supporting 
the 
semantic 
pertinence 
of 
alethic 
attributes 
is 
then 
clear. 
Briefly. 
Since 
an 
indexical 
expression 
can 
be 
conceived 
as 
a 
variable 
standing 
for 
different 
absolute 
expressions 
in 
conformity 
with 
different 
specific 
contexts, 
different 
alethic 
values 
are 
not 
incompatible 
with 
a 
syntactical 
pertinence. 
8. 
The 
predicates 
which 
the 
logical 
paradoxes 
are 
built 
on 
(“Richardian”, 
“non-self-applicable” 
et 
cetera) 
are 
indexical; 
realizing 
their 
indexicality 
is 
the 
first 
and 
crucial 
step 
to 
achieve 
the 
general 
solution. 
Yet 
since 
till 
now 
their 
indexicalilty, 
as 
far 
as 
I 
know, 
has 
not 
been 
recognized, 
speaking 
of 
a 
crypto-indexicality 
seems 
legitimate 
to 
me. 
8.1. 
Extensionally, 
a 
set 
is 
indexical 
iff 
it 
is 
the 
extension 
of 
an 
indexical 
attribute; 
so, 
for 
instance, 
Russell’s 
set 
is 
indexical. 
Generally 
reasoning, 
statements 
about 
indexical 
attributes 
are 
immediately 
translatable 
into 
statements 
about 
indexical 
sets 
once 
the 
intensional 
approach 
is 
replaced 
by 
the 
extensional 
one. 



APPENDIX 
TO 
CHAPTER 
16 


INTENTIONAL 
IDENTITY 


1. 
Here 
I 
wish 
to 
tackle 
(and 
to 
solve) 
some 
well 
known 
puzzles 
(grandiloquently: 
paradoxes): 
all 
of 
them 
are 
born 
by 
the 
violation 
of 
the 
competence 
condition, 
according 
to 
which 
(Chapter 
8, 
§8) 
an 
inference 
is 
valid 
in 
a 
statute 
iff 
every 
piece 
of 
information 
employed 
in 
such 
an 
inference 
belongs 
to 
such 
a 
statute. 
And 
since 
statutes 
concerning 
distinct 
persons 
or 
the 
same 
person 
in 
distinct 
moments 
may 
differ, 
we 
can 
accordingly 
distinguish 
two 
kinds 
of 
violations: 
the 
individual 
and 
the 
chronological 
ones. 


2. 
The 
puzzles 
of 
intentional 
identity 
do 
not 
involve 
the 
chronological 
dimension, 
and 
consequently 
the 
chronological 
index 
can 
be 
omitted 
in 
the 
respective 
symbolization 
(so 
we 
can 
speak 
elliptically 
of 
a 
kg, 
instead 
of 
a 
kg,t). 
I 
tackle 
them 
making 
reference 
to 
Edelberg 
1986; 
by 
“Ed(1)”, 
“Ed(2)” 
et 
cetera 
I 
recall 
respectively 
the 
formulae 
(1), 
(2) 
et 
cetera 
of 
the 
mentioned 
paper. 
In 
order 
to 
facilitate 
the 
collations 
between 
his 
formulae 
and 
mine, 
I 
accept 
his 
notations 
even 
where 
(for 
instance 
his 
use 


of 
“E” 
for 
“E!”) 
more 
meticulous 
conventions 
might 
be 
preferable. 
So, 
for 
instance 
Bg,[Ex(Px)] 


means 
that 
g 
(at 
any 
moment 
t 
interested 
by 
the 
reasoning 
under 
scrutiny) 
believes 
there 
is 
an 
x 


being 
P, 
or, 
in 
other 
words, 
that 


Ex(Px) 
is 
a 
datum 
(a 
piece 
of 
information) 
belonging 
to 
kg,. 


2.1. 
I 
epitomize 
the 
first 
puzzle 
as 
follows. 
While 
(Detective) 
A 
believes 
Smith 
and 
Jones 
have 
been 
murdered 
by 
two 
different 
persons, 
(Detective) 
B 
believes 
they 
have 
been 
murdered 
by 
the 
same 
person. 
Since 
(p.13) 
A 
and 
B 
discussed 
the 
case 
at 
length, 
and 
since 
both 
of 
them 
ignore 
the 
specific 
person 
who 
murdered 
Smith, 
we 
can 
assume 


murdering 
Smith 
as 
a 
common 
identifying 
connotation. 
In 
Edelberg’s 
opinion 
(Ed(19) 
and 
Ed(20), 
p.13) 
the 
puzzle 
is 
that, 
though 


(i) 
A 
believes 
someone 
murdered 
Smith 
and 
B 
believes 
he 
murdered 
Jones 
and 
(ii) 
B 
believes 
someone 
murdered 
Jones 
and 
A 
believes 
he 
murdered 
Smith 
are 
symmetric 
(i,e,: 
though 
(ii) 
is 
the 
commutation 
of 
(i) 
and 
commutability 
is 
an 
universally 
accepted 
property 
of 
conjunction), 
(i) 
is 
true 
and 
(ii) 
is 
false. 
Such 
a 
commutation 
is 
even 
more 
evident 
if, 
once 
any 
existential 
import 
is 
dropped 
from 
quantifiers, 
we 
formalize 
(i) 
in 


(iii) 
Ex[Ba(Sx)& 
Bb(Jx)] 
(Ed(21), 
p.14) 
and 
(ii) 
in 

(iv) 
Ex[Bb(Jx)& 
Ba(Sx)] 
(Ed(22), 
ibidem). 
The 
use 
of 
the 
same 
variable 
both 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
Ba 
and 
of 
Bb 
is 
justified 


by 
the 
mentioned 
common 
identifying 
connotation; 
x 
is 
simply 
the 
otherwise 
unknown 
person 
who, 
both 
in 
A’s 
and 
B’s 
opinion, 
murdered 
Smith. 


3. 
My 
claim 
is 
that 
the 
puzzle 
is 
only 
a 
superficial 
fallacy 
caused 
by 
a 
mistaken 
choice 
of 
the 
antecedent 
converting 
the 
indexical 
variable 
“he”. 
For 
the 
moment, 
let 
me 
reason 
in 
the 
ordinary 
language. 
4. 
Claiming 
that 
(i) 
and 
(ii) 
are 
respectively 
true 
and 
false 
presupposes 
that 
in 
both 
of 
them 
the 
anaphoric 
function 
succeeds 
in 
individuating 
a 
well 
specified 
referent 
for 
“he”. 
So, 
with 
reference 
to 
(i), 
(v) 
who 
is 
he? 
or 
in 
other 
words 
(vi) 
who 
is 
the 
person 
B 
believes 
murdered 
Jones? 
is 
our 
basic 
question. 
Once 
left 
out 
of 
consideration 
that 
B 
suspects 
A, 
the 
possible 
answers 
to 
(v) 
are 
three, 
and 
precisely 
(vii) 
he 
who 
actually 
murdered 
Smith 
(viii) 
he 
whom 
A 
believes 
murdered 
Smith 
(ix) 
he 
whom 
B 
believes 
murdered 
Smith. 
In 
order 
to 
prove 
that 
(viii) 
is 
the 
only 
correct 
answer, 
let 
me 
consider 
an 
interim 
similar 
context 
where 
-Smith 
has 
been 
actually 
murdered 
by 
his 
secretary 
Charlie 
-A 
believes 
that 
Smith 
has 
been 
murdered 
by 
his 
barber 
Donald 
-B 
believes 
that 
Smith 
has 
been 
murdered 
by 
his 
pedicure 
Edward. 
Under 
this 
context 


(4.x) 
A 
believes 
Donald 
murdered 
Smith 
and 
B 
believes 
he 
murdered 
Jones 
is 
unquestionably 
false. 
In 
fact 
(4.x) 
tells 
us 
that 
B 
believes 
Donald 
murdered 
Jones; 
and 
by 
hypothesis 
Donald, 
far 
from 
being 
(vii) 
or 
(ix), 
is 
(viii). 
This 
conclusion 
can 
anyway 
be 
validated 
by 
supposing 
that 
A, 
instead 
of 
suspecting 
Donald, 
suspects 
Smith’s 
partner 
Fred; 
under 
this 
new 
context 
A 
believes 
Fred 
murdered 
Smith 
and 
B 
believes 
he 
murdered 
Jones 
is 
true 
if 
and 
only 
if 
B 
believes 
that 
Jones 
has 
been 
murdered 
by 
Fred. 


Therefore, 
since 
the 
person 
B 
believes 
murdered 
Jones 
must 
be 
the 
person 
A 
believes 
murdered 
Smith, 
the 
anaphoric 
function 
states 
unequivocally 
that 
the 
antecedent 
of 
“he” 
is 
“he 
whom 
A 
believes 



murdered 
Smith”. 
And 
the 
same 
conclusion 
holds 
perfectly 
with 
reference 
to 
(i), 
because 
the 
difference 
between 
(i) 
and 
(4.x), 
is 
simply 
that 
in 
the 
former 
case 
A 
is 
not 
in 
condition 
to 
give 
a 
precise 
identity 
to 
his 
suspect; 
a 
difference 
concerning 
A’s 
opinion 
which 
obviously 
cannot 
modify 
the 
anaphoric 
function. 


4.1. 
Exactly 
as 
(viii) 
is 
the 
antecedent 
of 
the 
“he” 
occurring 
in 
(i), 
(4.xi) 
he 
whom 
B 
believes 
murdered 
Jones 
is 
the 
antecedent 
of 
the 
“he” 
occurring 
in 
(ii). 
Realizing 
that, 
exactly 
as 
(i*) 
A 
believes 
someone 
murdered 
Smith 
and 
B 
believes 
he 
whom 
A 
believes 
murdered 
Smith 
murdered 
Jones 
is 
the 
only 
strict 
periphrasis 
of 
(i), 


(ii*) 
B 
believes 
someone 
murdered 
Jones 
and 
A 
believes 
he 
whom 
B 
believes 
murdered 
Jones 
murdered 
Smith 
is 
the 
only 
strict 
periphrasis 
of 
(ii), 
is 
overcoming 
the 
puzzle. 
In 
fact 
the 
condition 
assuring 
the 
truth 
of 
(i*), 
that 
is 
the 
identity 
between 
the 
person 
A 
believes 
murdered 
Smith 
and 
the 
person 
B 
believes 
murdered 
Jones, 
is 
perfectly 
reflected 
in 
the 
condition 
assuring 
the 
truth 
of 
(ii*), 
that 
is 
the 
identity 
between 
the 
person 
B 
believes 
murdered 
Jones 
and 
the 
person 
A 
believes 
murdered 
Smith 
(by 
hypothesis 
both 
of 
them 
identify 
themselves 
with 
the 
person 
B 
believes 
murdered 
Smith). 


4.2. 
Formally 
and 
generally 
speaking, 
wherever 
a 
(4.xii) 
Px 
occurs 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
a 
B 
as 
for 
instance 
in 
(4.xiii) 
Ba(Px) 
the 
x 
we 
are 
speaking 
of 
is 
not 


(4.xiv) 
ix(Px) 
(the 
individual 
being 
P) 
but 


(4.xv) 
ix[Ba(Px)] 
(the 
individual 
A 
believes 
being 
P) 
because 
the 
speaker, 
far 
from 
stating 
that 
x 
is 
P, 
states 
that 
A 


believes 
that 
x 
is 
P. 
The 
speaker 
might 
even 
dissent 
from 
(4.xii) 
and 
nevertheless 
he 
could 
legitimately 
state 
(4.xiii). 
This 
trivial 
conclusion 
can 
be 
also 
supported 
by 
comparing 


(4.xvi) 
Px 
& 
Bb(Qx) 
with 

(4.xvii) 
Ba(Px)& 
Bb(Qx) 
and 
by 
remarking 
that, 
exactly 
as 
(4.xiv) 
is 
the 
antecedent 
of 
the 
second 
individual 
variable 
occurring 
in 
(4.xvi), 
(4.xv) 
is 
the 
antecedent 
of 
the 
second 
individual 
variable 
occurring 
in 
(4.xvii). 
Therefore 
the 
strict 
periphrases 
of 
(4.xvii) 
are 
Ba(Px)& 
Bb(Q(ix[Ba(Px)]) 
and 


(4.xviii) 
Bb(Qx)& 
Ba(P(ix[Bb(Qx)]) 
respectively. 
The 
root 
of 
Edelberg’s 
untenable 
claim 
is 
mistaking 
(4.xix) 
Bb(Qx)& 
Ba(P(ix[Ba(Qx)]) 
for 
(4.xviii), 
that 
is 
mistaking 
A’s 
and 
B’s 
(incompatible) 
statutes 
apropos 
of 
*he 
who 
murdered 
Jones*. 


4.3. 
The 
intriguing 
collateral 
question 
why 
does 
the 
truth 
of 
(ii) 
need 
a 
subtle 
analysis 
while 
the 
truth 
of 
(i) 
is 
evident? 
can 
be 
immediately 
answered; 
while 
mistaking 
(viii) 
for 
(ix) 
is 
inconsequential 
on 
the 
truth 
of 
(i) 
because 
A’s 
and 
B’s 
statutes 
agree 
apropos 
of 
Smith’s 
murderer, 
mistaking 
(4.xx) 
he 
whom 
A 
believes 
murdered 
Jones 
for 
(4.xi), 
that 
is, 
symbolically, 
mistaking 
(4.xviii) 
for 
(4.xix), 
upsets 
the 
truth 
value 
of 
(ii) 
because 
A’s 
and 
B’s 
statutes 
disagree 
apropos 
of 
Jones’s 
murderer. 
And 
mistaking 
(4.xx) 
for 
(4.xi) 
is 
suggested 
by 
a 
hasty 
reading 
of 
(ii) 
where 
“… 
someone 
murdered 
Jones 
… 
A 
believes 
he 
murdered 
Smith” 
actually 
occurs. 
5. 
Geach’s 
original 
puzzle 
concerns 
the 
(seeming) 
impossibility 
of 
theorizing 
a 
de 
re 
or 
a 
de 
dicto 
use 
of 
pronouns 
in 
intentional 
identity 
contexts. 
Since 
from 
the 
informational 
viewpoint 
such 
a 
distinction 
is 
of 
no 
moment 
because 
the 
ontological 
dimension 
is 
not 
necessary 
for 
the 
accomplishment 
of 
a 
semantic 
course 
(cannot 
we 
properly 
speak 
of 
Polyphemus?), 
I 
propose 
an 
over-schematized 
but 
more 
direct 
version 
of 
the 
same 
puzzle, 
where 
the 
problem 
concerning 
the 
real 
existence 
of 
witches 
can 
be 
completely 
neglected 
(we 
speak 
of 
witches 
exactly 
as 
we 
could 
speak 
of 
Cyclopes). 
Example 
1. 
Hob 
and 
Nob 
agree 
that 
the 
witch 
Hob 
thinks 
blighted 
Bob’s 
mare 
is 
the 
witch 
Nob 
thinks 
killed 
Cob’s 
sow. 


Example 
2. 
Nob 
is 
unaware 
of 
Hob’s 
existence. 
Yet 
both 
of 
them 
know 
that 
Peter 
thinks 
a 
pestiferous 
witch 
roamed 
over 
the 
hills. 
Hob 
and 
Nob 
think 
(independently, 
of 
course) 
their 
witch 
is 
Peter’s 
one. 
The 
puzzle 
runs 
as 
follows. 
Undoubtedly 


(4.xxi) 
Hob 
thinks 
a 
witch 
blighted 
Bob’s 
mare 
and 
Nob 
thinks 
she 
killed 
Cob’s 
sow 
is 
true 
with 
reference 
to 
both 
examples; 
therefore, 
since, 
on 
the 
grounds 
of 
the 
conclusion 
achieved 
in 
§4 
above, 
(4.xxii) 
the 
witch 
Hob 
thinks 
blighted 
Bob’s 
mare 

is 
the 
antecedent 
of 
the 
“she” 
occurring 
in 
(4.xxi), 


(4.xxiii) 
Hob 
thinks 
a 
witch 
blighted 
Bob’s 
mare 
and 
Nob 
thinks 
the 
witch 
Hob 
thinks 
blighted 
Bob’s 
mare 
killed 
Cob’s 
sow 
is 
obtained 
from 
(4.xxi) 
simply 
by 
replacing 
“she” 
with 
its 
antecedent 
(4.xxii). 
Yet 
while 
(4.xxiii) 
is 
true 
with 
reference 
to 
Example 
1, 
it 
cannot 
be 
true 
with 
reference 
to 
Example 
2, 
where 
Nob 
is 
unaware 
even 
of 
Hob’s 
existence. 
5.1. 
This 
reasoning, 
once 
more, 
violates 
the 
competence 
condition. 
While 
in 
Example 
1 
what 
the 
speaker 
knows, 
then 
in 
particular 
the 
identity 
(4.xxiv) 
the 
witch 
Hob 
thinks 
blighted 
Bob’s 
mare 
is 
the 
witch 
Nob 
thinks 
killed 
Cob’s 
sow 
is 
also 
known 
by 
Nob 
and 
as 
such 
can 
be 
used 
in 
any 
inference 
concerning 
Nob’s 
beliefs, 
in 
Example 
2, 
by 
hypothesis 
(p.2: 
Nob 
has 
no 
belief 
at 
all 
about 
Hob 
or 
about 
Bob’s 
mare) 
the 


speaker 
and 
Nob 
have 
different 
statutes; 
in 
particular 
(4.xxiv) 
is 
an 
identity 
known 
only 
by 
the 
speaker; 
therefore 
it 
cannot 
be 
used 
in 
any 
inference 
concerning 
Nob’s 
beliefs. 
With 
reference 
to 
Example 
2, 
the 
only 
legitimate 
antecedent 
for 
the 
“she” 
occurring 
in 
(4.xxi) 
is 
the 
witch 
Peter 
thinks 
roamed 
over 
the 
hills 
because 


(4.xxv) 
the 
witch 
Peter 
thinks 
roamed 
over 
the 
hills 
is 
the 
witch 
Nob 
thinks 
killed 
Cob’s 
sow 
is 
the 
only 
identity 
Nob 
knows. 
And 
actually 
(4.xxvi) 
Hob 
thinks 
a 
witch 
blighted 
Bob’s 
mare 
and 
Nob 
thinks 
the 
witch 
Peter 
thinks 
roamed 
over 
the 
hills 
killed 
Cob’s 
sow 
is 
an 
unobjectionable 
inference. 
In 
this 
sense 
the 
simple 
respect 
of 
the 
competence 
condition 
prevents 
us 
from 
deriving 
any 
puzzle. 
In 
other 
words. 
With 
reference 
to 
Example 
1, 
so 
to 
write, 
(4.xxi) 
is 
speaker-true 
and 
Nob-true, 
but 
with 
reference 
to 
Example 
2 
(4.xxi) 
is 
only 
speaker-true. 
5.2. 
The 
formal 
approach 
to 
Geach’s 
puzzle 
follows 
plainly 
from 
the 
considerations 
of 
§4.2. 
The 
competence 
condition 
is 
clear: 
only 
data 
(in 
particular, 
only 
identities) 
occurring 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
a 
“Bg, 
” 
can 
be 
used 
for 
any 
derivation 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
same 
“Bg”. 
So 
while 
[Bg*’(4.x=y) 
& 
Bg(Px]) 
É 
Bg(Py) 


is 
a 
misleading 
rule, 
and 
in 
particular 
(where 
g* 
is 
the 
speaker) 


[(4.x=y)) 
& 
Bg(Px)] 
É 
Bg(Py) 
is 
a 
peculiarly 
misleading 
rule, 
[Bg(4.x=y) 
& 
Bg(Px]) 
É 
Bg(Py) 
is 
the 
right 
one. 


5.3. 
In 
order 
to 
sketch 
formally 
few 
details 
of 
the 
reasoning 
proposed 
in 
§5 
I, 
a 
simplification 
is 
possible; 
in 
fact, 
once 
assumed 
that 
the 
individual 
variables 
range 
directly 
over 
witches, 
the 
omnipresent 
predicate 
“to 
be 
a 
witch” 
can 
be 
omitted. 
Under 
this 
assumption 
Bh[Ex(Bx) 
& 
Ey(Cy)&(y=x)]] 
& 
Bn[Ex(Bx) 
& 
Ey(Cy)&(y=x)] 


symbolizes 
Example 
1; 
then, 
by 
double 
substitution 
of 
identity, 


Bh[Ex(Bx 
& 
Cx)] 
& 
Bn[Ex(Bx 
& 
Cx)] 
(the 
double 
substitution 
is 
correct 
because 
“y=x” 
occurs 
both 
in 
the 
scope 
of 
“Bh 
” 
and 
of 
“Bn”, 
that 
is 
because 
both 
Hob 
and 
Nob 
are 
aware 
of 
the 
identity 
between 
their 
witches). 



Analogously 
the 
symbolization 
of 
Example 
2 
is 


Bp[Ez(Rz)] 
& 
Bh[Ex(Bx) 
& 
Ez(Rz)&(4.x=z))] 
& 
Bn[Ey(Cy) 
& 
Ez(Rz)&(y=z))] 
where 
“Bp 
” 
symbolizes 
“Peter 
thinks 
that” 
and 
“R” 
is 
the 
predicate 
for 
the 
pestiferous 
witch 
roaming 
over 
the 
hills. 
If 
we 
look 
at 
the 
question 
from 
the 
speaker’s 
viewpoint, 
where 


(4.xxvii) 
iz(Bp(Rz)) 
= 
ix(Bh(Bx)) 
(the 
speaker 
knows 
that 
the 
witch 
Peter 
thinks 
roamed 
over 
the 
hills 
is 
the 
witch 
Hob 
thinks 
blighted 
Bob’s 
mare), 
and 
where 


(4.xxviii) 
iz(Bp(Rz)) 
= 
iy(Bn(Cy)) 
(the 
speaker 
knows 
that 
the 
witch 
Peter 
thinks 
roamed 
over 
the 
hills 
is 
the 
witch 
Nob 
thinks 
killed 
Cob’s 
sow), 
we 
can 
immediately 
derive 
iy(Bn(Cy)) 
= 
ix(Bh(Bx)) 
(the 
witch 
Hob 
thinks 
blighted 
Bob’s 
mare 
is 
the 
witch 
Nob 
thinks 
killed 
Cob’s 
sow), 
therefore 
we 
can 
derive 
(4.xxiii); 
nevertheless 
no 
puzzle 
arises 
since 
we 
are 
reasoning 
under 
the 
speaker’s 


viewpoint, 
and 
from 
such 
a 
viewpoint 
(4.xxiii) 
is 
perfectly 
true 
because, 
though 
Nob 
unaware, 
his 
witch 
is 
Hob’s 
witch. 
If 
on 
the 
contrary 
we 
look 
at 
the 
matter 
from 
Nob’s 
viewpoint, 
we 
can 
put 
(4.xxviii) 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
“Bn 
” 
(Nob 
knows 
that 
his 
witch 
is 
the 
witch 
Peter 
thinks 
roamed 
over 
the 
hills) 
but 
we 


cannot 
put 
(4.xxvii) 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
“Bn 
” 
(Nob 
does 
not 
know 
that 
the 
witch 
Peter 
thinks 
roamed 
over 
the 
hills 
is 
the 
witch 
Hob 
thinks 
blighted 
Bob’s 
mare), 
therefore 
the 
derivation 
of 


ix(Bh 
(Bx))] 
= 
Bn[iy(Bn(Cy)) 


violates 
the 
competence 
comdition. 
Briefly; 
since 
the 
identity 
(4.xxvii) 
cannot 
occur 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
“Bn”, 
it 
cannot 
be 
used 
for 
a 
substitution 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
such 
an 
operator. 


In 
conclusion. 
From 
the 
speaker 
viewpoint 
(4.xxiii) 
can 
be 
correctly 
derived, 
yet 
from 
such 
a 
viewpoint 
no 
puzzle 
arises 
because 
it 
is 
true. 
In 
order 
to 
make 
(4.xxiii) 
false, 
we 
must 
read 
it 
from 
Nob’ 
viewpoint, 
but 
then 
it 
is 
incorrectly 
derived. 
So, 
once 
we 
realize 
that 
such 
a 
falsity 
is 
not 
born 
by 
the 
illegitimate 
reading 
of 
the 
pronoun 
as 
a 
pronoun 
of 
laziness, 
but 
by 
the 
violation 
of 
the 
competence 
condition, 
Geach’s 
puzzle 
vanishes. 


6. 
The 
root 
of 
the 
impasse 
concerning 
Edelberg’s 
Example 
7 
(p.18), 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
more 
intricate 
context, 
is 
the 
same; 
therefore 
its 
solution 
can 
be 
achieved 
through 
the 
above 
analysis. 
Shortly 
his 
claim 
(p.17) 
according 
to 
which 
on 
its 
most 
natural 
reading 
Ed(26) 
is 
true 
and 
on 
its 


most 
natural 
reading 
Ed(27) 
is 
false 
is 
untenable. 
In 
fact 
the 
only 
reading 
under 
which 
Ed(26) 
A 
thinks 
someone 
murdered 
the 
mayor 
and 
B 
thinks 
he 
murdered 
the 
commissioner 
is 
true 
can 
be 
the 
speaker’s 
reading 
(A 
does 
not 
know 
anything 
about 
the 
commissioner 
and 
his 
death; 
B 
does 
not 
know 
anything 
about 
the 
mayor 
and 
his 
death). 
But 
under 
the 
speaker’s 
reading 
also 
Ed(27) 
B 
thinks 
someone 
murdered 
the 
commissioner 
and 
A 
thinks 
he 
murdered 
the 
mayor 
is 
true 
because 
all 
the 
four 
following 
identities 
the 
person 
B 
thinks 
murdered 
the 
commissioner 
is 
the 
person 
B 
thinks 
shot 
Jones 
the

B 
thinks 
shot 
Jones 
is 
the 
person 
B 
thinks

Smith 
the

B 
thinks

Smith 
is 
the

A

are 
known 
by 
the 
speaker 
(they 
all 
are 
explicit 
assumptions 
of 
Example 
7) 
and 
as 
such 
can 
legitimately 
be 
used 
for 
substitutions 
of 
identity 
concerning 
kspeaker. 


6.1. 
As 
for 
the 
intriguing 
question 
why 
does 
Ed(27) 
need 
a 
subtle 
analysis 
while 
Ed(26) 
does 
not? 
I 
simply 
remind 
the 
reader 
of 
§4.3 
above. 
7. 
Also 
the 
well 
known 
Surprise 
Text 
paradox 
(Binkley 
1968; 
J.H. 
Halpern, 
Y.Moses 
1986) 
is 
born 
by 
a 
violation 
of 
the 
competence 
condition, 
yet 
such 
a 
violation 
concerns 
the 
chronological 
dimension. 
I 
abridge 
the 
paradox 
as 
follows. 
A 
teacher 
announced 
to 
his 
private 
pupil 
Eve 
that 
on 
exactly 
one 
of 
the 
next 
two 
lesson 
days 
he 
would 
give 
her 
a 
test; 
but 
it 
would 
be 
a 
surprise 
test 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
on 
the 
evening 
before 
the 
test 
she 
would 
not 
know 
that 
the 
test 
would 
take 
place 
the 
next 
day. 
Eve 
charges 
the 
teacher 
with 
incoherence; 
in 
fact, 
she 
argues 
-the 
test 
cannot 
take 
place 
the 
second 
day 
since 
in 
this 
case 
on 
the 
evening 
of 
the 
first 
day 
she 
would 
expect 
it 
-the 
test 
cannot 
take 
place 
in 
the 
first 
day 
since, 
having 
already 
eliminated 
the 
second 
day, 
she 
would 
expect 
it. 
7.1. 
In 
order 
to 
formalize 
the 
situation 
I 
assume 
“di 
” 
for 
“the 
test 
takes 
place 
day 
i” 
and 
d1¯ 
d2 


for 
~(~d1&~d2)& 
~(d1&d2) 
(I 
recall 
Chapter 
7, 
§10.1) 
that 
“¯” 
is 
the 
symbol 
for 
the 
partitive 
disjunction 
XOR, 
conjunction 
of 


the 
inclusive 
and 
the 
exclusive 
disjunctions). 
Let 
k° 
be 
Eve’s 
initial 
knowledge 
concerning 
the 
possible 
dates 
of 
the 
test; 
since 


k° 
=(d1¯ 
d2) 
if 
we 
suppose 
that 
the 
test 
did 
not 
take 
place 
on 
the 
first 
day, 


k1 
= 
k°&~d1 
is 
her 
knowledge 
at 
the 
evening 
of 
the 
day 
1; 
then 
manifestly 
the 
acquirement 
~d1 


makes 
k° 
and 
k1 
two 
different 
statutes. 
The 
condition 
of 
surprise 


S(dj) 


is 
by 
definition 


(4.xxix) 
~(k 
j-1 
É 
dj) 
(where 
of 
course 
k 
j-1 
is 
Eve’s 
statute 
at 
the 
evening 
before 
the 
j-day). 


7.2. 
The 
paradoxical 
flavour 
of 
the 
situation 
depends 
on 
the 
incompatibility 
between 
the 
conclusion 
drawn 
by 
Eve 
(no 
surprise 
is 
possible) 
and 
the 
actual 
component 
of 
surprise 
entailed 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
information 
(d1? 
d2?) 
affecting 
the 
announcement. 
But 
such 
an 
incompatibility 
is 
born 
by 
the 
ambiguity 
of 
(4.xxix); 
that 
is 
by 
the 
ambiguity 
concerning 
the 
range 
of 
the 
variable 
“j”. 



Does 
the 
teacher 
claim 
that 
the 
condition 
of 
surprise 
is 
only 
valid 
at 
the 
moment 
he 
utters 
it 
(j=1) 
or 
does 
he 
claim 
that 
it 
must 
be 
valid 
for 
the 
whole 
period 
(j=1 
and 
j=2))? 


In 
the 
former 
case 
his 
announcement 
is 
true 
because 
~((d1¯ 
d2) 
É 
d1) 
that 
is 
~(k° 
É 
d1) 
satisfies 
(4.xxix); 
therefore 
Eve’s 
argument 
is 
illegitimate 
because 
the 
presumed 
incoherence 
of 


the 
announcement 
depends 
on 
(4.xxx) 
S(d2) 
which 
is 
not 
claimed 
by 
the 
teacher. 


In 
the 
latter 
case 
Eve 
is 
right; 
in 
fact 
the 
announcement 
is 
incoherent 
because 
(4.xxx) 
is 
actually 
claimed, 
and 
(d1¯ 
d2&~d1 
) 
É 
d2 
that 
is 


k1É 
d2 


contradicts 
(4.xxix). 


7.3. 
The 
extrapolation 
of 
the 
above 
analysis 
to 
n>2 
days 
is 
only 
a 
matter 
of 
notational 
patience; 
the 
easy 
conclusion 
is 
that 
a 
precise 
agreement 
about 
S(dn) 


can 
avoid 
any 
impasse. 
Furthermore 
the 
reason 
is 
explained 
why 
as 
days 
go 
by 
and 
the 
last 
possible 
date 
approaches, 
the 
surprise 
effect 
decreases 
(the 
number 
of 
partitioned 
alternatives 
is 
progressively 
reduced). 


8. 
Another 
violation 
of 
the 
competence 
condition 
involving 
the 
chronological 
dimension 
is 
instanced 
by 
usual 
statements 
like 
(4.xxxi) 
I 
believed 
that 
Jim 
was 
younger 
than 
he 
really 
was. 
Of 
course 
(4.xxxi) 
is 
incoherent 
if 
interpreted 
as 
at 
t° 
I 
believed 
that 
Jim’s 
age 
was 
less 
than 
itself 
while 
the 
same 
(4.xxxi) 
is 
perfectly 
reasonable 
if 
interpreted 
as 


at 
t’ 
I 
have 
acquired 
information 
sufficient 
to 
correct 
my 
previous 
belief 
about 
Jim’s 
age 
since 
the 
recognized 
existence 
of 
two 
chronologically 
different 
statutes 
legitimates 
the 
existence 
of 
incompatible 
beliefs. 



CHAPTER 
17 
REFLEXIVE 
VARIABLE 


1. 
Reflexivity 
is 
a 
manifest 
case 
of 
indexicality 
and 
represents 
an 
insidious 
theme 
that 
I 
intend 
to 
analyze 
in 
detail, 
owing 
to 
its 
primary 
importance 
for 
the 
history 
of 
logic. 
2. 
Let 
L 
be 
a 
symbolic 
language 
and 
ML 
its 
metalanguage. 
In 
L 
"a" 
and 
"b" 
are 
individual 
constants 
(for 
“Ava” 
and 
“Bob”), 
"x" 
and 
"y" 
are 
individual 
variables, 
"A" 
and 
"B" 
are 
verbs 


(for 
"to 
admire" 
and 
"to 
blandish"). 
In 
ML 
"Q""R", 
"T" 
and 
"F" 
are 
(syntactical) 
variables 
respectively 
for 
monadic 
predicates, 
dyadic 
predicates, 
terms 
and 
monadic 
functors. 
For 
instance, 
then, 
the 
L-translation 
of 


(i) 
she 
admires 
him 
is 
(ii) 
A(4.x,y) 
(she 
who? 
he 
who?). 
Analogously 


A(4.x,b) 
is 
the 
L-translation 
of 


(iii) 
she 
admires 
Bob 
(she 
who?) 
and 
(iv) 
A(a,y) 
is 
the 
L-translation 
of 


(v) 
Ava 
admires 
him 
(him 
who?). 
Here 
too 
(Chapter 
15, 
§14.1) 
the 
discourse 
is 
valid 
until 
the 
sentences 
are 
considered 
separately. 
In 
fact 
as 
soon 
as 
they 
are 
inserted 
in 
a 
wider 
context 
where 
the 
pronouns 
have 
an 
opportune 
antecedent, 
the 
situation 
changes. 
For 
instance 
the 
correct 
L-translation 
of 


(vi) 
if 
Ava 
blandishes 
Bob, 
then 
she 
admires 
him 
is 
B(a,b) 
® 
A(a,b) 


because 
what 
(vi) 
tells 
us 
is 
exactly 
that 
she 
is 
Ava 
and 
he 
(him?) 
is 
Bob. 
Therefore 


A(a,b) 
is 
now 
the 
correct 
L-translation 
of 
the 
same 
(i) 
whose 
previous 
correct 
L-translation 
was 
(ii). 
I 
insist 
in 
emphasizing 
that 
the 
aim 
of 
the 
syntactical 
approach 
is 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
current 
ones. 
The 
very 
core 
of 
the 
discourse 
continues 
being 
semantic. 
If 
I 
utter 
(i) 
when 
my 
interlocutor 
and 
I 
are 
looking 
at 
Ava 
and 
Bob 
chatting 
pleasantly 
on 
a 
desert 
shore, 
the 
conversion 
of 
the 
two 
variables 
is 
performed 
without 
any 
grammatical 
antecedent 
because 
the 
anaphoric 
function 
finds 
the 
integrative 
informational 
source 
in 
the 
two 
persons 
we 
are 
looking 
at. 


3. 
The 
theoretically 
crucial 
passage 
is 
that 
while 
natural 
languages 
do 
possess 
the 
possibility 
to 
formulate 
directly 
reflexive 
relations, 
current 
symbolic 
languages 
do 
not; 
and 
though 
at 
a 
first 

and 
superficial 
sight 
such 
an 
impossibility 
may 
seem 
non-reductive, 
it 
actually 
mutilates 
the 
expressive 
power 
of 
the 
languages 
in 
question 
because 
reflexive 
predicates 
singularly 
considered 
become 
unattainable. 
Even 
the 
well-developed 
natural 
languages 
do 
not 
represent 
a 
sophisticated 
linguistic 
model; 
wants, 
ambiguities 
and 
redundancies 
are 
too 
many. 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
the 
well-developed 
natural 
languages 
are 
a 
highly 
tested 
means 
of 
communication, 
and 
anyhow 
they 
represent 
the 
best 
model 
at 
our 
disposal. 
Of 
course 
among 
well-developed 
natural 
languages 
many 
expressive 
differences 
do 
exist; 
yet 
the 
common 
presence 
of 
some 
basic 
characteristics 
in 
all 
of 
them 
(from 
Port 
Royal 
to 
Leibniz 
and 
to 
the 
same 
Chomsky) 
suggests 
the 
presence 
of 
some 
universal 


requirements 
dictated 
by 
a 
universal 
modus 
cogitandi. 
As 
far 
as 
I 
know 
reflexive 
variables 
occur 
in 
every 
well-developed 
natural 
language; 
and 
as 
such 
we 
either 
arrogantly 
ignore 
the 
result 
of 
a 
linguistic 
experience 
ripened 
in 
thousands 
of 
centuries, 
or 
we 
have 
to 
acknowledge 
the 
opportunity 
of 
their 
presence 
in 
artificial 
symbolic 
languages 
too. 


4. 
While 
we 
can 
easily 
and 
unproblematically 
symbolize 
(vii) 
Ava 
admires 
herself 
by 
(viii) 
A(a,a) 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
try 
to 
symbolize 
separately 
the 
reflexive 
predicate 
(ix) 
to 
admire 
oneself 
we 
realize 
immediately 
that 
the 
lack 
of 
a 
reflexive 
variable 
actually 
mutilates 
the 
expressive 
power 
of 
the 
same 
symbolic 
language. 
In 
fact 
A(...,x) 


symbolizes 
to 
admire 
the 
person 
to 
specify 
and 


A(...,a) 


symbolizes 
to 
admire 
Ava 
(just 
because 
in 
(viii) 
“a” 
occurs 
both 
as 
the 
subject 
and 
as 
the 
complement, 
the 
same 
(viii) 
can 
symbolize 
(vii); 
but 
this 
procedure 
by 
iteration, 
obviously, 
fails 
where, 
as 
in 
(ix), 
we 
deal 
with 
a 
reflexive 
predicate 
alone). 


In 
order 
to 
overcome 
this 
heavy 
limit 
I 
introduce 
in 
L 
a 
reflexive 
individual 
variable 
“s” 
(or 


even, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
generality, 
a 
set 
of 
reflexive 
variables 
“s1”, 
“s2” 
et 
cetera) 
whose 
conversion 
rules 
will 
be 
discussed 
below. 
For 
the 
moment 
I 
legitimate 
its 
right 
to 
exist 
by 
remarking 
that 


A(...,s) 


symbolizes 
exactly 
(ix). 
Analogously, 
for 
instance, 


A(a, 
s1) 
& 
A(b, 
s2) 


says 
(roughly) 
that 
both 
Ava 
and 
Bob 
are 
narcissists 
(Ava 
admires 
herself 
and 
Bob 
admires 
himself). 


4.1. 
With 
reference 
to 
§6 
of 
Chapter 
16, 
db(s) 
> 
500 
is 
the 
correct 
symbolization 
of 
“peripheral”; 
but 
without 
“s”, 
which 
assures 
the 
right 
conversion 
of 
the 
indexical 
predicate 
into 
the 
contingent 
absolute 
ones 
(“far 
from 
Madrid” 
if 
the 
subject 
is 
“Cadiz”, 
“far 
from 
Rome” 
if 
the 
subject 
is 
“Trieste” 
et 
cetera), 
how 
could 
we 
carry 
out 
such 
a 



symbolization? 
To 
realize 
such 
an 
impossibility 
is 
to 
realize 
that 
the 
introduction 
of 
reflexive 
variables 
is 
a 
due 
(and 
very 
useful) 
enrichment 
of 
symbolic 
languages. 


5. 
Reflexive 
and 
non 
reflexive 
(or 
generic) 
variables 
constitute 
two 
sorts 
of 
individual 
variables, 
and 
the 
theoretically 
discriminating 
factor 
between 
them 
is 
that 
they 
obey 
different 
conversion 
rules. 
Here 
is 
an 
easy 
example. 
The 
only 
difference 
between 


(4.x) 
When 
Ava 
is 
ill, 
Eve 
takes 
care 
of 
her 
and 
(4.xi) 
When 
Ava 
is 
ill, 
Eve 
takes 
care 
of 
herself 
concerns 
the 
two 
pronouns: 
generic 
in 
(4.x), 
reflexive 
in 
(4.xi). 
The 
respective 
messages 
are 
manifestly 
different: 
while 
(4.x) 
suggests 
a 
charitable 
Eve, 
(4.xi) 
suggests 
a 
neurotically 
egoistic 
Eve. 
And 
this 
difference 
follows 
from 
the 
different 
antecedents 
of 
the 
two 
pronouns 
(variables): 
while 
“her” 
stands 
for 
“Ava”, 
“herself” 
stands 
for 
“Eve”. 
Then 
we 
must 
distinguish 
between 
the 
anaphoric 
function 
ruling 
generic 
indexical 
variables, 
and 
the 
anaphoric 
function 
ruling 
reflexive 
variables. 
Here 
too 
(Chapter 
16, 
§5.2) 
we 
can 
avoid 
the 
detailed 
theorization 
of 
the 
conversion 
rules 
for 
reflexive 
variables, 
since 
the 
sentences 
of 
our 
very 
interest 
are 
not 
affected 
by 
any 
problem 
of 
conversion. 
In 
fact 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
agree 
that 
where 
the 
reflexive 
variable 
occurs 
in 
the 
predicate 
of 
an 
atomic 
sentence, 
its 
antecedent 
is 
the 
respective 
subject. 
5.1. 
A 
subtle 
question 
runs 
as 
follows. 
In 
(4.x) 
no 
reflexive 
pronoun 
occurs, 
and 
the 
syntactically 
possible 
antecedents 
of 
“her” 
are 
“Ava” 
and 
“Eve” 
(which, 
furthermore, 
is 
the 
nearest 
one); 
why 
on 
earth, 
then, 
when 
we 
read 
(4.x) 
do 
we 
all 
understand 
unequivocally 
that 
the 
right 
antecedent 
is 
“Ava”? 
The 
answer 
is 
simple. 
Since 
we 
all 
know 
that 
English 
possesses 
reflexive 
pronouns, 
we 
also 
know 
that 
in 
order 
to 
assume 
Eve 
as 
referential 
antecedent 
we 
should 
use 
“herself”; 
then, 
since 
in 
(4.x) 
a 
non-reflexive 
pronoun 
is 
used, 
its 
referential 
antecedent 
is 
not 
Eve. 
In 
other 
words, 
Eve 
is 
a 
no 
longer 
available 
antecedent 
for 
the 
non-reflexive 
anaphoric 
function. 
5.2. 
Deep 
searches 
on 
the 
notion 
of 
reflexivity 
are 
not 
necessary 
to 
understand 
that, 
singularly 
considered, 
a 
generic 
variable 
(*the 
individual 
to 
specify*) 
adduces 
less 
information 
than 
a 
reflexive 
one 
(*the 
individual 
we 
are 
speaking 
of*). 
Here 
is 
the 
simple 
reason 
why 
(I 
follow 
Quine’s 
symbolism 
in 
Methods 
of 
Logic, 
§25) 


GyyÉ$x(Gxy) 


is 
a 
valid 
scheme, 
while 


GxyÉ$x(Gxx) 


is 
not. 
In 
other 
words: 
since 
*that 
same 
individual* 
implies 
*an 
individual* 
but 
not 
vice 
versa, 
the 
truth 
of 


(4.xii) 
Gyy 
is 
sufficient 
to 
assure 
the 
truth 
of 
(4.xiii) 
$x(Gxy) 
but 
the 
truth 
of 
(4.xiii) 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
infer 
the 
truth 
of 
(4.xii). 
In 
this 
sense 
here 
too 
there 
is 
no 
need 
to 
adopt 
integrative 
conditions 
(which, 

moreover, 
are 
not 
supported 
by 
theoretical 
arguments 
but 
only 
by 
counter-examples, 
as 
for 
instance 
in 
the 
quoted 
Quine’s 
work). 


6. 
While 
the 
examples 
above 
concern 
the 
direct 
reflexivity, 
(4.xiv) 
Ava 
admires 
her 
own 
mother 
concerns 
an 
indirect 
reflexivity. 
Nevertheless 
the 
difference 
is 
nearly 
negligible. 
In 
fact, 
since 
(4.xiv) 
can 
be 
symbolized 
in 
something 
like 
(4.xv) 
A(a, 
m(s)) 
both 
the 
direct 
and 
the 
indirect 
reflexivity 
enter 
into 
the 
general 
ML-scheme 


(4.xvi) 
R(T, 
F(“s”)) 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
direct 
reflexivity 
is 
conceived 
as 
the 
particular 
case 
where 
F 
is 
the 
null 
functor 
of 
identity. 
That 
is: 
the 
theoretically 
essential 
achievement 
is 
not 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
functor 
in 


(4.xvii) 
A(a, 
s)) 
but 
the 
necessary 
presence 
of 
the 
reflexive 
variable 
both 
in 
(4.xv) 
and 
(4.xvii). 
6.1. 
Reciprocity 
too 
is 
a 
case 
of 
indirect 
reflexivity. 
For 
instance 
(4.xviii) 
Ava 
and 
Bob 
greeted 
each 
other 
means 
that 
Ava 
greeted 
her 
greeter 
and 
Bob 
greeted 
his 
greeter, 
then 
(4.xviii) 
too 
enters 
into 
the 
scheme 
(4.xvi). 
The 
same 
conclusion 
is 
valid 
also 
with 
reference 
to 
an 
n-adic 
circularity. 


7. 
An 
easy 
application 
of 
the 
reflexive 
variable 
allows 
us 
an 
immediate 
solution 
of 
Kripke’s 
paradox. 
Its 
well 
known 
derivation 
runs 
as 
follows. 
Since 
"x"y 
((y=x 
& 
Px) 
É 
Py) 
and 
since 


"x(4.x=necx) 


(where 
“=nec”symbolizes 
the 
relation 
of 
necessary 
equality), 
then, 
particularizing 
P 
on 
the 
predicate 


(4.xix) 
“= 
necx”, 
we 
get 
"x"y 
((y=x 
&(4.x=nec 
x)) 
É 
(y=necx)) 


and 
finally 


"x"y 
((y=x) 
É 
(y=nec 
x)) 


a 
conclusion 
in 
manifest 
contrast 
with 
our 
common 
sense. 
The 
immediate 
solution 
points 
out 
that 
the 
actual 
predicate 
is 
not 
(4.xix) 
but 


(4.xx) 
=necs 
(actually 
every 
individual 
is 
necessarily 
equal 
to 
himself 
or 
herself 
or 
itself, 
not 
necessarily 
equal 
to 
x): 
and 
(4.xx) 
is 
an 
indexical 
predicate 
that 
by 
s-conversion 
becomes 
“= 
necy” 
when 
it 
is 
ascribed 
to 
y, 
just 
as 
it 
becomes 
“= 
necx” 
when 
it 
is 
ascribed 
to 
x. 



7.1. 
The 
ordinary 
solution 
of 
Kripke’s 
paradox 
points 
out 
that 
(4.xix) 
is 
not 
a 
correct 
particularization 
of 
P 
because 
it 
binds 
“x”. 
Yet 
such 
a 
solution 
is 
affected 
by 
a 
strong 
theoretical 
fault 
since 
(Chapter 
15, 
§15) 
just 
under 
the 
current 
orthodoxy, 
the 
incorrectness 
of 
such 
particularizations 
is 
not 
a 
theorem, 
but 
only 
an 
assumption 
grounded 
on 
counter-examples. 
8. 
I 
think 
that 
the 
very 
root 
of 
the 
misleading 
approach 
to 
logical 
paradoxes 
is 
the 
current 
classification 
of 
open 
sentences. 
In 
compliance 
with 
a 
famous 
Skolem’s 
suggestion 
(1922), 
the 
classifying 
criterion 
is 
the 
number 
of 
different 
free 
variables 
occurring 
in 
the 
open 
sentence 
under 
scrutiny 
(monadic, 
dyadic 
et 
cetera), 
without 
minding 
the 
number 
of 
occurrences 
for 
every 


free 
variable. 
Not 
to 
overcharge 
the 
analysis, 
I 
only 
consider 
sentences 
in 
model 
form, 
once 
agreed 
that 
a 
monadic 
sentence 
is 
in 
model 
form 
iff 
-its 
subject 
consists 
of 
the 
simple 
free 
variable 
-its 
predicate 
is 
either 
free-variable-free 
or 
free-variable-laden 
(of 
course 
in 
a 
monadic 
sentence 
whose 
subject 
is 
free-variable-laden, 
either 
the 
predicate 
is 
free-variable-free 
or 
its 
variable 
must 
be 
the 
same 
of 
the 
subject, 
therefore 
in 
this 
case 
the 
sentence 
is 
reflexive). 


Considering 
only 
sentences 
in 
model 
form 
is 
not 
so 
reductive 
a 
simplification 
as 
it 
may 
seem. 
For 
instance, 


(4.xxi) 
Ava’s 
mother 
was 
run 
over 
by 
the 
eldest 
sister 
of 
his 
wife 
is 
a 
monadic 
sentence 
(the 
wife 
of 
whom?) 
whose 
form 
is 
far 
from 
the 
model 
one; 
yet 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
transform 
(4.xxi) 
into 
(4.xxii) 
he 
is 
the 
husband 
of 
a 
lady 
whose 
eldest 
sister 
ran 
over 
Ava’s 
mother 
and 
to 
ascertain 
that 
(4.xxii) 
is 
in 
model 
form. 
Anyhow, 
even 
if 
the 
simplification 
were 
highly 
reductive, 
it 
does 
not 
forbid 
me 
to 
tackle 
the 
logical 
paradoxes 
and 
to 
give 
them 
a 
general 
solution. 


8.1. 
I 
provisionally 
epitomize 
these 
conditions 
in 
the 
symbolic 
scheme 
(4.xxiii) 
P(V) 
where 
V 
(without 
inverted 
commas, 
I 
am 
using 
the 
metalinguistic 
symbol 
to 
speak 
of 
object 


expressions) 
is 
the 
L-variable 
(as 
“x”, 
“y” 
et 
cetera) 
constituting 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
model 


sentence, 
and 
P 
(idem) 
is 
a 
L-predicate 
either 
free-variable-free 
or 
free-variable-laden. 


9. 
The 
crucial 
achievement 
is 
that 
even 
under 
these 
simplifications, 
Skolem’s 
criterion 
is 
highly 
unsatisfactory: 
in 
fact 
it 
does 
not 
introduce 
any 
distinction 
between 
monadic 
sentences 
like 
(4.xxii), 
whose 
predicate 
(4.xxiv) 
being 
the 
husband 
of 
a 
lady 
whose 
eldest 
sister 
ran 
over 
Ava’s 
mother 
is 
free-variable-free 
(absolute), 
and 
model 
sentences 
like 
he 
is 
the 
husband 
of 
a 
lady 
whose 
eldest 
sister 
ran 
over 
his 
mother 
whose 
predicate 
(4.xxv) 
being 
the 
husband 
of 
a 
lady 
whose 
eldest 
sister 
ran 
over 
his 
mother 
is 
free-variable-laden 
and 
more 
precisely 
reflexive. 
10. 
Exactly 
because 
both 
(4.xxiv) 
and 
(4.xxv) 
enter 
into 
the 
provisional 
scheme 
(4.xxiii), 
such 
a 
scheme 
does 
not 
account 
for 
the 
basic 
distinction 
between 
free-variable-free 
and 
free-variable

laden 
predicates. 
In 
order 
to 
overcome 
such 
a 
mutilating 
inadequateness, 
once 
assumed 
“C” 
as 
a 
metalinguistic 
symbol 
over 
L-constants, 
I 
oppose 
the 
scheme 


(4.xxv) 
PF(C)(V) 
or 
indifferently 
(4.xxvi) 
R(V,F(C)) 
to 
the 
scheme 
(4.xxvii) 
PF(“s”)(V) 
or 
indifferently 
(4.xxviii) 
R(V,F(“s”)) 
so 
overcoming 
the 
ambiguity 
of 
(4.xxiii), 
where 
P 
may 
be 
a 
free-variable-free 
as 
well 
as 
a 


free-variable-laden 
predicate 
without 
compromising 
the 
monadic 
character 
of 
the 
respective 
sentence. 


11. 
Until 
now 
I 
have 
spoken 
of 
sentences, 
but 
henceforth 
I 
prefer 
to 
speak 
of 
dilemmas 
because 
I 
think 
that 
it 
should 
be 
better 
and 
clearer. 
So, 
for 
instance, 
I 
will 
say 
that 
while 
(4.xxv) 
and 
(4.xxvi) 
are 
schemes 
of 
non-reflexive 
(absolute) 
dilemmas, 
(4.xxvii) 
and 
(4.xxxiii) 
are 
schemes 
of 
reflexive 
dilemmas. 
And 
incidentally 
I 
remark 
that 
paradoxical 
and 
anti-paradoxical 
(and 
para-paradoxical) 
dilemmas 
belong 
to 
the 
latter 
case. 

CHAPTER 
18 
LOGICAL 
PARADOXES 


1. 
Logical 
paradoxes 
are 
a 
challenge 
to 
the 
human 
mind. 
A 
challenge 
I 
presume 
to 
have 
won. 
Along 
the 
lines 
of 
the 
distinction 
proposed 
by 
Ramsey 
in 
The 
foundations 
of 
mathematics, 
today 
there 
is 
a 
tendency 
to 
classify 
as 
logical 
only 
the 
paradoxes 
which 
can 
be 
formulated 
in 
the 
language 
of 
a 
formal 
theory. 
Thus 
the 
father 
Liar, 
but 
also 
Grelling 
and 
so 
on 
are 
classified 
as 
epistemological 
paradoxes. 
In 
my 
opinion 
the 
analogies 
between 
the 
two 
classes 
are 
too 
profound 
to 
make 
momentous 
such 
a 
distinction. 
I 
join 
then 
Goddard 
and 
Johnston 
where 
they 
claim 
(1983, 


p.491) 
that 
what 
is 
important 
about 
the 
paradoxes 
is 
their 
common 
feature, 
not 
their 
differences 
...in 
this 
sense 
all 
are 
logical). 
Of 
course 
“all” 
must 
be 
interpreted 
in 
the 
nearly 
obvious 
acceptation 
according 
to 
which 
the 
quantification 
does 
not 
concern 
absolutely 
distinct 
disciplines 
(as 
for 
instance 
hydrostatics 
(D’Alembert) 
or 
probability 
(Bèrtrand). 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
I 
am 
ready 
to 
classify 
among 
logical 
paradoxes 
results 
that 
today 
are 
not 
considered 
as 
paradoxes 
(Schoenfinkel’s 
reduction), 
and 
even 
results 
that 
today 
are 
considered 
supreme 
achievements 
(Cantor’s 
proof, 
Gödel’s 
incompleteness 
theorems). 
2. 
I 
agree 
with 
Nelson-Lesniewski’s 
claim 
(Sobocinski, 
1949) 
according 
to 
which 
a 
paradox 
is 
much 
more 
than 
a 
contradiction: 
it 
is 
a 
contradiction 
derived 
through 
a 
seemingly 
unexceptionable 
argument 
from 
seemingly 
unexceptionable 
premises. 
Consequently 
every 
procedure 
that 
forbids 
the 
derivation 
of 
the 
paradox 
without 
explaining 
clearly 
the 
logical 
mistake 
it 
is 
born 
by, 
represents 
only 
a 
sheer 
expedient; 
for 
instance 
it 
is 
a 
sheer 
expedient 
to 
banish 
some 
intuitively 
adequate 
rule 
of 
transformation 
or 
to 
mutilate 
the 
language 
in 
order 
to 
forbid 
the 
very 
possibility 
of 
formulating 
the 
paradox. 
Since 
I 
join 
Goddard 
and 
Johnston 
also 
where 
they 
write 
Any 
technique 
which 
successfully 
removes 
the 
contradiction 
... 
we 
call 
a 
resolution, 
rather 
than 
a 
solution 
..... 
a 
solution 
is 
a 
resolution 
together 
with 
a 
rationale, 
I 
can 
concisely 
claim 
that 
in 
order 
to 
overcome 
logical 
paradoxes 
what 
we 
need 
is 
a 
solution, 
not 
a 
resolution. 


3. 
The 
basic 
presupposition 
is 
that 
no 
contradiction 
can 
be 
derived 
from 
coherent 
assumptions 
through 
a 
coherent 
reasoning. 
Therefore 
a 
derived 
contradiction 
is 
unquestionable 
evidence 
that 
either 
the 
assumptions 
or 
the 
reasoning 
hide 
some 
incoherence 
(which 
an 
easy 
etymologic 
suggestion 
induces 
me 
to 
call 
“pseudologism”). 
I 
speak 
in 
singular 
because, 
once 
more, 
I 
join 
Goddard 
and 
Johnston 
also 
in 
emphasizing 
the 
similarity 
of 
structure 
characterizing 
all 
logical 
paradoxes: 
this 
similarity 
of 
structure 
is 
fundamental. 
It 
justifies 
the 
intuitive 
view 
that 
piecemeal 
solutions 
are 
not 
solutions 
at 
all, 
and 
that 
there 
must 
be 
a 
single 
solution 
which 
applies 
to 
every 
paradox. 
That 
is: 
the 
general 
solution 
of 
logical 
paradoxes 
is 
the 
clear 
explanation 
of 
the 



pseudologism 
they 
arise 
from. 
In 
this 
sense 
the 
solution 
must 
satisfy 
three 
prejudicial 
conditions, 
and 
precisely: 


Ist 


. 
To 
be 
powerful 
enough 
to 
enclose 
every 
known 
logical 
paradox 
(it 
must 
kill 
the 
central 
ganglion-cell 
of 
the 
octopus, 
not 
simply 
cut 
off 
a 
single 
tentacle). 


IInd 
. 
Not 
to 
be 
so 
powerful 
to 
interdict 
argumentative 
techniques 
elsewhere 
useful 
and 
legitimate 
(it 
cannot 
kill 
the 
octopus 
by 
an 
explosion 
destroying 
the 
whole 
sea-fauna). 


IIIrd 
. 
To 
be 
highly 
convincing 
on 
the 
ground 
of 
a 
general 
approach 
to 
logic 
(the 
denunciation 
of 
a 
solecism, 
once 
well 
understood, 
cannot 
be 
a 
baffling 
claim). 


If 
I 
am 
not 
mistaking, 
the 
solution 
I 
propose 
satisfies 
these 
three 
prejudicial 
conditions. 
Here 
I 
expose 
it 
both 
through 
a 
formal 
and 
an 
informational 
approach. 
Yet 
there 
is 
a 
third 
and 
intuitively 
enlightening 
approach 
that, 
if 
Gods 
are 
benevolent, 
I 
will 
expose 
in 
a 
book 
specifically 
devoted 
to 
a 
representation 
of 
semantics. 


4. 
First 
of 
all 
I 
recall 
-that 
a 
dilemma 
is 
either 
closed 
(free-variable-free) 
or 
open 
(fee-variable-laden); 
-that 
a 
closed 
dilemma 
is 
a 
question 
liable 
to 
two 
opposite 
answers; 
-that 
an 
open 
dilemma 
is 
affected 
by 
an 
intrinsic 
lack 
of 
information 
forbidding 
any 
answer. 
Until 
now 
I 
have 
spoken 
of 
(logical) 
paradoxes 
under 
the 
usual 
acceptation 
of 
the 
term, 
but 
henceforth 
I 
will 
speak 
of 
paradoxes 
to 
mean 
also 
what 
are 
usually 
called 
“antiparadoxes” 
(as 
for 
instance 
the 
Truthteller). 
My 
choice 
is 
justified 
by 
two 
pieces 
of 
evidence: 


a) 
a 
dilemma 
whose 
two 
opposite 
solutions 
are 
self-confirming 
is 
not 
less 
puzzling 
than 
a 
dilemma 
whose 
two 
opposite 
solutions 
are 
self-contradictory 
b) 
the 
same 
pseudologism 
leading 
to 
paradoxical 
dilemmas 
leads 
to 
anti-paradoxical 
dilemmas 
too, 
so 
that 
the 
same 
argument 
solves 
all 
of 
them. 
4.1. 
Since 
my 
actual 
aim 
is 
to 
present 
the 
general 
solution 
in 
its 
most 
plain 
version, 
I 
do 
not 
pursue 
the 
widest 
approach, 
but 
the 
most 
accessible 
one. 
For 
instance 
only 
textual 
conversions 
are 
considered 
(that 
is: 
deictic 
conversions 
are 
neglected). 
Obviously, 
no 
fixation 
(no 
effective 
conversion) 
of 
a 
free 
variable 
is 
possible 
if 
its 
antecedent 
too 
is 
affected 
by 
a 
free 
variable 
(in 
particular, 
by 
the 
same 
free 
variable 
to 
fix). 
For 
instance, 
while 
the 
conversion 
of 


Ava 
is 
glad 
but 
her 
mother 
is 
sad 
is 
effective 
because 
the 
possibility 
to 
identify 
the 
glad 
person 
(Ava) 
entails 
the 
possibility 
to 
identify 
the 
sad 
person 
(Ava’s 
mother), 


she 
is 
glad 
but 
her 
mother 
is 
sad 
is 
defective 
because 
the 
impossibility 
to 
identify 
the 
glad 
person 
(she 
who?) 
entails 
the 
impossibility 
to 
identify 
her 
mother. 


Indexical 
dilemmas 
(more 
particularly: 
reflexive 
dilemmas) 
play 
a 
crucial 
role 
in 
the 
general 
solution 
of 
logical 
paradoxes. 
In 
fact 
such 
a 
solution 
can 
be 
summarized 
in 
the 
recognition 
that 
paradoxical 
dilemmas 
are 
(crypto-)defective 
because, 
syntactically 
reasoning, 
the 
same 
free 
variable 
to 
fix 
occurs 
free 
also 
in 
the 
antecedent 
through 
which 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
fixed. 


In 
other 
words 
paradoxical 
dilemmas 
are 
preposterous 
in 
the 
strictly 
etymologic 
acceptation 
of 
“preposterous” 
(*before 
after*) 
because 
their 
previous 
solution 
ought 
to 
represent 
the 
datum 
on 
whose 
grounds 
the 
same 
solution 
could 
be 
achieved. 
And 
the 
hypothetical 
procedure 
(if 
it 
were... 
then 
it 
ought 
to 
be....) 
by 
which 
the 
various 
paradoxes 
are 
characterized 
is 
exactly 
the 
consequence 
of 
their 
preposterousness, 
that 
is 
the 
vain 
attempt 
to 
overcome 
by 
a 
hypothetical 
postulation 
an 
intrinsic 
lack 
of 
information. 
In 
this 
sense 
Humphries’s 
distinction 
between 
diagonal 



(constructive) 
and 
heterological 
(non-constructive) 
procedures 
concerns 
a 
secondary 
aspect 
of 
the 
matter. 


5. 
The 
standard 
(extensional) 
procedure 
towards 
paradoxes 
can 
be 
schematized 
as 
follows 
-to 
consider 
a 
set 
of 
individuals 
x 
-to 
consider 
a 
set 
of 
sets 
Y 


-to 
define 
a 
correspondence 
h 
between 
x 
and 
Y 
so 
that 
Y= 
hx 


-to 
partition 
the 
pairs 
(4.x,Y) 
on 
the 
grounds 
of 
a 
relation 
f 
between 
x 
and 
Y 


-to 
consider 
the 
sets 
A 
and 
Q 
of 
those 
x 
such 
that 
fh 
x 
and 
~fh 
x 
respectively 


-to 
select 
the 
individuals 
a 
and 
q 
such 
that 
ha=A 
and 
hq=Q 


-to 
realize 
that 
the 
dilemmas 
|aÎfha| 
and 
|qÎfhq| 
(or 
indifferently 
|aÏfha|, 
and 
|qÏfhq|) 
are 
defective. 
The 
intensional 
procedure, 
once 
we 
adequate 
the 
notations 
above 
to 
an 
intensional 
context, 


is 
exactly 
the 
same; 
for 
instance 
the 
set 
A 
becomes 
the 
attribute 
(property) 
A 
and 
so 
on. 


6. 
Let 
me 
apply 
this 
scheme 
to 
Richard’s 
paradox 
(in 
one 
of 
its 
versions). 
Though 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
concision 
I 
define 
each 
set 
through 
the 
respective 
condition 
of 
membership, 
the 
discourse 
is 
even 
more 
easily 
applicable 
to 
sets 
defined 
through 
the 
list 
of 
their 
respective 
members. 
Let 
r 
be 
a 
correspondence 
between 
natural 
numbers 
x 
and 
sets 
of 
natural 
numbers 
Y. 
Under 
r, 
say, 
r(4) 
is 
the 
set 
of 
even 
numbers, 
that 
is 
{y: 
$z(z+z=y)} 


r(7) 
is 
the 
set 
of 
quadratic 
numbers, 
that 
is 
{y: 
$z(z2=y)} 


r(9) 
is 
the 
set 
of 
cubic 
numbers, 
that 
is 
{y: 
$z(z3=y)} 


r(13) 
is 
the 
set 
of 
prime 
numbers, 
that 
is 
{y: 
~ 
$wz(~ 
(w=1)&~ 
(w=y) 
& 
wz=y)} 
and 
so 
on. 
Of 
course 
in 
order 
to 
ascertain 
whether 
a 
number 
is 
a 
member 
of 
a 
set 
we 
must 
ascertain 
whether 
such 
a 
number 
satisfies 
the 
condition 
of 
membership 


(i) 
xÎ{y: 
Py)} 
↔ 
Px 
then 
for 
instance, 
while 
6 
is 
a 
member 
of 
r(4) 
because 
$z(z+z=6), 
it 
is 
not 
a 
member 
of 
r(7) 


because 
~$z(z2=6) 
and 
so 
on. 
In 
particular 
there 
are 
numbers 
(as 
4 
and 
13) 
that 
are 
members 
of 
their 
set 
and 
numbers 
(as 
7 
and 
9) 
that 
are 
not; 
it 
is 
then 
possible 
to 
define 
the 
(Richardian) 
set 


(ii) 
{y: 
yÏr(s)} 
that 
is 
the 
set 
whose 
members 
are 
the 
numbers 
which 
do 
not 
belong 
to 
their 
respective 
set. 
In 
(ii) 
we 
could 
replace 
“s” 
with 
the 
usual 
“y”, 
but 
such 
a 
replacement 
would 
be 
the 
result 
of 
a 
conversion, 
since 
the 
very 
condition 
of 
membership 
is 
not 
(iii) 
Ïr(y) 
(not 
belonging 
to 
the 
set 
assigned 
to 
a 
number 
to 
specify) 
but 
rather 
(iv) 
Ïr(s) 
(not 
belonging 
to 
the 
set 
assigned 
to 
itself, 
a 
condition 
obviously 
satisfied 
by 
the 
examples 


below). 
In 
other 
words, 
(iv) 
is 
the 
generic 
predicate 
and 
(iii) 
is 
simply 
its 
particularized 
conversion 
where 
y 
is 
the 
antecedent 
of 
the 
free 
reflexive 
variable. 
Once 
agreed 
that 
r 
is 
the 
number 
such 
that 
r(r) 
= 
{y: 
yÏr(s)} 


the 
dilemma 



|rÎ{y: 
yÏr(s)}| 
is 
paradoxical 
since 


rÎr(r) 
↔rÏr(r) 


follows 
from 
(i) 
and 
(iv). 
The 
crucial 
achievement 
is 
realizing 
that 
the 
Richardian 
set 
is 
indexical 
(Chapter 
16, 
§8.1), 
so 
to 
call 
a 
set 
whose 
condition 
of 
membership 
is 
indexical. 
While 
the 
arithmetical 
property 
a 
number 
must 
(not) 
have 
in 
order 
(not) 
to 
be 
a 
member 
of 
an 
absolute 
set 
is 
always 
the 
same 
(for 
instance 


all 
the 
members 
of 
r(4) 
are 
even, 
all 
the 
members 
of 
r(7) 
are 
quadratic, 
all 
the 
members 
of 


r(9) 
are 
cubic, 
all 
the 
members 
of 
r(13) 
are 
prime) 
the 
arithmetical 
property 
a 
number 
must 
not 


have 
in 
order 
to 
be 
a 
member 
of 
r(r) 
varies 
with 
the 
same 
number 
(for 
instance, 
while 
7 
is 
a 


member 
of 
r(r) 
because 
it 
is 
not 
quadratic, 
9 
is 
a 
member 
of 
r(r) 
because 
it 
is 
not 
cubic 
and 
so 
on). 
From 
a 
severely 
formal 
viewpoint 
I 
could 
also 
say: 
while 


$z(z+z=…) 
$z(z2=…) 
$z(z3=…) 
~ 
$yz(~ 
(y=1)&~ 
(y=x)& 
yz=…) 


are 
respectively 
the 
concatenations 
of 
primitive 
or 
previously 
defined 
symbols 
on 
whose 
grounds 
we 
form 
respectively 
r(4), 
r(7), 
r(9) 
and 
r(13), 
no 
analogous 
concatenation 
for 
r(r) 
is 
possible. 


6.1. 
Indeed 
if 
we 
should 
refer 
the 
Richardianity 
to 
ordered 
couples 
(Chapter 
6, 
§6), 
we 
could 
by-pass 
the 
indexicality; 
this 
heterodox 
approach 
will 
be 
analysed 
in 
§10 
below, 
apropos 
of 
Grelling; 
here 
I 
insist 
on 
the 
orthodox 
approach. 
Under 
it, 
since 
the 
condition 
of 
membership 
depends 
on 
a 
relation 
(of 
non-membership) 
between 
any 
specific 
number 
and 
a 
set 
of 
numbers, 
such 
a 
set 
must 
be 
previously 
and 
perfectly 
known 
in 
order 
to 
answer 
any 
specific 
dilemma; 
otherwise 
our 
answer 
may 
be 
forbidden 
by 
a 
lack 
of 
information. 
Therefore 
where 
the 
condition 
of 
membership 
to 
r(r) 
is 
sent 
back 
to 
the 
condition 
of 
(non)membership 
to 
the 
same 
set, 
we 
are 
facing 
a 
lack 
of 
information, 
a 
preposterous 
dilemma, 
a 
defective 
context, 
or 
better 
a 
cryptopreposterous 
dilemma, 
a 
crypto-defective 
dilemma, 
as 
this 
lack 
of 
information 
affects 
only 
two 
specific 
dilemmas: 
the 
paradoxical 
and 
the 
anti-paradoxical 
ones 
(in 
fact 
the 
argument 
holds 
identically 
for 
the 
anti-Richardian 
set, 
that 
is 
the 
set 
of 
numbers 
which 
are 
members 
of 
their 
respective 
set). 
From 
the 
formal 
viewpoint, 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
free 
reflexive 
variable, 
is 
not 
at 
all 


influenced 
by 
replacing 
“Ï” 
with 
“Î” 
in 
(iv). 
Just 
because 
of 
this 
presence, 
while 
it 
is 
correct, 
for 


instance, 
assuming 
“E” 
to 
name 
r(4) 
or 
“C” 
to 
name 
r(9) 
, 
assuming 
“R” 
to 
name 
r(r) 
would 
be 
a 
misleading 
step 
because 
in 
a 
definition 
like 


ÎR 
↔Ïr(s) 


the 
free 
variable 
occurring 
in 
the 
definiens 
does 
not 
occur 
in 
the 
definiendum 
. 
And 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
recognize 
that 
the 
correct 
formulation 
must 
be 
something 
like 


(iv) 
ÎRr(s) 
↔ 
Ïr(s) 
the 
paradox 
vanishes. 
In 
fact, 
for 
instance, 
while 
Rr(4) 
is 
RE, 
and 
Rr(9) 
is 
RC, 
Rr(r) 
is 


RRr(s) 
andin 
“RRr(s) 
” 
the 
free 
(reflexive) 
variable 
continues 
to 
occur. 
Let 
me 
insist 
on 
this 
central 
point. 
The 
dilemma 


4ÎRr(s)? 
can 
be 
answered 
without 
any 
appeal 
to 
a 
hypothetical 
procedure 
(if 
4 
were 
…) 
because 
the 
conversion 
of 
the 
reflexive 
variable 
into 
4ÎRr(4)? 



that 
is 
into 
4ÎRE? 


is 
effective 
(E 
is 
the 
previously 
and 
perfectly 
determined 
set 
of 
even 
numbers 
and 
the 
arithmetical 


structure 
of 
the 
number 
4 
(its 
evenness) 
is 
sufficient 
to 
entail 
that 
it 
is 
a 
member 
of 
E). 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
rÎRr(s)? 


is 
a 
(crypto-)defective 
dilemma 
because 
its 
conversion 
leads 
to 


rÎRRr(s)? 
where 
the 
same 
reflexive 
variable 
continues 
to 
occur 
free, 
and 
the 
appeal 
to 
a 
hypothetical 
procedure 
(if 
r 
should 
belong 
…) 
is 
only 
the 
already 
mentioned 
vain 
attempt 
to 
escape 
an 
intrinsic 


lack 
of 
information; 
r 
can 
neither 
belong 
to 
the 
Richardian 
set 
nor 
to 
its 
complementary 
because 
these 
sets 
are 
defined 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
their 
condition 
of 
membership 
is 
defective 
in 
exactly 
two 
particularizations 
(such 
sets 
are 
locally 
fuzzy, 
to 
follow 
a 
terminology 
Fine 
ought 
to 
appreciate). 


Therefore 
I 
partially 
agree 
with 
Goedel’s 
intuition 
where 
he 
writes 
(1944, 
p.150): 
it 
might 
even 
turn 
out 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
assume 
every 
concept 
to 
be 
significant 
everywhere 
except 
for 
certain 
“singular 
points” 
or 
“limiting 
points”, 
so 
that 
the 
paradoxes 
would 
appear 
as 
something 
analogous 
to 
dividing 
by 
zero. 
What 
I 
cannot 
accept 
is 
his 
excess 
of 
generalization 
(every 
concept) 
because 
only 
where 
a 
pretence 
of 
auto-conversion 
is 
involved 
we 
meet 
such 
singular 
points. 
Trivially: 
if 
the 
barber 
comes 
from 
another 
village, 
no 
paradox 
arises. 


6.2. 
Russell’s 
paradox, 
whose 
classical 
extensional 
version 
can 
be 
sketched 
as 
follows 
xÎy 
↔xÏxyÎy 
↔yÏy 


is 
nothing 
but 
a 
simplified 
version 
of 
the 
above 
scheme 
and 
enters 
into 
the 
same 
solution 
(y 
is 
an 


indexical 
set 
whose 
intension 
is 
Ïs). 
In 
other 
words. 
The 
formally 
correct 
definition 


xÎcx 
↔ 
xÏ 
x 
(that 
is: 
xÎcs 
↔ 
xÏs) 
overcomes 
any 
impasse, 
since 
cxÎccx 
↔ 
cxÏcx 
(that 
is: 
csÎccs 
↔ 
csÏcs) 
far 
from 
being 
contradictory, 
expresses 
an 
unquestionable 
truth 
(”c” 
is 
a 
sort 
of 
negation). 


7. 
I 
dwell 
on 
a 
collateral 
but 
perhaps 
intriguing 
consideration. 
Once 
some 
desperate 
ad 
hoc 
proposals 
(such 
as 
banning 
tout 
court 
reflexive 
predicates 
from 
the 
language) 
are 
rejected, 
and 
once 
some 
marginal 
differences 
between 
Poincaré’s 
and 
Russell’s 
positions 
are 
neglected, 
impredicativity 
is 
the 
only 
general 
solution 
of 
logical 
paradoxes 
till 
today 
suggested. 
According 
to 
it, 
any 
entity 
defined 
by 
an 
expression 
which 
contains 
a 
bound 
variable 
must 
be 
excluded 
from 
the 


values 
of 
this 
variable. 
Unfortunately 
such 
a 
solution 
is 
too 
expensive. 
This 
vicious 
circle 


principle 
... 
is 
in 
danger 
of 
mutilating 
rather 
than 
purifying 
mathematics 
(Beth 
1959, 
p.499). 
And 


precisely 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
overcoming 
this 
heavy 
difficulty 
a 
distinction 
has 
been 
introduced 
(Hintikka 
1956, 
p. 
244) 
between 
an 
innocent 
and 
an 
insidious 
impredicativity. 
According 
to 
Beth’s 
same 
examples, 


"y(4.xy=x 
& 
yx=x 
& 
$z(yz=x 
& 
zy=x)) 


(which 
defines 
the 
unitary 
element 
of 
a 
group) 
and 


"y($$z(zÎm 
& 
z>y) 
« 
(y<x)) 



(which 
defines 
the 
least 
superior 
border 
of 
a 
set 
m 
of 
natural 
numbers) 
and 


"x(4.xÎn) 
« 
"m((1Îm 
& 
(yÎm 
® 
(y+1) 
Îm)) 
® 
xÎm) 


(which 
defines 
the 
set 
n 
of 
natural 
numbers) 
are 
all 
innocent 
(and 
theoretically 
precious) 
impredicative 
definitions. 


On 
the 
other 
hand 
(v) 
"x(4.xÎy 
« 
~(4.xÎx)) 
(which 
defines 
the 
set 
of 
sets 
which 
are 
not 
members 
of 
themselves), 
is 
an 
insidious 
impredicative 
definition. 


But 
from 
our 
viewpoint 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
remark 
that 
only 
(v), 
once 
reformulated 
through 
the 
help 


of 
a 
reflexive 
variable 
in 
order 
to 
underline 
the 
crucial 
passage, 
would 
involve 
an 
auto-conversion. 
This 
is 
the 
deep 
reason 
why 
(Hintikka, 
ibidem) 
paradoxes 
cannot 
be 
formulated 
in 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
'innocent' 
impredicativities. 


Other 
proposals 
(as 
Hintikka’s 
strongly 
exclusive 
interpretation 
of 
quantifiers) 
succeed 
in 
forbidding 
such 
auto-conversion 
but 
(at 
least 
in 
my 
opinion) 
fail 
in 
explaining 
why 
and 
where 
such 
a 
strongly 
exclusive 
interpretation 
is 
necessary. 


7.1. 
If 
we 
intend 
to 
preserve 
the 
term 
“impredicativism” 
to 
mean 
the 
pseudologism 
the 
logical 
paradoxes 
are 
born 
by, 
No 
indexical 
free 
variable 
can 
be 
converted 
by 
a 
free-variable-laden 
antecedent 
is 
the 
very 
rule 
that 
bans 
any 
impredicativism. 
But 
indeed, 
more 
than 
a 
specific 
addictive 
rule, 
it 
is 
simply 
an 
obvious 
requirement 
telling 
us 
that 
if 
we 
violate 
it, 
we 
get 
an 
expression 
where 
a 
free 
variable 
continues 
to 
occur, 
and 
treating 
a 
free-varable-laden 
expression 
as 
a 
free-variable-free 
one 
is 
unquestionably 
incoherent. 
In 
this 
sense 
the 
informational 
approach 
does 
not 
require 
any 
addictive 
prescription 
besides 
the 
respect 
of 
coherence, 
that 
is, 
in 
our 
case, 
not 
defining 
an 
indexical 
quantity 
and 
treating 
it, 
although 
implicitly, 
as 
if 
it 
were 
absolute. 
Neither 
a 
paradoxical 
dilemma 
is 
self-contradictory 
nor 
an 
anti-paradoxical 
dilemma 
is 
self-legitimating. 
Both 
of 
them 
are 
(crypto)defective 
because 
both 
of 
them 
hide 
a 
lack 
of 
information. 


8. 
Since 
I 
do 
not 
know 
Grelling’s 
paradox 
in 
his 
original 
version, 
I 
quote 
the 
Britannica 
(whose 
terminological 
choices 
will 
be 
adopted 
in 
the 
following 
discussion 
too). 
Let 
us 
classify 
the 
adjectives 
of 
the 
English 
language 
as 
to 
whether 
they 
are 
self-
applicable 
or 
non-self-applicable. 
An 
adjective 
is 
self 
applicable 
if 
it 
has 
the 
property 
it 
expresses; 
e.g. 
the 
adjective 
“short” 
is 
self-applicable 
since 
it 
is 
a 
short 
word, 
but 
“long” 
is 
non-self-applicable 
since 
it 
is 
not 
a 
long 
word. 
Every 
adjective 
is 
either 
self-applicable 
or 
non-self-applicable, 
and 
cannot 
of 
course 
be 
both. 
Which 
is 
the 
case 
for 
the 
adjective 
“non-self-applicable”? 
Suppose 
that 
it 
is 
self-
applicable. 
Then 
it 
has 
the 
property 
it 
expresses, 
i.e. 
it 
is 
non-self-applicable, 


contrary 
to 
our 
supposition. 
Thence 
it 
is 
non-self-applicable. 
This 
means 
that 
it 


does 
not 
have 
the 
property 
it 
expresses, 
the 
property 
on 
non-self-applicability. 
But 
this 
is 
just 
another 
way 
of 
saying 
that 
it 
is 
not 
non-self-applicable. 
We 
have 
again 
arrived 
at 
two 
contradictory 
results. 


In 
order 
to 
formalize 
the 
solution 
in 
the 
simplest 
way 
I 
agree 
upon 
the 
following 
symbology: 
-“x”, 
“y” 
... 
variables 
ranging 
over 
adjectives 



and 
in 
particular 


-“b”, 
“m”, 
“f” 
and 
“u” 
“blepharospastic”, 
“monosyllabic”, 
“fresh” 
and 
“useless” 
respectively 


-“a” 
and 
“q” 
“self-applicable” 
and 
“non-self-applicable” 
respectively 


-X, 
Y, 
B, 
M 
et 
cetera 
properties 
respectively 
adduced 
by 
“x”, 
“y”, 
“b”. 
“m” 
et 
cetera. 


I 
underline 
that 
the 
use 
of 
individual 
variables 
and 
individual 
constants 
as 
“x”, 
“b” 
et 


cetera 
for 
adjectives 
is 
not 
at 
all 
an 
abusive 
license, 
owing 
to 
the 
metalinguistic 
viewpoint 
from 
which 
we 
observe 
them. 
That 
is: 
L-adjectives 
are 
named 
by 
ML–substantives 
(Chapter 
2, 
§5: 
substantivizing 
effect 
of 
quotation 
marks). 


As 
soon 
as 
we 
(provisionally) 
agree 
to 
define 
the 
self-applicability 
and 
the 
non-self 
applicability 
by 
(vi) 
A(4.x) 
↔ 
X(4.x) 


(vii) 
Q(4.x) 
↔ 
~X(4.x) 
we 
derive 
the 
contradictory 


(viii) 
Q(q) 
↔ 
~Q(q) 
by 
particularization 
of 
(vii) 
on 
q 
(for 
the 
sake 
of 
concision 
henceforth 
I 
set 
aside 
(vi) 
and 
reason 
only 
on 
(vii)). 


Though 
here 
too 
the 
solution 
depends 
on 
the 
logical 
impossibility 
of 
promoting 
an 
indexicality 
by 
an 
auto-conversion, 
I 
enter 
into 
details, 
reminding 
the 
reader 
of 
the 
detailed 
example 
proposed 
in 
§6 
of 
Chapter 
16. 


9. 
Let 
(4.x,Y) 
be 
an 
ordered 
couple 
where 
the 
adjective 
x 
and 
the 
property 
Y 
are 
casually 
joined. 
By 
definition 
a 
couple 
is 
concordant 
(C) 
iff 
Y(4.x) 
and 
discordant 
(D) 
iff 
~(Y(4.x)). 


Indeed 
a 
more 
articulate 
analysis 
(Chapter 
9, 
§5.1) 
ought 
to 
distinguish 
between 
properly 
discordant 
couples 
as 
for 
instance 
(b,M) 
where 
the 
“~” 
occurring 
in 
“~M(b)” 
means 
an 
oppositive 


negation, 
and 
improper 
(or 
improperly 
discordant) 
couples 
as 
for 
instance 
(m,B) 
where 
the 
“~”occurring 
in 
“~B(m)” 
means 
an 
exclusive 
negation. 
Yet 
I 
am 
pleased 
with 
the 
simple 
opposition 
between 
concordant 
and 
discordant 
couples 
because 


-the 
quoted 
version 
of 
the 
paradox 
complies 
with 
such 
a 
simplified 
assumption 
(every 
adjective 
is 
either 
self-applicable 
or 
non-self-applicable) 


-the 
same 
assumption 
is 
the 
usual 
one 
(cf. 
for 
instance 
Church 
in 
D.D.Runes 
The 


Dictionary 
of 
Philosophy 
under 
“(Logical) 
Paradoxes”) 


-the 
argument 
can 
be 
easily 
extrapolated 
to 
a 
further 
distinction 
between 
proper 
and 
improper 
discordance. 


Then 
(ix) 
C(4.x,Y) 
↔ 
Y(4.x) 
and 


(4.x) 
D(4.x,Y) 
↔ 
~(Y(4.x)) 
symbolize 
the 
above 
definitions 
(here 
too 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
concision 
I 
set 
aside 
(ix)). 
Just 
as 
(4.x) 
defines 
a 
property 
pertaining 
to 
ordered 
couples 


(4.xi) 
DY(4.x) 
↔ 
~(Y(4.x)) 


define 
the 
Y-discordance, 
a 
(relational) 
property 
that, 
obviously, 
pertains 
to 
adjectives. 



In 
order 
to 
answer 
any 
specific 
dilemma 
concerning 
the 
Y-discordance 
of 
a 
given 
adjective 


it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
particularize 
(4.xi). 
For 
instance, 
to 
ascertain 
whether 
b 
is 
M-discordant 
we 
proceed 
as 
follows: 


DM(b)? 
~ 
(M(b))? 


and 
since 
we 
know 
what 
“monosyllabic” 
means 
and 
how 
many 
syllables 
“blepharospastic” 
is 
formed 
by, 
we 
can 
conclude 


~(M(b)) 
DM(b) 


that 
is 
the 
M-discordance 
of 
the 
adjective 
under 
scrutiny. 
Of 
course 
should 
we 
start 
from 


CM(b)? 
the 
conclusion 
would 
be 
the 
same 
(that 
is 
~CM(b)), 
as 
the 
dilemma 
is 
the 
same. 


9.1. 
Since 
a 
correspondence 
h 
exists 
between 
an 
adjective 
and 
the 
property 
it 
means 
(h=s) 
X=h 
x 
therefore 
the 
assumption 


(4.xii) 
Y=X 
transforms 
the 
discordance 
into 
the 
non-self-applicability; 
in 
fact, 
under 
(4.xii) 
the 
second 
member 
of 
any 
ordered 
couple 
is 
just 
the 
property 
expressed 
by 
the 
respective 
first 
members. 
Nevertheless 


the 
‘binary 
nature’ 
of 
every 
couple 
is 
not 
compromised 
by 
the 
possibility 
of 
‘computing’ 
its 
second 
member 
in 
function 
of 
its 
first. 
Though 
it 
pertains 
to 
adjectives, 
the 
(non)selfapplicability 
continues 
depending 
on 
the 
expressed 
property, 
too. 
For 
instance 
if 
we 
interpret 
“fresh” 
as 
a 
synonymous 
of 
“new”, 
“fresh” 
is 
non-self-applicable 
for 
it 
is 
an 
old 
adjective, 
but 
if 
we 
interpret 
“fresh” 
as 
a 
synonym 
of 
“active”, 
it 
is 
self-applicable. 


In 
other 
words. 
Exactly 
as 
“he” 
is 
a 
precise 
and 
constant 
indexical 
substantive 
which, 
in 
different 
contexts, 
is 
converted 
into 
different 
absolute 
substantives 
(as 
“Tom”, 
“Bob” 
and 
so 
on), 
“non-self-applicable” 
is 
a 
precise 
and 
constant 
indexical 
adjective 
which, 
in 
different 
contexts, 
is 
converted 
into 
different 
absolute 
adjectives 
(as 
“polysyllabic”, 
“useful” 
and 
so 
on). 
In 
this 
sense, 
just 
as 
we 
say 
that 
“he” 
is 
a 
pronoun 
(a 
pro-noun), 
we 
can 
say 
that 
“non-self-applicable” 
is 
a 
proadjective 
(a 
pro-adjective). 
And 
in 
fact 
where 
ascribed 
to 
“monosyllabic” 
the 
non-selfapplicability 
is 
the 
polysyllabicity 
(“non-self-applicable” 
is 
converted 
into 
“polysyllabic”), 
where 
ascribed 
to 
“useless” 
the 
non-self-applicability 
is 
the 
usefulness 
(“non-self-applicable” 
is 


converted 
into 
“useful”) 
and 
so 
on. 
Therefore 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
free 
variable 
in 
its 
symbolization 
is 
a 
formal 
must, 
exactly 
in 
order 
not 
to 
mistake 
the 
typographical 
invariance 
of 
the 
adjective 
for 
the 
invariance 
of 
the 
adduced 
property. 
Informally, 
such 
a 
tramp 
is 
evident 
in 
the 
version 
replacing 
“non-self-applicable” 
and 
“self-applicable” 
with 
“heterologic” 
and 
“homologic”, 
because, 
contrary 
to 
“self”, 
“hetero” 
and 
“homo” 
tend 
to 
conceal 
their 
role 
of 
variables. 


This 
conclusion 
is 
formally 
confirmed 
by 
a 
comparison 
between 
(vii) 
and 


DX(4.x) 
↔ 
~(4.x(4.x)) 


(drawn 
from 
(4.x) 
through 
(4.xii)) 
Realizing 
that 
“Q” 
is 
an 
elliptically 
incorrect 
notation 
for 


“QX” 
is 
realizing 
the 
impossibility 
to 
obtain 
an 
effective 
auto-conversion, 
since 
manifestly 
in 


“QQX” 
the 
free 
variable 
continues 
occurring 
free. 
Furthermore 
it 
is 
also 
realizing 
why, 
on 
the 
contrary, 


(4.xiii) 
is 
“blepharospastic” 
(non)self-applicable? 
or 

(4.xiv) 
is 
“monosyllabic” 
(non)self-applicable? 
and 
so 
on 
are 
effective 
dilemmas 
(no 
free 
variable 
survives 
to 
the 
conversion 
of 
“QX” 
into 
“QB” 
or 
into 
“QM” 
and 
so 
on). 
Finally 
it 
is 
also 
realizing 
why 
Grelling’s 
dilemma 
is 
crypto-defective; 
because 
all 
the 
other 
analogous 
dilemmas, 
as 
(4.xiii), 
(4.xiv) 
and 
so 
on 
are 
effective 
(nonpreposterous), 
that 
is 
because, 
save 
two 
exceptions 
(two 
singular 
points), 
in 
a 
scheme 
like 


is 
…... 
(non)self 
applicable? 
replacing 
the 
dots 
with 
the 
name 
of 
an 
adjective 
bears 
a 
non-defective 
dilemma. 


9.2. 
Another 
strong 
argument 
supporting 
the 
indexicality 
of 
(non-)self-applicability 
runs 
as 
follows. 
The 
(im)properness 
of 
any 
proposition 
obtained 
by 
the 
attribution 
of 
an 
absolute 
property 
to 
an 
adjective 
does 
not 
depend 
on 
the 
adjective. 
For 
instance, 
since 
“useless” 
is 
monosyllabic 
is 
(false 
but) 
proper, 
we 
can 
substitute 
“useless” 
with 
whatever 
other 
adjective 
without 
losing 
the 
properness 
of 
the 
resulting 
proposition 
(which 
for 
instance 
is 
true 
(then 
proper) 
if 
the 
substitutor 
is 
“fresh”, 
false 
yet 
anyhow 
proper 
if 
the 
substitutor 
is 
“blepharospastic” 
et 
cetera). 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
though 


“useless” 
is 
non-self-applicable 
is 
another 
(false 
but) 
proper 
proposition, 
if 
the 
substitutor 
is 
“blepharospastic” 
we 
get 
an 
improper 
proposition 
and 
if 
the 
substitutor 
is 
“fresh” 
we 
get 
a 
proper 
proposition 
which 
will 
be 
true 
or 
false 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
acceptation 
of 
“fresh”. 
This 
deep 
discrepancy 
depends 
just 
on 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
meaning 
of 
“non-self-applicable” 
(the 
property 
it 
expresses) 
varies 
with 
the 
adjective 
it 
is 
attributed 
to; 
such 
a 
deep 
discrepancy, 
then, 
depends 
on 
the 
deep 
discrepancy 
between 
absolute 
(invariant) 
and 
indexical 
(variant) 
properties. 


10. 
If 
we 
modify 
the 
original 
version 
of 
Grelling’s 
paradox 
by 
making 
Q 
a 
property 
pertaining 
to 
ordered 
couples 
as 
D, 
that 
is 
if 
we 
assume 
by 
definition 


(4.xv) 
Q(4.x,X) 
↔ 
~(4.x(4.x)) 


the 
same 
Q 
is 
no 
longer 
an 
indexical 
property 
((4.xv) 
is 
a 
formally 
correct 
formula 
as 
(4.x)). 
Yet 


no 
contradiction 
can 
be 
derived 
from 
(4.xv); 
in 
fact 
the 
particularization 
of 
x 
on 
q 
(therefore 
the 


particularization 
of 
X 
on 
Q) 
leads 
to 


(4.xvi) 
Q(q,Q) 
↔ 
~(Q(q)) 
and 
(4.xvi), 
far 
from 
being 
contradictory, 
allows 
us 
to 
deepen 
the 
analysis 
by 
punctuating 
the 
two 
possible 
readings 
of 
“~”. 
In 
the 
oppositive 
reading, 
since 
Q 
pertains 
to 
couples, 
Q(q) 
is 
improper, 


and 
the 
particularization 
is 
then 
illegitimate. 
In 
the 
exclusive 
reading, 
precisely 
because 
Q(q) 
is 
improper, 
the 
second 
member 
of 
(4.xvi) 
is 
true. 
This 
means 
that, 
under 
this 
reading, 


Q(q,Q) 


is 
true 
(the 
couple 
is 
non-self-applicable); 
a 
conclusion 
which 
agrees 
perfectly 
with 
our 
intuition, 
for 
actually 
Q 
(by 
definition 
a 
property 
pertaining 
to 
couples) 
cannot 
be 
properly 
ascribed 
to 
an 


adjective, 
therefore 
(q,Q) 
is 
a 
non-self-applicable 
couple. 


10.1. 
A 
willing 
reader 
might 
be 
tempted 
to 
revive 
the 
paradox 
by 
a 
definition 
like 
(4.xvii) 
Q(4.x,X) 
↔ 
~(4.x(4.x,X)) 

where 
actually 
both 
variables 
of 
the 
definiens 
occur 
also 
in 
the 
definiendum. 
A 
misleading 
temptation, 
because, 
contrary 
to 
(4.xvi), 
in 
(4.xvii) 
both 
the 
definiens 
and 
the 
definiendum 
have 
the 
same 
argument 
(that 
is 
(4.x,X)); 
then, 
put 
shortly, 
(4.xvii) 
states 
an 
equivalence 
between 
Q 
and 
~X; 
but 
of 
course, 
as 
X 
is 
an 
indexical 
property 
which 
varies 
with 
x, 
its 
indexicality 
entails 
that 


“Q” 
is 
an 
incorrect 
(and 
misleading) 
notation. 
In 
other 
words, 
(4.xvii) 
falls 
into 
the 
same 
formal 
omission 
affecting 
(vii). 


11. 
The 
Liar 
(the 
Truthteller) 
too 
is 
born 
by 
the 
preposterousness 
of 
the 
paradoxical 
dilemma. 
Its 
peculiarity 
depends 
only 
on 
the 
different 
status 
of 
the 
objects 
the 
reflexive 
variable 
ranges 
over; 
while 
Richard 
refers 
to 
numbers, 
Russell 
to 
sets 
and 
Grelling 
to 
adjectives, 
Liar 
and 
Truthteller 
refer 
to 
sentences, 
that 
is 
to 
objects 
whose 
syntactical 
status 
is 
the 
same 
as 
that 
of 
the 
(paradoxical) 
dilemma 
under 
scrutiny. 
Indeed 
it 
would 
be 
better 
to 
reason 
about 
propositions, 
yet 
in 
order 
to 
adequate 
the 
following 
discourse 
to 
the 
current 
terminology 
I 
accept 
not 
only 
to 
reason 
about 
sentences 
but 
also 
to 
speak 
of 
false 
and 
true 
sentences 
though 
I 
ought 
to 
speak 
of 
fallacious 
and 
veracious 
sentences 
(the 
only 
caution 
is 
the 
use 
of 
“FL” 
and 
“VR” 
instead 
of 
“F” 
and 
“T” 
respectively). 
Anyhow 
a 
stricter 
approach 
is 
sketched 
in 
§11.7. 
The 
canonical 
formulation 
of 
the 
Liar, 
concisely, 
runs 
as 
follows: 


(4.xviii) 
this 
sentence 
is 
false 
is 
self-contradictory 
because 
if 
it 
were 
true, 
it 
would 
state 
its 
falsity, 
so 
it 
would 
be 
false, 
and 
vice 
versa. 
Reciprocally 
(Truthteller) 
this 
sentence 
is 
true 
is 
anyhow 
self 
confirming 
because 
et 
cetera. 


Once 
recalled 
that, 
according 
to 
Tarski’s 
approach, 
(4.xix) 
VR(“Y(4.x)”) 
↔ 
Y(4.x) 
and 


(4.xx) 
FL(“Y(4.x)”) 
↔ 
~Y(4.x) 
are 
the 
conditions 
for 
truth 
and 
falsity, 
I 
organize 
the 
solution 
through 
five 
progressive 
examples. 


11.1. 
First 
example 
(standard 
context). 
The 
assignation 
of 
an 
alethic 
value 
to 
(4.xxi) 
Ava 
is 
blonde 
(B(a)) 
that 
is 
the 
solution 
of 
the 
respective 
dilemma 
|(B(a))| 
runs 
as 
follows: 
VR(“B(a)”)? 
VR(“B(a)”) 
↔ 
B(a) 
B(a)? 


or 
equivalently 


FL(“B(a)”)? 
FL(“B(a)”) 
↔ 
~B(a) 
~B(a)? 
(the 
two 
opposite 
questions 
are 
equivalent 
because, 
obviously, 
answering 
one 
of 
them 
is 
answering 
the 
other, 
that 
is 
because 
their 
common 
dilemma 
depends 
on 
the 
same 
collative 
datum, 
just 
represented 
by 
the 
piece 
of 
information 
concerning 
Ava’s 
hair). 
And 
since 
Ava 
is 
raven 
haired, 


(4.xxii) 
~B(a)! 
is 
the 
acquirement 
we 
draw 
from 
the 
sight 
of 
her, 
so 
the 
same 
(4.xxii) 
allows 
us 
to 
conclude 
that 
~VR(“B(a)”) 
or 
equivalently 
that 
FL(“B(a)”). 



11.2. 
Second 
example 
(metalinguistic 
context). 
The 
assignation 
of 
an 
alethic 
value 
to 
(4.xxiii) 
“Ava 
is 
blonde” 
is 
(printed 
with) 
green 
(ink) 
G(“B(a)”) 
runs 
analogously 
as 
follows: 
VR(“G(“B(a)”)”)? 
VR(“G(“B(a)”)”) 
↔ 
G(“B(a)”) 
G(“B(a)”)? 


and 
the 
collative 
datum 
(drawn 
from 
the 
sight 
of 
the 
object 
sentence 
(4.xxiii) 
speaks 
of) 
is 


(4.xxiv) 
~G(“B(a)”) 
(the 
object 
sentence 
(4.xxiii) 
speaks 
of 
is 
not 
printed 
with 
green 
ink) 
therefore 
(4.xxiv) 
allows 
us 
to 
conclude 
that 
~VR(“G 
(“B(a)”)”) 
or 
equivalently 
that 
FL(“G 
(“B(a)”)”). 


11.3. 
Third 
example 
(auto-referential 
context). 
The 
assignation 
of 
an 
alethic 
value 
to 
(4.xxv) 
this 
sentence 
is 
green 
(G(s)) 
runs 
analogously 
as 
follows: 
VR(“G(s)”)? 
VR(“G(s)”) 
↔ 
G(s) 
G(s)? 


that 
is, 
by 
conversion 
of 
the 
reflexive 
variable 
(whose 
antecedent 
is 
the 
whole 
(4.xxv)) 


(4.xxvi) 
G(“G(s)”)? 
and 
the 
collative 
datum 
(drawn 
from 
the 
sight 
of 
the 
sentence 
(4.xxv) 
speaks 
of, 
that 
is 
the 
same 
(4.xxv)), 
is 


(4.xxvii) 
~ 
G(“G(s)”) 
(the 
sentence 
(4.xxv) 
is 
not 
printed 
with 
green 
ink) 
therefore 
(4.xxvii) 
allows 
us 
to 
conclude 
that 


~VR(“G(s)”). 
Of 
course 
the 
mentioned 
conversion 
is 
effective 
because 
what 
occurs 
in 
(4.xxvi) 
is 
not 
a 
free 
(reflexive) 
variable, 
but 
the 
name 
of 
a 
sentence 
where 
the 
same 
variable 
occurs, 
that 
is 
because 
the 
same 
variable 
is 
mentioned, 
not 
used, 
and 
obviously 
the 
name 
of 
a 
variable 
is 
a 
constant 
exactly 
as 
the 
name 
of 
a 
constant); 
furthermore 
the 
just 
ascertained 
possibility 
of 
solving 
(4.xxvi) 
is 
the 
best 
evidence 
that 
it 
is 
a 
free-variable-free 
dilemma. 


Incidentally. 
Though 
(4.xxv) 
is 
unquestionably 
auto-referential, 
the 
alethic 
procedure 
did 
not 
present 
any 
difficulty. 
The 
proposal 
of 
overcoming 
the 
Liar 
by 
forbidding 
auto-referential 


sentences 
is 
then, 
at 
the 
very 
least, 
too 
severe 
an 
intervention 
(I 
recall 
the 
condition 
IInd 
of 
§3). 


11.4. 
Fourth 
example 
(alethic 
context). 
The 
assignation 
of 
an 
alethic 
value 
to 
(4.xxviii) 
“this 
sentence 
is 
green” 
is 
true 
(VR(“G(s)”)) 
runs 
analogously: 
VR(“VR(“G(s)”)”)? 
VR(“VR(“G(s)”)”) 
↔ 
VR(“G(s)”) 
VR(“G(s)”)? 


the 
collative 
datum 
is 
then 
represented 
by 
the 
result 
of 
a 
collation. 
In 
order 
to 
achieve 
this 
datum 


the 
context 
must 
allow 
us 
to 
perform 
such 
a 
collation, 
and 
in 
order 
to 
perform 
such 
a 
collation 
we 
must 
previously 
know 
both 
correlata, 
that 
is 
the 
proposition 
adduced 
by 
the 
object 
sentence 
within 
quotation 
marks 
in 
(4.xxviii) 
and 
the 
cognition 
drawn 
from 
the 
sight 
of 
the 
ink 
used 
to 
print 
the 
same 
object 
sentence; 
since 
we 
know 
both 
of 
them, 
we 
can 
actually 
achieve 
the 
result, 
and 
since 
it 
is 
anti-collative 
(since 
our 
statute 
acquires 
the 
(meta)cognition 
that 
the 
object 
proposition 
is 
rejected 
by 
the 
object 
cognition), 
the 
collative 
(meta)datum 


~VR(“G(s)”) 


allows 
us 
to 
conclude 
that 


FL(“VR(“G(s)”)” 


(actually 
it 
is 
false 
that 
the 
object 
sentence 
(4.xxviii) 
speaks 
of 
is 
true). 



11.5. 
The 
fifth 
example 
(auto-referential 
alethic 
context) 
is 
the 
Truthteller. 
The 
assignation 
of 
an 
alethic 
value 
to 
(4.xxix) 
this 
sentence 
is 
true 
(VR(s)) 
runs 
analogously: 
VR(“VR(s)”)? 
VR(“VR(s)”) 
↔ 
VR(s) 
VR(s)? 


and 
here 
too, 
since 
(4.xxix) 
concerns 
an 
alethic 
predicate 
just 
as 
(4.xxviii), 
the 
collative 


(meta)datum 
ought 
to 
be 
represented 
by 
the 
result 
of 
a 
collation. 
But 
here 
the 
context 
does 
not 
allow 
us 
to 
perform 
such 
a 
collation 
because 
we 
cannot 
know 
the 
second 
correlatum; 
in 
fact 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
represented 
by 
the 
result 
of 
the 
same 
collation 
under 
scrutiny 
(something 
like 
Baron 
Münchhausen 
pulling 
himself 
out 
of 
a 
swamp 
by 
his 
own 
hair). 
In 
other 
words. 
While 


(4.xxx) 
VR(“G(s)”)? 
is 
an 
effective 
dilemma 
because 
the 
typographical 
aspect 
of 
the 
object 
sentence 
allows 
us 
to 
ascertain 
its 
(non)greenness 
(allows 
us 
to 
know 
the 
homologous 
cognition), 
contrary 
to 
(4.xxx) 


VR(s)? 


that 
is, 
by 
conversion, 


VR(“VR(s)”)? 


is 
a 
defective 
(preposterous) 
dilemma 
because 
the 
intrinsically 
relational 
nature 
of 
alethic 
predicates 
forbids 
us 
to 
ascertain 
them 
on 
the 
only 
ground 
of 
the 
sentence 
(of 
the 
proposition) 
under 
scrutiny. 


Reciprocally 
(yet 
identically), 
if 
we 
start 
from 
(4.xviii), 
we 
get 


FL(“FL(s)”)? 
FL(“FL(s)”) 
↔ 
~FL(s) 
~FL(s)? 
therefore 
here 
too 
the 
collative 
datum 
ought 
to 
be 
represented 
by 
the 
solution 
of 
the 
dilemma 
under 
scrutiny. 


Both 
Liar 
and 
Truthteller 
are 
affected 
by 
the 
same 
and 
congenital 
lack 
of 
information. 


11.6. 
The 
‘double 
face’ 
version 
of 
the 
Liar 
(“the 
next 
sentence 
is 
true” 
where 
the 
next 
sentence 
is 
“the 
preceding 
sentence 
is 
false”) 
is 
immediately 
reducible 
to 
the 
classical 
version. 
In 
fact 
the 
sentence 
stating 
that 
its 
next 
sentence 
is 
true, 
states 
that 
the 
sentence 
preceding 
its 
next 
sentence 
is 
false, 
then 
it 
states 
its 
own 
falsity. 
Thus 
the 
preposterousness 
is 
fully 
maintained. 
11.7. 
In 
order 
to 
show 
how 
preposterousness 
can 
be 
reduced 
to 
an 
attempt 
of 
auto-
conversion, 
let 
me 
submit 
Tarski’s 
condition 
to 
a 
deeper 
analysis. 
Alethics 
is 
an 
intrinsically 
relational 
doctrine 
because, 
roughly 
speaking, 
it 
concerns 
some 
relations 
between 
sentences 
and 
facts 
(better: 
between 
propositions 
and 
cognitions). 
A 
(declarative) 
sentence 
x 
singles 
out 
a 
proposition 
sx, 
and 
a 
proposition 
singles 
out 
a 


homologous 
cognition 
ysx 
verifying 
or 
falsifying 
it 
(strictly: 
a 
proposition 
singles 
out 
a 
k-

cognition 
k-verifying 
or 
k-falsifying 
it); 
therefore 
two 
opposite 
propositions 
have 
the 
same 
homologous 
cognition. 
Just 
as 
the 
above 
approach 
(which 
adopts 
the 
canonical 
viewpoint 
according 
to 
which 
alethic 
predicates 
pertain 
to 
sentences) 
leads 
to 
homologous 
couples 
(sx, 
ysx), 
the 
(correct) 
viewpoint 
(according 
to 
which 
alethic 
predicates 
pertain 
to 
propositions) 
would 
lead 
directly 
to 
couples 
(y, 
yy). 
Anyhow 
a 
basic 
distinction 
opposes 
the 
concordant 


couples 
C 
defined 
through 


(4.xxxi) 
C(sx, 
ysx) 
« 
(sx=ysx) 
(that 
is: 
C(sx, 
ysx) 
« 
(sx=ys)) 
and 
discordant 
couples 
D 
defined 
through 



(4.xxxii) 
D(sx, 
ysx) 
« 
(~sx=ysx) 
(that 
is: 
D(sx, 
ysx) 
« 
(~sx=ys)) 
(henceforth, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
concision, 
I 
neglect 
(4.xxxii). 
To 
replace 
(4.xxxi) 
with 


(4.xxxiii) 
C(sx) 
« 
(sx=ys) 
would 
be 
a 
formal 
and 
substantial 
abuse. 
In 
fact 
-formally, 
in 
(4.xxxiii) 
“C” 
becomes 
an 
abbreviation 
of 
“=ys”, 
then 
a 
free 
reflexive 
variable 
disappears; 
-substantially, 
(4.xxxiii) 
would 
make 
the 
concordance 
between 
a 
proposition 
and 
its 
homologous 
cognition 
a 
property 
of 
the 
same 
proposition 
(which 
obviously 
is 
not, 
since 
the 
homologous 
cognition 
is 
an 
independent 
and 
determinative 
datum). 
Indeed, 
once 
more, 
what 
we 
can 
correctly 
derive 
from 
(4.xxxi) 
is 


(4.xxxiv) 
Cys(sx) 
« 
(sx=ys) 
where 
the 
indexicality 
of 
the 
predicate 
“concordant 
with 
its 
homologous” 
is 
correctly 
witnessed 
by 
“Cys 
” 
(unquestionably 
if 
a 
homologous 
couple 
is 
concordant, 
the 
proposition 
is 
concordant 
with 
its 
homologous 
cognition). 
But 
(4.xxxi) 
and 
(4.xxxiv) 
show 
that 
the 
context 
is 
strictly 
analogous 
to 
Richard’s 
and 
Grelling’s 
ones: 
as 
sx=ys 
is 
the 
condition 
of 
truth, 
the 
indexical 


predicate 
Cys 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
predicate 
of 
truth, 
and 
any 
attempt 
of 
auto-conversion 
for 
the 
free 
reflexive 
variable 
is 
devoted 
to 
an 
even 
formal 
failure. 


11.8. 
Let 
me 
resume 
by 
particularizing 
the“Y(4.x)” 
of 
(4.xix) 
on 
some 
already 
proposed 
sentences: 
“B(a)” 
“G(s)” 
“VR(“G(s)”)” 
“VR(s)” 


VR(“B(a)”)? 
VR(“G(s)”)? 
VR(“VR(“G(s)”)”)? 
VR(“VR(s)”)? 


(Tarski’s 
condition) 


VR(“B(a)”)«B(a) 
VR(“G(s)”)«G(s) 
VR(“VR(“G(s)”)”)« 
VR(“G(s)”) 
VR(“VR(s)”)« 
VR(s) 
B(a)? 
G(s)? 
VR(“G(s)”)? 
VR(s)? 


by 
conversion 


G(“G(s)”)? 
VR(“VR(s)”)? 
Circularity: 
by 
acquirement 
of 
the 
respective 
cognition 
the 
grounding 
cognition 
ought 
to 
be 
~G(s) 
preposterously 
represented 
by 
its 


~B(a) 
~G(“G(s)”) 
~VR(“G(s)”) 
same 
solution. 
~G(s) 
~VR(“B(a)”) 
~VR(“G(s)”) 
~VR(“VR(“G(s)”)”) 
????? 


The 
correct 
conclusion 
is 
once 
more 
the 
same: 
neither 
the 
Liar 
dilemma 
is 
self-
contradictory 
nor 
is 
the 
Truthteller 
anyhow 
self-confirming; 
their 
congenital 
lack 
of 
information 
forbids 
them 
to 
be 
true 
or 
false. 
In 
two 
words. 
The 
alethic 
value 
of 
a 
proposition 
does 
not 
depend 
only 
on 
the 
same 
proposition, 
since 
it 
concerns 
a 
link 
between 
such 
a 
proposition 
and 
its 
homologous 
cognition. 
Therefore 
an 
alethic 
predicate 
can 
be 
properly 
ascribed 
to 
a 
proposition 
iff 
the 
homologous 
cognition 
is 
non-
preposterously 
attainable. 



12. 
Such 
a 
conclusion, 
generally 
speaking, 
shows 
that 
to 
ground 
an 
apagoge 
(a 
reductio 
ad 
absurdum) 
on 
a 
defective 
dilemma 
is 
a 
totally 
spurious 
argument. 
In 
fact 
if 
|h|k? 


is 
a 
defective 
dilemma, 
deriving 
Tk(~h) 
from 


~Tk(h) 


is 
a 
quite 
abusive 
inference 
because, 
just 
owing 
to 
the 
defectivity 
of 
the 
dilemma, 
neither 
h 
nor 


~h 
can 
be 
k-true. 


12.1. 
The 
clear 
and 
sound 
assimilation 
of 
the 
above 
evidence 
entails 
that 
Cantor’s 
celebrated 
proof 
is 
not 
at 
all 
a 
proof. 
His 
argument 
can 
be 
sketched 
as 
follows. 
Let 
m 
be 
a 
numerable 
set 


and 
Pm 
its 
power 
set, 
that 
is 
the 
set 
of 
its 
subsets. 
A 
one 
to 
one 
correspondence 
k 
between 
the 


members 
x 
of 
m 
and 
the 
members 
y 
of 
Pm 
cannot 
exist. 
In 
fact 
should 
it 
exist, 
then 
a 
b 
and 
a 
c 


would 
exist 
such 
that 
kb=c 
= 
{x: 
xÏk(4.x)} 
and 
the 
dilemma 


bÎc? 


would 
lead 
to 
a 
contradiction. 


The 
analogies 
with 
Richard’s 
paradox 
are 
more 
than 
evident 
(c 
is 
an 
indexical 
set 
and 
an 
indexical 
dilemma 
becomes 
decidable 
only 
after 
its 
conversion 
into 
an 
absolute 
one 
et 
cetera). 
The 
preposterousness 
too 
is 
manifest: 
in 
order 
to 
decide 
whether 
b 
does 
belong 
to 
c 
(so 
getting 


an 
effective 
conversion 
of 
the 
free 
reflexive 
variable) 
we 
should 
previously 
know 
whether 
b 


does 
or 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
c. 
So, 
once 
more, 
we 
have 
to 
remark 
that 
the 
worst 
logical 
puzzles 
ensue 
from 
the 
misrecognized 
presence 
of 
a 
free 
reflexive 
variable. 


12.1.1. 
This 
confutation, 
of 
course, 
does 
not 
show 
that 
Cantor’s 
theorem 
is 
misleading; 
it 
only 
shows 
that 
his 
claim 
is 
a 
simple 
proposal, 
thus 
offering 
a 
theoretical 
support 
to 
the 
opinion 
of 
some 
scholars 
who 
reject 
Cantor’s 
whole 
theory 
of 
transfinites 
on 
mere 
humoral 
bases. 
12.2. 
A 
similar 
situation 
concerns 
Cantor’s 
lemma 
of 
diagonalization 
(Shoenfield 
1967, 
§6.8). 
It 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
conclusion 
that 
no 
indexical 
predicate 
is 
absolute. 
What 
is 
wrong 
in 
a 
definition 
like 
Q(4.x) 
↔~Px(4.x) 


that 
is 
like 
(4.xxxv) 
Q(4.x) 
↔~Ps(4.x) 
is 
the 
abusive 
elimination 
in 
“Q” 
of 
the 
free 
variable 
occurring 
in 
“Ps”. 
And 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
realize 
that 
the 
formally 
correct 
definition 
ought 
to 
be 
something 
like 
(4.xxxvi) 
Qs(4.x) 
↔~Ps(4.x) 


we 
realize 
that 
the 
only 
(and 
highly 
questionable) 
way 
to 
defend 
(4.xxxv) 
is 
to 
agree 
that 
an 
“s” 


is 
elliptically 
included 
in 
“Q” 
(as 
for 
instance 
a 
“self” 
is 
elliptically 
included 
in 
“heterologic”); 



but 
under 
this 
agreement 
“Q” 
becomes 
a 
predicative 
variable 
which, 
obviously, 
cannot 
be 


identified 
with 
any 
absolute 
predicate 
“Pb” 
(with 
reference 
to 
the 
example 
of 
Chapter 
16 
§6, 
b 
would 
be 
the 
exact 
homologous 
of 
Utopolis). 
In 
other 
words, 
if 
we 
start 
from 
the 
correct 
(4.xxxvi), 
no 
conversion 
can 
lead 
to 


Qs(4.x) 
↔~Pb(4.x) 
because 
the 
substitution 
of 
“b” 
to 
“s” 
must 
involve 
the 
reflexive 
variable 
at 
the 
first 
member, 
too; 
the 
right 
substitution 
leads 
to 


Qb(4.x) 
↔~Pb(4.x) 


where 
Qb 
is 
precisely 
the 
absolute 
predicate 
corresponding 
to 
that 
conversion 
of 
the 
indexical 
one. 
And 
as 
far 
as 
I 
know, 
no 
contradiction 
is 
derivable 
from 
(4.xxxvi). 


13. 
Another 
simple 
application 
of 
the 
distinction 
between 
indexical 
and 
absolute 
predicates 
concerns 
Thomson's 
Little 
Theorem 
(Butler 
1962, 
p.94). 
It 
claims 
that, 
if 
r 
is 
a 
relation 
defined 
on 
a 
set 
m, 
no 
member 
x 
of 
m 
can 
be 
in 
r–relation 
with 
all 
the 
m-members 
y 
which 
are 
not 
in 
r–relation 
with 
themselves. 
But 
once 
we 
symbolize 
the 
theorem 
in 
~$x(4.xÎm&"yÎm(r(4.x,y) 
« 
~r(y,y))) 


it 
is 
immediately 
evident 
that 
supposing 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
q 
such 
that 


r(y,q) 
« 
~r(y,s) 


is 
identifying 
the 
indexical 
predicate 


~r(s) 


with 
an 
absolute 
predicate 


r(q) 
(here 
too 
I 
could 
evoke 
Utopolis). 
And 
here 
too 
I 
could 
underline 
that 
the 
occurrence 
of 
“~” 
is 
of 
no 
theoretical 
moment, 
because 
also 


r(s) 
« 
r(q) 


is 
an 
illegitimate 
assumption 
(a 
Thomson’s 
Little 
Counter-theorem 
is 
not 
less 
valid, 
although 
its 
violation 
does 
not 
lead 
to 
any 
direct 
formal 
contradiction). 


14. 
A 
further 
step. 
Generally 
speaking, 
an 
assumption 
like 
(4.xxxvii) 
$x"y(4.xey« 
Fx) 
is 
misleading 
if 
the 
only 
condition 
for 
the 
particularizations 
of 
Fx 
(just 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
that 
“y” 
be 
abusively 
bound) 
is 
that 
the 
same 
“y” 
cannot 
occur 
free 
in 
F 
(without 
inverted 
commas, 
I 
am 
speaking 
of 
an 
object 
predicative 
expression, 
that 
is 
of 
the 
concatenation 
of 
object 
symbols 
named 
by 
“F”). 
In 
fact 
under 
that 
only 
condition 
no 
distinction 
is 
possible 
between 
absolute 
predicates, 
where 
no 
free 
variable 
occurs, 
and 
indexical 
(reflexive) 
predicates 
where 
a 
“x”, 
(that 
is 
a 
“s”) 
occurs. 
But 
(4.xxxvii) 
is 
exactly 
the 
axiomatic 
scheme 
of 
abstraction 
the 
current 
set 
theories 
are 
grounded 
on. 
May 
it 
be 
a 
mere 
casualty 
that 
all 
the 
formal 
contortions 
the 
set 
theorists 
are 
constrained 
to 
adopt 
with 
a 
view 



to 
avoiding 
contradictions 
are 
born 
by 
indexical 
predicates, 
or 
better 
by 
the 
mentioned 
lacking 
distinction? 


15. 
Hoping 
that 
a 
surrealistic 
joke 
is 
welcome 
(or 
at 
least 
tolerated) 
I 
take 
advantage 
of 
a 
defective 
apagoge 
to 
prove 
what 
I 
modestly 
call 
“Gandolfi’s 
Great 
Theorem”: 
it 
simply 
states 
that 
our 
universe 
is 
incoherent. 
Here 
is 
the 
proof. 
Let 
me 
consider 
the 
ordered 
couples 
of 
natural 
numbers. 
On 
the 
one 
hand, 
as 
the 
simple 
tabulation 


á0,0ñ 
á0,1ñ 
á0,2ñ 
á0,3ñ 
á0,4ñ 
á....ñ 


á1,0ñ 
á1,1ñ 
á1,2ñ 
á1,3ñ 
á....ñ 


á2,0ñ 
á2,1ñ 
á2,2ñ 
á....ñ 


á3,0ñ 
á3,1ñ 
á....ñ 
is 
diagonally 
exhaustible 
(firstly 
the 
only 
couple 
whose 
sum 
is 
zero, 
secondly 
the 
two 
couples 
whose 
sum 
is 
1, 
thirdly 
the 
three 
couples 
whose 
sum 
is 
2 
and 
so 
on), 
such 
couples 
must 
be 
numerable. 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
since 
they 
are 
numerable, 
we 
can 
establish 
a 
one 
to 
one 
correspondence 
q 
between 
them 
and 
the 
binary 
numerical 
relations 
definable 
in 
English, 
which 
surely 
are 
numerable. 
Thus, 
as 


the 
members 
of 
an 
ordered 
couple 
are 
linked 
by 
the 
Gandolfian 
relation 
GN 


iff 
they 
are 
not 
linked 
by 
the 
relation 
q-corresponding 
to 
the 
same 
couple 


is 
one 
of 
such 
definitions, 
there 
is 
a 
couple 
áx°,y°ñ 
such 
that 
GN=qáx°,y°ñ. 
And 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
consider 


(4.xxxviii) 
GNáx°,y°ñ 
we 
fall 
into 
a 
contradiction. 
Here 
too 
the 
impasse 
follows 
from 
a 
reductio 
ad 
absurdum 
focused 
on 
an 
inconvertible 
indexical 


dilemma 
(“the 
relation 
q-corresponding 
to 
the 
same 
couple”). 
And 
the 
real 
target 
of 
so 
irreverent 
a 


Great 
Theorem 
is 
just 
to 
emphasize 
the 
essential 
presupposition 
which 
every 
sound 
reductio 
is 
grounded 
on, 
that 
is 
the 
non-defectivity 
of 
the 
respective 
dilemma. 
In 
other 
words, 
(4.xxxviii) 
is 
a 


misleading 
notation 
since 
GN 
is 
an 
indexical 
relation, 
and 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
indicate 
it 
by 
“GNs 
” 
we 
realize 
that 
an 
auto-conversion 
is 
a 
pseudo-promotion 
to 
absoluteness, 
because 
it 
leads 
to 
an 
expression 
where 
the 
reflexive 
variable 
continues 
occurring.
