About 
Aristotle: 


Aristotle 
(384 
BC 
– 
322 
BC) 
was 
a 
Greek 
philosopher, 
a 
student 
of 
Plato 
and 
teacher 
of 
Alexander 
the 
Great. 
His 
writings 
cover 
many 
subjects, 
including 
physics, 
metaphysics, 
poetry, 
theater, 
music, 
logic, 
rhetoric, 
politics, 
government, 
ethics, 
biology, 
and 
zoology. 
Together 
with 
Plato 
and 
Socrates 
(Plato's 
teacher), 
Aristotle 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
founding 
figures 
in 
Western 
philosophy. 
Aristotle's 
writings 
constitute 
a 
first 
at 
creating 
a 
comprehensive 
system 
of 
Western 
philosophy, 
encompassing 
morality 
and 
aesthetics, 
logic 
and 
science, 
politics 
and 
metaphysics. 
Aristotle's 
views 
on 
the 
physical 
sciences 
profoundly 
shaped 
medieval 
scholarship, 
and 
their 
influence 
extended 
well 
into 
the 
Renaissance, 
although 
they 
were 
ultimately 
replaced 
by 
Newtonian 
physics. 
In 
the 
biological 
sciences, 
some 
of 
his 
observations 
were 
confirmed 
to 
be 
accurate 
only 
in 
the 
nineteenth 
century. 
His 
works 
contain 
the 
earliest 
known 
formal 
study 
of 
logic, 
which 
was 
incorporated 
in 
the 
late 
nineteenth 
century 
into 
modern 
formal 
logic. 
In 
metaphysics, 
Aristotelianism 
had 
a 
profound 
influence 
on 
philosophical 
and 
theological 
thinking 
in 
the 
Islamic 
and 
Jewish 
traditions 
in 
the 
Middle 
Ages, 
and 
it 
continues 
to 
influence 
Christian 
theology, 
especially 
Eastern 
Orthodox 
theology, 
and 
the 
scholastic 
tradition 
of 
the 
Catholic 
Church. 
His 
ethics, 
though 
always 
influential, 
gained 
renewed 
interest 
with 
the 
modern 
advent 
of 
virtue 
ethics. 
All 
aspects 
of 
Aristotle's 
philosophy 
continue 
to 
be 
the 
object 
of 
active 
academic 
study 
today. 
Though 
Aristotle 
wrote 
many 
elegant 
treatises 
and 
dialogues 
(Cicero 
described 
his 
literary 
style 
as 
"a 
river 
of 
gold"), 
it 
is 
thought 
that 
the 
majority 
of 
his 
writings 
are 
now 
lost 
and 
only 
about 
one-third 
of 
the 
original 
works 
have 
survived. 
Despite 
the 
far-reaching 
appeal 
that 
Aristotle's 
works 
have 
traditionally 
enjoyed, 
today 
modern 
scholarship 
questions 
a 
substantial 
portion 
of 
the 
Aristotelian 
corpus 
as 
authentically 
Aristotle's 
own.

Things 
are 
said 
to 
be 
named 
‘equivocally’ 
when, 
though 
they 
have 
a 
common 
name, 
the 
definition 
corresponding 
with 
the 
name 
differs 
for 
each. 
Thus, 
a 
real 
man 
and 
a 
figure 
in 
a 
picture 
can 
both 
lay 
claim 
to 
the 
name 
‘animal’; 
yet 
these 
are 
equivocally 
so 
named, 
for, 
though 
they 
have 
a 
common 
name, 
the 
definition 
corresponding 
with 
the 
name 
differs 
for 
each. 
For 
should 
any 
one 
define 
in 
what 
sense 
each 
is 
an 
animal, 
his 
definition 
in 
the 
one 
case 
will 
be 
appropriate 
to 
that 
case 
only. 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
things 
are 
said 
to 
be 
named 
‘univocally’ 
which 
have 
both 
the 
name 
and 
the 
definition 
answering 
to 
the 
name 
in 
common. 
A 
man 
and 
an 
ox 
are 
both 
‘animal’, 
and 
these 
are 
univocally 
so 
named, 
inasmuch 
as 
not 
only 
the 
name, 
but 
also 
the 
definition, 
is 
the 
same 
in 
both 
cases: 
for 
if 
a 
man 
should 
state 
in 
what 
sense 
each 
is 
an 
animal, 
the 
statement 
in 
the 
one 
case 
would 
be 
identical 
with 
that 
in 
the 
other. 


Things 
are 
said 
to 
be 
named 
‘derivatively’, 
which 
derive 
their 
name 
from 
some 
other 
name, 
but 
differ 
from 
it 
in 
termination. 
Thus 
the 
grammarian 
derives 
his 
name 
from 
the 
word 
‘grammar’, 
and 
the 
courageous 
man 
from 
the 
word 
‘courage’. 


2 


Forms 
of 
speech 
are 
either 
simple 
or 
composite. 
Examples 
of 
the 
latter 
are 
such 
expressions 
as 
‘the 
man 
runs’, 
‘the 
man 
wins’; 
of 
the 
former 
‘man’, 
‘ox’, 
‘runs’, 
‘wins’. 


Of 
things 
themselves 
some 
are 
predicable 
of 
a 
subject, 
and 
are 
never 
present 
in 
a 
subject. 
Thus 
‘man’ 
is 
predicable 
of 
the 
individual 
man, 
and 
is 
never 
present 
in 
a 
subject. 


By 
being 
‘present 
in 
a 
subject’ 
I 
do 
not 
mean 
present 
as 
parts 
are 
present 
in 
a 
whole, 
but 
being 
incapable 
of 
existence 
apart 
from 
the 
said 
subject. 


Some 
things, 
again, 
are 
present 
in 
a 
subject, 
but 
are 
never 
predicable 
of 
a 



subject. 
For 
instance, 
a 
certain 
point 
of 
grammatical 
knowledge 
is 
present 
in 
the 
mind, 
but 
is 
not 
predicable 
of 
any 
subject; 
or 
again, 
a 
certain 
whiteness 
may 
be 
present 
in 
the 
body 
(for 
colour 
requires 
a 
material 
basis), 
yet 
it 
is 
never 
predicable 
of 
anything. 


Other 
things, 
again, 
are 
both 
predicable 
of 
a 
subject 
and 
present 
in 
a 
subject. 
Thus 
while 
knowledge 
is 
present 
in 
the 
human 
mind, 
it 
is 
predicable 
of 
grammar. 


There 
is, 
lastly, 
a 
class 
of 
things 
which 
are 
neither 
present 
in 
a 
subject 
nor 
predicable 
of 
a 
subject, 
such 
as 
the 
individual 
man 
or 
the 
individual 
horse. 
But, 
to 
speak 
more 
generally, 
that 
which 
is 
individual 
and 
has 
the 
character 
of 
a 
unit 
is 
never 
predicable 
of 
a 
subject. 
Yet 
in 
some 
cases 
there 
is 
nothing 
to 
prevent 
such 
being 
present 
in 
a 
subject. 
Thus 
a 
certain 
point 
of 
grammatical 
knowledge 
is 
present 
in 
a 
subject. 


3 


When 
one 
thing 
is 
predicated 
of 
another, 
all 
that 
which 
is 
predicable 
of 
the 
predicate 
will 
be 
predicable 
also 
of 
the 
subject. 
Thus, 
‘man’ 
is 
predicated 
of 
the 
individual 
man; 
but 
‘animal’ 
is 
predicated 
of 
‘man’; 
it 
will, 
therefore, 
be 
predicable 
of 
the 
individual 
man 
also: 
for 
the 
individual 
man 
is 
both 
‘man’ 
and 
‘animal’. 


If 
genera 
are 
different 
and 
co-ordinate, 
their 
differentiae 
are 
themselves 
different 
in 
kind. 
Take 
as 
an 
instance 
the 
genus 
‘animal’ 
and 
the 
genus 
‘knowledge’. 
‘With 
feet’, 
‘two-footed’, 
‘winged’, 
‘aquatic’, 
are 
differentiae 
of 
‘animal’; 
the 
species 
of 
knowledge 
are 
not 
distinguished 
by 
the 
same 
differentiae. 
One 
species 
of 
knowledge 
does 
not 
differ 
from 
another 
in 
being 
‘two-footed’. 


But 
where 
one 
genus 
is 
subordinate 
to 
another, 
there 
is 
nothing 
to 
prevent 
their 
having 
the 
same 
differentiae: 
for 
the 
greater 
class 
is 
predicated 
of 
the 
lesser, 
so 
that 
all 
the 
differentiae 
of 
the 
predicate 
will 
be 
differentiae 
also 
of 
the 
subject. 


4 


Expressions 
which 
are 
in 
no 
way 
composite 
signify 
substance, 
quantity, 
quality, 
relation, 
place, 
time, 
position, 
state, 
action, 
or 
affection. 
To 
sketch 



my 
meaning 
roughly, 
examples 
of 
substance 
are 
‘man’ 
or 
‘the 
horse’, 
of 
quantity, 
such 
terms 
as 
‘two 
cubits 
long’ 
or 
‘three 
cubits 
long’, 
of 
quality, 
such 
attributes 
as 
‘white’, 
‘grammatical’. 
‘Double’, 
‘half’, 
‘greater’, 
fall 
under 
the 
category 
of 
relation; 
‘in 
a 
the 
market 
place’, 
‘in 
the 
Lyceum’, 
under 
that 
of 
place; 
‘yesterday’, 
‘last 
year’, 
under 
that 
of 
time. 
‘Lying’, 
‘sitting’, 
are 
terms 
indicating 
position, 
‘shod’, 
‘armed’, 
state; 
‘to 
lance’, 
‘to 
cauterize’, 
action; 
‘to 
be 
lanced’, 
‘to 
be 
cauterized’, 
affection. 


No 
one 
of 
these 
terms, 
in 
and 
by 
itself, 
involves 
an 
affirmation; 
it 
is 
by 
the 
combination 
of 
such 
terms 
that 
positive 
or 
negative 
statements 
arise. 
For 
every 
assertion 
must, 
as 
is 
admitted, 
be 
either 
true 
or 
false, 
whereas 
expressions 
which 
are 
not 
in 
any 
way 
composite 
such 
as 
‘man’, 
‘white’, 
‘runs’, 
‘wins’, 
cannot 
be 
either 
true 
or 
false. 


Substance, 
in 
the 
truest 
and 
primary 
and 
most 
definite 
sense 
of 
the 
word, 
is 
that 
which 
is 
neither 
predicable 
of 
a 
subject 
nor 
present 
in 
a 
subject; 
for 
instance, 
the 
individual 
man 
or 
horse. 
But 
in 
a 
secondary 
sense 
those 
things 
are 
called 
substances 
within 
which, 
as 
species, 
the 
primary 
substances 
are 
included; 
also 
those 
which, 
as 
genera, 
include 
the 
species. 
For 
instance, 
the 
individual 
man 
is 
included 
in 
the 
species 
‘man’, 
and 
the 
genus 
to 
which 
the 
species 
belongs 
is 
‘animal’; 
these, 
therefore-that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
species 
‘man’ 
and 
the 
genus 
‘animal,-are 
termed 
secondary 
substances. 


It 
is 
plain 
from 
what 
has 
been 
said 
that 
both 
the 
name 
and 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
predicate 
must 
be 
predicable 
of 
the 
subject. 
For 
instance, 
‘man’ 
is 
predicted 
of 
the 
individual 
man. 
Now 
in 
this 
case 
the 
name 
of 
the 
species 
man’ 
is 
applied 
to 
the 
individual, 
for 
we 
use 
the 
term 
‘man’ 
in 
describing 
the 
individual; 
and 
the 
definition 
of 
‘man’ 
will 
also 
be 
predicated 
of 
the 
individual 
man, 
for 
the 
individual 
man 
is 
both 
man 
and 
animal. 
Thus, 
both 
the 
name 
and 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
species 
are 
predicable 
of 
the 
individual. 


With 
regard, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
to 
those 
things 
which 
are 
present 
in 
a 
subject, 
it 
is 
generally 
the 
case 
that 
neither 
their 
name 
nor 
their 
definition 
is 
predicable 
of 
that 
in 
which 
they 
are 
present. 
Though, 
however, 
the 
definition 
is 
never 
predicable, 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
certain 
cases 
to 
prevent 
the 
name 
being 
used. 
For 
instance, 
‘white’ 
being 
present 
in 
a 
body 
is 
predicated 
of 
that 
in 
which 
it 
is 
present, 
for 
a 
body 
is 
called 
white: 
the 
definition, 
however, 
of 
the 
colour 
white’ 
is 
never 
predicable 
of 
the 
body. 



Everything 
except 
primary 
substances 
is 
either 
predicable 
of 
a 
primary 
substance 
or 
present 
in 
a 
primary 
substance. 
This 
becomes 
evident 
by 
reference 
to 
particular 
instances 
which 
occur. 
‘Animal’ 
is 
predicated 
of 
the 
species 
‘man’, 
therefore 
of 
the 
individual 
man, 
for 
if 
there 
were 
no 
individual 
man 
of 
whom 
it 
could 
be 
predicated, 
it 
could 
not 
be 
predicated 
of 
the 
species 
‘man’ 
at 
all. 
Again, 
colour 
is 
present 
in 
body, 
therefore 
in 
individual 
bodies, 
for 
if 
there 
were 
no 
individual 
body 
in 
which 
it 
was 
present, 
it 
could 
not 
be 
present 
in 
body 
at 
all. 
Thus 
everything 
except 
primary 
substances 
is 
either 
predicated 
of 
primary 
substances, 
or 
is 
present 
in 
them, 
and 
if 
these 
last 
did 
not 
exist, 
it 
would 
be 
impossible 
for 
anything 
else 
to 
exist. 


Of 
secondary 
substances, 
the 
species 
is 
more 
truly 
substance 
than 
the 
genus, 
being 
more 
nearly 
related 
to 
primary 
substance. 
For 
if 
any 
one 
should 
render 
an 
account 
of 
what 
a 
primary 
substance 
is, 
he 
would 
render 
a 
more 
instructive 
account, 
and 
one 
more 
proper 
to 
the 
subject, 
by 
stating 
the 
species 
than 
by 
stating 
the 
genus. 
Thus, 
he 
would 
give 
a 
more 
instructive 
account 
of 
an 
individual 
man 
by 
stating 
that 
he 
was 
man 
than 
by 
stating 
that 
he 
was 
animal, 
for 
the 
former 
description 
is 
peculiar 
to 
the 
individual 
in 
a 
greater 
degree, 
while 
the 
latter 
is 
too 
general. 
Again, 
the 
man 
who 
gives 
an 
account 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
an 
individual 
tree 
will 
give 
a 
more 
instructive 
account 
by 
mentioning 
the 
species 
‘tree’ 
than 
by 
mentioning 
the 
genus 
‘plant’. 


Moreover, 
primary 
substances 
are 
most 
properly 
called 
substances 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
are 
the 
entities 
which 
underlie 
every. 
else, 
and 
that 
everything 
else 
is 
either 
predicated 
of 
them 
or 
present 
in 
them. 
Now 
the 
same 
relation 
which 
subsists 
between 
primary 
substance 
and 
everything 
else 
subsists 
also 
between 
the 
species 
and 
the 
genus: 
for 
the 
species 
is 
to 
the 
genus 
as 
subject 
is 
to 
predicate, 
since 
the 
genus 
is 
predicated 
of 
the 
species, 
whereas 
the 
species 
cannot 
be 
predicated 
of 
the 
genus. 
Thus 
we 
have 
a 
second 
ground 
for 
asserting 
that 
the 
species 
is 
more 
truly 
substance 
than 
the 
genus. 


Of 
species 
themselves, 
except 
in 
the 
case 
of 
such 
as 
are 
genera, 
no 
one 
is 
more 
truly 
substance 
than 
another. 
We 
should 
not 
give 
a 
more 
appropriate 
account 
of 
the 
individual 
man 
by 
stating 
the 
species 
to 
which 
he 
belonged, 
than 
we 
should 
of 
an 
individual 
horse 
by 
adopting 
the 
same 
method 
of 
definition. 
In 
the 
same 
way, 
of 
primary 
substances, 
no 
one 
is 
more 
truly 
substance 
than 
another; 
an 
individual 
man 
is 
not 
more 
truly 
substance 
than 
an 
individual 
ox. 


It 
is, 
then, 
with 
good 
reason 
that 
of 
all 
that 
remains, 
when 
we 
exclude 



primary 
substances, 
we 
concede 
to 
species 
and 
genera 
alone 
the 
name 
‘secondary 
substance’, 
for 
these 
alone 
of 
all 
the 
predicates 
convey 
a 
knowledge 
of 
primary 
substance. 
For 
it 
is 
by 
stating 
the 
species 
or 
the 
genus 
that 
we 
appropriately 
define 
any 
individual 
man; 
and 
we 
shall 
make 
our 
definition 
more 
exact 
by 
stating 
the 
former 
than 
by 
stating 
the 
latter. 
All 
other 
things 
that 
we 
state, 
such 
as 
that 
he 
is 
white, 
that 
he 
runs, 
and 
so 
on, 
are 
irrelevant 
to 
the 
definition. 
Thus 
it 
is 
just 
that 
these 
alone, 
apart 
from 
primary 
substances, 
should 
be 
called 
substances. 


Further, 
primary 
substances 
are 
most 
properly 
so 
called, 
because 
they 
underlie 
and 
are 
the 
subjects 
of 
everything 
else. 
Now 
the 
same 
relation 
that 
subsists 
between 
primary 
substance 
and 
everything 
else 
subsists 
also 
between 
the 
species 
and 
the 
genus 
to 
which 
the 
primary 
substance 
belongs, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
every 
attribute 
which 
is 
not 
included 
within 
these, 
on 
the 
other. 
For 
these 
are 
the 
subjects 
of 
all 
such. 
If 
we 
call 
an 
individual 
man 
‘skilled 
in 
grammar’, 
the 
predicate 
is 
applicable 
also 
to 
the 
species 
and 
to 
the 
genus 
to 
which 
he 
belongs. 
This 
law 
holds 
good 
in 
all 
cases. 


It 
is 
a 
common 
characteristic 
of 
all 
sub. 
stance 
that 
it 
is 
never 
present 
in 
a 
subject. 
For 
primary 
substance 
is 
neither 
present 
in 
a 
subject 
nor 
predicated 
of 
a 
subject; 
while, 
with 
regard 
to 
secondary 
substances, 
it 
is 
clear 
from 
the 
following 
arguments 
(apart 
from 
others) 
that 
they 
are 
not 
present 
in 
a 
subject. 
For 
‘man’ 
is 
predicated 
of 
the 
individual 
man, 
but 
is 
not 
present 
in 
any 
subject: 
for 
manhood 
is 
not 
present 
in 
the 
individual 
man. 
In 
the 
same 
way, 
‘animal’ 
is 
also 
predicated 
of 
the 
individual 
man, 
but 
is 
not 
present 
in 
him. 
Again, 
when 
a 
thing 
is 
present 
in 
a 
subject, 
though 
the 
name 
may 
quite 
well 
be 
applied 
to 
that 
in 
which 
it 
is 
present, 
the 
definition 
cannot 
be 
applied. 
Yet 
of 
secondary 
substances, 
not 
only 
the 
name, 
but 
also 
the 
definition, 
applies 
to 
the 
subject: 
we 
should 
use 
both 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
species 
and 
that 
of 
the 
genus 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
individual 
man. 
Thus 
substance 
cannot 
be 
present 
in 
a 
subject. 


Yet 
this 
is 
not 
peculiar 
to 
substance, 
for 
it 
is 
also 
the 
case 
that 
differentiae 
cannot 
be 
present 
in 
subjects. 
The 
characteristics 
‘terrestrial’ 
and 
‘twofooted’ 
are 
predicated 
of 
the 
species 
‘man’, 
but 
not 
present 
in 
it. 
For 
they 
are 
not 
in 
man. 
Moreover, 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
differentia 
may 
be 
predicated 
of 
that 
of 
which 
the 
differentia 
itself 
is 
predicated. 
For 
instance, 
if 
the 
characteristic 
‘terrestrial’ 
is 
predicated 
of 
the 
species 
‘man’, 
the 
definition 
also 
of 
that 
characteristic 
may 
be 
used 
to 
form 
the 
predicate 
of 
the 
species 
‘man’: 
for 
‘man’ 
is 
terrestrial. 



The 
fact 
that 
the 
parts 
of 
substances 
appear 
to 
be 
present 
in 
the 
whole, 
as 
in 
a 
subject, 
should 
not 
make 
us 
apprehensive 
lest 
we 
should 
have 
to 
admit 
that 
such 
parts 
are 
not 
substances: 
for 
in 
explaining 
the 
phrase 
‘being 
present 
in 
a 
subject’, 
we 
stated’ 
that 
we 
meant 
‘otherwise 
than 
as 
parts 
in 
a 
whole’. 


It 
is 
the 
mark 
of 
substances 
and 
of 
differentiae 
that, 
in 
all 
propositions 
of 
which 
they 
form 
the 
predicate, 
they 
are 
predicated 
univocally. 
For 
all 
such 
propositions 
have 
for 
their 
subject 
either 
the 
individual 
or 
the 
species. 
It 
is 
true 
that, 
inasmuch 
as 
primary 
substance 
is 
not 
predicable 
of 
anything, 
it 
can 
never 
form 
the 
predicate 
of 
any 
proposition. 
But 
of 
secondary 
substances, 
the 
species 
is 
predicated 
of 
the 
individual, 
the 
genus 
both 
of 
the 
species 
and 
of 
the 
individual. 
Similarly 
the 
differentiae 
are 
predicated 
of 
the 
species 
and 
of 
the 
individuals. 
Moreover, 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
species 
and 
that 
of 
the 
genus 
are 
applicable 
to 
the 
primary 
substance, 
and 
that 
of 
the 
genus 
to 
the 
species. 
For 
all 
that 
is 
predicated 
of 
the 
predicate 
will 
be 
predicated 
also 
of 
the 
subject. 
Similarly, 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
differentiae 
will 
be 
applicable 
to 
the 
species 
and 
to 
the 
individuals. 
But 
it 
was 
stated 
above 
that 
the 
word 
‘univocal’ 
was 
applied 
to 
those 
things 
which 
had 
both 
name 
and 
definition 
in 
common. 
It 
is, 
therefore, 
established 
that 
in 
every 
proposition, 
of 
which 
either 
substance 
or 
a 
differentia 
forms 
the 
predicate, 
these 
are 
predicated 
univocally. 


All 
substance 
appears 
to 
signify 
that 
which 
is 
individual. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
primary 
substance 
this 
is 
indisputably 
true, 
for 
the 
thing 
is 
a 
unit. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
secondary 
substances, 
when 
we 
speak, 
for 
instance, 
of 
‘man’ 
or 
‘animal’, 
our 
form 
of 
speech 
gives 
the 
impression 
that 
we 
are 
here 
also 
indicating 
that 
which 
is 
individual, 
but 
the 
impression 
is 
not 
strictly 
true; 
for 
a 
secondary 
substance 
is 
not 
an 
individual, 
but 
a 
class 
with 
a 
certain 
qualification; 
for 
it 
is 
not 
one 
and 
single 
as 
a 
primary 
substance 
is; 
the 
words 
‘man’, 
‘animal’, 
are 
predicable 
of 
more 
than 
one 
subject. 


Yet 
species 
and 
genus 
do 
not 
merely 
indicate 
quality, 
like 
the 
term 
‘white’; 
‘white’ 
indicates 
quality 
and 
nothing 
further, 
but 
species 
and 
genus 
determine 
the 
quality 
with 
reference 
to 
a 
substance: 
they 
signify 
substance 
qualitatively 
differentiated. 
The 
determinate 
qualification 
covers 
a 
larger 
field 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
genus 
that 
in 
that 
of 
the 
species: 
he 
who 
uses 
the 
word 
‘animal’ 
is 
herein 
using 
a 
word 
of 
wider 
extension 
than 
he 
who 
uses 
the 
word 
‘man’. 


Another 
mark 
of 
substance 
is 
that 
it 
has 
no 
contrary. 
What 
could 
be 
the 
contrary 
of 
any 
primary 
substance, 
such 
as 
the 
individual 
man 
or 
animal? 
It 
has 
none. 
Nor 
can 
the 
species 
or 
the 
genus 
have 
a 
contrary. 
Yet 
this 
characteristic 
is 
not 
peculiar 
to 
substance, 
but 
is 
true 
of 
many 
other 
things, 



such 
as 
quantity. 
There 
is 
nothing 
that 
forms 
the 
contrary 
of 
‘two 
cubits 
long’ 
or 
of 
‘three 
cubits 
long’, 
or 
of 
‘ten’, 
or 
of 
any 
such 
term. 
A 
man 
may 
contend 
that 
‘much’ 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
‘little’, 
or 
‘great’ 
of 
‘small’, 
but 
of 
definite 
quantitative 
terms 
no 
contrary 
exists. 


Substance, 
again, 
does 
not 
appear 
to 
admit 
of 
variation 
of 
degree. 
I 
do 
not 
mean 
by 
this 
that 
one 
substance 
cannot 
be 
more 
or 
less 
truly 
substance 
than 
another, 
for 
it 
has 
already 
been 
stated’ 
that 
this 
is 
the 
case; 
but 
that 
no 
single 
substance 
admits 
of 
varying 
degrees 
within 
itself. 
For 
instance, 
one 
particular 
substance, 
‘man’, 
cannot 
be 
more 
or 
less 
man 
either 
than 
himself 
at 
some 
other 
time 
or 
than 
some 
other 
man. 
One 
man 
cannot 
be 
more 
man 
than 
another, 
as 
that 
which 
is 
white 
may 
be 
more 
or 
less 
white 
than 
some 
other 
white 
object, 
or 
as 
that 
which 
is 
beautiful 
may 
be 
more 
or 
less 
beautiful 
than 
some 
other 
beautiful 
object. 
The 
same 
quality, 
moreover, 
is 
said 
to 
subsist 
in 
a 
thing 
in 
varying 
degrees 
at 
different 
times. 
A 
body, 
being 
white, 
is 
said 
to 
be 
whiter 
at 
one 
time 
than 
it 
was 
before, 
or, 
being 
warm, 
is 
said 
to 
be 
warmer 
or 
less 
warm 
than 
at 
some 
other 
time. 
But 
substance 
is 
not 
said 
to 
be 
more 
or 
less 
that 
which 
it 
is: 
a 
man 
is 
not 
more 
truly 
a 
man 
at 
one 
time 
than 
he 
was 
before, 
nor 
is 
anything, 
if 
it 
is 
substance, 
more 
or 
less 
what 
it 
is. 
Substance, 
then, 
does 
not 
admit 
of 
variation 
of 
degree. 


The 
most 
distinctive 
mark 
of 
substance 
appears 
to 
be 
that, 
while 
remaining 
numerically 
one 
and 
the 
same, 
it 
is 
capable 
of 
admitting 
contrary 
qualities. 
From 
among 
things 
other 
than 
substance, 
we 
should 
find 
ourselves 
unable 
to 
bring 
forward 
any 
which 
possessed 
this 
mark. 
Thus, 
one 
and 
the 
same 
colour 
cannot 
be 
white 
and 
black. 
Nor 
can 
the 
same 
one 
action 
be 
good 
and 
bad: 
this 
law 
holds 
good 
with 
everything 
that 
is 
not 
substance. 
But 
one 
and 
the 
selfsame 
substance, 
while 
retaining 
its 
identity, 
is 
yet 
capable 
of 
admitting 
contrary 
qualities. 
The 
same 
individual 
person 
is 
at 
one 
time 
white, 
at 
another 
black, 
at 
one 
time 
warm, 
at 
another 
cold, 
at 
one 
time 
good, 
at 
another 
bad. 
This 
capacity 
is 
found 
nowhere 
else, 
though 
it 
might 
be 
maintained 
that 
a 
statement 
or 
opinion 
was 
an 
exception 
to 
the 
rule. 
The 
same 
statement, 
it 
is 
agreed, 
can 
be 
both 
true 
and 
false. 
For 
if 
the 
statement 
‘he 
is 
sitting’ 
is 
true, 
yet, 
when 
the 
person 
in 
question 
has 
risen, 
the 
same 
statement 
will 
be 
false. 
The 
same 
applies 
to 
opinions. 
For 
if 
any 
one 
thinks 
truly 
that 
a 
person 
is 
sitting, 
yet, 
when 
that 
person 
has 
risen, 
this 
same 
opinion, 
if 
still 
held, 
will 
be 
false. 
Yet 
although 
this 
exception 
may 
be 
allowed, 
there 
is, 
nevertheless, 
a 
difference 
in 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
the 
thing 
takes 
place. 
It 
is 
by 
themselves 
changing 
that 
substances 
admit 
contrary 
qualities. 
It 
is 
thus 
that 
that 
which 



was 
hot 
becomes 
cold, 
for 
it 
has 
entered 
into 
a 
different 
state. 
Similarly 
that 
which 
was 
white 
becomes 
black, 
and 
that 
which 
was 
bad 
good, 
by 
a 
process 
of 
change; 
and 
in 
the 
same 
way 
in 
all 
other 
cases 
it 
is 
by 
changing 
that 
substances 
are 
capable 
of 
admitting 
contrary 
qualities. 
But 
statements 
and 
opinions 
themselves 
remain 
unaltered 
in 
all 
respects: 
it 
is 
by 
the 
alteration 
in 
the 
facts 
of 
the 
case 
that 
the 
contrary 
quality 
comes 
to 
be 
theirs. 
The 
statement 
‘he 
is 
sitting’ 
remains 
unaltered, 
but 
it 
is 
at 
one 
time 
true, 
at 
another 
false, 
according 
to 
circumstances. 
What 
has 
been 
said 
of 
statements 
applies 
also 
to 
opinions. 
Thus, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
the 
thing 
takes 
place, 
it 
is 
the 
peculiar 
mark 
of 
substance 
that 
it 
should 
be 
capable 
of 
admitting 
contrary 
qualities; 
for 
it 
is 
by 
itself 
changing 
that 
it 
does 
so. 


If, 
then, 
a 
man 
should 
make 
this 
exception 
and 
contend 
that 
statements 
and 
opinions 
are 
capable 
of 
admitting 
contrary 
qualities, 
his 
contention 
is 
unsound. 
For 
statements 
and 
opinions 
are 
said 
to 
have 
this 
capacity, 
not 
because 
they 
themselves 
undergo 
modification, 
but 
because 
this 
modification 
occurs 
in 
the 
case 
of 
something 
else. 
The 
truth 
or 
falsity 
of 
a 
statement 
depends 
on 
facts, 
and 
not 
on 
any 
power 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
statement 
itself 
of 
admitting 
contrary 
qualities. 
In 
short, 
there 
is 
nothing 
which 
can 
alter 
the 
nature 
of 
statements 
and 
opinions. 
As, 
then, 
no 
change 
takes 
place 
in 
themselves, 
these 
cannot 
be 
said 
to 
be 
capable 
of 
admitting 
contrary 
qualities. 


But 
it 
is 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
modification 
which 
takes 
place 
within 
the 
substance 
itself 
that 
a 
substance 
is 
said 
to 
be 
capable 
of 
admitting 
contrary 
qualities; 
for 
a 
substance 
admits 
within 
itself 
either 
disease 
or 
health, 
whiteness 
or 
blackness. 
It 
is 
in 
this 
sense 
that 
it 
is 
said 
to 
be 
capable 
of 
admitting 
contrary 
qualities. 


To 
sum 
up, 
it 
is 
a 
distinctive 
mark 
of 
substance, 
that, 
while 
remaining 
numerically 
one 
and 
the 
same, 
it 
is 
capable 
of 
admitting 
contrary 
qualities, 
the 
modification 
taking 
place 
through 
a 
change 
in 
the 
substance 
itself. 


Let 
these 
remarks 
suffice 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
substance. 


Quantity 
is 
either 
discrete 
or 
continuous. 
Moreover, 
some 
quantities 
are 
such 
that 
each 
part 
of 
the 
whole 
has 
a 
relative 
position 
to 
the 
other 
parts: 
others 
have 
within 
them 
no 
such 
relation 
of 
part 
to 
part. 


Instances 
of 
discrete 
quantities 
are 
number 
and 
speech; 
of 
continuous, 
lines, 
surfaces, 
solids, 
and, 
besides 
these, 
time 
and 
place. 



In 
the 
case 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
a 
number, 
there 
is 
no 
common 
boundary 
at 
which 
they 
join. 
For 
example: 
two 
fives 
make 
ten, 
but 
the 
two 
fives 
have 
no 
common 
boundary, 
but 
are 
separate; 
the 
parts 
three 
and 
seven 
also 
do 
not 
join 
at 
any 
boundary. 
Nor, 
to 
generalize, 
would 
it 
ever 
be 
possible 
in 
the 
case 
of 
number 
that 
there 
should 
be 
a 
common 
boundary 
among 
the 
parts; 
they 
are 
always 
separate. 
Number, 
therefore, 
is 
a 
discrete 
quantity. 


The 
same 
is 
true 
of 
speech. 
That 
speech 
is 
a 
quantity 
is 
evident: 
for 
it 
is 
measured 
in 
long 
and 
short 
syllables. 
I 
mean 
here 
that 
speech 
which 
is 
vocal. 
Moreover, 
it 
is 
a 
discrete 
quantity 
for 
its 
parts 
have 
no 
common 
boundary. 
There 
is 
no 
common 
boundary 
at 
which 
the 
syllables 
join, 
but 
each 
is 
separate 
and 
distinct 
from 
the 
rest. 


A 
line, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
is 
a 
continuous 
quantity, 
for 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
find 
a 
common 
boundary 
at 
which 
its 
parts 
join. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
the 
line, 
this 
common 
boundary 
is 
the 
point; 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
plane, 
it 
is 
the 
line: 
for 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
plane 
have 
also 
a 
common 
boundary. 
Similarly 
you 
can 
find 
a 
common 
boundary 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
a 
solid, 
namely 
either 
a 
line 
or 
a 
plane. 


Space 
and 
time 
also 
belong 
to 
this 
class 
of 
quantities. 
Time, 
past, 
present, 
and 
future, 
forms 
a 
continuous 
whole. 
Space, 
likewise, 
is 
a 
continuous 
quantity; 
for 
the 
parts 
of 
a 
solid 
occupy 
a 
certain 
space, 
and 
these 
have 
a 
common 
boundary; 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
parts 
of 
space 
also, 
which 
are 
occupied 
by 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
solid, 
have 
the 
same 
common 
boundary 
as 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
solid. 
Thus, 
not 
only 
time, 
but 
space 
also, 
is 
a 
continuous 
quantity, 
for 
its 
parts 
have 
a 
common 
boundary. 


Quantities 
consist 
either 
of 
parts 
which 
bear 
a 
relative 
position 
each 
to 
each, 
or 
of 
parts 
which 
do 
not. 
The 
parts 
of 
a 
line 
bear 
a 
relative 
position 
to 
each 
other, 
for 
each 
lies 
somewhere, 
and 
it 
would 
be 
possible 
to 
distinguish 
each, 
and 
to 
state 
the 
position 
of 
each 
on 
the 
plane 
and 
to 
explain 
to 
what 
sort 
of 
part 
among 
the 
rest 
each 
was 
contiguous. 
Similarly 
the 
parts 
of 
a 
plane 
have 
position, 
for 
it 
could 
similarly 
be 
stated 
what 
was 
the 
position 
of 
each 
and 
what 
sort 
of 
parts 
were 
contiguous. 
The 
same 
is 
true 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
solid 
and 
to 
space. 
But 
it 
would 
be 
impossible 
to 
show 
that 
the 
arts 
of 
a 
number 
had 
a 
relative 
position 
each 
to 
each, 
or 
a 
particular 
position, 
or 
to 
state 
what 
parts 
were 
contiguous. 
Nor 
could 
this 
be 
done 
in 
the 
case 
of 
time, 
for 
none 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
time 
has 
an 
abiding 
existence, 
and 
that 
which 
does 
not 
abide 
can 
hardly 
have 
position. 
It 
would 
be 
better 
to 
say 
that 
such 
parts 
had 
a 
relative 
order, 
in 
virtue 
of 
one 
being 
prior 
to 
another. 
Similarly 
with 



number: 
in 
counting, 
‘one’ 
is 
prior 
to 
‘two’, 
and 
‘two’ 
to 
‘three’, 
and 
thus 
the 
parts 
of 
number 
may 
be 
said 
to 
possess 
a 
relative 
order, 
though 
it 
would 
be 
impossible 
to 
discover 
any 
distinct 
position 
for 
each. 
This 
holds 
good 
also 
in 
the 
case 
of 
speech. 
None 
of 
its 
parts 
has 
an 
abiding 
existence: 
when 
once 
a 
syllable 
is 
pronounced, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
retain 
it, 
so 
that, 
naturally, 
as 
the 
parts 
do 
not 
abide, 
they 
cannot 
have 
position. 
Thus, 
some 
quantities 
consist 
of 
parts 
which 
have 
position, 
and 
some 
of 
those 
which 
have 
not. 


Strictly 
speaking, 
only 
the 
things 
which 
I 
have 
mentioned 
belong 
to 
the 
category 
of 
quantity: 
everything 
else 
that 
is 
called 
quantitative 
is 
a 
quantity 
in 
a 
secondary 
sense. 
It 
is 
because 
we 
have 
in 
mind 
some 
one 
of 
these 
quantities, 
properly 
so 
called, 
that 
we 
apply 
quantitative 
terms 
to 
other 
things. 
We 
speak 
of 
what 
is 
white 
as 
large, 
because 
the 
surface 
over 
which 
the 
white 
extends 
is 
large; 
we 
speak 
of 
an 
action 
or 
a 
process 
as 
lengthy, 
because 
the 
time 
covered 
is 
long; 
these 
things 
cannot 
in 
their 
own 
right 
claim 
the 
quantitative 
epithet. 
For 
instance, 
should 
any 
one 
explain 
how 
long 
an 
action 
was, 
his 
statement 
would 
be 
made 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
time 
taken, 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
it 
lasted 
a 
year, 
or 
something 
of 
that 
sort. 
In 
the 
same 
way, 
he 
would 
explain 
the 
size 
of 
a 
white 
object 
in 
terms 
of 
surface, 
for 
he 
would 
state 
the 
area 
which 
it 
covered. 
Thus 
the 
things 
already 
mentioned, 
and 
these 
alone, 
are 
in 
their 
intrinsic 
nature 
quantities; 
nothing 
else 
can 
claim 
the 
name 
in 
its 
own 
right, 
but, 
if 
at 
all, 
only 
in 
a 
secondary 
sense. 


Quantities 
have 
no 
contraries. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
definite 
quantities 
this 
is 
obvious; 
thus, 
there 
is 
nothing 
that 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
‘two 
cubits 
long’ 
or 
of 
‘three 
cubits 
long’, 
or 
of 
a 
surface, 
or 
of 
any 
such 
quantities. 
A 
man 
might, 
indeed, 
argue 
that 
‘much’ 
was 
the 
contrary 
of 
‘little’, 
and 
‘great’ 
of 
‘small’. 
But 
these 
are 
not 
quantitative, 
but 
relative; 
things 
are 
not 
great 
or 
small 
absolutely, 
they 
are 
so 
called 
rather 
as 
the 
result 
of 
an 
act 
of 
comparison. 
For 
instance, 
a 
mountain 
is 
called 
small, 
a 
grain 
large, 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
latter 
is 
greater 
than 
others 
of 
its 
kind, 
the 
former 
less. 
Thus 
there 
is 
a 
reference 
here 
to 
an 
external 
standard, 
for 
if 
the 
terms 
‘great’ 
and 
‘small’ 
were 
used 
absolutely, 
a 
mountain 
would 
never 
be 
called 
small 
or 
a 
grain 
large. 
Again, 
we 
say 
that 
there 
are 
many 
people 
in 
a 
village, 
and 
few 
in 
Athens, 
although 
those 
in 
the 
city 
are 
many 
times 
as 
numerous 
as 
those 
in 
the 
village: 
or 
we 
say 
that 
a 
house 
has 
many 
in 
it, 
and 
a 
theatre 
few, 
though 
those 
in 
the 
theatre 
far 
outnumber 
those 
in 
the 
house. 
The 
terms 
‘two 
cubits 
long, 
“three 
cubits 
long,’ 
and 
so 
on 
indicate 
quantity, 
the 
terms 
‘great’ 
and 
‘small’ 
indicate 
relation, 
for 
they 
have 
reference 
to 
an 
external 
standard. 
It 
is, 



therefore, 
plain 
that 
these 
are 
to 
be 
classed 
as 
relative. 


Again, 
whether 
we 
define 
them 
as 
quantitative 
or 
not, 
they 
have 
no 
contraries: 
for 
how 
can 
there 
be 
a 
contrary 
of 
an 
attribute 
which 
is 
not 
to 
be 
apprehended 
in 
or 
by 
itself, 
but 
only 
by 
reference 
to 
something 
external? 
Again, 
if 
‘great’ 
and 
‘small’ 
are 
contraries, 
it 
will 
come 
about 
that 
the 
same 
subject 
can 
admit 
contrary 
qualities 
at 
one 
and 
the 
same 
time, 
and 
that 
things 
will 
themselves 
be 
contrary 
to 
themselves. 
For 
it 
happens 
at 
times 
that 
the 
same 
thing 
is 
both 
small 
and 
great. 
For 
the 
same 
thing 
may 
be 
small 
in 
comparison 
with 
one 
thing, 
and 
great 
in 
comparison 
with 
another, 
so 
that 
the 
same 
thing 
comes 
to 
be 
both 
small 
and 
great 
at 
one 
and 
the 
same 
time, 
and 
is 
of 
such 
a 
nature 
as 
to 
admit 
contrary 
qualities 
at 
one 
and 
the 
same 
moment. 
Yet 
it 
was 
agreed, 
when 
substance 
was 
being 
discussed, 
that 
nothing 
admits 
contrary 
qualities 
at 
one 
and 
the 
same 
moment. 
For 
though 
substance 
is 
capable 
of 
admitting 
contrary 
qualities, 
yet 
no 
one 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
both 
sick 
and 
healthy, 
nothing 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
both 
white 
and 
black. 
Nor 
is 
there 
anything 
which 
is 
qualified 
in 
contrary 
ways 
at 
one 
and 
the 
same 
time. 


Moreover, 
if 
these 
were 
contraries, 
they 
would 
themselves 
be 
contrary 
to 
themselves. 
For 
if 
‘great’ 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
‘small’, 
and 
the 
same 
thing 
is 
both 
great 
and 
small 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
then 
‘small’ 
or 
‘great’ 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
itself. 
But 
this 
is 
impossible. 
The 
term 
‘great’, 
therefore, 
is 
not 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
term 
‘small’, 
nor 
‘much’ 
of 
‘little’. 
And 
even 
though 
a 
man 
should 
call 
these 
terms 
not 
relative 
but 
quantitative, 
they 
would 
not 
have 
contraries. 


It 
is 
in 
the 
case 
of 
space 
that 
quantity 
most 
plausibly 
appears 
to 
admit 
of 
a 
contrary. 
For 
men 
define 
the 
term 
‘above’ 
as 
the 
contrary 
of 
‘below’, 
when 
it 
is 
the 
region 
at 
the 
centre 
they 
mean 
by 
‘below’; 
and 
this 
is 
so, 
because 
nothing 
is 
farther 
from 
the 
extremities 
of 
the 
universe 
than 
the 
region 
at 
the 
centre. 
Indeed, 
it 
seems 
that 
in 
defining 
contraries 
of 
every 
kind 
men 
have 
recourse 
to 
a 
spatial 
metaphor, 
for 
they 
say 
that 
those 
things 
are 
contraries 
which, 
within 
the 
same 
class, 
are 
separated 
by 
the 
greatest 
possible 
distance. 


Quantity 
does 
not, 
it 
appears, 
admit 
of 
variation 
of 
degree. 
One 
thing 
cannot 
be 
two 
cubits 
long 
in 
a 
greater 
degree 
than 
another. 
Similarly 
with 
regard 
to 
number: 
what 
is 
‘three’ 
is 
not 
more 
truly 
three 
than 
what 
is 
‘five’ 
is 
five; 
nor 
is 
one 
set 
of 
three 
more 
truly 
three 
than 
another 
set. 
Again, 
one 
period 
of 
time 
is 
not 
said 
to 
be 
more 
truly 
time 
than 
another. 
Nor 
is 
there 
any 
other 
kind 
of 
quantity, 
of 
all 
that 
have 
been 
mentioned, 
with 
regard 
to 
which 
variation 
of 
degree 
can 
be 
predicated. 
The 
category 
of 
quantity, 
therefore, 
does 
not 
admit 
of 
variation 
of 
degree. 



The 
most 
distinctive 
mark 
of 
quantity 
is 
that 
equality 
and 
inequality 
are 
predicated 
of 
it. 
Each 
of 
the 
aforesaid 
quantities 
is 
said 
to 
be 
equal 
or 
unequal. 
For 
instance, 
one 
solid 
is 
said 
to 
be 
equal 
or 
unequal 
to 
another; 
number, 
too, 
and 
time 
can 
have 
these 
terms 
applied 
to 
them, 
indeed 
can 
all 
those 
kinds 
of 
quantity 
that 
have 
been 
mentioned. 


That 
which 
is 
not 
a 
quantity 
can 
by 
no 
means, 
it 
would 
seem, 
be 
termed 
equal 
or 
unequal 
to 
anything 
else. 
One 
particular 
disposition 
or 
one 
particular 
quality, 
such 
as 
whiteness, 
is 
by 
no 
means 
compared 
with 
another 
in 
terms 
of 
equality 
and 
inequality 
but 
rather 
in 
terms 
of 
similarity. 
Thus 
it 
is 
the 
distinctive 
mark 
of 
quantity 
that 
it 
can 
be 
called 
equal 
and 
unequal. 


Those 
things 
are 
called 
relative, 
which, 
being 
either 
said 
to 
be 
of 
something 
else 
or 
related 
to 
something 
else, 
are 
explained 
by 
reference 
to 
that 
other 
thing. 
For 
instance, 
the 
word 
‘superior’ 
is 
explained 
by 
reference 
to 
something 
else, 
for 
it 
is 
superiority 
over 
something 
else 
that 
is 
meant. 
Similarly, 
the 
expression 
‘double’ 
has 
this 
external 
reference, 
for 
it 
is 
the 
double 
of 
something 
else 
that 
is 
meant. 
So 
it 
is 
with 
everything 
else 
of 
this 
kind. 
There 
are, 
moreover, 
other 
relatives, 
e.g. 
habit, 
disposition, 
perception, 
knowledge, 
and 
attitude. 
The 
significance 
of 
all 
these 
is 
explained 
by 
a 
reference 
to 
something 
else 
and 
in 
no 
other 
way. 
Thus, 
a 
habit 
is 
a 
habit 
of 
something, 
knowledge 
is 
knowledge 
of 
something, 
attitude 
is 
the 
attitude 
of 
something. 
So 
it 
is 
with 
all 
other 
relatives 
that 
have 
been 
mentioned. 
Those 
terms, 
then, 
are 
called 
relative, 
the 
nature 
of 
which 
is 
explained 
by 
reference 
to 
something 
else, 
the 
preposition 
‘of’ 
or 
some 
other 
preposition 
being 
used 
to 
indicate 
the 
relation. 
Thus, 
one 
mountain 
is 
called 
great 
in 
comparison 
with 
son 
with 
another; 
for 
the 
mountain 
claims 
this 
attribute 
by 
comparison 
with 
something. 
Again, 
that 
which 
is 
called 
similar 
must 
be 
similar 
to 
something 
else, 
and 
all 
other 
such 
attributes 
have 
this 
external 
reference. 
It 
is 
to 
be 
noted 
that 
lying 
and 
standing 
and 
sitting 
are 
particular 
attitudes, 
but 
attitude 
is 
itself 
a 
relative 
term. 
To 
lie, 
to 
stand, 
to 
be 
seated, 
are 
not 
themselves 
attitudes, 
but 
take 
their 
name 
from 
the 
aforesaid 
attitudes. 


It 
is 
possible 
for 
relatives 
to 
have 
contraries. 
Thus 
virtue 
has 
a 
contrary, 
vice, 
these 
both 
being 
relatives; 
knowledge, 
too, 
has 
a 
contrary, 
ignorance. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
the 
mark 
of 
all 
relatives; 
‘double’ 
and 
‘triple’ 
have 
no 
contrary, 
nor 
indeed 
has 
any 
such 
term. 



It 
also 
appears 
that 
relatives 
can 
admit 
of 
variation 
of 
degree. 
For 
‘like’ 
and 
‘unlike’, 
‘equal’ 
and 
‘unequal’, 
have 
the 
modifications 
‘more’ 
and 
‘less’ 
applied 
to 
them, 
and 
each 
of 
these 
is 
relative 
in 
character: 
for 
the 
terms 
‘like’ 
and 
‘unequal’ 
bear 
‘unequal’ 
bear 
a 
reference 
to 
something 
external. 
Yet, 
again, 
it 
is 
not 
every 
relative 
term 
that 
admits 
of 
variation 
of 
degree. 
No 
term 
such 
as 
‘double’ 
admits 
of 
this 
modification. 
All 
relatives 
have 
correlatives: 
by 
the 
term 
‘slave’ 
we 
mean 
the 
slave 
of 
a 
master, 
by 
the 
term 
‘master’, 
the 
master 
of 
a 
slave; 
by 
‘double’, 
the 
double 
of 
its 
hall; 
by 
‘half’, 
the 
half 
of 
its 
double; 
by 
‘greater’, 
greater 
than 
that 
which 
is 
less; 
by 
‘less,’ 
less 
than 
that 
which 
is 
greater. 


So 
it 
is 
with 
every 
other 
relative 
term; 
but 
the 
case 
we 
use 
to 
express 
the 
correlation 
differs 
in 
some 
instances. 
Thus, 
by 
knowledge 
we 
mean 
knowledge 
the 
knowable; 
by 
the 
knowable, 
that 
which 
is 
to 
be 
apprehended 
by 
knowledge; 
by 
perception, 
perception 
of 
the 
perceptible; 
by 
the 
perceptible, 
that 
which 
is 
apprehended 
by 
perception. 


Sometimes, 
however, 
reciprocity 
of 
correlation 
does 
not 
appear 
to 
exist. 
This 
comes 
about 
when 
a 
blunder 
is 
made, 
and 
that 
to 
which 
the 
relative 
is 
related 
is 
not 
accurately 
stated. 
If 
a 
man 
states 
that 
a 
wing 
is 
necessarily 
relative 
to 
a 
bird, 
the 
connexion 
between 
these 
two 
will 
not 
be 
reciprocal, 
for 
it 
will 
not 
be 
possible 
to 
say 
that 
a 
bird 
is 
a 
bird 
by 
reason 
of 
its 
wings. 
The 
reason 
is 
that 
the 
original 
statement 
was 
inaccurate, 
for 
the 
wing 
is 
not 
said 
to 
be 
relative 
to 
the 
bird 
qua 
bird, 
since 
many 
creatures 
besides 
birds 
have 
wings, 
but 
qua 
winged 
creature. 
If, 
then, 
the 
statement 
is 
made 
accurate, 
the 
connexion 
will 
be 
reciprocal, 
for 
we 
can 
speak 
of 
a 
wing, 
having 
reference 
necessarily 
to 
a 
winged 
creature, 
and 
of 
a 
winged 
creature 
as 
being 
such 
because 
of 
its 
wings. 


Occasionally, 
perhaps, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
coin 
words, 
if 
no 
word 
exists 
by 
which 
a 
correlation 
can 
adequately 
be 
explained. 
If 
we 
define 
a 
rudder 
as 
necessarily 
having 
reference 
to 
a 
boat, 
our 
definition 
will 
not 
be 
appropriate, 
for 
the 
rudder 
does 
not 
have 
this 
reference 
to 
a 
boat 
qua 
boat, 
as 
there 
are 
boats 
which 
have 
no 
rudders. 
Thus 
we 
cannot 
use 
the 
terms 
reciprocally, 
for 
the 
word 
‘boat’ 
cannot 
be 
said 
to 
find 
its 
explanation 
in 
the 
word 
‘rudder’. 
As 
there 
is 
no 
existing 
word, 
our 
definition 
would 
perhaps 
be 
more 
accurate 
if 
we 
coined 
some 
word 
like 
‘ruddered’ 
as 
the 
correlative 
of 
‘rudder’. 
If 
we 
express 
ourselves 
thus 
accurately, 
at 
any 
rate 
the 
terms 
are 
reciprocally 
connected, 
for 
the 
‘ruddered’ 
thing 
is 
‘ruddered’ 
in 
virtue 
of 
its 
rudder. 
So 
it 
is 
in 
all 
other 
cases. 
A 
head 
will 
be 
more 
accurately 
defined 
as 
the 
correlative 



of 
that 
which 
is 
‘headed’, 
than 
as 
that 
of 
an 
animal, 
for 
the 
animal 
does 
not 
have 
a 
head 
qua 
animal, 
since 
many 
animals 
have 
no 
head. 


Thus 
we 
may 
perhaps 
most 
easily 
comprehend 
that 
to 
which 
a 
thing 
is 
related, 
when 
a 
name 
does 
not 
exist, 
if, 
from 
that 
which 
has 
a 
name, 
we 
derive 
a 
new 
name, 
and 
apply 
it 
to 
that 
with 
which 
the 
first 
is 
reciprocally 
connected, 
as 
in 
the 
aforesaid 
instances, 
when 
we 
derived 
the 
word 
‘winged’ 
from 
‘wing’ 
and 
from 
‘rudder’. 


All 
relatives, 
then, 
if 
properly 
defined, 
have 
a 
correlative. 
I 
add 
this 
condition 
because, 
if 
that 
to 
which 
they 
are 
related 
is 
stated 
as 
haphazard 
and 
not 
accurately, 
the 
two 
are 
not 
found 
to 
be 
interdependent. 
Let 
me 
state 
what 
I 
mean 
more 
clearly. 
Even 
in 
the 
case 
of 
acknowledged 
correlatives, 
and 
where 
names 
exist 
for 
each, 
there 
will 
be 
no 
interdependence 
if 
one 
of 
the 
two 
is 
denoted, 
not 
by 
that 
name 
which 
expresses 
the 
correlative 
notion, 
but 
by 
one 
of 
irrelevant 
significance. 
The 
term 
‘slave,’ 
if 
defined 
as 
related, 
not 
to 
a 
master, 
but 
to 
a 
man, 
or 
a 
biped, 
or 
anything 
of 
that 
sort, 
is 
not 
reciprocally 
connected 
with 
that 
in 
relation 
to 
which 
it 
is 
defined, 
for 
the 
statement 
is 
not 
exact. 
Further, 
if 
one 
thing 
is 
said 
to 
be 
correlative 
with 
another, 
and 
the 
terminology 
used 
is 
correct, 
then, 
though 
all 
irrelevant 
attributes 
should 
be 
removed, 
and 
only 
that 
one 
attribute 
left 
in 
virtue 
of 
which 
it 
was 
correctly 
stated 
to 
be 
correlative 
with 
that 
other, 
the 
stated 
correlation 
will 
still 
exist. 
If 
the 
correlative 
of 
‘the 
slave’ 
is 
said 
to 
be 
‘the 
master’, 
then, 
though 
all 
irrelevant 
attributes 
of 
the 
said 
‘master’, 
such 
as 
‘biped’, 
‘receptive 
of 
knowledge’, 
‘human’, 
should 
be 
removed, 
and 
the 
attribute 
‘master’ 
alone 
left, 
the 
stated 
correlation 
existing 
between 
him 
and 
the 
slave 
will 
remain 
the 
same, 
for 
it 
is 
of 
a 
master 
that 
a 
slave 
is 
said 
to 
be 
the 
slave. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
if, 
of 
two 
correlatives, 
one 
is 
not 
correctly 
termed, 
then, 
when 
all 
other 
attributes 
are 
removed 
and 
that 
alone 
is 
left 
in 
virtue 
of 
which 
it 
was 
stated 
to 
be 
correlative, 
the 
stated 
correlation 
will 
be 
found 
to 
have 
disappeared. 


For 
suppose 
the 
correlative 
of 
‘the 
slave’ 
should 
be 
said 
to 
be 
‘the 
man’, 
or 
the 
correlative 
of 
‘the 
wing”the 
bird’; 
if 
the 
attribute 
‘master’ 
be 
withdrawn 
from’ 
the 
man’, 
the 
correlation 
between 
‘the 
man’ 
and 
‘the 
slave’ 
will 
cease 
to 
exist, 
for 
if 
the 
man 
is 
not 
a 
master, 
the 
slave 
is 
not 
a 
slave. 
Similarly, 
if 
the 
attribute 
‘winged’ 
be 
withdrawn 
from 
‘the 
bird’, 
‘the 
wing’ 
will 
no 
longer 
be 
relative; 
for 
if 
the 
so-called 
correlative 
is 
not 
winged, 
it 
follows 
that 
‘the 
wing’ 
has 
no 
correlative. 


Thus 
it 
is 
essential 
that 
the 
correlated 
terms 
should 
be 
exactly 
designated; 



if 
there 
is 
a 
name 
existing, 
the 
statement 
will 
be 
easy; 
if 
not, 
it 
is 
doubtless 
our 
duty 
to 
construct 
names. 
When 
the 
terminology 
is 
thus 
correct, 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
all 
correlatives 
are 
interdependent. 


Correlatives 
are 
thought 
to 
come 
into 
existence 
simultaneously. 
This 
is 
for 
the 
most 
part 
true, 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
double 
and 
the 
half. 
The 
existence 
of 
the 
half 
necessitates 
the 
existence 
of 
that 
of 
which 
it 
is 
a 
half. 
Similarly 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
master 
necessitates 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
slave, 
and 
that 
of 
a 
slave 
implies 
that 
of 
a 
master; 
these 
are 
merely 
instances 
of 
a 
general 
rule. 
Moreover, 
they 
cancel 
one 
another; 
for 
if 
there 
is 
no 
double 
it 
follows 
that 
there 
is 
no 
half, 
and 
vice 
versa; 
this 
rule 
also 
applies 
to 
all 
such 
correlatives. 
Yet 
it 
does 
not 
appear 
to 
be 
true 
in 
all 
cases 
that 
correlatives 
come 
into 
existence 
simultaneously. 
The 
object 
of 
knowledge 
would 
appear 
to 
exist 
before 
knowledge 
itself, 
for 
it 
is 
usually 
the 
case 
that 
we 
acquire 
knowledge 
of 
objects 
already 
existing; 
it 
would 
be 
difficult, 
if 
not 
impossible, 
to 
find 
a 
branch 
of 
knowledge 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
which 
was 
contemporaneous 
with 
that 
of 
its 
object. 


Again, 
while 
the 
object 
of 
knowledge, 
if 
it 
ceases 
to 
exist, 
cancels 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
knowledge 
which 
was 
its 
correlative, 
the 
converse 
of 
this 
is 
not 
true. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
if 
the 
object 
of 
knowledge 
does 
not 
exist 
there 
can 
be 
no 
knowledge: 
for 
there 
will 
no 
longer 
be 
anything 
to 
know. 
Yet 
it 
is 
equally 
true 
that, 
if 
knowledge 
of 
a 
certain 
object 
does 
not 
exist, 
the 
object 
may 
nevertheless 
quite 
well 
exist. 
Thus, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
squaring 
of 
the 
circle, 
if 
indeed 
that 
process 
is 
an 
object 
of 
knowledge, 
though 
it 
itself 
exists 
as 
an 
object 
of 
knowledge, 
yet 
the 
knowledge 
of 
it 
has 
not 
yet 
come 
into 
existence. 
Again, 
if 
all 
animals 
ceased 
to 
exist, 
there 
would 
be 
no 
knowledge, 
but 
there 
might 
yet 
be 
many 
objects 
of 
knowledge. 


This 
is 
likewise 
the 
case 
with 
regard 
to 
perception: 
for 
the 
object 
of 
perception 
is, 
it 
appears, 
prior 
to 
the 
act 
of 
perception. 
If 
the 
perceptible 
is 
annihilated, 
perception 
also 
will 
cease 
to 
exist; 
but 
the 
annihilation 
of 
perception 
does 
not 
cancel 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
perceptible. 
For 
perception 
implies 
a 
body 
perceived 
and 
a 
body 
in 
which 
perception 
takes 
place. 
Now 
if 
that 
which 
is 
perceptible 
is 
annihilated, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
body 
is 
annihilated, 
for 
the 
body 
is 
a 
perceptible 
thing; 
and 
if 
the 
body 
does 
not 
exist, 
it 
follows 
that 
perception 
also 
ceases 
to 
exist. 
Thus 
the 
annihilation 
of 
the 
perceptible 
involves 
that 
of 
perception. 


But 
the 
annihilation 
of 
perception 
does 
not 
involve 
that 
of 
the 
perceptible. 
For 
if 
the 
animal 
is 
annihilated, 
it 
follows 
that 
perception 
also 
is 
annihilated, 



but 
perceptibles 
such 
as 
body, 
heat, 
sweetness, 
bitterness, 
and 
so 
on, 
will 
remain. 


Again, 
perception 
is 
generated 
at 
the 
same 
time 
as 
the 
perceiving 
subject, 
for 
it 
comes 
into 
existence 
at 
the 
same 
time 
as 
the 
animal. 
But 
the 
perceptible 
surely 
exists 
before 
perception; 
for 
fire 
and 
water 
and 
such 
elements, 
out 
of 
which 
the 
animal 
is 
itself 
composed, 
exist 
before 
the 
animal 
is 
an 
animal 
at 
all, 
and 
before 
perception. 
Thus 
it 
would 
seem 
that 
the 
perceptible 
exists 
before 
perception. 


It 
may 
be 
questioned 
whether 
it 
is 
true 
that 
no 
substance 
is 
relative, 
as 
seems 
to 
be 
the 
case, 
or 
whether 
exception 
is 
to 
be 
made 
in 
the 
case 
of 
certain 
secondary 
substances. 
With 
regard 
to 
primary 
substances, 
it 
is 
quite 
true 
that 
there 
is 
no 
such 
possibility, 
for 
neither 
wholes 
nor 
parts 
of 
primary 
substances 
are 
relative. 
The 
individual 
man 
or 
ox 
is 
not 
defined 
with 
reference 
to 
something 
external. 
Similarly 
with 
the 
parts: 
a 
particular 
hand 
or 
head 
is 
not 
defined 
as 
a 
particular 
hand 
or 
head 
of 
a 
particular 
person, 
but 
as 
the 
hand 
or 
head 
of 
a 
particular 
person. 
It 
is 
true 
also, 
for 
the 
most 
part 
at 
least, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
secondary 
substances; 
the 
species 
‘man’ 
and 
the 
species 
‘ox’ 
are 
not 
defined 
with 
reference 
to 
anything 
outside 
themselves. 
Wood, 
again, 
is 
only 
relative 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
some 
one’s 
property, 
not 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
wood. 
It 
is 
plain, 
then, 
that 
in 
the 
cases 
mentioned 
substance 
is 
not 
relative. 
But 
with 
regard 
to 
some 
secondary 
substances 
there 
is 
a 
difference 
of 
opinion; 
thus, 
such 
terms 
as 
‘head’ 
and 
‘hand’ 
are 
defined 
with 
reference 
to 
that 
of 
which 
the 
things 
indicated 
are 
a 
part, 
and 
so 
it 
comes 
about 
that 
these 
appear 
to 
have 
a 
relative 
character. 
Indeed, 
if 
our 
definition 
of 
that 
which 
is 
relative 
was 
complete, 
it 
is 
very 
difficult, 
if 
not 
impossible, 
to 
prove 
that 
no 
substance 
is 
relative. 
If, 
however, 
our 
definition 
was 
not 
complete, 
if 
those 
things 
only 
are 
properly 
called 
relative 
in 
the 
case 
of 
which 
relation 
to 
an 
external 
object 
is 
a 
necessary 
condition 
of 
existence, 
perhaps 
some 
explanation 
of 
the 
dilemma 
may 
be 
found. 


The 
former 
definition 
does 
indeed 
apply 
to 
all 
relatives, 
but 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
thing 
is 
explained 
with 
reference 
to 
something 
else 
does 
not 
make 
it 
essentially 
relative. 


From 
this 
it 
is 
plain 
that, 
if 
a 
man 
definitely 
apprehends 
a 
relative 
thing, 
he 
will 
also 
definitely 
apprehend 
that 
to 
which 
it 
is 
relative. 
Indeed 
this 
is 
self-
evident: 
for 
if 
a 
man 
knows 
that 
some 
particular 
thing 
is 
relative, 
assuming 
that 
we 
call 
that 
a 
relative 
in 
the 
case 
of 
which 
relation 
to 
something 
is 
a 
necessary 
condition 
of 
existence, 
he 
knows 
that 
also 
to 
which 
it 
is 
related. 
For 



if 
he 
does 
not 
know 
at 
all 
that 
to 
which 
it 
is 
related, 
he 
will 
not 
know 
whether 
or 
not 
it 
is 
relative. 
This 
is 
clear, 
moreover, 
in 
particular 
instances. 
If 
a 
man 
knows 
definitely 
that 
such 
and 
such 
a 
thing 
is 
‘double’, 
he 
will 
also 
forthwith 
know 
definitely 
that 
of 
which 
it 
is 
the 
double. 
For 
if 
there 
is 
nothing 
definite 
of 
which 
he 
knows 
it 
to 
be 
the 
double, 
he 
does 
not 
know 
at 
all 
that 
it 
is 
double. 
Again, 
if 
he 
knows 
that 
a 
thing 
is 
more 
beautiful, 
it 
follows 
necessarily 
that 
he 
will 
forthwith 
definitely 
know 
that 
also 
than 
which 
it 
is 
more 
beautiful. 
He 
will 
not 
merely 
know 
indefinitely 
that 
it 
is 
more 
beautiful 
than 
something 
which 
is 
less 
beautiful, 
for 
this 
would 
be 
supposition, 
not 
knowledge. 
For 
if 
he 
does 
not 
know 
definitely 
that 
than 
which 
it 
is 
more 
beautiful, 
he 
can 
no 
longer 
claim 
to 
know 
definitely 
that 
it 
is 
more 
beautiful 
than 
something 
else 
which 
is 
less 
beautiful: 
for 
it 
might 
be 
that 
nothing 
was 
less 
beautiful. 
It 
is, 
therefore, 
evident 
that 
if 
a 
man 
apprehends 
some 
relative 
thing 
definitely, 
he 
necessarily 
knows 
that 
also 
definitely 
to 
which 
it 
is 
related. 


Now 
the 
head, 
the 
hand, 
and 
such 
things 
are 
substances, 
and 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
know 
their 
essential 
character 
definitely, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
necessarily 
follow 
that 
we 
should 
know 
that 
to 
which 
they 
are 
related. 
It 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
know 
forthwith 
whose 
head 
or 
hand 
is 
meant. 
Thus 
these 
are 
not 
relatives, 
and, 
this 
being 
the 
case, 
it 
would 
be 
true 
to 
say 
that 
no 
substance 
is 
relative 
in 
character. 
It 
is 
perhaps 
a 
difficult 
matter, 
in 
such 
cases, 
to 
make 
a 
positive 
statement 
without 
more 
exhaustive 
examination, 
but 
to 
have 
raised 
questions 
with 
regard 
to 
details 
is 
not 
without 
advantage. 


By 
‘quality’ 
I 
mean 
that 
in 
virtue 
of 
which 
people 
are 
said 
to 
be 
such 
and 
such. 


Quality 
is 
a 
term 
that 
is 
used 
in 
many 
senses. 
One 
sort 
of 
quality 
let 
us 
call 
‘habit’ 
or 
‘disposition’. 
Habit 
differs 
from 
disposition 
in 
being 
more 
lasting 
and 
more 
firmly 
established. 
The 
various 
kinds 
of 
knowledge 
and 
of 
virtue 
are 
habits, 
for 
knowledge, 
even 
when 
acquired 
only 
in 
a 
moderate 
degree, 
is, 
it 
is 
agreed, 
abiding 
in 
its 
character 
and 
difficult 
to 
displace, 
unless 
some 
great 
mental 
upheaval 
takes 
place, 
through 
disease 
or 
any 
such 
cause. 
The 
virtues, 
also, 
such 
as 
justice, 
self-restraint, 
and 
so 
on, 
are 
not 
easily 
dislodged 
or 
dismissed, 
so 
as 
to 
give 
place 
to 
vice. 


By 
a 
disposition, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
we 
mean 
a 
condition 
that 
is 
easily 



changed 
and 
quickly 
gives 
place 
to 
its 
opposite. 
Thus, 
heat, 
cold, 
disease, 
health, 
and 
so 
on 
are 
dispositions. 
For 
a 
man 
is 
disposed 
in 
one 
way 
or 
another 
with 
reference 
to 
these, 
but 
quickly 
changes, 
becoming 
cold 
instead 
of 
warm, 
ill 
instead 
of 
well. 
So 
it 
is 
with 
all 
other 
dispositions 
also, 
unless 
through 
lapse 
of 
time 
a 
disposition 
has 
itself 
become 
inveterate 
and 
almost 
impossible 
to 
dislodge: 
in 
which 
case 
we 
should 
perhaps 
go 
so 
far 
as 
to 
call 
it 
a 
habit. 


It 
is 
evident 
that 
men 
incline 
to 
call 
those 
conditions 
habits 
which 
are 
of 
a 
more 
or 
less 
permanent 
type 
and 
difficult 
to 
displace; 
for 
those 
who 
are 
not 
retentive 
of 
knowledge, 
but 
volatile, 
are 
not 
said 
to 
have 
such 
and 
such 
a 
‘habit’ 
as 
regards 
knowledge, 
yet 
they 
are 
disposed, 
we 
may 
say, 
either 
better 
or 
worse, 
towards 
knowledge. 
Thus 
habit 
differs 
from 
disposition 
in 
this, 
that 
while 
the 
latter 
in 
ephemeral, 
the 
former 
is 
permanent 
and 
difficult 
to 
alter. 


Habits 
are 
at 
the 
same 
time 
dispositions, 
but 
dispositions 
are 
not 
necessarily 
habits. 
For 
those 
who 
have 
some 
specific 
habit 
may 
be 
said 
also, 
in 
virtue 
of 
that 
habit, 
to 
be 
thus 
or 
thus 
disposed; 
but 
those 
who 
are 
disposed 
in 
some 
specific 
way 
have 
not 
in 
all 
cases 
the 
corresponding 
habit. 


Another 
sort 
of 
quality 
is 
that 
in 
virtue 
of 
which, 
for 
example, 
we 
call 
men 
good 
boxers 
or 
runners, 
or 
healthy 
or 
sickly: 
in 
fact 
it 
includes 
all 
those 
terms 
which 
refer 
to 
inborn 
capacity 
or 
incapacity. 
Such 
things 
are 
not 
predicated 
of 
a 
person 
in 
virtue 
of 
his 
disposition, 
but 
in 
virtue 
of 
his 
inborn 
capacity 
or 
incapacity 
to 
do 
something 
with 
ease 
or 
to 
avoid 
defeat 
of 
any 
kind. 
Persons 
are 
called 
good 
boxers 
or 
good 
runners, 
not 
in 
virtue 
of 
such 
and 
such 
a 
disposition, 
but 
in 
virtue 
of 
an 
inborn 
capacity 
to 
accomplish 
something 
with 
ease. 
Men 
are 
called 
healthy 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
inborn 
capacity 
of 
easy 
resistance 
to 
those 
unhealthy 
influences 
that 
may 
ordinarily 
arise; 
unhealthy, 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
lack 
of 
this 
capacity. 
Similarly 
with 
regard 
to 
softness 
and 
hardness. 
Hardness 
is 
predicated 
of 
a 
thing 
because 
it 
has 
that 
capacity 
of 
resistance 
which 
enables 
it 
to 
withstand 
disintegration; 
softness, 
again, 
is 
predicated 
of 
a 
thing 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
lack 
of 
that 
capacity. 


A 
third 
class 
within 
this 
category 
is 
that 
of 
affective 
qualities 
and 
affections. 
Sweetness, 
bitterness, 
sourness, 
are 
examples 
of 
this 
sort 
of 
quality, 
together 
with 
all 
that 
is 
akin 
to 
these; 
heat, 
moreover, 
and 
cold, 
whiteness, 
and 
blackness 
are 
affective 
qualities. 
It 
is 
evident 
that 
these 
are 
qualities, 
for 
those 
things 
that 
possess 
them 
are 
themselves 
said 
to 
be 
such 
and 
such 
by 
reason 
of 
their 
presence. 
Honey 
is 
called 
sweet 
because 
it 
contains 
sweetness; 
the 
body 
is 
called 
white 
because 
it 
contains 
whiteness; 



and 
so 
in 
all 
other 
cases. 


The 
term 
‘affective 
quality’ 
is 
not 
used 
as 
indicating 
that 
those 
things 
which 
admit 
these 
qualities 
are 
affected 
in 
any 
way. 
Honey 
is 
not 
called 
sweet 
because 
it 
is 
affected 
in 
a 
specific 
way, 
nor 
is 
this 
what 
is 
meant 
in 
any 
other 
instance. 
Similarly 
heat 
and 
cold 
are 
called 
affective 
qualities, 
not 
because 
those 
things 
which 
admit 
them 
are 
affected. 
What 
is 
meant 
is 
that 
these 
said 
qualities 
are 
capable 
of 
producing 
an 
‘affection’ 
in 
the 
way 
of 
perception. 
For 
sweetness 
has 
the 
power 
of 
affecting 
the 
sense 
of 
taste; 
heat, 
that 
of 
touch; 
and 
so 
it 
is 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
these 
qualities. 


Whiteness 
and 
blackness, 
however, 
and 
the 
other 
colours, 
are 
not 
said 
to 
be 
affective 
qualities 
in 
this 
sense, 
but 
—because 
they 
themselves 
are 
the 
results 
of 
an 
affection. 
It 
is 
plain 
that 
many 
changes 
of 
colour 
take 
place 
because 
of 
affections. 
When 
a 
man 
is 
ashamed, 
he 
blushes; 
when 
he 
is 
afraid, 
he 
becomes 
pale, 
and 
so 
on. 
So 
true 
is 
this, 
that 
when 
a 
man 
is 
by 
nature 
liable 
to 
such 
affections, 
arising 
from 
some 
concomitance 
of 
elements 
in 
his 
constitution, 
it 
is 
a 
probable 
inference 
that 
he 
has 
the 
corresponding 
complexion 
of 
skin. 
For 
the 
same 
disposition 
of 
bodily 
elements, 
which 
in 
the 
former 
instance 
was 
momentarily 
present 
in 
the 
case 
of 
an 
access 
of 
shame, 
might 
be 
a 
result 
of 
a 
man’s 
natural 
temperament, 
so 
as 
to 
produce 
the 
corresponding 
colouring 
also 
as 
a 
natural 
characteristic. 
All 
conditions, 
therefore, 
of 
this 
kind, 
if 
caused 
by 
certain 
permanent 
and 
lasting 
affections, 
are 
called 
affective 
qualities. 
For 
pallor 
and 
duskiness 
of 
complexion 
are 
called 
qualities, 
inasmuch 
as 
we 
are 
said 
to 
be 
such 
and 
such 
in 
virtue 
of 
them, 
not 
only 
if 
they 
originate 
in 
natural 
constitution, 
but 
also 
if 
they 
come 
about 
through 
long 
disease 
or 
sunburn, 
and 
are 
difficult 
to 
remove, 
or 
indeed 
remain 
throughout 
life. 
For 
in 
the 
same 
way 
we 
are 
said 
to 
be 
such 
and 
such 
because 
of 
these. 


Those 
conditions, 
however, 
which 
arise 
from 
causes 
which 
may 
easily 
be 
rendered 
ineffective 
or 
speedily 
removed, 
are 
called, 
not 
qualities, 
but 
affections: 
for 
we 
are 
not 
said 
to 
be 
such 
virtue 
of 
them. 
The 
man 
who 
blushes 
through 
shame 
is 
not 
said 
to 
be 
a 
constitutional 
blusher, 
nor 
is 
the 
man 
who 
becomes 
pale 
through 
fear 
said 
to 
be 
constitutionally 
pale. 
He 
is 
said 
rather 
to 
have 
been 
affected. 


Thus 
such 
conditions 
are 
called 
affections, 
not 
qualities. 


In 
like 
manner 
there 
are 
affective 
qualities 
and 
affections 
of 
the 
soul. 
That 
temper 
with 
which 
a 
man 
is 
born 
and 
which 
has 
its 
origin 
in 
certain 
deep-
seated 
affections 
is 
called 
a 
quality. 
I 
mean 
such 
conditions 
as 
insanity, 



irascibility, 
and 
so 
on: 
for 
people 
are 
said 
to 
be 
mad 
or 
irascible 
in 
virtue 
of 
these. 
Similarly 
those 
abnormal 
psychic 
states 
which 
are 
not 
inborn, 
but 
arise 
from 
the 
concomitance 
of 
certain 
other 
elements, 
and 
are 
difficult 
to 
remove, 
or 
altogether 
permanent, 
are 
called 
qualities, 
for 
in 
virtue 
of 
them 
men 
are 
said 
to 
be 
such 
and 
such. 


Those, 
however, 
which 
arise 
from 
causes 
easily 
rendered 
ineffective 
are 
called 
affections, 
not 
qualities. 
Suppose 
that 
a 
man 
is 
irritable 
when 
vexed: 
he 
is 
not 
even 
spoken 
of 
as 
a 
bad-tempered 
man, 
when 
in 
such 
circumstances 
he 
loses 
his 
temper 
somewhat, 
but 
rather 
is 
said 
to 
be 
affected. 
Such 
conditions 
are 
therefore 
termed, 
not 
qualities, 
but 
affections. 


The 
fourth 
sort 
of 
quality 
is 
figure 
and 
the 
shape 
that 
belongs 
to 
a 
thing; 
and 
besides 
this, 
straightness 
and 
curvedness 
and 
any 
other 
qualities 
of 
this 
type; 
each 
of 
these 
defines 
a 
thing 
as 
being 
such 
and 
such. 
Because 
it 
is 
triangular 
or 
quadrangular 
a 
thing 
is 
said 
to 
have 
a 
specific 
character, 
or 
again 
because 
it 
is 
straight 
or 
curved; 
in 
fact 
a 
thing’s 
shape 
in 
every 
case 
gives 
rise 
to 
a 
qualification 
of 
it. 


Rarity 
and 
density, 
roughness 
and 
smoothness, 
seem 
to 
be 
terms 
indicating 
quality: 
yet 
these, 
it 
would 
appear, 
really 
belong 
to 
a 
class 
different 
from 
that 
of 
quality. 
For 
it 
is 
rather 
a 
certain 
relative 
position 
of 
the 
parts 
composing 
the 
thing 
thus 
qualified 
which, 
it 
appears, 
is 
indicated 
by 
each 
of 
these 
terms. 
A 
thing 
is 
dense, 
owing 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
its 
parts 
are 
closely 
combined 
with 
one 
another; 
rare, 
because 
there 
are 
interstices 
between 
the 
parts; 
smooth, 
because 
its 
parts 
lie, 
so 
to 
speak, 
evenly; 
rough, 
because 
some 
parts 
project 
beyond 
others. 


There 
may 
be 
other 
sorts 
of 
quality, 
but 
those 
that 
are 
most 
properly 
so 
called 
have, 
we 
may 
safely 
say, 
been 
enumerated. 


These, 
then, 
are 
qualities, 
and 
the 
things 
that 
take 
their 
name 
from 
them 
as 
derivatives, 
or 
are 
in 
some 
other 
way 
dependent 
on 
them, 
are 
said 
to 
be 
qualified 
in 
some 
specific 
way. 
In 
most, 
indeed 
in 
almost 
all 
cases, 
the 
name 
of 
that 
which 
is 
qualified 
is 
derived 
from 
that 
of 
the 
quality. 
Thus 
the 
terms 
‘whiteness’, 
‘grammar’, 
‘justice’, 
give 
us 
the 
adjectives 
‘white’, 
‘grammatical’, 
‘just’, 
and 
so 
on. 


There 
are 
some 
cases, 
however, 
in 
which, 
as 
the 
quality 
under 
consideration 
has 
no 
name, 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
those 
possessed 
of 
it 
should 
have 
a 
name 
that 
is 
derivative. 
For 
instance, 
the 
name 
given 
to 
the 
runner 
or 
boxer, 
who 
is 
so 
called 
in 
virtue 
of 
an 
inborn 
capacity, 
is 
not 
derived 
from 
that 
of 
any 
quality; 
for 
lob 
those 
capacities 
have 
no 
name 
assigned 
to 
them. 
In 



this, 
the 
inborn 
capacity 
is 
distinct 
from 
the 
science, 
with 
reference 
to 
which 
men 
are 
called, 
e.g. 
boxers 
or 
wrestlers. 
Such 
a 
science 
is 
classed 
as 
a 
disposition; 
it 
has 
a 
name, 
and 
is 
called 
‘boxing’ 
or 
‘wrestling’ 
as 
the 
case 
may 
be, 
and 
the 
name 
given 
to 
those 
disposed 
in 
this 
way 
is 
derived 
from 
that 
of 
the 
science. 
Sometimes, 
even 
though 
a 
name 
exists 
for 
the 
quality, 
that 
which 
takes 
its 
character 
from 
the 
quality 
has 
a 
name 
that 
is 
not 
a 
derivative. 
For 
instance, 
the 
upright 
man 
takes 
his 
character 
from 
the 
possession 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
integrity, 
but 
the 
name 
given 
him 
is 
not 
derived 
from 
the 
word 
‘integrity’. 
Yet 
this 
does 
not 
occur 
often. 


We 
may 
therefore 
state 
that 
those 
things 
are 
said 
to 
be 
possessed 
of 
some 
specific 
quality 
which 
have 
a 
name 
derived 
from 
that 
of 
the 
aforesaid 
quality, 
or 
which 
are 
in 
some 
other 
way 
dependent 
on 
it. 


One 
quality 
may 
be 
the 
contrary 
of 
another; 
thus 
justice 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
injustice, 
whiteness 
of 
blackness, 
and 
so 
on. 
The 
things, 
also, 
which 
are 
said 
to 
be 
such 
and 
such 
in 
virtue 
of 
these 
qualities, 
may 
be 
contrary 
the 
one 
to 
the 
other; 
for 
that 
which 
is 
unjust 
is 
contrary 
to 
that 
which 
is 
just, 
that 
which 
is 
white 
to 
that 
which 
is 
black. 
This, 
however, 
is 
not 
always 
the 
case. 
Red, 
yellow, 
and 
such 
colours, 
though 
qualities, 
have 
no 
contraries. 


If 
one 
of 
two 
contraries 
is 
a 
quality, 
the 
other 
will 
also 
be 
a 
quality. 
This 
will 
be 
evident 
from 
particular 
instances, 
if 
we 
apply 
the 
names 
used 
to 
denote 
the 
other 
categories; 
for 
instance, 
granted 
that 
justice 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
injustice 
and 
justice 
is 
a 
quality, 
injustice 
will 
also 
be 
a 
quality: 
neither 
quantity, 
nor 
relation, 
nor 
place, 
nor 
indeed 
any 
other 
category 
but 
that 
of 
quality, 
will 
be 
applicable 
properly 
to 
injustice. 
So 
it 
is 
with 
all 
other 
contraries 
falling 
under 
the 
category 
of 
quality. 


Qualities 
admit 
of 
variation 
of 
degree. 
Whiteness 
is 
predicated 
of 
one 
thing 
in 
a 
greater 
or 
less 
degree 
than 
of 
another. 
This 
is 
also 
the 
case 
with 
reference 
to 
justice. 
Moreover, 
one 
and 
the 
same 
thing 
may 
exhibit 
a 
quality 
in 
a 
greater 
degree 
than 
it 
did 
before: 
if 
a 
thing 
is 
white, 
it 
may 
become 
whiter. 


Though 
this 
is 
generally 
the 
case, 
there 
are 
exceptions. 
For 
if 
we 
should 
say 
that 
justice 
admitted 
of 
variation 
of 
degree, 
difficulties 
might 
ensue, 
and 
this 
is 
true 
with 
regard 
to 
all 
those 
qualities 
which 
are 
dispositions. 
There 
are 
some, 
indeed, 
who 
dispute 
the 
possibility 
of 
variation 
here. 
They 
maintain 
that 
justice 
and 
health 
cannot 
very 
well 
admit 
of 
variation 
of 
degree 
themselves, 
but 
that 
people 
vary 
in 
the 
degree 
in 
which 
they 
possess 
these 
qualities, 
and 
that 
this 
is 
the 
case 
with 
grammatical 
learning 
and 
all 
those 
qualities 
which 
are 
classed 
as 
dispositions. 
However 
that 
may 
be, 
it 
is 
an 



incontrovertible 
fact 
that 
the 
things 
which 
in 
virtue 
of 
these 
qualities 
are 
said 
to 
be 
what 
they 
are 
vary 
in 
the 
degree 
in 
which 
they 
possess 
them; 
for 
one 
man 
is 
said 
to 
be 
better 
versed 
in 
grammar, 
or 
more 
healthy 
or 
just, 
than 
another, 
and 
so 
on. 


The 
qualities 
expressed 
by 
the 
terms 
‘triangular’ 
and 
‘quadrangular’ 
do 
not 
appear 
to 
admit 
of 
variation 
of 
degree, 
nor 
indeed 
do 
any 
that 
have 
to 
do 
with 
figure. 
For 
those 
things 
to 
which 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
triangle 
or 
circle 
is 
applicable 
are 
all 
equally 
triangular 
or 
circular. 
Those, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
to 
which 
the 
same 
definition 
is 
not 
applicable, 
cannot 
be 
said 
to 
differ 
from 
one 
another 
in 
degree; 
the 
square 
is 
no 
more 
a 
circle 
than 
the 
rectangle, 
for 
to 
neither 
is 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
circle 
appropriate. 
In 
short, 
if 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
term 
proposed 
is 
not 
applicable 
to 
both 
objects, 
they 
cannot 
be 
compared. 
Thus 
it 
is 
not 
all 
qualities 
which 
admit 
of 
variation 
of 
degree. 


Whereas 
none 
of 
the 
characteristics 
I 
have 
mentioned 
are 
peculiar 
to 
quality, 
the 
fact 
that 
likeness 
and 
unlikeness 
can 
be 
predicated 
with 
reference 
to 
quality 
only, 
gives 
to 
that 
category 
its 
distinctive 
feature. 
One 
thing 
is 
like 
another 
only 
with 
reference 
to 
that 
in 
virtue 
of 
which 
it 
is 
such 
and 
such; 
thus 
this 
forms 
the 
peculiar 
mark 
of 
quality. 


We 
must 
not 
be 
disturbed 
because 
it 
may 
be 
argued 
that, 
though 
proposing 
to 
discuss 
the 
category 
of 
quality, 
we 
have 
included 
in 
it 
many 
relative 
terms. 
We 
did 
say 
that 
habits 
and 
dispositions 
were 
relative. 
In 
practically 
all 
such 
cases 
the 
genus 
is 
relative, 
the 
individual 
not. 
Thus 
knowledge, 
as 
a 
genus, 
is 
explained 
by 
reference 
to 
something 
else, 
for 
we 
mean 
a 
knowledge 
of 
something. 
But 
particular 
branches 
of 
knowledge 
are 
not 
thus 
explained. 
The 
knowledge 
of 
grammar 
is 
not 
relative 
to 
anything 
external, 
nor 
is 
the 
knowledge 
of 
music, 
but 
these, 
if 
relative 
at 
all, 
are 
relative 
only 
in 
virtue 
of 
their 
genera; 
thus 
grammar 
is 
said 
be 
the 
knowledge 
of 
something, 
not 
the 
grammar 
of 
something; 
similarly 
music 
is 
the 
knowledge 
of 
something, 
not 
the 
music 
of 
something. 


Thus 
individual 
branches 
of 
knowledge 
are 
not 
relative. 
And 
it 
is 
because 
we 
possess 
these 
individual 
branches 
of 
knowledge 
that 
we 
are 
said 
to 
be 
such 
and 
such. 
It 
is 
these 
that 
we 
actually 
possess: 
we 
are 
called 
experts 
because 
we 
possess 
knowledge 
in 
some 
particular 
branch. 
Those 
particular 
branches, 
therefore, 
of 
knowledge, 
in 
virtue 
of 
which 
we 
are 
sometimes 
said 
to 
be 
such 
and 
such, 
are 
themselves 
qualities, 
and 
are 
not 
relative. 
Further, 
if 
anything 
should 
happen 
to 
fall 
within 
both 
the 
category 
of 
quality 
and 
that 
of 
relation, 
there 
would 
be 
nothing 
extraordinary 
in 
classing 
it 
under 
both 
these 



heads. 


9 


Action 
and 
affection 
both 
admit 
of 
contraries 
and 
also 
of 
variation 
of 
degree. 
Heating 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
cooling, 
being 
heated 
of 
being 
cooled, 
being 
glad 
of 
being 
vexed. 
Thus 
they 
admit 
of 
contraries. 
They 
also 
admit 
of 
variation 
of 
degree: 
for 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
heat 
in 
a 
greater 
or 
less 
degree; 
also 
to 
be 
heated 
in 
a 
greater 
or 
less 
degree. 
Thus 
action 
and 
affection 
also 
admit 
of 
variation 
of 
degree. 
So 
much, 
then, 
is 
stated 
with 
regard 
to 
these 
categories. 


We 
spoke, 
moreover, 
of 
the 
category 
of 
position 
when 
we 
were 
dealing 
with 
that 
of 
relation, 
and 
stated 
that 
such 
terms 
derived 
their 
names 
from 
those 
of 
the 
corresponding 
attitudes. 


As 
for 
the 
rest, 
time, 
place, 
state, 
since 
they 
are 
easily 
intelligible, 
I 
say 
no 
more 
about 
them 
than 
was 
said 
at 
the 
beginning, 
that 
in 
the 
category 
of 
state 
are 
included 
such 
states 
as 
‘shod’, 
‘armed’, 
in 
that 
of 
place 
‘in 
the 
Lyceum’ 
and 
so 
on, 
as 
was 
explained 
before. 


10 


The 
proposed 
categories 
have, 
then, 
been 
adequately 
dealt 
with. 


We 
must 
next 
explain 
the 
various 
senses 
in 
which 
the 
term 
‘opposite’ 
is 
used. 
Things 
are 
said 
to 
be 
opposed 
in 
four 
senses: 
(i) 
as 
correlatives 
to 
one 
another, 
(ii) 
as 
contraries 
to 
one 
another, 
(iii) 
as 
privatives 
to 
positives, 
(iv) 
as 
affirmatives 
to 
negatives. 


Let 
me 
sketch 
my 
meaning 
in 
outline. 
An 
instance 
of 
the 
use 
of 
the 
word 
‘opposite’ 
with 
reference 
to 
correlatives 
is 
afforded 
by 
the 
expressions 
‘double’ 
and 
‘half’; 
with 
reference 
to 
contraries 
by 
‘bad’ 
and 
‘good’. 
Opposites 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
‘privatives’ 
and 
‘positives’ 
are’ 
blindness’ 
and 
‘sight’; 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
affirmatives 
and 
negatives, 
the 
propositions 
‘he 
sits’, 
‘he 
does 
not 
sit’. 


(i) 
Pairs 
of 
opposites 
which 
fall 
under 
the 
category 
of 
relation 
are 
explained 
by 
a 
reference 
of 
the 
one 
to 
the 
other, 
the 
reference 
being 
indicated 
by 
the 
preposition 
‘of’ 
or 
by 
some 
other 
preposition. 
Thus, 
double 
is 
a 
relative 
term, 
for 
that 
which 
is 
double 
is 
explained 
as 
the 
double 
of 
something. 
Knowledge, 
again, 
is 
the 
opposite 
of 
the 
thing 
known, 
in 
the 
same 

sense; 
and 
the 
thing 
known 
also 
is 
explained 
by 
its 
relation 
to 
its 
opposite, 
knowledge. 
For 
the 
thing 
known 
is 
explained 
as 
that 
which 
is 
known 
by 
something, 
that 
is, 
by 
knowledge. 
Such 
things, 
then, 
as 
are 
opposite 
the 
one 
to 
the 
other 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
being 
correlatives 
are 
explained 
by 
a 
reference 
of 
the 
one 
to 
the 
other. 


(ii) 
Pairs 
of 
opposites 
which 
are 
contraries 
are 
not 
in 
any 
way 
interdependent, 
but 
are 
contrary 
the 
one 
to 
the 
other. 
The 
good 
is 
not 
spoken 
of 
as 
the 
good 
of 
the 
had, 
but 
as 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
bad, 
nor 
is 
white 
spoken 
of 
as 
the 
white 
of 
the 
black, 
but 
as 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
black. 
These 
two 
types 
of 
opposition 
are 
therefore 
distinct. 
Those 
contraries 
which 
are 
such 
that 
the 
subjects 
in 
which 
they 
are 
naturally 
present, 
or 
of 
which 
they 
are 
predicated, 
must 
necessarily 
contain 
either 
the 
one 
or 
the 
other 
of 
them, 
have 
no 
intermediate, 
but 
those 
in 
the 
case 
of 
which 
no 
such 
necessity 
obtains, 
always 
have 
an 
intermediate. 
Thus 
disease 
and 
health 
are 
naturally 
present 
in 
the 
body 
of 
an 
animal, 
and 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
either 
the 
one 
or 
the 
other 
should 
be 
present 
in 
the 
body 
of 
an 
animal. 
Odd 
and 
even, 
again, 
are 
predicated 
of 
number, 
and 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
the 
one 
or 
the 
other 
should 
be 
present 
in 
numbers. 
Now 
there 
is 
no 
intermediate 
between 
the 
terms 
of 
either 
of 
these 
two 
pairs. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
in 
those 
contraries 
with 
regard 
to 
which 
no 
such 
necessity 
obtains, 
we 
find 
an 
intermediate. 
Blackness 
and 
whiteness 
are 
naturally 
present 
in 
the 
body, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
either 
the 
one 
or 
the 
other 
should 
be 
present 
in 
the 
body, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
is 
not 
true 
to 
say 
that 
everybody 
must 
be 
white 
or 
black. 
Badness 
and 
goodness, 
again, 
are 
predicated 
of 
man, 
and 
of 
many 
other 
things, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
either 
the 
one 
quality 
or 
the 
other 
should 
be 
present 
in 
that 
of 
which 
they 
are 
predicated: 
it 
is 
not 
true 
to 
say 
that 
everything 
that 
may 
be 
good 
or 
bad 
must 
be 
either 
good 
or 
bad. 
These 
pairs 
of 
contraries 
have 
intermediates: 
the 
intermediates 
between 
white 
and 
black 
are 
grey, 
sallow, 
and 
all 
the 
other 
colours 
that 
come 
between; 
the 
intermediate 
between 
good 
and 
bad 
is 
that 
which 
is 
neither 
the 
one 
nor 
the 
other. 
Some 
intermediate 
qualities 
have 
names, 
such 
as 
grey 
and 
sallow 
and 
all 
the 
other 
colours 
that 
come 
between 
white 
and 
black; 
in 
other 
cases, 
however, 
it 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
name 
the 
intermediate, 
but 
we 
must 
define 
it 
as 
that 
which 
is 
not 
either 
extreme, 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
that 
which 
is 
neither 
good 
nor 
bad, 
neither 
just 
nor 
unjust. 


(iii) 
‘privatives’ 
and 
‘Positives’ 
have 
reference 
to 
the 
same 
subject. 
Thus, 
sight 
and 
blindness 
have 
reference 
to 
the 
eye. 
It 
is 
a 
universal 
rule 
that 
each 

of 
a 
pair 
of 
opposites 
of 
this 
type 
has 
reference 
to 
that 
to 
which 
the 
particular 
‘positive’ 
is 
natural. 
We 
say 
that 
that 
is 
capable 
of 
some 
particular 
faculty 
or 
possession 
has 
suffered 
privation 
when 
the 
faculty 
or 
possession 
in 
question 
is 
in 
no 
way 
present 
in 
that 
in 
which, 
and 
at 
the 
time 
at 
which, 
it 
should 
naturally 
be 
present. 
We 
do 
not 
call 
that 
toothless 
which 
has 
not 
teeth, 
or 
that 
blind 
which 
has 
not 
sight, 
but 
rather 
that 
which 
has 
not 
teeth 
or 
sight 
at 
the 
time 
when 
by 
nature 
it 
should. 
For 
there 
are 
some 
creatures 
which 
from 
birth 
are 
without 
sight, 
or 
without 
teeth, 
but 
these 
are 
not 
called 
toothless 
or 
blind. 


To 
be 
without 
some 
faculty 
or 
to 
possess 
it 
is 
not 
the 
same 
as 
the 
corresponding 
‘privative’ 
or 
‘positive’. 
‘Sight’ 
is 
a 
‘positive’, 
‘blindness’ 
a 
‘privative’, 
but 
‘to 
possess 
sight’ 
is 
not 
equivalent 
to 
‘sight’, 
‘to 
be 
blind’ 
is 
not 
equivalent 
to 
‘blindness’. 
Blindness 
is 
a 
‘privative’, 
to 
be 
blind 
is 
to 
be 
in 
a 
state 
of 
privation, 
but 
is 
not 
a 
‘privative’. 
Moreover, 
if 
‘blindness’ 
were 
equivalent 
to 
‘being 
blind’, 
both 
would 
be 
predicated 
of 
the 
same 
subject; 
but 
though 
a 
man 
is 
said 
to 
be 
blind, 
he 
is 
by 
no 
means 
said 
to 
be 
blindness. 


To 
be 
in 
a 
state 
of 
‘possession’ 
is, 
it 
appears, 
the 
opposite 
of 
being 
in 
a 
state 
of 
‘privation’, 
just 
as 
‘positives’ 
and 
‘privatives’ 
themselves 
are 
opposite. 
There 
is 
the 
same 
type 
of 
antithesis 
in 
both 
cases; 
for 
just 
as 
blindness 
is 
opposed 
to 
sight, 
so 
is 
being 
blind 
opposed 
to 
having 
sight. 


That 
which 
is 
affirmed 
or 
denied 
is 
not 
itself 
affirmation 
or 
denial. 
By 
‘affirmation’ 
we 
mean 
an 
affirmative 
proposition, 
by 
‘denial’ 
a 
negative. 
Now, 
those 
facts 
which 
form 
the 
matter 
of 
the 
affirmation 
or 
denial 
are 
not 
propositions; 
yet 
these 
two 
are 
said 
to 
be 
opposed 
in 
the 
same 
sense 
as 
the 
affirmation 
and 
denial, 
for 
in 
this 
case 
also 
the 
type 
of 
antithesis 
is 
the 
same. 
For 
as 
the 
affirmation 
is 
opposed 
to 
the 
denial, 
as 
in 
the 
two 
propositions 
‘he 
sits’, 
‘he 
does 
not 
sit’, 
so 
also 
the 
fact 
which 
constitutes 
the 
matter 
of 
the 
proposition 
in 
one 
case 
is 
opposed 
to 
that 
in 
the 
other, 
his 
sitting, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
to 
his 
not 
sitting. 


It 
is 
evident 
that 
‘positives’ 
and 
‘privatives’ 
are 
not 
opposed 
each 
to 
each 
in 
the 
same 
sense 
as 
relatives. 
The 
one 
is 
not 
explained 
by 
reference 
to 
the 
other; 
sight 
is 
not 
sight 
of 
blindness, 
nor 
is 
any 
other 
preposition 
used 
to 
indicate 
the 
relation. 
Similarly 
blindness 
is 
not 
said 
to 
be 
blindness 
of 
sight, 
but 
rather, 
privation 
of 
sight. 
Relatives, 
moreover, 
reciprocate; 
if 
blindness, 
therefore, 
were 
a 
relative, 
there 
would 
be 
a 
reciprocity 
of 
relation 
between 
it 
and 
that 
with 
which 
it 
was 
correlative. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
the 
case. 
Sight 
is 
not 
called 
the 
sight 
of 
blindness. 


That 
those 
terms 
which 
fall 
under 
the 
heads 
of 
‘positives’ 
and 
‘privatives’ 



are 
not 
opposed 
each 
to 
each 
as 
contraries, 
either, 
is 
plain 
from 
the 
following 
facts: 
Of 
a 
pair 
of 
contraries 
such 
that 
they 
have 
no 
intermediate, 
one 
or 
the 
other 
must 
needs 
be 
present 
in 
the 
subject 
in 
which 
they 
naturally 
subsist, 
or 
of 
which 
they 
are 
predicated; 
for 
it 
is 
those, 
as 
we 
proved,’ 
in 
the 
case 
of 
which 
this 
necessity 
obtains, 
that 
have 
no 
intermediate. 
Moreover, 
we 
cited 
health 
and 
disease, 
odd 
and 
even, 
as 
instances. 
But 
those 
contraries 
which 
have 
an 
intermediate 
are 
not 
subject 
to 
any 
such 
necessity. 
It 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
every 
substance, 
receptive 
of 
such 
qualities, 
should 
be 
either 
black 
or 
white, 
cold 
or 
hot, 
for 
something 
intermediate 
between 
these 
contraries 
may 
very 
well 
be 
present 
in 
the 
subject. 
We 
proved, 
moreover, 
that 
those 
contraries 
have 
an 
intermediate 
in 
the 
case 
of 
which 
the 
said 
necessity 
does 
not 
obtain. 
Yet 
when 
one 
of 
the 
two 
contraries 
is 
a 
constitutive 
property 
of 
the 
subject, 
as 
it 
is 
a 
constitutive 
property 
of 
fire 
to 
be 
hot, 
of 
snow 
to 
be 
white, 
it 
is 
necessary 
determinately 
that 
one 
of 
the 
two 
contraries, 
not 
one 
or 
the 
other, 
should 
be 
present 
in 
the 
subject; 
for 
fire 
cannot 
be 
cold, 
or 
snow 
black. 
Thus, 
it 
is 
not 
the 
case 
here 
that 
one 
of 
the 
two 
must 
needs 
be 
present 
in 
every 
subject 
receptive 
of 
these 
qualities, 
but 
only 
in 
that 
subject 
of 
which 
the 
one 
forms 
a 
constitutive 
property. 
Moreover, 
in 
such 
cases 
it 
is 
one 
member 
of 
the 
pair 
determinately, 
and 
not 
either 
the 
one 
or 
the 
other, 
which 
must 
be 
present. 


In 
the 
case 
of 
‘positives’ 
and 
‘privatives’, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
neither 
of 
the 
aforesaid 
statements 
holds 
good. 
For 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
a 
subject 
receptive 
of 
the 
qualities 
should 
always 
have 
either 
the 
one 
or 
the 
other; 
that 
which 
has 
not 
yet 
advanced 
to 
the 
state 
when 
sight 
is 
natural 
is 
not 
said 
either 
to 
be 
blind 
or 
to 
see. 
Thus 
‘positives’ 
and 
‘privatives’ 
do 
not 
belong 
to 
that 
class 
of 
contraries 
which 
consists 
of 
those 
which 
have 
no 
intermediate. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
they 
do 
not 
belong 
either 
to 
that 
class 
which 
consists 
of 
contraries 
which 
have 
an 
intermediate. 
For 
under 
certain 
conditions 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
either 
the 
one 
or 
the 
other 
should 
form 
part 
of 
the 
constitution 
of 
every 
appropriate 
subject. 
For 
when 
a 
thing 
has 
reached 
the 
stage 
when 
it 
is 
by 
nature 
capable 
of 
sight, 
it 
will 
be 
said 
either 
to 
see 
or 
to 
be 
blind, 
and 
that 
in 
an 
indeterminate 
sense, 
signifying 
that 
the 
capacity 
may 
be 
either 
present 
or 
absent; 
for 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
either 
that 
it 
should 
see 
or 
that 
it 
should 
be 
blind, 
but 
that 
it 
should 
be 
either 
in 
the 
one 
state 
or 
in 
the 
other. 
Yet 
in 
the 
case 
of 
those 
contraries 
which 
have 
an 
intermediate 
we 
found 
that 
it 
was 
never 
necessary 
that 
either 
the 
one 
or 
the 
other 
should 
be 
present 
in 
every 
appropriate 
subject, 
but 
only 
that 
in 
certain 
subjects 
one 
of 
the 
pair 



should 
be 
present, 
and 
that 
in 
a 
determinate 
sense. 
It 
is, 
therefore, 
plain 
that 
‘positives’ 
and 
‘privatives’ 
are 
not 
opposed 
each 
to 
each 
in 
either 
of 
the 
senses 
in 
which 
contraries 
are 
opposed. 


Again, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
contraries, 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
there 
should 
be 
changes 
from 
either 
into 
the 
other, 
while 
the 
subject 
retains 
its 
identity, 
unless 
indeed 
one 
of 
the 
contraries 
is 
a 
constitutive 
property 
of 
that 
subject, 
as 
heat 
is 
of 
fire. 
For 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
that 
that 
which 
is 
healthy 
should 
become 
diseased, 
that 
which 
is 
white, 
black, 
that 
which 
is 
cold, 
hot, 
that 
which 
is 
good, 
bad, 
that 
which 
is 
bad, 
good. 
The 
bad 
man, 
if 
he 
is 
being 
brought 
into 
a 
better 
way 
of 
life 
and 
thought, 
may 
make 
some 
advance, 
however 
slight, 
and 
if 
he 
should 
once 
improve, 
even 
ever 
so 
little, 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
he 
might 
change 
completely, 
or 
at 
any 
rate 
make 
very 
great 
progress; 
for 
a 
man 
becomes 
more 
and 
more 
easily 
moved 
to 
virtue, 
however 
small 
the 
improvement 
was 
at 
first. 
It 
is, 
therefore, 
natural 
to 
suppose 
that 
he 
will 
make 
yet 
greater 
progress 
than 
he 
has 
made 
in 
the 
past; 
and 
as 
this 
process 
goes 
on, 
it 
will 
change 
him 
completely 
and 
establish 
him 
in 
the 
contrary 
state, 
provided 
he 
is 
not 
hindered 
by 
lack 
of 
time. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
‘positives’ 
and 
‘privatives’, 
however, 
change 
in 
both 
directions 
is 
impossible. 
There 
may 
be 
a 
change 
from 
possession 
to 
privation, 
but 
not 
from 
privation 
to 
possession. 
The 
man 
who 
has 
become 
blind 
does 
not 
regain 
his 
sight; 
the 
man 
who 
has 
become 
bald 
does 
not 
regain 
his 
hair; 
the 
man 
who 
has 
lost 
his 
teeth 
does 
not 
grow 
his 
grow 
a 
new 
set. 
(iv) 
Statements 
opposed 
as 
affirmation 
and 
negation 
belong 
manifestly 
to 
a 
class 
which 
is 
distinct, 
for 
in 
this 
case, 
and 
in 
this 
case 
only, 
it 
is 
necessary 
for 
the 
one 
opposite 
to 
be 
true 
and 
the 
other 
false. 


Neither 
in 
the 
case 
of 
contraries, 
nor 
in 
the 
case 
of 
correlatives, 
nor 
in 
the 
case 
of 
‘positives’ 
and 
‘privatives’, 
is 
it 
necessary 
for 
one 
to 
be 
true 
and 
the 
other 
false. 
Health 
and 
disease 
are 
contraries: 
neither 
of 
them 
is 
true 
or 
false. 
‘Double’ 
and 
‘half’ 
are 
opposed 
to 
each 
other 
as 
correlatives: 
neither 
of 
them 
is 
true 
or 
false. 
The 
case 
is 
the 
same, 
of 
course, 
with 
regard 
to 
‘positives’ 
and 
‘privatives’ 
such 
as 
‘sight’ 
and 
‘blindness’. 
In 
short, 
where 
there 
is 
no 
sort 
of 
combination 
of 
words, 
truth 
and 
falsity 
have 
no 
place, 
and 
all 
the 
opposites 
we 
have 
mentioned 
so 
far 
consist 
of 
simple 
words. 


At 
the 
same 
time, 
when 
the 
words 
which 
enter 
into 
opposed 
statements 
are 
contraries, 
these, 
more 
than 
any 
other 
set 
of 
opposites, 
would 
seem 
to 
claim 
this 
characteristic. 
‘Socrates 
is 
ill’ 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
‘Socrates 
is 
well’, 
but 
not 
even 
of 
such 
composite 
expressions 
is 
it 
true 
to 
say 
that 
one 
of 
the 
pair 
must 
always 
be 
true 
and 
the 
other 
false. 
For 
if 
Socrates 
exists, 
one 
will 
be 
true 
and 



the 
other 
false, 
but 
if 
he 
does 
not 
exist, 
both 
will 
be 
false; 
for 
neither 
‘Socrates 
is 
ill’ 
nor 
‘Socrates 
is 
well’ 
is 
true, 
if 
Socrates 
does 
not 
exist 
at 
all. 


In 
the 
case 
of 
‘positives’ 
and 
‘privatives’, 
if 
the 
subject 
does 
not 
exist 
at 
all, 
neither 
proposition 
is 
true, 
but 
even 
if 
the 
subject 
exists, 
it 
is 
not 
always 
the 
fact 
that 
one 
is 
true 
and 
the 
other 
false. 
For 
‘Socrates 
has 
sight’ 
is 
the 
opposite 
of 
‘Socrates 
is 
blind’ 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
word 
‘opposite’ 
which 
applies 
to 
possession 
and 
privation. 
Now 
if 
Socrates 
exists, 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
one 
should 
be 
true 
and 
the 
other 
false, 
for 
when 
he 
is 
not 
yet 
able 
to 
acquire 
the 
power 
of 
vision, 
both 
are 
false, 
as 
also 
if 
Socrates 
is 
altogether 
non-existent. 


But 
in 
the 
case 
of 
affirmation 
and 
negation, 
whether 
the 
subject 
exists 
or 
not, 
one 
is 
always 
false 
and 
the 
other 
true. 
For 
manifestly, 
if 
Socrates 
exists, 
one 
of 
the 
two 
propositions 
‘Socrates 
is 
ill’, 
‘Socrates 
is 
not 
ill’, 
is 
true, 
and 
the 
other 
false. 
This 
is 
likewise 
the 
case 
if 
he 
does 
not 
exist; 
for 
if 
he 
does 
not 
exist, 
to 
say 
that 
he 
is 
ill 
is 
false, 
to 
say 
that 
he 
is 
not 
ill 
is 
true. 
Thus 
it 
is 
in 
the 
case 
of 
those 
opposites 
only, 
which 
are 
opposite 
in 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
the 
term 
is 
used 
with 
reference 
to 
affirmation 
and 
negation, 
that 
the 
rule 
holds 
good, 
that 
one 
of 
the 
pair 
must 
be 
true 
and 
the 
other 
false. 


That 
the 
contrary 
of 
a 
good 
is 
an 
evil 
is 
shown 
by 
induction: 
the 
contrary 
of 
health 
is 
disease, 
of 
courage, 
cowardice, 
and 
so 
on. 
But 
the 
contrary 
of 
an 
evil 
is 
sometimes 
a 
good, 
sometimes 
an 
evil. 
For 
defect, 
which 
is 
an 
evil, 
has 
excess 
for 
its 
contrary, 
this 
also 
being 
an 
evil, 
and 
the 
mean. 
which 
is 
a 
good, 
is 
equally 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
one 
and 
of 
the 
other. 
It 
is 
only 
in 
a 
few 
cases, 
however, 
that 
we 
see 
instances 
of 
this: 
in 
most, 
the 
contrary 
of 
an 
evil 
is 
a 
good. 


In 
the 
case 
of 
contraries, 
it 
is 
not 
always 
necessary 
that 
if 
one 
exists 
the 
other 
should 
also 
exist: 
for 
if 
all 
become 
healthy 
there 
will 
be 
health 
and 
no 
disease, 
and 
again, 
if 
everything 
turns 
white, 
there 
will 
be 
white, 
but 
no 
black. 
Again, 
since 
the 
fact 
that 
Socrates 
is 
ill 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
Socrates 
is 
well, 
and 
two 
contrary 
conditions 
cannot 
both 
obtain 
in 
one 
and 
the 
same 
individual 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
both 
these 
contraries 
could 
not 
exist 
at 
once: 
for 
if 
that 
Socrates 
was 
well 
was 
a 
fact, 
then 
that 
Socrates 
was 
ill 
could 
not 
possibly 
be 
one. 


It 
is 
plain 
that 
contrary 
attributes 
must 
needs 
be 
present 
in 
subjects 
which 



belong 
to 
the 
same 
species 
or 
genus. 
Disease 
and 
health 
require 
as 
their 
subject 
the 
body 
of 
an 
animal; 
white 
and 
black 
require 
a 
body, 
without 
further 
qualification; 
justice 
and 
injustice 
require 
as 
their 
subject 
the 
human 
soul. 


Moreover, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
pairs 
of 
contraries 
should 
in 
all 
cases 
either 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
genus 
or 
belong 
to 
contrary 
genera 
or 
be 
themselves 
genera. 
White 
and 
black 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
genus, 
colour; 
justice 
and 
injustice, 
to 
contrary 
genera, 
virtue 
and 
vice; 
while 
good 
and 
evil 
do 
not 
belong 
to 
genera, 
but 
are 
themselves 
actual 
genera, 
with 
terms 
under 
them. 


There 
are 
four 
senses 
in 
which 
one 
thing 
can 
be 
said 
to 
be 
‘prior’ 
to 
another. 
Primarily 
and 
most 
properly 
the 
term 
has 
reference 
to 
time: 
in 
this 
sense 
the 
word 
is 
used 
to 
indicate 
that 
one 
thing 
is 
older 
or 
more 
ancient 
than 
another, 
for 
the 
expressions 
‘older’ 
and 
‘more 
ancient’ 
imply 
greater 
length 
of 
time. 


Secondly, 
one 
thing 
is 
said 
to 
be 
‘prior’ 
to 
another 
when 
the 
sequence 
of 
their 
being 
cannot 
be 
reversed. 
In 
this 
sense 
‘one’ 
is 
‘prior’ 
to 
‘two’. 
For 
if 
‘two’ 
exists, 
it 
follows 
directly 
that 
‘one’ 
must 
exist, 
but 
if 
‘one’ 
exists, 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
necessarily 
that 
‘two’ 
exists: 
thus 
the 
sequence 
subsisting 
cannot 
be 
reversed. 
It 
is 
agreed, 
then, 
that 
when 
the 
sequence 
of 
two 
things 
cannot 
be 
reversed, 
then 
that 
one 
on 
which 
the 
other 
depends 
is 
called 
‘prior’ 
to 
that 
other. 


In 
the 
third 
place, 
the 
term 
‘prior’ 
is 
used 
with 
reference 
to 
any 
order, 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
science 
and 
of 
oratory. 
For 
in 
sciences 
which 
use 
demonstration 
there 
is 
that 
which 
is 
prior 
and 
that 
which 
is 
posterior 
in 
order; 
in 
geometry, 
the 
elements 
are 
prior 
to 
the 
propositions; 
in 
reading 
and 
writing, 
the 
letters 
of 
the 
alphabet 
are 
prior 
to 
the 
syllables. 
Similarly, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
speeches, 
the 
exordium 
is 
prior 
in 
order 
to 
the 
narrative. 


Besides 
these 
senses 
of 
the 
word, 
there 
is 
a 
fourth. 
That 
which 
is 
better 
and 
more 
honourable 
is 
said 
to 
have 
a 
natural 
priority. 
In 
common 
parlance 
men 
speak 
of 
those 
whom 
they 
honour 
and 
love 
as 
‘coming 
first’ 
with 
them. 
This 
sense 
of 
the 
word 
is 
perhaps 
the 
most 
far-fetched. 


Such, 
then, 
are 
the 
different 
senses 
in 
which 
the 
term 
‘prior’ 
is 
used. 


Yet 
it 
would 
seem 
that 
besides 
those 
mentioned 
there 
is 
yet 
another. 
For 
in 
those 
things, 
the 
being 
of 
each 
of 
which 
implies 
that 
of 
the 
other, 
that 
which 



is 
in 
any 
way 
the 
cause 
may 
reasonably 
be 
said 
to 
be 
by 
nature 
‘prior’ 
to 
the 
effect. 
It 
is 
plain 
that 
there 
are 
instances 
of 
this. 
The 
fact 
of 
the 
being 
of 
a 
man 
carries 
with 
it 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
proposition 
that 
he 
is, 
and 
the 
implication 
is 
reciprocal: 
for 
if 
a 
man 
is, 
the 
proposition 
wherein 
we 
allege 
that 
he 
is 
true, 
and 
conversely, 
if 
the 
proposition 
wherein 
we 
allege 
that 
he 
is 
true, 
then 
he 
is. 
The 
true 
proposition, 
however, 
is 
in 
no 
way 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
being 
of 
the 
man, 
but 
the 
fact 
of 
the 
man’s 
being 
does 
seem 
somehow 
to 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
proposition, 
for 
the 
truth 
or 
falsity 
of 
the 
proposition 
depends 
on 
the 
fact 
of 
the 
man’s 
being 
or 
not 
being. 


Thus 
the 
word 
‘prior’ 
may 
be 
used 
in 
five 
senses. 


The 
term 
‘simultaneous’ 
is 
primarily 
and 
most 
appropriately 
applied 
to 
those 
things 
the 
genesis 
of 
the 
one 
of 
which 
is 
simultaneous 
with 
that 
of 
the 
other; 
for 
in 
such 
cases 
neither 
is 
prior 
or 
posterior 
to 
the 
other. 
Such 
things 
are 
said 
to 
be 
simultaneous 
in 
point 
of 
time. 
Those 
things, 
again, 
are 
‘simultaneous’ 
in 
point 
of 
nature, 
the 
being 
of 
each 
of 
which 
involves 
that 
of 
the 
other, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
neither 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
other’s 
being. 
This 
is 
the 
case 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
double 
and 
the 
half, 
for 
these 
are 
reciprocally 
dependent, 
since, 
if 
there 
is 
a 
double, 
there 
is 
also 
a 
half, 
and 
if 
there 
is 
a 
half, 
there 
is 
also 
a 
double, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
neither 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
being 
of 
the 
other. 


Again, 
those 
species 
which 
are 
distinguished 
one 
from 
another 
and 
opposed 
one 
to 
another 
within 
the 
same 
genus 
are 
said 
to 
be 
‘simultaneous’ 
in 
nature. 
I 
mean 
those 
species 
which 
are 
distinguished 
each 
from 
each 
by 
one 
and 
the 
same 
method 
of 
division. 
Thus 
the 
‘winged’ 
species 
is 
simultaneous 
with 
the 
‘terrestrial’ 
and 
the 
‘water’ 
species. 
These 
are 
distinguished 
within 
the 
same 
genus, 
and 
are 
opposed 
each 
to 
each, 
for 
the 
genus 
‘animal’ 
has 
the 
‘winged’, 
the 
‘terrestrial’, 
and 
the 
‘water’ 
species, 
and 
no 
one 
of 
these 
is 
prior 
or 
posterior 
to 
another; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
all 
such 
things 
appear 
to 
be 
‘simultaneous’ 
in 
nature. 
Each 
of 
these 
also, 
the 
terrestrial, 
the 
winged, 
and 
the 
water 
species, 
can 
be 
divided 
again 
into 
subspecies. 
Those 
species, 
then, 
also 
will 
be 
‘simultaneous’ 
point 
of 
nature, 
which, 
belonging 
to 
the 
same 
genus, 
are 
distinguished 
each 
from 
each 
by 
one 
and 
the 
same 
method 
of 
differentiation. 


But 
genera 
are 
prior 
to 
species, 
for 
the 
sequence 
of 
their 
being 
cannot 
be 



reversed. 
If 
there 
is 
the 
species 
‘water-animal’, 
there 
will 
be 
the 
genus 
‘animal’, 
but 
granted 
the 
being 
of 
the 
genus 
‘animal’, 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
necessarily 
that 
there 
will 
be 
the 
species 
‘water-animal’. 


Those 
things, 
therefore, 
are 
said 
to 
be 
‘simultaneous’ 
in 
nature, 
the 
being 
of 
each 
of 
which 
involves 
that 
of 
the 
other, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
neither 
is 
in 
any 
way 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
other’s 
being; 
those 
species, 
also, 
which 
are 
distinguished 
each 
from 
each 
and 
opposed 
within 
the 
same 
genus. 
Those 
things, 
moreover, 
are 
‘simultaneous’ 
in 
the 
unqualified 
sense 
of 
the 
word 
which 
come 
into 
being 
at 
the 
same 
time. 


There 
are 
six 
sorts 
of 
movement: 
generation, 
destruction, 
increase, 
diminution, 
alteration, 
and 
change 
of 
place. 


It 
is 
evident 
in 
all 
but 
one 
case 
that 
all 
these 
sorts 
of 
movement 
are 
distinct 
each 
from 
each. 
Generation 
is 
distinct 
from 
destruction, 
increase 
and 
change 
of 
place 
from 
diminution, 
and 
so 
on. 
But 
in 
the 
case 
of 
alteration 
it 
may 
be 
argued 
that 
the 
process 
necessarily 
implies 
one 
or 
other 
of 
the 
other 
five 
sorts 
of 
motion. 
This 
is 
not 
true, 
for 
we 
may 
say 
that 
all 
affections, 
or 
nearly 
all, 
produce 
in 
us 
an 
alteration 
which 
is 
distinct 
from 
all 
other 
sorts 
of 
motion, 
for 
that 
which 
is 
affected 
need 
not 
suffer 
either 
increase 
or 
diminution 
or 
any 
of 
the 
other 
sorts 
of 
motion. 
Thus 
alteration 
is 
a 
distinct 
sort 
of 
motion; 
for, 
if 
it 
were 
not, 
the 
thing 
altered 
would 
not 
only 
be 
altered, 
but 
would 
forthwith 
necessarily 
suffer 
increase 
or 
diminution 
or 
some 
one 
of 
the 
other 
sorts 
of 
motion 
in 
addition; 
which 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact 
is 
not 
the 
case. 
Similarly 
that 
which 
was 
undergoing 
the 
process 
of 
increase 
or 
was 
subject 
to 
some 
other 
sort 
of 
motion 
would, 
if 
alteration 
were 
not 
a 
distinct 
form 
of 
motion, 
necessarily 
be 
subject 
to 
alteration 
also. 
But 
there 
are 
some 
things 
which 
undergo 
increase 
but 
yet 
not 
alteration. 
The 
square, 
for 
instance, 
if 
a 
gnomon 
is 
applied 
to 
it, 
undergoes 
increase 
but 
not 
alteration, 
and 
so 
it 
is 
with 
all 
other 
figures 
of 
this 
sort. 
Alteration 
and 
increase, 
therefore, 
are 
distinct. 


Speaking 
generally, 
rest 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
motion. 
But 
the 
different 
forms 
of 
motion 
have 
their 
own 
contraries 
in 
other 
forms; 
thus 
destruction 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
generation, 
diminution 
of 
increase, 
rest 
in 
a 
place, 
of 
change 
of 
place. 
As 
for 
this 
last, 
change 
in 
the 
reverse 
direction 
would 
seem 
to 
be 
most 
truly 
its 
contrary; 
thus 
motion 
upwards 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
motion 
downwards 
and 
vice 
versa. 



In 
the 
case 
of 
that 
sort 
of 
motion 
which 
yet 
remains, 
of 
those 
that 
have 
been 
enumerated, 
it 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
state 
what 
is 
its 
contrary. 
It 
appears 
to 
have 
no 
contrary, 
unless 
one 
should 
define 
the 
contrary 
here 
also 
either 
as 
‘rest 
in 
its 
quality’ 
or 
as 
‘change 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
contrary 
quality’, 
just 
as 
we 
defined 
the 
contrary 
of 
change 
of 
place 
either 
as 
rest 
in 
a 
place 
or 
as 
change 
in 
the 
reverse 
direction. 
For 
a 
thing 
is 
altered 
when 
change 
of 
quality 
takes 
place; 
therefore 
either 
rest 
in 
its 
quality 
or 
change 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
contrary 
may 
be 
called 
the 
contrary 
of 
this 
qualitative 
form 
of 
motion. 
In 
this 
way 
becoming 
white 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
becoming 
black; 
there 
is 
alteration 
in 
the 
contrary 
direction, 
since 
a 
change 
of 
a 
qualitative 
nature 
takes 
place. 


The 
term 
‘to 
have’ 
is 
used 
in 
various 
senses. 
In 
the 
first 
place 
it 
is 
used 
with 
reference 
to 
habit 
or 
disposition 
or 
any 
other 
quality, 
for 
we 
are 
said 
to 
‘have’ 
a 
piece 
of 
knowledge 
or 
a 
virtue. 
Then, 
again, 
it 
has 
reference 
to 
quantity, 
as, 
for 
instance, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
man’s 
height; 
for 
he 
is 
said 
to 
‘have’ 
a 
height 
of 
three 
or 
four 
cubits. 
It 
is 
used, 
moreover, 
with 
regard 
to 
apparel, 
a 
man 
being 
said 
to 
‘have’ 
a 
coat 
or 
tunic; 
or 
in 
respect 
of 
something 
which 
we 
have 
on 
a 
part 
of 
ourselves, 
as 
a 
ring 
on 
the 
hand: 
or 
in 
respect 
of 
something 
which 
is 
a 
part 
of 
us, 
as 
hand 
or 
foot. 
The 
term 
refers 
also 
to 
content, 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
vessel 
and 
wheat, 
or 
of 
a 
jar 
and 
wine; 
a 
jar 
is 
said 
to 
‘have’ 
wine, 
and 
a 
corn-measure 
wheat. 
The 
expression 
in 
such 
cases 
has 
reference 
to 
content. 
Or 
it 
refers 
to 
that 
which 
has 
been 
acquired; 
we 
are 
said 
to 
‘have’ 
a 
house 
or 
a 
field. 
A 
man 
is 
also 
said 
to 
‘have’ 
a 
wife, 
and 
a 
wife 
a 
husband, 
and 
this 
appears 
to 
be 
the 
most 
remote 
meaning 
of 
the 
term, 
for 
by 
the 
use 
of 
it 
we 
mean 
simply 
that 
the 
husband 
lives 
with 
the 
wife. 


Other 
senses 
of 
the 
word 
might 
perhaps 
be 
found, 
but 
the 
most 
ordinary 
ones 
have 
all 
been 
enumerated. 



On 
Interpretation 


Translated

First 
we 
must 
define 
the 
terms 
‘noun’ 
and 
‘verb’, 
then 
the 
terms 
‘denial’ 
and 
‘affirmation’, 
then 
‘proposition’ 
and 
‘sentence.’ 


Spoken 
words 
are 
the 
symbols 
of 
mental 
experience 
and 
written 
words 
are 
the 
symbols 
of 
spoken 
words. 
Just 
as 
all 
men 
have 
not 
the 
same 
writing, 
so 
all 
men 
have 
not 
the 
same 
speech 
sounds, 
but 
the 
mental 
experiences, 
which 
these 
directly 
symbolize, 
are 
the 
same 
for 
all, 
as 
also 
are 
those 
things 
of 
which 
our 
experiences 
are 
the 
images. 
This 
matter 
has, 
however, 
been 
discussed 
in 
my 
treatise 
about 
the 
soul, 
for 
it 
belongs 
to 
an 
investigation 
distinct 
from 
that 
which 
lies 
before 
us. 


As 
there 
are 
in 
the 
mind 
thoughts 
which 
do 
not 
involve 
truth 
or 
falsity, 
and 
also 
those 
which 
must 
be 
either 
true 
or 
false, 
so 
it 
is 
in 
speech. 
For 
truth 
and 
falsity 
imply 
combination 
and 
separation. 
Nouns 
and 
verbs, 
provided 
nothing 
is 
added, 
are 
like 
thoughts 
without 
combination 
or 
separation; 
‘man’ 
and 
‘white’, 
as 
isolated 
terms, 
are 
not 
yet 
either 
true 
or 
false. 
In 
proof 
of 
this, 
consider 
the 
word 
‘goat-stag.’ 
It 
has 
significance, 
but 
there 
is 
no 
truth 
or 
falsity 
about 
it, 
unless 
‘is’ 
or 
‘is 
not’ 
is 
added, 
either 
in 
the 
present 
or 
in 
some 
other 
tense. 


2 


By 
a 
noun 
we 
mean 
a 
sound 
significant 
by 
convention, 
which 
has 
no 
reference 
to 
time, 
and 
of 
which 
no 
part 
is 
significant 
apart 
from 
the 
rest. 
In 
the 
noun 
‘Fairsteed,’ 
the 
part 
‘steed’ 
has 
no 
significance 
in 
and 
by 
itself, 
as 
in 
the 
phrase 
‘fair 
steed.’ 
Yet 
there 
is 
a 
difference 
between 
simple 
and 
composite 
nouns; 
for 
in 
the 
former 
the 
part 
is 
in 
no 
way 
significant, 
in 
the 
latter 
it 
contributes 
to 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
whole, 
although 
it 
has 
not 
an 
independent 
meaning. 
Thus 
in 
the 
word 
‘pirate-boat’ 
the 
word 
‘boat’ 
has 
no 
meaning 
except 
as 
part 
of 
the 
whole 
word. 


The 
limitation 
‘by 
convention’ 
was 
introduced 
because 
nothing 
is 
by 



nature 
a 
noun 
or 
name-it 
is 
only 
so 
when 
it 
becomes 
a 
symbol; 
inarticulate 
sounds, 
such 
as 
those 
which 
brutes 
produce, 
are 
significant, 
yet 
none 
of 
these 
constitutes 
a 
noun. 


The 
expression 
‘not-man’ 
is 
not 
a 
noun. 
There 
is 
indeed 
no 
recognized 
term 
by 
which 
we 
may 
denote 
such 
an 
expression, 
for 
it 
is 
not 
a 
sentence 
or 
a 
denial. 
Let 
it 
then 
be 
called 
an 
indefinite 
noun. 


The 
expressions 
‘of 
Philo’, 
‘to 
Philo’, 
and 
so 
on, 
constitute 
not 
nouns, 
but 
cases 
of 
a 
noun. 
The 
definition 
of 
these 
cases 
of 
a 
noun 
is 
in 
other 
respects 
the 
same 
as 
that 
of 
the 
noun 
proper, 
but, 
when 
coupled 
with 
‘is’, 
‘was’, 
or 
will 
be’, 
they 
do 
not, 
as 
they 
are, 
form 
a 
proposition 
either 
true 
or 
false, 
and 
this 
the 
noun 
proper 
always 
does, 
under 
these 
conditions. 
Take 
the 
words 
‘of 
Philo 
is’ 
or 
‘of 
or 
‘of 
Philo 
is 
not’; 
these 
words 
do 
not, 
as 
they 
stand, 
form 
either 
a 
true 
or 
a 
false 
proposition. 


A 
verb 
is 
that 
which, 
in 
addition 
to 
its 
proper 
meaning, 
carries 
with 
it 
the 
notion 
of 
time. 
No 
part 
of 
it 
has 
any 
independent 
meaning, 
and 
it 
is 
a 
sign 
of 
something 
said 
of 
something 
else. 


I 
will 
explain 
what 
I 
mean 
by 
saying 
that 
it 
carries 
with 
it 
the 
notion 
of 
time. 
‘Health’ 
is 
a 
noun, 
but 
‘is 
healthy’ 
is 
a 
verb; 
for 
besides 
its 
proper 
meaning 
it 
indicates 
the 
present 
existence 
of 
the 
state 
in 
question. 


Moreover, 
a 
verb 
is 
always 
a 
sign 
of 
something 
said 
of 
something 
else, 
i.e. 
of 
something 
either 
predicable 
of 
or 
present 
in 
some 
other 
thing. 


Such 
expressions 
as 
‘is 
not-healthy’, 
‘is 
not, 
ill’, 
I 
do 
not 
describe 
as 
verbs; 
for 
though 
they 
carry 
the 
additional 
note 
of 
time, 
and 
always 
form 
a 
predicate, 
there 
is 
no 
specified 
name 
for 
this 
variety; 
but 
let 
them 
be 
called 
indefinite 
verbs, 
since 
they 
apply 
equally 
well 
to 
that 
which 
exists 
and 
to 
that 
which 
does 
not. 


Similarly 
‘he 
was 
healthy’, 
‘he 
will 
be 
healthy’, 
are 
not 
verbs, 
but 
tenses 
of 
a 
verb; 
the 
difference 
lies 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
verb 
indicates 
present 
time, 
while 
the 
tenses 
of 
the 
verb 
indicate 
those 
times 
which 
lie 
outside 
the 
present. 


Verbs 
in 
and 
by 
themselves 
are 
substantival 
and 
have 
significance, 
for 
he 
who 
uses 
such 
expressions 
arrests 
the 
hearer’s 
mind, 
and 
fixes 
his 
attention; 
but 
they 
do 
not, 
as 
they 
stand, 
express 
any 
judgement, 
either 
positive 
or 
negative. 
For 
neither 
are 
‘to 
be’ 
and 
‘not 
to 
be’ 
the 
participle 
‘being’ 
significant 
of 
any 
fact, 
unless 
something 
is 
added; 
for 
they 
do 
not 
themselves 



indicate 
anything, 
but 
imply 
a 
copulation, 
of 
which 
we 
cannot 
form 
a 
conception 
apart 
from 
the 
things 
coupled. 


4 


A 
sentence 
is 
a 
significant 
portion 
of 
speech, 
some 
parts 
of 
which 
have 
an 
independent 
meaning, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
as 
an 
utterance, 
though 
not 
as 
the 
expression 
of 
any 
positive 
judgement. 
Let 
me 
explain. 
The 
word 
‘human’ 
has 
meaning, 
but 
does 
not 
constitute 
a 
proposition, 
either 
positive 
or 
negative. 
It 
is 
only 
when 
other 
words 
are 
added 
that 
the 
whole 
will 
form 
an 
affirmation 
or 
denial. 
But 
if 
we 
separate 
one 
syllable 
of 
the 
word 
‘human’ 
from 
the 
other, 
it 
has 
no 
meaning; 
similarly 
in 
the 
word 
‘mouse’, 
the 
part 
‘ouse’ 
has 
no 
meaning 
in 
itself, 
but 
is 
merely 
a 
sound. 
In 
composite 
words, 
indeed, 
the 
parts 
contribute 
to 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
whole; 
yet, 
as 
has 
been 
pointed 
out, 
they 
have 
not 
an 
independent 
meaning. 


Every 
sentence 
has 
meaning, 
not 
as 
being 
the 
natural 
means 
by 
which 
a 
physical 
faculty 
is 
realized, 
but, 
as 
we 
have 
said, 
by 
convention. 
Yet 
every 
sentence 
is 
not 
a 
proposition; 
only 
such 
are 
propositions 
as 
have 
in 
them 
either 
truth 
or 
falsity. 
Thus 
a 
prayer 
is 
a 
sentence, 
but 
is 
neither 
true 
nor 
false. 


Let 
us 
therefore 
dismiss 
all 
other 
types 
of 
sentence 
but 
the 
proposition, 
for 
this 
last 
concerns 
our 
present 
inquiry, 
whereas 
the 
investigation 
of 
the 
others 
belongs 
rather 
to 
the 
study 
of 
rhetoric 
or 
of 
poetry. 


5 


The 
first 
class 
of 
simple 
propositions 
is 
the 
simple 
affirmation, 
the 
next, 
the 
simple 
denial; 
all 
others 
are 
only 
one 
by 
conjunction. 


Every 
proposition 
must 
contain 
a 
verb 
or 
the 
tense 
of 
a 
verb. 
The 
phrase 
which 
defines 
the 
species 
‘man’, 
if 
no 
verb 
in 
present, 
past, 
or 
future 
time 
be 
added, 
is 
not 
a 
proposition. 
It 
may 
be 
asked 
how 
the 
expression 
‘a 
footed 
animal 
with 
two 
feet’ 
can 
be 
called 
single; 
for 
it 
is 
not 
the 
circumstance 
that 
the 
words 
follow 
in 
unbroken 
succession 
that 
effects 
the 
unity. 
This 
inquiry, 
however, 
finds 
its 
place 
in 
an 
investigation 
foreign 
to 
that 
before 
us. 


We 
call 
those 
propositions 
single 
which 
indicate 
a 
single 
fact, 
or 
the 
conjunction 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
which 
results 
in 
unity: 
those 
propositions, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
are 
separate 
and 
many 
in 
number, 
which 
indicate 
many 
facts, 
or 



whose 
parts 
have 
no 
conjunction. 


Let 
us, 
moreover, 
consent 
to 
call 
a 
noun 
or 
a 
verb 
an 
expression 
only, 
and 
not 
a 
proposition, 
since 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
for 
a 
man 
to 
speak 
in 
this 
way 
when 
he 
is 
expressing 
something, 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
make 
a 
statement, 
whether 
his 
utterance 
is 
an 
answer 
to 
a 
question 
or 
an 
act 
of 
his 
own 
initiation. 


To 
return: 
of 
propositions 
one 
kind 
is 
simple, 
i.e. 
that 
which 
asserts 
or 
denies 
something 
of 
something, 
the 
other 
composite, 
i.e. 
that 
which 
is 
compounded 
of 
simple 
propositions. 
A 
simple 
proposition 
is 
a 
statement, 
with 
meaning, 
as 
to 
the 
presence 
of 
something 
in 
a 
subject 
or 
its 
absence, 
in 
the 
present, 
past, 
or 
future, 
according 
to 
the 
divisions 
of 
time. 


6 


An 
affirmation 
is 
a 
positive 
assertion 
of 
something 
about 
something, 
a 
denial 
a 
negative 
assertion. 


Now 
it 
is 
possible 
both 
to 
affirm 
and 
to 
deny 
the 
presence 
of 
something 
which 
is 
present 
or 
of 
something 
which 
is 
not, 
and 
since 
these 
same 
affirmations 
and 
denials 
are 
possible 
with 
reference 
to 
those 
times 
which 
lie 
outside 
the 
present, 
it 
would 
be 
possible 
to 
contradict 
any 
affirmation 
or 
denial. 
Thus 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
every 
affirmation 
has 
an 
opposite 
denial, 
and 
similarly 
every 
denial 
an 
opposite 
affirmation. 


We 
will 
call 
such 
a 
pair 
of 
propositions 
a 
pair 
of 
contradictories. 
Those 
positive 
and 
negative 
propositions 
are 
said 
to 
be 
contradictory 
which 
have 
the 
same 
subject 
and 
predicate. 
The 
identity 
of 
subject 
and 
of 
predicate 
must 
not 
be 
‘equivocal’. 
Indeed 
there 
are 
definitive 
qualifications 
besides 
this, 
which 
we 
make 
to 
meet 
the 
casuistries 
of 
sophists. 


7 


Some 
things 
are 
universal, 
others 
individual. 
By 
the 
term 
‘universal’ 
I 
mean 
that 
which 
is 
of 
such 
a 
nature 
as 
to 
be 
predicated 
of 
many 
subjects, 
by 
‘individual’ 
that 
which 
is 
not 
thus 
predicated. 
Thus 
‘man’ 
is 
a 
universal, 
‘Callias’ 
an 
individual. 


Our 
propositions 
necessarily 
sometimes 
concern 
a 
universal 
subject, 
sometimes 
an 
individual. 


If, 
then, 
a 
man 
states 
a 
positive 
and 
a 
negative 
proposition 
of 
universal 



character 
with 
regard 
to 
a 
universal, 
these 
two 
propositions 
are 
‘contrary’. 
By 
the 
expression 
‘a 
proposition 
of 
universal 
character 
with 
regard 
to 
a 
universal’, 
such 
propositions 
as 
‘every 
man 
is 
white’, 
‘no 
man 
is 
white’ 
are 
meant. 
When, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
positive 
and 
negative 
propositions, 
though 
they 
have 
regard 
to 
a 
universal, 
are 
yet 
not 
of 
universal 
character, 
they 
will 
not 
be 
contrary, 
albeit 
the 
meaning 
intended 
is 
sometimes 
contrary. 
As 
instances 
of 
propositions 
made 
with 
regard 
to 
a 
universal, 
but 
not 
of 
universal 
character, 
we 
may 
take 
the 
‘propositions 
‘man 
is 
white’, 
‘man 
is 
not 
white’. 
‘Man’ 
is 
a 
universal, 
but 
the 
proposition 
is 
not 
made 
as 
of 
universal 
character; 
for 
the 
word 
‘every’ 
does 
not 
make 
the 
subject 
a 
universal, 
but 
rather 
gives 
the 
proposition 
a 
universal 
character. 
If, 
however, 
both 
predicate 
and 
subject 
are 
distributed, 
the 
proposition 
thus 
constituted 
is 
contrary 
to 
truth; 
no 
affirmation 
will, 
under 
such 
circumstances, 
be 
true. 
The 
proposition 
‘every 
man 
is 
every 
animal’ 
is 
an 
example 
of 
this 
type. 


An 
affirmation 
is 
opposed 
to 
a 
denial 
in 
the 
sense 
which 
I 
denote 
by 
the 
term 
‘contradictory’, 
when, 
while 
the 
subject 
remains 
the 
same, 
the 
affirmation 
is 
of 
universal 
character 
and 
the 
denial 
is 
not. 
The 
affirmation 
‘every 
man 
is 
white’ 
is 
the 
contradictory 
of 
the 
denial 
‘not 
every 
man 
is 
white’, 
or 
again, 
the 
proposition 
‘no 
man 
is 
white’ 
is 
the 
contradictory 
of 
the 
proposition 
‘some 
men 
are 
white’. 
But 
propositions 
are 
opposed 
as 
contraries 
when 
both 
the 
affirmation 
and 
the 
denial 
are 
universal, 
as 
in 
the 
sentences 
‘every 
man 
is 
white’, 
‘no 
man 
is 
white’, 
‘every 
man 
is 
just’, 
‘no 
man 
is 
just’. 


We 
see 
that 
in 
a 
pair 
of 
this 
sort 
both 
propositions 
cannot 
be 
true, 
but 
the 
contradictories 
of 
a 
pair 
of 
contraries 
can 
sometimes 
both 
be 
true 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
same 
subject; 
for 
instance 
‘not 
every 
man 
is 
white’ 
and 
some 
men 
are 
white’ 
are 
both 
true. 
Of 
such 
corresponding 
positive 
and 
negative 
propositions 
as 
refer 
to 
universals 
and 
have 
a 
universal 
character, 
one 
must 
be 
true 
and 
the 
other 
false. 
This 
is 
the 
case 
also 
when 
the 
reference 
is 
to 
individuals, 
as 
in 
the 
propositions 
‘Socrates 
is 
white’, 
‘Socrates 
is 
not 
white’. 


When, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
reference 
is 
to 
universals, 
but 
the 
propositions 
are 
not 
universal, 
it 
is 
not 
always 
the 
case 
that 
one 
is 
true 
and 
the 
other 
false, 
for 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
state 
truly 
that 
man 
is 
white 
and 
that 
man 
is 
not 
white 
and 
that 
man 
is 
beautiful 
and 
that 
man 
is 
not 
beautiful; 
for 
if 
a 
man 
is 
deformed 
he 
is 
the 
reverse 
of 
beautiful, 
also 
if 
he 
is 
progressing 
towards 
beauty 
he 
is 
not 
yet 
beautiful. 


This 
statement 
might 
seem 
at 
first 
sight 
to 
carry 
with 
it 
a 
contradiction, 
owing 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
proposition 
‘man 
is 
not 
white’ 
appears 
to 
be 



equivalent 
to 
the 
proposition 
‘no 
man 
is 
white’. 
This, 
however, 
is 
not 
the 
case, 
nor 
are 
they 
necessarily 
at 
the 
same 
time 
true 
or 
false. 


It 
is 
evident 
also 
that 
the 
denial 
corresponding 
to 
a 
single 
affirmation 
is 
itself 
single; 
for 
the 
denial 
must 
deny 
just 
that 
which 
the 
affirmation 
affirms 
concerning 
the 
same 
subject, 
and 
must 
correspond 
with 
the 
affirmation 
both 
in 
the 
universal 
or 
particular 
character 
of 
the 
subject 
and 
in 
the 
distributed 
or 
undistributed 
sense 
in 
which 
it 
is 
understood. 


For 
instance, 
the 
affirmation 
‘Socrates 
is 
white’ 
has 
its 
proper 
denial 
in 
the 
proposition 
‘Socrates 
is 
not 
white’. 
If 
anything 
else 
be 
negatively 
predicated 
of 
the 
subject 
or 
if 
anything 
else 
be 
the 
subject 
though 
the 
predicate 
remain 
the 
same, 
the 
denial 
will 
not 
be 
the 
denial 
proper 
to 
that 
affirmation, 
but 
on 
that 
is 
distinct. 


The 
denial 
proper 
to 
the 
affirmation 
‘every 
man 
is 
white’ 
is 
‘not 
every 
man 
is 
white’; 
that 
proper 
to 
the 
affirmation 
‘some 
men 
are 
white’ 
is 
‘no 
man 
is 
white’, 
while 
that 
proper 
to 
the 
affirmation 
‘man 
is 
white’ 
is 
‘man 
is 
not 
white’. 


We 
have 
shown 
further 
that 
a 
single 
denial 
is 
contradictorily 
opposite 
to 
a 
single 
affirmation 
and 
we 
have 
explained 
which 
these 
are; 
we 
have 
also 
stated 
that 
contrary 
are 
distinct 
from 
contradictory 
propositions 
and 
which 
the 
contrary 
are; 
also 
that 
with 
regard 
to 
a 
pair 
of 
opposite 
propositions 
it 
is 
not 
always 
the 
case 
that 
one 
is 
true 
and 
the 
other 
false. 
We 
have 
pointed 
out, 
moreover, 
what 
the 
reason 
of 
this 
is 
and 
under 
what 
circumstances 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
one 
involves 
the 
falsity 
of 
the 
other. 


An 
affirmation 
or 
denial 
is 
single, 
if 
it 
indicates 
some 
one 
fact 
about 
some 
one 
subject; 
it 
matters 
not 
whether 
the 
subject 
is 
universal 
and 
whether 
the 
statement 
has 
a 
universal 
character, 
or 
whether 
this 
is 
not 
so. 
Such 
single 
propositions 
are: 
‘every 
man 
is 
white’, 
‘not 
every 
man 
is 
white’;’man 
is 
white’,’man 
is 
not 
white’; 
‘no 
man 
is 
white’, 
‘some 
men 
are 
white’; 
provided 
the 
word 
‘white’ 
has 
one 
meaning. 
If, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
one 
word 
has 
two 
meanings 
which 
do 
not 
combine 
to 
form 
one, 
the 
affirmation 
is 
not 
single. 
For 
instance, 
if 
a 
man 
should 
establish 
the 
symbol 
‘garment’ 
as 
significant 
both 
of 
a 
horse 
and 
of 
a 
man, 
the 
proposition 
‘garment 
is 
white’ 
would 
not 
be 
a 
single 
affirmation, 
nor 
its 
opposite 
a 
single 
denial. 
For 
it 
is 
equivalent 
to 
the 
proposition 
‘horse 
and 
man 
are 
white’, 
which, 
again, 
is 
equivalent 
to 
the 
two 



propositions 
‘horse 
is 
white’, 
‘man 
is 
white’. 
If, 
then, 
these 
two 
propositions 
have 
more 
than 
a 
single 
significance, 
and 
do 
not 
form 
a 
single 
proposition, 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
the 
first 
proposition 
either 
has 
more 
than 
one 
significance 
or 
else 
has 
none; 
for 
a 
particular 
man 
is 
not 
a 
horse. 


This, 
then, 
is 
another 
instance 
of 
those 
propositions 
of 
which 
both 
the 
positive 
and 
the 
negative 
forms 
may 
be 
true 
or 
false 
simultaneously. 


In 
the 
case 
of 
that 
which 
is 
or 
which 
has 
taken 
place, 
propositions, 
whether 
positive 
or 
negative, 
must 
be 
true 
or 
false. 
Again, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
pair 
of 
contradictories, 
either 
when 
the 
subject 
is 
universal 
and 
the 
propositions 
are 
of 
a 
universal 
character, 
or 
when 
it 
is 
individual, 
as 
has 
been 
said,’ 
one 
of 
the 
two 
must 
be 
true 
and 
the 
other 
false; 
whereas 
when 
the 
subject 
is 
universal, 
but 
the 
propositions 
are 
not 
of 
a 
universal 
character, 
there 
is 
no 
such 
necessity. 
We 
have 
discussed 
this 
type 
also 
in 
a 
previous 
chapter. 


When 
the 
subject, 
however, 
is 
individual, 
and 
that 
which 
is 
predicated 
of 
it 
relates 
to 
the 
future, 
the 
case 
is 
altered. 
For 
if 
all 
propositions 
whether 
positive 
or 
negative 
are 
either 
true 
or 
false, 
then 
any 
given 
predicate 
must 
either 
belong 
to 
the 
subject 
or 
not, 
so 
that 
if 
one 
man 
affirms 
that 
an 
event 
of 
a 
given 
character 
will 
take 
place 
and 
another 
denies 
it, 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
the 
statement 
of 
the 
one 
will 
correspond 
with 
reality 
and 
that 
of 
the 
other 
will 
not. 
For 
the 
predicate 
cannot 
both 
belong 
and 
not 
belong 
to 
the 
subject 
at 
one 
and 
the 
same 
time 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
future. 


Thus, 
if 
it 
is 
true 
to 
say 
that 
a 
thing 
is 
white, 
it 
must 
necessarily 
be 
white; 
if 
the 
reverse 
proposition 
is 
true, 
it 
will 
of 
necessity 
not 
be 
white. 
Again, 
if 
it 
is 
white, 
the 
proposition 
stating 
that 
it 
is 
white 
was 
true; 
if 
it 
is 
not 
white, 
the 
proposition 
to 
the 
opposite 
effect 
was 
true. 
And 
if 
it 
is 
not 
white, 
the 
man 
who 
states 
that 
it 
is 
making 
a 
false 
statement; 
and 
if 
the 
man 
who 
states 
that 
it 
is 
white 
is 
making 
a 
false 
statement, 
it 
follows 
that 
it 
is 
not 
white. 
It 
may 
therefore 
be 
argued 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
affirmations 
or 
denials 
must 
be 
either 
true 
or 
false. 


Now 
if 
this 
be 
so, 
nothing 
is 
or 
takes 
place 
fortuitously, 
either 
in 
the 
present 
or 
in 
the 
future, 
and 
there 
are 
no 
real 
alternatives; 
everything 
takes 
place 
of 
necessity 
and 
is 
fixed. 
For 
either 
he 
that 
affirms 
that 
it 
will 
take 
place 
or 
he 
that 
denies 
this 
is 
in 
correspondence 
with 
fact, 
whereas 
if 
things 
did 
not 
take 
place 
of 
necessity, 
an 
event 
might 
just 
as 
easily 
not 
happen 
as 
happen; 



for 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
word 
‘fortuitous’ 
with 
regard 
to 
present 
or 
future 
events 
is 
that 
reality 
is 
so 
constituted 
that 
it 
may 
issue 
in 
either 
of 
two 
opposite 
directions. 
Again, 
if 
a 
thing 
is 
white 
now, 
it 
was 
true 
before 
to 
say 
that 
it 
would 
be 
white, 
so 
that 
of 
anything 
that 
has 
taken 
place 
it 
was 
always 
true 
to 
say 
‘it 
is’ 
or 
‘it 
will 
be’. 
But 
if 
it 
was 
always 
true 
to 
say 
that 
a 
thing 
is 
or 
will 
be, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be 
or 
not 
be 
about 
to 
be, 
and 
when 
a 
thing 
cannot 
not 
come 
to 
be, 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
not 
come 
to 
be, 
and 
when 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
not 
come 
to 
be, 
it 
must 
come 
to 
be. 
All, 
then, 
that 
is 
about 
to 
be 
must 
of 
necessity 
take 
place. 
It 
results 
from 
this 
that 
nothing 
is 
uncertain 
or 
fortuitous, 
for 
if 
it 
were 
fortuitous 
it 
would 
not 
be 
necessary. 


Again, 
to 
say 
that 
neither 
the 
affirmation 
nor 
the 
denial 
is 
true, 
maintaining, 
let 
us 
say, 
that 
an 
event 
neither 
will 
take 
place 
nor 
will 
not 
take 
place, 
is 
to 
take 
up 
a 
position 
impossible 
to 
defend. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
though 
facts 
should 
prove 
the 
one 
proposition 
false, 
the 
opposite 
would 
still 
be 
untrue. 
Secondly, 
if 
it 
was 
true 
to 
say 
that 
a 
thing 
was 
both 
white 
and 
large, 
both 
these 
qualities 
must 
necessarily 
belong 
to 
it; 
and 
if 
they 
will 
belong 
to 
it 
the 
next 
day, 
they 
must 
necessarily 
belong 
to 
it 
the 
next 
day. 
But 
if 
an 
event 
is 
neither 
to 
take 
place 
nor 
not 
to 
take 
place 
the 
next 
day, 
the 
element 
of 
chance 
will 
be 
eliminated. 
For 
example, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
that 
a 
sea-fight 
should 
neither 
take 
place 
nor 
fail 
to 
take 
place 
on 
the 
next 
day. 


These 
awkward 
results 
and 
others 
of 
the 
same 
kind 
follow, 
if 
it 
is 
an 
irrefragable 
law 
that 
of 
every 
pair 
of 
contradictory 
propositions, 
whether 
they 
have 
regard 
to 
universals 
and 
are 
stated 
as 
universally 
applicable, 
or 
whether 
they 
have 
regard 
to 
individuals, 
one 
must 
be 
true 
and 
the 
other 
false, 
and 
that 
there 
are 
no 
real 
alternatives, 
but 
that 
all 
that 
is 
or 
takes 
place 
is 
the 
outcome 
of 
necessity. 
There 
would 
be 
no 
need 
to 
deliberate 
or 
to 
take 
trouble, 
on 
the 
supposition 
that 
if 
we 
should 
adopt 
a 
certain 
course, 
a 
certain 
result 
would 
follow, 
while, 
if 
we 
did 
not, 
the 
result 
would 
not 
follow. 
For 
a 
man 
may 
predict 
an 
event 
ten 
thousand 
years 
beforehand, 
and 
another 
may 
predict 
the 
reverse; 
that 
which 
was 
truly 
predicted 
at 
the 
moment 
in 
the 
past 
will 
of 
necessity 
take 
place 
in 
the 
fullness 
of 
time. 


Further, 
it 
makes 
no 
difference 
whether 
people 
have 
or 
have 
not 
actually 
made 
the 
contradictory 
statements. 
For 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
the 
circumstances 
are 
not 
influenced 
by 
the 
fact 
of 
an 
affirmation 
or 
denial 
on 
the 
part 
of 
anyone. 
For 
events 
will 
not 
take 
place 
or 
fail 
to 
take 
place 
because 
it 
was 
stated 
that 
they 
would 
or 
would 
not 
take 
place, 
nor 
is 
this 
any 
more 
the 
case 
if 



the 
prediction 
dates 
back 
ten 
thousand 
years 
or 
any 
other 
space 
of 
time. 
Wherefore, 
if 
through 
all 
time 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
was 
so 
constituted 
that 
a 
prediction 
about 
an 
event 
was 
true, 
then 
through 
all 
time 
it 
was 
necessary 
that 
that 
should 
find 
fulfillment; 
and 
with 
regard 
to 
all 
events, 
circumstances 
have 
always 
been 
such 
that 
their 
occurrence 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
necessity. 
For 
that 
of 
which 
someone 
has 
said 
truly 
that 
it 
will 
be, 
cannot 
fail 
to 
take 
place; 
and 
of 
that 
which 
takes 
place, 
it 
was 
always 
true 
to 
say 
that 
it 
would 
be. 


Yet 
this 
view 
leads 
to 
an 
impossible 
conclusion; 
for 
we 
see 
that 
both 
deliberation 
and 
action 
are 
causative 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
future, 
and 
that, 
to 
speak 
more 
generally, 
in 
those 
things 
which 
are 
not 
continuously 
actual 
there 
is 
potentiality 
in 
either 
direction. 
Such 
things 
may 
either 
be 
or 
not 
be; 
events 
also 
therefore 
may 
either 
take 
place 
or 
not 
take 
place. 
There 
are 
many 
obvious 
instances 
of 
this. 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
this 
coat 
may 
be 
cut 
in 
half, 
and 
yet 
it 
may 
not 
be 
cut 
in 
half, 
but 
wear 
out 
first. 
In 
the 
same 
way, 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be 
cut 
in 
half; 
unless 
this 
were 
so, 
it 
would 
not 
be 
possible 
that 
it 
should 
wear 
out 
first. 
So 
it 
is 
therefore 
with 
all 
other 
events 
which 
possess 
this 
kind 
of 
potentiality. 
It 
is 
therefore 
plain 
that 
it 
is 
not 
of 
necessity 
that 
everything 
is 
or 
takes 
place; 
but 
in 
some 
instances 
there 
are 
real 
alternatives, 
in 
which 
case 
the 
affirmation 
is 
no 
more 
true 
and 
no 
more 
false 
than 
the 
denial; 
while 
some 
exhibit 
a 
predisposition 
and 
general 
tendency 
in 
one 
direction 
or 
the 
other, 
and 
yet 
can 
issue 
in 
the 
opposite 
direction 
by 
exception. 


Now 
that 
which 
is 
must 
needs 
be 
when 
it 
is, 
and 
that 
which 
is 
not 
must 
needs 
not 
be 
when 
it 
is 
not. 
Yet 
it 
cannot 
be 
said 
without 
qualification 
that 
all 
existence 
and 
non-existence 
is 
the 
outcome 
of 
necessity. 
For 
there 
is 
a 
difference 
between 
saying 
that 
that 
which 
is, 
when 
it 
is, 
must 
needs 
be, 
and 
simply 
saying 
that 
all 
that 
is 
must 
needs 
be, 
and 
similarly 
in 
the 
case 
of 
that 
which 
is 
not. 
In 
the 
case, 
also, 
of 
two 
contradictory 
propositions 
this 
holds 
good. 
Everything 
must 
either 
be 
or 
not 
be, 
whether 
in 
the 
present 
or 
in 
the 
future, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
always 
possible 
to 
distinguish 
and 
state 
determinately 
which 
of 
these 
alternatives 
must 
necessarily 
come 
about. 


Let 
me 
illustrate. 
A 
sea-fight 
must 
either 
take 
place 
to-morrow 
or 
not, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
take 
place 
to-morrow, 
neither 
is 
it 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
not 
take 
place, 
yet 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
it 
either 
should 
or 
should 
not 
take 
place 
to-morrow. 
Since 
propositions 
correspond 
with 
facts, 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
when 
in 
future 
events 
there 
is 
a 
real 
alternative, 
and 
a 
potentiality 
in 
contrary 
directions, 
the 
corresponding 
affirmation 
and 
denial 
have 
the 



same 
character. 


This 
is 
the 
case 
with 
regard 
to 
that 
which 
is 
not 
always 
existent 
or 
not 
always 
nonexistent. 
One 
of 
the 
two 
propositions 
in 
such 
instances 
must 
be 
true 
and 
the 
other 
false, 
but 
we 
cannot 
say 
determinately 
that 
this 
or 
that 
is 
false, 
but 
must 
leave 
the 
alternative 
undecided. 
One 
may 
indeed 
be 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
true 
than 
the 
other, 
but 
it 
cannot 
be 
either 
actually 
true 
or 
actually 
false. 
It 
is 
therefore 
plain 
that 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
of 
an 
affirmation 
and 
a 
denial 
one 
should 
be 
true 
and 
the 
other 
false. 
For 
in 
the 
case 
of 
that 
which 
exists 
potentially, 
but 
not 
actually, 
the 
rule 
which 
applies 
to 
that 
which 
exists 
actually 
does 
not 
hold 
good. 
The 
case 
is 
rather 
as 
we 
have 
indicated. 


An 
affirmation 
is 
the 
statement 
of 
a 
fact 
with 
regard 
to 
a 
subject, 
and 
this 
subject 
is 
either 
a 
noun 
or 
that 
which 
has 
no 
name; 
the 
subject 
and 
predicate 
in 
an 
affirmation 
must 
each 
denote 
a 
single 
thing. 
I 
have 
already 
explained’ 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
a 
noun 
and 
by 
that 
which 
has 
no 
name; 
for 
I 
stated 
that 
the 
expression 
‘not-man’ 
was 
not 
a 
noun, 
in 
the 
proper 
sense 
of 
the 
word, 
but 
an 
indefinite 
noun, 
denoting 
as 
it 
does 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
a 
single 
thing. 
Similarly 
the 
expression 
‘does 
not 
enjoy 
health’ 
is 
not 
a 
verb 
proper, 
but 
an 
indefinite 
verb. 
Every 
affirmation, 
then, 
and 
every 
denial, 
will 
consist 
of 
a 
noun 
and 
a 
verb, 
either 
definite 
or 
indefinite. 


There 
can 
be 
no 
affirmation 
or 
denial 
without 
a 
verb; 
for 
the 
expressions 
‘is’, 
‘will 
be’, 
‘was’, 
‘is 
coming 
to 
be’, 
and 
the 
like 
are 
verbs 
according 
to 
our 
definition, 
since 
besides 
their 
specific 
meaning 
they 
convey 
the 
notion 
of 
time. 
Thus 
the 
primary 
affirmation 
and 
denial 
are 
‘as 
follows: 
‘man 
is’, 
‘man 
is 
not’. 
Next 
to 
these, 
there 
are 
the 
propositions: 
‘not-man 
is’, 
‘not-man 
is 
not’. 
Again 
we 
have 
the 
propositions: 
‘every 
man 
is, 
‘every 
man 
is 
not’, 
‘all 
that 
is 
not-man 
is’, 
‘all 
that 
is 
not-man 
is 
not’. 
The 
same 
classification 
holds 
good 
with 
regard 
to 
such 
periods 
of 
time 
as 
lie 
outside 
the 
present. 


When 
the 
verb 
‘is’ 
is 
used 
as 
a 
third 
element 
in 
the 
sentence, 
there 
can 
be 
positive 
and 
negative 
propositions 
of 
two 
sorts. 
Thus 
in 
the 
sentence 
‘man 
is 
just’ 
the 
verb 
‘is’ 
is 
used 
as 
a 
third 
element, 
call 
it 
verb 
or 
noun, 
which 
you 
will. 
Four 
propositions, 
therefore, 
instead 
of 
two 
can 
be 
formed 
with 
these 
materials. 
Two 
of 
the 
four, 
as 
regards 
their 
affirmation 
and 
denial, 
correspond 
in 
their 
logical 
sequence 
with 
the 
propositions 
which 
deal 
with 
a 
condition 
of 
privation; 
the 
other 
two 
do 
not 
correspond 
with 
these. 



I 
mean 
that 
the 
verb 
‘is’ 
is 
added 
either 
to 
the 
term 
‘just’ 
or 
to 
the 
term 
‘not-just’, 
and 
two 
negative 
propositions 
are 
formed 
in 
the 
same 
way. 
Thus 
we 
have 
the 
four 
propositions. 
Reference 
to 
the 
subjoined 
table 
will 
make 
matters 
clear: 
< 


tbody> 


A. 
Affirmation. 
Man 
is 
just 
B. 
Denial. 
Man 
is 
not 
just 
\ 
/ 
/ 
\ 
D. 
Denial. 
Man 
is 
not 
not-just 
C. 
Affirmation. 
Man 
is 
not-just 


Here 
‘is’ 
and 
‘is 
not’ 
are 
added 
either 
to 
‘just’ 
or 
to 
‘not-just’. 
This 
then 
is 
the 
proper 
scheme 
for 
these 
propositions, 
as 
has 
been 
said 
in 
the 
Analytics. 
The 
same 
rule 
holds 
good, 
if 
the 
subject 
is 
distributed. 
Thus 
we 
have 
the 
table: 
< 


tbody> 


A'. 
Affirmation. 
Every 
man 
is 
just 
B'. 
Denial. 
Not 
every 
man 
is 
just 
\ 
/ 
/ 
\ 
D'. 
Denial. 
Not 
every 
man 
is 
not-just 
C'. 
Affirmation. 
Every 
man 
is 
not-just. 


Yet 
here 
it 
is 
not 
possible, 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
in 
the 
former 
case, 
that 
the 
propositions 
joined 
in 
the 
table 
by 
a 
diagonal 
line 
should 
both 
be 
true; 
though 
under 
certain 
circumstances 
this 
is 
the 
case. 


We 
have 
thus 
set 
out 
two 
pairs 
of 
opposite 
propositions; 
there 
are 
moreover 
two 
other 
pairs, 
if 
a 
term 
be 
conjoined 
with 
‘not-man’, 
the 
latter 
forming 
a 
kind 
of 
subject. 
Thus: 
< 


tbody> 


A". 
Not-man 
is 
just. 
B". 
Not-man 
is 
not 
just 
\ 
/ 
/ 
\ 
D". 
Not-man 
is 
not 
not-just. 
C". 
Not-man 
is 
not-just. 


This 
is 
an 
exhaustive 
enumeration 
of 
all 
the 
pairs 
of 
opposite 
propositions 



that 
can 
possibly 
be 
framed. 
This 
last 
group 
should 
remain 
distinct 
from 
those 
which 
preceded 
it, 
since 
it 
employs 
as 
its 
subject 
the 
expression 
‘not-man’. 


When 
the 
verb 
‘is’ 
does 
not 
fit 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
sentence 
(for 
instance, 
when 
the 
verbs 
‘walks’, 
‘enjoys 
health’ 
are 
used), 
that 
scheme 
applies, 
which 
applied 
when 
the 
word 
‘is’ 
was 
added. 


Thus 
we 
have 
the 
propositions: 
‘every 
man 
enjoys 
health’, 
‘every 
man 
does-not-enjoy-health’, 
‘all 
that 
is 
not-man 
enjoys 
health’, 
‘all 
that 
is 
not-man 
does-not-enjoy-health’. 
We 
must 
not 
in 
these 
propositions 
use 
the 
expression 
‘not 
every 
man’. 
The 
negative 
must 
be 
attached 
to 
the 
word 
‘man’, 
for 
the 
word 
‘every’ 
does 
not 
give 
to 
the 
subject 
a 
universal 
significance, 
but 
implies 
that, 
as 
a 
subject, 
it 
is 
distributed. 
This 
is 
plain 
from 
the 
following 
pairs: 
‘man 
enjoys 
health’, 
‘man 
does 
not 
enjoy 
health’; 
‘not-man 
enjoys 
health’, 
‘not 
man 
does 
not 
enjoy 
health’. 
These 
propositions 
differ 
from 
the 
former 
in 
being 
indefinite 
and 
not 
universal 
in 
character. 
Thus 
the 
adjectives 
‘every’ 
and 
no 
additional 
significance 
except 
that 
the 
subject, 
whether 
in 
a 
positive 
or 
in 
a 
negative 
sentence, 
is 
distributed. 
The 
rest 
of 
the 
sentence, 
therefore, 
will 
in 
each 
case 
be 
the 
same. 


Since 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
proposition 
‘every 
animal 
is 
just’ 
is 
‘no 
animal 
is 
just’, 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
these 
two 
propositions 
will 
never 
both 
be 
true 
at 
the 
same 
time 
or 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
same 
subject. 
Sometimes, 
however, 
the 
contradictories 
of 
these 
contraries 
will 
both 
be 
true, 
as 
in 
the 
instance 
before 
us: 
the 
propositions 
‘not 
every 
animal 
is 
just’ 
and 
‘some 
animals 
are 
just’ 
are 
both 
true. 


Further, 
the 
proposition 
‘no 
man 
is 
just’ 
follows 
from 
the 
proposition 
‘every 
man 
is 
not 
just’ 
and 
the 
proposition 
‘not 
every 
man 
is 
not 
just’, 
which 
is 
the 
opposite 
of 
‘every 
man 
is 
not-just’, 
follows 
from 
the 
proposition 
‘some 
men 
are 
just’; 
for 
if 
this 
be 
true, 
there 
must 
be 
some 
just 
men. 


It 
is 
evident, 
also, 
that 
when 
the 
subject 
is 
individual, 
if 
a 
question 
is 
asked 
and 
the 
negative 
answer 
is 
the 
true 
one, 
a 
certain 
positive 
proposition 
is 
also 
true. 
Thus, 
if 
the 
question 
were 
asked 
Socrates 
wise?’ 
and 
the 
negative 
answer 
were 
the 
true 
one, 
the 
positive 
inference 
‘Then 
Socrates 
is 
unwise’ 
is 
correct. 
But 
no 
such 
inference 
is 
correct 
in 
the 
case 
of 
universals, 
but 
rather 
a 
negative 
proposition. 
For 
instance, 
if 
to 
the 
question 
‘Is 
every 
man 
wise?’ 
the 
answer 
is 
‘no’, 
the 
inference 
‘Then 
every 
man 
is 
unwise’ 
is 
false. 
But 
under 
these 
circumstances 
the 
inference 
‘Not 
every 
man 
is 
wise’ 
is 
correct. 
This 
last 
is 
the 
contradictory, 
the 
former 
the 
contrary. 
Negative 
expressions, 
which 
consist 
of 
an 
indefinite 
noun 
or 
predicate, 
such 
as 
‘not-man’ 
or 
‘not-just’, 



may 
seem 
to 
be 
denials 
containing 
neither 
noun 
nor 
verb 
in 
the 
proper 
sense 
of 
the 
words. 
But 
they 
are 
not. 
For 
a 
denial 
must 
always 
be 
either 
true 
or 
false, 
and 
he 
that 
uses 
the 
expression 
‘not 
man’, 
if 
nothing 
more 
be 
added, 
is 
not 
nearer 
but 
rather 
further 
from 
making 
a 
true 
or 
a 
false 
statement 
than 
he 
who 
uses 
the 
expression 
‘man’. 


The 
propositions 
‘everything 
that 
is 
not 
man 
is 
just’, 
and 
the 
contradictory 
of 
this, 
are 
not 
equivalent 
to 
any 
of 
the 
other 
propositions; 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
proposition 
‘everything 
that 
is 
not 
man 
is 
not 
just’ 
is 
equivalent 
to 
the 
proposition 
‘nothing 
that 
is 
not 
man 
is 
just’. 


The 
conversion 
of 
the 
position 
of 
subject 
and 
predicate 
in 
a 
sentence 
involves 
no 
difference 
in 
its 
meaning. 
Thus 
we 
say 
‘man 
is 
white’ 
and 
‘white 
is 
man’. 
If 
these 
were 
not 
equivalent, 
there 
would 
be 
more 
than 
one 
contradictory 
to 
the 
same 
proposition, 
whereas 
it 
has 
been 
demonstrated’ 
that 
each 
proposition 
has 
one 
proper 
contradictory 
and 
one 
only. 
For 
of 
the 
proposition 
‘man 
is 
white’ 
the 
appropriate 
contradictory 
is 
‘man 
is 
not 
white’, 
and 
of 
the 
proposition 
‘white 
is 
man’, 
if 
its 
meaning 
be 
different, 
the 
contradictory 
will 
either 
be 
‘white 
is 
not 
not-man’ 
or 
‘white 
is 
not 
man’. 
Now 
the 
former 
of 
these 
is 
the 
contradictory 
of 
the 
proposition 
‘white 
is 
not-man’, 
and 
the 
latter 
of 
these 
is 
the 
contradictory 
of 
the 
proposition 
‘man 
is 
white’; 
thus 
there 
will 
be 
two 
contradictories 
to 
one 
proposition. 


It 
is 
evident, 
therefore, 
that 
the 
inversion 
of 
the 
relative 
position 
of 
subject 
and 
predicate 
does 
not 
affect 
the 
sense 
of 
affirmations 
and 
denials. 


There 
is 
no 
unity 
about 
an 
affirmation 
or 
denial 
which, 
either 
positively 
or 
negatively, 
predicates 
one 
thing 
of 
many 
subjects, 
or 
many 
things 
of 
the 
same 
subject, 
unless 
that 
which 
is 
indicated 
by 
the 
many 
is 
really 
some 
one 
thing. 
do 
not 
apply 
this 
word 
‘one’ 
to 
those 
things 
which, 
though 
they 
have 
a 
single 
recognized 
name, 
yet 
do 
not 
combine 
to 
form 
a 
unity. 
Thus, 
man 
may 
be 
an 
animal, 
and 
biped, 
and 
domesticated, 
but 
these 
three 
predicates 
combine 
to 
form 
a 
unity. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
predicates 
‘white’, 
‘man’, 
and 
‘walking’ 
do 
not 
thus 
combine. 
Neither, 
therefore, 
if 
these 
three 
form 
the 
subject 
of 
an 
affirmation, 
nor 
if 
they 
form 
its 
predicate, 
is 
there 
any 
unity 
about 
that 
affirmation. 
In 
both 
cases 
the 
unity 
is 
linguistic, 
but 
not 
real. 


If 
therefore 
the 
dialectical 
question 
is 
a 
request 
for 
an 
answer, 
i.e. 
either 
for 
the 
admission 
of 
a 
premiss 
or 
for 
the 
admission 
of 
one 
of 
two 
contradictories



and 
the 
premiss 
is 
itself 
always 
one 
of 
two 
contradictories-the 
answer 
to 
such 
a 
question 
as 
contains 
the 
above 
predicates 
cannot 
be 
a 
single 
proposition. 
For 
as 
I 
have 
explained 
in 
the 
Topics, 
question 
is 
not 
a 
single 
one, 
even 
if 
the 
answer 
asked 
for 
is 
true. 


At 
the 
same 
time 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
a 
question 
of 
the 
form 
‘what 
is 
it?’ 
is 
not 
a 
dialectical 
question, 
for 
a 
dialectical 
questioner 
must 
by 
the 
form 
of 
his 
question 
give 
his 
opponent 
the 
chance 
of 
announcing 
one 
of 
two 
alternatives, 
whichever 
he 
wishes. 
He 
must 
therefore 
put 
the 
question 
into 
a 
more 
definite 
form, 
and 
inquire, 
e.g.. 
whether 
man 
has 
such 
and 
such 
a 
characteristic 
or 
not. 


Some 
combinations 
of 
predicates 
are 
such 
that 
the 
separate 
predicates 
unite 
to 
form 
a 
single 
predicate. 
Let 
us 
consider 
under 
what 
conditions 
this 
is 
and 
is 
not 
possible. 
We 
may 
either 
state 
in 
two 
separate 
propositions 
that 
man 
is 
an 
animal 
and 
that 
man 
is 
a 
biped, 
or 
we 
may 
combine 
the 
two, 
and 
state 
that 
man 
is 
an 
animal 
with 
two 
feet. 
Similarly 
we 
may 
use 
‘man’ 
and 
‘white’ 
as 
separate 
predicates, 
or 
unite 
them 
into 
one. 
Yet 
if 
a 
man 
is 
a 
shoemaker 
and 
is 
also 
good, 
we 
cannot 
construct 
a 
composite 
proposition 
and 
say 
that 
he 
is 
a 
good 
shoemaker. 
For 
if, 
whenever 
two 
separate 
predicates 
truly 
belong 
to 
a 
subject, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
predicate 
resulting 
from 
their 
combination 
also 
truly 
belongs 
to 
the 
subject, 
many 
absurd 
results 
ensue. 
For 
instance, 
a 
man 
is 
man 
and 
white. 
Therefore, 
if 
predicates 
may 
always 
be 
combined, 
he 
is 
a 
white 
man. 
Again, 
if 
the 
predicate 
‘white’ 
belongs 
to 
him, 
then 
the 
combination 
of 
that 
predicate 
with 
the 
former 
composite 
predicate 
will 
be 
permissible. 
Thus 
it 
will 
be 
right 
to 
say 
that 
he 
is 
a 
white 
man 
so 
on 
indefinitely. 
Or, 
again, 
we 
may 
combine 
the 
predicates 
‘musical’, 
‘white’, 
and 
‘walking’, 
and 
these 
may 
be 
combined 
many 
times. 
Similarly 
we 
may 
say 
that 
Socrates 
is 
Socrates 
and 
a 
man, 
and 
that 
therefore 
he 
is 
the 
man 
Socrates, 
or 
that 
Socrates 
is 
a 
man 
and 
a 
biped, 
and 
that 
therefore 
he 
is 
a 
two-
footed 
man. 
Thus 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
if 
man 
states 
unconditionally 
that 
predicates 
can 
always 
be 
combined, 
many 
absurd 
consequences 
ensue. 


We 
will 
now 
explain 
what 
ought 
to 
be 
laid 
down. 


Those 
predicates, 
and 
terms 
forming 
the 
subject 
of 
predication, 
which 
are 
accidental 
either 
to 
the 
same 
subject 
or 
to 
one 
another, 
do 
not 
combine 
to 
form 
a 
unity. 
Take 
the 
proposition 
‘man 
is 
white 
of 
complexion 
and 
musical’. 
Whiteness 
and 
being 
musical 
do 
not 
coalesce 
to 
form 
a 
unity, 
for 
they 
belong 
only 
accidentally 
to 
the 
same 
subject. 
Nor 
yet, 
if 
it 
were 
true 
to 
say 
that 
that 
which 
is 
white 
is 
musical, 
would 
the 
terms 
‘musical’ 
and 
‘white’ 
form 
a 
unity, 
for 
it 
is 
only 
incidentally 
that 
that 
which 
is 
musical 
is 
white; 
the 



combination 
of 
the 
two 
will, 
therefore, 
not 
form 
a 
unity. 


Thus, 
again, 
whereas, 
if 
a 
man 
is 
both 
good 
and 
a 
shoemaker, 
we 
cannot 
combine 
the 
two 
propositions 
and 
say 
simply 
that 
he 
is 
a 
good 
shoemaker, 
we 
are, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
able 
to 
combine 
the 
predicates 
‘animal’ 
and 
‘biped’ 
and 
say 
that 
a 
man 
is 
an 
animal 
with 
two 
feet, 
for 
these 
predicates 
are 
not 
accidental. 


Those 
predicates, 
again, 
cannot 
form 
a 
unity, 
of 
which 
the 
one 
is 
implicit 
in 
the 
other: 
thus 
we 
cannot 
combine 
the 
predicate 
‘white’ 
again 
and 
again 
with 
that 
which 
already 
contains 
the 
notion 
‘white’, 
nor 
is 
it 
right 
to 
call 
a 
man 
an 
animal-man 
or 
a 
two-footed 
man; 
for 
the 
notions 
‘animal’ 
and 
‘biped’ 
are 
implicit 
in 
the 
word 
‘man’. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
predicate 
a 
term 
simply 
of 
any 
one 
instance, 
and 
to 
say 
that 
some 
one 
particular 
man 
is 
a 
man 
or 
that 
some 
one 
white 
man 
is 
a 
white 
man. 


Yet 
this 
is 
not 
always 
possible: 
indeed, 
when 
in 
the 
adjunct 
there 
is 
some 
opposite 
which 
involves 
a 
contradiction, 
the 
predication 
of 
the 
simple 
term 
is 
impossible. 
Thus 
it 
is 
not 
right 
to 
call 
a 
dead 
man 
a 
man. 
When, 
however, 
this 
is 
not 
the 
case, 
it 
is 
not 
impossible. 


Yet 
the 
facts 
of 
the 
case 
might 
rather 
be 
stated 
thus: 
when 
some 
such 
opposite 
elements 
are 
present, 
resolution 
is 
never 
possible, 
but 
when 
they 
are 
not 
present, 
resolution 
is 
nevertheless 
not 
always 
possible. 
Take 
the 
proposition 
‘Homer 
is 
so-and-so’, 
say 
‘a 
poet’; 
does 
it 
follow 
that 
Homer 
is, 
or 
does 
it 
not? 
The 
verb 
‘is’ 
is 
here 
used 
of 
Homer 
only 
incidentally, 
the 
proposition 
being 
that 
Homer 
is 
a 
poet, 
not 
that 
he 
is, 
in 
the 
independent 
sense 
of 
the 
word. 


Thus, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
those 
predications 
which 
have 
within 
them 
no 
contradiction 
when 
the 
nouns 
are 
expanded 
into 
definitions, 
and 
wherein 
the 
predicates 
belong 
to 
the 
subject 
in 
their 
own 
proper 
sense 
and 
not 
in 
any 
indirect 
way, 
the 
individual 
may 
be 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
simple 
propositions 
as 
well 
as 
of 
the 
composite. 
But 
in 
the 
case 
of 
that 
which 
is 
not, 
it 
is 
not 
true 
to 
say 
that 
because 
it 
is 
the 
object 
of 
opinion, 
it 
is; 
for 
the 
opinion 
held 
about 
it 
is 
that 
it 
is 
not, 
not 
that 
it 
is. 


As 
these 
distinctions 
have 
been 
made, 
we 
must 
consider 
the 
mutual 
relation 
of 
those 
affirmations 
and 
denials 
which 
assert 
or 
deny 
possibility 
or 
contingency, 
impossibility 
or 
necessity: 
for 
the 
subject 
is 
not 
without 



difficulty. 


We 
admit 
that 
of 
composite 
expressions 
those 
are 
contradictory 
each 
to 
each 
which 
have 
the 
verb 
‘to 
be’ 
its 
positive 
and 
negative 
form 
respectively. 
Thus 
the 
contradictory 
of 
the 
proposition 
‘man 
is’ 
is 
‘man 
is 
not’, 
not 
‘notman 
is’, 
and 
the 
contradictory 
of 
‘man 
is 
white’ 
is 
‘man 
is 
not 
white’, 
not 
‘man 
is 
not-white’. 
For 
otherwise, 
since 
either 
the 
positive 
or 
the 
negative 
proposition 
is 
true 
of 
any 
subject, 
it 
will 
turn 
out 
true 
to 
say 
that 
a 
piece 
of 
wood 
is 
a 
man 
that 
is 
not 
white. 


Now 
if 
this 
is 
the 
case, 
in 
those 
propositions 
which 
do 
not 
contain 
the 
verb 
‘to 
be’ 
the 
verb 
which 
takes 
its 
place 
will 
exercise 
the 
same 
function. 
Thus 
the 
contradictory 
of 
‘man 
walks’ 
is 
‘man 
does 
not 
walk’, 
not 
‘not-man 
walks’; 
for 
to 
say 
‘man 
walks’ 
merely 
equivalent 
to 
saying 
‘man 
is 
walking’. 


If 
then 
this 
rule 
is 
universal, 
the 
contradictory 
of 
‘it 
may 
be’ 
is 
may 
not 
be’, 
not 
‘it 
cannot 
be’. 


Now 
it 
appears 
that 
the 
same 
thing 
both 
may 
and 
may 
not 
be; 
for 
instance, 
everything 
that 
may 
be 
cut 
or 
may 
walk 
may 
also 
escape 
cutting 
and 
refrain 
from 
walking; 
and 
the 
reason 
is 
that 
those 
things 
that 
have 
potentiality 
in 
this 
sense 
are 
not 
always 
actual. 
In 
such 
cases, 
both 
the 
positive 
and 
the 
negative 
propositions 
will 
be 
true; 
for 
that 
which 
is 
capable 
of 
walking 
or 
of 
being 
seen 
has 
also 
a 
potentiality 
in 
the 
opposite 
direction. 


But 
since 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
contradictory 
propositions 
should 
both 
be 
true 
of 
the 
same 
subject, 
it 
follows 
that’ 
it 
may 
not 
be’ 
is 
not 
the 
contradictory 
of 
‘it 
may 
be’. 
For 
it 
is 
a 
logical 
consequence 
of 
what 
we 
have 
said, 
either 
that 
the 
same 
predicate 
can 
be 
both 
applicable 
and 
inapplicable 
to 
one 
and 
the 
same 
subject 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
or 
that 
it 
is 
not 
by 
the 
addition 
of 
the 
verbs 
‘be’ 
and 
‘not 
be’, 
respectively, 
that 
positive 
and 
negative 
propositions 
are 
formed. 
If 
the 
former 
of 
these 
alternatives 
must 
be 
rejected, 
we 
must 
choose 
the 
latter. 


The 
contradictory, 
then, 
of 
‘it 
may 
be’ 
is 
‘it 
cannot 
be’. 
The 
same 
rule 
applies 
to 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
is 
contingent 
that 
it 
should 
be’; 
the 
contradictory 
of 
this 
is 
‘it 
is 
not 
contingent 
that 
it 
should 
be’. 
The 
similar 
propositions, 
such 
as 
‘it 
is 
necessary’ 
and 
‘it 
is 
impossible’, 
may 
be 
dealt 
with 
in 
the 
same 
manner. 
For 
it 
comes 
about 
that 
just 
as 
in 
the 
former 
instances 
the 
verbs 
‘is’ 
and 
‘is 
not’ 
were 
added 
to 
the 
subject-matter 
of 
the 
sentence 
‘white’ 
and 
‘man’, 
so 
here 
‘that 
it 
should 
be’ 
and 
‘that 
it 
should 
not 
be’ 
are 
the 
subject-
matter 
and 
‘is 
possible’, 
‘is 
contingent’, 
are 
added. 
These 
indicate 
that 
a 
certain 
thing 
is 
or 
is 
not 
possible, 
just 
as 
in 
the 
former 
instances 
‘is’ 
and 
‘is 



not’ 
indicated 
that 
certain 
things 
were 
or 
were 
not 
the 
case. 


The 
contradictory, 
then, 
of 
‘it 
may 
not 
be’ 
is 
not 
‘it 
cannot 
be’, 
but 
‘it 
cannot 
not 
be’, 
and 
the 
contradictory 
of 
‘it 
may 
be’ 
is 
not 
‘it 
may 
not 
be’, 
but 
cannot 
be’. 
Thus 
the 
propositions 
‘it 
may 
be’ 
and 
‘it 
may 
not 
be’ 
appear 
each 
to 
imply 
the 
other: 
for, 
since 
these 
two 
propositions 
are 
not 
contradictory, 
the 
same 
thing 
both 
may 
and 
may 
not 
be. 
But 
the 
propositions 
‘it 
may 
be’ 
and 
‘it 
cannot 
be’ 
can 
never 
be 
true 
of 
the 
same 
subject 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
for 
they 
are 
contradictory. 
Nor 
can 
the 
propositions 
‘it 
may 
not 
be’ 
and 
‘it 
cannot 
not 
be’ 
be 
at 
once 
true 
of 
the 
same 
subject. 


The 
propositions 
which 
have 
to 
do 
with 
necessity 
are 
governed 
by 
the 
same 
principle. 
The 
contradictory 
of 
‘it 
is 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
be’, 
is 
not 
‘it 
is 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be,’ 
but 
‘it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
be’, 
and 
the 
contradictory 
of 
‘it 
is 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be’ 
is 
‘it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be’. 


Again, 
the 
contradictory 
of 
‘it 
is 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
be’ 
is 
not 
‘it 
is 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be’ 
but 
‘it 
is 
not 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
be’, 
and 
the 
contradictory 
of 
‘it 
is 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be’ 
is 
‘it 
is 
not 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be’. 


To 
generalize, 
we 
must, 
as 
has 
been 
stated, 
define 
the 
clauses 
‘that 
it 
should 
be’ 
and 
‘that 
it 
should 
not 
be’ 
as 
the 
subject-matter 
of 
the 
propositions, 
and 
in 
making 
these 
terms 
into 
affirmations 
and 
denials 
we 
must 
combine 
them 
with 
‘that 
it 
should 
be’ 
and 
‘that 
it 
should 
not 
be’ 
respectively. 


We 
must 
consider 
the 
following 
pairs 
as 
contradictory 
propositions: 
< 


tbody> 


It 
may 
be. 
It 
cannot 
be. 
It 
is 
contingent. 
It 
is 
not 
contingent. 
It 
is 
impossible. 
It 
is 
not 
impossible. 
It 
is 
necessary. 
It 
is 
not 
necessary. 
It 
is 
true. 
It 
is 
not 
true. 


Logical 
sequences 
follow 
in 
due 
course 
when 
we 
have 
arranged 
the 



propositions 
thus. 
From 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
may 
be’ 
it 
follows 
that 
it 
is 
contingent, 
and 
the 
relation 
is 
reciprocal. 
It 
follows 
also 
that 
it 
is 
not 
impossible 
and 
not 
necessary. 


From 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
may 
not 
be’ 
or 
‘it 
is 
contingent 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be’ 
it 
follows 
that 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be 
and 
that 
it 
is 
not 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be. 
From 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
cannot 
be’ 
or 
‘it 
is 
not 
contingent’ 
it 
follows 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be 
and 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
be. 
From 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
cannot 
not 
be’ 
or 
‘it 
is 
not 
contingent 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be’ 
it 
follows 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
be 
and 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be. 


Let 
us 
consider 
these 
statements 
by 
the 
help 
of 
a 
table: 
< 


tbody> 


A. 
B. 
It 
may 
be. 
It 
cannot 
be. 
It 
is 
contingent. 
It 
is 
not 
contingent. 
It 
is 
not 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
be. 
It 
is 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
be. 
It 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
be. 
It 
is 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be. 
C. 
D. 
It 
may 
not 
be. 
It 
cannot 
not 
be. 
It 
is 
contingent 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be. 
It 
is 
not 
contingent 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be. 
It 
is 
not 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be. 
It 
is 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be. 
It 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be. 
It 
is 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
be. 


Now 
the 
propositions 
‘it 
is 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
be’ 
and 
‘it 
is 
not 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
be’ 
are 
consequent 
upon 
the 
propositions 
‘it 
may 
be’, 
‘it 
is 
contingent’, 
and 
‘it 
cannot 
be’, 
‘it 
is 
not 
contingent’, 
the 
contradictories 
upon 
the 
contradictories. 
But 
there 
is 
inversion. 
The 
negative 
of 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
is 
impossible’ 
is 
consequent 
upon 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
may 
be’ 
and 
the 
corresponding 
positive 
in 
the 
first 
case 
upon 
the 
negative 
in 
the 
second. 
For 
‘it 
is 
impossible’ 
is 
a 
positive 
proposition 
and 
‘it 
is 
not 
impossible’ 
is 
negative. 


We 
must 
investigate 
the 
relation 
subsisting 
between 
these 
propositions 
and 
those 
which 
predicate 
necessity. 
That 
there 
is 
a 
distinction 
is 
clear. 
In 
this 
case, 
contrary 
propositions 
follow 
respectively 
from 
contradictory 



propositions, 
and 
the 
contradictory 
propositions 
belong 
to 
separate 
sequences. 
For 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
be’ 
is 
not 
the 
negative 
of 
‘it 
is 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be’, 
for 
both 
these 
propositions 
may 
be 
true 
of 
the 
same 
subject; 
for 
when 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
a 
thing 
should 
not 
be, 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
be. 
The 
reason 
why 
the 
propositions 
predicating 
necessity 
do 
not 
follow 
in 
the 
same 
kind 
of 
sequence 
as 
the 
rest, 
lies 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
is 
impossible’ 
is 
equivalent, 
when 
used 
with 
a 
contrary 
subject, 
to 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
is 
necessary’. 
For 
when 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
a 
thing 
should 
be, 
it 
is 
necessary, 
not 
that 
it 
should 
be, 
but 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be, 
and 
when 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
a 
thing 
should 
not 
be, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
be. 
Thus, 
if 
the 
propositions 
predicating 
impossibility 
or 
non-impossibility 
follow 
without 
change 
of 
subject 
from 
those 
predicating 
possibility 
or 
non-possibility, 
those 
predicating 
necessity 
must 
follow 
with 
the 
contrary 
subject; 
for 
the 
propositions 
‘it 
is 
impossible’ 
and 
‘it 
is 
necessary’ 
are 
not 
equivalent, 
but, 
as 
has 
been 
said, 
inversely 
connected. 


Yet 
perhaps 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
the 
contradictory 
propositions 
predicating 
necessity 
should 
be 
thus 
arranged. 
For 
when 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
a 
thing 
should 
be, 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
it 
should 
be. 
(For 
if 
not, 
the 
opposite 
follows, 
since 
one 
or 
the 
other 
must 
follow; 
so, 
if 
it 
is 
not 
possible, 
it 
is 
impossible, 
and 
it 
is 
thus 
impossible 
that 
a 
thing 
should 
be, 
which 
must 
necessarily 
be; 
which 
is 
absurd.) 


Yet 
from 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
may 
be’ 
it 
follows 
that 
it 
is 
not 
impossible, 
and 
from 
that 
it 
follows 
that 
it 
is 
not 
necessary; 
it 
comes 
about 
therefore 
that 
the 
thing 
which 
must 
necessarily 
be 
need 
not 
be; 
which 
is 
absurd. 
But 
again, 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
is 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
be’ 
does 
not 
follow 
from 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
may 
be’, 
nor 
does 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
is 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be’. 
For 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
may 
be’ 
implies 
a 
twofold 
possibility, 
while, 
if 
either 
of 
the 
two 
former 
propositions 
is 
true, 
the 
twofold 
possibility 
vanishes. 
For 
if 
a 
thing 
may 
be, 
it 
may 
also 
not 
be, 
but 
if 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
be 
or 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be, 
one 
of 
the 
two 
alternatives 
will 
be 
excluded. 
It 
remains, 
therefore, 
that 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be’ 
follows 
from 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
may 
be’. 
For 
this 
is 
true 
also 
of 
that 
which 
must 
necessarily 
be. 


Moreover 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be’ 
is 
the 
contradictory 
of 
that 
which 
follows 
from 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
cannot 
be’; 
for 
‘it 
cannot 
be’ 
is 
followed 
by 
‘it 
is 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
be’ 
and 
by 
‘it 
is 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be’, 
and 
the 
contradictory 
of 
this 
is 
the 



proposition 
‘it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be’. 
Thus 
in 
this 
case 
also 
contradictory 
propositions 
follow 
contradictory 
in 
the 
way 
indicated, 
and 
no 
logical 
impossibilities 
occur 
when 
they 
are 
thus 
arranged. 


It 
may 
be 
questioned 
whether 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
may 
be’ 
follows 
from 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
is 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
be’. 
If 
not, 
the 
contradictory 
must 
follow, 
namely 
that 
it 
cannot 
be, 
or, 
if 
a 
man 
should 
maintain 
that 
this 
is 
not 
the 
contradictory, 
then 
the 
proposition 
‘it 
may 
not 
be’. 


Now 
both 
of 
these 
are 
false 
of 
that 
which 
necessarily 
is. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
it 
is 
thought 
that 
if 
a 
thing 
may 
be 
cut 
it 
may 
also 
not 
be 
cut, 
if 
a 
thing 
may 
be 
it 
may 
also 
not 
be, 
and 
thus 
it 
would 
follow 
that 
a 
thing 
which 
must 
necessarily 
be 
may 
possibly 
not 
be; 
which 
is 
false. 
It 
is 
evident, 
then, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
always 
the 
case 
that 
that 
which 
may 
be 
or 
may 
walk 
possesses 
also 
a 
potentiality 
in 
the 
other 
direction. 
There 
are 
exceptions. 
In 
the 
first 
place 
we 
must 
except 
those 
things 
which 
possess 
a 
potentiality 
not 
in 
accordance 
with 
a 
rational 
principle, 
as 
fire 
possesses 
the 
potentiality 
of 
giving 
out 
heat, 
that 
is, 
an 
irrational 
capacity. 
Those 
potentialities 
which 
involve 
a 
rational 
principle 
are 
potentialities 
of 
more 
than 
one 
result, 
that 
is, 
of 
contrary 
results; 
those 
that 
are 
irrational 
are 
not 
always 
thus 
constituted. 
As 
I 
have 
said, 
fire 
cannot 
both 
heat 
and 
not 
heat, 
neither 
has 
anything 
that 
is 
always 
actual 
any 
twofold 
potentiality. 
Yet 
some 
even 
of 
those 
potentialities 
which 
are 
irrational 
admit 
of 
opposite 
results. 
However, 
thus 
much 
has 
been 
said 
to 
emphasize 
the 
truth 
that 
it 
is 
not 
every 
potentiality 
which 
admits 
of 
opposite 
results, 
even 
where 
the 
word 
is 
used 
always 
in 
the 
same 
sense. 


But 
in 
some 
cases 
the 
word 
is 
used 
equivocally. 
For 
the 
term 
‘possible’ 
is 
ambiguous, 
being 
used 
in 
the 
one 
case 
with 
reference 
to 
facts, 
to 
that 
which 
is 
actualized, 
as 
when 
a 
man 
is 
said 
to 
find 
walking 
possible 
because 
he 
is 
actually 
walking, 
and 
generally 
when 
a 
capacity 
is 
predicated 
because 
it 
is 
actually 
realized; 
in 
the 
other 
case, 
with 
reference 
to 
a 
state 
in 
which 
realization 
is 
conditionally 
practicable, 
as 
when 
a 
man 
is 
said 
to 
find 
walking 
possible 
because 
under 
certain 
conditions 
he 
would 
walk. 
This 
last 
sort 
of 
potentiality 
belongs 
only 
to 
that 
which 
can 
be 
in 
motion, 
the 
former 
can 
exist 
also 
in 
the 
case 
of 
that 
which 
has 
not 
this 
power. 
Both 
of 
that 
which 
is 
walking 
and 
is 
actual, 
and 
of 
that 
which 
has 
the 
capacity 
though 
not 
necessarily 
realized, 
it 
is 
true 
to 
say 
that 
it 
is 
not 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
walk 
(or, 
in 
the 
other 
case, 
that 
it 
should 
be), 
but 
while 
we 
cannot 
predicate 
this 
latter 
kind 
of 
potentiality 
of 
that 
which 
is 
necessary 
in 
the 
unqualified 
sense 
of 
the 
word, 
we 
can 
predicate 
the 
former. 



Our 
conclusion, 
then, 
is 
this: 
that 
since 
the 
universal 
is 
consequent 
upon 
the 
particular, 
that 
which 
is 
necessary 
is 
also 
possible, 
though 
not 
in 
every 
sense 
in 
which 
the 
word 
may 
be 
used. 


We 
may 
perhaps 
state 
that 
necessity 
and 
its 
absence 
are 
the 
initial 
principles 
of 
existence 
and 
non-existence, 
and 
that 
all 
else 
must 
be 
regarded 
as 
posterior 
to 
these. 


It 
is 
plain 
from 
what 
has 
been 
said 
that 
that 
which 
is 
of 
necessity 
is 
actual. 
Thus, 
if 
that 
which 
is 
eternal 
is 
prior, 
actuality 
also 
is 
prior 
to 
potentiality. 
Some 
things 
are 
actualities 
without 
potentiality, 
namely, 
the 
primary 
substances; 
a 
second 
class 
consists 
of 
those 
things 
which 
are 
actual 
but 
also 
potential, 
whose 
actuality 
is 
in 
nature 
prior 
to 
their 
potentiality, 
though 
posterior 
in 
time; 
a 
third 
class 
comprises 
those 
things 
which 
are 
never 
actualized, 
but 
are 
pure 
potentialities. 


The 
question 
arises 
whether 
an 
affirmation 
finds 
its 
contrary 
in 
a 
denial 
or 
in 
another 
affirmation; 
whether 
the 
proposition 
‘every 
man 
is 
just’ 
finds 
its 
contrary 
in 
the 
proposition 
‘no 
man 
is 
just’, 
or 
in 
the 
proposition 
‘every 
man 
is 
unjust’. 
Take 
the 
propositions 
‘Callias 
is 
just’, 
‘Callias 
is 
not 
just’, 
‘Callias 
is 
unjust’; 
we 
have 
to 
discover 
which 
of 
these 
form 
contraries. 


Now 
if 
the 
spoken 
word 
corresponds 
with 
the 
judgement 
of 
the 
mind, 
and 
if, 
in 
thought, 
that 
judgement 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
another, 
which 
pronounces 
a 
contrary 
fact, 
in 
the 
way, 
for 
instance, 
in 
which 
the 
judgement 
‘every 
man 
is 
just’ 
pronounces 
a 
contrary 
to 
that 
pronounced 
by 
the 
judgement 
‘every 
man 
is 
unjust’, 
the 
same 
must 
needs 
hold 
good 
with 
regard 
to 
spoken 
affirmations. 


But 
if, 
in 
thought, 
it 
is 
not 
the 
judgement 
which 
pronounces 
a 
contrary 
fact 
that 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
another, 
then 
one 
affirmation 
will 
not 
find 
its 
contrary 
in 
another, 
but 
rather 
in 
the 
corresponding 
denial. 
We 
must 
therefore 
consider 
which 
true 
judgement 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
false, 
that 
which 
forms 
the 
denial 
of 
the 
false 
judgement 
or 
that 
which 
affirms 
the 
contrary 
fact. 


Let 
me 
illustrate. 
There 
is 
a 
true 
judgement 
concerning 
that 
which 
is 
good, 
that 
it 
is 
good; 
another, 
a 
false 
judgement, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
good; 
and 
a 
third, 
which 
is 
distinct, 
that 
it 
is 
bad. 
Which 
of 
these 
two 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
true? 
And 
if 
they 
are 
one 
and 
the 
same, 
which 
mode 
of 
expression 
forms 
the 
contrary? 


It 
is 
an 
error 
to 
suppose 
that 
judgements 
are 
to 
be 
defined 
as 
contrary 
in 



virtue 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
have 
contrary 
subjects; 
for 
the 
judgement 
concerning 
a 
good 
thing, 
that 
it 
is 
good, 
and 
that 
concerning 
a 
bad 
thing, 
that 
it 
is 
bad, 
may 
be 
one 
and 
the 
same, 
and 
whether 
they 
are 
so 
or 
not, 
they 
both 
represent 
the 
truth. 
Yet 
the 
subjects 
here 
are 
contrary. 
But 
judgements 
are 
not 
contrary 
because 
they 
have 
contrary 
subjects, 
but 
because 
they 
are 
to 
the 
contrary 
effect. 


Now 
if 
we 
take 
the 
judgement 
that 
that 
which 
is 
good 
is 
good, 
and 
another 
that 
it 
is 
not 
good, 
and 
if 
there 
are 
at 
the 
same 
time 
other 
attributes, 
which 
do 
not 
and 
cannot 
belong 
to 
the 
good, 
we 
must 
nevertheless 
refuse 
to 
treat 
as 
the 
contraries 
of 
the 
true 
judgement 
those 
which 
opine 
that 
some 
other 
attribute 
subsists 
which 
does 
not 
subsist, 
as 
also 
those 
that 
opine 
that 
some 
other 
attribute 
does 
not 
subsist 
which 
does 
subsist, 
for 
both 
these 
classes 
of 
judgement 
are 
of 
unlimited 
content. 


Those 
judgements 
must 
rather 
be 
termed 
contrary 
to 
the 
true 
judgements, 
in 
which 
error 
is 
present. 
Now 
these 
judgements 
are 
those 
which 
are 
concerned 
with 
the 
starting 
points 
of 
generation, 
and 
generation 
is 
the 
passing 
from 
one 
extreme 
to 
its 
opposite; 
therefore 
error 
is 
a 
like 
transition. 


Now 
that 
which 
is 
good 
is 
both 
good 
and 
not 
bad. 
The 
first 
quality 
is 
part 
of 
its 
essence, 
the 
second 
accidental; 
for 
it 
is 
by 
accident 
that 
it 
is 
not 
bad. 
But 
if 
that 
true 
judgement 
is 
most 
really 
true, 
which 
concerns 
the 
subject’s 
intrinsic 
nature, 
then 
that 
false 
judgement 
likewise 
is 
most 
really 
false, 
which 
concerns 
its 
intrinsic 
nature. 
Now 
the 
judgement 
that 
that 
is 
good 
is 
not 
good 
is 
a 
false 
judgement 
concerning 
its 
intrinsic 
nature, 
the 
judgement 
that 
it 
is 
bad 
is 
one 
concerning 
that 
which 
is 
accidental. 
Thus 
the 
judgement 
which 
denies 
the 
true 
judgement 
is 
more 
really 
false 
than 
that 
which 
positively 
asserts 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
contrary 
quality. 
But 
it 
is 
the 
man 
who 
forms 
that 
judgement 
which 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
true 
who 
is 
most 
thoroughly 
deceived, 
for 
contraries 
are 
among 
the 
things 
which 
differ 
most 
widely 
within 
the 
same 
class. 
If 
then 
of 
the 
two 
judgements 
one 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
true 
judgement, 
but 
that 
which 
is 
contradictory 
is 
the 
more 
truly 
contrary, 
then 
the 
latter, 
it 
seems, 
is 
the 
real 
contrary. 
The 
judgement 
that 
that 
which 
is 
good 
is 
bad 
is 
composite. 
For 
presumably 
the 
man 
who 
forms 
that 
judgement 
must 
at 
the 
same 
time 
understand 
that 
that 
which 
is 
good 
is 
not 
good. 


Further, 
the 
contradictory 
is 
either 
always 
the 
contrary 
or 
never; 
therefore, 
if 
it 
must 
necessarily 
be 
so 
in 
all 
other 
cases, 
our 
conclusion 
in 
the 
case 
just 
dealt 
with 
would 
seem 
to 
be 
correct. 
Now 
where 
terms 
have 
no 
contrary, 
that 
judgement 
is 
false, 
which 
forms 
the 
negative 
of 
the 
true; 
for 
instance, 
he 
who 



thinks 
a 
man 
is 
not 
a 
man 
forms 
a 
false 
judgement. 
If 
then 
in 
these 
cases 
the 
negative 
is 
the 
contrary, 
then 
the 
principle 
is 
universal 
in 
its 
application. 


Again, 
the 
judgement 
that 
that 
which 
is 
not 
good 
is 
not 
good 
is 
parallel 
with 
the 
judgement 
that 
that 
which 
is 
good 
is 
good. 
Besides 
these 
there 
is 
the 
judgement 
that 
that 
which 
is 
good 
is 
not 
good, 
parallel 
with 
the 
judgement 
that 
that 
that 
is 
not 
good 
is 
good. 
Let 
us 
consider, 
therefore, 
what 
would 
form 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
true 
judgement 
that 
that 
which 
is 
not 
good 
is 
not 
good. 
The 
judgement 
that 
it 
is 
bad 
would, 
of 
course, 
fail 
to 
meet 
the 
case, 
since 
two 
true 
judgements 
are 
never 
contrary 
and 
this 
judgement 
might 
be 
true 
at 
the 
same 
time 
as 
that 
with 
which 
it 
is 
connected. 
For 
since 
some 
things 
which 
are 
not 
good 
are 
bad, 
both 
judgements 
may 
be 
true. 
Nor 
is 
the 
judgement 
that 
it 
is 
not 
bad 
the 
contrary, 
for 
this 
too 
might 
be 
true, 
since 
both 
qualities 
might 
be 
predicated 
of 
the 
same 
subject. 
It 
remains, 
therefore, 
that 
of 
the 
judgement 
concerning 
that 
which 
is 
not 
good, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
good, 
the 
contrary 
judgement 
is 
that 
it 
is 
good; 
for 
this 
is 
false. 
In 
the 
same 
way, 
moreover, 
the 
judgement 
concerning 
that 
which 
is 
good, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
good, 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
judgement 
that 
it 
is 
good. 


It 
is 
evident 
that 
it 
will 
make 
no 
difference 
if 
we 
universalize 
the 
positive 
judgement, 
for 
the 
universal 
negative 
judgement 
will 
form 
the 
contrary. 
For 
instance, 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
judgement 
that 
everything 
that 
is 
good 
is 
good 
is 
that 
nothing 
that 
is 
good 
is 
good. 
For 
the 
judgement 
that 
that 
which 
is 
good 
is 
good, 
if 
the 
subject 
be 
understood 
in 
a 
universal 
sense, 
is 
equivalent 
to 
the 
judgement 
that 
whatever 
is 
good 
is 
good, 
and 
this 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
judgement 
that 
everything 
that 
is 
good 
is 
good. 
We 
may 
deal 
similarly 
with 
judgements 
concerning 
that 
which 
is 
not 
good. 


If 
therefore 
this 
is 
the 
rule 
with 
judgements, 
and 
if 
spoken 
affirmations 
and 
denials 
are 
judgements 
expressed 
in 
words, 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
the 
universal 
denial 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
affirmation 
about 
the 
same 
subject. 
Thus 
the 
propositions 
‘everything 
good 
is 
good’, 
‘every 
man 
is 
good’, 
have 
for 
their 
contraries 
the 
propositions 
‘nothing 
good 
is 
good’, 
‘no 
man 
is 
good’. 
The 
contradictory 
propositions, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
are 
‘not 
everything 
good 
is 
good’, 
‘not 
every 
man 
is 
good’. 


It 
is 
evident, 
also, 
that 
neither 
true 
judgements 
nor 
true 
propositions 
can 
be 
contrary 
the 
one 
to 
the 
other. 
For 
whereas, 
when 
two 
propositions 
are 
true, 
a 
man 
may 
state 
both 
at 
the 
same 
time 
without 
inconsistency, 
contrary 
propositions 
are 
those 
which 
state 
contrary 
conditions, 
and 
contrary 
conditions 
cannot 
subsist 
at 
one 
and 
the 
same 
time 
in 
the 
same 
subject. 



Prior

Translated

A. 
J. 
Jenkinson 


We 
must 
first 
state 
the 
subject 
of 
our 
inquiry 
and 
the 
faculty 
to 
which 
it 
belongs: 
its 
subject 
is 
demonstration 
and 
the 
faculty 
that 
carries 
it 
out 
demonstrative 
science. 
We 
must 
next 
define 
a 
premiss, 
a 
term, 
and 
a 
syllogism, 
and 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
perfect 
and 
of 
an 
imperfect 
syllogism; 
and 
after 
that, 
the 
inclusion 
or 
noninclusion 
of 
one 
term 
in 
another 
as 
in 
a 
whole, 
and 
what 
we 
mean 
by 
predicating 
one 
term 
of 
all, 
or 
none, 
of 
another. 


A 
premiss 
then 
is 
a 
sentence 
affirming 
or 
denying 
one 
thing 
of 
another. 
This 
is 
either 
universal 
or 
particular 
or 
indefinite. 
By 
universal 
I 
mean 
the 
statement 
that 
something 
belongs 
to 
all 
or 
none 
of 
something 
else; 
by 
particular 
that 
it 
belongs 
to 
some 
or 
not 
to 
some 
or 
not 
to 
all; 
by 
indefinite 
that 
it 
does 
or 
does 
not 
belong, 
without 
any 
mark 
to 
show 
whether 
it 
is 
universal 
or 
particular, 
e.g. 
‘contraries 
are 
subjects 
of 
the 
same 
science’, 
or 
‘pleasure 
is 
not 
good’. 
The 
demonstrative 
premiss 
differs 
from 
the 
dialectical, 
because 
the 
demonstrative 
premiss 
is 
the 
assertion 
of 
one 
of 
two 
contradictory 
statements 
(the 
demonstrator 
does 
not 
ask 
for 
his 
premiss, 
but 
lays 
it 
down), 
whereas 
the 
dialectical 
premiss 
depends 
on 
the 
adversary’s 
choice 
between 
two 
contradictories. 
But 
this 
will 
make 
no 
difference 
to 
the 
production 
of 
a 
syllogism 
in 
either 
case; 
for 
both 
the 
demonstrator 
and 
the 
dialectician 
argue 
syllogistically 
after 
stating 
that 
something 
does 
or 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
something 
else. 
Therefore 
a 
syllogistic 
premiss 
without 
qualification 
will 
be 
an 
affirmation 
or 
denial 
of 
something 
concerning 
something 
else 
in 
the 
way 
we 
have 
described; 
it 
will 
be 
demonstrative, 
if 
it 
is 
true 
and 
obtained 
through 
the 
first 
principles 
of 
its 
science; 
while 
a 
dialectical 
premiss 
is 
the 
giving 
of 
a 
choice 
between 
two 
contradictories, 
when 
a 
man 
is 
proceeding 
by 
question, 
but 
when 
he 
is 
syllogizing 
it 
is 
the 
assertion 
of 
that 
which 
is 
apparent 
and 
generally 
admitted, 
as 
has 
been 
said 
in 
the 
Topics. 
The 
nature 
then 
of 
a 
premiss 
and 
the 
difference 
between 
syllogistic, 
demonstrative, 
and 
dialectical 
premisses, 
may 
be 
taken 
as 
sufficiently 
defined 
by 
us 
in 
relation 
to 
our 
present 
need, 
but 
will 
be 
stated 
accurately 
in 
the 



sequel. 


I 
call 
that 
a 
term 
into 
which 
the 
premiss 
is 
resolved, 
i.e. 
both 
the 
predicate 
and 
that 
of 
which 
it 
is 
predicated, 
‘being’ 
being 
added 
and 
‘not 
being’ 
removed, 
or 
vice 
versa. 


A 
syllogism 
is 
discourse 
in 
which, 
certain 
things 
being 
stated, 
something 
other 
than 
what 
is 
stated 
follows 
of 
necessity 
from 
their 
being 
so. 
I 
mean 
by 
the 
last 
phrase 
that 
they 
produce 
the 
consequence, 
and 
by 
this, 
that 
no 
further 
term 
is 
required 
from 
without 
in 
order 
to 
make 
the 
consequence 
necessary. 


I 
call 
that 
a 
perfect 
syllogism 
which 
needs 
nothing 
other 
than 
what 
has 
been 
stated 
to 
make 
plain 
what 
necessarily 
follows; 
a 
syllogism 
is 
imperfect, 
if 
it 
needs 
either 
one 
or 
more 
propositions, 
which 
are 
indeed 
the 
necessary 
consequences 
of 
the 
terms 
set 
down, 
but 
have 
not 
been 
expressly 
stated 
as 
premisses. 


That 
one 
term 
should 
be 
included 
in 
another 
as 
in 
a 
whole 
is 
the 
same 
as 
for 
the 
other 
to 
be 
predicated 
of 
all 
of 
the 
first. 
And 
we 
say 
that 
one 
term 
is 
predicated 
of 
all 
of 
another, 
whenever 
no 
instance 
of 
the 
subject 
can 
be 
found 
of 
which 
the 
other 
term 
cannot 
be 
asserted: 
‘to 
be 
predicated 
of 
none’ 
must 
be 
understood 
in 
the 
same 
way. 


Every 
premiss 
states 
that 
something 
either 
is 
or 
must 
be 
or 
may 
be 
the 
attribute 
of 
something 
else; 
of 
premisses 
of 
these 
three 
kinds 
some 
are 
affirmative, 
others 
negative, 
in 
respect 
of 
each 
of 
the 
three 
modes 
of 
attribution; 
again 
some 
affirmative 
and 
negative 
premisses 
are 
universal, 
others 
particular, 
others 
indefinite. 
It 
is 
necessary 
then 
that 
in 
universal 
attribution 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
negative 
premiss 
should 
be 
convertible, 
e.g. 
if 
no 
pleasure 
is 
good, 
then 
no 
good 
will 
be 
pleasure; 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
affirmative 
must 
be 
convertible, 
not 
however, 
universally, 
but 
in 
part, 
e.g. 
if 
every 
pleasure,is 
good, 
some 
good 
must 
be 
pleasure; 
the 
particular 
affirmative 
must 
convert 
in 
part 
(for 
if 
some 
pleasure 
is 
good, 
then 
some 
good 
will 
be 
pleasure); 
but 
the 
particular 
negative 
need 
not 
convert, 
for 
if 
some 
animal 
is 
not 
man, 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
some 
man 
is 
not 
animal. 


First 
then 
take 
a 
universal 
negative 
with 
the 
terms 
A 
and 
B. 
If 
no 
B 
is 
A, 
neither 
can 
any 
A 
be 
B. 
For 
if 
some 
A 
(say 
C) 
were 
B, 
it 
would 
not 
be 
true 
that 
no 
B 
is 
A; 
for 
C 
is 
a 
B. 
But 
if 
every 
B 
is 
A 
then 
some 
A 
is 
B. 
For 
if 
no 
A 
were 
B, 
then 
no 
B 
could 
be 
A. 
But 
we 
assumed 
that 
every 
B 
is 
A. 
Similarly 



too, 
if 
the 
premiss 
is 
particular. 
For 
if 
some 
B 
is 
A, 
then 
some 
of 
the 
As 
must 
be 
B. 
For 
if 
none 
were, 
then 
no 
B 
would 
be 
A. 
But 
if 
some 
B 
is 
not 
A, 
there 
is 
no 
necessity 
that 
some 
of 
the 
As 
should 
not 
be 
B; 
e.g. 
let 
B 
stand 
for 
animal 
and 
A 
for 
man. 
Not 
every 
animal 
is 
a 
man; 
but 
every 
man 
is 
an 
animal. 


The 
same 
manner 
of 
conversion 
will 
hold 
good 
also 
in 
respect 
of 
necessary 
premisses. 
The 
universal 
negative 
converts 
universally; 
each 
of 
the 
affirmatives 
converts 
into 
a 
particular. 
If 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
no 
B 
is 
A, 
it 
is 
necessary 
also 
that 
no 
A 
is 
B. 
For 
if 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
some 
A 
is 
B, 
it 
would 
be 
possible 
also 
that 
some 
B 
is 
A. 
If 
all 
or 
some 
B 
is 
A 
of 
necessity, 
it 
is 
necessary 
also 
that 
some 
A 
is 
B: 
for 
if 
there 
were 
no 
necessity, 
neither 
would 
some 
of 
the 
Bs 
be 
A 
necessarily. 
But 
the 
particular 
negative 
does 
not 
convert, 
for 
the 
same 
reason 
which 
we 
have 
already 
stated. 


In 
respect 
of 
possible 
premisses, 
since 
possibility 
is 
used 
in 
several 
senses 
(for 
we 
say 
that 
what 
is 
necessary 
and 
what 
is 
not 
necessary 
and 
what 
is 
potential 
is 
possible), 
affirmative 
statements 
will 
all 
convert 
in 
a 
manner 
similar 
to 
those 
described. 
For 
if 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
all 
or 
some 
B 
is 
A, 
it 
will 
be 
possible 
that 
some 
A 
is 
B. 
For 
if 
that 
were 
not 
possible, 
then 
no 
B 
could 
possibly 
be 
A. 
This 
has 
been 
already 
proved. 
But 
in 
negative 
statements 
the 
case 
is 
different. 
Whatever 
is 
said 
to 
be 
possible, 
either 
because 
B 
necessarily 
is 
A, 
or 
because 
B 
is 
not 
necessarily 
A, 
admits 
of 
conversion 
like 
other 
negative 
statements, 
e.g. 
if 
one 
should 
say, 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
man 
is 
not 
horse, 
or 
that 
no 
garment 
is 
white. 
For 
in 
the 
former 
case 
the 
one 
term 
necessarily 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
the 
other; 
in 
the 
latter 
there 
is 
no 
necessity 
that 
it 
should: 
and 
the 
premiss 
converts 
like 
other 
negative 
statements. 
For 
if 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
no 
man 
to 
be 
a 
horse, 
it 
is 
also 
admissible 
for 
no 
horse 
to 
be 
a 
man; 
and 
if 
it 
is 
admissible 
for 
no 
garment 
to 
be 
white, 
it 
is 
also 
admissible 
for 
nothing 
white 
to 
be 
a 
garment. 
For 
if 
any 
white 
thing 
must 
be 
a 
garment, 
then 
some 
garment 
will 
necessarily 
be 
white. 
This 
has 
been 
already 
proved. 
The 
particular 
negative 
also 
must 
be 
treated 
like 
those 
dealt 
with 
above. 
But 
if 
anything 
is 
said 
to 
be 
possible 
because 
it 
is 
the 
general 
rule 
and 
natural 
(and 
it 
is 
in 
this 
way 
we 
define 
the 
possible), 
the 
negative 
premisses 
can 
no 
longer 
be 
converted 
like 
the 
simple 
negatives; 
the 
universal 
negative 
premiss 
does 
not 
convert, 
and 
the 
particular 
does. 
This 
will 
be 
plain 
when 
we 
speak 
about 



the 
possible. 
At 
present 
we 
may 
take 
this 
much 
as 
clear 
in 
addition 
to 
what 
has 
been 
said: 
the 
statement 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
no 
B 
is 
A 
or 
some 
B 
is 
not 
A 
is 
affirmative 
in 
form: 
for 
the 
expression 
‘is 
possible’ 
ranks 
along 
with 
‘is’, 
and 
‘is’ 
makes 
an 
affirmation 
always 
and 
in 
every 
case, 
whatever 
the 
terms 
to 
which 
it 
is 
added, 
in 
predication, 
e.g. 
‘it 
is 
not-good’ 
or 
‘it 
is 
not-white’ 
or 
in 
a 
word 
‘it 
is 
not-this’. 
But 
this 
also 
will 
be 
proved 
in 
the 
sequel. 
In 
conversion 
these 
premisses 
will 
behave 
like 
the 
other 
affirmative 
propositions. 


After 
these 
distinctions 
we 
now 
state 
by 
what 
means, 
when, 
and 
how 
every 
syllogism 
is 
produced; 
subsequently 
we 
must 
speak 
of 
demonstration. 
Syllogism 
should 
be 
discussed 
before 
demonstration 
because 
syllogism 
is 
the 
general: 
the 
demonstration 
is 
a 
sort 
of 
syllogism, 
but 
not 
every 
syllogism 
is 
a 
demonstration. 


Whenever 
three 
terms 
are 
so 
related 
to 
one 
another 
that 
the 
last 
is 
contained 
in 
the 
middle 
as 
in 
a 
whole, 
and 
the 
middle 
is 
either 
contained 
in, 
or 
excluded 
from, 
the 
first 
as 
in 
or 
from 
a 
whole, 
the 
extremes 
must 
be 
related 
by 
a 
perfect 
syllogism. 
I 
call 
that 
term 
middle 
which 
is 
itself 
contained 
in 
another 
and 
contains 
another 
in 
itself: 
in 
position 
also 
this 
comes 
in 
the 
middle. 
By 
extremes 
I 
mean 
both 
that 
term 
which 
is 
itself 
contained 
in 
another 
and 
that 
in 
which 
another 
is 
contained. 
If 
A 
is 
predicated 
of 
all 
B, 
and 
B 
of 
all 
C, 
A 
must 
be 
predicated 
of 
all 
C: 
we 
have 
already 
explained 
what 
we 
mean 
by 
‘predicated 
of 
all’. 
Similarly 
also, 
if 
A 
is 
predicated 
of 
no 
B, 
and 
B 
of 
all 
C, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
no 
C 
will 
be 
A. 


But 
if 
the 
first 
term 
belongs 
to 
all 
the 
middle, 
but 
the 
middle 
to 
none 
of 
the 
last 
term, 
there 
will 
be 
no 
syllogism 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
extremes; 
for 
nothing 
necessary 
follows 
from 
the 
terms 
being 
so 
related; 
for 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
first 
should 
belong 
either 
to 
all 
or 
to 
none 
of 
the 
last, 
so 
that 
neither 
a 
particular 
nor 
a 
universal 
conclusion 
is 
necessary. 
But 
if 
there 
is 
no 
necessary 
consequence, 
there 
cannot 
be 
a 
syllogism 
by 
means 
of 
these 
premisses. 
As 
an 
example 
of 
a 
universal 
affirmative 
relation 
between 
the 
extremes 
we 
may 
take 
the 
terms 
animal, 
man, 
horse; 
of 
a 
universal 
negative 
relation, 
the 
terms 
animal, 
man, 
stone. 
Nor 
again 
can 
syllogism 
be 
formed 
when 
neither 
the 
first 
term 
belongs 
to 
any 
of 
the 
middle, 
nor 
the 
middle 
to 
any 
of 
the 
last. 
As 
an 
example 
of 
a 
positive 
relation 
between 
the 
extremes 
take 
the 
terms 
science, 



line, 
medicine: 
of 
a 
negative 
relation 
science, 
line, 
unit. 


If 
then 
the 
terms 
are 
universally 
related, 
it 
is 
clear 
in 
this 
figure 
when 
a 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible 
and 
when 
not, 
and 
that 
if 
a 
syllogism 
is 
possible 
the 
terms 
must 
be 
related 
as 
described, 
and 
if 
they 
are 
so 
related 
there 
will 
be 
a 
syllogism. 


But 
if 
one 
term 
is 
related 
universally, 
the 
other 
in 
part 
only, 
to 
its 
subject, 
there 
must 
be 
a 
perfect 
syllogism 
whenever 
universality 
is 
posited 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
major 
term 
either 
affirmatively 
or 
negatively, 
and 
particularity 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
minor 
term 
affirmatively: 
but 
whenever 
the 
universality 
is 
posited 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
minor 
term, 
or 
the 
terms 
are 
related 
in 
any 
other 
way, 
a 
syllogism 
is 
impossible. 
I 
call 
that 
term 
the 
major 
in 
which 
the 
middle 
is 
contained 
and 
that 
term 
the 
minor 
which 
comes 
under 
the 
middle. 
Let 
all 
B 
be 
A 
and 
some 
C 
be 
B. 
Then 
if 
‘predicated 
of 
all’ 
means 
what 
was 
said 
above, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
some 
C 
is 
A. 
And 
if 
no 
B 
is 
A 
but 
some 
C 
is 
B, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
some 
C 
is 
not 
A. 
The 
meaning 
of 
‘predicated 
of 
none’ 
has 
also 
been 
defined. 
So 
there 
will 
be 
a 
perfect 
syllogism. 
This 
holds 
good 
also 
if 
the 
premiss 
BC 
should 
be 
indefinite, 
provided 
that 
it 
is 
affirmative: 
for 
we 
shall 
have 
the 
same 
syllogism 
whether 
the 
premiss 
is 
indefinite 
or 
particular. 


But 
if 
the 
universality 
is 
posited 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
minor 
term 
either 
affirmatively 
or 
negatively, 
a 
syllogism 
will 
not 
be 
possible, 
whether 
the 
major 
premiss 
is 
positive 
or 
negative, 
indefinite 
or 
particular: 
e.g. 
if 
some 
B 
is 
or 
is 
not 
A, 
and 
all 
C 
is 
B. 
As 
an 
example 
of 
a 
positive 
relation 
between 
the 
extremes 
take 
the 
terms 
good, 
state, 
wisdom: 
of 
a 
negative 
relation, 
good, 
state, 
ignorance. 
Again 
if 
no 
C 
is 
B, 
but 
some 
B 
is 
or 
is 
not 
A 
or 
not 
every 
B 
is 
A, 
there 
cannot 
be 
a 
syllogism. 
Take 
the 
terms 
white, 
horse, 
swan: 
white, 
horse, 
raven. 
The 
same 
terms 
may 
be 
taken 
also 
if 
the 
premiss 
BA 
is 
indefinite. 


Nor 
when 
the 
major 
premiss 
is 
universal, 
whether 
affirmative 
or 
negative, 
and 
the 
minor 
premiss 
is 
negative 
and 
particular, 
can 
there 
be 
a 
syllogism, 
whether 
the 
minor 
premiss 
be 
indefinite 
or 
particular: 
e.g. 
if 
all 
B 
is 
A 
and 
some 
C 
is 
not 
B, 
or 
if 
not 
all 
C 
is 
B. 
For 
the 
major 
term 
may 
be 
predicable 
both 
of 
all 
and 
of 
none 
of 
the 
minor, 
to 
some 
of 
which 
the 
middle 
term 
cannot 
be 
attributed. 
Suppose 
the 
terms 
are 
animal, 
man, 
white: 
next 
take 
some 
of 
the 
white 
things 
of 
which 
man 
is 
not 
predicated-swan 
and 
snow: 
animal 
is 
predicated 
of 
all 
of 
the 
one, 
but 
of 
none 
of 
the 
other. 
Consequently 
there 
cannot 
be 
a 
syllogism. 
Again 
let 
no 
B 
be 
A, 
but 
let 
some 
C 
not 
be 
B. 
Take 
the 



terms 
inanimate, 
man, 
white: 
then 
take 
some 
white 
things 
of 
which 
man 
is 
not 
predicated-swan 
and 
snow: 
the 
term 
inanimate 
is 
predicated 
of 
all 
of 
the 
one, 
of 
none 
of 
the 
other. 


Further 
since 
it 
is 
indefinite 
to 
say 
some 
C 
is 
not 
B, 
and 
it 
is 
true 
that 
some 
C 
is 
not 
B, 
whether 
no 
C 
is 
B, 
or 
not 
all 
C 
is 
B, 
and 
since 
if 
terms 
are 
assumed 
such 
that 
no 
C 
is 
B, 
no 
syllogism 
follows 
(this 
has 
already 
been 
stated) 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
this 
arrangement 
of 
terms 
will 
not 
afford 
a 
syllogism: 
otherwise 
one 
would 
have 
been 
possible 
with 
a 
universal 
negative 
minor 
premiss. 
A 
similar 
proof 
may 
also 
be 
given 
if 
the 
universal 
premiss 
is 
negative. 


Nor 
can 
there 
in 
any 
way 
be 
a 
syllogism 
if 
both 
the 
relations 
of 
subject 
and 
predicate 
are 
particular, 
either 
positively 
or 
negatively, 
or 
the 
one 
negative 
and 
the 
other 
affirmative, 
or 
one 
indefinite 
and 
the 
other 
definite, 
or 
both 
indefinite. 
Terms 
common 
to 
all 
the 
above 
are 
animal, 
white, 
horse: 
animal, 
white, 
stone. 


It 
is 
clear 
then 
from 
what 
has 
been 
said 
that 
if 
there 
is 
a 
syllogism 
in 
this 
figure 
with 
a 
particular 
conclusion, 
the 
terms 
must 
be 
related 
as 
we 
have 
stated: 
if 
they 
are 
related 
otherwise, 
no 
syllogism 
is 
possible 
anyhow. 
It 
is 
evident 
also 
that 
all 
the 
syllogisms 
in 
this 
figure 
are 
perfect 
(for 
they 
are 
all 
completed 
by 
means 
of 
the 
premisses 
originally 
taken) 
and 
that 
all 
conclusions 
are 
proved 
by 
this 
figure, 
viz. 
universal 
and 
particular, 
affirmative 
and 
negative. 
Such 
a 
figure 
I 
call 
the 
first. 


Whenever 
the 
same 
thing 
belongs 
to 
all 
of 
one 
subject, 
and 
to 
none 
of 
another, 
or 
to 
all 
of 
each 
subject 
or 
to 
none 
of 
either, 
I 
call 
such 
a 
figure 
the 
second; 
by 
middle 
term 
in 
it 
I 
mean 
that 
which 
is 
predicated 
of 
both 
subjects, 
by 
extremes 
the 
terms 
of 
which 
this 
is 
said, 
by 
major 
extreme 
that 
which 
lies 
near 
the 
middle, 
by 
minor 
that 
which 
is 
further 
away 
from 
the 
middle. 
The 
middle 
term 
stands 
outside 
the 
extremes, 
and 
is 
first 
in 
position. 
A 
syllogism 
cannot 
be 
perfect 
anyhow 
in 
this 
figure, 
but 
it 
may 
be 
valid 
whether 
the 
terms 
are 
related 
universally 
or 
not. 


If 
then 
the 
terms 
are 
related 
universally 
a 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible, 
whenever 
the 
middle 
belongs 
to 
all 
of 
one 
subject 
and 
to 
none 
of 
another 
(it 
does 
not 
matter 
which 
has 
the 
negative 
relation), 
but 
in 
no 
other 
way. 
Let 
M 
be 
predicated 
of 
no 
N, 
but 
of 
all 
O. 
Since, 
then, 
the 
negative 
relation 
is 



convertible, 
N 
will 
belong 
to 
no 
M: 
but 
M 
was 
assumed 
to 
belong 
to 
all 
O: 
consequently 
N 
will 
belong 
to 
no 
O. 
This 
has 
already 
been 
proved. 
Again 
if 
M 
belongs 
to 
all 
N, 
but 
to 
no 
O, 
then 
N 
will 
belong 
to 
no 
O. 
For 
if 
M 
belongs 
to 
no 
O, 
O 
belongs 
to 
no 
M: 
but 
M 
(as 
was 
said) 
belongs 
to 
all 
N: 
O 
then 
will 
belong 
to 
no 
N: 
for 
the 
first 
figure 
has 
again 
been 
formed. 
But 
since 
the 
negative 
relation 
is 
convertible, 
N 
will 
belong 
to 
no 
O. 
Thus 
it 
will 
be 
the 
same 
syllogism 
that 
proves 
both 
conclusions. 


It 
is 
possible 
to 
prove 
these 
results 
also 
by 
reductio 
ad 
impossibile. 


It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
a 
syllogism 
is 
formed 
when 
the 
terms 
are 
so 
related, 
but 
not 
a 
perfect 
syllogism; 
for 
necessity 
is 
not 
perfectly 
established 
merely 
from 
the 
original 
premisses; 
others 
also 
are 
needed. 


But 
if 
M 
is 
predicated 
of 
every 
N 
and 
O, 
there 
cannot 
be 
a 
syllogism. 
Terms 
to 
illustrate 
a 
positive 
relation 
between 
the 
extremes 
are 
substance, 
animal, 
man; 
a 
negative 
relation, 
substance, 
animal, 
number-substance 
being 
the 
middle 
term. 


Nor 
is 
a 
syllogism 
possible 
when 
M 
is 
predicated 
neither 
of 
any 
N 
nor 
of 
any 
O. 
Terms 
to 
illustrate 
a 
positive 
relation 
are 
line, 
animal, 
man: 
a 
negative 
relation, 
line, 
animal, 
stone. 


It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
if 
a 
syllogism 
is 
formed 
when 
the 
terms 
are 
universally 
related, 
the 
terms 
must 
be 
related 
as 
we 
stated 
at 
the 
outset: 
for 
if 
they 
are 
otherwise 
related 
no 
necessary 
consequence 
follows. 


If 
the 
middle 
term 
is 
related 
universally 
to 
one 
of 
the 
extremes, 
a 
particular 
negative 
syllogism 
must 
result 
whenever 
the 
middle 
term 
is 
related 
universally 
to 
the 
major 
whether 
positively 
or 
negatively, 
and 
particularly 
to 
the 
minor 
and 
in 
a 
manner 
opposite 
to 
that 
of 
the 
universal 
statement: 
by 
‘an 
opposite 
manner’ 
I 
mean, 
if 
the 
universal 
statement 
is 
negative, 
the 
particular 
is 
affirmative: 
if 
the 
universal 
is 
affirmative, 
the 
particular 
is 
negative. 
For 
if 
M 
belongs 
to 
no 
N, 
but 
to 
some 
O, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
N 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
O. 
For 
since 
the 
negative 
statement 
is 
convertible, 
N 
will 
belong 
to 
no 


M: 
but 
M 
was 
admitted 
to 
belong 
to 
some 
O: 
therefore 
N 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
O: 
for 
the 
result 
is 
reached 
by 
means 
of 
the 
first 
figure. 
Again 
if 
M 
belongs 
to 
all 
N, 
but 
not 
to 
some 
O, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
N 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
O: 
for 
if 
N 
belongs 
to 
all 
O, 
and 
M 
is 
predicated 
also 
of 
all 
N, 
M 
must 
belong 
to 
all 
O: 
but 
we 
assumed 
that 
M 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
O. 
And 
if 
M 
belongs 
to 
all 
N 
but 
not 
to 
all 
O, 
we 
shall 
conclude 
that 
N 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
all 
O: 
the 
proof 
is 
the 
same 
as 
the 
above. 
But 
if 
M 
is 
predicated 
of 
all 
O, 
but 
not 
of 
all 
N, 
there 
will 
be 
no 
syllogism. 
Take 
the 
terms 
animal, 
substance, 

raven; 
animal, 
white, 
raven. 
Nor 
will 
there 
be 
a 
conclusion 
when 
M 
is 
predicated 
of 
no 
O, 
but 
of 
some 
N. 
Terms 
to 
illustrate 
a 
positive 
relation 
between 
the 
extremes 
are 
animal, 
substance, 
unit: 
a 
negative 
relation, 
animal, 
substance, 
science. 


If 
then 
the 
universal 
statement 
is 
opposed 
to 
the 
particular, 
we 
have 
stated 
when 
a 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible 
and 
when 
not: 
but 
if 
the 
premisses 
are 
similar 
in 
form, 
I 
mean 
both 
negative 
or 
both 
affirmative, 
a 
syllogism 
will 
not 
be 
possible 
anyhow. 
First 
let 
them 
be 
negative, 
and 
let 
the 
major 
premiss 
be 
universal, 
e.g. 
let 
M 
belong 
to 
no 
N, 
and 
not 
to 
some 
O. 
It 
is 
possible 
then 
for 
N 
to 
belong 
either 
to 
all 
O 
or 
to 
no 
O. 
Terms 
to 
illustrate 
the 
negative 
relation 
are 
black, 
snow, 
animal. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
find 
terms 
of 
which 
the 
extremes 
are 
related 
positively 
and 
universally, 
if 
M 
belongs 
to 
some 
O, 
and 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
O. 
For 
if 
N 
belonged 
to 
all 
O, 
but 
M 
to 
no 
N, 
then 
M 
would 
belong 
to 
no 
O: 
but 
we 
assumed 
that 
it 
belongs 
to 
some 
O. 
In 
this 
way 
then 
it 
is 
not 
admissible 
to 
take 
terms: 
our 
point 
must 
be 
proved 
from 
the 
indefinite 
nature 
of 
the 
particular 
statement. 
For 
since 
it 
is 
true 
that 
M 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
O, 
even 
if 
it 
belongs 
to 
no 
O, 
and 
since 
if 
it 
belongs 
to 
no 
O 
a 
syllogism 
is 
(as 
we 
have 
seen) 
not 
possible, 
clearly 
it 
will 
not 
be 
possible 
now 
either. 


Again 
let 
the 
premisses 
be 
affirmative, 
and 
let 
the 
major 
premiss 
as 
before 
be 
universal, 
e.g. 
let 
M 
belong 
to 
all 
N 
and 
to 
some 
O. 
It 
is 
possible 
then 
for 
N 
to 
belong 
to 
all 
O 
or 
to 
no 
O. 
Terms 
to 
illustrate 
the 
negative 
relation 
are 
white, 
swan, 
stone. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
take 
terms 
to 
illustrate 
the 
universal 
affirmative 
relation, 
for 
the 
reason 
already 
stated: 
the 
point 
must 
be 
proved 
from 
the 
indefinite 
nature 
of 
the 
particular 
statement. 
But 
if 
the 
minor 
premiss 
is 
universal, 
and 
M 
belongs 
to 
no 
O, 
and 
not 
to 
some 
N, 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
N 
to 
belong 
either 
to 
all 
O 
or 
to 
no 
O. 
Terms 
for 
the 
positive 
relation 
are 
white, 
animal, 
raven: 
for 
the 
negative 
relation, 
white, 
stone, 
raven. 
If 
the 
premisses 
are 
affirmative, 
terms 
for 
the 
negative 
relation 
are 
white, 
animal, 
snow; 
for 
the 
positive 
relation, 
white, 
animal, 
swan. 
Evidently 
then, 
whenever 
the 
premisses 
are 
similar 
in 
form, 
and 
one 
is 
universal, 
the 
other 
particular, 
a 
syllogism 
can, 
not 
be 
formed 
anyhow. 
Nor 
is 
one 
possible 
if 
the 
middle 
term 
belongs 
to 
some 
of 
each 
of 
the 
extremes, 
or 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
either, 
or 
belongs 
to 
some 
of 
the 
one, 
not 
to 
some 
of 
the 
other, 
or 
belongs 
to 
neither 
universally, 
or 
is 
related 
to 
them 
indefinitely. 
Common 
terms 
for 
all 
the 
above 
are 
white, 
animal, 
man: 
white, 
animal, 
inanimate. 
It 
is 
clear 
then 
from 
what 
has 
been 
said 
that 
if 
the 
terms 
are 
related 
to 
one 
another 



in 
the 
way 
stated, 
a 
syllogism 
results 
of 
necessity; 
and 
if 
there 
is 
a 
syllogism, 
the 
terms 
must 
be 
so 
related. 
But 
it 
is 
evident 
also 
that 
all 
the 
syllogisms 
in 
this 
figure 
are 
imperfect: 
for 
all 
are 
made 
perfect 
by 
certain 
supplementary 
statements, 
which 
either 
are 
contained 
in 
the 
terms 
of 
necessity 
or 
are 
assumed 
as 
hypotheses, 
i.e. 
when 
we 
prove 
per 
impossibile. 
And 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
an 
affirmative 
conclusion 
is 
not 
attained 
by 
means 
of 
this 
figure, 
but 
all 
are 
negative, 
whether 
universal 
or 
particular. 


But 
if 
one 
term 
belongs 
to 
all, 
and 
another 
to 
none, 
of 
a 
third, 
or 
if 
both 
belong 
to 
all, 
or 
to 
none, 
of 
it, 
I 
call 
such 
a 
figure 
the 
third; 
by 
middle 
term 
in 
it 
I 
mean 
that 
of 
which 
both 
the 
predicates 
are 
predicated, 
by 
extremes 
I 
mean 
the 
predicates, 
by 
the 
major 
extreme 
that 
which 
is 
further 
from 
the 
middle, 
by 
the 
minor 
that 
which 
is 
nearer 
to 
it. 
The 
middle 
term 
stands 
outside 
the 
extremes, 
and 
is 
last 
in 
position. 
A 
syllogism 
cannot 
be 
perfect 
in 
this 
figure 
either, 
but 
it 
may 
be 
valid 
whether 
the 
terms 
are 
related 
universally 
or 
not 
to 
the 
middle 
term. 


If 
they 
are 
universal, 
whenever 
both 
P 
and 
R 
belong 
to 
S, 
it 
follows 
that 
P 
will 
necessarily 
belong 
to 
some 
R. 
For, 
since 
the 
affirmative 
statement 
is 
convertible, 
S 
will 
belong 
to 
some 
R: 
consequently 
since 
P 
belongs 
to 
all 
S, 
and 
S 
to 
some 
R, 
P 
must 
belong 
to 
some 
R: 
for 
a 
syllogism 
in 
the 
first 
figure 
is 
produced. 
It 
is 
possible 
to 
demonstrate 
this 
also 
per 
impossibile 
and 
by 
exposition. 
For 
if 
both 
P 
and 
R 
belong 
to 
all 
S, 
should 
one 
of 
the 
Ss, 
e.g. 
N, 
be 
taken, 
both 
P 
and 
R 
will 
belong 
to 
this, 
and 
thus 
P 
will 
belong 
to 
some 
R. 


If 
R 
belongs 
to 
all 
S, 
and 
P 
to 
no 
S, 
there 
will 
be 
a 
syllogism 
to 
prove 
that 
P 
will 
necessarily 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
R. 
This 
may 
be 
demonstrated 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
before 
by 
converting 
the 
premiss 
RS. 
It 
might 
be 
proved 
also 
per 
impossibile, 
as 
in 
the 
former 
cases. 
But 
if 
R 
belongs 
to 
no 
S, 
P 
to 
all 
S, 
there 
will 
be 
no 
syllogism. 
Terms 
for 
the 
positive 
relation 
are 
animal, 
horse, 
man: 
for 
the 
negative 
relation 
animal, 
inanimate, 
man. 


Nor 
can 
there 
be 
a 
syllogism 
when 
both 
terms 
are 
asserted 
of 
no 
S. 
Terms 
for 
the 
positive 
relation 
are 
animal, 
horse, 
inanimate; 
for 
the 
negative 
relation 
man, 
horse, 
inanimate-inanimate 
being 
the 
middle 
term. 


It 
is 
clear 
then 
in 
this 
figure 
also 
when 
a 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible 
and 
when 
not, 
if 
the 
terms 
are 
related 
universally. 
For 
whenever 
both 
the 
terms 
are 
affirmative, 
there 
will 
be 
a 
syllogism 
to 
prove 
that 
one 
extreme 
belongs 
to 



some 
of 
the 
other; 
but 
when 
they 
are 
negative, 
no 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible. 
But 
when 
one 
is 
negative, 
the 
other 
affirmative, 
if 
the 
major 
is 
negative, 
the 
minor 
affirmative, 
there 
will 
be 
a 
syllogism 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
one 
extreme 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
the 
other: 
but 
if 
the 
relation 
is 
reversed, 
no 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible. 
If 
one 
term 
is 
related 
universally 
to 
the 
middle, 
the 
other 
in 
part 
only, 
when 
both 
are 
affirmative 
there 
must 
be 
a 
syllogism, 
no 
matter 
which 
of 
the 
premisses 
is 
universal. 
For 
if 
R 
belongs 
to 
all 
S, 
P 
to 
some 
S, 
P 
must 
belong 
to 
some 
R. 
For 
since 
the 
affirmative 
statement 
is 
convertible 
S 
will 
belong 
to 
some 
P: 
consequently 
since 
R 
belongs 
to 
all 
S, 
and 
S 
to 
some 
P, 
R 
must 
also 
belong 
to 
some 
P: 
therefore 
P 
must 
belong 
to 
some 
R. 


Again 
if 
R 
belongs 
to 
some 
S, 
and 
P 
to 
all 
S, 
P 
must 
belong 
to 
some 
R. 
This 
may 
be 
demonstrated 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
the 
preceding. 
And 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
demonstrate 
it 
also 
per 
impossibile 
and 
by 
exposition, 
as 
in 
the 
former 
cases. 
But 
if 
one 
term 
is 
affirmative, 
the 
other 
negative, 
and 
if 
the 
affirmative 
is 
universal, 
a 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible 
whenever 
the 
minor 
term 
is 
affirmative. 
For 
if 
R 
belongs 
to 
all 
S, 
but 
P 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
S, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
P 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
R. 
For 
if 
P 
belongs 
to 
all 
R, 
and 
R 
belongs 
to 
all 
S, 
then 
P 
will 
belong 
to 
all 
S: 
but 
we 
assumed 
that 
it 
did 
not. 
Proof 
is 
possible 
also 
without 
reduction 
ad 
impossibile, 
if 
one 
of 
the 
Ss 
be 
taken 
to 
which 
P 
does 
not 
belong. 


But 
whenever 
the 
major 
is 
affirmative, 
no 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible, 
e.g. 
if 
P 
belongs 
to 
all 
S 
and 
R 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
S. 
Terms 
for 
the 
universal 
affirmative 
relation 
are 
animate, 
man, 
animal. 
For 
the 
universal 
negative 
relation 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
get 
terms, 
if 
R 
belongs 
to 
some 
S, 
and 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
S. 
For 
if 
P 
belongs 
to 
all 
S, 
and 
R 
to 
some 
S, 
then 
P 
will 
belong 
to 
some 
R: 
but 
we 
assumed 
that 
it 
belongs 
to 
no 
R. 
We 
must 
put 
the 
matter 
as 
before.’ 
Since 
the 
expression 
‘it 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some’ 
is 
indefinite, 
it 
may 
be 
used 
truly 
of 
that 
also 
which 
belongs 
to 
none. 
But 
if 
R 
belongs 
to 
no 
S, 
no 
syllogism 
is 
possible, 
as 
has 
been 
shown. 
Clearly 
then 
no 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible 
here. 


But 
if 
the 
negative 
term 
is 
universal, 
whenever 
the 
major 
is 
negative 
and 
the 
minor 
affirmative 
there 
will 
be 
a 
syllogism. 
For 
if 
P 
belongs 
to 
no 
S, 
and 
R 
belongs 
to 
some 
S, 
P 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
R: 
for 
we 
shall 
have 
the 
first 
figure 
again, 
if 
the 
premiss 
RS 
is 
converted. 


But 
when 
the 
minor 
is 
negative, 
there 
will 
be 
no 
syllogism. 
Terms 
for 
the 
positive 
relation 
are 
animal, 
man, 
wild: 
for 
the 
negative 
relation, 
animal, 



science, 
wild-the 
middle 
in 
both 
being 
the 
term 
wild. 


Nor 
is 
a 
syllogism 
possible 
when 
both 
are 
stated 
in 
the 
negative, 
but 
one 
is 
universal, 
the 
other 
particular. 
When 
the 
minor 
is 
related 
universally 
to 
the 
middle, 
take 
the 
terms 
animal, 
science, 
wild; 
animal, 
man, 
wild. 
When 
the 
major 
is 
related 
universally 
to 
the 
middle, 
take 
as 
terms 
for 
a 
negative 
relation 
raven, 
snow, 
white. 
For 
a 
positive 
relation 
terms 
cannot 
be 
found, 
if 
R 
belongs 
to 
some 
S, 
and 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
S. 
For 
if 
P 
belongs 
to 
all 
R, 
and 
R 
to 
some 
S, 
then 
P 
belongs 
to 
some 
S: 
but 
we 
assumed 
that 
it 
belongs 
to 
no 
S. 
Our 
point, 
then, 
must 
be 
proved 
from 
the 
indefinite 
nature 
of 
the 
particular 
statement. 


Nor 
is 
a 
syllogism 
possible 
anyhow, 
if 
each 
of 
the 
extremes 
belongs 
to 
some 
of 
the 
middle 
or 
does 
not 
belong, 
or 
one 
belongs 
and 
the 
other 
does 
not 
to 
some 
of 
the 
middle, 
or 
one 
belongs 
to 
some 
of 
the 
middle, 
the 
other 
not 
to 
all, 
or 
if 
the 
premisses 
are 
indefinite. 
Common 
terms 
for 
all 
are 
animal, 
man, 
white: 
animal, 
inanimate, 
white. 


It 
is 
clear 
then 
in 
this 
figure 
also 
when 
a 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible, 
and 
when 
not; 
and 
that 
if 
the 
terms 
are 
as 
stated, 
a 
syllogism 
results 
of 
necessity, 
and 
if 
there 
is 
a 
syllogism, 
the 
terms 
must 
be 
so 
related. 
It 
is 
clear 
also 
that 
all 
the 
syllogisms 
in 
this 
figure 
are 
imperfect 
(for 
all 
are 
made 
perfect 
by 
certain 
supplementary 
assumptions), 
and 
that 
it 
will 
not 
be 
possible 
to 
reach 
a 
universal 
conclusion 
by 
means 
of 
this 
figure, 
whether 
negative 
or 
affirmative. 


It 
is 
evident 
also 
that 
in 
all 
the 
figures, 
whenever 
a 
proper 
syllogism 
does 
not 
result, 
if 
both 
the 
terms 
are 
affirmative 
or 
negative 
nothing 
necessary 
follows 
at 
all, 
but 
if 
one 
is 
affirmative, 
the 
other 
negative, 
and 
if 
the 
negative 
is 
stated 
universally, 
a 
syllogism 
always 
results 
relating 
the 
minor 
to 
the 
major 
term, 
e.g. 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
or 
some 
B, 
and 
B 
belongs 
to 
no 
C: 
for 
if 
the 
premisses 
are 
converted 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
C 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
A. 
Similarly 
also 
in 
the 
other 
figures: 
a 
syllogism 
always 
results 
by 
means 
of 
conversion. 
It 
is 
evident 
also 
that 
the 
substitution 
of 
an 
indefinite 
for 
a 
particular 
affirmative 
will 
effect 
the 
same 
syllogism 
in 
all 
the 
figures. 


It 
is 
clear 
too 
that 
all 
the 
imperfect 
syllogisms 
are 
made 
perfect 
by 
means 
of 
the 
first 
figure. 
For 
all 
are 
brought 
to 
a 
conclusion 
either 
ostensively 
or 
per 
impossibile. 
In 
both 
ways 
the 
first 
figure 
is 
formed: 
if 
they 
are 
made 
perfect 
ostensively, 
because 
(as 
we 
saw) 
all 
are 
brought 
to 
a 
conclusion 
by 
means 
of 



conversion, 
and 
conversion 
produces 
the 
first 
figure: 
if 
they 
are 
proved 
per 
impossibile, 
because 
on 
the 
assumption 
of 
the 
false 
statement 
the 
syllogism 
comes 
about 
by 
means 
of 
the 
first 
figure, 
e.g. 
in 
the 
last 
figure, 
if 
A 
and 
B 
belong 
to 
all 
C, 
it 
follows 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B: 
for 
if 
A 
belonged 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
A 
would 
belong 
to 
no 
C: 
but 
(as 
we 
stated) 
it 
belongs 
to 
all 
C. 
Similarly 
also 
with 
the 
rest. 


It 
is 
possible 
also 
to 
reduce 
all 
syllogisms 
to 
the 
universal 
syllogisms 
in 
the 
first 
figure. 
Those 
in 
the 
second 
figure 
are 
clearly 
made 
perfect 
by 
these, 
though 
not 
all 
in 
the 
same 
way; 
the 
universal 
syllogisms 
are 
made 
perfect 
by 
converting 
the 
negative 
premiss, 
each 
of 
the 
particular 
syllogisms 
by 
reductio 
ad 
impossibile. 
In 
the 
first 
figure 
particular 
syllogisms 
are 
indeed 
made 
perfect 
by 
themselves, 
but 
it 
is 
possible 
also 
to 
prove 
them 
by 
means 
of 
the 
second 
figure, 
reducing 
them 
ad 
impossibile, 
e.g. 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
some 
C, 
it 
follows 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
C. 
For 
if 
it 
belonged 
to 
no 
C, 
and 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
then 
B 
will 
belong 
to 
no 
C: 
this 
we 
know 
by 
means 
of 
the 
second 
figure. 
Similarly 
also 
demonstration 
will 
be 
possible 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
negative. 
For 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
B 
belongs 
to 
some 
C, 
A 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C: 
for 
if 
it 
belonged 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
then 
B 
will 
belong 
to 
no 
C: 
and 
this 
(as 
we 
saw) 
is 
the 
middle 
figure. 
Consequently, 
since 
all 
syllogisms 
in 
the 
middle 
figure 
can 
be 
reduced 
to 
universal 
syllogisms 
in 
the 
first 
figure, 
and 
since 
particular 
syllogisms 
in 
the 
first 
figure 
can 
be 
reduced 
to 
syllogisms 
in 
the 
middle 
figure, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
particular 
syllogisms 
can 
be 
reduced 
to 
universal 
syllogisms 
in 
the 
first 
figure. 
Syllogisms 
in 
the 
third 
figure, 
if 
the 
terms 
are 
universal, 
are 
directly 
made 
perfect 
by 
means 
of 
those 
syllogisms; 
but, 
when 
one 
of 
the 
premisses 
is 
particular, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
particular 
syllogisms 
in 
the 
first 
figure: 
and 
these 
(we 
have 
seen) 
may 
be 
reduced 
to 
the 
universal 
syllogisms 
in 
the 
first 
figure: 
consequently 
also 
the 
particular 
syllogisms 
in 
the 
third 
figure 
may 
be 
so 
reduced. 
It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
all 
syllogisms 
may 
be 
reduced 
to 
the 
universal 
syllogisms 
in 
the 
first 
figure. 


We 
have 
stated 
then 
how 
syllogisms 
which 
prove 
that 
something 
belongs 
or 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
something 
else 
are 
constituted, 
both 
how 
syllogisms 
of 
the 
same 
figure 
are 
constituted 
in 
themselves, 
and 
how 
syllogisms 
of 
different 
figures 
are 
related 
to 
one 
another. 



Since 
there 
is 
a 
difference 
according 
as 
something 
belongs, 
necessarily 
belongs, 
or 
may 
belong 
to 
something 
else 
(for 
many 
things 
belong 
indeed, 
but 
not 
necessarily, 
others 
neither 
necessarily 
nor 
indeed 
at 
all, 
but 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
them 
to 
belong), 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
there 
will 
be 
different 
syllogisms 
to 
prove 
each 
of 
these 
relations, 
and 
syllogisms 
with 
differently 
related 
terms, 
one 
syllogism 
concluding 
from 
what 
is 
necessary, 
another 
from 
what 
is, 
a 
third 
from 
what 
is 
possible. 


There 
is 
hardly 
any 
difference 
between 
syllogisms 
from 
necessary 
premisses 
and 
syllogisms 
from 
premisses 
which 
merely 
assert. 
When 
the 
terms 
are 
put 
in 
the 
same 
way, 
then, 
whether 
something 
belongs 
or 
necessarily 
belongs 
(or 
does 
not 
belong) 
to 
something 
else, 
a 
syllogism 
will 
or 
will 
not 
result 
alike 
in 
both 
cases, 
the 
only 
difference 
being 
the 
addition 
of 
the 
expression 
‘necessarily’ 
to 
the 
terms. 
For 
the 
negative 
statement 
is 
convertible 
alike 
in 
both 
cases, 
and 
we 
should 
give 
the 
same 
account 
of 
the 
expressions 
‘to 
be 
contained 
in 
something 
as 
in 
a 
whole’ 
and 
‘to 
be 
predicated 
of 
all 
of 
something’. 
With 
the 
exceptions 
to 
be 
made 
below, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
proved 
to 
be 
necessary 
by 
means 
of 
conversion, 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
simple 
predication. 
But 
in 
the 
middle 
figure 
when 
the 
universal 
statement 
is 
affirmative, 
and 
the 
particular 
negative, 
and 
again 
in 
the 
third 
figure 
when 
the 
universal 
is 
affirmative 
and 
the 
particular 
negative, 
the 
demonstration 
will 
not 
take 
the 
same 
form, 
but 
it 
is 
necessary 
by 
the 
‘exposition’ 
of 
a 
part 
of 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
particular 
negative 
proposition, 
to 
which 
the 
predicate 
does 
not 
belong, 
to 
make 
the 
syllogism 
in 
reference 
to 
this: 
with 
terms 
so 
chosen 
the 
conclusion 
will 
necessarily 
follow. 
But 
if 
the 
relation 
is 
necessary 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
part 
taken, 
it 
must 
hold 
of 
some 
of 
that 
term 
in 
which 
this 
part 
is 
included: 
for 
the 
part 
taken 
is 
just 
some 
of 
that. 
And 
each 
of 
the 
resulting 
syllogisms 
is 
in 
the 
appropriate 
figure. 


It 
happens 
sometimes 
also 
that 
when 
one 
premiss 
is 
necessary 
the 
conclusion 
is 
necessary, 
not 
however 
when 
either 
premiss 
is 
necessary, 
but 
only 
when 
the 
major 
is, 
e.g. 
if 
A 
is 
taken 
as 
necessarily 
belonging 
or 
not 
belonging 
to 
B, 
but 
B 
is 
taken 
as 
simply 
belonging 
to 
C: 
for 
if 
the 
premisses 
are 
taken 
in 
this 
way, 
A 
will 
necessarily 
belong 
or 
not 
belong 
to 
C. 
For 
since 
necessarily 
belongs, 
or 
does 
not 
belong, 
to 
every 
B, 
and 
since 
C 
is 
one 
of 
the 
Bs, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
for 
C 
also 
the 
positive 
or 
the 
negative 
relation 
to 
A 
will 



hold 
necessarily. 
But 
if 
the 
major 
premiss 
is 
not 
necessary, 
but 
the 
minor 
is 
necessary, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
not 
be 
necessary. 
For 
if 
it 
were, 
it 
would 
result 
both 
through 
the 
first 
figure 
and 
through 
the 
third 
that 
A 
belongs 
necessarily 
to 
some 
B. 
But 
this 
is 
false; 
for 
B 
may 
be 
such 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
none 
of 
it. 
Further, 
an 
example 
also 
makes 
it 
clear 
that 
the 
conclusion 
not 
be 
necessary, 
e.g. 
if 
A 
were 
movement, 
B 
animal, 
C 
man: 
man 
is 
an 
animal 
necessarily, 
but 
an 
animal 
does 
not 
move 
necessarily, 
nor 
does 
man. 
Similarly 
also 
if 
the 
major 
premiss 
is 
negative; 
for 
the 
proof 
is 
the 
same. 


In 
particular 
syllogisms, 
if 
the 
universal 
premiss 
is 
necessary, 
then 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
necessary; 
but 
if 
the 
particular, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
not 
be 
necessary, 
whether 
the 
universal 
premiss 
is 
negative 
or 
affirmative. 
First 
let 
the 
universal 
be 
necessary, 
and 
let 
A 
belong 
to 
all 
B 
necessarily, 
but 
let 
B 
simply 
belong 
to 
some 
C: 
it 
is 
necessary 
then 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
C 
necessarily: 
for 
C 
falls 
under 
B, 
and 
A 
was 
assumed 
to 
belong 
necessarily 
to 
all 
B. 
Similarly 
also 
if 
the 
syllogism 
should 
be 
negative: 
for 
the 
proof 
will 
be 
the 
same. 
But 
if 
the 
particular 
premiss 
is 
necessary, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
not 
be 
necessary: 
for 
from 
the 
denial 
of 
such 
a 
conclusion 
nothing 
impossible 
results, 
just 
as 
it 
does 
not 
in 
the 
universal 
syllogisms. 
The 
same 
is 
true 
of 
negative 
syllogisms. 
Try 
the 
terms 
movement, 
animal, 
white. 


In 
the 
second 
figure, 
if 
the 
negative 
premiss 
is 
necessary, 
then 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
necessary, 
but 
if 
the 
affirmative, 
not 
necessary. 
First 
let 
the 
negative 
be 
necessary; 
let 
A 
be 
possible 
of 
no 
B, 
and 
simply 
belong 
to 
C. 
Since 
then 
the 
negative 
statement 
is 
convertible, 
B 
is 
possible 
of 
no 
A. 
But 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
C; 
consequently 
B 
is 
possible 
of 
no 
C. 
For 
C 
falls 
under 
A. 
The 
same 
result 
would 
be 
obtained 
if 
the 
minor 
premiss 
were 
negative: 
for 
if 
A 
is 
possible 
be 
of 
no 
C, 
C 
is 
possible 
of 
no 
A: 
but 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
consequently 
C 
is 
possible 
of 
none 
of 
the 
Bs: 
for 
again 
we 
have 
obtained 
the 
first 
figure. 
Neither 
then 
is 
B 
possible 
of 
C: 
for 
conversion 
is 
possible 
without 
modifying 
the 
relation. 


But 
if 
the 
affirmative 
premiss 
is 
necessary, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
not 
be 
necessary. 
Let 
A 
belong 
to 
all 
B 
necessarily, 
but 
to 
no 
C 
simply. 
If 
then 
the 
negative 
premiss 
is 
converted, 
the 
first 
figure 
results. 
But 
it 
has 
been 
proved 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
first 
figure 
that 
if 
the 
negative 
major 
premiss 
is 
not 
necessary 
the 
conclusion 
will 
not 
be 
necessary 
either. 
Therefore 
the 
same 



result 
will 
obtain 
here. 
Further, 
if 
the 
conclusion 
is 
necessary, 
it 
follows 
that 
C 
necessarily 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
A. 
For 
if 
B 
necessarily 
belongs 
to 
no 
C, 
C 
will 
necessarily 
belong 
to 
no 
B. 
But 
B 
at 
any 
rate 
must 
belong 
to 
some 
A, 
if 
it 
is 
true 
(as 
was 
assumed) 
that 
A 
necessarily 
belongs 
to 
all 
B. 
Consequently 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
C 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
A. 
But 
nothing 
prevents 
such 
an 
A 
being 
taken 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
C 
to 
belong 
to 
all 
of 
it. 
Further 
one 
might 
show 
by 
an 
exposition 
of 
terms 
that 
the 
conclusion 
is 
not 
necessary 
without 
qualification, 
though 
it 
is 
a 
necessary 
conclusion 
from 
the 
premisses. 
For 
example 
let 
A 
be 
animal, 
B 
man, 
C 
white, 
and 
let 
the 
premisses 
be 
assumed 
to 
correspond 
to 
what 
we 
had 
before: 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
animal 
should 
belong 
to 
nothing 
white. 
Man 
then 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
anything 
white, 
but 
not 
necessarily: 
for 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
man 
to 
be 
born 
white, 
not 
however 
so 
long 
as 
animal 
belongs 
to 
nothing 
white. 
Consequently 
under 
these 
conditions 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
necessary, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
without 
qualification. 


Similar 
results 
will 
obtain 
also 
in 
particular 
syllogisms. 
For 
whenever 
the 
negative 
premiss 
is 
both 
universal 
and 
necessary, 
then 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
necessary: 
but 
whenever 
the 
affirmative 
premiss 
is 
universal, 
the 
negative 
particular, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
not 
be 
necessary. 
First 
then 
let 
the 
negative 
premiss 
be 
both 
universal 
and 
necessary: 
let 
it 
be 
possible 
for 
no 
B 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
it, 
and 
let 
A 
simply 
belong 
to 
some 
C. 
Since 
the 
negative 
statement 
is 
convertible, 
it 
will 
be 
possible 
for 
no 
A 
that 
B 
should 
belong 
to 
it: 
but 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
C; 
consequently 
B 
necessarily 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
the 
Cs. 
Again 
let 
the 
affirmative 
premiss 
be 
both 
universal 
and 
necessary, 
and 
let 
the 
major 
premiss 
be 
affirmative. 
If 
then 
A 
necessarily 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
but 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
B 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C, 
but 
not 
necessarily. 
For 
the 
same 
terms 
can 
be 
used 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
point, 
which 
were 
used 
in 
the 
universal 
syllogisms. 
Nor 
again, 
if 
the 
negative 
statement 
is 
necessary 
but 
particular, 
will 
the 
conclusion 
be 
necessary. 
The 
point 
can 
be 
demonstrated 
by 
means 
of 
the 
same 
terms. 


In 
the 
last 
figure 
when 
the 
terms 
are 
related 
universally 
to 
the 
middle, 
and 
both 
premisses 
are 
affirmative, 
if 
one 
of 
the 
two 
is 
necessary, 
then 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
necessary. 
But 
if 
one 
is 
negative, 
the 
other 
affirmative, 



whenever 
the 
negative 
is 
necessary 
the 
conclusion 
also 
will 
be 
necessary, 
but 
whenever 
the 
affirmative 
is 
necessary 
the 
conclusion 
will 
not 
be 
necessary. 
First 
let 
both 
the 
premisses 
be 
affirmative, 
and 
let 
A 
and 
B 
belong 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
let 
AC 
be 
necessary. 
Since 
then 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
C 
also 
will 
belong 
to 
some 
B, 
because 
the 
universal 
is 
convertible 
into 
the 
particular: 
consequently 
if 
A 
belongs 
necessarily 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
C 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
some 
B 
also. 
For 
B 
is 
under 
C. 
The 
first 
figure 
then 
is 
formed. 
A 
similar 
proof 
will 
be 
given 
also 
if 
BC 
is 
necessary. 
For 
C 
is 
convertible 
with 
some 
A: 
consequently 
if 
B 
belongs 
necessarily 
to 
all 
C, 
it 
will 
belong 
necessarily 
also 
to 
some 
A. 


Again 
let 
AC 
be 
negative, 
BC 
affirmative, 
and 
let 
the 
negative 
premiss 
be 
necessary. 
Since 
then 
C 
is 
convertible 
with 
some 
B, 
but 
A 
necessarily 
belongs 
to 
no 
C, 
A 
will 
necessarily 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B 
either: 
for 
B 
is 
under 
C. 
But 
if 
the 
affirmative 
is 
necessary, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
not 
be 
necessary. 
For 
suppose 
BC 
is 
affirmative 
and 
necessary, 
while 
AC 
is 
negative 
and 
not 
necessary. 
Since 
then 
the 
affirmative 
is 
convertible, 
C 
also 
will 
belong 
to 
some 
B 
necessarily: 
consequently 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
none 
of 
the 
Cs, 
while 
C 
belongs 
to 
some 
of 
the 
Bs, 
A 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
the 
Bs-but 
not 
of 
necessity; 
for 
it 
has 
been 
proved, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
first 
figure, 
that 
if 
the 
negative 
premiss 
is 
not 
necessary, 
neither 
will 
the 
conclusion 
be 
necessary. 
Further, 
the 
point 
may 
be 
made 
clear 
by 
considering 
the 
terms. 
Let 
the 
term 
A 
be 
‘good’, 
let 
that 
which 
B 
signifies 
be 
‘animal’, 
let 
the 
term 
C 
be 
‘horse’. 
It 
is 
possible 
then 
that 
the 
term 
good 
should 
belong 
to 
no 
horse, 
and 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
the 
term 
animal 
should 
belong 
to 
every 
horse: 
but 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
some 
animal 
should 
not 
be 
good, 
since 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
every 
animal 
to 
be 
good. 
Or 
if 
that 
is 
not 
possible, 
take 
as 
the 
term 
‘awake’ 
or 
‘asleep’: 
for 
every 
animal 
can 
accept 
these. 


If, 
then, 
the 
premisses 
are 
universal, 
we 
have 
stated 
when 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
necessary. 
But 
if 
one 
premiss 
is 
universal, 
the 
other 
particular, 
and 
if 
both 
are 
affirmative, 
whenever 
the 
universal 
is 
necessary 
the 
conclusion 
also 
must 
be 
necessary. 
The 
demonstration 
is 
the 
same 
as 
before; 
for 
the 
particular 
affirmative 
also 
is 
convertible. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
B 
should 
belong 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
A 
falls 
under 
C, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
B 
should 
belong 
to 
some 
A. 
But 
if 
B 
must 
belong 
to 
some 
A, 
then 
A 
must 
belong 
to 
some 
B: 
for 
conversion 
is 
possible. 
Similarly 
also 
if 
AC 
should 
be 
necessary 
and 
universal: 
for 
B 
falls 
under 
C. 
But 
if 
the 
particular 
premiss 
is 
necessary, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
not 
be 
necessary. 
Let 
the 
premiss 
BC 
be 
both 
particular 
and 



necessary, 
and 
let 
A 
belong 
to 
all 
C, 
not 
however 
necessarily. 
If 
the 
proposition 
BC 
is 
converted 
the 
first 
figure 
is 
formed, 
and 
the 
universal 
premiss 
is 
not 
necessary, 
but 
the 
particular 
is 
necessary. 
But 
when 
the 
premisses 
were 
thus, 
the 
conclusion 
(as 
we 
proved 
was 
not 
necessary: 
consequently 
it 
is 
not 
here 
either. 
Further, 
the 
point 
is 
clear 
if 
we 
look 
at 
the 
terms. 
Let 
A 
be 
waking, 
B 
biped, 
and 
C 
animal. 
It 
is 
necessary 
that 
B 
should 
belong 
to 
some 
C, 
but 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
A 
to 
belong 
to 
C, 
and 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
B 
is 
not 
necessary. 
For 
there 
is 
no 
necessity 
that 
some 
biped 
should 
be 
asleep 
or 
awake. 
Similarly 
and 
by 
means 
of 
the 
same 
terms 
proof 
can 
be 
made, 
should 
the 
proposition 
AC 
be 
both 
particular 
and 
necessary. 


But 
if 
one 
premiss 
is 
affirmative, 
the 
other 
negative, 
whenever 
the 
universal 
is 
both 
negative 
and 
necessary 
the 
conclusion 
also 
will 
be 
necessary. 
For 
if 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
any 
C, 
but 
B 
belongs 
to 
some 
C, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
A 
should 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B. 
But 
whenever 
the 
affirmative 
proposition 
is 
necessary, 
whether 
universal 
or 
particular, 
or 
the 
negative 
is 
particular, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
not 
be 
necessary. 
The 
proof 
of 
this 
by 
reduction 
will 
be 
the 
same 
as 
before; 
but 
if 
terms 
are 
wanted, 
when 
the 
universal 
affirmative 
is 
necessary, 
take 
the 
terms 
‘waking’-’animal’-’man’, 
‘man’ 
being 
middle, 
and 
when 
the 
affirmative 
is 
particular 
and 
necessary, 
take 
the 
terms 
‘waking’-’animal’-’white’: 
for 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
animal 
should 
belong 
to 
some 
white 
thing, 
but 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
waking 
should 
belong 
to 
none, 
and 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
waking 
should 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
animal. 
But 
when 
the 
negative 
proposition 
being 
particular 
is 
necessary, 
take 
the 
terms 
‘biped’, 
‘moving’, 
‘animal’, 
‘animal’ 
being 
middle. 


It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
a 
simple 
conclusion 
is 
not 
reached 
unless 
both 
premisses 
are 
simple 
assertions, 
but 
a 
necessary 
conclusion 
is 
possible 
although 
one 
only 
of 
the 
premisses 
is 
necessary. 
But 
in 
both 
cases, 
whether 
the 
syllogisms 
are 
affirmative 
or 
negative, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
one 
premiss 
should 
be 
similar 
to 
the 
conclusion. 
I 
mean 
by 
‘similar’, 
if 
the 
conclusion 
is 
a 
simple 
assertion, 
the 
premiss 
must 
be 
simple; 
if 
the 
conclusion 
is 
necessary, 
the 
premiss 
must 
be 
necessary. 
Consequently 
this 
also 
is 
clear, 
that 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
neither 
necessary 
nor 
simple 
unless 
a 
necessary 
or 
simple 
premiss 
is 
assumed. 



Perhaps 
enough 
has 
been 
said 
about 
the 
proof 
of 
necessity, 
how 
it 
comes 
about 
and 
how 
it 
differs 
from 
the 
proof 
of 
a 
simple 
statement. 
We 
proceed 
to 
discuss 
that 
which 
is 
possible, 
when 
and 
how 
and 
by 
what 
means 
it 
can 
be 
proved. 
I 
use 
the 
terms 
‘to 
be 
possible’ 
and 
‘the 
possible’ 
of 
that 
which 
is 
not 
necessary 
but, 
being 
assumed, 
results 
in 
nothing 
impossible. 
We 
say 
indeed 
ambiguously 
of 
the 
necessary 
that 
it 
is 
possible. 
But 
that 
my 
definition 
of 
the 
possible 
is 
correct 
is 
clear 
from 
the 
phrases 
by 
which 
we 
deny 
or 
on 
the 
contrary 
affirm 
possibility. 
For 
the 
expressions 
‘it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
belong’, 
‘it 
is 
impossible 
to 
belong’, 
and 
‘it 
is 
necessary 
not 
to 
belong’ 
are 
either 
identical 
or 
follow 
from 
one 
another; 
consequently 
their 
opposites 
also, 
‘it 
is 
possible 
to 
belong’, 
‘it 
is 
not 
impossible 
to 
belong’, 
and 
‘it 
is 
not 
necessary 
not 
to 
belong’, 
will 
either 
be 
identical 
or 
follow 
from 
one 
another. 
For 
of 
everything 
the 
affirmation 
or 
the 
denial 
holds 
good. 
That 
which 
is 
possible 
then 
will 
be 
not 
necessary 
and 
that 
which 
is 
not 
necessary 
will 
be 
possible. 
It 
results 
that 
all 
premisses 
in 
the 
mode 
of 
possibility 
are 
convertible 
into 
one 
another. 
I 
mean 
not 
that 
the 
affirmative 
are 
convertible 
into 
the 
negative, 
but 
that 
those 
which 
are 
affirmative 
in 
form 
admit 
of 
conversion 
by 
opposition, 


e.g. 
‘it 
is 
possible 
to 
belong’ 
may 
be 
converted 
into 
‘it 
is 
possible 
not 
to 
belong’, 
and 
‘it 
is 
possible 
for 
A 
to 
belong 
to 
all 
B’ 
into 
‘it 
is 
possible 
for 
A 
to 
belong 
to 
no 
B’ 
or 
‘not 
to 
all 
B’, 
and 
‘it 
is 
possible 
for 
A 
to 
belong 
to 
some 
B’ 
into 
‘it 
is 
possible 
for 
A 
not 
to 
belong 
to 
some 
B’. 
And 
similarly 
the 
other 
propositions 
in 
this 
mode 
can 
be 
converted. 
For 
since 
that 
which 
is 
possible 
is 
not 
necessary, 
and 
that 
which 
is 
not 
necessary 
may 
possibly 
not 
belong, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
if 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
B, 
it 
is 
possible 
also 
that 
it 
should 
not 
belong 
to 
B: 
and 
if 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
it 
should 
belong 
to 
all, 
it 
is 
also 
possible 
that 
it 
should 
not 
belong 
to 
all. 
The 
same 
holds 
good 
in 
the 
case 
of 
particular 
affirmations: 
for 
the 
proof 
is 
identical. 
And 
such 
premisses 
are 
affirmative 
and 
not 
negative; 
for 
‘to 
be 
possible’ 
is 
in 
the 
same 
rank 
as 
‘to 
be’, 
as 
was 
said 
above. 
Having 
made 
these 
distinctions 
we 
next 
point 
out 
that 
the 
expression 
‘to 
be 
possible’ 
is 
used 
in 
two 
ways. 
In 
one 
it 
means 
to 
happen 
generally 
and 
fall 
short 
of 
necessity, 
e.g. 
man’s 
turning 
grey 
or 
growing 
or 
decaying, 
or 
generally 
what 
naturally 
belongs 
to 
a 
thing 
(for 
this 
has 
not 
its 
necessity 
unbroken, 
since 
man’s 
existence 
is 
not 
continuous 
for 
ever, 
although 
if 
a 
man 
does 
exist, 
it 
comes 
about 
either 
necessarily 
or 
generally). 
In 
another 
sense 



the 
expression 
means 
the 
indefinite, 
which 
can 
be 
both 
thus 
and 
not 
thus, 
e.g. 
an 
animal’s 
walking 
or 
an 
earthquake’s 
taking 
place 
while 
it 
is 
walking, 
or 
generally 
what 
happens 
by 
chance: 
for 
none 
of 
these 
inclines 
by 
nature 
in 
the 
one 
way 
more 
than 
in 
the 
opposite. 


That 
which 
is 
possible 
in 
each 
of 
its 
two 
senses 
is 
convertible 
into 
its 
opposite, 
not 
however 
in 
the 
same 
way: 
but 
what 
is 
natural 
is 
convertible 
because 
it 
does 
not 
necessarily 
belong 
(for 
in 
this 
sense 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
a 
man 
should 
not 
grow 
grey) 
and 
what 
is 
indefinite 
is 
convertible 
because 
it 
inclines 
this 
way 
no 
more 
than 
that. 
Science 
and 
demonstrative 
syllogism 
are 
not 
concerned 
with 
things 
which 
are 
indefinite, 
because 
the 
middle 
term 
is 
uncertain; 
but 
they 
are 
concerned 
with 
things 
that 
are 
natural, 
and 
as 
a 
rule 
arguments 
and 
inquiries 
are 
made 
about 
things 
which 
are 
possible 
in 
this 
sense. 
Syllogisms 
indeed 
can 
be 
made 
about 
the 
former, 
but 
it 
is 
unusual 
at 
any 
rate 
to 
inquire 
about 
them. 


These 
matters 
will 
be 
treated 
more 
definitely 
in 
the 
sequel; 
our 
business 
at 
present 
is 
to 
state 
the 
moods 
and 
nature 
of 
the 
syllogism 
made 
from 
possible 
premisses. 
The 
expression 
‘it 
is 
possible 
for 
this 
to 
belong 
to 
that’ 
may 
be 
understood 
in 
two 
senses: 
‘that’ 
may 
mean 
either 
that 
to 
which 
‘that’ 
belongs 
or 
that 
to 
which 
it 
may 
belong; 
for 
the 
expression 
‘A 
is 
possible 
of 
the 
subject 
of 
B’ 
means 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
either 
of 
that 
of 
which 
B 
is 
stated 
or 
of 
that 
of 
which 
B 
may 
possibly 
be 
stated. 
It 
makes 
no 
difference 
whether 
we 
say, 
A 
is 
possible 
of 
the 
subject 
of 
B, 
or 
all 
B 
admits 
of 
A. 
It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
the 
expression 
‘A 
may 
possibly 
belong 
to 
all 
B’ 
might 
be 
used 
in 
two 
senses. 
First 
then 
we 
must 
state 
the 
nature 
and 
characteristics 
of 
the 
syllogism 
which 
arises 
if 
B 
is 
possible 
of 
the 
subject 
of 
C, 
and 
A 
is 
possible 
of 
the 
subject 
of 


B. 
For 
thus 
both 
premisses 
are 
assumed 
in 
the 
mode 
of 
possibility; 
but 
whenever 
A 
is 
possible 
of 
that 
of 
which 
B 
is 
true, 
one 
premiss 
is 
a 
simple 
assertion, 
the 
other 
a 
problematic. 
Consequently 
we 
must 
start 
from 
premisses 
which 
are 
similar 
in 
form, 
as 
in 
the 
other 
cases. 
Whenever 
A 
may 
possibly 
belong 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
all 
C, 
there 
will 
be 
a 
perfect 
syllogism 
to 
prove 
that 
A 
may 
possibly 
belong 
to 
all 
C. 
This 
is 
clear 
from 
the 
definition: 
for 
it 
was 
in 
this 
way 
that 
we 
explained 
‘to 
be 
possible 
for 
one 
term 
to 
belong 
to 
all 
of 
another’. 
Similarly 
if 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
A 
to 
belong 
no 
B, 
and 
for 
B 
to 
belong 
to 
all 
C, 
then 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
A 
to 
belong 



to 
no 
C. 
For 
the 
statement 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
A 
not 
to 
belong 
to 
that 
of 
which 
B 
may 
be 
true 
means 
(as 
we 
saw) 
that 
none 
of 
those 
things 
which 
can 
possibly 
fall 
under 
the 
term 
B 
is 
left 
out 
of 
account. 
But 
whenever 
A 
may 
belong 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
B 
may 
belong 
to 
no 
C, 
then 
indeed 
no 
syllogism 
results 
from 
the 
premisses 
assumed, 
but 
if 
the 
premiss 
BC 
is 
converted 
after 
the 
manner 
of 
problematic 
propositions, 
the 
same 
syllogism 
results 
as 
before. 
For 
since 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
B 
should 
belong 
to 
no 
C, 
it 
is 
possible 
also 
that 
it 
should 
belong 
to 
all 
C. 
This 
has 
been 
stated 
above. 
Consequently 
if 
B 
is 
possible 
for 
all 
C, 
and 
A 
is 
possible 
for 
all 
B, 
the 
same 
syllogism 
again 
results. 
Similarly 
if 
in 
both 
the 
premisses 
the 
negative 
is 
joined 
with 
‘it 
is 
possible’: 
e.g. 
if 
A 
may 
belong 
to 
none 
of 
the 
Bs, 
and 
B 
to 
none 
of 
the 
Cs. 
No 
syllogism 
results 
from 
the 
assumed 
premisses, 
but 
if 
they 
are 
converted 
we 
shall 
have 
the 
same 
syllogism 
as 
before. 
It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
if 
the 
minor 
premiss 
is 
negative, 
or 
if 
both 
premisses 
are 
negative, 
either 
no 
syllogism 
results, 
or 
if 
one 
it 
is 
not 
perfect. 
For 
the 
necessity 
results 
from 
the 
conversion. 


But 
if 
one 
of 
the 
premisses 
is 
universal, 
the 
other 
particular, 
when 
the 
major 
premiss 
is 
universal 
there 
will 
be 
a 
perfect 
syllogism. 
For 
if 
A 
is 
possible 
for 
all 
B, 
and 
B 
for 
some 
C, 
then 
A 
is 
possible 
for 
some 
C. 
This 
is 
clear 
from 
the 
definition 
of 
being 
possible. 
Again 
if 
A 
may 
belong 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
B 
may 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
the 
Cs, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
A 
may 
possibly 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
the 
Cs. 
The 
proof 
is 
the 
same 
as 
above. 
But 
if 
the 
particular 
premiss 
is 
negative, 
and 
the 
universal 
is 
affirmative, 
the 
major 
still 
being 
universal 
and 
the 
minor 
particular, 
e.g. 
A 
is 
possible 
for 
all 
B, 
B 
may 
possibly 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C, 
then 
a 
clear 
syllogism 
does 
not 
result 
from 
the 
assumed 
premisses, 
but 
if 
the 
particular 
premiss 
is 
converted 
and 
it 
is 
laid 
down 
that 
B 
possibly 
may 
belong 
to 
some 
C, 
we 
shall 
have 
the 
same 
conclusion 
as 
before, 
as 
in 
the 
cases 
given 
at 
the 
beginning. 


But 
if 
the 
major 
premiss 
is 
the 
minor 
universal, 
whether 
both 
are 
affirmative, 
or 
negative, 
or 
different 
in 
quality, 
or 
if 
both 
are 
indefinite 
or 
particular, 
in 
no 
way 
will 
a 
syllogism 
be 
possible. 
For 
nothing 
prevents 
B 
from 
reaching 
beyond 
A, 
so 
that 
as 
predicates 
cover 
unequal 
areas. 
Let 
C 
be 
that 
by 
which 
B 
extends 
beyond 
A. 
To 
C 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
that 
A 
should 
belong-either 
to 
all 
or 
to 
none 
or 
to 
some 
or 
not 
to 
some, 
since 
premisses 
in 
the 
mode 
of 
possibility 
are 
convertible 
and 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
B 
to 
belong 
to 
more 
things 
than 
A 
can. 
Further, 
this 
is 
obvious 
if 
we 
take 
terms; 
for 
if 
the 
premisses 
are 
as 
assumed, 
the 
major 
term 
is 
both 
possible 
for 
none 
of 
the 



minor 
and 
must 
belong 
to 
all 
of 
it. 
Take 
as 
terms 
common 
to 
all 
the 
cases 
under 
consideration 
‘animal’-’white’-’man’, 
where 
the 
major 
belongs 
necessarily 
to 
the 
minor; 
‘animal’-’white’-’garment’, 
where 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
that 
the 
major 
should 
belong 
to 
the 
minor. 
It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
if 
the 
terms 
are 
related 
in 
this 
manner, 
no 
syllogism 
results. 
For 
every 
syllogism 
proves 
that 
something 
belongs 
either 
simply 
or 
necessarily 
or 
possibly. 
It 
is 
clear 
that 
there 
is 
no 
proof 
of 
the 
first 
or 
of 
the 
second. 
For 
the 
affirmative 
is 
destroyed 
by 
the 
negative, 
and 
the 
negative 
by 
the 
affirmative. 
There 
remains 
the 
proof 
of 
possibility. 
But 
this 
is 
impossible. 
For 
it 
has 
been 
proved 
that 
if 
the 
terms 
are 
related 
in 
this 
manner 
it 
is 
both 
necessary 
that 
the 
major 
should 
belong 
to 
all 
the 
minor 
and 
not 
possible 
that 
it 
should 
belong 
to 
any. 
Consequently 
there 
cannot 
be 
a 
syllogism 
to 
prove 
the 
possibility; 
for 
the 
necessary 
(as 
we 
stated) 
is 
not 
possible. 


It 
is 
clear 
that 
if 
the 
terms 
are 
universal 
in 
possible 
premisses 
a 
syllogism 
always 
results 
in 
the 
first 
figure, 
whether 
they 
are 
affirmative 
or 
negative, 
only 
a 
perfect 
syllogism 
results 
in 
the 
first 
case, 
an 
imperfect 
in 
the 
second. 
But 
possibility 
must 
be 
understood 
according 
to 
the 
definition 
laid 
down, 
not 
as 
covering 
necessity. 
This 
is 
sometimes 
forgotten. 


If 
one 
premiss 
is 
a 
simple 
proposition, 
the 
other 
a 
problematic, 
whenever 
the 
major 
premiss 
indicates 
possibility 
all 
the 
syllogisms 
will 
be 
perfect 
and 
establish 
possibility 
in 
the 
sense 
defined; 
but 
whenever 
the 
minor 
premiss 
indicates 
possibility 
all 
the 
syllogisms 
will 
be 
imperfect, 
and 
those 
which 
are 
negative 
will 
establish 
not 
possibility 
according 
to 
the 
definition, 
but 
that 
the 
major 
does 
not 
necessarily 
belong 
to 
any, 
or 
to 
all, 
of 
the 
minor. 
For 
if 
this 
is 
so, 
we 
say 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
it 
should 
belong 
to 
none 
or 
not 
to 
all. 
Let 
A 
be 
possible 
for 
all 
B, 
and 
let 
B 
belong 
to 
all 
C. 
Since 
C 
falls 
under 
B, 
and 
A 
is 
possible 
for 
all 
B, 
clearly 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
all 
C 
also. 
So 
a 
perfect 
syllogism 
results. 
Likewise 
if 
the 
premiss 
AB 
is 
negative, 
and 
the 
premiss 
BC 
is 
affirmative, 
the 
former 
stating 
possible, 
the 
latter 
simple 
attribution, 
a 
perfect 
syllogism 
results 
proving 
that 
A 
possibly 
belongs 
to 
no 
C. 


It 
is 
clear 
that 
perfect 
syllogisms 
result 
if 
the 
minor 
premiss 
states 
simple 
belonging: 
but 
that 
syllogisms 
will 
result 
if 
the 
modality 
of 
the 
premisses 
is 
reversed, 
must 
be 
proved 
per 
impossibile. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
it 
will 
be 
evident 
that 
they 
are 
imperfect: 
for 
the 
proof 
proceeds 
not 
from 
the 
premisses 



assumed. 
First 
we 
must 
state 
that 
if 
B’s 
being 
follows 
necessarily 
from 
A’s 
being, 
B’s 
possibility 
will 
follow 
necessarily 
from 
A’s 
possibility. 
Suppose, 
the 
terms 
being 
so 
related, 
that 
A 
is 
possible, 
and 
B 
is 
impossible. 
If 
then 
that 
which 
is 
possible, 
when 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
it 
to 
be, 
might 
happen, 
and 
if 
that 
which 
is 
impossible, 
when 
it 
is 
impossible, 
could 
not 
happen, 
and 
if 
at 
the 
same 
time 
A 
is 
possible 
and 
B 
impossible, 
it 
would 
be 
possible 
for 
A 
to 
happen 
without 
B, 
and 
if 
to 
happen, 
then 
to 
be. 
For 
that 
which 
has 
happened, 
when 
it 
has 
happened, 
is. 
But 
we 
must 
take 
the 
impossible 
and 
the 
possible 
not 
only 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
becoming, 
but 
also 
in 
the 
spheres 
of 
truth 
and 
predicability, 
and 
the 
various 
other 
spheres 
in 
which 
we 
speak 
of 
the 
possible: 
for 
it 
will 
be 
alike 
in 
all. 
Further 
we 
must 
understand 
the 
statement 
that 
B’s 
being 
depends 
on 
A’s 
being, 
not 
as 
meaning 
that 
if 
some 
single 
thing 
A 
is, 
B 
will 
be: 
for 
nothing 
follows 
of 
necessity 
from 
the 
being 
of 
some 
one 
thing, 
but 
from 
two 
at 
least, 
i.e. 
when 
the 
premisses 
are 
related 
in 
the 
manner 
stated 
to 
be 
that 
of 
the 
syllogism. 
For 
if 
C 
is 
predicated 
of 
D, 
and 
D 
of 
F, 
then 
C 
is 
necessarily 
predicated 
of 
F. 
And 
if 
each 
is 
possible, 
the 
conclusion 
also 
is 
possible. 
If 
then, 
for 
example, 
one 
should 
indicate 
the 
premisses 
by 
A, 
and 
the 
conclusion 
by 
B, 
it 
would 
not 
only 
result 
that 
if 
A 
is 
necessary 
B 
is 
necessary, 
but 
also 
that 
if 
A 
is 
possible, 
B 
is 
possible. 


Since 
this 
is 
proved 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
if 
a 
false 
and 
not 
impossible 
assumption 
is 
made, 
the 
consequence 
of 
the 
assumption 
will 
also 
be 
false 
and 
not 
impossible: 
e.g. 
if 
A 
is 
false, 
but 
not 
impossible, 
and 
if 
B 
is 
the 
consequence 
of 
A, 
B 
also 
will 
be 
false 
but 
not 
impossible. 
For 
since 
it 
has 
been 
proved 
that 
if 
B’s 
being 
is 
the 
consequence 
of 
A’s 
being, 
then 
B’s 
possibility 
will 
follow 
from 
A’s 
possibility 
(and 
A 
is 
assumed 
to 
be 
possible), 
consequently 
B 
will 
be 
possible: 
for 
if 
it 
were 
impossible, 
the 
same 
thing 
would 
at 
the 
same 
time 
be 
possible 
and 
impossible. 


Since 
we 
have 
defined 
these 
points, 
let 
A 
belong 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
B 
be 
possible 
for 
all 
C: 
it 
is 
necessary 
then 
that 
should 
be 
a 
possible 
attribute 
for 
all 
C. 
Suppose 
that 
it 
is 
not 
possible, 
but 
assume 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
C: 
this 
is 
false 
but 
not 
impossible. 
If 
then 
A 
is 
not 
possible 
for 
C 
but 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
then 
A 
is 
not 
possible 
for 
all 
B: 
for 
a 
syllogism 
is 
formed 
in 
the 
third 
degree. 
But 
it 
was 
assumed 
that 
A 
is 
a 
possible 
attribute 
for 
all 
B. 
It 
is 
necessary 
then 
that 
A 
is 
possible 
for 
all 
C. 
For 
though 
the 
assumption 
we 
made 
is 
false 
and 
not 
impossible, 
the 
conclusion 
is 
impossible. 
It 
is 
possible 
also 
in 
the 
first 
figure 
to 
bring 
about 
the 
impossibility, 
by 
assuming 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
C. 
For 
if 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
A 
is 
possible 
for 
all 
B, 
then 
A 



would 
be 
possible 
for 
all 
C. 
But 
the 
assumption 
was 
made 
that 
A 
is 
not 
possible 
for 
all 
C. 


We 
must 
understand 
‘that 
which 
belongs 
to 
all’ 
with 
no 
limitation 
in 
respect 
of 
time, 
e.g. 
to 
the 
present 
or 
to 
a 
particular 
period, 
but 
simply 
without 
qualification. 
For 
it 
is 
by 
the 
help 
of 
such 
premisses 
that 
we 
make 
syllogisms, 
since 
if 
the 
premiss 
is 
understood 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
present 
moment, 
there 
cannot 
be 
a 
syllogism. 
For 
nothing 
perhaps 
prevents 
‘man’ 
belonging 
at 
a 
particular 
time 
to 
everything 
that 
is 
moving, 
i.e. 
if 
nothing 
else 
were 
moving: 
but 
‘moving’ 
is 
possible 
for 
every 
horse; 
yet 
‘man’ 
is 
possible 
for 
no 
horse. 
Further 
let 
the 
major 
term 
be 
‘animal’, 
the 
middle 
‘moving’, 
the 
the 
minor 
‘man’. 
The 
premisses 
then 
will 
be 
as 
before, 
but 
the 
conclusion 
necessary, 
not 
possible. 
For 
man 
is 
necessarily 
animal. 
It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
the 
universal 
must 
be 
understood 
simply, 
without 
limitation 
in 
respect 
of 
time. 


Again 
let 
the 
premiss 
AB 
be 
universal 
and 
negative, 
and 
assume 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
but 
B 
possibly 
belongs 
to 
all 
C. 
These 
propositions 
being 
laid 
down, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
A 
possibly 
belongs 
to 
no 
C. 
Suppose 
that 
it 
cannot 
belong, 
and 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
C, 
as 
above. 
It 
is 
necessary 
then 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B: 
for 
we 
have 
a 
syllogism 
in 
the 
third 
figure: 
but 
this 
is 
impossible. 
Thus 
it 
will 
be 
possible 
for 
A 
to 
belong 
to 
no 
C; 
for 
if 
at 
is 
supposed 
false, 
the 
consequence 
is 
an 
impossible 
one. 
This 
syllogism 
then 
does 
not 
establish 
that 
which 
is 
possible 
according 
to 
the 
definition, 
but 
that 
which 
does 
not 
necessarily 
belong 
to 
any 
part 
of 
the 
subject 
(for 
this 
is 
the 
contradictory 
of 
the 
assumption 
which 
was 
made: 
for 
it 
was 
supposed 
that 
A 
necessarily 
belongs 
to 
some 
C, 
but 
the 
syllogism 
per 
impossibile 
establishes 
the 
contradictory 
which 
is 
opposed 
to 
this). 
Further, 
it 
is 
clear 
also 
from 
an 
example 
that 
the 
conclusion 
will 
not 
establish 
possibility. 
Let 
A 
be 
‘raven’, 
B 
‘intelligent’, 
and 
C 
‘man’. 
A 
then 
belongs 
to 
no 
B: 
for 
no 
intelligent 
thing 
is 
a 
raven. 
But 
B 
is 
possible 
for 
all 
C: 
for 
every 
man 
may 
possibly 
be 
intelligent. 
But 
A 
necessarily 
belongs 
to 
no 
C: 
so 
the 
conclusion 
does 
not 
establish 
possibility. 
But 
neither 
is 
it 
always 
necessary. 
Let 
A 
be 
‘moving’, 
B 
‘science’, 
C 
‘man’. 
A 
then 
will 
belong 
to 
no 
B; 
but 
B 
is 
possible 
for 
all 
C. 
And 
the 
conclusion 
will 
not 
be 
necessary. 
For 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
no 
man 
should 
move; 
rather 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
any 
man 
should 
move. 
Clearly 
then 
the 
conclusion 
establishes 
that 
one 
term 
does 
not 
necessarily 
belong 
to 
any 
instance 
of 
another 
term. 
But 
we 
must 
take 
our 
terms 
better. 


If 
the 
minor 
premiss 
is 
negative 
and 
indicates 
possibility, 
from 
the 
actual 
premisses 
taken 
there 
can 
be 
no 
syllogism, 
but 
if 
the 
problematic 
premiss 
is 



converted, 
a 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible, 
as 
before. 
Let 
A 
belong 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
let 
B 
possibly 
belong 
to 
no 
C. 
If 
the 
terms 
are 
arranged 
thus, 
nothing 
necessarily 
follows: 
but 
if 
the 
proposition 
BC 
is 
converted 
and 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
B 
is 
possible 
for 
all 
C, 
a 
syllogism 
results 
as 
before: 
for 
the 
terms 
are 
in 
the 
same 
relative 
positions. 
Likewise 
if 
both 
the 
relations 
are 
negative, 
if 
the 
major 
premiss 
states 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
B, 
and 
the 
minor 
premiss 
indicates 
that 
B 
may 
possibly 
belong 
to 
no 
C. 
Through 
the 
premisses 
actually 
taken 
nothing 
necessary 
results 
in 
any 
way; 
but 
if 
the 
problematic 
premiss 
is 
converted, 
we 
shall 
have 
a 
syllogism. 
Suppose 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
B 
may 
possibly 
belong 
to 
no 
C. 
Through 
these 
comes 
nothing 
necessary. 
But 
if 
B 
is 
assumed 
to 
be 
possible 
for 
all 
C 
(and 
this 
is 
true) 
and 
if 
the 
premiss 
AB 
remains 
as 
before, 
we 
shall 
again 
have 
the 
same 
syllogism. 
But 
if 
it 
be 
assumed 
that 
B 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
any 
C, 
instead 
of 
possibly 
not 
belonging, 
there 
cannot 
be 
a 
syllogism 
anyhow, 
whether 
the 
premiss 
AB 
is 
negative 
or 
affirmative. 
As 
common 
instances 
of 
a 
necessary 
and 
positive 
relation 
we 
may 
take 
the 
terms 
white-animal-snow: 
of 
a 
necessary 
and 
negative 
relation, 
white-animal-pitch. 
Clearly 
then 
if 
the 
terms 
are 
universal, 
and 
one 
of 
the 
premisses 
is 
assertoric, 
the 
other 
problematic, 
whenever 
the 
minor 
premiss 
is 
problematic 
a 
syllogism 
always 
results, 
only 
sometimes 
it 
results 
from 
the 
premisses 
that 
are 
taken, 
sometimes 
it 
requires 
the 
conversion 
of 
one 
premiss. 
We 
have 
stated 
when 
each 
of 
these 
happens 
and 
the 
reason 
why. 
But 
if 
one 
of 
the 
relations 
is 
universal, 
the 
other 
particular, 
then 
whenever 
the 
major 
premiss 
is 
universal 
and 
problematic, 
whether 
affirmative 
or 
negative, 
and 
the 
particular 
is 
affirmative 
and 
assertoric, 
there 
will 
be 
a 
perfect 
syllogism, 
just 
as 
when 
the 
terms 
are 
universal. 
The 
demonstration 
is 
the 
same 
as 
before. 
But 
whenever 
the 
major 
premiss 
is 
universal, 
but 
assertoric, 
not 
problematic, 
and 
the 
minor 
is 
particular 
and 
problematic, 
whether 
both 
premisses 
are 
negative 
or 
affirmative, 
or 
one 
is 
negative, 
the 
other 
affirmative, 
in 
all 
cases 
there 
will 
be 
an 
imperfect 
syllogism. 
Only 
some 
of 
them 
will 
be 
proved 
per 
impossibile, 
others 
by 
the 
conversion 
of 
the 
problematic 
premiss, 
as 
has 
been 
shown 
above. 
And 
a 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible 
by 
means 
of 
conversion 
when 
the 
major 
premiss 
is 
universal 
and 
assertoric, 
whether 
positive 
or 
negative, 
and 
the 
minor 
particular, 
negative, 
and 
problematic, 
e.g. 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B 
or 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
B 
may 
possibly 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C. 
For 
if 
the 
premiss 
BC 
is 
converted 
in 
respect 
of 
possibility, 
a 
syllogism 
results. 
But 
whenever 
the 
particular 
premiss 
is 
assertoric 
and 
negative, 
there 
cannot 
be 
a 
syllogism. 
As 
instances 
of 
the 
positive 
relation 
we 
may 
take 
the 
terms 
white-animal-snow; 



of 
the 
negative, 
white-animal-pitch. 
For 
the 
demonstration 
must 
be 
made 
through 
the 
indefinite 
nature 
of 
the 
particular 
premiss. 
But 
if 
the 
minor 
premiss 
is 
universal, 
and 
the 
major 
particular, 
whether 
either 
premiss 
is 
negative 
or 
affirmative, 
problematic 
or 
assertoric, 
nohow 
is 
a 
syllogism 
possible. 
Nor 
is 
a 
syllogism 
possible 
when 
the 
premisses 
are 
particular 
or 
indefinite, 
whether 
problematic 
or 
assertoric, 
or 
the 
one 
problematic, 
the 
other 
assertoric. 
The 
demonstration 
is 
the 
same 
as 
above. 
As 
instances 
of 
the 
necessary 
and 
positive 
relation 
we 
may 
take 
the 
terms 
animal-white-man; 
of 
the 
necessary 
and 
negative 
relation, 
animal-white-garment. 
It 
is 
evident 
then 
that 
if 
the 
major 
premiss 
is 
universal, 
a 
syllogism 
always 
results, 
but 
if 
the 
minor 
is 
universal 
nothing 
at 
all 
can 
ever 
be 
proved. 


Whenever 
one 
premiss 
is 
necessary, 
the 
other 
problematic, 
there 
will 
be 
a 
syllogism 
when 
the 
terms 
are 
related 
as 
before; 
and 
a 
perfect 
syllogism 
when 
the 
minor 
premiss 
is 
necessary. 
If 
the 
premisses 
are 
affirmative 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
problematic, 
not 
assertoric, 
whether 
the 
premisses 
are 
universal 
or 
not: 
but 
if 
one 
is 
affirmative, 
the 
other 
negative, 
when 
the 
affirmative 
is 
necessary 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
problematic, 
not 
negative 
assertoric; 
but 
when 
the 
negative 
is 
necessary 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
problematic 
negative, 
and 
assertoric 
negative, 
whether 
the 
premisses 
are 
universal 
or 
not. 
Possibility 
in 
the 
conclusion 
must 
be 
understood 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
before. 
There 
cannot 
be 
an 
inference 
to 
the 
necessary 
negative 
proposition: 
for 
‘not 
necessarily 
to 
belong’ 
is 
different 
from 
‘necessarily 
not 
to 
belong’. 


If 
the 
premisses 
are 
affirmative, 
clearly 
the 
conclusion 
which 
follows 
is 
not 
necessary. 
Suppose 
A 
necessarily 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
let 
B 
be 
possible 
for 
all 
C. 
We 
shall 
have 
an 
imperfect 
syllogism 
to 
prove 
that 
A 
may 
belong 
to 
all 


C. 
That 
it 
is 
imperfect 
is 
clear 
from 
the 
proof: 
for 
it 
will 
be 
proved 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
above. 
Again, 
let 
A 
be 
possible 
for 
all 
B, 
and 
let 
B 
necessarily 
belong 
to 
all 
C. 
We 
shall 
then 
have 
a 
syllogism 
to 
prove 
that 
A 
may 
belong 
to 
all 
C, 
not 
that 
A 
does 
belong 
to 
all 
C: 
and 
it 
is 
perfect, 
not 
imperfect: 
for 
it 
is 
completed 
directly 
through 
the 
original 
premisses. 
But 
if 
the 
premisses 
are 
not 
similar 
in 
quality, 
suppose 
first 
that 
the 
negative 
premiss 
is 
necessary, 
and 
let 
necessarily 
A 
not 
be 
possible 
for 
any 
B, 
but 
let 
B 
be 
possible 
for 
all 
C. 
It 
is 
necessary 
then 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
C. 
For 



suppose 
A 
to 
belong 
to 
all 
C 
or 
to 
some 
C. 
Now 
we 
assumed 
that 
A 
is 
not 
possible 
for 
any 
B. 
Since 
then 
the 
negative 
proposition 
is 
convertible, 
B 
is 
not 
possible 
for 
any 
A. 
But 
A 
is 
supposed 
to 
belong 
to 
all 
C 
or 
to 
some 
C. 
Consequently 
B 
will 
not 
be 
possible 
for 
any 
C 
or 
for 
all 
C. 
But 
it 
was 
originally 
laid 
down 
that 
B 
is 
possible 
for 
all 
C. 
And 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
possibility 
of 
belonging 
can 
be 
inferred, 
since 
the 
fact 
of 
not 
belonging 
is 
inferred. 
Again, 
let 
the 
affirmative 
premiss 
be 
necessary, 
and 
let 
A 
possibly 
not 
belong 
to 
any 
B, 
and 
let 
B 
necessarily 
belong 
to 
all 
C. 
The 
syllogism 
will 
be 
perfect, 
but 
it 
will 
establish 
a 
problematic 
negative, 
not 
an 
assertoric 
negative. 
For 
the 
major 
premiss 
was 
problematic, 
and 
further 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
prove 
the 
assertoric 
conclusion 
per 
impossibile. 
For 
if 
it 
were 
supposed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
C, 
and 
it 
is 
laid 
down 
that 
A 
possibly 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
any 
B, 
no 
impossible 
relation 
between 
B 
and 
C 
follows 
from 
these 
premisses. 
But 
if 
the 
minor 
premiss 
is 
negative, 
when 
it 
is 
problematic 
a 
syllogism 
is 
possible 
by 
conversion, 
as 
above; 
but 
when 
it 
is 
necessary 
no 
syllogism 
can 
be 
formed. 
Nor 
again 
when 
both 
premisses 
are 
negative, 
and 
the 
minor 
is 
necessary. 
The 
same 
terms 
as 
before 
serve 
both 
for 
the 
positive 
relation-white-animal-snow, 
and 
for 
the 
negative 
relation-white-animal-pitch. 


The 
same 
relation 
will 
obtain 
in 
particular 
syllogisms. 
Whenever 
the 
negative 
proposition 
is 
necessary, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
negative 
assertoric: 


e.g. 
if 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
any 
B, 
but 
B 
may 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
the 
Cs, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
A 
should 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
the 
Cs. 
For 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
but 
cannot 
belong 
to 
any 
B, 
neither 
can 
B 
belong 
to 
any 
A. 
So 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
to 
none 
of 
the 
Cs 
can 
B 
belong. 
But 
it 
was 
laid 
down 
that 
B 
may 
belong 
to 
some 
C. 
But 
when 
the 
particular 
affirmative 
in 
the 
negative 
syllogism, 
e.g. 
BC 
the 
minor 
premiss, 
or 
the 
universal 
proposition 
in 
the 
affirmative 
syllogism, 
e.g. 
AB 
the 
major 
premiss, 
is 
necessary, 
there 
will 
not 
be 
an 
assertoric 
conclusion. 
The 
demonstration 
is 
the 
same 
as 
before. 
But 
if 
the 
minor 
premiss 
is 
universal, 
and 
problematic, 
whether 
affirmative 
or 
negative, 
and 
the 
major 
premiss 
is 
particular 
and 
necessary, 
there 
cannot 
be 
a 
syllogism. 
Premisses 
of 
this 
kind 
are 
possible 
both 
where 
the 
relation 
is 
positive 
and 
necessary, 
e.g. 
animal-white-man, 
and 
where 
it 
is 
necessary 
and 
negative, 
e.g. 
animal-white-garment. 
But 
when 
the 
universal 
is 
necessary, 
the 
particular 
problematic, 
if 
the 
universal 
is 
negative 
we 
may 
take 
the 
terms 
animal-white-raven 
to 
illustrate 
the 
positive 
relation, 
or 
animal-white-pitch 
to 
illustrate 
the 
negative; 
and 
if 
the 
universal 
is 
affirmative 
we 
may 
take 
the 
terms 
animal-white-swan 
to 
illustrate 
the 

positive 
relation, 
and 
animal-white-snow 
to 
illustrate 
the 
negative 
and 
necessary 
relation. 
Nor 
again 
is 
a 
syllogism 
possible 
when 
the 
premisses 
are 
indefinite, 
or 
both 
particular. 
Terms 
applicable 
in 
either 
case 
to 
illustrate 
the 
positive 
relation 
are 
animal-white-man: 
to 
illustrate 
the 
negative, 
animalwhite-
inanimate. 
For 
the 
relation 
of 
animal 
to 
some 
white, 
and 
of 
white 
to 
some 
inanimate, 
is 
both 
necessary 
and 
positive 
and 
necessary 
and 
negative. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
relation 
is 
problematic: 
so 
the 
terms 
may 
be 
used 
for 
all 
cases. 


Clearly 
then 
from 
what 
has 
been 
said 
a 
syllogism 
results 
or 
not 
from 
similar 
relations 
of 
the 
terms 
whether 
we 
are 
dealing 
with 
simple 
existence 
or 
necessity, 
with 
this 
exception, 
that 
if 
the 
negative 
premiss 
is 
assertoric 
the 
conclusion 
is 
problematic, 
but 
if 
the 
negative 
premiss 
is 
necessary 
the 
conclusion 
is 
both 
problematic 
and 
negative 
assertoric. 
[It 
is 
clear 
also 
that 
all 
the 
syllogisms 
are 
imperfect 
and 
are 
perfected 
by 
means 
of 
the 
figures 
above 
mentioned.] 


In 
the 
second 
figure 
whenever 
both 
premisses 
are 
problematic, 
no 
syllogism 
is 
possible, 
whether 
the 
premisses 
are 
affirmative 
or 
negative, 
universal 
or 
particular. 
But 
when 
one 
premiss 
is 
assertoric, 
the 
other 
problematic, 
if 
the 
affirmative 
is 
assertoric 
no 
syllogism 
is 
possible, 
but 
if 
the 
universal 
negative 
is 
assertoric 
a 
conclusion 
can 
always 
be 
drawn. 
Similarly 
when 
one 
premiss 
is 
necessary, 
the 
other 
problematic. 
Here 
also 
we 
must 
understand 
the 
term 
‘possible’ 
in 
the 
conclusion, 
in 
the 
same 
sense 
as 
before. 


First 
we 
must 
point 
out 
that 
the 
negative 
problematic 
proposition 
is 
not 
convertible, 
e.g. 
if 
A 
may 
belong 
to 
no 
B, 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
B 
may 
belong 
to 
no 
A. 
For 
suppose 
it 
to 
follow 
and 
assume 
that 
B 
may 
belong 
to 
no 


A. 
Since 
then 
problematic 
affirmations 
are 
convertible 
with 
negations, 
whether 
they 
are 
contraries 
or 
contradictories, 
and 
since 
B 
may 
belong 
to 
no 
A, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
B 
may 
belong 
to 
all 
A. 
But 
this 
is 
false: 
for 
if 
all 
this 
can 
be 
that, 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
all 
that 
can 
be 
this: 
consequently 
the 
negative 
proposition 
is 
not 
convertible. 
Further, 
these 
propositions 
are 
not 
incompatible, 
‘A 
may 
belong 
to 
no 
B’, 
‘B 
necessarily 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
the 
As’; 
e.g. 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
no 
man 
should 
be 
white 
(for 
it 
is 
also 
possible 
that 
every 
man 
should 
be 
white), 
but 
it 
is 
not 
true 
to 
say 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
no 
white 
thing 
should 
be 
a 
man: 
for 
many 
white 
things 
are 
necessarily 
not 
men, 
and 
the 
necessary 
(as 
we 
saw) 
other 
than 
the 
possible. 

Moreover 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
prove 
the 
convertibility 
of 
these 
propositions 
by 
a 
reductio 
ad 
absurdum, 
i.e. 
by 
claiming 
assent 
to 
the 
following 
argument: 
‘since 
it 
is 
false 
that 
B 
may 
belong 
to 
no 
A, 
it 
is 
true 
that 
it 
cannot 
belong 
to 
no 
A, 
for 
the 
one 
statement 
is 
the 
contradictory 
of 
the 
other. 
But 
if 
this 
is 
so, 
it 
is 
true 
that 
B 
necessarily 
belongs 
to 
some 
of 
the 
As: 
consequently 
A 
necessarily 
belongs 
to 
some 
of 
the 
Bs. 
But 
this 
is 
impossible.’ 
The 
argument 
cannot 
be 
admitted, 
for 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
some 
A 
is 
necessarily 
B, 
if 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
that 
no 
A 
should 
be 
B. 
For 
the 
latter 
expression 
is 
used 
in 
two 
senses, 
one 
if 
A 
some 
is 
necessarily 
B, 
another 
if 
some 
A 
is 
necessarily 
not 


B. 
For 
it 
is 
not 
true 
to 
say 
that 
that 
which 
necessarily 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
the 
As 
may 
possibly 
not 
belong 
to 
any 
A, 
just 
as 
it 
is 
not 
true 
to 
say 
that 
what 
necessarily 
belongs 
to 
some 
A 
may 
possibly 
belong 
to 
all 
A. 
If 
any 
one 
then 
should 
claim 
that 
because 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
for 
C 
to 
belong 
to 
all 
D, 
it 
necessarily 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
D, 
he 
would 
make 
a 
false 
assumption: 
for 
it 
does 
belong 
to 
all 
D, 
but 
because 
in 
some 
cases 
it 
belongs 
necessarily, 
therefore 
we 
say 
that 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
for 
it 
to 
belong 
to 
all. 
Hence 
both 
the 
propositions 
‘A 
necessarily 
belongs 
to 
some 
B’ 
and 
‘A 
necessarily 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B’ 
are 
opposed 
to 
the 
proposition 
‘A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B’. 
Similarly 
also 
they 
are 
opposed 
to 
the 
proposition 
‘A 
may 
belong 
to 
no 
B’. 
It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
in 
relation 
to 
what 
is 
possible 
and 
not 
possible, 
in 
the 
sense 
originally 
defined, 
we 
must 
assume, 
not 
that 
A 
necessarily 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
but 
that 
A 
necessarily 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B. 
But 
if 
this 
is 
assumed, 
no 
absurdity 
results: 
consequently 
no 
syllogism. 
It 
is 
clear 
from 
what 
has 
been 
said 
that 
the 
negative 
proposition 
is 
not 
convertible. 
This 
being 
proved, 
suppose 
it 
possible 
that 
A 
may 
belong 
to 
no 
B 
and 
to 
all 


C. 
By 
means 
of 
conversion 
no 
syllogism 
will 
result: 
for 
the 
major 
premiss, 
as 
has 
been 
said, 
is 
not 
convertible. 
Nor 
can 
a 
proof 
be 
obtained 
by 
a 
reductio 
ad 
absurdum: 
for 
if 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
B 
can 
belong 
to 
all 
C, 
no 
false 
consequence 
results: 
for 
A 
may 
belong 
both 
to 
all 
C 
and 
to 
no 
C. 
In 
general, 
if 
there 
is 
a 
syllogism, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
its 
conclusion 
will 
be 
problematic 
because 
neither 
of 
the 
premisses 
is 
assertoric; 
and 
this 
must 
be 
either 
affirmative 
or 
negative. 
But 
neither 
is 
possible. 
Suppose 
the 
conclusion 
is 
affirmative: 
it 
will 
be 
proved 
by 
an 
example 
that 
the 
predicate 
cannot 
belong 
to 
the 
subject. 
Suppose 
the 
conclusion 
is 
negative: 
it 
will 
be 
proved 
that 
it 
is 
not 
problematic 
but 
necessary. 
Let 
A 
be 
white, 
B 
man, 
C 
horse. 
It 
is 
possible 
then 
for 
A 
to 
belong 
to 
all 
of 
the 
one 
and 
to 
none 
of 
the 
other. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
for 
B 
to 
belong 
nor 
not 
to 
belong 
to 
C. 
That 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
for 
it 
to 

belong, 
is 
clear. 
For 
no 
horse 
is 
a 
man. 
Neither 
is 
it 
possible 
for 
it 
not 
to 
belong. 
For 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
no 
horse 
should 
be 
a 
man, 
but 
the 
necessary 
we 
found 
to 
be 
different 
from 
the 
possible. 
No 
syllogism 
then 
results. 
A 
similar 
proof 
can 
be 
given 
if 
the 
major 
premiss 
is 
negative, 
the 
minor 
affirmative, 
or 
if 
both 
are 
affirmative 
or 
negative. 
The 
demonstration 
can 
be 
made 
by 
means 
of 
the 
same 
terms. 
And 
whenever 
one 
premiss 
is 
universal, 
the 
other 
particular, 
or 
both 
are 
particular 
or 
indefinite, 
or 
in 
whatever 
other 
way 
the 
premisses 
can 
be 
altered, 
the 
proof 
will 
always 
proceed 
through 
the 
same 
terms. 
Clearly 
then, 
if 
both 
the 
premisses 
are 
problematic, 
no 
syllogism 
results. 


But 
if 
one 
premiss 
is 
assertoric, 
the 
other 
problematic, 
if 
the 
affirmative 
is 
assertoric 
and 
the 
negative 
problematic 
no 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible, 
whether 
the 
premisses 
are 
universal 
or 
particular. 
The 
proof 
is 
the 
same 
as 
above, 
and 
by 
means 
of 
the 
same 
terms. 
But 
when 
the 
affirmative 
premiss 
is 
problematic, 
and 
the 
negative 
assertoric, 
we 
shall 
have 
a 
syllogism. 
Suppose 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
but 
can 
belong 
to 
all 
C. 
If 
the 
negative 
proposition 
is 
converted, 
B 
will 
belong 
to 
no 
A. 
But 
ex 
hypothesi 
can 
belong 
to 
all 
C: 
so 
a 
syllogism 
is 
made, 
proving 
by 
means 
of 
the 
first 
figure 
that 
B 
may 
belong 
to 
no 
C. 
Similarly 
also 
if 
the 
minor 
premiss 
is 
negative. 
But 
if 
both 
premisses 
are 
negative, 
one 
being 
assertoric, 
the 
other 
problematic, 
nothing 
follows 
necessarily 
from 
these 
premisses 
as 
they 
stand, 
but 
if 
the 
problematic 
premiss 
is 
converted 
into 
its 
complementary 
affirmative 
a 
syllogism 
is 
formed 
to 
prove 
that 
B 
may 
belong 
to 
no 
C, 
as 
before: 
for 
we 
shall 
again 
have 
the 
first 
figure. 
But 
if 
both 
premisses 
are 
affirmative, 
no 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible. 
This 
arrangement 
of 
terms 
is 
possible 
both 
when 
the 
relation 
is 
positive, 
e.g. 
health, 
animal, 
man, 
and 
when 
it 
is 
negative, 
e.g. 
health, 
horse, 
man. 


The 
same 
will 
hold 
good 
if 
the 
syllogisms 
are 
particular. 
Whenever 
the 
affirmative 
proposition 
is 
assertoric, 
whether 
universal 
or 
particular, 
no 
syllogism 
is 
possible 
(this 
is 
proved 
similarly 
and 
by 
the 
same 
examples 
as 
above), 
but 
when 
the 
negative 
proposition 
is 
assertoric, 
a 
conclusion 
can 
be 
drawn 
by 
means 
of 
conversion, 
as 
before. 
Again 
if 
both 
the 
relations 
are 
negative, 
and 
the 
assertoric 
proposition 
is 
universal, 
although 
no 
conclusion 
follows 
from 
the 
actual 
premisses, 
a 
syllogism 
can 
be 
obtained 
by 
converting 
the 
problematic 
premiss 
into 
its 
complementary 
affirmative 
as 
before. 
But 
if 



the 
negative 
proposition 
is 
assertoric, 
but 
particular, 
no 
syllogism 
is 
possible, 
whether 
the 
other 
premiss 
is 
affirmative 
or 
negative. 
Nor 
can 
a 
conclusion 
be 
drawn 
when 
both 
premisses 
are 
indefinite, 
whether 
affirmative 
or 
negative, 
or 
particular. 
The 
proof 
is 
the 
same 
and 
by 
the 
same 
terms. 


If 
one 
of 
the 
premisses 
is 
necessary, 
the 
other 
problematic, 
then 
if 
the 
negative 
is 
necessary 
a 
syllogistic 
conclusion 
can 
be 
drawn, 
not 
merely 
a 
negative 
problematic 
but 
also 
a 
negative 
assertoric 
conclusion; 
but 
if 
the 
affirmative 
premiss 
is 
necessary, 
no 
conclusion 
is 
possible. 
Suppose 
that 
A 
necessarily 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
but 
may 
belong 
to 
all 
C. 
If 
the 
negative 
premiss 
is 
converted 
B 
will 
belong 
to 
no 
A: 
but 
A 
ex 
hypothesi 
is 
capable 
of 
belonging 
to 
all 
C: 
so 
once 
more 
a 
conclusion 
is 
drawn 
by 
the 
first 
figure 
that 
B 
may 
belong 
to 
no 
C. 
But 
at 
the 
same 
time 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
B 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
any 
C. 
For 
assume 
that 
it 
does: 
then 
if 
A 
cannot 
belong 
to 
any 
B, 
and 
B 
belongs 
to 
some 
of 
the 
Cs, 
A 
cannot 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
the 
Cs: 
but 
ex 
hypothesi 
it 
may 
belong 
to 
all. 
A 
similar 
proof 
can 
be 
given 
if 
the 
minor 
premiss 
is 
negative. 
Again 
let 
the 
affirmative 
proposition 
be 
necessary, 
and 
the 
other 
problematic; 
i.e. 
suppose 
that 
A 
may 
belong 
to 
no 
B, 
but 
necessarily 
belongs 
to 
all 
C. 
When 
the 
terms 
are 
arranged 
in 
this 
way, 
no 
syllogism 
is 
possible. 
For 
(1) 
it 
sometimes 
turns 
out 
that 
B 
necessarily 
does 
not 
belong 
to 


C. 
Let 
A 
be 
white, 
B 
man, 
C 
swan. 
White 
then 
necessarily 
belongs 
to 
swan, 
but 
may 
belong 
to 
no 
man; 
and 
man 
necessarily 
belongs 
to 
no 
swan; 
Clearly 
then 
we 
cannot 
draw 
a 
problematic 
conclusion; 
for 
that 
which 
is 
necessary 
is 
admittedly 
distinct 
from 
that 
which 
is 
possible. 
(2) 
Nor 
again 
can 
we 
draw 
a 
necessary 
conclusion: 
for 
that 
presupposes 
that 
both 
premisses 
are 
necessary, 
or 
at 
any 
rate 
the 
negative 
premiss. 
(3) 
Further 
it 
is 
possible 
also, 
when 
the 
terms 
are 
so 
arranged, 
that 
B 
should 
belong 
to 
C: 
for 
nothing 
prevents 
C 
falling 
under 
B, 
A 
being 
possible 
for 
all 
B, 
and 
necessarily 
belonging 
to 
C; 
e.g. 
if 
C 
stands 
for 
‘awake’, 
B 
for 
‘animal’, 
A 
for 
‘motion’. 
For 
motion 
necessarily 
belongs 
to 
what 
is 
awake, 
and 
is 
possible 
for 
every 
animal: 
and 
everything 
that 
is 
awake 
is 
animal. 
Clearly 
then 
the 
conclusion 
cannot 
be 
the 
negative 
assertion, 
if 
the 
relation 
must 
be 
positive 
when 
the 
terms 
are 
related 
as 
above. 
Nor 
can 
the 
opposite 
affirmations 
be 
established: 
consequently 
no 
syllogism 
is 
possible. 
A 
similar 
proof 
is 
possible 
if 
the 
major 
premiss 
is 
affirmative. 

But 
if 
the 
premisses 
are 
similar 
in 
quality, 
when 
they 
are 
negative 
a 
syllogism 
can 
always 
be 
formed 
by 
converting 
the 
problematic 
premiss 
into 
its 
complementary 
affirmative 
as 
before. 
Suppose 
A 
necessarily 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
B, 
and 
possibly 
may 
not 
belong 
to 
C: 
if 
the 
premisses 
are 
converted 
B 
belongs 
to 
no 
A, 
and 
A 
may 
possibly 
belong 
to 
all 
C: 
thus 
we 
have 
the 
first 
figure. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
minor 
premiss 
is 
negative. 
But 
if 
the 
premisses 
are 
affirmative 
there 
cannot 
be 
a 
syllogism. 
Clearly 
the 
conclusion 
cannot 
be 
a 
negative 
assertoric 
or 
a 
negative 
necessary 
proposition 
because 
no 
negative 
premiss 
has 
been 
laid 
down 
either 
in 
the 
assertoric 
or 
in 
the 
necessary 
mode. 
Nor 
can 
the 
conclusion 
be 
a 
problematic 
negative 
proposition. 
For 
if 
the 
terms 
are 
so 
related, 
there 
are 
cases 
in 
which 
B 
necessarily 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
C; 
e.g. 
suppose 
that 
A 
is 
white, 
B 
swan, 
C 
man. 
Nor 
can 
the 
opposite 
affirmations 
be 
established, 
since 
we 
have 
shown 
a 
case 
in 
which 
B 
necessarily 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
C. 
A 
syllogism 
then 
is 
not 
possible 
at 
all. 


Similar 
relations 
will 
obtain 
in 
particular 
syllogisms. 
For 
whenever 
the 
negative 
proposition 
is 
universal 
and 
necessary, 
a 
syllogism 
will 
always 
be 
possible 
to 
prove 
both 
a 
problematic 
and 
a 
negative 
assertoric 
proposition 
(the 
proof 
proceeds 
by 
conversion); 
but 
when 
the 
affirmative 
proposition 
is 
universal 
and 
necessary, 
no 
syllogistic 
conclusion 
can 
be 
drawn. 
This 
can 
be 
proved 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
for 
universal 
propositions, 
and 
by 
the 
same 
terms. 
Nor 
is 
a 
syllogistic 
conclusion 
possible 
when 
both 
premisses 
are 
affirmative: 
this 
also 
may 
be 
proved 
as 
above. 
But 
when 
both 
premisses 
are 
negative, 
and 
the 
premiss 
that 
definitely 
disconnects 
two 
terms 
is 
universal 
and 
necessary, 
though 
nothing 
follows 
necessarily 
from 
the 
premisses 
as 
they 
are 
stated, 
a 
conclusion 
can 
be 
drawn 
as 
above 
if 
the 
problematic 
premiss 
is 
converted 
into 
its 
complementary 
affirmative. 
But 
if 
both 
are 
indefinite 
or 
particular, 
no 
syllogism 
can 
be 
formed. 
The 
same 
proof 
will 
serve, 
and 
the 
same 
terms. 


It 
is 
clear 
then 
from 
what 
has 
been 
said 
that 
if 
the 
universal 
and 
negative 
premiss 
is 
necessary, 
a 
syllogism 
is 
always 
possible, 
proving 
not 
merely 
a 
negative 
problematic, 
but 
also 
a 
negative 
assertoric 
proposition; 
but 
if 
the 
affirmative 
premiss 
is 
necessary 
no 
conclusion 
can 
be 
drawn. 
It 
is 
clear 
too 
that 
a 
syllogism 
is 
possible 
or 
not 
under 
the 
same 
conditions 
whether 
the 
mode 
of 
the 
premisses 
is 
assertoric 
or 
necessary. 
And 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
all 
the 
syllogisms 
are 
imperfect, 
and 
are 
completed 
by 
means 
of 
the 
figures 
mentioned. 



In 
the 
last 
figure 
a 
syllogism 
is 
possible 
whether 
both 
or 
only 
one 
of 
the 
premisses 
is 
problematic. 
When 
the 
premisses 
are 
problematic 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
problematic; 
and 
also 
when 
one 
premiss 
is 
problematic, 
the 
other 
assertoric. 
But 
when 
the 
other 
premiss 
is 
necessary, 
if 
it 
is 
affirmative 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
neither 
necessary 
or 
assertoric; 
but 
if 
it 
is 
negative 
the 
syllogism 
will 
result 
in 
a 
negative 
assertoric 
proposition, 
as 
above. 
In 
these 
also 
we 
must 
understand 
the 
expression 
‘possible’ 
in 
the 
conclusion 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
before. 


First 
let 
the 
premisses 
be 
problematic 
and 
suppose 
that 
both 
A 
and 
B 
may 
possibly 
belong 
to 
every 
C. 
Since 
then 
the 
affirmative 
proposition 
is 
convertible 
into 
a 
particular, 
and 
B 
may 
possibly 
belong 
to 
every 
C, 
it 
follows 
that 
C 
may 
possibly 
belong 
to 
some 
B. 
So, 
if 
A 
is 
possible 
for 
every 
C, 
and 
C 
is 
possible 
for 
some 
of 
the 
Bs, 
then 
A 
is 
possible 
for 
some 
of 
the 
Bs. 
For 
we 
have 
got 
the 
first 
figure. 
And 
A 
if 
may 
possibly 
belong 
to 
no 
C, 
but 
B 
may 
possibly 
belong 
to 
all 
C, 
it 
follows 
that 
A 
may 
possibly 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B: 
for 
we 
shall 
have 
the 
first 
figure 
again 
by 
conversion. 
But 
if 
both 
premisses 
should 
be 
negative 
no 
necessary 
consequence 
will 
follow 
from 
them 
as 
they 
are 
stated, 
but 
if 
the 
premisses 
are 
converted 
into 
their 
corresponding 
affirmatives 
there 
will 
be 
a 
syllogism 
as 
before. 
For 
if 
A 
and 
B 
may 
possibly 
not 
belong 
to 
C, 
if 
‘may 
possibly 
belong’ 
is 
substituted 
we 
shall 
again 
have 
the 
first 
figure 
by 
means 
of 
conversion. 
But 
if 
one 
of 
the 
premisses 
is 
universal, 
the 
other 
particular, 
a 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible, 
or 
not, 
under 
the 
arrangement 
of 
the 
terms 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
assertoric 
propositions. 
Suppose 
that 
A 
may 
possibly 
belong 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
B 
to 
some 
C. 
We 
shall 
have 
the 
first 
figure 
again 
if 
the 
particular 
premiss 
is 
converted. 
For 
if 
A 
is 
possible 
for 
all 
C, 
and 
C 
for 
some 
of 
the 
Bs, 
then 
A 
is 
possible 
for 
some 
of 
the 
Bs. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
proposition 
BC 
is 
universal. 
Likewise 
also 
if 
the 
proposition 
AC 
is 
negative, 
and 
the 
proposition 
BC 
affirmative: 
for 
we 
shall 
again 
have 
the 
first 
figure 
by 
conversion. 
But 
if 
both 
premisses 
should 
be 
negative-the 
one 
universal 
and 
the 
other 
particular-although 
no 
syllogistic 
conclusion 
will 
follow 
from 
the 
premisses 
as 
they 
are 
put, 
it 
will 
follow 
if 
they 
are 
converted, 
as 
above. 
But 
when 
both 
premisses 
are 
indefinite 
or 
particular, 
no 
syllogism 
can 
be 
formed: 
for 
A 
must 
belong 
sometimes 
to 
all 
B 
and 
sometimes 
to 
no 
B. 
To 
illustrate 
the 
affirmative 
relation 
take 
the 
terms 
animal-man-white; 
to 
illustrate 
the 
negative, 
take 
the 
terms 
horse-man-white—white 
being 
the 
middle 
term. 



If 
one 
premiss 
is 
pure, 
the 
other 
problematic, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
problematic, 
not 
pure; 
and 
a 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible 
under 
the 
same 
arrangement 
of 
the 
terms 
as 
before. 
First 
let 
the 
premisses 
be 
affirmative: 
suppose 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
B 
may 
possibly 
belong 
to 
all 
C. 
If 
the 
proposition 
BC 
is 
converted, 
we 
shall 
have 
the 
first 
figure, 
and 
the 
conclusion 
that 
A 
may 
possibly 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
the 
Bs. 
For 
when 
one 
of 
the 
premisses 
in 
the 
first 
figure 
is 
problematic, 
the 
conclusion 
also 
(as 
we 
saw) 
is 
problematic. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
proposition 
BC 
is 
pure, 
AC 
problematic; 
or 
if 
AC 
is 
negative, 
BC 
affirmative, 
no 
matter 
which 
of 
the 
two 
is 
pure; 
in 
both 
cases 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
problematic: 
for 
the 
first 
figure 
is 
obtained 
once 
more, 
and 
it 
has 
been 
proved 
that 
if 
one 
premiss 
is 
problematic 
in 
that 
figure 
the 
conclusion 
also 
will 
be 
problematic. 
But 
if 
the 
minor 
premiss 
BC 
is 
negative, 
or 
if 
both 
premisses 
are 
negative, 
no 
syllogistic 
conclusion 
can 
be 
drawn 
from 
the 
premisses 
as 
they 
stand, 
but 
if 
they 
are 
converted 
a 
syllogism 
is 
obtained 
as 
before. 


If 
one 
of 
the 
premisses 
is 
universal, 
the 
other 
particular, 
then 
when 
both 
are 
affirmative, 
or 
when 
the 
universal 
is 
negative, 
the 
particular 
affirmative, 
we 
shall 
have 
the 
same 
sort 
of 
syllogisms: 
for 
all 
are 
completed 
by 
means 
of 
the 
first 
figure. 
So 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
we 
shall 
have 
not 
a 
pure 
but 
a 
problematic 
syllogistic 
conclusion. 
But 
if 
the 
affirmative 
premiss 
is 
universal, 
the 
negative 
particular, 
the 
proof 
will 
proceed 
by 
a 
reductio 
ad 
impossibile. 
Suppose 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
A 
may 
possibly 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C: 
it 
follows 
that 
may 
possibly 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B. 
For 
if 
A 
necessarily 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
B 
(as 
has 
been 
assumed) 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
A 
will 
necessarily 
belong 
to 
all 
C: 
for 
this 
has 
been 
proved 
before. 
But 
it 
was 
assumed 
at 
the 
outset 
that 
A 
may 
possibly 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C. 


Whenever 
both 
premisses 
are 
indefinite 
or 
particular, 
no 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible. 
The 
demonstration 
is 
the 
same 
as 
was 
given 
in 
the 
case 
of 
universal 
premisses, 
and 
proceeds 
by 
means 
of 
the 
same 
terms. 


If 
one 
of 
the 
premisses 
is 
necessary, 
the 
other 
problematic, 
when 
the 
premisses 
are 
affirmative 
a 
problematic 
affirmative 
conclusion 
can 
always 
be 
drawn; 
when 
one 
proposition 
is 
affirmative, 
the 
other 
negative, 
if 
the 



affirmative 
is 
necessary 
a 
problematic 
negative 
can 
be 
inferred; 
but 
if 
the 
negative 
proposition 
is 
necessary 
both 
a 
problematic 
and 
a 
pure 
negative 
conclusion 
are 
possible. 
But 
a 
necessary 
negative 
conclusion 
will 
not 
be 
possible, 
any 
more 
than 
in 
the 
other 
figures. 
Suppose 
first 
that 
the 
premisses 
are 
affirmative, 
i.e. 
that 
A 
necessarily 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
B 
may 
possibly 
belong 
to 
all 
C. 
Since 
then 
A 
must 
belong 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
C 
may 
belong 
to 
some 
B, 
it 
follows 
that 
A 
may 
(not 
does) 
belong 
to 
some 
B: 
for 
so 
it 
resulted 
in 
the 
first 
figure. 
A 
similar 
proof 
may 
be 
given 
if 
the 
proposition 
BC 
is 
necessary, 
and 
AC 
is 
problematic. 
Again 
suppose 
one 
proposition 
is 
affirmative, 
the 
other 
negative, 
the 
affirmative 
being 
necessary: 
i.e. 
suppose 
A 
may 
possibly 
belong 
to 
no 
C, 
but 
B 
necessarily 
belongs 
to 
all 
C. 
We 
shall 
have 
the 
first 
figure 
once 
more: 
and-since 
the 
negative 
premiss 
is 
problematic-it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
problematic: 
for 
when 
the 
premisses 
stand 
thus 
in 
the 
first 
figure, 
the 
conclusion 
(as 
we 
found) 
is 
problematic. 
But 
if 
the 
negative 
premiss 
is 
necessary, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
not 
only 
that 
A 
may 
possibly 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B 
but 
also 
that 
it 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B. 
For 
suppose 
that 
A 
necessarily 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
C, 
but 
B 
may 
belong 
to 
all 
C. 
If 
the 
affirmative 
proposition 
BC 
is 
converted, 
we 
shall 
have 
the 
first 
figure, 
and 
the 
negative 
premiss 
is 
necessary. 
But 
when 
the 
premisses 
stood 
thus, 
it 
resulted 
that 
A 
might 
possibly 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C, 
and 
that 
it 
did 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C; 
consequently 
here 
it 
follows 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B. 
But 
when 
the 
minor 
premiss 
is 
negative, 
if 
it 
is 
problematic 
we 
shall 
have 
a 
syllogism 
by 
altering 
the 
premiss 
into 
its 
complementary 
affirmative, 
as 
before; 
but 
if 
it 
is 
necessary 
no 
syllogism 
can 
be 
formed. 
For 
A 
sometimes 
necessarily 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
sometimes 
cannot 
possibly 
belong 
to 
any 
B. 
To 
illustrate 
the 
former 
take 
the 
terms 
sleep-sleeping 
horse-man; 
to 
illustrate 
the 
latter 
take 
the 
terms 
sleep-waking 
horse-man. 


Similar 
results 
will 
obtain 
if 
one 
of 
the 
terms 
is 
related 
universally 
to 
the 
middle, 
the 
other 
in 
part. 
If 
both 
premisses 
are 
affirmative, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
problematic, 
not 
pure; 
and 
also 
when 
one 
premiss 
is 
negative, 
the 
other 
affirmative, 
the 
latter 
being 
necessary. 
But 
when 
the 
negative 
premiss 
is 
necessary, 
the 
conclusion 
also 
will 
be 
a 
pure 
negative 
proposition; 
for 
the 
same 
kind 
of 
proof 
can 
be 
given 
whether 
the 
terms 
are 
universal 
or 
not. 
For 
the 
syllogisms 
must 
be 
made 
perfect 
by 
means 
of 
the 
first 
figure, 
so 
that 
a 
result 
which 
follows 
in 
the 
first 
figure 
follows 
also 
in 
the 
third. 
But 
when 
the 
minor 
premiss 
is 
negative 
and 
universal, 
if 
it 
is 
problematic 
a 
syllogism 
can 
be 
formed 
by 
means 
of 
conversion; 
but 
if 
it 
is 
necessary 
a 
syllogism 
is 
not 



possible. 
The 
proof 
will 
follow 
the 
same 
course 
as 
where 
the 
premisses 
are 
universal; 
and 
the 
same 
terms 
may 
be 
used. 


It 
is 
clear 
then 
in 
this 
figure 
also 
when 
and 
how 
a 
syllogism 
can 
be 
formed, 
and 
when 
the 
conclusion 
is 
problematic, 
and 
when 
it 
is 
pure. 
It 
is 
evident 
also 
that 
all 
syllogisms 
in 
this 
figure 
are 
imperfect, 
and 
that 
they 
are 
made 
perfect 
by 
means 
of 
the 
first 
figure. 


It 
is 
clear 
from 
what 
has 
been 
said 
that 
the 
syllogisms 
in 
these 
figures 
are 
made 
perfect 
by 
means 
of 
universal 
syllogisms 
in 
the 
first 
figure 
and 
are 
reduced 
to 
them. 
That 
every 
syllogism 
without 
qualification 
can 
be 
so 
treated, 
will 
be 
clear 
presently, 
when 
it 
has 
been 
proved 
that 
every 
syllogism 
is 
formed 
through 
one 
or 
other 
of 
these 
figures. 


It 
is 
necessary 
that 
every 
demonstration 
and 
every 
syllogism 
should 
prove 
either 
that 
something 
belongs 
or 
that 
it 
does 
not, 
and 
this 
either 
universally 
or 
in 
part, 
and 
further 
either 
ostensively 
or 
hypothetically. 
One 
sort 
of 
hypothetical 
proof 
is 
the 
reductio 
ad 
impossibile. 
Let 
us 
speak 
first 
of 
ostensive 
syllogisms: 
for 
after 
these 
have 
been 
pointed 
out 
the 
truth 
of 
our 
contention 
will 
be 
clear 
with 
regard 
to 
those 
which 
are 
proved 
per 
impossibile, 
and 
in 
general 
hypothetically. 


If 
then 
one 
wants 
to 
prove 
syllogistically 
A 
of 
B, 
either 
as 
an 
attribute 
of 
it 
or 
as 
not 
an 
attribute 
of 
it, 
one 
must 
assert 
something 
of 
something 
else. 
If 
now 
A 
should 
be 
asserted 
of 
B, 
the 
proposition 
originally 
in 
question 
will 
have 
been 
assumed. 
But 
if 
A 
should 
be 
asserted 
of 
C, 
but 
C 
should 
not 
be 
asserted 
of 
anything, 
nor 
anything 
of 
it, 
nor 
anything 
else 
of 
A, 
no 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible. 
For 
nothing 
necessarily 
follows 
from 
the 
assertion 
of 
some 
one 
thing 
concerning 
some 
other 
single 
thing. 
Thus 
we 
must 
take 
another 
premiss 
as 
well. 
If 
then 
A 
be 
asserted 
of 
something 
else, 
or 
something 
else 
of 
A, 
or 
something 
different 
of 
C, 
nothing 
prevents 
a 
syllogism 
being 
formed, 
but 
it 
will 
not 
be 
in 
relation 
to 
B 
through 
the 
premisses 
taken. 
Nor 
when 
C 
belongs 
to 
something 
else, 
and 
that 
to 
something 
else 
and 
so 
on, 
no 
connexion 
however 
being 
made 
with 
B, 
will 
a 
syllogism 
be 
possible 
concerning 
A 
in 
its 
relation 
to 
B. 
For 
in 
general 
we 
stated 
that 
no 
syllogism 
can 
establish 
the 
attribution 
of 
one 
thing 
to 
another, 
unless 
some 
middle 
term 
is 
taken, 
which 
is 
somehow 
related 
to 
each 
by 
way 
of 
predication. 
For 
the 
syllogism 
in 
general 
is 
made 
out 
of 
premisses, 
and 
a 
syllogism 
referring 
to 



this 
out 
of 
premisses 
with 
the 
same 
reference, 
and 
a 
syllogism 
relating 
this 
to 
that 
proceeds 
through 
premisses 
which 
relate 
this 
to 
that. 
But 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
take 
a 
premiss 
in 
reference 
to 
B, 
if 
we 
neither 
affirm 
nor 
deny 
anything 
of 
it; 
or 
again 
to 
take 
a 
premiss 
relating 
A 
to 
B, 
if 
we 
take 
nothing 
common, 
but 
affirm 
or 
deny 
peculiar 
attributes 
of 
each. 
So 
we 
must 
take 
something 
midway 
between 
the 
two, 
which 
will 
connect 
the 
predications, 
if 
we 
are 
to 
have 
a 
syllogism 
relating 
this 
to 
that. 
If 
then 
we 
must 
take 
something 
common 
in 
relation 
to 
both, 
and 
this 
is 
possible 
in 
three 
ways 
(either 
by 
predicating 
A 
of 
C, 
and 
C 
of 
B, 
or 
C 
of 
both, 
or 
both 
of 
C), 
and 
these 
are 
the 
figures 
of 
which 
we 
have 
spoken, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
every 
syllogism 
must 
be 
made 
in 
one 
or 
other 
of 
these 
figures. 
The 
argument 
is 
the 
same 
if 
several 
middle 
terms 
should 
be 
necessary 
to 
establish 
the 
relation 
to 
B; 
for 
the 
figure 
will 
be 
the 
same 
whether 
there 
is 
one 
middle 
term 
or 
many. 


It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
the 
ostensive 
syllogisms 
are 
effected 
by 
means 
of 
the 
aforesaid 
figures; 
these 
considerations 
will 
show 
that 
reductiones 
ad 
also 
are 
effected 
in 
the 
same 
way. 
For 
all 
who 
effect 
an 
argument 
per 
impossibile 
infer 
syllogistically 
what 
is 
false, 
and 
prove 
the 
original 
conclusion 
hypothetically 
when 
something 
impossible 
results 
from 
the 
assumption 
of 
its 
contradictory; 
e.g. 
that 
the 
diagonal 
of 
the 
square 
is 
incommensurate 
with 
the 
side, 
because 
odd 
numbers 
are 
equal 
to 
evens 
if 
it 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
commensurate. 
One 
infers 
syllogistically 
that 
odd 
numbers 
come 
out 
equal 
to 
evens, 
and 
one 
proves 
hypothetically 
the 
incommensurability 
of 
the 
diagonal, 
since 
a 
falsehood 
results 
through 
contradicting 
this. 
For 
this 
we 
found 
to 
be 
reasoning 
per 
impossibile, 
viz. 
proving 
something 
impossible 
by 
means 
of 
an 
hypothesis 
conceded 
at 
the 
beginning. 
Consequently, 
since 
the 
falsehood 
is 
established 
in 
reductions 
ad 
impossibile 
by 
an 
ostensive 
syllogism, 
and 
the 
original 
conclusion 
is 
proved 
hypothetically, 
and 
we 
have 
already 
stated 
that 
ostensive 
syllogisms 
are 
effected 
by 
means 
of 
these 
figures, 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
syllogisms 
per 
impossibile 
also 
will 
be 
made 
through 
these 
figures. 
Likewise 
all 
the 
other 
hypothetical 
syllogisms: 
for 
in 
every 
case 
the 
syllogism 
leads 
up 
to 
the 
proposition 
that 
is 
substituted 
for 
the 
original 
thesis; 
but 
the 
original 
thesis 
is 
reached 
by 
means 
of 
a 
concession 
or 
some 
other 
hypothesis. 
But 
if 
this 
is 
true, 
every 
demonstration 
and 
every 
syllogism 
must 
be 
formed 
by 
means 
of 
the 
three 
figures 
mentioned 
above. 
But 
when 
this 
has 
been 
shown 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
every 
syllogism 
is 
perfected 
by 
means 
of 
the 
first 
figure 
and 
is 
reducible 
to 
the 
universal 
syllogisms 
in 
this 
figure. 



Further 
in 
every 
syllogism 
one 
of 
the 
premisses 
must 
be 
affirmative, 
and 
universality 
must 
be 
present: 
unless 
one 
of 
the 
premisses 
is 
universal 
either 
a 
syllogism 
will 
not 
be 
possible, 
or 
it 
will 
not 
refer 
to 
the 
subject 
proposed, 
or 
the 
original 
position 
will 
be 
begged. 
Suppose 
we 
have 
to 
prove 
that 
pleasure 
in 
music 
is 
good. 
If 
one 
should 
claim 
as 
a 
premiss 
that 
pleasure 
is 
good 
without 
adding 
‘all’, 
no 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible; 
if 
one 
should 
claim 
that 
some 
pleasure 
is 
good, 
then 
if 
it 
is 
different 
from 
pleasure 
in 
music, 
it 
is 
not 
relevant 
to 
the 
subject 
proposed; 
if 
it 
is 
this 
very 
pleasure, 
one 
is 
assuming 
that 
which 
was 
proposed 
at 
the 
outset 
to 
be 
proved. 
This 
is 
more 
obvious 
in 
geometrical 
proofs, 
e.g. 
that 
the 
angles 
at 
the 
base 
of 
an 
isosceles 
triangle 
are 
equal. 
Suppose 
the 
lines 
A 
and 
B 
have 
been 
drawn 
to 
the 
centre. 
If 
then 
one 
should 
assume 
that 
the 
angle 
AC 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
angle 
BD, 
without 
claiming 
generally 
that 
angles 
of 
semicircles 
are 
equal; 
and 
again 
if 
one 
should 
assume 
that 
the 
angle 
C 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
angle 
D, 
without 
the 
additional 
assumption 
that 
every 
angle 
of 
a 
segment 
is 
equal 
to 
every 
other 
angle 
of 
the 
same 
segment; 
and 
further 
if 
one 
should 
assume 
that 
when 
equal 
angles 
are 
taken 
from 
the 
whole 
angles, 
which 
are 
themselves 
equal, 
the 
remainders 
E 
and 
F 
are 
equal, 
he 
will 
beg 
the 
thing 
to 
be 
proved, 
unless 
he 
also 
states 
that 
when 
equals 
are 
taken 
from 
equals 
the 
remainders 
are 
equal. 


It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
in 
every 
syllogism 
there 
must 
be 
a 
universal 
premiss, 
and 
that 
a 
universal 
statement 
is 
proved 
only 
when 
all 
the 
premisses 
are 
universal, 
while 
a 
particular 
statement 
is 
proved 
both 
from 
two 
universal 
premisses 
and 
from 
one 
only: 
consequently 
if 
the 
conclusion 
is 
universal, 
the 
premisses 
also 
must 
be 
universal, 
but 
if 
the 
premisses 
are 
universal 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
conclusion 
may 
not 
be 
universal. 
And 
it 
is 
clear 
also 
that 
in 
every 
syllogism 
either 
both 
or 
one 
of 
the 
premisses 
must 
be 
like 
the 
conclusion. 
I 
mean 
not 
only 
in 
being 
affirmative 
or 
negative, 
but 
also 
in 
being 
necessary, 
pure, 
problematic. 
We 
must 
consider 
also 
the 
other 
forms 
of 
predication. 


It 
is 
clear 
also 
when 
a 
syllogism 
in 
general 
can 
be 
made 
and 
when 
it 
cannot; 
and 
when 
a 
valid, 
when 
a 
perfect 
syllogism 
can 
be 
formed; 
and 
that 
if 
a 
syllogism 
is 
formed 
the 
terms 
must 
be 
arranged 
in 
one 
of 
the 
ways 
that 
have 
been 
mentioned. 



It 
is 
clear 
too 
that 
every 
demonstration 
will 
proceed 
through 
three 
terms 
and 
no 
more, 
unless 
the 
same 
conclusion 
is 
established 
by 
different 
pairs 
of 
propositions; 
e.g. 
the 
conclusion 
E 
may 
be 
established 
through 
the 
propositions 
A 
and 
B, 
and 
through 
the 
propositions 
C 
and 
D, 
or 
through 
the 
propositions 
A 
and 
B, 
or 
A 
and 
C, 
or 
B 
and 
C. 
For 
nothing 
prevents 
there 
being 
several 
middles 
for 
the 
same 
terms. 
But 
in 
that 
case 
there 
is 
not 
one 
but 
several 
syllogisms. 
Or 
again 
when 
each 
of 
the 
propositions 
A 
and 
B 
is 
obtained 
by 
syllogistic 
inference, 
e.g. 
by 
means 
of 
D 
and 
E, 
and 
again 
B 
by 
means 
of 
F 
and 
G. 
Or 
one 
may 
be 
obtained 
by 
syllogistic, 
the 
other 
by 
inductive 
inference. 
But 
thus 
also 
the 
syllogisms 
are 
many; 
for 
the 
conclusions 
are 
many, 
e.g. 
A 
and 
B 
and 
C. 
But 
if 
this 
can 
be 
called 
one 
syllogism, 
not 
many, 
the 
same 
conclusion 
may 
be 
reached 
by 
more 
than 
three 
terms 
in 
this 
way, 
but 
it 
cannot 
be 
reached 
as 
C 
is 
established 
by 
means 
of 
A 
and 
B. 
Suppose 
that 
the 
proposition 
E 
is 
inferred 
from 
the 
premisses 
A, 
B, 
C, 
and 
D. 
It 
is 
necessary 
then 
that 
of 
these 
one 
should 
be 
related 
to 
another 
as 
whole 
to 
part: 
for 
it 
has 
already 
been 
proved 
that 
if 
a 
syllogism 
is 
formed 
some 
of 
its 
terms 
must 
be 
related 
in 
this 
way. 
Suppose 
then 
that 
A 
stands 
in 
this 
relation 
to 
B. 
Some 
conclusion 
then 
follows 
from 
them. 
It 
must 
either 
be 
E 
or 
one 
or 
other 
of 
C 
and 
D, 
or 
something 
other 
than 
these. 


(1) 
If 
it 
is 
E 
the 
syllogism 
will 
have 
A 
and 
B 
for 
its 
sole 
premisses. 
But 
if 
C 
and 
D 
are 
so 
related 
that 
one 
is 
whole, 
the 
other 
part, 
some 
conclusion 
will 
follow 
from 
them 
also; 
and 
it 
must 
be 
either 
E, 
or 
one 
or 
other 
of 
the 
propositions 
A 
and 
B, 
or 
something 
other 
than 
these. 
And 
if 
it 
is 
(i) 
E, 
or 
(ii) 
A 
or 
B, 
either 
(i) 
the 
syllogisms 
will 
be 
more 
than 
one, 
or 
(ii) 
the 
same 
thing 
happens 
to 
be 
inferred 
by 
means 
of 
several 
terms 
only 
in 
the 
sense 
which 
we 
saw 
to 
be 
possible. 
But 
if 
(iii) 
the 
conclusion 
is 
other 
than 
E 
or 
A 
or 
B, 
the 
syllogisms 
will 
be 
many, 
and 
unconnected 
with 
one 
another. 
But 
if 
C 
is 
not 
so 
related 
to 
D 
as 
to 
make 
a 
syllogism, 
the 
propositions 
will 
have 
been 
assumed 
to 
no 
purpose, 
unless 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
induction 
or 
of 
obscuring 
the 
argument 
or 
something 
of 
the 
sort. 
(2) 
But 
if 
from 
the 
propositions 
A 
and 
B 
there 
follows 
not 
E 
but 
some 
other 
conclusion, 
and 
if 
from 
C 
and 
D 
either 
A 
or 
B 
follows 
or 
something 
else, 
then 
there 
are 
several 
syllogisms, 
and 
they 
do 
not 
establish 
the 
conclusion 
proposed: 
for 
we 
assumed 
that 
the 
syllogism 
proved 
E. 
And 
if 
no 
conclusion 
follows 
from 
C 
and 
D, 
it 
turns 
out 
that 
these 
propositions 
have 
been 
assumed 
to 
no 
purpose, 
and 
the 
syllogism 
does 
not 
prove 
the 
original 
proposition. 

So 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
every 
demonstration 
and 
every 
syllogism 
will 
proceed 
through 
three 
terms 
only. 


This 
being 
evident, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
a 
syllogistic 
conclusion 
follows 
from 
two 
premisses 
and 
not 
from 
more 
than 
two. 
For 
the 
three 
terms 
make 
two 
premisses, 
unless 
a 
new 
premiss 
is 
assumed, 
as 
was 
said 
at 
the 
beginning, 
to 
perfect 
the 
syllogisms. 
It 
is 
clear 
therefore 
that 
in 
whatever 
syllogistic 
argument 
the 
premisses 
through 
which 
the 
main 
conclusion 
follows 
(for 
some 
of 
the 
preceding 
conclusions 
must 
be 
premisses) 
are 
not 
even 
in 
number, 
this 
argument 
either 
has 
not 
been 
drawn 
syllogistically 
or 
it 
has 
assumed 
more 
than 
was 
necessary 
to 
establish 
its 
thesis. 


If 
then 
syllogisms 
are 
taken 
with 
respect 
to 
their 
main 
premisses, 
every 
syllogism 
will 
consist 
of 
an 
even 
number 
of 
premisses 
and 
an 
odd 
number 
of 
terms 
(for 
the 
terms 
exceed 
the 
premisses 
by 
one), 
and 
the 
conclusions 
will 
be 
half 
the 
number 
of 
the 
premisses. 
But 
whenever 
a 
conclusion 
is 
reached 
by 
means 
of 
prosyllogisms 
or 
by 
means 
of 
several 
continuous 
middle 
terms, 
e.g. 
the 
proposition 
AB 
by 
means 
of 
the 
middle 
terms 
C 
and 
D, 
the 
number 
of 
the 
terms 
will 
similarly 
exceed 
that 
of 
the 
premisses 
by 
one 
(for 
the 
extra 
term 
must 
either 
be 
added 
outside 
or 
inserted: 
but 
in 
either 
case 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
relations 
of 
predication 
are 
one 
fewer 
than 
the 
terms 
related), 
and 
the 
premisses 
will 
be 
equal 
in 
number 
to 
the 
relations 
of 
predication. 
The 
premisses 
however 
will 
not 
always 
be 
even, 
the 
terms 
odd; 
but 
they 
will 
alternate-when 
the 
premisses 
are 
even, 
the 
terms 
must 
be 
odd; 
when 
the 
terms 
are 
even, 
the 
premisses 
must 
be 
odd: 
for 
along 
with 
one 
term 
one 
premiss 
is 
added, 
if 
a 
term 
is 
added 
from 
any 
quarter. 
Consequently 
since 
the 
premisses 
were 
(as 
we 
saw) 
even, 
and 
the 
terms 
odd, 
we 
must 
make 
them 
alternately 
even 
and 
odd 
at 
each 
addition. 
But 
the 
conclusions 
will 
not 
follow 
the 
same 
arrangement 
either 
in 
respect 
to 
the 
terms 
or 
to 
the 
premisses. 
For 
if 
one 
term 
is 
added, 
conclusions 
will 
be 
added 
less 
by 
one 
than 
the 
pre-existing 
terms: 
for 
the 
conclusion 
is 
drawn 
not 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
single 
term 
last 
added, 
but 
in 
relation 
to 
all 
the 
rest, 
e.g. 
if 
to 
ABC 
the 
term 
D 
is 
added, 
two 
conclusions 
are 
thereby 
added, 
one 
in 
relation 
to 
A, 
the 
other 
in 
relation 
to 
B. 
Similarly 
with 
any 
further 
additions. 
And 
similarly 
too 
if 
the 
term 
is 
inserted 
in 
the 
middle: 
for 
in 
relation 
to 
one 
term 
only, 
a 
syllogism 
will 
not 
be 
constructed. 
Consequently 
the 
conclusions 
will 
be 
much 
more 
numerous 
than 
the 
terms 
or 
the 
premisses. 



Since 
we 
understand 
the 
subjects 
with 
which 
syllogisms 
are 
concerned, 
what 
sort 
of 
conclusion 
is 
established 
in 
each 
figure, 
and 
in 
how 
many 
moods 
this 
is 
done, 
it 
is 
evident 
to 
us 
both 
what 
sort 
of 
problem 
is 
difficult 
and 
what 
sort 
is 
easy 
to 
prove. 
For 
that 
which 
is 
concluded 
in 
many 
figures 
and 
through 
many 
moods 
is 
easier; 
that 
which 
is 
concluded 
in 
few 
figures 
and 
through 
few 
moods 
is 
more 
difficult 
to 
attempt. 
The 
universal 
affirmative 
is 
proved 
by 
means 
of 
the 
first 
figure 
only 
and 
by 
this 
in 
only 
one 
mood; 
the 
universal 
negative 
is 
proved 
both 
through 
the 
first 
figure 
and 
through 
the 
second, 
through 
the 
first 
in 
one 
mood, 
through 
the 
second 
in 
two. 
The 
particular 
affirmative 
is 
proved 
through 
the 
first 
and 
through 
the 
last 
figure, 
in 
one 
mood 
through 
the 
first, 
in 
three 
moods 
through 
the 
last. 
The 
particular 
negative 
is 
proved 
in 
all 
the 
figures, 
but 
once 
in 
the 
first, 
in 
two 
moods 
in 
the 
second, 
in 
three 
moods 
in 
the 
third. 
It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
the 
universal 
affirmative 
is 
most 
difficult 
to 
establish, 
most 
easy 
to 
overthrow. 
In 
general, 
universals 
are 
easier 
game 
for 
the 
destroyer 
than 
particulars: 
for 
whether 
the 
predicate 
belongs 
to 
none 
or 
not 
to 
some, 
they 
are 
destroyed: 
and 
the 
particular 
negative 
is 
proved 
in 
all 
the 
figures, 
the 
universal 
negative 
in 
two. 
Similarly 
with 
universal 
negatives: 
the 
original 
statement 
is 
destroyed, 
whether 
the 
predicate 
belongs 
to 
all 
or 
to 
some: 
and 
this 
we 
found 
possible 
in 
two 
figures. 
But 
particular 
statements 
can 
be 
refuted 
in 
one 
way 
only-by 
proving 
that 
the 
predicate 
belongs 
either 
to 
all 
or 
to 
none. 
But 
particular 
statements 
are 
easier 
to 
establish: 
for 
proof 
is 
possible 
in 
more 
figures 
and 
through 
more 
moods. 
And 
in 
general 
we 
must 
not 
forget 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
refute 
statements 
by 
means 
of 
one 
another, 
I 
mean, 
universal 
statements 
by 
means 
of 
particular, 
and 
particular 
statements 
by 
means 
of 
universal: 
but 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
establish 
universal 
statements 
by 
means 
of 
particular, 
though 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
establish 
particular 
statements 
by 
means 
of 
universal. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
it 
is 
easier 
to 
refute 
than 
to 
establish. 


The 
manner 
in 
which 
every 
syllogism 
is 
produced, 
the 
number 
of 
the 
terms 
and 
premisses 
through 
which 
it 
proceeds, 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
premisses 
to 
one 
another, 
the 
character 
of 
the 
problem 
proved 
in 
each 
figure, 
and 
the 
number 
of 
the 
figures 
appropriate 
to 
each 
problem, 
all 
these 
matters 
are 
clear 
from 
what 
has 
been 
said. 


We 
must 
now 
state 
how 
we 
may 
ourselves 
always 
have 
a 
supply 
of 



syllogisms 
in 
reference 
to 
the 
problem 
proposed 
and 
by 
what 
road 
we 
may 
reach 
the 
principles 
relative 
to 
the 
problem: 
for 
perhaps 
we 
ought 
not 
only 
to 
investigate 
the 
construction 
of 
syllogisms, 
but 
also 
to 
have 
the 
power 
of 
making 
them. 


Of 
all 
the 
things 
which 
exist 
some 
are 
such 
that 
they 
cannot 
be 
predicated 
of 
anything 
else 
truly 
and 
universally, 
e.g. 
Cleon 
and 
Callias, 
i.e. 
the 
individual 
and 
sensible, 
but 
other 
things 
may 
be 
predicated 
of 
them 
(for 
each 
of 
these 
is 
both 
man 
and 
animal); 
and 
some 
things 
are 
themselves 
predicated 
of 
others, 
but 
nothing 
prior 
is 
predicated 
of 
them; 
and 
some 
are 
predicated 
of 
others, 
and 
yet 
others 
of 
them, 
e.g. 
man 
of 
Callias 
and 
animal 
of 
man. 
It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
some 
things 
are 
naturally 
not 
stated 
of 
anything: 
for 
as 
a 
rule 
each 
sensible 
thing 
is 
such 
that 
it 
cannot 
be 
predicated 
of 
anything, 
save 
incidentally: 
for 
we 
sometimes 
say 
that 
that 
white 
object 
is 
Socrates, 
or 
that 
that 
which 
approaches 
is 
Callias. 
We 
shall 
explain 
in 
another 
place 
that 
there 
is 
an 
upward 
limit 
also 
to 
the 
process 
of 
predicating: 
for 
the 
present 
we 
must 
assume 
this. 
Of 
these 
ultimate 
predicates 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
demonstrate 
another 
predicate, 
save 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
opinion, 
but 
these 
may 
be 
predicated 
of 
other 
things. 
Neither 
can 
individuals 
be 
predicated 
of 
other 
things, 
though 
other 
things 
can 
be 
predicated 
of 
them. 
Whatever 
lies 
between 
these 
limits 
can 
be 
spoken 
of 
in 
both 
ways: 
they 
may 
be 
stated 
of 
others, 
and 
others 
stated 
of 
them. 
And 
as 
a 
rule 
arguments 
and 
inquiries 
are 
concerned 
with 
these 
things. 
We 
must 
select 
the 
premisses 
suitable 
to 
each 
problem 
in 
this 
manner: 
first 
we 
must 
lay 
down 
the 
subject 
and 
the 
definitions 
and 
the 
properties 
of 
the 
thing; 
next 
we 
must 
lay 
down 
those 
attributes 
which 
follow 
the 
thing, 
and 
again 
those 
which 
the 
thing 
follows, 
and 
those 
which 
cannot 
belong 
to 
it. 
But 
those 
to 
which 
it 
cannot 
belong 
need 
not 
be 
selected, 
because 
the 
negative 
statement 
implied 
above 
is 
convertible. 
Of 
the 
attributes 
which 
follow 
we 
must 
distinguish 
those 
which 
fall 
within 
the 
definition, 
those 
which 
are 
predicated 
as 
properties, 
and 
those 
which 
are 
predicated 
as 
accidents, 
and 
of 
the 
latter 
those 
which 
apparently 
and 
those 
which 
really 
belong. 
The 
larger 
the 
supply 
a 
man 
has 
of 
these, 
the 
more 
quickly 
will 
he 
reach 
a 
conclusion; 
and 
in 
proportion 
as 
he 
apprehends 
those 
which 
are 
truer, 
the 
more 
cogently 
will 
he 
demonstrate. 
But 
he 
must 
select 
not 
those 
which 
follow 
some 
particular 
but 
those 
which 
follow 
the 
thing 
as 
a 
whole, 
e.g. 
not 
what 
follows 
a 
particular 
man 
but 
what 
follows 
every 
man: 
for 
the 
syllogism 
proceeds 
through 
universal 
premisses. 
If 
the 
statement 
is 
indefinite, 
it 
is 
uncertain 
whether 
the 
premiss 
is 
universal, 
but 
if 
the 
statement 
is 
definite, 
the 
matter 
is 



clear. 
Similarly 
one 
must 
select 
those 
attributes 
which 
the 
subject 
follows 
as 
wholes, 
for 
the 
reason 
given. 
But 
that 
which 
follows 
one 
must 
not 
suppose 
to 
follow 
as 
a 
whole, 
e.g. 
that 
every 
animal 
follows 
man 
or 
every 
science 
music, 
but 
only 
that 
it 
follows, 
without 
qualification, 
and 
indeed 
we 
state 
it 
in 
a 
proposition: 
for 
the 
other 
statement 
is 
useless 
and 
impossible, 
e.g. 
that 
every 
man 
is 
every 
animal 
or 
justice 
is 
all 
good. 
But 
that 
which 
something 
follows 
receives 
the 
mark 
‘every’. 
Whenever 
the 
subject, 
for 
which 
we 
must 
obtain 
the 
attributes 
that 
follow, 
is 
contained 
by 
something 
else, 
what 
follows 
or 
does 
not 
follow 
the 
highest 
term 
universally 
must 
not 
be 
selected 
in 
dealing 
with 
the 
subordinate 
term 
(for 
these 
attributes 
have 
been 
taken 
in 
dealing 
with 
the 
superior 
term; 
for 
what 
follows 
animal 
also 
follows 
man, 
and 
what 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
animal 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
man); 
but 
we 
must 
choose 
those 
attributes 
which 
are 
peculiar 
to 
each 
subject. 
For 
some 
things 
are 
peculiar 
to 
the 
species 
as 
distinct 
from 
the 
genus; 
for 
species 
being 
distinct 
there 
must 
be 
attributes 
peculiar 
to 
each. 
Nor 
must 
we 
take 
as 
things 
which 
the 
superior 
term 
follows, 
those 
things 
which 
the 
inferior 
term 
follows, 
e.g. 
take 
as 
subjects 
of 
the 
predicate 
‘animal’ 
what 
are 
really 
subjects 
of 
the 
predicate 
‘man’. 
It 
is 
necessary 
indeed, 
if 
animal 
follows 
man, 
that 
it 
should 
follow 
all 
these 
also. 
But 
these 
belong 
more 
properly 
to 
the 
choice 
of 
what 
concerns 
man. 
One 
must 
apprehend 
also 
normal 
consequents 
and 
normal 
antecedents-, 
for 
propositions 
which 
obtain 
normally 
are 
established 
syllogistically 
from 
premisses 
which 
obtain 
normally, 
some 
if 
not 
all 
of 
them 
having 
this 
character 
of 
normality. 
For 
the 
conclusion 
of 
each 
syllogism 
resembles 
its 
principles. 
We 
must 
not 
however 
choose 
attributes 
which 
are 
consequent 
upon 
all 
the 
terms: 
for 
no 
syllogism 
can 
be 
made 
out 
of 
such 
premisses. 
The 
reason 
why 
this 
is 
so 
will 
be 
clear 
in 
the 
sequel. 


If 
men 
wish 
to 
establish 
something 
about 
some 
whole, 
they 
must 
look 
to 
the 
subjects 
of 
that 
which 
is 
being 
established 
(the 
subjects 
of 
which 
it 
happens 
to 
be 
asserted), 
and 
the 
attributes 
which 
follow 
that 
of 
which 
it 
is 
to 
be 
predicated. 
For 
if 
any 
of 
these 
subjects 
is 
the 
same 
as 
any 
of 
these 
attributes, 
the 
attribute 
originally 
in 
question 
must 
belong 
to 
the 
subject 
originally 
in 
question. 
But 
if 
the 
purpose 
is 
to 
establish 
not 
a 
universal 
but 
a 
particular 
proposition, 
they 
must 
look 
for 
the 
terms 
of 
which 
the 
terms 
in 
question 
are 
predicable: 
for 
if 
any 
of 
these 
are 
identical, 
the 
attribute 
in 



question 
must 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
the 
subject 
in 
question. 
Whenever 
the 
one 
term 
has 
to 
belong 
to 
none 
of 
the 
other, 
one 
must 
look 
to 
the 
consequents 
of 
the 
subject, 
and 
to 
those 
attributes 
which 
cannot 
possibly 
be 
present 
in 
the 
predicate 
in 
question: 
or 
conversely 
to 
the 
attributes 
which 
cannot 
possibly 
be 
present 
in 
the 
subject, 
and 
to 
the 
consequents 
of 
the 
predicate. 
If 
any 
members 
of 
these 
groups 
are 
identical, 
one 
of 
the 
terms 
in 
question 
cannot 
possibly 
belong 
to 
any 
of 
the 
other. 
For 
sometimes 
a 
syllogism 
in 
the 
first 
figure 
results, 
sometimes 
a 
syllogism 
in 
the 
second. 
But 
if 
the 
object 
is 
to 
establish 
a 
particular 
negative 
proposition, 
we 
must 
find 
antecedents 
of 
the 
subject 
in 
question 
and 
attributes 
which 
cannot 
possibly 
belong 
to 
the 
predicate 
in 
question. 
If 
any 
members 
of 
these 
two 
groups 
are 
identical, 
it 
follows 
that 
one 
of 
the 
terms 
in 
question 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
the 
other. 
Perhaps 
each 
of 
these 
statements 
will 
become 
clearer 
in 
the 
following 
way. 
Suppose 
the 
consequents 
of 
A 
are 
designated 
by 
B, 
the 
antecedents 
of 
A 
by 
C, 
attributes 
which 
cannot 
possibly 
belong 
to 
A 
by 
D. 
Suppose 
again 
that 
the 
attributes 
of 
E 
are 
designated 
by 
F, 
the 
antecedents 
of 
E 
by 
G, 
and 
attributes 
which 
cannot 
belong 
to 
E 
by 
H. 
If 
then 
one 
of 
the 
Cs 
should 
be 
identical 
with 
one 
of 
the 
Fs, 
A 
must 
belong 
to 
all 
E: 
for 
F 
belongs 
to 
all 
E, 
and 
A 
to 
all 
C, 
consequently 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
E. 
If 
C 
and 
G 
are 
identical, 
A 
must 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
the 
Es: 
for 
A 
follows 
C, 
and 
E 
follows 
all 
G. 
If 
F 
and 
D 
are 
identical, 
A 
will 
belong 
to 
none 
of 
the 
Es 
by 
a 
prosyllogism: 
for 
since 
the 
negative 
proposition 
is 
convertible, 
and 
F 
is 
identical 
with 
D, 
A 
will 
belong 
to 
none 
of 
the 
Fs, 
but 
F 
belongs 
to 
all 
E. 
Again, 
if 
B 
and 
H 
are 
identical, 
A 
will 
belong 
to 
none 
of 
the 
Es: 
for 
B 
will 
belong 
to 
all 
A, 
but 
to 
no 


E: 
for 
it 
was 
assumed 
to 
be 
identical 
with 
H, 
and 
H 
belonged 
to 
none 
of 
the 
Es. 
If 
D 
and 
G 
are 
identical, 
A 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
the 
Es: 
for 
it 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
G, 
because 
it 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
D: 
but 
G 
falls 
under 
E: 
consequently 
A 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
the 
Es. 
If 
B 
is 
identical 
with 
G, 
there 
will 
be 
a 
converted 
syllogism: 
for 
E 
will 
belong 
to 
all 
A 
since 
B 
belongs 
to 
A 
and 
E 
to 
B 
(for 
B 
was 
found 
to 
be 
identical 
with 
G): 
but 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
all 
E 
is 
not 
necessary, 
but 
it 
must 
belong 
to 
some 
E 
because 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
convert 
the 
universal 
statement 
into 
a 
particular. 
It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
in 
every 
proposition 
which 
requires 
proof 
we 
must 
look 
to 
the 
aforesaid 
relations 
of 
the 
subject 
and 
predicate 
in 
question: 
for 
all 
syllogisms 
proceed 
through 
these. 
But 
if 
we 
are 
seeking 
consequents 
and 
antecedents 
we 
must 
look 
for 
those 
which 
are 
primary 
and 
most 
universal, 


e.g. 
in 
reference 
to 
E 
we 
must 
look 
to 
KF 
rather 
than 
to 
F 
alone, 
and 
in 

reference 
to 
A 
we 
must 
look 
to 
KC 
rather 
than 
to 
C 
alone. 
For 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
KF, 
it 
belongs 
both 
to 
F 
and 
to 
E: 
but 
if 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
KF, 
it 
may 
yet 
follow 
F. 
Similarly 
we 
must 
consider 
the 
antecedents 
of 
A 
itself: 
for 
if 
a 
term 
follows 
the 
primary 
antecedents, 
it 
will 
follow 
those 
also 
which 
are 
subordinate, 
but 
if 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
the 
former, 
it 
may 
yet 
follow 
the 
latter. 


It 
is 
clear 
too 
that 
the 
inquiry 
proceeds 
through 
the 
three 
terms 
and 
the 
two 
premisses, 
and 
that 
all 
the 
syllogisms 
proceed 
through 
the 
aforesaid 
figures. 
For 
it 
is 
proved 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
E, 
whenever 
an 
identical 
term 
is 
found 
among 
the 
Cs 
and 
Fs. 
This 
will 
be 
the 
middle 
term; 
A 
and 
E 
will 
be 
the 
extremes. 
So 
the 
first 
figure 
is 
formed. 
And 
A 
will 
belong 
to 
some 
E, 
whenever 
C 
and 
G 
are 
apprehended 
to 
be 
the 
same. 
This 
is 
the 
last 
figure: 
for 
G 
becomes 
the 
middle 
term. 
And 
A 
will 
belong 
to 
no 
E, 
when 
D 
and 
F 
are 
identical. 
Thus 
we 
have 
both 
the 
first 
figure 
and 
the 
middle 
figure; 
the 
first, 
because 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
F, 
since 
the 
negative 
statement 
is 
convertible, 
and 
F 
belongs 
to 
all 
E: 
the 
middle 
figure 
because 
D 
belongs 
to 
no 
A, 
and 
to 
all 
E. 
And 
A 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
E, 
whenever 
D 
and 
G 
are 
identical. 
This 
is 
the 
last 
figure: 
for 
A 
will 
belong 
to 
no 
G, 
and 
E 
will 
belong 
to 
all 
G. 
Clearly 
then 
all 
syllogisms 
proceed 
through 
the 
aforesaid 
figures, 
and 
we 
must 
not 
select 
consequents 
of 
all 
the 
terms, 
because 
no 
syllogism 
is 
produced 
from 
them. 
For 
(as 
we 
saw) 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
at 
all 
to 
establish 
a 
proposition 
from 
consequents, 
and 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
refute 
by 
means 
of 
a 
consequent 
of 
both 
the 
terms 
in 
question: 
for 
the 
middle 
term 
must 
belong 
to 
the 
one, 
and 
not 
belong 
to 
the 
other. 


It 
is 
clear 
too 
that 
other 
methods 
of 
inquiry 
by 
selection 
of 
middle 
terms 
are 
useless 
to 
produce 
a 
syllogism, 
e.g. 
if 
the 
consequents 
of 
the 
terms 
in 
question 
are 
identical, 
or 
if 
the 
antecedents 
of 
A 
are 
identical 
with 
those 
attributes 
which 
cannot 
possibly 
belong 
to 
E, 
or 
if 
those 
attributes 
are 
identical 
which 
cannot 
belong 
to 
either 
term: 
for 
no 
syllogism 
is 
produced 
by 
means 
of 
these. 
For 
if 
the 
consequents 
are 
identical, 
e.g. 
B 
and 
F, 
we 
have 
the 
middle 
figure 
with 
both 
premisses 
affirmative: 
if 
the 
antecedents 
of 
A 
are 
identical 
with 
attributes 
which 
cannot 
belong 
to 
E, 
e.g. 
C 
with 
H, 
we 
have 
the 
first 
figure 
with 
its 
minor 
premiss 
negative. 
If 
attributes 
which 
cannot 
belong 
to 
either 
term 
are 
identical, 
e.g. 
C 
and 
H, 
both 
premisses 
are 
negative, 
either 
in 
the 
first 
or 
in 
the 
middle 
figure. 
But 
no 
syllogism 
is 
possible 
in 
this 
way. 


It 
is 
evident 
too 
that 
we 
must 
find 
out 
which 
terms 
in 
this 
inquiry 
are 
identical, 
not 
which 
are 
different 
or 
contrary, 
first 
because 
the 
object 
of 
our 
investigation 
is 
the 
middle 
term, 
and 
the 
middle 
term 
must 
be 
not 
diverse 
but 



identical. 
Secondly, 
wherever 
it 
happens 
that 
a 
syllogism 
results 
from 
taking 
contraries 
or 
terms 
which 
cannot 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
thing, 
all 
arguments 
can 
be 
reduced 
to 
the 
aforesaid 
moods, 
e.g. 
if 
B 
and 
F 
are 
contraries 
or 
cannot 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
thing. 
For 
if 
these 
are 
taken, 
a 
syllogism 
will 
be 
formed 
to 
prove 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
none 
of 
the 
Es, 
not 
however 
from 
the 
premisses 
taken 
but 
in 
the 
aforesaid 
mood. 
For 
B 
will 
belong 
to 
all 
A 
and 
to 
no 
E. 
Consequently 
B 
must 
be 
identical 
with 
one 
of 
the 
Hs. 
Again, 
if 
B 
and 
G 
cannot 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
thing, 
it 
follows 
that 
A 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
the 
Es: 
for 
then 
too 
we 
shall 
have 
the 
middle 
figure: 
for 
B 
will 
belong 
to 
all 
A 
and 
to 
no 
G. 
Consequently 
B 
must 
be 
identical 
with 
some 
of 
the 
Hs. 
For 
the 
fact 
that 
B 
and 
G 
cannot 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
thing 
differs 
in 
no 
way 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
B 
is 
identical 
with 
some 
of 
the 
Hs: 
for 
that 
includes 
everything 
which 
cannot 
belong 
to 
E. 


It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
from 
the 
inquiries 
taken 
by 
themselves 
no 
syllogism 
results; 
but 
if 
B 
and 
F 
are 
contraries 
B 
must 
be 
identical 
with 
one 
of 
the 
Hs, 
and 
the 
syllogism 
results 
through 
these 
terms. 
It 
turns 
out 
then 
that 
those 
who 
inquire 
in 
this 
manner 
are 
looking 
gratuitously 
for 
some 
other 
way 
than 
the 
necessary 
way 
because 
they 
have 
failed 
to 
observe 
the 
identity 
of 
the 
Bs 
with 
the 
Hs. 


Syllogisms 
which 
lead 
to 
impossible 
conclusions 
are 
similar 
to 
ostensive 
syllogisms; 
they 
also 
are 
formed 
by 
means 
of 
the 
consequents 
and 
antecedents 
of 
the 
terms 
in 
question. 
In 
both 
cases 
the 
same 
inquiry 
is 
involved. 
For 
what 
is 
proved 
ostensively 
may 
also 
be 
concluded 
syllogistically 
per 
impossibile 
by 
means 
of 
the 
same 
terms; 
and 
what 
is 
proved 
per 
impossibile 
may 
also 
be 
proved 
ostensively, 
e.g. 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
none 
of 
the 
Es. 
For 
suppose 
A 
to 
belong 
to 
some 
E: 
then 
since 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
A 
and 
A 
to 
some 
of 
the 
Es, 
B 
will 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
the 
Es: 
but 
it 
was 
assumed 
that 
it 
belongs 
to 
none. 
Again 
we 
may 
prove 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 


E: 
for 
if 
A 
belonged 
to 
none 
of 
the 
Es, 
and 
E 
belongs 
to 
all 
G, 
A 
will 
belong 
to 
none 
of 
the 
Gs: 
but 
it 
was 
assumed 
to 
belong 
to 
all. 
Similarly 
with 
the 
other 
propositions 
requiring 
proof. 
The 
proof 
per 
impossibile 
will 
always 
and 
in 
all 
cases 
be 
from 
the 
consequents 
and 
antecedents 
of 
the 
terms 
in 
question. 
Whatever 
the 
problem 
the 
same 
inquiry 
is 
necessary 
whether 
one 
wishes 
to 
use 
an 
ostensive 
syllogism 
or 
a 
reduction 
to 
impossibility. 
For 
both 
the 

demonstrations 
start 
from 
the 
same 
terms, 
e.g. 
suppose 
it 
has 
been 
proved 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
E, 
because 
it 
turns 
out 
that 
otherwise 
B 
belongs 
to 
some 
of 
the 
Es 
and 
this 
is 
impossible-if 
now 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
no 
E 
and 
to 
all 
A, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
A 
will 
belong 
to 
no 
E. 
Again 
if 
it 
has 
been 
proved 
by 
an 
ostensive 
syllogism 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
E, 
assume 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
E 
and 
it 
will 
be 
proved 
per 
impossibile 
to 
belong 
to 
no 
E. 
Similarly 
with 
the 
rest. 
In 
all 
cases 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
find 
some 
common 
term 
other 
than 
the 
subjects 
of 
inquiry, 
to 
which 
the 
syllogism 
establishing 
the 
false 
conclusion 
may 
relate, 
so 
that 
if 
this 
premiss 
is 
converted, 
and 
the 
other 
remains 
as 
it 
is, 
the 
syllogism 
will 
be 
ostensive 
by 
means 
of 
the 
same 
terms. 
For 
the 
ostensive 
syllogism 
differs 
from 
the 
reductio 
ad 
impossibile 
in 
this: 
in 
the 
ostensive 
syllogism 
both 
remisses 
are 
laid 
down 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
truth, 
in 
the 
reductio 
ad 
impossibile 
one 
of 
the 
premisses 
is 
assumed 
falsely. 


These 
points 
will 
be 
made 
clearer 
by 
the 
sequel, 
when 
we 
discuss 
the 
reduction 
to 
impossibility: 
at 
present 
this 
much 
must 
be 
clear, 
that 
we 
must 
look 
to 
terms 
of 
the 
kinds 
mentioned 
whether 
we 
wish 
to 
use 
an 
ostensive 
syllogism 
or 
a 
reduction 
to 
impossibility. 
In 
the 
other 
hypothetical 
syllogisms, 
I 
mean 
those 
which 
proceed 
by 
substitution, 
or 
by 
positing 
a 
certain 
quality, 
the 
inquiry 
will 
be 
directed 
to 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
problem 
to 
be 
proved-not 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
original 
problem, 
but 
the 
new 
terms 
introduced; 
and 
the 
method 
of 
the 
inquiry 
will 
be 
the 
same 
as 
before. 
But 
we 
must 
consider 
and 
determine 
in 
how 
many 
ways 
hypothetical 
syllogisms 
are 
possible. 


Each 
of 
the 
problems 
then 
can 
be 
proved 
in 
the 
manner 
described; 
but 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
establish 
some 
of 
them 
syllogistically 
in 
another 
way, 
e.g. 
universal 
problems 
by 
the 
inquiry 
which 
leads 
up 
to 
a 
particular 
conclusion, 
with 
the 
addition 
of 
an 
hypothesis. 
For 
if 
the 
Cs 
and 
the 
Gs 
should 
be 
identical, 
but 
E 
should 
be 
assumed 
to 
belong 
to 
the 
Gs 
only, 
then 
A 
would 
belong 
to 
every 
E: 
and 
again 
if 
the 
Ds 
and 
the 
Gs 
should 
be 
identical, 
but 
E 
should 
be 
predicated 
of 
the 
Gs 
only, 
it 
follows 
that 
A 
will 
belong 
to 
none 
of 
the 
Es. 
Clearly 
then 
we 
must 
consider 
the 
matter 
in 
this 
way 
also. 
The 
method 
is 
the 
same 
whether 
the 
relation 
is 
necessary 
or 
possible. 
For 
the 
inquiry 
will 
be 
the 
same, 
and 
the 
syllogism 
will 
proceed 
through 
terms 
arranged 
in 
the 
same 
order 
whether 
a 
possible 
or 
a 
pure 
proposition 
is 
proved. 
We 
must 
find 
in 
the 
case 
of 
possible 
relations, 
as 
well 
as 
terms 
that 
belong, 
terms 
which 
can 
belong 
though 
they 
actually 
do 
not: 
for 
we 
have 
proved 
that 
the 
syllogism 
which 
establishes 
a 
possible 
relation 
proceeds 
through 
these 



terms 
as 
well. 
Similarly 
also 
with 
the 
other 
modes 
of 
predication. 


It 
is 
clear 
then 
from 
what 
has 
been 
said 
not 
only 
that 
all 
syllogisms 
can 
be 
formed 
in 
this 
way, 
but 
also 
that 
they 
cannot 
be 
formed 
in 
any 
other. 
For 
every 
syllogism 
has 
been 
proved 
to 
be 
formed 
through 
one 
of 
the 
aforementioned 
figures, 
and 
these 
cannot 
be 
composed 
through 
other 
terms 
than 
the 
consequents 
and 
antecedents 
of 
the 
terms 
in 
question: 
for 
from 
these 
we 
obtain 
the 
premisses 
and 
find 
the 
middle 
term. 
Consequently 
a 
syllogism 
cannot 
be 
formed 
by 
means 
of 
other 
terms. 


The 
method 
is 
the 
same 
in 
all 
cases, 
in 
philosophy, 
in 
any 
art 
or 
study. 
We 
must 
look 
for 
the 
attributes 
and 
the 
subjects 
of 
both 
our 
terms, 
and 
we 
must 
supply 
ourselves 
with 
as 
many 
of 
these 
as 
possible, 
and 
consider 
them 
by 
means 
of 
the 
three 
terms, 
refuting 
statements 
in 
one 
way, 
confirming 
them 
in 
another, 
in 
the 
pursuit 
of 
truth 
starting 
from 
premisses 
in 
which 
the 
arrangement 
of 
the 
terms 
is 
in 
accordance 
with 
truth, 
while 
if 
we 
look 
for 
dialectical 
syllogisms 
we 
must 
start 
from 
probable 
premisses. 
The 
principles 
of 
syllogisms 
have 
been 
stated 
in 
general 
terms, 
both 
how 
they 
are 
characterized 
and 
how 
we 
must 
hunt 
for 
them, 
so 
as 
not 
to 
look 
to 
everything 
that 
is 
said 
about 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
problem 
or 
to 
the 
same 
points 
whether 
we 
are 
confirming 
or 
refuting, 
or 
again 
whether 
we 
are 
confirming 
of 
all 
or 
of 
some, 
and 
whether 
we 
are 
refuting 
of 
all 
or 
some. 
we 
must 
look 
to 
fewer 
points 
and 
they 
must 
be 
definite. 
We 
have 
also 
stated 
how 
we 
must 
select 
with 
reference 
to 
everything 
that 
is, 
e.g. 
about 
good 
or 
knowledge. 
But 
in 
each 
science 
the 
principles 
which 
are 
peculiar 
are 
the 
most 
numerous. 
Consequently 
it 
is 
the 
business 
of 
experience 
to 
give 
the 
principles 
which 
belong 
to 
each 
subject. 
I 
mean 
for 
example 
that 
astronomical 
experience 
supplies 
the 
principles 
of 
astronomical 
science: 
for 
once 
the 
phenomena 
were 
adequately 
apprehended, 
the 
demonstrations 
of 
astronomy 
were 
discovered. 
Similarly 
with 
any 
other 
art 
or 
science. 
Consequently, 
if 
the 
attributes 
of 
the 
thing 
are 
apprehended, 
our 
business 
will 
then 
be 
to 
exhibit 
readily 
the 
demonstrations. 
For 
if 
none 
of 
the 
true 
attributes 
of 
things 
had 
been 
omitted 
in 
the 
historical 
survey, 
we 
should 
be 
able 
to 
discover 
the 
proof 
and 
demonstrate 
everything 
which 
admitted 
of 
proof, 
and 
to 
make 
that 
clear, 
whose 
nature 
does 
not 
admit 
of 
proof. 


In 
general 
then 
we 
have 
explained 
fairly 
well 
how 
we 
must 
select 



premisses: 
we 
have 
discussed 
the 
matter 
accurately 
in 
the 
treatise 
concerning 
dialectic. 


It 
is 
easy 
to 
see 
that 
division 
into 
classes 
is 
a 
small 
part 
of 
the 
method 
we 
have 
described: 
for 
division 
is, 
so 
to 
speak, 
a 
weak 
syllogism; 
for 
what 
it 
ought 
to 
prove, 
it 
begs, 
and 
it 
always 
establishes 
something 
more 
general 
than 
the 
attribute 
in 
question. 
First, 
this 
very 
point 
had 
escaped 
all 
those 
who 
used 
the 
method 
of 
division; 
and 
they 
attempted 
to 
persuade 
men 
that 
it 
was 
possible 
to 
make 
a 
demonstration 
of 
substance 
and 
essence. 
Consequently 
they 
did 
not 
understand 
what 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
prove 
syllogistically 
by 
division, 
nor 
did 
they 
understand 
that 
it 
was 
possible 
to 
prove 
syllogistically 
in 
the 
manner 
we 
have 
described. 
In 
demonstrations, 
when 
there 
is 
a 
need 
to 
prove 
a 
positive 
statement, 
the 
middle 
term 
through 
which 
the 
syllogism 
is 
formed 
must 
always 
be 
inferior 
to 
and 
not 
comprehend 
the 
first 
of 
the 
extremes. 
But 
division 
has 
a 
contrary 
intention: 
for 
it 
takes 
the 
universal 
as 
middle. 
Let 
animal 
be 
the 
term 
signified 
by 
A, 
mortal 
by 
B, 
and 
immortal 
by 
C, 
and 
let 
man, 
whose 
definition 
is 
to 
be 
got, 
be 
signified 
by 
D. 
The 
man 
who 
divides 
assumes 
that 
every 
animal 
is 
either 
mortal 
or 
immortal: 
i.e. 
whatever 
is 
A 
is 
all 
either 
B 
or 
C. 
Again, 
always 
dividing, 
he 
lays 
it 
down 
that 
man 
is 
an 
animal, 
so 
he 
assumes 
A 
of 
D 
as 
belonging 
to 
it. 
Now 
the 
true 
conclusion 
is 
that 
every 
D 
is 
either 
B 
or 
C, 
consequently 
man 
must 
be 
either 
mortal 
or 
immortal, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
man 
should 
be 
a 
mortal 
animal-this 
is 
begged: 
and 
this 
is 
what 
ought 
to 
have 
been 
proved 
syllogistically. 
And 
again, 
taking 
A 
as 
mortal 
animal, 
B 
as 
footed, 
C 
as 
footless, 
and 
D 
as 
man, 
he 
assumes 
in 
the 
same 
way 
that 
A 
inheres 
either 
in 
B 
or 
in 
C 
(for 
every 
mortal 
animal 
is 
either 
footed 
or 
footless), 
and 
he 
assumes 
A 
of 
D 
(for 
he 
assumed 
man, 
as 
we 
saw, 
to 
be 
a 
mortal 
animal); 
consequently 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
man 
should 
be 
either 
a 
footed 
or 
a 
footless 
animal; 
but 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
man 
should 
be 
footed: 
this 
he 
assumes: 
and 
it 
is 
just 
this 
again 
which 
he 
ought 
to 
have 
demonstrated. 
Always 
dividing 
then 
in 
this 
way 
it 
turns 
out 
that 
these 
logicians 
assume 
as 
middle 
the 
universal 
term, 
and 
as 
extremes 
that 
which 
ought 
to 
have 
been 
the 
subject 
of 
demonstration 
and 
the 
differentiae. 
In 
conclusion, 
they 
do 
not 
make 
it 
clear, 
and 
show 
it 
to 
be 
necessary, 
that 
this 
is 
man 
or 
whatever 
the 
subject 
of 
inquiry 
may 
be: 
for 
they 
pursue 
the 
other 
method 
altogether, 
never 
even 
suspecting 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
rich 
supply 
of 



evidence 
which 
might 
be 
used. 
It 
is 
clear 
that 
it 
is 
neither 
possible 
to 
refute 
a 
statement 
by 
this 
method 
of 
division, 
nor 
to 
draw 
a 
conclusion 
about 
an 
accident 
or 
property 
of 
a 
thing, 
nor 
about 
its 
genus, 
nor 
in 
cases 
in 
which 
it 
is 
unknown 
whether 
it 
is 
thus 
or 
thus, 
e.g. 
whether 
the 
diagonal 
is 
incommensurate. 
For 
if 
he 
assumes 
that 
every 
length 
is 
either 
commensurate 
or 
incommensurate, 
and 
the 
diagonal 
is 
a 
length, 
he 
has 
proved 
that 
the 
diagonal 
is 
either 
incommensurate 
or 
commensurate. 
But 
if 
he 
should 
assume 
that 
it 
is 
incommensurate, 
he 
will 
have 
assumed 
what 
he 
ought 
to 
have 
proved. 
He 
cannot 
then 
prove 
it: 
for 
this 
is 
his 
method, 
but 
proof 
is 
not 
possible 
by 
this 
method. 
Let 
A 
stand 
for 
‘incommensurate 
or 
commensurate’, 
B 
for 
‘length’, 
C 
for 
‘diagonal’. 
It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
this 
method 
of 
investigation 
is 
not 
suitable 
for 
every 
inquiry, 
nor 
is 
it 
useful 
in 
those 
cases 
in 
which 
it 
is 
thought 
to 
be 
most 
suitable. 


From 
what 
has 
been 
said 
it 
is 
clear 
from 
what 
elements 
demonstrations 
are 
formed 
and 
in 
what 
manner, 
and 
to 
what 
points 
we 
must 
look 
in 
each 
problem. 


Our 
next 
business 
is 
to 
state 
how 
we 
can 
reduce 
syllogisms 
to 
the 
aforementioned 
figures: 
for 
this 
part 
of 
the 
inquiry 
still 
remains. 
If 
we 
should 
investigate 
the 
production 
of 
the 
syllogisms 
and 
had 
the 
power 
of 
discovering 
them, 
and 
further 
if 
we 
could 
resolve 
the 
syllogisms 
produced 
into 
the 
aforementioned 
figures, 
our 
original 
problem 
would 
be 
brought 
to 
a 
conclusion. 
It 
will 
happen 
at 
the 
same 
time 
that 
what 
has 
been 
already 
said 
will 
be 
confirmed 
and 
its 
truth 
made 
clearer 
by 
what 
we 
are 
about 
to 
say. 
For 
everything 
that 
is 
true 
must 
in 
every 
respect 
agree 
with 
itself 
First 
then 
we 
must 
attempt 
to 
select 
the 
two 
premisses 
of 
the 
syllogism 
(for 
it 
is 
easier 
to 
divide 
into 
large 
parts 
than 
into 
small, 
and 
the 
composite 
parts 
are 
larger 
than 
the 
elements 
out 
of 
which 
they 
are 
made); 
next 
we 
must 
inquire 
which 
are 
universal 
and 
which 
particular, 
and 
if 
both 
premisses 
have 
not 
been 
stated, 
we 
must 
ourselves 
assume 
the 
one 
which 
is 
missing. 
For 
sometimes 
men 
put 
forward 
the 
universal 
premiss, 
but 
do 
not 
posit 
the 
premiss 
which 
is 
contained 
in 
it, 
either 
in 
writing 
or 
in 
discussion: 
or 
men 
put 
forward 
the 
premisses 
of 
the 
principal 
syllogism, 
but 
omit 
those 
through 
which 
they 
are 
inferred, 
and 
invite 
the 
concession 
of 
others 
to 
no 
purpose. 
We 
must 
inquire 
then 
whether 
anything 
unnecessary 
has 
been 
assumed, 
or 
anything 
necessary 



has 
been 
omitted, 
and 
we 
must 
posit 
the 
one 
and 
take 
away 
the 
other, 
until 
we 
have 
reached 
the 
two 
premisses: 
for 
unless 
we 
have 
these, 
we 
cannot 
reduce 
arguments 
put 
forward 
in 
the 
way 
described. 
In 
some 
arguments 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
see 
what 
is 
wanting, 
but 
some 
escape 
us, 
and 
appear 
to 
be 
syllogisms, 
because 
something 
necessary 
results 
from 
what 
has 
been 
laid 
down, 
e.g. 
if 
the 
assumptions 
were 
made 
that 
substance 
is 
not 
annihilated 
by 
the 
annihilation 
of 
what 
is 
not 
substance, 
and 
that 
if 
the 
elements 
out 
of 
which 
a 
thing 
is 
made 
are 
annihilated, 
then 
that 
which 
is 
made 
out 
of 
them 
is 
destroyed: 
these 
propositions 
being 
laid 
down, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
any 
part 
of 
substance 
is 
substance; 
this 
has 
not 
however 
been 
drawn 
by 
syllogism 
from 
the 
propositions 
assumed, 
but 
premisses 
are 
wanting. 
Again 
if 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
animal 
should 
exist, 
if 
man 
does, 
and 
that 
substance 
should 
exist, 
if 
animal 
does, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
substance 
should 
exist 
if 
man 
does: 
but 
as 
yet 
the 
conclusion 
has 
not 
been 
drawn 
syllogistically: 
for 
the 
premisses 
are 
not 
in 
the 
shape 
we 
required. 
We 
are 
deceived 
in 
such 
cases 
because 
something 
necessary 
results 
from 
what 
is 
assumed, 
since 
the 
syllogism 
also 
is 
necessary. 
But 
that 
which 
is 
necessary 
is 
wider 
than 
the 
syllogism: 
for 
every 
syllogism 
is 
necessary, 
but 
not 
everything 
which 
is 
necessary 
is 
a 
syllogism. 
Consequently, 
though 
something 
results 
when 
certain 
propositions 
are 
assumed, 
we 
must 
not 
try 
to 
reduce 
it 
directly, 
but 
must 
first 
state 
the 
two 
premisses, 
then 
divide 
them 
into 
their 
terms. 
We 
must 
take 
that 
term 
as 
middle 
which 
is 
stated 
in 
both 
the 
remisses: 
for 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
the 
middle 
should 
be 
found 
in 
both 
premisses 
in 
all 
the 
figures. 


If 
then 
the 
middle 
term 
is 
a 
predicate 
and 
a 
subject 
of 
predication, 
or 
if 
it 
is 
a 
predicate, 
and 
something 
else 
is 
denied 
of 
it, 
we 
shall 
have 
the 
first 
figure: 
if 
it 
both 
is 
a 
predicate 
and 
is 
denied 
of 
something, 
the 
middle 
figure: 
if 
other 
things 
are 
predicated 
of 
it, 
or 
one 
is 
denied, 
the 
other 
predicated, 
the 
last 
figure. 
For 
it 
was 
thus 
that 
we 
found 
the 
middle 
term 
placed 
in 
each 
figure. 
It 
is 
placed 
similarly 
too 
if 
the 
premisses 
are 
not 
universal: 
for 
the 
middle 
term 
is 
determined 
in 
the 
same 
way. 
Clearly 
then, 
if 
the 
same 
term 
is 
not 
stated 
more 
than 
once 
in 
the 
course 
of 
an 
argument, 
a 
syllogism 
cannot 
be 
made: 
for 
a 
middle 
term 
has 
not 
been 
taken. 
Since 
we 
know 
what 
sort 
of 
thesis 
is 
established 
in 
each 
figure, 
and 
in 
which 
the 
universal, 
in 
what 
sort 
the 
particular 
is 
described, 
clearly 
we 
must 
not 
look 
for 
all 
the 
figures, 
but 
for 
that 
which 
is 
appropriate 
to 
the 
thesis 
in 
hand. 
If 
the 
thesis 
is 
established 
in 
more 
figures 
than 
one, 
we 
shall 
recognize 
the 
figure 
by 
the 
position 
of 
the 
middle 
term. 



Men 
are 
frequently 
deceived 
about 
syllogisms 
because 
the 
inference 
is 
necessary, 
as 
has 
been 
said 
above; 
sometimes 
they 
are 
deceived 
by 
the 
similarity 
in 
the 
positing 
of 
the 
terms; 
and 
this 
ought 
not 
to 
escape 
our 
notice. 


E.g. 
if 
A 
is 
stated 
of 
B, 
and 
B 
of 
C: 
it 
would 
seem 
that 
a 
syllogism 
is 
possible 
since 
the 
terms 
stand 
thus: 
but 
nothing 
necessary 
results, 
nor 
does 
a 
syllogism. 
Let 
A 
represent 
the 
term 
‘being 
eternal’, 
B 
‘Aristomenes 
as 
an 
object 
of 
thought’, 
C 
‘Aristomenes’. 
It 
is 
true 
then 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
B. 
For 
Aristomenes 
as 
an 
object 
of 
thought 
is 
eternal. 
But 
B 
also 
belongs 
to 
C: 
for 
Aristomenes 
is 
Aristomenes 
as 
an 
object 
of 
thought. 
But 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
C: 
for 
Aristomenes 
is 
perishable. 
For 
no 
syllogism 
was 
made 
although 
the 
terms 
stood 
thus: 
that 
required 
that 
the 
premiss 
AB 
should 
be 
stated 
universally. 
But 
this 
is 
false, 
that 
every 
Aristomenes 
who 
is 
an 
object 
of 
thought 
is 
eternal, 
since 
Aristomenes 
is 
perishable. 
Again 
let 
C 
stand 
for 
‘Miccalus’, 
B 
for 
‘musical 
Miccalus’, 
A 
for 
‘perishing 
to-morrow’. 
It 
is 
true 
to 
predicate 
B 
of 
C: 
for 
Miccalus 
is 
musical 
Miccalus. 
Also 
A 
can 
be 
predicated 
of 
B: 
for 
musical 
Miccalus 
might 
perish 
to-morrow. 
But 
to 
state 
A 
of 
C 
is 
false 
at 
any 
rate. 
This 
argument 
then 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
former; 
for 
it 
is 
not 
true 
universally 
that 
musical 
Miccalus 
perishes 
to-morrow: 
but 
unless 
this 
is 
assumed, 
no 
syllogism 
(as 
we 
have 
shown) 
is 
possible. 
This 
deception 
then 
arises 
through 
ignoring 
a 
small 
distinction. 
For 
if 
we 
accept 
the 
conclusion 
as 
though 
it 
made 
no 
difference 
whether 
we 
said 
‘This 
belong 
to 
that’ 
or 
‘This 
belongs 
to 
all 
of 
that’. 


Men 
will 
frequently 
fall 
into 
fallacies 
through 
not 
setting 
out 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
premiss 
well, 
e.g. 
suppose 
A 
to 
be 
health, 
B 
disease, 
C 
man. 
It 
is 
true 
to 
say 
that 
A 
cannot 
belong 
to 
any 
B 
(for 
health 
belongs 
to 
no 
disease) 
and 
again 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
every 
C 
(for 
every 
man 
is 
capable 
of 
disease). 
It 
would 
seem 
to 
follow 
that 
health 
cannot 
belong 
to 
any 
man. 
The 
reason 
for 
this 
is 
that 
the 
terms 
are 
not 
set 
out 
well 
in 
the 
statement, 
since 
if 
the 
things 
which 
are 
in 
the 
conditions 
are 
substituted, 
no 
syllogism 
can 
be 
made, 
e.g. 
if 
‘healthy’ 
is 
substituted 
for 
‘health’ 
and 
‘diseased’ 
for 
‘disease’. 
For 
it 
is 
not 
true 
to 
say 
that 
being 
healthy 
cannot 
belong 
to 
one 
who 
is 
diseased. 
But 
unless 
this 
is 
assumed 
no 
conclusion 
results, 
save 
in 
respect 
of 
possibility: 
but 



such 
a 
conclusion 
is 
not 
impossible: 
for 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
health 
should 
belong 
to 
no 
man. 
Again 
the 
fallacy 
may 
occur 
in 
a 
similar 
way 
in 
the 
middle 
figure: 
‘it 
is 
not 
possible 
that 
health 
should 
belong 
to 
any 
disease, 
but 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
health 
should 
belong 
to 
every 
man, 
consequently 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
that 
disease 
should 
belong 
to 
any 
man’. 
In 
the 
third 
figure 
the 
fallacy 
results 
in 
reference 
to 
possibility. 
For 
health 
and 
diseae 
and 
knowledge 
and 
ignorance, 
and 
in 
general 
contraries, 
may 
possibly 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
thing, 
but 
cannot 
belong 
to 
one 
another. 
This 
is 
not 
in 
agreement 
with 
what 
was 
said 
before: 
for 
we 
stated 
that 
when 
several 
things 
could 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
thing, 
they 
could 
belong 
to 
one 
another. 


It 
is 
evident 
then 
that 
in 
all 
these 
cases 
the 
fallacy 
arises 
from 
the 
setting 
out 
of 
the 
terms: 
for 
if 
the 
things 
that 
are 
in 
the 
conditions 
are 
substituted, 
no 
fallacy 
arises. 
It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
in 
such 
premisses 
what 
possesses 
the 
condition 
ought 
always 
to 
be 
substituted 
for 
the 
condition 
and 
taken 
as 
the 
term. 


35 


We 
must 
not 
always 
seek 
to 
set 
out 
the 
terms 
a 
single 
word: 
for 
we 
shall 
often 
have 
complexes 
of 
words 
to 
which 
a 
single 
name 
is 
not 
given. 
Hence 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
reduce 
syllogisms 
with 
such 
terms. 
Sometimes 
too 
fallacies 
will 
result 
from 
such 
a 
search, 
e.g. 
the 
belief 
that 
syllogism 
can 
establish 
that 
which 
has 
no 
mean. 
Let 
A 
stand 
for 
two 
right 
angles, 
B 
for 
triangle, 
C 
for 
isosceles 
triangle. 
A 
then 
belongs 
to 
C 
because 
of 
B: 
but 
A 
belongs 
to 
B 
without 
the 
mediation 
of 
another 
term: 
for 
the 
triangle 
in 
virtue 
of 
its 
own 
nature 
contains 
two 
right 
angles, 
consequently 
there 
will 
be 
no 
middle 
term 
for 
the 
proposition 
AB, 
although 
it 
is 
demonstrable. 
For 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
middle 
must 
not 
always 
be 
assumed 
to 
be 
an 
individual 
thing, 
but 
sometimes 
a 
complex 
of 
words, 
as 
happens 
in 
the 
case 
mentioned. 


36 


That 
the 
first 
term 
belongs 
to 
the 
middle, 
and 
the 
middle 
to 
the 
extreme, 
must 
not 
be 
understood 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
they 
can 
always 
be 
predicated 
of 
one 
another 
or 
that 
the 
first 
term 
will 
be 
predicated 
of 
the 
middle 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
the 
middle 
is 
predicated 
of 
the 
last 
term. 
The 
same 
holds 
if 
the 
premisses 



are 
negative. 
But 
we 
must 
suppose 
th 
meanings 
as 
the 
senses 
in 
which 
the 
ve 
assertion 
that 
a 
thing 
‘is’ 
may 
be 
sai 
statement 
that 
there 
is 
a 
single 
science 
being 
a 
single 
science’, 
and 
B 
for 
thing 
Then 
A 
belongs 
to 
B, 
not 
in 
the 
sense 
being 
a 
single 
science 
of 
them, 
but 
in 
contraries 
that 
there 
is 
a 
single 
science 
o 


It 
happens 
sometimes 
that 
the 
first 
t 
middle 
is 
not 
stated 
of 
the 
third 
term 
wisdom 
is 
of 
the 
good, 
the 
conclusion 
is 
The 
good 
then 
is 
not 
knowledge, 
thoug 
the 
middle 
term 
is 
stated 
of 
the 
third, 
bu 


e.g. 
if 
there 
is 
a 
science 
of 
everything 
th 
the 
good 
both 
is 
a 
contrary 
and 
has 
a 
qu 
science 
of 
the 
good, 
but 
the 
good 
is 
n 
quality 
or 
is 
a 
contrary, 
though 
the 
goo 
the 
first 
term 
is 
stated 
of 
the 
middle, 
n 
first 
is 
sometimes 
stated 
of 
the 
third, 
a 
genus 
of 
that 
of 
which 
there 
is 
a 
science 
we 
conclude 
that 
there 
is 
a 
genus 
of 
th 
anything. 
And 
if 
that 
of 
which 
there 
is 
science 
of 
the 
good, 
we 
conclude 
that 
th 
is 
predicated 
of 
the 
extreme, 
but 
in 
the 
another. 
The 
same 
holds 
good 
where 
the 
rel 
belong 
to 
this’ 
does 
not 
always 
mean 
tha 
‘this 
is 
not 
of 
that’ 
or 
‘for 
that’, 
e.g. 
‘th 
becoming 
of 
a 
becoming, 
but 
there 
is 
a 
not 
a 
becoming.’ 
Or 
again 
it 
may 
be 
sai 
there 
is 
not 
a 
sign 
of 
a 
sign, 
consequentl 
the 
other 
cases 
too, 
in 
which 
the 
the 
asserted 
in 
a 
particular 
way, 
in 
relation 
the 
inference 
‘opportunity 
is 
not 
the 
ri 
God, 
but 
the 
right 
time 
does 
not, 
since 
take 
as 
terms 
opportunity-right 
time-God 
according 
to 
the 
case 
of 
the 
noun.

Prior 
Analytics, 
Book 
II 


Translated 
by 
A. 
J. 
Jenkinson 


We 
have 
already 
explained 
the 
number 
of 
the 
figures, 
the 
character 
and 
number 
of 
the 
premisses, 
when 
and 
how 
a 
syllogism 
is 
formed; 
further 
what 
we 
must 
look 
for 
when 
a 
refuting 
and 
establishing 
propositions, 
and 
how 
we 
should 
investigate 
a 
given 
problem 
in 
any 
branch 
of 
inquiry, 
also 
by 
what 
means 
we 
shall 
obtain 
principles 
appropriate 
to 
each 
subject. 
Since 
some 
syllogisms 
are 
universal, 
others 
particular, 
all 
the 
universal 
syllogisms 
give 
more 
than 
one 
result, 
and 
of 
particular 
syllogisms 
the 
affirmative 
yield 
more 
than 
one, 
the 
negative 
yield 
only 
the 
stated 
conclusion. 
For 
all 
propositions 
are 
convertible 
save 
only 
the 
particular 
negative: 
and 
the 
conclusion 
states 
one 
definite 
thing 
about 
another 
definite 
thing. 
Consequently 
all 
syllogisms 
save 
the 
particular 
negative 
yield 
more 
than 
one 
conclusion, 
e.g. 
if 
A 
has 
been 
proved 
to 
to 
all 
or 
to 
some 
B, 
then 
B 
must 
belong 
to 
some 
A: 
and 
if 
A 
has 
been 
proved 
to 
belong 
to 
no 
B, 
then 
B 
belongs 
to 
no 
A. 
This 
is 
a 
different 
conclusion 
from 
the 
former. 
But 
if 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B, 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
B 
should 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
A: 
for 
it 
may 
possibly 
belong 
to 
all 
A. 


This 
then 
is 
the 
reason 
common 
to 
all 
syllogisms 
whether 
universal 
or 
particular. 
But 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
give 
another 
reason 
concerning 
those 
which 
are 
universal. 
For 
all 
the 
things 
that 
are 
subordinate 
to 
the 
middle 
term 
or 
to 
the 
conclusion 
may 
be 
proved 
by 
the 
same 
syllogism, 
if 
the 
former 
are 
placed 
in 
the 
middle, 
the 
latter 
in 
the 
conclusion; 
e.g. 
if 
the 
conclusion 
AB 
is 
proved 
through 
C, 
whatever 
is 
subordinate 
to 
B 
or 
C 
must 
accept 
the 
predicate 
A: 
for 
if 
D 
is 
included 
in 
B 
as 
in 
a 
whole, 
and 
B 
is 
included 
in 
A, 
then 
D 
will 
be 
included 
in 
A. 
Again 
if 
E 
is 
included 
in 
C 
as 
in 
a 
whole, 
and 
C 
is 
included 
in 
A, 
then 
E 
will 
be 
included 
in 
A. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
syllogism 
is 
negative. 
In 
the 
second 
figure 
it 
will 
be 
possible 
to 
infer 
only 
that 
which 
is 
subordinate 
to 
the 
conclusion, 
e.g. 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B 
and 
to 
all 
C; 
we 
conclude 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
no 
C. 
If 
then 
D 
is 
subordinate 
to 
C, 
clearly 
B 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
it. 
But 
that 
B 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
what 
is 
subordinate 
to 
A 
is 
not 
clear 
by 
means 
of 
the 



syllogism. 
And 
yet 
B 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
E, 
if 
E 
is 
subordinate 
to 
A. 
But 
while 
it 
has 
been 
proved 
through 
the 
syllogism 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
no 
C, 
it 
has 
been 
assumed 
without 
proof 
that 
B 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
A, 
consequently 
it 
does 
not 
result 
through 
the 
syllogism 
that 
B 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
E. 


But 
in 
particular 
syllogisms 
there 
will 
be 
no 
necessity 
of 
inferring 
what 
is 
subordinate 
to 
the 
conclusion 
(for 
a 
syllogism 
does 
not 
result 
when 
this 
premiss 
is 
particular), 
but 
whatever 
is 
subordinate 
to 
the 
middle 
term 
may 
be 
inferred, 
not 
however 
through 
the 
syllogism, 
e.g. 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B 
and 
B 
to 
some 
C. 
Nothing 
can 
be 
inferred 
about 
that 
which 
is 
subordinate 
to 
C; 
something 
can 
be 
inferred 
about 
that 
which 
is 
subordinate 
to 
B, 
but 
not 
through 
the 
preceding 
syllogism. 
Similarly 
in 
the 
other 
figures. 
That 
which 
is 
subordinate 
to 
the 
conclusion 
cannot 
be 
proved; 
the 
other 
subordinate 
can 
be 
proved, 
only 
not 
through 
the 
syllogism, 
just 
as 
in 
the 
universal 
syllogisms 
what 
is 
subordinate 
to 
the 
middle 
term 
is 
proved 
(as 
we 
saw) 
from 
a 
premiss 
which 
is 
not 
demonstrated: 
consequently 
either 
a 
conclusion 
is 
not 
possible 
in 
the 
case 
of 
universal 
syllogisms 
or 
else 
it 
is 
possible 
also 
in 
the 
case 
of 
particular 
syllogisms. 


It 
is 
possible 
for 
the 
premisses 
of 
the 
syllogism 
to 
be 
true, 
or 
to 
be 
false, 
or 
to 
be 
the 
one 
true, 
the 
other 
false. 
The 
conclusion 
is 
either 
true 
or 
false 
necessarily. 
From 
true 
premisses 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
draw 
a 
false 
conclusion, 
but 
a 
true 
conclusion 
may 
be 
drawn 
from 
false 
premisses, 
true 
however 
only 
in 
respect 
to 
the 
fact, 
not 
to 
the 
reason. 
The 
reason 
cannot 
be 
established 
from 
false 
premisses: 
why 
this 
is 
so 
will 
be 
explained 
in 
the 
sequel. 


First 
then 
that 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
draw 
a 
false 
conclusion 
from 
true 
premisses, 
is 
made 
clear 
by 
this 
consideration. 
If 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
B 
should 
be 
when 
A 
is, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
A 
should 
not 
be 
when 
B 
is 
not. 
If 
then 
A 
is 
true, 
B 
must 
be 
true: 
otherwise 
it 
will 
turn 
out 
that 
the 
same 
thing 
both 
is 
and 
is 
not 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
But 
this 
is 
impossible. 
Let 
it 
not, 
because 
A 
is 
laid 
down 
as 
a 
single 
term, 
be 
supposed 
that 
it 
is 
possible, 
when 
a 
single 
fact 
is 
given, 
that 
something 
should 
necessarily 
result. 
For 
that 
is 
not 
possible. 
For 
what 
results 
necessarily 
is 
the 
conclusion, 
and 
the 
means 
by 
which 
this 
comes 
about 
are 
at 
the 
least 
three 
terms, 
and 
two 
relations 
of 
subject 
and 
predicate 
or 
premisses. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
true 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
that 
to 
which 
B 
belongs, 
and 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
that 
to 
which 
C 
belongs, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
A 
should 



belong 
to 
all 
that 
to 
which 
C 
belongs, 
and 
this 
cannot 
be 
false: 
for 
then 
the 
same 
thing 
will 
belong 
and 
not 
belong 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
So 
A 
is 
posited 
as 
one 
thing, 
being 
two 
premisses 
taken 
together. 
The 
same 
holds 
good 
of 
negative 
syllogisms: 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
prove 
a 
false 
conclusion 
from 
true 
premisses. 


But 
from 
what 
is 
false 
a 
true 
conclusion 
may 
be 
drawn, 
whether 
both 
the 
premisses 
are 
false 
or 
only 
one, 
provided 
that 
this 
is 
not 
either 
of 
the 
premisses 
indifferently, 
if 
it 
is 
taken 
as 
wholly 
false: 
but 
if 
the 
premiss 
is 
not 
taken 
as 
wholly 
false, 
it 
does 
not 
matter 
which 
of 
the 
two 
is 
false. 
(1) 
Let 
A 
belong 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
C, 
but 
to 
none 
of 
the 
Bs, 
neither 
let 
B 
belong 
to 
C. 
This 
is 
possible, 
e.g. 
animal 
belongs 
to 
no 
stone, 
nor 
stone 
to 
any 
man. 
If 
then 
A 
is 
taken 
to 
belong 
to 
all 
B 
and 
B 
to 
all 
C, 
A 
will 
belong 
to 
all 
C; 
consequently 
though 
both 
the 
premisses 
are 
false 
the 
conclusion 
is 
true: 
for 
every 
man 
is 
an 
animal. 
Similarly 
with 
the 
negative. 
For 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
neither 
A 
nor 
B 
should 
belong 
to 
any 
C, 
although 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
e.g. 
if 
the 
same 
terms 
are 
taken 
and 
man 
is 
put 
as 
middle: 
for 
neither 
animal 
nor 
man 
belongs 
to 
any 
stone, 
but 
animal 
belongs 
to 
every 
man. 
Consequently 
if 
one 
term 
is 
taken 
to 
belong 
to 
none 
of 
that 
to 
which 
it 
does 
belong, 
and 
the 
other 
term 
is 
taken 
to 
belong 
to 
all 
of 
that 
to 
which 
it 
does 
not 
belong, 
though 
both 
the 
premisses 
are 
false 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
true. 
(2) 
A 
similar 
proof 
may 
be 
given 
if 
each 
premiss 
is 
partially 
false. 


(3) 
But 
if 
one 
only 
of 
the 
premisses 
is 
false, 
when 
the 
first 
premiss 
is 
wholly 
false, 
e.g. 
AB, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
not 
be 
true, 
but 
if 
the 
premiss 
BC 
is 
wholly 
false, 
a 
true 
conclusion 
will 
be 
possible. 
I 
mean 
by 
‘wholly 
false’ 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
truth, 
e.g. 
if 
what 
belongs 
to 
none 
is 
assumed 
to 
belong 
to 
all, 
or 
if 
what 
belongs 
to 
all 
is 
assumed 
to 
belong 
to 
none. 
Let 
A 
belong 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
all 
C. 
If 
then 
the 
premiss 
BC 
which 
I 
take 
is 
true, 
and 
the 
premiss 
AB 
is 
wholly 
false, 
viz. 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
the 
conclusion 
should 
be 
true: 
for 
A 
belonged 
to 
none 
of 
the 
Cs, 
since 
A 
belonged 
to 
nothing 
to 
which 
B 
belonged, 
and 
B 
belonged 
to 
all 
C. 
Similarly 
there 
cannot 
be 
a 
true 
conclusion 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
all 
C, 
but 
while 
the 
true 
premiss 
BC 
is 
assumed, 
the 
wholly 
false 
premiss 
AB 
is 
also 
assumed, 
viz. 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
nothing 
to 
which 
B 
belongs: 
here 
the 
conclusion 
must 
be 
false. 
For 
A 
will 
belong 
to 
all 
C, 
since 
A 
belongs 
to 
everything 
to 
which 
B 
belongs, 
and 
B 
to 
all 
C. 
It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
when 
the 
first 
premiss 
is 
wholly 
false, 
whether 
affirmative 
or 
negative, 
and 
the 
other 
premiss 
is 
true, 
the 
conclusion 
cannot 
be 
true. 

(4) 
But 
if 
the 
premiss 
is 
not 
wholly 
false, 
a 
true 
conclusion 
is 
possible. 
For 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
C 
and 
to 
some 
B, 
and 
if 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
e.g. 
animal 
to 
every 
swan 
and 
to 
some 
white 
thing, 
and 
white 
to 
every 
swan, 
then 
if 
we 
take 
as 
premisses 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
all 
C, 
A 
will 
belong 
to 
all 
C 
truly: 
for 
every 
swan 
is 
an 
animal. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
statement 
AB 
is 
negative. 
For 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
some 
B 
and 
to 
no 
C, 
and 
that 
B 
should 
belong 
to 
all 
C, 
e.g. 
animal 
to 
some 
white 
thing, 
but 
to 
no 
snow, 
and 
white 
to 
all 
snow. 
If 
then 
one 
should 
assume 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
all 
C, 
then 
will 
belong 
to 
no 
C. 
(5) 
But 
if 
the 
premiss 
AB, 
which 
is 
assumed, 
is 
wholly 
true, 
and 
the 
premiss 
BC 
is 
wholly 
false, 
a 
true 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible: 
for 
nothing 
prevents 
A 
belonging 
to 
all 
B 
and 
to 
all 
C, 
though 
B 
belongs 
to 
no 
C, 
e.g. 
these 
being 
species 
of 
the 
same 
genus 
which 
are 
not 
subordinate 
one 
to 
the 
other: 
for 
animal 
belongs 
both 
to 
horse 
and 
to 
man, 
but 
horse 
to 
no 
man. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B 
and 
B 
to 
all 
C, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
true, 
although 
the 
premiss 
BC 
is 
wholly 
false. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
premiss 
AB 
is 
negative. 
For 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
neither 
to 
any 
B 
nor 
to 
any 
C, 
and 
that 
B 
should 
not 
belong 
to 
any 
C, 
e.g. 
a 
genus 
to 
species 
of 
another 
genus: 
for 
animal 
belongs 
neither 
to 
music 
nor 
to 
the 
art 
of 
healing, 
nor 
does 
music 
belong 
to 
the 
art 
of 
healing. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
all 
C, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
true. 
(6) 
And 
if 
the 
premiss 
BC 
is 
not 
wholly 
false 
but 
in 
part 
only, 
even 
so 
the 
conclusion 
may 
be 
true. 
For 
nothing 
prevents 
A 
belonging 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
B 
and 
of 
C, 
while 
B 
belongs 
to 
some 
C, 
e.g. 
a 
genus 
to 
its 
species 
and 
difference: 
for 
animal 
belongs 
to 
every 
man 
and 
to 
every 
footed 
thing, 
and 
man 
to 
some 
footed 
things 
though 
not 
to 
all. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
all 
C, 
A 
will 
belong 
to 
all 
C: 
and 
this 
ex 
hypothesi 
is 
true. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
premiss 
AB 
is 
negative. 
For 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
A 
should 
neither 
belong 
to 
any 
B 
nor 
to 
any 
C, 
though 
B 
belongs 
to 
some 
C, 
e.g. 
a 
genus 
to 
the 
species 
of 
another 
genus 
and 
its 
difference: 
for 
animal 
neither 
belongs 
to 
any 
wisdom 
nor 
to 
any 
instance 
of 
‘speculative’, 
but 
wisdom 
belongs 
to 
some 
instance 
of 
‘speculative’. 
If 
then 
it 
should 
be 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
all 
C, 
will 
belong 
to 
no 
C: 
and 
this 
ex 
hypothesi 
is 
true. 
In 
particular 
syllogisms 
it 
is 
possible 
when 
the 
first 
premiss 
is 
wholly 
false, 
and 
the 
other 
true, 
that 
the 
conclusion 
should 
be 
true; 
also 
when 
the 
first 
premiss 
is 
false 
in 
part, 
and 
the 
other 
true; 
and 
when 
the 
first 
is 
true, 
and 
the 



particular 
is 
false; 
and 
when 
both 
are 
false. 
(7) 
For 
nothing 
prevents 
A 
belonging 
to 
no 
B, 
but 
to 
some 
C, 
and 
B 
to 
some 
C, 
e.g. 
animal 
belongs 
to 
no 
snow, 
but 
to 
some 
white 
thing, 
and 
snow 
to 
some 
white 
thing. 
If 
then 
snow 
is 
taken 
as 
middle, 
and 
animal 
as 
first 
term, 
and 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
some 
C, 
then 
the 
premiss 
BC 
is 
wholly 
false, 
the 
premiss 
BC 
true, 
and 
the 
conclusion 
true. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
premiss 
AB 
is 
negative: 
for 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
B, 
but 
not 
to 
some 
C, 
although 
B 
belongs 
to 
some 
C, 
e.g. 
animal 
belongs 
to 
every 
man, 
but 
does 
not 
follow 
some 
white, 
but 
man 
belongs 
to 
some 
white; 
consequently 
if 
man 
be 
taken 
as 
middle 
term 
and 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B 
but 
B 
belongs 
to 
some 
C, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
true 
although 
the 
premiss 
AB 
is 
wholly 
false. 
(If 
the 
premiss 
AB 
is 
false 
in 
part, 
the 
conclusion 
may 
be 
true. 
For 
nothing 
prevents 
A 
belonging 
both 
to 
B 
and 
to 
some 
C, 
and 
B 
belonging 
to 
some 
C, 
e.g. 
animal 
to 
something 
beautiful 
and 
to 
something 
great, 
and 
beautiful 
belonging 
to 
something 
great. 
If 
then 
A 
is 
assumed 
to 
belong 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
some 
C, 
the 
a 
premiss 
AB 
will 
be 
partially 
false, 
the 
premiss 
BC 
will 
be 
true, 
and 
the 
conclusion 
true. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
premiss 
AB 
is 
negative. 
For 
the 
same 
terms 
will 
serve, 
and 
in 
the 
same 
positions, 
to 
prove 
the 
point. 


(9) 
Again 
if 
the 
premiss 
AB 
is 
true, 
and 
the 
premiss 
BC 
is 
false, 
the 
conclusion 
may 
be 
true. 
For 
nothing 
prevents 
A 
belonging 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
B 
and 
to 
some 
C, 
while 
B 
belongs 
to 
no 
C, 
e.g. 
animal 
to 
every 
swan 
and 
to 
some 
black 
things, 
though 
swan 
belongs 
to 
no 
black 
thing. 
Consequently 
if 
it 
should 
be 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
some 
C, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
true, 
although 
the 
statement 
BC 
is 
false. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
premiss 
AB 
is 
negative. 
For 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
not 
to 
some 
C, 
while 
B 
belongs 
to 
no 
C, 
e.g. 
a 
genus 
to 
the 
species 
of 
another 
genus 
and 
to 
the 
accident 
of 
its 
own 
species: 
for 
animal 
belongs 
to 
no 
number 
and 
not 
to 
some 
white 
things, 
and 
number 
belongs 
to 
nothing 
white. 
If 
then 
number 
is 
taken 
as 
middle, 
and 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
some 
C, 
then 
A 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C, 
which 
ex 
hypothesi 
is 
true. 
And 
the 
premiss 
AB 
is 
true, 
the 
premiss 
BC 
false. 
(10) 
Also 
if 
the 
premiss 
AB 
is 
partially 
false, 
and 
the 
premiss 
BC 
is 
false 
too, 
the 
conclusion 
may 
be 
true. 
For 
nothing 
prevents 
A 
belonging 
to 
some 
B 
and 
to 
some 
C, 
though 
B 
belongs 
to 
no 
C, 
e.g. 
if 
B 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
C, 
and 
both 
are 
accidents 
of 
the 
same 
genus: 
for 
animal 
belongs 
to 
some 
white 
things 
and 
to 
some 
black 
things, 
but 
white 
belongs 
to 
no 
black 
thing. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
some 
C, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 

true. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
premiss 
AB 
is 
negative: 
for 
the 
same 
terms 
arranged 
in 
the 
same 
way 
will 
serve 
for 
the 
proof. 


(11) 
Also 
though 
both 
premisses 
are 
false 
the 
conclusion 
may 
be 
true. 
For 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
A 
may 
belong 
to 
no 
B 
and 
to 
some 
C, 
while 
B 
belongs 
to 
no 
C, 
e.g. 
a 
genus 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
species 
of 
another 
genus, 
and 
to 
the 
accident 
of 
its 
own 
species: 
for 
animal 
belongs 
to 
no 
number, 
but 
to 
some 
white 
things, 
and 
number 
to 
nothing 
white. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B 
and 
B 
to 
some 
C, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
true, 
though 
both 
premisses 
are 
false. 
Similarly 
also 
if 
the 
premiss 
AB 
is 
negative. 
For 
nothing 
prevents 
A 
belonging 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
B, 
and 
not 
to 
some 
C, 
while 
B 
belongs 
to 
no 
C, 
e.g. 
animal 
belongs 
to 
every 
swan, 
and 
not 
to 
some 
black 
things, 
and 
swan 
belongs 
to 
nothing 
black. 
Consequently 
if 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
some 
C, 
then 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C. 
The 
conclusion 
then 
is 
true, 
but 
the 
premisses 
arc 
false. 
In 
the 
middle 
figure 
it 
is 
possible 
in 
every 
way 
to 
reach 
a 
true 
conclusion 
through 
false 
premisses, 
whether 
the 
syllogisms 
are 
universal 
or 
particular, 
viz. 
when 
both 
premisses 
are 
wholly 
false; 
when 
each 
is 
partially 
false; 
when 
one 
is 
true, 
the 
other 
wholly 
false 
(it 
does 
not 
matter 
which 
of 
the 
two 
premisses 
is 
false); 
if 
both 
premisses 
are 
partially 
false; 
if 
one 
is 
quite 
true, 
the 
other 
partially 
false; 
if 
one 
is 
wholly 
false, 
the 
other 
partially 
true. 
For 
(1) 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B 
and 
to 
all 
C, 
e.g. 
animal 
to 
no 
stone 
and 
to 
every 
horse, 
then 
if 
the 
premisses 
are 
stated 
contrariwise 
and 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B 
and 
to 
no 
C, 
though 
the 
premisses 
are 
wholly 
false 
they 
will 
yield 
a 
true 
conclusion. 
Similarly 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B 
and 
to 
no 
C: 
for 
we 
shall 
have 
the 
same 
syllogism. 


(2) 
Again 
if 
one 
premiss 
is 
wholly 
false, 
the 
other 
wholly 
true: 
for 
nothing 
prevents 
A 
belonging 
to 
all 
B 
and 
to 
all 
C, 
though 
B 
belongs 
to 
no 
C, 
e.g. 
a 
genus 
to 
its 
co-ordinate 
species. 
For 
animal 
belongs 
to 
every 
horse 
and 
man, 
and 
no 
man 
is 
a 
horse. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
animal 
belongs 
to 
all 
of 
the 
one, 
and 
none 
of 
the 
other, 
the 
one 
premiss 
will 
be 
wholly 
false, 
the 
other 
wholly 
true, 
and 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
true 
whichever 
term 
the 
negative 
statement 
concerns. 
(3) 
Also 
if 
one 
premiss 
is 
partially 
false, 
the 
other 
wholly 
true. 
For 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
some 
B 
and 
to 
all 
C, 
though 
B 
belongs 
to 
no 

C, 
e.g. 
animal 
to 
some 
white 
things 
and 
to 
every 
raven, 
though 
white 
belongs 
to 
no 
raven. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
but 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
C, 
the 
premiss 
AB 
is 
partially 
false, 
the 
premiss 
AC 
wholly 
true, 
and 
the 
conclusion 
true. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
negative 
statement 
is 
transposed: 
the 
proof 
can 
be 
made 
by 
means 
of 
the 
same 
terms. 
Also 
if 
the 
affirmative 
premiss 
is 
partially 
false, 
the 
negative 
wholly 
true, 
a 
true 
conclusion 
is 
possible. 
For 
nothing 
prevents 
A 
belonging 
to 
some 
B, 
but 
not 
to 
C 
as 
a 
whole, 
while 
B 
belongs 
to 
no 
C, 
e.g. 
animal 
belongs 
to 
some 
white 
things, 
but 
to 
no 
pitch, 
and 
white 
belongs 
to 
no 
pitch. 
Consequently 
if 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
B, 
but 
to 
no 
C, 
the 
premiss 
AB 
is 
partially 
false, 
the 
premiss 
AC 
is 
wholly 
true, 
and 
the 
conclusion 
is 
true. 


(4) 
And 
if 
both 
the 
premisses 
are 
partially 
false, 
the 
conclusion 
may 
be 
true. 
For 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
some 
B 
and 
to 
some 
C, 
and 
B 
to 
no 
C, 
e.g. 
animal 
to 
some 
white 
things 
and 
to 
some 
black 
things, 
though 
white 
belongs 
to 
nothing 
black. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B 
and 
to 
no 
C, 
both 
premisses 
are 
partially 
false, 
but 
the 
conclusion 
is 
true. 
Similarly, 
if 
the 
negative 
premiss 
is 
transposed, 
the 
proof 
can 
be 
made 
by 
means 
of 
the 
same 
terms. 
It 
is 
clear 
also 
that 
our 
thesis 
holds 
in 
particular 
syllogisms. 
For 
(5) 
nothing 
prevents 
A 
belonging 
to 
all 
B 
and 
to 
some 
C, 
though 
B 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C, 
e.g. 
animal 
to 
every 
man 
and 
to 
some 
white 
things, 
though 
man 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
white 
things. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
stated 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B 
and 
to 
some 
C, 
the 
universal 
premiss 
is 
wholly 
false, 
the 
particular 
premiss 
is 
true, 
and 
the 
conclusion 
is 
true. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
premiss 
AB 
is 
affirmative: 
for 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
not 
to 
some 
C, 
though 
B 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C, 
e.g. 
animal 
belongs 
to 
nothing 
lifeless, 
and 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
white 
things, 
and 
lifeless 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
white 
things. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
stated 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B 
and 
not 
to 
some 
C, 
the 
premiss 
AB 
which 
is 
universal 
is 
wholly 
false, 
the 
premiss 
AC 
is 
true, 
and 
the 
conclusion 
is 
true. 
Also 
a 
true 
conclusion 
is 
possible 
when 
the 
universal 
premiss 
is 
true, 
and 
the 
particular 
is 
false. 
For 
nothing 
prevents 
A 
following 
neither 
B 
nor 
C 
at 
all, 
while 
B 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C, 
e.g. 
animal 
belongs 
to 
no 
number 
nor 
to 
anything 
lifeless, 
and 
number 
does 
not 
follow 
some 
lifeless 
things. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
stated 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B 
and 
to 
some 
C, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
true, 
and 
the 
universal 
premiss 
true, 
but 
the 
particular 
false. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
premiss 
which 
is 
stated 
universally 
is 
affirmative. 
For 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
should 
A 
belong 
both 
to 
B 
and 
to 
C 
as 
wholes, 
though 
B 
does 



not 
follow 
some 
C, 
e.g. 
a 
genus 
in 
relation 
to 
its 
species 
and 
difference: 
for 
animal 
follows 
every 
man 
and 
footed 
things 
as 
a 
whole, 
but 
man 
does 
not 
follow 
every 
footed 
thing. 
Consequently 
if 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
B, 
but 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C, 
the 
universal 
premiss 
is 
true, 
the 
particular 
false, 
and 
the 
conclusion 
true. 


(6) 
It 
is 
clear 
too 
that 
though 
both 
premisses 
are 
false 
they 
may 
yield 
a 
true 
conclusion, 
since 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
both 
to 
B 
and 
to 
C 
as 
wholes, 
though 
B 
does 
not 
follow 
some 
C. 
For 
if 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B 
and 
to 
some 
C, 
the 
premisses 
are 
both 
false, 
but 
the 
conclusion 
is 
true. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
universal 
premiss 
is 
affirmative 
and 
the 
particular 
negative. 
For 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
A 
should 
follow 
no 
B 
and 
all 
C, 
though 
B 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C, 
e.g. 
animal 
follows 
no 
science 
but 
every 
man, 
though 
science 
does 
not 
follow 
every 
man. 
If 
then 
A 
is 
assumed 
to 
belong 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
B, 
and 
not 
to 
follow 
some 
C, 
the 
premisses 
are 
false 
but 
the 
conclusion 
is 
true. 
In 
the 
last 
figure 
a 
true 
conclusion 
may 
come 
through 
what 
is 
false, 
alike 
when 
both 
premisses 
are 
wholly 
false, 
when 
each 
is 
partly 
false, 
when 
one 
premiss 
is 
wholly 
true, 
the 
other 
false, 
when 
one 
premiss 
is 
partly 
false, 
the 
other 
wholly 
true, 
and 
vice 
versa, 
and 
in 
every 
other 
way 
in 
which 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
alter 
the 
premisses. 
For 
(1) 
nothing 
prevents 
neither 
A 
nor 
B 
from 
belonging 
to 
any 
C, 
while 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
e.g. 
neither 
man 
nor 
footed 
follows 
anything 
lifeless, 
though 
man 
belongs 
to 
some 
footed 
things. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
and 
B 
belong 
to 
all 
C, 
the 
premisses 
will 
be 
wholly 
false, 
but 
the 
conclusion 
true. 
Similarly 
if 
one 
premiss 
is 
negative, 
the 
other 
affirmative. 
For 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
B 
should 
belong 
to 
no 
C, 
but 
A 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
that 
should 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B, 
e.g. 
black 
belongs 
to 
no 
swan, 
animal 
to 
every 
swan, 
and 
animal 
not 
to 
everything 
black. 
Consequently 
if 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
A 
to 
no 
C, 
A 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B: 
and 
the 
conclusion 
is 
true, 
though 
the 
premisses 
are 
false. 


(2) 
Also 
if 
each 
premiss 
is 
partly 
false, 
the 
conclusion 
may 
be 
true. 
For 
nothing 
prevents 
both 
A 
and 
B 
from 
belonging 
to 
some 
C 
while 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
e.g. 
white 
and 
beautiful 
belong 
to 
some 
animals, 
and 
white 
to 
some 
beautiful 
things. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
stated 
that 
A 
and 
B 
belong 
to 
all 
C, 
the 
premisses 
are 
partially 
false, 
but 
the 
conclusion 
is 
true. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
premiss 
AC 
is 

stated 
as 
negative. 
For 
nothing 
prevents 
A 
from 
not 
belonging, 
and 
B 
from 
belonging, 
to 
some 
C, 
while 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
all 
B, 
e.g. 
white 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
animals, 
beautiful 
belongs 
to 
some 
animals, 
and 
white 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
everything 
beautiful. 
Consequently 
if 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
C, 
and 
B 
to 
all 
C, 
both 
premisses 
are 
partly 
false, 
but 
the 
conclusion 
is 
true. 


(3) 
Similarly 
if 
one 
of 
the 
premisses 
assumed 
is 
wholly 
false, 
the 
other 
wholly 
true. 
For 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
both 
A 
and 
B 
should 
follow 
all 
C, 
though 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B, 
e.g. 
animal 
and 
white 
follow 
every 
swan, 
though 
animal 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
everything 
white. 
Taking 
these 
then 
as 
terms, 
if 
one 
assumes 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
C, 
but 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
C 
at 
all, 
the 
premiss 
BC 
will 
be 
wholly 
true, 
the 
premiss 
AC 
wholly 
false, 
and 
the 
conclusion 
true. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
statement 
BC 
is 
false, 
the 
statement 
AC 
true, 
the 
conclusion 
may 
be 
true. 
The 
same 
terms 
will 
serve 
for 
the 
proof. 
Also 
if 
both 
the 
premisses 
assumed 
are 
affirmative, 
the 
conclusion 
may 
be 
true. 
For 
nothing 
prevents 
B 
from 
following 
all 
C, 
and 
A 
from 
not 
belonging 
to 
C 
at 
all, 
though 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
e.g. 
animal 
belongs 
to 
every 
swan, 
black 
to 
no 
swan, 
and 
black 
to 
some 
animals. 
Consequently 
if 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
and 
B 
belong 
to 
every 
C, 
the 
premiss 
BC 
is 
wholly 
true, 
the 
premiss 
AC 
is 
wholly 
false, 
and 
the 
conclusion 
is 
true. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
premiss 
AC 
which 
is 
assumed 
is 
true: 
the 
proof 
can 
be 
made 
through 
the 
same 
terms. 
(4) 
Again 
if 
one 
premiss 
is 
wholly 
true, 
the 
other 
partly 
false, 
the 
conclusion 
may 
be 
true. 
For 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
B 
should 
belong 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
A 
to 
some 
C, 
while 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
e.g. 
biped 
belongs 
to 
every 
man, 
beautiful 
not 
to 
every 
man, 
and 
beautiful 
to 
some 
bipeds. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
both 
A 
and 
B 
belong 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
C, 
the 
premiss 
BC 
is 
wholly 
true, 
the 
premiss 
AC 
partly 
false, 
the 
conclusion 
true. 
Similarly 
if 
of 
the 
premisses 
assumed 
AC 
is 
true 
and 
BC 
partly 
false, 
a 
true 
conclusion 
is 
possible: 
this 
can 
be 
proved, 
if 
the 
same 
terms 
as 
before 
are 
transposed. 
Also 
the 
conclusion 
may 
be 
true 
if 
one 
premiss 
is 
negative, 
the 
other 
affirmative. 
For 
since 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
B 
should 
belong 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
C, 
and 
A 
to 
some 
C, 
and, 
when 
they 
are 
so, 
that 
A 
should 
not 
belong 
to 
all 
B, 
therefore 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
C, 
and 
A 
to 
no 
C, 
the 
negative 
premiss 
is 
partly 
false, 
the 
other 
premiss 
wholly 
true, 
and 
the 
conclusion 
is 
true. 
Again 
since 
it 
has 
been 
proved 
that 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
C 
and 
B 
to 
some 
C, 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
A 
should 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
if 
the 
premiss 
AC 
is 
wholly 
true, 
and 
the 
premiss 
BC 
partly 
false, 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
conclusion 
should 
be 

true. 
For 
if 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
C, 
and 
B 
to 
all 
C, 
the 
premiss 
AC 
is 
wholly 
true, 
and 
the 
premiss 
BC 
is 
partly 
false. 


(5) 
It 
is 
clear 
also 
in 
the 
case 
of 
particular 
syllogisms 
that 
a 
true 
conclusion 
may 
come 
through 
what 
is 
false, 
in 
every 
possible 
way. 
For 
the 
same 
terms 
must 
be 
taken 
as 
have 
been 
taken 
when 
the 
premisses 
are 
universal, 
positive 
terms 
in 
positive 
syllogisms, 
negative 
terms 
in 
negative. 
For 
it 
makes 
no 
difference 
to 
the 
setting 
out 
of 
the 
terms, 
whether 
one 
assumes 
that 
what 
belongs 
to 
none 
belongs 
to 
all 
or 
that 
what 
belongs 
to 
some 
belongs 
to 
all. 
The 
same 
applies 
to 
negative 
statements. 
It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
if 
the 
conclusion 
is 
false, 
the 
premisses 
of 
the 
argument 
must 
be 
false, 
either 
all 
or 
some 
of 
them; 
but 
when 
the 
conclusion 
is 
true, 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
the 
premisses 
should 
be 
true, 
either 
one 
or 
all, 
yet 
it 
is 
possible, 
though 
no 
part 
of 
the 
syllogism 
is 
true, 
that 
the 
conclusion 
may 
none 
the 
less 
be 
true; 
but 
it 
is 
not 
necessitated. 
The 
reason 
is 
that 
when 
two 
things 
are 
so 
related 
to 
one 
another, 
that 
if 
the 
one 
is, 
the 
other 
necessarily 
is, 
then 
if 
the 
latter 
is 
not, 
the 
former 
will 
not 
be 
either, 
but 
if 
the 
latter 
is, 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
the 
former 
should 
be. 
But 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
the 
same 
thing 
should 
be 
necessitated 
by 
the 
being 
and 
by 
the 
not-being 
of 
the 
same 
thing. 
I 
mean, 
for 
example, 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
B 
should 
necessarily 
be 
great 
since 
A 
is 
white 
and 
that 
B 
should 
necessarily 
be 
great 
since 
A 
is 
not 
white. 
For 
whenever 
since 
this, 
A, 
is 
white 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
that, 
B, 
should 
be 
great, 
and 
since 
B 
is 
great 
that 
C 
should 
not 
be 
white, 
then 
it 
is 
necessary 
if 
is 
white 
that 
C 
should 
not 
be 
white. 
And 
whenever 
it 
is 
necessary, 
since 
one 
of 
two 
things 
is, 
that 
the 
other 
should 
be, 
it 
is 
necessary, 
if 
the 
latter 
is 
not, 
that 
the 
former 
(viz. 
A) 
should 
not 
be. 
If 
then 
B 
is 
not 
great 
A 
cannot 
be 
white. 
But 
if, 
when 
A 
is 
not 
white, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
B 
should 
be 
great, 
it 
necessarily 
results 
that 
if 
B 
is 
not 
great, 
B 
itself 
is 
great. 
(But 
this 
is 
impossible.) 
For 
if 
B 
is 
not 
great, 
A 
will 
necessarily 
not 
be 
white. 
If 
then 
when 
this 
is 
not 
white 
B 
must 
be 
great, 
it 
results 
that 
if 
B 
is 
not 
great, 
it 
is 
great, 
just 
as 
if 
it 
were 
proved 
through 
three 
terms. 


Circular 
and 
reciprocal 
proof 
means 
proof 
by 
means 
of 
the 
conclusion, 
i.e. 
by 
converting 
one 
of 
the 
premisses 
simply 
and 
inferring 
the 
premiss 
which 
was 
assumed 
in 
the 
original 
syllogism: 
e.g. 
suppose 
it 
has 
been 
necessary 
to 
prove 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
it 
has 
been 
proved 
through 
B; 
suppose 
that 



A 
should 
now 
be 
proved 
to 
belong 
to 
B 
by 
assuming 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
C, 
and 
C 
to 
B-so 
A 
belongs 
to 
B: 
but 
in 
the 
first 
syllogism 
the 
converse 
was 
assumed, 
viz. 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
C. 
Or 
suppose 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
prove 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
C, 
and 
A 
is 
assumed 
to 
belong 
to 
C, 
which 
was 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
first 
syllogism, 
and 
B 
to 
belong 
to 
A 
but 
the 
converse 
was 
assumed 
in 
the 
earlier 
syllogism, 
viz. 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
B. 
In 
no 
other 
way 
is 
reciprocal 
proof 
possible. 
If 
another 
term 
is 
taken 
as 
middle, 
the 
proof 
is 
not 
circular: 
for 
neither 
of 
the 
propositions 
assumed 
is 
the 
same 
as 
before: 
if 
one 
of 
the 
accepted 
terms 
is 
taken 
as 
middle, 
only 
one 
of 
the 
premisses 
of 
the 
first 
syllogism 
can 
be 
assumed 
in 
the 
second: 
for 
if 
both 
of 
them 
are 
taken 
the 
same 
conclusion 
as 
before 
will 
result: 
but 
it 
must 
be 
different. 
If 
the 
terms 
are 
not 
convertible, 
one 
of 
the 
premisses 
from 
which 
the 
syllogism 
results 
must 
be 
undemonstrated: 
for 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
demonstrate 
through 
these 
terms 
that 
the 
third 
belongs 
to 
the 
middle 
or 
the 
middle 
to 
the 
first. 
If 
the 
terms 
are 
convertible, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
demonstrate 
everything 
reciprocally, 
e.g. 
if 
A 
and 
B 
and 
C 
are 
convertible 
with 
one 
another. 
Suppose 
the 
proposition 
AC 
has 
been 
demonstrated 
through 
B 
as 
middle 
term, 
and 
again 
the 
proposition 
AB 
through 
the 
conclusion 
and 
the 
premiss 
BC 
converted, 
and 
similarly 
the 
proposition 
BC 
through 
the 
conclusion 
and 
the 
premiss 
AB 
converted. 
But 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
prove 
both 
the 
premiss 
CB, 
and 
the 
premiss 
BA: 
for 
we 
have 
used 
these 
alone 
without 
demonstrating 
them. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
C 
to 
all 
A, 
we 
shall 
have 
a 
syllogism 
relating 
B 
to 
A. 
Again 
if 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
C 
belongs 
to 
all 
A, 
and 
A 
to 
all 
B, 
C 
must 
belong 
to 
all 
B. 
In 
both 
these 
syllogisms 
the 
premiss 
CA 
has 
been 
assumed 
without 
being 
demonstrated: 
the 
other 
premisses 
had 
ex 
hypothesi 
been 
proved. 
Consequently 
if 
we 
succeed 
in 
demonstrating 
this 
premiss, 
all 
the 
premisses 
will 
have 
been 
proved 
reciprocally. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
C 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
all 
A, 
both 
the 
premisses 
assumed 
have 
been 
proved, 
and 
C 
must 
belong 
to 
A. 
It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
only 
if 
the 
terms 
are 
convertible 
is 
circular 
and 
reciprocal 
demonstration 
possible 
(if 
the 
terms 
are 
not 
convertible, 
the 
matter 
stands 
as 
we 
said 
above). 
But 
it 
turns 
out 
in 
these 
also 
that 
we 
use 
for 
the 
demonstration 
the 
very 
thing 
that 
is 
being 
proved: 
for 
C 
is 
proved 
of 
B, 
and 
B 
of 
by 
assuming 
that 
C 
is 
said 
of 
and 
C 
is 
proved 
of 
A 
through 
these 
premisses, 
so 
that 
we 
use 
the 
conclusion 
for 
the 
demonstration. 


In 
negative 
syllogisms 
reciprocal 
proof 
is 
as 
follows. 
Let 
B 
belong 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
A 
to 
none 
of 
the 
Bs: 
we 
conclude 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
none 
of 
the 
Cs. 
If 
again 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
prove 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
none 
of 
the 
Bs 
(which 
was 



previously 
assumed) 
A 
must 
belong 
to 
no 
C, 
and 
C 
to 
all 
B: 
thus 
the 
previous 
premiss 
is 
reversed. 
If 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
prove 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
C, 
the 
proposition 
AB 
must 
no 
longer 
be 
converted 
as 
before: 
for 
the 
premiss 
‘B 
belongs 
to 
no 
A’ 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
premiss 
‘A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B’. 
But 
we 
must 
assume 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
of 
that 
to 
none 
of 
which 
longs. 
Let 
A 
belong 
to 
none 
of 
the 
Cs 
(which 
was 
the 
previous 
conclusion) 
and 
assume 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
of 
that 
to 
none 
of 
which 
A 
belongs. 
It 
is 
necessary 
then 
that 
B 
should 
belong 
to 
all 
C. 
Consequently 
each 
of 
the 
three 
propositions 
has 
been 
made 
a 
conclusion, 
and 
this 
is 
circular 
demonstration, 
to 
assume 
the 
conclusion 
and 
the 
converse 
of 
one 
of 
the 
premisses, 
and 
deduce 
the 
remaining 
premiss. 


In 
particular 
syllogisms 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
universal 
premiss 
through 
the 
other 
propositions, 
but 
the 
particular 
premiss 
can 
be 
demonstrated. 
Clearly 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
universal 
premiss: 
for 
what 
is 
universal 
is 
proved 
through 
propositions 
which 
are 
universal, 
but 
the 
conclusion 
is 
not 
universal, 
and 
the 
proof 
must 
start 
from 
the 
conclusion 
and 
the 
other 
premiss. 
Further 
a 
syllogism 
cannot 
be 
made 
at 
all 
if 
the 
other 
premiss 
is 
converted: 
for 
the 
result 
is 
that 
both 
premisses 
are 
particular. 
But 
the 
particular 
premiss 
may 
be 
proved. 
Suppose 
that 
A 
has 
been 
proved 
of 
some 
C 
through 
B. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
A 
and 
the 
conclusion 
is 
retained, 
B 
will 
belong 
to 
some 
C: 
for 
we 
obtain 
the 
first 
figure 
and 
A 
is 
middle. 
But 
if 
the 
syllogism 
is 
negative, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
prove 
the 
universal 
premiss, 
for 
the 
reason 
given 
above. 
But 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
prove 
the 
particular 
premiss, 
if 
the 
proposition 
AB 
is 
converted 
as 
in 
the 
universal 
syllogism, 
i.e 
‘B 
belongs 
to 
some 
of 
that 
to 
some 
of 
which 
A 
does 
not 
belong’: 
otherwise 
no 
syllogism 
results 
because 
the 
particular 
premiss 
is 
negative. 


In 
the 
second 
figure 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
prove 
an 
affirmative 
proposition 
in 
this 
way, 
but 
a 
negative 
proposition 
may 
be 
proved. 
An 
affirmative 
proposition 
is 
not 
proved 
because 
both 
premisses 
of 
the 
new 
syllogism 
are 
not 
affirmative 
(for 
the 
conclusion 
is 
negative) 
but 
an 
affirmative 
proposition 
is 
(as 
we 
saw) 
proved 
from 
premisses 
which 
are 
both 
affirmative. 
The 
negative 
is 
proved 
as 
follows. 
Let 
A 
belong 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
to 
no 
C: 
we 
conclude 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
no 
C. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
A, 



it 
is 
necessary 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
no 
C: 
for 
we 
get 
the 
second 
figure, 
with 
B 
as 
middle. 
But 
if 
the 
premiss 
AB 
was 
negative, 
and 
the 
other 
affirmative, 
we 
shall 
have 
the 
first 
figure. 
For 
C 
belongs 
to 
all 
A 
and 
B 
to 
no 
C, 
consequently 
B 
belongs 
to 
no 
A: 
neither 
then 
does 
A 
belong 
to 
B. 
Through 
the 
conclusion, 
therefore, 
and 
one 
premiss, 
we 
get 
no 
syllogism, 
but 
if 
another 
premiss 
is 
assumed 
in 
addition, 
a 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible. 
But 
if 
the 
syllogism 
not 
universal, 
the 
universal 
premiss 
cannot 
be 
proved, 
for 
the 
same 
reason 
as 
we 
gave 
above, 
but 
the 
particular 
premiss 
can 
be 
proved 
whenever 
the 
universal 
statement 
is 
affirmative. 
Let 
A 
belong 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
not 
to 
all 
C: 
the 
conclusion 
is 
BC. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
A, 
but 
not 
to 
all 
C, 
A 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C, 
B 
being 
middle. 
But 
if 
the 
universal 
premiss 
is 
negative, 
the 
premiss 
AC 
will 
not 
be 
demonstrated 
by 
the 
conversion 
of 
AB: 
for 
it 
turns 
out 
that 
either 
both 
or 
one 
of 
the 
premisses 
is 
negative; 
consequently 
a 
syllogism 
will 
not 
be 
possible. 
But 
the 
proof 
will 
proceed 
as 
in 
the 
universal 
syllogisms, 
if 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
of 
that 
to 
some 
of 
which 
B 
does 
not 
belong. 


In 
the 
third 
figure, 
when 
both 
premisses 
are 
taken 
universally, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
prove 
them 
reciprocally: 
for 
that 
which 
is 
universal 
is 
proved 
through 
statements 
which 
are 
universal, 
but 
the 
conclusion 
in 
this 
figure 
is 
always 
particular, 
so 
that 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
at 
all 
to 
prove 
through 
this 
figure 
the 
universal 
premiss. 
But 
if 
one 
premiss 
is 
universal, 
the 
other 
particular, 
proof 
of 
the 
latter 
will 
sometimes 
be 
possible, 
sometimes 
not. 
When 
both 
the 
premisses 
assumed 
are 
affirmative, 
and 
the 
universal 
concerns 
the 
minor 
extreme, 
proof 
will 
be 
possible, 
but 
when 
it 
concerns 
the 
other 
extreme, 
impossible. 
Let 
A 
belong 
to 
all 
C 
and 
B 
to 
some 
C: 
the 
conclusion 
is 
the 
statement 
AB. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
C 
belongs 
to 
all 
A, 
it 
has 
been 
proved 
that 
C 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
but 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
some 
C 
has 
not 
been 
proved. 
And 
yet 
it 
is 
necessary, 
if 
C 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
that 
B 
should 
belong 
to 
some 
C. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
the 
same 
that 
this 
should 
belong 
to 
that, 
and 
that 
to 
this: 
but 
we 
must 
assume 
besides 
that 
if 
this 
belongs 
to 
some 
of 
that, 
that 
belongs 
to 
some 
of 
this. 
But 
if 
this 
is 
assumed 
the 
syllogism 
no 
longer 
results 
from 
the 
conclusion 
and 
the 
other 
premiss. 
But 
if 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
A 
to 
some 
C, 
it 
will 
be 
possible 
to 
prove 
the 
proposition 
AC, 
when 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
C 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
A 
to 
some 
B. 
For 
if 
C 
belongs 
to 
all 



B 
and 
A 
to 
some 
B, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
some 
C, 
B 
being 
middle. 
And 
whenever 
one 
premiss 
is 
affirmative 
the 
other 
negative, 
and 
the 
affirmative 
is 
universal, 
the 
other 
premiss 
can 
be 
proved. 
Let 
B 
belong 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
A 
not 
to 
some 
C: 
the 
conclusion 
is 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
further 
that 
C 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
A 
should 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C, 
B 
being 
middle. 
But 
when 
the 
negative 
premiss 
is 
universal, 
the 
other 
premiss 
is 
not 
except 
as 
before, 
viz. 
if 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
that 
belongs 
to 
some 
of 
that, 
to 
some 
of 
which 
this 
does 
not 
belong, 
e.g. 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
C, 
and 
B 
to 
some 
C: 
the 
conclusion 
is 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
C 
belongs 
to 
some 
of 
that 
to 
some 
of 
which 
does 
not 
belong, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
C 
should 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
the 
Bs. 
In 
no 
other 
way 
is 
it 
possible 
by 
converting 
the 
universal 
premiss 
to 
prove 
the 
other: 
for 
in 
no 
other 
way 
can 
a 
syllogism 
be 
formed. 


It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
in 
the 
first 
figure 
reciprocal 
proof 
is 
made 
both 
through 
the 
third 
and 
through 
the 
first 
figure-if 
the 
conclusion 
is 
affirmative 
through 
the 
first; 
if 
the 
conclusion 
is 
negative 
through 
the 
last. 
For 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
that 
belongs 
to 
all 
of 
that 
to 
none 
of 
which 
this 
belongs. 
In 
the 
middle 
figure, 
when 
the 
syllogism 
is 
universal, 
proof 
is 
possible 
through 
the 
second 
figure 
and 
through 
the 
first, 
but 
when 
particular 
through 
the 
second 
and 
the 
last. 
In 
the 
third 
figure 
all 
proofs 
are 
made 
through 
itself. 
It 
is 
clear 
also 
that 
in 
the 
third 
figure 
and 
in 
the 
middle 
figure 
those 
syllogisms 
which 
are 
not 
made 
through 
those 
figures 
themselves 
either 
are 
not 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
circular 
proof 
or 
are 
imperfect. 


To 
convert 
a 
syllogism 
means 
to 
alter 
the 
conclusion 
and 
make 
another 
syllogism 
to 
prove 
that 
either 
the 
extreme 
cannot 
belong 
to 
the 
middle 
or 
the 
middle 
to 
the 
last 
term. 
For 
it 
is 
necessary, 
if 
the 
conclusion 
has 
been 
changed 
into 
its 
opposite 
and 
one 
of 
the 
premisses 
stands, 
that 
the 
other 
premiss 
should 
be 
destroyed. 
For 
if 
it 
should 
stand, 
the 
conclusion 
also 
must 
stand. 
It 
makes 
a 
difference 
whether 
the 
conclusion 
is 
converted 
into 
its 
contradictory 
or 
into 
its 
contrary. 
For 
the 
same 
syllogism 
does 
not 
result 
whichever 
form 
the 
conversion 
takes. 
This 
will 
be 
made 
clear 
by 
the 
sequel. 
By 
contradictory 
opposition 
I 
mean 
the 
opposition 
of 
‘to 
all’ 
to 
‘not 
to 
all’, 
and 
of 
‘to 
some’ 
to 
‘to 
none’; 
by 
contrary 
opposition 
I 
mean 
the 
opposition 
of 
‘to 
all’ 
to 
‘to 
none’, 
and 
of 
‘to 
some’ 
to 
‘not 
to 
some’. 
Suppose 
that 
A 
been 



proved 
of 
C, 
through 
B 
as 
middle 
term. 
If 
then 
it 
should 
be 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
C, 
but 
to 
all 
B, 
B 
will 
belong 
to 
no 
C. 
And 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
C, 
and 
B 
to 
all 
C, 
A 
will 
belong, 
not 
to 
no 
B 
at 
all, 
but 
not 
to 
all 
B. 
For 
(as 
we 
saw) 
the 
universal 
is 
not 
proved 
through 
the 
last 
figure. 
In 
a 
word 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
refute 
universally 
by 
conversion 
the 
premiss 
which 
concerns 
the 
major 
extreme: 
for 
the 
refutation 
always 
proceeds 
through 
the 
third 
since 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
take 
both 
premisses 
in 
reference 
to 
the 
minor 
extreme. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
syllogism 
is 
negative. 
Suppose 
it 
has 
been 
proved 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
C 
through 
B. 
Then 
if 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
to 
no 
B, 
B 
will 
belong 
to 
none 
of 
the 
Cs. 
And 
if 
A 
and 
B 
belong 
to 
all 
C, 
A 
will 
belong 
to 
some 
B: 
but 
in 
the 
original 
premiss 
it 
belonged 
to 
no 
B. 


If 
the 
conclusion 
is 
converted 
into 
its 
contradictory, 
the 
syllogisms 
will 
be 
contradictory 
and 
not 
universal. 
For 
one 
premiss 
is 
particular, 
so 
that 
the 
conclusion 
also 
will 
be 
particular. 
Let 
the 
syllogism 
be 
affirmative, 
and 
let 
it 
be 
converted 
as 
stated. 
Then 
if 
A 
belongs 
not 
to 
all 
C, 
but 
to 
all 
B, 
B 
will 
belong 
not 
to 
all 
C. 
And 
if 
A 
belongs 
not 
to 
all 
C, 
but 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
A 
will 
belong 
not 
to 
all 
B. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
syllogism 
is 
negative. 
For 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
C, 
and 
to 
no 
B, 
B 
will 
belong, 
not 
to 
no 
C 
at 
all, 
but-not 
to 
some 
C. 
And 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
C, 
and 
B 
to 
all 
C, 
as 
was 
originally 
assumed, 
A 
will 
belong 
to 
some 
B. 


In 
particular 
syllogisms 
when 
the 
conclusion 
is 
converted 
into 
its 
contradictory, 
both 
premisses 
may 
be 
refuted, 
but 
when 
it 
is 
converted 
into 
its 
contrary, 
neither. 
For 
the 
result 
is 
no 
longer, 
as 
in 
the 
universal 
syllogisms, 
refutation 
in 
which 
the 
conclusion 
reached 
by 
O, 
conversion 
lacks 
universality, 
but 
no 
refutation 
at 
all. 
Suppose 
that 
A 
has 
been 
proved 
of 
some 


C. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
C, 
and 
B 
to 
some 
C, 
A 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B: 
and 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
C, 
but 
to 
all 
B, 
B 
will 
belong 
to 
no 
C. 
Thus 
both 
premisses 
are 
refuted. 
But 
neither 
can 
be 
refuted 
if 
the 
conclusion 
is 
converted 
into 
its 
contrary. 
For 
if 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C, 
but 
to 
all 
B, 
then 
B 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C. 
But 
the 
original 
premiss 
is 
not 
yet 
refuted: 
for 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
B 
should 
belong 
to 
some 
C, 
and 
should 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C. 
The 
universal 
premiss 
AB 
cannot 
be 
affected 
by 
a 
syllogism 
at 
all: 
for 
if 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
the 
Cs, 
but 
B 
belongs 
to 
some 
of 
the 
Cs, 
neither 
of 
the 
premisses 
is 
universal. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
syllogism 
is 
negative: 
for 
if 
it 
should 
be 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
both 
premisses 
are 
refuted: 
but 
if 
the 
assumption 
is 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
C, 
neither 
premiss 
is 
refuted. 
The 
proof 
is 
the 
same 
as 
before. 

In 
the 
second 
figure 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
refute 
the 
premiss 
which 
concerns 
the 
major 
extreme 
by 
establishing 
something 
contrary 
to 
it, 
whichever 
form 
the 
conversion 
of 
the 
conclusion 
may 
take. 
For 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
refutation 
will 
always 
be 
in 
the 
third 
figure, 
and 
in 
this 
figure 
(as 
we 
saw) 
there 
is 
no 
universal 
syllogism. 
The 
other 
premiss 
can 
be 
refuted 
in 
a 
manner 
similar 
to 
the 
conversion: 
I 
mean, 
if 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
first 
syllogism 
is 
converted 
into 
its 
contrary, 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
refutation 
will 
be 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
minor 
premiss 
of 
the 
first, 
if 
into 
its 
contradictory, 
the 
contradictory. 
Let 
A 
belong 
to 
all 
B 
and 
to 
no 
C: 
conclusion 
BC. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
the 
proposition 
AB 
stands, 
A 
will 
belong 
to 
all 
C, 
since 
the 
first 
figure 
is 
produced. 
If 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
A 
to 
no 
C, 
then 
A 
belongs 
not 
to 
all 
B: 
the 
figure 
is 
the 
last. 
But 
if 
the 
conclusion 
BC 
is 
converted 
into 
its 
contradictory, 
the 
premiss 
AB 
will 
be 
refuted 
as 
before, 
the 
premiss, 
AC 
by 
its 
contradictory. 
For 
if 
B 
belongs 
to 
some 
C, 
and 
A 
to 
no 
C, 
then 
A 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B. 
Again 
if 
B 
belongs 
to 
some 
C, 
and 
A 
to 
all 
B, 
A 
will 
belong 
to 
some 
C, 
so 
that 
the 
syllogism 
results 
in 
the 
contradictory 
of 
the 
minor 
premiss. 
A 
similar 
proof 
can 
be 
given 
if 
the 
premisses 
are 
transposed 
in 
respect 
of 
their 
quality. 


If 
the 
syllogism 
is 
particular, 
when 
the 
conclusion 
is 
converted 
into 
its 
contrary 
neither 
premiss 
can 
be 
refuted, 
as 
also 
happened 
in 
the 
first 
figure,’ 
if 
the 
conclusion 
is 
converted 
into 
its 
contradictory, 
both 
premisses 
can 
be 
refuted. 
Suppose 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
to 
some 
C: 
the 
conclusion 
is 
BC. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
some 
C, 
and 
the 
statement 
AB 
stands, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
be 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C. 
But 
the 
original 
statement 
has 
not 
been 
refuted: 
for 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
some 
C 
and 
also 
not 
to 
some 
C. 
Again 
if 
B 
belongs 
to 
some 
C 
and 
A 
to 
some 
C, 
no 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible: 
for 
neither 
of 
the 
premisses 
taken 
is 
universal. 
Consequently 
the 
proposition 
AB 
is 
not 
refuted. 
But 
if 
the 
conclusion 
is 
converted 
into 
its 
contradictory, 
both 
premisses 
can 
be 
refuted. 
For 
if 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
A 
to 
no 
B, 
A 
will 
belong 
to 
no 
C: 
but 
it 
was 
assumed 
to 
belong 
to 
some 
C. 
Again 
if 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
C 
and 
A 
to 
some 
C, 
A 
will 
belong 
to 
some 
B. 
The 
same 
proof 
can 
be 
given 
if 
the 
universal 
statement 
is 
affirmative. 



In 
the 
third 
figure 
when 
the 
conclusion 
is 
converted 
into 
its 
contrary, 
neither 
of 
the 
premisses 
can 
be 
refuted 
in 
any 
of 
the 
syllogisms, 
but 
when 
the 
conclusion 
is 
converted 
into 
its 
contradictory, 
both 
premisses 
may 
be 
refuted 
and 
in 
all 
the 
moods. 
Suppose 
it 
has 
been 
proved 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
C 
being 
taken 
as 
middle, 
and 
the 
premisses 
being 
universal. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B, 
but 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
no 
syllogism 
is 
formed 
about 
A 
and 
C. 
Nor 
if 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B, 
but 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
will 
a 
syllogism 
be 
possible 
about 
B 
and 
C. 
A 
similar 
proof 
can 
be 
given 
if 
the 
premisses 
are 
not 
universal. 
For 
either 
both 
premisses 
arrived 
at 
by 
the 
conversion 
must 
be 
particular, 
or 
the 
universal 
premiss 
must 
refer 
to 
the 
minor 
extreme. 
But 
we 
found 
that 
no 
syllogism 
is 
possible 
thus 
either 
in 
the 
first 
or 
in 
the 
middle 
figure. 
But 
if 
the 
conclusion 
is 
converted 
into 
its 
contradictory, 
both 
the 
premisses 
can 
be 
refuted. 
For 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
all 
C, 
then 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
C: 
again 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
to 
all 
C, 
B 
belongs 
to 
no 
C. 
And 
similarly 
if 
one 
of 
the 
premisses 
is 
not 
universal. 
For 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
some 
C, 
A 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C: 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
to 
C, 
B 
will 
belong 
to 
no 
C. 


Similarly 
if 
the 
original 
syllogism 
is 
negative. 
Suppose 
it 
has 
been 
proved 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B, 
BC 
being 
affirmative, 
AC 
being 
negative: 
for 
it 
was 
thus 
that, 
as 
we 
saw, 
a 
syllogism 
could 
be 
made. 
Whenever 
then 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
conclusion 
is 
assumed 
a 
syllogism 
will 
not 
be 
possible. 
For 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
all 
C, 
no 
syllogism 
is 
possible 
(as 
we 
saw) 
about 
A 
and 
C. 
Nor, 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
and 
to 
no 
C, 
was 
a 
syllogism 
possible 
concerning 
B 
and 
C. 
Therefore 
the 
premisses 
are 
not 
refuted. 
But 
when 
the 
contradictory 
of 
the 
conclusion 
is 
assumed, 
they 
are 
refuted. 
For 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
C, 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
C: 
but 
A 
was 
supposed 
originally 
to 
belong 
to 
no 
C. 
Again 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
to 
no 
C, 
then 
B 
belongs 
to 
no 
C: 
but 
it 
was 
supposed 
to 
belong 
to 
all 
C. 
A 
similar 
proof 
is 
possible 
if 
the 
premisses 
are 
not 
universal. 
For 
AC 
becomes 
universal 
and 
negative, 
the 
other 
premiss 
particular 
and 
affirmative. 
If 
then 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
some 
C, 
it 
results 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
C: 
but 
it 
was 
supposed 
to 
belong 
to 
no 
C. 
Again 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
to 
no 
C, 
then 
B 
belongs 
to 
no 
C: 
but 
it 
was 
assumed 
to 
belong 
to 
some 
C. 
If 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B 
and 
B 
to 
some 
C, 
no 
syllogism 
results: 
nor 
yet 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
and 
to 
no 
C. 
Thus 
in 
one 
way 
the 
premisses 
are 
refuted, 
in 
the 
other 
way 
they 
are 
not. 


From 
what 
has 
been 
said 
it 
is 
clear 
how 
a 
syllogism 
results 
in 
each 
figure 



when 
the 
conclusion 
is 
converted; 
when 
a 
result 
contrary 
to 
the 
premiss, 
and 
when 
a 
result 
contradictory 
to 
the 
premiss, 
is 
obtained. 
It 
is 
clear 
that 
in 
the 
first 
figure 
the 
syllogisms 
are 
formed 
through 
the 
middle 
and 
the 
last 
figures, 
and 
the 
premiss 
which 
concerns 
the 
minor 
extreme 
is 
alway 
refuted 
through 
the 
middle 
figure, 
the 
premiss 
which 
concerns 
the 
major 
through 
the 
last 
figure. 
In 
the 
second 
figure 
syllogisms 
proceed 
through 
the 
first 
and 
the 
last 
figures, 
and 
the 
premiss 
which 
concerns 
the 
minor 
extreme 
is 
always 
refuted 
through 
the 
first 
figure, 
the 
premiss 
which 
concerns 
the 
major 
extreme 
through 
the 
last. 
In 
the 
third 
figure 
the 
refutation 
proceeds 
through 
the 
first 
and 
the 
middle 
figures; 
the 
premiss 
which 
concerns 
the 
major 
is 
always 
refuted 
through 
the 
first 
figure, 
the 
premiss 
which 
concerns 
the 
minor 
through 
the 
middle 
figure. 


It 
is 
clear 
then 
what 
conversion 
is, 
how 
it 
is 
effected 
in 
each 
figure, 
and 
what 
syllogism 
results. 
The 
syllogism 
per 
impossibile 
is 
proved 
when 
the 
contradictory 
of 
the 
conclusion 
stated 
and 
another 
premiss 
is 
assumed; 
it 
can 
be 
made 
in 
all 
the 
figures. 
For 
it 
resembles 
conversion, 
differing 
only 
in 
this: 
conversion 
takes 
place 
after 
a 
syllogism 
has 
been 
formed 
and 
both 
the 
premisses 
have 
been 
taken, 
but 
a 
reduction 
to 
the 
impossible 
takes 
place 
not 
because 
the 
contradictory 
has 
been 
agreed 
to 
already, 
but 
because 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
it 
is 
true. 
The 
terms 
are 
alike 
in 
both, 
and 
the 
premisses 
of 
both 
are 
taken 
in 
the 
same 
way. 
For 
example 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
C 
being 
middle, 
then 
if 
it 
is 
supposed 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
all 
B 
or 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
but 
to 
all 
C 
(which 
was 
admitted 
to 
be 
true), 
it 
follows 
that 
C 
belongs 
to 
no 
B 
or 
not 
to 
all 


B. 
But 
this 
is 
impossible: 
consequently 
the 
supposition 
is 
false: 
its 
contradictory 
then 
is 
true. 
Similarly 
in 
the 
other 
figures: 
for 
whatever 
moods 
admit 
of 
conversion 
admit 
also 
of 
the 
reduction 
per 
impossibile. 
All 
the 
problems 
can 
be 
proved 
per 
impossibile 
in 
all 
the 
figures, 
excepting 
the 
universal 
affirmative, 
which 
is 
proved 
in 
the 
middle 
and 
third 
figures, 
but 
not 
in 
the 
first. 
Suppose 
that 
A 
belongs 
not 
to 
all 
B, 
or 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
take 
besides 
another 
premiss 
concerning 
either 
of 
the 
terms, 
viz. 
that 
C 
belongs 
to 
all 
A, 
or 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
D; 
thus 
we 
get 
the 
first 
figure. 
If 
then 
it 
is 
supposed 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
all 
B, 
no 
syllogism 
results 
whichever 
term 
the 
assumed 
premiss 
concerns; 
but 
if 
it 
is 
supposed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
when 
the 
premiss 
BD 
is 
assumed 
as 
well 
we 
shall 
prove 
syllogistically 



what 
is 
false, 
but 
not 
the 
problem 
proposed. 
For 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
D, 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
D. 
Let 
this 
be 
impossible: 
it 
is 
false 
then 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B. 
But 
the 
universal 
affirmative 
is 
not 
necessarily 
true 
if 
the 
universal 
negative 
is 
false. 
But 
if 
the 
premiss 
CA 
is 
assumed 
as 
well, 
no 
syllogism 
results, 
nor 
does 
it 
do 
so 
when 
it 
is 
supposed 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
all 
B. 
Consequently 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
universal 
affirmative 
cannot 
be 
proved 
in 
the 
first 
figure 
per 
impossibile. 


But 
the 
particular 
affirmative 
and 
the 
universal 
and 
particular 
negatives 
can 
all 
be 
proved. 
Suppose 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
let 
it 
have 
been 
assumed 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
or 
to 
some 
C. 
Then 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
no 
C 
or 
not 
to 
all 
C. 
But 
this 
is 
impossible 
(for 
let 
it 
be 
true 
and 
clear 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
C): 
consequently 
if 
this 
is 
false, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
some 
B. 
But 
if 
the 
other 
premiss 
assumed 
relates 
to 
A, 
no 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible. 
Nor 
can 
a 
conclusion 
be 
drawn 
when 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
conclusion 
is 
supposed, 
e.g. 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B. 
Clearly 
then 
we 
must 
suppose 
the 
contradictory. 


Again 
suppose 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
and 
let 
it 
have 
been 
assumed 
that 
C 
belongs 
to 
all 
A. 
It 
is 
necessary 
then 
that 
C 
should 
belong 
to 
some 
B. 
But 
let 
this 
be 
impossible, 
so 
that 
the 
supposition 
is 
false: 
in 
that 
case 
it 
is 
true 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B. 
We 
may 
proceed 
in 
the 
same 
way 
if 
the 
proposition 
CA 
has 
been 
taken 
as 
negative. 
But 
if 
the 
premiss 
assumed 
concerns 
B, 
no 
syllogism 
will 
be 
possible. 
If 
the 
contrary 
is 
supposed, 
we 
shall 
have 
a 
syllogism 
and 
an 
impossible 
conclusion, 
but 
the 
problem 
in 
hand 
is 
not 
proved. 
Suppose 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
let 
it 
have 
been 
assumed 
that 
C 
belongs 
to 
all 
A. 
It 
is 
necessary 
then 
that 
C 
should 
belong 
to 
all 
B. 
But 
this 
is 
impossible, 
so 
that 
it 
is 
false 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B. 
But 
we 
have 
not 
yet 
shown 
it 
to 
be 
necessary 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
if 
it 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
all 
B. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
other 
premiss 
taken 
concerns 
B; 
we 
shall 
have 
a 
syllogism 
and 
a 
conclusion 
which 
is 
impossible, 
but 
the 
hypothesis 
is 
not 
refuted. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
the 
contradictory 
that 
we 
must 
suppose. 


To 
prove 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
all 
B, 
we 
must 
suppose 
that 
it 
belongs 
to 
all 
B: 
for 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
C 
to 
all 
A, 
then 
C 
belongs 
to 
all 
B; 
so 
that 
if 
this 
is 
impossible, 
the 
hypothesis 
is 
false. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
other 
premiss 
assumed 
concerns 
B. 
The 
same 
results 
if 
the 
original 
proposition 
CA 
was 
negative: 
for 
thus 
also 
we 
get 
a 
syllogism. 
But 
if 
the 
negative 
proposition 
concerns 
B, 
nothing 
is 
proved. 
If 
the 
hypothesis 
is 
that 
A 
belongs 
not 
to 
all 
but 
to 
some 
B, 
it 
is 
not 
proved 
that 
A 
belongs 
not 
to 
all 
B, 
but 
that 
it 
belongs 



to 
no 
B. 
For 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
and 
C 
to 
all 
A, 
then 
C 
will 
belong 
to 
some 
B. 
If 
then 
this 
is 
impossible, 
it 
is 
false 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B; 
consequently 
it 
is 
true 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B. 
But 
if 
this 
is 
proved, 
the 
truth 
is 
refuted 
as 
well; 
for 
the 
original 
conclusion 
was 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
and 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B. 
Further 
the 
impossible 
does 
not 
result 
from 
the 
hypothesis: 
for 
then 
the 
hypothesis 
would 
be 
false, 
since 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
draw 
a 
false 
conclusion 
from 
true 
premisses: 
but 
in 
fact 
it 
is 
true: 
for 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B. 
Consequently 
we 
must 
not 
suppose 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
but 
that 
it 
belongs 
to 
all 
B. 
Similarly 
if 
we 
should 
be 
proving 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B: 
for 
if 
‘not 
to 
belong 
to 
some’ 
and 
‘to 
belong 
not 
to 
all’ 
have 
the 
same 
meaning, 
the 
demonstration 
of 
both 
will 
be 
identical. 


It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
not 
the 
contrary 
but 
the 
contradictory 
ought 
to 
be 
supposed 
in 
all 
the 
syllogisms. 
For 
thus 
we 
shall 
have 
necessity 
of 
inference, 
and 
the 
claim 
we 
make 
is 
one 
that 
will 
be 
generally 
accepted. 
For 
if 
of 
everything 
one 
or 
other 
of 
two 
contradictory 
statements 
holds 
good, 
then 
if 
it 
is 
proved 
that 
the 
negation 
does 
not 
hold, 
the 
affirmation 
must 
be 
true. 
Again 
if 
it 
is 
not 
admitted 
that 
the 
affirmation 
is 
true, 
the 
claim 
that 
the 
negation 
is 
true 
will 
be 
generally 
accepted. 
But 
in 
neither 
way 
does 
it 
suit 
to 
maintain 
the 
contrary: 
for 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
if 
the 
universal 
negative 
is 
false, 
the 
universal 
affirmative 
should 
be 
true, 
nor 
is 
it 
generally 
accepted 
that 
if 
the 
one 
is 
false 
the 
other 
is 
true. 


It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
in 
the 
first 
figure 
all 
problems 
except 
the 
universal 
affirmative 
are 
proved 
per 
impossibile. 
But 
in 
the 
middle 
and 
the 
last 
figures 
this 
also 
is 
proved. 
Suppose 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
let 
it 
have 
been 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
C. 
If 
then 
A 
belongs 
not 
to 
all 
B, 
but 
to 
all 
C, 
C 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
all 
B. 
But 
this 
is 
impossible 
(for 
suppose 
it 
to 
be 
clear 
that 
C 
belongs 
to 
all 
B): 
consequently 
the 
hypothesis 
is 
false. 
It 
is 
true 
then 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B. 
But 
if 
the 
contrary 
is 
supposed, 
we 
shall 
have 
a 
syllogism 
and 
a 
result 
which 
is 
impossible: 
but 
the 
problem 
in 
hand 
is 
not 
proved. 
For 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
to 
all 
C, 
C 
will 
belong 
to 
no 
B. 
This 
is 
impossible; 
so 
that 
it 
is 
false 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B. 
But 
though 
this 
is 
false, 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
it 
is 
true 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B. 


When 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
suppose 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
let 
A 
belong 
to 
all 
C. 
It 
is 
necessary 
then 
that 
C 
should 
belong 
to 
no 
B. 



Consequently, 
if 
this 
is 
impossible, 
A 
must 
belong 
to 
some 
B. 
But 
if 
it 
is 
supposed 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B, 
we 
shall 
have 
the 
same 
results 
as 
in 
the 
first 
figure. 


Again 
suppose 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
and 
let 
A 
belong 
to 
no 
C. 
It 
is 
necessary 
then 
that 
C 
should 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B. 
But 
originally 
it 
belonged 
to 
all 
B, 
consequently 
the 
hypothesis 
is 
false: 
A 
then 
will 
belong 
to 
no 
B. 


When 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
an 
B, 
suppose 
it 
does 
belong 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
to 
no 


C. 
It 
is 
necessary 
then 
that 
C 
should 
belong 
to 
no 
B. 
But 
this 
is 
impossible: 
so 
that 
it 
is 
true 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
all 
B. 
It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
all 
the 
syllogisms 
can 
be 
formed 
in 
the 
middle 
figure. 
Similarly 
they 
can 
all 
be 
formed 
in 
the 
last 
figure. 
Suppose 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B, 
but 
C 
belongs 
to 
all 
B: 
then 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
C. 
If 
then 
this 
is 
impossible, 
it 
is 
false 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B; 
so 
that 
it 
is 
true 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B. 
But 
if 
it 
is 
supposed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
we 
shall 
have 
a 
syllogism 
and 
a 
conclusion 
which 
is 
impossible: 
but 
the 
problem 
in 
hand 
is 
not 
proved: 
for 
if 
the 
contrary 
is 
supposed, 
we 
shall 
have 
the 
same 
results 
as 
before. 


But 
to 
prove 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
this 
hypothesis 
must 
be 
made. 
If 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
C 
to 
some 
B, 
A 
will 
belong 
not 
to 
all 
C. 
If 
then 
this 
is 
false, 
it 
is 
true 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B. 


When 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
suppose 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
and 
let 
it 
have 
been 
assumed 
that 
C 
belongs 
to 
all 
B. 
Then 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
some 
C. 
But 
ex 
hypothesi 
it 
belongs 
to 
no 
C, 
so 
that 
it 
is 
false 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B. 
But 
if 
it 
is 
supposed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
the 
problem 
is 
not 
proved. 


But 
this 
hypothesis 
must 
be 
made 
if 
we 
are 
prove 
that 
A 
belongs 
not 
to 
all 


B. 
For 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B 
and 
C 
to 
some 
B, 
then 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
C. 
But 
this 
we 
assumed 
not 
to 
be 
so, 
so 
it 
is 
false 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B. 
But 
in 
that 
case 
it 
is 
true 
that 
A 
belongs 
not 
to 
all 
B. 
If 
however 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
we 
shall 
have 
the 
same 
result 
as 
before. 
It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
in 
all 
the 
syllogisms 
which 
proceed 
per 
impossibile 
the 
contradictory 
must 
be 
assumed. 
And 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
in 
the 
middle 
figure 
an 
affirmative 
conclusion, 
and 
in 
the 
last 
figure 
a 
universal 
conclusion, 
are 
proved 
in 
a 
way. 



Demonstration 
per 
impossibile 
differs 
from 
ostensive 
proof 
in 
that 
it 
posits 
what 
it 
wishes 
to 
refute 
by 
reduction 
to 
a 
statement 
admitted 
to 
be 
false; 
whereas 
ostensive 
proof 
starts 
from 
admitted 
positions. 
Both, 
indeed, 
take 
two 
premisses 
that 
are 
admitted, 
but 
the 
latter 
takes 
the 
premisses 
from 
which 
the 
syllogism 
starts, 
the 
former 
takes 
one 
of 
these, 
along 
with 
the 
contradictory 
of 
the 
original 
conclusion. 
Also 
in 
the 
ostensive 
proof 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
the 
conclusion 
should 
be 
known, 
nor 
that 
one 
should 
suppose 
beforehand 
that 
it 
is 
true 
or 
not: 
in 
the 
other 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
suppose 
beforehand 
that 
it 
is 
not 
true. 
It 
makes 
no 
difference 
whether 
the 
conclusion 
is 
affirmative 
or 
negative; 
the 
method 
is 
the 
same 
in 
both 
cases. 
Everything 
which 
is 
concluded 
ostensively 
can 
be 
proved 
per 
impossibile, 
and 
that 
which 
is 
proved 
per 
impossibile 
can 
be 
proved 
ostensively, 
through 
the 
same 
terms. 
Whenever 
the 
syllogism 
is 
formed 
in 
the 
first 
figure, 
the 
truth 
will 
be 
found 
in 
the 
middle 
or 
the 
last 
figure, 
if 
negative 
in 
the 
middle, 
if 
affirmative 
in 
the 
last. 
Whenever 
the 
syllogism 
is 
formed 
in 
the 
middle 
figure, 
the 
truth 
will 
be 
found 
in 
the 
first, 
whatever 
the 
problem 
may 
be. 
Whenever 
the 
syllogism 
is 
formed 
in 
the 
last 
figure, 
the 
truth 
will 
be 
found 
in 
the 
first 
and 
middle 
figures, 
if 
affirmative 
in 
first, 
if 
negative 
in 
the 
middle. 
Suppose 
that 
A 
has 
been 
proved 
to 
belong 
to 
no 
B, 
or 
not 
to 
all 
B, 
through 
the 
first 
figure. 
Then 
the 
hypothesis 
must 
have 
been 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
and 
the 
original 
premisses 
that 
C 
belongs 
to 
all 
A 
and 
to 
no 
B. 
For 
thus 
the 
syllogism 
was 
made 
and 
the 
impossible 
conclusion 
reached. 
But 
this 
is 
the 
middle 
figure, 
if 
C 
belongs 
to 
all 
A 
and 
to 
no 
B. 
And 
it 
is 
clear 
from 
these 
premisses 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B. 
Similarly 
if 
has 
been 
proved 
not 
to 
belong 
to 
all 
B. 
For 
the 
hypothesis 
is 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B; 
and 
the 
original 
premisses 
are 
that 
C 
belongs 
to 
all 
A 
but 
not 
to 
all 
B. 
Similarly 
too, 
if 
the 
premiss 
CA 
should 
be 
negative: 
for 
thus 
also 
we 
have 
the 
middle 
figure. 
Again 
suppose 
it 
has 
been 
proved 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B. 
The 
hypothesis 
here 
is 
that 
is 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B; 
and 
the 
original 
premisses 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
A 
either 
to 
all 
or 
to 
some 
C: 
for 
in 
this 
way 
we 
shall 
get 
what 
is 
impossible. 
But 
if 
A 
and 
B 
belong 
to 
all 
C, 
we 
have 
the 
last 
figure. 
And 
it 
is 
clear 
from 
these 
premisses 
that 
A 
must 
belong 
to 
some 
B. 
Similarly 
if 
B 
or 
A 
should 
be 
assumed 
to 
belong 
to 
some 
C. 


Again 
suppose 
it 
has 
been 
proved 
in 
the 
middle 
figure 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 


B. 
Then 
the 
hypothesis 
must 
have 
been 
that 
A 
belongs 
not 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
the 

original 
premisses 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
C 
to 
all 
B: 
for 
thus 
we 
shall 
get 
what 
is 
impossible. 
But 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
C 
to 
all 
B, 
we 
have 
the 
first 
figure. 
Similarly 
if 
it 
has 
been 
proved 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B: 
for 
the 
hypothesis 
then 
must 
have 
been 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
the 
original 
premisses 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
C 
to 
some 
B. 
If 
the 
syllogism 
is 
negative, 
the 
hypothesis 
must 
have 
been 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
and 
the 
original 
premisses 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
C, 
and 
C 
to 
all 
B, 
so 
that 
the 
first 
figure 
results. 
If 
the 
syllogism 
is 
not 
universal, 
but 
proof 
has 
been 
given 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
B, 
we 
may 
infer 
in 
the 
same 
way. 
The 
hypothesis 
is 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
the 
original 
premisses 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
C, 
and 
C 
belongs 
to 
some 
B: 
for 
thus 
we 
get 
the 
first 
figure. 


Again 
suppose 
it 
has 
been 
proved 
in 
the 
third 
figure 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 


B. 
Then 
the 
hypothesis 
must 
have 
been 
that 
A 
belongs 
not 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
the 
original 
premisses 
that 
C 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
C; 
for 
thus 
we 
shall 
get 
what 
is 
impossible. 
And 
the 
original 
premisses 
form 
the 
first 
figure. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
demonstration 
establishes 
a 
particular 
proposition: 
the 
hypothesis 
then 
must 
have 
been 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
the 
original 
premisses 
that 
C 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
and 
A 
to 
all 
C. 
If 
the 
syllogism 
is 
negative, 
the 
hypothesis 
must 
have 
been 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
some 
B, 
and 
the 
original 
premisses 
that 
C 
belongs 
to 
no 
A 
and 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
this 
is 
the 
middle 
figure. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
demonstration 
is 
not 
universal. 
The 
hypothesis 
will 
then 
be 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
the 
premisses 
that 
C 
belongs 
to 
no 
A 
and 
to 
some 
B: 
and 
this 
is 
the 
middle 
figure. 
It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
through 
the 
same 
terms 
to 
prove 
each 
of 
the 
problems 
ostensively 
as 
well. 
Similarly 
it 
will 
be 
possible 
if 
the 
syllogisms 
are 
ostensive 
to 
reduce 
them 
ad 
impossibile 
in 
the 
terms 
which 
have 
been 
taken, 
whenever 
the 
contradictory 
of 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
ostensive 
syllogism 
is 
taken 
as 
a 
premiss. 
For 
the 
syllogisms 
become 
identical 
with 
those 
which 
are 
obtained 
by 
means 
of 
conversion, 
so 
that 
we 
obtain 
immediately 
the 
figures 
through 
which 
each 
problem 
will 
be 
solved. 
It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
every 
thesis 
can 
be 
proved 
in 
both 
ways, 
i.e. 
per 
impossibile 
and 
ostensively, 
and 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
separate 
one 
method 
from 
the 
other. 


In 
what 
figure 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
draw 
a 
conclusion 
from 
premisses 
which 
are 
opposed, 
and 
in 
what 
figure 
this 
is 
not 
possible, 
will 
be 
made 
clear 
in 
this 



way. 
Verbally 
four 
kinds 
of 
opposition 
are 
possible, 
viz. 
universal 
affirmative 
to 
universal 
negative, 
universal 
affirmative 
to 
particular 
negative, 
particular 
affirmative 
to 
universal 
negative, 
and 
particular 
affirmative 
to 
particular 
negative: 
but 
really 
there 
are 
only 
three: 
for 
the 
particular 
affirmative 
is 
only 
verbally 
opposed 
to 
the 
particular 
negative. 
Of 
the 
genuine 
opposites 
I 
call 
those 
which 
are 
universal 
contraries, 
the 
universal 
affirmative 
and 
the 
universal 
negative, 
e.g. 
‘every 
science 
is 
good’, 
‘no 
science 
is 
good’; 
the 
others 
I 
call 
contradictories. 


In 
the 
first 
figure 
no 
syllogism 
whether 
affirmative 
or 
negative 
can 
be 
made 
out 
of 
opposed 
premisses: 
no 
affirmative 
syllogism 
is 
possible 
because 
both 
premisses 
must 
be 
affirmative, 
but 
opposites 
are, 
the 
one 
affirmative, 
the 
other 
negative: 
no 
negative 
syllogism 
is 
possible 
because 
opposites 
affirm 
and 
deny 
the 
same 
predicate 
of 
the 
same 
subject, 
and 
the 
middle 
term 
in 
the 
first 
figure 
is 
not 
predicated 
of 
both 
extremes, 
but 
one 
thing 
is 
denied 
of 
it, 
and 
it 
is 
affirmed 
of 
something 
else: 
but 
such 
premisses 
are 
not 
opposed. 


In 
the 
middle 
figure 
a 
syllogism 
can 
be 
made 
both 
oLcontradictories 
and 
of 
contraries. 
Let 
A 
stand 
for 
good, 
let 
B 
and 
C 
stand 
for 
science. 
If 
then 
one 
assumes 
that 
every 
science 
is 
good, 
and 
no 
science 
is 
good, 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B 
and 
to 
no 
C, 
so 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
no 
C: 
no 
science 
then 
is 
a 
science. 
Similarly 
if 
after 
taking 
‘every 
science 
is 
good’ 
one 
took 
‘the 
science 
of 
medicine 
is 
not 
good’; 
for 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B 
but 
to 
no 
C, 
so 
that 
a 
particular 
science 
will 
not 
be 
a 
science. 
Again, 
a 
particular 
science 
will 
not 
be 
a 
science 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
C 
but 
to 
no 
B, 
and 
B 
is 
science, 
C 
medicine, 
and 
A 
supposition: 
for 
after 
taking 
‘no 
science 
is 
supposition’, 
one 
has 
assumed 
that 
a 
particular 
science 
is 
supposition. 
This 
syllogism 
differs 
from 
the 
preceding 
because 
the 
relations 
between 
the 
terms 
are 
reversed: 
before, 
the 
affirmative 
statement 
concerned 
B, 
now 
it 
concerns 
C. 
Similarly 
if 
one 
premiss 
is 
not 
universal: 
for 
the 
middle 
term 
is 
always 
that 
which 
is 
stated 
negatively 
of 
one 
extreme, 
and 
affirmatively 
of 
the 
other. 
Consequently 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
contradictories 
may 
lead 
to 
a 
conclusion, 
though 
not 
always 
or 
in 
every 
mood, 
but 
only 
if 
the 
terms 
subordinate 
to 
the 
middle 
are 
such 
that 
they 
are 
either 
identical 
or 
related 
as 
whole 
to 
part. 
Otherwise 
it 
is 
impossible: 
for 
the 
premisses 
cannot 
anyhow 
be 
either 
contraries 
or 
contradictories. 


In 
the 
third 
figure 
an 
affirmative 
syllogism 
can 
never 
be 
made 
out 
of 
opposite 
premisses, 
for 
the 
reason 
given 
in 
reference 
to 
the 
first 
figure; 
but 
a 
negative 
syllogism 
is 
possible 
whether 
the 
terms 
are 
universal 
or 
not. 
Let 
B 
and 
C 
stand 
for 
science, 
A 
for 
medicine. 
If 
then 
one 
should 
assume 
that 
all 



medicine 
is 
science 
and 
that 
no 
medicine 
is 
science, 
he 
has 
assumed 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
all 
A 
and 
C 
to 
no 
A, 
so 
that 
a 
particular 
science 
will 
not 
be 
a 
science. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
premiss 
BA 
is 
not 
assumed 
universally. 
For 
if 
some 
medicine 
is 
science 
and 
again 
no 
medicine 
is 
science, 
it 
results 
that 
some 
science 
is 
not 
science, 
The 
premisses 
are 
contrary 
if 
the 
terms 
are 
taken 
universally; 
if 
one 
is 
particular, 
they 
are 
contradictory. 


We 
must 
recognize 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
take 
opposites 
in 
the 
way 
we 
said, 
viz. 
‘all 
science 
is 
good’ 
and 
‘no 
science 
is 
good’ 
or 
‘some 
science 
is 
not 
good’. 
This 
does 
not 
usually 
escape 
notice. 
But 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
establish 
one 
part 
of 
a 
contradiction 
through 
other 
premisses, 
or 
to 
assume 
it 
in 
the 
way 
suggested 
in 
the 
Topics. 
Since 
there 
are 
three 
oppositions 
to 
affirmative 
statements, 
it 
follows 
that 
opposite 
statements 
may 
be 
assumed 
as 
premisses 
in 
six 
ways; 
we 
may 
have 
either 
universal 
affirmative 
and 
negative, 
or 
universal 
affirmative 
and 
particular 
negative, 
or 
particular 
affirmative 
and 
universal 
negative, 
and 
the 
relations 
between 
the 
terms 
may 
be 
reversed; 
e.g. 
A 
may 
belong 
to 
all 
B 
and 
to 
no 
C, 
or 
to 
all 
C 
and 
to 
no 
B, 
or 
to 
all 
of 
the 
one, 
not 
to 
all 
of 
the 
other; 
here 
too 
the 
relation 
between 
the 
terms 
may 
be 
reversed. 
Similarly 
in 
the 
third 
figure. 
So 
it 
is 
clear 
in 
how 
many 
ways 
and 
in 
what 
figures 
a 
syllogism 
can 
be 
made 
by 
means 
of 
premisses 
which 
are 
opposed. 


It 
is 
clear 
too 
that 
from 
false 
premisses 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
draw 
a 
true 
conclusion, 
as 
has 
been 
said 
before, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
if 
the 
premisses 
are 
opposed. 
For 
the 
syllogism 
is 
always 
contrary 
to 
the 
fact, 
e.g. 
if 
a 
thing 
is 
good, 
it 
is 
proved 
that 
it 
is 
not 
good, 
if 
an 
animal, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
an 
animal 
because 
the 
syllogism 
springs 
out 
of 
a 
contradiction 
and 
the 
terms 
presupposed 
are 
either 
identical 
or 
related 
as 
whole 
and 
part. 
It 
is 
evident 
also 
that 
in 
fallacious 
reasonings 
nothing 
prevents 
a 
contradiction 
to 
the 
hypothesis 
from 
resulting, 
e.g. 
if 
something 
is 
odd, 
it 
is 
not 
odd. 
For 
the 
syllogism 
owed 
its 
contrariety 
to 
its 
contradictory 
premisses; 
if 
we 
assume 
such 
premisses 
we 
shall 
get 
a 
result 
that 
contradicts 
our 
hypothesis. 
But 
we 
must 
recognize 
that 
contraries 
cannot 
be 
inferred 
from 
a 
single 
syllogism 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
we 
conclude 
that 
what 
is 
not 
good 
is 
good, 
or 
anything 
of 
that 
sort 
unless 
a 
self-contradictory 
premiss 
is 
at 
once 
assumed, 
e.g. 
‘every 
animal 
is 
white 
and 
not 
white’, 
and 
we 
proceed 
‘man 
is 
an 
animal’. 
Either 
we 
must 
introduce 
the 
contradiction 
by 
an 
additional 
assumption, 
assuming, 
e.g., 
that 
every 
science 
is 
supposition, 
and 
then 
assuming 
‘Medicine 
is 
a 
science, 
but 
none 
of 
it 
is 
supposition’ 
(which 
is 
the 
mode 
in 
which 
refutations 
are 
made), 



or 
we 
must 
argue 
from 
two 
syllogisms. 
In 
no 
other 
way 
than 
this, 
as 
was 
said 
before, 
is 
it 
possible 
that 
the 
premisses 
should 
be 
really 
contrary. 


To 
beg 
and 
assume 
the 
original 
question 
is 
a 
species 
of 
failure 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
problem 
proposed; 
but 
this 
happens 
in 
many 
ways. 
A 
man 
may 
not 
reason 
syllogistically 
at 
all, 
or 
he 
may 
argue 
from 
premisses 
which 
are 
less 
known 
or 
equally 
unknown, 
or 
he 
may 
establish 
the 
antecedent 
by 
means 
of 
its 
consequents; 
for 
demonstration 
proceeds 
from 
what 
is 
more 
certain 
and 
is 
prior. 
Now 
begging 
the 
question 
is 
none 
of 
these: 
but 
since 
we 
get 
to 
know 
some 
things 
naturally 
through 
themselves, 
and 
other 
things 
by 
means 
of 
something 
else 
(the 
first 
principles 
through 
themselves, 
what 
is 
subordinate 
to 
them 
through 
something 
else), 
whenever 
a 
man 
tries 
to 
prove 
what 
is 
not 
self-evident 
by 
means 
of 
itself, 
then 
he 
begs 
the 
original 
question. 
This 
may 
be 
done 
by 
assuming 
what 
is 
in 
question 
at 
once; 
it 
is 
also 
possible 
to 
make 
a 
transition 
to 
other 
things 
which 
would 
naturally 
be 
proved 
through 
the 
thesis 
proposed, 
and 
demonstrate 
it 
through 
them, 
e.g. 
if 
A 
should 
be 
proved 
through 
B, 
and 
B 
through 
C, 
though 
it 
was 
natural 
that 
C 
should 
be 
proved 
through 
A: 
for 
it 
turns 
out 
that 
those 
who 
reason 
thus 
are 
proving 
A 
by 
means 
of 
itself. 
This 
is 
what 
those 
persons 
do 
who 
suppose 
that 
they 
are 
constructing 
parallel 
straight 
lines: 
for 
they 
fail 
to 
see 
that 
they 
are 
assuming 
facts 
which 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
demonstrate 
unless 
the 
parallels 
exist. 
So 
it 
turns 
out 
that 
those 
who 
reason 
thus 
merely 
say 
a 
particular 
thing 
is, 
if 
it 
is: 
in 
this 
way 
everything 
will 
be 
self-evident. 
But 
that 
is 
impossible. 


If 
then 
it 
is 
uncertain 
whether 
A 
belongs 
to 
C, 
and 
also 
whether 
A 
belongs 
to 
B, 
and 
if 
one 
should 
assume 
that 
A 
does 
belong 
to 
B, 
it 
is 
not 
yet 
clear 
whether 
he 
begs 
the 
original 
question, 
but 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
he 
is 
not 
demonstrating: 
for 
what 
is 
as 
uncertain 
as 
the 
question 
to 
be 
answered 
cannot 
be 
a 
principle 
of 
a 
demonstration. 
If 
however 
B 
is 
so 
related 
to 
C 
that 
they 
are 
identical, 
or 
if 
they 
are 
plainly 
convertible, 
or 
the 
one 
belongs 
to 
the 
other, 
the 
original 
question 
is 
begged. 
For 
one 
might 
equally 
well 
prove 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
B 
through 
those 
terms 
if 
they 
are 
convertible. 
But 
if 
they 
are 
not 
convertible, 
it 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
are 
not 
that 
prevents 
such 
a 
demonstration, 
not 
the 
method 
of 
demonstrating. 
But 
if 
one 
were 
to 
make 
the 
conversion, 
then 
he 
would 
be 
doing 
what 
we 
have 
described 
and 
effecting 
a 
reciprocal 
proof 
with 
three 
propositions. 



Similarly 
if 
he 
should 
assume 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
C, 
this 
being 
as 
uncertain 
as 
the 
question 
whether 
A 
belongs 
to 
C, 
the 
question 
is 
not 
yet 
begged, 
but 
no 
demonstration 
is 
made. 
If 
however 
A 
and 
B 
are 
identical 
either 
because 
they 
are 
convertible 
or 
because 
A 
follows 
B, 
then 
the 
question 
is 
begged 
for 
the 
same 
reason 
as 
before. 
For 
we 
have 
explained 
the 
meaning 
of 
begging 
the 
question, 
viz. 
proving 
that 
which 
is 
not 
self-evident 
by 
means 
of 
itself. 


If 
then 
begging 
the 
question 
is 
proving 
what 
is 
not 
self-evident 
by 
means 
of 
itself, 
in 
other 
words 
failing 
to 
prove 
when 
the 
failure 
is 
due 
to 
the 
thesis 
to 
be 
proved 
and 
the 
premiss 
through 
which 
it 
is 
proved 
being 
equally 
uncertain, 
either 
because 
predicates 
which 
are 
identical 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
subject, 
or 
because 
the 
same 
predicate 
belongs 
to 
subjects 
which 
are 
identical, 
the 
question 
may 
be 
begged 
in 
the 
middle 
and 
third 
figures 
in 
both 
ways, 
though, 
if 
the 
syllogism 
is 
affirmative, 
only 
in 
the 
third 
and 
first 
figures. 
If 
the 
syllogism 
is 
negative, 
the 
question 
is 
begged 
when 
identical 
predicates 
are 
denied 
of 
the 
same 
subject; 
and 
both 
premisses 
do 
not 
beg 
the 
question 
indifferently 
(in 
a 
similar 
way 
the 
question 
may 
be 
begged 
in 
the 
middle 
figure), 
because 
the 
terms 
in 
negative 
syllogisms 
are 
not 
convertible. 
In 
scientific 
demonstrations 
the 
question 
is 
begged 
when 
the 
terms 
are 
really 
related 
in 
the 
manner 
described, 
in 
dialectical 
arguments 
when 
they 
are 
according 
to 
common 
opinion 
so 
related. 


The 
objection 
that 
‘this 
is 
not 
the 
reason 
why 
the 
result 
is 
false’, 
which 
we 
frequently 
make 
in 
argument, 
is 
made 
primarily 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
reductio 
ad 
impossibile, 
to 
rebut 
the 
proposition 
which 
was 
being 
proved 
by 
the 
reduction. 
For 
unless 
a 
man 
has 
contradicted 
this 
proposition 
he 
will 
not 
say, 
‘False 
cause’, 
but 
urge 
that 
something 
false 
has 
been 
assumed 
in 
the 
earlier 
parts 
of 
the 
argument; 
nor 
will 
he 
use 
the 
formula 
in 
the 
case 
of 
an 
ostensive 
proof; 
for 
here 
what 
one 
denies 
is 
not 
assumed 
as 
a 
premiss. 
Further 
when 
anything 
is 
refuted 
ostensively 
by 
the 
terms 
ABC, 
it 
cannot 
be 
objected 
that 
the 
syllogism 
does 
not 
depend 
on 
the 
assumption 
laid 
down. 
For 
we 
use 
the 
expression 
‘false 
cause’, 
when 
the 
syllogism 
is 
concluded 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
refutation 
of 
this 
position; 
but 
that 
is 
not 
possible 
in 
ostensive 
proofs: 
since 
if 
an 
assumption 
is 
refuted, 
a 
syllogism 
can 
no 
longer 
be 
drawn 
in 
reference 
to 
it. 
It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
the 
expression 
‘false 
cause’ 
can 
only 
be 
used 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
reductio 
ad 
impossibile, 
and 
when 
the 
original 
hypothesis 
is 
so 
related 
to 



the 
impossible 
conclusion, 
that 
the 
conclusion 
results 
indifferently 
whether 
the 
hypothesis 
is 
made 
or 
not. 
The 
most 
obvious 
case 
of 
the 
irrelevance 
of 
an 
assumption 
to 
a 
conclusion 
which 
is 
false 
is 
when 
a 
syllogism 
drawn 
from 
middle 
terms 
to 
an 
impossible 
conclusion 
is 
independent 
of 
the 
hypothesis, 
as 
we 
have 
explained 
in 
the 
Topics. 
For 
to 
put 
that 
which 
is 
not 
the 
cause 
as 
the 
cause, 
is 
just 
this: 
e.g. 
if 
a 
man, 
wishing 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
diagonal 
of 
the 
square 
is 
incommensurate 
with 
the 
side, 
should 
try 
to 
prove 
Zeno’s 
theorem 
that 
motion 
is 
impossible, 
and 
so 
establish 
a 
reductio 
ad 
impossibile: 
for 
Zeno’s 
false 
theorem 
has 
no 
connexion 
at 
all 
with 
the 
original 
assumption. 
Another 
case 
is 
where 
the 
impossible 
conclusion 
is 
connected 
with 
the 
hypothesis, 
but 
does 
not 
result 
from 
it. 
This 
may 
happen 
whether 
one 
traces 
the 
connexion 
upwards 
or 
downwards, 
e.g. 
if 
it 
is 
laid 
down 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
B, 
B 
to 
C, 
and 
C 
to 
D, 
and 
it 
should 
be 
false 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
D: 
for 
if 
we 
eliminated 
A 
and 
assumed 
all 
the 
same 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
C 
and 
C 
to 
D, 
the 
false 
conclusion 
would 
not 
depend 
on 
the 
original 
hypothesis. 
Or 
again 
trace 
the 
connexion 
upwards; 
e.g. 
suppose 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
B, 
E 
to 
A 
and 
F 
to 
E, 
it 
being 
false 
that 
F 
belongs 
to 
A. 
In 
this 
way 
too 
the 
impossible 
conclusion 
would 
result, 
though 
the 
original 
hypothesis 
were 
eliminated. 
But 
the 
impossible 
conclusion 
ought 
to 
be 
connected 
with 
the 
original 
terms: 
in 
this 
way 
it 
will 
depend 
on 
the 
hypothesis, 
e.g. 
when 
one 
traces 
the 
connexion 
downwards, 
the 
impossible 
conclusion 
must 
be 
connected 
with 
that 
term 
which 
is 
predicate 
in 
the 
hypothesis: 
for 
if 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
D, 
the 
false 
conclusion 
will 
no 
longer 
result 
after 
A 
has 
been 
eliminated. 
If 
one 
traces 
the 
connexion 
upwards, 
the 
impossible 
conclusion 
must 
be 
connected 
with 
that 
term 
which 
is 
subject 
in 
the 
hypothesis: 
for 
if 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
F 
should 
belong 
to 
B, 
the 
impossible 
conclusion 
will 
disappear 
if 
B 
is 
eliminated. 
Similarly 
when 
the 
syllogisms 
are 
negative. 


It 
is 
clear 
then 
that 
when 
the 
impossibility 
is 
not 
related 
to 
the 
original 
terms, 
the 
false 
conclusion 
does 
not 
result 
on 
account 
of 
the 
assumption. 
Or 
perhaps 
even 
so 
it 
may 
sometimes 
be 
independent. 
For 
if 
it 
were 
laid 
down 
that 
A 
belongs 
not 
to 
B 
but 
to 
K, 
and 
that 
K 
belongs 
to 
C 
and 
C 
to 
D, 
the 
impossible 
conclusion 
would 
still 
stand. 
Similarly 
if 
one 
takes 
the 
terms 
in 
an 
ascending 
series. 
Consequently 
since 
the 
impossibility 
results 
whether 
the 
first 
assumption 
is 
suppressed 
or 
not, 
it 
would 
appear 
to 
be 
independent 
of 
that 
assumption. 
Or 
perhaps 
we 
ought 
not 
to 
understand 
the 
statement 
that 
the 
false 
conclusion 
results 
independently 
of 
the 
assumption, 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
if 
something 
else 
were 
supposed 
the 
impossibility 
would 
result; 
but 
rather 
we 



mean 
that 
when 
the 
first 
assumption 
is 
eliminated, 
the 
same 
impossibility 
results 
through 
the 
remaining 
premisses; 
since 
it 
is 
not 
perhaps 
absurd 
that 
the 
same 
false 
result 
should 
follow 
from 
several 
hypotheses, 
e.g. 
that 
parallels 
meet, 
both 
on 
the 
assumption 
that 
the 
interior 
angle 
is 
greater 
than 
the 
exterior 
and 
on 
the 
assumption 
that 
a 
triangle 
contains 
more 
than 
two 
right 
angles. 


18 


A 
false 
argument 
depends 
on 
the 
first 
false 
statement 
in 
it. 
Every 
syllogism 
is 
made 
out 
of 
two 
or 
more 
premisses. 
If 
then 
the 
false 
conclusion 
is 
drawn 
from 
two 
premisses, 
one 
or 
both 
of 
them 
must 
be 
false: 
for 
(as 
we 
proved) 
a 
false 
syllogism 
cannot 
be 
drawn 
from 
two 
premisses. 
But 
if 
the 
premisses 
are 
more 
than 
two, 
e.g. 
if 
C 
is 
established 
through 
A 
and 
B, 
and 
these 
through 
D, 
E, 
F, 
and 
G, 
one 
of 
these 
higher 
propositions 
must 
be 
false, 
and 
on 
this 
the 
argument 
depends: 
for 
A 
and 
B 
are 
inferred 
by 
means 
of 
D, 
E, 
F, 
and 
G. 
Therefore 
the 
conclusion 
and 
the 
error 
results 
from 
one 
of 
them. 


19 


In 
order 
to 
avoid 
having 
a 
syllogism 
drawn 
against 
us 
we 
must 
take 
care, 
whenever 
an 
opponent 
asks 
us 
to 
admit 
the 
reason 
without 
the 
conclusions, 
not 
to 
grant 
him 
the 
same 
term 
twice 
over 
in 
his 
premisses, 
since 
we 
know 
that 
a 
syllogism 
cannot 
be 
drawn 
without 
a 
middle 
term, 
and 
that 
term 
which 
is 
stated 
more 
than 
once 
is 
the 
middle. 
How 
we 
ought 
to 
watch 
the 
middle 
in 
reference 
to 
each 
conclusion, 
is 
evident 
from 
our 
knowing 
what 
kind 
of 
thesis 
is 
proved 
in 
each 
figure. 
This 
will 
not 
escape 
us 
since 
we 
know 
how 
we 
are 
maintaining 
the 
argument. 


That 
which 
we 
urge 
men 
to 
beware 
of 
in 
their 
admissions, 
they 
ought 
in 
attack 
to 
try 
to 
conceal. 
This 
will 
be 
possible 
first, 
if, 
instead 
of 
drawing 
the 
conclusions 
of 
preliminary 
syllogisms, 
they 
take 
the 
necessary 
premisses 
and 
leave 
the 
conclusions 
in 
the 
dark; 
secondly 
if 
instead 
of 
inviting 
assent 
to 
propositions 
which 
are 
closely 
connected 
they 
take 
as 
far 
as 
possible 
those 
that 
are 
not 
connected 
by 
middle 
terms. 
For 
example 
suppose 
that 
A 
is 
to 
be 
inferred 
to 
be 
true 
of 
F, 
B, 
C, 
D, 
and 
E 
being 
middle 
terms. 
One 
ought 
then 
to 
ask 
whether 
A 
belongs 
to 
B, 
and 
next 
whether 
D 
belongs 
to 
E, 
instead 
of 



asking 
whether 
B 
belongs 
to 
C; 
after 
that 
he 
may 
ask 
whether 
B 
belongs 
to 
C, 
and 
so 
on. 
If 
the 
syllogism 
is 
drawn 
through 
one 
middle 
term, 
he 
ought 
to 
begin 
with 
that: 
in 
this 
way 
he 
will 
most 
likely 
deceive 
his 
opponent. 


20 


Since 
we 
know 
when 
a 
syllogism 
can 
be 
formed 
and 
how 
its 
terms 
must 
be 
related, 
it 
is 
clear 
when 
refutation 
will 
be 
possible 
and 
when 
impossible. 
A 
refutation 
is 
possible 
whether 
everything 
is 
conceded, 
or 
the 
answers 
alternate 
(one, 
I 
mean, 
being 
affirmative, 
the 
other 
negative). 
For 
as 
has 
been 
shown 
a 
syllogism 
is 
possible 
whether 
the 
terms 
are 
related 
in 
affirmative 
propositions 
or 
one 
proposition 
is 
affirmative, 
the 
other 
negative: 
consequently, 
if 
what 
is 
laid 
down 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
conclusion, 
a 
refutation 
must 
take 
place: 
for 
a 
refutation 
is 
a 
syllogism 
which 
establishes 
the 
contradictory. 
But 
if 
nothing 
is 
conceded, 
a 
refutation 
is 
impossible: 
for 
no 
syllogism 
is 
possible 
(as 
we 
saw) 
when 
all 
the 
terms 
are 
negative: 
therefore 
no 
refutation 
is 
possible. 
For 
if 
a 
refutation 
were 
possible, 
a 
syllogism 
must 
be 
possible; 
although 
if 
a 
syllogism 
is 
possible 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
a 
refutation 
is 
possible. 
Similarly 
refutation 
is 
not 
possible 
if 
nothing 
is 
conceded 
universally: 
since 
the 
fields 
of 
refutation 
and 
syllogism 
are 
defined 
in 
the 
same 
way. 


21 


It 
sometimes 
happens 
that 
just 
as 
we 
are 
deceived 
in 
the 
arrangement 
of 
the 
terms, 
so 
error 
may 
arise 
in 
our 
thought 
about 
them, 
e.g. 
if 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
same 
predicate 
should 
belong 
to 
more 
than 
one 
subject 
immediately, 
but 
although 
knowing 
the 
one, 
a 
man 
may 
forget 
the 
other 
and 
think 
the 
opposite 
true. 
Suppose 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
B 
and 
to 
C 
in 
virtue 
of 
their 
nature, 
and 
that 
B 
and 
C 
belong 
to 
all 
D 
in 
the 
same 
way. 
If 
then 
a 
man 
thinks 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
D, 
but 
A 
to 
no 
C, 
and 
C 
to 
all 
D, 
he 
will 
both 
know 
and 
not 
know 
the 
same 
thing 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
same 
thing. 
Again 
if 
a 
man 
were 
to 
make 
a 
mistake 
about 
the 
members 
of 
a 
single 
series; 
e.g. 
suppose 
A 
belongs 
to 
B, 
B 
to 
C, 
and 
C 
to 
D, 
but 
some 
one 
thinks 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
but 
to 
no 
C: 
he 
will 
both 
know 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
D, 
and 
think 
that 
it 
does 
not. 
Does 
he 
then 
maintain 
after 
this 
simply 
that 
what 
he 
knows, 
he 
does 
not 
think? 
For 



he 
knows 
in 
a 
way 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
C 
through 
B, 
since 
the 
part 
is 
included 
in 
the 
whole; 
so 
that 
what 
he 
knows 
in 
a 
way, 
this 
he 
maintains 
he 
does 
not 
think 
at 
all: 
but 
that 
is 
impossible. 


In 
the 
former 
case, 
where 
the 
middle 
term 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
series, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
think 
both 
the 
premisses 
with 
reference 
to 
each 
of 
the 
two 
middle 
terms: 
e.g. 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
but 
to 
no 
C, 
and 
both 
B 
and 
C 
belong 
to 
all 
D. 
For 
it 
turns 
out 
that 
the 
first 
premiss 
of 
the 
one 
syllogism 
is 
either 
wholly 
or 
partially 
contrary 
to 
the 
first 
premiss 
of 
the 
other. 
For 
if 
he 
thinks 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
everything 
to 
which 
B 
belongs, 
and 
he 
knows 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
D, 
then 
he 
knows 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
D. 
Consequently 
if 
again 
he 
thinks 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
nothing 
to 
which 
C 
belongs, 
he 
thinks 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
that 
to 
which 
B 
belongs; 
but 
if 
he 
thinks 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
everything 
to 
which 
B 
belongs, 
and 
again 
thinks 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
some 
of 
that 
to 
which 
B 
belongs, 
these 
beliefs 
are 
wholly 
or 
partially 
contrary. 
In 
this 
way 
then 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
think; 
but 
nothing 
prevents 
a 
man 
thinking 
one 
premiss 
of 
each 
syllogism 
of 
both 
premisses 
of 
one 
of 
the 
two 
syllogisms: 
e.g. 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
D, 
and 
again 
A 
belongs 
to 
no 
C. 
An 
error 
of 
this 
kind 
is 
similar 
to 
the 
error 
into 
which 
we 
fall 
concerning 
particulars: 
e.g. 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
B, 
and 
B 
to 
all 
C, 
A 
will 
belong 
to 
all 
C. 
If 
then 
a 
man 
knows 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
everything 
to 
which 
B 
belongs, 
he 
knows 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
C. 
But 
nothing 
prevents 
his 
being 
ignorant 
that 
C 
exists; 
e.g. 
let 
A 
stand 
for 
two 
right 
angles, 
B 
for 
triangle, 
C 
for 
a 
particular 
diagram 
of 
a 
triangle. 
A 
man 
might 
think 
that 
C 
did 
not 
exist, 
though 
he 
knew 
that 
every 
triangle 
contains 
two 
right 
angles; 
consequently 
he 
will 
know 
and 
not 
know 
the 
same 
thing 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
For 
the 
expression 
‘to 
know 
that 
every 
triangle 
has 
its 
angles 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles’ 
is 
ambiguous, 
meaning 
to 
have 
the 
knowledge 
either 
of 
the 
universal 
or 
of 
the 
particulars. 
Thus 
then 
he 
knows 
that 
C 
contains 
two 
right 
angles 
with 
a 
knowledge 
of 
the 
universal, 
but 
not 
with 
a 
knowledge 
of 
the 
particulars; 
consequently 
his 
knowledge 
will 
not 
be 
contrary 
to 
his 
ignorance. 
The 
argument 
in 
the 
Meno 
that 
learning 
is 
recollection 
may 
be 
criticized 
in 
a 
similar 
way. 
For 
it 
never 
happens 
that 
a 
man 
starts 
with 
a 
foreknowledge 
of 
the 
particular, 
but 
along 
with 
the 
process 
of 
being 
led 
to 
see 
the 
general 
principle 
he 
receives 
a 
knowledge 
of 
the 
particulars, 
by 
an 
act 
(as 
it 
were) 
of 
recognition. 
For 
we 
know 
some 
things 
directly; 
e.g. 
that 
the 
angles 
are 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles, 
if 
we 
know 
that 
the 
figure 
is 
a 
triangle. 
Similarly 
in 
all 
other 
cases. 



By 
a 
knowledge 
of 
the 
universal 
then 
we 
see 
the 
particulars, 
but 
we 
do 
not 
know 
them 
by 
the 
kind 
of 
knowledge 
which 
is 
proper 
to 
them; 
consequently 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
we 
may 
make 
mistakes 
about 
them, 
but 
not 
that 
we 
should 
have 
the 
knowledge 
and 
error 
that 
are 
contrary 
to 
one 
another: 
rather 
we 
have 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
universal 
but 
make 
a 
mistake 
in 
apprehending 
the 
particular. 
Similarly 
in 
the 
cases 
stated 
above. 
The 
error 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
middle 
term 
is 
not 
contrary 
to 
the 
knowledge 
obtained 
through 
the 
syllogism, 
nor 
is 
the 
thought 
in 
respect 
of 
one 
middle 
term 
contrary 
to 
that 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
other. 
Nothing 
prevents 
a 
man 
who 
knows 
both 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
B, 
and 
that 
B 
again 
belongs 
to 
C, 
thinking 
that 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
C, 
e.g. 
knowing 
that 
every 
mule 
is 
sterile 
and 
that 
this 
is 
a 
mule, 
and 
thinking 
that 
this 
animal 
is 
with 
foal: 
for 
he 
does 
not 
know 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
C, 
unless 
he 
considers 
the 
two 
propositions 
together. 
So 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
if 
he 
knows 
the 
one 
and 
does 
not 
know 
the 
other, 
he 
will 
fall 
into 
error. 
And 
this 
is 
the 
relation 
of 
knowledge 
of 
the 
universal 
to 
knowledge 
of 
the 
particular. 
For 
we 
know 
no 
sensible 
thing, 
once 
it 
has 
passed 
beyond 
the 
range 
of 
our 
senses, 
even 
if 
we 
happen 
to 
have 
perceived 
it, 
except 
by 
means 
of 
the 
universal 
and 
the 
possession 
of 
the 
knowledge 
which 
is 
proper 
to 
the 
particular, 
but 
without 
the 
actual 
exercise 
of 
that 
knowledge. 
For 
to 
know 
is 
used 
in 
three 
senses: 
it 
may 
mean 
either 
to 
have 
knowledge 
of 
the 
universal 
or 
to 
have 
knowledge 
proper 
to 
the 
matter 
in 
hand 
or 
to 
exercise 
such 
knowledge: 
consequently 
three 
kinds 
of 
error 
also 
are 
possible. 
Nothing 
then 
prevents 
a 
man 
both 
knowing 
and 
being 
mistaken 
about 
the 
same 
thing, 
provided 
that 
his 
knowledge 
and 
his 
error 
are 
not 
contrary. 
And 
this 
happens 
also 
to 
the 
man 
whose 
knowledge 
is 
limited 
to 
each 
of 
the 
premisses 
and 
who 
has 
not 
previously 
considered 
the 
particular 
question. 
For 
when 
he 
thinks 
that 
the 
mule 
is 
with 
foal 
he 
has 
not 
the 
knowledge 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
its 
actual 
exercise, 
nor 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
has 
his 
thought 
caused 
an 
error 
contrary 
to 
his 
knowledge: 
for 
the 
error 
contrary 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
universal 
would 
be 
a 
syllogism. 


But 
he 
who 
thinks 
the 
essence 
of 
good 
is 
the 
essence 
of 
bad 
will 
think 
the 
same 
thing 
to 
be 
the 
essence 
of 
good 
and 
the 
essence 
of 
bad. 
Let 
A 
stand 
for 
the 
essence 
of 
good 
and 
B 
for 
the 
essence 
of 
bad, 
and 
again 
C 
for 
the 
essence 
of 
good. 
Since 
then 
he 
thinks 
B 
and 
C 
identical, 
he 
will 
think 
that 
C 
is 
B, 
and 
similarly 
that 
B 
is 
A, 
consequently 
that 
C 
is 
A. 
For 
just 
as 
we 
saw 
that 
if 
B 
is 
true 
of 
all 
of 
which 
C 
is 
true, 
and 
A 
is 
true 
of 
all 
of 
which 
B 
is 
true, 
A 
is 
true 
of 
C, 
similarly 
with 
the 
word 
‘think’. 
Similarly 
also 
with 
the 
word 
‘is’; 
for 
we 



saw 
that 
if 
C 
is 
the 
same 
as 
B, 
and 
B 
as 
A, 
C 
is 
the 
same 
as 
A. 
Similarly 
therefore 
with 
‘opine’. 
Perhaps 
then 
this 
is 
necessary 
if 
a 
man 
will 
grant 
the 
first 
point. 
But 
presumably 
that 
is 
false, 
that 
any 
one 
could 
suppose 
the 
essence 
of 
good 
to 
be 
the 
essence 
of 
bad, 
save 
incidentally. 
For 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
think 
this 
in 
many 
different 
ways. 
But 
we 
must 
consider 
this 
matter 
better. 


Whenever 
the 
extremes 
are 
convertible 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
the 
middle 
should 
be 
convertible 
with 
both. 
For 
if 
A 
belongs 
to 
C 
through 
B, 
then 
if 
A 
and 
C 
are 
convertible 
and 
C 
belongs 
everything 
to 
which 
A 
belongs, 
B 
is 
convertible 
with 
A, 
and 
B 
belongs 
to 
everything 
to 
which 
A 
belongs, 
through 
C 
as 
middle, 
and 
C 
is 
convertible 
with 
B 
through 
A 
as 
middle. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
conclusion 
is 
negative, 
e.g. 
if 
B 
belongs 
to 
C, 
but 
A 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
B, 
neither 
will 
A 
belong 
to 
C. 
If 
then 
B 
is 
convertible 
with 
A, 
C 
will 
be 
convertible 
with 
A. 
Suppose 
B 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
A; 
neither 
then 
will 
C: 
for 
ex 
hypothesi 
B 
belonged 
to 
all 
C. 
And 
if 
C 
is 
convertible 
with 
B, 
B 
is 
convertible 
also 
with 
A, 
for 
C 
is 
said 
of 
that 
of 
all 
of 
which 
B 
is 
said. 
And 
if 
C 
is 
convertible 
in 
relation 
to 
A 
and 
to 
B, 
B 
also 
is 
convertible 
in 
relation 
to 


A. 
For 
C 
belongs 
to 
that 
to 
which 
B 
belongs: 
but 
C 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
that 
to 
which 
A 
belongs. 
And 
this 
alone 
starts 
from 
the 
conclusion; 
the 
preceding 
moods 
do 
not 
do 
so 
as 
in 
the 
affirmative 
syllogism. 
Again 
if 
A 
and 
B 
are 
convertible, 
and 
similarly 
C 
and 
D, 
and 
if 
A 
or 
C 
must 
belong 
to 
anything 
whatever, 
then 
B 
and 
D 
will 
be 
such 
that 
one 
or 
other 
belongs 
to 
anything 
whatever. 
For 
since 
B 
belongs 
to 
that 
to 
which 
A 
belongs, 
and 
D 
belongs 
to 
that 
to 
which 
C 
belongs, 
and 
since 
A 
or 
C 
belongs 
to 
everything, 
but 
not 
together, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
B 
or 
D 
belongs 
to 
everything, 
but 
not 
together. 
For 
example 
if 
that 
which 
is 
uncreated 
is 
incorruptible 
and 
that 
which 
is 
incorruptible 
is 
uncreated, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
what 
is 
created 
should 
be 
corruptible 
and 
what 
is 
corruptible 
should 
have 
been 
created. 
For 
two 
syllogisms 
have 
been 
put 
together. 
Again 
if 
A 
or 
B 
belongs 
to 
everything 
and 
if 
C 
or 
D 
belongs 
to 
everything, 
but 
they 
cannot 
belong 
together, 
then 
when 
A 
and 
C 
are 
convertible 
B 
and 
D 
are 
convertible. 
For 
if 
B 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
something 
to 
which 
D 
belongs, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
it. 
But 
if 
A 
then 
C: 
for 
they 
are 
convertible. 
Therefore 
C 
and 
D 
belong 
together. 
But 
this 
is 
impossible. 
When 
A 
belongs 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
B 
and 
to 
C 
and 
is 
affirmed 
of 
nothing 
else, 
and 
B 
also 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
A 
and 
B 
should 

be 
convertible: 
for 
since 
A 
is 
said 
of 
B 
and 
C 
only, 
and 
B 
is 
affirmed 
both 
of 
itself 
and 
of 
C, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
B 
will 
be 
said 
of 
everything 
of 
which 
A 
is 
said, 
except 
A 
itself. 
Again 
when 
A 
and 
B 
belong 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
C, 
and 
C 
is 
convertible 
with 
B, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
all 
B: 
for 
since 
A 
belongs 
to 
all 
C, 
and 
C 
to 
B 
by 
conversion, 
A 
will 
belong 
to 
all 
B. 


When, 
of 
two 
opposites 
A 
and 
B, 
A 
is 
preferable 
to 
B, 
and 
similarly 
D 
is 
preferable 
to 
C, 
then 
if 
A 
and 
C 
together 
are 
preferable 
to 
B 
and 
D 
together, 
A 
must 
be 
preferable 
to 
D. 
For 
A 
is 
an 
object 
of 
desire 
to 
the 
same 
extent 
as 
B 
is 
an 
object 
of 
aversion, 
since 
they 
are 
opposites: 
and 
C 
is 
similarly 
related 
to 
D, 
since 
they 
also 
are 
opposites. 
If 
then 
A 
is 
an 
object 
of 
desire 
to 
the 
same 
extent 
as 
D, 
B 
is 
an 
object 
of 
aversion 
to 
the 
same 
extent 
as 
C 
(since 
each 
is 
to 
the 
same 
extent 
as 
each-the 
one 
an 
object 
of 
aversion, 
the 
other 
an 
object 
of 
desire). 
Therefore 
both 
A 
and 
C 
together, 
and 
B 
and 
D 
together, 
will 
be 
equally 
objects 
of 
desire 
or 
aversion. 
But 
since 
A 
and 
C 
are 
preferable 
to 
B 
and 
D, 
A 
cannot 
be 
equally 
desirable 
with 
D; 
for 
then 
B 
along 
with 
D 
would 
be 
equally 
desirable 
with 
A 
along 
with 
C. 
But 
if 
D 
is 
preferable 
to 
A, 
then 
B 
must 
be 
less 
an 
object 
of 
aversion 
than 
C: 
for 
the 
less 
is 
opposed 
to 
the 
less. 
But 
the 
greater 
good 
and 
lesser 
evil 
are 
preferable 
to 
the 
lesser 
good 
and 
greater 
evil: 
the 
whole 
BD 
then 
is 
preferable 
to 
the 
whole 
AC. 
But 
ex 
hypothesi 
this 
is 
not 
so. 
A 
then 
is 
preferable 
to 
D, 
and 
C 
consequently 
is 
less 
an 
object 
of 
aversion 
than 
B. 
If 
then 
every 
lover 
in 
virtue 
of 
his 
love 
would 
prefer 
A, 
viz. 
that 
the 
beloved 
should 
be 
such 
as 
to 
grant 
a 
favour, 
and 
yet 
should 
not 
grant 
it 
(for 
which 
C 
stands), 
to 
the 
beloved’s 
granting 
the 
favour 
(represented 
by 
D) 
without 
being 
such 
as 
to 
grant 
it 
(represented 
by 
B), 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
A 
(being 
of 
such 
a 
nature) 
is 
preferable 
to 
granting 
the 
favour. 
To 
receive 
affection 
then 
is 
preferable 
in 
love 
to 
sexual 
intercourse. 
Love 
then 
is 
more 
dependent 
on 
friendship 
than 
on 
intercourse. 
And 
if 
it 
is 
most 
dependent 
on 
receiving 
affection, 
then 
this 
is 
its 
end. 
Intercourse 
then 
either 
is 
not 
an 
end 
at 
all 
or 
is 
an 
end 
relative 
to 
the 
further 
end, 
the 
receiving 
of 
affection. 
And 
indeed 
the 
same 
is 
true 
of 
the 
other 
desires 
and 
arts. 


It 
is 
clear 
then 
how 
the 
terms 
are 
related 
in 
conversion, 
and 
in 
respect 
of 
being 
in 
a 
higher 
degree 
objects 
of 
aversion 
or 
of 
desire. 
We 
must 
now 
state 
that 
not 
only 
dialectical 
and 
demonstrative 
syllogisms 
are 
formed 
by 
means 
of 
the 
aforesaid 
figures, 
but 
also 
rhetorical 
syllogisms 
and 
in 
general 
any 



form 
of 
persuasion, 
however 
it 
may 
be 
presented. 
For 
every 
belief 
comes 
either 
through 
syllogism 
or 
from 
induction. 


Now 
induction, 
or 
rather 
the 
syllogism 
which 
springs 
out 
of 
induction, 
consists 
in 
establishing 
syllogistically 
a 
relation 
between 
one 
extreme 
and 
the 
middle 
by 
means 
of 
the 
other 
extreme, 
e.g. 
if 
B 
is 
the 
middle 
term 
between 
A 
and 
C, 
it 
consists 
in 
proving 
through 
C 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
B. 
For 
this 
is 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
we 
make 
inductions. 
For 
example 
let 
A 
stand 
for 
long-lived, 
B 
for 
bileless, 
and 
C 
for 
the 
particular 
long-lived 
animals, 
e.g. 
man, 
horse, 
mule. 
A 
then 
belongs 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
C: 
for 
whatever 
is 
bileless 
is 
long-lived. 
But 
B 
also 
(’not 
possessing 
bile’) 
belongs 
to 
all 
C. 
If 
then 
C 
is 
convertible 
with 
B, 
and 
the 
middle 
term 
is 
not 
wider 
in 
extension, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
A 
should 
belong 
to 
B. 
For 
it 
has 
already 
been 
proved 
that 
if 
two 
things 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
thing, 
and 
the 
extreme 
is 
convertible 
with 
one 
of 
them, 
then 
the 
other 
predicate 
will 
belong 
to 
the 
predicate 
that 
is 
converted. 
But 
we 
must 
apprehend 
C 
as 
made 
up 
of 
all 
the 
particulars. 
For 
induction 
proceeds 
through 
an 
enumeration 
of 
all 
the 
cases. 


Such 
is 
the 
syllogism 
which 
establishes 
the 
first 
and 
immediate 
premiss: 
for 
where 
there 
is 
a 
middle 
term 
the 
syllogism 
proceeds 
through 
the 
middle 
term; 
when 
there 
is 
no 
middle 
term, 
through 
induction. 
And 
in 
a 
way 
induction 
is 
opposed 
to 
syllogism: 
for 
the 
latter 
proves 
the 
major 
term 
to 
belong 
to 
the 
third 
term 
by 
means 
of 
the 
middle, 
the 
former 
proves 
the 
major 
to 
belong 
to 
the 
middle 
by 
means 
of 
the 
third. 
In 
the 
order 
of 
nature, 
syllogism 
through 
the 
middle 
term 
is 
prior 
and 
better 
known, 
but 
syllogism 
through 
induction 
is 
clearer 
to 
us. 


We 
have 
an 
‘example’ 
when 
the 
major 
term 
is 
proved 
to 
belong 
to 
the 
middle 
by 
means 
of 
a 
term 
which 
resembles 
the 
third. 
It 
ought 
to 
be 
known 
both 
that 
the 
middle 
belongs 
to 
the 
third 
term, 
and 
that 
the 
first 
belongs 
to 
that 
which 
resembles 
the 
third. 
For 
example 
let 
A 
be 
evil, 
B 
making 
war 
against 
neighbours, 
C 
Athenians 
against 
Thebans, 
D 
Thebans 
against 
Phocians. 
If 
then 
we 
wish 
to 
prove 
that 
to 
fight 
with 
the 
Thebans 
is 
an 
evil, 
we 
must 
assume 
that 
to 
fight 
against 
neighbours 
is 
an 
evil. 
Evidence 
of 
this 
is 
obtained 
from 
similar 
cases, 
e.g. 
that 
the 
war 
against 
the 
Phocians 
was 
an 
evil 
to 
the 
Thebans. 
Since 
then 
to 
fight 
against 
neighbours 
is 
an 
evil, 
and 
to 
fight 
against 
the 
Thebans 
is 
to 
fight 
against 
neighbours, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
to 
fight 



against 
the 
Thebans 
is 
an 
evil. 
Now 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
B 
belongs 
to 
C 
and 
to 
D 
(for 
both 
are 
cases 
of 
making 
war 
upon 
one’s 
neighbours) 
and 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
D 
(for 
the 
war 
against 
the 
Phocians 
did 
not 
turn 
out 
well 
for 
the 
Thebans): 
but 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
B 
will 
be 
proved 
through 
D. 
Similarly 
if 
the 
belief 
in 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
middle 
term 
to 
the 
extreme 
should 
be 
produced 
by 
several 
similar 
cases. 
Clearly 
then 
to 
argue 
by 
example 
is 
neither 
like 
reasoning 
from 
part 
to 
whole, 
nor 
like 
reasoning 
from 
whole 
to 
part, 
but 
rather 
reasoning 
from 
part 
to 
part, 
when 
both 
particulars 
are 
subordinate 
to 
the 
same 
term, 
and 
one 
of 
them 
is 
known. 
It 
differs 
from 
induction, 
because 
induction 
starting 
from 
all 
the 
particular 
cases 
proves 
(as 
we 
saw) 
that 
the 
major 
term 
belongs 
to 
the 
middle, 
and 
does 
not 
apply 
the 
syllogistic 
conclusion 
to 
the 
minor 
term, 
whereas 
argument 
by 
example 
does 
make 
this 
application 
and 
does 
not 
draw 
its 
proof 
from 
all 
the 
particular 
cases. 


By 
reduction 
we 
mean 
an 
argument 
in 
which 
the 
first 
term 
clearly 
belongs 
to 
the 
middle, 
but 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
middle 
to 
the 
last 
term 
is 
uncertain 
though 
equally 
or 
more 
probable 
than 
the 
conclusion; 
or 
again 
an 
argument 
in 
which 
the 
terms 
intermediate 
between 
the 
last 
term 
and 
the 
middle 
are 
few. 
For 
in 
any 
of 
these 
cases 
it 
turns 
out 
that 
we 
approach 
more 
nearly 
to 
knowledge. 
For 
example 
let 
A 
stand 
for 
what 
can 
be 
taught, 
B 
for 
knowledge, 
C 
for 
justice. 
Now 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
knowledge 
can 
be 
taught: 
but 
it 
is 
uncertain 
whether 
virtue 
is 
knowledge. 
If 
now 
the 
statement 
BC 
is 
equally 
or 
more 
probable 
than 
AC, 
we 
have 
a 
reduction: 
for 
we 
are 
nearer 
to 
knowledge, 
since 
we 
have 
taken 
a 
new 
term, 
being 
so 
far 
without 
knowledge 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 


C. 
Or 
again 
suppose 
that 
the 
terms 
intermediate 
between 
B 
and 
C 
are 
few: 
for 
thus 
too 
we 
are 
nearer 
knowledge. 
For 
example 
let 
D 
stand 
for 
squaring, 
E 
for 
rectilinear 
figure, 
F 
for 
circle. 
If 
there 
were 
only 
one 
term 
intermediate 
between 
E 
and 
F 
(viz. 
that 
the 
circle 
is 
made 
equal 
to 
a 
rectilinear 
figure 
by 
the 
help 
of 
lunules), 
we 
should 
be 
near 
to 
knowledge. 
But 
when 
BC 
is 
not 
more 
probable 
than 
AC, 
and 
the 
intermediate 
terms 
are 
not 
few, 
I 
do 
not 
call 
this 
reduction: 
nor 
again 
when 
the 
statement 
BC 
is 
immediate: 
for 
such 
a 
statement 
is 
knowledge. 

An 
objection 
is 
a 
premiss 
contrary 
to 
a 
premiss. 
It 
differs 
from 
a 
premiss, 
because 
it 
may 
be 
particular, 
but 
a 
premiss 
either 
cannot 
be 
particular 
at 
all 
or 
not 
in 
universal 
syllogisms. 
An 
objection 
is 
brought 
in 
two 
ways 
and 
through 
two 
figures; 
in 
two 
ways 
because 
every 
objection 
is 
either 
universal 
or 
particular, 
by 
two 
figures 
because 
objections 
are 
brought 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
premiss, 
and 
opposites 
can 
be 
proved 
only 
in 
the 
first 
and 
third 
figures. 
If 
a 
man 
maintains 
a 
universal 
affirmative, 
we 
reply 
with 
a 
universal 
or 
a 
particular 
negative; 
the 
former 
is 
proved 
from 
the 
first 
figure, 
the 
latter 
from 
the 
third. 
For 
example 
let 
stand 
for 
there 
being 
a 
single 
science, 
B 
for 
contraries. 
If 
a 
man 
premises 
that 
contraries 
are 
subjects 
of 
a 
single 
science, 
the 
objection 
may 
be 
either 
that 
opposites 
are 
never 
subjects 
of 
a 
single 
science, 
and 
contraries 
are 
opposites, 
so 
that 
we 
get 
the 
first 
figure, 
or 
that 
the 
knowable 
and 
the 
unknowable 
are 
not 
subjects 
of 
a 
single 
science: 
this 
proof 
is 
in 
the 
third 
figure: 
for 
it 
is 
true 
of 
C 
(the 
knowable 
and 
the 
unknowable) 
that 
they 
are 
contraries, 
and 
it 
is 
false 
that 
they 
are 
the 
subjects 
of 
a 
single 
science. 


Similarly 
if 
the 
premiss 
objected 
to 
is 
negative. 
For 
if 
a 
man 
maintains 
that 
contraries 
are 
not 
subjects 
of 
a 
single 
science, 
we 
reply 
either 
that 
all 
opposites 
or 
that 
certain 
contraries, 
e.g. 
what 
is 
healthy 
and 
what 
is 
sickly, 
are 
subjects 
of 
the 
same 
science: 
the 
former 
argument 
issues 
from 
the 
first, 
the 
latter 
from 
the 
third 
figure. 


In 
general 
if 
a 
man 
urges 
a 
universal 
objection 
he 
must 
frame 
his 
contradiction 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
universal 
of 
the 
terms 
taken 
by 
his 
opponent, 
e.g. 
if 
a 
man 
maintains 
that 
contraries 
are 
not 
subjects 
of 
the 
same 
science, 
his 
opponent 
must 
reply 
that 
there 
is 
a 
single 
science 
of 
all 
opposites. 
Thus 
we 
must 
have 
the 
first 
figure: 
for 
the 
term 
which 
embraces 
the 
original 
subject 
becomes 
the 
middle 
term. 


If 
the 
objection 
is 
particular, 
the 
objector 
must 
frame 
his 
contradiction 
with 
reference 
to 
a 
term 
relatively 
to 
which 
the 
subject 
of 
his 
opponent’s 
premiss 
is 
universal, 
e.g. 
he 
will 
point 
out 
that 
the 
knowable 
and 
the 
unknowable 
are 
not 
subjects 
of 
the 
same 
science: 
‘contraries’ 
is 
universal 
relatively 
to 
these. 
And 
we 
have 
the 
third 
figure: 
for 
the 
particular 
term 
assumed 
is 
middle, 
e.g. 
the 
knowable 
and 
the 
unknowable. 
Premisses 
from 
which 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
draw 
the 
contrary 
conclusion 
are 
what 
we 
start 
from 
when 
we 
try 
to 
make 
objections. 
Consequently 
we 
bring 
objections 
in 
these 
figures 
only: 
for 
in 
them 
only 
are 
opposite 
syllogisms 
possible, 
since 
the 
second 
figure 
cannot 
produce 
an 
affirmative 
conclusion. 



Besides, 
an 
objection 
in 
the 
middle 
figure 
would 
require 
a 
fuller 
argument, 


e.g. 
if 
it 
should 
not 
be 
granted 
that 
A 
belongs 
to 
B, 
because 
C 
does 
not 
follow 
B. 
This 
can 
be 
made 
clear 
only 
by 
other 
premisses. 
But 
an 
objection 
ought 
not 
to 
turn 
off 
into 
other 
things, 
but 
have 
its 
new 
premiss 
quite 
clear 
immediately. 
For 
this 
reason 
also 
this 
is 
the 
only 
figure 
from 
which 
proof 
by 
signs 
cannot 
be 
obtained. 
We 
must 
consider 
later 
the 
other 
kinds 
of 
objection, 
namely 
the 
objection 
from 
contraries, 
from 
similars, 
and 
from 
common 
opinion, 
and 
inquire 
whether 
a 
particular 
objection 
cannot 
be 
elicited 
from 
the 
first 
figure 
or 
a 
negative 
objection 
from 
the 
second. 


A 
probability 
and 
a 
sign 
are 
not 
identical, 
but 
a 
probability 
is 
a 
generally 
approved 
proposition: 
what 
men 
know 
to 
happen 
or 
not 
to 
happen, 
to 
be 
or 
not 
to 
be, 
for 
the 
most 
part 
thus 
and 
thus, 
is 
a 
probability, 
e.g. 
‘the 
envious 
hate’, 
‘the 
beloved 
show 
affection’. 
A 
sign 
means 
a 
demonstrative 
proposition 
necessary 
or 
generally 
approved: 
for 
anything 
such 
that 
when 
it 
is 
another 
thing 
is, 
or 
when 
it 
has 
come 
into 
being 
the 
other 
has 
come 
into 
being 
before 
or 
after, 
is 
a 
sign 
of 
the 
other’s 
being 
or 
having 
come 
into 
being. 
Now 
an 
enthymeme 
is 
a 
syllogism 
starting 
from 
probabilities 
or 
signs, 
and 
a 
sign 
may 
be 
taken 
in 
three 
ways, 
corresponding 
to 
the 
position 
of 
the 
middle 
term 
in 
the 
figures. 
For 
it 
may 
be 
taken 
as 
in 
the 
first 
figure 
or 
the 
second 
or 
the 
third. 
For 
example 
the 
proof 
that 
a 
woman 
is 
with 
child 
because 
she 
has 
milk 
is 
in 
the 
first 
figure: 
for 
to 
have 
milk 
is 
the 
middle 
term. 
Let 
A 
represent 
to 
be 
with 
child, 
B 
to 
have 
milk, 
C 
woman. 
The 
proof 
that 
wise 
men 
are 
good, 
since 
Pittacus 
is 
good, 
comes 
through 
the 
last 
figure. 
Let 
A 
stand 
for 
good, 
B 
for 
wise 
men, 
C 
for 
Pittacus. 
It 
is 
true 
then 
to 
affirm 
both 
A 
and 
B 
of 
C: 
only 
men 
do 
not 
say 
the 
latter, 
because 
they 
know 
it, 
though 
they 
state 
the 
former. 
The 
proof 
that 
a 
woman 
is 
with 
child 
because 
she 
is 
pale 
is 
meant 
to 
come 
through 
the 
middle 
figure: 
for 
since 
paleness 
follows 
women 
with 
child 
and 
is 
a 
concomitant 
of 
this 
woman, 
people 
suppose 
it 
has 
been 
proved 
that 
she 
is 
with 
child. 
Let 
A 
stand 
for 
paleness, 
B 
for 
being 
with 
child, 
C 
for 
woman. 
Now 
if 
the 
one 
proposition 
is 
stated, 
we 
have 
only 
a 
sign, 
but 
if 
the 
other 
is 
stated 
as 
well, 
a 
syllogism, 
e.g. 
‘Pittacus 
is 
generous, 
since 
ambitious 
men 
are 
generous 
and 
Pittacus 
is 
ambitious.’ 
Or 
again 
‘Wise 
men 
are 
good, 
since 
Pittacus 
is 
not 
only 
good 
but 
wise.’ 
In 
this 
way 
then 
syllogisms 
are 
formed, 



only 
that 
which 
proceeds 
through 
the 
first 
figure 
is 
irrefutable 
if 
it 
is 
true 
(for 
it 
is 
universal), 
that 
which 
proceeds 
through 
the 
last 
figure 
is 
refutable 
even 
if 
the 
conclusion 
is 
true, 
since 
the 
syllogism 
is 
not 
universal 
nor 
correlative 
to 
the 
matter 
in 
question: 
for 
though 
Pittacus 
is 
good, 
it 
is 
not 
therefore 
necessary 
that 
all 
other 
wise 
men 
should 
be 
good. 
But 
the 
syllogism 
which 
proceeds 
through 
the 
middle 
figure 
is 
always 
refutable 
in 
any 
case: 
for 
a 
syllogism 
can 
never 
be 
formed 
when 
the 
terms 
are 
related 
in 
this 
way: 
for 
though 
a 
woman 
with 
child 
is 
pale, 
and 
this 
woman 
also 
is 
pale, 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
she 
should 
be 
with 
child. 
Truth 
then 
may 
be 
found 
in 
signs 
whatever 
their 
kind, 
but 
they 
have 
the 
differences 
we 
have 
stated. 


We 
must 
either 
divide 
signs 
in 
the 
way 
stated, 
and 
among 
them 
designate 
the 
middle 
term 
as 
the 
index 
(for 
people 
call 
that 
the 
index 
which 
makes 
us 
know, 
and 
the 
middle 
term 
above 
all 
has 
this 
character), 
or 
else 
we 
must 
call 
the 
arguments 
derived 
from 
the 
extremes 
signs, 
that 
derived 
from 
the 
middle 
term 
the 
index: 
for 
that 
which 
is 
proved 
through 
the 
first 
figure 
is 
most 
generally 
accepted 
and 
most 
true. 


It 
is 
possible 
to 
infer 
character 
from 
features, 
if 
it 
is 
granted 
that 
the 
body 
and 
the 
soul 
are 
changed 
together 
by 
the 
natural 
affections: 
I 
say 
‘natural’, 
for 
though 
perhaps 
by 
learning 
music 
a 
man 
has 
made 
some 
change 
in 
his 
soul, 
this 
is 
not 
one 
of 
those 
affections 
which 
are 
natural 
to 
us; 
rather 
I 
refer 
to 
passions 
and 
desires 
when 
I 
speak 
of 
natural 
emotions. 
If 
then 
this 
were 
granted 
and 
also 
that 
for 
each 
change 
there 
is 
a 
corresponding 
sign, 
and 
we 
could 
state 
the 
affection 
and 
sign 
proper 
to 
each 
kind 
of 
animal, 
we 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
infer 
character 
from 
features. 
For 
if 
there 
is 
an 
affection 
which 
belongs 
properly 
to 
an 
individual 
kind, 
e.g. 
courage 
to 
lions, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
there 
should 
be 
a 
sign 
of 
it: 
for 
ex 
hypothesi 
body 
and 
soul 
are 
affected 
together. 
Suppose 
this 
sign 
is 
the 
possession 
of 
large 
extremities: 
this 
may 
belong 
to 
other 
kinds 
also 
though 
not 
universally. 
For 
the 
sign 
is 
proper 
in 
the 
sense 
stated, 
because 
the 
affection 
is 
proper 
to 
the 
whole 
kind, 
though 
not 
proper 
to 
it 
alone, 
according 
to 
our 
usual 
manner 
of 
speaking. 
The 
same 
thing 
then 
will 
be 
found 
in 
another 
kind, 
and 
man 
may 
be 
brave, 
and 
some 
other 
kinds 
of 
animal 
as 
well. 
They 
will 
then 
have 
the 
sign: 
for 
ex 
hypothesi 
there 
is 
one 
sign 
corresponding 
to 
each 
affection. 
If 
then 
this 
is 
so, 
and 
we 
can 
collect 
signs 
of 
this 
sort 
in 
these 
animals 
which 
have 
only 
one 
affection 
proper 
to 
them-but 
each 
affection 
has 
its 
sign, 
since 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
have 
a 
single 
sign-we 
shall 
then 
be 
able 
to 
infer 
character 
from 
features. 
But 
if 
the 
kind 
as 
a 
whole 
has 
two 
properties, 
e.g. 
if 
the 
lion 
is 
both 



brave 
and 
generous, 
how 
shall 
we 
know 
which 
of 
the 
signs 
which 
are 
its 
proper 
concomitants 
is 
the 
sign 
of 
a 
particular 
affection? 
Perhaps 
if 
both 
belong 
to 
some 
other 
kind 
though 
not 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
it, 
and 
if, 
in 
those 
kinds 
in 
which 
each 
is 
found 
though 
not 
in 
the 
whole 
of 
their 
members, 
some 
members 
possess 
one 
of 
the 
affections 
and 
not 
the 
other: 
e.g. 
if 
a 
man 
is 
brave 
but 
not 
generous, 
but 
possesses, 
of 
the 
two 
signs, 
large 
extremities, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
this 
is 
the 
sign 
of 
courage 
in 
the 
lion 
also. 
To 
judge 
character 
from 
features, 
then, 
is 
possible 
in 
the 
first 
figure 
if 
the 
middle 
term 
is 
convertible 
with 
the 
first 
extreme, 
but 
is 
wider 
than 
the 
third 
term 
and 
not 
convertible 
with 
it: 
e.g. 
let 
A 
stand 
for 
courage, 
B 
for 
large 
extremities, 
and 
C 
for 
lion. 
B 
then 
belongs 
to 
everything 
to 
which 
C 
belongs, 
but 
also 
to 
others. 
But 
A 
belongs 
to 
everything 
to 
which 
B 
belongs, 
and 
to 
nothing 
besides, 
but 
is 
convertible 
with 
B: 
otherwise, 
there 
would 
not 
be 
a 
single 
sign 
correlative 
with 
each 
affection. 



Posterior 
Analytics, 
Book 
I 


Translated 
by 
G.

G. 
Mure 


All 
instruction 
given 
or 
received 
by 
way 
of 
argument 
proceeds 
from 
preexistent 
knowledge. 
This 
becomes 
evident 
upon 
a 
survey 
of 
all 
the 
species 
of 
such 
instruction. 
The 
mathematical 
sciences 
and 
all 
other 
speculative 
disciplines 
are 
acquired 
in 
this 
way, 
and 
so 
are 
the 
two 
forms 
of 
dialectical 
reasoning, 
syllogistic 
and 
inductive; 
for 
each 
of 
these 
latter 
make 
use 
of 
old 
knowledge 
to 
impart 
new, 
the 
syllogism 
assuming 
an 
audience 
that 
accepts 
its 
premisses, 
induction 
exhibiting 
the 
universal 
as 
implicit 
in 
the 
clearly 
known 
particular. 
Again, 
the 
persuasion 
exerted 
by 
rhetorical 
arguments 
is 
in 
principle 
the 
same, 
since 
they 
use 
either 
example, 
a 
kind 
of 
induction, 
or 
enthymeme, 
a 
form 
of 
syllogism. 


The 
pre-existent 
knowledge 
required 
is 
of 
two 
kinds. 
In 
some 
cases 
admission 
of 
the 
fact 
must 
be 
assumed, 
in 
others 
comprehension 
of 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
term 
used, 
and 
sometimes 
both 
assumptions 
are 
essential. 
Thus, 
we 
assume 
that 
every 
predicate 
can 
be 
either 
truly 
affirmed 
or 
truly 
denied 
of 
any 
subject, 
and 
that 
‘triangle’ 
means 
so 
and 
so; 
as 
regards 
‘unit’ 
we 
have 
to 
make 
the 
double 
assumption 
of 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
word 
and 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
thing. 
The 
reason 
is 
that 
these 
several 
objects 
are 
not 
equally 
obvious 
to 
us. 
Recognition 
of 
a 
truth 
may 
in 
some 
cases 
contain 
as 
factors 
both 
previous 
knowledge 
and 
also 
knowledge 
acquired 
simultaneously 
with 
that 
recognition-knowledge, 
this 
latter, 
of 
the 
particulars 
actually 
falling 
under 
the 
universal 
and 
therein 
already 
virtually 
known. 
For 
example, 
the 
student 
knew 
beforehand 
that 
the 
angles 
of 
every 
triangle 
are 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles; 
but 
it 
was 
only 
at 
the 
actual 
moment 
at 
which 
he 
was 
being 
led 
on 
to 
recognize 
this 
as 
true 
in 
the 
instance 
before 
him 
that 
he 
came 
to 
know 
‘this 
figure 
inscribed 
in 
the 
semicircle’ 
to 
be 
a 
triangle. 
For 
some 
things 
(viz. 
the 
singulars 
finally 
reached 
which 
are 
not 
predicable 
of 
anything 
else 
as 
subject) 
are 
only 
learnt 
in 
this 
way, 
i.e. 
there 
is 
here 
no 
recognition 
through 
a 
middle 
of 
a 
minor 
term 
as 
subject 
to 
a 
major. 
Before 
he 
was 
led 
on 
to 
recognition 
or 
before 
he 
actually 
drew 
a 
conclusion, 
we 
should 
perhaps 
say 



that 
in 
a 
manner 
he 
knew, 
in 
a 
manner 
not. 


If 
he 
did 
not 
in 
an 
unqualified 
sense 
of 
the 
term 
know 
the 
existence 
of 
this 
triangle, 
how 
could 
he 
know 
without 
qualification 
that 
its 
angles 
were 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles? 
No: 
clearly 
he 
knows 
not 
without 
qualification 
but 
only 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
he 
knows 
universally. 
If 
this 
distinction 
is 
not 
drawn, 
we 
are 
faced 
with 
the 
dilemma 
in 
the 
Meno: 
either 
a 
man 
will 
learn 
nothing 
or 
what 
he 
already 
knows; 
for 
we 
cannot 
accept 
the 
solution 
which 
some 
people 
offer. 
A 
man 
is 
asked, 
‘Do 
you, 
or 
do 
you 
not, 
know 
that 
every 
pair 
is 
even?’ 
He 
says 
he 
does 
know 
it. 
The 
questioner 
then 
produces 
a 
particular 
pair, 
of 
the 
existence, 
and 
so 
a 
fortiori 
of 
the 
evenness, 
of 
which 
he 
was 
unaware. 
The 
solution 
which 
some 
people 
offer 
is 
to 
assert 
that 
they 
do 
not 
know 
that 
every 
pair 
is 
even, 
but 
only 
that 
everything 
which 
they 
know 
to 
be 
a 
pair 
is 
even: 
yet 
what 
they 
know 
to 
be 
even 
is 
that 
of 
which 
they 
have 
demonstrated 
evenness, 
i.e. 
what 
they 
made 
the 
subject 
of 
their 
premiss, 
viz. 
not 
merely 
every 
triangle 
or 
number 
which 
they 
know 
to 
be 
such, 
but 
any 
and 
every 
number 
or 
triangle 
without 
reservation. 
For 
no 
premiss 
is 
ever 
couched 
in 
the 
form 
‘every 
number 
which 
you 
know 
to 
be 
such’, 
or 
‘every 
rectilinear 
figure 
which 
you 
know 
to 
be 
such’: 
the 
predicate 
is 
always 
construed 
as 
applicable 
to 
any 
and 
every 
instance 
of 
the 
thing. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
I 
imagine 
there 
is 
nothing 
to 
prevent 
a 
man 
in 
one 
sense 
knowing 
what 
he 
is 
learning, 
in 
another 
not 
knowing 
it. 
The 
strange 
thing 
would 
be, 
not 
if 
in 
some 
sense 
he 
knew 
what 
he 
was 
learning, 
but 
if 
he 
were 
to 
know 
it 
in 
that 
precise 
sense 
and 
manner 
in 
which 
he 
was 
learning 
it. 


We 
suppose 
ourselves 
to 
possess 
unqualified 
scientific 
knowledge 
of 
a 
thing, 
as 
opposed 
to 
knowing 
it 
in 
the 
accidental 
way 
in 
which 
the 
sophist 
knows, 
when 
we 
think 
that 
we 
know 
the 
cause 
on 
which 
the 
fact 
depends, 
as 
the 
cause 
of 
that 
fact 
and 
of 
no 
other, 
and, 
further, 
that 
the 
fact 
could 
not 
be 
other 
than 
it 
is. 
Now 
that 
scientific 
knowing 
is 
something 
of 
this 
sort 
is 
evident-witness 
both 
those 
who 
falsely 
claim 
it 
and 
those 
who 
actually 
possess 
it, 
since 
the 
former 
merely 
imagine 
themselves 
to 
be, 
while 
the 
latter 
are 
also 
actually, 
in 
the 
condition 
described. 
Consequently 
the 
proper 
object 
of 
unqualified 
scientific 
knowledge 
is 
something 
which 
cannot 
be 
other 
than 
it 
is. 


There 
may 
be 
another 
manner 
of 
knowing 
as 
well-that 
will 
be 
discussed 



later. 
What 
I 
now 
assert 
is 
that 
at 
all 
events 
we 
do 
know 
by 
demonstration. 
By 
demonstration 
I 
mean 
a 
syllogism 
productive 
of 
scientific 
knowledge, 
a 
syllogism, 
that 
is, 
the 
grasp 
of 
which 
is 
eo 
ipso 
such 
knowledge. 
Assuming 
then 
that 
my 
thesis 
as 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
scientific 
knowing 
is 
correct, 
the 
premisses 
of 
demonstrated 
knowledge 
must 
be 
true, 
primary, 
immediate, 
better 
known 
than 
and 
prior 
to 
the 
conclusion, 
which 
is 
further 
related 
to 
them 
as 
effect 
to 
cause. 
Unless 
these 
conditions 
are 
satisfied, 
the 
basic 
truths 
will 
not 
be 
‘appropriate’ 
to 
the 
conclusion. 
Syllogism 
there 
may 
indeed 
be 
without 
these 
conditions, 
but 
such 
syllogism, 
not 
being 
productive 
of 
scientific 
knowledge, 
will 
not 
be 
demonstration. 
The 
premisses 
must 
be 
true: 
for 
that 
which 
is 
non-existent 
cannot 
be 
known-we 
cannot 
know, 
e.g. 
that 
the 
diagonal 
of 
a 
square 
is 
commensurate 
with 
its 
side. 
The 
premisses 
must 
be 
primary 
and 
indemonstrable; 
otherwise 
they 
will 
require 
demonstration 
in 
order 
to 
be 
known, 
since 
to 
have 
knowledge, 
if 
it 
be 
not 
accidental 
knowledge, 
of 
things 
which 
are 
demonstrable, 
means 
precisely 
to 
have 
a 
demonstration 
of 
them. 
The 
premisses 
must 
be 
the 
causes 
of 
the 
conclusion, 
better 
known 
than 
it, 
and 
prior 
to 
it; 
its 
causes, 
since 
we 
possess 
scientific 
knowledge 
of 
a 
thing 
only 
when 
we 
know 
its 
cause; 
prior, 
in 
order 
to 
be 
causes; 
antecedently 
known, 
this 
antecedent 
knowledge 
being 
not 
our 
mere 
understanding 
of 
the 
meaning, 
but 
knowledge 
of 
the 
fact 
as 
well. 
Now 
‘prior’ 
and 
‘better 
known’ 
are 
ambiguous 
terms, 
for 
there 
is 
a 
difference 
between 
what 
is 
prior 
and 
better 
known 
in 
the 
order 
of 
being 
and 
what 
is 
prior 
and 
better 
known 
to 
man. 
I 
mean 
that 
objects 
nearer 
to 
sense 
are 
prior 
and 
better 
known 
to 
man; 
objects 
without 
qualification 
prior 
and 
better 
known 
are 
those 
further 
from 
sense. 
Now 
the 
most 
universal 
causes 
are 
furthest 
from 
sense 
and 
particular 
causes 
are 
nearest 
to 
sense, 
and 
they 
are 
thus 
exactly 
opposed 
to 
one 
another. 
In 
saying 
that 
the 
premisses 
of 
demonstrated 
knowledge 
must 
be 
primary, 
I 
mean 
that 
they 
must 
be 
the 
‘appropriate’ 
basic 
truths, 
for 
I 
identify 
primary 
premiss 
and 
basic 
truth. 
A 
‘basic 
truth’ 
in 
a 
demonstration 
is 
an 
immediate 
proposition. 
An 
immediate 
proposition 
is 
one 
which 
has 
no 
other 
proposition 
prior 
to 
it. 
A 
proposition 
is 
either 
part 
of 
an 
enunciation, 
i.e. 
it 
predicates 
a 
single 
attribute 
of 
a 
single 
subject. 
If 
a 
proposition 
is 
dialectical, 
it 
assumes 
either 
part 
indifferently; 
if 
it 
is 
demonstrative, 
it 
lays 
down 
one 
part 
to 
the 
definite 
exclusion 
of 
the 
other 
because 
that 
part 
is 
true. 
The 
term 
‘enunciation’ 
denotes 
either 
part 
of 
a 
contradiction 
indifferently. 
A 
contradiction 
is 
an 
opposition 
which 
of 
its 
own 
nature 
excludes 
a 
middle. 
The 
part 
of 
a 
contradiction 
which 
conjoins 
a 
predicate 
with 
a 
subject 
is 
an 



affirmation; 
the 
part 
disjoining 
them 
is 
a 
negation. 
I 
call 
an 
immediate 
basic 
truth 
of 
syllogism 
a 
‘thesis’ 
when, 
though 
it 
is 
not 
susceptible 
of 
proof 
by 
the 
teacher, 
yet 
ignorance 
of 
it 
does 
not 
constitute 
a 
total 
bar 
to 
progress 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
pupil: 
one 
which 
the 
pupil 
must 
know 
if 
he 
is 
to 
learn 
anything 
whatever 
is 
an 
axiom. 
I 
call 
it 
an 
axiom 
because 
there 
are 
such 
truths 
and 
we 
give 
them 
the 
name 
of 
axioms 
par 
excellence. 
If 
a 
thesis 
assumes 
one 
part 
or 
the 
other 
of 
an 
enunciation, 
i.e. 
asserts 
either 
the 
existence 
or 
the 
nonexistence 
of 
a 
subject, 
it 
is 
a 
hypothesis; 
if 
it 
does 
not 
so 
assert, 
it 
is 
a 
definition. 
Definition 
is 
a 
‘thesis’ 
or 
a 
‘laying 
something 
down’, 
since 
the 
arithmetician 
lays 
it 
down 
that 
to 
be 
a 
unit 
is 
to 
be 
quantitatively 
indivisible; 
but 
it 
is 
not 
a 
hypothesis, 
for 
to 
define 
what 
a 
unit 
is 
is 
not 
the 
same 
as 
to 
affirm 
its 
existence. 


Now 
since 
the 
required 
ground 
of 
our 
knowledge-i.e. 
of 
our 
conviction-of 
a 
fact 
is 
the 
possession 
of 
such 
a 
syllogism 
as 
we 
call 
demonstration, 
and 
the 
ground 
of 
the 
syllogism 
is 
the 
facts 
constituting 
its 
premisses, 
we 
must 
not 
only 
know 
the 
primary 
premisses-some 
if 
not 
all 
of 
them-beforehand, 
but 
know 
them 
better 
than 
the 
conclusion: 
for 
the 
cause 
of 
an 
attribute’s 
inherence 
in 
a 
subject 
always 
itself 
inheres 
in 
the 
subject 
more 
firmly 
than 
that 
attribute; 
e.g. 
the 
cause 
of 
our 
loving 
anything 
is 
dearer 
to 
us 
than 
the 
object 
of 
our 
love. 
So 
since 
the 
primary 
premisses 
are 
the 
cause 
of 
our 
knowledge-i.e. 
of 
our 
conviction-it 
follows 
that 
we 
know 
them 
better-that 
is, 
are 
more 
convinced 
of 
them-than 
their 
consequences, 
precisely 
because 
of 
our 
knowledge 
of 
the 
latter 
is 
the 
effect 
of 
our 
knowledge 
of 
the 
premisses. 
Now 
a 
man 
cannot 
believe 
in 
anything 
more 
than 
in 
the 
things 
he 
knows, 
unless 
he 
has 
either 
actual 
knowledge 
of 
it 
or 
something 
better 
than 
actual 
knowledge. 
But 
we 
are 
faced 
with 
this 
paradox 
if 
a 
student 
whose 
belief 
rests 
on 
demonstration 
has 
not 
prior 
knowledge; 
a 
man 
must 
believe 
in 
some, 
if 
not 
in 
all, 
of 
the 
basic 
truths 
more 
than 
in 
the 
conclusion. 
Moreover, 
if 
a 
man 
sets 
out 
to 
acquire 
the 
scientific 
knowledge 
that 
comes 
through 
demonstration, 
he 
must 
not 
only 
have 
a 
better 
knowledge 
of 
the 
basic 
truths 
and 
a 
firmer 
conviction 
of 
them 
than 
of 
the 
connexion 
which 
is 
being 
demonstrated: 
more 
than 
this, 
nothing 
must 
be 
more 
certain 
or 
better 
known 
to 
him 
than 
these 
basic 
truths 
in 
their 
character 
as 
contradicting 
the 
fundamental 
premisses 
which 
lead 
to 
the 
opposed 
and 
erroneous 
conclusion. 
For 
indeed 
the 
conviction 
of 
pure 
science 
must 
be 
unshakable. 



Some 
hold 
that, 
owing 
to 
the 
necessity 
of 
knowing 
the 
primary 
premisses, 
there 
is 
no 
scientific 
knowledge. 
Others 
think 
there 
is, 
but 
that 
all 
truths 
are 
demonstrable. 
Neither 
doctrine 
is 
either 
true 
or 
a 
necessary 
deduction 
from 
the 
premisses. 
The 
first 
school, 
assuming 
that 
there 
is 
no 
way 
of 
knowing 
other 
than 
by 
demonstration, 
maintain 
that 
an 
infinite 
regress 
is 
involved, 
on 
the 
ground 
that 
if 
behind 
the 
prior 
stands 
no 
primary, 
we 
could 
not 
know 
the 
posterior 
through 
the 
prior 
(wherein 
they 
are 
right, 
for 
one 
cannot 
traverse 
an 
infinite 
series): 
if 
on 
the 
other 
hand-they 
say-the 
series 
terminates 
and 
there 
are 
primary 
premisses, 
yet 
these 
are 
unknowable 
because 
incapable 
of 
demonstration, 
which 
according 
to 
them 
is 
the 
only 
form 
of 
knowledge. 
And 
since 
thus 
one 
cannot 
know 
the 
primary 
premisses, 
knowledge 
of 
the 
conclusions 
which 
follow 
from 
them 
is 
not 
pure 
scientific 
knowledge 
nor 
properly 
knowing 
at 
all, 
but 
rests 
on 
the 
mere 
supposition 
that 
the 
premisses 
are 
true. 
The 
other 
party 
agree 
with 
them 
as 
regards 
knowing, 
holding 
that 
it 
is 
only 
possible 
by 
demonstration, 
but 
they 
see 
no 
difficulty 
in 
holding 
that 
all 
truths 
are 
demonstrated, 
on 
the 
ground 
that 
demonstration 
may 
be 
circular 
and 
reciprocal. 


Our 
own 
doctrine 
is 
that 
not 
all 
knowledge 
is 
demonstrative: 
on 
the 
contrary, 
knowledge 
of 
the 
immediate 
premisses 
is 
independent 
of 
demonstration. 
(The 
necessity 
of 
this 
is 
obvious; 
for 
since 
we 
must 
know 
the 
prior 
premisses 
from 
which 
the 
demonstration 
is 
drawn, 
and 
since 
the 
regress 
must 
end 
in 
immediate 
truths, 
those 
truths 
must 
be 
indemonstrable.) 
Such, 
then, 
is 
our 
doctrine, 
and 
in 
addition 
we 
maintain 
that 
besides 
scientific 
knowledge 
there 
is 
its 
originative 
source 
which 
enables 
us 
to 
recognize 
the 
definitions. 


Now 
demonstration 
must 
be 
based 
on 
premisses 
prior 
to 
and 
better 
known 
than 
the 
conclusion; 
and 
the 
same 
things 
cannot 
simultaneously 
be 
both 
prior 
and 
posterior 
to 
one 
another: 
so 
circular 
demonstration 
is 
clearly 
not 
possible 
in 
the 
unqualified 
sense 
of 
‘demonstration’, 
but 
only 
possible 
if 
‘demonstration’ 
be 
extended 
to 
include 
that 
other 
method 
of 
argument 
which 
rests 
on 
a 
distinction 
between 
truths 
prior 
to 
us 
and 
truths 
without 
qualification 
prior, 
i.e. 
the 
method 
by 
which 
induction 
produces 
knowledge. 
But 
if 
we 
accept 
this 
extension 
of 
its 
meaning, 
our 
definition 
of 
unqualified 
knowledge 
will 
prove 
faulty; 
for 
there 
seem 
to 
be 
two 
kinds 
of 
it. 
Perhaps, 
however, 
the 
second 
form 
of 
demonstration, 
that 
which 
proceeds 
from 
truths 
better 
known 
to 
us, 
is 
not 
demonstration 
in 
the 
unqualified 
sense 
of 
the 
term. 


The 
advocates 
of 
circular 
demonstration 
are 
not 
only 
faced 
with 
the 



difficulty 
we 
have 
just 
stated: 
in 
addition 
their 
theory 
reduces 
to 
the 
mere 
statement 
that 
if 
a 
thing 
exists, 
then 
it 
does 
exist-an 
easy 
way 
of 
proving 
anything. 
That 
this 
is 
so 
can 
be 
clearly 
shown 
by 
taking 
three 
terms, 
for 
to 
constitute 
the 
circle 
it 
makes 
no 
difference 
whether 
many 
terms 
or 
few 
or 
even 
only 
two 
are 
taken. 
Thus 
by 
direct 
proof, 
if 
A 
is, 
B 
must 
be; 
if 
B 
is, 
C 
must 
be; 
therefore 
if 
A 
is, 
C 
must 
be. 
Since 
then-by 
the 
circular 
proof-if 
A 
is, 
B 
must 
be, 
and 
if 
B 
is, 
A 
must 
be, 
A 
may 
be 
substituted 
for 
C 
above. 
Then 
‘if 
B 
is, 
A 
must 
be’=’if 
B 
is, 
C 
must 
be’, 
which 
above 
gave 
the 
conclusion 
‘if 
A 
is, 
C 
must 
be’: 
but 
C 
and 
A 
have 
been 
identified. 
Consequently 
the 
upholders 
of 
circular 
demonstration 
are 
in 
the 
position 
of 
saying 
that 
if 
A 
is, 
A 
must 
be-
a 
simple 
way 
of 
proving 
anything. 
Moreover, 
even 
such 
circular 
demonstration 
is 
impossible 
except 
in 
the 
case 
of 
attributes 
that 
imply 
one 
another, 
viz. 
‘peculiar’ 
properties. 


Now, 
it 
has 
been 
shown 
that 
the 
positing 
of 
one 
thing-be 
it 
one 
term 
or 
one 
premiss-never 
involves 
a 
necessary 
consequent: 
two 
premisses 
constitute 
the 
first 
and 
smallest 
foundation 
for 
drawing 
a 
conclusion 
at 
all 
and 
therefore 
a 
fortiori 
for 
the 
demonstrative 
syllogism 
of 
science. 
If, 
then, 
A 
is 
implied 
in 
B 
and 
C, 
and 
B 
and 
C 
are 
reciprocally 
implied 
in 
one 
another 
and 
in 
A, 
it 
is 
possible, 
as 
has 
been 
shown 
in 
my 
writings 
on 
the 
syllogism, 
to 
prove 
all 
the 
assumptions 
on 
which 
the 
original 
conclusion 
rested, 
by 
circular 
demonstration 
in 
the 
first 
figure. 
But 
it 
has 
also 
been 
shown 
that 
in 
the 
other 
figures 
either 
no 
conclusion 
is 
possible, 
or 
at 
least 
none 
which 
proves 
both 
the 
original 
premisses. 
Propositions 
the 
terms 
of 
which 
are 
not 
convertible 
cannot 
be 
circularly 
demonstrated 
at 
all, 
and 
since 
convertible 
terms 
occur 
rarely 
in 
actual 
demonstrations, 
it 
is 
clearly 
frivolous 
and 
impossible 
to 
say 
that 
demonstration 
is 
reciprocal 
and 
that 
therefore 
everything 
can 
be 
demonstrated. 


Since 
the 
object 
of 
pure 
scientific 
knowledge 
cannot 
be 
other 
than 
it 
is, 
the 
truth 
obtained 
by 
demonstrative 
knowledge 
will 
be 
necessary. 
And 
since 
demonstrative 
knowledge 
is 
only 
present 
when 
we 
have 
a 
demonstration, 
it 
follows 
that 
demonstration 
is 
an 
inference 
from 
necessary 
premisses. 
So 
we 
must 
consider 
what 
are 
the 
premisses 
of 
demonstration-i.e. 
what 
is 
their 
character: 
and 
as 
a 
preliminary, 
let 
us 
define 
what 
we 
mean 
by 
an 
attribute 
‘true 
in 
every 
instance 
of 
its 
subject’, 
an 
‘essential’ 
attribute, 
and 
a 



‘commensurate 
and 
universal’ 
attribute. 
I 
call 
‘true 
in 
every 
instance’ 
what 
is 
truly 
predicable 
of 
all 
instances-not 
of 
one 
to 
the 
exclusion 
of 
others-and 
at 
all 
times, 
not 
at 
this 
or 
that 
time 
only; 
e.g. 
if 
animal 
is 
truly 
predicable 
of 
every 
instance 
of 
man, 
then 
if 
it 
be 
true 
to 
say 
‘this 
is 
a 
man’, 
‘this 
is 
an 
animal’ 
is 
also 
true, 
and 
if 
the 
one 
be 
true 
now 
the 
other 
is 
true 
now. 
A 
corresponding 
account 
holds 
if 
point 
is 
in 
every 
instance 
predicable 
as 
contained 
in 
line. 
There 
is 
evidence 
for 
this 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
objection 
we 
raise 
against 
a 
proposition 
put 
to 
us 
as 
true 
in 
every 
instance 
is 
either 
an 
instance 
in 
which, 
or 
an 
occasion 
on 
which, 
it 
is 
not 
true. 
Essential 
attributes 
are 
(1) 
such 
as 
belong 
to 
their 
subject 
as 
elements 
in 
its 
essential 
nature 
(e.g. 
line 
thus 
belongs 
to 
triangle, 
point 
to 
line; 
for 
the 
very 
being 
or 
‘substance’ 
of 
triangle 
and 
line 
is 
composed 
of 
these 
elements, 
which 
are 
contained 
in 
the 
formulae 
defining 
triangle 
and 
line): 
(2) 
such 
that, 
while 
they 
belong 
to 
certain 
subjects, 
the 
subjects 
to 
which 
they 
belong 
are 
contained 
in 
the 
attribute’s 
own 
defining 
formula. 
Thus 
straight 
and 
curved 
belong 
to 
line, 
odd 
and 
even, 
prime 
and 
compound, 
square 
and 
oblong, 
to 
number; 
and 
also 
the 
formula 
defining 
any 
one 
of 
these 
attributes 
contains 
its 
subject-e.g. 
line 
or 
number 
as 
the 
case 
may 
be. 


Extending 
this 
classification 
to 
all 
other 
attributes, 
I 
distinguish 
those 
that 
answer 
the 
above 
description 
as 
belonging 
essentially 
to 
their 
respective 
subjects; 
whereas 
attributes 
related 
in 
neither 
of 
these 
two 
ways 
to 
their 
subjects 
I 
call 
accidents 
or 
‘coincidents’; 
e.g. 
musical 
or 
white 
is 
a 
‘coincident’ 
of 
animal. 


Further 
(a) 
that 
is 
essential 
which 
is 
not 
predicated 
of 
a 
subject 
other 
than 
itself: 
e.g. 
‘the 
walking 
[thing]’ 
walks 
and 
is 
white 
in 
virtue 
of 
being 
something 
else 
besides; 
whereas 
substance, 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
whatever 
signifies 
a 
‘this 
somewhat’, 
is 
not 
what 
it 
is 
in 
virtue 
of 
being 
something 
else 
besides. 
Things, 
then, 
not 
predicated 
of 
a 
subject 
I 
call 
essential; 
things 
predicated 
of 
a 
subject 
I 
call 
accidental 
or 
‘coincidental’. 


In 
another 
sense 
again 
(b) 
a 
thing 
consequentially 
connected 
with 
anything 
is 
essential; 
one 
not 
so 
connected 
is 
‘coincidental’. 
An 
example 
of 
the 
latter 
is 
‘While 
he 
was 
walking 
it 
lightened’: 
the 
lightning 
was 
not 
due 
to 
his 
walking; 
it 
was, 
we 
should 
say, 
a 
coincidence. 
If, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
there 
is 
a 
consequential 
connexion, 
the 
predication 
is 
essential; 
e.g. 
if 
a 
beast 
dies 
when 
its 
throat 
is 
being 
cut, 
then 
its 
death 
is 
also 
essentially 
connected 
with 
the 
cutting, 
because 
the 
cutting 
was 
the 
cause 
of 
death, 
not 
death 
a 
‘coincident’ 
of 
the 
cutting. 



So 
far 
then 
as 
concerns 
the 
sphere 
of 
connexions 
scientifically 
known 
in 
the 
unqualified 
sense 
of 
that 
term, 
all 
attributes 
which 
(within 
that 
sphere) 
are 
essential 
either 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
their 
subjects 
are 
contained 
in 
them, 
or 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
they 
are 
contained 
in 
their 
subjects, 
are 
necessary 
as 
well 
as 
consequentially 
connected 
with 
their 
subjects. 
For 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
them 
not 
to 
inhere 
in 
their 
subjects 
either 
simply 
or 
in 
the 
qualified 
sense 
that 
one 
or 
other 
of 
a 
pair 
of 
opposites 
must 
inhere 
in 
the 
subject; 
e.g. 
in 
line 
must 
be 
either 
straightness 
or 
curvature, 
in 
number 
either 
oddness 
or 
evenness. 
For 
within 
a 
single 
identical 
genus 
the 
contrary 
of 
a 
given 
attribute 
is 
either 
its 
privative 
or 
its 
contradictory; 
e.g. 
within 
number 
what 
is 
not 
odd 
is 
even, 
inasmuch 
as 
within 
this 
sphere 
even 
is 
a 
necessary 
consequent 
of 
not-odd. 
So, 
since 
any 
given 
predicate 
must 
be 
either 
affirmed 
or 
denied 
of 
any 
subject, 
essential 
attributes 
must 
inhere 
in 
their 
subjects 
of 
necessity. 


Thus, 
then, 
we 
have 
established 
the 
distinction 
between 
the 
attribute 
which 
is 
‘true 
in 
every 
instance’ 
and 
the 
‘essential’ 
attribute. 


I 
term 
‘commensurately 
universal’ 
an 
attribute 
which 
belongs 
to 
every 
instance 
of 
its 
subject, 
and 
to 
every 
instance 
essentially 
and 
as 
such; 
from 
which 
it 
clearly 
follows 
that 
all 
commensurate 
universals 
inhere 
necessarily 
in 
their 
subjects. 
The 
essential 
attribute, 
and 
the 
attribute 
that 
belongs 
to 
its 
subject 
as 
such, 
are 
identical. 
E.g. 
point 
and 
straight 
belong 
to 
line 
essentially, 
for 
they 
belong 
to 
line 
as 
such; 
and 
triangle 
as 
such 
has 
two 
right 
angles, 
for 
it 
is 
essentially 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles. 


An 
attribute 
belongs 
commensurately 
and 
universally 
to 
a 
subject 
when 
it 
can 
be 
shown 
to 
belong 
to 
any 
random 
instance 
of 
that 
subject 
and 
when 
the 
subject 
is 
the 
first 
thing 
to 
which 
it 
can 
be 
shown 
to 
belong. 
Thus, 
e.g. 
(1) 
the 
equality 
of 
its 
angles 
to 
two 
right 
angles 
is 
not 
a 
commensurately 
universal 
attribute 
of 
figure. 
For 
though 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
show 
that 
a 
figure 
has 
its 
angles 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles, 
this 
attribute 
cannot 
be 
demonstrated 
of 
any 
figure 
selected 
at 
haphazard, 
nor 
in 
demonstrating 
does 
one 
take 
a 
figure 
at 
random-a 
square 
is 
a 
figure 
but 
its 
angles 
are 
not 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
any 
isosceles 
triangle 
has 
its 
angles 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles, 
yet 
isosceles 
triangle 
is 
not 
the 
primary 
subject 
of 
this 
attribute 
but 
triangle 
is 
prior. 
So 
whatever 
can 
be 
shown 
to 
have 
its 
angles 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles, 
or 
to 
possess 
any 
other 
attribute, 
in 
any 
random 
instance 
of 
itself 
and 
primarily-that 
is 
the 
first 
subject 
to 
which 
the 
predicate 
in 
question 
belongs 
commensurately 
and 
universally, 
and 
the 
demonstration, 
in 
the 
essential 
sense, 
of 
any 
predicate 
is 
the 
proof 
of 
it 
as 
belonging 
to 
this 
first 



subject 
commensurately 
and 
universally: 
while 
the 
proof 
of 
it 
as 
belonging 
to 
the 
other 
subjects 
to 
which 
it 
attaches 
is 
demonstration 
only 
in 
a 
secondary 
and 
unessential 
sense. 
Nor 
again 
(2) 
is 
equality 
to 
two 
right 
angles 
a 
commensurately 
universal 
attribute 
of 
isosceles; 
it 
is 
of 
wider 
application. 


We 
must 
not 
fail 
to 
observe 
that 
we 
often 
fall 
into 
error 
because 
our 
conclusion 
is 
not 
in 
fact 
primary 
and 
commensurately 
universal 
in 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
we 
think 
we 
prove 
it 
so. 
We 
make 
this 
mistake 
(1) 
when 
the 
subject 
is 
an 
individual 
or 
individuals 
above 
which 
there 
is 
no 
universal 
to 
be 
found: 


(2) 
when 
the 
subjects 
belong 
to 
different 
species 
and 
there 
is 
a 
higher 
universal, 
but 
it 
has 
no 
name: 
(3) 
when 
the 
subject 
which 
the 
demonstrator 
takes 
as 
a 
whole 
is 
really 
only 
a 
part 
of 
a 
larger 
whole; 
for 
then 
the 
demonstration 
will 
be 
true 
of 
the 
individual 
instances 
within 
the 
part 
and 
will 
hold 
in 
every 
instance 
of 
it, 
yet 
the 
demonstration 
will 
not 
be 
true 
of 
this 
subject 
primarily 
and 
commensurately 
and 
universally. 
When 
a 
demonstration 
is 
true 
of 
a 
subject 
primarily 
and 
commensurately 
and 
universally, 
that 
is 
to 
be 
taken 
to 
mean 
that 
it 
is 
true 
of 
a 
given 
subject 
primarily 
and 
as 
such. 
Case 
(3) 
may 
be 
thus 
exemplified. 
If 
a 
proof 
were 
given 
that 
perpendiculars 
to 
the 
same 
line 
are 
parallel, 
it 
might 
be 
supposed 
that 
lines 
thus 
perpendicular 
were 
the 
proper 
subject 
of 
the 
demonstration 
because 
being 
parallel 
is 
true 
of 
every 
instance 
of 
them. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
so, 
for 
the 
parallelism 
depends 
not 
on 
these 
angles 
being 
equal 
to 
one 
another 
because 
each 
is 
a 
right 
angle, 
but 
simply 
on 
their 
being 
equal 
to 
one 
another. 
An 
example 
of 
(1) 
would 
be 
as 
follows: 
if 
isosceles 
were 
the 
only 
triangle, 
it 
would 
be 
thought 
to 
have 
its 
angles 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles 
qua 
isosceles. 
An 
instance 
of 
(2) 
would 
be 
the 
law 
that 
proportionals 
alternate. 
Alternation 
used 
to 
be 
demonstrated 
separately 
of 
numbers, 
lines, 
solids, 
and 
durations, 
though 
it 
could 
have 
been 
proved 
of 
them 
all 
by 
a 
single 
demonstration. 
Because 
there 
was 
no 
single 
name 
to 
denote 
that 
in 
which 
numbers, 
lengths, 
durations, 
and 
solids 
are 
identical, 
and 
because 
they 
differed 
specifically 
from 
one 
another, 
this 
property 
was 
proved 
of 
each 
of 
them 
separately. 
To-day, 
however, 
the 
proof 
is 
commensurately 
universal, 
for 
they 
do 
not 
possess 
this 
attribute 
qua 
lines 
or 
qua 
numbers, 
but 
qua 
manifesting 
this 
generic 
character 
which 
they 
are 
postulated 
as 
possessing 
universally. 
Hence, 
even 
if 
one 
prove 
of 
each 
kind 
of 
triangle 
that 
its 
angles 
are 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles, 
whether 

by 
means 
of 
the 
same 
or 
different 
proofs; 
still, 
as 
long 
as 
one 
treats 
separately 
equilateral, 
scalene, 
and 
isosceles, 
one 
does 
not 
yet 
know, 
except 
sophistically, 
that 
triangle 
has 
its 
angles 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles, 
nor 
does 
one 
yet 
know 
that 
triangle 
has 
this 
property 
commensurately 
and 
universally, 
even 
if 
there 
is 
no 
other 
species 
of 
triangle 
but 
these. 
For 
one 
does 
not 
know 
that 
triangle 
as 
such 
has 
this 
property, 
nor 
even 
that 
‘all’ 
triangles 
have 
it-
unless 
‘all’ 
means 
‘each 
taken 
singly’: 
if 
‘all’ 
means 
‘as 
a 
whole 
class’, 
then, 
though 
there 
be 
none 
in 
which 
one 
does 
not 
recognize 
this 
property, 
one 
does 
not 
know 
it 
of 
‘all 
triangles’. 


When, 
then, 
does 
our 
knowledge 
fail 
of 
commensurate 
universality, 
and 
when 
it 
is 
unqualified 
knowledge? 
If 
triangle 
be 
identical 
in 
essence 
with 
equilateral, 
i.e. 
with 
each 
or 
all 
equilaterals, 
then 
clearly 
we 
have 
unqualified 
knowledge: 
if 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
it 
be 
not, 
and 
the 
attribute 
belongs 
to 
equilateral 
qua 
triangle; 
then 
our 
knowledge 
fails 
of 
commensurate 
universality. 
‘But’, 
it 
will 
be 
asked, 
‘does 
this 
attribute 
belong 
to 
the 
subject 
of 
which 
it 
has 
been 
demonstrated 
qua 
triangle 
or 
qua 
isosceles? 
What 
is 
the 
point 
at 
which 
the 
subject. 
to 
which 
it 
belongs 
is 
primary? 
(i.e. 
to 
what 
subject 
can 
it 
be 
demonstrated 
as 
belonging 
commensurately 
and 
universally?)’ 
Clearly 
this 
point 
is 
the 
first 
term 
in 
which 
it 
is 
found 
to 
inhere 
as 
the 
elimination 
of 
inferior 
differentiae 
proceeds. 
Thus 
the 
angles 
of 
a 
brazen 
isosceles 
triangle 
are 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles: 
but 
eliminate 
brazen 
and 
isosceles 
and 
the 
attribute 
remains. 
‘But’-you 
may 
say-’eliminate 
figure 
or 
limit, 
and 
the 
attribute 
vanishes.’ 
True, 
but 
figure 
and 
limit 
are 
not 
the 
first 
differentiae 
whose 
elimination 
destroys 
the 
attribute. 
‘Then 
what 
is 
the 
first?’ 
If 
it 
is 
triangle, 
it 
will 
be 
in 
virtue 
of 
triangle 
that 
the 
attribute 
belongs 
to 
all 
the 
other 
subjects 
of 
which 
it 
is 
predicable, 
and 
triangle 
is 
the 
subject 
to 
which 
it 
can 
be 
demonstrated 
as 
belonging 
commensurately 
and 
universally. 


Demonstrative 
knowledge 
must 
rest 
on 
necessary 
basic 
truths; 
for 
the 
object 
of 
scientific 
knowledge 
cannot 
be 
other 
than 
it 
is. 
Now 
attributes 
attaching 
essentially 
to 
their 
subjects 
attach 
necessarily 
to 
them: 
for 
essential 
attributes 
are 
either 
elements 
in 
the 
essential 
nature 
of 
their 
subjects, 
or 
contain 
their 
subjects 
as 
elements 
in 
their 
own 
essential 
nature. 
(The 
pairs 
of 
opposites 
which 
the 
latter 
class 
includes 
are 
necessary 
because 
one 
member 
or 
the 
other 
necessarily 
inheres.) 
It 
follows 
from 
this 
that 
premisses 
of 
the 



demonstrative 
syllogism 
must 
be 
connexions 
essential 
in 
the 
sense 
explained: 
for 
all 
attributes 
must 
inhere 
essentially 
or 
else 
be 
accidental, 
and 
accidental 
attributes 
are 
not 
necessary 
to 
their 
subjects. 


We 
must 
either 
state 
the 
case 
thus, 
or 
else 
premise 
that 
the 
conclusion 
of 
demonstration 
is 
necessary 
and 
that 
a 
demonstrated 
conclusion 
cannot 
be 
other 
than 
it 
is, 
and 
then 
infer 
that 
the 
conclusion 
must 
be 
developed 
from 
necessary 
premisses. 
For 
though 
you 
may 
reason 
from 
true 
premisses 
without 
demonstrating, 
yet 
if 
your 
premisses 
are 
necessary 
you 
will 
assuredly 
demonstrate-in 
such 
necessity 
you 
have 
at 
once 
a 
distinctive 
character 
of 
demonstration. 
That 
demonstration 
proceeds 
from 
necessary 
premisses 
is 
also 
indicated 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
objection 
we 
raise 
against 
a 
professed 
demonstration 
is 
that 
a 
premiss 
of 
it 
is 
not 
a 
necessary 
truth-whether 
we 
think 
it 
altogether 
devoid 
of 
necessity, 
or 
at 
any 
rate 
so 
far 
as 
our 
opponent’s 
previous 
argument 
goes. 
This 
shows 
how 
naive 
it 
is 
to 
suppose 
one’s 
basic 
truths 
rightly 
chosen 
if 
one 
starts 
with 
a 
proposition 
which 
is 
(1) 
popularly 
accepted 
and 
(2) 
true, 
such 
as 
the 
sophists’ 
assumption 
that 
to 
know 
is 
the 
same 
as 
to 
possess 
knowledge. 
For 
(1) 
popular 
acceptance 
or 
rejection 
is 
no 
criterion 
of 
a 
basic 
truth, 
which 
can 
only 
be 
the 
primary 
law 
of 
the 
genus 
constituting 
the 
subject 
matter 
of 
the 
demonstration; 
and 
(2) 
not 
all 
truth 
is 
‘appropriate’. 


A 
further 
proof 
that 
the 
conclusion 
must 
be 
the 
development 
of 
necessary 
premisses 
is 
as 
follows. 
Where 
demonstration 
is 
possible, 
one 
who 
can 
give 
no 
account 
which 
includes 
the 
cause 
has 
no 
scientific 
knowledge. 
If, 
then, 
we 
suppose 
a 
syllogism 
in 
which, 
though 
A 
necessarily 
inheres 
in 
C, 
yet 
B, 
the 
middle 
term 
of 
the 
demonstration, 
is 
not 
necessarily 
connected 
with 
A 
and 
C, 
then 
the 
man 
who 
argues 
thus 
has 
no 
reasoned 
knowledge 
of 
the 
conclusion, 
since 
this 
conclusion 
does 
not 
owe 
its 
necessity 
to 
the 
middle 
term; 
for 
though 
the 
conclusion 
is 
necessary, 
the 
mediating 
link 
is 
a 
contingent 
fact. 
Or 
again, 
if 
a 
man 
is 
without 
knowledge 
now, 
though 
he 
still 
retains 
the 
steps 
of 
the 
argument, 
though 
there 
is 
no 
change 
in 
himself 
or 
in 
the 
fact 
and 
no 
lapse 
of 
memory 
on 
his 
part; 
then 
neither 
had 
he 
knowledge 
previously. 
But 
the 
mediating 
link, 
not 
being 
necessary, 
may 
have 
perished 
in 
the 
interval; 
and 
if 
so, 
though 
there 
be 
no 
change 
in 
him 
nor 
in 
the 
fact, 
and 
though 
he 
will 
still 
retain 
the 
steps 
of 
the 
argument, 
yet 
he 
has 
not 
knowledge, 
and 
therefore 
had 
not 
knowledge 
before. 
Even 
if 
the 
link 
has 
not 
actually 
perished 
but 
is 
liable 
to 
perish, 
this 
situation 
is 
possible 
and 
might 
occur. 
But 
such 
a 
condition 
cannot 
be 
knowledge. 



When 
the 
conclusion 
is 
necessary, 
the 
middle 
through 
which 
it 
was 
proved 
may 
yet 
quite 
easily 
be 
non-necessary. 
You 
can 
in 
fact 
infer 
the 
necessary 
even 
from 
a 
non-necessary 
premiss, 
just 
as 
you 
can 
infer 
the 
true 
from 
the 
not 
true. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
when 
the 
middle 
is 
necessary 
the 
conclusion 
must 
be 
necessary; 
just 
as 
true 
premisses 
always 
give 
a 
true 
conclusion. 
Thus, 
if 
A 
is 
necessarily 
predicated 
of 
B 
and 
B 
of 
C, 
then 
A 
is 
necessarily 
predicated 
of 
C. 
But 
when 
the 
conclusion 
is 
nonnecessary 
the 
middle 
cannot 
be 
necessary 
either. 
Thus: 
let 
A 
be 
predicated 
non-necessarily 
of 
C 
but 
necessarily 
of 
B, 
and 
let 
B 
be 
a 
necessary 
predicate 
of 
C; 
then 
A 
too 
will 
be 
a 
necessary 
predicate 
of 
C, 
which 
by 
hypothesis 
it 
is 
not. 


To 
sum 
up, 
then: 
demonstrative 
knowledge 
must 
be 
knowledge 
of 
a 
necessary 
nexus, 
and 
therefore 
must 
clearly 
be 
obtained 
through 
a 
necessary 
middle 
term; 
otherwise 
its 
possessor 
will 
know 
neither 
the 
cause 
nor 
the 
fact 
that 
his 
conclusion 
is 
a 
necessary 
connexion. 
Either 
he 
will 
mistake 
the 
non-
necessary 
for 
the 
necessary 
and 
believe 
the 
necessity 
of 
the 
conclusion 
without 
knowing 
it, 
or 
else 
he 
will 
not 
even 
believe 
it-in 
which 
case 
he 
will 
be 
equally 
ignorant, 
whether 
he 
actually 
infers 
the 
mere 
fact 
through 
middle 
terms 
or 
the 
reasoned 
fact 
and 
from 
immediate 
premisses. 


Of 
accidents 
that 
are 
not 
essential 
according 
to 
our 
definition 
of 
essential 
there 
is 
no 
demonstrative 
knowledge; 
for 
since 
an 
accident, 
in 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
I 
here 
speak 
of 
it, 
may 
also 
not 
inhere, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
prove 
its 
inherence 
as 
a 
necessary 
conclusion. 
A 
difficulty, 
however, 
might 
be 
raised 
as 
to 
why 
in 
dialectic, 
if 
the 
conclusion 
is 
not 
a 
necessary 
connexion, 
such 
and 
such 
determinate 
premisses 
should 
be 
proposed 
in 
order 
to 
deal 
with 
such 
and 
such 
determinate 
problems. 
Would 
not 
the 
result 
be 
the 
same 
if 
one 
asked 
any 
questions 
whatever 
and 
then 
merely 
stated 
one’s 
conclusion? 
The 
solution 
is 
that 
determinate 
questions 
have 
to 
be 
put, 
not 
because 
the 
replies 
to 
them 
affirm 
facts 
which 
necessitate 
facts 
affirmed 
by 
the 
conclusion, 
but 
because 
these 
answers 
are 
propositions 
which 
if 
the 
answerer 
affirm, 
he 
must 
affirm 
the 
conclusion 
and 
affirm 
it 
with 
truth 
if 
they 
are 
true. 


Since 
it 
is 
just 
those 
attributes 
within 
every 
genus 
which 
are 
essential 
and 
possessed 
by 
their 
respective 
subjects 
as 
such 
that 
are 
necessary 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
both 
the 
conclusions 
and 
the 
premisses 
of 
demonstrations 
which 
produce 
scientific 
knowledge 
are 
essential. 
For 
accidents 
are 
not 
necessary: 
and, 
further, 
since 
accidents 
are 
not 
necessary 
one 
does 
not 
necessarily 
have 
reasoned 
knowledge 
of 
a 
conclusion 
drawn 
from 
them 
(this 
is 
so 
even 
if 
the 
accidental 
premisses 
are 
invariable 
but 
not 
essential, 
as 
in 
proofs 
through 



signs; 
for 
though 
the 
conclusion 
be 
actually 
essential, 
one 
will 
not 
know 
it 
as 
essential 
nor 
know 
its 
reason); 
but 
to 
have 
reasoned 
knowledge 
of 
a 
conclusion 
is 
to 
know 
it 
through 
its 
cause. 
We 
may 
conclude 
that 
the 
middle 
must 
be 
consequentially 
connected 
with 
the 
minor, 
and 
the 
major 
with 
the 
middle. 


It 
follows 
that 
we 
cannot 
in 
demonstrating 
pass 
from 
one 
genus 
to 
another. 
We 
cannot, 
for 
instance, 
prove 
geometrical 
truths 
by 
arithmetic. 
For 
there 
are 
three 
elements 
in 
demonstration: 
(1) 
what 
is 
proved, 
the 
conclusion-an 
attribute 
inhering 
essentially 
in 
a 
genus; 
(2) 
the 
axioms, 
i.e. 
axioms 
which 
are 
premisses 
of 
demonstration; 
(3) 
the 
subject-genus 
whose 
attributes, 
i.e. 
essential 
properties, 
are 
revealed 
by 
the 
demonstration. 
The 
axioms 
which 
are 
premisses 
of 
demonstration 
may 
be 
identical 
in 
two 
or 
more 
sciences: 
but 
in 
the 
case 
of 
two 
different 
genera 
such 
as 
arithmetic 
and 
geometry 
you 
cannot 
apply 
arithmetical 
demonstration 
to 
the 
properties 
of 
magnitudes 
unless 
the 
magnitudes 
in 
question 
are 
numbers. 
How 
in 
certain 
cases 
transference 
is 
possible 
I 
will 
explain 
later. 


Arithmetical 
demonstration 
and 
the 
other 
sciences 
likewise 
possess, 
each 
of 
them, 
their 
own 
genera; 
so 
that 
if 
the 
demonstration 
is 
to 
pass 
from 
one 
sphere 
to 
another, 
the 
genus 
must 
be 
either 
absolutely 
or 
to 
some 
extent 
the 
same. 
If 
this 
is 
not 
so, 
transference 
is 
clearly 
impossible, 
because 
the 
extreme 
and 
the 
middle 
terms 
must 
be 
drawn 
from 
the 
same 
genus: 
otherwise, 
as 
predicated, 
they 
will 
not 
be 
essential 
and 
will 
thus 
be 
accidents. 
That 
is 
why 
it 
cannot 
be 
proved 
by 
geometry 
that 
opposites 
fall 
under 
one 
science, 
nor 
even 
that 
the 
product 
of 
two 
cubes 
is 
a 
cube. 
Nor 
can 
the 
theorem 
of 
any 
one 
science 
be 
demonstrated 
by 
means 
of 
another 
science, 
unless 
these 
theorems 
are 
related 
as 
subordinate 
to 
superior 
(e.g. 
as 
optical 
theorems 
to 
geometry 
or 
harmonic 
theorems 
to 
arithmetic). 
Geometry 
again 
cannot 
prove 
of 
lines 
any 
property 
which 
they 
do 
not 
possess 
qua 
lines, 
i.e. 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
fundamental 
truths 
of 
their 
peculiar 
genus: 
it 
cannot 
show, 
for 
example, 
that 
the 
straight 
line 
is 
the 
most 
beautiful 
of 
lines 
or 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
circle; 
for 
these 
qualities 
do 
not 
belong 
to 
lines 
in 
virtue 
of 
their 
peculiar 
genus, 
but 
through 
some 
property 
which 
it 
shares 
with 
other 
genera. 



It 
is 
also 
clear 
that 
if 
the 
premisses 
from 
which 
the 
syllogism 
proceeds 
are 
commensurately 
universal, 
the 
conclusion 
of 
such 
i.e. 
in 
the 
unqualified 
sense-must 
also 
be 
eternal. 
Therefore 
no 
attribute 
can 
be 
demonstrated 
nor 
known 
by 
strictly 
scientific 
knowledge 
to 
inhere 
in 
perishable 
things. 
The 
proof 
can 
only 
be 
accidental, 
because 
the 
attribute’s 
connexion 
with 
its 
perishable 
subject 
is 
not 
commensurately 
universal 
but 
temporary 
and 
special. 
If 
such 
a 
demonstration 
is 
made, 
one 
premiss 
must 
be 
perishable 
and 
not 
commensurately 
universal 
(perishable 
because 
only 
if 
it 
is 
perishable 
will 
the 
conclusion 
be 
perishable; 
not 
commensurately 
universal, 
because 
the 
predicate 
will 
be 
predicable 
of 
some 
instances 
of 
the 
subject 
and 
not 
of 
others); 
so 
that 
the 
conclusion 
can 
only 
be 
that 
a 
fact 
is 
true 
at 
the 
moment-
not 
commensurately 
and 
universally. 
The 
same 
is 
true 
of 
definitions, 
since 
a 
definition 
is 
either 
a 
primary 
premiss 
or 
a 
conclusion 
of 
a 
demonstration, 
or 
else 
only 
differs 
from 
a 
demonstration 
in 
the 
order 
of 
its 
terms. 
Demonstration 
and 
science 
of 
merely 
frequent 
occurrences-e.g. 
of 
eclipse 
as 
happening 
to 
the 
moon-are, 
as 
such, 
clearly 
eternal: 
whereas 
so 
far 
as 
they 
are 
not 
eternal 
they 
are 
not 
fully 
commensurate. 
Other 
subjects 
too 
have 
properties 
attaching 
to 
them 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
eclipse 
attaches 
to 
the 
moon. 


It 
is 
clear 
that 
if 
the 
conclusion 
is 
to 
show 
an 
attribute 
inhering 
as 
such, 
nothing 
can 
be 
demonstrated 
except 
from 
its 
‘appropriate’ 
basic 
truths. 
Consequently 
a 
proof 
even 
from 
true, 
indemonstrable, 
and 
immediate 
premisses 
does 
not 
constitute 
knowledge. 
Such 
proofs 
are 
like 
Bryson’s 
method 
of 
squaring 
the 
circle; 
for 
they 
operate 
by 
taking 
as 
their 
middle 
a 
common 
character-a 
character, 
therefore, 
which 
the 
subject 
may 
share 
with 
another-and 
consequently 
they 
apply 
equally 
to 
subjects 
different 
in 
kind. 
They 
therefore 
afford 
knowledge 
of 
an 
attribute 
only 
as 
inhering 
accidentally, 
not 
as 
belonging 
to 
its 
subject 
as 
such: 
otherwise 
they 
would 
not 
have 
been 
applicable 
to 
another 
genus. 


Our 
knowledge 
of 
any 
attribute’s 
connexion 
with 
a 
subject 
is 
accidental 
unless 
we 
know 
that 
connexion 
through 
the 
middle 
term 
in 
virtue 
of 
which 
it 
inheres, 
and 
as 
an 
inference 
from 
basic 
premisses 
essential 
and 
‘appropriate’ 
to 
the 
subject-unless 
we 
know, 
e.g. 
the 
property 
of 
possessing 
angles 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles 
as 
belonging 
to 
that 
subject 
in 
which 
it 
inheres 
essentially, 
and 
as 
inferred 
from 
basic 
premisses 
essential 
and 
‘appropriate’ 
to 
that 



subject: 
so 
that 
if 
that 
middle 
term 
also 
belongs 
essentially 
to 
the 
minor, 
the 
middle 
must 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
kind 
as 
the 
major 
and 
minor 
terms. 
The 
only 
exceptions 
to 
this 
rule 
are 
such 
cases 
as 
theorems 
in 
harmonics 
which 
are 
demonstrable 
by 
arithmetic. 
Such 
theorems 
are 
proved 
by 
the 
same 
middle 
terms 
as 
arithmetical 
properties, 
but 
with 
a 
qualification-the 
fact 
falls 
under 
a 
separate 
science 
(for 
the 
subject 
genus 
is 
separate), 
but 
the 
reasoned 
fact 
concerns 
the 
superior 
science, 
to 
which 
the 
attributes 
essentially 
belong. 
Thus, 
even 
these 
apparent 
exceptions 
show 
that 
no 
attribute 
is 
strictly 
demonstrable 
except 
from 
its 
‘appropriate’ 
basic 
truths, 
which, 
however, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
these 
sciences 
have 
the 
requisite 
identity 
of 
character. 


It 
is 
no 
less 
evident 
that 
the 
peculiar 
basic 
truths 
of 
each 
inhering 
attribute 
are 
indemonstrable; 
for 
basic 
truths 
from 
which 
they 
might 
be 
deduced 
would 
be 
basic 
truths 
of 
all 
that 
is, 
and 
the 
science 
to 
which 
they 
belonged 
would 
possess 
universal 
sovereignty. 
This 
is 
so 
because 
he 
knows 
better 
whose 
knowledge 
is 
deduced 
from 
higher 
causes, 
for 
his 
knowledge 
is 
from 
prior 
premisses 
when 
it 
derives 
from 
causes 
themselves 
uncaused: 
hence, 
if 
he 
knows 
better 
than 
others 
or 
best 
of 
all, 
his 
knowledge 
would 
be 
science 
in 
a 
higher 
or 
the 
highest 
degree. 
But, 
as 
things 
are, 
demonstration 
is 
not 
transferable 
to 
another 
genus, 
with 
such 
exceptions 
as 
we 
have 
mentioned 
of 
the 
application 
of 
geometrical 
demonstrations 
to 
theorems 
in 
mechanics 
or 
optics, 
or 
of 
arithmetical 
demonstrations 
to 
those 
of 
harmonics. 


It 
is 
hard 
to 
be 
sure 
whether 
one 
knows 
or 
not; 
for 
it 
is 
hard 
to 
be 
sure 
whether 
one’s 
knowledge 
is 
based 
on 
the 
basic 
truths 
appropriate 
to 
each 
attribute-the 
differentia 
of 
true 
knowledge. 
We 
think 
we 
have 
scientific 
knowledge 
if 
we 
have 
reasoned 
from 
true 
and 
primary 
premisses. 
But 
that 
is 
not 
so: 
the 
conclusion 
must 
be 
homogeneous 
with 
the 
basic 
facts 
of 
the 
science. 


I 
call 
the 
basic 
truths 
of 
every 
genus 
those 
clements 
in 
it 
the 
existence 
of 
which 
cannot 
be 
proved. 
As 
regards 
both 
these 
primary 
truths 
and 
the 
attributes 
dependent 
on 
them 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
name 
is 
assumed. 
The 
fact 
of 
their 
existence 
as 
regards 
the 
primary 
truths 
must 
be 
assumed; 
but 
it 
has 
to 
be 
proved 
of 
the 
remainder, 
the 
attributes. 
Thus 
we 
assume 
the 
meaning 
alike 
of 
unity, 
straight, 
and 
triangular; 
but 
while 
as 
regards 
unity 
and 
magnitude 
we 
assume 
also 
the 
fact 
of 
their 
existence, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
remainder 
proof 
is 



required. 


Of 
the 
basic 
truths 
used 
in 
the 
demonstrative 
sciences 
some 
are 
peculiar 
to 
each 
science, 
and 
some 
are 
common, 
but 
common 
only 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
analogous, 
being 
of 
use 
only 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
fall 
within 
the 
genus 
constituting 
the 
province 
of 
the 
science 
in 
question. 


Peculiar 
truths 
are, 
e.g. 
the 
definitions 
of 
line 
and 
straight; 
common 
truths 
are 
such 
as 
‘take 
equals 
from 
equals 
and 
equals 
remain’. 
Only 
so 
much 
of 
these 
common 
truths 
is 
required 
as 
falls 
within 
the 
genus 
in 
question: 
for 
a 
truth 
of 
this 
kind 
will 
have 
the 
same 
force 
even 
if 
not 
used 
generally 
but 
applied 
by 
the 
geometer 
only 
to 
magnitudes, 
or 
by 
the 
arithmetician 
only 
to 
numbers. 
Also 
peculiar 
to 
a 
science 
are 
the 
subjects 
the 
existence 
as 
well 
as 
the 
meaning 
of 
which 
it 
assumes, 
and 
the 
essential 
attributes 
of 
which 
it 
investigates, 
e.g. 
in 
arithmetic 
units, 
in 
geometry 
points 
and 
lines. 
Both 
the 
existence 
and 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
subjects 
are 
assumed 
by 
these 
sciences; 
but 
of 
their 
essential 
attributes 
only 
the 
meaning 
is 
assumed. 
For 
example 
arithmetic 
assumes 
the 
meaning 
of 
odd 
and 
even, 
square 
and 
cube, 
geometry 
that 
of 
incommensurable, 
or 
of 
deflection 
or 
verging 
of 
lines, 
whereas 
the 
existence 
of 
these 
attributes 
is 
demonstrated 
by 
means 
of 
the 
axioms 
and 
from 
previous 
conclusions 
as 
premisses. 
Astronomy 
too 
proceeds 
in 
the 
same 
way. 
For 
indeed 
every 
demonstrative 
science 
has 
three 
elements: 
(1) 
that 
which 
it 
posits, 
the 
subject 
genus 
whose 
essential 
attributes 
it 
examines; 
(2) 
the 
so-called 
axioms, 
which 
are 
primary 
premisses 
of 
its 
demonstration; 
(3) 
the 
attributes, 
the 
meaning 
of 
which 
it 
assumes. 
Yet 
some 
sciences 
may 
very 
well 
pass 
over 
some 
of 
these 
elements; 
e.g. 
we 
might 
not 
expressly 
posit 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
genus 
if 
its 
existence 
were 
obvious 
(for 
instance, 
the 
existence 
of 
hot 
and 
cold 
is 
more 
evident 
than 
that 
of 
number); 
or 
we 
might 
omit 
to 
assume 
expressly 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
attributes 
if 
it 
were 
well 
understood. 
In 
the 
way 
the 
meaning 
of 
axioms, 
such 
as 
‘Take 
equals 
from 
equals 
and 
equals 
remain’, 
is 
well 
known 
and 
so 
not 
expressly 
assumed. 
Nevertheless 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
case 
the 
essential 
elements 
of 
demonstration 
are 
three: 
the 
subject, 
the 
attributes, 
and 
the 
basic 
premisses. 


That 
which 
expresses 
necessary 
self-grounded 
fact, 
and 
which 
we 
must 
necessarily 
believe, 
is 
distinct 
both 
from 
the 
hypotheses 
of 
a 
science 
and 
from 
illegitimate 
postulate-I 
say 
‘must 
believe’, 
because 
all 
syllogism, 
and 
therefore 
a 
fortiori 
demonstration, 
is 
addressed 
not 
to 
the 
spoken 
word, 
but 
to 
the 
discourse 
within 
the 
soul, 
and 
though 
we 
can 
always 
raise 
objections 
to 
the 
spoken 
word, 
to 
the 
inward 
discourse 
we 
cannot 
always 
object. 
That 



which 
is 
capable 
of 
proof 
but 
assumed 
by 
the 
teacher 
without 
proof 
is, 
if 
the 
pupil 
believes 
and 
accepts 
it, 
hypothesis, 
though 
only 
in 
a 
limited 
sense 
hypothesis-that 
is, 
relatively 
to 
the 
pupil; 
if 
the 
pupil 
has 
no 
opinion 
or 
a 
contrary 
opinion 
on 
the 
matter, 
the 
same 
assumption 
is 
an 
illegitimate 
postulate. 
Therein 
lies 
the 
distinction 
between 
hypothesis 
and 
illegitimate 
postulate: 
the 
latter 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
pupil’s 
opinion, 
demonstrable, 
but 
assumed 
and 
used 
without 
demonstration. 


The 
definition-viz. 
those 
which 
are 
not 
expressed 
as 
statements 
that 
anything 
is 
or 
is 
not-are 
not 
hypotheses: 
but 
it 
is 
in 
the 
premisses 
of 
a 
science 
that 
its 
hypotheses 
are 
contained. 
Definitions 
require 
only 
to 
be 
understood, 
and 
this 
is 
not 
hypothesis-unless 
it 
be 
contended 
that 
the 
pupil’s 
hearing 
is 
also 
an 
hypothesis 
required 
by 
the 
teacher. 
Hypotheses, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
postulate 
facts 
on 
the 
being 
of 
which 
depends 
the 
being 
of 
the 
fact 
inferred. 
Nor 
are 
the 
geometer’s 
hypotheses 
false, 
as 
some 
have 
held, 
urging 
that 
one 
must 
not 
employ 
falsehood 
and 
that 
the 
geometer 
is 
uttering 
falsehood 
in 
stating 
that 
the 
line 
which 
he 
draws 
is 
a 
foot 
long 
or 
straight, 
when 
it 
is 
actually 
neither. 
The 
truth 
is 
that 
the 
geometer 
does 
not 
draw 
any 
conclusion 
from 
the 
being 
of 
the 
particular 
line 
of 
which 
he 
speaks, 
but 
from 
what 
his 
diagrams 
symbolize. 
A 
further 
distinction 
is 
that 
all 
hypotheses 
and 
illegitimate 
postulates 
are 
either 
universal 
or 
particular, 
whereas 
a 
definition 
is 
neither. 


So 
demonstration 
does 
not 
necessarily 
imply 
the 
being 
of 
Forms 
nor 
a 
One 
beside 
a 
Many, 
but 
it 
does 
necessarily 
imply 
the 
possibility 
of 
truly 
predicating 
one 
of 
many; 
since 
without 
this 
possibility 
we 
cannot 
save 
the 
universal, 
and 
if 
the 
universal 
goes, 
the 
middle 
term 
goes 
witb. 
it, 
and 
so 
demonstration 
becomes 
impossible. 
We 
conclude, 
then, 
that 
there 
must 
be 
a 
single 
identical 
term 
unequivocally 
predicable 
of 
a 
number 
of 
individuals. 


The 
law 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
affirm 
and 
deny 
simultaneously 
the 
same 
predicate 
of 
the 
same 
subject 
is 
not 
expressly 
posited 
by 
any 
demonstration 
except 
when 
the 
conclusion 
also 
has 
to 
be 
expressed 
in 
that 
form; 
in 
which 
case 
the 
proof 
lays 
down 
as 
its 
major 
premiss 
that 
the 
major 
is 
truly 
affirmed 
of 
the 
middle 
but 
falsely 
denied. 
It 
makes 
no 
difference, 
however, 
if 
we 
add 
to 
the 
middle, 
or 
again 
to 
the 
minor 
term, 
the 
corresponding 
negative. 
For 
grant 
a 
minor 
term 
of 
which 
it 
is 
true 
to 
predicate 
man-even 
if 
it 
be 
also 
true 



to 
predicate 
not-man 
of 
it—still 
grant 
simply 
that 
man 
is 
animal 
and 
not 
not-
animal, 
and 
the 
conclusion 
follows: 
for 
it 
will 
still 
be 
true 
to 
say 
that 
Callias 
—even 
if 
it 
be 
also 
true 
to 
say 
that 
not-Callias—is 
animal 
and 
not 
not-animal. 
The 
reason 
is 
that 
the 
major 
term 
is 
predicable 
not 
only 
of 
the 
middle, 
but 
of 
something 
other 
than 
the 
middle 
as 
well, 
being 
of 
wider 
application; 
so 
that 
the 
conclusion 
is 
not 
affected 
even 
if 
the 
middle 
is 
extended 
to 
cover 
the 
original 
middle 
term 
and 
also 
what 
is 
not 
the 
original 
middle 
term. 


The 
law 
that 
every 
predicate 
can 
be 
either 
truly 
affirmed 
or 
truly 
denied 
of 
every 
subject 
is 
posited 
by 
such 
demonstration 
as 
uses 
reductio 
ad 
impossibile, 
and 
then 
not 
always 
universally, 
but 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
requisite; 
within 
the 
limits, 
that 
is, 
of 
the 
genus-the 
genus, 
I 
mean 
(as 
I 
have 
already 
explained), 
to 
which 
the 
man 
of 
science 
applies 
his 
demonstrations. 
In 
virtue 
of 
the 
common 
elements 
of 
demonstration-I 
mean 
the 
common 
axioms 
which 
are 
used 
as 
premisses 
of 
demonstration, 
not 
the 
subjects 
nor 
the 
attributes 
demonstrated 
as 
belonging 
to 
them-all 
the 
sciences 
have 
communion 
with 
one 
another, 
and 
in 
communion 
with 
them 
all 
is 
dialectic 
and 
any 
science 
which 
might 
attempt 
a 
universal 
proof 
of 
axioms 
such 
as 
the 
law 
of 
excluded 
middle, 
the 
law 
that 
the 
subtraction 
of 
equals 
from 
equals 
leaves 
equal 
remainders, 
or 
other 
axioms 
of 
the 
same 
kind. 
Dialectic 
has 
no 
definite 
sphere 
of 
this 
kind, 
not 
being 
confined 
to 
a 
single 
genus. 
Otherwise 
its 
method 
would 
not 
be 
interrogative; 
for 
the 
interrogative 
method 
is 
barred 
to 
the 
demonstrator, 
who 
cannot 
use 
the 
opposite 
facts 
to 
prove 
the 
same 
nexus. 
This 
was 
shown 
in 
my 
work 
on 
the 
syllogism. 


If 
a 
syllogistic 
question 
is 
equivalent 
to 
a 
proposition 
embodying 
one 
of 
the 
two 
sides 
of 
a 
contradiction, 
and 
if 
each 
science 
has 
its 
peculiar 
propositions 
from 
which 
its 
peculiar 
conclusion 
is 
developed, 
then 
there 
is 
such 
a 
thing 
as 
a 
distinctively 
scientific 
question, 
and 
it 
is 
the 
interrogative 
form 
of 
the 
premisses 
from 
which 
the 
‘appropriate’ 
conclusion 
of 
each 
science 
is 
developed. 
Hence 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
not 
every 
question 
will 
be 
relevant 
to 
geometry, 
nor 
to 
medicine, 
nor 
to 
any 
other 
science: 
only 
those 
questions 
will 
be 
geometrical 
which 
form 
premisses 
for 
the 
proof 
of 
the 
theorems 
of 
geometry 
or 
of 
any 
other 
science, 
such 
as 
optics, 
which 
uses 
the 
same 
basic 
truths 
as 
geometry. 
Of 
the 
other 
sciences 
the 
like 
is 
true. 
Of 
these 
questions 
the 
geometer 
is 
bound 
to 
give 
his 
account, 
using 
the 
basic 
truths 
of 
geometry 



in 
conjunction 
with 
his 
previous 
conclusions; 
of 
the 
basic 
truths 
the 
geometer, 
as 
such, 
is 
not 
bound 
to 
give 
any 
account. 
The 
like 
is 
true 
of 
the 
other 
sciences. 
There 
is 
a 
limit, 
then, 
to 
the 
questions 
which 
we 
may 
put 
to 
each 
man 
of 
science; 
nor 
is 
each 
man 
of 
science 
bound 
to 
answer 
all 
inquiries 
on 
each 
several 
subject, 
but 
only 
such 
as 
fall 
within 
the 
defined 
field 
of 
his 
own 
science. 
If, 
then, 
in 
controversy 
with 
a 
geometer 
qua 
geometer 
the 
disputant 
confines 
himself 
to 
geometry 
and 
proves 
anything 
from 
geometrical 
premisses, 
he 
is 
clearly 
to 
be 
applauded; 
if 
he 
goes 
outside 
these 
he 
will 
be 
at 
fault, 
and 
obviously 
cannot 
even 
refute 
the 
geometer 
except 
accidentally. 
One 
should 
therefore 
not 
discuss 
geometry 
among 
those 
who 
are 
not 
geometers, 
for 
in 
such 
a 
company 
an 
unsound 
argument 
will 
pass 
unnoticed. 
This 
is 
correspondingly 
true 
in 
the 
other 
sciences. 


Since 
there 
are 
‘geometrical’ 
questions, 
does 
it 
follow 
that 
there 
are 
also 
distinctively 
‘ungeometrical’ 
questions? 
Further, 
in 
each 
special 
science-
geometry 
for 
instance-what 
kind 
of 
error 
is 
it 
that 
may 
vitiate 
questions, 
and 
yet 
not 
exclude 
them 
from 
that 
science? 
Again, 
is 
the 
erroneous 
conclusion 
one 
constructed 
from 
premisses 
opposite 
to 
the 
true 
premisses, 
or 
is 
it 
formal 
fallacy 
though 
drawn 
from 
geometrical 
premisses? 
Or, 
perhaps, 
the 
erroneous 
conclusion 
is 
due 
to 
the 
drawing 
of 
premisses 
from 
another 
science; 
e.g. 
in 
a 
geometrical 
controversy 
a 
musical 
question 
is 
distinctively 
ungeometrical, 
whereas 
the 
notion 
that 
parallels 
meet 
is 
in 
one 
sense 
geometrical, 
being 
ungeometrical 
in 
a 
different 
fashion: 
the 
reason 
being 
that 
‘ungeometrical’, 
like 
‘unrhythmical’, 
is 
equivocal, 
meaning 
in 
the 
one 
case 
not 
geometry 
at 
all, 
in 
the 
other 
bad 
geometry? 
It 
is 
this 
error, 
i.e. 
error 
based 
on 
premisses 
of 
this 
kind-’of’ 
the 
science 
but 
false-that 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
science. 
In 
mathematics 
the 
formal 
fallacy 
is 
not 
so 
common, 
because 
it 
is 
the 
middle 
term 
in 
which 
the 
ambiguity 
lies, 
since 
the 
major 
is 
predicated 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
middle 
and 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
minor 
(the 
predicate 
of 
course 
never 
has 
the 
prefix 
‘all’); 
and 
in 
mathematics 
one 
can, 
so 
to 
speak, 
see 
these 
middle 
terms 
with 
an 
intellectual 
vision, 
while 
in 
dialectic 
the 
ambiguity 
may 
escape 
detection. 
E.g. 
‘Is 
every 
circle 
a 
figure?’ 
A 
diagram 
shows 
that 
this 
is 
so, 
but 
the 
minor 
premiss 
‘Are 
epics 
circles?’ 
is 
shown 
by 
the 
diagram 
to 
be 
false. 


If 
a 
proof 
has 
an 
inductive 
minor 
premiss, 
one 
should 
not 
bring 
an 
‘objection’ 
against 
it. 
For 
since 
every 
premiss 
must 
be 
applicable 
to 
a 
number 
of 
cases 
(otherwise 
it 
will 
not 
be 
true 
in 
every 
instance, 
which, 
since 
the 
syllogism 
proceeds 
from 
universals, 
it 
must 
be), 
then 
assuredly 
the 
same 
is 
true 
of 
an 
‘objection’; 
since 
premisses 
and 
‘objections’ 
are 
so 
far 
the 
same 



that 
anything 
which 
can 
be 
validly 
advanced 
as 
an 
‘objection’ 
must 
be 
such 
that 
it 
could 
take 
the 
form 
of 
a 
premiss, 
either 
demonstrative 
or 
dialectical. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
arguments 
formally 
illogical 
do 
sometimes 
occur 
through 
taking 
as 
middles 
mere 
attributes 
of 
the 
major 
and 
minor 
terms. 
An 
instance 
of 
this 
is 
Caeneus’ 
proof 
that 
fire 
increases 
in 
geometrical 
proportion: 
‘Fire’, 
he 
argues, 
‘increases 
rapidly, 
and 
so 
does 
geometrical 
proportion’. 
There 
is 
no 
syllogism 
so, 
but 
there 
is 
a 
syllogism 
if 
the 
most 
rapidly 
increasing 
proportion 
is 
geometrical 
and 
the 
most 
rapidly 
increasing 
proportion 
is 
attributable 
to 
fire 
in 
its 
motion. 
Sometimes, 
no 
doubt, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
reason 
from 
premisses 
predicating 
mere 
attributes: 
but 
sometimes 
it 
is 
possible, 
though 
the 
possibility 
is 
overlooked. 
If 
false 
premisses 
could 
never 
give 
true 
conclusions 
‘resolution’ 
would 
be 
easy, 
for 
premisses 
and 
conclusion 
would 
in 
that 
case 
inevitably 
reciprocate. 
I 
might 
then 
argue 
thus: 
let 
A 
be 
an 
existing 
fact; 
let 
the 
existence 
of 
A 
imply 
such 
and 
such 
facts 
actually 
known 
to 
me 
to 
exist, 
which 
we 
may 
call 
B. 
I 
can 
now, 
since 
they 
reciprocate, 
infer 
A 
from 
B. 


Reciprocation 
of 
premisses 
and 
conclusion 
is 
more 
frequent 
in 
mathematics, 
because 
mathematics 
takes 
definitions, 
but 
never 
an 
accident, 
for 
its 
premisses-a 
second 
characteristic 
distinguishing 
mathematical 
reasoning 
from 
dialectical 
disputations. 


A 
science 
expands 
not 
by 
the 
interposition 
of 
fresh 
middle 
terms, 
but 
by 
the 
apposition 
of 
fresh 
extreme 
terms. 
E.g. 
A 
is 
predicated 
of 
B, 
B 
of 
C, 
C 
of 
D, 
and 
so 
indefinitely. 
Or 
the 
expansion 
may 
be 
lateral: 
e.g. 
one 
major 
A, 
may 
be 
proved 
of 
two 
minors, 
C 
and 
E. 
Thus 
let 
A 
represent 
number-a 
number 
or 
number 
taken 
indeterminately; 
B 
determinate 
odd 
number; 
C 
any 
particular 
odd 
number. 
We 
can 
then 
predicate 
A 
of 
C. 
Next 
let 
D 
represent 
determinate 
even 
number, 
and 
E 
even 
number. 
Then 
A 
is 
predicable 
of 
E. 


Knowledge 
of 
the 
fact 
differs 
from 
knowledge 
of 
the 
reasoned 
fact. 
To 
begin 
with, 
they 
differ 
within 
the 
same 
science 
and 
in 
two 
ways: 
(1) 
when 
the 
premisses 
of 
the 
syllogism 
are 
not 
immediate 
(for 
then 
the 
proximate 
cause 
is 
not 
contained 
in 
them-a 
necessary 
condition 
of 
knowledge 
of 
the 
reasoned 
fact): 
(2) 
when 
the 
premisses 
are 
immediate, 
but 
instead 
of 
the 
cause 
the 
better 
known 
of 
the 
two 
reciprocals 
is 
taken 
as 
the 
middle; 
for 
of 
two 
reciprocally 
predicable 
terms 
the 
one 
which 
is 
not 
the 
cause 
may 
quite 
easily 



be 
the 
better 
known 
and 
so 
become 
the 
middle 
term 
of 
the 
demonstration. 
Thus 
(2) 
(a) 
you 
might 
prove 
as 
follows 
that 
the 
planets 
are 
near 
because 
they 
do 
not 
twinkle: 
let 
C 
be 
the 
planets, 
B 
not 
twinkling, 
A 
proximity. 
Then 
B 
is 
predicable 
of 
C; 
for 
the 
planets 
do 
not 
twinkle. 
But 
A 
is 
also 
predicable 
of 
B, 
since 
that 
which 
does 
not 
twinkle 
is 
near—we 
must 
take 
this 
truth 
as 
having 
been 
reached 
by 
induction 
or 
sense-perception. 
Therefore 
A 
is 
a 
necessary 
predicate 
of 
C; 
so 
that 
we 
have 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
planets 
are 
near. 
This 
syllogism, 
then, 
proves 
not 
the 
reasoned 
fact 
but 
only 
the 
fact; 
since 
they 
are 
not 
near 
because 
they 
do 
not 
twinkle, 
but, 
because 
they 
are 
near, 
do 
not 
twinkle. 
The 
major 
and 
middle 
of 
the 
proof, 
however, 
may 
be 
reversed, 
and 
then 
the 
demonstration 
will 
be 
of 
the 
reasoned 
fact. 
Thus: 
let 
C 
be 
the 
planets, 
B 
proximity, 
A 
not 
twinkling. 
Then 
B 
is 
an 
attribute 
of 
C, 
and 
A-not 
twinkling-of 
B. 
Consequently 
A 
is 
predicable 
of 
C, 
and 
the 
syllogism 
proves 
the 
reasoned 
fact, 
since 
its 
middle 
term 
is 
the 
proximate 
cause. 
Another 
example 
is 
the 
inference 
that 
the 
moon 
is 
spherical 
from 
its 
manner 
of 
waxing. 
Thus: 
since 
that 
which 
so 
waxes 
is 
spherical, 
and 
since 
the 
moon 
so 
waxes, 
clearly 
the 
moon 
is 
spherical. 
Put 
in 
this 
form, 
the 
syllogism 
turns 
out 
to 
be 
proof 
of 
the 
fact, 
but 
if 
the 
middle 
and 
major 
be 
reversed 
it 
is 
proof 
of 
the 
reasoned 
fact; 
since 
the 
moon 
is 
not 
spherical 
because 
it 
waxes 
in 
a 
certain 
manner, 
but 
waxes 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
because 
it 
is 
spherical. 
(Let 
C 
be 
the 
moon, 
B 
spherical, 
and 
A 
waxing.) 
Again 
(b), 
in 
cases 
where 
the 
cause 
and 
the 
effect 
are 
not 
reciprocal 
and 
the 
effect 
is 
the 
better 
known, 
the 
fact 
is 
demonstrated 
but 
not 
the 
reasoned 
fact. 
This 
also 
occurs 
(1) 
when 
the 
middle 
falls 
outside 
the 
major 
and 
minor, 
for 
here 
too 
the 
strict 
cause 
is 
not 
given, 
and 
so 
the 
demonstration 
is 
of 
the 
fact, 
not 
of 
the 
reasoned 
fact. 
For 
example, 
the 
question 
‘Why 
does 
not 
a 
wall 
breathe?’ 
might 
be 
answered, 
‘Because 
it 
is 
not 
an 
animal’; 
but 
that 
answer 
would 
not 
give 
the 
strict 
cause, 
because 
if 
not 
being 
an 
animal 
causes 
the 
absence 
of 
respiration, 
then 
being 
an 
animal 
should 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
respiration, 
according 
to 
the 
rule 
that 
if 
the 
negation 
of 
causes 
the 
non-inherence 
of 
y, 
the 
affirmation 
of 
x 
causes 
the 
inherence 
of 
y; 


e.g. 
if 
the 
disproportion 
of 
the 
hot 
and 
cold 
elements 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
ill 
health, 
their 
proportion 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
health; 
and 
conversely, 
if 
the 
assertion 
of 
x 
causes 
the 
inherence 
of 
y, 
the 
negation 
of 
x 
must 
cause 
y’s 
non-inherence. 
But 
in 
the 
case 
given 
this 
consequence 
does 
not 
result; 
for 
not 
every 
animal 
breathes. 
A 
syllogism 
with 
this 
kind 
of 
cause 
takes 
place 
in 
the 
second 
figure. 
Thus: 
let 
A 
be 
animal, 
B 
respiration, 
C 
wall. 
Then 
A 
is 
predicable 
of 
all 
B 
(for 
all 
that 
breathes 
is 
animal), 
but 
of 
no 
C; 
and 
consequently 
B 
is 
predicable 

of 
no 
C; 
that 
is, 
the 
wall 
does 
not 
breathe. 
Such 
causes 
are 
like 
far-fetched 
explanations, 
which 
precisely 
consist 
in 
making 
the 
cause 
too 
remote, 
as 
in 
Anacharsis’ 
account 
of 
why 
the 
Scythians 
have 
no 
flute-players; 
namely 
because 
they 
have 
no 
vines. 


Thus, 
then, 
do 
the 
syllogism 
of 
the 
fact 
and 
the 
syllogism 
of 
the 
reasoned 
fact 
differ 
within 
one 
science 
and 
according 
to 
the 
position 
of 
the 
middle 
terms. 
But 
there 
is 
another 
way 
too 
in 
which 
the 
fact 
and 
the 
reasoned 
fact 
differ, 
and 
that 
is 
when 
they 
are 
investigated 
respectively 
by 
different 
sciences. 
This 
occurs 
in 
the 
case 
of 
problems 
related 
to 
one 
another 
as 
subordinate 
and 
superior, 
as 
when 
optical 
problems 
are 
subordinated 
to 
geometry, 
mechanical 
problems 
to 
stereometry, 
harmonic 
problems 
to 
arithmetic, 
the 
data 
of 
observation 
to 
astronomy. 
(Some 
of 
these 
sciences 
bear 
almost 
the 
same 
name; 
e.g. 
mathematical 
and 
nautical 
astronomy, 
mathematical 
and 
acoustical 
harmonics.) 
Here 
it 
is 
the 
business 
of 
the 
empirical 
observers 
to 
know 
the 
fact, 
of 
the 
mathematicians 
to 
know 
the 
reasoned 
fact; 
for 
the 
latter 
are 
in 
possession 
of 
the 
demonstrations 
giving 
the 
causes, 
and 
are 
often 
ignorant 
of 
the 
fact: 
just 
as 
we 
have 
often 
a 
clear 
insight 
into 
a 
universal, 
but 
through 
lack 
of 
observation 
are 
ignorant 
of 
some 
of 
its 
particular 
instances. 
These 
connexions 
have 
a 
perceptible 
existence 
though 
they 
are 
manifestations 
of 
forms. 
For 
the 
mathematical 
sciences 
concern 
forms: 
they 
do 
not 
demonstrate 
properties 
of 
a 
substratum, 
since, 
even 
though 
the 
geometrical 
subjects 
are 
predicable 
as 
properties 
of 
a 
perceptible 
substratum, 
it 
is 
not 
as 
thus 
predicable 
that 
the 
mathematician 
demonstrates 
properties 
of 
them. 
As 
optics 
is 
related 
to 
geometry, 
so 
another 
science 
is 
related 
to 
optics, 
namely 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
rainbow. 
Here 
knowledge 
of 
the 
fact 
is 
within 
the 
province 
of 
the 
natural 
philosopher, 
knowledge 
of 
the 
reasoned 
fact 
within 
that 
of 
the 
optician, 
either 
qua 
optician 
or 
qua 
mathematical 
optician. 
Many 
sciences 
not 
standing 
in 
this 
mutual 
relation 
enter 
into 
it 
at 
points; 
e.g. 
medicine 
and 
geometry: 
it 
is 
the 
physician’s 
business 
to 
know 
that 
circular 
wounds 
heal 
more 
slowly, 
the 
geometer’s 
to 
know 
the 
reason 
why. 


Of 
all 
the 
figures 
the 
most 
scientific 
is 
the 
first. 
Thus, 
it 
is 
the 
vehicle 
of 
the 
demonstrations 
of 
all 
the 
mathematical 
sciences, 
such 
as 
arithmetic, 
geometry, 
and 
optics, 
and 
practically 
all 
of 
all 
sciences 
that 
investigate 



causes: 
for 
the 
syllogism 
of 
the 
reasoned 
fact 
is 
either 
exclusively 
or 
generally 
speaking 
and 
in 
most 
cases 
in 
this 
figure-a 
second 
proof 
that 
this 
figure 
is 
the 
most 
scientific; 
for 
grasp 
of 
a 
reasoned 
conclusion 
is 
the 
primary 
condition 
of 
knowledge. 
Thirdly, 
the 
first 
is 
the 
only 
figure 
which 
enables 
us 
to 
pursue 
knowledge 
of 
the 
essence 
of 
a 
thing. 
In 
the 
second 
figure 
no 
affirmative 
conclusion 
is 
possible, 
and 
knowledge 
of 
a 
thing’s 
essence 
must 
be 
affirmative; 
while 
in 
the 
third 
figure 
the 
conclusion 
can 
be 
affirmative, 
but 
cannot 
be 
universal, 
and 
essence 
must 
have 
a 
universal 
character: 
e.g. 
man 
is 
not 
two-footed 
animal 
in 
any 
qualified 
sense, 
but 
universally. 
Finally, 
the 
first 
figure 
has 
no 
need 
of 
the 
others, 
while 
it 
is 
by 
means 
of 
the 
first 
that 
the 
other 
two 
figures 
are 
developed, 
and 
have 
their 
intervals 
closepacked 
until 
immediate 
premisses 
are 
reached. 


Clearly, 
therefore, 
the 
first 
figure 
is 
the 
primary 
condition 
of 
knowledge. 


Just 
as 
an 
attribute 
A 
may 
(as 
we 
saw) 
be 
atomically 
connected 
with 
a 
subject 
B, 
so 
its 
disconnexion 
may 
be 
atomic. 
I 
call 
‘atomic’ 
connexions 
or 
disconnexions 
which 
involve 
no 
intermediate 
term; 
since 
in 
that 
case 
the 
connexion 
or 
disconnexion 
will 
not 
be 
mediated 
by 
something 
other 
than 
the 
terms 
themselves. 
It 
follows 
that 
if 
either 
A 
or 
B, 
or 
both 
A 
and 
B, 
have 
a 
genus, 
their 
disconnexion 
cannot 
be 
primary. 
Thus: 
let 
C 
be 
the 
genus 
of 
A. 
Then, 
if 
C 
is 
not 
the 
genus 
of 
B-for 
A 
may 
well 
have 
a 
genus 
which 
is 
not 
the 
genus 
of 
B-there 
will 
be 
a 
syllogism 
proving 
A’s 
disconnexion 
from 
B 
thus: 


all 
A 
is 
C, 


no 
B 
is 
C, 


therefore 
no 
B 
is 
A. 


Or 
if 
it 
is 
B 
which 
has 
a 
genus 
D, 
we 
have 


all 
B 
is 
D, 


no 
D 
is 
A, 


therefore 
no 
B 
is 
A, 
by 
syllogism; 



and 
the 
proof 
will 
be 
similar 
if 
both 
A 
and 
B 
have 
a 
genus. 
That 
the 
genus 
of 
A 
need 
not 
be 
the 
genus 
of 
B 
and 
vice 
versa, 
is 
shown 
by 
the 
existence 
of 
mutually 
exclusive 
coordinate 
series 
of 
predication. 
If 
no 
term 
in 
the 
series 
ACD… 
is 
predicable 
of 
any 
term 
in 
the 
series 
BEF… 
,and 
if 
G-a 
term 
in 
the 
former 
series-is 
the 
genus 
of 
A, 
clearly 
G 
will 
not 
be 
the 
genus 
of 
B; 
since, 
if 
it 
were, 
the 
series 
would 
not 
be 
mutually 
exclusive. 
So 
also 
if 
B 
has 
a 
genus, 
it 
will 
not 
be 
the 
genus 
of 
A. 
If, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
neither 
A 
nor 
B 
has 
a 
genus 
and 
A 
does 
not 
inhere 
in 
B, 
this 
disconnexion 
must 
be 
atomic. 
If 
there 
be 
a 
middle 
term, 
one 
or 
other 
of 
them 
is 
bound 
to 
have 
a 
genus, 
for 
the 
syllogism 
will 
be 
either 
in 
the 
first 
or 
the 
second 
figure. 
If 
it 
is 
in 
the 
first, 
B 
will 
have 
a 
genus-for 
the 
premiss 
containing 
it 
must 
be 
affirmative: 
if 
in 
the 
second, 
either 
A 
or 
B 
indifferently, 
since 
syllogism 
is 
possible 
if 
either 
is 
contained 
in 
a 
negative 
premiss, 
but 
not 
if 
both 
premisses 
are 
negative. 


Hence 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
one 
thing 
may 
be 
atomically 
disconnected 
from 
another, 
and 
we 
have 
stated 
when 
and 
how 
this 
is 
possible. 


Ignorance-defined 
not 
as 
the 
negation 
of 
knowledge 
but 
as 
a 
positive 
state 
of 
mind-is 
error 
produced 
by 
inference. 


(1) 
Let 
us 
first 
consider 
propositions 
asserting 
a 
predicate’s 
immediate 
connexion 
with 
or 
disconnexion 
from 
a 
subject. 
Here, 
it 
is 
true, 
positive 
error 
may 
befall 
one 
in 
alternative 
ways; 
for 
it 
may 
arise 
where 
one 
directly 
believes 
a 
connexion 
or 
disconnexion 
as 
well 
as 
where 
one’s 
belief 
is 
acquired 
by 
inference. 
The 
error, 
however, 
that 
consists 
in 
a 
direct 
belief 
is 
without 
complication; 
but 
the 
error 
resulting 
from 
inference-which 
here 
concerns 
us-takes 
many 
forms. 
Thus, 
let 
A 
be 
atomically 
disconnected 
from 
all 
B: 
then 
the 
conclusion 
inferred 
through 
a 
middle 
term 
C, 
that 
all 
B 
is 
A, 
will 
be 
a 
case 
of 
error 
produced 
by 
syllogism. 
Now, 
two 
cases 
are 
possible. 
Either 
(a) 
both 
premisses, 
or 
(b) 
one 
premiss 
only, 
may 
be 
false. 
(a) 
If 
neither 
A 
is 
an 
attribute 
of 
any 
C 
nor 
C 
of 
any 
B, 
whereas 
the 
contrary 
was 
posited 
in 
both 
cases, 
both 
premisses 
will 
be 
false. 
(C 
may 
quite 
well 
be 
so 
related 
to 
A 
and 
B 
that 
C 
is 
neither 
subordinate 
to 
A 
nor 
a 
universal 
attribute 
of 
B: 
for 
B, 
since 
A 
was 
said 
to 
be 
primarily 
disconnected 
from 
B, 
cannot 
have 
a 
genus, 
and 
A 
need 
not 
necessarily 
be 
a 
universal 
attribute 
of 
all 
things. 
Consequently 
both 
premisses 
may 
be 
false.) 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
(b) 
one 
of 
the 
premisses 
may 
be 
true, 
though 
not 
either 
indifferently 
but 
only 
the 
major 
A-C 
since, 
B 

having 
no 
genus, 
the 
premiss 
C-B 
will 
always 
be 
false, 
while 
A-C 
may 
be 
true. 
This 
is 
the 
case 
if, 
for 
example, 
A 
is 
related 
atomically 
to 
both 
C 
and 
B; 
because 
when 
the 
same 
term 
is 
related 
atomically 
to 
more 
terms 
than 
one, 
neither 
of 
those 
terms 
will 
belong 
to 
the 
other. 
It 
is, 
of 
course, 
equally 
the 
case 
if 
A-C 
is 
not 
atomic. 


Error 
of 
attribution, 
then, 
occurs 
through 
these 
causes 
and 
in 
this 
form 
only-for 
we 
found 
that 
no 
syllogism 
of 
universal 
attribution 
was 
possible 
in 
any 
figure 
but 
the 
first. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
an 
error 
of 
non-attribution 
may 
occur 
either 
in 
the 
first 
or 
in 
the 
second 
figure. 
Let 
us 
therefore 
first 
explain 
the 
various 
forms 
it 
takes 
in 
the 
first 
figure 
and 
the 
character 
of 
the 
premisses 
in 
each 
case. 


(c) 
It 
may 
occur 
when 
both 
premisses 
are 
false; 
e.g. 
supposing 
A 
atomically 
connected 
with 
both 
C 
and 
B, 
if 
it 
be 
then 
assumed 
that 
no 
C 
is 
and 
all 
B 
is 
C, 
both 
premisses 
are 
false. 
(d) 
It 
is 
also 
possible 
when 
one 
is 
false. 
This 
may 
be 
either 
premiss 
indifferently. 
A-C 
may 
be 
true, 
C-B 
false-A-C 
true 
because 
A 
is 
not 
an 
attribute 
of 
all 
things, 
C-B 
false 
because 
C, 
which 
never 
has 
the 
attribute 
A, 
cannot 
be 
an 
attribute 
of 
B; 
for 
if 
C-B 
were 
true, 
the 
premiss 
A-C 
would 
no 
longer 
be 
true, 
and 
besides 
if 
both 
premisses 
were 
true, 
the 
conclusion 
would 
be 
true. 
Or 
again, 
C-B 
may 
be 
true 
and 
A-C 
false; 
e.g. 
if 
both 
C 
and 
A 
contain 
B 
as 
genera, 
one 
of 
them 
must 
be 
subordinate 
to 
the 
other, 
so 
that 
if 
the 
premiss 
takes 
the 
form 
No 
C 
is 
A, 
it 
will 
be 
false. 
This 
makes 
it 
clear 
that 
whether 
either 
or 
both 
premisses 
are 
false, 
the 
conclusion 
will 
equally 
be 
false. 
In 
the 
second 
figure 
the 
premisses 
cannot 
both 
be 
wholly 
false; 
for 
if 
all 
B 
is 
A, 
no 
middle 
term 
can 
be 
with 
truth 
universally 
affirmed 
of 
one 
extreme 
and 
universally 
denied 
of 
the 
other: 
but 
premisses 
in 
which 
the 
middle 
is 
affirmed 
of 
one 
extreme 
and 
denied 
of 
the 
other 
are 
the 
necessary 
condition 
if 
one 
is 
to 
get 
a 
valid 
inference 
at 
all. 
Therefore 
if, 
taken 
in 
this 
way, 
they 
are 
wholly 
false, 
their 
contraries 
conversely 
should 
be 
wholly 
true. 
But 
this 
is 
impossible. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
there 
is 
nothing 
to 
prevent 
both 
premisses 
being 
partially 
false; 
e.g. 
if 
actually 
some 
A 
is 
C 
and 
some 
B 
is 
C, 
then 
if 
it 
is 
premised 
that 
all 
A 
is 
C 
and 
no 
B 
is 
C, 
both 
premisses 
are 
false, 
yet 
partially, 
not 
wholly, 
false. 
The 
same 
is 
true 
if 
the 
major 
is 
made 
negative 
instead 
of 
the 
minor. 
Or 
one 
premiss 
may 
be 
wholly 
false, 
and 
it 
may 
be 
either 
of 
them. 
Thus, 
supposing 
that 
actually 
an 
attribute 
of 
all 
A 
must 
also 
be 
an 
attribute 
of 
all 
B, 
then 
if 
C 
is 
yet 
taken 
to 
be 
a 
universal 
attribute 
of 
all 
but 
universally 



non-attributable 
to 
B, 
C-A 
will 
be 
true 
but 
C-B 
false. 
Again, 
actually 
that 
which 
is 
an 
attribute 
of 
no 
B 
will 
not 
be 
an 
attribute 
of 
all 
A 
either; 
for 
if 
it 
be 
an 
attribute 
of 
all 
A, 
it 
will 
also 
be 
an 
attribute 
of 
all 
B, 
which 
is 
contrary 
to 
supposition; 
but 
if 
C 
be 
nevertheless 
assumed 
to 
be 
a 
universal 
attribute 
of 
A, 
but 
an 
attribute 
of 
no 
B, 
then 
the 
premiss 
C-B 
is 
true 
but 
the 
major 
is 
false. 
The 
case 
is 
similar 
if 
the 
major 
is 
made 
the 
negative 
premiss. 
For 
in 
fact 
what 
is 
an 
attribute 
of 
no 
A 
will 
not 
be 
an 
attribute 
of 
any 
B 
either; 
and 
if 
it 
be 
yet 
assumed 
that 
C 
is 
universally 
non-attributable 
to 
A, 
but 
a 
universal 
attribute 
of 
B, 
the 
premiss 
C-A 
is 
true 
but 
the 
minor 
wholly 
false. 
Again, 
in 
fact 
it 
is 
false 
to 
assume 
that 
that 
which 
is 
an 
attribute 
of 
all 
B 
is 
an 
attribute 
of 
no 
A, 
for 
if 
it 
be 
an 
attribute 
of 
all 
B, 
it 
must 
be 
an 
attribute 
of 
some 
A. 
If 
then 
C 
is 
nevertheless 
assumed 
to 
be 
an 
attribute 
of 
all 
B 
but 
of 
no 
A, 
C-B 
will 
be 
true 
but 
C-A 
false. 


It 
is 
thus 
clear 
that 
in 
the 
case 
of 
atomic 
propositions 
erroneous 
inference 
will 
be 
possible 
not 
only 
when 
both 
premisses 
are 
false 
but 
also 
when 
only 
one 
is 
false. 


In 
the 
case 
of 
attributes 
not 
atomically 
connected 
with 
or 
disconnected 
from 
their 
subjects, 
(a) 
(i) 
as 
long 
as 
the 
false 
conclusion 
is 
inferred 
through 
the 
‘appropriate’ 
middle, 
only 
the 
major 
and 
not 
both 
premisses 
can 
be 
false. 
By 
‘appropriate 
middle’ 
I 
mean 
the 
middle 
term 
through 
which 
the 
contradictory-i.e. 
the 
true-conclusion 
is 
inferrible. 
Thus, 
let 
A 
be 
attributable 
to 
B 
through 
a 
middle 
term 
C: 
then, 
since 
to 
produce 
a 
conclusion 
the 
premiss 
C-B 
must 
be 
taken 
affirmatively, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
this 
premiss 
must 
always 
be 
true, 
for 
its 
quality 
is 
not 
changed. 
But 
the 
major 
A-C 
is 
false, 
for 
it 
is 
by 
a 
change 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
A-C 
that 
the 
conclusion 
becomes 
its 
contradictory-

i.e. 
true. 
Similarly 
(ii) 
if 
the 
middle 
is 
taken 
from 
another 
series 
of 
predication; 
e.g. 
suppose 
D 
to 
be 
not 
only 
contained 
within 
A 
as 
a 
part 
within 
its 
whole 
but 
also 
predicable 
of 
all 
B. 
Then 
the 
premiss 
D-B 
must 
remain 
unchanged, 
but 
the 
quality 
of 
A-D 
must 
be 
changed; 
so 
that 
D-B 
is 
always 
true, 
A-D 
always 
false. 
Such 
error 
is 
practically 
identical 
with 
that 
which 
is 
inferred 
through 
the 
‘appropriate’ 
middle. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
(b) 
if 
the 
conclusion 
is 
not 
inferred 
through 
the 
‘appropriate’ 
middle-(i) 
when 
the 
middle 
is 
subordinate 
to 
A 
but 
is 
predicable 
of 
no 
B, 
both 
premisses 
must 
be 
false, 
because 
if 
there 
is 
to 
be 
a 
conclusion 
both 
must 
be 
posited 
as 
asserting 

the 
contrary 
of 
what 
is 
actually 
the 
fact, 
and 
so 
posited 
both 
become 
false: 


e.g. 
suppose 
that 
actually 
all 
D 
is 
A 
but 
no 
B 
is 
D; 
then 
if 
these 
premisses 
are 
changed 
in 
quality, 
a 
conclusion 
will 
follow 
and 
both 
of 
the 
new 
premisses 
will 
be 
false. 
When, 
however, 
(ii) 
the 
middle 
D 
is 
not 
subordinate 
to 
A, 
A-D 
will 
be 
true, 
D-B 
false-A-D 
true 
because 
A 
was 
not 
subordinate 
to 
D, 
D-B 
false 
because 
if 
it 
had 
been 
true, 
the 
conclusion 
too 
would 
have 
been 
true; 
but 
it 
is 
ex 
hypothesi 
false. 
When 
the 
erroneous 
inference 
is 
in 
the 
second 
figure, 
both 
premisses 
cannot 
be 
entirely 
false; 
since 
if 
B 
is 
subordinate 
to 
A, 
there 
can 
be 
no 
middle 
predicable 
of 
all 
of 
one 
extreme 
and 
of 
none 
of 
the 
other, 
as 
was 
stated 
before. 
One 
premiss, 
however, 
may 
be 
false, 
and 
it 
may 
be 
either 
of 
them. 
Thus, 
if 
C 
is 
actually 
an 
attribute 
of 
both 
A 
and 
B, 
but 
is 
assumed 
to 
be 
an 
attribute 
of 
A 
only 
and 
not 
of 
B, 
C-A 
will 
be 
true, 
C-B 
false: 
or 
again 
if 
C 
be 
assumed 
to 
be 
attributable 
to 
B 
but 
to 
no 
A, 
C-B 
will 
be 
true, 
C-A 
false. 


We 
have 
stated 
when 
and 
through 
what 
kinds 
of 
premisses 
error 
will 
result 
in 
cases 
where 
the 
erroneous 
conclusion 
is 
negative. 
If 
the 
conclusion 
is 
affirmative, 
(a) 
(i) 
it 
may 
be 
inferred 
through 
the 
‘appropriate’ 
middle 
term. 
In 
this 
case 
both 
premisses 
cannot 
be 
false 
since, 
as 
we 
said 
before, 
C-B 
must 
remain 
unchanged 
if 
there 
is 
to 
be 
a 
conclusion, 
and 
consequently 
A-C, 
the 
quality 
of 
which 
is 
changed, 
will 
always 
be 
false. 
This 
is 
equally 
true 
if 
(ii) 
the 
middle 
is 
taken 
from 
another 
series 
of 
predication, 
as 
was 
stated 
to 
be 
the 
case 
also 
with 
regard 
to 
negative 
error; 
for 
D-B 
must 
remain 
unchanged, 
while 
the 
quality 
of 
A-D 
must 
be 
converted, 
and 
the 
type 
of 
error 
is 
the 
same 
as 
before. 


(b) 
The 
middle 
may 
be 
inappropriate. 
Then 
(i) 
if 
D 
is 
subordinate 
to 
A, 
AD 
will 
be 
true, 
but 
D-B 
false; 
since 
A 
may 
quite 
well 
be 
predicable 
of 
several 
terms 
no 
one 
of 
which 
can 
be 
subordinated 
to 
another. 
If, 
however, 
(ii) 
D 
is 
not 
subordinate 
to 
A, 
obviously 
A-D, 
since 
it 
is 
affirmed, 
will 
always 
be 
false, 
while 
D-B 
may 
be 
either 
true 
or 
false; 
for 
A 
may 
very 
well 
be 
an 
attribute 
of 
no 
D, 
whereas 
all 
B 
is 
D, 
e.g. 
no 
science 
is 
animal, 
all 
music 
is 
science. 
Equally 
well 
A 
may 
be 
an 
attribute 
of 
no 
D, 
and 
D 
of 
no 
B. 
It 
emerges, 
then, 
that 
if 
the 
middle 
term 
is 
not 
subordinate 
to 
the 
major, 
not 
only 
both 
premisses 
but 
either 
singly 
may 
be 
false. 
Thus 
we 
have 
made 
it 
clear 
how 
many 
varieties 
of 
erroneous 
inference 
are 
liable 
to 
happen 
and 
through 
what 
kinds 
of 
premisses 
they 
occur, 
in 
the 
case 
both 
of 
immediate 
and 
of 
demonstrable 
truths. 



It 
is 
also 
clear 
that 
the 
loss 
of 
any 
one 
of 
the 
senses 
entails 
the 
loss 
of 
a 
corresponding 
portion 
of 
knowledge, 
and 
that, 
since 
we 
learn 
either 
by 
induction 
or 
by 
demonstration, 
this 
knowledge 
cannot 
be 
acquired. 
Thus 
demonstration 
develops 
from 
universals, 
induction 
from 
particulars; 
but 
since 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
familiarize 
the 
pupil 
with 
even 
the 
so-called 
mathematical 
abstractions 
only 
through 
induction-i.e. 
only 
because 
each 
subject 
genus 
possesses, 
in 
virtue 
of 
a 
determinate 
mathematical 
character, 
certain 
properties 
which 
can 
be 
treated 
as 
separate 
even 
though 
they 
do 
not 
exist 
in 
isolation-it 
is 
consequently 
impossible 
to 
come 
to 
grasp 
universals 
except 
through 
induction. 
But 
induction 
is 
impossible 
for 
those 
who 
have 
not 
sense-
perception. 
For 
it 
is 
sense-perception 
alone 
which 
is 
adequate 
for 
grasping 
the 
particulars: 
they 
cannot 
be 
objects 
of 
scientific 
knowledge, 
because 
neither 
can 
universals 
give 
us 
knowledge 
of 
them 
without 
induction, 
nor 
can 
we 
get 
it 
through 
induction 
without 
sense-perception. 


Every 
syllogism 
is 
effected 
by 
means 
of 
three 
terms. 
One 
kind 
of 
syllogism 
serves 
to 
prove 
that 
A 
inheres 
in 
C 
by 
showing 
that 
A 
inheres 
in 
B 
and 
B 
in 
C; 
the 
other 
is 
negative 
and 
one 
of 
its 
premisses 
asserts 
one 
term 
of 
another, 
while 
the 
other 
denies 
one 
term 
of 
another. 
It 
is 
clear, 
then, 
that 
these 
are 
the 
fundamentals 
and 
so-called 
hypotheses 
of 
syllogism. 
Assume 
them 
as 
they 
have 
been 
stated, 
and 
proof 
is 
bound 
to 
follow-proof 
that 
A 
inheres 
in 
C 
through 
B, 
and 
again 
that 
A 
inheres 
in 
B 
through 
some 
other 
middle 
term, 
and 
similarly 
that 
B 
inheres 
in 
C. 
If 
our 
reasoning 
aims 
at 
gaining 
credence 
and 
so 
is 
merely 
dialectical, 
it 
is 
obvious 
that 
we 
have 
only 
to 
see 
that 
our 
inference 
is 
based 
on 
premisses 
as 
credible 
as 
possible: 
so 
that 
if 
a 
middle 
term 
between 
A 
and 
B 
is 
credible 
though 
not 
real, 
one 
can 
reason 
through 
it 
and 
complete 
a 
dialectical 
syllogism. 
If, 
however, 
one 
is 
aiming 
at 
truth, 
one 
must 
be 
guided 
by 
the 
real 
connexions 
of 
subjects 
and 
attributes. 
Thus: 
since 
there 
are 
attributes 
which 
are 
predicated 
of 
a 
subject 
essentially 
or 
naturally 
and 
not 
coincidentally-not, 
that 
is, 
in 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
we 
say 
‘That 
white 
(thing) 
is 
a 
man’, 
which 
is 
not 
the 
same 
mode 
of 
predication 
as 
when 
we 
say 
‘The 
man 
is 
white’: 
the 
man 
is 
white 
not 
because 
he 
is 
something 
else 
but 
because 
he 
is 
man, 
but 
the 
white 
is 
man 
because 
‘being 
white’ 
coincides 
with 



‘humanity’ 
within 
one 
substratum-therefore 
there 
are 
terms 
such 
as 
are 
naturally 
subjects 
of 
predicates. 
Suppose, 
then, 
C 
such 
a 
term 
not 
itself 
attributable 
to 
anything 
else 
as 
to 
a 
subject, 
but 
the 
proximate 
subject 
of 
the 
attribute 
B—i.e. 
so 
that 
B-C 
is 
immediate; 
suppose 
further 
E 
related 
immediately 
to 
F, 
and 
F 
to 
B. 
The 
first 
question 
is, 
must 
this 
series 
terminate, 
or 
can 
it 
proceed 
to 
infinity? 
The 
second 
question 
is 
as 
follows: 
Suppose 
nothing 
is 
essentially 
predicated 
of 
A, 
but 
A 
is 
predicated 
primarily 
of 
H 
and 
of 
no 
intermediate 
prior 
term, 
and 
suppose 
H 
similarly 
related 
to 
G 
and 
G 
to 
B; 
then 
must 
this 
series 
also 
terminate, 
or 
can 
it 
too 
proceed 
to 
infinity? 
There 
is 
this 
much 
difference 
between 
the 
questions: 
the 
first 
is, 
is 
it 
possible 
to 
start 
from 
that 
which 
is 
not 
itself 
attributable 
to 
anything 
else 
but 
is 
the 
subject 
of 
attributes, 
and 
ascend 
to 
infinity? 
The 
second 
is 
the 
problem 
whether 
one 
can 
start 
from 
that 
which 
is 
a 
predicate 
but 
not 
itself 
a 
subject 
of 
predicates, 
and 
descend 
to 
infinity? 
A 
third 
question 
is, 
if 
the 
extreme 
terms 
are 
fixed, 
can 
there 
be 
an 
infinity 
of 
middles? 
I 
mean 
this: 
suppose 
for 
example 
that 
A 
inheres 
in 
C 
and 
B 
is 
intermediate 
between 
them, 
but 
between 
B 
and 
A 
there 
are 
other 
middles, 
and 
between 
these 
again 
fresh 
middles; 
can 
these 
proceed 
to 
infinity 
or 
can 
they 
not? 
This 
is 
the 
equivalent 
of 
inquiring, 
do 
demonstrations 
proceed 
to 
infinity, 
i.e. 
is 
everything 
demonstrable? 
Or 
do 
ultimate 
subject 
and 
primary 
attribute 
limit 
one 
another? 


I 
hold 
that 
the 
same 
questions 
arise 
with 
regard 
to 
negative 
conclusions 
and 
premisses: 
viz. 
if 
A 
is 
attributable 
to 
no 
B, 
then 
either 
this 
predication 
will 
be 
primary, 
or 
there 
will 
be 
an 
intermediate 
term 
prior 
to 
B 
to 
which 
a 
is 
not 
attributable-G, 
let 
us 
say, 
which 
is 
attributable 
to 
all 
B-and 
there 
may 
still 
be 
another 
term 
H 
prior 
to 
G, 
which 
is 
attributable 
to 
all 
G. 
The 
same 
questions 
arise, 
I 
say, 
because 
in 
these 
cases 
too 
either 
the 
series 
of 
prior 
terms 
to 
which 
a 
is 
not 
attributable 
is 
infinite 
or 
it 
terminates. 


One 
cannot 
ask 
the 
same 
questions 
in 
the 
case 
of 
reciprocating 
terms, 
since 
when 
subject 
and 
predicate 
are 
convertible 
there 
is 
neither 
primary 
nor 
ultimate 
subject, 
seeing 
that 
all 
the 
reciprocals 
qua 
subjects 
stand 
in 
the 
same 
relation 
to 
one 
another, 
whether 
we 
say 
that 
the 
subject 
has 
an 
infinity 
of 
attributes 
or 
that 
both 
subjects 
and 
attributes-and 
we 
raised 
the 
question 
in 
both 
cases-are 
infinite 
in 
number. 
These 
questions 
then 
cannot 
be 
asked-
unless, 
indeed, 
the 
terms 
can 
reciprocate 
by 
two 
different 
modes, 
by 
accidental 
predication 
in 
one 
relation 
and 
natural 
predication 
in 
the 
other. 



Now, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
if 
the 
predications 
terminate 
in 
both 
the 
upward 
and 
the 
downward 
direction 
(by 
‘upward’ 
I 
mean 
the 
ascent 
to 
the 
more 
universal, 
by 
‘downward’ 
the 
descent 
to 
the 
more 
particular), 
the 
middle 
terms 
cannot 
be 
infinite 
in 
number. 
For 
suppose 
that 
A 
is 
predicated 
of 
F, 
and 
that 
the 
intermediates-call 
them 
BB’B”… 
-are 
infinite, 
then 
clearly 
you 
might 
descend 
from 
and 
find 
one 
term 
predicated 
of 
another 
ad 
infinitum, 
since 
you 
have 
an 
infinity 
of 
terms 
between 
you 
and 
F; 
and 
equally, 
if 
you 
ascend 
from 
F, 
there 
are 
infinite 
terms 
between 
you 
and 
A. 
It 
follows 
that 
if 
these 
processes 
are 
impossible 
there 
cannot 
be 
an 
infinity 
of 
intermediates 
between 
A 
and 
F. 
Nor 
is 
it 
of 
any 
effect 
to 
urge 
that 
some 
terms 
of 
the 
series 
AB… 
F 
are 
contiguous 
so 
as 
to 
exclude 
intermediates, 
while 
others 
cannot 
be 
taken 
into 
the 
argument 
at 
all: 
whichever 
terms 
of 
the 
series 
B… 
I 
take, 
the 
number 
of 
intermediates 
in 
the 
direction 
either 
of 
A 
or 
of 
F 
must 
be 
finite 
or 
infinite: 
where 
the 
infinite 
series 
starts, 
whether 
from 
the 
first 
term 
or 
from 
a 
later 
one, 
is 
of 
no 
moment, 
for 
the 
succeeding 
terms 
in 
any 
case 
are 
infinite 
in 
number. 


Further, 
if 
in 
affirmative 
demonstration 
the 
series 
terminates 
in 
both 
directions, 
clearly 
it 
will 
terminate 
too 
in 
negative 
demonstration. 
Let 
us 
assume 
that 
we 
cannot 
proceed 
to 
infinity 
either 
by 
ascending 
from 
the 
ultimate 
term 
(by 
‘ultimate 
term’ 
I 
mean 
a 
term 
such 
as 
was, 
not 
itself 
attributable 
to 
a 
subject 
but 
itself 
the 
subject 
of 
attributes), 
or 
by 
descending 
towards 
an 
ultimate 
from 
the 
primary 
term 
(by 
‘primary 
term’ 
I 
mean 
a 
term 
predicable 
of 
a 
subject 
but 
not 
itself 
a 
subject). 
If 
this 
assumption 
is 
justified, 
the 
series 
will 
also 
terminate 
in 
the 
case 
of 
negation. 
For 
a 
negative 
conclusion 
can 
be 
proved 
in 
all 
three 
figures. 
In 
the 
first 
figure 
it 
is 
proved 
thus: 
no 
B 
is 
A, 
all 
C 
is 
B. 
In 
packing 
the 
interval 
B-C 
we 
must 
reach 
immediate 
propositions—as 
is 
always 
the 
case 
with 
the 
minor 
premiss—since 
B-C 
is 
affirmative. 
As 
regards 
the 
other 
premiss 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
if 
the 
major 
term 
is 
denied 
of 
a 
term 
D 
prior 
to 
B, 
D 
will 
have 
to 
be 
predicable 
of 
all 
B, 
and 
if 
the 
major 
is 
denied 
of 
yet 
another 
term 
prior 
to 
D, 
this 
term 
must 
be 
predicable 
of 
all 
D. 
Consequently, 
since 
the 
ascending 
series 
is 
finite, 
the 
descent 
will 
also 
terminate 
and 
there 
will 
be 
a 
subject 
of 
which 
A 
is 
primarily 
non-predicable. 
In 
the 
second 
figure 
the 
syllogism 
is, 
all 
A 
is 
B, 
no 
C 
is 
B,..no 
C 
is 
A. 
If 
proof 
of 
this 
is 
required, 
plainly 
it 
may 
be 
shown 
either 
in 
the 
first 
figure 
as 
above, 
in 
the 
second 
as 
here, 
or 
in 
the 
third. 
The 
first 
figure 



has 
been 
discussed, 
and 
we 
will 
proceed 
to 
display 
the 
second, 
proof 
by 
which 
will 
be 
as 
follows: 
all 
B 
is 
D, 
no 
C 
is 
D… 
, 
since 
it 
is 
required 
that 
B 
should 
be 
a 
subject 
of 
which 
a 
predicate 
is 
affirmed. 
Next, 
since 
D 
is 
to 
be 
proved 
not 
to 
belong 
to 
C, 
then 
D 
has 
a 
further 
predicate 
which 
is 
denied 
of 


C. 
Therefore, 
since 
the 
succession 
of 
predicates 
affirmed 
of 
an 
ever 
higher 
universal 
terminates, 
the 
succession 
of 
predicates 
denied 
terminates 
too. 
The 
third 
figure 
shows 
it 
as 
follows: 
all 
B 
is 
A, 
some 
B 
is 
not 
C. 
Therefore 
some 
A 
is 
not 
C. 
This 
premiss, 
i.e. 
C-B, 
will 
be 
proved 
either 
in 
the 
same 
figure 
or 
in 
one 
of 
the 
two 
figures 
discussed 
above. 
In 
the 
first 
and 
second 
figures 
the 
series 
terminates. 
If 
we 
use 
the 
third 
figure, 
we 
shall 
take 
as 
premisses, 
all 
E 
is 
B, 
some 
E 
is 
not 
C, 
and 
this 
premiss 
again 
will 
be 
proved 
by 
a 
similar 
prosyllogism. 
But 
since 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
the 
series 
of 
descending 
subjects 
also 
terminates, 
plainly 
the 
series 
of 
more 
universal 
non-
predicables 
will 
terminate 
also. 
Even 
supposing 
that 
the 
proof 
is 
not 
confined 
to 
one 
method, 
but 
employs 
them 
all 
and 
is 
now 
in 
the 
first 
figure, 
now 
in 
the 
second 
or 
third-even 
so 
the 
regress 
will 
terminate, 
for 
the 
methods 
are 
finite 
in 
number, 
and 
if 
finite 
things 
are 
combined 
in 
a 
finite 
number 
of 
ways, 
the 
result 
must 
be 
finite. 


Thus 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
the 
regress 
of 
middles 
terminates 
in 
the 
case 
of 
negative 
demonstration, 
if 
it 
does 
so 
also 
in 
the 
case 
of 
affirmative 
demonstration. 
That 
in 
fact 
the 
regress 
terminates 
in 
both 
these 
cases 
may 
be 
made 
clear 
by 
the 
following 
dialectical 
considerations. 


In 
the 
case 
of 
predicates 
constituting 
the 
essential 
nature 
of 
a 
thing, 
it 
clearly 
terminates, 
seeing 
that 
if 
definition 
is 
possible, 
or 
in 
other 
words, 
if 
essential 
form 
is 
knowable, 
and 
an 
infinite 
series 
cannot 
be 
traversed, 
predicates 
constituting 
a 
thing’s 
essential 
nature 
must 
be 
finite 
in 
number. 
But 
as 
regards 
predicates 
generally 
we 
have 
the 
following 
prefatory 
remarks 
to 
make. 
(1) 
We 
can 
affirm 
without 
falsehood 
‘the 
white 
(thing) 
is 
walking’, 
and 
that 
big 
(thing) 
is 
a 
log’; 
or 
again, 
‘the 
log 
is 
big’, 
and 
‘the 
man 
walks’. 
But 
the 
affirmation 
differs 
in 
the 
two 
cases. 
When 
I 
affirm 
‘the 
white 
is 
a 
log’, 
I 
mean 
that 
something 
which 
happens 
to 
be 
white 
is 
a 
log-not 
that 
white 
is 
the 
substratum 
in 
which 
log 
inheres, 
for 
it 
was 
not 
qua 
white 
or 
qua 
a 
species 
of 
white 
that 
the 
white 
(thing) 
came 
to 
be 
a 
log, 
and 
the 
white 
(thing) 
is 
consequently 
not 
a 
log 
except 
incidentally. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
when 
I 



affirm 
‘the 
log 
is 
white’, 
I 
do 
not 
mean 
that 
something 
else, 
which 
happens 
also 
to 
be 
a 
log, 
is 
white 
(as 
I 
should 
if 
I 
said 
‘the 
musician 
is 
white,’ 
which 
would 
mean 
‘the 
man 
who 
happens 
also 
to 
be 
a 
musician 
is 
white’); 
on 
the 
contrary, 
log 
is 
here 
the 
substratum-the 
substratum 
which 
actually 
came 
to 
be 
white, 
and 
did 
so 
qua 
wood 
or 
qua 
a 
species 
of 
wood 
and 
qua 
nothing 
else. 


If 
we 
must 
lay 
down 
a 
rule, 
let 
us 
entitle 
the 
latter 
kind 
of 
statement 
predication, 
and 
the 
former 
not 
predication 
at 
all, 
or 
not 
strict 
but 
accidental 
predication. 
‘White’ 
and 
‘log’ 
will 
thus 
serve 
as 
types 
respectively 
of 
predicate 
and 
subject. 


We 
shall 
assume, 
then, 
that 
the 
predicate 
is 
invariably 
predicated 
strictly 
and 
not 
accidentally 
of 
the 
subject, 
for 
on 
such 
predication 
demonstrations 
depend 
for 
their 
force. 
It 
follows 
from 
this 
that 
when 
a 
single 
attribute 
is 
predicated 
of 
a 
single 
subject, 
the 
predicate 
must 
affirm 
of 
the 
subject 
either 
some 
element 
constituting 
its 
essential 
nature, 
or 
that 
it 
is 
in 
some 
way 
qualified, 
quantified, 
essentially 
related, 
active, 
passive, 
placed, 
or 
dated. 


(2) 
Predicates 
which 
signify 
substance 
signify 
that 
the 
subject 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
predicate 
or 
with 
a 
species 
of 
the 
predicate. 
Predicates 
not 
signifying 
substance 
which 
are 
predicated 
of 
a 
subject 
not 
identical 
with 
themselves 
or 
with 
a 
species 
of 
themselves 
are 
accidental 
or 
coincidental; 
e.g. 
white 
is 
a 
coincident 
of 
man, 
seeing 
that 
man 
is 
not 
identical 
with 
white 
or 
a 
species 
of 
white, 
but 
rather 
with 
animal, 
since 
man 
is 
identical 
with 
a 
species 
of 
animal. 
These 
predicates 
which 
do 
not 
signify 
substance 
must 
be 
predicates 
of 
some 
other 
subject, 
and 
nothing 
can 
be 
white 
which 
is 
not 
also 
other 
than 
white. 
The 
Forms 
we 
can 
dispense 
with, 
for 
they 
are 
mere 
sound 
without 
sense; 
and 
even 
if 
there 
are 
such 
things, 
they 
are 
not 
relevant 
to 
our 
discussion, 
since 
demonstrations 
are 
concerned 
with 
predicates 
such 
as 
we 
have 
defined. 
(3) 
If 
A 
is 
a 
quality 
of 
B, 
B 
cannot 
be 
a 
quality 
of 
A-a 
quality 
of 
a 
quality. 
Therefore 
A 
and 
B 
cannot 
be 
predicated 
reciprocally 
of 
one 
another 
in 
strict 
predication: 
they 
can 
be 
affirmed 
without 
falsehood 
of 
one 
another, 
but 
not 
genuinely 
predicated 
of 
each 
other. 
For 
one 
alternative 
is 
that 
they 
should 
be 
substantially 
predicated 
of 
one 
another, 
i.e. 
B 
would 
become 
the 
genus 
or 
differentia 
of 
A-the 
predicate 
now 
become 
subject. 
But 
it 
has 
been 
shown 
that 
in 
these 
substantial 
predications 
neither 
the 
ascending 
predicates 
nor 
the 
descending 
subjects 
form 
an 
infinite 
series; 
e.g. 
neither 
the 
series, 
man 
is 
biped, 
biped 
is 
animal, 
&c., 
nor 
the 
series 
predicating 
animal 
of 
man, 
man 
of 
Callias, 
Callias 
of 
a 
further. 
subject 
as 
an 
element 
of 
its 
essential 
nature, 
is 
infinite. 
For 
all 
such 
substance 
is 
definable, 
and 
an 
infinite 
series 
cannot 
be 

traversed 
in 
thought: 
consequently 
neither 
the 
ascent 
nor 
the 
descent 
is 
infinite, 
since 
a 
substance 
whose 
predicates 
were 
infinite 
would 
not 
be 
definable. 
Hence 
they 
will 
not 
be 
predicated 
each 
as 
the 
genus 
of 
the 
other; 
for 
this 
would 
equate 
a 
genus 
with 
one 
of 
its 
own 
species. 
Nor 
(the 
other 
alternative) 
can 
a 
quale 
be 
reciprocally 
predicated 
of 
a 
quale, 
nor 
any 
term 
belonging 
to 
an 
adjectival 
category 
of 
another 
such 
term, 
except 
by 
accidental 
predication; 
for 
all 
such 
predicates 
are 
coincidents 
and 
are 
predicated 
of 
substances. 
On 
the 
other 
hand-in 
proof 
of 
the 
impossibility 
of 
an 
infinite 
ascending 
series-every 
predication 
displays 
the 
subject 
as 
somehow 
qualified 
or 
quantified 
or 
as 
characterized 
under 
one 
of 
the 
other 
adjectival 
categories, 
or 
else 
is 
an 
element 
in 
its 
substantial 
nature: 
these 
latter 
are 
limited 
in 
number, 
and 
the 
number 
of 
the 
widest 
kinds 
under 
which 
predications 
fall 
is 
also 
limited, 
for 
every 
predication 
must 
exhibit 
its 
subject 
as 
somehow 
qualified, 
quantified, 
essentially 
related, 
acting 
or 
suffering, 
or 
in 
some 
place 
or 
at 
some 
time. 


I 
assume 
first 
that 
predication 
implies 
a 
single 
subject 
and 
a 
single 
attribute, 
and 
secondly 
that 
predicates 
which 
are 
not 
substantial 
are 
not 
predicated 
of 
one 
another. 
We 
assume 
this 
because 
such 
predicates 
are 
all 
coincidents, 
and 
though 
some 
are 
essential 
coincidents, 
others 
of 
a 
different 
type, 
yet 
we 
maintain 
that 
all 
of 
them 
alike 
are 
predicated 
of 
some 
substratum 
and 
that 
a 
coincident 
is 
never 
a 
substratum-since 
we 
do 
not 
class 
as 
a 
coincident 
anything 
which 
does 
not 
owe 
its 
designation 
to 
its 
being 
something 
other 
than 
itself, 
but 
always 
hold 
that 
any 
coincident 
is 
predicated 
of 
some 
substratum 
other 
than 
itself, 
and 
that 
another 
group 
of 
coincidents 
may 
have 
a 
different 
substratum. 
Subject 
to 
these 
assumptions 
then, 
neither 
the 
ascending 
nor 
the 
descending 
series 
of 
predication 
in 
which 
a 
single 
attribute 
is 
predicated 
of 
a 
single 
subject 
is 
infinite. 
For 
the 
subjects 
of 
which 
coincidents 
are 
predicated 
are 
as 
many 
as 
the 
constitutive 
elements 
of 
each 
individual 
substance, 
and 
these 
we 
have 
seen 
are 
not 
infinite 
in 
number, 
while 
in 
the 
ascending 
series 
are 
contained 
those 
constitutive 
elements 
with 
their 
coincidents-both 
of 
which 
are 
finite. 
We 
conclude 
that 
there 
is 
a 
given 
subject 
(D) 
of 
which 
some 
attribute 
(C) 
is 
primarily 
predicable; 
that 
there 
must 
be 
an 
attribute 
(B) 
primarily 
predicable 
of 
the 
first 
attribute, 
and 
that 
the 
series 
must 
end 
with 
a 
term 
(A) 
not 
predicable 
of 
any 
term 
prior 
to 
the 
last 
subject 
of 
which 
it 
was 
predicated 
(B), 
and 
of 
which 
no 
term 
prior 
to 
it 
is 
predicable. 


The 
argument 
we 
have 
given 
is 
one 
of 
the 
so-called 
proofs; 
an 
alternative 



proof 
follows. 
Predicates 
so 
related 
to 
their 
subjects 
that 
there 
are 
other 
predicates 
prior 
to 
them 
predicable 
of 
those 
subjects 
are 
demonstrable; 
but 
of 
demonstrable 
propositions 
one 
cannot 
have 
something 
better 
than 
knowledge, 
nor 
can 
one 
know 
them 
without 
demonstration. 
Secondly, 
if 
a 
consequent 
is 
only 
known 
through 
an 
antecedent 
(viz. 
premisses 
prior 
to 
it) 
and 
we 
neither 
know 
this 
antecedent 
nor 
have 
something 
better 
than 
knowledge 
of 
it, 
then 
we 
shall 
not 
have 
scientific 
knowledge 
of 
the 
consequent. 
Therefore, 
if 
it 
is 
possible 
through 
demonstration 
to 
know 
anything 
without 
qualification 
and 
not 
merely 
as 
dependent 
on 
the 
acceptance 
of 
certain 
premisses-i.e. 
hypothetically-the 
series 
of 
intermediate 
predications 
must 
terminate. 
If 
it 
does 
not 
terminate, 
and 
beyond 
any 
predicate 
taken 
as 
higher 
than 
another 
there 
remains 
another 
still 
higher, 
then 
every 
predicate 
is 
demonstrable. 
Consequently, 
since 
these 
demonstrable 
predicates 
are 
infinite 
in 
number 
and 
therefore 
cannot 
be 
traversed, 
we 
shall 
not 
know 
them 
by 
demonstration. 
If, 
therefore, 
we 
have 
not 
something 
better 
than 
knowledge 
of 
them, 
we 
cannot 
through 
demonstration 
have 
unqualified 
but 
only 
hypothetical 
science 
of 
anything. 


As 
dialectical 
proofs 
of 
our 
contention 
these 
may 
carry 
conviction, 
but 
an 
analytic 
process 
will 
show 
more 
briefly 
that 
neither 
the 
ascent 
nor 
the 
descent 
of 
predication 
can 
be 
infinite 
in 
the 
demonstrative 
sciences 
which 
are 
the 
object 
of 
our 
investigation. 
Demonstration 
proves 
the 
inherence 
of 
essential 
attributes 
in 
things. 
Now 
attributes 
may 
be 
essential 
for 
two 
reasons: 
either 
because 
they 
are 
elements 
in 
the 
essential 
nature 
of 
their 
subjects, 
or 
because 
their 
subjects 
are 
elements 
in 
their 
essential 
nature. 
An 
example 
of 
the 
latter 
is 
odd 
as 
an 
attribute 
of 
number-though 
it 
is 
number’s 
attribute, 
yet 
number 
itself 
is 
an 
element 
in 
the 
definition 
of 
odd; 
of 
the 
former, 
multiplicity 
or 
the 
indivisible, 
which 
are 
elements 
in 
the 
definition 
of 
number. 
In 
neither 
kind 
of 
attribution 
can 
the 
terms 
be 
infinite. 
They 
are 
not 
infinite 
where 
each 
is 
related 
to 
the 
term 
below 
it 
as 
odd 
is 
to 
number, 
for 
this 
would 
mean 
the 
inherence 
in 
odd 
of 
another 
attribute 
of 
odd 
in 
whose 
nature 
odd 
was 
an 
essential 
element: 
but 
then 
number 
will 
be 
an 
ultimate 
subject 
of 
the 
whole 
infinite 
chain 
of 
attributes, 
and 
be 
an 
element 
in 
the 
definition 
of 
each 
of 
them. 
Hence, 
since 
an 
infinity 
of 
attributes 
such 
as 
contain 
their 
subject 
in 
their 
definition 
cannot 
inhere 
in 
a 
single 
thing, 
the 
ascending 
series 
is 
equally 
finite. 
Note, 
moreover, 
that 
all 
such 
attributes 
must 
so 
inhere 
in 
the 
ultimate 
subject-e.g. 
its 
attributes 
in 
number 
and 
number 
in 
them-as 
to 
be 
commensurate 
with 
the 
subject 
and 
not 
of 
wider 
extent. 
Attributes 
which 
are 



essential 
elements 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
their 
subjects 
are 
equally 
finite: 
otherwise 
definition 
would 
be 
impossible. 
Hence, 
if 
all 
the 
attributes 
predicated 
are 
essential 
and 
these 
cannot 
be 
infinite, 
the 
ascending 
series 
will 
terminate, 
and 
consequently 
the 
descending 
series 
too. 


If 
this 
is 
so, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
intermediates 
between 
any 
two 
terms 
are 
also 
always 
limited 
in 
number. 
An 
immediately 
obvious 
consequence 
of 
this 
is 
that 
demonstrations 
necessarily 
involve 
basic 
truths, 
and 
that 
the 
contention 
of 
some-referred 
to 
at 
the 
outset-that 
all 
truths 
are 
demonstrable 
is 
mistaken. 
For 
if 
there 
are 
basic 
truths, 
(a) 
not 
all 
truths 
are 
demonstrable, 
and 
(b) 
an 
infinite 
regress 
is 
impossible; 
since 
if 
either 
(a) 
or 
(b) 
were 
not 
a 
fact, 
it 
would 
mean 
that 
no 
interval 
was 
immediate 
and 
indivisible, 
but 
that 
all 
intervals 
were 
divisible. 
This 
is 
true 
because 
a 
conclusion 
is 
demonstrated 
by 
the 
interposition, 
not 
the 
apposition, 
of 
a 
fresh 
term. 
If 
such 
interposition 
could 
continue 
to 
infinity 
there 
might 
be 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
terms 
between 
any 
two 
terms; 
but 
this 
is 
impossible 
if 
both 
the 
ascending 
and 
descending 
series 
of 
predication 
terminate; 
and 
of 
this 
fact, 
which 
before 
was 
shown 
dialectically, 
analytic 
proof 
has 
now 
been 
given. 


It 
is 
an 
evident 
corollary 
of 
these 
conclusions 
that 
if 
the 
same 
attribute 
A 
inheres 
in 
two 
terms 
C 
and 
D 
predicable 
either 
not 
at 
all, 
or 
not 
of 
all 
instances, 
of 
one 
another, 
it 
does 
not 
always 
belong 
to 
them 
in 
virtue 
of 
a 
common 
middle 
term. 
Isosceles 
and 
scalene 
possess 
the 
attribute 
of 
having 
their 
angles 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles 
in 
virtue 
of 
a 
common 
middle; 
for 
they 
possess 
it 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
are 
both 
a 
certain 
kind 
of 
figure, 
and 
not 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
differ 
from 
one 
another. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
always 
the 
case: 
for, 
were 
it 
so, 
if 
we 
take 
B 
as 
the 
common 
middle 
in 
virtue 
of 
which 
A 
inheres 
in 
C 
and 
D, 
clearly 
B 
would 
inhere 
in 
C 
and 
D 
through 
a 
second 
common 
middle, 
and 
this 
in 
turn 
would 
inhere 
in 
C 
and 
D 
through 
a 
third, 
so 
that 
between 
two 
terms 
an 
infinity 
of 
intermediates 
would 
fall-an 
impossibility. 
Thus 
it 
need 
not 
always 
be 
in 
virtue 
of 
a 
common 
middle 
term 
that 
a 
single 
attribute 
inheres 
in 
several 
subjects, 
since 
there 
must 
be 
immediate 
intervals. 
Yet 
if 
the 
attribute 
to 
be 
proved 
common 
to 
two 
subjects 
is 
to 
be 
one 
of 
their 
essential 
attributes, 
the 
middle 
terms 
involved 
must 
be 
within 
one 
subject 
genus 
and 
be 
derived 
from 
the 
same 
group 
of 
immediate 
premisses; 
for 
we 
have 
seen 
that 
processes 
of 
proof 
cannot 
pass 
from 
one 
genus 
to 
another. 



It 
is 
also 
clear 
that 
when 
A 
inheres 
in 
B, 
this 
can 
be 
demonstrated 
if 
there 
is 
a 
middle 
term. 
Further, 
the 
‘elements’ 
of 
such 
a 
conclusion 
are 
the 
premisses 
containing 
the 
middle 
in 
question, 
and 
they 
are 
identical 
in 
number 
with 
the 
middle 
terms, 
seeing 
that 
the 
immediate 
propositions-or 
at 
least 
such 
immediate 
propositions 
as 
are 
universal-are 
the 
‘elements’. 
If, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
there 
is 
no 
middle 
term, 
demonstration 
ceases 
to 
be 
possible: 
we 
are 
on 
the 
way 
to 
the 
basic 
truths. 
Similarly 
if 
A 
does 
not 
inhere 
in 
B, 
this 
can 
be 
demonstrated 
if 
there 
is 
a 
middle 
term 
or 
a 
term 
prior 
to 
B 
in 
which 
A 
does 
not 
inhere: 
otherwise 
there 
is 
no 
demonstration 
and 
a 
basic 
truth 
is 
reached. 
There 
are, 
moreover, 
as 
many 
‘elements’ 
of 
the 
demonstrated 
conclusion 
as 
there 
are 
middle 
terms, 
since 
it 
is 
propositions 
containing 
these 
middle 
terms 
that 
are 
the 
basic 
premisses 
on 
which 
the 
demonstration 
rests; 
and 
as 
there 
are 
some 
indemonstrable 
basic 
truths 
asserting 
that 
‘this 
is 
that’ 
or 
that 
‘this 
inheres 
in 
that’, 
so 
there 
are 
others 
denying 
that 
‘this 
is 
that’ 
or 
that 
‘this 
inheres 
in 
that’-in 
fact 
some 
basic 
truths 
will 
affirm 
and 
some 
will 
deny 
being. 


When 
we 
are 
to 
prove 
a 
conclusion, 
we 
must 
take 
a 
primary 
essential 
predicate-suppose 
it 
C-of 
the 
subject 
B, 
and 
then 
suppose 
A 
similarly 
predicable 
of 
C. 
If 
we 
proceed 
in 
this 
manner, 
no 
proposition 
or 
attribute 
which 
falls 
beyond 
A 
is 
admitted 
in 
the 
proof: 
the 
interval 
is 
constantly 
condensed 
until 
subject 
and 
predicate 
become 
indivisible, 
i.e. 
one. 
We 
have 
our 
unit 
when 
the 
premiss 
becomes 
immediate, 
since 
the 
immediate 
premiss 
alone 
is 
a 
single 
premiss 
in 
the 
unqualified 
sense 
of 
‘single’. 
And 
as 
in 
other 
spheres 
the 
basic 
element 
is 
simple 
but 
not 
identical 
in 
all-in 
a 
system 
of 
weight 
it 
is 
the 
mina, 
in 
music 
the 
quarter-tone, 
and 
so 
on—so 
in 
syllogism 
the 
unit 
is 
an 
immediate 
premiss, 
and 
in 
the 
knowledge 
that 
demonstration 
gives 
it 
is 
an 
intuition. 
In 
syllogisms, 
then, 
which 
prove 
the 
inherence 
of 
an 
attribute, 
nothing 
falls 
outside 
the 
major 
term. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
negative 
syllogisms 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
(1) 
in 
the 
first 
figure 
nothing 
falls 
outside 
the 
major 
term 
whose 
inherence 
is 
in 
question; 
e.g. 
to 
prove 
through 
a 
middle 
C 
that 
A 
does 
not 
inhere 
in 
B 
the 
premisses 
required 
are, 
all 
B 
is 
C, 
no 
C 
is 
A. 
Then 
if 
it 
has 
to 
be 
proved 
that 
no 
C 
is 
A, 
a 
middle 
must 
be 
found 
between 
and 
C; 
and 
this 
procedure 
will 
never 
vary. 


(2) 
If 
we 
have 
to 
show 
that 
E 
is 
not 
D 
by 
means 
of 
the 
premisses, 
all 
D 
is 
C; 
no 
E, 
or 
not 
all 
E, 
is 
C; 
then 
the 
middle 
will 
never 
fall 
beyond 
E, 
and 
E 
is 
the 
subject 
of 
which 
D 
is 
to 
be 
denied 
in 
the 
conclusion. 
(3) 
In 
the 
third 
figure 
the 
middle 
will 
never 
fall 
beyond 
the 
limits 
of 
the 

subject 
and 
the 
attribute 
denied 
of 
it. 


Since 
demonstrations 
may 
be 
either 
commensurately 
universal 
or 
particular, 
and 
either 
affirmative 
or 
negative; 
the 
question 
arises, 
which 
form 
is 
the 
better? 
And 
the 
same 
question 
may 
be 
put 
in 
regard 
to 
so-called 
‘direct’ 
demonstration 
and 
reductio 
ad 
impossibile. 
Let 
us 
first 
examine 
the 
commensurately 
universal 
and 
the 
particular 
forms, 
and 
when 
we 
have 
cleared 
up 
this 
problem 
proceed 
to 
discuss 
‘direct’ 
demonstration 
and 
reductio 
ad 
impossibile. 


The 
following 
considerations 
might 
lead 
some 
minds 
to 
prefer 
particular 
demonstration. 


(1) 
The 
superior 
demonstration 
is 
the 
demonstration 
which 
gives 
us 
greater 
knowledge 
(for 
this 
is 
the 
ideal 
of 
demonstration), 
and 
we 
have 
greater 
knowledge 
of 
a 
particular 
individual 
when 
we 
know 
it 
in 
itself 
than 
when 
we 
know 
it 
through 
something 
else; 
e.g. 
we 
know 
Coriscus 
the 
musician 
better 
when 
we 
know 
that 
Coriscus 
is 
musical 
than 
when 
we 
know 
only 
that 
man 
is 
musical, 
and 
a 
like 
argument 
holds 
in 
all 
other 
cases. 
But 
commensurately 
universal 
demonstration, 
instead 
of 
proving 
that 
the 
subject 
itself 
actually 
is 
x, 
proves 
only 
that 
something 
else 
is 
x—e.g. 
in 
attempting 
to 
prove 
that 
isosceles 
is 
x, 
it 
proves 
not 
that 
isosceles 
but 
only 
that 
triangle 
is 
x—whereas 
particular 
demonstration 
proves 
that 
the 
subject 
itself 
is 
x. 
The 
demonstration, 
then, 
that 
a 
subject, 
as 
such, 
possesses 
an 
attribute 
is 
superior. 
If 
this 
is 
so, 
and 
if 
the 
particular 
rather 
than 
the 
commensurately 
universal 
forms 
demonstrates, 
particular 
demonstration 
is 
superior. 
(2) 
The 
universal 
has 
not 
a 
separate 
being 
over 
against 
groups 
of 
singulars. 
Demonstration 
nevertheless 
creates 
the 
opinion 
that 
its 
function 
is 
conditioned 
by 
something 
like 
this-some 
separate 
entity 
belonging 
to 
the 
real 
world; 
that, 
for 
instance, 
of 
triangle 
or 
of 
figure 
or 
number, 
over 
against 
particular 
triangles, 
figures, 
and 
numbers. 
But 
demonstration 
which 
touches 
the 
real 
and 
will 
not 
mislead 
is 
superior 
to 
that 
which 
moves 
among 
unrealities 
and 
is 
delusory. 
Now 
commensurately 
universal 
demonstration 
is 
of 
the 
latter 
kind: 
if 
we 
engage 
in 
it 
we 
find 
ourselves 
reasoning 
after 
a 
fashion 
well 
illustrated 
by 
the 
argument 
that 
the 
proportionate 
is 
what 
answers 
to 
the 
definition 
of 
some 
entity 
which 
is 
neither 
line, 
number, 
solid, 
nor 
plane, 
but 
a 
proportionate 
apart 
from 
all 
these. 
Since, 
then, 
such 
a 
proof 
is 

characteristically 
commensurate 
and 
universal, 
and 
less 
touches 
reality 
than 
does 
particular 
demonstration, 
and 
creates 
a 
false 
opinion, 
it 
will 
follow 
that 
commensurate 
and 
universal 
is 
inferior 
to 
particular 
demonstration. 


We 
may 
retort 
thus. 
(1) 
The 
first 
argument 
applies 
no 
more 
to 
commensurate 
and 
universal 
than 
to 
particular 
demonstration. 
If 
equality 
to 
two 
right 
angles 
is 
attributable 
to 
its 
subject 
not 
qua 
isosceles 
but 
qua 
triangle, 
he 
who 
knows 
that 
isosceles 
possesses 
that 
attribute 
knows 
the 
subject 
as 
qua 
itself 
possessing 
the 
attribute, 
to 
a 
less 
degree 
than 
he 
who 
knows 
that 
triangle 
has 
that 
attribute. 
To 
sum 
up 
the 
whole 
matter: 
if 
a 
subject 
is 
proved 
to 
possess 
qua 
triangle 
an 
attribute 
which 
it 
does 
not 
in 
fact 
possess 
qua 
triangle, 
that 
is 
not 
demonstration: 
but 
if 
it 
does 
possess 
it 
qua 
triangle 
the 
rule 
applies 
that 
the 
greater 
knowledge 
is 
his 
who 
knows 
the 
subject 
as 
possessing 
its 
attribute 
qua 
that 
in 
virtue 
of 
which 
it 
actually 
does 
possess 
it. 
Since, 
then, 
triangle 
is 
the 
wider 
term, 
and 
there 
is 
one 
identical 
definition 
of 
triangle-i.e. 
the 
term 
is 
not 
equivocal-and 
since 
equality 
to 
two 
right 
angles 
belongs 
to 
all 
triangles, 
it 
is 
isosceles 
qua 
triangle 
and 
not 
triangle 
qua 
isosceles 
which 
has 
its 
angles 
so 
related. 
It 
follows 
that 
he 
who 
knows 
a 
connexion 
universally 
has 
greater 
knowledge 
of 
it 
as 
it 
in 
fact 
is 
than 
he 
who 
knows 
the 
particular; 
and 
the 
inference 
is 
that 
commensurate 
and 
universal 
is 
superior 
to 
particular 
demonstration. 


(2) 
If 
there 
is 
a 
single 
identical 
definition 
i.e. 
if 
the 
commensurate 
universal 
is 
unequivocal-then 
the 
universal 
will 
possess 
being 
not 
less 
but 
more 
than 
some 
of 
the 
particulars, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
is 
universals 
which 
comprise 
the 
imperishable, 
particulars 
that 
tend 
to 
perish. 
(3) 
Because 
the 
universal 
has 
a 
single 
meaning, 
we 
are 
not 
therefore 
compelled 
to 
suppose 
that 
in 
these 
examples 
it 
has 
being 
as 
a 
substance 
apart 
from 
its 
particulars-any 
more 
than 
we 
need 
make 
a 
similar 
supposition 
in 
the 
other 
cases 
of 
unequivocal 
universal 
predication, 
viz. 
where 
the 
predicate 
signifies 
not 
substance 
but 
quality, 
essential 
relatedness, 
or 
action. 
If 
such 
a 
supposition 
is 
entertained, 
the 
blame 
rests 
not 
with 
the 
demonstration 
but 
with 
the 
hearer. 
(4) 
Demonstration 
is 
syllogism 
that 
proves 
the 
cause, 
i.e. 
the 
reasoned 
fact, 
and 
it 
is 
rather 
the 
commensurate 
universal 
than 
the 
particular 
which 
is 
causative 
(as 
may 
be 
shown 
thus: 
that 
which 
possesses 
an 
attribute 
through 
its 
own 
essential 
nature 
is 
itself 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
inherence, 
and 
the 
commensurate 
universal 
is 
primary; 
hence 
the 
commensurate 
universal 
is 
the 
cause). 
Consequently 
commensurately 
universal 
demonstration 
is 
superior 
as 

more 
especially 
proving 
the 
cause, 
that 
is 
the 
reasoned 
fact. 


(5) 
Our 
search 
for 
the 
reason 
ceases, 
and 
we 
think 
that 
we 
know, 
when 
the 
coming 
to 
be 
or 
existence 
of 
the 
fact 
before 
us 
is 
not 
due 
to 
the 
coming 
to 
be 
or 
existence 
of 
some 
other 
fact, 
for 
the 
last 
step 
of 
a 
search 
thus 
conducted 
is 
eo 
ipso 
the 
end 
and 
limit 
of 
the 
problem. 
Thus: 
‘Why 
did 
he 
come?’ 
‘To 
get 
the 
money-wherewith 
to 
pay 
a 
debt-that 
he 
might 
thereby 
do 
what 
was 
right.’ 
When 
in 
this 
regress 
we 
can 
no 
longer 
find 
an 
efficient 
or 
final 
cause, 
we 
regard 
the 
last 
step 
of 
it 
as 
the 
end 
of 
the 
coming-or 
being 
or 
coming 
to 
be-
and 
we 
regard 
ourselves 
as 
then 
only 
having 
full 
knowledge 
of 
the 
reason 
why 
he 
came. 
If, 
then, 
all 
causes 
and 
reasons 
are 
alike 
in 
this 
respect, 
and 
if 
this 
is 
the 
means 
to 
full 
knowledge 
in 
the 
case 
of 
final 
causes 
such 
as 
we 
have 
exemplified, 
it 
follows 
that 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
other 
causes 
also 
full 
knowledge 
is 
attained 
when 
an 
attribute 
no 
longer 
inheres 
because 
of 
something 
else. 
Thus, 
when 
we 
learn 
that 
exterior 
angles 
are 
equal 
to 
four 
right 
angles 
because 
they 
are 
the 
exterior 
angles 
of 
an 
isosceles, 
there 
still 
remains 
the 
question 
‘Why 
has 
isosceles 
this 
attribute?’ 
and 
its 
answer 
‘Because 
it 
is 
a 
triangle, 
and 
a 
triangle 
has 
it 
because 
a 
triangle 
is 
a 
rectilinear 
figure.’ 
If 
rectilinear 
figure 
possesses 
the 
property 
for 
no 
further 
reason, 
at 
this 
point 
we 
have 
full 
knowledge-but 
at 
this 
point 
our 
knowledge 
has 
become 
commensurately 
universal, 
and 
so 
we 
conclude 
that 
commensurately 
universal 
demonstration 
is 
superior. 


(6) 
The 
more 
demonstration 
becomes 
particular 
the 
more 
it 
sinks 
into 
an 
indeterminate 
manifold, 
while 
universal 
demonstration 
tends 
to 
the 
simple 
and 
determinate. 
But 
objects 
so 
far 
as 
they 
are 
an 
indeterminate 
manifold 
are 
unintelligible, 
so 
far 
as 
they 
are 
determinate, 
intelligible: 
they 
are 
therefore 
intelligible 
rather 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
are 
universal 
than 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
are 
particular. 
From 
this 
it 
follows 
that 
universals 
are 
more 
demonstrable: 
but 
since 
relative 
and 
correlative 
increase 
concomitantly, 
of 
the 
more 
demonstrable 
there 
will 
be 
fuller 
demonstration. 
Hence 
the 
commensurate 
and 
universal 
form, 
being 
more 
truly 
demonstration, 
is 
the 
superior. 
(7) 
Demonstration 
which 
teaches 
two 
things 
is 
preferable 
to 
demonstration 
which 
teaches 
only 
one. 
He 
who 
possesses 
commensurately 
universal 
demonstration 
knows 
the 
particular 
as 
well, 
but 
he 
who 
possesses 
particular 
demonstration 
does 
not 
know 
the 
universal. 
So 
that 
this 
is 
an 
additional 
reason 
for 
preferring 
commensurately 
universal 
demonstration. 
And 
there 
is 
yet 
this 
further 
argument: 

(8) 
Proof 
becomes 
more 
and 
more 
proof 
of 
the 
commensurate 
universal 
as 
its 
middle 
term 
approaches 
nearer 
to 
the 
basic 
truth, 
and 
nothing 
is 
so 
near 
as 
the 
immediate 
premiss 
which 
is 
itself 
the 
basic 
truth. 
If, 
then, 
proof 
from 
the 
basic 
truth 
is 
more 
accurate 
than 
proof 
not 
so 
derived, 
demonstration 
which 
depends 
more 
closely 
on 
it 
is 
more 
accurate 
than 
demonstration 
which 
is 
less 
closely 
dependent. 
But 
commensurately 
universal 
demonstration 
is 
characterized 
by 
this 
closer 
dependence, 
and 
is 
therefore 
superior. 
Thus, 
if 
A 
had 
to 
be 
proved 
to 
inhere 
in 
D, 
and 
the 
middles 
were 
B 
and 
C, 
B 
being 
the 
higher 
term 
would 
render 
the 
demonstration 
which 
it 
mediated 
the 
more 
universal. 
Some 
of 
these 
arguments, 
however, 
are 
dialectical. 
The 
clearest 
indication 
of 
the 
precedence 
of 
commensurately 
universal 
demonstration 
is 
as 
follows: 
if 
of 
two 
propositions, 
a 
prior 
and 
a 
posterior, 
we 
have 
a 
grasp 
of 
the 
prior, 
we 
have 
a 
kind 
of 
knowledge-a 
potential 
grasp-of 
the 
posterior 
as 
well. 
For 
example, 
if 
one 
knows 
that 
the 
angles 
of 
all 
triangles 
are 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles, 
one 
knows 
in 
a 
sense-potentially-that 
the 
isosceles’ 
angles 
also 
are 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles, 
even 
if 
one 
does 
not 
know 
that 
the 
isosceles 
is 
a 
triangle; 
but 
to 
grasp 
this 
posterior 
proposition 
is 
by 
no 
means 
to 
know 
the 
commensurate 
universal 
either 
potentially 
or 
actually. 
Moreover, 
commensurately 
universal 
demonstration 
is 
through 
and 
through 
intelligible; 
particular 
demonstration 
issues 
in 
sense-perception. 


The 
preceding 
arguments 
constitute 
our 
defence 
of 
the 
superiority 
of 
commensurately 
universal 
to 
particular 
demonstration. 
That 
affirmative 
demonstration 
excels 
negative 
may 
be 
shown 
as 
follows. 


(1) 
We 
may 
assume 
the 
superiority 
ceteris 
paribus 
of 
the 
demonstration 
which 
derives 
from 
fewer 
postulates 
or 
hypotheses-in 
short 
from 
fewer 
premisses; 
for, 
given 
that 
all 
these 
are 
equally 
well 
known, 
where 
they 
are 
fewer 
knowledge 
will 
be 
more 
speedily 
acquired, 
and 
that 
is 
a 
desideratum. 
The 
argument 
implied 
in 
our 
contention 
that 
demonstration 
from 
fewer 
assumptions 
is 
superior 
may 
be 
set 
out 
in 
universal 
form 
as 
follows. 
Assuming 
that 
in 
both 
cases 
alike 
the 
middle 
terms 
are 
known, 
and 
that 
middles 
which 
are 
prior 
are 
better 
known 
than 
such 
as 
are 
posterior, 
we 
may 
suppose 
two 
demonstrations 
of 
the 
inherence 
of 
A 
in 
E, 
the 
one 
proving 
it 
through 
the 
middles 
B, 
C 
and 
D, 
the 
other 
through 
F 
and 
G. 
Then 
A-D 
is 

known 
to 
the 
same 
degree 
as 
A-E 
(in 
the 
second 
proof), 
but 
A-D 
is 
better 
known 
than 
and 
prior 
to 
A-E 
(in 
the 
first 
proof); 
since 
A-E 
is 
proved 
through 
A-D, 
and 
the 
ground 
is 
more 
certain 
than 
the 
conclusion. 


Hence 
demonstration 
by 
fewer 
premisses 
is 
ceteris 
paribus 
superior. 
Now 
both 
affirmative 
and 
negative 
demonstration 
operate 
through 
three 
terms 
and 
two 
premisses, 
but 
whereas 
the 
former 
assumes 
only 
that 
something 
is, 
the 
latter 
assumes 
both 
that 
something 
is 
and 
that 
something 
else 
is 
not, 
and 
thus 
operating 
through 
more 
kinds 
of 
premiss 
is 
inferior. 


(2) 
It 
has 
been 
proved 
that 
no 
conclusion 
follows 
if 
both 
premisses 
are 
negative, 
but 
that 
one 
must 
be 
negative, 
the 
other 
affirmative. 
So 
we 
are 
compelled 
to 
lay 
down 
the 
following 
additional 
rule: 
as 
the 
demonstration 
expands, 
the 
affirmative 
premisses 
must 
increase 
in 
number, 
but 
there 
cannot 
be 
more 
than 
one 
negative 
premiss 
in 
each 
complete 
proof. 
Thus, 
suppose 
no 
B 
is 
A, 
and 
all 
C 
is 
B. 
Then 
if 
both 
the 
premisses 
are 
to 
be 
again 
expanded, 
a 
middle 
must 
be 
interposed. 
Let 
us 
interpose 
D 
between 
A 
and 
B, 
and 
E 
between 
B 
and 
C. 
Then 
clearly 
E 
is 
affirmatively 
related 
to 
B 
and 
C, 
while 
D 
is 
affirmatively 
related 
to 
B 
but 
negatively 
to 
A; 
for 
all 
B 
is 
D, 
but 
there 
must 
be 
no 
D 
which 
is 
A. 
Thus 
there 
proves 
to 
be 
a 
single 
negative 
premiss, 
A-D. 
In 
the 
further 
prosyllogisms 
too 
it 
is 
the 
same, 
because 
in 
the 
terms 
of 
an 
affirmative 
syllogism 
the 
middle 
is 
always 
related 
affirmatively 
to 
both 
extremes; 
in 
a 
negative 
syllogism 
it 
must 
be 
negatively 
related 
only 
to 
one 
of 
them, 
and 
so 
this 
negation 
comes 
to 
be 
a 
single 
negative 
premiss, 
the 
other 
premisses 
being 
affirmative. 
If, 
then, 
that 
through 
which 
a 
truth 
is 
proved 
is 
a 
better 
known 
and 
more 
certain 
truth, 
and 
if 
the 
negative 
proposition 
is 
proved 
through 
the 
affirmative 
and 
not 
vice 
versa, 
affirmative 
demonstration, 
being 
prior 
and 
better 
known 
and 
more 
certain, 
will 
be 
superior. 
(3) 
The 
basic 
truth 
of 
demonstrative 
syllogism 
is 
the 
universal 
immediate 
premiss, 
and 
the 
universal 
premiss 
asserts 
in 
affirmative 
demonstration 
and 
in 
negative 
denies: 
and 
the 
affirmative 
proposition 
is 
prior 
to 
and 
better 
known 
than 
the 
negative 
(since 
affirmation 
explains 
denial 
and 
is 
prior 
to 
denial, 
just 
as 
being 
is 
prior 
to 
not-being). 
It 
follows 
that 
the 
basic 
premiss 
of 
affirmative 
demonstration 
is 
superior 
to 
that 
of 
negative 
demonstration, 
and 
the 
demonstration 
which 
uses 
superior 
basic 
premisses 
is 
superior. 
(4) 
Affirmative 
demonstration 
is 
more 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
basic 
form 
of 
proof, 
because 
it 
is 
a 
sine 
qua 
non 
of 
negative 
demonstration. 

Since 
affirmative 
demonstration 
is 
superior 
to 
negative, 
it 
is 
clearly 
superior 
also 
to 
reductio 
ad 
impossibile. 
We 
must 
first 
make 
certain 
what 
is 
the 
difference 
between 
negative 
demonstration 
and 
reductio 
ad 
impossibile. 
Let 
us 
suppose 
that 
no 
B 
is 
A, 
and 
that 
all 
C 
is 
B: 
the 
conclusion 
necessarily 
follows 
that 
no 
C 
is 
A. 
If 
these 
premisses 
are 
assumed, 
therefore, 
the 
negative 
demonstration 
that 
no 
C 
is 
A 
is 
direct. 
Reductio 
ad 
impossibile, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
proceeds 
as 
follows. 
Supposing 
we 
are 
to 
prove 
that 
does 
not 
inhere 
in 
B, 
we 
have 
to 
assume 
that 
it 
does 
inhere, 
and 
further 
that 
B 
inheres 
in 
C, 
with 
the 
resulting 
inference 
that 
A 
inheres 
in 
C. 
This 
we 
have 
to 
suppose 
a 
known 
and 
admitted 
impossibility; 
and 
we 
then 
infer 
that 
A 
cannot 
inhere 
in 
B. 
Thus 
if 
the 
inherence 
of 
B 
in 
C 
is 
not 
questioned, 
A’s 
inherence 
in 
B 
is 
impossible. 


The 
order 
of 
the 
terms 
is 
the 
same 
in 
both 
proofs: 
they 
differ 
according 
to 
which 
of 
the 
negative 
propositions 
is 
the 
better 
known, 
the 
one 
denying 
A 
of 
B 
or 
the 
one 
denying 
A 
of 
C. 
When 
the 
falsity 
of 
the 
conclusion 
is 
the 
better 
known, 
we 
use 
reductio 
ad 
impossible; 
when 
the 
major 
premiss 
of 
the 
syllogism 
is 
the 
more 
obvious, 
we 
use 
direct 
demonstration. 
All 
the 
same 
the 
proposition 
denying 
A 
of 
B 
is, 
in 
the 
order 
of 
being, 
prior 
to 
that 
denying 
A 
of 
C; 
for 
premisses 
are 
prior 
to 
the 
conclusion 
which 
follows 
from 
them, 
and 
‘no 
C 
is 
A’ 
is 
the 
conclusion, 
‘no 
B 
is 
A’ 
one 
of 
its 
premisses. 
For 
the 
destructive 
result 
of 
reductio 
ad 
impossibile 
is 
not 
a 
proper 
conclusion, 
nor 
are 
its 
antecedents 
proper 
premisses. 
On 
the 
contrary: 
the 
constituents 
of 
syllogism 
are 
premisses 
related 
to 
one 
another 
as 
whole 
to 
part 
or 
part 
to 
whole, 
whereas 
the 
premisses 
A-C 
and 
A-B 
are 
not 
thus 
related 
to 
one 
another. 
Now 
the 
superior 
demonstration 
is 
that 
which 
proceeds 
from 
better 
known 
and 
prior 
premisses, 
and 
while 
both 
these 
forms 
depend 
for 
credence 
on 
the 
not-being 
of 
something, 
yet 
the 
source 
of 
the 
one 
is 
prior 
to 
that 
of 
the 
other. 
Therefore 
negative 
demonstration 
will 
have 
an 
unqualified 
superiority 
to 
reductio 
ad 
impossibile, 
and 
affirmative 
demonstration, 
being 
superior 
to 
negative, 
will 
consequently 
be 
superior 
also 
to 
reductio 
ad 
impossibile. 


The 
science 
which 
is 
knowledge 
at 
once 
of 
the 
fact 
and 
of 
the 
reasoned 
fact, 
not 
of 
the 
fact 
by 
itself 
without 
the 
reasoned 
fact, 
is 
the 
more 
exact 
and 
the 
prior 
science. 


A 
science 
such 
as 
arithmetic, 
which 
is 
not 
a 
science 
of 
properties 
qua 
inhering 
in 
a 
substratum, 
is 
more 
exact 
than 
and 
prior 
to 
a 
science 
like 



harmonics, 
which 
is 
a 
science 
of 
pr,operties 
inhering 
in 
a 
substratum; 
and 
similarly 
a 
science 
like 
arithmetic, 
which 
is 
constituted 
of 
fewer 
basic 
elements, 
is 
more 
exact 
than 
and 
prior 
to 
geometry, 
which 
requires 
additional 
elements. 
What 
I 
mean 
by 
‘additional 
elements’ 
is 
this: 
a 
unit 
is 
substance 
without 
position, 
while 
a 
point 
is 
substance 
with 
position; 
the 
latter 
contains 
an 
additional 
element. 


28 


A 
single 
science 
is 
one 
whose 
domain 
is 
a 
single 
genus, 
viz. 
all 
the 
subjects 
constituted 
out 
of 
the 
primary 
entities 
of 
the 
genus-i.e. 
the 
parts 
of 
this 
total 
subject-and 
their 
essential 
properties. 


One 
science 
differs 
from 
another 
when 
their 
basic 
truths 
have 
neither 
a 
common 
source 
nor 
are 
derived 
those 
of 
the 
one 
science 
from 
those 
the 
other. 
This 
is 
verified 
when 
we 
reach 
the 
indemonstrable 
premisses 
of 
a 
science, 
for 
they 
must 
be 
within 
one 
genus 
with 
its 
conclusions: 
and 
this 
again 
is 
verified 
if 
the 
conclusions 
proved 
by 
means 
of 
them 
fall 
within 
one 
genus-i.e. 
are 
homogeneous. 


29 


One 
can 
have 
several 
demonstrations 
of 
the 
same 
connexion 
not 
only 
by 
taking 
from 
the 
same 
series 
of 
predication 
middles 
which 
are 
other 
than 
the 
immediately 
cohering 
term 
e.g. 
by 
taking 
C, 
D, 
and 
F 
severally 
to 
prove 
A-B 
—but 
also 
by 
taking 
a 
middle 
from 
another 
series. 
Thus 
let 
A 
be 
change, 
D 
alteration 
of 
a 
property, 
B 
feeling 
pleasure, 
and 
G 
relaxation. 
We 
can 
then 
without 
falsehood 
predicate 
D 
of 
B 
and 
A 
of 
D, 
for 
he 
who 
is 
pleased 
suffers 
alteration 
of 
a 
property, 
and 
that 
which 
alters 
a 
property 
changes. 
Again, 
we 
can 
predicate 
A 
of 
G 
without 
falsehood, 
and 
G 
of 
B; 
for 
to 
feel 
pleasure 
is 
to 
relax, 
and 
to 
relax 
is 
to 
change. 
So 
the 
conclusion 
can 
be 
drawn 
through 
middles 
which 
are 
different, 
i.e. 
not 
in 
the 
same 
series-yet 
not 
so 
that 
neither 
of 
these 
middles 
is 
predicable 
of 
the 
other, 
for 
they 
must 
both 
be 
attributable 
to 
some 
one 
subject. 


A 
further 
point 
worth 
investigating 
is 
how 
many 
ways 
of 
proving 
the 
same 
conclusion 
can 
be 
obtained 
by 
varying 
the 
figure, 



There 
is 
no 
knowledge 
by 
demonstration 
of 
chance 
conjunctions; 
for 
chance 
conjunctions 
exist 
neither 
by 
necessity 
nor 
as 
general 
connexions 
but 
comprise 
what 
comes 
to 
be 
as 
something 
distinct 
from 
these. 
Now 
demonstration 
is 
concerned 
only 
with 
one 
or 
other 
of 
these 
two; 
for 
all 
reasoning 
proceeds 
from 
necessary 
or 
general 
premisses, 
the 
conclusion 
being 
necessary 
if 
the 
premisses 
are 
necessary 
and 
general 
if 
the 
premisses 
are 
general. 
Consequently, 
if 
chance 
conjunctions 
are 
neither 
general 
nor 
necessary, 
they 
are 
not 
demonstrable. 


Scientific 
knowledge 
is 
not 
possible 
through 
the 
act 
of 
perception. 
Even 
if 
perception 
as 
a 
faculty 
is 
of 
‘the 
such’ 
and 
not 
merely 
of 
a 
‘this 
somewhat’, 
yet 
one 
must 
at 
any 
rate 
actually 
perceive 
a 
‘this 
somewhat’, 
and 
at 
a 
definite 
present 
place 
and 
time: 
but 
that 
which 
is 
commensurately 
universal 
and 
true 
in 
all 
cases 
one 
cannot 
perceive, 
since 
it 
is 
not 
‘this’ 
and 
it 
is 
not 
‘now’; 
if 
it 
were, 
it 
would 
not 
be 
commensurately 
universal-the 
term 
we 
apply 
to 
what 
is 
always 
and 
everywhere. 
Seeing, 
therefore, 
that 
demonstrations 
are 
commensurately 
universal 
and 
universals 
imperceptible, 
we 
clearly 
cannot 
obtain 
scientific 
knowledge 
by 
the 
act 
of 
perception: 
nay, 
it 
is 
obvious 
that 
even 
if 
it 
were 
possible 
to 
perceive 
that 
a 
triangle 
has 
its 
angles 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles, 
we 
should 
still 
be 
looking 
for 
a 
demonstration-we 
should 
not 
(as 
some 
say) 
possess 
knowledge 
of 
it; 
for 
perception 
must 
be 
of 
a 
particular, 
whereas 
scientific 
knowledge 
involves 
the 
recognition 
of 
the 
commensurate 
universal. 
So 
if 
we 
were 
on 
the 
moon, 
and 
saw 
the 
earth 
shutting 
out 
the 
sun’s 
light, 
we 
should 
not 
know 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
eclipse: 
we 
should 
perceive 
the 
present 
fact 
of 
the 
eclipse, 
but 
not 
the 
reasoned 
fact 
at 
all, 
since 
the 
act 
of 
perception 
is 
not 
of 
the 
commensurate 
universal. 
I 
do 
not, 
of 
course, 
deny 
that 
by 
watching 
the 
frequent 
recurrence 
of 
this 
event 
we 
might, 
after 
tracking 
the 
commensurate 
universal, 
possess 
a 
demonstration, 
for 
the 
commensurate 
universal 
is 
elicited 
from 
the 
several 
groups 
of 
singulars. 


The 
commensurate 
universal 
is 
precious 
because 
it 
makes 
clear 
the 
cause; 
so 
that 
in 
the 
case 
of 
facts 
like 
these 
which 
have 
a 
cause 
other 
than 
themselves 
universal 
knowledge 
is 
more 
precious 
than 
sense-perceptions 
and 
than 
intuition. 
(As 
regards 
primary 
truths 
there 
is 
of 
course 
a 
different 



account 
to 
be 
given.) 
Hence 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
knowledge 
of 
things 
demonstrable 
cannot 
be 
acquired 
by 
perception, 
unless 
the 
term 
perception 
is 
applied 
to 
the 
possession 
of 
scientific 
knowledge 
through 
demonstration. 
Nevertheless 
certain 
points 
do 
arise 
with 
regard 
to 
connexions 
to 
be 
proved 
which 
are 
referred 
for 
their 
explanation 
to 
a 
failure 
in 
sense-perception: 
there 
are 
cases 
when 
an 
act 
of 
vision 
would 
terminate 
our 
inquiry, 
not 
because 
in 
seeing 
we 
should 
be 
knowing, 
but 
because 
we 
should 
have 
elicited 
the 
universal 
from 
seeing; 
if, 
for 
example, 
we 
saw 
the 
pores 
in 
the 
glass 
and 
the 
light 
passing 
through, 
the 
reason 
of 
the 
kindling 
would 
be 
clear 
to 
us 
because 
we 
should 
at 
the 
same 
time 
see 
it 
in 
each 
instance 
and 
intuit 
that 
it 
must 
be 
so 
in 
all 
instances. 


All 
syllogisms 
cannot 
have 
the 
same 
basic 
truths. 
This 
may 
be 
shown 
first 
of 
all 
by 
the 
following 
dialectical 
considerations. 
(1) 
Some 
syllogisms 
are 
true 
and 
some 
false: 
for 
though 
a 
true 
inference 
is 
possible 
from 
false 
premisses, 
yet 
this 
occurs 
once 
only-I 
mean 
if 
A 
for 
instance, 
is 
truly 
predicable 
of 
C, 
but 
B, 
the 
middle, 
is 
false, 
both 
A-B 
and 
B-C 
being 
false; 
nevertheless, 
if 
middles 
are 
taken 
to 
prove 
these 
premisses, 
they 
will 
be 
false 
because 
every 
conclusion 
which 
is 
a 
falsehood 
has 
false 
premisses, 
while 
true 
conclusions 
have 
true 
premisses, 
and 
false 
and 
true 
differ 
in 
kind. 
Then 
again, 


(2) 
falsehoods 
are 
not 
all 
derived 
from 
a 
single 
identical 
set 
of 
principles: 
there 
are 
falsehoods 
which 
are 
the 
contraries 
of 
one 
another 
and 
cannot 
coexist, 
e.g. 
‘justice 
is 
injustice’, 
and 
‘justice 
is 
cowardice’; 
‘man 
is 
horse’, 
and 
‘man 
is 
ox’; 
‘the 
equal 
is 
greater’, 
and 
‘the 
equal 
is 
less.’ 
From 
established 
principles 
we 
may 
argue 
the 
case 
as 
follows, 
confining-ourselves 
therefore 
to 
true 
conclusions. 
Not 
even 
all 
these 
are 
inferred 
from 
the 
same 
basic 
truths; 
many 
of 
them 
in 
fact 
have 
basic 
truths 
which 
differ 
generically 
and 
are 
not 
transferable; 
units, 
for 
instance, 
which 
are 
without 
position, 
cannot 
take 
the 
place 
of 
points, 
which 
have 
position. 
The 
transferred 
terms 
could 
only 
fit 
in 
as 
middle 
terms 
or 
as 
major 
or 
minor 
terms, 
or 
else 
have 
some 
of 
the 
other 
terms 
between 
them, 
others 
outside 
them. 
Nor 
can 
any 
of 
the 
common 
axioms-such, 
I 
mean, 
as 
the 
law 
of 
excluded 
middle-serve 
as 
premisses 
for 
the 
proof 
of 
all 
conclusions. 
For 
the 
kinds 
of 
being 
are 
different, 
and 
some 
attributes 
attach 
to 
quanta 
and 
some 
to 
qualia 
only; 
and 
proof 
is 
achieved 
by 
means 
of 
the 
common 
axioms 
taken 
in 



conjunction 
with 
these 
several 
kinds 
and 
their 
attributes. 


Again, 
it 
is 
not 
true 
that 
the 
basic 
truths 
are 
much 
fewer 
than 
the 
conclusions, 
for 
the 
basic 
truths 
are 
the 
premisses, 
and 
the 
premisses 
are 
formed 
by 
the 
apposition 
of 
a 
fresh 
extreme 
term 
or 
the 
interposition 
of 
a 
fresh 
middle. 
Moreover, 
the 
number 
of 
conclusions 
is 
indefinite, 
though 
the 
number 
of 
middle 
terms 
is 
finite; 
and 
lastly 
some 
of 
the 
basic 
truths 
are 
necessary, 
others 
variable. 


Looking 
at 
it 
in 
this 
way 
we 
see 
that, 
since 
the 
number 
of 
conclusions 
is 
indefinite, 
the 
basic 
truths 
cannot 
be 
identical 
or 
limited 
in 
number. 
If, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
identity 
is 
used 
in 
another 
sense, 
and 
it 
is 
said, 
e.g. 
‘these 
and 
no 
other 
are 
the 
fundamental 
truths 
of 
geometry, 
these 
the 
fundamentals 
of 
calculation, 
these 
again 
of 
medicine’; 
would 
the 
statement 
mean 
anything 
except 
that 
the 
sciences 
have 
basic 
truths? 
To 
call 
them 
identical 
because 
they 
are 
self-identical 
is 
absurd, 
since 
everything 
can 
be 
identified 
with 
everything 
in 
that 
sense 
of 
identity. 
Nor 
again 
can 
the 
contention 
that 
all 
conclusions 
have 
the 
same 
basic 
truths 
mean 
that 
from 
the 
mass 
of 
all 
possible 
premisses 
any 
conclusion 
may 
be 
drawn. 
That 
would 
be 
exceedingly 
naive, 
for 
it 
is 
not 
the 
case 
in 
the 
clearly 
evident 
mathematical 
sciences, 
nor 
is 
it 
possible 
in 
analysis, 
since 
it 
is 
the 
immediate 
premisses 
which 
are 
the 
basic 
truths, 
and 
a 
fresh 
conclusion 
is 
only 
formed 
by 
the 
addition 
of 
a 
new 
immediate 
premiss: 
but 
if 
it 
be 
admitted 
that 
it 
is 
these 
primary 
immediate 
premisses 
which 
are 
basic 
truths, 
each 
subject-genus 
will 
provide 
one 
basic 
truth. 
If, 
however, 
it 
is 
not 
argued 
that 
from 
the 
mass 
of 
all 
possible 
premisses 
any 
conclusion 
may 
be 
proved, 
nor 
yet 
admitted 
that 
basic 
truths 
differ 
so 
as 
to 
be 
generically 
different 
for 
each 
science, 
it 
remains 
to 
consider 
the 
possibility 
that, 
while 
the 
basic 
truths 
of 
all 
knowledge 
are 
within 
one 
genus, 
special 
premisses 
are 
required 
to 
prove 
special 
conclusions. 
But 
that 
this 
cannot 
be 
the 
case 
has 
been 
shown 
by 
our 
proof 
that 
the 
basic 
truths 
of 
things 
generically 
different 
themselves 
differ 
generically. 
For 
fundamental 
truths 
are 
of 
two 
kinds, 
those 
which 
are 
premisses 
of 
demonstration 
and 
the 
subject-genus; 
and 
though 
the 
former 
are 
common, 
the 
latter-number, 
for 
instance, 
and 
magnitude-are 
peculiar. 


Scientific 
knowledge 
and 
its 
object 
differ 
from 
opinion 
and 
the 
object 
of 
opinion 
in 
that 
scientific 
knowledge 
is 
commensurately 
universal 
and 



proceeds 
by 
necessary 
connexions, 
and 
that 
which 
is 
necessary 
cannot 
be 
otherwise. 
So 
though 
there 
are 
things 
which 
are 
true 
and 
real 
and 
yet 
can 
be 
otherwise, 
scientific 
knowledge 
clearly 
does 
not 
concern 
them: 
if 
it 
did, 
things 
which 
can 
be 
otherwise 
would 
be 
incapable 
of 
being 
otherwise. 
Nor 
are 
they 
any 
concern 
of 
rational 
intuition-by 
rational 
intuition 
I 
mean 
an 
originative 
source 
of 
scientific 
knowledge-nor 
of 
indemonstrable 
knowledge, 
which 
is 
the 
grasping 
of 
the 
immediate 
premiss. 
Since 
then 
rational 
intuition, 
science, 
and 
opinion, 
and 
what 
is 
revealed 
by 
these 
terms, 
are 
the 
only 
things 
that 
can 
be 
‘true’, 
it 
follows 
that 
it 
is 
opinion 
that 
is 
concerned 
with 
that 
which 
may 
be 
true 
or 
false, 
and 
can 
be 
otherwise: 
opinion 
in 
fact 
is 
the 
grasp 
of 
a 
premiss 
which 
is 
immediate 
but 
not 
necessary. 
This 
view 
also 
fits 
the 
observed 
facts, 
for 
opinion 
is 
unstable, 
and 
so 
is 
the 
kind 
of 
being 
we 
have 
described 
as 
its 
object. 
Besides, 
when 
a 
man 
thinks 
a 
truth 
incapable 
of 
being 
otherwise 
he 
always 
thinks 
that 
he 
knows 
it, 
never 
that 
he 
opines 
it. 
He 
thinks 
that 
he 
opines 
when 
he 
thinks 
that 
a 
connexion, 
though 
actually 
so, 
may 
quite 
easily 
be 
otherwise; 
for 
he 
believes 
that 
such 
is 
the 
proper 
object 
of 
opinion, 
while 
the 
necessary 
is 
the 
object 
of 
knowledge. 


In 
what 
sense, 
then, 
can 
the 
same 
thing 
be 
the 
object 
of 
both 
opinion 
and 
knowledge? 
And 
if 
any 
one 
chooses 
to 
maintain 
that 
all 
that 
he 
knows 
he 
can 
also 
opine, 
why 
should 
not 
opinion 
be 
knowledge? 
For 
he 
that 
knows 
and 
he 
that 
opines 
will 
follow 
the 
same 
train 
of 
thought 
through 
the 
same 
middle 
terms 
until 
the 
immediate 
premisses 
are 
reached; 
because 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
opine 
not 
only 
the 
fact 
but 
also 
the 
reasoned 
fact, 
and 
the 
reason 
is 
the 
middle 
term; 
so 
that, 
since 
the 
former 
knows, 
he 
that 
opines 
also 
has 
knowledge. 


The 
truth 
perhaps 
is 
that 
if 
a 
man 
grasp 
truths 
that 
cannot 
be 
other 
than 
they 
are, 
in 
the 
way 
in 
which 
he 
grasps 
the 
definitions 
through 
which 
demonstrations 
take 
place, 
he 
will 
have 
not 
opinion 
but 
knowledge: 
if 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
he 
apprehends 
these 
attributes 
as 
inhering 
in 
their 
subjects, 
but 
not 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
subjects’ 
substance 
and 
essential 
nature 
possesses 
opinion 
and 
not 
genuine 
knowledge; 
and 
his 
opinion, 
if 
obtained 
through 
immediate 
premisses, 
will 
be 
both 
of 
the 
fact 
and 
of 
the 
reasoned 
fact; 
if 
not 
so 
obtained, 
of 
the 
fact 
alone. 
The 
object 
of 
opinion 
and 
knowledge 
is 
not 
quite 
identical; 
it 
is 
only 
in 
a 
sense 
identical, 
just 
as 
the 
object 
of 
true 
and 
false 
opinion 
is 
in 
a 
sense 
identical. 
The 
sense 
in 
which 
some 
maintain 
that 
true 
and 
false 
opinion 
can 
have 
the 
same 
object 
leads 
them 
to 
embrace 
many 
strange 
doctrines, 
particularly 
the 
doctrine 
that 
what 
a 
man 
opines 
falsely 
he 
does 
not 
opine 
at 
all. 
There 
are 
really 
many 
senses 
of 
‘identical’, 
and 
in 
one 
sense 
the 
object 
of 



true 
and 
false 
opinion 
can 
be 
the 
same, 
in 
another 
it 
cannot. 
Thus, 
to 
have 
a 
true 
opinion 
that 
the 
diagonal 
is 
commensurate 
with 
the 
side 
would 
be 
absurd: 
but 
because 
the 
diagonal 
with 
which 
they 
are 
both 
concerned 
is 
the 
same, 
the 
two 
opinions 
have 
objects 
so 
far 
the 
same: 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
as 
regards 
their 
essential 
definable 
nature 
these 
objects 
differ. 
The 
identity 
of 
the 
objects 
of 
knowledge 
and 
opinion 
is 
similar. 
Knowledge 
is 
the 
apprehension 
of, 
e.g. 
the 
attribute 
‘animal’ 
as 
incapable 
of 
being 
otherwise, 
opinion 
the 
apprehension 
of 
‘animal’ 
as 
capable 
of 
being 
otherwise-e.g. 
the 
apprehension 
that 
animal 
is 
an 
element 
in 
the 
essential 
nature 
of 
man 
is 
knowledge; 
the 
apprehension 
of 
animal 
as 
predicable 
of 
man 
but 
not 
as 
an 
element 
in 
man’s 
essential 
nature 
is 
opinion: 
man 
is 
the 
subject 
in 
both 
judgements, 
but 
the 
mode 
of 
inherence 
differs. 


This 
also 
shows 
that 
one 
cannot 
opine 
and 
know 
the 
same 
thing 
simultaneously; 
for 
then 
one 
would 
apprehend 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
both 
capable 
and 
incapable 
of 
being 
otherwise-an 
impossibility. 
Knowledge 
and 
opinion 
of 
the 
same 
thing 
can 
co-exist 
in 
two 
different 
people 
in 
the 
sense 
we 
have 
explained, 
but 
not 
simultaneously 
in 
the 
same 
person. 
That 
would 
involve 
a 
man’s 
simultaneously 
apprehending, 
e.g. 
(1) 
that 
man 
is 
essentially 
animal-

i.e. 
cannot 
be 
other 
than 
animal-and 
(2) 
that 
man 
is 
not 
essentially 
animal, 
that 
is, 
we 
may 
assume, 
may 
be 
other 
than 
animal. 
Further 
consideration 
of 
modes 
of 
thinking 
and 
their 
distribution 
under 
the 
heads 
of 
discursive 
thought, 
intuition, 
science, 
art, 
practical 
wisdom, 
and 
metaphysical 
thinking, 
belongs 
rather 
partly 
to 
natural 
science, 
partly 
to 
moral 
philosophy. 


Quick 
wit 
is 
a 
faculty 
of 
hitting 
upon 
the 
middle 
term 
instantaneously. 
It 
would 
be 
exemplified 
by 
a 
man 
who 
saw 
that 
the 
moon 
has 
her 
bright 
side 
always 
turned 
towards 
the 
sun, 
and 
quickly 
grasped 
the 
cause 
of 
this, 
namely 
that 
she 
borrows 
her 
light 
from 
him; 
or 
observed 
somebody 
in 
conversation 
with 
a 
man 
of 
wealth 
and 
divined 
that 
he 
was 
borrowing 
money, 
or 
that 
the 
friendship 
of 
these 
people 
sprang 
from 
a 
common 
enmity. 
In 
all 
these 
instances 
he 
has 
seen 
the 
major 
and 
minor 
terms 
and 
then 
grasped 
the 
causes, 
the 
middle 
terms. 


Let 
A 
represent 
‘bright 
side 
turned 
sunward’, 
B 
‘lighted 
from 
the 
sun’, 
C 
the 
moon. 
Then 
B, 
‘lighted 
from 
the 
sun’ 
is 
predicable 
of 
C, 
the 
moon, 
and 



A, 
‘having 
her 
bright 
side 
towards 
the 
source 
of 
her 
light’, 
is 
predicable 
of 
B. 
So 
A 
is 
predicable 
of 
C 
through 
B.

The 
kinds 
of 
question 
we 
ask 
are 
as 
many 
as 
the 
kinds 
of 
things 
which 
we 
know. 
They 
are 
in 
fact 
four:-(1) 
whether 
the 
connexion 
of 
an 
attribute 
with 
a 
thing 
is 
a 
fact, 
(2) 
what 
is 
the 
reason 
of 
the 
connexion, 
(3) 
whether 
a 
thing 
exists, 
(4) 
What 
is 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
thing. 
Thus, 
when 
our 
question 
concerns 
a 
complex 
of 
thing 
and 
attribute 
and 
we 
ask 
whether 
the 
thing 
is 
thus 
or 
otherwise 
qualified-whether, 
e.g. 
the 
sun 
suffers 
eclipse 
or 
not-then 
we 
are 
asking 
as 
to 
the 
fact 
of 
a 
connexion. 
That 
our 
inquiry 
ceases 
with 
the 
discovery 
that 
the 
sun 
does 
suffer 
eclipse 
is 
an 
indication 
of 
this; 
and 
if 
we 
know 
from 
the 
start 
that 
the 
sun 
suffers 
eclipse, 
we 
do 
not 
inquire 
whether 
it 
does 
so 
or 
not. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
when 
we 
know 
the 
fact 
we 
ask 
the 
reason; 
as, 
for 
example, 
when 
we 
know 
that 
the 
sun 
is 
being 
eclipsed 
and 
that 
an 
earthquake 
is 
in 
progress, 
it 
is 
the 
reason 
of 
eclipse 
or 
earthquake 
into 
which 
we 
inquire. 


Where 
a 
complex 
is 
concerned, 
then, 
those 
are 
the 
two 
questions 
we 
ask; 
but 
for 
some 
objects 
of 
inquiry 
we 
have 
a 
different 
kind 
of 
question 
to 
ask, 
such 
as 
whether 
there 
is 
or 
is 
not 
a 
centaur 
or 
a 
God. 
(By 
‘is 
or 
is 
not’ 
I 
mean 
‘is 
or 
is 
not, 
without 
further 
qualification’; 
as 
opposed 
to 
‘is 
or 
is 
not 
[e.g.] 
white’.) 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
when 
we 
have 
ascertained 
the 
thing’s 
existence, 
we 
inquire 
as 
to 
its 
nature, 
asking, 
for 
instance, 
‘what, 
then, 
is 
God?’ 
or 
‘what 
is 
man?’. 


2 


These, 
then, 
are 
the 
four 
kinds 
of 
question 
we 
ask, 
and 
it 
is 
in 
the 
answers 
to 
these 
questions 
that 
our 
knowledge 
consists. 


Now 
when 
we 
ask 
whether 
a 
connexion 
is 
a 
fact, 
or 
whether 
a 
thing 



without 
qualification 
is, 
we 
are 
really 
asking 
whether 
the 
connexion 
or 
the 
thing 
has 
a 
‘middle’; 
and 
when 
we 
have 
ascertained 
either 
that 
the 
connexion 
is 
a 
fact 
or 
that 
the 
thing 
is-i.e. 
ascertained 
either 
the 
partial 
or 
the 
unqualified 
being 
of 
the 
thing-and 
are 
proceeding 
to 
ask 
the 
reason 
of 
the 
connexion 
or 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
thing, 
then 
we 
are 
asking 
what 
the 
‘middle’ 
is. 


(By 
distinguishing 
the 
fact 
of 
the 
connexion 
and 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
thing 
as 
respectively 
the 
partial 
and 
the 
unqualified 
being 
of 
the 
thing, 
I 
mean 
that 
if 
we 
ask 
‘does 
the 
moon 
suffer 
eclipse?’, 
or 
‘does 
the 
moon 
wax?’, 
the 
question 
concerns 
a 
part 
of 
the 
thing’s 
being; 
for 
what 
we 
are 
asking 
in 
such 
questions 
is 
whether 
a 
thing 
is 
this 
or 
that, 
i.e. 
has 
or 
has 
not 
this 
or 
that 
attribute: 
whereas, 
if 
we 
ask 
whether 
the 
moon 
or 
night 
exists, 
the 
question 
concerns 
the 
unqualified 
being 
of 
a 
thing.) 


We 
conclude 
that 
in 
all 
our 
inquiries 
we 
are 
asking 
either 
whether 
there 
is 
a 
‘middle’ 
or 
what 
the 
‘middle’ 
is: 
for 
the 
‘middle’ 
here 
is 
precisely 
the 
cause, 
and 
it 
is 
the 
cause 
that 
we 
seek 
in 
all 
our 
inquiries. 
Thus, 
‘Does 
the 
moon 
suffer 
eclipse?’ 
means 
‘Is 
there 
or 
is 
there 
not 
a 
cause 
producing 
eclipse 
of 
the 
moon?’, 
and 
when 
we 
have 
learnt 
that 
there 
is, 
our 
next 
question 
is, 
‘What, 
then, 
is 
this 
cause? 
for 
the 
cause 
through 
which 
a 
thing 
is-not 
is 
this 
or 
that, 
i.e. 
has 
this 
or 
that 
attribute, 
but 
without 
qualification 
is-and 
the 
cause 
through 
which 
it 
is-not 
is 
without 
qualification, 
but 
is 
this 
or 
that 
as 
having 
some 
essential 
attribute 
or 
some 
accident-are 
both 
alike 
the 
middle’. 
By 
that 
which 
is 
without 
qualification 
I 
mean 
the 
subject, 
e.g. 
moon 
or 
earth 
or 
sun 
or 
triangle; 
by 
that 
which 
a 
subject 
is 
(in 
the 
partial 
sense) 
I 
mean 
a 
property, 


e.g. 
eclipse, 
equality 
or 
inequality, 
interposition 
or 
non-interposition. 
For 
in 
all 
these 
examples 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
thing 
and 
the 
reason 
of 
the 
fact 
are 
identical: 
the 
question 
‘What 
is 
eclipse?’ 
and 
its 
answer 
‘The 
privation 
of 
the 
moon’s 
light 
by 
the 
interposition 
of 
the 
earth’ 
are 
identical 
with 
the 
question 
‘What 
is 
the 
reason 
of 
eclipse?’ 
or 
‘Why 
does 
the 
moon 
suffer 
eclipse?’ 
and 
the 
reply 
‘Because 
of 
the 
failure 
of 
light 
through 
the 
earth’s 
shutting 
it 
out’. 
Again, 
for 
‘What 
is 
a 
concord? 
A 
commensurate 
numerical 
ratio 
of 
a 
high 
and 
a 
low 
note’, 
we 
may 
substitute 
‘What 
ratio 
makes 
a 
high 
and 
a 
low 
note 
concordant? 
Their 
relation 
according 
to 
a 
commensurate 
numerical 
ratio.’ 
‘Are 
the 
high 
and 
the 
low 
note 
concordant?’ 
is 
equivalent 
to 
‘Is 
their 
ratio 
commensurate?’; 
and 
when 
we 
find 
that 
it 
is 
commensurate, 
we 
ask 
‘What, 
then, 
is 
their 
ratio?’. 
Cases 
in 
which 
the 
‘middle’ 
is 
sensible 
show 
that 
the 
object 
of 
our 
inquiry 
is 
always 
the 
‘middle’: 
we 
inquire, 
because 
we 
have 
not 
perceived 
it, 
whether 



there 
is 
or 
is 
not 
a 
‘middle’ 
causing, 
e.g. 
an 
eclipse. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
if 
we 
were 
on 
the 
moon 
we 
should 
not 
be 
inquiring 
either 
as 
to 
the 
fact 
or 
the 
reason, 
but 
both 
fact 
and 
reason 
would 
be 
obvious 
simultaneously. 
For 
the 
act 
of 
perception 
would 
have 
enabled 
us 
to 
know 
the 
universal 
too; 
since, 
the 
present 
fact 
of 
an 
eclipse 
being 
evident, 
perception 
would 
then 
at 
the 
same 
time 
give 
us 
the 
present 
fact 
of 
the 
earth’s 
screening 
the 
sun’s 
light, 
and 
from 
this 
would 
arise 
the 
universal. 


Thus, 
as 
we 
maintain, 
to 
know 
a 
thing’s 
nature 
is 
to 
know 
the 
reason 
why 
it 
is; 
and 
this 
is 
equally 
true 
of 
things 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
are 
said 
without 
qualification 
to 
he 
as 
opposed 
to 
being 
possessed 
of 
some 
attribute, 
and 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
are 
said 
to 
be 
possessed 
of 
some 
attribute 
such 
as 
equal 
to 
right 
angles, 
or 
greater 
or 
less. 


It 
is 
clear, 
then, 
that 
all 
questions 
are 
a 
search 
for 
a 
‘middle’. 
Let 
us 
now 
state 
how 
essential 
nature 
is 
revealed 
and 
in 
what 
way 
it 
can 
be 
reduced 
to 
demonstration; 
what 
definition 
is, 
and 
what 
things 
are 
definable. 
And 
let 
us 
first 
discuss 
certain 
difficulties 
which 
these 
questions 
raise, 
beginning 
what 
we 
have 
to 
say 
with 
a 
point 
most 
intimately 
connected 
with 
our 
immediately 
preceding 
remarks, 
namely 
the 
doubt 
that 
might 
be 
felt 
as 
to 
whether 
or 
not 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
know 
the 
same 
thing 
in 
the 
same 
relation, 
both 
by 
definition 
and 
by 
demonstration. 
It 
might, 
I 
mean, 
be 
urged 
that 
definition 
is 
held 
to 
concern 
essential 
nature 
and 
is 
in 
every 
case 
universal 
and 
affirmative; 
whereas, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
some 
conclusions 
are 
negative 
and 
some 
are 
not 
universal; 
e.g. 
all 
in 
the 
second 
figure 
are 
negative, 
none 
in 
the 
third 
are 
universal. 
And 
again, 
not 
even 
all 
affirmative 
conclusions 
in 
the 
first 
figure 
are 
definable, 
e.g. 
‘every 
triangle 
has 
its 
angles 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles’. 
An 
argument 
proving 
this 
difference 
between 
demonstration 
and 
definition 
is 
that 
to 
have 
scientific 
knowledge 
of 
the 
demonstrable 
is 
identical 
with 
possessing 
a 
demonstration 
of 
it: 
hence 
if 
demonstration 
of 
such 
conclusions 
as 
these 
is 
possible, 
there 
clearly 
cannot 
also 
be 
definition 
of 
them. 
If 
there 
could, 
one 
might 
know 
such 
a 
conclusion 
also 
in 
virtue 
of 
its 
definition 
without 
possessing 
the 
demonstration 
of 
it; 
for 
there 
is 
nothing 
to 
stop 
our 
having 
the 
one 
without 
the 
other. 


Induction 
too 
will 
sufficiently 
convince 
us 
of 
this 
difference; 
for 
never 
yet 
by 
defining 
anything-essential 
attribute 
or 
accident-did 
we 
get 
knowledge 
of 



it. 
Again, 
if 
to 
define 
is 
to 
acquire 
knowledge 
of 
a 
substance, 
at 
any 
rate 
such 
attributes 
are 
not 
substances. 


It 
is 
evident, 
then, 
that 
not 
everything 
demonstrable 
can 
be 
defined. 
What 
then? 
Can 
everything 
definable 
be 
demonstrated, 
or 
not? 
There 
is 
one 
of 
our 
previous 
arguments 
which 
covers 
this 
too. 
Of 
a 
single 
thing 
qua 
single 
there 
is 
a 
single 
scientific 
knowledge. 
Hence, 
since 
to 
know 
the 
demonstrable 
scientifically 
is 
to 
possess 
the 
demonstration 
of 
it, 
an 
impossible 
consequence 
will 
follow:-possession 
of 
its 
definition 
without 
its 
demonstration 
will 
give 
knowledge 
of 
the 
demonstrable. 


Moreover, 
the 
basic 
premisses 
of 
demonstrations 
are 
definitions, 
and 
it 
has 
already 
been 
shown 
that 
these 
will 
be 
found 
indemonstrable; 
either 
the 
basic 
premisses 
will 
be 
demonstrable 
and 
will 
depend 
on 
prior 
premisses, 
and 
the 
regress 
will 
be 
endless; 
or 
the 
primary 
truths 
will 
be 
indemonstrable 
definitions. 


But 
if 
the 
definable 
and 
the 
demonstrable 
are 
not 
wholly 
the 
same, 
may 
they 
yet 
be 
partially 
the 
same? 
Or 
is 
that 
impossible, 
because 
there 
can 
be 
no 
demonstration 
of 
the 
definable? 
There 
can 
be 
none, 
because 
definition 
is 
of 
the 
essential 
nature 
or 
being 
of 
something, 
and 
all 
demonstrations 
evidently 
posit 
and 
assume 
the 
essential 
nature-mathematical 
demonstrations, 
for 
example, 
the 
nature 
of 
unity 
and 
the 
odd, 
and 
all 
the 
other 
sciences 
likewise. 
Moreover, 
every 
demonstration 
proves 
a 
predicate 
of 
a 
subject 
as 
attaching 
or 
as 
not 
attaching 
to 
it, 
but 
in 
definition 
one 
thing 
is 
not 
predicated 
of 
another; 
we 
do 
not, 
e.g. 
predicate 
animal 
of 
biped 
nor 
biped 
of 
animal, 
nor 
yet 
figure 
of 
plane-plane 
not 
being 
figure 
nor 
figure 
plane. 
Again, 
to 
prove 
essential 
nature 
is 
not 
the 
same 
as 
to 
prove 
the 
fact 
of 
a 
connexion. 
Now 
definition 
reveals 
essential 
nature, 
demonstration 
reveals 
that 
a 
given 
attribute 
attaches 
or 
does 
not 
attach 
to 
a 
given 
subject; 
but 
different 
things 
require 
different 
demonstrations-unless 
the 
one 
demonstration 
is 
related 
to 
the 
other 
as 
part 
to 
whole. 
I 
add 
this 
because 
if 
all 
triangles 
have 
been 
proved 
to 
possess 
angles 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles, 
then 
this 
attribute 
has 
been 
proved 
to 
attach 
to 
isosceles; 
for 
isosceles 
is 
a 
part 
of 
which 
all 
triangles 
constitute 
the 
whole. 
But 
in 
the 
case 
before 
us 
the 
fact 
and 
the 
essential 
nature 
are 
not 
so 
related 
to 
one 
another, 
since 
the 
one 
is 
not 
a 
part 
of 
the 
other. 


So 
it 
emerges 
that 
not 
all 
the 
definable 
is 
demonstrable 
nor 
all 
the 
demonstrable 
definable; 
and 
we 
may 
draw 
the 
general 
conclusion 
that 
there 
is 
no 
identical 
object 
of 
which 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
possess 
both 
a 
definition 
and 
a 
demonstration. 
It 
follows 
obviously 
that 
definition 
and 
demonstration 
are 



neither 
identical 
nor 
contained 
either 
within 
the 
other: 
if 
they 
were, 
their 
objects 
would 
be 
related 
either 
as 
identical 
or 
as 
whole 
and 
part. 


So 
much, 
then, 
for 
the 
first 
stage 
of 
our 
problem. 
The 
next 
step 
is 
to 
raise 
the 
question 
whether 
syllogism-i.e. 
demonstration-of 
the 
definable 
nature 
is 
possible 
or, 
as 
our 
recent 
argument 
assumed, 
impossible. 


We 
might 
argue 
it 
impossible 
on 
the 
following 
grounds:-(a) 
syllogism 
proves 
an 
attribute 
of 
a 
subject 
through 
the 
middle 
term; 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
(b) 
its 
definable 
nature 
is 
both 
‘peculiar’ 
to 
a 
subject 
and 
predicated 
of 
it 
as 
belonging 
to 
its 
essence. 
But 
in 
that 
case 
(1) 
the 
subject, 
its 
definition, 
and 
the 
middle 
term 
connecting 
them 
must 
be 
reciprocally 
predicable 
of 
one 
another; 
for 
if 
A 
is 
to 
C, 
obviously 
A 
is 
‘peculiar’ 
to 
B 
and 
B 
to 
C-in 
fact 
all 
three 
terms 
are 
‘peculiar’ 
to 
one 
another: 
and 
further 
(2) 
if 
A 
inheres 
in 
the 
essence 
of 
all 
B 
and 
B 
is 
predicated 
universally 
of 
all 
C 
as 
belonging 
to 
C’s 
essence, 
A 
also 
must 
be 
predicated 
of 
C 
as 
belonging 
to 
its 
essence. 


If 
one 
does 
not 
take 
this 
relation 
as 
thus 
duplicated-if, 
that 
is, 
A 
is 
predicated 
as 
being 
of 
the 
essence 
of 
B, 
but 
B 
is 
not 
of 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
subjects 
of 
which 
it 
is 
predicated-A 
will 
not 
necessarily 
be 
predicated 
of 
C 
as 
belonging 
to 
its 
essence. 
So 
both 
premisses 
will 
predicate 
essence, 
and 
consequently 
B 
also 
will 
be 
predicated 
of 
C 
as 
its 
essence. 
Since, 
therefore, 
both 
premisses 
do 
predicate 
essence-i.e. 
definable 
form-C’s 
definable 
form 
will 
appear 
in 
the 
middle 
term 
before 
the 
conclusion 
is 
drawn. 


We 
may 
generalize 
by 
supposing 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
prove 
the 
essential 
nature 
of 
man. 
Let 
C 
be 
man, 
A 
man’s 
essential 
nature—two-footed 
animal, 
or 
aught 
else 
it 
may 
be. 
Then, 
if 
we 
are 
to 
syllogize, 
A 
must 
be 
predicated 
of 
all 
B. 
But 
this 
premiss 
will 
be 
mediated 
by 
a 
fresh 
definition, 
which 
consequently 
will 
also 
be 
the 
essential 
nature 
of 
man. 
Therefore 
the 
argument 
assumes 
what 
it 
has 
to 
prove, 
since 
B 
too 
is 
the 
essential 
nature 
of 
man. 
It 
is, 
however, 
the 
case 
in 
which 
there 
are 
only 
the 
two 
premisses-i.e. 
in 
which 
the 
premisses 
are 
primary 
and 
immediate-which 
we 
ought 
to 
investigate, 
because 
it 
best 
illustrates 
the 
point 
under 
discussion. 


Thus 
they 
who 
prove 
the 
essential 
nature 
of 
soul 
or 
man 
or 
anything 
else 
through 
reciprocating 
terms 
beg 
the 
question. 
It 
would 
be 
begging 
the 
question, 
for 
example, 
to 
contend 
that 
the 
soul 
is 
that 
which 
causes 
its 
own 
life, 
and 
that 
what 
causes 
its 
own 
life 
is 
a 
self-moving 
number; 
for 
one 
would 



have 
to 
postulate 
that 
the 
soul 
is 
a 
self-moving 
number 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
being 
identical 
with 
it. 
For 
if 
A 
is 
predicable 
as 
a 
mere 
consequent 
of 
B 
and 
B 
of 
C, 
A 
will 
not 
on 
that 
account 
be 
the 
definable 
form 
of 
C: 
A 
will 
merely 
be 
what 
it 
was 
true 
to 
say 
of 
C. 
Even 
if 
A 
is 
predicated 
of 
all 
B 
inasmuch 
as 
B 
is 
identical 
with 
a 
species 
of 
A, 
still 
it 
will 
not 
follow: 
being 
an 
animal 
is 
predicated 
of 
being 
a 
man-since 
it 
is 
true 
that 
in 
all 
instances 
to 
be 
human 
is 
to 
be 
animal, 
just 
as 
it 
is 
also 
true 
that 
every 
man 
is 
an 
animal-but 
not 
as 
identical 
with 
being 
man. 


We 
conclude, 
then, 
that 
unless 
one 
takes 
both 
the 
premisses 
as 
predicating 
essence, 
one 
cannot 
infer 
that 
A 
is 
the 
definable 
form 
and 
essence 
of 
C: 
but 
if 
one 
does 
so 
take 
them, 
in 
assuming 
B 
one 
will 
have 
assumed, 
before 
drawing 
the 
conclusion, 
what 
the 
definable 
form 
of 
C 
is; 
so 
that 
there 
has 
been 
no 
inference, 
for 
one 
has 
begged 
the 
question. 


Nor, 
as 
was 
said 
in 
my 
formal 
logic, 
is 
the 
method 
of 
division 
a 
process 
of 
inference 
at 
all, 
since 
at 
no 
point 
does 
the 
characterization 
of 
the 
subject 
follow 
necessarily 
from 
the 
premising 
of 
certain 
other 
facts: 
division 
demonstrates 
as 
little 
as 
does 
induction. 
For 
in 
a 
genuine 
demonstration 
the 
conclusion 
must 
not 
be 
put 
as 
a 
question 
nor 
depend 
on 
a 
concession, 
but 
must 
follow 
necessarily 
from 
its 
premisses, 
even 
if 
the 
respondent 
deny 
it. 
The 
definer 
asks 
‘Is 
man 
animal 
or 
inanimate?’ 
and 
then 
assumes-he 
has 
not 
inferred-that 
man 
is 
animal. 
Next, 
when 
presented 
with 
an 
exhaustive 
division 
of 
animal 
into 
terrestrial 
and 
aquatic, 
he 
assumes 
that 
man 
is 
terrestrial. 
Moreover, 
that 
man 
is 
the 
complete 
formula, 
terrestrial-animal, 
does 
not 
follow 
necessarily 
from 
the 
premisses: 
this 
too 
is 
an 
assumption, 
and 
equally 
an 
assumption 
whether 
the 
division 
comprises 
many 
differentiae 
or 
few. 
(Indeed 
as 
this 
method 
of 
division 
is 
used 
by 
those 
who 
proceed 
by 
it, 
even 
truths 
that 
can 
be 
inferred 
actually 
fail 
to 
appear 
as 
such.) 
For 
why 
should 
not 
the 
whole 
of 
this 
formula 
be 
true 
of 
man, 
and 
yet 
not 
exhibit 
his 
essential 
nature 
or 
definable 
form? 
Again, 
what 
guarantee 
is 
there 
against 
an 
unessential 
addition, 
or 
against 
the 
omission 
of 
the 
final 
or 
of 
an 
intermediate 
determinant 
of 
the 
substantial 
being? 


The 
champion 
of 
division 
might 
here 
urge 
that 
though 
these 
lapses 
do 
occur, 
yet 
we 
can 
solve 
that 
difficulty 
if 
all 
the 
attributes 
we 
assume 
are 
constituents 
of 
the 
definable 
form, 
and 
if, 
postulating 
the 
genus, 
we 
produce 



by 
division 
the 
requisite 
uninterrupted 
sequence 
of 
terms, 
and 
omit 
nothing; 
and 
that 
indeed 
we 
cannot 
fail 
to 
fulfil 
these 
conditions 
if 
what 
is 
to 
be 
divided 
falls 
whole 
into 
the 
division 
at 
each 
stage, 
and 
none 
of 
it 
is 
omitted; 
and 
that 
this-the 
dividendum-must 
without 
further 
question 
be 
(ultimately) 
incapable 
of 
fresh 
specific 
division. 
Nevertheless, 
we 
reply, 
division 
does 
not 
involve 
inference; 
if 
it 
gives 
knowledge, 
it 
gives 
it 
in 
another 
way. 
Nor 
is 
there 
any 
absurdity 
in 
this: 
induction, 
perhaps, 
is 
not 
demonstration 
any 
more 
than 
is 
division, 
et 
it 
does 
make 
evident 
some 
truth. 
Yet 
to 
state 
a 
definition 
reached 
by 
division 
is 
not 
to 
state 
a 
conclusion: 
as, 
when 
conclusions 
are 
drawn 
without 
their 
appropriate 
middles, 
the 
alleged 
necessity 
by 
which 
the 
inference 
follows 
from 
the 
premisses 
is 
open 
to 
a 
question 
as 
to 
the 
reason 
for 
it, 
so 
definitions 
reached 
by 
division 
invite 
the 
same 
question. 


Thus 
to 
the 
question 
‘What 
is 
the 
essential 
nature 
of 
man?’ 
the 
divider 
replies 
‘Animal, 
mortal, 
footed, 
biped, 
wingless’; 
and 
when 
at 
each 
step 
he 
is 
asked 
‘Why?’, 
he 
will 
say, 
and, 
as 
he 
thinks, 
proves 
by 
division, 
that 
all 
animal 
is 
mortal 
or 
immortal: 
but 
such 
a 
formula 
taken 
in 
its 
entirety 
is 
not 
definition; 
so 
that 
even 
if 
division 
does 
demonstrate 
its 
formula, 
definition 
at 
any 
rate 
does 
not 
turn 
out 
to 
be 
a 
conclusion 
of 
inference. 


Can 
we 
nevertheless 
actually 
demonstrate 
what 
a 
thing 
essentially 
and 
substantially 
is, 
but 
hypothetically, 
i.e. 
by 
premising 
(1) 
that 
its 
definable 
form 
is 
constituted 
by 
the 
‘peculiar’ 
attributes 
of 
its 
essential 
nature; 
(2) 
that 
such 
and 
such 
are 
the 
only 
attributes 
of 
its 
essential 
nature, 
and 
that 
the 
complete 
synthesis 
of 
them 
is 
peculiar 
to 
the 
thing; 
and 
thus-since 
in 
this 
synthesis 
consists 
the 
being 
of 
the 
thing-obtaining 
our 
conclusion? 
Or 
is 
the 
truth 
that, 
since 
proof 
must 
be 
through 
the 
middle 
term, 
the 
definable 
form 
is 
once 
more 
assumed 
in 
this 
minor 
premiss 
too? 


Further, 
just 
as 
in 
syllogizing 
we 
do 
not 
premise 
what 
syllogistic 
inference 
is 
(since 
the 
premisses 
from 
which 
we 
conclude 
must 
be 
related 
as 
whole 
and 
part), 
so 
the 
definable 
form 
must 
not 
fall 
within 
the 
syllogism 
but 
remain 
outside 
the 
premisses 
posited. 
It 
is 
only 
against 
a 
doubt 
as 
to 
its 
having 
been 
a 
syllogistic 
inference 
at 
all 
that 
we 
have 
to 
defend 
our 
argument 
as 
conforming 
to 
the 
definition 
of 
syllogism. 
It 
is 
only 
when 
some 
one 
doubts 
whether 
the 
conclusion 
proved 
is 
the 
definable 
form 
that 
we 
have 
to 
defend 
it 
as 
conforming 
to 
the 
definition 
of 
definable 
form 
which 
we 
assumed. 
Hence 



syllogistic 
inference 
must 
be 
possible 
even 
without 
the 
express 
statement 
of 
what 
syllogism 
is 
or 
what 
definable 
form 
is. 


The 
following 
type 
of 
hypothetical 
proof 
also 
begs 
the 
question. 
If 
evil 
is 
definable 
as 
the 
divisible, 
and 
the 
definition 
of 
a 
thing’s 
contrary-if 
it 
has 
one 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
thing’s 
definition; 
then, 
if 
good 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
evil 
and 
the 
indivisible 
of 
the 
divisible, 
we 
conclude 
that 
to 
be 
good 
is 
essentially 
to 
be 
indivisible. 
The 
question 
is 
begged 
because 
definable 
form 
is 
assumed 
as 
a 
premiss, 
and 
as 
a 
premiss 
which 
is 
to 
prove 
definable 
form. 
‘But 
not 
the 
same 
definable 
form’, 
you 
may 
object. 
That 
I 
admit, 
for 
in 
demonstrations 
also 
we 
premise 
that 
‘this’ 
is 
predicable 
of 
‘that’; 
but 
in 
this 
premiss 
the 
term 
we 
assert 
of 
the 
minor 
is 
neither 
the 
major 
itself 
nor 
a 
term 
identical 
in 
definition, 
or 
convertible, 
with 
the 
major. 


Again, 
both 
proof 
by 
division 
and 
the 
syllogism 
just 
described 
are 
open 
to 
the 
question 
why 
man 
should 
be 
animal-biped-terrestrial 
and 
not 
merely 
animal 
and 
terrestrial, 
since 
what 
they 
premise 
does 
not 
ensure 
that 
the 
predicates 
shall 
constitute 
a 
genuine 
unity 
and 
not 
merely 
belong 
to 
a 
single 
subject 
as 
do 
musical 
and 
grammatical 
when 
predicated 
of 
the 
same 
man. 


How 
then 
by 
definition 
shall 
we 
prove 
substance 
or 
essential 
nature? 
We 
cannot 
show 
it 
as 
a 
fresh 
fact 
necessarily 
following 
from 
the 
assumption 
of 
premisses 
admitted 
to 
be 
facts-the 
method 
of 
demonstration: 
we 
may 
not 
proceed 
as 
by 
induction 
to 
establish 
a 
universal 
on 
the 
evidence 
of 
groups 
of 
particulars 
which 
offer 
no 
exception, 
because 
induction 
proves 
not 
what 
the 
essential 
nature 
of 
a 
thing 
is 
but 
that 
it 
has 
or 
has 
not 
some 
attribute. 
Therefore, 
since 
presumably 
one 
cannot 
prove 
essential 
nature 
by 
an 
appeal 
to 
sense 
perception 
or 
by 
pointing 
with 
the 
finger, 
what 
other 
method 
remains? 


To 
put 
it 
another 
way: 
how 
shall 
we 
by 
definition 
prove 
essential 
nature? 
He 
who 
knows 
what 
human-or 
any 
other-nature 
is, 
must 
know 
also 
that 
man 
exists; 
for 
no 
one 
knows 
the 
nature 
of 
what 
does 
not 
exist-one 
can 
know 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
phrase 
or 
name 
‘goat-stag’ 
but 
not 
what 
the 
essential 
nature 
of 
a 
goat-stag 
is. 
But 
further, 
if 
definition 
can 
prove 
what 
is 
the 
essential 
nature 
of 
a 
thing, 
can 
it 
also 
prove 
that 
it 
exists? 
And 
how 
will 
it 
prove 
them 
both 
by 
the 
same 
process, 
since 
definition 
exhibits 
one 
single 
thing 
and 
demonstration 
another 
single 
thing, 
and 
what 
human 
nature 
is 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
man 
exists 



are 
not 
the 
same 
thing? 
Then 
too 
we 
hold 
that 
it 
is 
by 
demonstration 
that 
the 
being 
of 
everything 
must 
be 
proved-unless 
indeed 
to 
be 
were 
its 
essence; 
and, 
since 
being 
is 
not 
a 
genus, 
it 
is 
not 
the 
essence 
of 
anything. 
Hence 
the 
being 
of 
anything 
as 
fact 
is 
matter 
for 
demonstration; 
and 
this 
is 
the 
actual 
procedure 
of 
the 
sciences, 
for 
the 
geometer 
assumes 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
word 
triangle, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
possessed 
of 
some 
attribute 
he 
proves. 
What 
is 
it, 
then, 
that 
we 
shall 
prove 
in 
defining 
essential 
nature? 
Triangle? 
In 
that 
case 
a 
man 
will 
know 
by 
definition 
what 
a 
thing’s 
nature 
is 
without 
knowing 
whether 
it 
exists. 
But 
that 
is 
impossible. 


Moreover 
it 
is 
clear, 
if 
we 
consider 
the 
methods 
of 
defining 
actually 
in 
use, 
that 
definition 
does 
not 
prove 
that 
the 
thing 
defined 
exists: 
since 
even 
if 
there 
does 
actually 
exist 
something 
which 
is 
equidistant 
from 
a 
centre, 
yet 
why 
should 
the 
thing 
named 
in 
the 
definition 
exist? 
Why, 
in 
other 
words, 
should 
this 
be 
the 
formula 
defining 
circle? 
One 
might 
equally 
well 
call 
it 
the 
definition 
of 
mountain 
copper. 
For 
definitions 
do 
not 
carry 
a 
further 
guarantee 
that 
the 
thing 
defined 
can 
exist 
or 
that 
it 
is 
what 
they 
claim 
to 
define: 
one 
can 
always 
ask 
why. 


Since, 
therefore, 
to 
define 
is 
to 
prove 
either 
a 
thing’s 
essential 
nature 
or 
the 
meaning 
of 
its 
name, 
we 
may 
conclude 
that 
definition, 
if 
it 
in 
no 
sense 
proves 
essential 
nature, 
is 
a 
set 
of 
words 
signifying 
precisely 
what 
a 
name 
signifies. 
But 
that 
were 
a 
strange 
consequence; 
for 
(1) 
both 
what 
is 
not 
substance 
and 
what 
does 
not 
exist 
at 
all 
would 
be 
definable, 
since 
even 
non-existents 
can 
be 
signified 
by 
a 
name: 
(2) 
all 
sets 
of 
words 
or 
sentences 
would 
be 
definitions, 
since 
any 
kind 
of 
sentence 
could 
be 
given 
a 
name; 
so 
that 
we 
should 
all 
be 
talking 
in 
definitions, 
and 
even 
the 
Iliad 
would 
be 
a 
definition: 
(3) 
no 
demonstration 
can 
prove 
that 
any 
particular 
name 
means 
any 
particular 
thing: 
neither, 
therefore, 
do 
definitions, 
in 
addition 
to 
revealing 
the 
meaning 
of 
a 
name, 
also 
reveal 
that 
the 
name 
has 
this 
meaning. 
It 
appears 
then 
from 
these 
considerations 
that 
neither 
definition 
and 
syllogism 
nor 
their 
objects 
are 
identical, 
and 
further 
that 
definition 
neither 
demonstrates 
nor 
proves 
anything, 
and 
that 
knowledge 
of 
essential 
nature 
is 
not 
to 
be 
obtained 
either 
by 
definition 
or 
by 
demonstration. 


We 
must 
now 
start 
afresh 
and 
consider 
which 
of 
these 
conclusions 
are 
sound 
and 
which 
are 
not, 
and 
what 
is 
the 
nature 
of 
definition, 
and 
whether 



essential 
nature 
is 
in 
any 
sense 
demonstrable 
and 
definable 
or 
in 
none. 


Now 
to 
know 
its 
essential 
nature 
is, 
as 
we 
said, 
the 
same 
as 
to 
know 
the 
cause 
of 
a 
thing’s 
existence, 
and 
the 
proof 
of 
this 
depends 
on 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
thing 
must 
have 
a 
cause. 
Moreover, 
this 
cause 
is 
either 
identical 
with 
the 
essential 
nature 
of 
the 
thing 
or 
distinct 
from 
it; 
and 
if 
its 
cause 
is 
distinct 
from 
it, 
the 
essential 
nature 
of 
the 
thing 
is 
either 
demonstrable 
or 
indemonstrable. 
Consequently, 
if 
the 
cause 
is 
distinct 
from 
the 
thing’s 
essential 
nature 
and 
demonstration 
is 
possible, 
the 
cause 
must 
be 
the 
middle 
term, 
and, 
the 
conclusion 
proved 
being 
universal 
and 
affirmative, 
the 
proof 
is 
in 
the 
first 
figure. 
So 
the 
method 
just 
examined 
of 
proving 
it 
through 
another 
essential 
nature 
would 
be 
one 
way 
of 
proving 
essential 
nature, 
because 
a 
conclusion 
containing 
essential 
nature 
must 
be 
inferred 
through 
a 
middle 
which 
is 
an 
essential 
nature 
just 
as 
a 
‘peculiar’ 
property 
must 
be 
inferred 
through 
a 
middle 
which 
is 
a 
‘peculiar’ 
property; 
so 
that 
of 
the 
two 
definable 
natures 
of 
a 
single 
thing 
this 
method 
will 
prove 
one 
and 
not 
the 
other. 


Now 
it 
was 
said 
before 
that 
this 
method 
could 
not 
amount 
to 
demonstration 
of 
essential 
nature-it 
is 
actually 
a 
dialectical 
proof 
of 
it-so 
let 
us 
begin 
again 
and 
explain 
by 
what 
method 
it 
can 
be 
demonstrated. 
When 
we 
are 
aware 
of 
a 
fact 
we 
seek 
its 
reason, 
and 
though 
sometimes 
the 
fact 
and 
the 
reason 
dawn 
on 
us 
simultaneously, 
yet 
we 
cannot 
apprehend 
the 
reason 
a 
moment 
sooner 
than 
the 
fact; 
and 
clearly 
in 
just 
the 
same 
way 
we 
cannot 
apprehend 
a 
thing’s 
definable 
form 
without 
apprehending 
that 
it 
exists, 
since 
while 
we 
are 
ignorant 
whether 
it 
exists 
we 
cannot 
know 
its 
essential 
nature. 
Moreover 
we 
are 
aware 
whether 
a 
thing 
exists 
or 
not 
sometimes 
through 
apprehending 
an 
element 
in 
its 
character, 
and 
sometimes 
accidentally, 
as, 
for 
example, 
when 
we 
are 
aware 
of 
thunder 
as 
a 
noise 
in 
the 
clouds, 
of 
eclipse 
as 
a 
privation 
of 
light, 
or 
of 
man 
as 
some 
species 
of 
animal, 
or 
of 
the 
soul 
as 
a 
self-moving 
thing. 
As 
often 
as 
we 
have 
accidental 
knowledge 
that 
the 
thing 
exists, 
we 
must 
be 
in 
a 
wholly 
negative 
state 
as 
regards 
awareness 
of 
its 
essential 
nature; 
for 
we 
have 
not 
got 
genuine 
knowledge 
even 
of 
its 
existence, 
and 
to 
search 
for 
a 
thing’s 
essential 
nature 
when 
we 
are 
unaware 
that 
it 
exists 
is 
to 
search 
for 
nothing. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
whenever 
we 
apprehend 
an 
element 
in 
the 
thing’s 
character 
there 
is 
less 
difficulty. 
Thus 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
degree 
of 
our 
knowledge 
of 
a 
thing’s 
essential 
nature 
is 
determined 
by 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
we 
are 
aware 
that 
it 
exists. 
Let 
us 
then 
take 
the 
following 
as 
our 
first 
instance 
of 
being 
aware 
of 
an 
element 
in 
the 
essential 
nature. 
Let 
A 
be 
eclipse, 
C 
the 
moon, 
B 
the 
earth’s 
acting 
as 
a 
screen. 
Now 
to 
ask 
whether 
the 



moon 
is 
eclipsed 
or 
not 
is 
to 
ask 
whether 
or 
not 
B 
has 
occurred. 
But 
that 
is 
precisely 
the 
same 
as 
asking 
whether 
A 
has 
a 
defining 
condition; 
and 
if 
this 
condition 
actually 
exists, 
we 
assert 
that 
A 
also 
actually 
exists. 
Or 
again 
we 
may 
ask 
which 
side 
of 
a 
contradiction 
the 
defining 
condition 
necessitates: 
does 
it 
make 
the 
angles 
of 
a 
triangle 
equal 
or 
not 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles? 
When 
we 
have 
found 
the 
answer, 
if 
the 
premisses 
are 
immediate, 
we 
know 
fact 
and 
reason 
together; 
if 
they 
are 
not 
immediate, 
we 
know 
the 
fact 
without 
the 
reason, 
as 
in 
the 
following 
example: 
let 
C 
be 
the 
moon, 
A 
eclipse, 
B 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
moon 
fails 
to 
produce 
shadows 
though 
she 
is 
full 
and 
though 
no 
visible 
body 
intervenes 
between 
us 
and 
her. 
Then 
if 
B, 
failure 
to 
produce 
shadows 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
absence 
of 
an 
intervening 
body, 
is 
attributable 
A 
to 
C, 
and 
eclipse, 
is 
attributable 
to 
B, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
moon 
is 
eclipsed, 
but 
the 
reason 
why 
is 
not 
yet 
clear, 
and 
we 
know 
that 
eclipse 
exists, 
but 
we 
do 
not 
know 
what 
its 
essential 
nature 
is. 
But 
when 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
A 
is 
attributable 
to 
C 
and 
we 
proceed 
to 
ask 
the 
reason 
of 
this 
fact, 
we 
are 
inquiring 
what 
is 
the 
nature 
of 
B: 
is 
it 
the 
earth’s 
acting 
as 
a 
screen, 
or 
the 
moon’s 
rotation 
or 
her 
extinction? 
But 
B 
is 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
other 
term, 
viz. 
in 
these 
examples, 
of 
the 
major 
term 
A; 
for 
eclipse 
is 
constituted 
by 
the 
earth 
acting 
as 
a 
screen. 
Thus, 
(1) 
‘What 
is 
thunder?’ 
‘The 
quenching 
of 
fire 
in 
cloud’, 
and 
(2) 
‘Why 
does 
it 
thunder?’ 
‘Because 
fire 
is 
quenched 
in 
the 
cloud’, 
are 
equivalent. 
Let 
C 
be 
cloud, 
A 
thunder, 
B 
the 
quenching 
of 
fire. 
Then 
B 
is 
attributable 
to 
C, 
cloud, 
since 
fire 
is 
quenched 
in 
it; 
and 
A, 
noise, 
is 
attributable 
to 
B; 
and 
B 
is 
assuredly 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
major 
term 
A. 
If 
there 
be 
a 
further 
mediating 
cause 
of 
B, 
it 
will 
be 
one 
of 
the 
remaining 
partial 
definitions 
of 
A. 


We 
have 
stated 
then 
how 
essential 
nature 
is 
discovered 
and 
becomes 
known, 
and 
we 
see 
that, 
while 
there 
is 
no 
syllogism-i.e. 
no 
demonstrative 
syllogism-of 
essential 
nature, 
yet 
it 
is 
through 
syllogism, 
viz. 
demonstrative 
syllogism, 
that 
essential 
nature 
is 
exhibited. 
So 
we 
conclude 
that 
neither 
can 
the 
essential 
nature 
of 
anything 
which 
has 
a 
cause 
distinct 
from 
itself 
be 
known 
without 
demonstration, 
nor 
can 
it 
be 
demonstrated; 
and 
this 
is 
what 
we 
contended 
in 
our 
preliminary 
discussions. 


Now 
while 
some 
things 
have 
a 
cause 
distinct 
from 
themselves, 
others 
have 
not. 
Hence 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
there 
are 
essential 
natures 
which 
are 
immediate, 
that 
is 
are 
basic 
premisses; 
and 
of 
these 
not 
only 
that 
they 
are 
but 
also 
what 



they 
are 
must 
be 
assumed 
or 
revealed 
in 
some 
other 
way. 
This 
too 
is 
the 
actual 
procedure 
of 
the 
arithmetician, 
who 
assumes 
both 
the 
nature 
and 
the 
existence 
of 
unit. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
is 
possible 
(in 
the 
manner 
explained) 
to 
exhibit 
through 
demonstration 
the 
essential 
nature 
of 
things 
which 
have 
a 
‘middle’, 
i.e. 
a 
cause 
of 
their 
substantial 
being 
other 
than 
that 
being 
itself; 
but 
we 
do 
not 
thereby 
demonstrate 
it. 


Since 
definition 
is 
said 
to 
be 
the 
statement 
of 
a 
thing’s 
nature, 
obviously 
one 
kind 
of 
definition 
will 
be 
a 
statement 
of 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
name, 
or 
of 
an 
equivalent 
nominal 
formula. 
A 
definition 
in 
this 
sense 
tells 
you, 
e.g. 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
phrase 
‘triangular 
character’. 
When 
we 
are 
aware 
that 
triangle 
exists, 
we 
inquire 
the 
reason 
why 
it 
exists. 
But 
it 
is 
difficult 
thus 
to 
learn 
the 
definition 
of 
things 
the 
existence 
of 
which 
we 
do 
not 
genuinely 
know-the 
cause 
of 
this 
difficulty 
being, 
as 
we 
said 
before, 
that 
we 
only 
know 
accidentally 
whether 
or 
not 
the 
thing 
exists. 
Moreover, 
a 
statement 
may 
be 
a 
unity 
in 
either 
of 
two 
ways, 
by 
conjunction, 
like 
the 
Iliad, 
or 
because 
it 
exhibits 
a 
single 
predicate 
as 
inhering 
not 
accidentally 
in 
a 
single 
subject. 


That 
then 
is 
one 
way 
of 
defining 
definition. 
Another 
kind 
of 
definition 
is 
a 
formula 
exhibiting 
the 
cause 
of 
a 
thing’s 
existence. 
Thus 
the 
former 
signifies 
without 
proving, 
but 
the 
latter 
will 
clearly 
be 
a 
quasi-demonstration 
of 
essential 
nature, 
differing 
from 
demonstration 
in 
the 
arrangement 
of 
its 
terms. 
For 
there 
is 
a 
difference 
between 
stating 
why 
it 
thunders, 
and 
stating 
what 
is 
the 
essential 
nature 
of 
thunder; 
since 
the 
first 
statement 
will 
be 
‘Because 
fire 
is 
quenched 
in 
the 
clouds’, 
while 
the 
statement 
of 
what 
the 
nature 
of 
thunder 
is 
will 
be 
‘The 
noise 
of 
fire 
being 
quenched 
in 
the 
clouds’. 
Thus 
the 
same 
statement 
takes 
a 
different 
form: 
in 
one 
form 
it 
is 
continuous 
demonstration, 
in 
the 
other 
definition. 
Again, 
thunder 
can 
be 
defined 
as 
noise 
in 
the 
clouds, 
which 
is 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
demonstration 
embodying 
essential 
nature. 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
the 
definition 
of 
immediates 
is 
an 
indemonstrable 
positing 
of 
essential 
nature. 


We 
conclude 
then 
that 
definition 
is 
(a) 
an 
indemonstrable 
statement 
of 
essential 
nature, 
or 
(b) 
a 
syllogism 
of 
essential 
nature 
differing 
from 
demonstration 
in 
grammatical 
form, 
or 
(c) 
the 
conclusion 
of 
a 
demonstration 
giving 
essential 
nature. 


Our 
discussion 
has 
therefore 
made 
plain 
(1) 
in 
what 
sense 
and 
of 
what 



things 
the 
essential 
nature 
is 
demonstrable, 
and 
in 
what 
sense 
and 
of 
what 
things 
it 
is 
not; 
(2) 
what 
are 
the 
various 
meanings 
of 
the 
term 
definition, 
and 
in 
what 
sense 
and 
of 
what 
things 
it 
proves 
the 
essential 
nature, 
and 
in 
what 
sense 
and 
of 
what 
things 
it 
does 
not; 
(3) 
what 
is 
the 
relation 
of 
definition 
to 
demonstration, 
and 
how 
far 
the 
same 
thing 
is 
both 
definable 
and 
demonstrable 
and 
how 
far 
it 
is 
not. 


We 
think 
we 
have 
scientific 
knowledge 
when 
we 
know 
the 
cause, 
and 
there 
are 
four 
causes: 
(1) 
the 
definable 
form, 
(2) 
an 
antecedent 
which 
necessitates 
a 
consequent, 
(3) 
the 
efficient 
cause, 
(4) 
the 
final 
cause. 
Hence 
each 
of 
these 
can 
be 
the 
middle 
term 
of 
a 
proof, 
for 
(a) 
though 
the 
inference 
from 
antecedent 
to 
necessary 
consequent 
does 
not 
hold 
if 
only 
one 
premiss 
is 
assumed-two 
is 
the 
minimum-still 
when 
there 
are 
two 
it 
holds 
on 
condition 
that 
they 
have 
a 
single 
common 
middle 
term. 
So 
it 
is 
from 
the 
assumption 
of 
this 
single 
middle 
term 
that 
the 
conclusion 
follows 
necessarily. 
The 
following 
example 
will 
also 
show 
this. 
Why 
is 
the 
angle 
in 
a 
semicircle 
a 
right 
angle?or 
from 
what 
assumption 
does 
it 
follow 
that 
it 
is 
a 
right 
angle? 
Thus, 
let 
A 
be 
right 
angle, 
B 
the 
half 
of 
two 
right 
angles, 
C 
the 
angle 
in 
a 
semicircle. 
Then 
B 
is 
the 
cause 
in 
virtue 
of 
which 
A, 
right 
angle, 
is 
attributable 
to 
C, 
the 
angle 
in 
a 
semicircle, 
since 
B=A 
and 
the 
other, 
viz. 
C,=B, 
for 
C 
is 
half 
of 
two 
right 
angles. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
the 
assumption 
of 
B, 
the 
half 
of 
two 
right 
angles, 
from 
which 
it 
follows 
that 
A 
is 
attributable 
to 
C, 
i.e. 
that 
the 
angle 
in 
a 
semicircle 
is 
a 
right 
angle. 
Moreover, 
B 
is 
identical 
with 
(b) 
the 
defining 
form 
of 
A, 
since 
it 
is 
what 
A’s 
definition 
signifies. 
Moreover, 
the 
formal 
cause 
has 
already 
been 
shown 
to 
be 
the 
middle. 
(c) 
‘Why 
did 
the 
Athenians 
become 
involved 
in 
the 
Persian 
war?’ 
means 
‘What 
cause 
originated 
the 
waging 
of 
war 
against 
the 
Athenians?’ 
and 
the 
answer 
is, 
‘Because 
they 
raided 
Sardis 
with 
the 
Eretrians’, 
since 
this 
originated 
the 
war. 
Let 
A 
be 
war, 
B 
unprovoked 
raiding, 
C 
the 
Athenians. 
Then 
B, 
unprovoked 
raiding, 
is 
true 
of 
C, 
the 
Athenians, 
and 
A 
is 
true 
of 
B, 
since 
men 
make 
war 
on 
the 
unjust 
aggressor. 
So 
A, 
having 
war 
waged 
upon 
them, 
is 
true 
of 
B, 
the 
initial 
aggressors, 
and 
B 
is 
true 
of 
C, 
the 
Athenians, 
who 
were 
the 
aggressors. 
Hence 
here 
too 
the 
cause-in 
this 
case 
the 
efficient 
cause-is 
the 
middle 
term. 
(d) 
This 
is 
no 
less 
true 
where 
the 
cause 
is 
the 
final 
cause. 
E.g. 
why 
does 
one 
take 
a 
walk 
after 
supper? 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
one’s 
health. 
Why 
does 
a 
house 
exist? 
For 
the 



preservation 
of 
one’s 
goods. 
The 
end 
in 
view 
is 
in 
the 
one 
case 
health, 
in 
the 
other 
preservation. 
To 
ask 
the 
reason 
why 
one 
must 
walk 
after 
supper 
is 
precisely 
to 
ask 
to 
what 
end 
one 
must 
do 
it. 
Let 
C 
be 
walking 
after 
supper, 
B 
the 
non-regurgitation 
of 
food, 
A 
health. 
Then 
let 
walking 
after 
supper 
possess 
the 
property 
of 
preventing 
food 
from 
rising 
to 
the 
orifice 
of 
the 
stomach, 
and 
let 
this 
condition 
be 
healthy; 
since 
it 
seems 
that 
B, 
the 
non-regurgitation 
of 
food, 
is 
attributable 
to 
C, 
taking 
a 
walk, 
and 
that 
A, 
health, 
is 
attributable 
to 


B. 
What, 
then, 
is 
the 
cause 
through 
which 
A, 
the 
final 
cause, 
inheres 
in 
C? 
It 
is 
B, 
the 
non-regurgitation 
of 
food; 
but 
B 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
definition 
of 
A, 
for 
A 
will 
be 
explained 
by 
it. 
Why 
is 
B 
the 
cause 
of 
A’s 
belonging 
to 
C? 
Because 
to 
be 
in 
a 
condition 
such 
as 
B 
is 
to 
be 
in 
health. 
The 
definitions 
must 
be 
transposed, 
and 
then 
the 
detail 
will 
become 
clearer. 
Incidentally, 
here 
the 
order 
of 
coming 
to 
be 
is 
the 
reverse 
of 
what 
it 
is 
in 
proof 
through 
the 
efficient 
cause: 
in 
the 
efficient 
order 
the 
middle 
term 
must 
come 
to 
be 
first, 
whereas 
in 
the 
teleological 
order 
the 
minor, 
C, 
must 
first 
take 
place, 
and 
the 
end 
in 
view 
comes 
last 
in 
time. 
The 
same 
thing 
may 
exist 
for 
an 
end 
and 
be 
necessitated 
as 
well. 
For 
example, 
light 
shines 
through 
a 
lantern 
(1) 
because 
that 
which 
consists 
of 
relatively 
small 
particles 
necessarily 
passes 
through 
pores 
larger 
than 
those 
particles-assuming 
that 
light 
does 
issue 
by 
penetrationand 
(2) 
for 
an 
end, 
namely 
to 
save 
us 
from 
stumbling. 
If 
then, 
a 
thing 
can 
exist 
through 
two 
causes, 
can 
it 
come 
to 
be 
through 
two 
causes-as 
for 
instance 
if 
thunder 
be 
a 
hiss 
and 
a 
roar 
necessarily 
produced 
by 
the 
quenching 
of 
fire, 
and 
also 
designed, 
as 
the 
Pythagoreans 
say, 
for 
a 
threat 
to 
terrify 
those 
that 
lie 
in 
Tartarus? 
Indeed, 
there 
are 
very 
many 
such 
cases, 
mostly 
among 
the 
processes 
and 
products 
of 
the 
natural 
world; 
for 
nature, 
in 
different 
senses 
of 
the 
term 
‘nature’, 
produces 
now 
for 
an 
end, 
now 
by 
necessity. 


Necessity 
too 
is 
of 
two 
kinds. 
It 
may 
work 
in 
accordance 
with 
a 
thing’s 
natural 
tendency, 
or 
by 
constraint 
and 
in 
opposition 
to 
it; 
as, 
for 
instance, 
by 
necessity 
a 
stone 
is 
borne 
both 
upwards 
and 
downwards, 
but 
not 
by 
the 
same 
necessity. 


Of 
the 
products 
of 
man’s 
intelligence 
some 
are 
never 
due 
to 
chance 
or 
necessity 
but 
always 
to 
an 
end, 
as 
for 
example 
a 
house 
or 
a 
statue; 
others, 
such 
as 
health 
or 
safety, 
may 
result 
from 
chance 
as 
well. 


It 
is 
mostly 
in 
cases 
where 
the 
issue 
is 
indeterminate 
(though 
only 
where 
the 
production 
does 
not 
originate 
in 
chance, 
and 
the 
end 
is 
consequently 
good), 
that 
a 
result 
is 
due 
to 
an 
end, 
and 
this 
is 
true 
alike 
in 
nature 
or 
in 
art. 



By 
chance, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
nothing 
comes 
to 
be 
for 
an 
end. 


The 
effect 
may 
be 
still 
coming 
to 
be, 
or 
its 
occurrence 
may 
be 
past 
or 
future, 
yet 
the 
cause 
will 
be 
the 
same 
as 
when 
it 
is 
actually 
existent-for 
it 
is 
the 
middle 
which 
is 
the 
cause-except 
that 
if 
the 
effect 
actually 
exists 
the 
cause 
is 
actually 
existent, 
if 
it 
is 
coming 
to 
be 
so 
is 
the 
cause, 
if 
its 
occurrence 
is 
past 
the 
cause 
is 
past, 
if 
future 
the 
cause 
is 
future. 
For 
example, 
the 
moon 
was 
eclipsed 
because 
the 
earth 
intervened, 
is 
becoming 
eclipsed 
because 
the 
earth 
is 
in 
process 
of 
intervening, 
will 
be 
eclipsed 
because 
the 
earth 
will 
intervene, 
is 
eclipsed 
because 
the 
earth 
intervenes. 


To 
take 
a 
second 
example: 
assuming 
that 
the 
definition 
of 
ice 
is 
solidified 
water, 
let 
C 
be 
water, 
A 
solidified, 
B 
the 
middle, 
which 
is 
the 
cause, 
namely 
total 
failure 
of 
heat. 
Then 
B 
is 
attributed 
to 
C, 
and 
A, 
solidification, 
to 
B: 
ice 
when 
B 
is 
occurring, 
has 
formed 
when 
B 
has 
occurred, 
and 
will 
form 
when 
B 
shall 
occur. 


This 
sort 
of 
cause, 
then, 
and 
its 
effect 
come 
to 
be 
simultaneously 
when 
they 
are 
in 
process 
of 
becoming, 
and 
exist 
simultaneously 
when 
they 
actually 
exist; 
and 
the 
same 
holds 
good 
when 
they 
are 
past 
and 
when 
they 
are 
future. 
But 
what 
of 
cases 
where 
they 
are 
not 
simultaneous? 
Can 
causes 
and 
effects 
different 
from 
one 
another 
form, 
as 
they 
seem 
to 
us 
to 
form, 
a 
continuous 
succession, 
a 
past 
effect 
resulting 
from 
a 
past 
cause 
different 
from 
itself, 
a 
future 
effect 
from 
a 
future 
cause 
different 
from 
it, 
and 
an 
effect 
which 
is 
coming-to-be 
from 
a 
cause 
different 
from 
and 
prior 
to 
it? 
Now 
on 
this 
theory 
it 
is 
from 
the 
posterior 
event 
that 
we 
reason 
(and 
this 
though 
these 
later 
events 
actually 
have 
their 
source 
of 
origin 
in 
previous 
events—a 
fact 
which 
shows 
that 
also 
when 
the 
effect 
is 
coming-to-be 
we 
still 
reason 
from 
the 
posterior 
event), 
and 
from 
the 
event 
we 
cannot 
reason 
(we 
cannot 
argue 
that 
because 
an 
event 
A 
has 
occurred, 
therefore 
an 
event 
B 
has 
occurred 
subsequently 
to 
A 
but 
still 
in 
the 
past-and 
the 
same 
holds 
good 
if 
the 
occurrence 
is 
future)-cannot 
reason 
because, 
be 
the 
time 
interval 
definite 
or 
indefinite, 
it 
will 
never 
be 
possible 
to 
infer 
that 
because 
it 
is 
true 
to 
say 
that 
A 
occurred, 
therefore 
it 
is 
true 
to 
say 
that 
B, 
the 
subsequent 
event, 
occurred; 
for 
in 
the 
interval 
between 
the 
events, 
though 
A 
has 
already 
occurred, 
the 
latter 
statement 
will 
be 
false. 
And 
the 
same 
argument 
applies 
also 
to 
future 
events; 


i.e. 
one 
cannot 
infer 
from 
an 
event 
which 
occurred 
in 
the 
past 
that 
a 
future 

event 
will 
occur. 
The 
reason 
of 
this 
is 
that 
the 
middle 
must 
be 
homogeneous, 
past 
when 
the 
extremes 
are 
past, 
future 
when 
they 
are 
future, 
coming 
to 
be 
when 
they 
are 
coming-to-be, 
actually 
existent 
when 
they 
are 
actually 
existent; 
and 
there 
cannot 
be 
a 
middle 
term 
homogeneous 
with 
extremes 
respectively 
past 
and 
future. 
And 
it 
is 
a 
further 
difficulty 
in 
this 
theory 
that 
the 
time 
interval 
can 
be 
neither 
indefinite 
nor 
definite, 
since 
during 
it 
the 
inference 
will 
be 
false. 
We 
have 
also 
to 
inquire 
what 
it 
is 
that 
holds 
events 
together 
so 
that 
the 
coming-to-be 
now 
occurring 
in 
actual 
things 
follows 
upon 
a 
past 
event. 
It 
is 
evident, 
we 
may 
suggest, 
that 
a 
past 
event 
and 
a 
present 
process 
cannot 
be 
‘contiguous’, 
for 
not 
even 
two 
past 
events 
can 
be 
‘contiguous’. 
For 
past 
events 
are 
limits 
and 
atomic; 
so 
just 
as 
points 
are 
not 
‘contiguous’ 
neither 
are 
past 
events, 
since 
both 
are 
indivisible. 
For 
the 
same 
reason 
a 
past 
event 
and 
a 
present 
process 
cannot 
be 
‘contiguous’, 
for 
the 
process 
is 
divisible, 
the 
event 
indivisible. 
Thus 
the 
relation 
of 
present 
process 
to 
past 
event 
is 
analogous 
to 
that 
of 
line 
to 
point, 
since 
a 
process 
contains 
an 
infinity 
of 
past 
events. 
These 
questions, 
however, 
must 
receive 
a 
more 
explicit 
treatment 
in 
our 
general 
theory 
of 
change. 


The 
following 
must 
suffice 
as 
an 
account 
of 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
the 
middle 
would 
be 
identical 
with 
the 
cause 
on 
the 
supposition 
that 
coming-tobe 
is 
a 
series 
of 
consecutive 
events: 
for 
in 
the 
terms 
of 
such 
a 
series 
too 
the 
middle 
and 
major 
terms 
must 
form 
an 
immediate 
premiss; 
e.g. 
we 
argue 
that, 
since 
C 
has 
occurred, 
therefore 
A 
occurred: 
and 
C’s 
occurrence 
was 
posterior, 
A’s 
prior; 
but 
C 
is 
the 
source 
of 
the 
inference 
because 
it 
is 
nearer 
to 
the 
present 
moment, 
and 
the 
starting-point 
of 
time 
is 
the 
present. 
We 
next 
argue 
that, 
since 
D 
has 
occurred, 
therefore 
C 
occurred. 
Then 
we 
conclude 
that, 
since 
D 
has 
occurred, 
therefore 
A 
must 
have 
occurred; 
and 
the 
cause 
is 
C, 
for 
since 
D 
has 
occurred 
C 
must 
have 
occurred, 
and 
since 
C 
has 
occurred 
A 
must 
previously 
have 
occurred. 


If 
we 
get 
our 
middle 
term 
in 
this 
way, 
will 
the 
series 
terminate 
in 
an 
immediate 
premiss, 
or 
since, 
as 
we 
said, 
no 
two 
events 
are 
‘contiguous’, 
will 
a 
fresh 
middle 
term 
always 
intervene 
because 
there 
is 
an 
infinity 
of 
middles? 
No: 
though 
no 
two 
events 
are 
‘contiguous’, 
yet 
we 
must 
start 
from 
a 
premiss 
consisting 
of 
a 
middle 
and 
the 
present 
event 
as 
major. 
The 
like 
is 
true 
of 
future 
events 
too, 
since 
if 
it 
is 
true 
to 
say 
that 
D 
will 
exist, 
it 
must 
be 
a 
prior 
truth 
to 
say 
that 
A 
will 
exist, 
and 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
conclusion 
is 
C; 
for 
if 
D 
will 
exist, 
C 
will 
exist 
prior 
to 
D, 
and 
if 
C 
will 
exist, 
A 
will 
exist 
prior 
to 
it. 
And 
here 
too 
the 
same 
infinite 
divisibility 
might 
be 
urged, 
since 
future 
events 



are 
not 
‘contiguous’. 
But 
here 
too 
an 
immediate 
basic 
premiss 
must 
be 
assumed. 
And 
in 
the 
world 
of 
fact 
this 
is 
so: 
if 
a 
house 
has 
been 
built, 
then 
blocks 
must 
have 
been 
quarried 
and 
shaped. 
The 
reason 
is 
that 
a 
house 
having 
been 
built 
necessitates 
a 
foundation 
having 
been 
laid, 
and 
if 
a 
foundation 
has 
been 
laid 
blocks 
must 
have 
been 
shaped 
beforehand. 
Again, 
if 
a 
house 
will 
be 
built, 
blocks 
will 
similarly 
be 
shaped 
beforehand; 
and 
proof 
is 
through 
the 
middle 
in 
the 
same 
way, 
for 
the 
foundation 
will 
exist 
before 
the 
house. 


Now 
we 
observe 
in 
Nature 
a 
certain 
kind 
of 
circular 
process 
of 
coming-tobe; 
and 
this 
is 
possible 
only 
if 
the 
middle 
and 
extreme 
terms 
are 
reciprocal, 
since 
conversion 
is 
conditioned 
by 
reciprocity 
in 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
proof. 
This-
the 
convertibility 
of 
conclusions 
and 
premisses-has 
been 
proved 
in 
our 
early 
chapters, 
and 
the 
circular 
process 
is 
an 
instance 
of 
this. 
In 
actual 
fact 
it 
is 
exemplified 
thus: 
when 
the 
earth 
had 
been 
moistened 
an 
exhalation 
was 
bound 
to 
rise, 
and 
when 
an 
exhalation 
had 
risen 
cloud 
was 
bound 
to 
form, 
and 
from 
the 
formation 
of 
cloud 
rain 
necessarily 
resulted 
and 
by 
the 
fall 
of 
rain 
the 
earth 
was 
necessarily 
moistened: 
but 
this 
was 
the 
starting-point, 
so 
that 
a 
circle 
is 
completed; 
for 
posit 
any 
one 
of 
the 
terms 
and 
another 
follows 
from 
it, 
and 
from 
that 
another, 
and 
from 
that 
again 
the 
first. 


Some 
occurrences 
are 
universal 
(for 
they 
are, 
or 
come-to-be 
what 
they 
are, 
always 
and 
in 
ever 
case); 
others 
again 
are 
not 
always 
what 
they 
are 
but 
only 
as 
a 
general 
rule: 
for 
instance, 
not 
every 
man 
can 
grow 
a 
beard, 
but 
it 
is 
the 
general 
rule. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
such 
connexions 
the 
middle 
term 
too 
must 
be 
a 
general 
rule. 
For 
if 
A 
is 
predicated 
universally 
of 
B 
and 
B 
of 
C, 
A 
too 
must 
be 
predicated 
always 
and 
in 
every 
instance 
of 
C, 
since 
to 
hold 
in 
every 
instance 
and 
always 
is 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
universal. 
But 
we 
have 
assumed 
a 
connexion 
which 
is 
a 
general 
rule; 
consequently 
the 
middle 
term 
B 
must 
also 
be 
a 
general 
rule. 
So 
connexions 
which 
embody 
a 
general 
rule-i.e. 
which 
exist 
or 
come 
to 
be 
as 
a 
general 
rule-will 
also 
derive 
from 
immediate 
basic 
premisses. 


We 
have 
already 
explained 
how 
essential 
nature 
is 
set 
out 
in 
the 
terms 
of 
a 
demonstration, 
and 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
it 
is 
or 
is 
not 
demonstrable 
or 
definable; 
so 
let 
us 
now 
discuss 
the 
method 
to 
be 
adopted 
in 
tracing 
the 
elements 
predicated 
as 
constituting 
the 
definable 
form. 



Now 
of 
the 
attributes 
which 
inhere 
always 
in 
each 
several 
thing 
there 
are 
some 
which 
are 
wider 
in 
extent 
than 
it 
but 
not 
wider 
than 
its 
genus 
(by 
attributes 
of 
wider 
extent 
mean 
all 
such 
as 
are 
universal 
attributes 
of 
each 
several 
subject, 
but 
in 
their 
application 
are 
not 
confined 
to 
that 
subject). 
while 
an 
attribute 
may 
inhere 
in 
every 
triad, 
yet 
also 
in 
a 
subject 
not 
a 
triad-as 
being 
inheres 
in 
triad 
but 
also 
in 
subjects 
not 
numbers 
at 
all-odd 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
is 
an 
attribute 
inhering 
in 
every 
triad 
and 
of 
wider 
application 
(inhering 
as 
it 
does 
also 
in 
pentad), 
but 
which 
does 
not 
extend 
beyond 
the 
genus 
of 
triad; 
for 
pentad 
is 
a 
number, 
but 
nothing 
outside 
number 
is 
odd. 
It 
is 
such 
attributes 
which 
we 
have 
to 
select, 
up 
to 
the 
exact 
point 
at 
which 
they 
are 
severally 
of 
wider 
extent 
than 
the 
subject 
but 
collectively 
coextensive 
with 
it; 
for 
this 
synthesis 
must 
be 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
thing. 
For 
example 
every 
triad 
possesses 
the 
attributes 
number, 
odd, 
and 
prime 
in 
both 
senses, 
i.e. 
not 
only 
as 
possessing 
no 
divisors, 
but 
also 
as 
not 
being 
a 
sum 
of 
numbers. 
This, 
then, 
is 
precisely 
what 
triad 
is, 
viz. 
a 
number, 
odd, 
and 
prime 
in 
the 
former 
and 
also 
the 
latter 
sense 
of 
the 
term: 
for 
these 
attributes 
taken 
severally 
apply, 
the 
first 
two 
to 
all 
odd 
numbers, 
the 
last 
to 
the 
dyad 
also 
as 
well 
as 
to 
the 
triad, 
but, 
taken 
collectively, 
to 
no 
other 
subject. 
Now 
since 
we 
have 
shown 
above’ 
that 
attributes 
predicated 
as 
belonging 
to 
the 
essential 
nature 
are 
necessary 
and 
that 
universals 
are 
necessary, 
and 
since 
the 
attributes 
which 
we 
select 
as 
inhering 
in 
triad, 
or 
in 
any 
other 
subject 
whose 
attributes 
we 
select 
in 
this 
way, 
are 
predicated 
as 
belonging 
to 
its 
essential 
nature, 
triad 
will 
thus 
possess 
these 
attributes 
necessarily. 
Further, 
that 
the 
synthesis 
of 
them 
constitutes 
the 
substance 
of 
triad 
is 
shown 
by 
the 
following 
argument. 
If 
it 
is 
not 
identical 
with 
the 
being 
of 
triad, 
it 
must 
be 
related 
to 
triad 
as 
a 
genus 
named 
or 
nameless. 
It 
will 
then 
be 
of 
wider 
extent 
than 
triad-assuming 
that 
wider 
potential 
extent 
is 
the 
character 
of 
a 
genus. 
If 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
this 
synthesis 
is 
applicable 
to 
no 
subject 
other 
than 
the 
individual 
triads, 
it 
will 
be 
identical 
with 
the 
being 
of 
triad, 
because 
we 
make 
the 
further 
assumption 
that 
the 
substance 
of 
each 
subject 
is 
the 
predication 
of 
elements 
in 
its 
essential 
nature 
down 
to 
the 
last 
differentia 
characterizing 
the 
individuals. 
It 
follows 
that 
any 
other 
synthesis 
thus 
exhibited 
will 
likewise 
be 
identical 
with 
the 
being 
of 
the 
subject. 


The 
author 
of 
a 
hand-book 
on 
a 
subject 
that 
is 
a 
generic 
whole 
should 
divide 
the 
genus 
into 
its 
first 
infimae 
species-number 
e.g. 
into 
triad 
and 
dyad-
and 
then 
endeavour 
to 
seize 
their 
definitions 
by 
the 
method 
we 
have 
described-the 
definition, 
for 
example, 
of 
straight 
line 
or 
circle 
or 
right 
angle. 



After 
that, 
having 
established 
what 
the 
category 
is 
to 
which 
the 
subaltern 
genus 
belongs-quantity 
or 
quality, 
for 
instance-he 
should 
examine 
the 
properties 
‘peculiar’ 
to 
the 
species, 
working 
through 
the 
proximate 
common 
differentiae. 
He 
should 
proceed 
thus 
because 
the 
attributes 
of 
the 
genera 
compounded 
of 
the 
infimae 
species 
will 
be 
clearly 
given 
by 
the 
definitions 
of 
the 
species; 
since 
the 
basic 
element 
of 
them 
all 
is 
the 
definition, 
i.e. 
the 
simple 
infirma 
species, 
and 
the 
attributes 
inhere 
essentially 
in 
the 
simple 
infimae 
species, 
in 
the 
genera 
only 
in 
virtue 
of 
these. 


Divisions 
according 
to 
differentiae 
are 
a 
useful 
accessory 
to 
this 
method. 
What 
force 
they 
have 
as 
proofs 
we 
did, 
indeed, 
explain 
above, 
but 
that 
merely 
towards 
collecting 
the 
essential 
nature 
they 
may 
be 
of 
use 
we 
will 
proceed 
to 
show. 
They 
might, 
indeed, 
seem 
to 
be 
of 
no 
use 
at 
all, 
but 
rather 
to 
assume 
everything 
at 
the 
start 
and 
to 
be 
no 
better 
than 
an 
initial 
assumption 
made 
without 
division. 
But, 
in 
fact, 
the 
order 
in 
which 
the 
attributes 
are 
predicated 
does 
make 
a 
difference—it 
matters 
whether 
we 
say 
animal-tamebiped, 
or 
biped-animal-tame. 
For 
if 
every 
definable 
thing 
consists 
of 
two 
elements 
and 
‘animal-tame’ 
forms 
a 
unity, 
and 
again 
out 
of 
this 
and 
the 
further 
differentia 
man 
(or 
whatever 
else 
is 
the 
unity 
under 
construction) 
is 
constituted, 
then 
the 
elements 
we 
assume 
have 
necessarily 
been 
reached 
by 
division. 
Again, 
division 
is 
the 
only 
possible 
method 
of 
avoiding 
the 
omission 
of 
any 
element 
of 
the 
essential 
nature. 
Thus, 
if 
the 
primary 
genus 
is 
assumed 
and 
we 
then 
take 
one 
of 
the 
lower 
divisions, 
the 
dividendum 
will 
not 
fall 
whole 
into 
this 
division: 
e.g. 
it 
is 
not 
all 
animal 
which 
is 
either 
whole-
winged 
or 
split-winged 
but 
all 
winged 
animal, 
for 
it 
is 
winged 
animal 
to 
which 
this 
differentiation 
belongs. 
The 
primary 
differentiation 
of 
animal 
is 
that 
within 
which 
all 
animal 
falls. 
The 
like 
is 
true 
of 
every 
other 
genus, 
whether 
outside 
animal 
or 
a 
subaltern 
genus 
of 
animal; 
e.g. 
the 
primary 
differentiation 
of 
bird 
is 
that 
within 
which 
falls 
every 
bird, 
of 
fish 
that 
within 
which 
falls 
every 
fish. 
So, 
if 
we 
proceed 
in 
this 
way, 
we 
can 
be 
sure 
that 
nothing 
has 
been 
omitted: 
by 
any 
other 
method 
one 
is 
bound 
to 
omit 
something 
without 
knowing 
it. 


To 
define 
and 
divide 
one 
need 
not 
know 
the 
whole 
of 
existence. 
Yet 
some 
hold 
it 
impossible 
to 
know 
the 
differentiae 
distinguishing 
each 
thing 
from 
every 
single 
other 
thing 
without 
knowing 
every 
single 
other 
thing; 
and 
one 
cannot, 
they 
say, 
know 
each 
thing 
without 
knowing 
its 
differentiae, 
since 
everything 
is 
identical 
with 
that 
from 
which 
it 
does 
not 
differ, 
and 
other 
than 
that 
from 
which 
it 
differs. 
Now 
first 
of 
all 
this 
is 
a 
fallacy: 
not 
every 



differentia 
precludes 
identity, 
since 
many 
differentiae 
inhere 
in 
things 
specifically 
identical, 
though 
not 
in 
the 
substance 
of 
these 
nor 
essentially. 
Secondly, 
when 
one 
has 
taken 
one’s 
differing 
pair 
of 
opposites 
and 
assumed 
that 
the 
two 
sides 
exhaust 
the 
genus, 
and 
that 
the 
subject 
one 
seeks 
to 
define 
is 
present 
in 
one 
or 
other 
of 
them, 
and 
one 
has 
further 
verified 
its 
presence 
in 
one 
of 
them; 
then 
it 
does 
not 
matter 
whether 
or 
not 
one 
knows 
all 
the 
other 
subjects 
of 
which 
the 
differentiae 
are 
also 
predicated. 
For 
it 
is 
obvious 
that 
when 
by 
this 
process 
one 
reaches 
subjects 
incapable 
of 
further 
differentiation 
one 
will 
possess 
the 
formula 
defining 
the 
substance. 
Moreover, 
to 
postulate 
that 
the 
division 
exhausts 
the 
genus 
is 
not 
illegitimate 
if 
the 
opposites 
exclude 
a 
middle; 
since 
if 
it 
is 
the 
differentia 
of 
that 
genus, 
anything 
contained 
in 
the 
genus 
must 
lie 
on 
one 
of 
the 
two 
sides. 


In 
establishing 
a 
definition 
by 
division 
one 
should 
keep 
three 
objects 
in 
view: 
(1) 
the 
admission 
only 
of 
elements 
in 
the 
definable 
form, 
(2) 
the 
arrangement 
of 
these 
in 
the 
right 
order, 
(3) 
the 
omission 
of 
no 
such 
elements. 
The 
first 
is 
feasible 
because 
one 
can 
establish 
genus 
and 
differentia 
through 
the 
topic 
of 
the 
genus, 
just 
as 
one 
can 
conclude 
the 
inherence 
of 
an 
accident 
through 
the 
topic 
of 
the 
accident. 
The 
right 
order 
will 
be 
achieved 
if 
the 
right 
term 
is 
assumed 
as 
primary, 
and 
this 
will 
be 
ensured 
if 
the 
term 
selected 
is 
predicable 
of 
all 
the 
others 
but 
not 
all 
they 
of 
it; 
since 
there 
must 
be 
one 
such 
term. 
Having 
assumed 
this 
we 
at 
once 
proceed 
in 
the 
same 
way 
with 
the 
lower 
terms; 
for 
our 
second 
term 
will 
be 
the 
first 
of 
the 
remainder, 
our 
third 
the 
first 
of 
those 
which 
follow 
the 
second 
in 
a 
‘contiguous’ 
series, 
since 
when 
the 
higher 
term 
is 
excluded, 
that 
term 
of 
the 
remainder 
which 
is 
‘contiguous’ 
to 
it 
will 
be 
primary, 
and 
so 
on. 
Our 
procedure 
makes 
it 
clear 
that 
no 
elements 
in 
the 
definable 
form 
have 
been 
omitted: 
we 
have 
taken 
the 
differentia 
that 
comes 
first 
in 
the 
order 
of 
division, 
pointing 
out 
that 
animal, 


e.g. 
is 
divisible 
exhaustively 
into 
A 
and 
B, 
and 
that 
the 
subject 
accepts 
one 
of 
the 
two 
as 
its 
predicate. 
Next 
we 
have 
taken 
the 
differentia 
of 
the 
whole 
thus 
reached, 
and 
shown 
that 
the 
whole 
we 
finally 
reach 
is 
not 
further 
divisible-i.e. 
that 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
have 
taken 
the 
last 
differentia 
to 
form 
the 
concrete 
totality, 
this 
totality 
admits 
of 
no 
division 
into 
species. 
For 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
there 
is 
no 
superfluous 
addition, 
since 
all 
these 
terms 
we 
have 
selected 
are 
elements 
in 
the 
definable 
form; 
and 
nothing 
lacking, 
since 
any 
omission 
would 
have 
to 
be 
a 
genus 
or 
a 
differentia. 
Now 
the 
primary 
term 
is 
a 
genus, 
and 
this 
term 
taken 
in 
conjunction 
with 
its 
differentiae 
is 
a 
genus: 
moreover 
the 
differentiae 
are 
all 
included, 
because 
there 
is 
now 
no 
further 
differentia; 
if 
there 
were, 
the 

final 
concrete 
would 
admit 
of 
division 
into 
species, 
which, 
we 
said, 
is 
not 
the 
case. 


To 
resume 
our 
account 
of 
the 
right 
method 
of 
investigation: 
We 
must 
start 
by 
observing 
a 
set 
of 
similar-i.e. 
specifically 
identical-individuals, 
and 
consider 
what 
element 
they 
have 
in 
common. 
We 
must 
then 
apply 
the 
same 
process 
to 
another 
set 
of 
individuals 
which 
belong 
to 
one 
species 
and 
are 
generically 
but 
not 
specifically 
identical 
with 
the 
former 
set. 
When 
we 
have 
established 
what 
the 
common 
element 
is 
in 
all 
members 
of 
this 
second 
species, 
and 
likewise 
in 
members 
of 
further 
species, 
we 
should 
again 
consider 
whether 
the 
results 
established 
possess 
any 
identity, 
and 
persevere 
until 
we 
reach 
a 
single 
formula, 
since 
this 
will 
be 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
thing. 
But 
if 
we 
reach 
not 
one 
formula 
but 
two 
or 
more, 
evidently 
the 
definiendum 
cannot 
be 
one 
thing 
but 
must 
be 
more 
than 
one. 
I 
may 
illustrate 
my 
meaning 
as 
follows. 
If 
we 
were 
inquiring 
what 
the 
essential 
nature 
of 
pride 
is, 
we 
should 
examine 
instances 
of 
proud 
men 
we 
know 
of 
to 
see 
what, 
as 
such, 
they 
have 
in 
common; 
e.g. 
if 
Alcibiades 
was 
proud, 
or 
Achilles 
and 
Ajax 
were 
proud, 
we 
should 
find 
on 
inquiring 
what 
they 
all 
had 
in 
common, 
that 
it 
was 
intolerance 
of 
insult; 
it 
was 
this 
which 
drove 
Alcibiades 
to 
war, 
Achilles 
wrath, 
and 
Ajax 
to 
suicide. 
We 
should 
next 
examine 
other 
cases, 
Lysander, 
for 
example, 
or 
Socrates, 
and 
then 
if 
these 
have 
in 
common 
indifference 
alike 
to 
good 
and 
ill 
fortune, 
I 
take 
these 
two 
results 
and 
inquire 
what 
common 
element 
have 
equanimity 
amid 
the 
vicissitudes 
of 
life 
and 
impatience 
of 
dishonour. 
If 
they 
have 
none, 
there 
will 
be 
two 
genera 
of 
pride. 
Besides, 
every 
definition 
is 
always 
universal 
and 
commensurate: 
the 
physician 
does 
not 
prescribe 
what 
is 
healthy 
for 
a 
single 
eye, 
but 
for 
all 
eyes 
or 
for 
a 
determinate 
species 
of 
eye. 
It 
is 
also 
easier 
by 
this 
method 
to 
define 
the 
single 
species 
than 
the 
universal, 
and 
that 
is 
why 
our 
procedure 
should 
be 
from 
the 
several 
species 
to 
the 
universal 
genera-this 
for 
the 
further 
reason 
too 
that 
equivocation 
is 
less 
readily 
detected 
in 
genera 
than 
in 
infimae 
species. 
Indeed, 
perspicuity 
is 
essential 
in 
definitions, 
just 
as 
inferential 
movement 
is 
the 
minimum 
required 
in 
demonstrations; 
and 
we 
shall 
attain 
perspicuity 
if 
we 
can 
collect 
separately 
the 
definition 
of 
each 
species 
through 
the 
group 
of 
singulars 
which 
we 
have 
established 
e.g. 
the 
definition 
of 
similarity 
not 
unqualified 
but 
restricted 
to 
colours 
and 
to 
figures; 
the 
definition 
of 
acuteness, 
but 
only 
of 
sound-and 
so 
proceed 
to 
the 
common 
universal 
with 
a 
careful 
avoidance 
of 
equivocation. 
We 
may 
add 
that 
if 
dialectical 
disputation 
must 
not 
employ 
metaphors, 
clearly 
metaphors 
and 
metaphorical 
expressions 
are 
precluded 
in 
definition: 



otherwise 
dialectic 
would 
involve 
metaphors. 


14 


In 
order 
to 
formulate 
the 
connexions 
we 
wish 
to 
prove 
we 
have 
to 
select 
our 
analyses 
and 
divisions. 
The 
method 
of 
selection 
consists 
in 
laying 
down 
the 
common 
genus 
of 
all 
our 
subjects 
of 
investigation-if 
e.g. 
they 
are 
animals, 
we 
lay 
down 
what 
the 
properties 
are 
which 
inhere 
in 
every 
animal. 
These 
established, 
we 
next 
lay 
down 
the 
properties 
essentially 
connected 
with 
the 
first 
of 
the 
remaining 
classes-e.g. 
if 
this 
first 
subgenus 
is 
bird, 
the 
essential 
properties 
of 
every 
bird-and 
so 
on, 
always 
characterizing 
the 
proximate 
subgenus. 
This 
will 
clearly 
at 
once 
enable 
us 
to 
say 
in 
virtue 
of 
what 
character 
the 
subgenera-man, 
e.g. 
or 
horse-possess 
their 
properties. 
Let 
A 
be 
animal, 
B 
the 
properties 
of 
every 
animal, 
C 
D 
E 
various 
species 
of 
animal. 
Then 
it 
is 
clear 
in 
virtue 
of 
what 
character 
B 
inheres 
in 
D-namely 
A-and 
that 
it 
inheres 
in 
C 
and 
E 
for 
the 
same 
reason: 
and 
throughout 
the 
remaining 
subgenera 
always 
the 
same 
rule 
applies. 


We 
are 
now 
taking 
our 
examples 
from 
the 
traditional 
class-names, 
but 
we 
must 
not 
confine 
ourselves 
to 
considering 
these. 
We 
must 
collect 
any 
other 
common 
character 
which 
we 
observe, 
and 
then 
consider 
with 
what 
species 
it 
is 
connected 
and 
what.properties 
belong 
to 
it. 
For 
example, 
as 
the 
common 
properties 
of 
horned 
animals 
we 
collect 
the 
possession 
of 
a 
third 
stomach 
and 
only 
one 
row 
of 
teeth. 
Then 
since 
it 
is 
clear 
in 
virtue 
of 
what 
character 
they 
possess 
these 
attributes-namely 
their 
horned 
character-the 
next 
question 
is, 
to 
what 
species 
does 
the 
possession 
of 
horns 
attach? 


Yet 
a 
further 
method 
of 
selection 
is 
by 
analogy: 
for 
we 
cannot 
find 
a 
single 
identical 
name 
to 
give 
to 
a 
squid’s 
pounce, 
a 
fish’s 
spine, 
and 
an 
animal’s 
bone, 
although 
these 
too 
possess 
common 
properties 
as 
if 
there 
were 
a 
single 
osseous 
nature. 


15 


Some 
connexions 
that 
require 
proof 
are 
identical 
in 
that 
they 
possess 
an 
identical 
‘middle’ 
e.g. 
a 
whole 
group 
might 
be 
proved 
through 
‘reciprocal 
replacement’-and 
of 
these 
one 
class 
are 
identical 
in 
genus, 
namely 
all 
those 
whose 
difference 
consists 
in 
their 
concerning 
different 
subjects 
or 
in 
their 



mode 
of 
manifestation. 
This 
latter 
class 
may 
be 
exemplified 
by 
the 
questions 
as 
to 
the 
causes 
respectively 
of 
echo, 
of 
reflection, 
and 
of 
the 
rainbow: 
the 
connexions 
to 
be 
proved 
which 
these 
questions 
embody 
are 
identical 
generically, 
because 
all 
three 
are 
forms 
of 
repercussion; 
but 
specifically 
they 
are 
different. 


Other 
connexions 
that 
require 
proof 
only 
differ 
in 
that 
the 
‘middle’ 
of 
the 
one 
is 
subordinate 
to 
the 
‘middle’ 
of 
the 
other. 
For 
example: 
Why 
does 
the 
Nile 
rise 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
the 
month? 
Because 
towards 
its 
close 
the 
month 
is 
more 
stormy. 
Why 
is 
the 
month 
more 
stormy 
towards 
its 
close? 
Because 
the 
moon 
is 
waning. 
Here 
the 
one 
cause 
is 
subordinate 
to 
the 
other. 


The 
question 
might 
be 
raised 
with 
regard 
to 
cause 
and 
effect 
whether 
when 
the 
effect 
is 
present 
the 
cause 
also 
is 
present; 
whether, 
for 
instance, 
if 
a 
plant 
sheds 
its 
leaves 
or 
the 
moon 
is 
eclipsed, 
there 
is 
present 
also 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
eclipse 
or 
of 
the 
fall 
of 
the 
leaves-the 
possession 
of 
broad 
leaves, 
let 
us 
say, 
in 
the 
latter 
case, 
in 
the 
former 
the 
earth’s 
interposition. 
For, 
one 
might 
argue, 
if 
this 
cause 
is 
not 
present, 
these 
phenomena 
will 
have 
some 
other 
cause: 
if 
it 
is 
present, 
its 
effect 
will 
be 
at 
once 
implied 
by 
it-the 
eclipse 
by 
the 
earth’s 
interposition, 
the 
fall 
of 
the 
leaves 
by 
the 
possession 
of 
broad 
leaves; 
but 
if 
so, 
they 
will 
be 
logically 
coincident 
and 
each 
capable 
of 
proof 
through 
the 
other. 
Let 
me 
illustrate: 
Let 
A 
be 
deciduous 
character, 
B 
the 
possession 
of 
broad 
leaves, 
C 
vine. 
Now 
if 
A 
inheres 
in 
B 
(for 
every 
broad-leaved 
plant 
is 
deciduous), 
and 
B 
in 
C 
(every 
vine 
possessing 
broad 
leaves); 
then 
A 
inheres 
in 
C 
(every 
vine 
is 
deciduous), 
and 
the 
middle 
term 
B 
is 
the 
cause. 
But 
we 
can 
also 
demonstrate 
that 
the 
vine 
has 
broad 
leaves 
because 
it 
is 
deciduous. 
Thus, 
let 
D 
be 
broad-leaved, 
E 
deciduous, 
F 
vine. 
Then 
E 
inheres 
in 
F 
(since 
every 
vine 
is 
deciduous), 
and 
D 
in 
E 
(for 
every 
deciduous 
plant 
has 
broad 
leaves): 
therefore 
every 
vine 
has 
broad 
leaves, 
and 
the 
cause 
is 
its 
deciduous 
character. 
If, 
however, 
they 
cannot 
each 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
other 
(for 
cause 
is 
prior 
to 
effect, 
and 
the 
earth’s 
interposition 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
moon’s 
eclipse 
and 
not 
the 
eclipse 
of 
the 
interposition)-if, 
then, 
demonstration 
through 
the 
cause 
is 
of 
the 
reasoned 
fact 
and 
demonstration 
not 
through 
the 
cause 
is 
of 
the 
bare 
fact, 
one 
who 
knows 
it 
through 
the 
eclipse 
knows 
the 
fact 
of 
the 
earth’s 
interposition 
but 
not 
the 
reasoned 
fact. 
Moreover, 
that 
the 
eclipse 
is 
not 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
interposition, 
but 
the 
interposition 
of 
the 
eclipse, 
is 



obvious 
because 
the 
interposition 
is 
an 
element 
in 
the 
definition 
of 
eclipse, 
which 
shows 
that 
the 
eclipse 
is 
known 
through 
the 
interposition 
and 
not 
vice 
versa. 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
can 
a 
single 
effect 
have 
more 
than 
one 
cause? 
One 
might 
argue 
as 
follows: 
if 
the 
same 
attribute 
is 
predicable 
of 
more 
than 
one 
thing 
as 
its 
primary 
subject, 
let 
B 
be 
a 
primary 
subject 
in 
which 
A 
inheres, 
and 
C 
another 
primary 
subject 
of 
A, 
and 
D 
and 
E 
primary 
subjects 
of 
B 
and 
C 
respectively. 
A 
will 
then 
inhere 
in 
D 
and 
E, 
and 
B 
will 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
A’s 
inherence 
in 
D, 
C 
of 
A’s 
inherence 
in 
E. 
The 
presence 
of 
the 
cause 
thus 
necessitates 
that 
of 
the 
effect, 
but 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
effect 
necessitates 
the 
presence 
not 
of 
all 
that 
may 
cause 
it 
but 
only 
of 
a 
cause 
which 
yet 
need 
not 
be 
the 
whole 
cause. 
We 
may, 
however, 
suggest 
that 
if 
the 
connexion 
to 
be 
proved 
is 
always 
universal 
and 
commensurate, 
not 
only 
will 
the 
cause 
be 
a 
whole 
but 
also 
the 
effect 
will 
be 
universal 
and 
commensurate. 
For 
instance, 
deciduous 
character 
will 
belong 
exclusively 
to 
a 
subject 
which 
is 
a 
whole, 
and, 
if 
this 
whole 
has 
species, 
universally 
and 
commensurately 
to 
those 
species-i.e. 
either 
to 
all 
species 
of 
plant 
or 
to 
a 
single 
species. 
So 
in 
these 
universal 
and 
commensurate 
connexions 
the 
‘middle’ 
and 
its 
effect 
must 
reciprocate, 
i.e. 
be 
convertible. 
Supposing, 
for 
example, 
that 
the 
reason 
why 
trees 
are 
deciduous 
is 
the 
coagulation 
of 
sap, 
then 
if 
a 
tree 
is 
deciduous, 
coagulation 
must 
be 
present, 
and 
if 
coagulation 
is 
present-not 
in 
any 
subject 
but 
in 
a 
tree-then 
that 
tree 
must 
be 
deciduous. 


Can 
the 
cause 
of 
an 
identical 
effect 
be 
not 
identical 
in 
every 
instance 
of 
the 
effect 
but 
different? 
Or 
is 
that 
impossible? 
Perhaps 
it 
is 
impossible 
if 
the 
effect 
is 
demonstrated 
as 
essential 
and 
not 
as 
inhering 
in 
virtue 
of 
a 
symptom 
or 
an 
accident-because 
the 
middle 
is 
then 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
major 
term-
though 
possible 
if 
the 
demonstration 
is 
not 
essential. 
Now 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
consider 
the 
effect 
and 
its 
subject 
as 
an 
accidental 
conjunction, 
though 
such 
conjunctions 
would 
not 
be 
regarded 
as 
connexions 
demanding 
scientific 
proof. 
But 
if 
they 
are 
accepted 
as 
such, 
the 
middle 
will 
correspond 
to 
the 
extremes, 
and 
be 
equivocal 
if 
they 
are 
equivocal, 
generically 
one 
if 
they 
are 
generically 
one. 
Take 
the 
question 
why 
proportionals 
alternate. 
The 
cause 
when 
they 
are 
lines, 
and 
when 
they 
are 
numbers, 
is 
both 
different 
and 
identical; 
different 
in 
so 
far 
as 
lines 
are 
lines 
and 
not 
numbers, 
identical 
as 



involving 
a 
given 
determinate 
increment. 
In 
all 
proportionals 
this 
is 
so. 
Again, 
the 
cause 
of 
likeness 
between 
colour 
and 
colour 
is 
other 
than 
that 
between 
figure 
and 
figure; 
for 
likeness 
here 
is 
equivocal, 
meaning 
perhaps 
in 
the 
latter 
case 
equality 
of 
the 
ratios 
of 
the 
sides 
and 
equality 
of 
the 
angles, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
colours 
identity 
of 
the 
act 
of 
perceiving 
them, 
or 
something 
else 
of 
the 
sort. 
Again, 
connexions 
requiring 
proof 
which 
are 
identical 
by 
analogy 
middles 
also 
analogous. 


The 
truth 
is 
that 
cause, 
effect, 
and 
subject 
are 
reciprocally 
predicable 
in 
the 
following 
way. 
If 
the 
species 
are 
taken 
severally, 
the 
effect 
is 
wider 
than 
the 
subject 
(e.g. 
the 
possession 
of 
external 
angles 
equal 
to 
four 
right 
angles 
is 
an 
attribute 
wider 
than 
triangle 
or 
are), 
but 
it 
is 
coextensive 
with 
the 
species 
taken 
collectively 
(in 
this 
instance 
with 
all 
figures 
whose 
external 
angles 
are 
equal 
to 
four 
right 
angles). 
And 
the 
middle 
likewise 
reciprocates, 
for 
the 
middle 
is 
a 
definition 
of 
the 
major; 
which 
is 
incidentally 
the 
reason 
why 
all 
the 
sciences 
are 
built 
up 
through 
definition. 


We 
may 
illustrate 
as 
follows. 
Deciduous 
is 
a 
universal 
attribute 
of 
vine, 
and 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
of 
wider 
extent 
than 
vine; 
and 
of 
fig, 
and 
is 
of 
wider 
extent 
than 
fig: 
but 
it 
is 
not 
wider 
than 
but 
coextensive 
with 
the 
totality 
of 
the 
species. 
Then 
if 
you 
take 
the 
middle 
which 
is 
proximate, 
it 
is 
a 
definition 
of 
deciduous. 
I 
say 
that, 
because 
you 
will 
first 
reach 
a 
middle 
next 
the 
subject, 
and 
a 
premiss 
asserting 
it 
of 
the 
whole 
subject, 
and 
after 
that 
a 
middle-the 
coagulation 
of 
sap 
or 
something 
of 
the 
sort-proving 
the 
connexion 
of 
the 
first 
middle 
with 
the 
major: 
but 
it 
is 
the 
coagulation 
of 
sap 
at 
the 
junction 
of 
leafstalk 
and 
stem 
which 
defines 
deciduous. 


If 
an 
explanation 
in 
formal 
terms 
of 
the 
inter-relation 
of 
cause 
and 
effect 
is 
demanded, 
we 
shall 
offer 
the 
following. 
Let 
A 
be 
an 
attribute 
of 
all 
B, 
and 
B 
of 
every 
species 
of 
D, 
but 
so 
that 
both 
A 
and 
B 
are 
wider 
than 
their 
respective 
subjects. 
Then 
B 
will 
be 
a 
universal 
attribute 
of 
each 
species 
of 
D 
(since 
I 
call 
such 
an 
attribute 
universal 
even 
if 
it 
is 
not 
commensurate, 
and 
I 
call 
an 
attribute 
primary 
universal 
if 
it 
is 
commensurate, 
not 
with 
each 
species 
severally 
but 
with 
their 
totality), 
and 
it 
extends 
beyond 
each 
of 
them 
taken 
separately. 


Thus, 
B 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
A’s 
inherence 
in 
the 
species 
of 
D: 
consequently 
A 
must 
be 
of 
wider 
extent 
than 
B; 
otherwise 
why 
should 
B 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
A’s 
inherence 
in 
D 
any 
more 
than 
A 
the 
cause 
of 
B’s 
inherence 
in 
D? 
Now 
if 
A 
is 
an 
attribute 
of 
all 
the 
species 
of 
E, 
all 
the 
species 
of 
E 
will 
be 
united 
by 
possessing 
some 
common 
cause 
other 
than 
B: 
otherwise 
how 
shall 
we 
be 
able 



to 
say 
that 
A 
is 
predicable 
of 
all 
of 
which 
E 
is 
predicable, 
while 
E 
is 
not 
predicable 
of 
all 
of 
which 
A 
can 
be 
predicated? 
I 
mean 
how 
can 
there 
fail 
to 
be 
some 
special 
cause 
of 
A’s 
inherence 
in 
E, 
as 
there 
was 
of 
A’s 
inherence 
in 
all 
the 
species 
of 
D? 
Then 
are 
the 
species 
of 
E, 
too, 
united 
by 
possessing 
some 
common 
cause? 
This 
cause 
we 
must 
look 
for. 
Let 
us 
call 
it 
C. 


We 
conclude, 
then, 
that 
the 
same 
effect 
may 
have 
more 
than 
one 
cause, 
but 
not 
in 
subjects 
specifically 
identical. 
For 
instance, 
the 
cause 
of 
longevity 
in 
quadrupeds 
is 
lack 
of 
bile, 
in 
birds 
a 
dry 
constitution-or 
certainly 
something 
different. 


18 


If 
immediate 
premisses 
are 
not 
reached 
at 
once, 
and 
there 
is 
not 
merely 
one 
middle 
but 
several 
middles, 
i.e. 
several 
causes; 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
property’s 
inherence 
in 
the 
several 
species 
the 
middle 
which 
is 
proximate 
to 
the 
primary 
universal, 
or 
the 
middle 
which 
is 
proximate 
to 
the 
species? 
Clearly 
the 
cause 
is 
that 
nearest 
to 
each 
species 
severally 
in 
which 
it 
is 
manifested, 
for 
that 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
subject’s 
falling 
under 
the 
universal. 
To 
illustrate 
formally: 
C 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
B’s 
inherence 
in 
D; 
hence 
C 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
A’s 
inherence 
in 
D, 
B 
of 
A’s 
inherence 
in 
C, 
while 
the 
cause 
of 
A’s 
inherence 
in 
B 
is 
B 
itself. 


19 


As 
regards 
syllogism 
and 
demonstration, 
the 
definition 
of, 
and 
the 
conditions 
required 
to 
produce 
each 
of 
them, 
are 
now 
clear, 
and 
with 
that 
also 
the 
definition 
of, 
and 
the 
conditions 
required 
to 
produce, 
demonstrative 
knowledge, 
since 
it 
is 
the 
same 
as 
demonstration. 
As 
to 
the 
basic 
premisses, 
how 
they 
become 
known 
and 
what 
is 
the 
developed 
state 
of 
knowledge 
of 
them 
is 
made 
clear 
by 
raising 
some 
preliminary 
problems. 


We 
have 
already 
said 
that 
scientific 
knowledge 
through 
demonstration 
is 
impossible 
unless 
a 
man 
knows 
the 
primary 
immediate 
premisses. 
But 
there 
are 
questions 
which 
might 
be 
raised 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
apprehension 
of 
these 
immediate 
premisses: 
one 
might 
not 
only 
ask 
whether 
it 
is 
of 
the 
same 
kind 
as 
the 
apprehension 
of 
the 
conclusions, 
but 
also 
whether 
there 
is 
or 
is 
not 
scientific 
knowledge 
of 
both; 
or 
scientific 
knowledge 
of 
the 
latter, 
and 
of 
the 
former 
a 
different 
kind 
of 
knowledge; 
and, 
further, 
whether 
the 
developed 



states 
of 
knowledge 
are 
not 
innate 
but 
come 
to 
be 
in 
us, 
or 
are 
innate 
but 
at 
first 
unnoticed. 
Now 
it 
is 
strange 
if 
we 
possess 
them 
from 
birth; 
for 
it 
means 
that 
we 
possess 
apprehensions 
more 
accurate 
than 
demonstration 
and 
fail 
to 
notice 
them. 
If 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
we 
acquire 
them 
and 
do 
not 
previously 
possess 
them, 
how 
could 
we 
apprehend 
and 
learn 
without 
a 
basis 
of 
preexistent 
knowledge? 
For 
that 
is 
impossible, 
as 
we 
used 
to 
find 
in 
the 
case 
of 
demonstration. 
So 
it 
emerges 
that 
neither 
can 
we 
possess 
them 
from 
birth, 
nor 
can 
they 
come 
to 
be 
in 
us 
if 
we 
are 
without 
knowledge 
of 
them 
to 
the 
extent 
of 
having 
no 
such 
developed 
state 
at 
all. 
Therefore 
we 
must 
possess 
a 
capacity 
of 
some 
sort, 
but 
not 
such 
as 
to 
rank 
higher 
in 
accuracy 
than 
these 
developed 
states. 
And 
this 
at 
least 
is 
an 
obvious 
characteristic 
of 
all 
animals, 
for 
they 
possess 
a 
congenital 
discriminative 
capacity 
which 
is 
called 
sense-
perception. 
But 
though 
sense-perception 
is 
innate 
in 
all 
animals, 
in 
some 
the 
sense-impression 
comes 
to 
persist, 
in 
others 
it 
does 
not. 
So 
animals 
in 
which 
this 
persistence 
does 
not 
come 
to 
be 
have 
either 
no 
knowledge 
at 
all 
outside 
the 
act 
of 
perceiving, 
or 
no 
knowledge 
of 
objects 
of 
which 
no 
impression 
persists; 
animals 
in 
which 
it 
does 
come 
into 
being 
have 
perception 
and 
can 
continue 
to 
retain 
the 
sense-impression 
in 
the 
soul: 
and 
when 
such 
persistence 
is 
frequently 
repeated 
a 
further 
distinction 
at 
once 
arises 
between 
those 
which 
out 
of 
the 
persistence 
of 
such 
sense-impressions 
develop 
a 
power 
of 
systematizing 
them 
and 
those 
which 
do 
not. 
So 
out 
of 
sense-perception 
comes 
to 
be 
what 
we 
call 
memory, 
and 
out 
of 
frequently 
repeated 
memories 
of 
the 
same 
thing 
develops 
experience; 
for 
a 
number 
of 
memories 
constitute 
a 
single 
experience. 
From 
experience 
again-i.e. 
from 
the 
universal 
now 
stabilized 
in 
its 
entirety 
within 
the 
soul, 
the 
one 
beside 
the 
many 
which 
is 
a 
single 
identity 
within 
them 
all-originate 
the 
skill 
of 
the 
craftsman 
and 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
man 
of 
science, 
skill 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
coming 
to 
be 
and 
science 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
being. 


We 
conclude 
that 
these 
states 
of 
knowledge 
are 
neither 
innate 
in 
a 
determinate 
form, 
nor 
developed 
from 
other 
higher 
states 
of 
knowledge, 
but 
from 
sense-perception. 
It 
is 
like 
a 
rout 
in 
battle 
stopped 
by 
first 
one 
man 
making 
a 
stand 
and 
then 
another, 
until 
the 
original 
formation 
has 
been 
restored. 
The 
soul 
is 
so 
constituted 
as 
to 
be 
capable 
of 
this 
process. 


Let 
us 
now 
restate 
the 
account 
given 
already, 
though 
with 
insufficient 
clearness. 
When 
one 
of 
a 
number 
of 
logically 
indiscriminable 
particulars 
has 
made 
a 
stand, 
the 
earliest 
universal 
is 
present 
in 
the 
soul: 
for 
though 
the 
act 
of 
sense-perception 
is 
of 
the 
particular, 
its 
content 
is 
universal-is 
man, 
for 



example, 
not 
the 
man 
Callias. 
A 
fresh 
stand 
is 
made 
among 
these 
rudimentary 
universals, 
and 
the 
process 
does 
not 
cease 
until 
the 
indivisible 
concepts, 
the 
true 
universals, 
are 
established: 
e.g. 
such 
and 
such 
a 
species 
of 
animal 
is 
a 
step 
towards 
the 
genus 
animal, 
which 
by 
the 
same 
process 
is 
a 
step 
towards 
a 
further 
generalization. 


Thus 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
we 
must 
get 
to 
know 
the 
primary 
premisses 
by 
induction; 
for 
the 
method 
by 
which 
even 
sense-perception 
implants 
the 
universal 
is 
inductive. 
Now 
of 
the 
thinking 
states 
by 
which 
we 
grasp 
truth, 
some 
are 
unfailingly 
true, 
others 
admit 
of 
error-opinion, 
for 
instance, 
and 
calculation, 
whereas 
scientific 
knowing 
and 
intuition 
are 
always 
true: 
further, 
no 
other 
kind 
of 
thought 
except 
intuition 
is 
more 
accurate 
than 
scientific 
knowledge, 
whereas 
primary 
premisses 
are 
more 
knowable 
than 
demonstrations, 
and 
all 
scientific 
knowledge 
is 
discursive. 
From 
these 
considerations 
it 
follows 
that 
there 
will 
be 
no 
scientific 
knowledge 
of 
the 
primary 
premisses, 
and 
since 
except 
intuition 
nothing 
can 
be 
truer 
than 
scientific 
knowledge, 
it 
will 
be 
intuition 
that 
apprehends 
the 
primary 
premisses-a 
result 
which 
also 
follows 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
demonstration 
cannot 
be 
the 
originative 
source 
of 
demonstration, 
nor, 
consequently, 
scientific 
knowledge 
of 
scientific 
knowledge.If, 
therefore, 
it 
is 
the 
only 
other 
kind 
of 
true 
thinking 
except 
scientific 
knowing, 
intuition 
will 
be 
the 
originative 
source 
of 
scientific 
knowledge. 
And 
the 
originative 
source 
of 
science 
grasps 
the 
original 
basic 
premiss, 
while 
science 
as 
a 
whole 
is 
similarly 
related 
as 
originative 
source 
to 
the 
whole 
body 
of 
fact. 



Topics, 
Book 
I 


Translated

Our 
treatise 
proposes 
to 
find 
a 
line 
of 
inquiry 
whereby 
we 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
reason 
from 
opinions 
that 
are 
generally 
accepted 
about 
every 
problem 
propounded 
to 
us, 
and 
also 
shall 
ourselves, 
when 
standing 
up 
to 
an 
argument, 
avoid 
saying 
anything 
that 
will 
obstruct 
us. 
First, 
then, 
we 
must 
say 
what 
reasoning 
is, 
and 
what 
its 
varieties 
are, 
in 
order 
to 
grasp 
dialectical 
reasoning: 
for 
this 
is 
the 
object 
of 
our 
search 
in 
the 
treatise 
before 
us. 


Now 
reasoning 
is 
an 
argument 
in 
which, 
certain 
things 
being 
laid 
down, 
something 
other 
than 
these 
necessarily 
comes 
about 
through 
them. 
(a) 
It 
is 
a 
‘demonstration’, 
when 
the 
premisses 
from 
which 
the 
reasoning 
starts 
are 
true 
and 
primary, 
or 
are 
such 
that 
our 
knowledge 
of 
them 
has 
originally 
come 
through 
premisses 
which 
are 
primary 
and 
true: 
(b) 
reasoning, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
is 
‘dialectical’, 
if 
it 
reasons 
from 
opinions 
that 
are 
generally 
accepted. 
Things 
are 
‘true’ 
and 
‘primary’ 
which 
are 
believed 
on 
the 
strength 
not 
of 
anything 
else 
but 
of 
themselves: 
for 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
first 
principles 
of 
science 
it 
is 
improper 
to 
ask 
any 
further 
for 
the 
why 
and 
wherefore 
of 
them; 
each 
of 
the 
first 
principles 
should 
command 
belief 
in 
and 
by 
itself. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
those 
opinions 
are 
‘generally 
accepted’ 
which 
are 
accepted 
by 
every 
one 
or 
by 
the 
majority 
or 
by 
the 
philosophers-i.e. 
by 
all, 
or 
by 
the 
majority, 
or 
by 
the 
most 
notable 
and 
illustrious 
of 
them. 
Again 
(c), 
reasoning 
is 
‘contentious’ 
if 
it 
starts 
from 
opinions 
that 
seem 
to 
be 
generally 
accepted, 
but 
are 
not 
really 
such, 
or 
again 
if 
it 
merely 
seems 
to 
reason 
from 
opinions 
that 
are 
or 
seem 
to 
be 
generally 
accepted. 
For 
not 
every 
opinion 
that 
seems 
to 
be 
generally 
accepted 
actually 
is 
generally 
accepted. 
For 
in 
none 
of 
the 
opinions 
which 
we 
call 
generally 
accepted 
is 
the 
illusion 
entirely 
on 
the 
surface, 
as 
happens 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
principles 
of 
contentious 
arguments; 
for 
the 
nature 
of 
the 



fallacy 
in 
these 
is 
obvious 
immediately, 
and 
as 
a 
rule 
even 
to 
persons 
with 
little 
power 
of 
comprehension. 
So 
then, 
of 
the 
contentious 
reasonings 
mentioned, 
the 
former 
really 
deserves 
to 
be 
called 
‘reasoning’ 
as 
well, 
but 
the 
other 
should 
be 
called 
‘contentious 
reasoning’, 
but 
not 
‘reasoning’, 
since 
it 
appears 
to 
reason, 
but 
does 
not 
really 
do 
so. 
Further 
(d), 
besides 
all 
the 
reasonings 
we 
have 
mentioned 
there 
are 
the 
mis-reasonings 
that 
start 
from 
the 
premisses 
peculiar 
to 
the 
special 
sciences, 
as 
happens 
(for 
example) 
in 
the 
case 
of 
geometry 
and 
her 
sister 
sciences. 
For 
this 
form 
of 
reasoning 
appears 
to 
differ 
from 
the 
reasonings 
mentioned 
above; 
the 
man 
who 
draws 
a 
false 
figure 
reasons 
from 
things 
that 
are 
neither 
true 
and 
primary, 
nor 
yet 
generally 
accepted. 
For 
he 
does 
not 
fall 
within 
the 
definition; 
he 
does 
not 
assume 
opinions 
that 
are 
received 
either 
by 
every 
one 
or 
by 
the 
majority 
or 
by 
philosophers-that 
is 
to 
say, 
by 
all, 
or 
by 
most, 
or 
by 
the 
most 
illustrious 
of 
them-but 
he 
conducts 
his 
reasoning 
upon 
assumptions 
which, 
though 
appropriate 
to 
the 
science 
in 
question, 
are 
not 
true; 
for 
he 
effects 
his 
mis-
reasoning 
either 
by 
describing 
the 
semicircles 
wrongly 
or 
by 
drawing 
certain 
lines 
in 
a 
way 
in 
which 
they 
could 
not 
be 
drawn. 


The 
foregoing 
must 
stand 
for 
an 
outline 
survey 
of 
the 
species 
of 
reasoning. 
In 
general, 
in 
regard 
both 
to 
all 
that 
we 
have 
already 
discussed 
and 
to 
those 
which 
we 
shall 
discuss 
later, 
we 
may 
remark 
that 
that 
amount 
of 
distinction 
between 
them 
may 
serve, 
because 
it 
is 
not 
our 
purpose 
to 
give 
the 
exact 
definition 
of 
any 
of 
them; 
we 
merely 
want 
to 
describe 
them 
in 
outline; 
we 
consider 
it 
quite 
enough 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
line 
of 
inquiry 
before 
us 
to 
be 
able 
to 
recognize 
each 
of 
them 
in 
some 
sort 
of 
way. 


Next 
in 
order 
after 
the 
foregoing, 
we 
must 
say 
for 
how 
many 
and 
for 
what 
purposes 
the 
treatise 
is 
useful. 
They 
are 
three-intellectual 
training, 
casual 
encounters, 
and 
the 
philosophical 
sciences. 
That 
it 
is 
useful 
as 
a 
training 
is 
obvious 
on 
the 
face 
of 
it. 
The 
possession 
of 
a 
plan 
of 
inquiry 
will 
enable 
us 
more 
easily 
to 
argue 
about 
the 
subject 
proposed. 
For 
purposes 
of 
casual 
encounters, 
it 
is 
useful 
because 
when 
we 
have 
counted 
up 
the 
opinions 
held 
by 
most 
people, 
we 
shall 
meet 
them 
on 
the 
ground 
not 
of 
other 
people’s 
convictions 
but 
of 
their 
own, 
while 
we 
shift 
the 
ground 
of 
any 
argument 
that 
they 
appear 
to 
us 
to 
state 
unsoundly. 
For 
the 
study 
of 
the 
philosophical 



sciences 
it 
is 
useful, 
because 
the 
ability 
to 
raise 
searching 
difficulties 
on 
both 
sides 
of 
a 
subject 
will 
make 
us 
detect 
more 
easily 
the 
truth 
and 
error 
about 
the 
several 
points 
that 
arise. 
It 
has 
a 
further 
use 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
ultimate 
bases 
of 
the 
principles 
used 
in 
the 
several 
sciences. 
For 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
discuss 
them 
at 
all 
from 
the 
principles 
proper 
to 
the 
particular 
science 
in 
hand, 
seeing 
that 
the 
principles 
are 
the 
prius 
of 
everything 
else: 
it 
is 
through 
the 
opinions 
generally 
held 
on 
the 
particular 
points 
that 
these 
have 
to 
be 
discussed, 
and 
this 
task 
belongs 
properly, 
or 
most 
appropriately, 
to 
dialectic: 
for 
dialectic 
is 
a 
process 
of 
criticism 
wherein 
lies 
the 
path 
to 
the 
principles 
of 
all 
inquiries.

Of 
problems 
some 
are 
universal, 
others 
particular. 
Universal 
problems 
are 
such 
as 
‘Every 
pleasure 
is 
good’ 
and 
‘No 
pleasure 
is 
good’; 
particular 
problems 
are 
such 
as 
‘Some 
pleasure 
is 
good’ 
and 
‘Some 
pleasure 
is 
not 
good’. 
The 
methods 
of 
establishing 
and 
overthrowing 
a 
view 
universally 
are 
common 
to 
both 
kinds 
of 
problems; 
for 
when 
we 
have 
shown 
that 
a 
predicate 
belongs 
in 
every 
case, 
we 
shall 
also 
have 
shown 
that 
it 
belongs 
in 
some 
cases. 
Likewise, 
also, 
if 
we 
show 
that 
it 
does 
not 
belong 
in 
any 
case, 
we 
shall 
also 
have 
shown 
that 
it 
does 
not 
belong 
in 
every 
case. 
First, 
then, 
we 
must 
speak 
of 
the 
methods 
of 
overthrowing 
a 
view 
universally, 
because 
such 
are 
common 
to 
both 
universal 
and 
particular 
problems, 
and 
because 
people 
more 
usually 
introduce 
theses 
asserting 
a 
predicate 
than 
denying 
it, 
while 
those 
who 
argue 
with 
them 
overthrow 
it. 
The 
conversion 
of 
an 
appropriate 
name 
which 
is 
drawn 
from 
the 
element 
‘accident’ 
is 
an 
extremely 
precarious 
thing; 
for 
in 
the 
case 
of 
accidents 
and 
in 
no 
other 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
something 
to 
be 
true 
conditionally 
and 
not 
universally. 
Names 
drawn 
from 
the 
elements 
‘definition’ 
and 
‘property’ 
and 
‘genus’ 
are 
bound 
to 
be 
convertible; 
e.g. 
if 
‘to 
be 
an 
animal 
that 
walks 
on 
two 
feet 
is 
an 
attribute 
of 
S’, 
then 
it 
will 
be 
true 
by 
conversion 
to 
say 
that 
‘S 
is 
an 
animal 
that 
walks 
on 
two 
feet’. 
Likewise, 
also, 
if 
drawn 
from 
the 
genus; 
for 
if 
‘to 
be 
an 
animal 
is 
an 
attribute 
of 
S’, 
then 
‘S 
is 
an 
animal’. 
The 
same 
is 
true 
also 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
property; 
for 
if 
‘to 
be 
capable 
of 
learning 
grammar 
is 
an 
attribute 
of 
S’, 
then 
‘S 
will 
be 
capable 
of 
learning 
grammar’. 
For 
none 
of 
these 
attributes 
can 
possibly 
belong 
or 
not 
belong 
in 
part; 
they 
must 
either 
belong 
or 
not 
belong 
absolutely. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
accidents, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
there 
is 
nothing 
to 
prevent 
an 
attribute 
(e.g. 
whiteness 
or 
justice) 
belonging 
in 
part, 
so 
that 
it 
is 
not 
enough 
to 
show 
that 
whiteness 
or 
justice 
is 
an 
attribute 
of 
a 
man 
in 
order 
to 
show 
that 
he 
is 
white 



or 
just; 
for 
it 
is 
open 
to 
dispute 
it 
and 
say 
that 
he 
is 
white 
or 
just 
in 
part 
only. 
Conversion, 
then, 
is 
not 
a 
necessary 
process 
in 
the 
case 
of 
accidents. 


We 
must 
also 
define 
the 
errors 
that 
occur 
in 
problems. 
They 
are 
of 
two 
kinds, 
caused 
either 
by 
false 
statement 
or 
by 
transgression 
of 
the 
established 
diction. 
For 
those 
who 
make 
false 
statements, 
and 
say 
that 
an 
attribute 
belongs 
to 
thing 
which 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
it, 
commit 
error; 
and 
those 
who 
call 
objects 
by 
the 
names 
of 
other 
objects 
(e.g. 
calling 
a 
planetree 
a 
‘man’) 
transgress 
the 
established 
terminology. 
< 


div 
id="section20" 
class="section" 
title="2"> 


Now 
one 
commonplace 
rule 
is 
to 
look 
and 
see 
if 
a 
man 
has 
ascribed 
as 
an 
accident 
what 
belongs 
in 
some 
other 
way. 
This 
mistake 
is 
most 
commonly 
made 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
genera 
of 
things, 
e.g. 
if 
one 
were 
to 
say 
that 
white 
happens 
(accidit) 
to 
be 
a 
colour-for 
being 
a 
colour 
does 
not 
happen 
by 
accident 
to 
white, 
but 
colour 
is 
its 
genus. 
The 
assertor 
may 
of 
course 
define 
it 
so 
in 
so 
many 
words, 
saying 
(e.g.) 
that 
‘Justice 
happens 
(accidit) 
to 
be 
a 
virtue’; 
but 
often 
even 
without 
such 
definition 
it 
is 
obvious 
that 
he 
has 
rendered 
the 
genus 
as 
an 
accident; 
e.g. 
suppose 
that 
one 
were 
to 
say 
that 
whiteness 
is 
coloured 
or 
that 
walking 
is 
in 
motion. 
For 
a 
predicate 
drawn 
from 
the 
genus 
is 
never 
ascribed 
to 
the 
species 
in 
an 
inflected 
form, 
but 
always 
the 
genera 
are 
predicated 
of 
their 
species 
literally; 
for 
the 
species 
take 
on 
both 
the 
name 
and 
the 
definition 
of 
their 
genera. 
A 
man 
therefore 
who 
says 
that 
white 
is 
‘coloured’ 
has 
not 
rendered 
‘coloured’ 
as 
its 
genus, 
seeing 
that 
he 
has 
used 
an 
inflected 
form, 
nor 
yet 
as 
its 
property 
or 
as 
its 
definition: 
for 
the 
definition 
and 
property 
of 
a 
thing 
belong 
to 
it 
and 
to 
nothing 
else, 
whereas 
many 
things 
besides 
white 
are 
coloured, 
e.g. 
a 
log, 
a 
stone, 
a 
man, 
and 
a 
horse. 
Clearly 
then 
he 
renders 
it 
as 
an 
accident. 


Another 
rule 
is 
to 
examine 
all 
cases 
where 
a 
predicate 
has 
been 
either 
asserted 
or 
denied 
universally 
to 
belong 
to 
something. 
Look 
at 
them 
species 
by 
species, 
and 
not 
in 
their 
infinite 
multitude: 
for 
then 
the 
inquiry 
will 
proceed 
more 
directly 
and 
in 
fewer 
steps. 
You 
should 
look 
and 
begin 
with 
the 
most 
primary 
groups, 
and 
then 
proceed 
in 
order 
down 
to 
those 
that 
are 
not 
further 
divisible: 
e.g. 
if 
a 
man 
has 
said 
that 
the 
knowledge 
of 
opposites 
is 
the 
same, 
you 
should 
look 
and 
see 
whether 
it 
be 
so 
of 
relative 
opposites 
and 
of 



contraries 
and 
of 
terms 
signifying 
the 
privation 
or 
presence 
of 
certain 
states, 
and 
of 
contradictory 
terms. 
Then, 
if 
no 
clear 
result 
be 
reached 
so 
far 
in 
these 
cases, 
you 
should 
again 
divide 
these 
until 
you 
come 
to 
those 
that 
are 
not 
further 
divisible, 
and 
see 
(e.g.) 
whether 
it 
be 
so 
of 
just 
deeds 
and 
unjust, 
or 
of 
the 
double 
and 
the 
half, 
or 
of 
blindness 
and 
sight, 
or 
of 
being 
and 
not-being: 
for 
if 
in 
any 
case 
it 
be 
shown 
that 
the 
knowledge 
of 
them 
is 
not 
the 
same 
we 
shall 
have 
demolished 
the 
problem. 
Likewise, 
also, 
if 
the 
predicate 
belongs 
in 
no 
case. 
This 
rule 
is 
convertible 
for 
both 
destructive 
and 
constructive 
purposes: 
for 
if, 
when 
we 
have 
suggested 
a 
division, 
the 
predicate 
appears 
to 
hold 
in 
all 
or 
in 
a 
large 
number 
of 
cases, 
we 
may 
then 
claim 
that 
the 
other 
should 
actually 
assert 
it 
universally, 
or 
else 
bring 
a 
negative 
instance 
to 
show 
in 
what 
case 
it 
is 
not 
so: 
for 
if 
he 
does 
neither 
of 
these 
things, 
a 
refusal 
to 
assert 
it 
will 
make 
him 
look 
absurd. 


Another 
rule 
is 
to 
make 
definitions 
both 
of 
an 
accident 
and 
of 
its 
subject, 
either 
of 
both 
separately 
or 
else 
of 
one 
of 
them, 
and 
then 
look 
and 
see 
if 
anything 
untrue 
has 
been 
assumed 
as 
true 
in 
the 
definitions. 
Thus 
(e.g.) 
to 
see 
if 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
wrong 
a 
god, 
ask 
what 
is 
‘to 
wrong’? 
For 
if 
it 
be 
‘to 
injure 
deliberately’, 
clearly 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
for 
a 
god 
to 
be 
wronged: 
for 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
God 
should 
be 
injured. 
Again, 
to 
see 
if 
the 
good 
man 
is 
jealous, 
ask 
who 
is 
the 
‘jealous’ 
man 
and 
what 
is 
‘jealousy’. 
For 
if 
‘jealousy’ 
is 
pain 
at 
the 
apparent 
success 
of 
some 
well-behaved 
person, 
clearly 
the 
good 
man 
is 
not 
jealous: 
for 
then 
he 
would 
be 
bad. 
Again, 
to 
see 
if 
the 
indignant 
man 
is 
jealous, 
ask 
who 
each 
of 
them 
is: 
for 
then 
it 
will 
be 
obvious 
whether 
the 
statement 
is 
true 
or 
false; 
e.g. 
if 
he 
is 
‘jealous’ 
who 
grieves 
at 
the 
successes 
of 
the 
good, 
and 
he 
is 
‘indignant’ 
who 
grieves 
at 
the 
successes 
of 
the 
evil, 
then 
clearly 
the 
indignant 
man 
would 
not 
be 
jealous. 
A 
man 
should 
substitute 
definitions 
also 
for 
the 
terms 
contained 
in 
his 
definitions, 
and 
not 
stop 
until 
he 
comes 
to 
a 
familiar 
term: 
for 
often 
if 
the 
definition 
be 
rendered 
whole, 
the 
point 
at 
issue 
is 
not 
cleared 
up, 
whereas 
if 
for 
one 
of 
the 
terms 
used 
in 
the 
definition 
a 
definition 
be 
stated, 
it 
becomes 
obvious. 


Moreover, 
a 
man 
should 
make 
the 
problem 
into 
a 
proposition 
for 
himself, 
and 
then 
bring 
a 
negative 
instance 
against 
it: 
for 
the 
negative 
instance 
will 
be 
a 
ground 
of 
attack 
upon 
the 
assertion. 
This 
rule 
is 
very 
nearly 
the 
same 
as 
the 
rule 
to 
look 
into 
cases 
where 
a 
predicate 
has 
been 
attributed 
or 
denied 
universally: 
but 
it 
differs 
in 
the 
turn 
of 
the 
argument. 


Moreover, 
you 
should 
define 
what 
kind 
of 
things 
should 
be 
called 
as 
most 
men 
call 
them, 
and 
what 
should 
not. 
For 
this 
is 
useful 
both 
for 
establishing 



and 
for 
overthrowing 
a 
view: 
e.g. 
you 
should 
say 
that 
we 
ought 
to 
use 
our 
terms 
to 
mean 
the 
same 
things 
as 
most 
people 
mean 
by 
them, 
but 
when 
we 
ask 
what 
kind 
of 
things 
are 
or 
are 
not 
of 
such 
and 
such 
a 
kind, 
we 
should 
not 
here 
go 
with 
the 
multitude: 
e.g. 
it 
is 
right 
to 
call 
‘healthy’ 
whatever 
tends 
to 
produce 
health, 
as 
do 
most 
men: 
but 
in 
saying 
whether 
the 
object 
before 
us 
tends 
to 
produce 
health 
or 
not, 
we 
should 
adopt 
the 
language 
no 
longer 
of 
the 
multitude 
but 
of 
the 
doctor. 
< 


div 
id="section21" 
class="section" 
title="3"> 


Moreover, 
if 
a 
term 
be 
used 
in 
several 
senses, 
and 
it 
has 
been 
laid 
down 
that 
it 
is 
or 
that 
it 
is 
not 
an 
attribute 
of 
S, 
you 
should 
show 
your 
case 
of 
one 
of 
its 
several 
senses, 
if 
you 
cannot 
show 
it 
of 
both. 
This 
rule 
is 
to 
be 
observed 
in 
cases 
where 
the 
difference 
of 
meaning 
is 
undetected; 
for 
supposing 
this 
to 
be 
obvious, 
then 
the 
other 
man 
will 
object 
that 
the 
point 
which 
he 
himself 
questioned 
has 
not 
been 
discussed, 
but 
only 
the 
other 
point. 
This 
commonplace 
rule 
is 
convertible 
for 
purposes 
both 
of 
establishing 
and 
of 
overthrowing 
a 
view. 
For 
if 
we 
want 
to 
establish 
a 
statement, 
we 
shall 
show 
that 
in 
one 
sense 
the 
attribute 
belongs, 
if 
we 
cannot 
show 
it 
of 
both 
senses: 
whereas 
if 
we 
are 
overthrowing 
a 
statement, 
we 
shall 
show 
that 
in 
one 
sense 
the 
attribute 
does 
not 
belong, 
if 
we 
cannot 
show 
it 
of 
both 
senses. 
Of 
course, 
in 
overthrowing 
a 
statement 
there 
is 
no 
need 
to 
start 
the 
discussion 
by 
securing 
any 
admission, 
either 
when 
the 
statement 
asserts 
or 
when 
it 
denies 
the 
attribute 
universally: 
for 
if 
we 
show 
that 
in 
any 
case 
whatever 
the 
attribute 
does 
not 
belong, 
we 
shall 
have 
demolished 
the 
universal 
assertion 
of 
it, 
and 
likewise 
also 
if 
we 
show 
that 
it 
belongs 
in 
a 
single 
case, 
we 
shall 
demolish 
the 
universal 
denial 
of 
it. 
Whereas 
in 
establishing 
a 
statement 
we 
ought 
to 
secure 
a 
preliminary 
admission 
that 
if 
it 
belongs 
in 
any 
case 
whatever, 
it 
belongs 
universally, 
supposing 
this 
claim 
to 
be 
a 
plausible 
one. 
For 
it 
is 
not 
enough 
to 
discuss 
a 
single 
instance 
in 
order 
to 
show 
that 
an 
attribute 
belongs 
universally; 
e.g. 
to 
argue 
that 
if 
the 
soul 
of 
man 
be 
immortal, 
then 
every 
soul 
is 
immortal, 
so 
that 
a 
previous 
admission 
must 
be 
secured 
that 
if 
any 
soul 
whatever 
be 
immortal, 
then 
every 
soul 
is 
immortal. 
This 
is 
not 
to 
be 
done 
in 
every 
case, 
but 
only 
whenever 
we 
are 
not 
easily 
able 
to 
quote 
any 
single 
argument 
applying 
to 
all 
cases 
in 
common, 
as 
(e.g.) 
the 



geometrician 
can 
argue 
that 
the 
triangle 
has 
its 
angles 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles. 


If, 
again, 
the 
variety 
of 
meanings 
of 
a 
term 
be 
obvious, 
distinguish 
how 
many 
meanings 
it 
has 
before 
proceeding 
either 
to 
demolish 
or 
to 
establish 
it: 


e.g. 
supposing 
‘the 
right’ 
to 
mean 
‘the 
expedient’ 
or 
‘the 
honourable’, 
you 
should 
try 
either 
to 
establish 
or 
to 
demolish 
both 
descriptions 
of 
the 
subject 
in 
question; 
e.g. 
by 
showing 
that 
it 
is 
honourable 
and 
expedient, 
or 
that 
it 
is 
neither 
honourable 
nor 
expedient. 
Supposing, 
however, 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
show 
both, 
you 
should 
show 
the 
one, 
adding 
an 
indication 
that 
it 
is 
true 
in 
the 
one 
sense 
and 
not 
in 
the 
other. 
The 
same 
rule 
applies 
also 
when 
the 
number 
of 
senses 
into 
which 
it 
is 
divided 
is 
more 
than 
two. 
Again, 
consider 
those 
expressions 
whose 
meanings 
are 
many, 
but 
differ 
not 
by 
way 
of 
ambiguity 
of 
a 
term, 
but 
in 
some 
other 
way: 
e.g. 
‘The 
science 
of 
many 
things 
is 
one’: 
here 
‘many 
things’ 
may 
mean 
the 
end 
and 
the 
means 
to 
that 
end, 
as 
(e.g.) 
medicine 
is 
the 
science 
both 
of 
producing 
health 
and 
of 
dieting; 
or 
they 
may 
be 
both 
of 
them 
ends, 
as 
the 
science 
of 
contraries 
is 
said 
to 
be 
the 
same 
(for 
of 
contraries 
the 
one 
is 
no 
more 
an 
end 
than 
the 
other); 
or 
again 
they 
may 
be 
an 
essential 
and 
an 
accidental 
attribute, 
as 
(e.g.) 
the 
essential 
fact 
that 
the 
triangle 
has 
its 
angles 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles, 
and 
the 
accidental 
fact 
that 
the 
equilateral 
figure 
has 
them 
so: 
for 
it 
is 
because 
of 
the 
accident 
of 
the 
equilateral 
triangle 
happening 
to 
be 
a 
triangle 
that 
we 
know 
that 
it 
has 
its 
angles 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles. 
If, 
then, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
in 
any 
sense 
of 
the 
term 
that 
the 
science 
of 
many 
things 
should 
be 
the 
same, 
it 
clearly 
is 
altogether 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
be 
so; 
or, 
if 
it 
is 
possible 
in 
some 
sense, 
then 
clearly 
it 
is 
possible. 
Distinguish 
as 
many 
meanings 
as 
are 
required: 
e.g. 
if 
we 
want 
to 
establish 
a 
view, 
we 
should 
bring 
forward 
all 
such 
meanings 
as 
admit 
that 
view 
and 
should 
divide 
them 
only 
into 
those 
meanings 
which 
also 
are 
required 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
our 
case: 
whereas 
if 
we 
want 
to 
overthrow 
a 
view, 
we 
should 
bring 
forward 
all 
that 
do 
not 
admit 
that 
view, 
and 
leave 
the 
rest 
aside. 
We 
must 
deal 
also 
in 
these 
cases 
as 
well 
with 
any 
uncertainty 
about 
the 
number 
of 
meanings 
involved. 
Further, 
that 
one 
thing 
is, 
or 
is 
not, 
‘of’ 
another 
should 
be 
established 
by 
means 
of 
the 
same 
commonplace 
rules; 
e.g. 
that 
a 
particular 
science 
is 
of 
a 
particular 
thing, 
treated 
either 
as 
an 
end 
or 
as 
a 
means 
to 
its 
end, 
or 
as 
accidentally 
connected 
with 
it; 
or 
again 
that 
it 
is 
not 
‘of’ 
it 
in 
any 
of 
the 
aforesaid 
ways. 
The 
same 
rule 
holds 
true 
also 
of 
desire 
and 
all 
other 
terms 
that 
have 
more 
than 
one 
object. 
For 
the 
‘desire 
of 
X’ 
may 
mean 
the 
desire 
of 
it 
as 
an 
end 
(e.g. 
the 



desire 
of 
health) 
or 
as 
a 
means 
to 
an 
end 
(e.g. 
the 
desire 
of 
being 
doctored), 
or 
as 
a 
thing 
desired 
accidentally, 
as, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
wine, 
the 
sweet-toothed 
person 
desires 
it 
not 
because 
it 
is 
wine 
but 
because 
it 
is 
sweet. 
For 
essentially 
he 
desires 
the 
sweet, 
and 
only 
accidentally 
the 
wine: 
for 
if 
it 
be 
dry, 
he 
no 
longer 
desires 
it. 
His 
desire 
for 
it 
is 
therefore 
accidental. 
This 
rule 
is 
useful 
in 
dealing 
with 
relative 
terms: 
for 
cases 
of 
this 
kind 
are 
generally 
cases 
of 
relative 
terms. 
< 


div 
id="section22" 
class="section" 
title="4"> 


Moreover, 
it 
is 
well 
to 
alter 
a 
term 
into 
one 
more 
familiar, 
e.g. 
to 
substitute 
‘clear’ 
for 
‘exact’ 
in 
describing 
a 
conception, 
and 
‘being 
fussy’ 
for 
‘being 
busy’: 
for 
when 
the 
expression 
is 
made 
more 
familiar, 
the 
thesis 
becomes 
easier 
to 
attack. 
This 
commonplace 
rule 
also 
is 
available 
for 
both 
purposes 
alike, 
both 
for 
establishing 
and 
for 
overthrowing 
a 
view. 


In 
order 
to 
show 
that 
contrary 
attributes 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
thing, 
look 
at 
its 
genus; 
e.g. 
if 
we 
want 
to 
show 
that 
rightness 
and 
wrongness 
are 
possible 
in 
regard 
to 
perception, 
and 
to 
perceive 
is 
to 
judge, 
while 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
judge 
rightly 
or 
wrongly, 
then 
in 
regard 
to 
perception 
as 
well 
rightness 
and 
wrongness 
must 
be 
possible. 
In 
the 
present 
instance 
the 
proof 
proceeds 
from 
the 
genus 
and 
relates 
to 
the 
species: 
for 
‘to 
judge’ 
is 
the 
genus 
of 
‘to 
— 
perceive’; 
for 
the 
man 
who 
perceives 
judges 
in 
a 
certain 
way. 
But 
per 
contra 
it 
may 
proceed 
from 
the 
species 
to 
the 
genus: 
for 
all 
the 
attributes 
that 
belong 
to 
the 
species 
belong 
to 
the 
genus 
as 
well; 
e.g. 
if 
there 
is 
a 
bad 
and 
a 
good 
knowledge 
there 
is 
also 
a 
bad 
and 
a 
good 
disposition: 
for 
‘disposition’ 
is 
the 
genus 
of 
knowledge. 
Now 
the 
former 
commonplace 
argument 
is 
fallacious 
for 
purposes 
of 
establishing 
a 
view, 
while 
the 
second 
is 
true. 
For 
there 
is 
no 
necessity 
that 
all 
the 
attributes 
that 
belong 
to 
the 
genus 
should 
belong 
also 
to 
the 
species; 
for 
‘animal’ 
is 
flying 
and 
quadruped, 
but 
not 
so 
‘man’. 
All 
the 
attributes, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
that 
belong 
to 
the 
species 
must 
of 
necessity 
belong 
also 
to 
the 
genus; 
for 
if 
‘man’ 
is 
good, 
then 
animal 
also 
is 
good. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
for 
purposes 
of 
overthrowing 
a 
view, 
the 
former 
argument 
is 
true 
while 
the 
latter 
is 
fallacious; 
for 
all 
the 
attributes 
which 
do 
not 
belong 
to 
the 
genus 
do 
not 
belong 
to 
the 
species 
either; 
whereas 
all 
those 
that 
are 
wanting 
to 
the 
species 
are 
not 
of 
necessity 
wanting 
to 
the 
genus. 



Since 
those 
things 
of 
which 
the 
genus 
is 
predicated 
must 
also 
of 
necessity 
have 
one 
of 
its 
species 
predicated 
of 
them, 
and 
since 
those 
things 
that 
are 
possessed 
of 
the 
genus 
in 
question, 
or 
are 
described 
by 
terms 
derived 
from 
that 
genus, 
must 
also 
of 
necessity 
be 
possessed 
of 
one 
of 
its 
species 
or 
be 
described 
by 
terms 
derived 
from 
one 
of 
its 
species 
(e.g. 
if 
to 
anything 
the 
term 
‘scientific 
knowledge’ 
be 
applied, 
then 
also 
there 
will 
be 
applied 
to 
it 
the 
term 
‘grammatical’ 
or 
‘musical’ 
knowledge, 
or 
knowledge 
of 
one 
of 
the 
other 
sciences; 
and 
if 
any 
one 
possesses 
scientific 
knowledge 
or 
is 
described 
by 
a 
term 
derived 
from 
‘science’, 
then 
he 
will 
also 
possess 
grammatical 
or 
musical 
knowledge 
or 
knowledge 
of 
one 
of 
the 
other 
sciences, 
or 
will 
be 
described 
by 
a 
term 
derived 
from 
one 
of 
them, 
e.g. 
as 
a 
‘grammarian’ 
or 
a 
‘musician’)-therefore 
if 
any 
expression 
be 
asserted 
that 
is 
in 
any 
way 
derived 
from 
the 
genus 
(e.g. 
that 
the 
soul 
is 
in 
motion), 
look 
and 
see 
whether 
it 
be 
possible 
for 
the 
soul 
to 
be 
moved 
with 
any 
of 
the 
species 
of 
motion; 
whether 
(e.g.) 
it 
can 
grow 
or 
be 
destroyed 
or 
come 
to 
be, 
and 
so 
forth 
with 
all 
the 
other 
species 
of 
motion. 
For 
if 
it 
be 
not 
moved 
in 
any 
of 
these 
ways, 
clearly 
it 
does 
not 
move 
at 
all. 
This 
commonplace 
rule 
is 
common 
for 
both 
purposes, 
both 
for 
overthrowing 
and 
for 
establishing 
a 
view: 
for 
if 
the 
soul 
moves 
with 
one 
of 
the 
species 
of 
motion, 
clearly 
it 
does 
move; 
while 
if 
it 
does 
not 
move 
with 
any 
of 
the 
species 
of 
motion, 
clearly 
it 
does 
not 
move. 


If 
you 
are 
not 
well 
equipped 
with 
an 
argument 
against 
the 
assertion, 
look 
among 
the 
definitions, 
real 
or 
apparent, 
of 
the 
thing 
before 
you, 
and 
if 
one 
is 
not 
enough, 
draw 
upon 
several. 
For 
it 
will 
be 
easier 
to 
attack 
people 
when 
committed 
to 
a 
definition: 
for 
an 
attack 
is 
always 
more 
easily 
made 
on 
definitions. 


Moreover, 
look 
and 
see 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
thing 
in 
question, 
what 
it 
is 
whose 
reality 
conditions 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
thing 
in 
question, 
or 
what 
it 
is 
whose 
reality 
necessarily 
follows 
if 
the 
thing 
in 
question 
be 
real: 
if 
you 
wish 
to 
establish 
a 
view 
inquire 
what 
there 
is 
on 
whose 
reality 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
thing 
in 
question 
will 
follow 
(for 
if 
the 
former 
be 
shown 
to 
be 
real, 
then 
the 
thing 
in 
question 
will 
also 
have 
been 
shown 
to 
be 
real); 
while 
if 
you 
want 
to 
overthrow 
a 
view, 
ask 
what 
it 
is 
that 
is 
real 
if 
the 
thing 
in 
question 
be 
real, 
for 
if 
we 
show 
that 
what 
follows 
from 
the 
thing 
in 
question 
is 
unreal, 
we 
shall 
have 
demolished 
the 
thing 
in 
question. 


Moreover, 
look 
at 
the 
time 
involved, 
to 
see 
if 
there 
be 
any 
discrepancy 
anywhere: 
e.g. 
suppose 
a 
man 
to 
have 
stated 
that 
what 
is 
being 
nourished 
of 
necessity 
grows: 
for 
animals 
are 
always 
of 
necessity 
being 
nourished, 
but 



they 
do 
not 
always 
grow. 
Likewise, 
also, 
if 
he 
has 
said 
that 
knowing 
is 
remembering: 
for 
the 
one 
is 
concerned 
with 
past 
time, 
whereas 
the 
other 
has 
to 
do 
also 
with 
the 
present 
and 
the 
future. 
For 
we 
are 
said 
to 
know 
things 
present 
and 
future 
(e.g. 
that 
there 
will 
be 
an 
eclipse), 
whereas 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
remember 
anything 
save 
what 
is 
in 
the 
past.

Moreover, 
there 
is 
the 
sophistic 
turn 
of 
argument, 
whereby 
we 
draw 
our 
opponent 
into 
the 
kind 
of 
statement 
against 
which 
we 
shall 
be 
well 
supplied 
with 
lines 
of 
argument. 
This 
process 
is 
sometimes 
a 
real 
necessity, 
sometimes 
an 
apparent 
necessity, 
sometimes 
neither 
an 
apparent 
nor 
a 
real 
necessity. 
It 
is 
really 
necessary 
whenever 
the 
answerer 
has 
denied 
any 
view 
that 
would 
be 
useful 
in 
attacking 
the 
thesis, 
and 
the 
questioner 
thereupon 
addresses 
his 
arguments 
to 
the 
support 
of 
this 
view, 
and 
when 
moreover 
the 
view 
in 
question 
happens 
to 
be 
one 
of 
a 
kind 
on 
which 
he 
has 
a 
good 
stock 
of 
lines 
of 
argument. 
Likewise, 
also, 
it 
is 
really 
necessary 
whenever 
he 
(the 
questioner) 
first, 
by 
an 
induction 
made 
by 
means 
of 
the 
view 
laid 
down, 
arrives 
at 
a 
certain 
statement 
and 
then 
tries 
to 
demolish 
that 
statement: 
for 
when 
once 
this 
has 
been 
demolished, 
the 
view 
originally 
laid 
down 
is 
demolished 
as 
well. 
It 
is 
an 
apparent 
necessity, 
when 
the 
point 
to 
which 
the 
discussion 
comes 
to 
be 
directed 
appears 
to 
be 
useful, 
and 
relevant 
to 
the 
thesis, 
without 
being 
really 
so; 
whether 
it 
be 
that 
the 
man 
who 
is 
standing 
up 
to 
the 
argument 
has 
refused 
to 
concede 
something, 
or 
whether 
he 
(the 
questioner) 
has 
first 
reached 
it 
by 
a 
plausible 
induction 
based 
upon 
the 
thesis 
and 
then 
tries 
to 
demolish 
it. 
The 
remaining 
case 
is 
when 
the 
point 
to 
which 
the 
discussion 
comes 
to 
be 
directed 
is 
neither 
really 
nor 
apparently 
necessary, 
and 
it 
is 
the 
answerer’s 
luck 
to 
be 
confuted 
on 
a 
mere 
side 
issue 
You 
should 
beware 
of 
the 
last 
of 
the 
aforesaid 
methods; 
for 
it 
appears 
to 
be 
wholly 
disconnected 
from, 
and 
foreign 
to, 
the 
art 
of 
dialectic. 
For 
this 
reason, 
moreover, 
the 
answerer 
should 
not 
lose 
his 
temper, 
but 
assent 
to 
those 
statements 
that 
are 
of 
no 
use 
in 
attacking 
the 
thesis, 
adding 
an 
indication 
whenever 
he 
assents 
although 
he 
does 
not 
agree 
with 
the 
view. 
For, 
as 
a 
rule, 
it 
increases 
the 
confusion 
of 
questioners 
if, 
after 
all 
propositions 
of 
this 
kind 
have 
been 
granted 
them, 
they 
can 
then 
draw 
no 
conclusion. 



Moreover, 
any 
one 
who 
has 
made 
any 
statement 
whatever 
has 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
made 
several 
statements, 
inasmuch 
as 
each 
statement 
has 
a 
number 
of 
necessary 
consequences: 
e.g. 
the 
man 
who 
said 
‘X 
is 
a 
man’ 
has 
also 
said 
that 
it 
is 
an 
animal 
and 
that 
it 
is 
animate 
and 
a 
biped 
and 
capable 
of 
acquiring 
reason 
and 
knowledge, 
so 
that 
by 
the 
demolition 
of 
any 
single 
one 
of 
these 
consequences, 
of 
whatever 
kind, 
the 
original 
statement 
is 
demolished 
as 
well. 
But 
you 
should 
beware 
here 
too 
of 
making 
a 
change 
to 
a 
more 
difficult 
subject: 
for 
sometimes 
the 
consequence, 
and 
sometimes 
the 
original 
thesis, 
is 
the 
easier 
to 
demolish. 
< 


div 
id="section24" 
class="section" 
title="6"> 


In 
regard 
to 
subjects 
which 
must 
have 
one 
and 
one 
only 
of 
two 
predicates, 
as 
(e.g.) 
a 
man 
must 
have 
either 
a 
disease 
or 
health, 
supposing 
we 
are 
well 
supplied 
as 
regards 
the 
one 
for 
arguing 
its 
presence 
or 
absence, 
we 
shall 
be 
well 
equipped 
as 
regards 
the 
remaining 
one 
as 
well. 
This 
rule 
is 
convertible 
for 
both 
purposes: 
for 
when 
we 
have 
shown 
that 
the 
one 
attribute 
belongs, 
we 
shall 
have 
shown 
that 
the 
remaining 
one 
does 
not 
belong; 
while 
if 
we 
show 
that 
the 
one 
does 
not 
belong, 
we 
shall 
have 
shown 
that 
the 
remaining 
one 
does 
belong. 
Clearly 
then 
the 
rule 
is 
useful 
for 
both 
purposes. 


Moreover, 
you 
may 
devise 
a 
line 
of 
attack 
by 
reinterpreting 
a 
term 
in 
its 
literal 
meaning, 
with 
the 
implication 
that 
it 
is 
most 
fitting 
so 
to 
take 
it 
rather 
than 
in 
its 
established 
meaning: 
e.g. 
the 
expression 
‘strong 
at 
heart’ 
will 
suggest 
not 
the 
courageous 
man, 
according 
to 
the 
use 
now 
established, 
but 
the 
man 
the 
state 
of 
whose 
heart 
is 
strong; 
just 
as 
also 
the 
expression 
‘of 
a 
good 
hope’ 
may 
be 
taken 
to 
mean 
the 
man 
who 
hopes 
for 
good 
things. 
Likewise 
also 
‘well-starred’ 
may 
be 
taken 
to 
mean 
the 
man 
whose 
star 
is 
good, 
as 
Xenocrates 
says 
‘well-starred 
is 
he 
who 
has 
a 
noble 
soul’.’ 
For 
a 
man’s 
star 
is 
his 
soul. 


Some 
things 
occur 
of 
necessity, 
others 
usually, 
others 
however 
it 
may 
chance; 
if 
therefore 
a 
necessary 
event 
has 
been 
asserted 
to 
occur 
usually, 
or 
if 
a 
usual 
event 
(or, 
failing 
such 
an 
event 
itself, 
its 
contrary) 
has 
been 
stated 
to 
occur 
of 
necessity, 
it 
always 
gives 
an 
opportunity 
for 
attack. 
For 
if 
a 
necessary 
event 
has 
been 
asserted 
to 
occur 
usually, 
clearly 
the 
speaker 
has 
denied 
an 
attribute 
to 
be 
universal 
which 
is 
universal, 
and 
so 
has 
made 
a 



mistake: 
and 
so 
he 
has 
if 
he 
has 
declared 
the 
usual 
attribute 
to 
be 
necessary: 
for 
then 
he 
declares 
it 
to 
belong 
universally 
when 
it 
does 
not 
so 
belong. 
Likewise 
also 
if 
he 
has 
declared 
the 
contrary 
of 
what 
is 
usual 
to 
be 
necessary. 
For 
the 
contrary 
of 
a 
usual 
attribute 
is 
always 
a 
comparatively 
rare 
attribute: 


e.g. 
if 
men 
are 
usually 
bad, 
they 
are 
comparatively 
seldom 
good, 
so 
that 
his 
mistake 
is 
even 
worse 
if 
he 
has 
declared 
them 
to 
be 
good 
of 
necessity. 
The 
same 
is 
true 
also 
if 
he 
has 
declared 
a 
mere 
matter 
of 
chance 
to 
happen 
of 
necessity 
or 
usually; 
for 
a 
chance 
event 
happens 
neither 
of 
necessity 
nor 
usually. 
If 
the 
thing 
happens 
usually, 
then 
even 
supposing 
his 
statement 
does 
not 
distinguish 
whether 
he 
meant 
that 
it 
happens 
usually 
or 
that 
it 
happens 
necessarily, 
it 
is 
open 
to 
you 
to 
discuss 
it 
on 
the 
assumption 
that 
he 
meant 
that 
it 
happens 
necessarily: 
e.g. 
if 
he 
has 
stated 
without 
any 
distinction 
that 
disinherited 
persons 
are 
bad, 
you 
may 
assume 
in 
discussing 
it 
that 
he 
means 
that 
they 
are 
so 
necessarily. 
Moreover, 
look 
and 
see 
also 
if 
he 
has 
stated 
a 
thing 
to 
be 
an 
accident 
of 
itself, 
taking 
it 
to 
be 
a 
different 
thing 
because 
it 
has 
a 
different 
name, 
as 
Prodicus 
used 
to 
divide 
pleasures 
into 
joy 
and 
delight 
and 
good 
cheer: 
for 
all 
these 
are 
names 
of 
the 
same 
thing, 
to 
wit, 
Pleasure. 
If 
then 
any 
one 
says 
that 
joyfulness 
is 
an 
accidental 
attribute 
of 
cheerfulness, 
he 
would 
be 
declaring 
it 
to 
be 
an 
accidental 
attribute 
of 
itself.

Inasmuch 
as 
contraries 
can 
be 
conjoined 
with 
each 
other 
in 
six 
ways, 
and 
four 
of 
these 
conjunctions 
constitute 
a 
contrariety, 
we 
must 
grasp 
the 
subject 
of 
contraries, 
in 
order 
that 
it 
may 
help 
us 
both 
in 
demolishing 
and 
in 
establishing 
a 
view. 
Well 
then, 
that 
the 
modes 
of 
conjunction 
are 
six 
is 
clear: 
for 
either 
(1) 
each 
of 
the 
contrary 
verbs 
will 
be 
conjoined 
to 
each 
of 
the 
contrary 
objects; 
and 
this 
gives 
two 
modes: 
e.g. 
to 
do 
good 
to 
friends 
and 
to 
do 
evil 
to 
enemies, 
or 
per 
contra 
to 
do 
evil 
to 
friends 
and 
to 
do 
good 
to 
enemies. 
Or 
else 
(2) 
both 
verbs 
may 
be 
attached 
to 
one 
object; 
and 
this 
too 
gives 
two 
modes, 
e.g. 
to 
do 
good 
to 
friends 
and 
to 
do 
evil 
to 
friends, 
or 
to 
do 
good 
to 
enemies 
and 
to 
do 
evil 
to 
enemies. 
Or 
(3) 
a 
single 
verb 
may 
be 
attached 
to 
both 
objects: 
and 
this 
also 
gives 
two 
modes; 
e.g. 
to 
do 
good 
to 
friends 
and 
to 
do 
good 
to 
enemies, 
or 
to 
do 
evil 
to 
friends 
and 
evil 
to 



enemies. 


The 
first 
two 
then 
of 
the 
aforesaid 
conjunctions 
do 
not 
constitute 
any 
contrariety; 
for 
the 
doing 
of 
good 
to 
friends 
is 
not 
contrary 
to 
the 
doing 
of 
evil 
to 
enemies: 
for 
both 
courses 
are 
desirable 
and 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
disposition. 
Nor 
is 
the 
doing 
of 
evil 
to 
friends 
contrary 
to 
the 
doing 
of 
good 
to 
enemies: 
for 
both 
of 
these 
are 
objectionable 
and 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
disposition: 
and 
one 
objectionable 
thing 
is 
not 
generally 
thought 
to 
be 
the 
contrary 
of 
another, 
unless 
the 
one 
be 
an 
expression 
denoting 
an 
excess, 
and 
the 
other 
an 
expression 
denoting 
a 
defect: 
for 
an 
excess 
is 
generally 
thought 
to 
belong 
to 
the 
class 
of 
objectionable 
things, 
and 
likewise 
also 
a 
defect. 
But 
the 
other 
four 
all 
constitute 
a 
contrariety. 
For 
to 
do 
good 
to 
friends 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
doing 
of 
evil 
to 
friends: 
for 
it 
proceeds 
from 
the 
contrary 
disposition, 
and 
the 
one 
is 
desirable, 
and 
the 
other 
objectionable. 
The 
case 
is 
the 
same 
also 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
other 
conjunctions: 
for 
in 
each 
combination 
the 
one 
course 
is 
desirable, 
and 
the 
other 
objectionable, 
and 
the 
one 
belongs 
to 
a 
reasonable 
disposition 
and 
the 
other 
to 
a 
bad. 
Clearly, 
then, 
from 
what 
has 
been 
said, 
the 
same 
course 
has 
more 
than 
one 
contrary. 
For 
the 
doing 
of 
good 
to 
friends 
has 
as 
its 
contrary 
both 
the 
doing 
of 
good 
to 
enemies 
and 
the 
doing 
of 
evil 
to 
friends. 
Likewise, 
if 
we 
examine 
them 
in 
the 
same 
way, 
we 
shall 
find 
that 
the 
contraries 
of 
each 
of 
the 
others 
also 
are 
two 
in 
number. 
Select 
therefore 
whichever 
of 
the 
two 
contraries 
is 
useful 
in 
attacking 
the 
thesis. 


Moreover, 
if 
the 
accident 
of 
a 
thing 
have 
a 
contrary, 
see 
whether 
it 
belongs 
to 
the 
subject 
to 
which 
the 
accident 
in 
question 
has 
been 
declared 
to 
belong: 
for 
if 
the 
latter 
belongs 
the 
former 
could 
not 
belong; 
for 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
contrary 
predicates 
should 
belong 
at 
the 
same 
time 
to 
the 
same 
thing. 


Or 
again, 
look 
and 
see 
if 
anything 
has 
been 
said 
about 
something, 
of 
such 
a 
kind 
that 
if 
it 
be 
true, 
contrary 
predicates 
must 
necessarily 
belong 
to 
the 
thing: 
e.g. 
if 
he 
has 
said 
that 
the 
‘Ideas’ 
exist 
in 
us. 
For 
then 
the 
result 
will 
be 
that 
they 
are 
both 
in 
motion 
and 
at 
rest, 
and 
moreover 
that 
they 
are 
objects 
both 
of 
sensation 
and 
of 
thought. 
For 
according 
to 
the 
views 
of 
those 
who 
posit 
the 
existence 
of 
Ideas, 
those 
Ideas 
are 
at 
rest 
and 
are 
objects 
of 
thought; 
while 
if 
they 
exist 
in 
us, 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
they 
should 
be 
unmoved: 
for 
when 
we 
move, 
it 
follows 
necessarily 
that 
all 
that 
is 
in 
us 
moves 
with 
us 
as 
well. 
Clearly 
also 
they 
are 
objects 
of 
sensation, 
if 
they 
exist 
in 
us: 
for 
it 
is 
through 
the 
sensation 
of 
sight 
that 
we 
recognize 
the 
Form 
present 
in 
each 
individual. 


Again, 
if 
there 
be 
posited 
an 
accident 
which 
has 
a 
contrary, 
look 
and 
see 
if 



that 
which 
admits 
of 
the 
accident 
will 
admit 
of 
its 
contrary 
as 
well: 
for 
the 
same 
thing 
admits 
of 
contraries. 
Thus 
(e.g.) 
if 
he 
has 
asserted 
that 
hatred 
follows 
anger, 
hatred 
would 
in 
that 
case 
be 
in 
the 
‘spirited 
faculty’: 
for 
that 
is 
where 
anger 
is. 
You 
should 
therefore 
look 
and 
see 
if 
its 
contrary, 
to 
wit, 
friendship, 
be 
also 
in 
the 
‘spirited 
faculty’: 
for 
if 
not-if 
friendship 
is 
in 
the 
faculty 
of 
desire-then 
hatred 
could 
not 
follow 
anger. 
Likewise 
also 
if 
he 
has 
asserted 
that 
the 
faculty 
of 
desire 
is 
ignorant. 
For 
if 
it 
were 
capable 
of 
ignorance, 
it 
would 
be 
capable 
of 
knowledge 
as 
well: 
and 
this 
is 
not 
generally 
held-I 
mean 
that 
the 
faculty 
of 
desire 
is 
capable 
of 
knowledge. 
For 
purposes, 
then, 
of 
overthrowing 
a 
view, 
as 
has 
been 
said, 
this 
rule 
should 
be 
observed: 
but 
for 
purposes 
of 
establishing 
one, 
though 
the 
rule 
will 
not 
help 
you 
to 
assert 
that 
the 
accident 
actually 
belongs, 
it 
will 
help 
you 
to 
assert 
that 
it 
may 
possibly 
belong. 
For 
having 
shown 
that 
the 
thing 
in 
question 
will 
not 
admit 
of 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
accident 
asserted, 
we 
shall 
have 
shown 
that 
the 
accident 
neither 
belongs 
nor 
can 
possibly 
belong; 
while 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
if 
we 
show 
that 
the 
contrary 
belongs, 
or 
that 
the 
thing 
is 
capable 
of 
the 
contrary, 
we 
shall 
not 
indeed 
as 
yet 
have 
shown 
that 
the 
accident 
asserted 
does 
belong 
as 
well; 
our 
proof 
will 
merely 
have 
gone 
to 
this 
point, 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
it 
to 
belong.

Seeing 
that 
the 
modes 
of 
opposition 
are 
four 
in 
number, 
you 
should 
look 
for 
arguments 
among 
the 
contradictories 
of 
your 
terms, 
converting 
the 
order 
of 
their 
sequence, 
both 
when 
demolishing 
and 
when 
establishing 
a 
view, 
and 
you 
should 
secure 
them 
by 
means 
of 
induction-such 
arguments 
(e.g.) 
as 
that 
man 
be 
an 
animal, 
what 
is 
not 
an 
animal 
is 
not 
a 
man’: 
and 
likewise 
also 
in 
other 
instances 
of 
contradictories. 
For 
in 
those 
cases 
the 
sequence 
is 
converse: 
for 
‘animal’ 
follows 
upon 
‘man 
but 
‘not-animal’ 
does 
not 
follow 
upon 
‘not-man’, 
but 
conversely 
‘not-man’ 
upon 
‘not-animal’. 
In 
all 
cases, 
therefore, 
a 
postulate 
of 
this 
sort 
should 
be 
made, 
(e.g.) 
that 
‘If 
the 
honourable 
is 
pleasant, 
what 
is 
not 
pleasant 
is 
not 
honourable, 
while 
if 
the 
latter 
be 
untrue, 
so 
is 
the 
former’. 
Likewise, 
also, 
‘If 
what 
is 
not 
pleasant 
be 
not 
honourable, 
then 
what 
is 
honourable 
is 
pleasant’. 
Clearly, 
then, 
the 
conversion 
of 
the 
sequence 
formed 
by 
contradiction 
of 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
thesis 



is 
a 
method 
convertible 
for 
both 
purposes. 


Then 
look 
also 
at 
the 
case 
of 
the 
contraries 
of 
S 
and 
P 
in 
the 
thesis, 
and 
see 
if 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
one 
follows 
upon 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
other, 
either 
directly 
or 
conversely, 
both 
when 
you 
are 
demolishing 
and 
when 
you 
are 
establishing 
a 
view: 
secure 
arguments 
of 
this 
kind 
as 
well 
by 
means 
of 
induction, 
so 
far 
as 
may 
be 
required. 
Now 
the 
sequence 
is 
direct 
in 
a 
case 
such 
as 
that 
of 
courage 
and 
cowardice: 
for 
upon 
the 
one 
of 
them 
virtue 
follows, 
and 
vice 
upon 
the 
other; 
and 
upon 
the 
one 
it 
follows 
that 
it 
is 
desirable, 
while 
upon 
the 
other 
it 
follows 
that 
it 
is 
objectionable. 
The 
sequence, 
therefore, 
in 
the 
latter 
case 
also 
is 
direct; 
for 
the 
desirable 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
objectionable. 
Likewise 
also 
in 
other 
cases. 
The 
sequence 
is, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
converse 
in 
such 
a 
case 
as 
this: 
Health 
follows 
upon 
vigour, 
but 
disease 
does 
not 
follow 
upon 
debility; 
rather 
debility 
follows 
upon 
disease. 
In 
this 
case, 
then, 
clearly 
the 
sequence 
is 
converse. 
Converse 
sequence 
is, 
however, 
rare 
in 
the 
case 
of 
contraries; 
usually 
the 
sequence 
is 
direct. 
If, 
therefore, 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
one 
term 
does 
not 
follow 
upon 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
other 
either 
directly 
or 
conversely, 
clearly 
neither 
does 
the 
one 
term 
follow 
upon 
the 
other 
in 
the 
statement 
made: 
whereas 
if 
the 
one 
followed 
the 
other 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
contraries, 
it 
must 
of 
necessity 
do 
so 
as 
well 
in 
the 
original 
statement. 


You 
should 
look 
also 
into 
cases 
of 
the 
privation 
or 
presence 
of 
a 
state 
in 
like 
manner 
to 
the 
case 
of 
contraries. 
Only, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
such 
privations 
the 
converse 
sequence 
does 
not 
occur: 
the 
sequence 
is 
always 
bound 
to 
be 
direct: 


e.g. 
as 
sensation 
follows 
sight, 
while 
absence 
of 
sensation 
follows 
blindness. 
For 
the 
opposition 
of 
sensation 
to 
absence 
of 
sensation 
is 
an 
opposition 
of 
the 
presence 
to 
the 
privation 
of 
a 
state: 
for 
the 
one 
of 
them 
is 
a 
state, 
and 
the 
other 
the 
privation 
of 
it. 
The 
case 
of 
relative 
terms 
should 
also 
be 
studied 
in 
like 
manner 
to 
that 
of 
a 
state 
and 
its 
privation: 
for 
the 
sequence 
of 
these 
as 
well 
is 
direct; 
e.g. 
if 
3/1 
is 
a 
multiple, 
then 
1/3 
is 
a 
fraction: 
for 
3/1 
is 
relative 
to 
1/3, 
and 
so 
is 
a 
multiple 
to 
a 
fraction. 
Again, 
if 
knowledge 
be 
a 
conceiving, 
then 
also 
the 
object 
of 
knowledge 
is 
an 
object 
of 
conception; 
and 
if 
sight 
be 
a 
sensation, 
then 
also 
the 
object 
of 
sight 
is 
an 
object 
of 
sensation. 
An 
objection 
may 
be 
made 
that 
there 
is 
no 
necessity 
for 
the 
sequence 
to 
take 
place, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
relative 
terms, 
in 
the 
way 
described: 
for 
the 
object 
of 
sensation 
is 
an 
object 
of 
knowledge, 
whereas 
sensation 
is 
not 
knowledge. 
The 
objection 
is, 
however, 
not 
generally 
received 
as 
really 
true; 
for 
many 
people 
deny 
that 
there 
is 



knowledge 
of 
objects 
of 
sensation. 
Moreover, 
the 
principle 
stated 
is 
just 
as 
useful 
for 
the 
contrary 
purpose, 
e.g. 
to 
show 
that 
the 
object 
of 
sensation 
is 
not 
an 
object 
of 
knowledge, 
on 
the 
ground 
that 
neither 
is 
sensation 
knowledge.

id="section27"

Again 
look 
at 
the 
case 
of 
the 
co-ordinates 
and 
inflected 
forms 
of 
the 
terms 
in 
the 
thesis, 
both 
in 
demolishing 
and 
in 
establishing 
it. 
By 
co-ordinates’ 
are 
meant 
terms 
such 
as 
the 
following: 
‘Just 
deeds’ 
and 
the 
‘just 
man’ 
are 
coordinates 
of 
‘justice’, 
and 
‘courageous 
deeds’ 
and 
the 
‘courageous 
man’ 
are 
co-ordinates 
of 
courage. 
Likewise 
also 
things 
that 
tend 
to 
produce 
and 
to 
preserve 
anything 
are 
called 
co-ordinates 
of 
that 
which 
they 
tend 
to 
produce 
and 
to 
preserve, 
as 
e.g. 
‘healthy 
habits’ 
are 
co-ordinates 
of 
‘health’ 
and 
a 
‘vigorous 
constitutional’ 
of 
a 
‘vigorous 
constitution’ 
and 
so 
forth 
also 
in 
other 
cases. 
‘Co-ordinate’, 
then, 
usually 
describes 
cases 
such 
as 
these, 
whereas 
‘inflected 
forms’ 
are 
such 
as 
the 
following: 
‘justly’, 
‘courageously’, 
‘healthily’, 
and 
such 
as 
are 
formed 
in 
this 
way. 
It 
is 
usually 
held 
that 
words 
when 
used 
in 
their 
inflected 
forms 
as 
well 
are 
co-ordinates, 
as 
(e.g.) 
‘justly’ 
in 
relation 
to 
justice, 
and 
‘courageously’ 
to 
courage; 
and 
then 
‘co-ordinate’ 
describes 
all 
the 
members 
of 
the 
same 
kindred 
series, 
e.g. 
‘justice’, 
‘just’, 
of 
a 
man 
or 
an 
act, 
‘justly’. 
Clearly, 
then, 
when 
any 
one 
member, 
whatever 
its 
kind, 
of 
the 
same 
kindred 
series 
is 
shown 
to 
be 
good 
or 
praiseworthy, 
then 
all 
the 
rest 
as 
well 
come 
to 
be 
shown 
to 
be 
so: 
e.g. 
if 
‘justice’ 
be 
something 
praiseworthy, 
then 
so 
will 
‘just’, 
of 
a 
man 
or 
thing, 
and 
‘justly’ 
connote 
something 
praiseworthy. 
Then 
‘justly’ 
will 
be 
rendered 
also 
‘praiseworthily’, 
derived 
will 
by 
the 
same 
inflexion 
from 
‘the 
praiseworthy’ 
whereby 
‘justly’ 
is 
derived 
from 
‘justice’. 


Look 
not 
only 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
subject 
mentioned, 
but 
also 
in 
the 
case 
of 
its 
contrary, 
for 
the 
contrary 
predicate: 
e.g. 
argue 
that 
good 
is 
not 
necessarily 
pleasant; 
for 
neither 
is 
evil 
painful: 
or 
that, 
if 
the 
latter 
be 
the 
case, 
so 
is 
the 
former. 
Also, 
if 
justice 
be 
knowledge, 
then 
injustice 
is 
ignorance: 
and 
if 
‘justly’ 
means 
‘knowingly’ 
and 
‘skilfully’, 
then 
‘unjustly’ 
means 
‘ignorantly’ 
and 
‘unskilfully’: 
whereas 
if 
the 
latter 
be 
not 
true, 
neither 
is 
the 
former, 
as 
in 
the 
instance 
given 
just 
now: 
for 
‘unjustly’ 
is 
more 
likely 
to 
seem 
equivalent 
to 
‘skilfully’ 
than 
to 
‘unskilfully’. 
This 
commonplace 
rule 
has 
been 
stated 



before 
in 
dealing 
with 
the 
sequence 
of 
contraries; 
for 
all 
we 
are 
claiming 
now 
is 
that 
the 
contrary 
of 
P 
shall 
follow 
the 
contrary 
of 
S. 


Moreover, 
look 
at 
the 
modes 
of 
generation 
and 
destruction 
of 
a 
thing, 
and 
at 
the 
things 
which 
tend 
to 
produce 
or 
to 
destroy 
it, 
both 
in 
demolishing 
and 
in 
establishing 
a 
view. 
For 
those 
things 
whose 
modes 
of 
generation 
rank 
among 
good 
things, 
are 
themselves 
also 
good; 
and 
if 
they 
themselves 
be 
good, 
so 
also 
are 
their 
modes 
of 
generation. 
If, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
their 
modes 
of 
generation 
be 
evil, 
then 
they 
themselves 
also 
are 
evil. 
In 
regard 
to 
modes 
of 
destruction 
the 
converse 
is 
true: 
for 
if 
the 
modes 
of 
destruction 
rank 
as 
good 
things, 
then 
they 
themselves 
rank 
as 
evil 
things; 
whereas 
if 
the 
modes 
of 
destruction 
count 
as 
evil, 
they 
themselves 
count 
as 
good. 
The 
same 
argument 
applies 
also 
to 
things 
tending 
to 
produce 
and 
destroy: 
for 
things 
whose 
productive 
causes 
are 
good, 
themselves 
also 
rank 
as 
good; 
whereas 
if 
causes 
destructive 
of 
them 
are 
good, 
they 
themselves 
rank 
as 
evil.

Again, 
look 
at 
things 
which 
are 
like 
the 
subject 
in 
question, 
and 
see 
if 
they 
are 
in 
like 
case; 
e.g. 
if 
one 
branch 
of 
knowledge 
has 
more 
than 
one 
object, 
so 
also

one

to 
possess 
hearing 
will 
be 
to 
hear. 
Likewise 
also 
in 
the 
case 
of 
other 
things, 
both 
those 
which 
are 
and 
those 
which 
are 
generally 
held 
to 
be 
like. 
The 
rule 
in 
question 
is 
useful 
for 
both 
purposes; 
for 
if 
it 
be 
as 
stated 
in 
the 
case 
of 
some 
one 
like 
thing, 
it 
is 
so 
with 
the 
other 
like 
things 
as 
well, 
whereas 
if 
it 
be 
not 
so 
in 
the 
case 
of 
some 
one 
of 
them, 
neither 
is 
it 
so 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
others. 
Look 
and 
see 
also 
whether 
the 
cases 
are 
alike 
as 
regards 
a 
single 
thing 
and 
a 
number 
of 
things: 
for 
sometimes 
there 
is 
a 
discrepancy. 
Thus, 
if 
to 
‘know’ 
a 
thing 
be 
to 
‘think 
of’ 
it, 
then 
also 
to 
‘know 
many 
things’ 
is 
to 
‘be 
thinking 
of 
many 
things’; 
whereas 
this 
is 
not 
true; 
for 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
know 
many 
things 
but 
not 
to 
be 
thinking 
of 
them. 
If, 
then, 
the 
latter 
proposition 
be 
not 
true, 
neither 
was 
the 
former 
that 
dealt 
with 
a 
single 
thing, 
viz. 
that 
to 
‘know’ 
a 
thing 
is 
to 
‘think 
of’ 
it. 


Moreover, 
argue 
from 
greater 
and 
less 
degrees. 
In 
regard 
to 
greater 
degrees 
there 
are 
four 
commonplace 
rules. 
One 
is: 
See 
whether 
a 
greater 
degree 
of 
the 
predicate 
follows 
a 
greater 
degree 
of 
the 
subject: 
e.g. 
if 
pleasure 
be 
good, 
see 



whether 
also 
a 
greater 
pleasure 
be 
a 
greater 
good: 
and 
if 
to 
do 
a 
wrong 
be 
evil, 
see 
whether 
also 
to 
do 
a 
greater 
wrong 
is 
a 
greater 
evil. 
Now 
this 
rule 
is 
of 
use 
for 
both 
purposes: 
for 
if 
an 
increase 
of 
the 
accident 
follows 
an 
increase 
of 
the 
subject, 
as 
we 
have 
said, 
clearly 
the 
accident 
belongs; 
while 
if 
it 
does 
not 
follow, 
the 
accident 
does 
not 
belong. 
You 
should 
establish 
this 
by 
induction. 
Another 
rule 
is: 
If 
one 
predicate 
be 
attributed 
to 
two 
subjects; 
then 
supposing 
it 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
the 
subject 
to 
which 
it 
is 
the 
more 
likely 
to 
belong, 
neither 
does 
it 
belong 
where 
it 
is 
less 
likely 
to 
belong; 
while 
if 
it 
does 
belong 
where 
it 
is 
less 
likely 
to 
belong, 
then 
it 
belongs 
as 
well 
where 
it 
is 
more 
likely. 
Again: 
If 
two 
predicates 
be 
attributed 
to 
one 
subject, 
then 
if 
the 
one 
which 
is 
more 
generally 
thought 
to 
belong 
does 
not 
belong, 
neither 
does 
the 
one 
that 
is 
less 
generally 
thought 
to 
belong; 
or, 
if 
the 
one 
that 
is 
less 
generally 
thought 
to 
belong 
does 
belong, 
so 
also 
does 
the 
other. 
Moreover: 
If 
two 
predicates 
be 
attributed 
to 
two 
subjects, 
then 
if 
the 
one 
which 
is 
more 
usually 
thought 
to 
belong 
to 
the 
one 
subject 
does 
not 
belong, 
neither 
does 
the 
remaining 
predicate 
belong 
to 
the 
remaining 
subject; 
or, 
if 
the 
one 
which 
is 
less 
usually 
thought 
to 
belong 
to 
the 
one 
subject 
does 
belong, 
so 
too 
does 
the 
remaining 
predicate 
to 
the 
remaining 
subject. 


Moreover, 
you 
can 
argue 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
an 
attribute 
belongs, 
or 
is 
generally 
supposed 
to 
belong, 
in 
a 
like 
degree, 
in 
three 
ways, 
viz. 
those 
described 
in 
the 
last 
three 
rules 
given 
in 
regard 
to 
a 
greater 
degree.’ 
For 
supposing 
that 
one 
predicate 
belongs, 
or 
is 
supposed 
to 
belong, 
to 
two 
subjects 
in 
a 
like 
degree, 
then 
if 
it 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
the 
one, 
neither 
does 
it 
belong 
to 
the 
other; 
while 
if 
it 
belongs 
to 
the 
one, 
it 
belongs 
to 
the 
remaining 
one 
as 
well. 
Or, 
supposing 
two 
predicates 
to 
belong 
in 
a 
like 
degree 
to 
the 
same 
subject, 
then, 
if 
the 
one 
does 
not 
belong, 
neither 
does 
the 
remaining 
one; 
while 
if 
the 
one 
does 
belong, 
the 
remaining 
one 
belongs 
as 
well. 
The 
case 
is 
the 
same 
also 
if 
two 
predicates 
belong 
in 
a 
like 
degree 
to 
two 
subjects; 
for 
if 
the 
one 
predicate 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
the 
one 
subject, 
neither 
does 
the 
remaining 
predicate 
belong 
to 
the 
remaining 
subject, 
while 
if 
the 
one 
predicate 
does 
belong 
to 
the 
one 
subject, 
the 
remaining 
predicate 
belongs 
to 
the 
remaining 
subject 
as 
well.

You 
can 
argue, 
then, 
from 
greater 
or 
less 
or 
like 
degrees 
of 
truth 
in 
the 
aforesaid 
number 
of 
ways. 
Moreover, 
you 
should 
argue 
from 
the 
addition 
of 
one 
thing 
to 
another. 
If 
the 
addition 
of 
one 
thing 
to 
another 
makes 
that 
other 
good 
or 
white, 
whereas 
formerly 
it 
was 
not 
white 
or 
good, 
then 
the 
thing 
added 
will 
be 
white 
or 
good-it 
will 
possess 
the 
character 
it 
imparts 
to 
the 
whole 
as 
well. 
Moreover, 
if 
an 
addition 
of 
something 
to 
a 
given 
object 
intensifies 
the 
character 
which 
it 
had 
as 
given, 
then 
the 
thing 
added 
will 
itself 
as 
well 
be 
of 
that 
character. 
Likewise, 
also, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
other 
attributes. 
The 
rule 
is 
not 
applicable 
in 
all 
cases, 
but 
only 
in 
those 
in 
which 
the 
excess 
described 
as 
an 
‘increased 
intensity’ 
is 
found 
to 
take 
place. 
The 
above 
rule 
is, 
however, 
not 
convertible 
for 
overthrowing 
a 
view. 
For 
if 
the 
thing 
added 
does 
not 
make 
the 
other 
good, 
it 
is 
not 
thereby 
made 
clear 
whether 
in 
itself 
it 
may 
not 
be 
good: 
for 
the 
addition 
of 
good 
to 
evil 
does 
not 
necessarily 
make 
the 
whole 
good, 
any 
more 
than 
the 
addition 
of 
white 
to 
black 
makes 
the 
whole 
white. 


Again, 
any 
predicate 
of 
which 
we 
can 
speak 
of 
greater 
or 
less 
degrees 
belongs 
also 
absolutely: 
for 
greater 
or 
less 
degrees 
of 
good 
or 
of 
white 
will 
not 
be 
attributed 
to 
what 
is 
not 
good 
or 
white: 
for 
a 
bad 
thing 
will 
never 
be 
said 
to 
have 
a 
greater 
or 
less 
degree 
of 
goodness 
than 
another, 
but 
always 
of 
badness. 
This 
rule 
is 
not 
convertible, 
either, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
overthrowing 
a 
predication: 
for 
several 
predicates 
of 
which 
we 
cannot 
speak 
of 
a 
greater 
degree 
belong 
absolutely: 
for 
the 
term 
‘man’ 
is 
not 
attributed 
in 
greater 
and 
less 
degrees, 
but 
a 
man 
is 
a 
man 
for 
all 
that. 


You 
should 
examine 
in 
the 
same 
way 
predicates 
attributed 
in 
a 
given 
respect, 
and 
at 
a 
given 
time 
and 
place: 
for 
if 
the 
predicate 
be 
possible 
in 
some 
respect, 
it 
is 
possible 
also 
absolutely. 
Likewise, 
also, 
is 
what 
is 
predicated 
at 
a 
given 
time 
or 
place: 
for 
what 
is 
absolutely 
impossible 
is 
not 
possible 
either 
in 
any 
respect 
or 
at 
any 
place 
or 
time. 
An 
objection 
may 
be 
raised 
that 
in 
a 
given 
respect 
people 
may 
be 
good 
by 
nature, 
e.g. 
they 
may 
be 
generous 
or 
temperately 
inclined, 
while 
absolutely 
they 
are 
not 
good 
by 
nature, 
because 
no 
one 
is 
prudent 
by 
nature. 
Likewise, 
also, 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
a 
destructible 
thing 
to 
escape 
destruction 
at 
a 
given 
time, 
whereas 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
for 
it 
to 
escape 
absolutely. 
In 
the 
same 
way 
also 
it 
is 
a 
good 
thing 
at 
certain 
places 
to 
follow 
see 
and 
such 
a 
diet, 
e.g. 
in 
infected 
areas, 
though 
it 
is 
not 
a 
good 
thing 
absolutely. 
Moreover, 
in 
certain 
places 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
live 
singly 
and 
alone, 
but 
absolutely 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
exist 
singly 
and 
alone. 
In 
the 
same 
way 
also 
it 
is 
in 
certain 
places 
honourable 
to 
sacrifice 
one’s 
father, 
e.g. 
among 
the 



Triballi, 
whereas, 
absolutely, 
it 
is 
not 
honourable. 
Or 
possibly 
this 
may 
indicate 
a 
relativity 
not 
to 
places 
but 
to 
persons: 
for 
it 
is 
all 
the 
same 
wherever 
they 
may 
be: 
for 
everywhere 
it 
will 
be 
held 
honourable 
among 
the 
Triballi 
themselves, 
just 
because 
they 
are 
Triballi. 
Again, 
at 
certain 
times 
it 
is 
a 
good 
thing 
to 
take 
medicines, 
e.g. 
when 
one 
is 
ill, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
so 
absolutely. 
Or 
possibly 
this 
again 
may 
indicate 
a 
relativity 
not 
to 
a 
certain 
time, 
but 
to 
a 
certain 
state 
of 
health: 
for 
it 
is 
all 
the 
same 
whenever 
it 
occurs, 
if 
only 
one 
be 
in 
that 
state. 
A 
thing 
is 
‘absolutely’ 
so 
which 
without 
any 
addition 
you 
are 
prepared 
to 
say 
is 
honourable 
or 
the 
contrary. 
Thus 
(e.g.) 
you 
will 
deny 
that 
to 
sacrifice 
one’s 
father 
is 
honourable: 
it 
is 
honourable 
only 
to 
certain 
persons: 
it 
is 
not 
therefore 
honourable 
absolutely. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
to 
honour 
the 
gods 
you 
will 
declare 
to 
be 
honourable 
without 
adding 
anything, 
because 
that 
is 
honourable 
absolutely. 
So 
that 
whatever 
without 
any 
addition 
is 
generally 
accounted 
to 
be 
honourable 
or 
dishonourable 
or 
anything 
else 
of 
that 
kind, 
will 
be 
said 
to 
be 
so 
‘absolutely’.

The 
question 
which 
is 
the 
more 
desirable, 
or 
the 
better, 
of 
two 
or 
more 
things, 
should 
be 
examined 
upon 
the 
following 
lines: 
only 
first 
of 
all 
it 
must 
be 
clearly 
laid 
down 
that 
the 
inquiry 
we 
are 
making 
concerns 
not 
things 
that 
are 
widely 
divergent 
and 
that 
exhibit 
great 
differences 
from 
one 
another 
(for 
nobody 
raises 
any 
doubt 
whether 
happiness 
or 
wealth 
is 
more 
desirable), 
but 
things 
that 
are 
nearly 
related 
and 
about 
which 
we 
commonly 
discuss 
for 
which 
of 
the 
two 
we 
ought 
rather 
to 
vote, 
because 
we 
do 
not 
see 
any 
advantage 
on 
either 
side 
as 
compared 
with 
the 
other. 
Clearly, 
in 
such 
cases 
if 
we 
can 
show 
a 
single 
advantage, 
or 
more 
than 
one, 
our 
judgement 
will 
record 
our 
assent 
that 
whichever 
side 
happens 
to 
have 
the 
advantage 
is 
the 
more 
desirable. 


First, 
then, 
that 
which 
is 
more 
lasting 
or 
secure 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
that 
which 
is 
less 
so: 
and 
so 
is 
that 
which 
is 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
chosen 
by 
the 
prudent 
or 
by 
the 
good 
man 
or 
by 
the 
right 
law, 
or 
by 
men 
who 
are 
good 
in 
any 
particular 
line, 
when 
they 
make 
their 
choice 
as 
such, 
or 
by 
the 
experts 
in 
regard 
to 
any 
particular 
class 
of 
things; 
i.e. 
either 
whatever 
most 
of 
them 
or 
what 
all 
of 
them 
would 
choose; 
e.g. 
in 
medicine 
or 
in 
carpentry 
those 
things 
are 
more 
desirable 
which 
most, 
or 
all, 
doctors 
would 
choose; 
or, 
in 
general, 
whatever 
most 
men 
or 
all 
men 
or 
all 
things 
would 
choose, 
e.g. 
the 
good: 
for 
everything 
aims 
at 
the 
good. 
You 
should 
direct 
the 
argument 
you 
intend 
to 
employ 
to 
whatever 
purpose 
you 
require. 
Of 
what 
is 
‘better’ 
or 
‘more 
desirable’ 
the 
absolute 
standard 
is 
the 
verdict 
of 
the 
better 
science, 
though 
relatively 
to 
a 
given 
individual 
the 
standard 
may 
be 
his 
own 
particular 
science. 


In 
the 
second 
place, 
that 
which 
is 
known 
as 
‘an 
x’ 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
that 
which 
does 
not 
come 
within 
the 
genus 
‘x’-e.g. 
justice 
than 
a 
just 
man; 
for 



the 
former 
falls 
within 
the 
genus 
‘good’, 
whereas 
the 
other 
does 
not, 
and 
the 
former 
is 
called 
‘a 
good’, 
whereas 
the 
latter 
is 
not: 
for 
nothing 
which 
does 
not 
happen 
to 
belong 
to 
the 
genus 
in 
question 
is 
called 
by 
the 
generic 
name; 
e.g. 
a 
‘white 
man’ 
is 
not 
‘a 
colour’. 
Likewise 
also 
in 
other 
cases. 


Also, 
that 
which 
is 
desired 
for 
itself 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
that 
which 
is 
desired 
for 
something 
else; 
e.g. 
health 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
gymnastics: 
for 
the 
former 
is 
desired 
for 
itself, 
the 
latter 
for 
something 
else. 
Also, 
that 
which 
is 
desirable 
in 
itself 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
what 
is 
desirable 
per 
accidens; 
e.g. 
justice 
in 
our 
friends 
than 
justice 
in 
our 
enemies: 
for 
the 
former 
is 
desirable 
in 
itself, 
the 
latter 
per 
accidens: 
for 
we 
desire 
that 
our 
enemies 
should 
be 
just 
per 
accidens, 
in 
order 
that 
they 
may 
do 
us 
no 
harm. 
This 
last 
principle 
is 
the 
same 
as 
the 
one 
that 
precedes 
it, 
with, 
however, 
a 
different 
turn 
of 
expression. 
For 
we 
desire 
justice 
in 
our 
friends 
for 
itself, 
even 
though 
it 
will 
make 
no 
difference 
to 
us, 
and 
even 
though 
they 
be 
in 
India; 
whereas 
in 
our 
enemies 
we 
desire 
it 
for 
something 
else, 
in 
order 
that 
they 
may 
do 
us 
no 
harm. 


Also, 
that 
which 
is 
in 
itself 
the 
cause 
of 
good 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
what 
is 
so 
per 
accidens, 
e.g. 
virtue 
than 
luck 
(for 
the 
former 
in 
itself, 
and 
the 
latter 
per 
accidens, 
the 
cause 
of 
good 
things), 
and 
so 
in 
other 
cases 
of 
the 
same 
kind. 
Likewise 
also 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
contrary; 
for 
what 
is 
in 
itself 
the 
cause 
of 
evil 
is 
more 
objectionable 
than 
what 
is 
so 
per 
accidens, 
e.g. 
vice 
and 
chance: 
for 
the 
one 
is 
bad 
in 
itself, 
whereas 
chance 
is 
so 
per 
accidens. 


Also, 
what 
is 
good 
absolutely 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
what 
is 
good 
for 
a 
particular 
person, 
e.g. 
recovery 
of 
health 
than 
a 
surgical 
operation; 
for 
the 
former 
is 
good 
absolutely, 
the 
latter 
only 
for 
a 
particular 
person, 
viz. 
the 
man 
who 
needs 
an 
operation. 
So 
too 
what 
is 
good 
by 
nature 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
the 
good 
that 
is 
not 
so 
by 
nature, 
e.g. 
justice 
than 
the 
just 
man; 
for 
the 
one 
is 
good 
by 
nature, 
whereas 
in 
the 
other 
case 
the 
goodness 
is 
acquired. 
Also 
the 
attribute 
is 
more 
desirable 
which 
belongs 
to 
the 
better 
and 
more 
honourable 
subject, 
e.g. 
to 
a 
god 
rather 
than 
to 
a 
man, 
and 
to 
the 
soul 
rather 
than 
to 
the 
body. 
So 
too 
the 
property 
of 
the 
better 
thing 
is 
better 
than 
the 
property 
of 
the 
worse; 
e.g. 
the 
property 
of 
God 
than 
the 
property 
of 
man: 
for 
whereas 
in 
respect 
of 
what 
is 
common 
in 
both 
of 
them 
they 
do 
not 
differ 
at 
all 
from 
each 
other, 
in 
respect 
of 
their 
properties 
the 
one 
surpasses 
the 
other. 
Also 
that 
is 
better 
which 
is 
inherent 
in 
things 
better 
or 
prior 
or 
more 
honourable: 
thus 
(e.g.) 
health 
is 
better 
than 
strength 
and 
beauty: 
for 
the 
former 
is 
inherent 
in 
the 
moist 
and 
the 
dry, 
and 
the 
hot 
and 
the 
cold, 
in 
fact 
in 
all 
the 
primary 
constituents 
of 
an 
animal, 
whereas 
the 
others 
are 
inherent 
in 
what 
is 



secondary, 
strength 
being 
a 
feature 
of 
the 
sinews 
and 
bones, 
while 
beauty 
is 
generally 
supposed 
to 
consist 
in 
a 
certain 
symmetry 
of 
the 
limbs. 
Also 
the 
end 
is 
generally 
supposed 
to 
be 
more 
desirable 
than 
the 
means, 
and 
of 
two 
means, 
that 
which 
lies 
nearer 
the 
end. 
In 
general, 
too, 
a 
means 
directed 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
life 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
a 
means 
to 
anything 
else, 
e.g. 
that 
which 
contributes 
to 
happiness 
than 
that 
which 
contributes 
to 
prudence. 
Also 
the 
competent 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
the 
incompetent. 
Moreover, 
of 
two 
productive 
agents 
that 
one 
is 
more 
desirable 
whose 
end 
is 
better; 
while 
between 
a 
productive 
agent 
and 
an 
end 
we 
can 
decide 
by 
a 
proportional 
sum 
whenever 
the 
excess 
of 
the 
one 
end 
over 
the 
other 
is 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
the 
latter 
over 
its 
own 
productive 
means: 
e.g. 
supposing 
the 
excess 
of 
happiness 
over 
health 
to 
be 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
health 
over 
what 
produces 
health, 
then 
what 
produces 
happiness 
is 
better 
than 
health. 
For 
what 
produces 
happiness 
exceeds 
what 
produces 
health 
just 
as 
much 
as 
happiness 
exceeds 
health. 
But 
health 
exceeds 
what 
produces 
health 
by 
a 
smaller 
amount; 
ergo, 
the 
excess 
of 
what 
produces 
happiness 
over 
what 
produces 
health 
is 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
health 
over 
what 
produces 
health. 
Clearly, 
therefore, 
what 
produces 
happiness 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
health: 
for 
it 
exceeds 
the 
same 
standard 
by 
a 
greater 
amount. 
Moreover, 
what 
is 
in 
itself 
nobler 
and 
more 
precious 
and 
praiseworthy 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
what 
is 
less 
so, 
e.g. 
friendship 
than 
wealth, 
and 
justice 
than 
strength. 
For 
the 
former 
belong 
in 
themselves 
to 
the 
class 
of 
things 
precious 
and 
praiseworthy, 
while 
the 
latter 
do 
so 
not 
in 
themselves 
but 
for 
something 
else: 
for 
no 
one 
prizes 
wealth 
for 
itself 
but 
always 
for 
something 
else, 
whereas 
we 
prize 
friendship 
for 
itself, 
even 
though 
nothing 
else 
is 
likely 
to 
come 
to 
us 
from 
it.

Moreover, 
whenever 
two 
things 
are 
very 
much 
like 
one 
another, 
and 
we 
cannot 
see 
any 
superiority 
in 
the 
one 
over 
the 
other 
of 
them, 
we 
should 
look 
at 
them 
from 
the 
standpoint 
of 
their 
consequences. 
For 
the 
one 
which 
is 
followed 
by 
the 
greater 
good 
is 
the 
more 
desirable: 
or, 
if 
the 
consequences 
be 
evil, 
that 
is 
more 
desirable 
which 
is 
followed 
by 
the 
less 
evil. 
For 
though 
both 
may 
be 
desirable, 
yet 
there 
may 
possibly 
be 
some 
unpleasant 
consequence 
involved 
to 
turn 
the 
scale. 
Our 
survey 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
consequences 



lies 
in 
two 
directions, 
for 
there 
are 
prior 
consequences 
and 
later 
consequences: 
e.g. 
if 
a 
man 
learns, 
it 
follows 
that 
he 
was 
ignorant 
before 
and 
knows 
afterwards. 
As 
a 
rule, 
the 
later 
consequence 
is 
the 
better 
to 
consider. 
You 
should 
take, 
therefore, 
whichever 
of 
the 
consequences 
suits 
your 
purpose. 


Moreover, 
a 
greater 
number 
of 
good 
things 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
a 
smaller, 
either 
absolutely 
or 
when 
the 
one 
is 
included 
in 
the 
other, 
viz. 
the 
smaller 
number 
in 
the 
greater. 
An 
objection 
may 
be 
raised 
suppose 
in 
some 
particular 
case 
the 
one 
is 
valued 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
the 
other; 
for 
then 
the 
two 
together 
are 
not 
more 
desirable 
than 
the 
one; 
e.g. 
recovery 
of 
health 
and 
health, 
than 
health 
alone, 
inasmuch 
as 
we 
desire 
recovery 
of 
health 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
health. 
Also 
it 
is 
quite 
possible 
for 
what 
is 
not 
good, 
together 
with 
what 
is, 
to 
be 
more 
desirable 
than 
a 
greater 
number 
of 
good 
things, 
e.g. 
the 
combination 
of 
happiness 
and 
something 
else 
which 
is 
not 
good 
may 
be 
more 
desirable 
than 
the 
combination 
of 
justice 
and 
courage. 
Also, 
the 
same 
things 
are 
more 
valuable 
if 
accompanied 
than 
if 
unaccompanied 
by 
pleasure, 
and 
likewise 
when 
free 
from 
pain 
than 
when 
attended 
with 
pain. 


Also, 
everything 
is 
more 
desirable 
at 
the 
season 
when 
it 
is 
of 
greater 
consequence; 
e.g. 
freedom 
from 
pain 
in 
old 
age 
more 
than 
in 
youth: 
for 
it 
is 
of 
greater 
consequence 
in 
old 
age. 
On 
the 
same 
principle 
also, 
prudence 
is 
more 
desirable 
in 
old 
age; 
for 
no 
man 
chooses 
the 
young 
to 
guide 
him, 
because 
he 
does 
not 
expect 
them 
to 
be 
prudent. 
With 
courage, 
the 
converse 
is 
the 
case, 
for 
it 
is 
in 
youth 
that 
the 
active 
exercise 
of 
courage 
is 
more 
imperatively 
required. 
Likewise 
also 
with 
temperance; 
for 
the 
young 
are 
more 
troubled 
by 
their 
passions 
than 
are 
their 
elders. 


Also, 
that 
is 
more 
desirable 
which 
is 
more 
useful 
at 
every 
season 
or 
at 
most 
seasons, 
e.g. 
justice 
and 
temperance 
rather 
than 
courage: 
for 
they 
are 
always 
useful, 
while 
courage 
is 
only 
useful 
at 
times. 
Also, 
that 
one 
of 
two 
things 
which 
if 
all 
possess, 
we 
do 
not 
need 
the 
other 
thing, 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
that 
which 
all 
may 
possess 
and 
still 
we 
want 
the 
other 
one 
as 
well. 
Take 
the 
case 
of 
justice 
and 
courage; 
if 
everybody 
were 
just, 
there 
would 
be 
no 
use 
for 
courage, 
whereas 
all 
might 
be 
courageous, 
and 
still 
justice 
would 
be 
of 
use. 


Moreover, 
judge 
by 
the 
destructions 
and 
losses 
and 
generations 
and 
acquisitions 
and 
contraries 
of 
things: 
for 
things 
whose 
destruction 
is 
more 
objectionable 
are 
themselves 
more 
desirable. 
Likewise 
also 
with 
the 
losses 
and 
contraries 
of 
things; 
for 
a 
thing 
whose 
loss 
or 
whose 
contrary 
is 
more 
objectionable 
is 
itself 
more 
desirable. 
With 
the 
generations 
or 
acquisitions 
of 



things 
the 
opposite 
is 
the 
case: 
for 
things 
whose 
acquisition 
or 
generation 
is 
more 
desirable 
are 
themselves 
also 
desirable. 
Another 
commonplace 
rule 
is 
that 
what 
is 
nearer 
to 
the 
good 
is 
better 
and 
more 
desirable, 
i.e. 
what 
more 
nearly 
resembles 
the 
good: 
thus 
justice 
is 
better 
than 
a 
just 
man. 
Also, 
that 
which 
is 
more 
like 
than 
another 
thing 
to 
something 
better 
than 
itself, 
as 
e.g. 
some 
say 
that 
Ajax 
was 
a 
better 
man 
than 
Odysseus 
because 
he 
was 
more 
like 
Achilles. 
An 
objection 
may 
be 
raised 
to 
this 
that 
it 
is 
not 
true: 
for 
it 
is 
quite 
possible 
that 
Ajax 
did 
not 
resemble 
Achilles 
more 
nearly 
than 
Odysseus 
in 
the 
points 
which 
made 
Achilles 
the 
best 
of 
them, 
and 
that 
Odysseus 
was 
a 
good 
man, 
though 
unlike 
Achilles. 
Look 
also 
to 
see 
whether 
the 
resemblance 
be 
that 
of 
a 
caricature, 
like 
the 
resemblance 
of 
a 
monkey 
to 
a 
man, 
whereas 
a 
horse 
bears 
none: 
for 
the 
monkey 
is 
not 
the 
more 
handsome 
creature, 
despite 
its 
nearer 
resemblance 
to 
a 
man. 
Again, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
two 
things, 
if 
one 
is 
more 
like 
the 
better 
thing 
while 
another 
is 
more 
like 
the 
worse, 
then 
that 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
better 
which 
is 
more 
like 
the 
better. 
This 
too, 
however, 
admits 
of 
an 
objection: 
for 
quite 
possibly 
the 
one 
only 
slightly 
resembles 
the 
better, 
while 
the 
other 
strongly 
resembles 
the 
worse, 
e.g. 
supposing 
the 
resemblance 
of 
Ajax 
to 
Achilles 
to 
be 
slight, 
while 
that 
of 
Odysseus 
to 
Nestor 
is 
strong. 
Also 
it 
may 
be 
that 
the 
one 
which 
is 
like 
the 
better 
type 
shows 
a 
degrading 
likeness, 
whereas 
the 
one 
which 
is 
like 
the 
worse 
type 
improves 
upon 
it: 
witness 
the 
likeness 
of 
a 
horse 
to 
a 
donkey, 
and 
that 
of 
a 
monkey 
to 
a 
man. 


Another 
rule 
is 
that 
the 
more 
conspicuous 
good 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
the 
less 
conspicuous, 
and 
the 
more 
difficult 
than 
the 
easier: 
for 
we 
appreciate 
better 
the 
possession 
of 
things 
that 
cannot 
be 
easily 
acquired. 
Also 
the 
more 
personal 
possession 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
the 
more 
widely 
shared. 
Also, 
that 
which 
is 
more 
free 
from 
connexion 
with 
evil: 
for 
what 
is 
not 
attended 
by 
any 
unpleasantness 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
what 
is 
so 
attended. 


Moreover, 
if 
A 
be 
without 
qualification 
better 
than 
B, 
then 
also 
the 
best 
of 
the 
members 
of 
A 
is 
better 
than 
the 
best 
of 
the 
members 
of 
B; 
e.g. 
if 
Man 
be 
better 
than 
Horse, 
then 
also 
the 
best 
man 
is 
better 
than 
the 
best 
horse. 
Also, 
if 
the 
best 
in 
A 
be 
better 
than 
the 
best 
in 
B, 
then 
also 
A 
is 
better 
than 
B 
without 
qualification; 
e.g. 
if 
the 
best 
man 
be 
better 
than 
the 
best 
horse, 
then 
also 
Man 
is 
better 
than 
Horse 
without 
qualification. 


Moreover, 
things 
which 
our 
friends 
can 
share 
are 
more 
desirable 
than 
those 
they 
cannot. 
Also, 
things 
which 
we 
like 
rather 
to 
do 
to 
our 
friend 
are 
more 
desirable 
than 
those 
we 
like 
to 
do 
to 
the 
man 
in 
the 
street, 
e.g. 
just 
dealing 
and 
the 
doing 
of 
good 
rather 
than 
the 
semblance 
of 
them: 
for 
we 
would 
rather 



really 
do 
good 
to 
our 
friends 
than 
seem 
to 
do 
so, 
whereas 
towards 
the 
man 
in 
the 
street 
the 
converse 
is 
the 
case. 


Also, 
superfluities 
are 
better 
than 
necessities, 
and 
are 
sometimes 
more 
desirable 
as 
well: 
for 
the 
good 
life 
is 
better 
than 
mere 
life, 
and 
good 
life 
is 
a 
superfluity, 
whereas 
mere 
life 
itself 
is 
a 
necessity. 
Sometimes, 
though, 
what 
is 
better 
is 
not 
also 
more 
desirable: 
for 
there 
is 
no 
necessity 
that 
because 
it 
is 
better 
it 
should 
also 
be 
more 
desirable: 
at 
least 
to 
be 
a 
philosopher 
is 
better 
than 
to 
make 
money, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
more 
desirable 
for 
a 
man 
who 
lacks 
the 
necessities 
of 
life. 
The 
expression 
‘superfluity’ 
applies 
whenever 
a 
man 
possesses 
the 
necessities 
of 
life 
and 
sets 
to 
work 
to 
secure 
as 
well 
other 
noble 
acquisitions. 
Roughly 
speaking, 
perhaps, 
necessities 
are 
more 
desirable, 
while 
superfluities 
are 
better. 


Also, 
what 
cannot 
be 
got 
from 
another 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
what 
can 
be 
got 
from 
another 
as 
well, 
as 
(e.g.) 
is 
the 
case 
of 
justice 
compared 
with 
courage. 
Also, 
A 
is 
more 
desirable 
if 
A 
is 
desirable 
without 
B, 
but 
not 
B 
without 
A: 
power 
(e.g.) 
is 
not 
desirable 
without 
prudence, 
but 
prudence 
is 
desirable 
without 
power. 
Also, 
if 
of 
two 
things 
we 
repudiate 
the 
one 
in 
order 
to 
be 
thought 
to 
possess 
the 
other, 
then 
that 
one 
is 
more 
desirable 
which 
we 
wish 
to 
be 
thought 
to 
possess; 
thus 
(e.g.) 
we 
repudiate 
the 
love 
of 
hard 
work 
in 
order 
that 
people 
may 
think 
us 
geniuses. 


Moreover, 
that 
is 
more 
desirable 
in 
whose 
absence 
it 
is 
less 
blameworthy 
for 
people 
to 
be 
vexed; 
and 
that 
is 
more 
desirable 
in 
whose 
absence 
it 
is 
more 
blameworthy 
for 
a 
man 
not 
to 
be 
vexed.

Moreover, 
of 
things 
that 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
species 
one 
which 
possesses 
the 
peculiar 
virtue 
of 
the 
species 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
one 
which 
does 
not. 
If 
both 
possess 
it, 
then 
the 
one 
which 
possesses 
it 
in 
a 
greater 
degree 
is 
more 
desirable. 


Moreover, 
if 
one 
thing 
makes 
good 
whatever 
it 
touches, 
while 
another 
does 
not, 
the 
former 
is 
more 
desirable, 
just 
as 
also 
what 
makes 
things 
warm 
is 
warmer 
than 
what 
does 
not. 
If 
both 
do 
so, 
then 
that 
one 
is 
more 
desirable 
which 
does 
so 
in 
a 
greater 
degree, 
or 
if 
it 
render 
good 
the 
better 
and 
more 
important 
object-if 
(e.g.), 
the 
one 
makes 
good 
the 
soul, 
and 
the 
other 
the 



body. 


Moreover, 
judge 
things 
by 
their 
inflexions 
and 
uses 
and 
actions 
and 
works, 
and 
judge 
these 
by 
them: 
for 
they 
go 
with 
each 
other: 
e.g. 
if 
‘justly’ 
means 
something 
more 
desirable 
than 
‘courageously’, 
then 
also 
justice 
means 
something 
more 
desirable 
than 
courage; 
and 
if 
justice 
be 
more 
desirable 
than 
courage, 
then 
also 
‘justly’ 
means 
something 
more 
desirable 
than 
‘courageously’. 
Similarly 
also 
in 
the 
other 
cases. 


Moreover, 
if 
one 
thing 
exceeds 
while 
the 
other 
falls 
short 
of 
the 
same 
standard 
of 
good, 
the 
one 
which 
exceeds 
is 
the 
more 
desirable; 
or 
if 
the 
one 
exceeds 
an 
even 
higher 
standard. 
Nay 
more, 
if 
there 
be 
two 
things 
both 
preferable 
to 
something, 
the 
one 
which 
is 
more 
highly 
preferable 
to 
it 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
the 
less 
highly 
preferable. 
Moreover, 
when 
the 
excess 
of 
a 
thing 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
the 
excess 
of 
something 
else, 
that 
thing 
is 
itself 
also 
more 
desirable 
than 
the 
other, 
as 
(e.g.) 
friendship 
than 
money: 
for 
an 
excess 
of 
friendship 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
an 
excess 
of 
money. 
So 
also 
that 
of 
which 
a 
man 
would 
rather 
that 
it 
were 
his 
by 
his 
own 
doing 
is 
more 
desirable 
than 
what 
he 
would 
rather 
get 
by 
another’s 
doing, 
e.g. 
friends 
than 
money. 
Moreover, 
judge 
by 
means 
of 
an 
addition, 
and 
see 
if 
the 
addition 
of 
A 
to 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
B 
makes 
the 
whole 
more 
desirable 
than 
does 
the 
addition 
of 
B. 
You 
must, 
however, 
beware 
of 
adducing 
a 
case 
in 
which 
the 
common 
term 
uses, 
or 
in 
some 
other 
way 
helps 
the 
case 
of, 
one 
of 
the 
things 
added 
to 
it, 
but 
not 
the 
other, 
as 
(e.g.) 
if 
you 
took 
a 
saw 
and 
a 
sickle 
in 
combination 
with 
the 
art 
of 
carpentry: 
for 
in 
the 
combination 
the 
saw 
is 
a 
more 
desirable 
thing, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
a 
more 
desirable 
thing 
without 
qualification. 
Again, 
a 
thing 
is 
more 
desirable 
if, 
when 
added 
to 
a 
lesser 
good, 
it 
makes 
the 
whole 
greater 
good. 
Likewise, 
also, 
you 
should 
judge 
by 
means 
of 
subtraction: 
for 
the 
thing 
upon 
whose 
subtraction 
the 
remainder 
is 
a 
lesser 
good 
may 
be 
taken 
to 
be 
a 
greater 
good, 
whichever 
it 
be 
whose 
subtraction 
makes 
the 
remainder 
a 
lesser 
good. 


Also, 
if 
one 
thing 
be 
desirable 
for 
itself, 
and 
the 
other 
for 
the 
look 
of 
it, 
the 
former 
is 
more 
desirable, 
as 
(e.g.) 
health 
than 
beauty. 
A 
thing 
is 
defined 
as 
being 
desired 
for 
the 
look 
of 
it 
if, 
supposing 
no 
one 
knew 
of 
it, 
you 
would 
not 
care 
to 
have 
it. 
Also, 
it 
is 
more 
desirable 
both 
for 
itself 
and 
for 
the 
look 
of 
it, 
while 
the 
other 
thing 
is 
desirable 
on 
the 
one 
ground 
alone. 
Also, 
whichever 
is 
the 
more 
precious 
for 
itself, 
is 
also 
better 
and 
more 
desirable. 
A 
thing 
may 
be 
taken 
to 
be 
more 
precious 
in 
itself 
which 
we 
choose 
rather 
for 
itself, 
without 
anything 
else 
being 
likely 
to 
come 
of 
it. 



Moreover, 
you 
should 
distinguish 
in 
how 
many 
senses 
‘desirable’ 
is 
used, 
and 
with 
a 
view 
to 
what 
ends, 
e.g. 
expediency 
or 
honour 
or 
pleasure. 
For 
what 
is 
useful 
for 
all 
or 
most 
of 
them 
may 
be 
taken 
to 
be 
more 
desirable 
than 
what 
is 
not 
useful 
in 
like 
manner. 
If 
the 
same 
characters 
belong 
to 
both 
things 
you 
should 
look 
and 
see 
which 
possesses 
them 
more 
markedly, 
i.e. 
which 
of 
the 
two 
is 
the 
more 
pleasant 
or 
more 
honourable 
or 
more 
expedient. 
Again, 
that 
is 
more 
desirable 
which 
serves 
the 
better 
purpose, 
e.g. 
that 
which 
serves 
to 
promote 
virtue 
more 
than 
that 
which 
serves 
to 
promote 
pleasure. 
Likewise 
also 
in 
the 
case 
of 
objectionable 
things; 
for 
that 
is 
more 
objectionable 
which 
stands 
more 
in 
the 
way 
of 
what 
is 
desirable, 
e.g. 
disease 
more 
than 
ugliness: 
for 
disease 
is 
a 
greater 
hindrance 
both 
to 
pleasure 
and 
to 
being 
good. 


Moreover, 
argue 
by 
showing 
that 
the 
thing 
in 
question 
is 
in 
like 
measure 
objectionable 
and 
desirable: 
for 
a 
thing 
of 
such 
a 
character 
that 
a 
man 
might 
well 
desire 
and 
object 
to 
it 
alike 
is 
less 
desirable 
than 
the 
other 
which 
is 
desirable 
only.

Comparisons 
of 
things 
together 
should 
therefore 
be 
conducted 
in 
the 
manner 
prescribed. 
The 
same 
commonplace 
rules 
are 
useful 
also 
for 
showing 
that 
anything 
is 
simply 
desirable 
or 
objectionable: 
for 
we 
have 
only 
to 
subtract 
the 
excess 
of 
one 
thing 
over 
another. 
For 
if 
what 
is 
more 
precious 
be 
more 
desirable, 
then 
also 
what 
is 
precious 
is 
desirable; 
and 
if 
what 
is 
more 
useful 
be 
more 
desirable, 
then 
also 
what 
is 
useful 
is 
desirable. 
Likewise, 
also, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
other 
things 
which 
admit 
of 
comparisons 
of 
that 
kind. 
For 
in 
some 
cases 
in 
the 
very 
course 
of 
comparing 
the 
things 
together 
we 
at 
once 
assert 
also 
that 
each 
of 
them, 
or 
the 
one 
of 
them, 
is 
desirable, 
e.g. 
whenever 
we 
call 
the 
one 
good 
‘by 
nature’ 
and 
the 
other 
‘not 
by 
nature’: 
for 
dearly 
what 
is 
good 
by 
nature 
is 
desirable.

The 
commonplace 
rules 
relating 
to 
comparative 
degrees 
and 
amounts 
ought 
to 
be 
taken 
in 
the 
most 
general 
possible 
form: 
for 
when 
so 
taken 
they 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
useful 
in 
a 
larger 
number 
of 
instances. 
It 
is 
possible 
to 
render 
some 
of 
the 
actual 
rules 
given 
above 
more 
universal 
by 
a 
slight 
alteration 
of 
the 
expression, 
e.g. 
that 
what 
by 
nature 
exhibits 
such 
and 
such 
a 
quality 
exhibits 
that 
quality 
in 
a 
greater 
degree 
than 
what 
exhibits 
it 
not 
by 
nature. 
Also, 
if 
one 
thing 
does, 
and 
another 
does 
not, 
impart 
such 
and 
such 
a 
quality 
to 
that 
which 
possesses 
it, 
or 
to 
which 
it 
belongs, 
then 
whichever 
does 
impart 
it 
is 
of 
that 
quality 
in 
greater 
degree 
than 
the 
one 
which 
does 
not 
impart 
it; 
and 
if 
both 
impart 
it, 
then 
that 
one 
exhibits 
it 
in 
a 
greater 
degree 
which 
imparts 
it 
in 
a 
greater 
degree. 


Moreover, 
if 
in 
any 
character 
one 
thing 
exceeds 
and 
another 
falls 
short 
of 
the 
same 
standard; 
also, 
if 
the 
one 
exceeds 
something 
which 
exceeds 
a 
given 
standard, 
while 
the 
other 
does 
not 
reach 
that 
standard, 
then 
clearly 
the 
first-
named 
thing 
exhibits 
that 
character 
in 
a 
greater 
degree. 
Moreover, 
you 
should 
judge 
by 
means 
of 
addition, 
and 
see 
if 
A 
when 
added 
to 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
B 
imparts 
to 
the 
whole 
such 
and 
such 
a 
character 
in 
a 
more 
marked 
degree 
than 
B, 
or 
if, 
when 
added 
to 
a 
thing 
which 
exhibits 
that 
character 
in 
a 
less 
degree, 
it 
imparts 
that 
character 
to 
the 
whole 
in 
a 
greater 
degree. 
Likewise, 
also, 
you 
may 
judge 
by 
means 
of 
subtraction: 
for 
a 
thing 
upon 
whose 
subtraction 
the 
remainder 
exhibits 
such 
and 
such 
a 
character 
in 
a 
less 
degree, 
itself 
exhibits 
that 
character 
in 
a 
greater 
degree. 
Also, 
things 
exhibit 
such 
and 
such 
a 
character 
in 
a 
greater 
degree 
if 
more 
free 
from 
admixture 
with 
their 
contraries; 
e.g. 
that 
is 
whiter 
which 
is 
more 
free 
from 
admixture 
with 
black. 
Moreover, 
apart 
from 
the 
rules 
given 
above, 
that 
has 
such 
and 
such 
a 
character 
in 
greater 
degree 
which 
admits 
in 
a 
greater 
degree 
of 
the 
definition 
proper 
to 
the 
given 
character; 
e.g. 
if 
the 
definition 
of 
‘white’ 
be 
‘a 
colour 
which 
pierces 
the 
vision’, 
then 
that 
is 
whiter 
which 
is 
in 
a 
greater 
degree 
a 
colour 
that 
pierces 
the 
vision.

If 
the 
question 
be 
put 
in 
a 
particular 
and 
not 
in 
a 
universal 
form, 
in 
the 
first 
place 
the 
universal 
constructive 
or 
destructive 
commonplace 
rules 
that 
have 
been 
given 
may 
all 
be 
brought 
into 
use. 
For 
in 
demolishing 
or 
establishing 
a 



thing 
universally 
we 
also 
show 
it 
in 
particular: 
for 
if 
it 
be 
true 
of 
all, 
it 
is 
true 
also 
of 
some, 
and 
if 
untrue 
of 
all, 
it 
is 
untrue 
of 
some. 
Especially 
handy 
and 
of 
general 
application 
are 
the 
commonplace 
rules 
that 
are 
drawn 
from 
the 
opposites 
and 
co-ordinates 
and 
inflexions 
of 
a 
thing: 
for 
public 
opinion 
grants 
alike 
the 
claim 
that 
if 
all 
pleasure 
be 
good, 
then 
also 
all 
pain 
is 
evil, 
and 
the 
claim 
that 
if 
some 
pleasure 
be 
good, 
then 
also 
some 
pain 
is 
evil. 
Moreover, 
if 
some 
form 
of 
sensation 
be 
not 
a 
capacity, 
then 
also 
some 
form 
of 
failure 
of 
sensation 
is 
not 
a 
failure 
of 
capacity. 
Also, 
if 
the 
object 
of 
conception 
is 
in 
some 
cases 
an 
object 
of 
knowledge, 
then 
also 
some 
form 
of 
conceiving 
is 
knowledge. 
Again, 
if 
what 
is 
unjust 
be 
in 
some 
cases 
good, 
then 
also 
what 
is 
just 
is 
in 
some 
cases 
evil; 
and 
if 
what 
happens 
justly 
is 
in 
some 
cases 
evil, 
then 
also 
what 
happens 
unjustly 
is 
in 
some 
cases 
good. 
Also, 
if 
what 
is 
pleasant 
is 
in 
some 
cases 
objectionable, 
then 
pleasure 
is 
in 
some 
cases 
an 
objectionable 
thing. 
On 
the 
same 
principle, 
also, 
if 
what 
is 
pleasant 
is 
in 
some 
cases 
beneficial, 
then 
pleasure 
is 
in 
some 
cases 
a 
beneficial 
thing. 
The 
case 
is 
the 
same 
also 
as 
regards 
the 
things 
that 
destroy, 
and 
the 
processes 
of 
generation 
and 
destruction. 
For 
if 
anything 
that 
destroys 
pleasure 
or 
knowledge 
be 
in 
some 
cases 
good, 
then 
we 
may 
take 
it 
that 
pleasure 
or 
knowledge 
is 
in 
some 
cases 
an 
evil 
thing. 
Likewise, 
also, 
if 
the 
destruction 
of 
knowledge 
be 
in 
some 
cases 
a 
good 
thing 
or 
its 
production 
an 
evil 
thing, 
then 
knowledge 
will 
be 
in 
some 
cases 
an 
evil 
thing; 
e.g. 
if 
for 
a 
man 
to 
forget 
his 
disgraceful 
conduct 
be 
a 
good 
thing, 
and 
to 
remember 
it 
be 
an 
evil 
thing, 
then 
the 
knowledge 
of 
his 
disgraceful 
conduct 
may 
be 
taken 
to 
be 
an 
evil 
thing. 
The 
same 
holds 
also 
in 
other 
cases: 
in 
all 
such 
cases 
the 
premiss 
and 
the 
conclusion 
are 
equally 
likely 
to 
be 
accepted. 


Moreover 
you 
should 
judge 
by 
means 
of 
greater 
or 
smaller 
or 
like 
degrees: 
for 
if 
some 
member 
of 
another 
genus 
exhibit 
such 
and 
such 
a 
character 
in 
a 
more 
marked 
degree 
than 
your 
object, 
while 
no 
member 
of 
that 
genus 
exhibits 
that 
character 
at 
all, 
then 
you 
may 
take 
it 
that 
neither 
does 
the 
object 
in 
question 
exhibit 
it; 
e.g. 
if 
some 
form 
of 
knowledge 
be 
good 
in 
a 
greater 
degree 
than 
pleasure, 
while 
no 
form 
of 
knowledge 
is 
good, 
then 
you 
may 
take 
it 
that 
pleasure 
is 
not 
good 
either. 
Also, 
you 
should 
judge 
by 
a 
smaller 
or 
like 
degree 
in 
the 
same 
way: 
for 
so 
you 
will 
find 
it 
possible 
both 
to 
demolish 
and 
to 
establish 
a 
view, 
except 
that 
whereas 
both 
are 
possible 
by 
means 
of 
like 
degrees, 
by 
means 
of 
a 
smaller 
degree 
it 
is 
possible 
only 
to 
establish, 
not 
to 
overthrow. 
For 
if 
a 
certain 
form 
of 
capacity 
be 
good 
in 
a 
like 
degree 
to 
knowledge, 
and 
a 
certain 
form 
of 
capacity 
be 
good, 
then 
so 
also 
is 



knowledge; 
while 
if 
no 
form 
of 
capacity 
be 
good, 
then 
neither 
is 
knowledge. 
If, 
too, 
a 
certain 
form 
of 
capacity 
be 
good 
in 
a 
less 
degree 
than 
knowledge, 
and 
a 
certain 
form 
of 
capacity 
be 
good, 
then 
so 
also 
is 
knowledge; 
but 
if 
no 
form 
of 
capacity 
be 
good, 
there 
is 
no 
necessity 
that 
no 
form 
of 
knowledge 
either 
should 
be 
good. 
Clearly, 
then, 
it 
is 
only 
possible 
to 
establish 
a 
view 
by 
means 
of 
a 
less 
degree. 


Not 
only 
by 
means 
of 
another 
genus 
can 
you 
overthrow 
a 
view, 
but 
also 
by 
means 
of 
the 
same, 
if 
you 
take 
the 
most 
marked 
instance 
of 
the 
character 
in 
question; 
e.g. 
if 
it 
be 
maintained 
that 
some 
form 
of 
knowledge 
is 
good, 
then, 
suppose 
it 
to 
be 
shown 
that 
prudence 
is 
not 
good, 
neither 
will 
any 
other 
kind 
be 
good, 
seeing 
that 
not 
even 
the 
kind 
upon 
which 
there 
is 
most 
general 
agreement 
is 
so. 
Moreover, 
you 
should 
go 
to 
work 
by 
means 
of 
an 
hypothesis; 
you 
should 
claim 
that 
the 
attribute, 
if 
it 
belongs 
or 
does 
not 
belong 
in 
one 
case, 
does 
so 
in 
a 
like 
degree 
in 
all, 
e.g. 
that 
if 
the 
soul 
of 
man 
be 
immortal, 
so 
are 
other 
souls 
as 
well, 
while 
if 
this 
one 
be 
not 
so, 
neither 
are 
the 
others. 
If, 
then, 
it 
be 
maintained 
that 
in 
some 
instance 
the 
attribute 
belongs, 
you 
must 
show 
that 
in 
some 
instance 
it 
does 
not 
belong: 
for 
then 
it 
will 
follow, 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
hypothesis, 
that 
it 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
any 
instance 
at 
all. 
If, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
be 
maintained 
that 
it 
does 
not 
belong 
in 
some 
instance, 
you 
must 
show 
that 
it 
does 
belong 
in 
some 
instance, 
for 
in 
this 
way 
it 
will 
follow 
that 
it 
belongs 
to 
all 
instances. 
It 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
maker 
of 
the 
hypothesis 
universalizes 
the 
question, 
whereas 
it 
was 
stated 
in 
a 
particular 
form: 
for 
he 
claims 
that 
the 
maker 
of 
a 
particular 
admission 
should 
make 
a 
universal 
admission, 
inasmuch 
as 
he 
claims 
that 
if 
the 
attribute 
belongs 
in 
one 
instance, 
it 
belongs 
also 
in 
all 
instances 
alike. 


If 
the 
problem 
be 
indefinite, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
overthrow 
a 
statement 
in 
only 
one 
way; 
e.g. 
if 
a 
man 
has 
asserted 
that 
pleasure 
is 
good 
or 
is 
not 
good, 
without 
any 
further 
definition. 
For 
if 
he 
meant 
that 
a 
particular 
pleasure 
is 
good, 
you 
must 
show 
universally 
that 
no 
pleasure 
is 
good, 
if 
the 
proposition 
in 
question 
is 
to 
be 
demolished. 
And 
likewise, 
also, 
if 
he 
meant 
that 
some 
particular 
pleasure 
is 
not 
good 
you 
must 
show 
universally 
that 
all 
pleasure 
is 
good: 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
demolish 
it 
in 
any 
other 
way. 
For 
if 
we 
show 
that 
some 
particular 
pleasure 
is 
not 
good 
or 
is 
good, 
the 
proposition 
in 
question 
is 
not 
yet 
demolished. 
It 
is 
clear, 
then, 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
demolish 
an 
indefinite 
statement 
in 
one 
way 
only, 
whereas 
it 
can 
be 
established 
in 
two 
ways: 
for 
whether 
we 
show 
universally 
that 
all 
pleasure 
is 
good, 
or 
whether 
we 
show 
that 
a 
particular 
pleasure 
is 
good, 
the 
proposition 
in 
question 
will 



have 
been 
proved. 
Likewise, 
also, 
supposing 
we 
are 
required 
to 
argue 
that 
some 
particular 
pleasure 
is 
not 
good, 
if 
we 
show 
that 
no 
pleasure 
is 
good 
or 
that 
a 
particular 
pleasure 
is 
not 
good, 
we 
shall 
have 
produced 
an 
argument 
in 
both 
ways, 
both 
universally 
and 
in 
particular, 
to 
show 
that 
some 
particular 
pleasure 
is 
not 
good. 
If, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
statement 
made 
be 
definite, 
it 
will 
be 
possible 
to 
demolish 
it 
in 
two 
ways; 
e.g. 
if 
it 
be 
maintained 
that 
it 
is 
an 
attribute 
of 
some 
particular 
pleasure 
to 
be 
good, 
while 
of 
some 
it 
is 
not: 
for 
whether 
it 
be 
shown 
that 
all 
pleasure, 
or 
that 
no 
pleasure, 
is 
good, 
the 
proposition 
in 
question 
will 
have 
been 
demolished. 
If, 
however, 
he 
has 
stated 
that 
only 
one 
single 
pleasure 
is 
good, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
demolish 
it 
in 
three 
ways: 
for 
by 
showing 
that 
all 
pleasure, 
or 
that 
no 
pleasure, 
or 
that 
more 
than 
one 
pleasure, 
is 
good, 
we 
shall 
have 
demolished 
the 
statement 
in 
question. 
If 
the 
statement 
be 
made 
still 
more 
definite, 
e.g. 
that 
prudence 
alone 
of 
the 
virtues 
is 
knowledge, 
there 
are 
four 
ways 
of 
demolishing 
it: 
for 
if 
it 
be 
shown 
that 
all 
virtue 
is 
knowledge, 
or 
that 
no 
virtue 
is 
so, 
or 
that 
some 
other 
virtue 


(e.g. 
justice) 
is 
so, 
or 
that 
prudence 
itself 
is 
not 
knowledge, 
the 
proposition 
in 
question 
will 
have 
been 
demolished. 
It 
is 
useful 
also 
to 
take 
a 
look 
at 
individual 
instances, 
in 
cases 
where 
some 
attribute 
has 
been 
said 
to 
belong 
or 
not 
to 
belong, 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
universal 
questions. 
Moreover, 
you 
should 
take 
a 
glance 
among 
genera, 
dividing 
them 
by 
their 
species 
until 
you 
come 
to 
those 
that 
are 
not 
further 
divisible, 
as 
has 
been 
said 
before:’ 
for 
whether 
the 
attribute 
is 
found 
to 
belong 
in 
all 
cases 
or 
in 
none, 
you 
should, 
after 
adducing 
several 
instances, 
claim 
that 
he 
should 
either 
admit 
your 
point 
universally, 
or 
else 
bring 
an 
objection 
showing 
in 
what 
case 
it 
does 
not 
hold. 
Moreover, 
in 
cases 
where 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
make 
the 
accident 
definite 
either 
specifically 
or 
numerically, 
you 
should 
look 
and 
see 
whether 
perhaps 
none 
of 
them 
belongs, 
showing 
e.g. 
that 
time 
is 
not 
moved, 
nor 
yet 
a 
movement, 
by 
enumerating 
how 
many 
species 
there 
are 
of 
movement: 
for 
if 
none 
of 
these 
belong 
to 
time, 
clearly 
it 
does 
not 
move, 
nor 
yet 
is 
a 
movement. 
Likewise, 
also, 
you 
can 
show 
that 
the 
soul 
is 
not 
a 
number, 
by 
dividing 
all 
numbers 
into 
either 
odd 
or 
even: 
for 
then, 
if 
the 
soul 
be 
neither 
odd 
nor 
even, 
clearly 
it 
is 
not 
a 
number. 


In 
regard 
then 
to 
Accident, 
you 
should 
set 
to 
work 
by 
means 
like 
these, 
and 
in 
this 
manner.

Next 
we 
must 
go 
on 
to 
examine 
questions 
relating 
to 
Genus 
and 
Property. 
These 
are 
elements 
in 
the 
questions 
that 
relate 
to 
definitions, 
but 
dialecticians 
seldom 
address 
their 
inquiries 
to 
these 
by 
themselves. 
If, 
then, 
a 
genus 
be 
suggested 
for 
something 
that 
is, 
first 
take 
a 
look 
at 
all 
objects 
which 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
genus 
as 
the 
thing 
mentioned, 
and 
see 
whether 
the 
genus 
suggested 
is 
not 
predicated 
of 
one 
of 
them, 
as 
happens 
in 
the 
case 
of 
an 
accident: 
e.g. 
if 
‘good’ 
be 
laid 
down 
to 
be 
the 
genus 
of 
‘pleasure’, 
see 
whether 
some 
particular 
pleasure 
be 
not 
good: 
for, 
if 
so, 
clearly 
good’ 
is 
not 
the 
genus 
of 
pleasure: 
for 
the 
genus 
is 
predicated 
of 
all 
the 
members 
of 
the 
same 
species. 
Secondly, 
see 
whether 
it 
be 
predicated 
not 
in 
the 
category 
of 
essence, 
but 
as 
an 
accident, 
as 
‘white’ 
is 
predicated 
of 
‘snow’, 
or 
‘self-moved’ 
of 
the 
soul. 
For 
‘snow’ 
is 
not 
a 
kind 
of 
‘white’, 
and 
therefore 
‘white’ 
is 
not 
the 
genus 
of 
snow, 
nor 
is 
the 
soul 
a 
kind 
of 
‘moving 
object’: 
its 
motion 
is 
an 
accident 
of 
it, 
as 
it 
often 
is 
of 
an 
animal 
to 
walk 
or 
to 
be 
walking. 
Moreover, 
‘moving’ 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
indicate 
the 
essence, 
but 
rather 
a 
state 
of 
doing 
or 
of 
having 
something 
done 
to 
it. 
Likewise, 
also, 
‘white’: 
for 
it 
indicates 
not 
the 
essence 
of 
snow, 
but 
a 
certain 
quality 
of 
it. 
So 
that 
neither 
of 
them 
is 
predicated 
in 
the 
category 
of 
‘essence’. 


Especially 
you 
should 
take 
a 
look 
at 
the 
definition 
of 
Accident, 
and 
see 
whether 
it 
fits 
the 
genus 
mentioned, 
as 
(e.g.) 
is 
also 
the 
case 
in 
the 
instances 
just 
given. 
For 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
a 
thing 
to 
be 
and 
not 
to 
be 
self-moved, 
and 
likewise, 
also, 
for 
it 
to 
be 
and 
not 
to 
be 
white. 
So 
that 
neither 
of 
these 
attributes 
is 
the 
genus 
but 
an 
accident, 
since 
we 
were 
saying 
that 
an 
accident 
is 
an 
attribute 
which 
can 
belong 
to 
a 
thing 
and 
also 
not 
belong. 


Moreover, 
see 
whether 
the 
genus 
and 
the 
species 
be 
not 
found 
in 
the 
same 
division, 
but 
the 
one 
be 
a 
substance 
while 
the 
other 
is 
a 
quality, 
or 
the 
one 
be 



a 
relative 
while 
the 
other 
is 
a 
quality, 
as 
(e.g.) 
‘slow’ 
and 
‘swan’ 
are 
each 
a 
substance, 
while 
‘white’ 
is 
not 
a 
substance 
but 
a 
quality, 
so 
that 
‘white’ 
is 
not 
the 
genus 
either 
of 
‘snow’ 
or 
of 
‘swan’. 
Again, 
knowledge’ 
is 
a 
relative, 
while 
‘good’ 
and 
‘noble’ 
are 
each 
a 
quality, 
so 
that 
good, 
or 
noble, 
is 
not 
the 
genus 
of 
knowledge. 
For 
the 
genera 
of 
relatives 
ought 
themselves 
also 
to 
be 
relatives, 
as 
is 
the 
case 
with 
‘double’: 
for 
multiple’, 
which 
is 
the 
genus 
of 
‘double’, 
is 
itself 
also 
a 
relative. 
To 
speak 
generally, 
the 
genus 
ought 
to 
fall 
under 
the 
same 
division 
as 
the 
species: 
for 
if 
the 
species 
be 
a 
substance, 
so 
too 
should 
be 
the 
genus, 
and 
if 
the 
species 
be 
a 
quality, 
so 
too 
the 
genus 
should 
be 
a 
quality; 
e.g. 
if 
white 
be 
a 
quality, 
so 
too 
should 
colour 
be. 
Likewise, 
also, 
in 
other 
cases. 


Again, 
see 
whether 
it 
be 
necessary 
or 
possible 
for 
the 
genus 
to 
partake 
of 
the 
object 
which 
has 
been 
placed 
in 
the 
genus. 
‘To 
partake’ 
is 
defined 
as 
‘to 
admit 
the 
definition 
of 
that 
which 
is 
partaken. 
Clearly, 
therefore, 
the 
species 
partake 
of 
the 
genera, 
but 
not 
the 
genera 
of 
the 
species: 
for 
the 
species 
admits 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
genus, 
whereas 
the 
genus 
does 
not 
admit 
that 
of 
the 
species. 
You 
must 
look, 
therefore, 
and 
see 
whether 
the 
genus 
rendered 
partakes 
or 
can 
possibly 
partake 
of 
the 
species, 
e.g. 
if 
any 
one 
were 
to 
render 
anything 
as 
genus 
of 
‘being’ 
or 
of 
‘unity’: 
for 
then 
the 
result 
will 
be 
that 
the 
genus 
partakes 
of 
the 
species: 
for 
of 
everything 
that 
is, 
‘being’ 
and 
‘unity’ 
are 
predicated, 
and 
therefore 
their 
definition 
as 
well. 


Moreover, 
see 
if 
there 
be 
anything 
of 
which 
the 
species 
rendered 
is 
true, 
while 
the 
genus 
is 
not 
so, 
e.g. 
supposing 
‘being’ 
or 
‘object 
of 
knowledge’ 
were 
stated 
to 
be 
the 
genus 
of 
‘object 
of 
opinion’. 
For 
‘object 
of 
opinion’ 
will 
be 
a 
predicate 
of 
what 
does 
not 
exist; 
for 
many 
things 
which 
do 
not 
exist 
are 
objects 
of 
opinion; 
whereas 
that 
‘being’ 
or 
‘object 
of 
knowledge’ 
is 
not 
predicated 
of 
what 
does 
not 
exist 
is 
clear. 
So 
that 
neither 
‘being’ 
nor 
‘object 
of 
knowledge’ 
is 
the 
genus 
of 
‘object 
of 
opinion’: 
for 
of 
the 
objects 
of 
which 
the 
species 
is 
predicated, 
the 
genus 
ought 
to 
be 
predicated 
as 
well. 


Again, 
see 
whether 
the 
object 
placed 
in 
the 
genus 
be 
quite 
unable 
to 
partake 
of 
any 
of 
its 
species: 
for 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
it 
should 
partake 
of 
the 
genus 
if 
it 
do 
not 
partake 
of 
any 
of 
its 
species, 
except 
it 
be 
one 
of 
the 
species 
reached 
by 
the 
first 
division: 
these 
do 
partake 
of 
the 
genus 
alone. 
If, 
therefore, 
‘Motion’ 
be 
stated 
as 
the 
genus 
of 
pleasure, 
you 
should 
look 
and 
see 
if 
pleasure 
be 
neither 
locomotion 
nor 
alteration, 
nor 
any 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
given 
modes 
of 
motion: 
for 
clearly 
you 
may 
then 
take 
it 
that 
it 
does 
not 
partake 
of 
any 
of 
the 
species, 
and 
therefore 
not 
of 
the 
genus 
either, 
since 
what 



partakes 
of 
the 
genus 
must 
necessarily 
partake 
of 
one 
of 
the 
species 
as 
well: 
so 
that 
pleasure 
could 
not 
be 
a 
species 
of 
Motion, 
nor 
yet 
be 
one 
of 
the 
individual 
phenomena 
comprised 
under 
the 
term 
‘motion’. 
For 
individuals 
as 
well 
partake 
in 
the 
genus 
and 
the 
species, 
as 
(e.g.) 
an 
individual 
man 
partakes 
of 
both 
‘man’ 
and 
‘animal’. 


Moreover, 
see 
if 
the 
term 
placed 
in 
the 
genus 
has 
a 
wider 
denotation 
than 
the 
genus, 
as 
(e.g.) 
‘object 
of 
opinion’ 
has, 
as 
compared 
with 
‘being’: 
for 
both 
what 
is 
and 
what 
is 
not 
are 
objects 
of 
opinion, 
so 
that 
‘object 
of 
opinion’ 
could 
not 
be 
a 
species 
of 
being: 
for 
the 
genus 
is 
always 
of 
wider 
denotation 
than 
the 
species. 
Again, 
see 
if 
the 
species 
and 
its 
genus 
have 
an 
equal 
denotation; 
suppose, 
for 
instance, 
that 
of 
the 
attributes 
which 
go 
with 
everything, 
one 
were 
to 
be 
stated 
as 
a 
species 
and 
the 
other 
as 
its 
genus, 
as 
for 
example 
Being 
and 
Unity: 
for 
everything 
has 
being 
and 
unity, 
so 
that 
neither 
is 
the 
genus 
of 
the 
other, 
since 
their 
denotation 
is 
equal. 
Likewise, 
also, 
if 
the 
‘first’ 
of 
a 
series 
and 
the 
‘beginning’ 
were 
to 
be 
placed 
one 
under 
the 
other: 
for 
the 
beginning 
is 
first 
and 
the 
first 
is 
the 
beginning, 
so 
that 
either 
both 
expressions 
are 
identical 
or 
at 
any 
rate 
neither 
is 
the 
genus 
of 
the 
other. 
The 
elementary 
principle 
in 
regard 
to 
all 
such 
cases 
is 
that 
the 
genus 
has 
a 
wider 
denotation 
than 
the 
species 
and 
its 
differentia: 
for 
the 
differentia 
as 
well 
has 
a 
narrower 
denotation 
than 
the 
genus. 


See 
also 
whether 
the 
genus 
mentioned 
fails, 
or 
might 
be 
generally 
thought 
to 
fail, 
to 
apply 
to 
some 
object 
which 
is 
not 
specifically 
different 
from 
the 
thing 
in 
question; 
or, 
if 
your 
argument 
be 
constructive, 
whether 
it 
does 
so 
apply. 
For 
all 
things 
that 
are 
not 
specifically 
different 
have 
the 
same 
genus. 
If, 
therefore, 
it 
be 
shown 
to 
apply 
to 
one, 
then 
clearly 
it 
applies 
to 
all, 
and 
if 
it 
fails 
to 
apply 
to 
one, 
clearly 
it 
fails 
to 
apply 
to 
any; 
e.g. 
if 
any 
one 
who 
assumes 
‘indivisible 
lines’ 
were 
to 
say 
that 
the 
‘indivisible’ 
is 
their 
genus. 
For 
the 
aforesaid 
term 
is 
not 
the 
genus 
of 
divisible 
lines, 
and 
these 
do 
not 
differ 
as 
regards 
their 
species 
from 
indivisible: 
for 
straight 
lines 
are 
never 
different 
from 
each 
other 
as 
regards 
their 
species.

Look 
and 
see, 
also, 
if 
there 
be 
any 
other 
genus 
of 
the 
given 
species 
which 
neither 
embraces 
the 
genus 
rendered 
nor 
yet 
falls 
under 
it, 
e.g. 
suppose 
any 



one 
were 
to 
lay 
down 
that 
‘knowledge’ 
is 
the 
genus 
of 
justice. 
For 
virtue 
is 
its 
genus 
as 
well, 
and 
neither 
of 
these 
genera 
embraces 
the 
remaining 
one, 
so 
that 
knowledge 
could 
not 
be 
the 
genus 
of 
justice: 
for 
it 
is 
generally 
accepted 
that 
whenever 
one 
species 
falls 
under 
two 
genera, 
the 
one 
is 
embraced 
by 
the 
other. 
Yet 
a 
principle 
of 
this 
kind 
gives 
rise 
to 
a 
difficulty 
in 
some 
cases. 
For 
some 
people 
hold 
that 
prudence 
is 
both 
virtue 
and 
knowledge, 
and 
that 
neither 
of 
its 
genera 
is 
embraced 
by 
the 
other: 
although 
certainly 
not 
everybody 
admits 
that 
prudence 
is 
knowledge. 
If, 
however, 
any 
one 
were 
to 
admit 
the 
truth 
of 
this 
assertion, 
yet 
it 
would 
still 
be 
generally 
agreed 
to 
be 
necessary 
that 
the 
genera 
of 
the 
same 
object 
must 
at 
any 
rate 
be 
subordinate 
either 
the 
one 
to 
the 
other 
or 
both 
to 
the 
same, 
as 
actually 
is 
the 
case 
with 
virtue 
and 
knowledge. 
For 
both 
fall 
under 
the 
same 
genus; 
for 
each 
of 
them 
is 
a 
state 
and 
a 
disposition. 
You 
should 
look, 
therefore, 
and 
see 
whether 
neither 
of 
these 
things 
is 
true 
of 
the 
genus 
rendered; 
for 
if 
the 
genera 
be 
subordinate 
neither 
the 
one 
to 
the 
other 
nor 
both 
to 
the 
same, 
then 
what 
is 
rendered 
could 
not 
be 
the 
true 
genus. 


Look, 
also, 
at 
the 
genus 
of 
the 
genus 
rendered, 
and 
so 
continually 
at 
the 
next 
higher 
genus, 
and 
see 
whether 
all 
are 
predicated 
of 
the 
species, 
and 
predicated 
in 
the 
category 
of 
essence: 
for 
all 
the 
higher 
genera 
should 
be 
predicated 
of 
the 
species 
in 
the 
category 
of 
essence. 
If, 
then, 
there 
be 
anywhere 
a 
discrepancy, 
clearly 
what 
is 
rendered 
is 
not 
the 
true 
genus. 
[Again, 
see 
whether 
either 
the 
genus 
itself, 
or 
one 
of 
its 
higher 
genera, 
partakes 
of 
the 
species: 
for 
the 
higher 
genus 
does 
not 
partake 
of 
any 
of 
the 
lower.] 
If, 
then, 
you 
are 
overthrowing 
a 
view, 
follow 
the 
rule 
as 
given: 
if 
establishing 
one, 
then-suppose 
that 
what 
has 
been 
named 
as 
genus 
be 
admitted 
to 
belong 
to 
the 
species, 
only 
it 
be 
disputed 
whether 
it 
belongs 
as 
genus-it 
is 
enough 
to 
show 
that 
one 
of 
its 
higher 
genera 
is 
predicated 
of 
the 
species 
in 
the 
category 
of 
essence. 
For 
if 
one 
of 
them 
be 
predicated 
in 
the 
category 
of 
essence, 
all 
of 
them, 
both 
higher 
and 
lower 
than 
this 
one, 
if 
predicated 
at 
all 
of 
the 
species, 
will 
be 
predicated 
of 
it 
in 
the 
category 
of 
essence: 
so 
that 
what 
has 
been 
rendered 
as 
genus 
is 
also 
predicated 
in 
the 
category 
of 
essence. 
The 
premiss 
that 
when 
one 
genus 
is 
predicated 
in 
the 
category 
of 
essence, 
all 
the 
rest, 
if 
predicated 
at 
all, 
will 
be 
predicated 
in 
the 
category 
of 
essence, 
should 
be 
secured 
by 
induction. 
Supposing, 
however, 
that 
it 
be 
disputed 
whether 
what 
has 
been 
rendered 
as 
genus 
belongs 
at 
all, 
it 
is 
not 
enough 
to 
show 
that 
one 
of 
the 
higher 
genera 
is 
predicated 
of 
the 
species 
in 
the 
category 
of 
essence: 
e.g. 
if 
any 
one 
has 
rendered 
‘locomotion’ 



as 
the 
genus 
of 
walking, 
it 
is 
not 
enough 
to 
show 
that 
walking 
is 
‘motion’ 
in 
order 
to 
show 
that 
it 
is 
‘locomotion’, 
seeing 
that 
there 
are 
other 
forms 
of 
motion 
as 
well; 
but 
one 
must 
show 
in 
addition 
that 
walking 
does 
not 
partake 
of 
any 
of 
the 
species 
of 
motion 
produced 
by 
the 
same 
division 
except 
locomotion. 
For 
of 
necessity 
what 
partakes 
of 
the 
genus 
partakes 
also 
of 
one 
of 
the 
species 
produced 
by 
the 
first 
division 
of 
the 
genus. 
If, 
therefore, 
walking 
does 
not 
partake 
either 
of 
increase 
or 
decrease 
or 
of 
the 
other 
kinds 
of 
motion, 
clearly 
it 
would 
partake 
of 
locomotion, 
so 
that 
locomotion 
would 
be 
the 
genus 
of 
walking. 


Again, 
look 
among 
the 
things 
of 
which 
the 
given 
species 
is 
predicated 
as 
genus, 
and 
see 
if 
what 
is 
rendered 
as 
its 
genus 
be 
also 
predicated 
in 
the 
category 
of 
essence 
of 
the 
very 
things 
of 
which 
the 
species 
is 
so 
predicated, 
and 
likewise 
if 
all 
the 
genera 
higher 
than 
this 
genus 
are 
so 
predicated 
as 
well. 
For 
if 
there 
be 
anywhere 
a 
discrepancy, 
clearly 
what 
has 
been 
rendered 
is 
not 
the 
true 
genus: 
for 
had 
it 
been 
the 
genus, 
then 
both 
the 
genera 
higher 
than 
it, 
and 
it 
itself, 
would 
all 
have 
been 
predicated 
in 
the 
category 
of 
essence 
of 
those 
objects 
of 
which 
the 
species 
too 
is 
predicated 
in 
the 
category 
of 
essence. 
If, 
then, 
you 
are 
overthrowing 
a 
view, 
it 
is 
useful 
to 
see 
whether 
the 
genus 
fails 
to 
be 
predicated 
in 
the 
category 
of 
essence 
of 
those 
things 
of 
which 
the 
species 
too 
is 
predicated. 
If 
establishing 
a 
view, 
it 
is 
useful 
to 
see 
whether 
it 
is 
predicated 
in 
the 
category 
of 
essence: 
for 
if 
so, 
the 
result 
will 
be 
that 
the 
genus 
and 
the 
species 
will 
be 
predicated 
of 
the 
same 
object 
in 
the 
category 
of 
essence, 
so 
that 
the 
same 
object 
falls 
under 
two 
genera: 
the 
genera 
must 
therefore 
of 
necessity 
be 
subordinate 
one 
to 
the 
other, 
and 
therefore 
if 
it 
be 
shown 
that 
the 
one 
we 
wish 
to 
establish 
as 
genus 
is 
not 
subordinate 
to 
the 
species, 
clearly 
the 
species 
would 
be 
subordinate 
to 
it, 
so 
that 
you 
may 
take 
it 
as 
shown 
that 
it 
is 
the 
genus. 


Look, 
also, 
at 
the 
definitions 
of 
the 
genera, 
and 
see 
whether 
they 
apply 
both 
to 
the 
given 
species 
and 
to 
the 
objects 
which 
partake 
of 
the 
species. 
For 
of 
necessity 
the 
definitions 
of 
its 
genera 
must 
be 
predicated 
of 
the 
species 
and 
of 
the 
objects 
which 
partake 
of 
the 
species: 
if, 
then, 
there 
be 
anywhere 
a 
discrepancy, 
clearly 
what 
has 
been 
rendered 
is 
not 
the 
genus. 


Again, 
see 
if 
he 
has 
rendered 
the 
differentia 
as 
the 
genus, 
e.g. 
‘immortal’ 
as 
the 
genus 
of 
‘God’. 
For 
‘immortal’ 
is 
a 
differentia 
of 
‘living 
being’, 
seeing 
that 
of 
living 
beings 
some 
are 
mortal 
and 
others 
immortal. 
Clearly, 
then, 
a 
bad 
mistake 
has 
been 
made; 
for 
the 
differentia 
of 
a 
thing 
is 
never 
its 
genus. 
And 
that 
this 
is 
true 
is 
clear: 
for 
a 
thing’s 
differentia 
never 
signifies 
its 



essence, 
but 
rather 
some 
quality, 
as 
do 
‘walking’ 
and 
‘biped’. 


Also, 
see 
whether 
he 
has 
placed 
the 
differentia 
inside 
the 
genus, 
e.g. 
by 
taking 
‘odd’ 
as 
a 
number’. 
For 
‘odd’ 
is 
a 
differentia 
of 
number, 
not 
a 
species. 
Nor 
is 
the 
differentia 
generally 
thought 
to 
partake 
of 
the 
genus: 
for 
what 
partakes 
of 
the 
genus 
is 
always 
either 
a 
species 
or 
an 
individual, 
whereas 
the 
differentia 
is 
neither 
a 
species 
nor 
an 
individual. 
Clearly, 
therefore, 
the 
differentia 
does 
not 
partake 
of 
the 
genus, 
so 
that 
‘odd’ 
too 
is 
no 
species 
but 
a 
differentia, 
seeing 
that 
it 
does 
not 
partake 
of 
the 
genus. 


Moreover, 
see 
whether 
he 
has 
placed 
the 
genus 
inside 
the 
species, 
e.g. 
by 
taking 
‘contact’ 
to 
be 
a 
‘juncture’, 
or 
‘mixture’ 
a 
‘fusion’, 
or, 
as 
in 
Plato’s 
definition,’ 
‘locomotion’ 
to 
be 
the 
same 
as 
‘carriage’. 
For 
there 
is 
no 
necessity 
that 
contact 
should 
be 
juncture: 
rather, 
conversely, 
juncture 
must 
be 
contact: 
for 
what 
is 
in 
contact 
is 
not 
always 
joined, 
though 
what 
is 
joined 
is 
always 
in 
contact. 
Likewise, 
also, 
in 
the 
remaining 
instances: 
for 
mixture 
is 
not 
always 
a 
‘fusion’ 
(for 
to 
mix 
dry 
things 
does 
not 
fuse 
them), 
nor 
is 
locomotion 
always 
‘carriage’. 
For 
walking 
is 
not 
generally 
thought 
to 
be 
carriage: 
for 
‘carriage’ 
is 
mostly 
used 
of 
things 
that 
change 
one 
place 
for 
another 
involuntarily, 
as 
happens 
in 
the 
case 
of 
inanimate 
things. 
Clearly, 
also, 
the 
species, 
in 
the 
instances 
given, 
has 
a 
wider 
denotation 
than 
the 
genus, 
whereas 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
vice 
versa. 


Again, 
see 
whether 
he 
has 
placed 
the 
differentia 
inside 
the 
species, 
by 
taking 
(e.g.) 
‘immortal’ 
to 
be 
‘a 
god’. 
For 
the 
result 
will 
be 
that 
the 
species 
has 
an 
equal 
or 
wider 
denotation: 
and 
this 
cannot 
be, 
for 
always 
the 
differentia 
has 
an 
equal 
or 
a 
wider 
denotation 
than 
the 
species. 
Moreover, 
see 
whether 
he 
has 
placed 
the 
genus 
inside 
the 
differentia, 
by 
making 
‘colour’ 
(e.g.) 
to 
be 
a 
thing 
that 
‘pierces’, 
or 
‘number’ 
a 
thing 
that 
is 
‘odd’. 
Also, 
see 
if 
he 
has 
mentioned 
the 
genus 
as 
differentia: 
for 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
a 
man 
to 
bring 
forward 
a 
statement 
of 
this 
kind 
as 
well, 
e.g. 
that 
‘mixture’ 
is 
the 
differentia 
of 
‘fusion’, 
or 
that 
change 
of 
place’ 
is 
the 
differentia 
of 
‘carriage’. 
All 
such 
cases 
should 
be 
examined 
by 
means 
of 
the 
same 
principles: 
for 
they 
depend 
upon 
common 
rules: 
for 
the 
genus 
should 
have 
a 
wider 
denotation 
that 
its 
differentia, 
and 
also 
should 
not 
partake 
of 
its 
differentia; 
whereas, 
if 
it 
be 
rendered 
in 
this 
manner, 
neither 
of 
the 
aforesaid 
requirements 
can 
be 
satisfied: 
for 
the 
genus 
will 
both 
have 
a 
narrower 
denotation 
than 
its 
differentia, 
and 
will 
partake 
of 
it. 


Again, 
if 
no 
differentia 
belonging 
to 
the 
genus 
be 
predicated 
of 
the 
given 
species, 
neither 
will 
the 
genus 
be 
predicated 
of 
it; 
e.g. 
of 
‘soul’ 
neither 
‘odd’ 



nor 
‘even’ 
is 
predicated: 
neither 
therefore 
is 
‘number’. 
Moreover, 
see 
whether 
the 
species 
is 
naturally 
prior 
and 
abolishes 
the 
genus 
along 
with 
itself: 
for 
the 
contrary 
is 
the 
general 
view. 
Moreover, 
if 
it 
be 
possible 
for 
the 
genus 
stated, 
or 
for 
its 
differentia, 
to 
be 
absent 
from 
the 
alleged 
species, 
e.g. 
for 
‘movement’ 
to 
be 
absent 
from 
the 
‘soul’, 
or 
‘truth 
and 
falsehood’ 
from 
‘opinion’, 
then 
neither 
of 
the 
terms 
stated 
could 
be 
its 
genus 
or 
its 
differentia: 
for 
the 
general 
view 
is 
that 
the 
genus 
and 
the 
differentia 
accompany 
the 
species, 
as 
long 
as 
it 
exists.

Look 
and 
see, 
also, 
if 
what 
is 
placed 
in 
the 
genus 
partakes 
or 
could 
possibly 
partake 
of 
any 
contrary 
of 
the 
genus: 
for 
in 
that 
case 
the 
same 
thing 
will 
at 
the 
same 
time 
partake 
of 
contrary 
things, 
seeing 
that 
the 
genus 
is 
never 
absent 
from 
it, 
while 
it 
partakes, 
or 
can 
possibly 
partake, 
of 
the 
contrary 
genus 
as 
well. 
Moreover, 
see 
whether 
the 
species 
shares 
in 
any 
character 
which 
it 
is 
utterly 
impossible 
for 
any 
member 
of 
the 
genus 
to 
have. 
Thus 
(e.g.) 
if 
the 
soul 
has 
a 
share 
in 
life, 
while 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
any 
number 
to 
live, 
then 
the 
soul 
could 
not 
be 
a 
species 
of 
number. 


You 
should 
look 
and 
see, 
also, 
if 
the 
species 
be 
a 
homonym 
of 
the 
genus, 
and 
employ 
as 
your 
elementary 
principles 
those 
already 
stated 
for 
dealing 
with 
homonymity: 
for 
the 
genus 
and 
the 
species 
are 
synonymous. 


Seeing 
that 
of 
every 
genus 
there 
is 
more 
than 
one 
species, 
look 
and 
see 
if 
it 
be 
impossible 
that 
there 
should 
be 
another 
species 
than 
the 
given 
one 
belonging 
to 
the 
genus 
stated: 
for 
if 
there 
should 
be 
none, 
then 
clearly 
what 
has 
been 
stated 
could 
not 
be 
a 
genus 
at 
all. 


Look 
and 
see, 
also, 
if 
he 
has 
rendered 
as 
genus 
a 
metaphorical 
expression, 
describing 
(e.g. 
‘temperance’ 
as 
a 
‘harmony’: 
a 
‘harmony’: 
for 
a 
genus 
is 
always 
predicated 
of 
its 
species 
in 
its 
literal 
sense, 
whereas 
‘harmony’ 
is 
predicated 
of 
temperance 
not 
in 
a 
literal 
sense 
but 
metaphorically: 
for 
a 
harmony 
always 
consists 
in 
notes. 


Moreover, 
if 
there 
be 
any 
contrary 
of 
the 
species, 
examine 
it. 
The 
examination 
may 
take 
different 
forms; 
first 
of 
all 
see 
if 
the 
contrary 
as 
well 
be 
found 
in 
the 
same 
genus 
as 
the 
species, 
supposing 
the 
genus 
to 
have 
no 
contrary; 
for 
contraries 
ought 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
same 
genus, 
if 
there 
be 
no 



contrary 
to 
the 
genus. 
Supposing, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
that 
there 
is 
a 
contrary 
to 
the 
genus, 
see 
if 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
species 
be 
found 
in 
the 
contrary 
genus: 
for 
of 
necessity 
the 
contrary 
species 
must 
be 
in 
the 
contrary 
genus, 
if 
there 
be 
any 
contrary 
to 
the 
genus. 
Each 
of 
these 
points 
is 
made 
plain 
by 
means 
of 
induction. 
Again, 
see 
whether 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
species 
be 
not 
found 
in 
any 
genus 
at 
all, 
but 
be 
itself 
a 
genus, 
e.g. 
‘good’: 
for 
if 
this 
be 
not 
found 
in 
any 
genus, 
neither 
will 
its 
contrary 
be 
found 
in 
any 
genus, 
but 
will 
itself 
be 
a 
genus, 
as 
happens 
in 
the 
case 
of 
‘good’ 
and 
‘evil’: 
for 
neither 
of 
these 
is 
found 
in 
a 
genus, 
but 
each 
of 
them 
is 
a 
genus. 
Moreover, 
see 
if 
both 
genus 
and 
species 
be 
contrary 
to 
something, 
and 
one 
pair 
of 
contraries 
have 
an 
intermediary, 
but 
not 
the 
other. 
For 
if 
the 
genera 
have 
an 
intermediary, 
so 
should 
their 
species 
as 
well, 
and 
if 
the 
species 
have, 
so 
should 
their 
genera 
as 
well, 
as 
is 
the 
case 
with 
(1) 
virtue 
and 
vice 
and 
(2) 
justice 
and 
injustice: 
for 
each 
pair 
has 
an 
intermediary. 
An 
objection 
to 
this 
is 
that 
there 
is 
no 
intermediary 
between 
health 
and 
disease, 
although 
there 
is 
one 
between 
evil 
and 
good. 
Or 
see 
whether, 
though 
there 
be 
indeed 
an 
intermediary 
between 
both 
pairs, 
i.e. 
both 
between 
the 
species 
and 
between 
the 
genera, 
yet 
it 
be 
not 
similarly 
related, 
but 
in 
one 
case 
be 
a 
mere 
negation 
of 
the 
extremes, 
whereas 
in 
the 
other 
case 
it 
is 
a 
subject. 
For 
the 
general 
view 
is 
that 
the 
relation 
should 
be 
similar 
in 
both 
cases, 
as 
it 
is 
in 
the 
cases 
of 
virtue 
and 
vice 
and 
of 
justice 
and 
injustice: 
for 
the 
intermediaries 
between 
both 
are 
mere 
negations. 
Moreover, 
whenever 
the 
genus 
has 
no 
contrary, 
look 
and 
see 
not 
merely 
whether 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
species 
be 
found 
in 
the 
same 
genus, 
but 
the 
intermediate 
as 
well: 
for 
the 
genus 
containing 
the 
extremes 
contains 
the 
intermediates 
as 
well, 
as 
(e.g.) 
in 
the 
case 
of 
white 
and 
black: 
for 
‘colour’ 
is 
the 
genus 
both 
of 
these 
and 
of 
all 
the 
intermediate 
colours 
as 
well. 
An 
objection 
may 
be 
raised 
that 
‘defect’ 
and 
‘excess’ 
are 
found 
in 
the 
same 
genus 
(for 
both 
are 
in 
the 
genus 
‘evil’), 
whereas 
moderate 
amount’, 
the 
intermediate 
between 
them, 
is 
found 
not 
in 
‘evil’ 
but 
in 
‘good’. 
Look 
and 
see 
also 
whether, 
while 
the 
genus 
has 
a 
contrary, 
the 
species 
has 
none; 
for 
if 
the 
genus 
be 
contrary 
to 
anything, 
so 
too 
is 
the 
species, 
as 
virtue 
to 
vice 
and 
justice 
to 
injustice. 


Likewise. 
also, 
if 
one 
were 
to 
look 
at 
other 
instances, 
one 
would 
come 
to 
see 
clearly 
a 
fact 
like 
this. 
An 
objection 
may 
be 
raised 
in 
the 
case 
of 
health 
and 
disease: 
for 
health 
in 
general 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
disease, 
whereas 
a 
particular 
disease, 
being 
a 
species 
of 
disease, 
e.g. 
fever 
and 
ophthalmia 
and 
any 
other 
particular 
disease, 
has 
no 
contrary. 



If, 
therefore, 
you 
are 
demolishing 
a 
view, 
there 
are 
all 
these 
ways 
in 
which 
you 
should 
make 
your 
examination: 
for 
if 
the 
aforesaid 
characters 
do 
not 
belong 
to 
it, 
clearly 
what 
has 
been 
rendered 
is 
not 
the 
genus. 
If, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
you 
are 
establishing 
a 
view, 
there 
are 
three 
ways: 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
see 
whether 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
species 
be 
found 
in 
the 
genus 
stated, 
suppose 
the 
genus 
have 
no 
contrary: 
for 
if 
the 
contrary 
be 
found 
in 
it, 
clearly 
the 
species 
in 
question 
is 
found 
in 
it 
as 
well. 
Moreover, 
see 
if 
the 
intermediate 
species 
is 
found 
in 
the 
genus 
stated: 
for 
whatever 
genus 
contains 
the 
intermediate 
contains 
the 
extremes 
as 
well. 
Again, 
if 
the 
genus 
have 
a 
contrary, 
look 
and 
see 
whether 
also 
the 
contrary 
species 
is 
found 
in 
the 
contrary 
genus: 
for 
if 
so, 
clearly 
also 
the 
species 
in 
question 
is 
found 
in 
the 
genus 
in 
question. 


Again, 
consider 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
inflexions 
and 
the 
co-ordinates 
of 
species 
and 
genus, 
and 
see 
whether 
they 
follow 
likewise, 
both 
in 
demolishing 
and 
in 
establishing 
a 
view. 
For 
whatever 
attribute 
belongs 
or 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
one 
belongs 
or 
does 
not 
belong 
at 
the 
same 
time 
to 
all; 
e.g. 
if 
justice 
be 
a 
particular 
form 
of 
knowledge, 
then 
also 
‘justly’ 
is 
‘knowingly’ 
and 
the 
just 
man 
is 
a 
man 
of 
knowledge: 
whereas 
if 
any 
of 
these 
things 
be 
not 
so, 
then 
neither 
is 
any 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
them. 
< 


div 
id="section39" 
class="section" 
title="4"> 


Again, 
consider 
the 
case 
of 
things 
that 
bear 
a 
like 
relation 
to 
one 
another. 
Thus 
(e.g.) 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
pleasant 
to 
pleasure 
is 
like 
that 
of 
the 
useful 
to 
the 
good: 
for 
in 
each 
case 
the 
one 
produces 
the 
other. 
If 
therefore 
pleasure 
be 
a 
kind 
of 
‘good’, 
then 
also 
the 
pleasant 
will 
be 
a 
kind 
of 
‘useful’: 
for 
clearly 
it 
may 
be 
taken 
to 
be 
productive 
of 
good, 
seeing 
that 
pleasure 
is 
good. 
In 
the 
same 
way 
also 
consider 
the 
case 
of 
processes 
of 
generation 
and 
destruction; 
if 
(e.g.) 
to 
build 
be 
to 
be 
active, 
then 
to 
have 
built 
is 
to 
have 
been 
active, 
and 
if 
to 
learn 
be 
to 
recollect, 
then 
also 
to 
have 
learnt 
is 
to 
have 
recollected, 
and 
if 
to 
be 
decomposed 
be 
to 
be 
destroyed, 
then 
to 
have 
been 
decomposed 
is 
to 
have 
been 
destroyed, 
and 
decomposition 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
destruction. 
Consider 
also 
in 
the 
same 
way 
the 
case 
of 
things 
that 
generate 
or 
destroy, 
and 
of 
the 
capacities 
and 
uses 
of 
things; 
and 
in 
general, 
both 
in 
demolishing 
and 
in 
establishing 
an 
argument, 
you 
should 
examine 
things 
in 
the 
light 
of 
any 
resemblance 
of 
whatever 
description, 
as 
we 
were 
saying 
in 
the 
case 
of 



generation 
and 
destruction. 
For 
if 
what 
tends 
to 
destroy 
tends 
to 
decompose, 
then 
also 
to 
be 
destroyed 
is 
to 
be 
decomposed: 
and 
if 
what 
tends 
to 
generate 
tends 
to 
produce, 
then 
to 
be 
generated 
is 
to 
be 
produced, 
and 
generation 
is 
production. 
Likewise, 
also, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
capacities 
and 
uses 
of 
things: 
for 
if 
a 
capacity 
be 
a 
disposition, 
then 
also 
to 
be 
capable 
of 
something 
is 
to 
be 
disposed 
to 
it, 
and 
if 
the 
use 
of 
anything 
be 
an 
activity, 
then 
to 
use 
it 
is 
to 
be 
active, 
and 
to 
have 
used 
it 
is 
to 
have 
been 
active. 


If 
the 
opposite 
of 
the 
species 
be 
a 
privation, 
there 
are 
two 
ways 
of 
demolishing 
an 
argument, 
first 
of 
all 
by 
looking 
to 
see 
if 
the 
opposite 
be 
found 
in 
the 
genus 
rendered: 
for 
either 
the 
privation 
is 
to 
be 
found 
absolutely 
nowhere 
in 
the 
same 
genus, 
or 
at 
least 
not 
in 
the 
same 
ultimate 
genus: 
e.g. 
if 
the 
ultimate 
genus 
containing 
sight 
be 
sensation, 
then 
blindness 
will 
not 
be 
a 
sensation. 
Secondly, 
if 
there 
be 
a 
sensation. 
Secondly, 
if 
there 
be 
a 
privation 
opposed 
to 
both 
genus 
and 
species, 
but 
the 
opposite 
of 
the 
species 
be 
not 
found 
in 
the 
opposite 
of 
the 
genus, 
then 
neither 
could 
the 
species 
rendered 
be 
in 
the 
genus 
rendered. 
If, 
then, 
you 
are 
demolishing 
a 
view, 
you 
should 
follow 
the 
rule 
as 
stated; 
but 
if 
establishing 
one 
there 
is 
but 
one 
way: 
for 
if 
the 
opposite 
species 
be 
found 
in 
the 
opposite 
genus, 
then 
also 
the 
species 
in 
question 
would 
be 
found 
in 
the 
genus 
in 
question: 
e.g. 
if 
‘blindness’ 
be 
a 
form 
of 
‘insensibility’, 
then 
‘sight’ 
is 
a 
form 
of 
‘sensation’. 


Again, 
look 
at 
the 
negations 
of 
the 
genus 
and 
species 
and 
convert 
the 
order 
of 
terms, 
according 
to 
the 
method 
described 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Accident: 
e.g. 
if 
the 
pleasant 
be 
a 
kind 
of 
good, 
what 
is 
not 
good 
is 
not 
pleasant. 
For 
were 
this 
no 
something 
not 
good 
as 
well 
would 
then 
be 
pleasant. 
That, 
however, 
cannot 
be, 
for 
it 
is 
impossible, 
if 
‘good’ 
be 
the 
genus 
of 
pleasant, 
that 
anything 
not 
good 
should 
be 
pleasant: 
for 
of 
things 
of 
which 
the 
genus 
is 
not 
predicated, 
none 
of 
the 
species 
is 
predicated 
either. 
Also, 
in 
establishing 
a 
view, 
you 
should 
adopt 
the 
same 
method 
of 
examination: 
for 
if 
what 
is 
not 
good 
be 
not 
pleasant, 
then 
what 
is 
pleasant 
is 
good, 
so 
that 
‘good’ 
is 
the 
genus 
of 
‘pleasant’. 


If 
the 
species 
be 
a 
relative 
term, 
see 
whether 
the 
genus 
be 
a 
relative 
term 
as 
well: 
for 
if 
the 
species 
be 
a 
relative 
term, 
so 
too 
is 
the 
genus, 
as 
is 
the 
case 
with 
‘double’ 
and 
‘multiple’: 
for 
each 
is 
a 
relative 
term. 
If, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
genus 
be 
a 
relative 
term, 
there 
is 
no 
necessity 
that 
the 
species 
should 
be 
so 
as 
well: 
for 
‘knowledge’is 
a 
relative 
term, 
but 
not 
so 
‘grammar’. 
Or 
possibly 
not 
even 
the 
first 
statement 
would 
be 
generally 
considered 
true: 
for 
virtue 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
‘noble’ 
and 
a 
kind 
of 
‘good’ 
thing, 
and 
yet, 
while 
‘virtue’ 



is 
a 
relative 
term, 
‘good’ 
and 
‘noble’ 
are 
not 
relatives 
but 
qualities. 
Again, 
see 
whether 
the 
species 
fails 
to 
be 
used 
in 
the 
same 
relation 
when 
called 
by 
its 
own 
name, 
and 
when 
called 
by 
the 
name 
of 
its 
genus: 
e.g. 
if 
the 
term 
‘double’ 
be 
used 
to 
mean 
the 
double 
of 
a 
‘half’, 
then 
also 
the 
term 
‘multiple’ 
ought 
to 
be 
used 
to 
mean 
multiple 
of 
a 
‘half’. 
Otherwise 
‘multiple’ 
could 
not 
be 
the 
genus 
of 
‘double’. 


Moreover, 
see 
whether 
the 
term 
fail 
to 
be 
used 
in 
the 
same 
relation 
both 
when 
called 
by 
the 
name 
of 
its 
genus, 
and 
also 
when 
called 
by 
those 
of 
all 
the 
genera 
of 
its 
genus. 
For 
if 
the 
double 
be 
a 
multiple 
of 
a 
half, 
then 
‘in 
excess 
of 
‘will 
also 
be 
used 
in 
relation 
to 
a 
‘half’: 
and, 
in 
general, 
the 
double 
will 
be 
called 
by 
the 
names 
of 
all 
the 
higher 
genera 
in 
relation 
to 
a 
‘half’. 
An 
objection 
may 
be 
raised 
that 
there 
is 
no 
necessity 
for 
a 
term 
to 
be 
used 
in 
the 
same 
relation 
when 
called 
by 
its 
own 
name 
and 
when 
called 
by 
that 
of 
its 
genus: 
for 
‘knowledge’ 
is 
called 
knowledge 
‘of 
an 
object’, 
whereas 
it 
is 
called 
a 
‘state’ 
and 
‘disposition’ 
not 
of 
an 
‘object’ 
but 
of 
the 
‘soul’. 


Again, 
see 
whether 
the 
genus 
and 
the 
species 
be 
used 
in 
the 
same 
way 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
inflexions 
they 
take, 
e.g. 
datives 
and 
genitives 
and 
all 
the 
rest. 
For 
as 
the 
species 
is 
used, 
so 
should 
the 
genus 
be 
as 
well, 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
‘double’ 
and 
its 
higher 
genera: 
for 
we 
say 
both 
‘double 
of’ 
and 
‘multiple 
of’ 
a 
thing. 
Likewise, 
also, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
‘knowledge’: 
for 
both 
knowledge’ 
itself 
and 
its 
genera, 
e.g. 
‘disposition’ 
and 
‘state’, 
are 
said 
to 
be 
‘of’ 
something. 
An 
objection 
may 
be 
raised 
that 
in 
some 
cases 
it 
is 
not 
so: 
for 
we 
say 
‘superior 
to’ 
and 
‘contrary 
to’ 
so 
and 
so, 
whereas 
‘other’, 
which 
is 
the 
genus 
of 
these 
terms, 
demands 
not 
‘to’ 
but 
‘than’: 
for 
the 
expression 
is 
‘other 
than’ 
so 
and 
so. 


Again, 
see 
whether 
terms 
used 
in 
like 
case 
relationships 
fail 
to 
yield 
a 
like 
construction 
when 
converted, 
as 
do 
‘double’ 
and 
‘multiple’. 
For 
each 
of 
these 
terms 
takes 
a 
genitive 
both 
in 
itself 
and 
in 
its 
converted 
form: 
for 
we 
say 
both 
a 
half 
of’ 
and 
‘a 
fraction 
of’ 
something. 
The 
case 
is 
the 
same 
also 
as 
regards 
both 
‘knowledge’ 
and 
‘conception’: 
for 
these 
take 
a 
genitive, 
and 
by 
conversion 
an 
‘object 
of 
knowledge’ 
and 
an 
‘object 
of 
conception’ 
are 
both 
alike 
used 
with 
a 
dative. 
If, 
then, 
in 
any 
cases 
the 
constructions 
after 
conversion 
be 
not 
alike, 
clearly 
the 
one 
term 
is 
not 
the 
genus 
of 
the 
other. 


Again, 
see 
whether 
the 
species 
and 
the 
genus 
fail 
to 
be 
used 
in 
relation 
to 
an 
equal 
number 
of 
things: 
for 
the 
general 
view 
is 
that 
the 
uses 
of 
both 
are 
alike 
and 
equal 
in 
number, 
as 
is 
the 
case 
with 
‘present’ 
and 
‘grant’. 
For 
a 
present’ 
is 
of 
something 
or 
to 
some 
one, 
and 
also 
a 
‘grant’ 
is 
of 
something 



and 
to 
some 
one: 
and 
‘grant’ 
is 
the 
genus 
of 
‘present’, 
for 
a 
‘present’ 
is 
a 
‘grant 
that 
need 
not 
be 
returned’. 
In 
some 
cases, 
however, 
the 
number 
of 
relations 
in 
which 
the 
terms 
are 
used 
happens 
not 
to 
be 
equal, 
for 
while 
‘double’ 
is 
double 
of 
something, 
we 
speak 
of 
‘in 
excess’ 
or 
‘greater’ 
in 
something, 
as 
well 
as 
of 
or 
than 
something: 
for 
what 
is 
in 
excess 
or 
greater 
is 
always 
in 
excess 
in 
something, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
excess 
of 
something. 
Hence 
the 
terms 
in 
question 
are 
not 
the 
genera 
of 
‘double’, 
inasmuch 
as 
they 
are 
not 
used 
in 
relation 
to 
an 
equal 
number 
of 
things 
with 
the 
species. 
Or 
possibly 
it 
is 
not 
universally 
true 
that 
species 
and 
genus 
are 
used 
in 
relation 
to 
an 
equal 
number 
of 
things. 


See, 
also, 
if 
the 
opposite 
of 
the 
species 
have 
the 
opposite 
of 
the 
genus 
as 
its 
genus, 
e.g. 
whether, 
if 
‘multiple’ 
be 
the 
genus 
of 
‘double’, 
‘fraction’ 
be 
also 
the 
genus 
of 
‘half’. 
For 
the 
opposite 
of 
the 
genus 
should 
always 
be 
the 
genus 
of 
the 
opposite 
species. 
If, 
then, 
any 
one 
were 
to 
assert 
that 
knowledge 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
sensation, 
then 
also 
the 
object 
of 
knowledge 
will 
have 
to 
be 
a 
kind 
of 
object 
of 
sensation, 
whereas 
it 
is 
not: 
for 
an 
object 
of 
knowledge 
is 
not 
always 
an 
object 
of 
sensation: 
for 
objects 
of 
knowledge 
include 
some 
of 
the 
objects 
of 
intuition 
as 
well. 
Hence 
‘object 
of 
sensation’ 
is 
not 
the 
genus 
of 
‘object 
of 
knowledge’: 
and 
if 
this 
be 
so, 
neither 
is 
‘sensation’ 
the 
genus 
of 
‘knowledge’. 


Seeing 
that 
of 
relative 
terms 
some 
are 
of 
necessity 
found 
in, 
or 
used 
of, 
the 
things 
in 
relation 
to 
which 
they 
happen 
at 
any 
time 
to 
be 
used 
(e.g. 
‘disposition’ 
and 
‘state’ 
and 
‘balance’; 
for 
in 
nothing 
else 
can 
the 
aforesaid 
terms 
possibly 
be 
found 
except 
in 
the 
things 
in 
relation 
to 
which 
they 
are 
used), 
while 
others 
need 
not 
be 
found 
in 
the 
things 
in 
relation 
to 
which 
they 
are 
used 
at 
any 
time, 
though 
they 
still 
may 
be 
(e.g. 
if 
the 
term 
‘object 
of 
knowledge’ 
be 
applied 
to 
the 
soul: 
for 
it 
is 
quite 
possible 
that 
the 
knowledge 
of 
itself 
should 
be 
possessed 
by 
the 
soul 
itself, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
necessary, 
for 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
this 
same 
knowledge 
to 
be 
found 
in 
some 
one 
else), 
while 
for 
others, 
again, 
it 
is 
absolutely 
impossible 
that 
they 
should 
be 
found 
in 
the 
things 
in 
relation 
to 
which 
they 
happen 
at 
any 
time 
to 
be 
used 
(as 
e.g. 
that 
the 
contrary 
should 
be 
found 
in 
the 
contrary 
or 
knowledge 
in 
the 
object 
of 
knowledge, 
unless 
the 
object 
of 
knowledge 
happen 
to 
be 
a 
soul 
or 
a 
man)-you 
should 
look, 
therefore, 
and 
see 
whether 
he 
places 
a 
term 
of 
one 
kind 
inside 
a 
genus 
that 
is 
not 
of 
that 
kind, 
e.g. 
suppose 
he 
has 
said 
that 
‘memory’ 
is 
the 
‘abiding 
of 
knowledge’. 
For 
‘abiding’ 
is 
always 
found 
in 
that 
which 
abides, 
and 
is 
used 
of 
that, 
so 
that 
the 
abiding 
of 
knowledge 
also 
will 
be 
found 
in 



knowledge. 
Memory, 
then, 
is 
found 
in 
knowledge, 
seeing 
that 
it 
is 
the 
abiding 
of 
knowledge. 
But 
this 
is 
impossible, 
for 
memory 
is 
always 
found 
in 
the 
soul. 
The 
aforesaid 
commonplace 
rule 
is 
common 
to 
the 
subject 
of 
Accident 
as 
well: 
for 
it 
is 
all 
the 
same 
to 
say 
that 
‘abiding’ 
is 
the 
genus 
of 
memory, 
or 
to 
allege 
that 
it 
is 
an 
accident 
of 
it. 
For 
if 
in 
any 
way 
whatever 
memory 
be 
the 
abiding 
of 
knowledge, 
the 
same 
argument 
in 
regard 
to 
it 
will 
apply. 
<

Again, 
see 
if 
he 
has 
placed 
what 
is 
a 
‘state’ 
inside 
the 
genus 
‘activity’, 
or 
an 
activity 
inside 
the 
genus 
‘state’, 
e.g. 
by 
defining 
‘sensation’ 
as 
‘movement 
communicated 
through 
the 
body’: 
for 
sensation 
is 
a 
‘state’, 
whereas 
movement 
is 
an 
‘activity’. 
Likewise, 
also, 
if 
he 
has 
said 
that 
memory 
is 
a 
‘state 
that 
is 
retentive 
of 
a 
conception’, 
for 
memory 
is 
never 
a 
state, 
but 
rather 
an 
activity. 


They 
also 
make 
a 
bad 
mistake 
who 
rank 
a 
‘state’ 
within 
the 
‘capacity’ 
that 
attends 
it, 
e.g. 
by 
defining 
‘good 
temper’ 
as 
the 
‘control 
of 
anger’, 
and 
‘courage’ 
and 
‘justice’ 
as 
‘control 
of 
fears’ 
and 
of 
‘gains’: 
for 
the 
terms 
‘courageous’ 
and 
‘good-tempered’ 
are 
applied 
to 
a 
man 
who 
is 
immune 
from 
passion, 
whereas 
‘self-controlled’ 
describes 
the 
man 
who 
is 
exposed 
to 
passion 
and 
not 
led 
by 
it. 
Quite 
possibly, 
indeed, 
each 
of 
the 
former 
is 
attended 
by 
a 
capacity 
such 
that, 
if 
he 
were 
exposed 
to 
passion, 
he 
would 
control 
it 
and 
not 
be 
led 
by 
it: 
but, 
for 
all 
that, 
this 
is 
not 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
being 
‘courageous’ 
in 
the 
one 
case, 
and 
‘good 
tempered’ 
in 
the 
other; 
what 
is 
meant 
is 
an 
absolute 
immunity 
from 
any 
passions 
of 
that 
kind 
at 
all. 


Sometimes, 
also, 
people 
state 
any 
kind 
of 
attendant 
feature 
as 
the 
genus, 


e.g. 
‘pain’ 
as 
the 
genus 
of 
‘anger’ 
and 
‘conception’ 
as 
that 
of 
conviction’. 
For 
both 
of 
the 
things 
in 
question 
follow 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
upon 
the 
given 
species, 
but 
neither 
of 
them 
is 
genus 
to 
it. 
For 
when 
the 
angry 
man 
feels 
pain, 
the 
pain 
bas 
appeared 
in 
him 
earlier 
than 
the 
anger: 
for 
his 
anger 
is 
not 
the 
cause 
of 
his 
pain, 
but 
his 
pain 
of 
his 
anger, 
so 
that 
anger 
emphatically 
is 
not 
pain. 
By 
the 
same 
reasoning, 
neither 
is 
conviction 
conception: 
for 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
have 
the 
same 
conception 
even 
without 
being 
convinced 
of 
it, 
whereas 
this 
is 
impossible 
if 
conviction 
be 
a 
species 
of 
conception: 
for 
it 
is 

impossible 
for 
a 
thing 
still 
to 
remain 
the 
same 
if 
it 
be 
entirely 
transferred 
out 
of 
its 
species, 
just 
as 
neither 
could 
the 
same 
animal 
at 
one 
time 
be, 
and 
at 
another 
not 
be, 
a 
man. 
If, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
any 
one 
says 
that 
a 
man 
who 
has 
a 
conception 
must 
of 
necessity 
be 
also 
convinced 
of 
it, 
then 
‘conception’ 
and 
‘conviction’ 
will 
be 
used 
with 
an 
equal 
denotation, 
so 
that 
not 
even 
so 
could 
the 
former 
be 
the 
genus 
of 
the 
latter: 
for 
the 
denotation 
of 
the 
genus 
should 
be 
wider. 


See, 
also, 
whether 
both 
naturally 
come 
to 
be 
anywhere 
in 
the 
same 
thing: 
for 
what 
contains 
the 
species 
contains 
the 
genus 
as 
well: 
e.g. 
what 
contains 
‘white’ 
contains 
‘colour’ 
as 
well, 
and 
what 
contains 
‘knowledge 
of 
grammar’ 
contains 
‘knowledge’ 
as 
well. 
If, 
therefore, 
any 
one 
says 
that 
‘shame’ 
is 
‘fear’, 
or 
that 
‘anger’ 
is 
‘pain’, 
the 
result 
will 
be 
that 
genus 
and 
species 
are 
not 
found 
in 
the 
same 
thing: 
for 
shame 
is 
found 
in 
the 
‘reasoning’ 
faculty, 
whereas 
fear 
is 
in 
the 
‘spirited’ 
faculty, 
and 
‘pain’ 
is 
found 
in 
the 
faculty 
of 
‘desires’. 
(for 
in 
this 
pleasure 
also 
is 
found), 
whereas 
‘anger’ 
is 
found 
in 
the 
‘spirited’ 
faculty. 
Hence 
the 
terms 
rendered 
are 
not 
the 
genera, 
seeing 
that 
they 
do 
not 
naturally 
come 
to 
be 
in 
the 
same 
faculty 
as 
the 
species. 
Likewise, 
also, 
if 
‘friendship’ 
be 
found 
in 
the 
faculty 
of 
desires, 
you 
may 
take 
it 
that 
it 
is 
not 
a 
form 
of 
‘wishing’: 
for 
wishing 
is 
always 
found 
in 
the 
‘reasoning’ 
faculty. 
This 
commonplace 
rule 
is 
useful 
also 
in 
dealing 
with 
Accident: 
for 
the 
accident 
and 
that 
of 
which 
it 
is 
an 
accident 
are 
both 
found 
in 
the 
same 
thing, 
so 
that 
if 
they 
do 
not 
appear 
in 
the 
same 
thing, 
clearly 
it 
is 
not 
an 
accident. 


Again, 
see 
if 
the 
species 
partakes 
of 
the 
genus 
attributed 
only 
in 
some 
particular 
respect: 
for 
it 
is 
the 
general 
view 
that 
the 
genus 
is 
not 
thus 
imparted 
only 
in 
some 
particular 
respect: 
for 
a 
man 
is 
not 
an 
animal 
in 
a 
particular 
respect, 
nor 
is 
grammar 
knowledge 
in 
a 
particular 
respect 
only. 
Likewise 
also 
in 
other 
instances. 
Look, 
therefore, 
and 
see 
if 
in 
the 
case 
of 
any 
of 
its 
species 
the 
genus 
be 
imparted 
only 
in 
a 
certain 
respect; 
e.g. 
if 
‘animal’ 
has 
been 
described 
as 
an 
‘object 
of 
perception’ 
or 
of 
‘sight’. 
For 
an 
animal 
is 
an 
object 
of 
perception 
or 
of 
sight 
in 
a 
particular 
respect 
only; 
for 
it 
is 
in 
respect 
of 
its 
body 
that 
it 
is 
perceived 
and 
seen, 
not 
in 
respect 
of 
its 
soul, 
so 
that-’object 
of 
sight’ 
and 
‘object 
of 
perception’ 
could 
not 
be 
the 
genus 
of 
‘animal’. 


Sometimes 
also 
people 
place 
the 
whole 
inside 
the 
part 
without 
detection, 
defining 
(e.g.) 
‘animal’ 
as 
an 
‘animate 
body’; 
whereas 
the 
part 
is 
not 
predicated 
in 
any 
sense 
of 
the 
whole, 
so 
that 
‘body’ 
could 
not 
be 
the 
genus 
of 
animal, 
seeing 
that 
it 
is 
a 
part. 



See 
also 
if 
he 
has 
put 
anything 
that 
is 
blameworthy 
or 
objectionable 
into 
the 
class 
‘capacity’ 
or 
‘capable’, 
e.g. 
by 
defining 
a 
‘sophist’ 
or 
a 
‘slanderer’, 
or
