EDITOR’S 
INTRODUCTION 


THIS 
volume 
brings 
together 
two 
of 
the 
most 
important 
items 
in 
the 
large 
literature 
concerned 
with 
criticizing 
and 
evaluating 
the 
economic 
doctrines 
of 
Karl 
Marx. 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
contribution, 
in 
its 
English 
translation, 
has 
been 
out 
of 
print 
and 
very 
difficult 
to 
obtain 
for 
many 
years. 
Hilferding’s 
answer 
to 
Böhm-Bawerk 
was 
brought 
out 
in 
translation 
by 
an 
obscure 
socialist 
publisher 
in 
Glasgow 
and 
never 
acquired 
wide 
circulation 
in 
either 
Britain 
or 
this 
country. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
recent 
growth 
of 
interest 
in 
Marxism, 
I 
believe 
the 
time 
has 
come 
to 
make 
these 
works 
available 
to 
a 
larger 
English-reading 
public; 
and 
I 
also 
believe 
that 
each 
gains 
in 
value 
through 
being 
presented 
side 
bysidewith 
theother. 


As 
an 
appendix 
there 
is 
included 
an 
article 
by 
the 
German 
statistician-
economist 
Bortkiewicz. 
This 
article, 
bearing 
on 
one 
of 
the 
central 
points 
at 
issue 
between 
Böhm-Bawerk 
and 
Hilferding, 
has 
achieved 
considerable 
fame; 
but 
hitherto 
it 
has 
not 
been 
translated 
into 
English, 
and 
I 
have 
seen 
no 



evidence 
that 
it 
has 
been 
read 
by 
more 
than 
a 
handful 
of 
specialists. 
I 
believe 
that 
serious 
students 
of 
Marxian 
economics, 
whether 
hostile 
or 
friendly, 
will 
beglad 
tohaveitmade 
readilyavailableforstudyand 
reference. 


In 
this 
introduction 
I 
shall 
discuss 
these 
three 
works 
in 
the 
hope 
of 
illuminating 
the 
point 
of 
view 
from 
which 
their 
authors 
wrote 
and 
of 
placing

BÖHM-BAWERK’S 
CRITICISM 
OFMARX 


BÖHM-BAWERK’S 
WORK 
was 
first 
published 
in 
1896, 
under 
the 
title 
Zum 
Abschluss 
des 
Marxschen 
Systems, 
in 
a 
volume 
of 
essays 
in 
honor 
of 
Karl 
Knies.1 
It 
appeared 
in 
Russian 
the 
following 
year 
and 
in 
English 
(in 
both 
Londonand 
NewYork) 
in1898. 


The 
original 
English 
title 
is 
retained 
here 
because 
it 
is 
by 
this 
title 
that 
the 
work 
is 
now 
widely 
known. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
point 
out 
that 
this 
title 
is 
not 
strictly 
accurate 
and 
has 
given 
rise 
to 
misunderstandings. 
“Karl 
Marx 
and 
the 
Close 
of 
His 
System” 
sounds 
like 
an 
obituary 
for 
Marx 
and 
his 
theories;2 
but, 
though 
the 
spirit 
of 
an 
obituary 
is 
not 
lacking 
from 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
writing, 
it 
would 
be 
mistaken 
to 
assume 
that 
this 
is 
what 
he 
intended 
to 
convey 
by 
the 
title. 
The 
third 
and 
final 
volume 
of 
Capital 
was 
published 
by 
Engels 
in 
1894, 
and 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
work 
was 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
an 
extended 
review. 
The 
German 
title 
means 
simply 
“On 
the 
Conclusion 
of 
the 
Marxian 
System,” 
and 
this 
describes 
the 
work 
as 
accurately 
as 
a 
brief 
title 
can. 


It 
was 
quite 
natural, 
one 
might 
almost 
say 
inevitable, 
that 
Böhm-Bawerk 
should 
write 
this 
book. 
In 
his 
well-known 
history 
of 
theories 
of 
capital 
and 
interest,3 
he 
had 
devoted 
a 
whole 
chapter 
to 
criticism 
of 
the 
theories 
of 
value 
and 
surplus 
value 
expounded 
in 
the 
first 
volume, 
of 
Capital. 
There 
he 
had 
noted 
that 
Marx 
was 
aware 
that 
commodities 
do 
not 
in 
fact 
sell 
at 
their 
values 
under 
developed 
capitalist 
conditions. 
He 
also 
noted 
that 
Marx 
promised 
to 
solve 
this 
problem 
in 
a 
later 
volume, 
a 
promise 
which 
Böhm-Bawerk 
was 
convinced 
Marx 
could 
not 
keep.1 
Hence, 
when 
the 
third 
volume 
finally 
appeared 
with 
Marx’s 
detailed 
treatment 
of 
this 
question, 
Böhm-Bawerk 
doubtless 
felt 
duty 
bound 
to 
examine 
it 
with 
all 
possible 
care 
and 
to 
pronouncehisverdict. 


In 
Karl 
Marx 
and 
the 
Close 
of 
His 
System, 
Böhm-Bawerk 
took 
over 
the 



main 
arguments 
of 
his 
chapter 
on 
Marx 
from 
the 
first 
edition 
of 
Capital 
and 
Interest; 
andin 
subsequenteditionsofthelatterheincorporatedthesubstance 
of 
the 
criticism 
of 
the 
third 
volume 
of 
Capital 
from 
Karl 
Marx 
and 
the 
Close 
of 
His 
System. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
latter 
is 
far 
more 
detailed 
and 
elaborate; 
not 
only 
does 
it 
stand 
on 
its 
own 
feet 
but 
it 
contains 
all 
that 
is 
important 
in 
Böhm-Bawerk’swritingsonMarxian 
economics. 


If 
we 
are 
to 
understand 
the 
significance 
of 
Karl 
Marx 
and 
the 
Close 
of 
His 
System 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
identify 
Böhm-Bawerk 
and 
to 
recognize 
his 
place 
in 
thedevelopment 
ofmoderneconomictheory. 


The 
relevant 
facts 
of 
his 
career 
can 
be 
briefly 
told. 
Eugen 
von 
Böhm-
Bawerk 
was 
born 
(1851) 
into 
one 
of 
the 
aristocratic-bureaucratic 
families 
which 
were 
the 
real 
rulers 
of 
Imperial 
Austria, 
his 
father 
being 
at 
the 
time 
a 
high 
officialin 
Moravia. 
Whenhe 
was 
stillvery 
young 
his 
father 
diedand 
the 
family 
moved 
to 
Vienna 
where, 
except 
for 
nine 
years 
of 
teaching 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Innsbruck 
(1880-1889), 
he 
spent 
most 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
his 
life. 
After 
taking 
a 
course 
of 
law 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Vienna 
he 
entered 
the 
Finance 
Ministry 
in 
1872. 
In 
1875 
he 
took 
a 
three-year 
leave 
of 
absence 
to 
study 
economics 
with 
some 
of 
the 
outstanding 
German 
professors 
of 
the 
day. 
From 
this 
time 
on, 
his 
career 
was 
a 
mixture 
of 
government 
service 
and 
university 
teaching. 
He 
served 
as 
Finance 
Minister 
in 
three 
different 
cabinets 
(1895, 
1897-1898, 
1900-1904). 
From 
1904 
until 
his 
death 
in 
1914 
he 
held 
a 
chairinpoliticaleconomyat 
the 
Universityof 
Vienna. 


As 
an 
economist, 
Böhm-Bawerk 
was 
from 
the 
first 
a 
champion 
of 
the 
new 
subjective 
value 
or 
marginal 
utility 
theory 
which 
his 
somewhat 
older 
contemporary, 
Carl 
Menger, 
had 
been 
the 
first 
to 
enunciate 
in 
Austria. 
Böhm-
Bawerk, 
along 
with 
Menger 
and 
Friedrich 
Wieser 
(whose 
sister 
he 
married 
in 
1880), 
was 
thus 
one 
of 
the 
founders 
of 
the 
so-called 
Austrian 
school. 
His 
two 
major 
works, 
Capital 
and 
Interest 
and 
The 
Positive 
Theory 
of 
Capital, 
were 
published 
in 
1884 
and 
1889 
respectively, 
before 
he 
was 
forty 
years 
old; 
and 
as 
thesubjective 
valuetheoryspread 
geographically 
and 
gained 
in 
popularity, 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
fame 
grew 
by 
leaps 
and 
bounds. 
Outside 
of 
his 
own 
country 
he 
came 
to 
be 
much 
better 
known 
than 
Menger 
or 
Wieser, 
and 
by 
the 
turn 
of 
the 
century 
it 
is 
probable 
that 
his 
international 
reputation 
was 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
any 
other 
living 
economist, 
with 
the 
possible 
exception 
of 
Alfred 
Marshall. 
Only 
in 
Britain, 
where 
the 
authority 
of 
Marshall 
and 
Edgeworth 
(at 
Cambridge 
and 
Oxford 
respectively) 
was 
virtually 
unchallenged, 
did 
Böhm-
Bawerk 
fail 
to 
attract 
a 
substantial 
following; 
while 
in 
countries 
as 
widely 



separated 
as 
Sweden, 
the 
United 
States, 
and 
Japan 
his 
influence 
upon 
academiceconomics 
wasprofound. 


It 
is 
against 
this 
background 
that 
we 
must 
evaluate 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
critiqueof 
the 
theories 
of 
Marx. 
Organized 
socialism 
in 
Europe 
experienced 
a 
rapid 
growth 
in 
the 
last 
three 
decades 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century, 
and 
it 
was 
also 
during 
this 
period 
that 
within 
the 
continental 
socialist 
movement 
Marxismwonoutover 
rival 
schools 
and 
doctrines.1 
Hence, 
while 
the 
original 
reaction 
of 
the 
academic 
world 
had 
been 
to 
ignore 
Marx, 
it 
became 
increasingly 
difficult 
to 
maintain 
this 
attitude; 
as 
time 
went 
on 
it 
became 
moreand 
more 
urgentto 
organizeacounter-attack. 


The 
publication 
of 
the 
third 
volume 
of 
Capital 
offered 
the 
perfect 
opportunity, 
and 
Böhm-Bawerk 
was 
a 
“natural” 
to 
take 
the 
lead. 
He 
had 
already,in 
Capital 
and 
Interest, 
established 
himself 
as 
a 
formidable 
opponent 
of 
Marxism 
by 
his 
attacks 
on 
what 
he 
called 
the 
“exploitation 
theory” 
of 
interest; 
his 
international 
reputation 
insured 
that 
whatever 
he 
wrote 
would 
receive 
a 
wide 
and 
respectful 
hearing. 
It 
is 
therefore 
not 
surprising 
that 
when 
Karl 
Marx 
and 
the 
Close 
of 
His 
System 
was 
published 
in 
1896 
it 
was 
an 
immediate 
success 
and 
soon 
became 
what 
might 
almost 
be 
called 
the 
official 
answerof 
theeconomicsprofessiontoMarxandtheMarxianschool. 


It 
would 
not 
be 
fruitful 
to 
trace 
in 
detail 
the 
influence 
of 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
critique 
on 
orthodox 
economics, 
especially 
since 
a 
large 
part 
of 
that 
influence 
was 
never 
formally 
acknowledged 
and 
hence 
would 
be 
practically 
impossible 
to 
document. 
Franz 
X. 
Weiss, 
the 
editor 
of 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
collected 
papers, 
undoubtedly 
expressed 
the 
view 
of 
most 
continental 
academic 
economists 
when 
he 
wrote 
that 
Karl 
Marx 
and 
the 
Close 
of 
His 
System 
“is 
rightly 
regarded 
as 
the 
best 
criticism 
of 
the 
Marxian 
theories 
of 
value 
and 
surplus 
value.”2 


So 
far 
as 
the 
United 
States 
is 
concerned, 
all 
the 
serious 
criticisms 
of 
Marxian 
economics 
with 
which 
I 
am 
acquainted 
recognize 
the 
authority, 
if 
not 
the 
primacy, 
of 
Böhm-Bawerk 
in 
this 
field;1 
while 
the 
similarity 
of 
the 
anti-Marxian 
arguments 
in 
the 
average 
textbook 
to 
those 
of 
Böhm-Bawerk 
is 
toostrikingtobe 
easilyaccounteda 
coincidence. 


From 
the 
Marxian 
camp 
the 
testimony 
to 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
pre-eminence 
as 
an 
opponent 
is 
at 
least 
as 
striking. 
Louis 
B. 
Boudin, 
in 
the 
economic 
chapters 
of 
his 
important 
survey 
of 
the 
Marxian 
system 
and 
its 
critics, 
pays 
most 
attention 
to 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
arguments: 
“First 
because 
Böhm-Bawerk 
is 
so 
far 
superior 
to 
his 
comrades 
in 
arms 
and 
his 
authority 
is 
acknowledged 
by 



them 
to 
such 
an 
extent, 
that 
it 
can 
hardly 
be 
claimed 
to 
be 
unfair 
to 
these 
critics, 
to 
pick 
Böhm-Bawerk 
as 
an 
example 
of 
them 
all. 
Second, 
because 
there 
seems 
to 
be 
quite 
a 
good 
deal 
of 
unanimity 
among 
these 
critics 
on 
this 
particular 
point 
[value 
theory], 
and 
the 
arguments 
advanced 
by 
the 
others 
are 
either 
directly 
borrowed 
from 
Böhm-Bawerk, 
very 
often 
with 
an 
acknowledgment 
of 
receipt, 
or 
are 
variations 
on 
the 
same 
tune 
deserving 
no 
particular 
attention.”2 
The 
situation 
did 
not 
change 
greatly 
in 
this 
respect 
in 
the 
following 
decades. 
William 
Blake, 
writing 
in 
1939, 
could 
say: 
“Böhm-
Bawerk 
anticipated 
nearly 
all 
the 
attacks 
on 
Marxism 
from 
the 
viewpoint 
of 
those 
who 
hold 
political 
economy 
to 
center 
on 
a 
subjective 
theory 
of 
value. 
On 
the 
whole, 
little 
has 
been 
added 
to 
his 
case 
by 
other 
critics; 
their 
importantcontributions 
areoutside 
thetheorieshechoseto 
contest.”3 


It 
has 
been 
necessary 
to 
stress 
the 
historical 
importance 
of 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
criticism 
of 
Marx, 
but 
this 
should 
not 
lead 
us 
into 
the 
error 
of 
falsely 
evaluating 
the 
work 
itself. 
The 
truth 
is 
that 
in 
its 
essentials 
Karl 
Marx 
and 
the 
Close 
of 
His 
System 
is 
not 
a 
particularly 
remarkable 
performance. 
It 
is 
obviously 
the 
work 
of 
a 
skilled 
debater, 
but 
its 
intellectual 
content 
is 
largely 
confined 
to 
applications 
of 
the 
elementary 
principles 
of 
the 
marginal 
utility 
theory. 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
line 
of 
reasoning 
was 
thoroughly 
familiar 
in 
academic 
economic 
circles, 
and 
any 
number 
of 
his 
contemporaries 
could 
have 
produced 
a 
critique 
of 
Marx 
which 
would 
have 
differed 
from 
BöhmBawerk’s 
only 
in 
matters 
of 
emphasis 
and 
detail. 
The 
examples 
of 
Wicksteed1inEngland 
andPareto2 
in 
the 
Latin 
countries 
prove 
this, 
if 
indeed 
proof 
is 
required. 
We 
do 
not 
need 
to 
assume, 
therefore, 
that 
things 
would 
havebeenmuchdifferent 
if 
Karl 
Marx 
and 
the 
Close 
of 
His 
System 
had 
never 
been 
written. 
Some 
other 
economist 
would 
have 
come 
forward 
to 
do 
the 
job 
which 
Böhm-Bawerk 
did; 
or 
perhaps 
Pareto’s 
critique, 
since 
it 
bore 
the 
authoritative 
stamp 
of 
the 
Lausanne 
school, 
might 
have 
assumed 
the 
preeminent 
position 
that 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
actually 
occupied.1 
Marx 
had 
to 
be 
refuted, 
and 
history, 
in 
casting 
her 
eyes 
over 
the 
possible 
candidates, 
selected 
Böhm-Bawerk 
as 
best 
fitted 
for 
the 
assignment. 
But 
if 
he 
had 
refused 
or 
fallen 
down 
on 
the 
job, 
some 
one 
else 
would 
have 
been 
ready 
to 
take 
his 
place. 
Here 
is 
a 
case, 
I 
think, 
where 
we 
can 
clearly 
accept 
Engels’ 
dictum: 
“That 
such 
and 
such 
a 
man 
and 
precisely 
that 
man 
arises 
at 
that 
particular 
time 
in 
that 
given 
country 
is 
of 
course 
pure 
accident. 
But 
cut 
him 
out 
and 
there 
will 
be 
a 
demand 
for 
a 
substitute, 
and 
this 
substitute 
will 
be 
found, 
good 
orbad,butin 
the 
longrunhewill 
befound.”2 



It 
is 
not 
my 
purpose 
in 
this 
introduction 
to 
discuss 
the 
details 
of 
BöhmBawerk’scaseagainst 
Marx. 
Thereader 
canfollow 
these 
through 
for 
himself. 
But 
I 
think 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
say 
something 
about 
the 
attitude 
which 
Böhm-
Bawerk 
adopts 
toward 
Marx 
and 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
criticism 
which 
follows 
fromthisattitude. 


Böhm-Bawerk 
was 
writing 
at 
a 
time 
when 
subjective 
value 
theory 
had 
scored 
its 
greatest 
triumphs 
and 
was 
the 
accepted 
basis 
of 
serious 
academic 
economics. 
He, 
in 
common 
with 
its 
other 
exponents, 
was 
completely 
convinced 
that 
economics 
had 
at 
last 
attained 
to 
the 
coveted 
status 
of 
a 
genuine 
science; 
and 
he 
took 
it 
for 
granted 
as 
requiring 
no 
argument 
that 
the 
problems 
which 
he 
and 
his 
colleagues 
(both 
in 
Austria 
and 
abroad) 
were 
working 
on 
were 
the 
problems 
which 
the 
young 
science 
must 
attempt 
to 
solve. 
In 
keeping 
with 
this 
attitude, 
Böhm-Bawerk 
implicitly, 
and 
no 
doubt 
unconsciously, 
assumed 
that 
Marx 
had 
been 
engaged 
in 
the 
same 
enterprise 
and 
could 
legitimately 
be 
judged 
by 
the 
same 
standards 
as 
might 
be 
applied, 
forexample, 
toMarshall 
orJ. 
B. 
Clark. 


What 
were 
these 
problems 
which 
economics 
was 
trying 
to 
solve? 
They 
all 
centered 
around 
and 
were 
really 
dependent 
upon 
the 
problem 
of 
value, 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
exchange 
ratios 
established 
upon 
the 
market. 
(“Price” 
as 
the 
money 
expression 
of 
value 
was 
regarded 
as 
the 
proper 
subject 
of 
monetary 
as 
opposed 
to 
“pure” 
theory.) 
Indeed, 
all 
the 
phenomena 
of 
economics—such 
as 
wages, 
rent, 
interest, 
and 
profits—were 
in 
the 
last 
analysis 
special 
cases 
of 
the 
problem 
of 
value, 
derived 
from 
and 
regulated 
by 
the 
operations 
of 
commoditymarketsin 
amoreor 
lesscomplexfashion. 


Given 
this 
starting 
point, 
the 
subjective 
value 
theorist 
has 
hardly 
any 
choice 
when 
he 
undertakes 
to 
evaluate 
a 
systematic 
body 
of 
economic 
doctrine 
such 
as 
that 
of 
Marx. 
He 
must 
first 
test 
the 
value 
theory. 
Does 
it 
explain 
the 
phenomena 
of 
exchange 
ratios 
as 
they 
are 
found 
in 
typical, 
concrete 
market 
situations? 
If 
so, 
he 
can 
proceed 
to 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
theory. 
If 
not, 
then 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
theory 
must 
necessarily 
be 
wrong 
and 
there 
is 
no 
sense 
in 
wasting 
time 
on 
it. 
It 
is 
like 
a 
problem 
in 
arithmetic: 
if 
you 
find 
an 
error 
in 
the 
first 
line, 
you 
know 
that 
the 
answer 
must 
be 
wrong 
and 
that 
the 
subsequent 
calculations 
areworthless. 


It 
was 
entirely 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
this 
approach 
that 
Böhm-Bawerk 
carried 
out 
his 
examination 
of 
Marxian 
theory. 
After 
a 
brief 
introduction, 
he 
devotes 
two 
chapters 
to 
setting 
out 
Marx’s 
theories 
of 
value, 
surplus 
value, 
average 
rate 
of 
profit, 
and 
price 
of 
production—“for 
the 
sake 
of 
connection,” 



as 
he 
says.1 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
this 
exposition 
he 
concludes 
that 
Marx 
had 
not 
one 
but 
two 
theories 
of 
value 
(one 
in 
Volume 
I 
of 
Capital 
and 
another 
in 
Volume 
III) 
in 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
sense 
of 
the 
term, 
that 
is, 
market 
exchange 
ratios. 
Moreover, 
according 
to 
Böhm-Bawerk, 
these 
two 
theories 
lead 
to 
different 
results, 
not 
occasionally 
or 
exceptionally 
but 
regularly 
and 
as 
a 
matterof 
principle. 
Hence, 
Bôhm-Bawerk 
“cannot 
help 
himself”; 
he 
is 
forced 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
there 
is 
a 
contradiction 
between 
Volume 
I 
and 
Volume 
III 
of 
Capital. 
He 
next 
proceeds 
to 
analyze 
at 
length—more 
than 
a 
third 
of 
the 
whole 
critique 
is 
devoted 
to 
this—the 
arguments 
by 
which, 
according 
to 
Bôhm-Bawerk, 
Marx 
seeks 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
contradiction 
is 
only 
apparent 
and 
that 
the 
theory 
of 
Volume 
I 
is 
valid, 
after 
all. 
Having 
disposed 
of 
these 
arguments 
one 
by 
one, 
Bôhm-Bawerk 
is 
at 
last 
ready 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
matter, 
“the 
error 
in 
the 
Marxian 
system,” 
for 
it 
is 
by 
now 
clear 
that 
error 
there 
must 
be. 
Naturally, 
he 
finds 
that 
the 
error 
lies 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
Marx 
started 
from 
the 
old-fashioned 
and 
exploded 
labor 
theory 
of 
value 
instead 
of 
pushing 
his 
way 
through 
to 
the 
new 
and 
scientifically 
correct 
subjective 
theory 
of 
value. 
This 
error 
ramifies 
throughout 
the 
system 
and 
vitiates 
it 
from 
toptobottom. 


This, 
then, 
is 
the 
form 
and 
substance 
of 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
case 
against 
Marx. 
It 
is 
particularly 
important 
to 
recognize 
that 
it 
is 
not 
a 
personal 
attack 
on 
Marx.1 
Nor 
is 
it 
simply 
one 
theorist’s 
dissection 
of 
the 
work 
of 
another, 
though 
this 
is 
undoubtedly 
what 
Böhm-Bawerk 
was 
aiming 
at. 
It 
is 
rather 
a 
systematic 
exposition 
of 
why 
subjective 
value 
theory, 
the 
“new 
economics” 
of 
half 
a 
century 
ago, 
rejected 
the 
Marxian 
system 
root 
and 
branch. 
It 
is 
this 
fact, 
rather 
than 
any 
special 
brilliance 
or 
originality 
in 
the 
work 
itself, 
which 
constitutes 
the 
importanceofBöhm-Bawerk’scritique. 


HILFERDING’S 
REPLYTOBOHM-BAWERK 


Das 
Finanzkapital 
by 
Rudolf 
Hilferding 
is 
certainly 
one 
of 
the 
best-known 
works 
in 
the 
field 
of 
Marxian 
economics 
since 
Capital 
itself.1 
The 
author 
is 
less 
well-known 
than 
the 
book, 
however, 
and 
it 
may 
be 
interesting 
as 
well 
as 
useful 
for 
our 
present 
purpose 
to 
review 
Hilferding’s 
career 
before 
taking 
up 
his 
reply 
to 
Böhm-Bawerk, 
which 
was 
one 
of 
the 
earliest, 
if 
not 
actually 
the 
first, 
ofhispublishedwritings.2 


Hilferding 
was 
born 
in 
Vienna 
in 
1877 
of 
a. 
well-to-do 
Jewish 
mercantile 



family. 
He 
studied 
medicine 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Vienna, 
but 
even 
during 
his 
student 
days 
his 
interests 
seem 
to 
have 
run 
more 
to 
the 
social 
sciences. 
He 
soon 
became 
a 
socialist 
and 
organized, 
along 
with 
Otto 
Bauer 
(later 
leader 
of 
theAustrianSocialists)andothers, 
the 
firststudentsocialistsociety. 


Intellectually 
brilliant 
and 
personally 
attractive, 
Hilferding 
was 
not 
slow 
to 
gain 
the 
favorable 
attention 
of 
the 
leaders 
of 
the 
German-speaking 
socialist 
movement. 
In 
1902 
Kautsky 
invited 
him 
to 
become 
a 
regular 
contributor 
to 
Die 
Neue 
Zeit, 
the 
theoretical 
organ 
of 
the 
German 
Social 
Democratic 
Party. 
In 
1906 
he 
was 
asked 
by 
Bebel 
to 
go 
to 
Berlin 
to 
serve 
as 
an 
instructor 
in 
the 
party 
school 
there. 
He 
remained 
in 
this 
position 
about 
a 
year 
and 
then 
was 
chosen 
to 
be 
the 
foreign 
editor 
of 
Vorwärts, 
chief 
German 
Social 
Democratic 
newspaper. 
From 
this 
period 
on, 
he 
was 
prominent 
in 
the 
affairs 
of 
the 
German 
party, 
serving 
on 
its 
Central 
Committee 
and 
playing 
a 
leading 
part 
in 
itsReichstagdelegation. 


Meanwhile, 
in 
1904, 
Hilferding 
and 
Max 
Adler 
had 
published 
in 
Vienna 
the 
first 
volume 
in 
a 
series 
entitled 
Marx 
Studien 
which 
was 
to 
provide 
an 
outlet 
for 
the 
younger 
Viennese 
socialist 
intellectuals. 
This 
first 
volume 
contained 
three 
studies, 
the 
second 
and 
third 
being 
by 
Josef 
Karner3 
and 
Max 
Adler.4 
The 
first 
was 
Hilferding’s 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
Marx-Kritik 
which 
is 
reproduced 
in 
this 
volume 
in 
the 
English 
of 
the 
well-known 
translators 
Eden 
and 
CedarPaul.1 


Hilferding’s 
next 
and 
most 
substantial 
work, 
Das 
Finanzkapital, 
was 
likewise 
published 
as 
one 
of 
the 
Marx 
Studien 
series. 
It 
appeared 
in 
1910; 
but, 
as 
Hilferding 
tells 
us 
in 
a 
preface 
(dated 
Christmas, 
1909), 
it 
was 
finished 
in 
its 
main 
outlines 
“already 
four 
years 
ago”—that 
is 
to 
say 
as 
early 
as 
1905. 
Hailed 
by 
Otto 
Bauer 
as 
“the 
book 
for 
which 
we 
have 
long 
been 
waiting,” 
Das 
Finanzkapital 
won 
for 
its 
author 
the 
reputation 
of 
being 
the 
leading 
economist 
of 
the 
German-speaking 
socialist 
movement. 
Nor 
was 
recognition 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
Hilferding’s 
book 
confined 
to 
Germany 
and 
Austria. 
Lenin 
was 
much 
influenced 
by 
Das 
Finanzkapital; 
and 
on 
the 
first 
page 
of 
Imperialism, 
he 
refers 
to 
it 
in 
the 
following 
terms: 
“In 
spite 
of 
the 
author’s 
mistake 
regarding 
the 
theory 
of 
money, 
and 
in 
spite 
of 
a 
certain 
inclination 
to 
reconcile 
Marxism 
and 
opportunism, 
this 
work 
affords 
a 
very 
valuable 
theoretical 
analysis 
of 
‘the 
latest 
phaseofcapitalist 
development,’ 
as 
thesubtitleofHilferding’sbookreads.” 


Entirely 
thought 
out 
and 
largely 
written 
before 
he 
had 
reached 
the 
age 
of 
thirty, 
Das 
Finanzkapital 
was 
Hilferding’s 
last 
important 
contribution 
to 



socialist 
literature. 
He 
never 
wrote 
another 
book, 
and 
what 
he 
did 
produce 
during 
the 
last 
three 
decades 
of 
his 
life 
was 
mainly 
of 
a 
journalistic 
nature, 
possessing 
little 
lasting 
interest. 
When 
he 
undertook 
a 
more 
general 
theoretical 
analysis, 
as 
in 
his 
contribution 
to 
a 
two-volume 
symposium 
on 
capitalism 
in 
1931,1 
he 
simply 
repeated, 
with 
hardly 
any 
change, 
the 
ideas 
of 
Das 
Finanzkapital. 


When 
war 
broke 
out 
in 
1914, 
Hilferding’s 
strong 
pacifist 
and 
humanitarian 
leanings 
caused 
him 
to 
vote 
with 
the 
left 
wing 
of 
the 
German 
Social 
Democratic 
Party 
against 
war 
credits. 
The 
following 
year, 
however, 
he 
was 
drafted 
into 
the 
Austrian 
Army 
and 
spent 
most 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
war 
years 
as 
a 
doctor 
on 
the 
Italian 
front, 
a 
fact 
which 
precluded 
his 
playing 
an 
active 
political 
role 
between 
1914 
and 
the 
Revolution 
of 
1918. 
When 
he 
returned 
to 
Germany 
after 
the 
war 
he 
cast 
his 
lot 
with 
the 
Independent 
Social 
Democratic 
Party 
which 
had 
been 
formed 
in 
April, 
1917, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a 
split 
between 
the 
left 
and 
center 
socialists 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
and 
the 
right 
socialists 
on 
the 
other. 
Hilferding 
quickly 
rose 
to 
a 
position 
of 
leadership 
among 
the 
Independents, 
filling 
the 
important 
post 
of 
editor-in-chief 
of 
their 
newspaper 
Freiheit. 
He 
was 
never 
a 
real 
leftist, 
however, 
and 
when 
the 
issue 
of 
joining 
the 
new 
Communist 
International 
came 
up 
before 
the 
Halle 
Congress 
of 
the 
Independents 
(1920), 
he 
was 
one 
of 
the 
leaders 
of 
the 
minority 
which 
opposedthemove. 
TheIndependentsnowsplit,themajorityformingthebulk 
of 
the 
German 
Communist 
Party 
and 
the 
minority 
seeking 
to 
rejoin 
the 
Social 
Democratic 
Party. 
In 
1922, 
after 
negotiations 
in 
which 
Hilferding 
took 
a 
prominent 
part, 
what 
remained 
of 
the 
Independent 
Party 
returned 
to 
the 
parentorganization. 


During 
the 
last 
ten 
years 
of 
the 
Weimar 
Republic 
Hilferding 
found 
his 
spiritual 
home 
in 
the 
right 
wing 
of 
the 
Social 
Democratic 
Party. 
He 
was 
generally 
considered 
the 
Party’s 
leading 
thinker, 
edited 
its 
theoretical 
journal 
Die 
Gesellschaft, 
and 
twice 
held 
the 
post 
of 
Finance 
Minister 
in 
the 
Reich 
Government—once 
under 
Stresemann 
in 
1923 
and 
again 
under 
M 
tiller 
in 
1928-29. 
Looked 
at 
from 
any 
point 
of 
view, 
his 
record, 
like 
that 
of 
the 
Social 
Democratic 
Party 
itself, 
was 
one 
of 
unbroken 
failure. 
As 
Finance 
Minister 
he 
was 
equally 
ineffective 
in 
dealing 
with 
inflation 
in 
1923 
and 
with 
impending 
depression 
in 
1929. 
But 
far 
more 
important 
than 
these 
specific 
failures 
was 
his 
general 
misjudgment 
of 
the 
post-war 
situation 
and 
his 
gross 
underestimation 
of 
the 
Nazi 
danger. 
As 
late 
as 
January, 
1933, 
he 
wrote 
in 
Die 
Gesellschaft 
that 
the 
primary 
aim 
of 
the 
socialists 
was 
to 
fight 
the 



communists. 
Hilferding’s 
attitude 
in 
these 
tragic 
days 
is 
dramatically 
illustrated 
by 
the 
following 
account, 
written 
by 
an 
acquaintance 
who 
was 
in 
contactwithhimatthetime: 


I 
remember 
distinctly 
having 
spoken 
to 
him 
a 
few 
days 
after 
Hitler 
was 
appointed 
Chancellor 
and 
asking 
him 
whether 
he 
thought 
that 
the 
time 
was 
ripe 
for 
the 
unions 
to 
call 
a 
general 
strike. 
Even 
then, 
in 
the 
first 
days 
of 
February 
1933, 
he 
was 
sitting 
in 
a 
comfortable 
easy 
chair 
with 
warm 
felt 
slippers 
on 
his 
feet 
and 
remarked 
with 
a 
benign 
smile 
that 
I 
was 
a 
young 
firebrand 
and 
that 
political 
skill 
consists 
of 
waiting 
for 
the 
right 
moment. 
After 
all, 
he 
said, 
Hindenburg 
is 
still 
the 
President, 
the 
government 
is 
a 
coalition 
government, 
and 
while 
Hitlers 
come 
and 
go, 
the 
ADGB 
[the 
German 
trade 
union 
federation] 
is 
an 
organization 
that 
should 
not 
risk 
its 
entire 
existence 
for 
a 
fleeting 
political 
purpose. 
It 
was 
only 
a 
few 
days 
later 
that 
he 
was 
hiding 
at 
some 
friend’s 
house 
beingalreadysoughtby 
theGestapo.1 


Franz 
Neumann 
has 
justly 
remarked 
that 
“it 
was 
the 
tragedy 
of 
the 
Social 
Democratic 
Party 
and 
trade 
unions 
to 
have 
had 
as 
leaders 
men 
with 
high 
intellectual 
qualities 
but 
completely 
devoid 
of 
any 
feeling 
for 
the 
condition 
of 
themasses 
andwithout 
any 
insight 
into 
the 
great 
socialtransformations 
of 
the 
post-war 
period.”2 
To 
none 
of 
the 
leaders 
does 
this 
apply 
with 
greater 
force 
thantoHilferdinghimself. 


Hilferding 
escaped 
from 
the 
Gestapo 
in 
1933, 
but 
unfortunately 
not 
for 
good. 
He 
went 
via 
Denmark 
to 
Switzerland, 
where 
he 
stayed 
until 
1938, 
and 
then 
to 
Paris. 
When 
the 
Nazis 
took 
Paris 
he 
fled 
south 
and 
early 
in 
1941 
had 
completed 
arrangements 
to 
come 
to 
the 
United 
States. 
But 
just 
as 
he 
was 
about 
to 
board 
a 
boat 
at 
Marseilles 
he 
was 
picked 
up 
by 
the 
Vichy 
police 
and 
handed 
over 
to 
the 
Germans. 
The 
end 
came 
a 
few 
days 
later. 
One 
report 
says 
that 
he 
committed 
suicide 
in 
a 
prison 
cell, 
another 
that 
he 
was 
tortured 
to 
deathbytheGestapo. 


Looking 
at 
Hilferding’s 
career 
as 
a 
whole, 
we 
can 
see 
that 
its 
creative 
phase 
was 
relatively 
short, 
being 
bounded 
by 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
Criticism 
of 
Marx 
at 
one 
end 
and 
Das 
Finanzkapital 
at 
the 
other. 
He 
was 
a 
person 
with 
the 
greatest 
of 
natural 
gifts 
whose 
vision 
was 
clouded 
and 
whose 
energies 
were 
stultified 
by 
easy 
success. 
But 
the 
ultimate 
tragedy 
of 
Hilferding’s 
life 



—and 
surely 
the 
failure 
to 
fulfill 
great 
promise 
is 
always 
an 
individual 
as 
well 
as 
a 
social 
tragedy—must 
not 
be 
allowed 
to 
obscure 
the 
outstanding 
merit 
of 
the 
work 
which 
he 
did 
accomplish. 
His 
answer 
to 
Böhm-Bawerk 
and 
his 
study 
of 
finance 
capital 
will 
always 
remain 
among 
the 
classics 
of 
Marxian 
literature. 


The 
significance 
of 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
Criticism 
of 
Marx 
is 
twofold. 
On 
the 
one 
hand, 
it 
was 
the 
only 
full-scale 
reply 
to 
Böhm-Bawerk 
from 
the 
Marxian 
camp;1 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
it 
is 
probably 
the 
clearest 
statement 
we 
have 
of 
the 
fundamental 
difference 
in 
outlook 
between 
Marxian 
economics 
and 
modern 
orthodox 
economics. 
I 
shall 
not 
deal 
here 
with 
Hilferding’s 
refutations 
of 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
specific 
arguments, 
beyond 
pointing 
out 
that 
he 
gives 
a 
good 
account 
of 
himself 
and 
shows 
that 
even 
at 
the 
age 
of 
twentyfive2 
he 
could 
stand 
up 
and 
trade 
punches 
with 
so 
experienced 
and 
inveterate 
a 
polemicist 
as 
Böhm-Bawerk 
(it 
would 
hardly 
be 
unfair, 
I 
think, 
to 
describe 
Capital 
and 
Interest 
as 
one 
sustained 
polemic 
against 
all 
earlier 
theorists 
of 
capital 
and 
interest 
and 
also 
against 
all 
of 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
contemporaries 
who 
did 
not 
agree 
with 
him.) 
But 
I 
do 
want 
to 
call 
attention 
to 
what 
seems 
to 
me 
the 
most 
important 
contribution 
of 
Hilferding’s 
work, 
its 
recognition 
and 
explicit 
statement 
of 
what 
divides 
the 
Marxist 
from 
the 
marginal-utility 
theorist; 
and 
I 
want 
to 
emphasize 
that 
Hilferding, 
by 
making 
his 
whole 
analysis 
turn 
around 
this 
difference 
in 
outlook, 
was 
in 
fact 
illustrating 
the 
difference 
inaconcreteway. 


Hilferding’s 
work 
is 
divided 
into 
three 
parts: 
“Value 
as 
an 
Economic 
Category,” 
“Value 
and 
Average 
Profit,” 
and 
“The 
Subjective 
Outlook.” 
While 
the 
first 
two 
parts 
are 
necessary 
to 
a 
full 
understanding 
of 
the 
third, 
it 
is 
in 
this 
last 
that 
he 
states 
the 
essentials 
of 
his 
case 
with 
greatest 
force 
and 
clarity. 
The 
crucial 
question, 
in 
Hilferding’s 
view, 
is 
whether 
the 
individual 
or 
society 
is 
made 
the 
starting 
point 
of 
economics. 
If 
we 
start 
from 
the 
individual, 
as 
Böhm-Bawerk 
does, 
we 
are 
led 
naturally 
to 
consider 
the 
individual’s 
wants 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
objects 
whichsatisfy 
them 
insteadof 
“the 
social 
relationships 
of 
human 
beings 
one 
with 
another” 
(p. 
133 
below). 
“Such 
an 
outlook,” 
according 
to 
Hilferding, 
“is 
unhistorical 
and 
unsocial. 
Its 
categories 
are 
natural 
and 
eternal 
categories” 
(p. 
133 
below). 
Marx, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
starts 
from 
society 
and 
is 
therefore 
led 
to 
consider 
labor 
as 
“the 
constitutive 
element 
in 
human 
society, 
as 
the 
element 
whose 
development 
determines 
in 
the 
final 
analysis 
the 
development 
of 
society” 
(p. 
133). 
Thus 
it 
is 
“because 
labor 
is 
the 
bond 
uniting 
an 
atomized 
society, 
and 
not 
because 



labor 
is 
the 
matter 
most 
technically 
relevant, 
that 
labor 
is 
the 
principle 
of 
value 
and 
that 
the 
law 
of 
value 
is 
endowed 
with 
reality” 
(p. 
134). 
Closely 
related 
to 
these 
different 
starting 
points 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
“in 
striking 
contrast 
with 
Böhm-Bawerk, 
Marx 
looks 
on 
the 
theory 
of 
value, 
not 
as 
the 
means 
for 
ascertaining 
prices, 
but 
as 
the 
means 
for 
discovering 
the 
laws 
of 
motion 
of 
capitalist 
society” 
(p. 
139). 
Hence 
for 
Marx, 
again 
in 
striking 
contrast 
with 
Böhm-Bawerk, 
the 
assumption 
that 
commodities 
exchange 
at 
their 
values 
“merely 
constitutes 
the 
theoretical 
starting 
point 
for 
a 
subsequent 
analysis” 


(p. 
188). 
Hilferding’s 
argument 
is 
excellently 
summed 
up 
in 
the 
following 
passage: 
Whereas 
for 
Böhm-Bawerk, 
labor 
seems 
merely 
one 
of 
the 
determinants 
in 
personal 
estimates 
of 
value, 
in 
Marx’s 
view 
the 
degree 
of 
productivity 
of 
labor 
and 
the 
method 
of 
organization 
of 
labor 
determine 
the 
character 
of 
social 
life. 
Since 
labor, 
viewed 
in 
its 
social 
function 
as 
the 
total 
labor 
of 
society 
of 
which 
each 
individual 
labor 
forms 
merely 
an 
aliquot 
part, 
is 
made 
the 
principle 
of 
value, 
economic 
phenomena 
are 
subordinated 
to 
objective 
laws 
independent 
of 
the 
individual 
will 
and 
controlled 
by 
social 
relationships, 
relationships 
of 
production, 
wherein 
commodities 
play 
the 
part 
of 
intermediaries, 
the 
social 
relationships 
being 
reproduced 
by 
these 
intermediate 
processes 
or 
undergoing 
a 
gradual 
transformation 
until 
they 
demand 
a 
new 
type 
of 
intermediation(p. 
186). 


It 
is 
characteristic 
of 
the 
marginal 
utility 
school 
that 
“Böhm-Bawerk 
has 
never 
become 
aware 
of 
this 
contrast 
of 
outlooks”1 
(p. 
186). 
The 
closest 
he 
comes 
to 
such 
an 
awareness 
is 
in 
his 
discussion 
of 
the 
“objective” 
and 
“subjective” 
methods 
in 
economics; 
but 
in 
reality, 
according 
to 
Hilferding, 
“we 
are 
not 
concerned 
at 
all 
with 
two 
different 
methods, 
but 
with 
contrasted 
and 
mutuallyexclusiveoutlooksuponthewhole 
ofsociallife” 
(p. 
187). 


In 
my 
opinion 
this 
fundamental 
difference 
in 
outlooks 
certainly 
does 
exist; 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
Böhm-Bawerk 
does 
not, 
while 
Hilferding 
does, 
recognize 
its 
existence 
is 
itself 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
difference. 
From 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
unhistorical 
and 
unsocial 
standpoint 
there 
is 
only 
one 
possible 
way 
of 
regardingeconomicphenomena. 
Hence,as 
Ipointed 
outabove,he 
takes 
itfor 
granted 
that 
Marx 
must 
be 
trying 
to 
do 
the 
same 
things 
that 
he, 
Böhm



Bawerk, 
is 
trying 
to 
do. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
from 
Hilferding’s 
historical 
and 
social 
standpoint 
it 
is 
quite 
natural 
that 
the 
defenders 
of 
capitalism 
should 
look 
at 
the 
system, 
which 
they 
consider 
to 
be 
the 
only 
possible 
system, 
differently 
from 
its 
critics 
who 
proceed 
on 
the 
assumption 
that 
all 
social 
systemshaveatransitorycharacter. 


This 
situation, 
it 
must 
be 
admitted, 
makes 
it 
extraordinarily 
difficult 
for 
the 
two 
schools 
of 
economics 
to 
communicate 
intelligently 
with 
each 
other. 
One 
holds 
firmly 
to 
the 
view 
that 
their 
respective 
theories 
must 
be 
judged 
by 
the 
same 
standards, 
while 
the 
other 
is 
equally 
insistent 
that 
they 
cannot 
be. 
Thus, 
Böhm-Bawerk 
regards 
Marxian 
theory 
as 
simply 
wrong, 
while 
Hilferding 
regards 
Böhm-Bawerkian 
theory 
as 
irrelevant 
to 
the 
crucial 
developmental 
tendencies 
ofthecapitalistsystem. 


I 
doubt 
whether 
this 
difficulty 
can 
be 
overcome; 
but 
it 
can 
at 
least 
be 
recognized, 
and 
those 
who 
recognize 
it 
should 
be 
better 
able 
to 
clarify 
their 
own 
position 
to 
themselves 
and 
to 
others. 
It 
is 
certainly 
not 
the 
least 
merit 
of 
Hilferding’s 
work 
that 
it 
not 
only 
expounds 
the 
Marxian 
view 
but 
also 
states 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
Marxian 
and 
the 
orthodox 
views 
with 
unexampled 
lucidity. 


BORTKIEWICZON 
THETRANSFORMATION 
PROBLEM 


BOTH 
Böhm-Bawerk 
and 
Hilferding 
devote 
much 
attention 
to 
the 
relation 
between 
the 
first 
and 
third 
volumes 
of 
Capital. 
Böhm-Bawerk 
argues 
that 
the 
theory 
of 
value 
in 
the 
first 
volume 
is 
in 
flat 
contradiction 
to 
the 
theory 
of 
“price 
of 
production” 
in 
the 
third, 
while 
Hilferding 
holds 
that 
price 
of 
production 
is 
merely 
a 
modification 
of 
value 
and 
hence 
that 
the 
two 
theories 
are 
logically 
related 
and 
in 
no 
sense 
contradictory. 
The 
nature 
of 
their 
views 
and 
of 
the 
disagreement 
between 
them 
was 
such 
that 
neither 
Böhm-Bawerk 
nor 
Hilferding 
was 
moved 
to 
examine 
critically 
the 
actual 
procedure 
which 
Marx 
used 
in 
transforming 
values 
into 
prices 
of 
production. 
Böhm-Bawerk 
believed 
that 
the 
mere 
fact 
of 
a 
difference 
between 
value 
and 
price 
of 
production 
was 
enough 
to 
deprive 
the 
whole 
operation 
of 
any 
interest, 
while 
Hilferding 
was 
concerned 
to 
answer 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
argument 
and 
not 
to 
defendMarx’sprocedure. 
Andyetthereisavery 
realproblem 
here. 


According 
to 
the 
theory 
of 
Volume 
I, 
commodities 
exchange 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
quantity 
of 
labor 
(stored-up 
and 
living) 
embodied 
in 
them. 
Surplus 
value 
(or 
profit), 
however, 
is 
a 
function 
of 
the 
quantity 
of 
living 
labor 
alone. 



Hence, 
of 
two 
commodities 
of 
equal 
value 
one 
with 
relatively 
more 
living 
labor 
will 
contain 
more 
surplus 
value 
than 
one 
with 
relatively 
more 
stored-up 
labor; 
and 
this 
implies 
that 
equal 
investments 
of 
capital 
will 
yield 
different 
rates 
of 
profit 
depending 
on 
whether 
more 
or 
less 
is 
put 
into 
wages 
(living 
labor) 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
or 
material 
accessories 
(stored-up 
labor) 
on 
the 
other. 
But 
this 
theory 
contradicts 
the 
obvious 
fact 
that 
under 
capitalism 
equal 
investments,regardlessof 
their 
composition,tendtoyieldequal 
profits. 


In 
the 
first 
two 
volumes, 
Marx 
ignores 
differences 
in 
the 
composition 
of 
different 
capitals; 
in 
effect, 
he 
assumes 
that 
such 
differences 
do 
not 
exist. 
But 
in 
Volume 
III 
he 
drops 
this 
assumption 
and, 
recognizing 
the 
tendency 
to 
general 
equality 
in 
the 
rates 
of 
profit, 
inquires 
how 
the 
resulting 
“prices 
of 
production” 
arerelatedtothevaluesofVolumeI. 


Marx 
works 
this 
relation 
out 
by 
starting 
from 
a 
value 
scheme 
in 
which 
the 
composition 
of 
capitals 
varies, 
with 
a 
consequent 
multiplicity 
of 
profit 
rates. 
He 
now 
takes 
the 
average 
of 
these 
profit 
rates 
and 
calculates 
prices 
of 
production 
bythefollowingformula: 


c+v+(c+v)p=priceofproduction 
where 
c 
represents 
the 
investment 
in 
plant 
and 
materials, 
v 
the 
investment 
in 
wages,and 
ptheaveragerateof 
profit. 


Now 
there 
is 
undoubtedly 
a 
flaw 
in 
this 
method. 
The 
two 
items 
c 
and 
v 
are 
taken 
over 
from 
the 
value 
scheme 
and 
remain 
unchanged 
in 
the 
price 
of 
production 
scheme. 
In 
other 
words, 
input 
is 
measured 
in 
values 
while 
output 
is 
measured 
in 
prices 
of 
production. 
Obviously 
this 
is 
not 
right. 
A 
large 
part 
of 
today’s 
output 
becomes 
tomorrow’s 
input, 
and 
it 
is 
clear 
that, 
to 
be 
consistent, 
they 
must 
be 
measured 
in 
the 
same 
terms. 
Marx 
himself 
was 
aware 
of 
the 
difficulty,1 
and 
it 
is 
not 
unlikely 
that 
he 
would 
have 
dealt 
with 
it 
if 
he 
had 
lived 
to 
complete 
the 
third 
volume. 
But, 
as 
it 
stands, 
the 
treatment 
of 
the 
relation 
between 
the 
values 
and 
prices 
of 
production 
is 
not 
logically 
satisfactory. 


Böhm-Bawerk 
obviously 
did 
not 
see 
this 
problem 
at 
all. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
he 
regarded 
the 
whole 
operation 
of 
transforming 
values 
into 
prices 
of 
production 
as 
pointless, 
but 
a 
skilled 
debater 
does 
not 
ignore 
a 
detected 
weakness 
in 
his 
opponent’s 
argument 
simply 
because 
he 
considers 
the 
argument 
to 
be 
futile. 
Hilferding, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
seems 
never 
to 
have 
questioned 
the 
soundness 
of 
Marx’s 
procedure. 
Indeed 
thisis 
not 
surprising. 
Earlier 
Marxist 
writers 
had 
takenitforgranted, 
andno 
hostilecritic 
hadcalledit 
inquestion. 


It 
was 
left 
for 
Bortkiewicz, 
in 
the 
paper 
included 
as 
an 
appendix 
to 
this 



volume, 
to 
take 
up 
the 
problem 
and 
to 
attempt 
to 
solve 
it 
within 
the 
frameworkofthe 
Marxiantheory 
ofvalueand 
surplusvalue. 


Ladislaus 
von 
Bortkiewicz 
is 
known 
primarily 
as 
a 
statistician. 
In 
an 
obituary 
which 
appeared 
in 
the 
Economic 
Journal 
(June, 
1932), 
Professor 
Schumpeter 
called 
him 
“by 
far 
the 
most 
eminent 
German 
statistician 
since 
Lexis,”1 
and 
I 
think 
nothing 
has 
occurred 
in 
the 
meanwhile 
to 
make 
this 
judgment 
less 
valid 
today 
than 
it 
was 
in 
1932. 
In 
the 
opinion 
of 
Oscar 
Anderson, 
himself 
a 
mathematical 
statistician 
of 
distinction, 
Bortkiewicz 
was 
“one 
of 
the 
few 
really 
great 
men 
in 
the 
field 
of 
mathematical 
statistics.”2 
This 
high 
reputation 
as 
a 
statistician 
has 
not 
unnaturally 
tended 
to 
divert 
attention 
from 
Bortkiewicz’s 
contributions 
to 
economics; 
and 
an 
additional 
reason 
for 
his 
relative 
obscurity 
as 
an 
economist 
lies 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
most 
significant 
of 
these 
contributions 
took 
the 
form 
of 
critiques 
of 
the 
theories 
of 
others. 
But 
if 
it 
be 
granted 
that 
the 
function 
of 
criticism 
is 
important 
in 
its 
own 
right, 
then 
it 
canhardlybedeniedthatBortkiewicz 
deservesaplaceamongthetop-flight 
economistsofthe 
early 
twentieth 
century.3 


It 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
classify 
Bortkiewicz’s 
economics. 
Professor 
Schumpeter 
says 
that 
Bortkiewicz 
professed 
“the 
Marshallian 
creed,” 
but 
this 
probably 
refers 
to 
the 
later 
period 
of 
his 
life 
and 
to 
his 
teaching 
rather 
than 
to 
his 
writing. 
At 
any 
rate 
there 
is 
little 
evidence 
of 
Marshallian 
influence 
in 
his 
papers 
on 
Marx,4 
and 
it 
is 
with 
these 
that 
we 
are 
primarily 
concerned. 
Judging 
from 
these 
papers, 
it 
seems 
to 
methat 
Bortkiewicz 
must 
bedescribed 
as 
a 
modern 
Ricardian. 
The 
powerful 
impress 
of 
Ricardo’s 
thought 
is 
evident 
throughout, 
and 
Bortkiewicz 
was 
at 
great 
pains 
to 
defend 
Ricardo 
against 
whatheconsideredtobe 
unjustifiedcriticism. 


A 
faithful 
Ricardian 
in 
Bortkiewicz’s 
time 
could 
not 
but 
have 
an 
ambivalent 
attitude 
toward 
both 
of 
the 
important 
contemporary 
schools 
of 
economic 
thought. 
In 
fundamental 
social 
outlook 
and 
aims 
he 
was 
in 
agreement 
with 
the 
subjective 
value 
school 
and 
opposed 
to 
the 
Marxian 
school. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
acceptance 
of 
the 
labor 
theory 
of 
value 
necessarily 
brought 
him 
into 
conflict 
with 
many 
of 
the 
most 
important 
doctrines 
of 
the 
subjective 
value 
theorists 
and 
gave 
him 
much 
in 
common 
with 
Marxian 
ideas. 
This 
peculiar 
mixture 
of 
sympathies 
and 
antipathies 
is 
altogether 
characteristic 
of 
Bortkiewicz’s 
economic 
writings 
and 
goes 
far, 
I 
suspect, 
to 
explaintheirstrikinglyoriginalandstimulatingquality.1 


Bortkiewicz’s 
attitude 
toward 
Marx 
had 
four 
facets. 
Where 
Marx 
agreed 
with 
Ricardo, 
Bortkiewicz 
tended 
to 
approve. 
Where 
Marx 
disagreed 
with 



Ricardo, 
Bortkiewicz 
tended 
to 
defend 
Ricardo. 
Where 
Marx 
departed 
altogether 
from 
Ricardo, 
as 
in 
the 
whole 
theory 
of 
capitalist 
development, 
Bortkiewicz 
was 
either 
uninterested 
or 
uncomprehending. 
And 
finally, 
where 
Marx 
pushed 
further 
along 
trails 
which 
Ricardo 
had 
blazed, 
Bortkiewicz 
was 
a 
sympathetic 
and 
constructive 
critic. 
It 
is 
in 
this 
last 
connection 
that 
BortkiewicztookuptheproblemofvalueandpriceintheMarxiansystem. 


The 
Ricardian 
system 
involves 
a 
highly 
original 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
paradoxical 
line 
of 
reasoning. 
Starting 
from 
the 
labor 
theory 
of 
value, 
Ricardo 
stumbled 
upon 
the 
theory 
that 
profit 
is 
a 
deduction 
from 
the 
product 
of 
labor. 
But 
given 
the 
existence 
of 
profit, 
and 
assuming 
capitals 
of 
different 
durabilityorturnover 
time, 
Ricardo 
proceeded 
at 
once 
to 
demonstratethat 
the 
result 
is 
exchange 
ratios 
(prices) 
which 
no 
longer 
conform 
to 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
labor 
theory 
of 
value. 
In 
other 
words, 
the 
labor 
theory 
of 
value 
forms 
the 
starting 
point 
for 
a 
chain 
of 
reasoning 
which 
leads 
to 
conclusionsatvariancewiththelabortheoryofvalue. 


Now 
the 
question 
at 
once 
arises: 
Is 
this 
a 
legitimate 
procedure? 
Does 
it 
lead 
to 
valid 
results, 
or 
is 
it 
self-defeating? 
Ricardo 
never 
attempted 
to 
answer 
these 
questions; 
he 
was 
content 
to 
take 
the 
validity 
of 
his 
results 
for 
granted. 


For 
a 
strict 
logician 
like 
Bortkiewicz 
this 
must 
have 
been 
a 
very 
unsatisfactory 
state 
of 
affairs. 
He 
was 
convinced 
of 
the 
correctness 
of 
Ricardo’s 
theory 
of 
profit 
(which 
he 
called 
the 
“deduction 
theory”), 
but 
he 
could 
not 
help 
recognizing 
that 
the 
reasoning 
which 
supported 
it 
was 
incomplete 
and 
unsatisfactory. 
There 
was 
no 
rational 
explanation 
in 
the 
Ricardian 
system 
of 
the 
relation 
of 
“values” 
to 
“prices” 
or 
of 
the 
role 
of 
profit 
in 
mediating 
between 
them. 
Under 
these 
circumstances, 
it 
is 
quite 
understandable 
that 
Marx’s 
explicit 
posing 
of 
this 
problem 
and 
attempt 
to 
solve 
it 
in 
Volume 
III 
of 
Capital 
claimed 
Bortkiewicz’s 
careful 
attention 
and 
even 
seemed 
to 
him 
to 
be 
Marx’s 
outstanding 
contribution 
to 
economic 
theory.1 


Bortkiewicz 
wrote 
two 
papers 
on 
Marxian 
economics: 
“Wertrechnung 
und 
Preisrechnung”2 
and 
the 
article 
which 
is 
printed 
below, 
“On 
the 
Correction 
of 
Marx’s 
Fundamental 
Theoretical 
Construction 
in 
the 
Third 
Volume 
of 
Capital.” 
It 
is 
obvious 
from 
the 
titles 
that 
both 
are 
centered 
around 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
relation 
between 
values 
and 
prices, 
and 
it 
is 
also 
clear 
from 
their 
respective 
publication 
datesthatthey 
were, 
so 
to 
speak,jointproductsof 
a 
period 
of 
intensive 
study 
of 
Marx 
and 
his 
critics.1 
The 
fact 
that 
they 
were 



published 
separately 
and 
in 
different 
journals, 
however, 
shows 
that 
Bortkiewicz 
regarded 
them 
as 
independent 
works 
each 
of 
which 
could 
stand 
onitsownfeet. 


“Wertrechnung 
und 
Preisrechnung” 
is 
much 
the 
more 
ambitious 
and 
general 
of 
the 
two. 
It 
includes 
an 
elaborate 
examination 
of 
earlier 
criticisms 
of 
Marx 
(from 
which, 
incidentally, 
the 
critics, 
including 
Böhm-Bawerk, 
emerge 
with 
little 
glory), 
a 
discussion 
of 
the 
flaw 
in 
Marx’s 
method 
of 
transforming 
values 
into 
prices 
of 
production, 
and 
a 
reconsideration 
of 
this 
problem 
in 
terms 
of 
an 
equational 
system 
(attributed 
by 
Bortkiewicz 
to 
the 
Russian 
economist 
W. 
K. 
Dmitrieff) 
which 
conforms 
to 
Ricardian 
theory 
more 
closely 
than 
to 
Marxian 
theory. 
It 
does 
not, 
however, 
attempt 
to 
solve 
the 
transformation 
problem 
as 
Marx 
himself 
presented 
it. 
It 
was 
to 
this 
task 
that 
thearticle 
includedin 
the 
present 
volume 
wasspecificallydirected. 


It 
is 
not 
my 
purpose 
in 
this 
introduction 
to 
analyze 
the 
method 
which 
Bortkiewicz 
substitutes 
for 
Marx’s. 
Whatever 
may 
be 
thought 
of 
it 
today, 
and 
of 
the 
corollaries 
which 
Bortkiewicz 
drew 
from 
it, 
there 
can 
be 
no 
question 
that 
it 
was 
the 
first 
attempt 
to 
solve 
the 
problem 
and 
thus 
forms 
the 
actual 
starting 
point 
for 
all 
subsequent 
work 
on 
the 
subject. 
Moreover—and 
this 
is 
something 
which 
many 
Marxists 
tend 
to 
overlook—the 
aim 
of 
the 
article, 
and 
in 
my 
judgment 
its 
effect 
as 
well, 
was 
not 
to 
attack 
Marxian 
theory 
but 
to 
vindicate 
it. 
Most 
previous 
(and, 
for 
that 
matter, 
subsequent) 
critics 
considered 
the 
theory 
of 
value 
and 
surplus 
value 
to 
be 
the 
Achilles’ 
heel 
of 
the 
Marxian 
system. 
Bortkiewicz 
almost 
alone 
regarded 
it 
as 
Marx’s 
most 
important 
contribution. 
By 
eliminating 
relatively 
superficial 
errors 
he 
hoped 
to 
be 
able 
to 
show 
that 
the 
core 
of 
the 
system 
was 
sound. 
No 
serious 
student 
of 
classical-Marxian 
political 
economy 
can, 
I 
submit, 
afford 
to 
neglect 
Bortkiewicz’sreasoning. 


I 
do 
not 
want 
to 
be 
interpreted 
as 
making 
extravagant 
claims 
for 
Bortkiewicz. 
When 
I 
undertook 
to 
write 
a 
general 
introduction 
to 
Marxian 
economics,1 
I 
found 
Bortkiewicz’s 
treatment 
of 
the 
transformation 
problem 
to 
be 
the 
most 
complete 
and 
satisfactory 
available. 
In 
order 
to 
show 
that 
the 
error 
in 
Marx’s 
method 
is 
without 
importance 
for 
the 
theoretical 
system 
as 
a 
whole, 
I 
reproduced 
in 
summary 
form 
Bortkiewicz’s 
solution 
of 
the 
problem. 
Forthe 
restIdiscussedthe 
significance 
of 
the 
problem 
rather 
than 
the 
method 
of 
solving 
it. 
My 
discussion 
fortunately 
called 
the 
problem 
to 
the 
attention 
of 
others 
better 
equipped 
than 
I 
to 
deal 
with 
its 
mathematical 
aspects. 
Their 
work, 
some 
of 
which 
has 
been 
published2 
(with 
more, 
I 
hope, 
to 
follow), 
has 



convinced 
me 
that 
Bortkiewicz’s 
method 
of 
transforming 
values 
into 
prices, 
whileunobjectionable 
as 
farasitgoes, 
is 
mathematicallyclumsy 
andisbased 
on 
unnecessarily 
restrictive 
assumptions. 
I 
also 
suspect 
that 
most 
of 
Bortkiewicz’s 
corollaries 
are 
connected 
in 
one 
way 
or 
another 
with 
assumptions 
of 
this 
kind 
or, 
as 
Kenneth 
May 
suggests, 
flow 
from 
a 
confusion 
on 
Bortkiewicz’s 
part 
between 
the 
failure 
of 
certain 
relations 
to 
appear 
in 
his 
mathematical 
formulas 
and 
their 
absence 
from 
the 
real 
phenomena 
which 
the 
formulasonlypartiallyreflect. 


It 
is 
to 
be 
hoped 
that 
the 
discussion 
which 
has 
now 
been 
begun 
will 
lead 
to 
a 
more 
or 
less 
definitive 
solution 
of 
the 
transformation 
problem 
and 
its 
implications. 
If 
the 
publication 
in 
English, 
and 
in 
readily 
available 
form, 
of 
Bortkiewicz’s 
original 
essay 
on 
the 
subject 
contributes 
to 
that 
end 
I 
shall 
regarditasfully 
justified. 


As 
editor 
of 
these 
works 
I 
have 
in 
general 
confined 
my 
efforts 
to 
making 
them 
more 
readable 
and 
more 
usable 
to 
present-day 
teachers 
and 
students 
of 
the 
social 
sciences. 
Style 
and 
spelling 
have 
been 
rendered 
uniform 
throughout. 
All 
quotations 
from 
Capital 
now 
refer 
to 
the 
Kerr 
edition, 
though 
the 
wording 
(except 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Hilferding’s 
quotations 
from 
Volume 
III) 
remains 
that 
of 
the 
translators 
of 
these 
works. 
The 
translations 
themselves 
have 
been 
altered 
in 
a 
few 
places 
which 
were 
unclear, 
or 
ambiguous, 
or 
dated, 
by 
checking 
back 
to 
the 
German 
originals. 
For 
example, 
Miss 
Macdonald’s 
translation 
of 
Arbeitskraft 
as 
“working 
powers” 
has 
everywhere 
been 
replaced 
by 
the 
more 
familiar 
“labor 
power.” 
All 
references 
in 
Hilferding 
to 
Böhm-Bawerk 
have 
been 
given 
the 
page 
numbers 
of 
the 
present 
volume. 
Several 
of 
Eden 
and 
Cedar 
Paul’s 
translators’ 
notes 
to 
Hilferding 
remain 
and 
are 
identified 
by 
their 
initials. 
(See 
especially 
the 
long 
note 
on 
pp. 
143-144 
where 
the 
Pauls 
enter 
into 
a 
debate 
with 
Hilferding; 
in 
my 
judgment, 
Hilferding 
is 
perfectly 
correct 
in 
his 
interpretation 
of 
Marx 
at 
this 
point, 
but 
he 
did 
overlook 
a 
change 
in 
wording 
between 
the 
second 
and 
third 
editions 
which 
shouldhavebeen 
takenintoaccount.)

“From

he 
told 
the

allowed 
to 
quote 
what 
I 
wrote 
myself 
at 
about 
the 
same 
time: 
“By 
far 
the 
best 
statement 
of 
this 
point 
of 
view 
[i.e. 
that 
the 
alleged 
contradiction 
between 
Volumes 
I 
and 
III 
of 
Capital 
proves 
the 
uselessness 
of 
the 
labor 
theory 
of 
value] 
is 
that 
of 
Böhm-Bawerk, 
Karl 
Marx 
and 
the 
Close 
of 
His 
System. 
It 
is 
hardly 
an 
exaggeration 
to 
say 
that 
subsequent 
critiques 
of 
Marxian 
economics 
have 
been 
mere 
repetitions 
of 
Böhm’s 
arguments. 
The 
one 
great 
exception 
is 
the 
critique 
of 
Ladislaus 
von 
Bortkiewicz.”

P. 
H. 
Wicksteed, 
Das 
Kapital: 
A 
Criticism, 
first 
published 
in 
the 
socialist 
magazine 
Today, 
October, 
1884; 
reprinted 
in 
The 
Common 
Sense 
of 
Political 
Economy 
(1933), 
Vol. 
II, 
pp. 
705ff. 
In 
my 
judgment 
Wicksteed’s 
criticism, 
despite 
its 
brevity, 
is 
in 
many 
respects 
a 
better 
piece 
of 
work 
than 
the 
virtually 
simultaneous 
chapter 
on 
Marx 
in 
Böhm-Bawerk’s 
Capital 
and 
Interest. 
It 
is 
interesting 
to 
note 
that 
Wicksteed’s 
review 
appeared 
at 
a 
time 
when 
Marxism 
seemed 
to 
be 
making 
real 
headway 
in 
Britain. 
Later 
on, 
when 
the 
British 
labor 
movement 
had 
definitely 
turned 
away 
from 
Marxism, 
no 
topflight 
British 
economist 
showed 
any 
interest 
in 
the 
subject 
until 
Mrs. 
Joan 
Robinson’s 
very 
interesting 
Essay 
on 
Marxian 
Economics 
(1942).

Pareto’s 
criticism 
of 
Marx 
is 
divided 
into 
two 
parts, 
separated 
by 
nearly 
a 
decade. 
First, 
his 
introductionto 
Karl 
Marx: 
Le 
capital, 
extraits 
faits 
par 
M. 
Paul 
Lafargue 
(1893); 
second, 
two 
chapters 
entitled 
“L’économie 
marxiste” 
and 
“La 
théorie 
matérialiste 
de 
l’histoire 
et 
la 
lutte 
des 
classes” 
(totaling 
133 
pages) 
in 
Les 
systèmes 
socialistes 
(2 
vols., 
1902). 
Both 
of 
these, 
written 
in 
Pareto’s 
characteristically 
arrogant 
and 
superficial 
manner, 
I 
consider 
definitely 
inferior 
to 
Böhm-Bawerk. 
A 
useful 
commentary 
on 
Pareto 
is 
Erwin 
Schuler, 
Pareto’s 
Marx-Kritik 
(written 
before 
1933, 
published 



1935).

It 
could 
be 
argued 
that 
Pareto 
did 
in 
factoccupy 
this 
position 
in 
the 
Latin 
countries. 
I 
do 
not 
know 
the 
relevant 
literature 
well 
enough 
to 
form 
an 
opinion 
on 
this; 
but 
I 
do 
know 
that 
Pareto’s 
criticisms 
of 
Marx 
were 
never 
translated 
and 
exerted 
no 
significant 
influence 
in 
German-or 
English-speaking 
countries.

Franz 
Weiss 
says, 
with 
justice, 
that 
“Böhm-Bawerk’s 
criticism 
of 
Marx 
contrasts 
favorably 
with 
much 
that 
has 
since 
been 
written, 
both 
for 
and 
against 
Marx, 
by 
its 
dispassionate 
tone. 
Standing 
in 
complete 
opposition 
to 
Marx’s 
teachings, 
Böhm-Bawerk 
was 
extremely 
careful 
to 
be 
fair 
to 
him 
as 
a 
person.”

correct. 
An 
advertisement

on 
the 
other 
hand, 
that 
it

KARLMARX 
ANDTHECLOSEOFHIS 
SYSTEM 



BY 
EugenvonBöhm-Bawerk 


INTRODUCTION 


As 
AN 
author 
Karl 
Marx 
was 
enviably 
fortunate. 
No 
one 
will 
affirm 
that 
his 
work 
can 
be 
classed 
among 
the 
books 
which 
are 
easy 
to 
read 
or 
easy 
to 
understand. 
Most 
other 
books 
would 
have 
found 
their 
way 
to 
popularity 
hopelessly 
barred 
if 
they 
had 
labored 
under 
an 
even 
lighter 
ballast 
of 
hard 
dialectic 
and 
wearisome 
mathematical 
deduction. 
But 
Marx, 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
this, 
has 
become 
the 
apostle 
of 
wide 
circles 
of 
readers, 
including 
many 
who 
are 
not 
as 
a 
rule 
given 
to 
the 
reading 
of 
difficult 
books. 
Moreover, 
the 
force 
and 
clearness 
of 
his 
reasoning 
were 
not 
such 
as 
to 
compel 
assent. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
men 
who 
are 
classed 
among 
the 
most 
earnest 
and 
most 
valued 
thinkers 
of 
our 
science, 
like 
Karl 
Knies, 
had 
contended 
from 
the 
first, 
by 
arguments 
that 
it 
was 
impossible 
to 
ignore, 
that 
the 
Marxian 
teaching 
was 
chargedfromtoptobottomwithevery 
kindofcontradictionbothof 
logic 
and 
of 
fact. 
It 
could 
easily 
have 
happened, 
therefore, 
that 
Marx’s 
work 
might 
have 
found 
no 
favor 
with 
any 
part 
of 
the 
public—not 
with 
the 
general 
public 
because 
it 
could 
not 
understand 
his 
difficult 
dialectic, 
and 
not 
with 
the 
specialists 
because 
they 
understood 
it 
and 
its 
weaknesses 
only 
too 
well. 
As 
a 
matterof 
fact,however,ithas 
happened 
otherwise. 


Nor 
has 
the 
fact 
that 
Marx’s 
work 
remained 
a 
torso 
during 
the 
lifetime 
of 
its 
author 
been 
prejudicial 
to 
its 
influence. 
We 
are 
usually, 
and 
rightly, 
apt 
to 
mistrust 
such 
isolated 
first 
volumes 
of 
new 
systems. 
General 
principles 
can 
be 
very 
prettily 
put 
forward 
in 
the 
“General 
Sections” 
of 
a 
book, 
but 
whether 
they 
really 
possess 
the 
convincing 
power 
ascribed 
to 
them 
by 
their 
author 
can 



only 
be 
ascertained 
when 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
system 
they 
are 
brought 
face 
to 
face 
with 
all 
the 
facts 
in 
detail. 
And 
in 
the 
history 
of 
science 
it 
has 
not 
seldom 
happened 
that 
a 
promising 
and 
imposing 
first 
volume 
has 
never 
been 
followed 
by 
a 
second, 
just 
because, 
under 
the 
author’s 
own 
more 
searching 
scrutiny, 
the 
new 
principles 
had 
not 
been 
able 
to 
stand 
the 
test 
of 
concrete 
facts. 
But 
the 
work 
of 
Karl 
Marx 
has 
not 
suffered 
in 
this 
way. 
The 
great 
mass 
of 
his 
followers, 
on 
the 
strength 
of 
his 
first 
volume, 
had 
unbounded 
faith 
in 
theyetunwrittenvolumes. 


This 
faith 
was, 
moreover, 
in 
one 
case 
put 
to 
an 
unusually 
severe 
test. 
Marx 
had 
taught 
in 
his 
first 
volume 
that 
the 
whole 
value 
of 
commodities 
was 
based 
on 
the 
labor 
embodied 
in 
them, 
and 
that 
by 
virtue 
of 
this 
“law 
of 
value” 
they 
must 
exchange 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
quantity 
of 
labor 
which 
they 
contain; 
that, 
further, 
the 
profit 
or 
surplus 
value 
falling 
to 
the 
capitalist 
was 
the 
fruit 
of 
extortion 
practiced 
on 
the 
worker; 
that, 
nevertheless, 
the 
amount 
of 
surplus 
value 
was 
not 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
whole 
amount 
of 
the 
capital 
employed 
by 
the 
capitalist, 
but 
only 
to 
the 
amount 
of 
the 
“variable” 
part—that 
is, 
to 
that 
part 
of 
capital 
paid 
in 
wages—while 
the 
“constant 
capital,” 
the 
capital 
employed 
in 
the 
purchase 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
added 
no 
surplus 
value. 
In 
daily 
life, 
however, 
the 
profit 
of 
capital 
is 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
total 
capital 
invested; 
and, 
largely 
on 
this 
account, 
the 
commodities 
do 
not 
as 
a 
fact 
exchange 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
amount 
of 
work 
incorporated 
in 
them. 
Here, 
therefore, 
there 
was 
a 
contradiction 
between 
system 
and 
fact 
which 
hardly 
seemed 
to 
admit 
of 
a 
satisfactory 
explanation. 
Nor 
did 
the 
obvious 
contradiction 
escape 
Marx 
himself. 
He 
says 
with 
reference 
to 
it, 
“This 
law” 
(the 
law, 
namely, 
that 
surplus 
value 
is 
in 
proportion 
only 
to 
the 
variable 
part 
of 
capital), 
“clearly 
contradicts 
all 
prima 
facie 
experience.”1 
But 
at 
the 
same 
time 
he 
declares 
the 
contradiction 
to 
be 
only 
a 
seeming 
one, 
the 
solution 
of 
which 
requires 
many 
missing 
links, 
and 
will 
be 
postponed 
to 
later 
volumes 
of 
his 
work.2 
Expert 
criticism 
thought 
it 
might 
venture 
to 
prophesy 
with 
certainty 
that 
Marx 
would 
never 
redeem 
this 
promise, 
because, 
as 
it 
sought 
elaborately 
to 
prove, 
the 
contradiction 
was 
insoluble. 
Its 
reasoning, 
however, 
made 
no 
impression 
at 
all 
on 
the 
mass 
of 
Marx’s 
followers. 
His 
simple 
promiseoutweighedalllogicalrefutations. 


The 
suspense 
grewmore 
trying 
when 
it 
was 
seen 
that 
inthe 
second 
volume 
of 
Marx’s 
work, 
which 
appeared 
after 
the 
master’s 
death, 
no 
attempt 
had 
been 
made 
towards 
the 
announced 
solution 
(which, 
according 
to 
the 
plan 
of 
the 
whole 
work, 
was 
reserved 
for 
the 
third 
volume), 
nor 
even 
was 
the 



slightest 
intimation 
given 
of 
the 
direction 
in 
which 
Marx 
proposed 
to 
seek 
for 
the 
solution. 
But 
the 
preface 
of 
the 
editor, 
Friedrich 
Engels, 
not 
only 
contained 
the 
reiterated 
positive 
assertion 
that 
the 
solution 
was 
given 
in 
the 
manuscript 
left 
by 
Marx, 
but 
contained 
also 
an 
open 
challenge, 
directed 
chiefly 
to 
the 
followers 
of 
Rodbertus, 
that, 
in 
the 
interval 
before 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
third 
volume, 
they 
should 
from 
their 
own 
resources 
attempt 
to 
solve 
the 
problem 
“how, 
not 
only 
without 
contradicting 
the 
law 
of 
value 
but 
even 
by 
virtue 
of 
it, 
an 
equal 
average 
rate 
of 
profit 
can 
and 
must 
be 
created.” 


I 
consider 
it 
one 
of 
the 
most 
striking 
tributes 
which 
could 
have 
been 
paid 
toMarxas 
athinker 
thatthischallengewastakenup 
bysomanypersons,and 
in 
circles 
so 
much 
wider 
than 
the 
one 
to 
which 
it 
was 
chiefly 
directed. 
Not 
only 
followers 
of 
Rodbertus, 
but 
men 
from 
Marx’s 
own 
camp, 
and 
even 
economists 
who 
did 
not 
give 
their 
adherence 
to 
either 
of 
these 
heads 
of 
the 
socialist 
school, 
but 
who 
would 
probably 
have 
been 
called 
by 
Marx 
“vulgar 
economists,” 
vied 
with 
each 
other 
in 
the 
attempt 
to 
penetrate 
into 
the 
probable 
nexus 
of 
Marx’s 
lines 
of 
thought, 
which 
were 
still 
shrouded 
in 
mystery. 
There 
grew 
up 
between 
1885, 
the 
year 
when 
the 
second 
volume 
of 
Marx’s 
Capital 
appeared, 
and 
1894 
when 
the 
third 
volume 
came 
out, 
a 
regular 
prize 
essay 
competition 
on 
the 
“average 
rate 
of 
profit” 
and 
its 
relation 
to 
the 
“law 
of 
value.”1 
According 
to 
the 
view 
of 
Friedrich 
Engels—now, 
like 
Marx, 
no 
longer 
living—as 
stated 
in 
his 
criticism 
of 
these 
prize 
essays 
in 
the 
prefacetothethirdvolume, 
noone 
succeededin 
carryingofftheprize. 


Now 
at 
last, 
however, 
with 
the 
long-delayed 
appearance 
of 
the 
conclusion 
of 
Marx’s 
system, 
the 
subject 
has 
reached 
a 
stage 
when 
a 
definite 
decision 
is 
possible. 
For 
of 
the 
mere 
promise 
of 
a 
solution 
each 
one 
could 
think 
as 
much 
or 
as 
little 
as 
he 
liked. 
Promises 
on 
the 
one 
side 
and 
arguments 
on 
the 
other 
were, 
in 
a 
sense, 
incommensurable. 
Even 
successful 
refutations 
of 
attempted 
solutions 
by 
others, 
though 
these 
attempts 
were 
held 
by 
their 
authors 
to 
have 
been 
conceived 
and 
carried 
out 
in 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
Marxian 
theory, 
did 
not 
need 
to 
be 
acknowledged 
by 
the 
adherents 
of 
Marx, 
for 
they 
could 
always 
appeal 
from 
the 
faulty 
likeness 
to 
the 
promised 
original. 
But 
now 
at 
last 
this 
latter 
has 
come 
to 
light, 
and 
has 
procured 
for 
thirty 
years’ 
struggle 
a 
firm, 
narrow, 
and 
clearly 
defined 
battleground 
within 
which 
both 
parties 
can 
take 
their 
stand 
in 
order 
and 
fight 
the 
matter 
out, 
instead 
of 
on 
the 
one 
side 
contenting 
themselves 
with 
the 
hope 
of 
future 
revelations, 
or 
on 
the 
other

Chapter 
One 


THE 
THEORY 
OF 
VALUE 
AND 
SURPLUS 
VALUE 


THE 
pillars 
of 
the 
system 
of 
Marx 
are 
his 
conception 
of 
value 
and 
his 
law 
of 
value. 
Without 
them, 
as 
Marx 
repeatedly 
asserts, 
all 
scientific 
knowledge 
of 
economic 
facts 
would 
be 
impossible. 
The 
mode 
in 
which 
he 
arrives 
at 
his 
views 
with 
reference 
to 
both 
has 
been 
described 
and 
discussed 
times 
without 
number. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
connection 
I 
must 
recapitulate 
briefly 
the 
most 
essentialpointsofhis 
argument. 


The 
field 
of 
research 
which 
Marx 
undertakes 
to 
explore 
in 
order 
“to 
come 
upon 
the 
track 
of 
value” 
(I, 
55) 
he 
limits 
from 
the 
beginning 
to 
commodities, 
by 
which, 
according 
to 
him, 
we 
are 
not 
to 
understand 
all 
economic 
goods, 
but 
only 
those 
products 
of 
labor 
which 
are 
made 
for 
the 
market.1 
He 
begins 
with 
the 
“Analysis 
of 
a 
Commodity” 
(I, 
41). 
A 
commodity 
is, 
on 
one 
side, 
a 
useful 
thing, 
which 
by 
its 
properties 
satisfies 
human 
wants 
of 
some 
kind; 
and 
on 
the 
other, 
it 
forms 
the 
material 
medium 
of 
exchange 
value. 
He 
then 
passes 
to 
an 



analysis 
of 
this 
latter. 
“Exchange 
value 
presents 
itself 
in 
the 
first 
instance 
as 
the 
quantitative 
relation, 
the 
proportion, 
in 
which 
values 
in 
use 
of 
one 
kind 
are 
exchanged 
for 
values 
in 
use 
of 
another 
kind, 
a 
relation 
which 
constantly 
changes 
with 
time 
and 
place.” 
Exchange 
value, 
therefore, 
appears 
to 
be 
something 
accidental. 
And 
yet 
there 
must 
be 
in 
this 
changing 
relation 
something 
that 
is 
stable 
and 
unchanging, 
and 
this 
Marx 
undertakes 
to 
bring 
to 
light. 
He 
does 
it 
in 
his 
well-known 
dialectical 
manner. 
“Let 
us 
take 
two 
commodities, 
wheat 
and 
iron, 
for 
example. 
Whatever 
may 
be 
their 
relative 
rate 
of 
exchange 
it 
may 
always 
be 
represented 
by 
an 
equation 
in 
which 
a 
given 
quantity 
of 
wheat 
is 
equal 
to 
a 
given 
quantity 
of 
iron: 
for 
example, 
i 
quarter 
wheat 
= 
i 
cwt. 
iron. 
What 
does 
this 
equation 
tell 
us? 
It 
tells 
us 
that 
there 
exists 
a 
common 
factor 
of 
the 
same 
magnitude 
in 
two 
different 
things, 
in 
a 
quarter 
of 
wheat 
and 
in 
a 
cwt. 
of 
iron. 
The 
two 
things 
are 
therefore 
equal 
to 
a 
third 
which 
is 
in 
itself 
neither 
the 
one 
nor 
the 
other. 
Each 
of 
the 
two, 
so 
farasitisan 
exchangevalue,mustthereforebereducible 
tothatthird.” 


“This 
common 
factor,” 
Marx 
goes 
on, 
“cannot 
be 
a 
geometrical, 
physical, 
chemical 
or 
other 
natural 
property 
of 
the 
commodities. 
Their 
physical 
properties 
come 
into 
consideration 
for 
the 
most 
part 
only 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
make 
the 
commodities 
useful, 
and 
so 
make 
them 
values 
in 
use. 
But, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
exchange 
relation 
of 
commodities 
is 
obviously 
determined 
without 
reference 
to 
their 
value 
in 
use. 
Within 
this 
relation 
one 
value 
in 
use 
is 
worth 
just 
as 
much 
as 
any 
other, 
if 
only 
it 
is 
present 
in 
proper 
proportion. 
Or, 
as 
old 
Barbon 
says, 
‘One 
sort 
of 
wares 
are 
as 
good 
as 
another, 
if 
the 
value 
be 
equal. 
There 
is 
no 
difference 
or 
distinction 
in 
things 
of 
equal 
value.’ 
As 
values 
in 
use 
commodities 
are 
above 
everything 
of 
different 
qualities; 
as 
exchange 
values 
they 
can 
only 
be 
of 
different 
quantities, 
and 
they 
can, 
therefore,containno 
atomofvalueinuse. 


“If 
then 
we 
abstract 
from 
the 
value 
in 
use 
of 
commodities, 
there 
remains 
to 
them 
only 
one 
common 
property, 
that 
of 
being 
products 
of 
labor. 
But 
even 
as 
products 
of 
labor 
they 
have 
already, 
by 
the 
very 
process 
of 
abstraction, 
undergone 
a 
change 
under 
our 
hands. 
For 
if 
we 
abstract 
from 
the 
value 
in 
use 
of 
a 
commodity, 
we 
at 
the 
same 
time 
abstract 
from 
the 
material 
constituents 
and 
forms 
which 
give 
it 
a 
value 
in 
use. 
It 
is 
no 
longer 
a 
table, 
or 
a 
house, 
or 
yarn, 
or 
any 
other 
useful 
thing. 
All 
its 
physical 
qualities 
have 
disappeared. 
Nor 
is 
it 
any 
longer 
the 
product 
of 
the 
labor 
of 
the 
carpenter, 
or 
the 
mason, 
or 
the 
spinner, 
or 
of 
any 
other 
particular 
productive 
industry. 
With 
the 
useful 
character 
of 
the 
labor 
products 
there 
disappears 
the 
useful 
character 
of 
the 



labors 
embodied 
in 
them, 
and 
there 
vanish 
also 
the 
different 
concrete 
forms 
of 
these 
labors. 
They 
are 
no 
longer 
distinguished 
from 
each 
other, 
but 
are 
all 
reducedtoidentical 
humanlabor—abstracthuman 
labor. 


“Let 
us 
examine 
now 
the 
residuum. 
There 
is 
nothing 
but 
this 
ghostly 
objectivity, 
the 
mere 
cellular 
tissue 
of 
undistinguishable 
human 
labor, 
that 
is, 
of 
the 
output 
of 
human 
labor 
withoutregardto 
theform 
of 
the 
output. 
Allthat 
these 
things 
have 
now 
to 
show 
for 
themselves 
is 
that 
human 
labor 
has 
been 
expended 
in 
their 
production—that 
human 
labor 
has 
been 
stored 
up 
in 
them; 
and 
ascrystalsofthiscommon 
socialsubstancethey 
are—values.” 


With 
this, 
then, 
we 
have 
the 
conception 
of 
value 
discovered 
and 
determined. 
It 
is 
in 
dialectical 
form 
not 
identical 
with 
exchange 
value, 
but 
it 
stands, 
as 
I 
would 
now 
make 
plain, 
in 
the 
most 
intimate 
and 
inseparable 
relation 
to 
it. 
It 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
logical 
distillation 
from 
it. 
It 
is, 
to 
speak 
in 
Marx’s 
own 
words, 
“the 
common 
element 
that 
manifests 
itself 
in 
the 
exchange 
relation, 
or 
exchange 
value, 
of 
commodities”; 
or 
again 
conversely, 
“the 
exchange 
value 
is 
the 
only 
form 
in 
which 
the 
value 
of 
commodities 
can 
manifestitselforbeexpressed” 
(I,45). 


After 
establishing 
the 
conception 
of 
value 
Marx 
proceeds 
to 
describe 
its 
measure 
and 
its 
amount. 
As 
labor 
is 
the 
substance 
of 
value 
so 
the 
amount 
of 
the 
value 
of 
all 
goods 
is 
measured 
by 
the 
quantity 
of 
labor 
contained 
in 
them, 
which 
is, 
in 
its 
turn, 
measured 
by 
its 
duration—but 
not 
by 
that 
particular 
duration, 
or 
working 
time, 
which 
the 
individual 
who 
made 
the 
commodity 
has 
happened 
to 
need, 
but 
by 
the 
working 
time 
that 
is 
socially 
necessary. 
Marx 
defines 
this 
last 
as 
the 
“working 
time 
required 
to 
produce 
a 
value 
in 
use 
under 
the 
normal 
conditions 
of 
production, 
and 
with 
the 
degree 
of 
skill 
and 
intensity 
of 
labor 
prevalent 
in 
a 
given 
society” 
(I, 
46). 
“It 
is 
only 
the 
quantity 
of 
socially 
necessary 
labor, 
or 
the 
working 
time 
socially 
necessary 
for 
the 
production 
of 
a 
value 
in 
use, 
which 
determines 
the 
amount 
of 
the 
value. 
The 
single 
commodity 
is 
here 
to 
be 
regarded 
as 
an 
average 
specimen 
of 
its 
class. 
Commodities, 
therefore, 
in 
which 
equal 
quantities 
of 
labor 
are 
embodied, 
or 
which 
can 
be 
produced 
in 
the 
same 
working 
time, 
have 
the 
same 
value. 
The 
value 
of 
one 
commodity 
is 
related 
to 
the 
value 
of 
any 
other 
commodity 
as 
the 
working 
time 
necessary 
for 
the 
production 
of 
the 
one 
is 
to 
that 
necessary 
for 
the 
production 
of 
the 
other. 
As 
values, 
all 
commodities 
are 
only 
specific 
quantitiesofcrystallizedworkingtime.” 


From 
all 
this 
is 
derived 
the 
subject 
matter 
of 
the 
great 
“law 
of 
value,” 
which 
is 
“immanent 
in 
the 
exchange 
of 
commodities” 
(I, 
176, 
184), 
and 



governs 
exchange 
relations. 
It 
states, 
and 
must 
state, 
after 
what 
has 
gone 
before, 
that 
commodities 
are 
exchanged 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
socially 
necessary 
working 
time 
incorporated 
in 
them 
(I, 
86). 
Other 
modes 
of 
expressing 
the 
same 
law 
are 
that 
“commodities 
exchange 
according 
to 
their 
values” 
(I, 
177, 
217; 
III, 
221), 
or 
that 
“equivalent 
exchanges 
with 
equivalent” 
(I, 
184, 
217). 
It 
is 
true 
that 
in 
isolated 
cases 
according 
to 
momentary 
fluctuations 
of 
supply 
and 
demand 
prices 
occur 
which 
are 
over 
or 
under 
the 
values. 
But 
these 
“constant 
oscillations 
of 
market 
prices 
… 
compensate 
and 
cancel 
each 
other, 
and 
reduce 
themselves 
to 
the 
average 
price 
as 
their 
inner 
law” 
(I, 
i84n). 
In 
the 
long 
run 
“the 
socially 
necessary 
working 
time 
always 
asserts 
itself 
by 
main 
force, 
like 
an 
overruling 
natural 
law, 
in 
the 
accidental 
and 
ever 
fluctuating 
exchange 
relations” 
(I, 
86). 
Marx 
declares 
this 
law 
to 
be 
the 
“eternal 
law 
of 
the 
exchange 
of 
commodities” 
(I, 
215), 
and 
“the 
rational 
element” 
and 
“the 
natural 
law 
of 
equilibrium” 
(III, 
221). 
The 
inevitably 
occurring 
cases 
already 
mentioned 
in 
which 
commodities 
are 
exchanged 
for 
prices 
which 
deviate 
from 
their 
values 
are 
to 
be 
looked 
upon, 
in 
regard 
to 
this 
rule, 
as 
“accidental” 
(I, 
18/m), 
and 
he 
even 
calls 
the 
deviation 
“a 
breach 
of 
thelaw 
oftheexchangeofcommodities” 
(I,177). 


On 
these 
principles 
of 
the 
theory 
of 
value 
Marx 
founds 
the 
second 
part 
of 
the 
structure 
of 
his 
teaching, 
his 
renowned 
doctrine 
of 
surplus 
value. 
In 
this 
part 
he 
traces 
the 
source 
of 
the 
gain 
which 
capitalists 
obtain 
from 
their 
capital. 
Capitalists 
lay 
down 
a 
certain 
sum 
of 
money, 
convert 
it 
into 
commodities, 
and 
then—with 
or 
without 
an 
intermediate 
process 
of 
production—convert 
these 
back 
again 
into 
more 
money. 
Whence 
comes 
this 
increment, 
this 
increase 
in 
the 
sum 
drawn 
out 
as 
compared 
with 
the 
sum 
originallyadvanced? 
orwhencecomes 
“the 
surplusvalue” 
as 
Marx 
calls 
it?1 


Marx 
proceeds 
to 
mark 
off 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
problem 
in 
his 
own 
peculiar 
way 
of 
dialectical 
exclusion. 
He 
first 
declares 
that 
the 
surplus 
value 
cannot 
originate 
either 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
capitalist, 
as 
buyer, 
buys 
commodities 
regularly 
under 
their 
value, 
nor 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
capitalist, 
as 
seller, 
sells 
them 
regularly 
over 
their 
value. 
So 
the 
problem 
presents 
itself 
in 
the 
following 
way: 
“The 
owner 
of 
money 
must 
buy 
the 
commodities 
at 
their 
value, 
then 
sell 
them 
at 
their 
value, 
and 
yet 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
process 
must 
draw 
out 
more 
money 
than 
he 
put 
in. 
Such 
are 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
problem. 
Hie 
Rhodus, 
hie 
salta!” 
(I,185 
ff.). 


The 
solution 
Marx 
finds 
in 
this, 
that 
there 
is 
one 
commodity 
whose 
value 
in 
use 
possesses 
the 
peculiar 
property 
of 
being 
a 
source 
of 
exchange 
value. 



This 
commodity 
is 
the 
capacity 
of 
labor, 
labor 
power. 
It 
is 
offered 
for 
sale 
in 
the 
market 
under 
the 
twofold 
condition 
that 
the 
laborer 
is 
personally 
free, 
for 
otherwise 
it 
would 
not 
be 
his 
labor 
power 
only 
that 
would 
be 
for 
sale, 
but 
his 
whole 
person 
as 
a 
slave; 
and 
that 
the 
laborer 
is 
destitute 
of 
“all 
the 
means 
necessary 
for 
the 
realizing 
of 
his 
labor 
power,” 
for 
otherwise 
he 
would 
prefer 
to 
produce 
on 
his 
own 
account 
and 
to 
offer 
for 
sale 
his 
products 
rather 
than 
his 
labor 
power. 
It 
is 
by 
trading 
in 
this 
commodity 
that 
the 
capitalist 
obtains 
the 
surplus 
value; 
and 
he 
does 
so 
in 
the 
following 
way: 
the 
value 
of 
the 
commodity, 
“labor 
power,” 
is 
regulated 
like 
any 
other 
commodity 
by 
the 
working 
time 
necessary 
for 
its 
reproduction; 
that 
is, 
in 
this 
case, 
by 
the 
working 
time 
which 
is 
needed 
to 
create 
so 
much 
means 
of 
subsistence 
as 
is 
required 
for 
the 
maintenance 
of 
the 
worker. 
If, 
for 
example, 
a 
working 
time 
of 
six 
hours 
is 
required 
in 
a 
given 
society 
for 
the 
production 
of 
the 
necessary 
means 
of 
subsistence 
for 
one 
day, 
and, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
as 
we 
will 
suppose, 
this 
working 
time 
is 
embodied 
in 
three 
shillings 
of 
money, 
then 
the 
labor 
power 
of 
one 
day 
can 
be 
bought 
for 
three 
shillings. 
If 
the 
capitalist 
has 
concluded 
this 
purchase, 
the 
value 
in 
use 
of 
the 
labor 
power 
belongs 
to 
him 
and 
he 
realizes 
it 
by 
causing 
the 
laborer 
to 
work 
for 
him. 
But 
if 
he 
made 
him 
work 
only 
so 
many 
hours 
a 
day 
as 
are 
embodied 
in 
the 
labor 
power 
itself, 
and 
as 
must 
have 
been 
paid 
for 
in 
the 
buying 
of 
the 
same, 
no 
surplus 
value 
would 
arise. 
For, 
according 
to 
the 
assumption, 
six 
hours 
of 
labor 
could 
not 
put 
into 
the 
products 
in 
which 
they 
are 
embodied 
a 
greater 
value 
than 
three 
shillings, 
and 
so 
much 
the 
capitalist 
has 
paid 
as 
wages. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
the 
way 
in 
which 
capitalists 
act. 
Even 
if 
they 
have 
bought 
the 
labor 
power 
for 
a 
price 
which 
only 
corresponds 
to 
six 
hours’ 
working 
time, 
they 
yet 
make 
the 
laborer 
work 
the 
whole 
day 
for 
them. 
And 
now 
in 
the 
product 
made 
during 
this 
day 
there 
are 
incorporated 
more 
hours 
of 
labor 
than 
the 
capitalist 
was 
obliged 
to 
pay 
for. 
He 
has, 
therefore, 
a 
greater 
value 
than 
the 
wages 
he 
has 
paid, 
and 
the 
difference 
is 
“surplusvalue,” 
whichfallstothe 
capitalist. 


Let 
us 
take 
an 
example: 
suppose 
that 
a 
worker 
can 
spin 
ten 
pounds 
of 
cotton 
into 
yarn 
in 
six 
hours; 
and 
suppose 
this 
cotton 
has 
required 
twenty 
hoursoflaborforitsownproduction 
andpossesses 
accordinglya 
valueof 
ten 
shillings; 
and 
suppose, 
further, 
that 
during 
the 
six 
hours 
of 
spinning 
the 
spinner 
uses 
up 
so 
much 
of 
his 
tools 
as 
corresponds 
to 
the 
labor 
of 
four 
hours 
and 
represents 
consequently 
a 
value 
of 
two 
shillings; 
then 
the 
total 
value 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
consumed 
in 
the 
spinning 
will 
amount 
to 
twelve 
shillings, 
corresponding 
to 
twenty-four 
hours’ 
labor. 
In 
the 
spinning 
process 



the 
cotton 
“absorbs” 
another 
six 
hours 
of 
labor. 
Therefore 
the 
yarn 
that 
has 
been 
spun 
is, 
as 
a 
whole, 
the 
product 
of 
thirty 
hours 
of 
labor, 
and 
will 
have 
accordingly 
a 
value 
of 
fifteen 
shillings. 
On 
the 
supposition 
that 
the 
capitalist 
has 
made 
the 
hired 
laborer 
work 
only 
six 
hours 
in 
the 
day, 
the 
production 
of 
the 
yarn 
has 
cost 
him 
at 
least 
fifteen 
shillings: 
ten 
shillings 
for 
cotton, 
two 
shillings 
for 
wear 
and 
tear 
of 
tools, 
three 
shillings 
for 
wages 
of 
labor. 
Here 
thereis 
nosurplusvalue. 


It 
is 
quite 
a 
different 
thing, 
however, 
if 
the 
capitalist 
makes 
the 
laborer 
worktwelvehoursaday. 
Intwelve 
hours 
thelaborer 
worksup 
twentypounds 
of 
cotton 
in 
which 
forty 
hours 
of 
labor 
have 
been 
previously 
embodied, 
and 
which 
are, 
therefore, 
worth 
twenty 
shillings. 
He 
further 
uses 
up 
in 
tools 
the 
product 
of 
eight 
hours’ 
labor, 
of 
the 
value 
of 
four 
shillings. 
But 
during 
a 
day 
he 
adds 
to 
the 
raw 
material 
twelve 
hours’ 
labor, 
that 
is, 
a 
new 
value 
of 
six 
shillings. 
And 
now 
the 
balance 
sheet 
stands 
as 
follows: 
the 
yarn 
produced 
during 
a 
day 
has 
cost 
in 
all 
sixty 
hours’ 
labor, 
and 
has, 
therefore, 
a 
value 
of 
thirty 
shillings. 
The 
outlay 
of 
the 
capitalist 
amounted 
to 
twenty 
shillings 
for 
cotton, 
four 
shillings 
for 
wear 
and 
tear 
of 
tools, 
and 
three 
shillings 
for 
wages; 
in 
all, 
therefore, 
only 
twenty-seven 
shillings. 
There 
remains 
now 
a 
“surplus 
value” 
of 
three 
shillings. 


Surplus 
value, 
therefore, 
according 
to 
Marx, 
is 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
capitalist 
makes 
the 
laborer 
work 
for 
him 
a 
part 
of 
the 
day 
without 
paying 
him 
for 
it. 
In 
the 
laborer’s 
working 
day 
two 
portions 
may 
be 
distinguished. 
In 
thefirstpart—the 
“necessaryworking 
time”—theworkerproduces 
themeans 
necessary 
for 
his 
own 
support, 
or 
the 
value 
of 
those 
means; 
and 
for 
this 
part 
of 
his 
labor 
he 
receives 
an 
equivalent 
in 
wages. 
During 
the 
second 
part—the 
“surplus 
working 
time”—he 
is 
exploited, 
he 
produces 
“surplus 
value” 
without 
receiving 
any 
equivalent 
for 
it 
(I, 
239 
ff.). 
“All 
surplus 
value 
is 
in 
substancetheembodimentofunpaid 
workingtime” 
(I, 
585). 


The 
following 
definitions 
of 
the 
amount 
of 
surplus 
value 
are 
very 
important 
and 
very 
characteristic 
of 
the 
Marxian 
system. 
The 
amount 
of 
surplus 
value 
may 
be 
brought 
into 
relation 
with 
various 
other 
amounts. 
The 
different 
proportions 
and 
proportionate 
numbers 
which 
arise 
out 
of 
this 
must 
beclearlydistinguished. 


First 
of 
all 
there 
are 
two 
elements 
to 
be 
distinguished 
in 
the 
capital 
which 
enables 
the 
capitalist 
to 
appropriate 
surplus 
values, 
each 
of 
which 
elements 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
origin 
of 
surplus 
value 
plays 
an 
entirely 
different 
part 
from 
the 
other. 
Really 
new 
surplus 
value 
can 
only 
be 
created 
by 
the 
living 
work 
which 



the 
capitalist 
gets 
the 
worker 
to 
perform. 
The 
value 
of 
the 
means 
of 
production 
which 
are 
used 
is 
maintained, 
and 
it 
reappears 
in 
a 
different 
form 
in 
the 
value 
of 
the 
product, 
but 
adds 
no 
surplus 
value. 
“That 
part 
of 
the 
capital, 
therefore, 
which 
is 
converted 
into 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
that 
is, 
into 
raw 
material, 
auxiliary 
material, 
and 
implements 
of 
labor, 
does 
not 
alter 
the 
amount 
of 
its 
value 
in 
the 
process 
of 
production,” 
for 
which 
reason 
Marx 
calls 
it 
“constant 
capital.” 
“On 
the 
other 
hand, 
that 
part 
of 
capital 
which 
is 
converted 
into 
labor 
power 
does 
alter 
its 
value 
in 
the 
process 
of 
production. 
It 
reproduces 
its 
own 
equivalent 
and 
a 
surplus 
in 
addition,” 
the 
surplus 
value. 
Therefore 
Marx 
calls 
it 
the 
“variable 
part 
of 
capital” 
or 
“variable 
capital” 
(I, 
233). 
Now 
the 
proportion 
in 
which 
the 
surplus 
value 
stands 
to 
the 
advanced 
variable 
part 
of 
capital 
(in 
which 
alone 
the 
surplus 
value 
“makes 
good 
its 
value”)Marxcallsthe 
rate 
of 
surplus 
value. 
It 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
proportion 
in 
which 
the 
surplus 
working 
time 
stands 
to 
the 
necessary 
working 
time, 
or 
the 
unpaid 
labor 
to 
the 
paid, 
and 
serves 
Marx, 
therefore, 
as 
an 
exact 
expression 
for 
the 
degree 
of 
exploitation 
of 
labor 
(I, 
241 
ff.). 
If, 
for 
instance, 
the 
working 
time 
necessary 
for 
the 
worker 
to 
produce 
the 
value 
of 
his 
day’s 
wages 
of 
three 
shillings 
amounts 
to 
six 
hours, 
while 
the 
actual 
number 
of 
hours 
he 
works 
in 
the 
day 
amounts 
to 
twelve, 
so 
that 
during 
the 
second 
six 
hours, 
which 
is 
surplus 
working 
time, 
he 
produces 
another 
value 
of 
three 
shillings, 
which 
is 
surplus 
value, 
then 
the 
surplus 
value 
is 
exactly 
equal 
to 
the 
amount 
of 
variable 
capital 
paid 
in 
wages, 
and 
the 
rate 
of 
the 
surplus 
value 
is 
reckonedat 
100percent. 


Totally 
different 
from 
this 
is 
the 
rate 
of 
profit. 
The 
capitalist 
calculates 
the 
surplus 
value, 
which 
he 
appropriates, 
not 
only 
upon 
the 
variable 
capital 
but 
upon 
the 
total 
amount 
of 
capital 
employed. 
For 
instance, 
if 
the 
constant 
capital 
be 
£410, 
the 
variable 
capital 
£90, 
and 
the 
surplus 
value 
also 
£90, 
the 
rate 
of 
surplus 
value 
will 
be, 
as 
in 
the 
case 
just 
given, 
100 
percent, 
but 
the 
rate 
of 
profit 
only 
18 
percent, 
that 
is, 
£90 
profit 
on 
an 
invested 
capital 
of 
£500. 


It 
is 
evident, 
further, 
that 
one 
and 
the 
same 
rate 
of 
surplus 
value 
can 
and 
must 
present 
itself 
in 
very 
different 
rates 
of 
profit 
according 
to 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
capital 
concerned: 
the 
greater 
the 
variable 
and 
the 
less 
the 
constant 
capital 
employed 
(which 
latter 
does 
not 
contribute 
to 
the 
formation 
of 
surplus 
value, 
but 
increases 
the 
fund, 
in 
relation 
to 
which 
the 
surplus 
value, 
determined 
only 
by 
the 
variable 
part 
of 
capital, 
is 
reckoned 
as 
profit) 
the 
higher 
will 
be 
the 
rate 
of 
profit. 
For 
example, 
if 
(which 
is 
indeed 
almost 
a 



practical 
impossibility) 
the 
constant 
capital 
is 
nothing 
and 
the 
variable 
capital 
is 
£50, 
and 
the 
surplus 
value, 
on 
the 
assumption 
just 
made, 
amounts 
to 
100 
percent, 
the 
surplus 
value 
acquired 
amounts 
also 
to 
£50; 
and 
as 
this 
is 
reckoned 
on 
a 
total 
capital 
of 
only 
£50, 
the 
rate 
of 
profit 
would 
in 
this 
case 
also 
be 
fully 
100 
percent. 
If, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
total 
capital 
is 
composed 
of 
constant 
and 
variable 
capital 
in 
the 
proportion 
of 
4 
to 
1; 
or, 
in 
other 
words, 
if 
to 
a 
variable 
capital 
of 
£50 
is 
added 
a 
constant 
capital 
of 
£200, 
the 
surplus 
value 
of 
£50, 
formed 
by 
the 
surplus 
value 
rate 
of 
100 
percent, 
has 
to 
be 
distributed 
on 
a 
capital 
of 
£2 
50, 
and 
on 
this 
it 
represents 
only 
a 
profit 
rate 
of 
20 
percent. 
Finally, 
if 
the 
capital 
were 
composed 
in 
the 
proportions 
of 
9 
to 
1, 
that 
is 
£450 
of 
constant 
to 
£50 
of 
variable 
capital, 
a 
surplus 
value 
of 
£50 
would 
be 
related 
to 
a 
total 
capital 
of 
£500, 
and 
the 
rate 
of 
profit 
would 
be 
only10 
percent. 


Now 
this 
leads 
to 
an 
extremely 
interesting 
and 
important 
result, 
in 
pursuing 
which 
we

THE 
THEORY 
OF 
THE 
AVERAGE 
RATE 
OF 
PROFIT 
AND 
OF 
THE 
PRICE 
OF 
PRODUCTION 


THAT 
resultisas 
follows:The 
“organiccomposition” 
(III,172)ofthecapital 
is 
for 
technical 
reasons 
necessarily-different 
in 
the 
different 
“spheres 
of 
production.” 
In 
various 
industries 
which 
demand 
very 
different 
technical 
manipulations, 
the 
quantity 
of 
raw 
material 
worked 
up 
on 
one 
working 
day 
is 



very 
different; 
or, 
even, 
when 
the 
manipulations 
are 
the 
same 
and 
the 
quantity 
of 
raw 
material 
worked 
up 
is 
nearly 
equal, 
the 
value 
of 
that 
material 
may 
differ 
very 
much, 
as, 
for 
instance 
in 
the 
case 
of 
copper 
and 
iron 
as 
raw 
materials 
of 
the 
metal 
industry; 
or 
finally 
the 
amount 
and 
value 
of 
the 
whole 
industrial 
apparatus, 
tools, 
and 
machinery, 
which 
are 
utilized 
by 
each 
worker 
employed, 
may 
be 
different. 
All 
these 
elements 
of 
difference 
when 
they 
do 
not 
exactly 
balance 
each 
other, 
as 
they 
seldom 
do, 
create 
in 
the 
different 
branches 
of 
production 
a 
different 
proportion 
between 
the 
constant 
capital 
invested 
in 
the 
means 
of 
production 
and 
the 
variable 
capital 
expended 
in 
the 
purchase 
of 
labor. 
Every 
branch 
of 
economic 
production 
needs 
consequently 
a 
special, 
a 
peculiar 
“organic 
composition” 
for 
the 
capital 
invested 
in 
it. 
According 
to 
the 
preceding 
argument, 
therefore, 
given 
an 
equal 
rate 
of 
surplus 
value, 
every 
branch 
of 
production 
must 
show 
a 
different, 
a 
special 
rate 
of 
profit, 
on 
the 
condition 
certainly, 
which 
Marx 
has 
hitherto 
always 
assumed, 
that 
commodities 
exchange 
with 
each 
other 
“according 
to 
their 
values,” 
or 
inproportiontotheworkembodiedin 
them. 


And 
here 
Marx 
arrives 
at 
the 
famous 
rock 
of 
offense 
in 
his 
theory, 
so 
hard 
to 
steer 
past 
that 
it 
has 
formed 
the 
most 
important 
point 
of 
dispute 
in 
the 
Marxian 
literature 
of 
the 
last 
ten 
years. 
His 
theory 
demands 
that 
capitals 
of 
equal 
amount, 
but 
of 
dissimilar 
organic 
composition, 
should 
exhibit 
different 
profits. 
The 
real 
world, 
however, 
most 
plainly 
shows 
that 
it 
is 
governed 
by 
the 
law 
that 
capitals 
of 
equal 
amount, 
without 
regard 
to 
possible 
differences 
of 
organic 
composition, 
yield 
equal 
profits. 
We 
will 
let 
Marx 
explain 
this 
contradictioninhisownwords. 


“We 
havethusshown 
that 
in 
differentbranchesof 
industry 
varying 
rates 
of 
profit 
are 
obtained 
according 
to 
the 
differences 
in 
the 
organic 
composition 
of 
the 
capitals, 
and 
also, 
within 
given 
limits, 
according 
to 
their 
periods 
of 
turnover; 
and 
that, 
therefore, 
even 
with 
equal 
rates 
of 
surplus 
value, 
there 
is 
a 
law 
(or 
general 
tendency), 
although 
only 
for 
capitals 
possessing 
the 
same 
organic 
composition—the 
same 
periods 
of 
turnover 
being 
assumed—that 
the 
profits 
are 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
amounts 
of 
the 
capitals, 
and 
therefore 
equal 
amounts 
of 
capital 
yield 
in 
equal 
periods 
of 
time 
equal 
amounts 
of 
profit. 
The 
argument 
rests 
on 
the 
basis 
which 
has 
hitherto 
generally 
been 
the 
basis 
of 
our 
reasoning, 
that 
commodities 
are 
sold 
according 
to 
their 
values. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
that, 
in 
reality, 
not 
reckoning 
unessential, 
accidental, 
and 
self-compensating 
differences, 
the 
difference 
in 
the 
average 
rate 
of 
profit 
for 
different 
branches 
of 
industry 
does 
not 
exist 
and 
could 
not 
exist 
without 



upsetting 
the 
whole 
system 
of 
capitalist 
production. 
It 
appears 
therefore 
that 
here 
the 
theory 
of 
value 
is 
irreconcilable 
with 
the 
actual 
movement 
of 
things, 
irreconcilable 
with 
the 
actual 
phenomena 
of 
production, 
and 
that, 
on 
this 
account, 
the 
attempt 
to 
understand 
the 
latter 
must 
be 
given 
up” 
(III, 
181). 
Howdoes 
Marx 
himselftrytosolvethis 
contradiction? 


To 
speak 
plainly 
his 
solution 
is 
obtained 
at 
the 
cost 
of 
the 
assumption 
from 
which 
Marx 
has 
hitherto 
started, 
that 
commodities 
exchange 
according 
to 
their 
values. 
This 
assumption 
Marx 
now 
simply 
drops. 
Later 
on 
we 
shall 
form 
our 
critical 
judgment 
of 
the 
effect 
of 
this 
abandonment 
on 
the 
Marxian 
system. 
Meanwhile 
Iresume 
my 
summaryofthe 
Marxian 
argument, 
and 
give 
one 
of 
the 
tabular 
examples 
which 
Marx 
brings 
forward 
in 
support 
of 
his 
view. 


In 
this 
example 
he 
compares 
five 
different 
spheres 
of 
production, 
in 
each 
of 
which 
the 
capital 
employed 
is 
of 
different 
organic 
composition, 
and 
in 
making 
his 
comparison 
he 
keeps 
at 
first 
to 
the 
assumption 
which 
has 
been 
hitherto 
made, 
that 
commodities 
exchange 
according 
to 
their 
values. 
For 
the 
clear 
understanding 
of 
the 
following 
table, 
which 
gives 
the 
results 
of 
this 
assumption, 
it 
must 
be 
remarked 
that 
c 
denotes 
constant 
capital 
and 
v 
variable, 
and 
in 
order 
to 
do 
justice 
to 
the 
actual 
diversities 
of 
daily 
life, 
let 
us 
assume 
(with 
Marx) 
that 
the 
constant 
capitals 
employed 
are 
“worn 
out” 
in 
different 
lengths 
of 
time, 
so 
that 
only 
a 
portion, 
and 
that 
an 
unequal 
portion, 
of 
the 
constant 
capital 
in 
the 
different 
spheres 
of 
production 
is 
used 
up 
in 
the 
year. 
Naturally 
only 
the 
used-up 
portion 
of 
constant 
capital—the 
“used-up 
c”—goes 
into 
the 
value 
of 
the 
product, 
while 
the 
whole 
“employed 
c” 
is 
takenintoaccountin 
reckoning 
the 
rateofprofit. 


We 
see 
that 
this 
table 
shows, 
in 
the 
different 
spheres 
of 
production 
where 
the 
exploitation 
of 
labor 
has 
been 
the 
same, 
very 
different 
rates 
of 
profit, 
corresponding 
to 
the 
different 
organic 
composition 
of 
the 
capitals. 
But 
we 
can 
also 
look 
at 
the 
same 
facts 
and 
data 
from 
another 
point 
of 
view. 
“The 
aggregate 
sum 
of 
the 
capital 
employed 
in 
the 
five 
spheres 
is 
500; 
the 
aggregatesumof 
the 
surplusvalue 
producedisno; 
and 
theaggregate 
value 
of 
thecommodities 
producedis610. 
Ifweconsiderthe 
500 
as 
a 
single 
capital 
of 
which 
I 
to 
V 
form 
only 
different 
parts 
(just 
as 
in 
a 
cotton 
mill 
in 
the 
different 
departments, 
in 
the 
carding-room, 
the 
roving-room, 
the 
spinning-room, 
and 
the 
weaving-room, 
a 
different 
proportion 
of 
variable 
and 
constant 
capital 
exists 
and 
the 
average 
proportion 
must 
be 
calculated 
for 
the 
whole 
factory), 
then 
in 
the 
first 
place 
the 
average 
composition 
of 
the 
capital 
of 
500 
would 
be 



500 
= 
390c 
+ 
110V, 
or, 
in 
percentages, 
78c 
+ 
22V. 
Taking 
each 
of 
the 
capitals 
of 
100 
as 
being 
one 
fifth 
of 
the 
aggregate 
capital 
its 
composition 
would 
be 
this 
average 
one 
of 
78c 
+ 
22V; 
and 
likewise 
to 
every 
100 
would 
accrue 
as 
average 
surplus 
value 
22; 
therefore 
the 
average 
rate 
of 
profit 
would 
be 
22 
percent 
(III, 
183-184). 
Now 
at 
what 
price 
must 
the 
separate 
commodities 
be 
sold 
in 
order 
that 
each 
of 
the 
five 
portions 
of 
capital 
should 
actually 
obtain 
this 
average 
rate 
of 
profit? 
The 
following 
table 
shows 
this. 
In 
it 
has 
been 
inserted 
the 
heading 
“Cost 
Price,” 
by 
which 
Marx 
understands 
that 
part 
of 
the 
value 
of 
commodities 
which 
makes 
good 
to 
the 
capitalists 
the 
price 
of 
the 
consumed 
means 
of 
production 
and 
the 
price 
of 
the 
labor 
power 
employed, 
but 
yet 
does 
not 
contain 
any 
surplus 
value 
or 
profit, 
so 
that 
its 
amountis 
equaltov 
+used-upc. 



“Taken 
together,” 
comments 
Marx 
on 
the 
results 
of 
this 
table, 
“the 
commodities 
are 
sold 
24-7 
+ 
17 
= 
26 
over 
their 
value, 
and 
8 
+ 
18 
under 
their 
value, 
so 
that 
the 
variations 
in 
price 
mutually 
cancel 
each 
other, 
either 
through 
an 
equal 
division 
of 
the 
surplus 
value 
or 
by 
cutting 
down 
the 
average 
profit 
of 
22 
percent 
on 
the 
invested 
capital 
to 
the 
respective 
cost 
prices 
of 
the 
commodities, 
I 
to 
V; 
in 
the 
same 
proportion 
in 
which 
one 
part 
of 
the 
commodities 
is 
sold 
over 
its 
value 
another 
part 
will 
be 
sold 
under 
its 
value. 
And 
now 
their 
sale 
at 
such 
prices 
makes 
it 
possible 
that 
the 
rate 
of 
profit 
for 
I 
to 
V 
should 
be 
equal, 
22 
percent, 
without 
regard 
to 
the 
different 
organic 
compositionofthecapitalIto 
V” 
(III, 
185). 



Marx 
goes 
on 
to 
say 
that 
all 
this 
is 
not 
a 
mere 
hypothetical 
assumption, 
but 
absolute 
fact. 
The 
operating 
agent 
is 
competition. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
owing 
to 
the 
different 
organic 
composition 
of 
the 
capitals 
invested 
in 
various 
branches 
of 
production 
“the 
rates 
of 
profit 
which 
obtain 
in 
these 
different 
branches 
are 
originally 
very 
different.” 
But 
“these 
different 
rates 
of 
profit 
are 
reduced 
by 
competitiontoa 
common 
rate 
which 
is 
the 
averageof 
all 
these 
different 
rates. 
The 
profit 
corresponding 
to 
this 
common 
rate, 
which 
falls 
to 
a 
given 
amount 
of 
capital, 
whatever 
its 
organic 
composition 
may 
be, 
is 
called 
average 
profit. 
That 
price 
of 
a 
commodity 
which 
is 
equal 
to 
its 
cost 
price 
plus 
its 
share 
of 
the 
yearly 
average 
profit 
of 
the 
capital 
employed 
(not 
merely 
that 
consumed) 
in 
its 
production 
(regard 
being 
had 
to 
the 
quickness 
or 
slowness 
of 
turnover) 
is 
its 
price 
of 
production” 
(III, 
186). 
This 
is 
in 
factidentical 
with 
Adam 
Smith’s 
natural 
price, 
with 
Ricardo’s 
price 
of 
production, 
and 
withthe 
prix 
necessaire 
of 
the 
physiocrats 
(III, 
233). 
And 
the 
actual 
exchange 
relation 
of 
the 
separate 
commodities 
is 
no 
longer 
determined 
by 
their 
values 
but 
by 
their 
prices 
of 
production; 
or 
as 
Marx 
likes 
to 
put 
it 
“the 
values 
change 
into 
prices 
of 
production” 
(III, 
231). 
Value 
and 
price 
of 
production 
are 
only 
exceptionally 
and 
accidentally 
coincident, 
namely, 
in 
those 
commodities 
which 
are 
produced 
by 
the 
aid 
of 
a 
capital, 
the 
organic 
composition 
of 
which 
chances 
to 
coincide 
exactly 
with 
the 
average 
composition 
of 
the 
whole 
social 
capital. 
In 
all 
other 
cases 
value 
and 
production 
price 
necessarily 
and 
in 
principle 
part 
company. 
And 
his 
meaning 
is 
as 
follows: 
According 
to 
Marx 
we 
call 
“capitals 
which 
contain 
a 
greater 
percentage 
of 
constant, 
and 
therefore 
a 
smaller 
percentage 
of 
variable 
capital 
than 
the 
social 
average 
capital, 
capitals 
of 
higher 
composition; 
and 
contrariwise 
those 
capitals 
in 
which 
the 
constant 
capital 
fills 
a 
relatively 
smaller, 
and 
the 
variable 
a 
relatively 
larger 
space 
than 
in 
the 
social 
average 
capital 
are 
called 
capitals 
of 
lower 
composition.” 
So 
in 
all 
those 
commodities 
which 
have 
been 
created 
by 
the 
aid 
of 
capital 
of 



“higher” 
composition 
than 
the 
average 
composition 
the 
price 
of 
production 
will 
be 
above 
their 
value, 
and 
in 
the 
opposite 
case 
it 
will 
be 
under 
the 
value. 
Or, 
commodities 
of 
the 
first 
kind 
will 
be 
necessarily 
and 
regularly 
sold 
over 
their 
value 
and 
commodities 
of 
the 
second 
kind 
under 
their 
value 
(III, 
193 
ff. 
and 
often 
elsewhere). 


The 
relation 
of 
the 
individual 
capitalists 
to 
the 
total 
surplus 
value 
created 
and 
appropriated 
in 
the 
whole 
society 
is 
finally 
illustrated 
in 
the 
following 
manner: 
“Although 
the 
capitalists 
of 
the 
different 
spheres 
of 
production 
in 
selling 
their 
commodities 
get 
back 
the 
value 
of 
the 
capital 
used 
up 
in 
the 
production 
of 
these 
commodities, 
they 
do 
not 
thereby 
recover 
the 
surplus 
value, 
and 
therefore 
profit, 
created 
in 
their 
own 
particular 
spheres, 
by 
the 
production 
of 
these 
commodities, 
but 
only 
so 
much 
surplus 
value, 
and 
therefore 
profit, 
as 
falls 
by 
an 
equal 
division 
to 
every 
aliquot 
part 
of 
the 
whole 
capital, 
from 
the 
total 
surplus 
value 
or 
total 
profit 
which 
the 
entire 
capital 
of 
society 
has 
created 
in 
a 
given 
time, 
in 
all 
the 
spheres 
of 
production 
taken 
together. 
Every 
100 
of 
invested 
capital, 
whatever 
its 
composition, 
secures 
in 
every 
year, 
or 
other 
period 
of 
time, 
the 
profit 
which, 
for 
this 
period, 
falls 
due 
to 
a 
100 
as 
a 
given 
part 
of 
the 
total 
capital. 
So 
far 
as 
profit 
is 
concerned, 
the 
different 
capitalists 
are 
in 
the 
position 
of 
simple 
members 
of 
a 
joint 
stock 
company, 
in 
which 
the 
profits 
are 
divided 
into 
equal 
shares 
on 
every 
100, 
and 
therefore 
for 
the 
different 
capitalists 
vary 
only 
according 
to 
the 
amount 
of 
capital 
invested 
by 
each 
in 
the 
common 
undertaking, 
according 
to 
the 
relative 
extent 
of 
his 
participation 
in 
the 
common 
business, 
according 
to 
the 
number 
of 
his 
shares” 
(III, 
186 
ff.). 
Total 
profit 
and 
total 
surplus 
value 
are 
identical 
amounts 
(III, 
204). 
And 
the 
average 
profit 
is 
nothing 
else 
“than 
the 
total 
amount 
of 
surplus 
value 
divided 
among 
the 
amounts 
of 
capital 
in 
everysphereof 
productionin 
proportiontotheirquantities” 
(III,205). 


An 
important 
consequence 
arising 
from 
this 
is 
that 
the 
profit 
which 
the 
individual 
capitalist 
draws 
is 
clearly 
shown 
to 
arise 
not 
only 
from 
the 
work 
performed 
by 
himself 
(III, 
201), 
but 
often 
proceeds 
for 
the 
most 
part, 
and 
sometimes 
entirely 
(for 
example, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
mercantile 
capital), 
from 
laborers 
with 
whom 
the 
capitalist 
concerned 
has 
no 
connection 
whatever. 
Marx, 
in 
conclusion, 
puts 
and 
answers 
one 
more 
question, 
which 
he 
regards 
as 
the 
specially 
difficult 
question: 
in 
what 
manner 
“does 
this 
adjustment 
of 
profits 
to 
a 
common 
rate 
of 
profit 
take 
place, 
since 
it 
is 
evidently 
a 
result 
and 
nota 
starting 
point?” 


He 
first 
of 
all 
puts 
forward 
the 
view 
that 
in 
a 
condition 
of 
society 
in 
which 



the 
capitalist 
system 
is 
not 
yet 
dominant, 
and 
in 
which, 
therefore, 
the 
laborers 
themselves 
are 
in 
possession 
of 
the 
necessary 
means 
of 
production, 
commodities 
are 
actually 
exchanged 
according 
to 
their 
real 
value, 
and 
the 
rates 
of 
profit 
could 
not 
therefore 
be 
equalized. 
But 
as 
the 
laborers 
could 
always 
obtain 
and 
keep 
for 
themselves 
an 
equal 
surplus 
value 
for 
an 
equal 
working 
time—that 
is, 
an 
equal 
value 
over 
and 
above 
their 
necessary 
wants 
—the 
actually 
existing 
difference 
in 
the 
profit 
rate 
would 
be 
“a 
matter 
of 
indifference, 
just 
as 
today 
it 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
indifference 
to 
the 
hired 
laborer 
by 
what 
rate 
of 
profit 
the 
amount 
of 
surplus 
value 
squeezed 
out 
of 
him 
is 
represented” 
(III, 
208). 
Now 
as 
such 
conditions 
of 
life 
in 
which 
the 
means 
of 
production 
belong 
to 
the 
worker 
are 
historically 
the 
earlier, 
and 
are 
found 
in 
the 
old 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
modern 
world, 
with 
peasant 
proprietors, 
for 
instance, 
and 
artisans, 
Marx 
thinks 
he 
is 
entitled 
to 
assert 
that 
it 
is 
“quite 
in 
accordance 
with 
facts 
to 
regard 
the 
values 
of 
commodities 
as, 
not 
only 
theoretically 
but 
also 
historically,priorto 
thepricesofproduction” 
(111,209). 


In 
societies 
organized 
on 
the 
capitalist 
system, 
however, 
this 
changing 
of 
values 
into 
prices 
of 
production 
and 
the 
equalization 
of 
the 
rates 
of 
profit 
which 
follows 
certainly 
do 
take 
place. 
There 
are 
some 
long 
preliminary 
discussions, 
in 
which 
Marx 
treats 
of 
the 
formation 
of 
market 
value 
and 
market 
price 
with 
special 
reference 
to 
the 
production 
of 
separate 
parts 
of 
commodities 
produced 
for 
sale 
under 
conditions 
of 
varying 
advantage. 
And 
then 
he 
expresses 
himself 
as 
follows 
very 
clearly 
and 
concisely 
on 
the 
motive 
forces 
of 
this 
process 
of 
equalization 
and 
on 
its 
mode 
of 
action: 
“If 
commodities 
are 
… 
sold 
according 
to 
their 
values 
… 
very 
different 
rates 
of 
profit 
are 
obtained…. 
Capital 
withdraws 
itself, 
however, 
from 
a 
sphere 
with 
a 
low 
rate 
of 
profit, 
and 
throws 
itself 
into 
another 
which 
yields 
a 
higher 
profit. 
Bythiscontinualinterchange,or,inaword,by 
itsapportionmentbetweenthe 
different 
spheres, 
as 
the 
rate 
of 
profit 
sinks 
here 
and 
rises 
there, 
such 
a 
relation 
of 
supply 
to 
demand 
is 
created 
as 
to 
make 
the 
average 
profit 
in 
the 
different 
spheres 
of 
production 
the 
same, 
and 
thus 
values 
are 
changed 
into 
prices 
ofproduction” 
(III,230).1

THE 
QUESTION 
OF 
THE 
CONTRADICTION 


MANY 
years 
ago, 
long 
before 
the 
above-mentioned 
prize 
essays 
on 
the 
compatibility 
of 
an 
equal 
average 
rate 
of 
profit 
with 
the 
Marxian 
law 
of 
value 
had 
appeared, 
the 
present 
writer 
had 
expressed 
his 
opinion 
on 
this 
subject 
in 
the 
following 
words: 
“Either 
products 
do 
actually 
exchange 
in 
the 
long 
run 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
labor 
attaching 
to 
them—in 
which 
case 
an 
equalization 
of 


the 
gains 
of 
capital 
is 
impossible; 
or 
there 
is 
an 
equalization 
of 
the 
gains 
of 
capital—in 
which 
case 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
products 
should 
continue 
to 
exchangein 
proportionto 
the 
labor 
attachingtothem.”1 


From 
the 
Marxian 
camp 
the 
actual 
incompatibility 
of 
these 
two 
propositions 
was 
first 
acknowledged 
a 
few 
years 
ago 
by 
Conrad 
Schmidt.2 
Now 
we 
have 
the 
authoritative 
confirmation 
of 
the 
master 
himself. 
He 
has 
stated 
concisely 
and 
precisely 
that 
an 
equal 
rate 
of 
profit 
is 
only 
possible 
when 
the 
conditions 
of 
sale 
are 
such 
that 
some 
commodities 
are 
sold 
above 
their 
value, 
and 
others 
under 
their 
value, 
and 
thus 
are 
not 
exchanged 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
labor 
embodied 
in 
them. 
And 
neither 
has 
he 
left 
us 
in 
doubt 
as 
to 
which 
of 
the 
two 
irreconcilable 
propositions 
conforms 
in 
his 
opinion 
to 
the 
actual 
facts. 
He 
teaches, 
with 
a 
clearness 
and 
directness 
which 
merit 
our 
gratitude, 
that 
it 
is 
the 
equalization 
of 
the 
gains 
of 
capital. 
And 
he 
even 
goes 
so 
far 
as 
to 
say, 
with 
the 
same 
directness 
and 
clearness, 
that 
the 
several 
commodities 
do 
not 
actually 
exchange 
with 
each 
other 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
labor 
they 
contain, 
but 
that 
they 
exchange 
in 
that 
varying 
proportion 
to 
the 
laborwhich 
isrendered 
necessary 
bythe 
equalizationofthe 
gains 
ofcapital. 


In 
what 
relation 
does 
this 
doctrine 
of 
the 
third 
volume 
stand 
to 
the 
celebrated 
lawof 
valueof 
the 
firstvolume? 
Does 
itcontainthesolutionofthe 
seeming 
contradiction 
looked 
for 
with 
so 
much 
anxiety? 
Does 
it 
prove 
“how 
not 
only 
without 
contradicting 
the 
law 
of 
value, 
but 
even 
by 
virtue 
of 
it, 
an 
equal 
average 
rate 
of 
profit 
can 
and 
must 
be 
created”? 
Does 
it 
not 
rather 
contain 
the 
exact 
opposite 
of 
such 
a 
proof, 
namely, 
the 
statement 
of 
an 
actual 
irreconcilable 
contradiction, 
and 
does 
it 
not 
prove 
that 
the 
equal 
average 
rate 
of 
profit 
can 
only 
manifest 
itself 
if, 
and 
because, 
the 
alleged 
law 
of 
value 



doesnothold 
good? 


I 
do 
not 
think 
that 
any 
one 
who 
examines 
the 
matter 
impartially 
and 
soberly 
can 
remain 
long 
in 
doubt. 
In 
the 
first 
volume 
it 
was 
maintained, 
with 
the 
greatest 
emphasis, 
that 
all 
value 
is 
based 
on 
labor 
and 
labor 
alone, 
and 
that 
values 
of 
commodities 
were 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
working 
time 
necessary 
for 
their 
production. 
These 
propositions 
were 
deduced 
and 
distilled 
directly 
and 
exclusively 
from 
the 
exchange 
relations 
of 
commodities 
in 
which 
they 
were 
“immanent.” 
We 
were 
directed 
“to 
start 
from 
the 
exchange 
value, 
and 
exchange 
relation 
of 
commodities, 
in 
order 
to 
come 
upon 
the 
track 
of 
the 
value 
concealed 
in 
them” 
(I, 
55). 
The 
value 
was 
declared 
to 
be 
“the 
common 
factor 
which 
appears 
in 
the 
exchange 
relation 
of 
commodities” 
(I, 
45). 
We 
were 
told, 
in 
the 
form 
and 
with 
the 
emphasis 
of 
a 
stringent 
syllogistic 
conclusion, 
allowing 
of 
no 
exception, 
that 
to 
set 
down 
two 
commodities 
as 
equivalents 
in 
exchange 
implied 
that 
“a 
common 
factor 
of 
the 
same 
magnitude” 
existed 
in 
both, 
to 
which 
each 
of 
the 
two 
“must 
be 
reducible” 
(I, 
43). 
Apart, 
therefore, 
from 
temporary 
and 
occasional 
variations 
which 
“appear 
to 
be 
a 
breach 
of 
the 
law 
of 
the 
exchange 
of 
commodities” 
(I, 
177), 
commodities 
which 
embody 
the 
same 
amount 
of 
labor 
must 
on 
principle, 
in 
the 
long 
run, 
exchange 
for 
each 
other. 
And 
now 
in 
the 
third 
volume 
we 
are 
told 
briefly 
and 
dryly 
that 
what, 
according 
to 
the 
teaching 
of 
the 
first 
volume, 
must 
be, 
is 
not 
and 
never 
can 
be; 
that 
individual 
commodities 
do 
and 
must 
exchange 
with 
each 
other 
in 
a 
proportion 
different 
from 
that 
of 
the 
labor 
incorporated 
in 
them, 
and 
this 
not 
accidentally 
and 
temporarily, 
but 
of 
necessityandpermanently. 


I 
cannot 
help 
myself; 
I 
see 
here 
no 
explanation 
and 
reconciliation 
of 
a 
contradiction, 
but 
the 
bare 
contradiction 
itself. 
Marx’s 
third 
volume 
contradicts 
the 
first. 
The 
theory 
of 
the 
average 
rate 
of 
profit 
and 
of 
the 
prices 
of 
production 
cannot 
be 
reconciled 
with 
the 
theory 
of 
value. 
This 
is 
the 
impression 
which 
must, 
I 
believe,be 
received 
by 
every 
logical 
thinker. 
And 
it 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
very 
generally 
accepted. 
Loria, 
in 
his 
lively 
and 
picturesque 
style, 
states 
that 
he 
feels 
himself 
forced 
to 
the 
“harsh 
but 
just 
judgment” 
thatMarx 
“instead 
of 
asolution 
has 
presented 
a 
mystification.” 
He 
sees 
in 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
third 
volume 
“the 
Russian 
campaign” 
of 
the 
Marxian 
system, 
its 
“complete 
theoretical 
bankruptcy,” 
a 
“scientific 
suicide,” 
the 
“most 
explicit 
surrender 
of 
his 
own 
teaching” 
(l’abdicazione 
più 
esplicita 
alla 
dottrina 
stessa), 
and 
the 
“full 
and 
complete 
adherence 
to 
the 
most 
orthodox 
doctrineofthehatedeconomists.”1 



And 
even 
a 
man 
who 
is 
so 
close 
to 
the 
Marxian 
system 
as 
Werner 
Sombart 
says 
that 
a 
“general 
head 
shaking” 
best 
represents 
the 
probable 
effect 
produced 
on 
most 
readers 
by 
the 
third 
volume. 
“Most 
of 
them,” 
he 
says, 
“will 
not 
be 
inclined 
to 
regard 
‘the 
solution’ 
of 
‘the 
puzzle 
of 
the 
average 
rate 
of 
profit’ 
as 
a 
‘solution’; 
they 
will 
think 
that 
the 
knot 
has 
been 
cut, 
and 
by 
no 
means 
untied. 
For, 
when 
suddenly 
out 
of 
the 
depths 
emerges 
a 
‘quite 
ordinary’ 
theory 
ofcost 
ofproduction,itmeansthatthecelebrateddoctrineof 
value 
has 
come 
to 
grief. 
For, 
if 
I 
have 
in 
the 
end 
to 
explain 
the 
profits 
by 
the 
cost 
of 
production, 
wherefore 
the 
whole 
cumbrous 
apparatus 
of 
the 
theories 
of 
value 
and 
surplus 
value?”1 
Sombart 
certainly 
reserves 
to 
himself 
another 
judgment. 
He 
attempts 
to 
save 
the 
theory 
in 
a 
way 
of 
his 
own, 
in 
which, 
however, 
so 
much 
of 
it 
is 
thrown 
overboard 
that 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
very 
doubtful 
if 
his 
efforts 
have 
earned 
the 
gratitude 
of 
any 
person 
concerned 
in 
the 
matter. 
I 
shall 
later 
examine 
more 
closely 
this 
attempt, 
which 
is 
in 
any 
case 
interesting 
and 
instructive. 
But, 
before 
the 
posthumous 
apologist, 
we 
must 
give 
themaster 
himself 
the 
careful 
and 
attentive 
hearing 
which 
so 
important 
a 
subjectdeserves. 


Marx 
himself 
must, 
of 
course, 
have 
foreseen 
that 
his 
solution 
would 
incur 
the 
reproach 
of 
being 
no 
solution 
at 
all, 
but 
a 
surrender 
of 
his 
law 
of 
value. 
To 
this 
prevision 
is 
evidently 
due 
an 
anticipatory 
self-defense 
which, 
if 
not 
in 
form 
yet 
in 
point 
of 
fact, 
is 
found 
in 
the 
Marxian 
system; 
for 
Marx 
does 
not 
omit 
to 
interpolate 
in 
numerous 
places 
the 
express 
declaration 
that, 
in 
spite 
of 
exchange 
relations 
being 
directly 
governed 
by 
prices 
of 
production, 
which 
differ 
from 
the 
values, 
all 
is 
nevertheless 
moving 
within 
the 
lines 
of 
the 
law 
of 
value 
and 
this 
law, 
“in 
the 
last 
resort” 
at 
least, 
governs 
prices. 
He 
tries 
to 
make 
this 
view 
plausible 
by 
several 
inconsequent 
observations 
and 
explanations. 
On 
this 
subject 
he 
does 
not 
use 
his 
customary 
method 
of 
a 
formal 
close 
line 
of 
reasoning, 
but 
gives 
only 
a 
series 
of 
running, 
incidental 
remarks 
which 
contain 
different 
arguments, 
or 
turns 
of 
expression 
which 
may 
be 
interpreted 
as 
such. 
In 
this 
case 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
judge 
on 
which 
of 
these 
arguments 
Marx 
himself 
intended 
to 
place 
the 
greatest 
weight, 
or 
what 
was 
his 
conception 
of 
the 
reciprocal 
relations 
of 
these 
dissimilar 
arguments. 
However 
that 
may 
be, 
we 
must, 
in 
justice 
to 
the 
master 
as 
well 
as 
to 
our 
own 
critical 
problem, 
give 
each 
of 
these 
arguments 
the 
closest 
attention 
and 
impartialconsideration. 


The 
running 
remarks 
appear 
to 
me 
to 
contain 
the 
following 
four 
arguments 
infavorof 
apartlyorwholly 
permanentvalidityof 
thelawofvalue. 



First 
argument: 
even 
if 
the 
separate 
commodities 
are 
being 
sold 
either 
above 
or 
below 
their 
values, 
these 
reciprocal 
fluctuations 
cancel 
each 
other, 
and 
in 
the 
community 
itself—taking 
into 
account 
all 
the 
branches 
of 
production—the 
total 
of 
the 
prices 
of 
production 
of 
the 
commodities 
producedstillremains 
equal 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
their 
values 
(III,188). 


Second 
argument: 
the 
law 
of 
value 
governs 
the 
movement 
of 
prices, 
since 
the 
diminution 
or 
increase 
of 
the 
requisite 
working 
time 
makes 
the 
prices 
of 
production 
riseor 
fall(III,208,211). 


Third 
argument: 
the 
law 
of 
value, 
Marx 
affirms, 
governs 
with 
undiminished 
authority 
the 
exchange 
of 
commodities 
in 
certain 
“primary” 
stages, 
in 
which 
the 
change 
of 
values 
into 
prices 
of 
production 
has 
not 
yet 
beenaccomplished. 


Fourth 
argument: 
in 
a 
complicated 
economic 
system 
the 
law 
of 
value 
regulates 
the 
prices 
of 
production 
at 
least 
indirectly 
and 
in 
the 
last 
resort, 
since 
the 
total 
value 
of 
the 
commodities, 
determined 
by 
the 
law 
of 
value, 
determines 
the 
total 
surplus 
value. 
The 
latter, 
however, 
regulates 
the 
amount 
oftheaverageprofit,and 
thereforethegeneral 
rateofprofit(III,212). 


Let 
ustestthese 
arguments, 
eachone 
onitsown 
merits. 


FIRSTARGUMENT 


IT 
IS 
admitted 
by 
Marx 
that 
separate 
commodities 
exchange 
with 
each 
other 
either 
over 
or 
under 
their 
value 
according 
as 
the 
share 
of 
constant 
capital 
employed 
in 
their 
production 
is 
above 
or 
below 
the 
average. 
Stress 
is, 
however, 
laid 
on 
the 
fact 
that 
these 
individual 
deviations 
which 
take 
place 
in 
opposite 
directions 
compensate 
or 
cancel 
each 
other, 
so 
that 
the 
sum 
total 
of 
all 
prices 
paid 
corresponds 
exactly 
with 
the 
sum 
of 
all 
values. 
“In 
the 
same 
proportion 
in 
which 
one 
part 
of 
the 
commodities 
is 
sold 
above 
its 
value 
another 
part 
will 
be 
sold 
under 
its 
value” 
(III, 
185). 
“The 
aggregate 
price 
of 
the 
commodities 
I 
to 
V 
[in 
the 
table 
given 
by 
Marx 
as 
an 
example] 
would 
therefore 
be 
equal 
to 
their 
aggregate 
values, 
and 
would 
therefore 
be, 
in 
fact, 
a 
money 
expression 
of 
the 
aggregate 
amount 
of 
labor, 
both 
past 
and 
recent, 
contained 
in 
the 
commodities 
I 
to 
V. 
And 
in 
this 
way 
in 
the 
community 
itself 
—when 
we 
regard 
the 
total 
of 
all 
the 
branches 
of 
production—the 
sum 
of 
the 
prices 
of 
production 
of 
the 
commodities 
manufactured 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
their 
values” 
(III, 
188). 
From 
this, 
finally, 
the 
argument 
is 
more 
or 
less 
clearly 
deduced 
that 
at 
any 
rate 
for 
the 
sum 
of 
all 
commodities, 
or 
for 
the 



community 
as 
a 
whole, 
the 
law 
of 
value 
maintains 
its 
validity. 
“Meanwhile 
it 
resolves 
itself 
into 
this—that 
by 
as 
much 
as 
there 
is 
toomuch 
surplusvalue 
in 
one 
commodity 
there 
is 
too 
little 
in 
another, 
and 
therefore 
the 
deviations 
from 
value 
which 
lurk 
in 
the 
prices 
of 
production 
reciprocally 
cancel 
each 
other. 
In 
capitalist 
production 
as 
a 
whole 
‘the 
general 
law 
maintains 
itself 
as 
the 
governing 
tendency’ 
only 
in 
a 
very 
complex 
and 
approximate 
manner, 
as 
the 
constantlychangingaverageofperpetualfluctuations” 
(III,190). 


This 
argument 
is 
not 
new 
in 
Marxian 
literature. 
In 
similar 
circumstances 
it 
was 
maintained, 
a 
few 
years 
ago, 
by 
Conrad 
Schmidt, 
with 
great 
emphasis, 
and 
perhaps 
with 
even 
greater 
clearness 
of 
principle 
than 
now 
by 
Marx 
himself. 
In 
his 
attempt 
to 
solve 
the 
riddle 
of 
the 
average 
rate 
of 
profit 
Schmidt 
also, 
while 
he 
employed 
a 
different 
line 
of 
argument 
from 
Marx, 
arrived 
at 
the 
conclusion 
that 
separate 
commodities 
cannot 
exchange 
with 
each 
other 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
labor 
attaching 
to 
them. 
He 
too 
was 
obliged 
to 
ask 
the 
question 
whether, 
in 
face 
of 
this 
fact, 
the 
validity 
of 
Marx’s 
law 
of 
value 
could 
any 
longer 
be 
maintained, 
and 
he 
supported 
his 
affirmative 
opiniononthevery 
argument 
thathasjustbeengiven.1 


I 
hold 
the 
argument 
to 
be 
absolutely 
untenable. 
I 
maintained 
this 
at 
the 
time 
against 
Conrad 
Schmidt, 
and 
I 
have 
no 
occasion 
today 
in 
relation 
to 
Marx 
himself 
to 
make 
any 
alteration 
in 
the 
reasoning 
on 
which 
I 
founded 
my 
opinion 
then. 
I 
may 
content 
myself 
now 
with 
simply 
repeating 
it 
word 
for 
word. 
In 
opposing 
Conrad 
Schmidt, 
I 
asked 
how 
much 
or 
how 
little 
of 
the 
celebrated 
law 
of 
value 
remained 
after 
so 
much 
had 
practically 
been 
given 
up, 
and 
then 
continued: 
“That 
not 
much 
remains 
will 
be 
best 
shown 
by 
the 
efforts 
which 
the 
author 
makes 
to 
prove 
that, 
in 
spite 
of 
everything, 
the 
law 
of 
value 
maintains 
its 
validity. 
After 
he 
has 
admitted 
that 
the 
actual 
prices 
of 
commodities 
differ 
from 
their 
values, 
he 
remarks 
that 
this 
divergence 
only 
relates 
to 
those 
prices 
obtained 
by 
separate 
commodities, 
and 
that 
it 
disappears 
as 
soon 
as 
one 
considers 
the 
sum 
of 
all 
separate 
commodities, 
the 
yearly 
national 
produce, 
and 
that 
the 
total 
price 
which 
is 
paid 
for 
the 
whole 
national 
produce 
taken 
together 
does 
certainly 
coincide 
entirely 
with 
the 
amountofvalueactually 
embodied 
in 
it 
(p. 
51). 
I 
donot 
know 
whether 
Ishall 
be 
able 
to 
show 
sufficiently 
the 
bearings 
of 
this 
statement, 
but 
I 
shall 
at 
least 
attempttoindicatethem. 


“What 
then, 
we 
ask, 
is 
the 
chief 
object 
of 
the 
‘law 
of 
value’? 
It 
is 
nothing 
else 
than 
the 
elucidation 
of 
the 
exchange 
relations 
of 
commodities 
as 
they 
actually 
appear 
to 
us. 
We 
wish 
to 
know, 
for 
instance, 
why 
a 
coat 
should 
be 



worth 
as 
much 
in 
exchange 
as 
twenty 
yards 
of 
linen, 
and 
ten 
pounds 
of 
tea 
as 
much 
as 
half 
a 
ton 
of 
iron, 
etc. 
It 
is 
plain 
that 
Marx 
himself 
so 
conceives 
the 
explanatory 
object 
of 
the 
law 
of 
value. 
There 
can 
clearly 
only 
be 
a 
question 
of 
an 
exchange 
relation 
between 
different 
separate 
commodities 
among 
each 
other. 
As 
soon, 
however, 
as 
one 
looks 
at 
all 
commodities 
as 
a 
whole 
and 
sums 
up 
the 
prices, 
one 
must 
studiously 
and 
of 
necessity 
avoid 
looking 
at 
the 
relations 
existing 
inside 
of 
this 
whole. 
The 
internal 
relative 
differences 
of 
price 
do 
compensate 
each 
other 
in 
the 
sum 
total. 
For 
instance, 
what 
the 
tea 
is 
worth 
more 
than 
the 
iron 
the 
iron 
is 
worth 
less 
than 
the 
tea 
and 
vice 
versa. 
In 
any 
case, 
when 
we 
ask 
for 
information 
regarding 
the 
exchange 
of 
commodities 
in 
political 
economy 
it 
is 
no 
answer 
to 
our 
question 
to 
be 
told 
the 
total 
price 
which 
they 
bring 
when 
taken 
altogether, 
any 
more 
than 
if, 
on 
asking 
by 
how 
many 
fewer 
minutes 
the 
winner 
in 
a 
prize 
race 
had 
covered 
the 
course 
than 
his 
competitor, 
we 
were 
to 
be 
told 
that 
all 
the 
competitors 
together 
hadtakentwenty-fiveminutesandthirteen 
seconds. 


“The 
state 
of 
the 
case 
is 
this: 
to 
the 
question 
of 
the 
problem 
of 
value 
the 
followers 
of 
Marx 
reply 
first 
with 
their 
law 
of 
value, 
that 
commodities 
exchange 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
working 
time 
incorporated 
in 
them. 
Then 
they 
—covertly 
or 
openly—revoke 
this 
answer 
in 
its 
relation 
to 
the 
domain 
of 
the 
exchange 
of 
separate 
commodities, 
the 
one 
domain 
in 
which 
the 
problem 
has 
any 
meaning, 
and 
maintain 
it 
in 
full 
force 
only 
for 
the 
whole 
aggregate 
national 
produce, 
for 
a 
domain 
therefore 
in 
which 
the 
problem, 
being 
without 
object, 
could 
not 
have 
been 
put 
at 
all. 
As 
an 
answer 
to 
the 
strict 
question 
of 
the 
problem 
of 
value 
the 
law 
of 
value 
is 
avowedly 
contradicted 
by 
the 
facts, 
and 
in 
the 
only 
application 
in 
which 
it 
is 
not 
contradicted 
by 
them 
it 
is 
no 
longer 
an 
answer 
to 
the 
question 
which 
demanded 
a 
solution, 
but 
could 
at 
best 
onlybeananswer 
tosomeotherquestion. 


“It 
is, 
however, 
not 
even 
an 
answer 
to 
another 
question; 
it 
is 
no 
answer 
at 
all; 
it 
is 
simple 
tautology. 
For, 
as 
every 
economist 
knows, 
commodities 
do 
eventually 
exchange 
with 
commodities—when 
one 
penetrates 
the 
disguises 
due 
to 
the 
use 
of 
money. 
Every 
commodity 
which 
comes 
into 
exchange 
is 
at 
one 
and 
the 
same 
time 
a 
commodity 
and 
the 
price 
of 
what 
is 
given 
in 
exchange 
for 
it. 
The 
aggregate 
of 
commodities 
therefore 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
aggregate 
of 
the 
prices 
paid 
for 
them; 
or, 
the 
price 
of 
the 
whole 
national 
produce 
is 
nothing 
else 
than 
the 
national 
produce 
itself. 
Under 
these 
circumstances, 
therefore, 
it 
is 
quite 
true 
that 
the 
total 
price 
paid 
for 
the 
entire 
national 
produce 
coincides 
exactly 
with 
the 
total 
amount 
of 
value 
or 
labor 



incorporated 
in 
it. 
But 
this 
tautological 
declaration 
denotes 
no 
increase 
of 
true 
knowledge, 
neither 
does 
it 
serve 
as 
a 
special 
test 
of 
the 
correctness 
of 
the 
alleged 
law 
that 
commodities 
exchange 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
labor 
embodied 
in 
them. 
For 
in 
this 
manner 
one 
might 
as 
well, 
or 
rather 
as 
unjustly, 
verify 
any 
other 
law 
one 
pleased—the 
law, 
for 
instance, 
that 
commodities 
exchange 
according 
to 
the 
measure 
of 
their 
specific 
gravity. 
For 
if 
certainly 
as 
a 
‘separate 
ware’ 
one 
pound 
of 
gold 
does 
not 
exchange 
with 
one 
pound 
of 
iron, 
but 
with 
40,000 
pounds 
of 
iron; 
still, 
the 
total 
price 
paid 
for 
one 
pound 
of 
gold 
and 
40,000 
pounds 
of 
iron 
taken 
together 
is 
nothing 
more 
and 
nothing 
less 
than 
40,000 
pounds 
of 
iron 
and 
one 
pound 
of 
gold. 
The 
total 
weight, 
therefore, 
of 
the 
total 
price—40,001 
pounds—corresponds 
exactly 
to 
the 
like 
total 
weight 
of 
40,001 
pounds 
incorporated 
in 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
commodities. 
Is 
weight 
consequently 
the 
true 
standard 
by 
which 
the 
exchange 
relation 
of 
commodities 
isdetermined?” 


I 
have 
nothing 
to 
omit 
and 
nothing 
to 
add 
to 
this 
judgment 
in 
applying 
it 
now 
to 
Marx 
himself, 
except 
perhaps 
that 
in 
advancing 
the 
argument 
which 
has 
just 
been 
under 
criticism 
Marx 
is 
guilty 
of 
an 
additional 
error 
which 
cannot 
be 
charged 
against 
Schmidt. 
For, 
in 
the 
passage 
just 
quoted 
from 
page 
190 
of 
the 
third 
volume, 
Marx 
seeks, 
by 
a 
general 
dictum 
concerning 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
law 
of 
value 
operates, 
to 
gain 
approval 
for 
the 
idea 
that 
a 
certain 
real 
authority 
may 
still 
be 
ascribed 
to 
it, 
even 
if 
it 
does 
not 
rule 
in 
separate 
cases. 
After 
saying 
that 
the 
“deviations” 
from 
value, 
which 
are 
found 
in 
the 
prices 
of 
production, 
cancel 
each 
other, 
he 
adds 
the 
remark 
that 
“in 
capitalist 
production 
as 
a 
whole 
the 
general 
law 
maintains 
itself 
as 
the 
governing 
tendency, 
for 
the 
most 
part 
only 
in 
a 
very 
complex 
and 
approximate 
manner 
astheconstantlychanging 
average 
of 
perpetual 
fluctuations.” 


Here 
Marx 
confounds 
two 
very 
different 
things: 
an 
average 
of 
fluctuations, 
and 
an 
average 
between 
permanently 
and 
fundamentally 
unequal 
quantities. 
He 
is 
so 
far 
quite 
right, 
that 
many 
a 
general 
law 
holds 
good 
solely 
because 
an 
average 
resulting 
from 
constant 
fluctuations 
coincides 
with 
the 
rule 
declared 
by 
the 
law. 
Every 
economist 
knows 
such 
laws. 
Take, 
for 
example, 
the 
law 
that 
prices 
equal 
costs 
of 
production—that 
apart 
from 
special 
reasons 
for 
inequality 
there 
is 
a 
tendency 
for 
wages 
in 
different 
branches 
of 
industry, 
and 
for 
profits 
of 
capital 
in 
different 
branches 
of 
production, 
to 
come 
to 
a 
level, 
and 
every 
economist 
is 
inclined 
to 
acknowledge 
these 
laws 
as 
“laws,” 
although 
perhaps 
there 
may 
be 
no 
absolutely 
exact 
agreement 
with 
them 
in 
any 
single 
case; 
and 
therefore 
even 
the 
power 
to 
refer 
to 
a 
mode 
of 
action 



operating 
on 
the 
whole, 
and 
on 
the 
average, 
has 
a 
strongly 
captivating 
influence. 


But 
the 
case 
in 
favor 
of 
which 
Marx 
uses 
this 
captivating 
reference 
is 
of 
quite 
a 
different 
kind. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
prices 
of 
production 
which 
deviate 
from 
the 
“values,” 
it 
is 
not 
a 
question 
of 
fluctuations, 
but 
of 
necessary 
and 
permanent 
divergences. 


Two 
commodities, 
A 
and 
B, 
which 
contain 
the 
same 
amount 
of 
labor, 
but 
have 
been 
produced 
by 
capitals 
of 
different 
organic 
composition, 
do 
not 
fluctuate 
round 
the 
same 
average 
point, 
say, 
for 
example, 
the 
average 
of 
fifty 
shillings; 
but 
each 
of 
them 
assumes 
permanently 
a 
different 
level 
of 
price: 
for 
instance, 
the 
commodity 
A, 
in 
the 
production 
of 
which 
little 
constant 
capital, 
demanding 
but 
little 
interest, 
has 
been 
employed, 
the 
price 
level 
of 
forty 
shillings; 
and 
the 
commodity 
B, 
which 
has 
much 
constant 
capital 
to 
pay 
interest 
on, 
the 
price 
level 
of 
sixty 
shillings, 
allowance 
being 
made 
for 
fluctuation 
round 
each 
of 
these 
deviating 
levels. 
If 
we 
had 
only 
to 
deal 
with 
fluctuations 
round 
one 
and 
the 
same 
level, 
so 
that 
the 
commodity 
A 
might 
stand 
at 
one 
moment 
at 
forty-eight 
shillings 
and 
the 
commodity 
B 
at 
fifty-two 
shillings, 
and 
at 
another 
moment 
the 
case 
were 
reversed, 
and 
the 
commodity 
A 
stood 
at 
fifty-two 
shillings 
and 
the 
commodity 
B 
only 
reached 
forty-eight, 
then 
we 
might 
indeed 
say 
that 
in 
the 
average 
the 
price 
of 
both 
of 
these 
commodities 
was 
the 
same, 
and 
in 
such 
a 
state 
of 
things, 
if 
it 
were 
seen 
to 
obtain 
universally, 
one 
might 
find, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
fluctuations, 
a 
verification 
of 
the 
“law” 
that 
commodities 
embodying 
the 
same 
amount 
of 
labor 
exchangeonan 
equalfooting. 


When, 
however, 
of 
two 
commodities 
in 
which 
the 
same 
amount 
of 
labor 
is 
incorporated, 
one 
permanently 
and 
regularly 
maintains 
a 
price 
of 
forty 
shillings 
and 
the 
other 
as 
permanently 
and 
regularly 
the 
price 
of 
sixty 
shillings, 
a 
mathematician 
may 
indeed 
strike 
an 
average 
of 
fifty 
shillings 
between 
the 
two; 
but 
such 
an 
average 
has 
an 
entirely 
different 
meaning, 
or, 
to 
be 
more 
accurate, 
has 
no 
meaning 
at 
all 
with 
regard 
to 
our 
law. 
A 
mathematical 
average 
may 
always 
be 
struck 
between 
the 
most 
unequal 
quantities, 
and 
when 
it 
has 
once 
been 
struck 
the 
deviations 
from 
it 
on 
either 
side 
always 
“mutually 
cancel 
each 
other” 
according 
to 
their 
amount; 
by 
the 
same 
amount 
exactly 
by 
which 
the 
one 
exceeds 
the 
average 
the 
other 
must 
of 
necessity 
fall 
short. 
But 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
necessary 
and 
permanent 
differences 
of 
prices 
in 
commodities 
of 
the 
same 
cost 
in 
labor, 
but 
of 
unequal 
composition 
as 
regards 
capital, 
cannot 
by 
such 
playing 
with 
“average” 
and 



“deviations 
that 
cancel 
each 
other” 
be 
turned 
into 
a 
confirmation 
of 
the 
alleged 
law 
of 
value 
instead 
of 
a 
refutation. 
We 
might 
just 
as 
well 
try 
in 
this 
way 
to 
prove 
the 
proposition 
that 
animals 
of 
all 
kinds, 
elephants 
and 
May 
flies 
included, 
have 
the 
same 
length 
of 
life; 
for 
while 
it 
is 
true 
that 
elephants 
live 
on 
an 
average 
one 
hundred 
years 
and 
May 
flies 
only 
a 
single 
day, 
yet 
between 
these 
two 
quantities 
we 
can 
strike 
an 
average 
of 
fifty 
years. 
By 
as 
much 
time 
as 
the 
elephants 
live 
longer 
than 
the 
flies, 
the 
flies 
live 
shorter 
than 
the 
elephants. 
The 
deviations 
from 
this 
average 
“mutually 
cancel 
each 
other,” 
and 
consequently 
on 
the 
whole 
and 
on 
the 
average 
the 
law 
that 
all 
kindsofanimalshavethesamelengthoflifeisestablished! 


Let

SECONDARGUMENT 


IN 
VARIOUS 
PARTS 
of 
the 
third 
volume 
Marx 
claims 
for 
the 
law 
of 
value 
that 
it 
“governs 
the 
movement 
of 
prices,” 
and 
he 
considers 
that 
this 
is 
proved 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
where 
the 
working 
time 
necessary 
for 
the 
production 
of 
the 
commodities 
decreases, 
there 
also 
prices 
fall; 
and 
that 
where 
it 
increases 
prices 
alsorise,othercircumstancesremaining 
equal.1 


This 
conclusion 
also 
rests 
on 
an 
error 
of 
logic 
so 
obvious 
that 
one 
wonders 
Marx 
did 
not 
perceive 
it 
himself. 
That 
in 
the 
case 
of 
“other 
circumstances 
remaining 
equal” 
prices 
rise 
and 
fall 
according 
to 
the 
amount 
of 
labor 
expended 
proves 
clearly 
neither 
more 
nor 
less 
than 
that 
labor 
is 
one 
factor 
in 
determining 
prices. 
It 
proves, 
therefore, 
a 
fact 
upon 
which 
all 
the 
world 
is 
agreed, 
an 
opinion 
not 
peculiar 
to 
Marx, 
but 
one 
acknowledged 
and 
taught 
by 
the 
classical 
and 
“vulgar 
economists.” 
But 
by 
his 
law 
of 
value 
Marx 
had 
asserted 
much 
more. 
He 
had 
asserted 
that, 
barring 
occasional 
and 
momentary 
fluctuations 
of 
demand 
and 
supply, 
the 
labor 
expended 
was 
the 
sole 
factor 
which 
governed 
the 
exchange 
relations 
of 
commodities. 
Evidently 
it 
could 
only 
be 
maintained 
that 
this 
law 
governs 
the 
movement 
of 
prices 
if 
a 
permanent 
alteration 
in 
prices 
could 
not 
be 
produced 
or 
promoted 
by 
any 
other 
cause 
than 
the 
alteration 
in 
the 
amount 
of 
working 
time. 
This, 
however, 
Marx 
does 
not 
and 
cannot 
maintain; 
for 
it 
is 
among 
the 
results 
of 
his 
own 
teaching 
that 
an 
alteration 
in 
prices 
must 
occur 
when, 
for 
instance, 
the 
expenditure 
of 
labor 
remains 
the 
same, 
but 
when, 
owing 
to 
such 
circumstances 
as 
the 
shortening 
of 
the 
processes 
of 
production, 
the 
organic 
composition 
of 
the 
capital 
is 
changed. 
By 
the 
side 
of 
this 
proposition 
of 
Marx 



we 
might 
with 
equal 
justification 
place 
the 
other 
proposition, 
that 
prices 
rise 
or 
fall 
when, 
other 
conditions 
remaining 
equal, 
the 
length 
of 
time 
during 
which 
the 
capital 
is 
invested 
increases 
or 
decreases. 
If 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
proveby 
thelatter 
proposition 
that 
the 
length 
of 
time 
during 
which 
the 
capital 
is 
invested 
is 
the 
sole 
factor 
that 
governs 
exchange 
relations, 
it 
is 
equally 
impossible 
to 
regard 
the 
fact 
that 
alterations 
in 
the 
amounts 
of 
the 
labor 
expended 
affect 
the 
movements 
of 
prices 
as 
a 
confirmation 
of 
the 
alleged 
law 
that 
labor 
alonegovernstheexchangerelations. 


THIRDARGUMENT 


THIS 
ARGUMENT 
has 
not 
been 
developed 
withprecisionandclearnessbyMarx, 
but 
the 
substance 
of 
it 
has 
been 
woven 
into 
those 
processes 
of 
reasoning, 
the 
object 
of 
which 
was 
the 
elucidation 
of 
the 
“truly 
difficult 
question”: 
“how 
the 
adjustment 
of 
the 
profits 
to 
the 
general 
rate 
of 
profit 
takes 
place” 
(III, 
205 
ff.). 


The 
kernel 
of 
the 
argument 
is 
most 
easily 
extracted 
in 
the 
following 
way: 
Marx 
affirms, 
and 
must 
affirm, 
that 
“the 
rates 
of 
profits 
are 
originally 
very 
different” 
(III, 
186), 
and 
that 
their 
adjustment 
to 
a 
general 
rate 
of 
profits 
is 
primarily 
“a 
result, 
and 
cannot 
be 
a 
starting 
point” 
(III, 
205). 
This 
thesis 
further 
contains 
the 
claim 
that 
there 
exist 
certain 
“primitive” 
conditions 
in 
which 
the 
change 
of 
values 
into 
prices 
of 
production 
which 
leads 
to 
the 
adjustment 
of 
the 
rates 
of 
profit 
has 
not 
yet 
taken 
place, 
and 
which 
therefore 
arestillunderthecompleteandliteraldominion 
ofthelaw 
ofvalue. 
Acertain 
region 
is 
consequently 
claimed 
for 
this 
law 
in 
which 
its 
authority 
is 
perfectly 
absolute. 


Let 
us 
inquire 
more 
closely 
what 
this 
region 
is, 
and 
see 
what 
arguments 
Marx 
adduces 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
exchange 
relations 
in 
it 
are 
actually 
determinedby 
thelaborincorporatedinthecommodities. 


According 
to 
Marx 
the 
adjustment 
of 
the 
rate 
of 
profit 
is 
dependent 
on 
two 
assumptions:first,on 
acapitalist 
systemofproductionbeinginoperation(III, 
206);and 
secondly,on 
the 
levelinginfluenceof 
competition 
being 
in 
effective 
action 
(III, 
187, 
204, 
212, 
230, 
231). 
We 
must, 
therefore, 
logically 
look 
for 
the 
“primitive 
conditions” 
under 
which 
the 
pure 
regime 
of 
the 
law 
of 
value 
prevails 
where 
one 
or 
other 
of 
these 
assumed 
conditions 
does 
not 
exist 
(or, 
of 
course, 
whereboth 
areabsent). 


On 
the 
first 
of 
these 
cases 
Marx 
has 
himself 
spoken 
very 
fully. 
By 
a 
very 



detailed 
account 
of 
the 
processes 
which 
obtain 
in 
a 
condition 
of 
society 
where 
capitalist 
production 
does 
not 
yet 
prevail, 
but 
“where 
the 
means 
of 
production 
belong 
to 
the 
worker,” 
he 
shows 
the 
prices 
of 
commodities 
in 
this 
stage 
to 
be 
exclusively 
determined 
by 
their 
values. 
In 
order 
to 
enable 
the 
reader 
to 
judge 
impartially 
how 
far 
this 
account 
is 
really 
convincing, 
I 
must 
givethefulltext 
ofit: 


“The 
salient 
point 
will 
be 
best 
shown 
in 
the 
following 
way: 
Suppose 
the 
workers 
themselves 
to 
possess 
each 
his 
own 
means 
of 
production, 
and 
to 
exchange 
their 
commodities 
with 
each 
other. 
These 
commodities 
would 
not 
then 
be 
the 
product 
of 
capital. 
The 
value 
of 
the 
tools 
and 
raw 
material 
employed 
in 
the 
different 
branches 
of 
labor 
would 
be 
different 
according 
to 
the 
special 
nature 
of 
the 
work; 
and 
also, 
apart 
from 
inequality 
of 
value 
in 
the 
means 
of 
production 
employed, 
different 
amounts 
of 
these 
means 
would 
be 
required 
for 
given 
amounts 
of 
labor, 
according 
as 
one 
commodity 
could 
be 
finished 
in 
an 
hour 
and 
another 
only 
in 
a 
day, 
etc. 
Let 
us 
suppose, 
further, 
that 
these 
laborers 
work 
the 
same 
time, 
on 
an 
average, 
allowing 
for 
the 
adjustments 
which 
result 
from 
differences 
of 
intensity, 
etc., 
in 
work. 
Of 
any 
two 
workers, 
then, 
both 
would, 
first, 
in 
the 
commodities 
which 
represent 
the 
produce 
of 
their 
day’s 
labor, 
have 
replaced 
their 
outlays, 
that 
is, 
the 
cost 
prices 
of 
the 
consumed 
means 
of 
production. 
These 
would 
differ 
according 
to 
the 
technical 
nature 
of 
their 
branches 
of 
industry. 
Secondly, 
both 
would 
have 
created 
the 
same 
amount 
of 
new 
value, 
that 
is, 
the 
value 
of 
the 
day’s 
labor 
added 
to 
the 
means 
of 
production. 
This 
would 
contain 
their 
wages 
plus 
the 
surplus 
value, 
the 
surplus 
work 
above 
their 
necessary 
wants, 
of 
which 
the 
result, 
however, 
would 
belong 
to 
themselves. 
If 
we 
express 
ourselves 
in 
capitalistic 
terms, 
both 
receive 
the 
same 
wages 
plus 
the 
same 
profit, 
but 
also 
the 
value, 
represented, 
for 
instance, 
by 
the 
produce 
of 
a 
working 
day 
of 
ten 
hours. 
But 
in 
the 
first 
place 
the 
values 
of 
their 
commodities 
would 
be 
different. 
In 
commodity 
I, 
for 
example, 
there 
would 
be 
a 
larger 
share 
of 
value 
for 
the 
expended 
means 
of 
production 
than 
in 
commodity 
II. 
The 
rates 
of 
profit 
also 
would 
be 
very 
different 
for 
I 
and 
II, 
if 
we 
here 
consider 
as 
rates 
of 
profit 
the 
proportion 
of 
the 
surplus 
value 
to 
the 
total 
value 
of 
the 
employed 
means 
of 
production. 
The 
means 
of 
subsistence 
which 
I 
and 
II 
consume 
daily 
during 
the 
process 
of 
production, 
and 
which 
represent 
the 
wages 
of 
labor, 
form 
here 
that 
part 
of 
the 
advanced 
means 
of 
production 
which 
we 
usually 
call 
variable 
capital. 
But 
the 
surplus 
value 
would 
be, 
for 
the 
same 
working 
time, 
the 
same 
for 
I 
and 
II; 
or, 
to 
go 
more 
closely 
into 
the 
matter, 
as 
I 
and 
II, 



each, 
receive 
the 
value 
of 
the 
produce 
o 
deducting 
the 
value 
of 
the 
advanced 
‘c 
part 
of 
which 
may 
be 
looked 
upon 
subsistence 
consumed 
during 
the 
produc 
value 
over 
and 
above 
this. 
If 
I 
has 
had 
the 
greater 
value 
of 
his 
commodity, 
wh 
he 
has 
consequently 
a 
larger 
part 
of 
the 
material 
elements 
of 
this 
constant 
part; 
other 
hand, 
the 
less 
to 
exchange 
back. 


therefore, 
under 
this 
assumption, 
be 
a 


today 
a 
matter 
of 
indifference 
to 
the 
w 
amount 
of 
surplus 
value 
squeezed 
out 
international 
commerce 
the 
difference 
nations 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
indifference 
for 
(III,206 
ff.). 


And 
now 
Marx 
passes 
at 
once 
from 
th 
with 
its 
subjunctive 
moods 
to 
a 
series 
exchange 
of 
commodities 
at 
then-value 
demands, 
therefore, 
a 
much 
lower 
stag 
into 
prices 
of 
production,” 
and 
“it 
is, 
t 
fact 
to 
regard 
the 
values 
as 
not 
only 
the 
prices 
of

are 
we 
to 
think 
of 
this 
reasonin 
to 
notice 
carefully 
that 
the 
hypothetical 
exchange 
would 
present 
itself

thos

to 
the 
description 
contains 
no 
shadow 
of 
proof 
under 
the 
given 
assumptions 
things 
“supposes,” 
asserts, 
but 
he 
gives 
no 
wor 
bold, 
not 
to 
say 
naive 
jump,

he

he 
had 
successfully 
worked 
o 
therefore, 
quite 
consistent 
with 
facts 
to 
prior 
to 
prices 
of 
production. 
As 
a 
mat 
Marx
