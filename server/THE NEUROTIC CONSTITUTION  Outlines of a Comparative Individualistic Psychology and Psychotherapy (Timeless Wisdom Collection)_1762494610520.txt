PREFACE 
TO 
THE 
TIMELESS 
WISDOM 
COLLECTION 


Welcome 
to 
another 
volume 
of 
this 
great 
collection 
of 
the 
best 
novels 
and 
non 
fiction 
books 
on 
self-help, 
psychology, 
theosophy, 
philosophy 
and 
science. 


King 
Solomon 
said 
in 
Ecclesiastes 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
new 
under 
the 
sun. 


For 
thousands 
of 
years, 
life 
has 
been 
teaching 
us 
the 
same 
lessons 
over 
and 
over. 
Through 
war 
and 
peace; 
through 
rags 
and 
riches; 
through 
stories 
of 
hope 
and 
of 
despair; 
through 
tragedies 
and 
failure 
that 
end 
in 
triumph 
and 
success… 


The 
lessons 
are 
simple, 
as 
simple 
are 
the 
values 
in 
which 
they 
are 
based: 
Courage, 
Perseverance, 
Faith, 
Love, 
Truthfulness, 
Purpose, 
Decision, 
Good 
Stewardship, 
Kindness, 
Happiness… 


Among 
the 
main 
lessons 
to 
remember, 
is 
that 
we 
have 
to 
be 
extremely 
careful 
with 
what 
we 
think 
and 
how 
we 
think 
it. 


Thoughts 
are 
Things; 
things 
that 
have 
a 
tendency 
to 
transform 
into 
our 
reality. 
“As 
a 
man 
thinks 
so 
is 
his 
life” 
says 
the 
Bible. 
Like 
attracts 
like. 
Fear, 
Hate 
and 
Worry 
attract 
more 
fear, 
more 
hate 
and 
more 
worry, 
in 
all 
its 
manifestations. 


However, 
positive 
thinking 
and 
a 
faithful 
attitude 
attracts 
positive 
things. 


Countless 
sages 
of 
the 
ages 
have 
tried 
to 
convey 
these 
messages 
and 
lessons 
in 
different 
ways 
and 
formulas. 


From 
Pythagoras 
to 
Plato; 
from 
Dante, 
to 
Da 
Vinci 
and 
Goethe; 
from 
Bacon 
to 
Shakespeare; 
from 
Emerson 
to 
Mulford; 
from 
Joan 
D’Arc 
to 
Helen 
Keller; 
from 
Franklin 
to 
Lincoln… 
But 
we 
just 
keep 
ignoring 
them, 
and 
making 
the 
same 
mistakes… 


In 
this 
Timeless 
Wisdom 
Collection, 
we 
present 
you 
men 
and 
women 
whose 
lives 
were 
committed 
to 
enlighten 
the 
world 
with 
the 
wisdom 
of 
the 
ages. 


It 
was 
originally 
born 
as 
a 
tribute 
to 
the 
New 
Thought 
authors 
which 
started 
the 
self-development 
and 
positive 
thinking 
movement 
over 
a 
century 



ago, 
and 
were 
rediscovered 
and 
became 
extremely 
popular 
in 
the 
new 
millennium 
thanks 
to 
books 
like 
“The 
Secret”. 


Napoleon 
Hill, 
Dale 
Carnegie, 
Charles 
A. 
Haanel, 
William 
Walker 
Atkinson, 
Orison 
Swett 
Marden, 
Wallace 
Wattles, 
Bruce 
Maclelland, 
Christian 
D 
Larson, 
Ernest 
Holmes, 
Ralph 
Waldo 
Trine, 
Elizabeth 
Towne, 
Henry 
Wood, 
Florence 
Scovell-Shinn, 
Charles 
Fillmore, 
and 
many 
more 
–all 
household 
names 
for 
the 
last 
hundred 
years– 
are 
featured 
in 
our 
collection. 


However, 
as 
the 
collection 
kept 
growing, 
we 
realized 
that 
knowledge 
and 
wisdom 
comes 
in 
many 
shapes 
and 
forms. 


Therefore, 
we 
searched 
for 
the 
greatest 
works 
and 
sages 
of 
the 
20th 
Century, 
and 
included 
in 
the 
collection 
the 
work 
of 
leading 
psychologists 
as 
Emile 
Coué, 
Isador 
Coriat, 
Alfred 
Adler 
or 
Carl 
Jung; 
authors 
of 
theosophy 
and 
eastern 
philosophies 
as 
Annie 
Besant, 
William 
Judge, 
Charles 
Leadbeater; 
A.P. 
Sinnet, 
or 
Stewart 
Edward 
White; 
prominent 
modern 
philosophers 
as 
Bertrand 
Russell 
and 
Alfred 
North 
Whitehead; 
extraordinary 
scientist 
as 
Charles 
Galton 
Darwin, 
Sir 
Arthur 
Stanley 
Eddington 
and 
J.W.Dunne; 
successful 
industrialists 
that 
changed 
our 
modern 
world 
as 
Henry 
Ford, 
Andrew 
Carnegie 
and 
Charles 
Schwab; 
and 
brilliant 
Economists 
that 
shaped 
our 
future 
as 
John 
Maynard 
Keynes. 


Then 
we 
remembered 
that, 
since 
the 
dawn 
of 
humanity, 
we 
have 
always 
loved 
story 
telling. 
With 
fables 
loaded 
with 
symbols 
and 
allegories, 
our 
ancestors 
passed 
Wisdom 
and 
Knowledge 
from 
generation 
to 
generation. 
Today, 
although 
there 
are 
other 
means 
to 
accomplish 
that 
transfer, 
we 
still 
love 
a 
good 
story; 
we 
get 
enamored 
by 
the 
characters, 
suffer 
their 
pain 
and 
their 
tragedies, 
and 
enjoy 
their 
triumphs 
and 
success 
as 
if 
they 
were 
ours; 
as 
if 
they 
were 
true. 
And 
in 
this 
way, 
we 
learn! 


Therefore 
we 
feature 
in 
our 
collection 
the 
best 
classics 
of 
modern 
literature 
represented 
by 
names 
as 
Ernest 
Hemingway, 
William 
Faulkner, 
H. 


G. 
Wells, 
George 
Orwell, 
Edgar 
Rice 
Burroughs, 
Aldous 
Huxley, 
C.S. 
Lewis, 
Charles 
Williams, 
E.P.Oppenheim, 
E.M. 
Delafield, 
Louisa 
May 
Alcott, 
Mark 
Twain, 
J.M.Barrie, 
Rafael 
Sabatini, 
and 
many 
others, 
that 
have 
forever 
enlarged 
our 
capacity 
to 
dream. 
In 
thousands 
of 
masterpieces 
–some 
of 
them 
listed 
at 
the 
end 
of 
this 
book



these 
writers 
brilliantly 
captured 
the 
essence 
of 
life 
and 
success 
in 
its 
different 
manifestations. 
Carefully 
selected, 
we 
are 
now 
placing 
in 
your 
hands 
the 
best 
collection 
in 
personal 
and 
mind-development 
in 
existence.

enlightenment.

seeker 
–the 
one 
who 
is 
ready 
and 
is 
paying 
attention-, 
some 
of 
the 
deepest 
answers 
to 
life.

PREFACE 


After 
I 
had 
made 
the 
attempt 
to 
investigate 
in 
the 
Studie 
uber 
Minderwertigkeit 
-von 
Organen 
the 
structure 
and 
tectonic 
of 
organs 
in 
association 
with 
their 
genetic 
basis, 
their 
functional 
capability 
and 
destiny, 
I 
proceeded, 
supporting 
myself 
upon 
already 
available 
data 
as 
well 
as 
upon 
my 
own 
experience, 
to 
apply 
the 
same 
method 
in 
the 
study 
of 
psychopathology. 
In 
the 
book 
before 
us 
are 
embraced 
the 
most 
important 
results 
of 
my 
comparative, 
individual-psychologic 
studies 
of 
the 
neuroses. 


As 
was 
the 
case 
in 
the 
theory 
of 
somatic 
inferiority, 
an 
empiric 
basis 
is 
made 
use 
of 
in 
comparative 
individual 
psychology 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
establishing 
a 
fictive 
standard 
of 
normality 
in 
order 
to 
enable 
one 
to 
measure 
and 
compare 
with 
it 
grades 
of 
deviation 
from 
it. 
In 
both 
of 
these 
scientific 
endeavors, 
the 
comparative 
method 
of 
study 
reckons 
with 
the 
origin 
of 
phenomena, 
dismisses 
from 
consideration 
the 
present 
and 
seeks 
to 
outline 
from 
them 
the 
future. 
This 
method 
of 
approach 
leads 
us 
to 
view 
the 
compulsion 
of 
evolution 
and 
the 
pathological 
elaboration 
as 
the 
result 
of 
a 
conflict 
which 
breaks 
forth 
in 
the 
organic 
sphere 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
attaining 
equipoise, 
functional 
capability 
and 
adaptation; 
the 
same 
struggle 
in 
the 
psychic 
sphere 
is 
under 
the 
command 
of 
a 
fictitious 
idea 
of 
personality 
whose 
influence 
dominates 
the 
development 
of 
the 
neurotic 
character 
and 
symptoms. 
If 
in 
the 
organic 
sphere, 
" 
the 
individual 
develops 
into 
a 
unit 
mass 
in 
which 
all 
of 
the 
individual 
parts 
co-operate 
toward 
a 
common 
goal" 
(Virchow), 
if 
the 
various 
abilities 
and 
tendencies 
of 
the 
individual 
tend 
toward 
a 
purposefully 
directed, 
unit-personality, 
then 
we 
may 
look 
upon 
every 
single 
manifestation 
of 
life 
as 
if 
in 
its 
past, 
present 
and 
future 
there 
are 
contained 
traces 
of 
a 
dominating, 
guiding 
idea. 


In 
this 
way 
it 
has 
appeared 
to 
the 
author 
of 
this 
book, 
that 
the 
most 
minute 
trait 
of 
psychic 
life 
is 
permeated 
by 
a 
purpose 
force., 
Comparative, 
individualistic 
psychology 
sees 
in 
every 
psychic 
event 
the 
impress, 
so 
to 
speak, 
or 
symbol 
of 
a 
uniformly 
directed 
plan 
of 
life 
which 
only 
comes 
more 
clearly 
to 
light 
in 
the 
neuroses 
and 
psychoses. 


The 
result 
of 
such 
an 
investigation 
of 
the 
neurotic 
character 
should 



furnish 
proof 
of 
the 
value 
and 
utility 
of 
our 
method 
of 
comparative, 


individualistic 
psychology 
in 
the 
problems 
of 
mental 
life.

INTRODUCTION 


" 
Omnia 
ex 
opinione 
suspensa 
sunt: 
non 
ambitio 
tantum 
ad 
illam 
respicit 
et 
luxuria 
et 
avaricia. 
Ad 
opinionem 
dolemus. 
Tam 
miser 
est 
quisque 
quam 
credidit." 
SENECA, 
Epist., 
78, 
13. 
X 


The 
study 
of 
the 
neurotic 
character 
is 
an 
essential 
part 
of 
neuropsychology. 
Like 
all 
other 
psychic 
phenomena 
it 
can 
only 
be 
understood 
when 
taken 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
entire 
psychic 
life. 
A 
cursory 
knowledge 
of 
the 
neuroses 
suffices 
to 
enable 
one 
to 
discover 
that 
which 
is 
peculiarly 
characteristic 
in 
them 
and 
all 
writers 
who 
have 
studied 
the 
problem 
of 
nervousness 
have 
laid 
particular 
stress 
upon 
certain 
peculiar 
traits 
of 
character. 
The 
opinion 
was 
a 
general 
one 
that 
the 
neurotic 
shows 
a 
series 
of 
sharply 
emphasized 
traits 
of 
character 
which 
exceed 
the 
normal 
standard. 
The 
marked 
sensitiveness, 
the 
irritable 
debility, 
the 
suggestibility, 
the 
egotism, 
the 
penchant 
for 
the 
fantastic, 
the 
estrangement 
from 
reality, 
but 
also 
more 
special 
traits 
such 
as 
tyranny, 
malevolence, 
a 
self-sacrificing 
virtue, 
coquetry, 
anxiety 
and 
absent-mindedness 
are 
met 
with 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
case 
histories 
and 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
detail 
all 
writers 
who 
have 
thoroughly 
studied 
the 
subject 
in 
order 
to 
endorse 
their 
contributions. 
Of 
the 
more 
recent 
ones, 
Janet, 
who 
has 
carried 
on 
the 
traditions 
of 
the 
famous 
French 
school 
and 
who 
has 
brought 
to 
light 
some 
very 
important 
and 
ingenious 
analyses, 
must 
be 
especially 
mentioned. 
His 
emphasis 
of 
the 
neurotic's 
"sentiment 
d'incompletude 
" 
particularly, 
is 
so 
wholly 
in 
harmony 
with 
the 
results 
offered 
by 
me 
that 
I 
am 
justified 
in 
seeing 
in 
my 
work 
an 
extension 
of 
this 
most 
important 
fundamental 
fact 
of 
the 
mental 
life 
of 
the 
neurotic. 


No 
matter 
where 
one 
begins 
with 
the 
analysis 
of 
psychogenic 
disorders, 
one 
and 
the 
same 
phenomenon 
forces 
itself 
upon 
one's 
attention 
after 
the 
briefest 
observation, 
namely, 
that 
the 
entire 
picture 
of 
the 
neurosis 
as 
well 
as 
all 
its 
symptoms 
are 
influenced 
by, 
nay, 
even 
wholly 
provoked 
by 
an 
imaginary 
fictitious 
goal. 
This 
final 
purpose 
has 
a 
creative, 
directive 
and 
adjustive 
power. 
The 
potency 
of 
this 
"goal 
idea" 
is 
revealed 
to 
us 
by 
the 
trend 
and 
evaluation 
of 
the 
pathological 
phenomena 
and 
should 
one 
attempt 
to 
dispense 
with 
this 
assumption 
there 
remains 
nothing 
but 
a 
confusing 
mass 
of 
impulses, 
trends, 
components, 
debilities 
and 
anomalies 
which 
has 
made 
the 



obscurity 
of 
the 
neurosis 
impenetrable 
to 
some, 
while 
others 
have 
undertaken 
bold 
exploratory 
journeys 
into 
this 
field. 


Pierre 
Janet 
has 
certainly 
recognized 
this 
relationship 
as 
is 
shown 
in 
his 
classical 
descriptions 
of 
the 
Hysterical 
Psyche; 
1894 
(transl. 
by 
Dr. 
Max 
Kahane), 
but 
he 
avoided 
a 
detailed 
description. 
He 
expressly 
maintains, 
" 
I 
have 
until 
now 
only 
described 
general 
and 
simple 
traits 
of 
character 
which 
by 
means 
of 
their 
association 
and 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
definite 
extraneous 
circumstances 
may 
produce 
all 
kinds 
of 
curious 
behavior 
and 
conduct." 
It 
is 
entirely 
out 
of 
place 
here 
to 
enter 
into 
a 
detailed 
discussion 
of 
Janet's 
description 
for 
this 
treatise 
would 
then 
resemble 
more 
a 
moral 
romance 
than 
a 
clinical 
study. 
Having 
adhered 
to 
this 
attitude 
even 
up 
to 
his 
latest 
contributions 
on 
the 
subject, 
Janet, 
notwithstanding 
his 
keen 
insight 
into 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
neuroses 
and 
moral 
philosophy, 
never 
entered 
the 
road 
to 
synthesis. 


It 
remained 
for 
Joseph 
Breuer, 
a 
man 
well 
versed 
in 
current 
German 
philosophy, 
to 
discover 
the 
gem 
which 
lay 
in 
his 
path. 
He 
directed 
his 
attention 
to 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
symptoms 
and 
undertook 
to 
ascertain 
the 
source 
and 
purpose 
of 
the 
same 
from 
the 
only 
one 
who 
could 
give 
them 
from 
the 
patient. 
In 
so 
doing 
the 
author 
founded 
a 
method 
which 
seeks 
to 
explain 
individual 
psychological 
phenomena 
historically 
and 
genetically 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
a 
preliminary 
hypothesis, 
i.e., 
that 
of 
the 
determinism 
of 
psychic 
phenomena. 
The 
manner 
in 
which 
this 
method 
has 
been 
extended 
and 
improved 
upon 
by 
Sigmund 
Freud 
with 
the 
host 
of 
problems 
and 
attempted 
solutions 
therewith 
connected 
belongs 
to 
contemporaneous 
history 
and 
has 
met 
with 
both 
recognition 
and 
contradiction. 
Less 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
following 
a 
critical 
bent 
than 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
making 
clear 
my 
own 
position 
I 
beg 
leave 
to 
separate 
from 
the 
fruitful 
and 
valuable 
contributions 
of 
Freud 
three 
of 
his 
fundamental 
views 
as 
erroneous 
inasmuch 
as 
they 
threaten 
to 
impede 
progress 
in 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
neuroses. 
The 
first 
objection 
is 
directed 
against 
the 
view 
that 
the 
libido 
is 
the 
motive 
force 
behind 
the 
phenomena 
of 
the 
neurosis. 
On 
the 
contrary 
it 
is 
the 
neurosis 
which 
shows 
more 
clearly 
than 
does 
normal 
psychic 
conduct 
how 
by 
means 
of 
this 
neurotic 
positing 
of 
a 
" 
final 
purpose," 
the 
apperception 
of 
pleasure, 
its 
selection 
and 
power 
are 
all 
driven 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
this 
final 
purpose 
so 
that 
the 
neurotic 
can 
really 
only 
follow 
the 
allurement 
of 
the 
acquisition 
of 



pleasure 
with 
his 
healthy 
psychic 
force, 
so 
to 
speak, 
while 
for 
the 
neurotic 
portion 
only 
"higher" 
goals 
are 
of 
value. 


The 
neurotic 
goal 
(Zwecksetzung) 
has 
revealed 
itself 
to 
us 
in 
the 
heightened 
ego-consciousness 
(Personlichkeitsgefuhl) 
whose 
simplest 
formula 
is 
to 
be 
recognized 
in 
an 
exaggerated 
" 
masculine 
protest" 
(Mannlicher 
Protest). 
This 
formula: 
"I 
wish 
to 
be 
a 
complete 
man" 
is 
the 
guiding 
fiction 
in 
every 
neurosis, 
claiming 
higher 
reality 
values 
than 
even 
the 
normal 
psyche. 
The 
libido, 
the 
sex-impulses 
and 
the 
tendencies 
to 
sexual 
perversions 
arrange 
themselves 
in 
accordance 
with 
this 
guiding 
principle, 
no 
matter 
whence 
they 
originate. 
Nietzsche's 
"Will 
to 
power 
" 
and 
" 
Will 
to 
seem 
" 
embrace 
many 
of 
our 
views, 
which 
again 
resemble 
in 
some 
respects 
the 
views 
of 
Fere 
and 
the 
older 
writers, 
according 
to 
whom 
the 
sensation 
of 
pleasure 
originates 
in 
a 
feeling 
of 
power, 
that 
of 
pain 
in 
a 
feeling 
of 
feebleness 
(Ohnmacht). 


A 
second 
objection 
is 
directed 
agSinst 
Freud's 
fundamental 
view 
of 
the 
sexual 
etiology 
of 
the 
neuroses, 
a 
view 
which 
Pierre 
Janet 
approached 
very 
closely 
when 
he 
asked, 
"Is 
sexual 
feeling 
then 
the 
center 
around 
which 
all 
other 
psychological 
syntheses 
are 
built 
up?" 
The 
applicability 
of 
the 
sexual 
picture 
deceives 
the 
normal 
person 
and 
especially 
the 
neurotic. 
But 
it 
must 
not 
deceive 
the 
psychologist. 
The 
sexual 
content 
in 
the 
neurotic 
phenomenon 
originates 
primarily 
in 
the 
imaginary 
antithesis: 
" 
Masculine-feminine" 
and 
is 
evolved 
through 
a 
change 
of 
form 
of 
the 
"masculine 
protest." 
The 
sexual 
trend 
in 
the 
fantasy 
and 
life 
of 
the 
neurotic 
follows 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
" 
masculine 
goal," 
and 
is 
really 
not 
a 
trend, 
but 
a 
compulsion. 
The 
whole 
picture 
of 
the 
sexual 
neurosis 
is 
nothing 
more 
than 
a 
portrait 
depicting 
the 
distance 
which 
the 
patient 
is 
removed 
from 
the 
imaginary 
masculine 
goal 
and 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
he 
seeks 
to 
bridge 
it. 
It 
is 
strange 
that 
Freud, 
a 
skillful 
connoisseur 
of 
the 
symbolic 
in 
life, 
was 
not 
able 
to 
discover 
the 
symbolic 
in 
" 
sexual 
apperception," 
to 
recognize 
the 
sexual 
as 
a 
jargon, 
a 
modus 
dicendi. 
But 
we 
can 
understand 
this 
when 
we 
take 
into 
consideration 
the 
more 
extensive 
basic 
error, 
i.e., 
the 
assumption 
that 
the 
neurotic 
is 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
infantile 
wishes, 
which 
come 
to 
life 
nightly 
(Dream 
theory) 
as 
well 
as 
in 
connection 
with 
certain 
occasions 
in 
life. 
In 
reality 
these 
infantile 
wishes 
already 
stand 
under 
the 
compulsion 
of 
the 
imaginary 
goal 
and 
themselves 
usually 
bear 
the 
character 
of 
a 
guiding 
thought 
suitably 
arrayed, 



and 
adapt 
themselves 
to 
symbolic 
expression 
purely 
for 
reasons 
of 
thought 
economy. 
A 
sickly 
girl 
who 
during 
her 
entire 
childhood 
in 
her 
consciousness 
of 
an 
unusual 
insecurity 
leans 
upon 
her 
father 
and 
in 
so 
doing 
strives 
to 
become 
superior 
to 
her 
mother, 
may 
comprehend 
this 
psychic 
constellation 
in 
the 
form 
of 
an 
incest, 
as 
if 
she 
wished 
to 
be 
the 
wife 
of 
her 
father. 
Thereby 
the 
goal 
is 
both 
attained 
and 
effective; 
her 
insecurity 
is 
only 
abolished 
when 
she 
is 
with 
her 
father. 
Her 
developed 
psycho-motor 
intelligence, 
her 
unconsciously 
active 
memory 
combats 
all 
feelings 
of 
uncertainty 
with 
the 
same 
aggression, 
with 
the 
adequate 
expedient, 
to 
take 
refuge 
in 
the 
father 
as 
if 
she 
were 
his 
wife. 


There 
she 
finds 
that 
heightened 
ego-consciousness 
which 
she 
has 
set 
for 
her 
goal, 
which 
she 
has 
borrowed 
from 
the 
masculine 
ideal 
of 
childhood, 
from 
the 
over-compensation 
of 
her 
feeling 
of 
inferiority. 
If 
she 
recoils 
from 
a 
proffer 
of 
love 
or 
marriage, 
threatening 
her 
as 
they 
do 
with 
a 
fresh 
lowering 
of 
her 
egoconsciousness, 
she 
acts 
symbolically, 
and 
all 
her 
defensive 
resources 
and 
her 
predispositions 
become 
arrayed 
against 
a 
female 
destiny 
and 
make 
her 
seek 
security 
where 
she 
has 
always 
found 
it, 
with 
her 
father. 
She 
utilizes 
an 
expedient, 
behaves 
in 
accordance 
with 
a 
senseless 
fiction, 
but 
is 
nevertheless 
certain 
of 
attaining 
her 
goal. 
The 
greater 
her 
feeling 
of 
uncertainty, 
the 
more 
firmly 
this 
girl 
clings 
to 
her 
fiction, 
endeavors 
to 
take 
it 
quite 
literally 
and 
since 
human 
thinking 
favors 
symbolic 
abstraction 
the 
patient 
with 
a 
little 
effort 
(and 
also 
the 
analyst) 
is 
successful 
in 
the 
longing 
of 
neurotics, 
namely, 
to 
find 
security, 
to 
gain 
a 
foothold 
in 
the 
symbolic 
picture 
of 
incestuous 
emotion. 


Freud 
was 
obliged 
to 
see 
in 
this 
purposeful 
manifestation 
a 
reanimation 
of 
infantile 
wishes 
because 
according 
to 
him 
the 
latter 
are 
to 
be 
looked 
upon 
as 
motive 
forces. 
We 
recognize 
in 
this 
infantile 
mode 
of 
procedure, 
in 
the 
extensive 
use 
of 
safety-devices 
(Hilfsconstructionen), 
in 
which 
light 
the 
neurotic 
fiction 
is 
to 
be 
regarded, 
in 
the 
many-sided 
motor 
preparedness 
which 
reaches 
into 
the 
remote 
past, 
in 
the 
strong 
tendency 
to 
abstraction 
and 
symbolization, 
the 
most 
useful 
expedient 
of 
the 
neurotic, 
who 
strives 
toward 
security, 
toward 
a 
maximation 
of 
his 
ego, 
toward 
the 
masculine 
protest. 


If 
we 
attach 
to 
these 
critical 
remarks 
the 
question 
of 
how 
the 
neurotic 
phenomena 
come 
into 
being, 
why 
the 
patient 
wills 
to 
be 
a 
man 
and 
constantly 
seeks 
to 
adduce 
proof 
thereof, 
whence 
he 
has 
the 
stronger 
necessity 
for 
ego



consciousness, 
why 
he 
makes 
such 
strong 
endeavors 
to 
gain 
security, 
in 
short, 
if 
we 
inquire 
into 
the 
final 
reasons 
for 
these 
devices 
of 
the 
neurotic 
psyche, 
we 
may 
conjecture 
that 
which 
is 
revealed 
by 
every 
analysis, 
namely, 
that 
at 
the 
onset 
of 
the 
development 
of 
a 
neurosis 
there 
stands 
threateningly 
the 
feeling 
of 
uncertainty 
and 
inferiority 
and 
demands 
insistently 
a 
guiding, 
assuring 
and 
tranquilizing 
positing 
of 
a 
goal 
in 
order 
to 
render 
life 
bearable. 
Among 
these 
are 
especially 
prominent 
safety 
devices 
and 
fictions 
in 
thought, 
action 
and 
volition. 


It 
is 
clear 
that 
this 
sort 
of 
psyche, 
directed 
as 
it 
is 
with 
especial 
force 
toward 
a 
heightening 
of 
the 
ego, 
will, 
aside 
from 
specific 
neurotic 
symptoms, 
make 
itself 
conspicuous 
in 
society 
because 
of 
its 
evident 
inability 
to 
adapt 
itself. 
The 
consciousness 
of 
the 
weak 
point 
dominates 
the 
neurotic 
to 
such 
a 
degree 
that 
often 
without 
knowing 
it 
he 
begins 
to 
construct 
with 
all 
his 
might 
the 
protecting 
superstructure. 
Along 
with 
this 
his 
sensitiveness 
becomes 
more 
acute, 
he 
learns 
to 
pay 
attention 
to 
relationships 
which 
still 
escape 
others, 
he 
exaggerates 
his 
cautiousness, 
begins 
to 
anticipate 
all 
sorts 
of 
disagreeable 
consequences 
in 
starting 
out 
to 
do 
something 
or 
in 
experiencing 
an 
injury, 
he 
endeavors 
to 
hear 
further 
and 
to 
see 
further, 
belittles 
himself, 
becomes 
insatiable, 
economical, 
constantly 
strives 
to 
extend 
the 
boundaries 
of 
his 
influence 
and 
power 
over 
space 
and 
time 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
loses 
that 
peace 
of 
mind 
and 
freedom 
from 
prejudice 
which 
above 
all 
guarantee 
mental 
health. 
His 
mistrust 
of 
himself 
and 
others, 
his 
envy 
and 
maliciousness, 
become 
gradually 
more 
pronounced, 
aggressive 
and 
cruel 
tendencies 
which 
are 
to 
secure 
for 
him 
supremacy 
over 
his 
environment, 
gain 
the 
upper 
hand, 
or 
he 
endeavors 
to 
captivate 
and 
conquer 
others 
by 
means 
of 
greater 
obedience, 
submission 
and 
humility 
which 
not 
infrequently 
degenerate 
into 
masochistic 
traits; 
thus 
both 
heightened 
activity 
as 
well 
as 
increased 
passivity 
are 
expedients 
ushered 
in 
by 
the 
fictitious 
goal 
of 
an 
increased 
power, 
of 
a 
desire 
to 
be 
above, 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest. 


Thus 
we 
have 
arrived 
at 
those 
psychic 
phenomena, 
at 
the 
neurotic 
character, 
the 
discussion 
of 
which 
forms 
the 
content 
of 
this 
book. 
None 
of 
the 
neurotic's 
traits 
of 
character 
are 
essentially 
new. 
He 
shows 
no 
single 
trait 
which 
cannot 
likewise 
be 
demonstrated 
in 
the 
healthy 
individual, 
although 
at 
times 
it 
becomes 
understandable 
for 
the 
physician 
as 
well 
as 
the 
patient 
only 
through 
analysis. 
It 
is 
uninterruptedly 
"sensitized," 
thrust 
forward 
like 
an 



outpost, 
and 
represents 
the 
sounding 
of 
the 
environment 
and 
the 
future. 
The 
knowledge 
of 
these 
psychic 
dexterities, 
which 
protrude 
far 
and 
wide, 
like 
sensitive 
antennae, 
first 
makes 
possible 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
neurotic's 
struggle 
with 
his 
fate, 
of 
his 
stimulated 
aggressive 
tendency, 
his 
unrest 
and 
impatience. 
For 
these 
antennae 
test 
all 
the 
phenomena 
of 
the 
environment 
and 
examine 
them 
constantly 
for 
their 
advantages 
and 
disadvantages 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
assumed 
goal. 
They 
create 
the 
keen 
sense 
for 
estimate 
and 
comparison, 
awaken, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
attention 
active 
in 
them, 
fear, 
hope, 
doubt, 
expectations 
of 
all 
sorts 
and 
seek 
to 
ensure 
the 
psyche 
against 
surprise 
and 
against 
a 
lowering 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness. 
They 
put 
forth 
the 
most 
accessible 
motor 
dexterities, 
ever 
mobile, 
ever 
ready 
to 
prevent 
a 
degradation 
of 
the 
person. 
The 
forces 
of 
internal 
and 
external 
experience 
are 
active 
in 
them, 
they 
are 
filled 
with 
memory-rests 
of 
fear 
inspiring 
as 
well 
as 
consoling 
experiences, 
the 
reminiscences 
of 
which 
they 
have 
changed 
into 
dexterities. 
Categorical 
imperatives 
of 
the 
second 
rank, 
they 
do 
not 
serve 
to 
bring 
about 
their 
own 
existence, 
but 
in 
the 
last 
analysis 
cause 
an 
elevation 
of 
the 
ego-
consciousness 
and 
they 
attempt 
this 
by 
making 
possible 
the 
discovery 
in 
the 
unrest 
and 
uncertainty 
of 
life, 
of 
guiding 
principles, 
by 
facilitating 
the 
differentiation 
between 
right 
and 
wrong, 
up 
and 
down, 
right 
and 
left. 
The 
accentuated 
traits 
of 
character 
are 
to 
be 
found 
already 
in 
the 
neurotic 
disposition 
where 
they 
give 
rise 
to 
peculiarities 
and 
perversions 
of 
conduct. 
These 
become 
still 
more 
pronounced 
when 
after 
a 
more 
severe 
attack 
or 
after 
the 
emergence 
of 
a 
contradiction 
in 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
(Sicherungstendenz) 
asserts 
itself 
and 
simultaneously 
calls 
forth 
symptoms 
as 
new, 
effective 
expedients. 
They 
are 
largely 
constructed 
after 
models 
and 
patterns 
and 
have 
for 
their 
object 
the 
initiation 
in 
every 
new 
situation 
of 
the 
struggle 
for 
the 
preservation 
of 
the 
ego 
and 
victory 
for 
it. 
In 
their 
influence 
lies 
the 
reason 
for 
the 
exaggerated 
affectivity 
and 
lowered 
threshold 
of 
stimulation 
in 
contrast 
with 
normal 
individuals. 
It 
goes 
without 
saying 
that 
the 
neurotic 
character, 
too, 
develops 
out 
of 
material 
already 
at 
hand, 
out 
of 
psychic 
impulses 
and 
metamorphosing 
experiences 
of 
the 
somatic 
functions. 


All 
these 
psychic 
dexterities, 
standing 
as 
they 
do 
in 
close 
contact 
with 
the 
outside 
world, 
become 
neurotic 
only 
when 
an 
inner 
want 
accentuates 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
which 
in 
turn 
more 
effectively 
constructs 
and 
mobilizes 



the 
traits 
of 
character 
only 
when 
the 
fictitious 
object 
of 
life 
operates 
more 
dogmatically 
and 
strengthens 
those 
secondary 
guiding 
principles 
which 
are 
in 
accord 
with 
the 
traits 
of 
character. 
It 
is 
then 
that 
the 
hypostatization 
of 
the 
character 
sets 
in, 
its 
transformation 
from 
a 
means 
to 
a 
goal 
leads 
to 
an 
independence 
of 
existence 
and 
a 
sort 
of 
deification 
lends 
to 
it 
unchangeability 
and 
eternal 
worth. 
The 
neurotic 
character 
is 
thus 
incapable 
of 
adjusting 
itself 
to 
reality 
because 
it 
is 
always 
striving 
toward 
an 
impossible 
ideal. 
It 
is 
a 
product 
and 
instrument 
of 
a 
cautious 
psyche 
which 
strengthens 
its 
guiding 
principle 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
ridding 
itself 
of 
a 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
an 
attempt 
which 
is 
destined 
to 
be 
wrecked 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
inner 
contradiction, 
on 
the 
barriers 
of 
civilization 
or 
on 
the 
rights 
of 
others. 
Analogous 
to 
the 
groping 
gestures, 
pose 
in 
facing 
the 
rear, 
to 
the 
bodily 
attitude 
in 
the 
act 
of 
aggression, 
like 
mimicry 
as 
a 
form 
of 
expression 
and 
instrument 
of 
motility, 
so 
the 
traits 
of 
character, 
especially 
the 
neurotic 
ones, 
serve 
as 
a 
psychic 
means 
and 
form 
of 
expression 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
entering 
into 
an 
account 
with 
life, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
assuming 
an 
attitude, 
of 
gaining 
a. 
fixed 
point 
in 
the 
vicissitudes 
of 
life, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
reaching 
that 
security-giving 
goal, 
the 
feeling 
of 
superiority. 


Thus 
we 
have 
unmasked 
the 
neurotic 
character 
as 
the 
servant 
of 
an 
imaginary 
goal 
and 
have 
established 
its 
dependence 
upon 
a 
final 
purpose. 
It 
has 
not 
sprung 
up 
independently 
out 
of 
any 
sort 
of 
biological 
or 
constitutional 
primitive 
force, 
but 
has 
received 
direction 
and 
motivation 
from 
the 
compensatory 
superstructure 
and 
the 
schematic 
guiding 
principle. 
Its 
emergence 
took 
place 
under 
the 
pressure 
of 
uncertainty, 
its 
tendency 
to 
personify 
itself 
is 
the 
doubtful 
success 
of 
the 
craving 
for 
security. 
This 
course 
of 
the 
neurotic 
character 
has 
received 
through 
the 
positing 
of 
a 
final 
purpose 
its 
destination 
which 
is 
the 
masculine 
main 
principle 
and 
thus 
every 
neurotic 
tendency 
betrays 
to 
us 
by 
its 
direction 
that 
it 
is 
impregnated 
with 
the 
masculine 
protest 
which 
seeks 
to 
make 
of 
it 
an 
unfailing 
instrument 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
excluding 
from 
experience 
every 
permanent 
degradation. 


In 
the 
practical 
part 
of 
this 
book 
will 
be 
shown 
by 
means 
of 
a 
series 
of 
cases 
how 
the 
“neurotic 
scheme” 
calls 
forth 
special 
psycho-pathological 
constellations, 
namely, 
through 
the 
apperception 
of 
experiences 
by 
means 
of 
the 
neurotic 
character. 


Since 
the 
inception 
of 
the 
psychoanalytic 
movement 
its 
students 
have 



shown 
a 
remarkable 
activity 
in 
applying 
the 
principles 
of 
interpretation 
originally 
enunciated 
by 
Freud 
over 
a 
wide 
field 
of 
human 
endeavor, 
and 
thus 
not 
only 
have 
the 
neurotic 
and 
the 
psychotic 
come 
under 
the 
critical 
survey 
of 
the 
analyst, 
but 
the 
whole 
course 
of 
cultural 
development 
has 
been 
subjected 
to 
inquiry 
along 
these 
lines. 
In 
addition 
to 
this 
growth 
in 
the 
extent 
of 
the 
movement 
it 
has 
manifested 
what 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
be 
a 
very 
healthy 
tendency, 
namely, 
it 
has 
shown 
an 
inclination 
to 
put 
forth 
suggestions 
as 
to 
new 
methods 
of 
approach 
to 
the 
problems, 
represented 
here 
and 
there 
by 
groups 
of 
workers 
who 
have 
tended 
to 
depart 
more 
or 
less 
from 
the 
original 
formulations 
as 
laid 
down 
by 
Freud. 
One 
of 
the 
most 
stimulating 
and 
valuable 
points 
of 
view 
which 
have 
been 
developed 
in 
this 
way 
is 
that 
of 
Alfred 
Adler, 
of 
Vienna, 
a 
translation 
of 
whose 
work 
on 
the 
characteristics 
of 
the 
neurotic 
character 
is 
offered 
in 
the 
following 
pages. 


The 
distinctive 
feature 
of 
Adler's 
approach 
to 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
neurotic 
character 
traits 
is 
that 
it 
approaches 
from 
the 
organic 
rather 
than 
from 
the 
functional 
side 
and 
in 
this 
way, 
I 
think, 
affords 
a 
very 
valuable 
viewpoint 
because 
it 
tends 
to 
bring 
together 
the 
organicist 
and 
the 
functionalist, 
who 
have 
been 
too 
long 
separated 
by 
the 
misconception 
of 
irreconcilable 
differences 
between 
mind 
and 
body. 
No 
small 
part 
of 
the 
opposition 
to 
the 
whole 
psychological 
movement, 
as 
represented 
in 
psychoanalysis, 
has 
come 
from 
the" 
inability 
of 
the 
man 
who 
has 
been 
brought 
up 
to 
look 
at 
things 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
internist 
to 
be 
able 
to 
accept 
many 
of 
the 
clinical 
observations 
which 
were 
offered 
and 
which 
tended 
to 
show 
the 
development 
of 
clearly 
organic 
disorders 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a 
disturbance 
in 
the 
psyche. 
Adler's 
approach 
to 
the 
psychoanalytic 
problems 
is 
admirably 
calculated 
to 
break 
down 
such 
prejudices. 


In 
this 
book, 
however, 
the 
working 
out 
of 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
various 
neurotic 
character 
traits 
has 
been 
by 
ringing 
the 
changes 
on 
the 
basic 
formulation 
of 
what 
Adler 
calls 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
It 
is 
as 
if 
the 
neurotic 
said 
to 
himself, 
"I 
wish 
to 
be 
a 
complete 
man." 
This 
protest 
arises 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
and 
an 
effort 
upon 
the 
part 
of 
the 
neurotic 
to 
correct 
this 
feeling, 
which 
he 
does 
by 
so 
ordering 
his 
life, 
so 
regulating 
his 
every 
act 
that 
he 
may 
find 
that 
security 
of 
which 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
has 
robbed 
him. 
This 
is 
the 
fictitious 
goal 
of 
the 
neurotic 
and 
the 
fundamental 
and 
ultimate 
cause 
of 
his 
symptoms 
when 
he 
is 
no 
longer 
able 
to 
succeed, 



when 
failure 
threatens 
in 
his 
efforts 
to 
deal 
with 
reality. 


For 
Adler 
the 
neurosis 
or 
the 
psychosis 
is 
comparable 
to 
the 
work 
of 
art, 
but 
has 
been 
built 
up 
in 
response 
to 
a 
fictitious 
goal 
which 
collects 
and 
unites 
into 
a 
group 
those 
psychic 
elements 
of 
which 
it 
can 
make 
use, 
collecting 
only 
those 
which 
promise 
results 
in 
the 
effort 
at 
the 
attainment 
of 
security. 
The 
attempt 
to 
attain 
to 
the 
maximation 
of 
his 
ego 
fails 
because 
directed 
along 
a 
false 
path. 
The 
neurosis 
or 
psychosis 
is 
therefore 
a 
constructive 
creation, 
a 
compensation 
product, 
which, 
however, 
fails 
because 
of 
its 
false 
direction. 


All 
this 
is 
very 
psychological 
and 
does 
not 
bear 
out 
what 
I 
have 
said 
about 
it 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
Adler's 
approach 
is 
from 
the 
organic 
side. 
This 
particular 
book, 
however, 
stresses 
the 
psychological 
formula. 
In 
his 
earlier 
work 
on 
organ 
inferiority 
the 
organic 
basis 
of 
this 
psychological 
formulation 
is 
founded. 
The 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
which 
underlies 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
has 
its 
raison 
d'etre 
in 
an 
inferior 
organ. 


In 
this 
work 
he 
has 
gone 
to 
considerable 
extent 
in 
working 
over 
the 
psychological 
characteristics 
of 
persons 
who 
have 
had 
demonstrably 
inferior 
organs, 
either 
clinically 
evident 
or 
showing 
up 
at 
autopsy. 
From 
this 
work 
he 
believes 
he 
has 
been 
able 
to 
show 
that 
the 
predominant 
traits 
of 
character 
are 
the 
result 
of 
an 
effort 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
individual 
to 
overcome 
a 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
resulting 
from 
an 
inferior 
organ. 
Many 
examples 
might 
be 
given, 
and 
in 
fact 
they 
come 
within 
the 
ken 
of 
every 
one, 
which 
demonstrate 
the 
validity 
of 
this 
point 
of 
view. 
A 
classical 
example 
is 
that 
of 
Demosthenes, 
a 
stammerer, 
who 
became 
the 
greatest 
orator 
of 
Greece. 
Adler 
believes 
that 
defects 
of 
this 
sort 
nucleate, 
so 
to 
say, 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
and 
force 
the 
individual 
to 
make 
supreme 
efforts 
to 
overcome 
his 
particular 
defect 
and 
in 
this 
way, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
these 
efforts, 
the 
inferior 
organ, 
by 
the 
development 
of 
a 
highly 
differentiated 
nervous 
superstructure, 
may 
actually 
become 
supernormal, 
a 
result 
which 
we 
are 
familiar 
with, 
for 
example, 
in 
the 
remarkable 
facility 
with 
which 
blind 
people 
gain 
information 
through 
their 
supersensitized 
touch 
organs. 
In 
other 
words, 
to 
use 
the 
language 
of 
current 
psychoanalysis, 
the 
organ 
inferiority 
is 
the 
basic 
factor 
of 
what 
the 
Freudians 
refer 
to 
as 
the 
conflict. 


These 
two 
works 
of 
Adler' 
s, 
therefore, 
give 
the 
organic 
basis 
and 
the 
psychological 
elaboration 
of 
his 
opinions. 
The 
neurotic 
constitution 
founds 
in 
an 
inferior 
organ, 
the 
inferior 
organ 
produces 
a 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
the 



feeling 
of 
inferiority 
the 
masculine 
protest 
becomes 
the 
fictitious 
goal 
of 
the 
neurotic, 
whose 
symptoms 
result 
from 
an 
effort 
to 
mould 
reality 
along 
this 
fake 
pathway. 


To 
those 
who 
follow 
Adler 
through 
the 
various 
ramifications 
of 
his 
hypothesis, 
who 
read 
sympathetically 
his 
numerous 
case 
reports 
which 
he 
offers 
to 
substantiate 
his 
views, 
there 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
but 
that 
the 
angle 
from 
which 
he 
looks 
at 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
neuroses 
and 
the 
psychoses 
lets 
us 
see 
new 
aspects 
of 
these 
phenomena 
which 
are 
exceedingly 
helpful 
to 
us 
in 
our 
effort 
to 
grasp 
their 
meanings. 
It 
will 
also 
be 
perfectly 
evident 
that 
the 
helpfulness 
of 
the 
Adler 
theories 
is 
in 
the 
orientation 
which 
the 
physician 
gets 
towards 
the 
problem 
presented 
by 
the 
patient, 
whether 
he 
approach 
it 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
internist 
or 
of 
the 
psychologist. 
Adler's 
theories 
are 
admirably 
calculated 
to 
help 
the 
internist 
to 
grasp 
the 
possibilities 
of 
organ 
inferiority 
as 
they 
may 
affect 
the 
psyche 
and 
to 
help 
the 
psychoanalyst 
to 
grasp 
the 
origin 
and 
meanings 
of 
the 
neurosis 
as 
he 
sees 
it 
at 
the 
psychological 
level 
and 
perhaps 
to 
see 
more 
clearly 
upon 
what 
his 
limitations 
are 
based. 
In 
any 
event 
the 
two 
groups 
of 
physicians, 
heretofore 
separated 
all 
too 
far, 
both 
in 
theory 
and 
practice, 
may 
find 
in 
Adler's 
views 
a 
common 
ground 
upon 
which 
to 
meet.

CHAPTER 
I 
THE 
ORIGIN 
AND 
DEVELOPMENT 
OF 
THE 
FEELING 
OF 
INFERIORITY 
AND 
THE 
CONSEQUENCES 
THEREOF 


THE 
facts 
established 
through 
my 
study 
of 
somatic 
inferiority 
(vide 
Studie, 
I.e.) 
concerned 
themselves 
with 
the 
causes, 
the 
behaviour, 
the 
manifestations 
and 
altered 
mode 
of 
activity 
of 
inferiorily 
developed 
organs 
and 
has 
led 
me 
to 
assume 
the 
idea 
of 
" 
compensation 
through 
the 
central 
nervous 
system 
" 
with 
which 
were 
linked 
certain 
discussions 
of 
the 
subject 
of 
psychogenesis. 


There 
came 
to 
light 
a 
remarkable 
relationship 
between 
somatic 
inferiority 
and 
psychic 
overcompensation, 
so 
that 
I 
gained 
a 
fundamental 
viewpoint, 
namely, 
that 
the 
realization 
of 
somatic 
inferiority 
by 
the 
individual 
becomes 
for 
him 
a 
permanent 
impelling 
force 
for 
the 
development 
of 
his 
psyche. 


Physiologically 
there 
results 
from 
this 
a 
reenforcement 
of 
the 
nerve 
tracts, 
both 
quantitatively 
and 
qualitatively, 
whereby 
a 
concomitant 
original 
inferiority 
of 
these 
tracts 
is 
enabled 
to 
reveal 
in 
a 
composite 
picture 
its 
tectonic 
and 
functional 
peculiarities. 


The 
psychic 
phase 
of 
this 
compensation 
and 
overcompensation 
can 
only 
be 
disclosed 
by 
means 
of 
psychologic 
investigation 
and 
analysis. 


As 
I 
have 
given 
a 
detailed 
description 
of 
organ-inferiority 
as 
the 
etiology 
of 
the 
neuroses 
in 
my 
former 
contributions, 
especially 
in 
the 
" 
Studie," 
in 
the 
" 
Aggressionstrieb," 
in 
' 
Psychischen 
Hermaphroditismus," 
in 
the 
"' 
Neurotischen 
Disposition 
" 
and 
in 
the 
' 
Psychischen 
Behandlung 
der 
Trigeminusneuralgie," 
I 
may 
in 
the 
present 
description 
confine 
myself 
to 
those 
points 
which 
promise 
a 
further 
elucidation 
of 
the 
relationship 
between 
somatic-inferiority 
and 
psychic 
compensation 
and 
which 
are 
of 
importance 
in 
the 
study 
of 
the 
neurotic 
character. 


Summarizing, 
I 
lay 
stress 
on 
the 
fact 
that 
organ-inferiority, 
as 
described 
by 
me, 
includes 
the 
incompleteness 
in 
such 
organs, 
the 
frequently 
demonstrable 
arrests 
of 
development 
or 
functional 
maturity, 
the 
functional 
failure 
in 
the 
postfetal 
period 
and 
the 
fetal 
character 
of 
organs 
and 
systems 
of 
organs; 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
the 
accentuation 
of 
their 
developmental 
tendency 
in 



the 
presence 
of 
compensatory 
and 
coordinating 
forces 
and 
the 
frequent 
bringing 
about 
of 
increased 
functional 
activity. 
One 
may 
easily 
detect 
in 
every 
instance 
from 
observation 
of 
the 
child 
and 
from 
the 
anamneses 
of 
the 
adult 
that 
the 
possession 
of 
definitely 
inferior 
organs 
is 
reflected 
upon 
the 
psyche 
and 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
lower 
the 
self-esteem, 
to 
raise 
the 
child's 
psychological 
uncertainty; 
but 
it 
is 
just 
out 
of 
this 
lowered 
self-esteem 
that 
there 
arises 
the 
struggle 
for 
self-assertion 
which 
assumes 
forms 
much 
more 
intense 
than 
one 
would 
expect. 
As 
the 
compensated 
inferior 
organ 
gains 
in 
the 
scope 
of 
activity 
both 
qualitatively 
and 
quantitatively 
and 
acquires 
protective 
means 
from 
itself 
as 
well 
as 
from 
the 
entire 
organism, 
the 
predisposed 
child 
in 
his 
sense 
of 
inferiority 
selects 
out 
of 
his 
psychic 
resources 
expedients 
for 
the 
raising 
of 
his 
own 
value 
which 
are 
frequently 
striking 
in 
nature 
and 
among 
which 
may 
be 
noted 
as 
occupying 
the 
most 
prominent 
places 
those 
of 
a 
neurotic 
and 
psychotic 
character. 


Ideas 
concerning 
innate 
inferiority, 
predisposition, 
and 
constitutional 
weakness 
may 
be 
found 
even 
in 
the 
very 
beginnings 
of 
scientific 
medicine. 
In 
leaving 
out 
of 
discussion 
here 
many 
noteworthy 
contributions, 
although 
they 
frequently 
contained 
fundamental 
viewpoints, 
we 
do 
so 
solely 
because 
the 
relationship 
between 
organic 
and 
psychic 
disease 
states, 
albeit 
dwelt 
upon, 
was 
never 
explained. 
In 
this 
class 
belong 
all 
viewpoints 
of 
pathology 
which 
are 
founded 
upon 
a 
general 
assumption 
of 
degeneracy. 
Stiller's 
theory 
of 
the 
asthenic 
habitus 
goes 
considerably 
further 
and 
almost 
attempts 
to 
establish 
etiological 
relationships. 
Anton's 
compensation 
theory 
confines 
itself 
all 
too 
closely 
to 
correlation 
systems 
within 
the 
eternal 
nervous 
system; 
nevertheless, 
he, 
as 
well 
as 
his 
talented 
pupil, 
Otto 
Gross, 
have 
made 
noteworthy 
attempts 
to 
bring 
about 
on 
this 
basis 
a 
clearer 
understanding 
of 
certain 
psychotic 
states. 
Bouchard's 
bradytrophy, 
the 
exudative 
diathesis 
described 
by 
Ponflick, 
Escherich, 
Czerny, 
Moro 
and 
Striimpel, 
and 
interpreted 
by 
them 
as 
a 
disease-producing 
diathesis, 
Comby's 
infantile 
arthritism. 
Kreibich's 
angio-neurotic 
diathesis, 
Heubner's 
lymphatism, 
Poltauf's 
status 
thymico-lymphaticus, 
Escherich's 
spasmophilia 
and 
HessEppinger's 
vagotonia 
are 
successful 
attempts 
of 
recent 
decades 
to 
describe 
disease 
states 
associated 
with 
congenital 
inferiority. 


All 
of 
them 
refer 
to 
heredity 
and 
infantile 
characteristics. 
But, 
although 
the 
vague 
and 
inconstant 
limits 
of 
the 
predispositions 
in 
question 
are 



emphasized 
by 
the 
authors 
themselves, 
the 
impression 
is 
not 
to 
be 
ignored 
that 
certain 
conspicuous 
types 
have 
been 
isolated 
which 
in 
the 
course 
of 
time 
will 
be 
brought 
within 
one 
large 
group, 
namely, 
that 
of 
the 
minus-variants. 
Of 
extreme 
importance 
for 
the 
understanding 
of 
congenital 
inferiority 
and 
predisposition 
to 
disease 
are 
the 
researches 
into 
the 
glands 
of 
internal 
secretion 
in 
which 
morphologic 
as 
well 
as 
functional 
deviations 
have 
been 
discovered, 
e.g., 
the 
thyroids, 
the 
parathyroids, 
the 
sex 
glands, 
the 
chromaffin 
system 
and 
the 
hypophysis. 
Considered 
from 
the 
standpoint 
of 
their 
organinferiorities 
the 
orientation 
of 
the 
composite 
picture 
becomes 
easier 
and 
the 
relationship 
to 
compensation 
and 
correlation 
in 
the 
economy 
of 
the 
entire 
body 
becomes 
clearer. 
Among 
the 
remaining 
investigators 
who 
took 
as 
the 
basis 
for 
their 
views 
not 
a 
primum-movens, 
but 
a 
combined 
influence 
of 
various 
organ 
inferiorities 
and 
mutual 
interaction 
of 
the 
same, 
Martius, 
above 
all, 
must 
be 
mentioned. 
In 
my 
contribution 
on 
" 
The 
Inferiority 
of 
Organs 
" 
(1907), 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
coordination 
of 
the 
coexisting 
inferiorities 
likewise 
appears 
prominently. 
The 
fact 
is 
not 
to 
be 
lightly 
evaluated 
that 
the 
simultaneously 
existing 
organ-inferiorities 
stand 
in 
relation 
to 
one 
another 
as 
if 
united 
by 
a 
secret 
bond. 


Bartel 
likewise 
has 
extended 
his 
theories 
concerning 
the 
status 
thymicolymphaticus, 
which 
represents 
a 
considerable 
advance 
in 
science, 
to 
such 
limits 
as 
to 
invade 
the 
boundaries 
of 
the 
systems 
of 
other 
authors. 
Kyrle, 
too, 
supporting 
himself 
by 
the 
newly 
discovered 
pathological 
findings, 
reached 
quite 
independently 
conclusions 
identical 
with 
mine, 
namely, 
that 
the 
coordination 
of 
the 
inferiority 
of 
the 
sexual 
apparatus 
with 
other 
organ-
inferiorities, 
though 
frequently 
only 
slightly 
developed, 
is 
nevertheless 
so 
often 
found 
to 
exist 
that 
I 
must 
maintain 
that 
there 
exist 
no 
organ-inferiorities 
without 
an 
accompanying 
defect 
in 
the 
sexual 
apparatus. 


Because 
of 
some 
future 
considerations 
I 
must 
also 
mention 
certain 
of 
the 
views 
of 
Freud 
who 
assumes 
a 
sexual 
constitution 
as 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
neuroses 
and 
psychoses, 
under 
which 
term 
he 
understands 
a 
qualitatively 
and 
quantitatively 
varying 
arrangement 
of 
partial 
sex 
impulses. 
This 
assumption 
simply 
corresponds 
to 
a 
postulate 
advanced 
by 
him 
for 
his 
other 
views. 
The 
development 
of 
perverse 
inclinations 
and 
their 
unsuccessful 
repression 
into 
the 
unconscious 
furnishes, 
according 
to 
him, 
the 
picture 
of 
the 
neurosis, 
and 
in 
itself 
forms 
the 
primary 
cause 
for 
the 
neurotic 
psyche. 
We 
shall 
see 
from 



our 
considerations 
that 
perversion 
so 
far 
as 
it 
reaches 
development 
in 
the 
neurosis 
and 
psychosis 
is 
not 
dependent 
upon 
a 
connate 
impulse, 
but 
that 
it 
arises 
from 
the 
striving 
towards 
a 
fictitious 
goal 
in 
connection 
with 
which 
the 
repression 
takes 
place 
as 
a 
by-product 
under 
the 
pressure 
of 
the 
self-
consciousness. 


That 
which, 
however, 
is 
to 
be 
taken 
cognizance 
of 
biologically 
in 
an 
originally 
abnormal 
sexual 
conduct, 
namely, 
the 
greater 
or 
lesser 
sensitiveness, 
the 
heightened 
or 
lowered 
reflex 
activity, 
the 
functional 
valency 
as 
well 
as 
the 
compensatory 
psychic 
superstructure 
indicates 
directly 
as 
I 
have 
shown 
in 
my 
" 
Studie 
" 
a 
congenital 
defect 
of 
the 
sexual 
organ. 


Concerning 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
predisposition 
to 
disease 
dependent 
upon 
organ-inferiority 
there 
exists 
a 
unanimity 
of 
opinion. 
The 
standpoint 
assumed 
by 
me 
("Studie," 
I.e.) 
emphasizes 
more 
strongly 
than 
does 
that 
of 
other 
authors, 
the 
assurance 
of 
an 
adjustment 
through 
compensation. 
With 
the 
release 
from 
the 
maternal 
organism 
there 
begins 
for 
these 
inferior 
organs 
or 
systems 
of 
organs 
the 
struggle 
with 
the 
outside 
world, 
which 
must 
of 
necessity 
ensue 
and 
which 
is 
initiated 
with 
greater 
vehemence 
than 
in 
the 
more 
normally 
developed 
apparatus. 
This 
struggle 
is 
accompanied 
by 
greater 
mortality 
and 
morbidity 
rates. 
This 
fetal 
character, 
however, 
at 
the 
same 
time 
furnishes 
the 
increased 
possibility 
for 
compensation 
and 
overcompensation, 
increases 
the 
adaptability 
to 
ordinary 
and 
extraordinary 
resistances 
and 
assures 
the 
attainment 
of 
new 
and 
higher 
forms, 
new 
and 
higher 
accomplishments. 


Thus 
the 
inferior 
organs 
furnish 
the 
inexhaustible 
material 
by 
means 
of 
which 
the 
organism 
continuously 
seeks 
to 
reach 
a 
better 
accord 
with 
the 
altered 
conditions 
of 
life 
through 
adaptation, 
repudiation, 
and 
improvement. 
Its 
hypervalency 
is 
deeply 
rooted 
in 
the 
compulsion 
of 
a 
constant 
training, 
in 
the 
variability 
and 
greater 
tendency 
to 
growth, 
frequently 
associated 
with 
inferior 
organs, 
and 
in 
the 
more 
facile 
evolution 
of 
the 
appertaining 
nervous 
and 
psychic 
complexes, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
introspection 
and 
concentration 
bestowed 
on 
them. 
The 
evils 
of 
constitutional 
inferiority 
manifest 
themselves 
in 
the 
most 
varied 
diseases 
and 
predispositions 
to 
disease. 


At 
times 
various 
somatic 
or 
mental 
disabilities 
develop, 
at 
other 
times 
an 
over-irritability 
of 
the 
nerve 
tracts, 
then 
again 
clumsiness 
of 
manner, 
ungainliness, 
precocity. 
A 
host 
of 
childhood 
defects 
cooperate 
with 
the 



predisposition 
to 
disease 
and 
form 
a 
close 
union, 
as 
I 
have 
shown, 
with 
the 
organic 
or 
functional 
inferiority. 
Strabismus, 
anomalies 
of 
refraction 
of 
the 
visual 
apparatus 
or 
photophobia 
with 
its 
train 
of 
symptoms, 
deaf 
mutism, 
stuttering 
and 
other 
defects 
of 
speech, 
difficulty 
of 
hearing, 
the 
organic 
and 
psychic 
defects 
which 
go 
with 
adenoid 
vegetations, 
the 
complete 
aprosexia, 
the 
frequent 
affections 
of 
the 
sensory 
organs, 
of 
the 
respiratory 
and 
digestive 
tracts, 
striking 
ugliness 
and 
deformities, 
peripheral 
stigmata 
of 
degeneration 
and 
naevi 
which 
may 
indicate 
more 
profound 
organinferiorities 
(Adler, 
Schmidt). 
Hydrocephalus, 
rickets, 
anomalies 
of 
stature 
as 
scoliosis, 
round 
shoulders, 
genu 
varus 
or 
valgus, 
pes 
varus 
or 
valgus, 
a 
protracted 
incontinence 
of 
faeces 
and 
urine, 
malformations 
of 
the 
genitals, 
results 
of 
small 
arteries 
(Virchow) 
and 
the 
numerous 
consequences 
of 
defects 
of 
the 
internal 
secretory 
glands 
as 
described 
by 
Wagner 
v. 
Yauregg, 
Frankl 
v. 
Hochwert, 
Chvostek, 
Bartel, 
Escherich, 
Pineles 
and 
others, 
all 
of 
which 
reveal 
in 
their 
great 
abundance, 
in 
the 
variety 
of 
their 
combinations, 
the 
large 
sphere 
of 
disease 
manifestations 
as 
disclosed 
to 
the 
physician 
through 
an 
understanding 
of 
organ-inferiority. 
It 
was 
especially 
pediatrists 
and 
pathologists 
who 
first 
noted 
these 
relationships. 
But 
the 
concept 
of 
degeneracy 
has 
likewise 
become 
of 
increasing 
importance 
to 
neurology 
and 
psychiatry. 
The 
line 
of 
advance 
stretches 
all 
the 
way 
from 
Morel's 
theory 
of 
the 
stigmata 
of 
degeneration 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
nervous 
diseases 
from 
the 
standpoint 
of 
an 
inferior 
constitution. 
We 
need 
only 
consider 
the 
statistical 
study 
of 
Thiemich-Birks 
and 
Potpeschnigg's 
contributions 
(cited 
by 
Gott) 
concerning 
the 
fate 
of 
children 
who 
were 
treated 
in 
the 
first 
and 
second 
years 
of 
their 
lives 
for 
tetanoid 
convulsions. 
Of 
these 
children 
only 
a 
small 
number 
became 
entirely 
well. 
In 
most 
instances 
there 
were 
found 
later 
definite 
signs 
of 
somatic 
and 
psychic 
inferiority, 
psychopathic 
and 
neuropathic 
characteristics. 
As 
such, 
these 
authors 
mention 
infantilism, 
squints, 
difficulty 
of 
hearing, 
speech 
defects, 
feeble-mindedness, 
disturbances 
of 
sleep, 
pavor 
nocturnus, 
somnambulism, 
enuresis, 
exaggerated 
reflexes, 
tics, 
paroxysms 
of 
rage, 
truancy, 
timidity, 
pathological 
lying 
and 
habitual 
fugues. 


Gott 
as 
well 
as 
other 
authors 
reached 
the 
conclusion 
that 
in 
spasmophilic 
children 
there 
exists 
a 
predisposition 
to 
severe 
neurotic 
and 
psychopathic 
states. 
Czerny 
and 
others 
maintain 
that 
a 
similar 
relationship 
may 
be 
found 
in 
children 
suffering 
from 
gastro-intestinal 
disorders. 



Bartel 
was 
able 
to 
discover 
among 
suicides 
a 
considerable 
preponderance 
of 
the 
status 
thymicolymphaticus, 
especially 
a 
hypoplasia 
of 
the 
sexual 
organs. 
The 
existence 
of 
somatic 
inferiority 
among 
juvenile 
suicides 
was 
shown 
by 
me, 
Netslitzky 
and 
others. 
Frankly 
Hochwert 
described 
states 
of 
excitement, 
irritability 
and 
hallucinatory 
confusion, 
in 
tetany. 
French 
writers 
(cited 
from 
Pfaundler) 
ascribe 
to 
the 
torpid 
habitus 
of 
children, 
moroseness, 
indolence, 
sleepiness, 
distractibility, 
stupidity 
and 
phlegmatism, 
to 
the 
erotistic 
type, 
restlessness, 
liveliness, 
irritability, 
precocity, 
moodiness, 
affectivity, 
unsociability, 
peculiarity 
of 
disposition 
and 
one-sided 
development. 
Pfaundler 
emphasizes 
the 
harassing, 
tormenting 
and 
painful 
influences 
to 
which 
defective 
children 
are 
subject 
as 
a 
result 
of 
skin 
eruptions, 
colic, 
disturbances 
of 
sleep 
and 
functional 
anomalies. 
Czerny, 
who 
called 
attention 
to 
the 
relationship 
between 
intestinal 
disturbances 
of 
children 
and 
neuroses, 
emphasizes 
especially 
the 
importance 
of 
psychotherapy 
in 
children 
who 
became 
neurotic 
in 
the 
course 
of 
constitutional 
diseases. 
Only 
recently 
Hamburger 
has 
thrown 
light 
upon 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
ambitions 
in 
neurotic 
children, 
while 
Stransky 
showed 
the 
relation 
between 
myopathy 
and 
psychic 
manifestations. 


These 
brief 
references 
give 
us 
an 
insight 
into 
the 
attempts 
of 
the 
present 
day 
scientific 
trends 
to 
emphasize 
and 
maintain 
the 
relation 
between 
psychic 
anomalies 
in 
childhood 
and 
constitutional 
inferiority. 
The 
first 
comprehensive 
fundamental 
views 
concerning 
this 
relation 
were 
published 
by 
me 
in 
the 
Studie," 
wherein 
I 
showed 
how 
the 
inferior 
organ 
constantly 
endeavors 
to 
make 
a 
very 
special 
demand 
upon 
the 
interest 
and 
attention. 
I 
was 
able 
to 
prove 
in 
this 
and 
other 
contributions 
to 
what 
extent 
inferiority 
of 
an 
organ 
constantly 
shows 
its 
influence 
on 
the 
psyche 
in 
action, 
in 
thought, 
in 
dreams, 
in 
the 
choice 
of 
a 
vocation 
and 
in 
artistic 
inclinations 
and 
capabilities.

The 
existence 
of 
an 
inferior 
organ 
demands 
a 
kind 
of 
training 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
appertaining 
nerve 
tracts 
and 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
psychic 
superstructure 
which 
would 
render 
the 
latter 
active 
in 
a 
compensatory 
manner 
when 
a 



possibility 
for 
compensation 
exists. 
In 
such 
an 
event, 
however, 
we 
must 
likewise 
find 
a 
reenforcement 
in 
the 
psychic 
superstructure 
of 
certain 
allied 
points 
of 
contact 
which 
the 
inferior 
organ 
has 
with 
the 
outside 
world. 


To 
the 
originally 
inferior 
organ 
of 
vision 
corresponds 
a 
reenforced 
visual 
psyche; 
a 
defective 
digestive 
apparatus 
will 
be 
accompanied 
by 
a 
greater 
psychic 
capability 
in 
all 
nutritional 
directions, 
as 
gourmondism, 
acquisitiveness, 
and 
where 
it 
concerns 
money 
equivalents, 
stinginess 
and 
greed, 
will 
be 
manifested 
to 
an 
extraordinary 
degree. 


The 
ability 
of 
the 
compensating 
nervous 
system 
will 
manifest 
itself 
through 
qualified 
reflexes 
(Adler) 
and 
conditioned 
reflexes 
(Bickel) 
by 
means 
of 
sensitive 
reactions 
and 
exaggerated 
sensitiveness. 
The 
compensating 
psychic 
superstructure 
will 
bring 
about 
an 
accentuated 
manifestation 
of 
the 
psychic 
phenomena 
of 
presentiments 
and 
forethoughts 
and 
their 
effective 
factors 
such 
as 
memory, 
intuition, 
introspection, 
analysis, 
attention, 
hypersensitiveness, 
in 
brief, 
of 
all 
the 
fortifying 
psychic 
forces. 
To 
these 
reassuring 
forces 
belong 
also 
the 
fixation 
and 
accentuation 
of 
those 
traits 
which 
form 
useful 
guiding 
principles 
in 
the 
chaos 
of 
life, 
thus 
diminishing 
the 
feeling 
of 
uncertainty. 


The 
neurotic 
individual 
is 
derived 
from 
this 
sphere 
of 
uncertainty 
and 
in 
his 
childhood 
is 
under 
the 
pressure 
of 
his 
constitutional 
inferiority. 
In 
most 
cases 
this 
may 
be 
easily 
detected. 
In 
other 
cases 
the 
patient 
behaves 
as 
if 
he 
were 
inferior. 
In 
all 
cases, 
however, 
his 
striving 
and 
thinking 
are 
built 
upon 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority. 
This 
feeling 
must 
always 
be 
understood 
in 
a 
relative 
sense, 
as 
the 
outgrowth 
of 
the 
individual's 
relation 
to 
his 
environment 
or 
to 
his 
strivings. 
He 
has 
constantly 
been 
drawing 
comparisons 
between 
himself 
and 
others, 
at 
first 
with 
his 
father, 
as 
the 
strongest 
in 
the 
family, 
sometimes 
with 
his 
mother, 
his 
brothers 
and 
sisters, 
later 
with 
every 
person 
with 
whom 
he 
comes 
into 
contact. 
Upon 
closer 
analysis, 
one 
finds 
that 
every 
child, 
especially 
the 
one 
less 
favored 
by 
nature, 
has 
made 
a 
careful 
estimate 
of 
his 
own 
value. 
The 
constitutionally 
inferior 
child, 
the 
unattractive 
child, 
the 
child 
too 
strictly 
reared, 
the 
pampered 
child, 
all 
of 
whom 
we 
may 
align 
as 
being 
predisposed 
to 
the 
development 
of 
a 
neurosis, 
seek 
more 
diligently 
than 
does 
the 
normal 
child 
to 
avoid 
the 
evils 
of 
their 
existence. 
They 
soon 
long 
to 
banish 
into 
a 
distant 
future 
the 
fate 
which 
confronts 
them. 
In 
order 
to 
bring 
this 
about, 
he, 
the 
defective 
child, 
requires 



an 
expedient 
which 
enables 
him 
to 
keep 
before 
his 
eyes 
a 
fixed 
picture 
in 
the 
vicissitudes 
of 
life 
and 
the 
uncertainty 
of 
his 
existence. 
He 
turns 
to 
the 
construction 
of 
this 
expedient. 
He 
sums 
up 
in 
his 
self-estimation 
all 
evils, 
considers 
himself 
incompetent, 
inferior, 
degraded, 
insecure. 
And 
in 
order 
to 
find 
a 
guiding 
principle 
he 
takes 
as 
a 
second 
fixed 
point 
his 
father 
or 
mother 
who 
endowed 
him 
with 
all 
the 
attributes 
of 
life. 


And 
in 
adjusting 
this 
guiding 
principle 
to 
his 
thinking 
and 
acting, 
in 
his 
endeavors 
to 
raise 
himself 
to 
the 
level 
of 
his 
(all-powerful) 
father, 
even 
to 
the 
point 
of 
surpassing 
the 
latter, 
he 
has 
quite 
removed 
himself 
with 
one 
mighty 
bound 
from 
reality 
and 
is 
suspended 
in 
the 
meshes 
of 
a 
fiction. 


Similar 
observations 
may 
also 
be 
made 
in 
a 
lesser 
degree 
among 
normal 
children. 
They 
too 
desire 
to 
be 
great, 
to 
be 
strong, 
to 
rule 
as 
the 
father, 
and 
are 
guided 
by 
this 
objective. 
Their 
conduct, 
their 
psychical 
and 
physical 
attitude 
is 
constantly 
directed 
towards 
this 
goal, 
so 
that 
one 
may 
almost 
detect 
a 
true 
imitation, 
an 
identical 
psychic 
gesture. 


Example 
becomes 
the 
guide 
to 
the 
"masculine" 
goal, 
so 
long 
as 
the 
masculinity 
is 
not 
doubted. 
Should 
the 
idea 
of 
"the 
masculine 
goal" 
become 
unacceptable 
to 
girls, 
then 
there 
takes 
place 
a 
change 
of 
form 
of 
this 
"masculine" 
guiding 
principle. 
One 
can 
scarcely 
evaluate 
this 
phenomenon 
in 
a 
more 
correct 
way 
than 
by 
assuming 
that 
the 
necessary 
denial 
of 
the 
gratification 
of 
certain 
organic 
functions 
forces 
the 
child 
from 
the 
first 
hour 
of 
his 
extrauterine 
life 
into 
assuming 
a 
combative 
attitude 
towards 
his 
environment. 
From 
this 
result 
tensions 
and 
accentuations 
of 
certain 
organically 
acquired 
abilities 
c'est 
la 
guerre! 
as 
I 
have 
described 
them 
in 
my 
" 
Studie 
" 
and 
the 
" 
Aggressionstrieb." 
(* 
Adler, 
" 
Der 
Aggressionstrieb 
im 
Lichen 
und 
in 
der 
Neurose," 
1. 
c. 
) 


In 
the 
temporary 
denials 
and 
discomforts 
which 
the 
first 
years 
of 
childhood 
bring 
with 
them, 
one 
must 
seek 
the 
impulse 
for 
the 
development 
of 
a 
host 
of 
common 
traits 
of 
character. 
Above 
all 
the 
child 
learns, 
in 
his 
weakness 
and 
helplessness, 
in 
his 
anxiety 
and 
manifold 
shortcomings 
to 
value 
an 
expedient 
which 
assures 
him 
of 
the 
help 
and 
support 
of 
his 
relatives 
and 
guarantees 
their 
concern. 
In 
his 
negativistic 
behavior, 
in 
his 
obstinacy 
and 
refractoriness, 
he 
often 
finds 
a 
gratification 
of 
his 
consciousness 
of 
his 
own 
powers, 
thus 
ridding 
himself 
of 
the 
painful 
realization 
of 
his 
inferiority. 
Both 
mainsprings 
of 
the 
child's 
behavior, 
obstinacy 
and 
obedience 
(Adler, 



‘Trotz 
and 
Gehorsam’) 
guarantee 
to 
him 
an 
accentuation 
of 
his 
feeling 
of 
ego-consciousness 
and 
assist 
him 
in 
groping 
his 
way 
towards 
the 
masculine 
goal 
or, 
as 
we 
wished 
to 
adduce 
before, 
towards 
the 
equivalent 
of 
this. 
The 
awakening 
self-consciousness 
is 
always 
being 
suppressed 
in 
constitutionally 
inferior 
children, 
their 
self-esteem 
is 
lowered 
because 
their 
capacity 
for 
gratification 
is 
much 
more 
limited. 


Let 
us 
consider 
the 
numerous 
restrictions, 
the 
courses 
of 
treatment 
and 
the 
sufferings 
of 
children 
ill 
with 
gastro-intestinal 
derangements; 
the 
effeminacy 
and 
fastidiousness 
seen 
in 
the 
anaemic, 
weakly 
children 
suffering 
from 
respiratory 
disorders; 
the 
itching 
and 
tortures 
of 
those 
afflicted 
with 
prurigo 
and 
other 
exanthemata; 
the 
many 
degrading 
defects 
of 
childhood; 
the 
fear 
of 
contamination 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
parents 
of 
such 
children 
which 
often 
leads, 
as 
do 
the 
frequent 
difficulties 
in 
their 
bringing 
up 
in 
their 
school 
progress 
as 
well 
as 
the 
stubbornness 
of 
these 
children 
to 
an 
isolation 
and 
misunderstanding 
on 
the 
part 
of 
their 
comrades 
and 
within 
the 
family 
circle. 
In 
the 
same 
manner 
the 
self-consciousness 
is 
injured 
by 
rachitic 
clumsiness, 
congenital 
obesity 
and 
the 
lesser 
grades 
of 
mental 
backwardness. 
The 
child 
usually 
explains 
his 
difficulty 
by 
the 
assumption 
of 
a 
neglect, 
a 
slight 
by 
the 
parents, 
especially 
as 
it 
occurs 
in 
later 
children 
or 
in 
the 
youngest, 
occasionally 
even 
in 
the 
first 
born. 


This 
hostile 
aggression, 
reenforced 
and 
accentuated 
in 
constitutionally 
inferior 
children, 
becomes 
confluent 
with 
his 
effort 
to 
become 
as 
great 
and 
strong 
as 
the 
strongest 
and 
thrusts 
forward 
activities 
which 
lie 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
infantile 
ambition. 
All 
later 
trains 
of 
thought 
and 
activities 
of 
the 
neurotic 
are 
constructed 
similarly 
with 
his 
childhood 
wish 
phantasy. 
The 
" 
recurrence 
of 
the 
identical 
" 
(Nietzsche) 
is 
nowhere 
so 
well 
illustrated 
as 
in 
the 
neurotic. 
His 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
men 
and 
things, 
his 
uncertainty 
in 
the 
world 
force 
him 
to 
an 
accentuation 
of 
his 
guiding 
principles. 
To 
these 
he 
clings 
throughout 
life 
in 
order 
to 
orient 
himself 
in 
existence 
by 
means 
of 
his 
beliefs 
and 
superstitions, 
in 
order 
to 
overcome 
his 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
in 
order 
to 
rescue 
his 
sense 
of 
egoconsciousness, 
in 
order 
to 
possess 
a 
subterfuge 
to 
avoid 
a 
much 
dreaded 
degradation. 
Never 
has 
he 
succeeded 
so 
well 
in 
this 
as 
during 
his 
childhood. 
His 
guiding 
fiction 
which 
makes 
him 
behave 
as 
if 
he 
surpassed 
all 
others 
may 
therefore 
also 
bring 
about 
a 
form 
of 
conduct 
identical 
with 
that 
of 
the 
child. 



In 
such 
manner 
then 
the 
infantile 
gratifications 
become 
criteria 
and 
thus 
strengthen 
the 
guiding 
principle. 
It 
would 
be 
amiss 
to 
assume 
that 
only 
the 
neurotic 
exhibits 
such 
"guiding 
principles." 
The 
healthy 
individual 
would 
also 
have 
to 
do 
without 
orientation 
in 
the 
world 
if 
he 
did 
not 
arrange 
the 
cosmic 
picture 
and 
his 
experience 
according 
to 
some 
imaginary 
fiction. 
In 
hours 
of 
uncertainty 
these 
fictions 
come 
to 
the 
fore 
more 
distinctly 
and 
become 
the 
imperative 
influences 
dominating 
beliefs, 
ideals 
and 
free 
will; 
moreover 
they 
also 
act 
secretly 
in 
the 
unconscious 
like 
all 
other 
psychic 
mechanisms 
whose 
verbal 
image 
they 
represent 
in 
conscious 
thought. 
Logically 
considered 
they 
are 
to 
be 
regarded 
as 
abstractions, 
as 
simplifications, 
which 
have 
for 
their 
object 
the 
solution 
of 
life's 
difficulties 
in 
a 
manner 
analogous 
to 
that 
required 
for 
the 
simplest 
experiences. 
The 
original 
type 
of 
these 
simplest 
experiences, 
the 
mesh 
work 
of 
apperceptive 
memory, 
we 
found 
in 
studying 
the 
child's 
efforts 
to 
solve 
his 
difficulties. 
In 
dreams 
this 
form 
of 
apperception 
is 
still 
more 
obvious; 
we 
shall 
consider 
this 
subject 
later. 


The 
neurotic 
carries 
his 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
constantly 
with 
him. 
Hence 
his 
method 
of 
thinking 
by 
analogy 
is 
more 
strongly 
and 
clearly 
developed. 


His 
" 
misoneism 
" 
(Lombroso), 
his 
fear 
of 
the 
new, 
of 
decisions 
and 
tests, 
which 
is 
usually 
present, 
originates 
from 
the 
lack 
of 
analogy 
for 
these 
new 
conditions. 
He 
has 
chained 
himself 
so 
strongly 
to 
guiding 
principles, 
taken 
them 
so 
literally 
and 
sought 
to 
realize 
them 
only, 
that 
unconsciously 
he 
has 
become 
incapable 
of 
proceeding 
freely 
and 
without 
prejudice 
to 
the 
solution 
of 
real 
problems. 
Even 
the 
necessary 
limitations 
imposed 
by 
reality, 
where 
matters 
clash 
for 
want 
of 
room, 
do 
not 
impel 
him 
to 
reject 
his 
fiction 
because 
he 
is 
forced 
to 
suspend 
it, 
but 
only 
to 
alter 
it. 
Still 
more 
consequentially 
the 
psychotic 
patient 
strives 
to 
bring 
about 
a 
realization 
of 
his 
fiction. 
The 
neurotic 
in 
real 
life 
flounders 
in 
his 
self-created 
guiding 
principle 
and 
thus 
arrives 
at 
a 
splitting 
of 
the 
personality 
in 
seeking 
to 
do 
justice 
to 
both 
the 
real 
and 
the 
imaginary 
requirements. 
The 
form 
and 
content 
of 
the 
neurotic 
" 
guiding 
principle 
" 
originate 
from 
the 
impressions 
of 
the 
child 
who 
feels 
himself 
neglected. 
These 
impressions, 
which 
of 
necessity 
develop 
out 
of 
an 
original 
sense 
of 
inferiority, 
call 
forth 
an 
aggressive 
attitude 
in 
life, 
the 
object 
of 
which 
is 
the 
overcoming 
of 
the 
uncertainty. 
In 
this 
attitude 
of 
aggression 
all 
those 
efforts 
of 
the 
child 
which 
tend 
toward 
an 
elevation 
of 
his 
feeling 
of 



ego-consciousness 
find 
their 
place, 
successful 
efforts 
which 
prompt 
a 
repetition, 
unsuccessful 
ones 
which 
serve 
as 
mementoes 
for 
those 
goal-
preparing 
tendencies 
developed 
out 
of 
a 
conspicuous 
organic 
disease 
and 
which 
express 
themselves 
in 
a 
mass 
of 
psychic 
predispositions, 
as 
well 
as 
those 
observed 
in 
others. 
All 
the 
phenomena 
of 
the 
neuroses 
originate 
from 
these 
predisposing 
means 
which 
tend 
toward 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
final 
object, 
masculinity. 
They 
are 
mental 
predispositions 
always 
ready 
to 
initiate 
the 
struggle 
for 
ego-consciousness, 
they 
obey 
the 
command 
of 
the 
guiding 
principle 
which 
seeks 
to 
realize 
itself 
through 
the 
channels 
of 
reactions 
lying 
ready 
at 
hand 
in 
childhood. 
In 
the 
developed 
neuroses 
the 
fiction 
stimulates 
all 
these 
predispositions 
whereupon 
they 
comport 
themselves 
as 
independent 
final 
purposes. 
Anxiety, 
which 
formerly 
sought 
to 
furnish 
assurance 
against 
being 
alone, 
against 
underestimation, 
against 
the 
feeling 
of 
insignificance, 
is 
hypostasized; 
the 
compulsion, 
originally 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
fiction 
to 
preserve 
a 
manly 
behavior, 
becomes 
independent; 
in 
fainting, 
in 
paralysis, 
in 
the 
hysterical 
pains 
and 
functional 
disturbances, 
the 
pseudo-masochistic 
method 
of 
the 
patient 
is 
symbolically 
represented, 
in 
which 
he 
seeks 
to 
attract 
attention 
or 
to 
avoid 
a 
decision 
which 
is 
feared. 
The 
important 
role 
played 
by 
the 
neurotic 
uncertainty, 
as 
I 
have 
recognized 
and 
described 
it, 
leads 
to 
that 
sort 
of 
strengthening 
of 
the 
predisposition 
and 
its 
consequences 
which 
makes 
the 
originally 
unimportant 
phenomena 
of 
a 
functional 
nature 
assume 
the 
most 
astonishing 
exaggeration 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
inner 
exigency 
demands 
it. 


The 
gaze 
of 
the 
neurotic, 
on 
account 
of 
this 
feeling 
of 
uncertainty, 
is 
directed 
far 
into 
the 
future. 
All 
present 
existence 
is 
to 
him 
only 
a 
preparation. 
Moreover 
this 
circumstance 
is 
largely 
responsible 
for 
encouraging 
his 
dreaming 
proclivities 
and 
estranging 
him 
from 
the 
world 
of 
reality. 
As 
with 
religious 
persons 
his 
kingdom 
is 
not 
of 
this 
world 
and 
like 
them 
he 
cannot 
free 
himself 
from 
his 
self-created 
deity, 
the 
exaltation 
of 
his 
ego-
consciousness. 
A 
host 
of 
general 
traits 
of 
character 
of 
necessity 
develop 
in 
an 
individual 
thus 
turned 
away 
from 
reality. 


First 
of 
all 
must 
be 
mentioned 
the 
deep 
reverence 
in 
which 
are 
held 
the 
expedients 
which 
subserve 
the 
fiction. 
An 
individual 
of 
this 
type 
will 
as 
a 
rule 
manifest 
a 
carefully 
adjusted 
mode 
of 
behavior, 
exactness 
and 
pedantry, 
first 
of 
all, 
in 
order 
not 
to 
increase 
the 
great 
difficulties 
of 
life 
and 
secondly 
and 
principally, 
in 
order 
to 
distinguish 
himself 
from 
others 
in 
dress, 
in 
work, 



in 
morals, 
and 
thus 
acquire 
for 
himself 
a 
feeling 
of 
superiority. 
This 
exaggerated 
trait 
of 
character 
usually 
serves 
also 
to 
bring 
him 
face 
to 
face 
with 
the 
enemy, 
to 
furnish 
the 
opportunity 
tor 
a 
maturing 
of 
such 
situations 
as 
will 
bring 
him 
into 
conflict 
with 
his 
environment 
so 
that 
he 
finds 
occasion 
for 
giving 
vent 
to 
reproaches. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
these 
constant 
reproaches 
serve 
to 
keep 
alive 
his 
feeling, 
his 
attention, 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
people 
are 
neglecting 
him, 
that 
they 
are 
not 
taking 
him 
into 
account. 
This 
trait 
may 
be 
found 
even 
in 
the 
childhood 
of 
certain 
neurotics 
where 
it 
serves 
the 
purpose 
of 
putting 
some 
one 
at 
their 
service, 
say 
the 
mother, 
who 
must 
take 
care 
of 
their 
clothes 
every 
evening 
for 
a 
considerable 
length 
of 
time 
in 
a 
definitely 
prescribed 
manner. 
In 
a 
similarly 
remarkable 
manner, 
anxiety 
and 
timidity 
gain 
expression 
and 
I 
must 
adhere 
to 
the 
opinion, 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
other 
attempts 
at 
explanation, 
that 
the 
psychic 
phenomena 
of 
anxiety 
originate 
from 
an 
hallucinatory 
excitation 
of 
a 
predisposition 
which 
in 
childhood 
developed 
automatically 
from 
small 
beginnings 
as 
soon 
as 
a 
bodily 
injury 
was 
threatened, 
and 
which 
in 
later 
life, 
especially 
in 
the 
neuroses, 
is 
conditioned 
by 
the 
final 
goal, 
namely, 
to 
escape 
a 
lowering 
of 
ego-consciousness 
and 
to 
make 
oneself 
of 
service 
to 
others. 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
understand 
how 
all 
wishphantasies 
may 
attain 
an 
enormous 
degree, 
just 
as 
attainment 
seldom 
brings 
with 
it 
satisfaction. 
One 
may 
assume 
without 
fear 
of 
contradiction 
that 
a 
neurotic 
" 
wishes 
to 
have 
everything." 
This 
desire 
coincides 
with 
his 
" 
guiding 
fiction 
to 
become 
potent. 
If 
he 
draws 
back 
in 
horror 
before 
undertakings 
which 
promise 
advantage, 
as 
he 
usually 
does 
before 
crimes 
and 
immoral 
acts, 
it 
is 
because 
he 
entertains 
fears 
for 
the 
safety 
of 
his 
ego-
consciousness. 
For 
this 
reason 
he 
recoils 
in 
horror 
from 
lying, 
but 
in 
order 
to 
proceed 
with 
certainty 
and 
in 
order 
to 
preserve 
steadfastness 
he 
may 
harbor 
the 
thought 
that 
he 
is 
capable 
of 
great 
evils 
and 
crimes. 
That 
this 
obstinate 
pursuit 
of 
the 
fiction 
implies 
a 
social 
injury 
is 
obvious. 


The 
egoism 
of 
neurotics, 
their 
envy, 
their 
greed, 
frequently 
unconscious, 
their 
tendency 
to 
undervalue 
men 
and 
things, 
originate 
in 
their 
feeling 
of 
uncertainty 
and 
serve 
the 
purpose 
of 
assuring 
them, 
of 
guiding 
them 
and 
of 
spurring 
them 
on. 
As 
they 
are 
enveloped 
in 
phantasy 
and 
live 
in 
the 
future, 
their 
preoccupation 
is 
not 
to 
be 
wondered 
at. 
The 
variability 
of 
temper 
depends 
on 
the 
play 
of 
the 
phantasy 
which 
at 
one 
time 
awakens 
painful 
memories, 
at 
another 
fills 
with 
the 
enthusiasm 
of 
an 
expected 
triumph, 



analogous 
to 
the 
vacillations 
and 
doubts 
of 
the 
neurotic. 
In 
the 
same 
way 
special 
traits 
of 
character 
which 
are 
not 
foreign 
to 
the 
normal 
psyche 
appear 
to 
be 
directed 
by 
the 
hypnotizing 
goal 
and 
strengthened 
in 
this 
direction. 
Sexual 
precocity 
and 
falling 
in 
love 
are 
forms 
of 
expression 
for 
the 
heightened 
tendency 
to 
captivate. 
Masturbation, 
impotence 
and 
perverse 
excitements 
lie 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
guiding 
line 
of 
fear 
of 
a 
partner 
and 
fear 
of 
separation, 
along 
with 
which 
sadism 
represents 
the 
desire 
to 
play 
the 
" 
wild 
man 
" 
in 
order 
to 
overcome 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority. 
As 
the 
driving 
force 
and 
goal 
of 
the 
neurosis 
developing 
out 
of 
a 
constitutional 
inferiority, 
we 
have 
up 
to 
this 
point 
regarded 
the 
accentuation 
of 
ego-consciousness 
which 
constantly 
strives 
for 
expression 
with 
especial 
force. 
In 
doing 
so 
we 
have 
not 
ignored 
the 
fact 
that 
this 
is 
only 
a 
mode 
of 
expression 
of 
a 
striving 
and 
yearning 
whose 
beginnings 
are 
deeply 
rooted 
in 
human 
nature. 
The 
form 
of 
expression 
itself 
and 
the 
accentuation 
of 
this 
guiding 
thought, 
which 
may 
also 
be 
expressed 
by 
Nietzsche's 
" 
will 
to 
power," 
teaches 
us 
that 
there 
is 
an 
especial 
compensatory 
force 
at 
play, 
whose 
object 
it 
is 
to 
put 
an 
end 
to 
the 
inner 
uncertainty. 
By 
means 
of 
an 
unyielding 
formula, 
which 
usually 
presses 
to 
the 
surface 
of 
consciousness, 
the 
neurotic 
seeks 
to 
obtain 
the 
fulcrum 
whereby 
to 
lift 
the 
world 
off 
its 
hinges. 
It 
matters 
but 
little 
how 
much 
of 
this 
driving 
force 
becomes 
consciously 
known 
to 
the 
neurotic. 
The 
mechanism 
itself 
he 
never 
understands, 
neither 
is 
he 
able 
to 
explain 
and 
break 
down 
unaided 
his 
mode 
of 
apperception 
by 
means 
of 
analogy 
and 
the 
conduct 
resulting 
therefrom. 
This 
can 
only 
succeed 
by 
means 
of 
an 
analytic 
process 
which 
permits 
us 
to 
divine 
and 
understand 
his 
infantile 
analogy 
by 
means 
of 
abstraction, 
reduction 
and 
simplification. 
In 
this 
way 
one 
finds 
regularly 
apparent 
that 
the 
neurotic 
always 
apperceives 
after 
the 
analogy 
of 
a 
contrast, 
indeed, 
that 
usually 
he 
only 
recognizes 
and 
gives 
value 
to 
relations 
of 
contrast. 
This 
primitive 
mode 
of 
orientation 
in 
life 
which 
corresponds 
to 
the 
antithesis 
as 
set 
forth 
in 
the 
categories 
of 
Aristotle 
and 
to 
opposites 
in 
the 
Pythagorean 
table 
originates 
also 
in 
the 
feeling 
of 
uncertainty 
and 
illustrates 
a 
simple 
device 
of 
logic. 
What 
I 
have 
described 
as 
polar, 
hermaphroditic 
opposites, 
Lombroso 
as 
bipolar, 
Bleuler 
as 
ambivalent, 
leads 
to 
this 
same 
method 
of 
apperception 
which 
works 
according 
to 
the 
principal 
of 
opposites. 
One 
should 
not 
fall 
into 
the 
common 
error 
of 
regarding 
this 
as 
an 
essence 
of 
things, 
but 
must 
recognize 
in 
it 
the 
primitive 
method 
of 
procedure 
which 
measures 
a 
thing, 
a 
force, 
or 
an 
event, 
by 
an 
opposite 
which 
is 
fitted 
to 
it. 



The 
further 
the 
analysis 
proceeds 
the 
more 
distinct 
appears 
one 
of 
these 
opposites, 
the 
original 
form 
of 
which 
we 
have 
established 
as 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
and 
the 
maximation 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness. 
This 
only 
agrees 
with 
the 
primitive 
efforts 
of 
the 
child 
to 
orient 
himself 
in 
the 
world 
and 
to 
obtain 
certainty 
when 
tangible 
antitheses 
are 
encountered. 
Among 
these 
I 
have 
regularly 
found 
the 
following: 
(1). 
Above 
beneath. 
(2). 
Masculine 
feminine. 
One 
furthermore 
always 
finds 
an 
arrangement 
of 
memories, 
feelings 
and 
actions 
according 
to 
this 
type 
of 
antitheses 
in 
the 
sense 
the 
patient 
takes 
them 
(not 
always 
in 
the 
generally 
accepted 
sense), 
i.e., 
inferior 
beneath, 
feminine; 
powerful 
above, 
masculine. 
This 
grouping 
is 
important 
for 
it 
renders 
possible, 
because 
it 
can 
be 
conserved 
or 
falsified 
at 
will, 
the 
distortion 
of 
the 
cosmic 
picture, 
whereby 
the 
neurotic 
can 
always 
hold 
fast 
to 
his 
standpoint, 
namely, 
that 
of 
a 
neglected 
person, 
by 
rearrangement, 
by 
accentuation 
or 
by 
arbitrary 
changes. 
It 
lies 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
that 
in 
this 
process 
his 
constitutional 
inferiority 
comes 
to 
his 
assistance 
as 
well 
as 
his 
constantly 
increasing 
aggressive 
environment 
which 
is 
continually 
set 
into 
activity 
by 
the 
neurotic 
conduct 
of 
the 
patient., 


At 
times 
the 
neurotic 
is 
not 
fully 
conscious 
of 
his 
supposed 
or 
real 
defeat. 
It 
is 
then 
always 
found 
that 
it 
is 
his 
pride 
which 
prevents 
him 
from 
recognizing 
it. 
Nevertheless 
he 
acts 
as 
if 
he 
had 
appreciated 
the 
new 
degradation 
and 
the 
riddle 
of 
a 
nervous 
attack 
is 
often 
only 
solved 
when 
this 
fact 
is 
understood. 
The 
revelation 
of 
such 
repressed 
feelings 
is 
not 
of 
much 
therapeutic 
value, 
at 
least, 
it 
can 
only 
be 
of 
value 
when 
by 
means 
of 
it 
the 
connection 
with 
the 
infantile 
mechanism 
which 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
predisposition 
to 
the 
attack 
becomes 
apparent 
to 
the 
patient. 
At 
times 
there 
results 
even 
a 
seeming 
relapse 
which 
may 
be 
explained 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
patient 
directs 
his 
predispositions 
against 
the 
physician 
because 
the 
latter 
has 
injured 
his 
feelings 
of 
personal 
worth. 


There 
still 
remains 
to 
be 
answered 
one 
important 
question. 
On 
what 
does 
the 
patient 
base 
his 
feeling 
of 
inferiority? 
Inasmuch 
as 
the 
patient 
is 
only 
able 
to 
detect 
the 
possibility 
of 
relationship 
between 
disease 
predispositions 
and 
those 
organ-inferiorities 
which 
force 
themselves 
upon 
his 
attention 
he 
is 
constantly 
in 
the 
path 
of 
conjecture. 
He 
will 
for 
example 
not 
seek 
the 
reason 
for 
his 
inferiorities 
in 
the 
disturbances 
of 
the 
secretions 
of 
the 
glands, 
but 
will 
blame 
in 
a 
general 
way 
his 
weakness, 
his 
stunted 
growth, 
his 
sham 
education, 



the 
small 
size 
or 
anomalies 
of 
his 
genitals, 
lack 
of 
complete 
virility, 
his 
effeminacy, 
the 
feminine 
traits 
of 
a 
physical 
or 
psychic 
nature, 
his 
parents, 
his 
heredity; 
at 
times 
only 
lack 
of 
love, 
bad 
training, 
deprivation 
in 
childhood, 
etc. 
And 
what 
about 
his 
neurosis, 
the 
neurosis 
in 
the 
sense 
we 
understand 
it? 
We 
shall 
find 
that 
the 
accentuation 
of 
his 
predispositions 
on 
an 
analogic, 
childish 
basis, 
that 
his 
symbolized 
thoughts, 
his 
preparations 
for 
feelings, 
and 
results 
used 
by 
him 
as 
means 
of 
expression 
will 
spring 
into 
action 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
patient 
fears 
or 
experiences 
a 
set-back. 
Being 
from 
a 
certain 
situation, 
so 
to 
speak, 
inoculated 
with 
the 
feelings 
of 
inferiority, 
he 
exhibits 
an 
anaphylactic 
reaction 
against 
depreciation 
of 
his 
ego-
consciousness 
and 
finds 
in 
irresolution, 
in 
vacillation, 
in 
doubt 
and 
in 
skepticism, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
breaking 
out 
of 
a 
neurosis 
or 
a 
psychosis, 
a 
refuge 
and 
security 
against 
the 
greatest 
evil 
that 
could 
befall 
him, 
namely, 
the 
conjuring 
up 
of 
a 
distinct 
realization 
of 
his 
inferiority. 
In 
line 
with 
this 
the 
typical 
causes 
of 
the 
onset 
of 
a 
neurosis 
and 
psychosis 
are 
easy 
to 
divine 
and 
to 
prove: 


1. 
The 
desire 
for 
knowledge 
of 
sex 
differences, 
the 
uncertainty 
concerning 
his 
own 
sexual 
role, 
may 
be 
looked 
upon 
as 
causes 
of 
the 
arousing 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority. 
Likewise 
the 
realization 
and 
grouping 
of 
traits 
believed 
to 
be 
feminine, 
the 
vacillating, 
doubting, 
hermaphrodistic 
apperception 
and 
hermaphrodistic 
predisposition. 
Predisposition 
to 
and 
psychic 
gestures 
of 
the 
feminine 
role 
always 
entail 
greater 
passivity, 
anxious 
anticipation, 
etc., 
but 
call 
forth 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
stronger 
emotivity. 
(Heymanns) 
2. 
Onset 
of 
menstruation. 
3. 
Epoch 
of 
menstrual 
activity. 
4. 
Epoch 
of 
sexual 
activity. 
5. 
The 
stage 
of 
fitness 
for 
marriage. 
6. 
Pregnancy. 
7. 
Puerperium. 
8. 
Climacteric, 
reduction 
of 
potency. 
Examinations, 
choice 
of 
profession. 
Danger 
of 
death. 
All 
these 
epochs 
call 
forth 
heightening 
of 
or 
changes 
in 
the 
preparatory 
attitude 
toward 
life. 
The 
bond 
common 
to 
them 
all 
which 
holds 
them 
together 



is 
the 
expectation 
of 
new 
events 
which 
imply 
for 
the 
neurotic 
new 
struggles, 
new 
dangers 
of 
a 
setback. 
He 
proceeds 
therefore 
immediately 
to 
intensive 
protective 
measures, 
the 
most 
extreme 
of 
which 
is 
suicide. 
Outbreaks 
of 
neuroses 
and 
psychoses 
represent 
accentuations 
of 
his 
neurotic 
preparedness, 
predispositions 
in 
which 
are 
always 
found 
prominent 
traits 
of 
character, 
calculated 
to 
guarantee 
this 
sort 
of 
security, 
such 
as 
exaggeration 
of 
hypersensitiveness, 
greater 
carefulness, 
irritability, 
pedantry, 
obstinacy, 
stinginess, 
discontent, 
impatience, 
and 
many 
others. 
As 
these 
traits 
are 
easily 
demonstrable, 
they 
are 
especially 
suitable 
for 
determining 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
psychogenic 
disorder. 


We 
arrived 
at 
the 
conclusion 
in 
the 
foregoing 
that 
it 
is 
the 
feeling 
of 
uncertainty 
which 
forces 
the 
neurotic 
to 
a 
stronger 
attachment 
to 
fictions, 
guiding 
principles, 
ideals, 
dogmas. 
These 
guiding 
principles 
float 
before 
the 
normal 
person 
also. 
Buttohim 
they 
are 
a 
figure 
of 
speech, 
a 
device 
for 
distinguishing 
above 
from 
below, 
left 
from 
right, 
right 
from 
wrong, 
and 
he 
is 
not 
so 
involved 
in 
prejudice 
that 
when 
called 
upon 
to 
make 
a 
decision 
he 
cannot 
free 
himself 
from 
the 
abstract 
and 
reckon 
with 
reality. 
Just 
as 
little 
do 
the 
phenomena 
of 
life 
resolve 
themselves 
for 
him 
into 
strict 
antitheses, 
but 
on 
the 
contrary 
he 
is 
striving 
constantly 
to 
keep 
his 
thoughts 
and 
actions 
detached 
from 
this 
unreal 
principle 
and 
to 
bring 
them 
into 
harmony 
with 
reality. 
That 
he 
uses 
artifices 
at 
all 
as 
a 
means 
to 
an 
end 
arises 
from 
the 
usefulness 
of 
the 
fiction 
in 
casting 
up 
the 
accounts 
of 
life. 
The 
neurotic, 
however, 
like 
the 
child 
devoid 
of 
contact 
with 
life 
and 
like 
the 
primitive 
understanding 
of 
early 
man 
catches 
at 
the 
straw 
of 
his 
fiction, 
hypostasizes 
it, 
arbitrarily 
ascribes 
to 
it 
a 
real 
value 
and 
seeks 
to 
realize 
it 
in 
the 
world. 
For 
this 
the 
fiction 
is 
unfitted, 
still 
more 
unfitted 
when, 
as 
in 
the 
psychoses, 
it 
is 
elevated 
to 
a 
dogma 
or 
anthropomorphosed. 
The 
symbol 
as 
a 
" 
modus 
dicendi 
" 
dominates 
our 
speech 
and 
thought. 
The 
neurotic 
takes 
it 
literally 
and 
in 
the 
psychosis 
the 
realization 
is 
attempted. 
In 
my 
contributions 
to 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
neuroses 
this 
point 
is 
constantly 
emphasized 
and 
maintained. 
A 
fortunate 
circumstance 
made 
me 
acquainted 
with 
Vaihinger's 
ingenious 
" 
Philosophy 
of 
,the 
' 
As 
If 
' 
' 
(Berlin, 
1911), 
a 
work 
in 
which 
I 
found 
the 
trains 
of 
thought 
suggested 
to 
me 
by 
the 
neurosis 
set 
forth 
as 
valid 
for 
general 
scientific 
thought. 


After 
we 
have 
established 
that 
the 
fictitious 
guiding 
goal 
of 
the 
neurotic 



consists 
of 
an 
unlimited 
heightening 
of 
the 
egoconsciousness 
which 
deteriorates 
into 
the 
"will 
to 
seem 
(Nietzsche) 
we 
may 
proceed 
to 
a 
consideration 
of 
the 
abstract 
conception 
of 
these 
problems 
of 
life. 
Inasmuch 
as 
in 
seeking 
the 
sex 
differentiation 
the 
role 
of 
the 
male 
is 
given 
a 
decided 
preference, 
the 
formal 
changes 
agreeing 
with 
the 
antithesis, 
man-woman, 
begin 
at 
an 
early 
period 
and 
for 
the 
neurotic 
arises 
the 
formula 
' 
' 
I 
must 
act 
as 
though 
I 
were 
a 
complete 
man 
(or 
would 
become 
one)." 
The 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
and 
its 
consequences 
become 
identified 
with 
the 
feeling 
of 
effeminacy, 
the 
compensatory 
pressure 
in 
the 
psychic 
superstructure 
impels 
toward 
obtaining 
a 
guarantee 
that 
the 
manly 
role 
will 
be 
preserved 
and 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
neurosis 
assumes 
the 
form 
of 
the 
antithetical, 
fundamental 
thought, 
"I 
am 
a 
woman 
and 
will 
be 
a 
man." 


This 
guiding 
final 
purpose 
supplies 
the 
psychic 
gestures 
and 
predispositions 
necessary 
for 
this 
thought, 
but 
is 
expressed 
likewise 
in 
the 
attitudes 
of 
the 
body 
and 
in 
mimicry. 
And 
with 
these 
prepared 
gestures, 
of 
which 
the 
neurotic 
traits 
of 
character 
are 
to 
be 
considered 
a 
heralding, 
the 
neurotic 
confronts 
persons 
and 
life, 
anxiously 
and 
with 
strained 
attention 
asking 
if 
he 
will 
prove 
himself 
a 
man. 
Sham 
combats 
play 
a 
great 
role; 
they 
are 
begun 
so 
that 
the 
neurotic 
may 
exercise 
himself, 
that 
lie 
may 
gain 
experience 
from 
other 
or 
similar 
conditions, 
so 
that 
he 
may 
become 
more 
cautious, 
and 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
proof 
from 
example 
that 
he 
dare 
not 
venture 
upon 
the 
main 
battle. 
How 
much 
in 
this 
he 
rearranges, 
exaggerates, 
depreciates, 
which 
is 
possible 
to 
him 
from 
a 
certain 
arbitrariness 
(Meyerhoff), 
how 
he 
falsely 
classifies 
and 
how 
he 
seeks 
to 
put 
his 
fiction 
on 
firm 
foundation, 
demand 
a 
separate 
consideration, 
such 
as 
I 
have 
tentatively 
furnished 
in 
the 
preliminary 
work 
for 
this 
book. 
That 
in 
this 
masculine 
protest, 
however, 
there 
lies 
for 
the 
neurotic 
the 
more 
fundamentally 
compensating 
"will 
to 
power" 
which 
may 
change 
the 
value 
of 
feelings 
and 
even 
transform 
pleasure 
into 
pain 
is 
proved 
by 
the 
frequent 
cases 
where 
the 
direct 
effort 
to 
act 
like 
a 
man 
meets 
with 
obstacles 
and 
avails 
itself 
of 
a 
circuitous 
route, 
in 
which 
event 
the 
role 
of 
the 
woman 
is 
overvalued, 
passive 
traits 
are 
strengthened, 
masochistic, 
and 
in 
men, 
passive 
homosexual 
traits 
emerge, 
by 
means 
of 
which 
the 
patient 
hopes 
to 
gain 
power 
over 
men 
and 
women: 
in 
short, 
the 
masculine 
protest 
makes 
use 
of 
the 
feminine 
role 
in 
order 
to 
attain 
its 
purpose. 



That 
this 
device 
is 
likewise 
dictated 
by 
the 
will 
to 
power 
is 
proved 
by 
the 
further 
neurotic 
traits 
which 
strive 
for 
mastery 
and 
superiority 
in 
the 
most 
extreme 
form. 
This 
apperception, 
however, 
brings 
the 
sexual 
jargon 
into 
the 
neurosis 
which 
must 
be 
regarded 
as 
symbolic 
and 
requires 
interpretation. 


Side 
by 
side 
with 
or 
dominating 
it 
is 
found 
in 
neurotics 
the 
method 
of 
apperception 
which 
arranges 
perception 
according 
to 
the 
spatial 
antithesis, 
above-beneath. 
Also, 
for 
this 
primitive 
attempt 
at 
orientation, 
which 
the 
neurotic 
emphasizes 
very 
strongly, 
one 
finds 
analogies 
in 
primitive 
people. 
However, 
while 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
understand 
that 
the 
masculine 
principle 
is 
identified 
with 
perfection, 
we 
are 
forced 
to 
guesses 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
valuation 
of 
"above" 
as 
the 
equal 
of 
the 
principle. 
A 
certain 
probability 
seems 
to 
give 
color 
to 
the 
opinion 
that 
the 
value 
and 
significance 
of 
the 
upper 
part 
of 
the 
body 
in 
comparison 
with 
the 
feet 
furnishes 
the 
explanation. 
Still 
more 
important 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
the 
valuation 
of 
the 
word 
above 
and 
its 
covaluation 
with 
perfection 
originates 
in 
the 
longing 
of 
man 
to 
lift 
himself, 
to 
fly, 
to 
do 
that 
which 
is 
impossible 
for 
man. 
The 
universal 
flying 
dreams 
and 
the 
efforts 
of 
man 
in 
the 
same 
direction 
seem 
to 
confirm 
this 
opinion. 
That 
in 
the 
congressus 
sexualis 
the 
"above" 
is 
confluent 
with 
the 
masculine 
principle 
does 
not 
seem 
without 
significance. 


The 
reenforcement 
of 
the 
fiction 
in 
the 
neurosis 
causes 
a 
concentration 
of 
the 
attention 
on 
those 
points 
of 
view 
regarded 
by 
the 
neurotic 
as 
important. 
Therefrom 
results 
the 
narrowing 
of 
the 
field 
of 
vision 
and 
the 
psychic 
preparation 
as 
motor 
and 
psychic 
predispositions. 
Simultaneously, 
the 
more 
accentuated 
neurotic 
character 
comes 
into 
force, 
which 
maintains 
the 
assurance 
of 
the 
fiction, 
comes 
in 
touch 
with 
inimical 
forces 
and, 
spreading 
itself 
out 
far 
over 
the 
boundaries 
of 
personality, 
into 
the 
realms 
of 
space 
and 
time, 
furnishes, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
secondary 
guiding 
line, 
an 
impetus 
to 
the 
will 
to 
power. 
The 
neurotic 
attack, 
finally, 
like 
the 
strife 
for 
power, 
has 
for 
its 
purpose 
the 
protection 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness 
from 
degradation. 


Therefore 
from 
constitutional 
inferiority 
there 
arises 
a 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
which 
demands 
a 
compensation 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
a 
maximation 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness. 
From 
this 
circumstance 
the 
fiction 
which 
serves 
as 
a 
final 
purpose 
acquires 
an 
astonishing 
influence 
and 
draws 
all 
the 
psychic 
forces 
in 
its 
direction. 
Itself 
an 
outgrowth 
of 
the 
striving 
for 
security, 
it 
organizes 
psychic 
preparatory 
measures 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
guaranteeing 



security, 
among 
which 
the 
neurotic 
character 
as 
well 
as 
the 
functional 
neurosis 
are 
noticeable 
as 
prominent 
devices. 


The 
guiding 
fiction 
has 
a 
simple, 
infantile 
scheme, 
and 
influences 
the 
apperception 
and 
the 
mechanism 
of 
memory. 



CHAPTER 
II 


PSYCHIC 
COMPENSATION 
AND 
ITS 


SYNTHESIS 


OUR 
examination 
of 
the 
facts 
has 
led 
us 
to 
understand 
how 
out 
of 
the 
absolute 
inferiority 
of 
the 
child 
(especially 
the 
one 
constitutionally 
burdened), 
there 
is 
evolved 
a 
kind 
of 
self 
estimation 
which 
calls 
forth 
a' 
feeling 
of 
inferiority. 


Analogously 
to 
the 
the 
child 
seeks 
to 
gain 
a 
standpoint 
which 
will 
enable 
him 
to 
get 
a 
perspective 
in 
the 
problems 
of 
life. 
From 
this 
point 
of 
departure, 
which 
is 
taken 
as 
a 
fixed 
pole 
in 
the 
flux 
of 
phenomena, 
the 
child 
psyche 
projects 
its 
thoughts 
towards 
the 
goal 
which 
it 
longs 
to 
reach. 
These 
thoughts, 
too, 
are 
apprehended 
as 
fixed 
points 
by 
the 
abstract 
conceptions 
of 
human 
understanding 
and 
are 
then 
concretely 
interpreted. 
The 
aim 
to 
be 
great, 
to 
be 
strong, 
to 
be 
a 
man, 
to 
be 
" 
above 
" 
is 
symbolized 
in 
the 
person 
of 
the 
father, 
the 
mother, 
the 
teacher, 
the 
coachman, 
the 
locomotive 
engineer, 
etc., 
and 
the 
conduct, 
the 
attitude, 
the 
imitative 
gestures, 
the 
play 
of 
children 
and 
their 
wishes, 
the 
day 
dreams 
and 
favorite 
stories, 
ideas 
about 
their 
future 
vocation 
show 
us 
that 
the 
compensatory 
tendency 
is 
at 
work 
and 
is 
making 
preparations 
for 
the 
future 
role. 
The 
feeling 
which 
the 
individual 
has 
of 
his 
own 
inferiority, 
incompetency, 
the 
realization 
of 
his 
smallness, 
of 
his 
weakness, 
of 
his 
uncertainty, 
thus 
becomes 
an 
appropriate 
working 
basis 
which, 
because 
of 
the 
intrinsically 
associated 
feelings 
of 
pleasure 
and 
pain, 
furnishes 
the 
inner 
impulse 
to 
advance 
towards 
an 
imaginary 
goal. 
The 
scheme 
of 
which 
the 
child 
avails 
himself 
in 
order 
to 
enable 
him 
to 
act 
and 
orient 
himself 
is 
one 
common 
to 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
tendency 
of 
the 
human 
understanding 
to 
reduce 
that 
which 
is 
chaotic, 
fluid 
and 
intangible 
in 
life 
to 
measurable 
entities 
by 
means 
of 
the 
assumption 
of 
fictions. 
We 
proceed 
in 
the 
same 
way 
when 
we 
divide 
the 
globe 
by 
means 
of 
meridianal 
and 
parallel 
lines, 
for 
thus 
only 
do 
we 
preserve 
fixed 
points 
which 
we 
can 
place 
in 
relation 
with 
each 
other. 
In 
all 
similar 
attempts 
(and 
the 
human 
psyche 
is 
full 
of 
them) 
it 
is 
the 
question 
of 
an 
introduction 
of 
an 
unreal 
and 
abstract 
scheme 
into 
actual 
life, 
and 
I 
consider 
the 
presentation 
of 
this 
conception 
as 
I 
have 
gathered 
it 
from 
the 
psychological 
observation 
of 



neuroses 
and 
psychoses 
and 
which, 
according 
to 
the 
proofs 
furnished 
by 
Vaihinger, 
manifests 
itself 
in 
all 
scientific 
concepts, 
to 
be 
the 
main 
object 
of 
this 
book. 
No 
matter 
from 
what 
angle 
we 
observe 
the 
psychic 
development 
of 
a 
normal 
or 
neurotic 
person 
he 
is 
always 
found 
ensnared 
in 
the 
meshes 
of 
his 
particular 
fiction; 
a 
fiction 
from 
which 
the 
neurotic 
is 
unable 
to 
find 
his 
way 
back 
to 
reality 
and 
in 
which 
he 
believes 
while 
the 
normal 
person 
utilizes 
it 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
reaching 
a 
definite 
goal. 
However, 
that 
which 
gives 
such 
irresistible 
impulse 
to 
the 
utilization 
of 
this 
scheme 
is 
always 
the 
uncertainty 
in 
childhood, 
the 
great 
distance 
which 
separates 
the 
child 
from 
the 
potency 
of 
man, 
from 
the 
distinctions 
and 
privileges 
of 
manhood, 
forebodings 
and 
knowledge 
of 
which 
the 
child 
possesses. 
And 
in 
regard 
to 
this 
point 
I 
beg 
leave 
to 
supplement 
these 
statements 
of 
the 
learned 
writer, 
Vaihinger, 
namely, 
that 
the 
thing 
which 
impels 
us 
all 
and 
especially 
the 
neurotic 
and 
the 
child 
to 
abandon 
the 
direct 
path 
of 
induction 
and 
deduction 
and 
to 
use 
such 
devices 
as 
the 
schematic 
fiction 
originates 
in 
the 
feeling 
of 
uncertainty 
and 
is 
the 
craving 
for 
security, 
the 
final 
purpose 
of 
which 
is 
to 
escape 
from 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
in 
order 
to 
ascend 
to 
the 
full 
height 
of 
the 
ego-
consciousness, 
to 
complete 
manliness, 
to 
attain 
the 
ideal 
of 
being 
" 
above." 
The 
greater 
the 
distance 
to 
this 
ideal, 
the 
more 
distinctly 
the 
guiding 
fiction 
asserts 
itself 
so 
that 
the 
feeling 
of 
being 
" 
under 
" 
may 
be 
just 
as 
much 
a 
determining 
factor 
as 
the 
deification 
of 
the 
father 
and 
mother 
who 
are 
the 
ideals 
of 
strength. 


We 
thus 
see 
exertions 
put 
forth 
far 
beyond 
those 
which 
we 
would 
expect 
in 
the 
most 
violent 
bodily 
performances 
which 
might 
arise 
from 
instincts, 
or 
in 
the 
strongest 
desire 
for 
gratification 
of 
organic 
longings. 
Goethe 
among 
others 
also 
refers 
to 
this 
fact 
that 
while 
perception 
is 
connected 
with 
the 
practical 
satisfaction 
of 
necessities, 
yet 
man 
carries 
on 
a 
life 
beyond 
this 
in 
feeling 
and 
imagination. 
In 
this 
thought 
the 
compulsion 
to 
the 
elevation 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness 
is 
aptly 
expressed, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
a 
passage 
occurring 
in 
one 
of 
Goethe's 
letters 
to 
Lavater 
in 
which 
he 
says, 
" 
This 
longing 
to 
elevate 
as 
high 
as 
possible 
the 
apex 
of 
the 
pyramid 
of 
my 
existence, 
the 
base 
of 
which 
is 
placed 
in 
my 
possession, 
outweighs 
all 
else 
and 
is 
scarcely 
a 
moment 
absent 
from 
thought." 


It 
can 
readily 
be 
understood 
how 
such 
a 
tense 
psychic 
situation 
and 
every 
artist, 
every 
genius, 
fights 
the 
same 
battle 
against 
the 
feeling 
of 
uncertainty; 



with 
him, 
however, 
it 
is 
the 
valuable 
cultural 
medium 
of 
his 
art 
which 
is 
capable 
of 
reenforcing 
and 
bringing 
to 
light 
a 
host 
of 
traits 
of 
character 
which 
help 
to 
construct 
the 
neuroses. 
Thus, 
first 
of 
all, 
ambition. 
This 
is 
the 
strongest 
of 
the 
secondary 
guiding 
principles 
which 
strive 
towards 
the 
imaginary 
goal. 
And 
it 
generates 
a 
number 
of 
psychic 
predispositions 
whose 
purpose 
it 
is 
to 
secure 
to 
the 
neurotic 
superiority 
in 
all 
situations 
of 
life, 
but 
which 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
makes 
his 
aggressiveness, 
his 
affectivity, 
appear 
to 
be 
in 
a 
state 
of 
constant 
irritation. 
Thus 
the 
neurotic 
individual 
seems 
always 
to 
be 
proud, 
dogmatic, 
envious 
and 
miserly, 
seeks 
always 
to 
make 
an 
impression, 
wishes 
to 
be 
first, 
but 
always 
trembles 
for 
the 
result 
and 
gladly 
postpones 
decisions. 
Hence 
the 
hesitating, 
cautious 
behavior 
of 
neurotics, 
their 
mistrust, 
vacillation 
and 
doubt. 
As 
if 
for 
practice 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
a 
preliminary 
process 
he 
carries 
on 
these 
psychic 
preparations 
in 
small 
things 
in 
order 
to 
attain 
to 
fixed 
points 
and 
safeguarding 
directing 
principles 
for 
greater 
aims 
which 
hold 
him 
under 
their 
charm. 
This 
is 
also 
the 
meaning 
of 
Freud's 
displacement 
mechanism, 
i.e., 
the 
patient 
is 
impelled 
by 
his 
craving 
for 
security 
to 
collect 
proof 
experimentally, 
in 
corpore 
vili, 
which 
justifies 
and 
will 
continue 
to 
justify 
his 
entire 
psychic 
attitude. 
As 
a 
rule 
the 
result 
is 
always 
the 
thought, 
"I 
must 
be 
cautious, 
if 
I 
wish 
to 
attain 
my 
goal." 
And 
not 
infrequently 
the 
patient 
commits 
audaciously 
reckless 
acts 
in 
order 
to 
assure 
himself 
through 
an 
emphasis 
of 
the 
lesson 
of 
his 
recklessness 
the 
attainment 
of 
his 
main 
point, 
namely, 
the 
masculine 
ideal. 
Often 
hallucinations 
and 
dreams 
assume 
with 
neurotics 
and 
psychotics 
the 
function 
of 
these 
warning 
voices 
and 
depict 
how 
it 
has 
already 
been 
once 
before, 
how 
it 
has 
been 
with 
others, 
or 
how 
the 
thing 
might 
turn 
out, 
in 
order 
to 
hold 
the 
patient 
to 
the 
guiding 
principle 
in 
which 
he 
finds 
security. 


At 
other 
times 
the 
strongly 
emphasized 
traits 
of 
eagerness 
for 
strife, 
obstinacy 
and 
activity, 
which 
are 
to 
"elevate" 
the 
apex 
of 
the 
pyramid 
as 
far 
as 
possible 
are 
strongly 
accentuated 
by 
pedantry 
which 
strives 
to 
keep 
them 
from 
changing 
their 
direction. 
That 
the 
eagerness 
for 
knowledge, 
as 
a 
mighty 
promoter 
towards 
attaining 
the 
high 
goal, 
is 
greatly 
overstrained, 
is 
not 
astonishing. 
With 
equal 
distinctness 
impatience, 
fear 
of 
being 
too 
late, 
fear 
of 
attaining 
nothing, 
manifest 
themselves 
as 
a 
particularly 
strong 
impulse 
to 
neglect 
no 
means, 
to 
do 
rather 
too 
much 
than 
not 
enough 
towards 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
goal. 
These 
traits 
always 
lie 
within 
the 
field 
of 
the 



developed 
neurosis, 
where 
the 
feeling 
of 
' 
' 
craving 
for 
security 
' 
' 
obtrudes 
itself 
more 
and 
drives 
to 
the 
dangerous 
expedients 
by 
means 
of 
which 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
is 
rendered 
more 
profound, 
and 
the 
patient 
acts 
as 
if 
he 
were 
restrained, 
cut 
off 
from 
success 
and 
without 
hope, 
or 
he 
plunges 
to 
a 
greater 
or 
less 
degree 
into 
passivity, 
displays 
effeminate 
traits, 
conducts 
himself 
in 
a 
masochistic 
or 
perverse 
manner 
and 
finally 
greatly 
reduces 
his 
sphere 
of 
activity 
so 
that 
it 
is 
more 
shaken 
and 
more 
strongly 
dominated 
by 
the 
symptoms 
of 
the 
disease. 
In 
a 
similar 
manner 
arises 
the 
arrangement 
of 
indolence, 
laziness, 
fatigue, 
impotence 
of 
every 
sort 
which 
furnish 
a 
pretext 
to 
escape 
from 
decisions 
which 
could 
affect 
the 
pride 
of 
the 
neurotic, 
an 
excuse 
for 
withdrawing 
from 
study, 
from 
a 
vocation, 
from 
marriage. 
At 
times 
this 
develop 
mental 
phase 
terminates 
in 
suicide 
which 
is 
then 
always 
felt 
as 
a 
successful 
revenge 
on 
fate 
or 
on 
his 
relatives. 


Consciousness 
of 
guilt 
also 
asserts 
itself. 
Here 
we 
find 
one 
of 
the 
most 
difficult 
points 
in 
the 
analysis 
of 
neuroses 
and 
psychoses. 
Consciousness 
of 
guilt 
and 
conscience 
are 
fictitious 
guiding 
principles 
of 
caution, 
like 
religiosity 
and 
subserve 
the 
craving 
for 
security. 
(*See 
Fortmuller, 
" 
Psychoanalysis 
and 
Ethics," 
Munchen, 
E. 
Eeinhardt, 
1912. 
) 


Their 
object 
is 
to 
prevent 
a 
lowering 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness 
when 
the 
irritated 
aggressiveness 
impels 
immoderately 
to 
selfish 
deeds. 
In 
the 
consciousness 
of 
guilt 
the 
glance 
is 
directed 
backwards, 
conscience 
operates 
through 
foresight. 
The 
love 
of 
truth, 
too, 
is 
sustained 
by 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
and 
belongs 
really 
within 
the 
sphere 
of 
our 
personal 
ideal, 
while 
the 
neurotic 
lie 
represents 
a 
feeble 
attempt 
to 
preserve 
appearances 
and 
to 
effect 
compensation. 


All 
these 
attempts 
towards 
elevation, 
efforts 
of 
the 
"will 
to 
power," 
must 
naturally 
be 
understood 
as 
a 
form 
of 
the 
striving 
towards 
masculinity 
and 
become 
identified 
with 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
because 
this 
represents 
a 
fundamental 
form 
of 
the 
psychical 
impulse 
to 
become 
of 
value, 
in 
accordance 
with 
which 
all 
experiences, 
perceptions 
and 
directions 
of 
will 
are 
grouped. 
Apperception 
is 
guided 
in 
accordance 
with 
this 
most 
significant 
scheme, 
namely, 
the 
goal, 
especially 
in 
neurotics, 
is 
the 
erection 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest 
against 
an 
effeminate 
self-estimation. 
Thus 
are 
guided 
also 
attention, 
foresight, 
doubt, 
as 
well 
as 
all 
traits 
of 
character 
and 
other 
psychic 
and 
physical 
inclinations, 
but 
in 
the 
highest 
degree 
and 
above 
all 
the 
evaluation 
of 



all 
experiences 
in 
line 
with 
this 
masculine 
goal, 
so 
that 
all 
these 
phenomena 
contain 
a 
dynamic 
which 
is 
betrayed 
to 
the 
experienced, 
and 
which 
tends 
from 
that 
which 
is 
below 
to 
that 
which 
is 
above, 
from 
that 
which 
is 
feminine 
to 
that 
which 
is 
masculine. 
The 
creation 
of 
all 
these 
lines 
of 
force, 
the 
fixation 
of 
this 
remote 
goal, 
the 
emphasis 
and 
occasional 
protection 
of 
inferior 
effeminate 
traits 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
combating 
them 
more 
forcibly 
by 
the 
masculine 
protest 
takes 
place 
by 
means 
of 
the 
same 
factor 
which 
also 
created 
the 
organic 
compensation, 
i.e., 
the 
tendency 
towards 
adjustment 
by 
constant 
attempt 
to 
supplant 
an 
injurious, 
inferior 
performance 
by 
an 
increase 
of 
effort 
and 
which 
in 
the 
psychic 
sphere 
finds 
expression 
in 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
which 
takes 
as 
a 
guiding 
line 
(directrix) 
the 
will 
to 
power, 
to 
be 
manly, 
in 
order 
to 
escape 
the 
feeling 
of 
uncertainty. 


The 
greatest 
difficulty 
which 
stands 
in 
the 
way 
of 
an 
understanding 
of 
the 
neurosis 
arises 
from 
the 
striking 
protection 
afforded 
these 
inferior, 
effeminate 
traits 
and 
their 
acknowledgment 
by 
the 
patients. 
Here 
belong 
all 
the 
phenomena 
of 
the 
disease 
generally, 
but 
also 
the 
passive, 
masochistic 
traits, 
the 
effeminate 
characteristics, 
the 
passive 
homosexuality, 
impotence, 
suggestibility, 
accessibility 
to 
and 
inclination 
for 
hypnosis, 
or, 
finally, 
the 
apparent 
surrender 
to 
effeminacy 
and 
to 
effeminate 
behavior. 
The 
final 
object, 
however, 
always 
remains 
the 
same, 
the 
domination 
over 
others 
which 
is 
felt 
and 
appreciated 
as 
a 
masculine 
triumph. 
Neither 
are 
the 
above 
described 
compensatory 
features 
ever 
absent 
in 
the 
makeup 
of 
these 
patients, 
as 
they 
might 
be 
expected 
to 
be 
in 
individuals 
who 
assume 
as 
a 
ground 
for 
action 
a 
feeling 
of 
inadequacy 
and 
who 
then 
strive 
to 
secure 
by 
every 
possible 
means 
a 
substitute 
for 
their 
shortcomings, 
to 
supply 
that 
which 
they 
feel 
to 
be 
lacking 
in 
their 
exaggerated 
ego-consciousness. 
And 
also 
in 
the 
psychic 
situation 
the 
sexual 
element 
as 
a 
symbol 
asserts 
itself, 
inasmuch 
as 
such 
patients 
frequently 
form 
their 
apperceptions 
in 
accordance 
with 
a 
scheme 
in 
which 
their 
genital 
organs 
are 
regarded 
as 
if 
they 
were 
effeminized, 
restricted, 
castrated, 
and 
as 
if 
they 
were 
therefore 
constantly 
forced 
to 
seek 
a 
substitute. 
One 
form 
of 
this 
substitution 
they 
find 
in 
the 
depreciation 
and 
emasculation 
of 
all 
other 
persons. 
From 
this 
tendency 
to 
deprive 
others 
of 
worth 
originates 
the 
considerable 
reenforcement 
of 
certain 
traits 
of 
character, 
which 
set 
forth 
further 
inclinations 
and 
which 
have 
the 
quality 
of 
injuring 
others, 
as 
sadism, 
hate, 
contentiousness, 
intolerance, 
envy, 



etc. 
Active 
homosexuality, 
also, 
as 
well 
as 
perversions 
which 
degrade 
the 
partner, 
also 
Lustmord, 
arise 
from 
the 
neurotic 
tendency 
to 
depreciate, 
a 
tendency 
which 
can 
hardly 
be 
pictured 
too 
strongly. 
They 
all 
represent 
a 
rationalization 
of 
the 
symbolism 
of 
subjection 
in 
line 
with 
the 
concept 
which 
asserts 
the 
" 
sexual 
dominance 
of 
the 
male." 
In 
short, 
the 
neurotic 
may 
also 
elevate 
the 
feeling 
of 
his 
own 
worth 
by 
degrading 
others. 


We 
have 
mentioned 
above 
the 
protection 
of 
the 
effeminate 
traits 
in 
the 
neurosis 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
better 
carrying 
on 
the 
combat, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
a 
better 
surveillance 
over 
self. 
These 
accentuations 
along 
with 
the 
distinct 
tendency 
to 
give 
preference 
to 
the 
will 
to 
masculinity 
create 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
rent 
in 
the 
psyche 
of 
the 
neurotic 
which 
is 
familiar 
to 
writers 
as 
double 
personality, 
dissociation, 
and 
which 
is 
frequently 
seen 
in 
the 
changing 
humors 
of 
neurotics, 
but 
also 
in 
the 
succession 
of 
depression 
and 
mania, 
of 
ideas 
of 
persecution 
and 
grandeur 
in 
the 
psychoses. 
I 
have 
always 
found 
as 
an 
internal 
connecting 
bond 
in 
these 
antithetical 
conditions 
the 
tendency 
to 
maximate 
the 
ego-consciousness, 
whereby 
the 
"inferior" 
situation 
is 
associated 
with 
a 
degradation, 
but 
is 
circumscribed 
and 
arranged 
as 
a 
ground 
for 
operation. 
It 
is 
then 
that 
the 
masculine 
protest 
asserts 
itself, 
which 
is 
often 
carried 
to 
the 
length 
of 
asserting 
a 
resemblance 
to 
God 
or 
an 
intimate 
connection 
with 
Him. 
For 
the 
" 
splitting 
of 
consciousness 
" 
the 
severely 
schematic 
and 
"very 
abstract 
process 
of 
apperception 
is 
also 
responsible, 
a 
form 
of 
apperception 
which 
groups 
the 
internal 
and 
external 
experiences 
according 
to 
a 
scheme 
which 
has 
the 
form 
of 
an 
absolute 
antithesis, 
something 
like 
the 
debits 
and 
credits 
in 
book-keeping, 
where 
there 
are 
no 
transitions 
possible. 
This 
fault 
of 
the 
neurotic 
mode 
of 
thinking, 
which 
is 
identical 
with 
a 
too 
far-fetched 
abstraction, 
is 
likewise 
caused 
by 
his 
craving 
for 
security, 
a 
tendency 
which 
requires 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
making 
decisions, 
for 
anticipations 
and 
actions, 
sharply 
defined 
guiding 
lines, 
idols, 
false 
deities 
in 
which 
the 
neurotic 
believes. 
In 
this 
way 
he 
becomes 
estranged 
from 
concrete 
reality. 
For 
to 
find 
one's 
bearings 
in 
the 
world 
of 
reality 
an 
elasticity 
of 
the 
psyche 
and 
not 
a 
rigidity 
is 
required, 
a 
utilization 
of 
abstraction, 
but 
not 
an 
adoration, 
an 
idolizing 
of 
the 
same 
as 
the 
final 
purpose 
of 
existence. 


Accordingly 
we 
shall 
find 
in 
the 
mental 
life 
of 
the 
neurotic, 
just 
as 
is 
the 
case 
in 
primitive 
poetry, 
in 
mythology, 
in 
legends, 
in 
cosmogony, 
in 
theogony 
and 
in 
the 
beginnings 
of 
philosophy 
a 
most 
pronounced 
tendency 
to 



give 
a 
symbolic 
style 
to 
himself, 
his 
experiences 
and 
to 
persons 
about 
him. 
Thus 
naturally 
the 
phenomena 
which 
do 
not 
belong 
together 
must 
be 
sharply 
separated 
from 
each 
other 
by 
an 
abstracting 
fiction. 
The 
impulse 
to 
this 
expedient 
arises 
from 
the 
longing 
for 
an 
orientation 
"and 
has 
its 
roots 
in 
the 
neurotic's 
craving 
for 
security. 
This 
impulse 
is 
often 
so 
intense 
that 
it 
demands 
the 
splitting 
of 
unity, 
of 
the 
category, 
of 
the 
unity 
of 
the 
ego 
into 
two 
or 
more 
of 
its 
antithetical 
parts. 


From 
the 
above 
described 
self-estimation 
of 
the 
child, 
who 
is 
induced 
by 
inferiority 
of 
constitution 
and 
the 
evils 
arising 
therefrom 
to 
strive 
after 
special 
securities, 
up 
to 
the 
complete 
development 
of 
the 
neurotic 
technique 
of 
thinking 
and 
its 
coadjuvant 
lines, 
of 
the 
neurotic 
character, 
a 
host 
of 
psychic 
phenomena 
make 
their 
appearance 
which 
according 
to 
Karl 
Groos 
(Die 
Spiele 
der 
Menschen, 
Die 
Spiele 
der 
Thiere) 
may 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
training, 
according 
to 
our 
interpretation 
as 
a 
preparation 
for 
the 
imaginary 
goal. 
They 
are 
manifested 
at 
an 
early 
age, 
are 
indicated 
even 
in 
early 
infancy 
and 
are 
constantly 
at 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
influences 
of 
conscious 
and 
unconscious 
education. 
The 
whole 
development 
of 
the 
child 
shows 
that 
it 
proceeds 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
an 
idea, 
which 
naturally 
takes 
a 
primitive 
form 
and 
quite 
regularly 
seeks 
concrete 
embodiment 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
person. 
Under 
this 
compulsion, 
the 
psychic 
mechanism 
of 
which 
is 
for 
the 
most 
part 
unconscious 
and 
only 
partly 
conscious, 
the 
psyche 
in 
the 
process 
of 
formation 
comes 
to 
more 
distinct 
expression, 
and 
the 
mental 
as 
well 
as 
the 
physical 
life 
of 
a 
human 
being 
taken 
at 
any 
given 
point 
of 
its 
development 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
as 
the 
answer 
which 
that 
individual 
gives 
to 
the 
question 
of 
life. 


This 
answer, 
in 
reality 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
life 
is 
accepted, 
is 
according 
to 
all 
the 
knowledge 
thereof 
furnished 
by 
experience, 
to 
be 
considered 
as 
identical 
with 
the 
effort 
to 
put 
an 
end 
to 
uncertainty, 
to 
the 
chaos 
which 
prevails 
in 
impressions 
and 
feelings, 
with 
the 
effort 
to 
obtain 
a 
firm 
hold 
in 
order 
to 
overcome 
the 
difficulties 
of 
life. 
Reflection, 
observation, 
thought 
and 
forethought, 
attention, 
calculation 
and 
valuation 
are 
all 
efforts 
put 
forth 
by 
this 
craving 
for 
security. 
And 
inasmuch 
as 
the 
realization 
of 
one's 
own 
inferiority 
is 
taken 
as 
an 
abstract 
standard 
for 
inequality 
among 
human 
beings, 
the 
greater, 
the 
stronger 
and 
his 
measure 
are 
taken 
for 
the 
fictitious 
goal 
so 
that 
it 
may 
be 
a 
guarantee 
against 
this 
uncertainty 
and 
fright. 
Thus 
it 



is 
that 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
child 
constructs 
a 
guiding 
line 
which 
impels 
towards 
an 
elevation 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness 
in 
order 
to 
escape 
from 
uncertainty, 
the 
influence 
of 
which 
is 
still 
stronger 
in 
neurotics 
who 
have 
felt 
their 
inferiority 
more 
keenly. 
Mythographers, 
the 
human 
race, 
poets, 
philosophers, 
founders 
of 
religions 
have 
taken 
the 
material 
from 
their 
contemporaneous 
periods 
for 
the 
transformation 
of 
the 
guiding 
lines 
so 
that 
immortality, 
virtue, 
piety, 
riches, 
knowledge, 
social 
consciousness 
of 
the 
upper 
classes 
or 
self-
perfection 
were 
available 
as 
goals 
and 
were 
utilized 
according 
to 
the 
receptive 
peculiarities 
of 
the 
individual 
who 
longed 
for 
perfection. 
At 
this 
point 
the 
living 
energies 
of 
the 
child 
become 
transferred 
into 
the 
self-created 
sphere 
of 
his 
subjective 
world 
which 
henceforth 
as 
a 
guiding 
fiction 
transmutes, 
falsifies 
and 
changes 
the 
values 
of 
all 
feelings 
and 
emotions, 
pleasures 
and 
pains, 
even 
the 
struggle 
for 
self-preservation, 
for 
his 
benefit, 
in 
order 
to 
attain 
the 
goal; 
a 
transformation 
which 
utilizes 
all 
the 
experiences 
of 
the 
neurotic 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
bring 
about 
preparations 
which 
will 
ensure 
the 
triumph. 


These 
preparatory 
acts 
with 
their 
tendency 
to 
change 
values 
may 
be 
most 
clearly 
observed 
in 
the 
play 
of 
nervous 
children, 
in 
their 
deliberations 
over 
the 
choice 
of 
a 
future 
vocation 
and 
their 
physical 
and 
psychical 
attitudes. 
These 
phenomena 
will 
be 
further 
discussed 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
dominating 
craving 
for 
security 
which 
controls 
them. 
Concerning 
the 
nervous 
habitus 
it 
may 
be 
stated 
that 
as 
a 
rule 
it 
is 
noticeable 
at 
an 
early 
age, 
that 
it 
takes 
the 
form 
of 
a 
pantomimic 
representation 
of 
some 
trait 
of 
character, 
either 
as 
an 
anxious, 
waiting, 
distrustful, 
uncertain, 
cautious, 
bashful 
attitude 
or 
as 
a 
hostile, 
obstinate, 
self-certain, 
self-complacent, 
forward 
attitude. 
Blushing 
is 
noticeable 
or 
the 
glance 
is 
peculiarly 
fixed, 
cast 
down 
or 
hostile. 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
correlate 
one 
of 
these 
attitudes 
or 
gestures, 
or 
a 
mimic 
trait, 
with 
the 
prototype. 
In 
nervous 
children 
imitation 
of 
the 
male 
principle, 
the, 
father, 
is 
often 
found; 
the 
mother 
only 
becomes 
a 
model 
for 
imitation 
after 
a 
formal 
change 
in 
the 
guiding 
principle 
has 
taken 
place, 
or 
when 
from 
the 
beginning 
the 
moral 
superiority 
of 
the 
mother 
is 
beyond 
question. 
Usually 
these 
phenomena 
are 
insignificant 
and 
such 
as 
are 
not 
as 
a 
rule 
subjected 
to 
the 
observation 
of 
the 
physician. 
Crossing 
the 
legs, 
the 
arms, 
a 
peculiar 
manner 
of 
gait, 
preference 
for 
certain 
foods, 
borrowing 
of 
certain 
traits 
of 
character, 
etc., 
or 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
more 
strongly 
emphasized 
obstinacy 
opposite 
forms 



of 
expression. 
The 
retained 
bad 
habits 
of 
childhood, 
such 
as 
eneuresis, 
biting 
the 
nails, 
sucking, 
stuttering, 
winking 
the 
eyes, 
masturbation, 
etc., 
can 
always 
be 
traced 
to 
these 
beginnings 
of 
obstinacy. 
They 
are 
the 
expedients 
of 
the 
weak 
to 
diminish 
the 
pathos 
of 
the 
distance 
and 
thereby 
do 
away 
with 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
and 
strive 
in 
the 
last 
analysis 
to 
a 
transformation 
of 
authority 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
to 
gain 
an 
excuse 
for 
avoiding 
a 
decision, 
for 
postponing 
it. 


All 
considerable 
phenomena 
of 
this 
sort 
are 
themselves 
neurotic 
traits 
of 
character 
or 
show 
that 
they 
are 
permeated 
by 
the 
neurotic 
character 
and 
like 
it 
itself 
are 
a 
form 
of 
expression 
of 
the 
craving 
for 
security, 
preparatory 
processes 
and 
preliminary 
provisions 
of 
the 
compensatory 
force 
which 
is 
produced 
by 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority. 



CHAPTER 
III 
THE 
ACCENTUATED 
FICTION 
AS 
THE 
GUIDING 
IDEA 
IN 
THE 
NEUROSIS 


The 
most 
important 
task 
of 
thinking 
is 
to 
anticipate 
actions 
or 
events; 
to 
seize 
upon 
an 
objective 
and 
ways 
and 
means 
and 
to 
influence 
them 
as 
far 
as 
possible. 
By 
means 
of 
this 
process 
of 
forethought, 
our 
influence 
over 
space 
and 
time 
is 
assured 
to 
a 
certain 
degree. 
Accordingly 
our 
psyche 
is 
first 
of 
all 
an 
organ 
of 
aggression 
born 
out 
of 
the 
distress 
of 
the 
too 
restricted 
limitation 
which 
from 
the 
first 
renders 
difficult 
the 
gratification 
of 
natural 
appetites. 
This 
organically 
determined 
goal 
of 
gratification 
of 
appetites 
will 
only 
endure 
so 
long 
as 
the 
suitable 
means 
are 
at 
hand 
for 
its 
stabilization; 
for 
rendering 
it 
secure 
against 
the 
strongest 
attacks. 
Toward 
the 
end 
of 
the 
nursing 
period, 
when 
the 
child 
acquires 
ability 
to 
carry 
out 
independent, 
purposeful 
actions 
which 
are 
not 
merely 
directed 
toward 
the 
gratification 
of 
appetite, 
when 
he 
takes 
his 
place 
in 
the 
family 
and 
begins 
to 
adapt 
himself 
to 
his 
environment, 
he 
already 
possesses 
abilities, 
psychic 
gestures 
and 
preparations. 
Besides 
this 
his 
conduct 
has 
acquired 
a 
certain 
uniformity 
and 
is 
seen 
to 
be 
on 
the 
road 
toward 
acquiring 
his 
place 
in 
the 
world. 
Such 
a 
uniformity 
of 
conduct 
can 
only 
be 
comprehended 
by 
the 
assumption 
that 
the 
child 
has 
discovered 
some 
specific 
fixed 
point 
outside 
of 
his 
own 
personality 
towards 
which 
he 
strives 
with 
his 
developmental 
energies. 
The 
child 
must, 
therefore, 
have 
constructed 
for 
himself 
a 
guiding 
principle, 
a 
guiding 
model, 
obviously 
in 
the 
hope 
of 
thus 
orienting 
himself 
in 
the 
best 
possible 
manner 
in 
his 
environment 
and 
of 
obtaining 
gratification 
of 
his 
necessities 
of 
avoiding 
pain 
and 
of 
obtaining 
pleasure. 
(*Adler, 
" 
Trotz 
und 
Gehorsamkeit.") 


From 
this 
guiding 
ideal 
arises 
the 
very 
beginning 
of 
the 
child's 
craving 
for 
tenderness, 
that 
quality 
which 
(Paulsen) 
originally 
determines 
the 
tractability 
of 
the 
child. 
Soon 
there 
become 
associated 
with 
this 
first 
quality, 
efforts 
to 
gain 
the 
praise, 
help 
and 
love 
of 
the 
parents, 
stirrings 
of 
independence, 
of 
obstinacy 
and 
of 
opposition. 
The 
child 
has 
found 
a 
meaning 
in 
life 
towards 
which 
he 
strives 
and 
whose 
still 
indistinct 
outlines 
he 
is 
forming, 
and 
starting 
from 
which 
he 
derives 
that 
quality 
of 
prevision 
which 
is 
calculated 
to 
direct 
and 
give 
worth 
to 
his 
actions 
and 
impulses. 
It 
is 
the 
child's 
helplessness, 
clumsiness 
and 
uncertainty 
which 
necessitates 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 



tentative 
tests 
of 
possibility, 
the 
acquisition 
of 
experience, 
the 
creation 
of 
memories 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
constructing 
a 
bridge 
leading 
to 
that 
future 
where 
there 
are 
to 
be 
found 
greatness, 
power 
and 
satisfaction 
of 
all 
sorts. 
The 
construction 
of 
this 
bridge 
is 
the 
most 
important 
work 
the 
child 
is 
called 
upon 
to 
perform 
because 
without 
it 
he 
would 
find 
himself 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
inpouring 
impressions 
without 
order, 
without 
counsel, 
without 
guide. 
It 
is 
scarcely 
possible 
to 
define 
the 
limits 
of 
this 
first 
stadium, 
of 
this 
awakening 
subjective 
world, 
to 
describe 
it 
in 
words. 
But 
it 
may, 
however, 
be 
said 
that 
the 
guiding 
model 
of 
the 
child 
must 
be 
so 
constructed 
as 
if 
it 
were 
able 
to 
bring 
to 
the 
child 
greater 
certainty 
and 
orientation 
by 
influencing 
the 
direction 
of 
his 
will. 


But 
he 
can 
only 
obtain 
security 
by 
striving 
towards 
a 
fixed 
point 
where 
he 
sees 
himself 
greater 
and 
stronger, 
where 
he 
finds 
himself 
rid 
of 
the 
helplessness 
of 
infancy. 
The 
symbolic 
and 
logical 
nature 
of 
our 
process 
of 
thinking 
permits 
the 
construction 
of 
this 
future 
changed 
personality 
in 
the 
image 
of 
the 
father, 
the 
mother,, 
of 
an 
elder 
brother 
or 
sister, 
or 
teacher 
or 
some 
professional 
man, 
or 
hero, 
or 
animal, 
or 
God. 
The 
qualities 
of 
greatness, 
power, 
knowledge 
and 
ability 
are 
features 
common 
to 
all 
these 
guiding 
images 
and 
thus 
they 
are 
one 
and 
all 
symbols 
for 
imaginative 
abstractions. 
And 
thus 
like 
idols 
made 
of 
clay 
they 
receive 
from 
the 
imagination 
of 
man, 
force 
and 
life, 
and 
react 
upon 
the 
psyche 
which 
has 
created 
them. 


This 
artifice 
of 
thinking 
would 
have 
the 
stamp 
of 
paranoia 
and 
of 
dementia 
precox 
conditions, 
which 
create 
for 
themselves 
hostile 
forces 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
securing 
ego-consciousness, 
were 
not 
the 
child 
able 
at 
all 
times 
to 
free 
himself 
from 
the 
bonds 
of 
his 
fiction, 
to 
eliminate 
his 
projections 
(Kant) 
from 
his 
calculations, 
and 
to 
make 
use 
only 
of 
the 
impetus 
which 
is 
given 
him 
by 
this 
guiding 
line. 
His 
uncertainty 
is 
sufficient 
to 
make 
him 
set 
up 
a 
fantastic 
goal 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
orientation 
in 
the 
world, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
so 
great 
as 
to 
make 
him 
deprive 
reality 
of 
its 
value 
and 
to 
assert 
dogmatically 
the 
reality 
of 
this 
guiding 
model, 
as 
is 
the 
case 
in 
the 
psychoses. 
One 
must, 
however, 
call 
attention 
to 
the 
similarity, 
the 
significance 
of 
this 
uncertainty 
and 
the 
device 
of 
a 
fiction 
in 
normal 
persons, 
neurotics 
and 
the 
insane. 


The 
part 
of 
this 
process 
which 
is 
common 
to 
all 
humanity, 
normal 
and 
abnormal, 
is 
that 
the 
apperceiving 
memory 
is 
under 
the 
sway 
of 
the 
guiding 



fiction. 
It 
is 
because 
of 
this 
that 
there 
exists 
within 
certain 
limits 
in 
all 
mankind 
a 
uniformity 
concerning 
a 
cosmic 
conception. 
The 
child 
in 
its 
insignificance 
and 
helplessness 
will 
constantly 
strive 
to 
enlarge 
his 
field 
of 
power 
and 
will 
mark 
this 
field 
off 
after 
the 
pattern 
of 
that 
which 
seems 
to 
possess 
the 
greatest 
strength. 
And 
now 
it 
becomes 
evident 
in 
the 
course 
of 
psychic 
development 
that 
that 
which 
was 
at 
first 
only 
an 
imaginary 
expedient, 
important 
only 
in 
its 
relations, 
only 
a 
means 
for 
gaining 
ground 
to 
stand 
upon, 
for 
finding 
one's 
bearings, 
for 
gaining 
a 
foothold, 
has 
become 
a 
goal 
in 
itself, 
obviously 
because 
the 
child 
can 
only 
in 
this 
way 
obtain 
self-
assurance 
in 
acting 
and 
not 
directly 
through 
the 
gratification 
of 
desires.* 


*As 
may 
be 
seen 
from 
Karl 
Groos' 
" 
Play 
of 
Animals 
" 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
animal 
psyche 
is 
likewise 
based 
upon 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
see 
it 
act 
as 
though 
it 
were 
following 
the 
direction 
of 
a 
fictitious 
guiding 
line. 


Thus 
the 
effective 
point 
is 
found 
outside 
the 
corporeal 
sphere 
according 
to 
which 
the 
psyche 
adjusts 
itself, 
a 
point 
which 
forms 
the 
centre 
of 
gravity 
of 
human 
thought, 
feeling 
and 
volition. 
And 
the 
mechanism 
of 
apperceiving 
memory 
with 
its 
host 
of 
experiences, 
transforms 
itself 
from 
an 
objectively 
operating 
system 
into 
a 
subjectively 
active, 
fictitiously 
modified 
scheme 
of 
an 
imagined 
future 
personality. 
It 
becomes 
the 
task 
of 
this 
scheme 
to 
bring 
about 
such 
connections 
with 
the 
outside 
world 
as 
will 
serve 
to 
maximate 
his 
feeling 
of 
ego-consciousness, 
such 
associations 
as 
will 
hint 
at 
the 
preparing 
activities 
and 
thought 
indicators 
and 
bring 
these 
in 
contact 
with 
the 
already 
existing 
state 
of 
preparedness. 
One 
is 
here 
reminded 
of 
the 
apt 
expression 
of 
Charcot 
who 
has 
emphasized 
for 
science 
that 
" 
one 
only 
discovers 
that 
which 
one 
knows," 
an 
observation 
which 
when 
directed 
to 
practical 
experience 
tends 
to 
show 
that 
our 
whole 
sphere 
of 
perception 
is 
limited 
by 
a 
number 
of 
predetermined 
psychical 
mechanisms 
and 
predispositions 
as 
Kant's 
theory* 
of 
"a 
priori 
" 
forms 
of 
perception 
teaches 
us. 
In 
a 
similar 
manner 
our 
actions 
are 
determined 
by 
the 
content 
of 
experiences, 
which 
are 
given 
birth 
to 
and 
are 
determined 
by 
the 
guiding 
fiction. 


* 
I 
have 
to 
call 
attention 
here 
to 
Bergson's 
fundamental 
teachings, 
without 
being 
able 
to 
give 
room 
here 
for 
his 
important 
view-point;*. 
Even 
our 
judgments 
concerning 
the 
value 
of 
things 
are 
determined 



according 
to 
the 
standard 
of 
the 
imaginary 
goal, 
not 
according 
to 
"real" 
feelings 
or 
pleasurable 
sensations. 


And 
conduct 
follows 
as 
James 
expresses 
it 
in 
consequence 
of 
a 
sort 
of 
approbation 
depends 
as 
it 
were 
on 
a 
fiat, 
command 
or 
acquiescence. 
The 
guiding 
fiction 
is 
therefore 
first 
of 
all 
the 
expedient, 
the 
device 
by 
means 
of 
which 
the 
child 
seeks 
to 
free 
himself 
from 
his 
feeling 
of 
inferiority. 
It 
initiates 
compensation 
and 
stands 
at 
the 
service 
of 
the 
craving 
for 
security. 
The 
greater 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
the 
more 
imperative 
and 
stronger 
will 
be 
the 
necessity 
for 
a 
steadying, 
guiding 
principle 
and 
indeed 
the 
more 
distinctly 
it 
manifests 
itself, 
and 
like 
compensation 
in 
the 
organic 
sphere, 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
psychic 
compensation 
is 
linked 
with 
a 
functional 
increase 
and 
brings 
about 
novel 
and 
many-sided 
manifestations 
in 
the 
mental 
life. 
One 
of 
the 
forms 
of 
expression 
of 
this 
compensatory 
mechanism, 
intended 
to 
assure 
the 
sense 
of 
ego-consciousness 
is 
exemplified 
by 
the 
neurosis 
and 
psychosis. 


The 
constitutionally 
inferior 
child 
with 
his 
host 
of 
disadvantages 
and 
uncertainties 
will 
construct 
his 
goal 
in 
a 
more 
definite 
and 
clearer 
manner, 
will 
outline 
more 
distinctly 
the 
guiding 
principle 
and 
will 
adhere 
to 
it 
more 
anxiously 
or 
dogmatically. 
In 
fact 
the 
principal 
impression 
which 
one 
gains 
from 
the 
observation 
of 
a 
neurotically 
disposed 
child 
is 
usually 
that 
the 
child 
is 
guided 
in 
the 
choice 
of 
a 
weapon 
by 
his 
somatic 
inferiority 
which 
he 
utilizes 
in 
his 
dealings 
with 
his 
relatives 
or 
which 
he 
emphasizes 
in 
his 
obstinacy. 


Often 
his 
illness 
is 
borrowed 
from 
his 
environment 
either 
by 
simulation 
or 
exaggeration 
of 
actual 
ailments, 
all 
this 
in 
order 
to 
strengthen 
his 
position. 
Should 
such 
means 
not 
have 
the 
desired 
effect 
upon 
his 
environment, 
the 
child 
endeavors 
to 
rid 
himself 
of 
his 
complaints 
through 
the 
exercise 
of 
superior 
efforts, 
as 
result 
of 
which 
there 
develop 
not 
infrequently 
qualified 
and 
artistic 
performances 
in 
the 
event 
of 
the 
experiencing 
of 
an 
overcompensation 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
functional 
anomalies 
of 
the 
eye, 
* 
ear, 
speech 
or 
musculature. 
Associated 
with 
this 
are 
also 
stirrings 
of 
independence. 
Or 
the 
remedy 
is 
sought, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
in 
a 
greater 
dependence, 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
which, 
anxiety, 
a 
feeling 
of 
insignificance, 
weakness, 
awkwardness, 
incapacity, 
sense 
of 
guilt 
and 
remorse 
serve 
as 
strongholds. 
The 
same 
tendency 
may 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
adherence 
to 
the 
bad 



habits 
of 
childhood, 
in 
the 
retention 
of 
a 
psychic 
infantilism 
in 
so 
far 
as 
this 
is 
not 
exclusively 
or 
partially 
the 
result 
of 
obstinacy, 
of 
the 
infantile 
negativism. 


A 
number 
of 
the 
complaints 
of 
psychopathic 
children 
are 
of 
a 
subjective 
nature, 
and 
correspond 
to 
a 
complete 
or 
partial 
error 
of 
judgment 
as 
it 
takes 
place 
in 
the 
effort 
of 
children 
to 
find 
a 
reason 
for 
their 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
and 
to 
comprehend 
it. 
Frequently 
these 
logical 
interpretations 
are 
already 
intermixed 
with 
the 
compensating 
ambition 
or 
with 
the 
child's 
aggressiveness 
towards 
its 
parents. 
' 
The 
fault 
lies 
with 
my 
parents, 
with 
my 
lot, 
because 
I'm 
the 
youngest, 
because 
I 
was 
born 
too 
late, 
because 
I 
am 
a 
Cinderella, 
because 
I'm 
perhaps 
not 
the 
child 
of 
these 
parents, 
of 
this 
father, 
of 
this 
mother, 
because 
I 
am 
too 
small, 
too 
weak, 
have 
too 
small 
a 
head, 
am 
too 
homely, 
because 
I 
have 
an 
impediment 
of 
speech, 
a 
defect 
of 
hearing, 
am 
cross-eyed, 
near-sighted, 
because 
I 
have 
imperfect 
genitals, 
because 
I'm 
not 
manly, 
because 
I 
am 
a 
girl, 
because 
I’m 
bad 
by 
nature, 
dull 
and 
awkward, 
because 
I 
have 
masturbated, 
because 
I'm 
too 
sensuous, 
too 
covetous 
and 
naturally 
perverted, 
because 
I 
submit 
easily, 
am 
too 
dependent 
and 
obey, 
because 
I 
cry 
easily, 
am 
easily 
affected, 
because 
I 
am 
a 
criminal, 
a 
thief, 
an 
incendiary, 
and 
could 
murder 
some 
one. 
My 
ancestry, 
my 
education, 
circumcision 
are 
to 
blame, 
because 
I 
have 
too 
long 
a 
nose, 
too 
much 
hair, 
too 
little 
hair, 
because 
I 
am 
a 
cripple." 
Thus 
and 
similarly 
sound 
the 
child's 
attempts 
to 
unburden 
himself 
by 
blaming 
fate 
just 
as 
in 
the 
Greek 
fate 
tragedies, 
these 
are 
attempts 
to 
preserve 
the 
ego-consciousness 
and 
hold 
others 
responsible 
for 
his 
inferiority. 
These 
attempts 
are 
regularly 
met 
with 
in 
the 
psychic 
treatment 
of 
the 
neuroses 
and 
they 
can 
always 
be 
referred 
back 
to 
the 
relationship 
between 
an 
existing 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
and 
an 
assumed 
ideal. 
The 
significance 
and 
value 
of 
these 
thought 
processes 
which 
are 
as 
a 
thorn 
in 
the 
side 
of 
the 
neurotic 
are 
noted 
also 
in 
the 
uses 
to 
which 
they 
are 
put 
by 
himself, 
first 
for 
the 
stimulation 
of 
his 
efforts 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
his 
ideal 
(grandiose 
ideas) 
and 
second, 
the 
utilization 
of 
them 
as 
a 
refuge 
and 
excuse 
when 
forced 
to 
a 
decision 
which 
threatens 
a 
lowering 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness 
(depreciatory 
ideas). 


The 
second 
applicability 
and 
application 
naturally 
occupies 
the 
foreground 
in 
the 
neuroses 
because 
the 
goal 
toward 
which 
the 
neurotic 
strives 
is 
set 
too 
high 
to 
be 
reached 
in 
a 
direct 
line. 
The 
utilization 
of 
this 
ideal 
is 
only 
rendered 
possible 
by 
an 
admixture 
of 
aggression 
or 
in 
blaming 
fate 
as 



well 
as 
heredity. 
By 
means 
of 
this 
the 
neurotic 
gains 
a 
permanent 
base 
of 
operation 
on 
the 
strength 
of 
which 
he 
unfolds, 
thrusts 
forward 
and 
stabilizes 
certain 
traits 
of 
character 
which 
serve 
the 
same 
hostile 
purpose, 
such 
as 
obstinacy, 
a 
dominating, 
grumbling 
nature, 
pedantry, 
because 
thereby 
he 
always 
succeeds 
in 
gaining 
mastery 
over 
his 
environment 
principally 
by 
calling 
attention 
to 
his 
terrible 
suffering. 
All 
of 
these 
traits 
and 
predispositions 
associated 
with 
bad 
habits 
retained 
from 
childhood 
which 
have 
become 
markedly 
exaggerated, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
disease 
symptoms 
of 
a 
self-created 
and 
self-modeled 
nature 
stand 
in 
the 
closest 
interrelation, 
are 
inseparable 
one 
from 
another 
and 
show 
their 
dependence 
on 
a 
factor 
outside 
their 
own 
sphere, 
i.e., 
they 
depend 
upon 
the 
guiding 
fiction 
which 
has 
evolved 
from 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
or 
from 
the 
longing 
for 
the 
maximation 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness. 
In 
the 
imaginary 
basis 
of 
this 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
which 
because 
of 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
is 
always 
thought 
of 
in 
an 
exaggerated 
manner 
and 
felt 
too 
keenly, 
I 
see 
the 
chief 
therapeutic 
hope. 
The 
question 
whether 
the 
feeling 
of 
uncertainty 
is 
conscious 
or 
unconscious 
is 
of 
secondary 
importance. 
At 
times 
pride 
carries 
things 
so 
far 
that 
"memory 
gives 
way" 
(Nietzsche). 
Naturally 
the 
above 
described 
connection 
is 
not 
realized 
by 
the 
patient. 
It 
is 
for 
this 
reason 
that 
he 
remains 
the 
plaything 
of 
his 
emotions 
and 
affects 
until 
such 
time 
as 
the 
mechanism 
becomes 
revealed 
to 
him 
and 
set 
to 
rights, 
until 
such 
time 
as 
the 
predispositions 
and 
neurotic 
plan 
of 
life 
are 
shattered; 
a 
plaything 
of 
emotions 
and 
effects 
the 
interaction 
of 
which 
becomes 
further 
complicated 
because 
of 
a 
constant 
admixture 
of 
traits 
of 
character 
intended 
to 
negate 
his 
sense 
of 
inferiority, 
such 
as 
pride, 
envy, 
greed, 
cruelty, 
courage, 
revengefulness, 
irritability, 
etc., 
traits 
of 
character 
which 
are 
constantly 
being 
excited 
through 
his 
craving 
for 
security. 


The 
tendency 
to 
exaggerate 
and 
emphasize 
existing 
defects 
plays 
an 
important 
role 
in 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
neuroses. 
An 
appearance 
of 
weakness, 
suffering, 
incapacity 
and 
uselessness 
results 
from 
this 
manner 
of 
presenting 
actual 
defects 
because 
the 
neurotic 
is 
compelled 
by 
the 
mechanism 
which 
controls 
him 
to 
conduct 
himself 
unwaveringly 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
as 
to 
feel 
as 
though 
he 
were 
sick, 
as 
though 
he 
were 
effeminate, 
inferior, 
neglected, 
injured, 
sexually 
over-excited, 
impotent 
or 
perverted. 
The 
cautious 
approach 
to 
problems 
of 
life 
which 
constantly 
accompanies 
these 
impulses, 
the 
exaggerated 
striving 
upwards, 
the 
desire 
to 
play 
the 
role 
of 
man 
in 
some 
way 



or 
other, 
to 
be 
superior 
to 
everybody 
else, 
the 
neurotic's 
stronghold 
with 
its 
prime 
object 
of 
avoiding 
decisions 
and 
setbacks 
and 
thus 
to 
escape 
a 
lowering 
of 
his 
ego-consciousness, 
all 
of 
this 
reveals 
to 
us 
the 
true 
state 
of 
affairs, 
namely, 
that 
the 
low 
self-estimation 
of 
the 
neurotic 
is 
in 
itself 
an 
expedient 
by 
means 
of 
which 
he 
strives 
the 
more 
powerfully 
to 
attain 
that 
guiding 
goal 
which 
will 
bring 
about 
a 
maximation 
of 
his 
ego-consciousness. 
He 
may 
conduct 
himself 
according 
to 
the 
motto 
" 
half 
and 
half," 
he 
may 
cede 
certain 
strongholds 
in 
the 
contest, 
but 
he 
does 
so 
solely 
in 
order 
to 
fortify 
himself 
against 
an 
ultimate 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
and 
in 
order 
to 
be 
the 
better 
able 
to 
utilize 
others 
in 
his 
service. 


The 
sexual 
feature 
of 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
neuroses 
which 
Freud 
looks 
upon 
as 
a 
cardinal 
point 
is 
in 
this 
wise 
explained 
as 
the 
effect 
of 
a 
fiction. 
There 
is 
no 
objective 
standard 
of 
the 
" 
libido.” 
The 
exaltation 
and 
diminution 
of 
the 
same 
is 
always 
in 
accord 
with 
the 
imaginary 
goal. 
It 
is 
easy 
for 
the 
neurotic 
to 
convince 
himself 
that 
he 
is 
the 
subject 
of 
a 
high 
sexual 
tension 
by 
means 
of 
a 
more 
or 
less 
purposeful 
arrangement, 
and 
especially 
by 
means 
of 
a 
concentration 
of 
the 
attention 
in 
this 
direction 
the 
moment 
he 
begins 
to 
seek 
proof 
of 
how 
much 
injury 
sexuality 
works 
to 
his 
feeling 
of 
security 
and 
how 
much 
his 
ego-consciousness 
is 
threatened 
from 
this 
source. 
The 
weakening 
of 
libidinous 
impulses 
even 
to 
the 
point 
of 
psychic 
impotence 
is 
to 
be 
regarded 
as 
purposeful 
checks 
on 
aggression, 
as 
disorders 
of 
natural 
predispositions, 
as 
a 
construction 
of 
an 
"as 
if" 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
assuring 
himself 
against 
marriage, 
against 
a 
swerving 
from 
the 
goal, 
against 
a 
degradation 
at 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
sexual 
partner, 
against 
poverty 
or 
culpability. 
Repressed 
or 
conscious 
perverse 
tendencies, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
compulsion 
to 
masturbation 
are 
always 
looked 
upon 
as 
detours, 
as 
symbols 
of 
an 
imaginary 
plan 
of 
life 
whose 
purpose 
is 
self 
assurance. 
They 
are 
called 
into 
being 
by 
the 
guiding 
fiction 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
finds 
expression 
in 
the 
fear 
of 
the 
sexual 
partner 
as 
happens 
regularly 
where 
there 
exist 
sexual 
anomalies. 


The 
fiction 
may 
then 
also 
repress 
the 
incentive 
to 
perversion 
into 
the 
subconscious 
or 
make 
the 
fear 
of 
the 
partner 
unrecognizable 
to 
consciousness 
so 
that 
it 
only 
becomes 
apparent 
from 
a 
survey 
of 
the 
whole 
situation. 
It 
resorts 
to 
the 
first 
alternative 
when 
it 
depends 
on 
pride 
for 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
its 
purpose, 
to 
the 
latter 
when 
it 
makes 
a 
virtue 
of 
the 
defect 
and 
seeks 
the 
degradation 
of 
the 
partner. 
Incestuous 
tendences 
too, 
to 
which 
Freud 
ascribes 



such 
an 
important 
role 
in 
the 
production 
of 
neuroses 
and 
psychoses 
reveal 
themselves 
in 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
neuroses 
as 
purposeful 
edifices 
and 
symbols, 
which 
derive 
their 
usually 
harmless 
material 
out 
of 
childhood 
life 
with 
its 
preparatory 
processes. 
A 
proper 
insight 
for 
instance 
into 
the 
" 
OEdipus 
complex 
" 
shows 
us 
that 
it 
is 
nothing 
more 
nor 
less 
than 
a 
figurative, 
sexually 
clothed 
conception 
of 
what 
constitutes 
masculine 
self-
consciousness, 
superiority 
over 
woman, 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
betrays 
the 
cause 
which 
leads 
to 
this 
phenomenon, 
namely 
as 
if 
the 
mother 
were 
the 
only 
one 
that 
one 
could 
subjugate, 
on 
whom 
one 
could 
depend 
or 
as 
though 
sexual 
desire 
(already 
in 
childhood) 
were 
to 
be 
carried 
through 
in 
spite 
of 
everything 
and 
always 
by 
a 
struggle 
with 
stronger 
forces 
(the 
father, 
dragons, 
danger 
of 
death). 
As 
may 
be 
inferred 
from 
this 
interpretation, 
close 
inquiry 
into 
the 
sexual 
neuroses 
always 
leads 
to 
the 
discovery 
of 
a 
guiding 
fiction 
which 
reveals 
itself 
in 
a 
sexual 
form 
or 
can 
be 
revealed 
by 
therapeutists, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
the 
laying 
bare 
of 
a 
mode 
of 
apperception 
evolved 
according 
to 
a 
sexual 
scheme 
in 
consequence 
of 
which 
the 
neurotic 
and 
often 
also 
the 
normal 
person 
attempt 
to 
apprehend 
and 
understand 
the 
world 
and 
all 
its 
phenomena 
in 
sexual 
terms, 
in 
a 
sexual 
picture 
as 
it 
were. 
Our 
further 
investigations 
reveal 
that 
this 
sexual 
scheme 
which 
is 
often 
carried 
out 
in 
speech, 
in 
custom, 
and 
manners, 
is 
only 
a 
variation 
of 
that 
all-embracing 
scheme 
of 
more 
fundamental 
origin, 
i.e., 
the 
antithetical 
mode 
of 
apperception 
as 
" 
male-
female 
" 
" 
up-down."* 


* 
See 
the 
dream 
of 
Tippias, 
Herodotus 
VI., 
107; 
" 
he 
dreamt 
that 
he 
was 
sleeping 
with 
his 
mother." 
This 
he 
dreamed 
as 
he 
was 
about 
to 
conquer 
his 
maternal 
city, 
as 
he 
had 
already 
done 
once 
before 
as 
the 
companion 
of 
his 
father. 
Thus 
the 
OEdipus 
complex 
as 
the 
symbol 
of 
the 
desire 
to 
dominate. 
With 
the 
Komans 
too 
Beisehlaf 
(sexual 
congress) 
symbolized 
conquest, 
victory. 
Compare 
the 
double 
meaning 
of 
the 
word 
"subigere." 
The 
later 
psychic 
perverse 
tendencies 
derive 
their 
material 
and 
impulse 
from 
the 
harmless 
bodily 
sensations 
and 
misjudgments 
of 
childhood 
which 
when 
occasion 
arises 
are 
given 
an 
extraordinarily 
high 
value 
or 
some 
chance 
pleasurable 
sensations 
are 
perceived 
as 
analogues 
of 
sexual 
sensations. 
The 
psychologist 
must 
not 
assume 
the 
same 
point 
of 
view, 
must 
not 
maintain 
such 
a 
mode 
of 
apperception 
as 
valid, 
not 
substitute 
real 
sexual 
components 
for 
a 



fiction 
as 
the 
patient 
does. 
His 
task 
on 
the 
contrary 
consists 
in 
revealing 
to 
the 
patient 
the 
superficiality 
of 
his 
attempts 
at 
orientation, 
to 
tear 
it 
apart 
as 
a 
mere 
product 
of 
the 
imagination, 
and 
to 
weaken 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
which 
drives 
the 
patient 
in 
a 
convulsive 
manner 
towards 
these 
guiding 
principles 
which 
would 
necessitate 
the 
carrying 
'out 
of 
the 
" 
masculine 
protest 
in 
a 
circuitous 
manner. 


Apperceiving 
memory 
which 
influences 
our 
cosmic 
picture 
to 
such 
a 
great 
extent 
works 
also 
with 
a 
fiction 
as 
it 
were, 
with 
a 
schematic 
fiction, 
in 
accordance 
with 
which 
we 
choose 
and 
model 
our 
perceptions, 
our 
experiences, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
training 
of 
our 
connate 
tendencies 
and 
capacities 
until 
they 
are 
changed 
into 
the 
appropriate 
psychical 
and 
technical 
skilfulness 
and 
preparedness. 
The 
modus 
operandi 
of 
our 
conscious 
and 
unconscious 
memory 
and 
its 
individualization 
obey 
the 
personal 
ideal 
and 
its 
standards. 
From 
this 
we 
are 
able 
to 
deduce 
that 
as 
a 
guiding 
fiction 
its 
purpose 
is 
to 
confront 
the 
problems 
of 
life 
so 
soon 
as 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
and 
uncertainty 
impels 
toward 
compensation. 
This 
fixed 
guiding 
point 
of 
our 
efforts, 
which 
in 
no 
sense 
possesses 
reality, 
is 
absolutely 
decisive 
for 
the 
psychic 
development, 
for 
it 
enables 
us 
to 
make 
steps 
in 
the 
chaos 
of 
the 
world, 
as 
does 
the 
child 
when 
learning 
to 
walk 
and 
keeping 
in 
his 
eye 
a 
goal 
which 
he 
strives 
to 
reach. 
Far 
more 
unwaveringly, 
the 
neurotic 
keeps 
before 
his 
eye 
his 
God, 
his 
idol, 
his 
ideal 
of 
personality 
and 
clings 
to 
his 
guiding 
principle, 
losing 
sight 
in 
the 
meanwhile 
of 
reality, 
whereas 
the 
normal 
person 
is 
always 
ready 
to 
dispense 
with 
this 
crutch, 
this 
aid, 
and 
reckon 
unhampered 
with 
reality. 
In 
this 
instance, 
the 
neurotic 
resembles 
a 
person 
who 
looks 
up 
to 
God, 
commends 
himself 
to 
the 
Lord 
and 
then 
and 
there 
awaits 
credulously 
for 
his 
guidance; 
he 
is 
nailed 
to 
the 
cross 
of 
his 
fiction. 
The 
normal 
individual 
too 
may 
and 
does 
create 
his 
deity, 
feels 
drawn 
upward 
but 
never 
loses 
sight 
of 
reality, 
and 
always 
takes 
it 
into 
account 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
is 
called 
upon 
to 
act. 
Accordingly 
the 
neurotic 
lives 
under 
the 
hypnotic 
influence 
of 
an 
imaginary 
plan 
of 
life. 


That 
this 
imaginary 
mark 
of 
the 
personal 
ideal 
situated 
as 
it 
is 
beyond 
space 
and 
time 
is 
never 
without 
effect, 
may 
be 
seen 
from 
the 
trends 
of 
the 
attention; 
interests 
and 
tendencies 
of 
these 
individuals, 
which 
always 
lead 
to 
points 
of 
view 
of 
an 
a 
priori 
nature. 
The 
exquisite 
purposefulness 
of 
our 
psychic 
processes 
and 
the 
predisposition 
determined 
thereby 
is 
responsible 



for 
the 
fact 
that 
our 
actions 
have 
definite 
beginnings 
and 
terminations, 
that, 
as 
Ziehen 
emphasizes, 
voluntary 
and 
involuntary 
actions 
are 
constantly 
aimed 
at 
attaining 
a 
definite 
result, 
that 
we 
must 
assume 
with 
Pawlow 
a 
decided 
intelligence 
in 
the 
functioning 
of 
the 
organs. 
All 
these 
phenomena 
are 
so 
convincing 
that 
philosophers 
and 
psychologists 
have 
from 
the 
earliest 
times 
taken 
as 
a 
teleologic 
dogma 
everything 
which 
premeditatively 
attempted 
an 
orientation 
according 
to 
an 
assumed 
fixed 
point 
as 
the 
goal. 


The 
concept 
of 
natural 
selection 
is 
entirely 
too 
inadequate 
to 
explain 
results 
which 
are 
able 
to 
take 
on 
new 
and 
changing 
forms 
as 
occasion 
demands. 
Experience 
compels 
us 
to 
consider 
all 
these 
phenomena 
as 
dependent 
upon 
an 
unconsciously 
active 
fiction, 
the 
faint 
conscious 
irradiations 
of 
which 
furnish 
us 
goals, 
according 
to 
which 
in 
the 
last 
analysis 
our 
apperception 
of 
all 
our 
experiences 
and 
activities 
is 
shaped. 
It 
is 
less 
difficult 
to 
prove 
the 
details 
of 
this 
guiding 
fiction, 
than 
the 
fiction 
itself, 
than 
the 
fictitious 
goal 
itself. 
Psychological 
research 
has 
called 
attention 
to 
various 
such 
goals. 
For 
our 
purpose 
it 
will 
suffice 
to 
consider 
critically 
just 
two 
of 
these. 
Most 
authorities 
content 
themselves 
with 
the 
view 
that 
all 
human 
activity, 
all 
volition 
is 
dominated 
by 
feelings 
of 
pleasure 
and 
pain. 
Upon 
superficial 
consideration 
these 
authors 
seem 
to 
be 
correct 
in 
their 
assumptions, 
because 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact 
the 
human 
psyche 
does 
tend 
to 
seek 
pleasure 
and 
avoid 
pain. 
But 
the 
foundation 
of 
this 
theory 
is 
unstable. 
There 
is 
no 
standard 
for 
feelings 
of 
pleasure, 
indeed 
no 
standard 
for 
feeling 
at 
all. 
There 
exists 
furthermore 
no 
perception, 
no 
action, 
the 
effect 
of 
which 
may 
not 
vary 
in 
accordance 
with 
place 
and 
time, 
under 
some 
circumstances 
causing 
pleasure; 
under 
others 
pain. 
And 
even 
the 
primitive 
sensations 
resulting 
from 
satisfaction 
of 
organic 
desires 
have 
their 
gradations 
and 
vary 
with 
the 
degree 
of 
satiability 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
cultural 
guiding 
principles, 
so 
that 
for 
satisfaction 
in 
itself 
to 
serve 
as 
the 
goal, 
it 
requires 
extreme 
denial, 
and 
abstinence. 
Now 
granting 
that 
satisfaction 
has 
actually 
been 
attained, 
does 
the 
psyche 
really 
lose 
its 
directing" 
principle? 
The 
psyche's 
iron 
necessity 
for 
orientation 
and 
security 
requires 
for 
their 
establishment 
and 
their 
functions 
a 
more 
stable 
standpoint 
than 
the 
vacillating 
and 
uncertain 
principle 
of 
gratification 
of 
desire, 
and 
a 
more 
stable 
point 
of 
view 
than 
the 
object 
of 
attaining 
gratification. 
The 
impossibility 
of 
orienting 
one's 
self 
and 
one's 
actions 
according 
to 
such 
a 
goal 
forces 
even 
the 
child 
to 



abandon 
efforts 
in 
this 
direction. 
Finally 
it 
is 
a 
misuse 
of 
an 
abstraction 
to 
single 
out 
and 
emphasize 
by 
means 
of 
a 
petitio 
principii, 
out 
of 
the 
various 
complex 
psychic 
activities, 
the 
quest 
of 
pleasure, 
as 
the 
motive 
force, 
after 
every 
isolated 
impulse 
has 
already 
been 
explained 
as 
pleasure 
seeking, 
as 
libidinous. 
Shiller 
with 
a 
keenness 
of 
vision 
trained 
in 
the 
school 
of 
Kant 
saw 
much 
further 
when 
he 
made 
a 
place 
in 
the 
coming 
" 
philosophy 
" 
for 
the 
directing 
influence 
of 
earthly 
events, 
and 
even 
went 
so 
far 
as 
to 
consider 
it 
(philosophy) 
dependent 
on 
" 
hunger 
and 
love." 


To 
ascribe, 
however, 
the 
whole 
directing 
force 
to 
sexuality 
as 
Freud 
does, 
or 
what 
is 
for 
him 
the 
same 
thing, 
to 
the 
libido, 
to 
ascribe 
this 
whole 
influence 
to 
nothing 
but 
love 
is 
a 
violation 
of 
logical 
thinking 
itself, 
a 
fiction 
of 
a 
bad 
sort, 
which 
when 
accepted 
as 
a 
dogma 
must 
lead 
to 
great 
contradictions 
and 
confusion 
of 
concepts 
because 
it 
contrasts 
altogether 
too 
much 
with 
reality. 


The 
disapproval 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
" 
self-preservation 
" 
is 
more 
difficult, 
especially 
as 
that 
principle 
is 
supported 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
by 
arguments 
of 
a 
teleological 
significance, 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
by 
the 
import 
of 
Darwin's 
theory 
of 
natural 
selection. 
But 
we 
see 
constantly 
that 
we 
undertake 
courses 
of 
action 
contrary 
to 
the 
principles 
of 
self-preservation 
or 
to 
the 
preservation 
of 
the 
species, 
yes, 
that 
a 
certain 
arbitrariness 
(Fres-Meyerhof) 
permits 
us, 
in 
regard 
to 
self-preservation 
as 
well 
as 
in 
regard 
to 
pleasure, 
to 
raise 
or 
lower 
our 
valuations, 
that 
we 
often 
wholly 
lose 
sight 
of 
self-preservation 
when 
pleasure 
or 
pain 
enter 
into 
the 
question, 
and 
that 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
we 
often 
sacrifice 
pleasure 
when 
an 
injury 
is 
threatened 
to 
the 
ego. 
In 
what 
manner 
do 
these 
two 
incentives 
which 
are 
certainly 
not 
without 
influence, 
range 
themselves 
under 
the 
main 
guiding 
principle 
which 
impels 
to 
the 
elevation 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness? 
The 
two 
points 
of 
view 
correspond 
to 
two 
types 
of 
individuals 
(to 
which 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
add 
still 
others) 
one 
of 
which 
is 
least 
able 
to 
dispense 
with 
pleasure 
in 
his 
ego-consciousness, 
while 
the 
other 
places 
first 
importance 
on 
the 
feeling 
of 
life, 
on 
the 
feeling 
of 
immortality. 
Therefore, 
there 
arise 
modified 
modes 
of 
perception 
which 
produce 
antitheses 
in 
thought 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
" 
pleasure 
pain 
" 
or 
" 
life 
death." 
The 
former 
are 
unable 
to 
deprive 
pleasure 
of 
value, 
the 
latter 
life. 
In 
the 
sense 
of 
procreation 
which 
is 
again 
thought 
of 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
the 
antithetical 
scheme 
" 
male-
female," 
these 
two 
types 
approach 
each 
other 
and 
seek 
expression 
in 
the 



direction 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
As 
far 
as 
neurotics 
are 
concerned 
the 
one 
type 
has 
always 
sought 
to 
compensate 
the 
painful 
feeling 
of 
his 
somatic 
inferiority, 
the 
other 
type 
has 
grown 
up 
in 
the 
fear 
of 
death, 
of 
dying 
early. 
Their 
view 
of 
the 
world 
furnishes 
them 
only 
fragments, 
their 
soul 
is 
partially 
color-blind, 
but, 
notwithstanding 
this, 
often 
more 
keen-sighted 
than 
the 
Daltonists 
in 
their 
understanding 
of 
color. 


We 
close 
this 
critical 
observation 
with 
a 
reference 
to 
the 
absolute 
principle 
of 
the 
" 
will 
to 
power 
" 
a 
guiding 
fiction 
which 
sets 
in 
more 
forcibly 
and 
earlier, 
and 
is 
precipitated 
and 
matured, 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
prominence 
assumed 
by 
the 
consciousness 
of 
inferiority 
in 
the 
physically 
inferior 
child. 
The 
ideal 
of 
personal 
importance 
as 
a 
point 
toward 
which 
all 
efforts 
are 
directed 
is 
created 
by 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
and 
contains 
as 
imaginary 
qualities 
all 
the 
powers 
and 
natural 
gifts 
of 
which 
the 
child 
believes 
himself 
deprived. 
This 
fiction, 
more 
exaggerated 
than 
under 
normal 
conditions, 
molds 
the 
mentality, 
the 
traits 
of 
character 
and 
predispositions 
in 
its 
own 
image. 
The 
neurotic 
apperception 
proceeds 
according 
to 
a 
figurative 
scheme 
containing 
sharply 
opposed 
antitheses, 
and 
the 
grouping 
of 
the 
impressions 
and 
emotions 
takes 
place 
according 
to 
correspondingly 
false 
and 
imaginary 
values. 


It 
lies 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
neurotic 
fiction, 
of 
the 
exaggerated 
idea 
of 
personal 
worth, 
to 
reveal 
itself 
under 
two 
forms, 
sometimes 
as 
an 
" 
abstract 
mechanism 
" 
sometimes 
as 
a 
concrete 
picture, 
or 
as 
a 
phantasy, 
as 
an 
idea. 
In 
the 
first 
case 
the 
connection 
of 
what 
is 
symbolic 
in 
the 
representation 
with 
the 
compensated 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
should 
not 
be 
lost 
sight 
of, 
and 
in 
the 
second 
case 
one 
must 
above 
all 
take 
into 
consideration 
the 
decisive 
share 
in 
the 
process 
taken 
by 
the 
psychic 
dynamic 
which 
impels 
" 
upwards." 
(Of 
the 
later 
authors 
who 
have 
especially 
emphasized 
this 
point 
of 
view, 
I 
must 
especially 
mention 
H. 
Silberer.) 


In 
the 
analysis 
of 
a 
psychogenic 
disease 
so 
long 
as 
the 
guiding 
tendency 
" 
upwards 
" 
does 
not 
reveal 
itself, 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
disease 
remains 
hidden 
to 
us, 
for 
no 
matter 
how 
valuable 
the 
insights 
of 
the 
psycho-therapeutists 
have 
been, 
so 
long 
as 
the 
secondary 
guiding 
principle 
of 
attaining 
pleasure, 
of 
affectivity 
(Bleuler) 
and 
those 
which 
originate 
as 
result 
of 
physical 
inferiority 
(Adler) 
are 
not 
referred 
back 
to 
the 
ideal 
of 
personality 
our 
understanding 
remains 
imperfect, 
" 
there 
is 
still 
unfortunately 
lacking 
the 
psychic 
bond." 
It 



is 
also 
not 
astonishing 
that 
in 
different 
cases 
different 
characteristics 
are 
given 
to 
this 
ideal 
of 
personality 
and 
usually 
various 
characteristics 
at 
one 
and 
the 
same 
time 
as 
these 
are 
derived 
from 
various 
sorts 
of 
organ 
defects, 
usually 
from 
several 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
A 
preliminary, 
decidedly 
incomplete 
diagram 
which 
would 
correspond 
more 
to 
the 
" 
abstract 
psyche 
" 
of 
the 
neurotic 
than 
to 
that 
of 
the 
normal 
individual 
would 
be 
the 
following: 



In 
this 
outline 
the 
most 
varied 
combinations 
must 
be 
imagined, 
if 
it 
is 
to 
serve 
its 
purpose 
as 
a 
model 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
superficial 
orientation. 
Instead 
of 
discussing 
these 
combinations 
and 
the 
multitudinous 
components 
we 
will 
discuss 
some 
distinguishing 
phenomena 
which 
seem 
important 
for 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
neuroses 
and 
the 
neurotic 
character. 


Each 
of 
the 
abstract 
guiding 
lines 
of 
the 
neurosis 
and 
of 
its 
underlying 
psychic 
mechanism 
may 
become 
accessible 
to 
consciousness 
by 
means 
of 
a 
memory-picture 
or 
may 
be 
rendered 
accessible 
to 
it. 
This 
picture 
may 
originate 
from 
the 
remnants 
of 
a 
childhood 
experience, 
or 
it 
is 
a 
product 
of 
phantasy, 
a 
species 
of 
the 
craving 
for 
security. 
It 
may 
represent 
a 
symbol, 
a 
trade-mark 
as 
it 
were, 
for 
a 
certain 
mode 
of 
reaction, 
now 
and 
then 
reaching 
development 
or 
being 
reformed 
only 
at 
a 
later 
period 
often 
when 
the 
neurosis 



is 
already 
fully 
developed. 
Being 
obviously 
the 
effect 
of 
a 
sort 
of 
economy 
of 
thought, 
which 
is 
furnished 
by 
the 
principle 
of 
least 
resistance 
(Avenarius), 
it 
is 
never 
of 
consequence 
as 
far 
as 
its 
content 
is 
concerned, 
but 
only 
as 
an 
abstract 
scheme 
or 
as 
the 
remnant 
of 
a 
psychic 
experience 
in 
which 
the 
will 
to 
power 
once, 
filled 
its 
destiny. 
This 
schematic 
fiction, 
no 
matter 
how 
concretely 
it 
may 
manifest 
itself, 
is 
never 
to 
be 
understood 
otherwise 
than 
in 
an 
allegorical 
sense. 
In 
it 
is 
reflected 
an 
actual 
constituent 
part 
of 
experience 
together 
with 
a 
" 
moral 
" 
both 
of 
which 
are 
retained 
by 
memory 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
the 
self-assurance 
that 
is 
aimed 
at, 
either 
as 
a 
memento, 
to 
adhere 
more 
tenaciously 
to 
the 
guiding 
principle 
or 
as 
a 
fore-judgment 
not 
to 
abandon 
it. 
None 
of 
these 
memory 
pictures 
has 
ever 
had 
pathogenic 
significance, 
like 
a 
psychic 
trauma 
for 
instance, 
and 
it 
is 
only 
when 
the 
neurosis 
supervenes, 
when 
the 
feeling 
of 
degradation 
of 
the 
egoconsciousness 
leads 
to 
the 
masculine 
protest 
and 
because 
of 
this 
to 
a 
closer 
attachment 
to 
the 
already 
long 
established 
compensatory 
guiding 
principles 
are 
these 
memory 
pictures 
hunted 
out 
from 
material 
belonging 
to 
a 
remote 
past 
and 
come 
to 
light 
because 
of 
their 
usefulness, 
partly 
in 
order 
to 
make 
possible 
the 
neurotic's 
conduct 
and 
partly 
to 
give 
it 
meaning. 
Here 
belong 
above 
all 
pain, 
anxiety 
and 
affect 
predispositions 
which 
are 
based 
upon 
such 
reminiscences 
which 
may 
become 
actualized 
in 
an 
hallucinatory 
manner, 
and 
which 
may 
be 
likened 
to 
visual 
and 
auditory 
hallucinations. 
Naturally 
those 
reminiscences 
will 
be 
typical 
which 
stand 
in 
the 
closest 
possible 
relation 
to 
the 
guiding 
principle 
because 
they 
represent 
or 
simulate 
for 
the 
neurotic, 
clinging 
as 
he 
does 
to 
the 
guiding 
principle, 
both 
the 
greater 
and 
smaller 
detours 
of 
which 
he 
has 
to 
avail 
himself 
in 
order 
to 
elevate 
his 
ego 
consciousness. 
The 
characteristic 
of 
the 
neurotic 
psyche 
is 
only 
its 
tenacious 
adherence 
to 
the 
guiding 
principle. 
It 
is 
the 
contradictions 
with 
reality, 
the 
conflicts 
which 
arise 
from 
them 
and 
the 
urgency 
to 
acquire 
social 
importance 
and 
power, 
which 
bring 
form 
the 
symptoms. 
This 
is 
even 
more 
obvious 
in 
such 
psychoses 
where 
the 
guiding 
principle 
appears 
most 
subtly. 
Misinterpretations 
of 
reality 
are 
undertaken, 
and 
demonstrations 
result, 
merely, 
so 
to 
speak, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
proof. 
In 
both 
instances, 
the 
patient 
behaves 
as 
though 
he 
had 
the 
goal 
constantly 
before 
his 
eyes. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
the 
neuroses 
he 
exaggerates 
and 
combats 
the 
real 
obstacles 
to 
the 
maximation 
of 
his 
ego-consciousness 
or 
seeks 
to 
avoid 
them 
by 
the 
construction 
of 
excuses. 
The 
psychotic 
individual 
clinging 
as 
he 
does 
to 
his 
idea 
(fixe 
idee) 



seeks 
to 
ignore 
reality 
or 
to 
transform 
it 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
make 
it 
correspond 
with 
his 
unreal 
standpoint. 
Freud, 
who 
has 
done 
so 
much 
toward 
the 
discovery 
of 
symbolism 
in 
the 
neurosis 
and 
psychosis, 
has 
called 
attention 
to 
the 
galaxy 
of 
symbols. 
Unfortunately 
he 
has 
carried 
his 
investigations 
only 
to 
the 
point 
of 
discovering 
the 
actual 
or 
possible 
sexual 
formulae 
in 
these 
symbols, 
and 
has 
not 
pursued 
their 
further 
elucidation 
into 
the 
dynamic 
eventuality 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
of 
striving 
" 
upward." 
Thus 
it 
happened 
that 
for 
him 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
neurosis 
became 
exhausted 
in 
the 
conversion 
of 
libidinous 
stimuli 
whereas, 
in 
reality 
that 
which 
lies 
behind 
the 
symbolism 
is 
the 
appearance 
of 
or 
the 
actual 
impulsion 
toward 
a 
maximation 
of 
the 
masculine 
ego-consciousness. 


We 
have 
described 
the 
guiding 
ideal 
of 
the 
ego 
as 
a 
fiction, 
thus 
denying 
its 
reality, 
but 
we 
must 
nevertheless 
assert 
that 
although 
unreal 
it 
is 
of 
the 
greatest 
importance 
for 
the 
process 
of 
life, 
and 
for 
the 
psychic 
development. 
Vaihinger 
in 
his 
" 
Philosophy 
of 
As 
If 
" 
has 
given 
a 
brilliant 
elucidation 
of 
this 
apparent 
contradiction, 
and 
recognized 
the 
fiction 
as 
an 
opposition 
to 
reality 
but 
as 
indispensable 
for 
the 
development 
of 
science. 
Reference 
to 
this 
singular 
relationship 
in 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
neuroses 
was 
first 
made 
by 
me 
and 
I 
was 
considerably 
assisted 
and 
confirmed 
in 
my 
view 
by 
Vaihinger 
's 
work. 
I 
am 
thus 
in 
a 
position 
to 
say 
something 
concerning 
the 
fiction 
of 
ego-
consciousness, 
and 
to 
throw 
some 
light 
on 
its 
significance 
as 
well 
as 
on 
its 
mode 
of 
appearance 
in 
the 
psyche. 
It 
is 
first 
of 
all 
an 
abstraction 
and 
must 
in 
itself 
be 
regarded 
as 
the 
indication 
of 
an 
anticipation. 
It 
is, 
so 
to 
speak, 
the 
marshall's 
staff 
* 
in 
the 
wallet 
of 
the 
insignificant 
soldier, 
and 
may 
be 
looked 
upon 
as 
" 
payment 
on 
account 
" 
demanded 
by 
the 
primitive 
feeling 
of 
uncertainty. 


* 
For 
the 
benefit 
of 
psychologists 
of 
a 
keener 
insight, 
I 
note 
here 
that 
the 
prevalence 
of 
examples 
which 
have 
been 
taken 
from 
military 
life 
have 
been 
chosen 
by 
me 
with 
an 
especial 
object 
in 
view. 
In 
military 
training 
the 
starting 
point 
and 
fictive 
purpose 
are 
brought 
into 
closer 
relation, 
can 
be 
more 
readily 
noted, 
and 
every 
movement 
of 
the 
training 
soldier 
becomes 
a 
dexterity 
which 
has 
for 
its 
purpose 
the 
transformation 
of 
a 
primary 
feeling 
of 
weakness 
into 
a 
feeling 
of 
superiority. 
The 
construction 
of 
the 
fiction 
takes 
place 
by 
setting 
aside 
disquieting 



inferiorities 
and 
burdensome 
realities 
in 
the 
idea, 
as 
always 
happens 
when 
the 
psyche 
seeks 
certainty 
and 
escape 
from 
its 
restraint. 
The 
painful 
uncertainty 
is 
reduced 
to 
its 
lowest 
possible, 
albeit 
apparently 
casual 
amount, 
and 
this 
is 
transformed 
into 
its 
very 
antithesis 
which 
is 
in 
turn 
made 
into 
the 
fictive 
goal 
of 
every 
wish-phantasy 
and 
desire. 
It 
is 
then 
that 
this 
goal 
may 
be 
made 
concrete 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
becoming 
self-evident. 
For 
instance, 
the 
restriction 
of 
food 
in 
childhood 
is 
felt 
as 
an 
abstract 
" 
nothing," 
as 
want, 
in 
contrast 
to 
this 
feeling 
the 
child 
comes 
to 
long 
for 
" 
all," 
for 
superfluity 
until 
it 
brings 
this 
goal 
much 
nearer 
to 
the 
understanding 
in 
the 
person 
of 
the 
father, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
traditionally 
rich 
person, 
of 
a 
mighty 
Kaiser. 
The 
more 
intensely 
the 
deprivation 
was 
felt 
the 
more 
forcible 
is 
this 
imaginary 
abstract 
ideal 
constructed 
and 
starting 
therefrom 
begins 
the 
formation 
and 
classification 
of 
the 
given 
psychical 
forces 
to 
preparatory 
attitudes, 
facilities 
and 
traits 
of 
character. 
The 
individual 
then 
carries 
these 
traits 
of 
character 
demanded 
by 
the 
fictive 
goal 
just 
as 
the 
mask 
of 
the 
ancient 
actor 
persona 
was 
required 
to 
fit 
to 
the 
denouement 
of 
the 
tragedy. 
Should 
there 
stir 
in 
a 
boy 
doubt 
concerning 
his 
manliness, 
as 
happens 
in 
constitutionally 
inferior 
children, 
feeling 
as 
they 
do 
to 
be 
kindred 
to 
girls, 
he 
chooses 
a 
goal 
of 
such 
a 
nature 
as 
will 
give 
him 
mastery 
over 
women 
(usually 
also 
over 
all 
men). 
Through 
this 
his 
attitude 
toward 
women 
is 
determined 
at 
an 
early 
age. 
He 
will 
constantly 
show 
a 
tendency 
to 
bring 
about 
his 
superiority 
over 
women, 
will 
undervalue 
and 
degrade 
the 
feminine 
sex, 
will 
figuratively 
speaking 
raise 
the 
hand 
against 
his 
mother, 
which 
in 
neurotically 
disposed 
children 
often 
finds 
expression 
in 
a 
gesture 
or 
in 
their 
psychic 
attitude, 
and 
will 
in 
a 
playful 
manner 
take 
his 
model 
from 
the 
mother 
in 
order 
to 
test 
himself 
in 
the 
manly 
role 
before 
it. 
The 
development 
of 
this 
sort 
of 
infantile 
attitude 
of 
readiness 
where 
a 
rigid 
pedantic 
behavior 
becomes 
manifest, 
where 
the 
child's 
excited 
desire 
for 
mastery 
seeks 
a 
confirmation, 
and 
an 
assurance 
of 
his 
ego-
consciousness, 
similar 
to 
the 
one 
he 
has 
experienced 
from 
his 
mother, 
that 
is, 
conditions 
in 
which 
he 
is 
able 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
to 
satisfy 
his 
craving 
for 
security 
is 
already 
to 
be 
looked 
upon 
as 
a 
neurotic 
trait. 
It 
is 
only 
to 
this 
neurotic 
fixity 
of 
the 
uncertainty 
that 
Nietzsche's 
assertion 
is 
applicable, 
namely 
that 
" 
every 
one 
carries 
within 
him 
a 
portrait 
of 
womankind 
which 
he 
has 
derived 
from 
his 
mother, 
and 
which 
makes 
him 
honor 
woman 
or 
despise 
her 
or 
entertain 
a 
total 
indifference 
toward 
her." 
Yet 
we 
must 
concede 
that 
these 
individuals 
are 
in 
the 
majority. 
Among 
them 
are 
many 
who 
were 



disdained 
by 
their 
mother, 
since 
which 
time 
they 
fear 
a 
like 
setback 
from 
every 
woman, 
or 
demand 
from 
her 
an 
extraordinary 
measure 
of 
surrender. 


In 
the 
life 
and 
development 
of 
man 
there 
is 
nothing 
that 
sets 
to 
work 
with 
greater 
secrecy 
than 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
ideal 
of 
personality. 
If 
we 
inquire 
into 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
secrecy, 
it 
seems 
that 
the 
most 
important 
basis 
lies 
in 
the 
combative, 
not 
to 
say 
hostile 
character 
of 
this 
fiction. 
It 
has 
originated 
through 
a 
constant 
measuring 
and 
weighing 
of 
the 
advantages 
of 
others 
and 
must 
therefore 
bring 
about, 
according 
to 
the 
principle 
of 
antithesis 
which 
lies 
at 
the 
root 
of 
this 
process, 
the 
injury 
to 
others. 
The 
psychological 
analysis 
of 
the 
neurotic 
shows 
always 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
tendency 
to 
depreciation, 
which 
is 
summarily 
directed 
toward 
every 
one. 


The 
combative 
tendencies 
("Der 
Aggreesionstrieb 
im 
Leben 
und 
in 
der 
Neurose") 
become 
regularly 
manifest 
in 
greed, 
in 
envy, 
in 
longing 
for 
superiority. 
But 
the 
fiction 
of 
gaining 
the 
mastery 
over 
others 
can 
only 
be 
used, 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
if 
it 
does 
not 
disturb 
the 
combination 
of 
relations 
from 
the 
beginning. 
And 
therefore, 
this 
fiction 
must 
early 
become 
unrecognizable, 
must 
assume 
a 
disguise, 
or 
it 
destroys 
itself. 
This 
disguise 
takes 
place 
by 
the 
positing 
of 
an 
anti-fiction, 
which 
first 
of 
all 
directs 
visible 
conduct, 
and 
under 
the 
stress 
of 
which 
reality 
is 
approached, 
and 
the 
recognition 
of 
its 
effective 
forces 
is 
accomplished. 
This 
contrary 
fiction, 
always 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
current, 
corrective 
instances, 
brings 
about 
the 
formal 
change 
of 
the 
guiding 
fiction 
by 
pressing 
its 
own 
claim 
to 
consideration, 
by 
presenting 
for 
recognition 
social 
and 
ethical 
demands 
at 
their 
true 
value 
and 
thus 
assuring 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
thinking 
and 
acting. 
It 
is 
the 
security 
coefficient 
of 
the 
guiding 
line 
to 
power 
and 
the 
harmony 
of 
the 
two 
fictions, 
their 
mutual 
compatibility 
which 
is 
the 
sign 
of 
mental 
health. 
In 
the 
contrary 
fiction 
are 
active 
experience 
and 
education, 
social 
and 
cultural 
formulas, 
and 
the 
traditions 
of 
society. 
In 
times 
of 
good 
humor, 
of 
security, 
of 
normal 
conditions, 
of 
peace, 
this 
is 
the 
prevailing 
form, 
which 
causes 
a 
restraint 
of 
the 
combative 
predispositions 
and 
effects 
an 
adaptation 
of 
the 
traits 
of 
character 
to 
the 
environment. 
Should 
the 
insecurity 
increase 
and 
the 
consciousness 
of 
inferiority 
emerge, 
then 
the 
contrary-fiction 
is 
deprived 
of 
value 
because 
of 
an 
increasing 
abstraction 
from 
reality, 
the 
dexterities 
become 
mobilized, 
the 
nervous 
dogmatic 
character 
asserts 
itself 
and 
with 
it 
the 
exaggerated 
sense 
of 
ego-ideal. 
It 
is 
one 
of 
the 
triumphs 
of 
human 
wit 
to 



put 
through 
the 
guiding 
fiction 
by 
adapting 
it 
to 
the 
antifiction, 
to 
shine 
through 
modesty, 
to 
conquer 
by 
humility 
and 
submissiveness, 
to 
humiliate 
others 
by 
one's 
virtues, 
to 
attack 
others 
by 
one's 
own 
passivity, 
to 
cause 
pain 
to 
others 
by 
one's 
own 
suffering, 
to 
strive 
to 
attain 
the 
goal 
of 
manly 
force 
by 
effeminate 
means, 
to 
make 
oneself 
small 
in 
order 
to 
appear 
great. 
Of 
such 
sort, 
however, 
are 
often 
the 
expedients 
of 
neurotics. 


Concerning 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
most 
primitive 
perception 
and 
emotion 
as 
an 
abstraction 
I 
need 
waste 
no 
words. 
Just 
as 
abstract 
is 
the 
positing 
of 
an 
imaginary 
guiding 
point 
and 
of 
this 
life 
plan 
which 
is 
now 
spun 
out 
between 
these 
two 
points. 
With 
reference 
to 
the 
neurotic 
psyche 
we 
have 
repeatedly 
emphasized 
that 
it 
is 
the 
greater 
insecurity 
which 
alone 
tends 
to 
withdraw 
the 
guiding 
point 
still 
further 
from 
reality, 
to 
set 
it 
higher. 
In 
addition 
to 
this 
the 
inferior 
sense 
organs 
yield 
qualitatively 
and 
quantitatively 
changed 
sensations, 
and 
the 
organs 
of 
execution 
a 
changed 
technique 
usually 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
greater 
limitation, 
so 
that 
the 
self-esteem, 
the 
ideal 
guiding 
representation, 
the 
representation 
of 
the 
world 
and 
the 
life 
plan 
must 
be 
formed 
differently 
from 
normal 
representations 
of 
this 
sort, 
in 
that 
they 
are 
more 
abstract, 
less 
in 
conformity 
with 
reality. 
In 
this 
process 
it 
is 
true 
the 
compensation 
and 
overcompensation 
may 
sometimes 
bring 
the 
conception 
of 
the 
world 
and 
the 
line 
of 
reality 
nearer 
together 
as 
in 
the 
great 
performances 
of 
the 
neurotic 
psyche. 
The 
overtense 
personal 
ideal, 
however, 
which 
acquires 
absolute 
rigidity, 
which 
assumes 
nearly 
an 
identity 
with 
God, 
often 
lends 
to 
the 
nature 
and 
behavior 
of 
the 
neurotic 
and 
psychotic 
a 
pronounced 
hypomanic 
character, 
if 
the 
preparations 
therefore, 
the 
feeling 
of 
insignificance, 
the 
ideas 
of 
persecution 
did 
not 
counteract 
this 
character 
by 
causing 
a 
sort 
of 
inner 
certainty 
without 
which 
the 
positing 
of 
the 
goal 
would 
be 
impossible, 
by 
causing 
a 
feeling 
of 
predestination. 
In 
the 
phases 
of 
greater 
insecurity 
this 
characteristic 
is 
considerably 
stronger 
and 
its 
significance 
as 
anticipation 
of 
the 
guiding 
fiction, 
as 
payment 
on 
account 
becomes 
distinctly 
obvious. 


Gustave 
Freytag 
in 
his 
"Reminiscences 
of 
my 
Life" 
describes 
the 
usefulness 
of 
the 
compensatory 
performance 
in 
the 
following 
manner: 


“But 
too 
the 
bull's-eye-shot 
on 
the 
target 
is 
difficult 
to 
me. 
For 
at 
Oels 
I 
had 
noticed 
during 
the 
instruction 
that 
I 
was 
very 
near 
sighted. 
When 
I 
complained 
of 
this 
during 
the 
vacation 
to 
my 
father, 
he 
advised 
me 
to 
make 



my 
way 
through 
the 
world 
without 
glasses 
and 
told 
me 
a 
story 
illustrating 
the 
helplessness 
of 
a 
theologist 
who 
had 
made 
him 
get 
up 
out 
of 
bed 
one 
morning 
to 
hunt 
his 
spectacles 
so 
that 
he 
could 
find 
his 
trousers. 
I 
followed 
this 
advice 
and 
have 
accustomed 
myself 
to 
the 
use 
of 
spectacles 
only 
at 
the 
theatre 
and 
in 
looking 
at 
pictures. 
I 
sought 
to 
overcome 
the 
disadvantages 
under 
which 
I 
labored 
in 
society 
from 
this 
defect 
and 
overlooked 
much 
unsuspectedly 
which 
would 
have 
disgusted 
a 
sharper 
observer. 
I 
was 
often 
obliged 
to 
forego 
the 
enjoyment 
of 
flowers, 
beauty 
in 
dress, 
of 
remarkable 
countenances 
and 
beauty 
in 
women 
from 
which 
others 
derived 
pleasure. 
But 
as 
the 
same 
adjusted 
itself 
adroitly 
to 
this 
defect 
of 
sense, 
there 
was 
soon 
developed 
in 
me 
a 
good 
understanding 
of 
those 
expressions 
of 
life 
which 
came 
within 
my 
range 
of 
vision 
and 
a 
quick 
divination 
of 
much 
which 
was 
not 
clear 
to 
me; 
the 
smaller 
number 
of 
the 
perceptions 
permitted 
me 
to 
elaborate 
those 
which 
were 
perceived 
with 
greater 
ease 
and 
perhaps 
more 
profoundly. 
At 
any 
rate 
the 
loss 
was 
greater 
than 
the 
gain. 
But 
my 
father 
was 
thus 
far 
right, 
my 
eyes 
preserved 
unchanged 
throughout 
my 
entire 
life 
their 
keenness 
of 
vision 
at 
close 
distances." 


If 
one 
imagines 
the 
development 
of 
a 
visual 
phantasy 
of 
this 
sort 
which 
constantly 
draws 
away 
from 
reality 
goaded 
by 
the 
pressure 
of 
the 
craving 
for 
security, 
there 
results 
for 
the 
same 
purpose 
of 
obtaining 
security 
as 
in 
the 
above 
cited 
example, 
an 
ability 
to 
produce 
visual 
hallucinations 
which 
can 
manifest 
itself 
even 
outside 
of 
dream 
states, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
presenting 
warnings 
to 
preserve 
personal 
security 
and 
encouraging 
consolations. 
The 
abstractions 
and 
also 
the 
anticipations 
have 
even 
gone 
farther 
and 
may 
lead 
to 
the 
well 
known 
remarkable 
pathological 
expressions 
of 
the 
" 
telepaths 
" 
or 
Cassandra 
natures. 


The 
disquieting 
consciousness 
of 
inferiority 
gives 
a 
terrible 
incentive 
to 
this 
reaching 
out 
beyond 
the 
limits 
of 
human 
possibilities 
here 
as 
in 
other 
instances, 
and 
this 
consciousness 
finding 
refuge 
in 
weakness 
ascribes 
to 
others 
a 
greater 
power 
of 
vision, 
as 
though 
they 
could 
see 
what 
was 
hidden, 
could 
read 
the 
thoughts. 
The 
child 
in 
his 
craving 
for 
security 
with 
his 
natural 
secrecy 
may 
early 
incline 
to 
just 
this 
point 
in 
order 
to 
gain 
security, 
and 
act 
under 
the 
imaginary 
assumption 
that 
others 
can 
" 
see 
into 
his 
heart," 
can 
divine 
his 
most 
hidden 
thoughts, 
an 
assumption 
which 
often 
makes 
its 
appearance 
as 
an 
expedient 
in 
the 
neurosis 
and 
psychosis 
and 
has 
the 
same 



value 
as 
the 
exaggerated 
feeling 
of 
guilt, 
perhaps, 
and 
neurotic 
conscientiousness, 
and 
whose 
purpose 
is 
to 
avoid 
a 
degradation 
of 
self-
esteem, 
shame, 
punishment, 
mockery, 
humiliation, 
the 
feminine 
role, 
death. 


The 
increased 
capacity 
of 
the 
neurotic 
for 
abstractions 
for 
anticipations 
is 
not 
only 
at 
the 
root 
of 
his 
hallucinatory 
character, 
of 
his 
fantasies 
and 
his 
dreams 
but 
also 
of 
the 
over-exertion 
of 
organ 
functioning 
of 
which 
he 
makes 
use 
in 
purposeful 
efforts 
as 
preparations 
for 
the 
combat. 
Thus 
the 
neurotic 
makes 
for 
himself 
a 
place 
by 
more 
abstract 
prevision 
and 
premeditation, 
and 
constructs 
thereof, 
that 
neurotic 
foresight 
which 
is 
regularly 
present 
in 
this 
disease, 
by 
means 
of 
which 
the 
patient 
holds 
the 
possibilities 
of 
experience 
constantly 
before 
him 
arranged 
dogmatically 
and 
in 
sharply 
antithetical 
groups 
according 
to 
the 
Scheme 
" 
Triumph 
Defeat." 
Or 
he 
places 
his 
environment 
under 
ban 
by 
heightening 
the 
sensibility 
of 
his 
organs 
(which 
is 
the 
first 
step 
towards 
hallucinations) 
snowing 
hypersensibility 
to 
smells, 
sounds, 
touch, 
temperature, 
tastes 
and 
pains, 
and 
this 
brings 
his 
undertakings 
constantly 
into 
harmony 
with 
his 
imaginary 
masculine 
guiding 
principle. 
Foolishness 
and 
superstitious 
convictions 
of 
a 
hopeless 
destiny, 
the 
firm 
seated 
belief 
in 
one's 
own 
ill 
luck 
serve 
the 
same 
purpose 
of 
satisfying 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
by 
constructing 
the 
proof 
that 
caution 
is 
necessary. 
The 
hallucinatory 
awakening 
of 
anxiety 
works 
in 
the 
same 
direction, 
of 
which 
the 
neurotic 
makes 
extensive 
use. 


That 
the 
traits 
of 
character 
as 
well 
as 
the 
emotional 
predispositions 
serve 
the 
guiding 
fiction, 
it 
is 
the 
purpose 
of 
this 
book 
to 
prove 
to 
the 
fullest 
degree. 
The 
guiding 
line 
of 
the 
neurotic 
leading 
in 
a 
directly 
perpendicular 
line 
upwards 
demand's 
peculiar 
expedients 
and 
forms 
of 
life 
which 
are 
included 
under 
the 
little 
uniform 
concept 
of 
the 
neurotic 
symptoms. 
Now 
one 
finds 
safety-devices 
at 
remote 
places, 
prohibitory 
arrangements, 
protective 
combats, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
assuring 
success 
to 
the 
central 
impulse, 
the 
will 
to 
power, 
then 
again 
there 
are, 
and 
these 
are 
often 
difficult 
to 
understand, 
circuitous 
ways 
comparable 
to 
secret 
paths, 
taken 
so 
as 
not 
to 
lose 
the 
guiding 
line 
when 
the 
direct 
way 
to 
the 
masculine 
triumph 
is 
barred. 
Often 
a 
change 
of 
nervous 
phenomena 
is 
observed 
which 
resembles 
tentative 
experiments, 
until 
the 
more 
severe 
symptom 
guarantees 
a 
concordance 
with 
the 
guiding 
idea. 


I 
believe 
too 
that 
I 
have 
presented 
in 
the 
present 
work 
these 
symptoms 



and 
their 
psycho-genesis 
coherently 
and 
to 
a 
sufficient 
extent. 
They 
all 
rest 
on 
dexterity 
acquired 
by 
long 
practice 
and 
preparation 
whose 
hypervalency 
is 
supported 
through 
the 
medium 
of 
and 
is 
founded 
on 
the 
fitness 
for 
the 
combat 
to 
preserve 
the 
ideal 
self-esteem. 
The 
preparations 
themselves 
commence 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
neurosis, 
accompany 
the 
development 
of 
the 
idea 
of 
personal 
worth 
and 
are 
adapted 
to 
it. 
They 
are 
most 
clearly 
recognized 
in 
the 
reminiscences 
of 
childhood 
which 
have 
been 
presented 
in 
the 
oft 
returning 
dreams, 
in 
the 
mimic, 
the 
habitus, 
in 
the 
play 
of 
children, 
in 
their 
phantasies, 
concerning 
future 
vocations, 
concerning 
the 
future. 


It 
lies 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
too 
elevated 
guiding 
idea 
that 
it 
should 
estrange 
the 
person 
who 
entertains 
it, 
that 
is 
the 
neurotic, 
from 
reality. 
Not 
infrequently 
this 
condition 
manifests 
itself 
in 
a 
" 
feeling 
of 
strangeness 
" 
which 
is 
again 
over-estimated 
and 
used 
with 
a 
view 
to 
a 
certain 
effect, 
i.e., 
to 
recommend 
a 
cautious 
retreat 
in 
an 
insecure 
situation. 
Apparently 
opposite 
to 
this 
" 
back 
" 
an 
unjustified 
feeling 
of 
confidence 
in 
a 
situation, 
the 
feeling 
of 
"Deja 
vu" 
sometimes 
becomes 
manifest, 
often 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
concealed 
analogy 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
warning 
or 
encouraging.* 


* 
The 
feeling 
of 
strangeness 
and 
the 
feeling 
of 
familiarity 
in 
the 
neurosis 
are 
analogous 
to 
the 
image 
of 
warning 
and 
exhortation 
of 
an 
inner 
voice 
in 
the 
dream, 
the 
hallucination 
and 
the 
attitude 
in 
the 
psychosis. 
In 
neurotic 
students 
I 
have 
sometimes 
observed 
that, 
led 
by 
the 
feeling 
of 
their 
predestination, 
scholars 
have 
sought 
a 
hearing 
on 
subjects 
with 
which 
they 
were 
wholly 
unfamiliar 
with 
the 
result 
of 
total 
failure. 
Such 
experiences 
may 
cause 
the 
neurotic 
to 
be 
suspicious 
of 
his 
emphasized 
feeling 
of 
" 
self-
confidence 
" 
which 
may 
emerge, 
as 
though 
he 
preserved 
a 
bad 
after-taste. 
The 
security 
through 
the 
exaggerated 
idea 
of 
self-esteem 
and 
the 
adherence 
to 
it 
determines 
often 
the 
feeling 
of 
or 
even 
a 
real 
condition 
of 
estrangement 
from 
the 
world, 
which 
indeed 
is 
usually 
exaggerated 
with 
a 
definite 
purpose. 
Fear 
for 
everything 
now, 
ponderousness, 
awkwardness, 
bashfulness, 
then 
accompany 
the 
neurotic 
who 
avoids 
reality 
and 
reveals 
his 
efforts 
to 
reinterpret, 
reconstruct 
and 
remodel 
it. 
This 
deficiency 
also 
seeks 
its 
compensation 
and 
in 
less 
severe 
cases 
finds 
it 
in 
the 
antifiction 
leading 
to 
reality, 
which 
again 
in 
an 
abstract, 
usually 
urgent 
form 
seeks 
to 
overestimate 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
reality 
from 
exaggerated 
fear 
of 
it 
in 
order 
to 
raise 
up 



preparations 
against 
error 
and 
defect 
at 
all 
times. 
The 
vacillation 
between 
the 
ideal 
and 
the 
real 
manifests 
itself 
in 
an 
extreme 
way 
in 
the 
neurotic 
psyche, 
in 
which 
the 
passion 
for 
doubting 
assumes 
the 
form 
of 
a 
paradigm 
for 
the 
real 
" 
truth," 
as 
the 
final 
goal 
of 
power 
which 
the 
neurotic 
is 
to 
attain. 
Or 
the 
outer 
forms 
are 
pedantically 
held 
to 
and 
over-estimated 
as 
is 
a 
fetish, 
and 
as 
though 
they 
guaranteed 
security. 
The 
following 
sentence 
from 
Hebel's 
letters 
(E. 
W. 
Werner, 
from 
Hebel's 
youth, 
Oesterreichische 
Kundschau, 
1911) 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
indicate 
this 
feature. 


" 
One 
can 
never 
pay 
sufficient 
honor 
to 
the 
outer 
forms 
which 
in 
youth 
are 
so 
thoughtlessly 
ridiculed, 
for 
they 
are 
the 
only 
lines 
which 
assist 
in 
making 
decisions 
in 
the 
restlessly 
changing 
world 
without 
law 
or 
order 
" 
In 
small 
things 
as 
in 
great 
this 
craving 
for 
security 
is 
always 
manifested 
and 
humanity 
is 
always 
seeking 
it 
by 
analogies, 
and 
by 
abstract 
dogmatic 
methods. 


The 
frequency 
of 
sexual 
guiding 
lines 
in 
the 
neuroses 
is 
explained 
in 
unprejudiced 
analyses 
upon 
the 
following 
grounds: 


1. 
Because 
they 
furnish 
a 
suitable 
form 
of 
expression 
for 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
2. 
Because 
it 
lies 
within 
the 
option 
of 
the 
patient 
to 
feel 
them 
as 
real. 
Therefore, 
the 
adaptation 
of 
the 
sexual 
imaginary 
guiding 
line 
depends 
also 
on 
its 
value 
in 
procuring 
security 
for 
the 
feeling 
of 
self-esteem, 
on 
its 
significance 
as 
an 
abstraction 
and 
quality 
of 
exciting 
hallucinations, 
and 
on 
its 
quality 
of 
easily 
receiving 
a 
concrete 
form 
and 
because 
it 
admits 
of 
anticipations. 
According 
to 
this 
the 
hallucinatory 
character 
of 
the 
neurotic 
is 
a 
peculiar 
instance 
of 
the 
mechanism 
of 
security. 
It 
makes 
use, 
as 
does 
thinking 
and 
speech, 
of 
the 
primitive 
recollections 
reduced 
to 
the 
smallest 
dynamic 
measure 
to 
which 
he 
is 
drawn 
by 
means 
of 
the 
abstracting 
power 
of 
the 
craving 
for 
security. 
Its 
function 
and 
office 
is 
to 
calculate 
the 
way 
to 
the 
desired 
heights 
by 
use 
of 
analogy 
from 
experiences 
which 
have 
their 
place 
in 
childhood 
in 
emphasizing 
set-backs 
that 
have 
been 
endured 
or 
comforting 
memories 
of 
evils 
that 
have 
been 
overcome. 
The 
hallucinatory 
power 
represents 
a 
completed 
preparation 
accomplished 
by 
the 
overstrained 
craving 
for 
security, 
and 
takes 
its 
material, 
as 
does 
also 
the 
function 
of 
thought 
and 
premeditation 
from 
the 
cast-iron 



element 
of 
the 
neurotically 
directed 
memory. 
That 
which 
is 
called 
regression 
in 
dream 
and 
in 
hallucinations 
by 
other 
writers 
is 
the 
every-day 
process 
of 
thought 
which 
gropes 
back 
to 
experience, 
and 
can 
only 
refer 
to 
the 
material 
of 
the 
dreams 
and 
hallucinations, 
but 
never 
to 
their 
dynamics. 


The 
psychic 
dynamic 
of 
an 
hallucination 
consist 
therefore 
in 
this, 
that 
in 
a 
situation 
of 
uncertainty, 
a 
guiding 
line 
is 
sought 
with 
might 
and 
is 
hypostasized 
by 
means 
of 
an 
abstraction, 
per 
analogium 
with 
the 
evaluation 
of 
experience, 
by 
means 
of 
anticipation 
and 
by 
means 
of 
a 
fictitious 
rendition 
of 
something 
closely 
related 
to 
a 
sensory 
perception. 
This 
latter 
ability 
as 
the 
most 
effective 
means 
of 
expression 
may, 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
anti-fiction 
which 
inclines 
to 
reality, 
be 
felt 
as 
in 
conscious 
opposition 
to 
reality 
as 
in 
dreams, 
or 
in 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
dissolves 
the 
anti-fiction 
and 
permits 
the 
hallucination 
to 
be 
felt 
as 
real. 


Jodl 
defined 
civilization 
as 
" 
the 
increased 
effort 
of 
man 
under 
certain 
circumstances 
and 
with 
special 
intensity 
to 
secure 
his 
person 
and 
life 
against 
hostile 
powers 
of 
nature 
as 
well 
as 
from 
the 
antagonism 
of 
his 
fellow 
men, 
to 
satisfy 
his 
needs 
both 
real 
and 
ideal 
in 
a 
greater 
measure 
and 
to 
bring 
his 
nature 
without 
obstacle 
to 
development." 


The 
neurotic 
individual 
holds 
the 
guiding 
line 
much 
more 
constantly 
in 
view, 
but 
may 
accordingly 
need 
to 
bring 
to 
expression 
schematically 
and 
dogmatically 
the 
guiding 
line 
which 
leads 
to 
the 
transcendental 
or 
the 
anti-
fiction 
which 
tends 
to 
culture, 
the 
latter 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
a 
neurotic 
circuitous 
way, 
in 
which, 
for 
example, 
he 
seems 
to 
submit 
to 
an 
extreme 
degree 
to 
the 
" 
antagonism 
of 
his 
fellow 
men 
" 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
triumphing 
over 
them. 


The 
evolution 
of 
the 
effort 
to 
bring 
his 
nature 
to 
the 
fullest 
development, 
to 
attain 
the 
pinnacle 
of 
that 
which 
the 
neurotic 
individual 
may 
call 
his 
culture 
leads 
us 
back 
again 
to 
the 
already 
mentioned 
preparations 
so 
important 
from 
a 
psychological 
point 
of 
view, 
to 
the 
tentative 
efforts 
which 
are 
supposed 
to 
be 
introduced 
by 
the 
original 
consciousness 
of 
inferiority. 


All 
the 
imperfect 
organs 
in 
a 
state 
of 
infantile 
development 
strive 
with 
all 
their 
connate 
capacities 
and 
possibilities 
of 
development 
to 
form 
purposeful, 
so 
to 
speak, 
intelligent 
preparatory 
arrangements. 
In 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
constitutionally 
inferior 
organs 
with 
their 
numerous 
abortive 
performances 
arises, 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
greater 
tension 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
external 
world, 
the 
impression 
of 
uncertainty, 
the 
self



esteem 
of 
the 
child 
brings 
forward 
a 
permanent 
consciousness 
of 
inferiority. 
Thus 
it 
happens 
that 
already 
in 
early 
childhood 
the 
mastery 
of 
the 
situation 
according 
to 
an 
example 
taken 
as 
a 
model 
or 
to 
dominate 
the 
situation 
even 
far 
beyond 
the 
power 
indicated 
in 
the 
model 
is 
taken 
as 
the 
guiding 
motive 
and 
a 
permanent 
impulse 
of 
will 
is 
founded 
which 
hands 
over 
the 
permanent 
guidance 
to 
a 
directing 
idea 
" 
the 
will 
to 
power." 
The 
positing 
of 
a 
goal 
in 
the 
neurotic 
character 
is 
a 
phase 
of 
the 
same 
tendency. 
This 
goal 
corresponds 
consciously 
or 
unconsciously 
to 
the 
formula: 
' 
I 
must 
act 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
in 
the 
end 
I 
become 
the 
master 
of 
the 
situation." 
Long 
continuation 
of 
the 
child 
in 
the 
phase 
of 
consciousness 
of 
inferiority 
leads 
to 
a 
heightening 
and 
strengthening 
of 
the 
intensity 
of 
that 
formula, 
so 
that 
from 
the 
unusual 
intensity 
of 
all 
efforts, 
the 
preparatory 
actions 
and 
the 
predispositions, 
the 
traits 
of 
character 
of 
any 
period 
of 
development 
may 
be 
inferred 
as 
original 
consciousness 
of 
inferiority. 
Also 
in 
organs 
falling 
below 
the 
normal 
standard 
the 
tentative 
efforts 
are 
manifested, 
which 
produce 
preparations 
and 
expedients 
in 
walking, 
seeing, 
eating, 
hearing. 
Exner 
emphasizes 
that 
these 
tentative 
efforts 
are 
like 
those 
which 
precede 
the 
grasping 
of 
the 
sound 
combinations 
when 
children 
are 
learning 
to 
speak. 
Much 
more 
convulsive 
in 
form 
are 
the 
preliminary 
processes 
in 
the 
defective 
organ, 
whose 
preparations 
and 
methods 
of 
functioning 
in 
favorable 
examples 
of 
over-compensation, 
are 
in 
height, 
light 
artistic 
performances 
and 
perfection, 
but 
which 
often 
as 
in 
the 
neurosis 
because 
of 
the 
close 
guard 
kept 
and 
the 
cautiousness, 
rarely 
attain 
full 
development. 
The 
child 
seeks 
to 
learn 
his 
faults 
in 
the 
way 
offered 
him 
by 
the 
craving 
for 
security, 
and 
seeks 
to 
remedy 
them 
or 
to 
gain 
advantage 
from 
them 
in 
using 
them 
as 
an 
expedient. 
As 
he 
does 
not 
know 
the 
real 
reason 
for 
his 
inferiority, 
often 
from 
pride 
does 
not 
wish 
to 
know 
them, 
he 
is 
easily 
misled 
to 
ascribe 
them 
to 
external 
reasons, 
to 
blame 
the 
" 
spits 
of 
objects 
" 
or 
usually, 
his 
relatives, 
and 
assumes 
then 
an 
aggressive, 
hostile 
attitude 
to 
the 
real 
objective 
world. 
Usually 
he 
retains 
a 
foreboding, 
a 
presentiment 
of 
ill-luck 
as 
an 
abstract 
reminder 
of 
his 
feelings 
of 
inferiority, 
which 
he 
is 
likely 
to 
exaggerate, 
often 
develops 
to 
a 
feeling 
of 
guilt, 
if 
circumstances 
admit 
of 
this, 
in 
order 
to 
unfold 
his 
pre-vision, 
his 
foresight 
with 
good 
reason. 
The 
neurotic 
endeavors 
are 
above 
all 
directed 
towards 
enlarging 
and 
securing 
the 
boundaries 
of 
self-esteem 
by 
constantly 
estimating 
and 
testing 
the 
powers 
in 
the 
difficulties 
of 
the 
objective 
world. 



To 
over-exertion 
in 
this 
effort 
may 
be 
traced 
many 
of 
the 
traits 
of 
the 
neurotic 
his 
inclination 
to 
play 
with 
fire, 
to 
make 
dangerous 
situations 
and 
hunt 
for 
them, 
his 
pleasure 
in 
the 
gruesome 
and 
the 
diabolical 
(Michel). 
The 
inclination 
to 
crime, 
like 
the 
sadistic 
inclination 
lies 
in 
the 
masculine 
guiding 
line, 
but 
is 
often 
neutralized 
by 
the 
contradictory 
idea 
which 
develops 
and 
is 
more 
often 
exaggerated 
in 
memory, 
with 
the 
purpose 
of 
warning 
from 
execution. 
, 


Nervousness, 
by 
preference, 
utilizes 
organic 
defectiveness, 
the 
infantile 
defects, 
the 
sense 
of 
ill-health 
in 
general, 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
securing 
the 
ego-consciousness 
against 
the 
requirements 
of 
parental 
authority, 
usually 
by 
means 
of 
a 
stubborn 
revolt, 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
postponing 
by 
a 
sort 
of 
artificial 
obstruction 
decisions 
and 
collisions 
which 
might 
be 
dangerous 
to 
the 
masculine 
fiction, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
relinquishing 
of 
certain 
positions 
of 
advantage 
in 
order 
to 
retain 
more 
important 
ones. 
Indeed 
the 
neurotic 
individual 
often 
seeks 
minor 
defeats, 
even 
brings 
them 
about 
artificially, 
or 
assumes 
dangerous 
outlooks 
in 
order 
thereby, 
to 
justify 
his 
neurotic 
acts 
and 
caution. 
In 
neurotically 
retained 
childhood 
defects 
a 
special 
refractoriness 
and 
strong 
aggression 
against 
the 
father 
and 
mother 
may 
be 
expected. 


Thus 
a 
compulsory 
striving 
toward 
the 
understanding 
of 
objective 
difficulties, 
efforts 
to 
overcome 
them, 
to 
gain 
the 
mastery, 
to 
combat 
them, 
undervaluation 
and 
depreciation 
of 
life 
and 
its 
joys 
or 
flight 
from 
them 
characterize 
a 
phase 
of 
the 
neurosis. 
Along 
with 
this 
the 
fact 
very 
frequently 
comes 
to 
light 
that 
the 
patient 
is 
very 
enthusiastic 
for 
life, 
for 
work, 
for 
love 
and 
marriage, 
but 
platonically, 
while 
secretly 
he 
bars 
the 
access 
to 
them 
through 
the 
neurosis, 
in 
order 
to 
make 
sure 
of 
his 
domination 
in 
the 
more 
limited 
field 
of 
the 
family 
with 
the 
father 
and 
mother. 


This 
outwardly 
directed 
anxious 
and 
cautious 
glance 
of 
the 
neurotic 
which 
is 
intended 
to 
preserve 
the 
guiding 
fiction 
is 
regularly 
accompanied 
by 
a 
self-observation 
of 
a 
higher 
intensity. 
Sometimes 
in 
a 
situation 
of 
psychic 
uncertainty 
the 
personified, 
deified 
guiding 
idea 
is 
met 
with 
as 
a 
second 
self, 
as 
an 
inner 
voice 
like 
the 
Daemon 
of 
Socrates 
which 
warns, 
encourages, 
punishes, 
accuses. 
And 
that 
which 
the 
neurasthenics 
and 
hypochondriacs 
relate 
to 
us 
concerning 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
they 
inwardly 
rage, 
how 
keenly 
they 
examine 
and 
follow 
every 
act 
of 
their 
lives 
is 
true 
of 
neurotics 
generally. 



The 
self-observation 
may 
lead 
to 
a 
limitation 
of 
the 
field 
of 
combat, 
through 
it 
it 
utilizes 
expressions 
of 
fear 
of 
sickness, 
by 
means 
of 
which 
the 
neurotic 
individual 
is 
always 
in 
a 
position 
to 
beat 
a 
retreat 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
security. 
It 
must 
be 
thought 
of 
as 
effective, 
when 
the 
primitive 
expedients 
for 
gaining 
security, 
such 
as 
anxiety, 
shame, 
bashfulness, 
or 
the 
more 
complex 
ones, 
as 
modesty, 
conscientiousness, 
nervous 
attacks, 
accompany 
the 
presentiment 
of 
a 
defeat, 
in 
order 
not 
to 
allow 
the 
self-esteem 
to 
sink 
below 
the 
required 
level. 
Self-observation 
and 
self-esteem 
always 
excited 
and 
reenforced 
by 
the 
guiding 
fiction 
so 
that 
a 
base 
of 
operation 
is 
offered 
and 
the 
aggressions 
introduced 
produce 
immediately 
the 
neurotic, 
dogmatic 
traits 
of 
character, 
of 
envy, 
greed, 
tyranny, 
etc. 
The 
exaggerated 
introspection 
plays 
a 
constant 
role 
in 
the 
continuous 
measuring 
and 
wrestling 
of 
the 
neurotic 
individual 
to 
test 
his 
own 
worth 
against 
that 
of 
others, 
it 
gives 
hints 
to 
premeditation 
and 
phantasy 
and 
announces 
its 
presence 
when 
the 
patient 
avoids 
making 
a 
decision 
or 
when 
for 
the 
same 
purpose 
he 
gives 
himself 
up 
permanently 
to 
doubt. 
That 
all 
these 
introspections 
originate 
from 
the 
feeling 
of 
Insufficiency 
and 
are 
influenced 
by 
it 
is 
just 
as 
easy 
to 
understand, 
as 
that 
they 
finally 
reach 
the 
goal 
to 
which 
they 
in 
reality 
tend, 
i.e., 
caution. 
Thus 
introspection 
is 
at 
once 
hesitation, 
egotism, 
megalomania, 
doubt, 
self-depreciatory 
psychosis, 
and 
stands 
in 
connection 
with 
all 
other 
phenomena 
which 
are 
caused 
by 
the 
consciousness 
of 
inferiority. 
It 
serves 
especially 
for 
the 
reenforcement 
and 
testing 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
of 
characteristics 
such 
as 
courage, 
pride, 
ambition, 
etc., 
as 
well 
as 
the 
purpose 
of 
increasing 
all 
those 
tendencies 
whose 
acme 
is 
security, 
such 
as 
economy, 
exactness, 
industry, 
cleanliness. 
It 
influences 
the 
attention 
and 
serves 
also 
to 
dominate 
it, 
so 
that 
it 
occupies 
a 
prominent 
position 
in 
that 
mesh 
of 
traits 
whose 
object 
it 
is 
to 
gain 
security. 
The 
results, 
however, 
at 
which 
it 
arrives 
are 
purposely 
falsified. 
It 
would 
be 
very 
erroneous 
to 
regard 
it 
as 
libidinous 
or 
as 
pleasure 
producing. 
Its 
function 
is 
rather 
to 
group 
all 
the 
impressions 
of 
the 
objective 
world 
and 
to 
bring 
them 
under 
a 
single 
test, 
in 
such 
a 
way, 
so 
to 
speak, 
that 
the 
primary 
uncertainty 
of 
the 
individual 
shall 
be 
assured 
from 
being 
unmasked 
by 
a 
mathematical 
or 
statistical 
guarantee 
according 
to 
the 
standard 
of 
probability, 
i.e., 
that 
the 
individual 
shall 
escape 
a 
defeat. 
I 
first 
called 
attention 
to 
the 
dynamic 
of 
the 
neurosis 
in 
the 
" 
Neurotic 
Disposition 
" 
and 
the 
object 
of 
the 
present 
work 
is 
to 
present 
it 
in 
a 
more 
profound 
and 
extended 
form. 
The 
purposeful 
and 
profound 
introspection, 
therefore, 
is 
in 
line 
with 
the 
neurosis, 
even 
though 
in 



philosophy, 
psychology 
and 
in 
self-knowledge 
it 
has 
produced 
excellent 
fruit. 
It 
is 
the 
private 
philosophy 
of 
the 
neurotic 
which 
fails 
to 
hit 
the 
mark 
of 
reality, 
and 
whose 
mania, 
corrigible 
by 
analysis, 
has 
its 
analogy 
in 
the 
" 
know 
thyself 
" 
of 
the 
sublime 
philosophers. 
The 
largely 
incorrigible 
delirium 
of 
the 
psychotics 
brooding 
and 
phantastic 
introspection, 
which 
is 
so 
much 
easier 
to 
comprehend 
as 
a 
systematized 
illusion 
with 
the 
object 
of 
assuring 
self-
esteem, 
teaches 
us 
to 
understand 
the 
delirium 
of 
the 
introspection 
of 
the 
neurotic. 


The 
neurotic's 
striving 
for 
security, 
his 
very 
stronghold, 
can 
therefore 
only 
be 
understood 
when 
the 
original, 
contrary 
factor 
of 
his 
uncertainties 
is 
likewise 
taken 
into 
consideration. 
Both 
are 
the 
result 
of 
an 
antithetically 
grouped 
judgment 
which 
has 
come 
to 
depend 
on 
the 
fictitious 
egotistic 
ideal, 
which 
furnishes 
to 
this 
judgement 
biased 
" 
subjective 
" 
values. 
The 
feeling 
of 
" 
security 
" 
and 
its 
opposite 
pole 
of;< 
insecurity 
" 
arranged 
according 
to 
the 
antithesis 
of 
"feeling 
inferiority" 
and 
"egotistic 
ideal" 
are 
like 
these 
latter 
a 
fictitious 
pair 
of 
values, 
a 
psychic 
formation 
of 
which 
Vaihinger 
says 
" 
that 
the 
real 
in 
them 
is 
artificially 
placed 
there, 
that 
only 
when 
taken 
together 
have 
they 
meaning 
and 
value, 
taken 
singly, 
however, 
they 
lead 
through 
their 
isolation 
to 
nonsense, 
contradictions 
and 
illusionary 
problems." 
In 
the 
analysis 
of 
psychoneuroses 
it 
always 
becomes 
obvious 
that 
this 
antithesis 
resolves 
itself 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
only 
real 
" 
antithesis 
" 
of 
" 
man 
woman," 
so 
that 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
uncertainty, 
lowliness, 
effeminacy, 
falls 
on 
one 
side 
of 
the 
table, 
the 
antithesis 
of 
certainty, 
superiority, 
self-
esteem, 
manliness, 
on 
the 
other. 
The 
dynamics 
of 
the 
neurosis 
can 
therefore 
be 
regarded 
(and 
is 
often 
so 
understood 
by 
the 
neurotic 
because 
of 
its 
irradiation 
upon 
his 
psyche) 
as 
if 
the 
patient 
wished 
to 
change 
from 
a 
woman 
to 
a 
man. 
This 
effect 
yields 
in 
its 
most 
highly 
colored 
form 
the 
picture 
of 
that 
which 
I 
have 
called 
the 
" 
masculine 
protest." 


The 
strength 
of 
the 
manly 
element 
in 
the 
idea 
of 
cultural 
perfection 
as 
well 
as 
more 
particularly 
in 
the 
artificial 
guiding 
lines 
of 
neurotics 
as 
we 
find 
it 
in 
the 
wishes 
and 
actions, 
thoughts 
and 
feelings 
of 
our 
patients, 
in 
their 
attitude 
toward 
the 
objective 
world, 
in 
their 
preparations 
for 
life, 
in 
every 
trait 
of 
character, 
in 
every 
physical 
and 
psychical 
gesture, 
which 
gives 
the 
impulse 
to 
the 
upward 
movement 
and 
directs 
the 
line 
of 
life 
upward, 
permits 
us 
to 
divine 
that 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
psychical 
development 
a 
deficiency 
of 
such 



manly 
power 
was 
felt, 
and 
that 
the 
original 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
realized 
by 
the 
constitutionally 
defective 
child 
was 
estimated 
as 
feminine 
in 
conformity 
with 
this 
antithesis. 
No 
matter 
what 
was 
at 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
when 
the 
strong 
neurotic 
stronghold 
is 
introduced 
through 
the 
setting 
up 
of 
the 
masculine 
fiction, 
the 
supposed 
basis 
of 
the 
childish 
uncertainty 
and 
the 
uncertainty 
itself 
fall 
under 
the 
phenomena 
which 
are 
considered 
as 
effeminate 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
neurotic, 
antithetical 
grouping. 
The 
feeling 
of 
insignificance, 
of 
weakness, 
of 
anxiety 
and 
helplessness, 
of 
ill 
health, 
of 
deficiency, 
of 
pain, 
etc., 
produces 
in 
the 
neurotic 
actions 
of 
such 
a 
nature 
that 
he 
seems 
to 
be 
compelled 
to 
set 
up 
a 
defence 
against 
effeminacy, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
to 
be 
obliged 
to 
act 
in 
a 
manly 
and 
forceful 
manner. 
la 
the 
same 
manner 
this 
answer 
follows, 
the 
affect-possibilities 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest 
react 
against 
every 
degradation, 
against 
the 
feeling 
of 
uncertainty, 
of 
being 
injured, 
of 
inferiority, 
and 
the 
neurotic 
individual 
draws 
constantly 
effective 
guiding 
lines 
for 
his 
volition, 
action 
and 
thoughts 
in 
the 
form 
of 
traits 
of 
character 
in 
the 
broad 
chaotic 
field 
of 
his 
soul, 
in 
order 
not 
to 
miss 
the 
way 
to 
the 
heights, 
in 
order 
to 
make 
his 
security 
complete. 
Usually 
the 
traits 
of 
character 
tend 
in 
a 
direct 
line 
of 
the 
masculine 
ideal 
in 
both 
the 
male 
and 
the 
female 
patients, 
but 
the 
neurotic 
circuitous 
ways, 
attacks 
and 
predispositions 
to 
attack 
especially 
following 
the 
decisive 
defeat 
whose 
analysis 
and 
arrangements 
in 
the 
ensemble 
reveals 
the 
same 
tendency 
to 
the 
heightening 
of 
the 
masculine 
ego-consciousness, 
manifest 
themselves 
as 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
above 
given 
expositions, 
even 
though 
from 
an 
outside 
view 
and 
superficially 
considered 
they 
may 
appear 
to 
be 
timidity, 
anxiety, 
effeminacy, 
and 
may 
be 
regarded 
as 
flight 
or 
retreat 
from 
the 
world. 
The 
simple 
question 
concerning 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
far 
fetched 
expedient 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
neurotic 
symptom 
enables 
us 
to 
understand 
that 
in 
these 
latter 
cases 
it 
is 
not 
because 
a 
decision 
has 
been 
reached, 
but 
because 
the 
originally 
constructed 
imaginary 
masculine 
goal 
is 
effective 
now 
as 
it 
was 
before 
and 
that 
a 
cultural 
adaptation, 
peace 
and 
contentment, 
cannot 
be 
maintained, 
because 
the 
goal 
is 
set 
too 
high. 


Through 
certain 
uncertainties 
of 
the 
child 
concerning 
his 
own 
sex-role 
the 
masculine 
element 
in 
the 
guiding 
fiction 
is 
considerably 
reenforced. 
In 
fact 
one 
observes 
that 
children 
retain 
a 
remarkable 
interest 
for 
differences 
of 
sexuality 
in 
a 
hidden 
form. 
The 
similarity 
of 
dress 
in 
children 
in 
the 
first 



years, 
the 
feminine 
features 
in 
small 
boys, 
and 
masculine 
in 
girls 
r 
certain 
threats 
of 
the 
parents 
as 
" 
a 
boy 
will 
change 
himself 
into 
a 
girl 
" 
reproaches 
to 
the 
boy 
that 
he 
is 
like 
a 
girl, 
to 
a 
girl 
that 
she 
is 
like 
a 
boy, 
may 
still 
increase 
this 
uncertainty, 
as 
long 
as 
the 
differences 
in 
the 
genital 
organs 
are 
unknown. 
But 
even 
where 
there 
is 
the 
fullest 
explanation, 
doubt 
may 
awaken 
through 
anomalies 
of 
the 
genital 
organs 
in 
erroneous 
judgments, 
which 
may 
be 
retained 
and 
emerge 
constantly 
in 
later 
life 
in 
the 
antithetical 
picture 
of 
" 
masculine-feminine 
" 
so 
that 
our 
original 
statement 
* 
that 
the 
doubt 
of 
his 
own 
sex-role 
is 
at 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
neurotic 
doubt 
needs 
extension 
only 
in 
one 
direction, 
i.e., 
that 
the 
neurosis 
holds 
fast 
to 
this 
condition 
of 
doubt 
in 
the 
patient 
subsequently 
as 
a 
security 
against 
the 
necessity 
of 
decadency, 
in 
order 
to 
construct 
the 
" 
hesitating 
attitude." 


*" 
Psychic 
Hermaphrodism 
in 
Life 
and 
in 
the 
Neurosis." 
1. 
c. 
and 
the 
later 
publications. 


The 
longer 
the 
uncertainty 
as 
to 
the 
sex-role 
exists, 
the 
more 
urgent 
becomes 
the 
effort 
and 
tentative 
preparation 
to 
attain 
the 
masculine 
role. 
Thus 
originates 
the 
original 
picture 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest 
' 
' 
which 
has 
as 
aim 
to 
force 
the 
one 
in 
whom 
it 
exists 
under 
all 
circumstances 
into 
the 
seemingly 
most 
masculine 
attitude, 
or, 
as 
is 
the 
case 
with 
girls 
and 
boys, 
who 
early 
become 
neurotic, 
to 
prevent 
set-backs 
in 
all 
forms 
by 
neurotic 
expedients, 
simultaneously, 
however, 
to 
build 
up 
directly 
masculine 
traits 
of 
character 
and 
strong 
affect 
predisposition. 


The 
fore-stage 
of 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
sex-role, 
that 
is 
the 
period 
of 
psychic 
hermaphroditism 
of 
the 
child 
exists 
generally. 
Attention 
has 
been 
called 
to 
its 
importance 
by 
Dessoir 
and 
myself. 
That 
this 
stadium 
with 
its 
strong 
endeavors 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
masculine 
guiding 
line 
is 
of 
the 
greatest 
significance 
for 
the 
development 
of 
the 
neurosis 
with 
its 
too 
elevated 
manly 
goal 
and 
its 
expedients 
for 
gaining 
security 
was 
demonstrated 
to 
me 
by 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
psychoneurosis. 
Goethe 
proves 
himself 
to 
be 
a 
good 
observer 
and 
connoisseur 
of 
nature 
when 
he 
says 
in 
Wilhelm 
Meister's 
Theatrical 
Consignment, 
" 
Just 
as 
at 
certain 
periods 
in 
their 
life, 
children 
begin 
to 
pay 
attention 
to 
the 
differences 
in 
the 
sex 
of 
their 
parents, 
and 
their 
glances 
through 
the 
envelopes 
which 
conceal 
these 
secrets 
bring 
forth 
very 
wonderful 
emotions 
in 
their 
nature, 
so* 
it 
was 
with 
Wilhelm 
in 
this 



discovery; 
he 
was 
more 
quiet 
and 
less 
quiet 
than 
before, 
thought 
he 
had 
learned 
something 
and 
just 
from 
this 
perceived 
that 
he 
knew 
nothing." 


In 
fact 
one 
finds 
as 
the 
first 
expression 
of 
this 
inexperience 
and 
its 
depressing 
reaction 
upon 
the 
psyche 
an 
enormous 
amount 
of 
curiosity 
and 
craving 
for 
knowledge 
and 
in 
order 
to 
find 
orientation 
in 
life 
notwithstanding 
this 
the 
child 
comes 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
guiding 
line 
which 
impels 
him 
to 
act 
as 
though 
he 
must 
know 
everything. 
Should 
he 
happen 
to 
find 
out 
the 
superiority 
of 
the 
manly 
principle 
in 
our 
society, 
the 
guiding 
model 
becomes 
masculine, 
especially 
if 
a 
man, 
the 
father 
appears 
to 
him 
to 
be 
the 
person 
with 
knowledge. 


In 
the 
case 
of 
little 
girls 
peculiar 
traits 
of 
character 
which 
become 
especially 
prominent 
in 
the 
neurosis 
develop 
when 
they 
try 
to 
hold 
fast 
to 
the 
masculine 
guiding 
line. 
The 
feeling 
of 
having 
suffered 
an 
injury 
has 
just 
as 
much 
weight 
with 
them 
as 
for 
boys 
who 
consider 
themselves 
female, 
so 
that 
they 
put 
all 
their 
interest 
into 
collecting 
proof 
of 
their 
injury 
and 
building 
up 
their 
aggression 
against 
their 
environment. 


Imaginary 
pictures 
of 
castration, 
of 
man 
changed 
to 
woman, 
woman 
to 
man, 
of 
masculine 
forms 
of 
life, 
emerge 
in 
the 
analysis 
as 
indicators 
of 
the 
neurotic 
psyche, 
point 
to 
the 
craving 
for 
equality 
with 
man 
and 
permit 
the 
masculine 
fiction 
to 
reemerge 
constantly 
in 
the 
later 
changes 
of 
form 
of 
the 
guiding 
line. 
These 
neurotics 
regularly 
assume 
an 
attitude 
toward 
life 
as 
though 
they 
had 
suffered 
an 
injury, 
or 
as 
though 
they 
were 
constantly 
seeking 
with 
the 
greatest 
caution, 
to 
avoid 
a 
loss. 


E. 
H. 
Meyer 
says 
in 
the 
" 
Indo-Germanic 
Myths" 
(I. 
S. 
16), 
" 
According 
to 
the 
Atharva 
Veda 
the 
Gandharvs 
(phallic 
Daemons) 
consume 
the 
testicles 
of 
boys 
and 
thus 
transform 
the 
boys 
into 
girls." 
The 
ideas 
of 
many 
neurotics 
in 
childhood 
seem 
to 
have 
assumed 
this 
and 
similar 
forms 
concerning 
the 
origination 
of 
the 
two 
sexes, 
as 
if 
from 
thoughts 
concerning 
a 
degradation 
which 
has 
been 
suffered 
and 
which 
assumes 
the 
form 
of 
a 
sexual 
transformation 
with 
the 
woman. 
The 
immediate 
psychical 
result 
is 
then 
as 
a 
rule 
more 
acute 
aggression 
against 
the 
parents, 
to 
whom 
is 
ascribed 
the 
blame 
for 
this 
shortcoming. 
Flies, 
Halban, 
Weininger, 
and 
before 
them, 
among 
others, 
Schopenhauer 
and 
Krafft-Ebing, 
founded 
the 
psychic 
Tiermaphroditism 
on 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
hypothetical 
male 
and 
female 
substance 
in 
the 
individual. 
Our 
concept 



supposes 
only 
the 
antithesis 
in 
the 
valuation 
of 
male 
and 
female 
as 
it 
actually 
exists, 
takes 
into 
account 
the 
universality 
of 
the 
antithetical 
figurative 
apperception-scheme 
" 
male-female 
" 
and 
deduces 
from 
the 
pressure 
of 
the 
neurotically 
reenforced 
and 
heightened 
egotistic 
ideal 
the 
masculine 
factor 
which 
is 
so 
easily 
discoverable. 
The 
latter 
conditions 
also 
the 
emphasis 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
of 
the 
individual 
by 
comprehending 
it 
in 
a 
picture 
which 
belongs 
to 
the 
feminine 
role 
in 
order 
to 
react 
against 
it 
with 
the 
character 
traits, 
the 
impulses, 
and 
preparations 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
The 
findings 
published 
by 
me 
have 
been 
taken 
up 
in 
a 
series 
of 
the 
latest 
works 
from 
the 
Freudian 
school. 
A 
further 
pursuance 
of 
the 
matter 
leads 
irrevocably 
to 
a 
realization 
of 
the 
untenableness 
of 
the 
libido-theory, 
to 
a 
doing 
away 
with 
the 
sexual 
etiology 
and 
to 
an 
understanding 
of 
the 
neurotic 
sexual 
conduct 
as 
a 
fiction. 


If 
the 
masculine 
protest 
has 
thus 
become 
clear 
to 
us 
as 
an 
expedient 
of 
the 
psyche 
by 
means 
of 
which 
it 
attains 
full 
security, 
and 
strives 
to 
bring 
itself 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
guiding 
egotistic 
idea, 
it 
still 
remains 
to 
present 
to 
view 
the 
formal 
change 
of 
this 
guiding 
line 
as 
it 
takes 
place 
every 
time 
contradictions 
become 
apparent 
in 
it 
and 
the 
purpose 
of 
neurotic 
efforts 
to 
maintain 
superiority 
is 
jeopardized. 
This 
is 
the 
case 
when 
reality 
threatens 
"the 
egotistic 
ideal 
with 
degradation. 
The 
neurotic 
in 
this 
case 
will 
cling 
more 
tenaciously 
to 
his 
idea 
than 
the 
normal 
person. 
The 
more 
deeply, 
however, 
he 
becomes 
entangled 
in 
the 
reassuring 
neurosis, 
the 
more 
likely 
is 
he, 
being 
assisted 
by 
memories 
and 
warnings, 
to 
anticipate 
an 
injury, 
to 
construct 
new 
neurotic 
circuitous 
ways, 
to 
apply 
further 
neurotic 
expedients 
for 
security 
which 
for 
a 
problem 
under 
consideration 
contain 
neither 
a 
fiat 
nor 
a 
negation, 
or 
more 
likely 
both 
at 
once. 


His 
psychic 
hermaphroditic 
character 
will 
also 
manifest 
itself 
in 
the 
circumstance 
that 
he 
yields, 
becomes 
submissive, 
effeminate, 
while 
his 
efforts 
at 
the 
same 
time 
reveal 
a 
pressure 
towards 
a 
tendency 
to 
dominate, 
toward 
manliness, 
with 
the 
result 
that 
he 
makes 
no 
progress, 
because 
for 
every 
step 
he 
takes 
forward 
he 
takes 
one 
backward, 
and 
sometimes 
even 
expresses 
this 
procedure 
in 
pantomime. 
In 
the 
same 
way 
the 
fear 
of 
blame, 
of 
punishment, 
of 
shame, 
in 
short 
of 
being 
"down" 
may 
alter 
his 
straightforward 
manly 
traits. 
The 
construction 
of 
the 
neurotic 
feelings 
of 
guilt, 
of 
congenital 
criminal 
instincts, 
of 
roughness, 
of 
cruelty, 
and 
egotism 
bear 
fear-inspiring 



signs 
in 
the 
same 
ways 
as 
the 
feelings 
of 
bashfulness, 
cowardice, 
dullness 
and 
laziness 
when 
these 
latter 
are 
brought 
neurotically 
to 
expression. 
The 
bad, 
intractable 
child, 
the 
years 
of 
wild 
oats, 
and 
certain 
forms 
of 
psychoses, 
frequently 
the 
fore-stage 
of 
the 
"developed 
neurosis," 
show 
us 
the 
masculine 
protest 
in 
a 
high, 
rectilinear 
development. 
Their 
performances 
are 
produced 
directly 
by 
the 
surge 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest 
which 
has 
become 
an 
end 
in 
itself 
and 
which 
represents 
wholly 
and 
entirely 
the 
reenforced 
guiding 
fiction. 


Our 
theoretical 
presentation 
of 
the 
neurotic 
psyche 
would 
be 
incomplete, 
if 
it 
did 
riot 
also 
enter 
upon 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
nature 
and 
significance 
of 
dreams. 
I 
can 
in 
this 
.place 
advance 
no 
well 
founded 
theory 
of 
dreams, 
to 
say 
nothing 
of 
a 
complete 
one. 
But 
for 
various 
reasons 
I 
am 
obliged 
to 
communicate 
all 
the 
observations 
and 
findings 
which 
have 
rendered 
possible 
the 
study 
of 
dreams 
in 
the 
practical 
part 
of 
the 
work. 


Freud's 
interpretation 
of 
dreams 
was 
perhaps 
the 
greatest 
step 
in 
advance 
which 
has 
been 
made 
in 
our 
understanding 
of 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
neuroses. 
And 
yet 
I 
cannot 
regard 
it 
as 
the 
final 
step 
in 
our 
knowledge 
of 
dreams. 
In 
the 
course 
of 
an 
observation 
of 
dreams 
extending 
over 
many 
years 
of 
healthy 
and 
unhealthy 
persons 
I 
have 
arrived 
at 
the 
following 
result: 


1. 
The 
dream 
is 
a 
sketch-like 
reflection 
of 
psychic 
attitudes 
and 
indicates 
for 
the 
investigator 
the 
characteristic 
manner 
in 
which 
the 
dreamer 
takes 
his 
attitude 
in 
regard 
to 
a 
certain 
problem. 
It 
coincides, 
therefore, 
with 
the 
form 
of 
the 
fictitious 
guiding 
line, 
yields 
only 
efforts 
of 
premeditation, 
tentative 
preparations 
of 
an 
aggressive 
attitude 
and 
can 
therefore 
be 
utilized 
to 
great 
advantage 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
understanding 
these 
individual 
preparations, 
predispositions, 
and 
the 
guiding 
fiction 
itself. 
2. 
In 
the 
same 
way 
there 
comes 
to 
light 
in 
the 
dream, 
in 
a 
more 
or 
less 
abstract 
manner, 
the 
dreamer's 
attitude 
towards 
the 
world 
about 
him 
as 
well 
as 
his 
traits 
of 
character 
and 
their 
neurotic 
abnormalities. 
(Lichtenberg 
already 
wrote: 
If 
people 
were 
to 
relate 
accurately 
their 
dreams, 
their 
character 
could 
be 
read 
from 
them 
sooner 
than 
from 
the 
face.) 
The 
abstraction 
in 
dream-thought 
is 
necessitated 
by 
the 
craving 
for 
security, 
which 
seeks 
to 
solve 
a 
problem 
by 
simplifying 
it 
and 
by 
referring 
it 
to 
a 
less 
complete 
infantile 
stage. 
This 
it 
accomplishes 
in 
a 
manner 
which 
is 
true 
of 
thinking 
generally, 
except 
that 
it 
is 
more 
profound. 
It 
makes 
use 
too 
of 
memory, 
and 
in 
a 
figurative 
analogical 
manner, 
through 
the 
hallucinatory 



awakening 
of 
memories 
of 
a 
fear-inspiring 
or 
energy-exciting 
sort. 
The 
exclusion 
of 
reality 
by 
sleep 
favors 
the 
abstract 
thinking 
in 
dreams, 
as 
correction 
is 
to 
a 
great 
part 
prevented 
by 
the 
insensibility 
of 
the 
sense 
organs. 
To 
this 
circumstance 
as 
well 
as 
to 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
conscious 
positing 
of 
purpose 
in 
dream 
thought 
is 
due 
the 
incomprehensibility 
of 
the 
contents 
of 
dreams, 
which 
only 
receive 
meaning 
when 
taken 
as 
symbols 
of 
life, 
as 
an 
"as 
if 
" 
for 
which 
the 
interpretation 
has 
to 
supply 
the 
real 
aggression. 


3. 
These 
facts 
which 
still 
remain 
to 
be 
proved 
as 
well 
as 
the 
form 
of 
expression 
of 
the 
dream 
in 
an 
" 
as 
if 
" 
(" 
It 
seemed 
to 
me 
as 
if 
") 
reveal 
to 
us 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
dream 
as 
a 
factor 
in 
which 
those 
tentative 
efforts 
and 
tasks 
become 
manifest 
by 
which 
caution 
seeks 
to 
gain 
the 
mastery 
of 
a 
situation 
in 
the 
future. 
In 
the 
dreams 
of 
neurotic 
persons 
it 
is 
possible, 
therefore, 
to 
observe 
more 
distinctly 
than 
in 
others 
the 
neurotic 
methods 
of 
apperception 
which 
work 
according 
to 
the 
principle 
of 
an 
antithesis, 
the 
emphasized 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
and 
the 
guiding 
egotistic 
idea, 
or 
to 
divine 
them 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
mental 
life 
of 
these 
persons. 
4. 
The 
tendency 
of 
the 
neurotically 
reenforced 
guiding 
idea 
will 
be 
revealed 
regularly 
in 
the 
dreams 
of 
a 
neurotic 
person, 
usually 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
striving 
to 
attain 
a 
position 
" 
above 
" 
or 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
The 
feminine 
or 
" 
under 
" 
base 
of 
operation 
is 
always 
indicated. 
5. 
Repeated 
dreams 
of 
the 
same 
content 
and 
dreams 
of 
childhood 
reveal 
the 
fictitious 
guiding 
line 
most 
distinctly. 
Because 
they 
construct 
themselves 
upon 
a 
completed 
scheme 
or 
one 
that 
is 
in 
a 
condition 
to 
be 
used 
which 
is 
erected 
and 
sustained 
by 
the 
neurotic 
final 
purpose. 
The 
various 
dreams 
of 
a 
night 
indicate 
this 
attempt 
at 
various 
solutions 
and 
are 
a 
characteristic 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
extreme 
uncertainty. 
The 
so-called 
censor 
of 
dreams 
by 
means 
of 
which 
is 
accomplished 
a 
concealment 
or 
disguising 
of 
actual 
facts 
by 
distortion, 
reveals 
itself 
as 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
which 
accomplishes 
the 
formal 
change 
of 
the 
fiction 
in 
the 
neurosis 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
dream, 
and 
seeks 
to 
avoid 
by 
a 
circuitous 
way 
a 
contradiction 
in 
the 
masculine 
guiding 
line. 
Other 
disfigurations 
are 
inherent 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
more 
abstract 
dream 
thinking 
and 
in 
its 
character 
as 
a 
mere 
reflection. 
6. 
The 
symbolisms 
and 
expedients 
of 
analogy 
in 
dreams 
are 
radiations 
containing 
forms 
and 
contents 
of 
dynamic 
affect 
reinforcements, 
their 
word-
pictures, 
so 
to 
speak. 
They 
are 
a 
psychic 
superstructure 
over 
a 
compromise 

between 
a 
psychic 
situation 
and 
a 
biased, 
usually 
falsified, 
sophistically 
applied 
souvenir 
which 
must 
supply 
the 
resonance 
required 
by 
the 
idea. 


The 
fulfillment 
of 
infantile 
wishes 
in 
dreams 
asserted 
by 
Freud 
is 
solved 
by 
me 
by 
regarding 
it 
as 
the 
effect 
of 
premeditation 
to 
attain 
security, 
whereby 
memories 
grouped 
together 
with 
a 
view 
to 
a 
certain 
effect 
are 
taken 
as 
helps 
in 
the 
form 
of 
mementoes, 
a 
psychic 
expedient 
which 
also 
dominates 
all 
logical 
thinking, 
and 
which 
is 
not 
the 
libidinous 
or 
sexual 
wish 
of 
childhood. 


The 
only 
difference 
between 
the 
neurosis 
and 
normality 
with 
its 
dreams 
and 
its 
delusions 
is 
the 
heightened 
tendency 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
reenforced 
fiction, 
to 
choose 
those 
memories 
which 
have 
been 
made 
effective, 
in 
short 
the 
neurotic 
perspective, 
the 
neurotic 
does 
not 
suffer 
from 
reminiscences, 
he 
makes 
them. 


If 
this 
point 
of 
comparison, 
and 
absolutely 
necessary 
one 
for 
orientation 
and 
certainty 
in 
action, 
becomes 
once 
fixed, 
a 
point 
which 
is 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
degree 
with 
which 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
weighs 
upon 
the 
child, 
this 
point 
must 
for 
the 
above 
given 
reasons, 
from 
the 
necessity 
of 
making 
comparisons, 
and 
on 
account 
of 
the 
adjustments 
which 
take 
place 
in 
childhood, 
become 
stable, 
hypostasized 
and 
regarded 
as 
holy, 
as 
divine. 
On 
the 
one 
hand 
are 
the 
real 
conditions 
and 
activities 
of 
the 
subject; 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
are 
the 
compensatory 
result 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
the 
Deity, 
the 
guiding 
idea 
apperceived 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
person 
or 
an 
event. 
This 
latter 
ideal 
point 
operates 
now 
as 
though 
all 
directing 
forces 
were 
contained 
in 
it. 
Thus 
first 
arises 
from 
an 
organic, 
objective 
life 
that 
which 
we 
call 
soul 
life, 
the 
psyche. 


Every 
step 
the 
child 
takes 
directs 
itself 
according 
to 
this 
system 
and 
is 
in 
turn 
directed 
by 
it. 
There 
is 
a 
continuous 
weighing, 
feeling, 
preparation, 
formation 
of 
predispositions 
and 
measuring 
on 
the 
ideal 
which 
brings 
the 
child 
forward 
in 
his 
development. 
He 
measures 
himself 
with 
men 
as 
well 
as 
with 
women, 
whereby 
the 
contrast 
between 
the 
sexes 
furnishes 
a 
guide 
and 
produces 
a 
psychic 
adjustment 
in 
accordance 
with 
a 
contrast 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
in 
a 
hostile, 
evasive 
direction 
in 
the 
masculine 
line. 
In 
the 
neurotically 
disposed 
child, 
the 
compensatory 
craving 
for 
security 
heightened 
by 
the 
feeling 
of 
uncertainty 
is 
responsible, 
through 
the 
over-stimulation 
of 
attention 
in 
this 
direction 
for 
the 
abstract, 
neurotically 
reenforced 
directing 
lines 
to 
the 



high-flown 
goal 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
And 
the 
more 
sharply 
defined 
understanding 
of 
the 
contrast 
of 
the 
sexes 
produces 
earlier 
and 
more 
profoundly 
the 
preparatory 
attitudes 
toward 
the 
opposite 
sex, 
the 
more 
so 
when, 
as 
is 
the 
case 
with 
neurotics, 
the 
exclusively 
masculine 
appraisal 
of 
the 
ideal 
reflects 
upon 
his 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
causing 
it 
to 
appear 
feminine. 


The 
nature 
of 
home 
training 
carries 
with 
it 
the 
result 
that 
in 
his 
first 
attempts 
at 
formulating 
an 
ideal 
of 
personality, 
the 
child 
pictures 
to 
himself 
traits 
belonging 
to 
the 
most 
important 
member 
of 
the 
family, 
usually 
the 
father. 
Neurotically 
disposed 
children 
who 
in 
contrasting 
themselves 
with 
the 
father 
experience 
an 
accentuation 
of 
their 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
immediately 
hit 
upon 
preparatory 
expedients 
and 
construct 
devices 
for 
combat 
as 
though 
they 
were 
obliged 
to 
demonstrate 
their 
superiority 
to 
the 
father. 
In 
these 
preparatory 
efforts 
is 
contained 
also 
the 
attitude 
to 
the 
opposite 
sex, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
the 
intellect 
of 
the 
child 
does 
not 
make 
a 
mistake 
in 
regard 
to 
his 
own 
sexual 
role, 
and 
many 
of 
his 
predispositions 
which 
are 
to 
come 
into 
effectiveness 
later 
in 
life 
are 
tentatively 
practiced 
in 
a 
playful 
manner 
upon 
members 
of 
the 
family 
of 
the 
opposite 
sex, 
in 
the 
waking 
state 
or 
in 
hallucinations, 
or 
in 
his 
dreams. 


That 
along 
with 
this 
the 
mother 
serves 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
as 
a 
model 
for 
the 
boy 
has 
long 
been 
known 
and 
has 
been 
mentioned 
by 
Nietzsche. 
The 
boundary 
itself 
which 
the 
child 
sets 
for 
himself 
is 
also 
a 
matter 
of 
experiment 
for 
him. 
His 
wishes 
are, 
if 
he 
be 
neurotically 
disposed, 
boundless. 
Discontented 
because 
of 
the 
too 
great 
distance 
to 
his 
egotistic 
ideal, 
he 
even 
goes 
so 
far 
as 
to 
entertain 
sexual 
wishes 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
mother, 
a 
proof 
of 
how 
boundless 
is 
the 
"will 
to 
power." 
A 
fixation 
of 
a 
sexual 
relation, 
however, 
must 
have 
other 
grounds 
than 
chance 
wishes 
in 
the 
field 
of 
boundless 
aspirations. 
The 
desire 
of 
the 
boy 
extends 
to 
other 
female 
persons 
with 
whom 
he 
is 
brought 
into 
contact. 
The 
picture 
if 
then 
again 
similar 
to 
that 
of 
possession 
"to 
wish 
to 
possess 
the 
mother" 
becomes 
a 
sign 
of 
his 
discontent, 
a 
symbol 
of 
his 
boundless 
aspirations, 
of 
his 
obstinacy 
and 
his 
fear 
of 
other 
women. 
Now 
in 
later 
life 
a 
"fixation 
" 
on 
the 
mother 
from 
similar 
constellations 
may 
result, 
not 
however, 
because 
the 
wish 
was 
heretofore 
libidinous. 
For 
it 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
indifference 
of 
what 
nature 
the 
real 
relation 
to 
the 
mother 
was 
the 
psyche 
of 
the 
neurotic 
will 
always 
utilize 
it 
in 
some 
way 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
furnishing 
him 
security. 



The 
motive 
of 
the 
discontent 
interests 
us 
here 
above 
all. 
It 
originates 
from 
the 
feeling 
of 
having 
suffered 
an 
injury 
and 
it 
is 
obvious 
that 
the 
child 
waits 
fulfillment 
of 
every 
aspiration 
in 
his 
"growing 
up." 
According 
to 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
"as 
if 
" 
he 
may 
expect 
his 
cure 
from 
the 
development 
of 
his 
hair, 
his 
teeth, 
his 
genital 
organs. 
His 
experience 
with 
his 
teeth 
serves 
to 
give 
him 
the 
impression 
that 
a 
thing 
may 
grow 
again. 
The 
tooth-motive 
plays 
a 
frequent 
role 
in 
the 
dreams 
and 
phantasies 
with 
girls 
in 
order 
to 
enable 
them 
to 
cling 
to 
their 
hope 
of 
becoming 
a 
man, 
with 
boys 
to 
give 
hope 
to 
their 
longing 
for 
a 
more 
complete 
manhood. 
If 
a 
tooth 
is 
pulled, 
a 
milk 
tooth, 
a 
new, 
stronger 
one 
forms. 
The 
pulling 
out 
of 
teeth, 
therefore, 
symbolizes 
in 
the 
dream 
the 
wish 
to 
become 
a 
man, 


Neurotic 
men 
like 
women 
are 
full 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
having 
suffered 
an 
injury 
and 
their 
whole 
life 
is 
spent 
in 
the 
effort 
at 
enlarging 
their 
spheres 
of 
influence. 
In 
order 
to 
attain 
this, 
indeed, 
in 
order 
even 
to 
assume 
their 
attitude 
toward 
this 
effort, 
they 
are 
obliged 
to 
keep 
up 
constantly 
their 
discontent, 
so 
that 
they 
will 
find 
nourishment 
for 
it 
and 
proof 
of 
their 
neglect 
in 
every 
situation 
by 
examining 
it, 
rearranging 
it 
or 
arbitrarily 
changing 
it, 
but 
always 
keeping 
in 
mind 
the 
fictitious 
guiding 
goal. 
With 
great 
regularity, 
I 
found 
in 
them 
the 
apperception 
according 
to 
the 
antithetical 
scheme 
"male-female" 
by 
means 
of 
which 
they 
sought 
and 
classified 
all 
their 
experiences. 
This 
scheme 
according 
to 
which 
they 
wish 
to 
arrange 
the 
cosmic 
picture 
is 
usually 
overlayed 
by 
an 
antithetical 
picture 
of 
the 
large 
and 
small 
masculine 
genitalia. 
It 
is 
a 
frequent 
and 
characteristic 
discovery 
that 
a 
finer 
sensibility 
develops 
at 
points 
of 
the 
body 
which 
by 
nature 
are 
inferior, 
whose 
excitability 
sometimes 
takes 
the 
character 
of 
pleasurable 
sensations. 
I 
have 
described 
this 
phenomenon 
in 
the 
" 
Studie 
uber 
Organmin 
derwertigheit 
" 
(1907, 
Wien 
und 
Berlin) 
and 
refer 
them 
to 
the 
compensatory 
adjustment 
which 
has 
come 
into 
play 
during 
the 
individual's 
experience 
in 
his 
struggle 
for 
existence 
where 
the 
organs 
or 
parts 
of 
organs 
in 
question 
were 
menaced. 
These 
compensatory, 
now 
higher 
valued 
portions 
of 
an 
inferior 
organ 
inferior 
after 
they 
had 
suffered 
an 
injury 
in 
their 
ascendancy 
are 
really 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
protective 
adjustments, 
although 
frequently 
they 
do 
not 
prove 
of 
worth. 
Because, 
however, 
their 
technique 
has 
become 
different 
and 
no 
longer 
keeps 
pace 
with 
the 
nearly 
normal 
organ, 
the 
psychic 
phenomena 
connected 
with 
these 
organs 
are 
striking 
and 
deviate 
from 
normality. 
This 
is 
the 
same 
albeit 



more 
minute 
variation 
based 
upon 
somatic 
inferiority 
of 
which 
I 
have 
spoken 
in 
the 
biology, 
i.e.', 
explanation 
of 
variation, 
refinement 
and 
decline 
of 
an 
organ.* 


*Thus 
the 
"value 
of 
an 
organ" 
likewise 
becomes 
a 
symbol 
in 
life's 
current 
in 
which 
are 
reflected 
the 
past, 
present, 
future 
as 
well 
as 
the 
fictive 
goal 
in 
like 
manner 
as 
is 
the 
case 
with 
the 
individual's 
make-up 
or 
with 
the 
neurotic 
symptoms. 
The 
idea 
of 
the 
" 
symbolic 
in 
a 
person's 
appearance 
" 
is 
not 
a 
new 
one. 
It 
has 
been 
expressed 
by 
Port 
a, 
Gall 
and 
Carus. 


In 
this 
way, 
for 
instance, 
the 
sense 
of 
taste 
has 
evolved 
as 
a 
security-
serving 
apparatus, 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
the 
nutritive 
organ, 
but 
along 
with 
this 
also 
the 
pleasure 
sense 
apparatus 
which 
must 
now 
guarantee 
the 
continuance 
of 
nutrition 
as 
well 
as 
the 
proper 
choice 
of 
food. 


The 
variation 
from 
the 
type 
is 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
" 
compensation 
tendency 
" 
which 
is 
already 
introduced 
in 
the 
germ 
plasm. 


The 
environment 
(in 
a 
broader 
sense 
the 
milieu) 
dominates 
the 
"germ 
plasm 
" 
and 
in 
this 
manner 
is 
explained 
the 
prompt 
uniformity 
of 
reaction, 
viz., 
"inferiority 
plus 
compensatory 
security," 
through 
a 
change 
in 
the 
conditions 
of 
life 
in 
the 
broadest 
sense, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
all 
particular 
members 
of 
a 
single 
species 
vary 
in 
the 
same 
way 
when 
the 
same 
change 
in 
their 
mode 
of 
life 
takes 
place. 
In 
regard 
to 
human 
society 
one 
must 
keep 
constantly 
in 
mind, 
more 
so 
than 
in 
the 
animal 
and 
vegetable 
kingdoms 
that 
the 
demands 
on 
the 
single 
individual 
vary 
to 
a 
considerable 
degree 
one 
from 
the 
other, 
both 
quantitatively 
and 
qualitatively, 
so 
that 
their 
somatic 
inferiorities 
and 
the 
compensatory 
adjustments 
resulting 
therefrom 
differ 
very 
widely. 
And 
their 
variations 
would 
be 
still 
more 
striking 
were 
it 
not 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
human 
psyche 
has 
thrust 
itself 
into 
the 
circle 
of 
correlations 
and 
compensations 
with 
such 
preponderance 
as 
the 
principal 
organ 
of 
adjustive 
security.* 


* 
The 
psychic 
adjustment 
of 
man 
with 
its 
preparations 
and 
peculiar 
characteristics 
simulates 
so 
very 
closely 
the 
adjustive 
variations 
in 
the 
animal 
sphere, 
that 
children, 
neurotics, 
poets 
and 
even 
speech 
itself 
utilize 
this 
analogy 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
elucidating 
by 
way 
of 
comparison 
a 
psychic 
gesture, 
a 
trait 
of 
character, 
a 
type 
of 
preparedness 
by 
means 
of 
a 
representation 
of 
an 
animal, 
as 
is 
the 
case 
for 
instance 
in 
the 
designing 
of 
escutcheons, 
in 
poetic 
similes, 
in 
fables 
and 
parable. 
See 
also 
Erckmafrm's 
Chatrain, 
the 
famous 
Dr. 
Malthieu, 
Goethe's 
Reinecke 
Fox, 
painting 
and 
caricatures. 
Now 
the 
standard 
tendencies 
to 
security 
are 
no 
longer 
variations 
in 
the 



organs 
themselves, 
but 
psychic 
peculiarities. 
There 
always 
continues 
to 
exist 
a 
connection 
which 
can 
be 
sufficiently 
proved, 
and 
we 
are 
able 
to 
infer 
from 
somatic 
variations 
stigmata 
and 
signs 
of 
degeneration 
of 
the 
same, 
that 
there 
has 
taken 
place 
an 
increased 
compensatory 
adjustment 
of 
the 
brain 
and 
more 
accentuated 
tendencies 
to 
obtain 
security. 
The 
nature 
and 
tendency 
of 
all 
psychic 
processes 
are 
full 
of 
the 
efforts 
of 
precaution 
and 
defensive 
preparations 
for 
gaining 
superiority 
so 
that 
one 
cannot 
avoid 
the 
conclusion 
that 
what 
we 
term 
soul, 
spirit, 
reason 
and 
understanding 
are 
for 
us 
abstractions 
of 
those 
effective 
guiding 
lines, 
to 
which 
human 
beings 
reach 
out 
beyond 
the 
sphere 
of 
bodily 
sensations, 
striving 
to 
overstep 
their 
limitations 
in 
order 
to 
gain 
the 
mastery 
of 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
world 
and 
to 
secure 
themselves 
against 
threatened 
dangers. 
The 
imperfection 
of 
the 
independently 
acting 
organ 
is 
thus 
magically 
elevated 
to 
that 
security 
which 
is 
furnished 
by 
knowledge, 
understanding 
and 
foresight. 


In 
the 
animal 
kingdom 
the 
function 
performed 
in 
men 
by 
the 
understanding; 
is 
performed 
by 
a 
finely 
adjusted 
technical 
apparatus. 
The 
fine 
scent 
of 
the 
dog 
becomes 
superfluous 
or 
is 
brought 
under 
man's 
service, 
the 
highly 
specialized 
sense 
of 
taste, 
which 
teaches 
cattle 
to 
avoid 
poisonous 
plants, 
is 
supplied 
in 
man 
by 
the 
understanding 
eye. 


But 
it 
is 
the 
same 
tendency 
which 
continues 
through 
eternity 
the 
struggle 
of 
the 
ancestors 
to 
facilitate 
the 
preservation 
of 
life 
by 
more 
finely 
graded, 
sharply 
differentiated 
organs, 
as 
well 
as 
by 
more 
refined 
expedients 
of 
the 
psyche. 


And 
thus 
it 
is 
permitted 
to 
us, 
to 
regard 
this 
sort 
of 
more 
sensitive 
peripheral 
apparatus, 
its 
special 
physiognomy 
and 
mimic 
as 
a 
sign 
of 
an 
imperfection 
of 
some 
organ, 
as 
a 
trace 
which 
betrays 
a 
transmitted 
somatic 
defect. 
This 
is 
also 
true 
of 
the 
extraordinary 
development 
of 
the 
organs 
of 
taste 
in 
man, 
for 
the 
greater 
sensibility 
to 
stimuli 
of 
the 
lips 
and 
mucous 
membrane 
of 
the 
mouth, 
with 
which 
there 
is 
usually 
associated 
a 
more 
exacting 
state 
of 
the 
gums, 
alimentary 
canal 
and 
stomach. 


Physiognomically 
the 
picture 
of 
the 
more 
inferior 
mouth 
is 
represented 
in 
the 
form 
of 
more 
mobile, 
thicker 
or 
thinner 
lips, 
usually 
associated 
with 
slight 
deformities 
of 
the 
lips, 
of 
the 
tongue 
(lingua 
scrotallis 
Schmidt), 
of 
the 
gums, 
with 
which 
are 
often 
associated 
signs 
of 
degeneration 
of 
these 
parts, 
enlarged 
tonsils 
or 
of 
the 
whole 
status 
lymphaticus. 
At 
times, 
it 
is 
true, 
all 



higher 
development 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
a 
tendency 
to 
compensation 
is 
wanting 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
an 
inferiority, 
even 
the 
hyperasthesia. 
Reflex 
anomalies 
are 
quite 
common, 
sometimes 
exaggeration, 
sometimes 
diminution 
of 
the 
pharyngeal 
reflex; 
along 
with 
defects 
of 
childhood, 
one 
observes 
a 
greater 
occupation 
with 
the 
mouth, 
as 
touching 
of 
the 
mouth, 
thumb, 
sucking, 
tendencies 
to 
put 
everything 
into 
the 
mouth, 
vomiting. 
Along 
with 
this, 
good 
digestion 
is 
usually 
present 
in 
so 
far 
as 
this 
is 
not 
prevented 
by 
other 
coexisting 
somatic 
defects. 


But 
the 
evil, 
the 
deprivation 
and 
the 
pain 
which 
from 
the 
cradle 
on 
are 
the 
fate 
of 
the 
child 
with 
an 
inferior 
alimentary 
tract, 
awake 
in 
him 
at 
the 
same 
time 
a 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
of 
having 
suffered 
an 
injury 
and 
of 
uncertainty 
and 
force 
the 
constitutionally 
predisposed 
child 
to 
a 
resort 
to 
fictive 
expedients. 
The 
over-strongly 
developed, 
precocious, 
egotistic 
ideal 
includes 
within 
itself 
also 
fictitious 
goals 
of 
overgratifications 
which 
reality 
can 
never 
satisfy. 
The 
attention 
of 
such 
children 
is 
directed 
after 
the 
manner 
of 
a 
compulsory 
idea 
to 
all 
problems 
of 
nutrition 
and 
their 
sublimation 
(Nietzsche). 
The 
deprivation 
of 
a 
delicacy 
releases 
in 
them 
entirely 
different 
emotions 
and 
actions 
than 
we 
would 
expect. 
Their 
sense 
turns 
to 
the 
kitchen, 
their 
play 
and 
the 
infantile 
choice 
of 
vocation 
turn 
on 
the 
phantasy 
of 
procuring 
nutrition, 
to 
be 
cook 
or 
candy-maker. 
The 
importance 
of 
money 
as 
a 
means 
to 
power 
dawns 
upon 
them 
earlier 
and 
more 
forcibly, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
sense 
of 
greed 
and 
economy. 
Stereotypies 
and 
pedantries 
in 
eating 
are 
often 
revealed, 
courses 
of 
action 
according 
to 
a 
principle 
such 
as 
the 
best 
is 
to 
be 
put 
into 
the 
mouth 
first 
or 
last, 
the 
impatient 
preferring 
the 
first 
practice, 
the 
cautious 
and 
avaricious 
the 
latter. 
Idiosyncrasies 
against 
certain 
foods, 
refusal 
of 
food, 
hasty 
swallowing, 
are 
often 
adhered 
to 
as 
traits 
of 
obstinacy 
and 
show 
the 
application 
of 
the 
problem 
of 
nutrition 
as 
an 
aggression 
against 
the 
parents. 
Aside 
from 
the 
organic 
diseases 
of 
later 
life 
which 
go 
with 
an 
inferior 
alimentary 
apparatus, 
and 
among 
which 
I 
have 
emphasized 
ulcer 
of 
the 
stomach, 
appendicitis, 
cancer, 
diabetes, 
liver 
and 
gall 
bladder 
disease, 
there 
is 
manifested 
in 
the 
neurosis 
a 
stronger 
participation 
and 
frequent 
employment 
of 
functional 
disturbances 
of 
the 
digestive 
tract. 
Its 
intimate 
relation 
to 
the 
psyche 
is 
reflected 
in 
many 
neurotic 
and 
psychotic 
symptoms. 
I 
believe 
I 
am 
on 
the 
track 
of 
a 
special 
expedient 
of 
this 
sort, 
without 
being 
able 
to 
present 
conclusive 
facts. 
A 
number 
of 
neurotic 
symptoms, 
such 
as 



erythrophobia, 
neurotic 
obstipation 
and 
colic, 
asthma, 
probably 
also 
vertigo, 
vomiting, 
headache, 
and 
migraine 
stand 
in 
some 
sort 
of 
relation, 
which 
is 
as 
yet 
not 
entirely 
clear 
to 
me, 
with 
a 
voluntary 
but 
unconsciously 
cooperating 
activity 
of 
anus-contraction 
(" 
cramp 
" 
of 
the 
other 
authors) 
(spasms 
of 
sigmoid 
flexure, 
Holzknecht, 
Singer) 
and 
that 
of 
abdominal 
pressure, 
symbolic 
acts 
which 
are 
accomplished 
through 
the 
domination 
of 
the 
reenforced 
fiction. 
Acquisitiveness 
and 
greed 
for 
gold 
and 
power 
I 
found 
strikingly 
in 
the 
foreground 
and 
as 
essential 
factors 
in 
the 
egotistic 
ideal 
of 
these 
individuals.

SOMATIC 
JARGON 
(ORGAN-JARGON) 


I 
wish 
to 
speak 
first 
of 
those 
traits 
of 
character 
which 
may 
be 
demonstrated 
with 
a 
certain 
regularity 
in 
all 
neurotics, 
and 
which 
reach 
expression 
in 
the 
patient's 
striving 
with 
great 
eagerness, 
directly 
or 
circuitously, 
consciously 
or 
unconsciously, 
by 
means 
of 
purposive 
thinking 
and 
acting, 
or 
through 
an 
especial 
arrangement 
of 
symptoms, 
towards 
greater 
possession, 
towards 
a 
heightening 
of 
his 
power 
and 
influence, 
towards 
a 
degradation 
and 
belittling 
of 
others. 
All 
these 
forms 
of 
self-interest 
are 
most 
often 
found 
to 
coexist, 
and 
it 
is 
only 
after 
a 
better 
insight 
that 
one 
recognizes 
the 
mighty 
preponderance 
of 
those 
evasions 
by 
means 
of 
which 
the 
patient 
deceives 
himself 
and 
his 
environment. 
He 
even 
deceives 
also 
science. 


While 
playing, 
for 
instance, 
the 
role 
of 
unselfishness, 
one 
finds 
again 
and 
again 
in 
his 
attacks, 
in 
his 
neurosis, 
moreover 
in 
the 
end 
result 
gained 
by 
means 
of 
the 
latter, 
that 
exaggerated 
eagerness 
of 
which 
we 
have 
spoken 
in 
the 
beginning: 
He 
thus 
arouses 
the 
impression 
of 
a 
double-ego, 
of 
one 
suffering 
from 
a 
splitting 
of 
consciousness, 
and 
whereas 
a 
fictitious 
goal 
permits 
him 
to 
observe 
secretly 
more 
rigidly 
than 
does 
the 
normal 
person 
the 
scheme 
of 
avarice, 
envy, 
desire 
for 
mastery, 
malice, 
disputatiousness, 
and 
desire 
to 
please 
(coquetry), 
he 
is 
compelled 
in 
the 
open 
(perhaps 
also 
on 
account 
of 
his 
desire 
to 
please) 
to 
play 
the 
role 
of 
the 
benefactor 
and 
patron, 
of 
the 
pacifier 
and 
unselfish 
saint. 
Not 
that 
this 
play 
is 
usually 
without 
disastrous 
results, 
somewhat 
like 
Gregor 
Werles' 
truth 
fanaticism 
in 
Ibsen's 
" 
Wild 
Duck." 
One 
cannot 
estimate 
strongly 
enough 
the 
neurotic's 
mania 
to 
desire 
possession 
of 
everything, 
his 
eagerness 
to 
wish 
to 
be 
the 
first 
one 
cannot 
be 
over-stated 
even 
though 
the 
obvious 
traits 
of 
character 
furnish 
the 
most 
contradictory 
picture. 
What 
really 
drives 
the 
patient 
onward 
is 
the 



overweening 
desire 
for 
absolute 
power; 
and 
inasmuch 
as 
his 
ego-
consciousness 
takes 
offence 
at 
many 
of 
his 
means 
inasmuch 
as 
the 
power 
of 
others 
may 
prevent 
his 
triumph, 
he 
conceals 
the 
hindering 
traits 
of 
character 
from 
himself 
and 
others, 
and 
having 
full 
insight 
into 
his 
hostile 
impulses 
and 
their 
unpopularity, 
he 
allows 
himself 
to 
be 
guided 
in 
the 
open 
in 
his 
conscious 
activities 
by 
the 
ideal 
of 
virtue. 
Notwithstanding 
this, 
however, 
his 
heightened 
aggressive 
tendency 
betrays 
itself 
namely 
in 
the 
dreams 
in 
uncontrolled 
acts, 
in 
his 
attitude, 
mimicry 
and 
gesture 
and 
in 
that 
psychic 
being 
(" 
Geschehen 
") 
the 
expression 
for 
which 
is 
the 
neurosis. 


Concerning 
the 
question 
of 
transmissibility 
of 
such 
characteristics, 
yes, 
also 
their 
antagonistic 
arrangement, 
there 
as 
a 
rule 
develops 
that 
they 
have 
been 
acquired 
as 
secondary 
guiding 
principles 
after 
the 
pattern 
of 
the 
father, 
the 
mother, 
or 
representative 
persons 
and 
are 
in 
nowise 
inherited. 
The 
neurotic 
psyche 
finds 
it 
in 
its 
own 
or 
in 
some 
representative 
material, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
which 
the 
" 
double 
play 
" 
the 
cleft 
consciousness 
of 
society 
is 
utilized 
in 
many 
cases. 
It 
is 
then, 
however, 
the 
device 
of 
the 
neurosis, 
to 
conceal 
and 
change 
those 
hostile 
aggressive 
traits 
which 
are 
frequently 
unsuitable 
for 
the 
fictitious 
purpose 
of 
obtaining 
a 
heightening 
of 
the 
ego-
consciousness 
and 
to 
obtain 
the 
latter 
goal 
through 
a 
more 
intensive 
utilization 
of 
artifices 
often 
by 
means 
of 
contrasting 
characteristics 
and 
neurotic 
symptoms. 
One 
readily 
becomes 
convinced 
that 
the 
generosity 
of 
such 
patients 
obeys 
the 
same 
goal 
of 
the 
" 
will 
to 
power 
" 
which 
the 
patient 
strives 
to 
approach 
also 
through 
the 
heightening 
of 
his 
aggressive 
tendency, 
his 
avarice 
and 
thriftiness. 


One 
of 
my 
patients 
who 
came 
under 
my 
observation 
on 
account 
of 
stammering 
and 
depressive 
states, 
permitted 
to 
appear 
in 
his 
environment 
a 
detection 
only 
of 
his 
generosity. 
One 
day 
he 
made 
a 
voluntary 
bequest 
to 
a 
certain 
institute, 
and 
told 
'me 
this 
story 
with 
an 
apparently 
directly 
associated 
statement 
that 
he 
felt 
unusually 
depressed 
that 
day. 
Along 
with 
this 
his 
stammering 
likewise 
became 
more 
pronounced. 
The 
exaggerated 
state 
of 
his 
neurosis 
showed 
itself 
to 
be 
a 
result 
of 
his 
generosity 
as 
result 
of 
which 
he 
feels 
himself 
degraded 
and 
one 
is 
justified 
in 
expecting 
a 
revelation 
of 
the 
real 
working 
of 
this 
individual 
in 
further 
acts, 
thoughts 
and 
dreams 
as 
running 
with 
the 
developing 
neurotic 
symptoms 
not 
because 
he 
has 
repressed 
his 
avariciousness 
or 
a 
corresponding 
sexual 
impulse 
but 
because 
he 
has 
deviated 



too 
far 
from 
his 
goal 
namely, 
to 
increase 
his 
possessions. 
He 
must 
therefore 
do 
something 
which 
will 
bring 
him 
back 
to 
it. 
He 
tells 
me 
further, 
" 
It 
was 
already 
far 
after 
the 
dinner 
hour. 
I 
felt 
very 
hungry, 
and 
besides 
a 
friend 
awaited 
me 
in 
a 
restaurant 
where 
we 
were 
to 
dine 
together. 
I 
had 
to 
walk 
therefore 
the 
(long) 
distance 
to 
that 
place. 
My 
friend 
still 
waited. 
After 
dinner 
I 
felt 
somewhat 
better." 
This 
means 
that 
he 
began 
at 
once 
to 
save 
again 
and 
made 
the 
journey 
on 
foot, 
notwithstanding 
hunger, 
depression 
and 
rendezvous. 
Incidentally, 
he 
was 
able 
to 
let 
the 
friend 
wait, 
which 
is 
with 
many 
neurotics 
the 
concealed 
mode 
of 
asserting 
their 
desire 
for 
dominancy. 


The 
very 
first 
manifestation, 
actions 
and 
communications 
of 
the 
patient 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
physician, 
frequently 
contain 
the 
most 
important 
of 
the 
disease 
mechanism 
and 
character 
development. 
This 
is 
so 
because 
the 
patient 
is 
as 
yet 
not 
in 
possession 
of 
cautiousness 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
physician. 
As 
the 
above 
quoted 
patient 
introduced 
himself 
to 
me, 
he 
told 
me 
casually, 
that 
his 
father 
was 
not 
well 
to 
do, 
and 
that 
he 
was 
unable 
to 
make 
great 
sacrifices 
for 
the 
treatment. 
After 
a 
certain 
time, 
there 
came 
of 
necessity 
to 
light 
that 
he 
deceived 
me 
in 
this 
respect 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
a 
smaller 
charge. 
He 
showed 
himself 
to 
be 
avaricious 
also 
in 
many 
other 
respects, 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
he 
endeavored 
to 
deceive 
both 
himself 
and 
others 
in 
this 
respect. 
Both 
of 
these 
traits 
were 
also 
possessed 
by 
the 
father, 
and 
our 
patient 
was 
taught 
stinginess 
by 
the 
latter 
with 
special 
stress. 
He 
was 
often 
told 
" 
money 
is 
might, 
for 
money 
everything 
can 
be 
had." 
Thus 
it 
could 
not 
be 
avoided 
that 
our 
patient, 
who 
was 
already 
in 
childhood 
very 
ambitious 
and 
tyrannical, 
having 
later 
fallen 
into 
an 
uncertain 
situation 
and 
believing 
that 
he 
could 
not 
reach 
the 
paternal 
standard, 
through 
direct 
means, 
took 
refuge 
under 
the 
pressure 
of 
his 
ambitiousness, 
in 
the 
device 
to 
convince 
the 
father 
of 
his 
utter 
helplessness 
and 
of 
the 
other 
failures 
of 
his 
educational 
plans, 
by 
retaining 
this 
childhood 
defect, 
stammering. 
Through 
his 
stammering, 
he 
spoiled 
his 
father's 
play 
because 
he 
was 
not 
able 
to 
be 
the 
first 
one, 
because 
he 
was 
not 
able 
to 
surpass 
the 
latter. 


Our 
culture, 
however, 
agrees 
with 
those 
children 
who 
see 
in 
the 
amassing 
of 
fortune 
the 
road 
to 
power. 
Similarly 
led 
on, 
this 
"will 
to 
power" 
assumed 
the 
external 
form 
of 
stinginess 
and 
avarice 
in 
so 
far 
as 
he 
further 
developed 
these 
tendencies. 
It 
was 
only 
the 
contradiction 
between 
a 
vulgar 
avariciousness 
and 
the 
ego-ideal 
which 
forced 
him 
to 
a 
concealment 
of 
the 



impulse 
to 
avarice 
by 
means 
of 
which 
he 
wished 
to 
dominate 
his 
father, 
and 
forced 
him 
to 
the 
substitution 
of 
the 
stammering. 
In 
the 
further 
course 
of 
the 
analysis 
the 
origin 
of 
his 
desire 
for 
possession 
became 
evident. 
He 
suffered 
practically 
constantly 
in 
his 
infancy 
from 
stomach 
and 
intestinal 
disorders, 
which 
were 
the 
expression 
of 
a 
hereditary 
inferiority 
of 
the 
gastro-intestinal 
tract. 
In 
the 
family, 
stomach 
and 
intestinal 
disorders 
played 
an 
important 
role. 
The 
patient 
recalled 
very 
distinctly 
how 
he 
frequently 
had 
to 
deny 
himself 
appetizing 
food 
in 
spite 
of 
hunger 
and 
desire, 
whereas 
his 
parents 
and 
brothers 
and 
sisters 
consumed 
them 
with 
pleasure. 
Whenever 
he 
could 
he 
gathered 
foods, 
bonbons 
and 
fruits 
to 
be 
feasted 
upon 
later. 
In 
this 
tendency 
to 
gather, 
we 
already 
see 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
developing 
craving 
for 
security, 
which 
is 
constantly 
endeavoring 
to 
adjust 
in 
some 
way 
or 
other 
the 
feeling 
of 
degradation. 


How 
far, 
however, 
this 
may 
reach 
may 
be 
shown 
by 
a 
constructed 
example 
which 
I 
am 
able 
to 
verify 
with 
analogies 
from 
our 
case. 
The 
eagerness 
for 
power, 
and 
through 
it 
for 
possession, 
may 
be 
stirred 
up 
by 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
to 
such 
a 
point 
that 
one 
finds 
it 
at 
phases 
of 
the 
psychic 
development 
when 
one 
would 
least 
expect 
it. 


A 
small 
patient 
of 
this 
sort 
will 
at 
first, 
it 
is 
true, 
only 
desire 
to 
have 
the 
apple 
which 
is 
forbidden 
him, 
in 
seeing 
his 
father 
and 
brother 
eating 
the 
same. 
Envy 
will 
begin 
to 
stir 
itself, 
and 
after 
a 
brief 
period 
such 
a 
child 
may 
have 
reached 
the 
stage 
in 
his 
deliberateness 
and 
contemplation 
when 
out 
of 
the 
striving 
for 
equality 
he 
will 
attempt 
to 
prevent 
others 
from 
having 
anything 
before 
he 
has 
it. 
It 
will 
soon 
have 
reached 
so 
far 
in 
the 
elaboration 
of 
this 
albeit 
only 
slightly 
important 
idea, 
as 
to 
have 
at 
his 
disposal 
all 
sorts 
of 
preparations 
and 
facilities, 
it 
will, 
especially 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
an 
originally 
inferior 
muscular 
system, 
train 
itself 
for 
the 
whole 
year 
by 
climbing 
and 
jumping 
in 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
climb 
a 
tree 
as 
a 
master 
in 
the 
fall. 
The 
human 
psyche 
is 
not 
able 
to 
account 
always 
for 
fictitious 
goals, 
and 
thus 
the 
child 
may 
apparently 
free 
himself 
from 
his 
goal, 
employ 
his 
dexterity 
in 
sports 
and 
gymnastics 
in 
the 
service 
of 
other 
tendencies, 
which 
serve 
in 
a 
different 
manner 
his 
ego-consciousness 
somewhat 
like 
our 
modern 
States 
conduct 
our 
war 
preparations 
without 
even 
knowing 
the 
future 
enemy. 


The 
father 
of 
our 
patient 
may 
have 
easily 
been 
taken 
by 
the 
boy 
as 
an 
incidental 
example 
because 
he 
excelled 
his 
environment 
in 
greatness, 
power, 



wealth 
and 
social 
standing. 
If 
the 
boy 
is 
to 
emerge 
out 
of 
his 
insecurity 
into 
which 
he 
has 
been 
plunged 
by 
his 
constitutional 
inferiority 
he 
must 
arrange 
his 
preparations 
for 
life 
in 
accordance 
with 
a 
set 
point 
of 
view 
as 
after 
a 
plan 
(blue 
print). 
A 
marked 
exhibition 
of 
the 
guiding 
principle 
toward 
the 
paternal 
ideal 
(Vaterideal) 
is 
in 
itself 
quite 
a 
neurotic 
trait, 
because 
in 
it 
we 
may 
comprehend 
the 
entire 
misery 
of 
the 
child 
who 
endeavors 
to 
emerge 
from 
his 
insecurity. 
The 
craving 
for 
security 
(Sicherungstendenz) 
of 
the 
neurosis 
leads 
the 
patient 
in 
this 
way 
out 
of 
the 
sphere 
of 
his 
own 
power 
and 
forces 
him 
into 
a 
path 
which 
leads 
away 
from 
reality, 
first 
because 
he 
takes 
for 
his 
object 
his 
fiction 
to 
be 
equal 
to 
his 
father 
or 
even 
to 
excel 
him 
and 
is 
therefore 
forced 
to 
formulate, 
arrange 
and 
influence 
his 
apperception 
of 
life 
under 
its? 
compulsion, 
and 
second 
because 
one 
can 
never 
succeed 
in 
carrying 
out 
such 
a 
fiction 
in 
real 
life 
except 
in 
a 
psychosis. 


In 
this 
way, 
there 
develops 
in 
the 
psyche 
of 
the 
child 
an 
intensive 
searching, 
weighing, 
and 
measuring 
tendency 
of 
which 
I 
shall 
have 
to 
say 
something 
more. 
That 
which 
is 
according 
to 
my 
experience 
primarily 
responsible 
for 
the 
too 
rigid 
assumption 
of 
the 
paternal 
guiding 
principles, 
may 
be 
discovered 
in 
an 
investigation 
into 
the 
sexual 
roles. 
The 
neurotically 
predisposed 
child, 
or 
as 
I 
may 
say, 
the 
child 
laboring 
under 
the 
pressure 
of 
a 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
desires 
to 
become 
a 
man, 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
neurosis 
develops, 
to 
be 
a 
man. 
In 
both 
instances 
he 
can 
only 
conduct 
himself 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
as 
if 
he 
were 
a 
man 
or 
shall 
become 
one. 
The 
exaggerated 
craving 
for 
security 
drives 
also 
in 
this 
instance 
the 
attitude 
of 
the 
developing 
neurotic 
into 
the 
ban 
of 
the 
fiction, 
so 
that 
in 
some 
instances 
even 
conscious 
simulation 
may 
come 
into 
play, 
and 
a 
girl 
for 
instance 
in 
order 
to 
escape 
a 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
may 
in 
the 
beginning 
borrow 
in 
conscious 
imitation 
masculine 
gestures 
of 
her 
father. 
There 
is 
no 
reason 
for 
the 
assumption 
that 
because 
of 
this 
she 
must 
be 
in 
love 
with 
her 
father. 
The 
mere 
over-valuation 
of 
the 
masculine 
principle 
suffices 
for 
this, 
may 
nevertheless 
at' 
times 
be 
taken 
as 
infatuation 
by 
the 
girl 
herself 
as 
well 
as 
by 
her 
environment, 
should 
the 
preparations 
for 
the 
future 
playfully 
demand 
a 
hinting 
of 
love 
or 
a 
marriage. 
In 
our 
case 
the 
guiding 
line 
to 
the 
compensatory 
ego-ideal, 
transformed 
itself 
through 
a 
change 
of 
form 
and 
content 
into 
a 
craving 
to 
excel 
the 
father 
in 
wealth, 
esteem, 
and 
along 
with 
this, 
in 
manliness. 
The 
inquiry 
into 
his 
own 
sexual 
role, 
sets 
in 
intensively 
and 
typically 
as 
sexual 



curiosity, 
whereby 
the 
patient 
in 
his 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
apperceives 
the 
smallness 
of 
his 
infantile 
genitals 
as 
compared 
with 
the 
largeness 
of 
the 
paternal 
ones, 
as 
a 
bitter 
set-back, 
as 
a 
want 
of 
masculinity. 
His 
ambitiousness 
which 
shall 
enable 
him 
to 
rise 
out 
of 
his 
state 
of 
inferiority, 
compelled 
him 
to 
a 
heightening 
of 
his 
sense 
of 
shame, 
in 
order 
that 
his 
genitals 
may 
not 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
event 
of 
an 
exposure 
(in 
case 
he 
is 
nude). 
To 
this 
may 
be 
added 
that 
lie 
was 
of 
Jewish 
descent. 
He 
had 
heard 
certain 
things 
about 
circumcision 
and 
harbored 
the 
idea 
that 
he 
was 
also 
(Verkiirzt) 
belittled 
through 
the 
operation. 
His 
masculine 
protest 
drove 
him 
to 
a 
degradation 
of 
woman, 
as 
if 
he 
had 
to 
give 
proof 
to 
his 
superiority 
in 
this 
wise, 
and 
came 
into 
the 
most 
abominable 
relationship 
with 
his 
mother. 


But 
also 
with 
respect 
to 
his 
father, 
whose 
preference 
for 
"himself 
he 
gained 
through 
diplomatic 
adjustment, 
he 
harbored 
"hostile 
thoughts 
which 
became 
especially 
prominent 
when 
the 
father 
over-emphasized 
his 
own 
superiority 
to 
do 
which 
he 
had 
a 
marked 
inclination. 
In 
this 
chaos 
of 
feelings 
the 
patient 
sought 
orientation, 
and 
found 
it 
only 
in 
the 
thought 
to 
become 
superior 
to 
his 
father, 
to 
become 
more 
manly 
than 
he. 


He 
had, 
too, 
as 
often 
happens 
in 
such 
cases, 
undertaken 
attempts 
at 
enlarging 
his 
genitals 
or 
bringing 
about 
erection. 
This 
route, 
which 
leads 
to 
sexual 
precocity 
and 
masturbation, 
was 
soon 
abandoned 
by 
him, 
because 
his 
father 
warned 
him 
against 
it 
on 
numerous 
occasions. 
Thus 
there 
remained 
as 
a 
substitution 
for 
his 
masculine 
protest, 
only 
efforts 
to 
become 
richer, 
more 
honored 
and 
wiser 
than 
his 
father, 
and 
to 
degrade 
his 
environment. 


His 
father 
placed 
great 
hopes 
in 
the 
patient's 
oratorical 
talents, 
which 
had 
shown 
themselves 
already 
in 
childhood, 
did 
not 
allow 
himself 
to 
be 
deceived 
by 
the 
mild 
stammering 
of 
the 
boy, 
and 
hoped 
he 
would 
make 
a 
law 
career. 
In 
this 
respect 
the 
patient 
was 
able 
to 
strike 
at 
the 
father's 
most 
vulnerable 
point, 
and 
thus 
he 
sank 
into 
a 
more 
pronounced 
stammering, 
a 
neurotic 
manifestation 
of 
the 
insurance 
against 
the 
superiority 
of 
the 
father, 
a 
manifestation 
whose 
inception 
was 
given 
him 
by 
a 
stammering 
home 
teacher. 
In 
the 
course 
of 
time, 
this 
symptom 
gained 
many 
other 
uses, 
for 
example, 
the 
one 
that 
through 
his 
stammering 
he 
always 
gained 
time 
in 
which 
to 
weigh 
his 
words, 
to 
avoid 
demands 
of 
the 
family, 
to 
utilize 
the 
confession 
of 
others 
as 
well 
as 
that 
prejudice 
because 
of 
which, 
only 
little 
was 
expected 
of 
him, 
which 
he 
then 
managed 
to 
fulfil 
easily. 
It 
is 
interesting 
that 
his 
quite 
apparent 



stammering 
was 
no 
obstacle 
to 
his 
courtship, 
that 
it 
even 
expedited 
matters, 
a 
fact 
which 
becomes 
quite 
comprehensible 
from 
our 
standpoint, 
according 
to 
which 
we 
assume 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
quite 
prevalent 
type 
of 
girl 
which 
cannot 
omit 
from 
the 
conditions 
of 
their 
love 
that 
the 
man 
of 
their 
choice 
must 
be 
beneath 
them, 
so 
that 
they 
may 
with 
certainty 
rule 
over 
him. 
Especially 
hostile 
feelings 
against 
his 
parents, 
brothers 
and 
sisters 
and 
the 
servants 
he 
put 
a 
stop 
to, 
through 
the 
development 
of 
a 
new 
guiding 
principle 
which 
was 
to 
make 
of 
him 
a 
benevolent 
man. 
This 
new 
evolution 
took 
place 
under 
a 
nightly 
confession 
through 
which 
he 
reproached 
himself 
for 
his 
wickedness 
and 
arranged 
qualms 
of 
conscience. 
His 
growing 
knowledge 
thus 
showed 
him 
the 
way, 
through 
a 
cultural 
subterfuge 
to 
a 
heightening 
of 
his 
ego-
consciousness. 


The 
want 
of 
a 
direct 
aggressiveness 
showed 
itself 
in 
thoughts 
and 
phantasies, 
albeit 
also 
in 
his 
good 
progress 
at 
school, 
so 
that 
he 
was 
victorious 
over 
all 
his 
classmates. 
A 
growing 
tendency 
towards 
sarcasm 
and 
exasperation 
of 
others 
was 
at 
this 
time 
the 
only 
manifest 
expression 
of 
his 
former 
often 
violent 
aggressiveness 
which 
gained 
for 
him 
the 
nickname 
of 
"blood-leech." 
His 
combative 
attitude 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
the 
cause 
of 
Judaism, 
which 
was 
reflected 
in 
an 
act 
of 
compulsion 
at 
the 
age 
of 
twelve. 
Whenever 
he 
entered 
a 
swimming 
pool 
he 
had 
to 
cover 
his 
genitals 
with 
his 
hands 
and 
immediately 
submerge 
his 
head 
under 
the 
water, 
where 
he 
kept 
it 
until 
he 
counted 
49, 
so 
that 
he 
often 
came 
to 
the 
surface 
gasping 
for 
air 
and 
exhausted. 
The 
analysis 
revealed 
the 
mental 
content 
to 
be 
a 
striving 
of 
his 
phantasy 
to 
bring 
about 
an 
equality 
of 
genitalia. 
The 
forty-ninth 
year 
is, 
according 
to 
the 
old 
Jewish 
laws, 
with 
which 
he 
had 
become 
acquainted 
shortly 
before, 
the 
year 
of 
the 
jubilee, 
in 
which 
all 
acres 
were 
again 
made 
equal. 
Ideas 
of 
this 
sort, 
and 
the 
simultaneous 
concealment 
of 
the 
genitalia 
showed 
the 
way 
to 
the 
interpretation. 
One 
may 
almost 
draw 
the 
conclusion 
that 
also 
his 
stammering 
was 
intended 
to 
make 
him 
quits 
with 
a 
superiority 
of 
his 
father, 
of 
all 
people, 
inasmuch 
as 
his 
stuttering 
was 
an 
obstacle 
to 
them, 
was 
even 
painful 
to 
them. 


His 
avarice, 
his 
stinginess, 
were 
accordingly 
active 
in" 
the 
same 
direction, 
namely, 
to 
clear 
the 
field 
of 
superiorities 
of 
others, 
to 
insure 
him 
against 
further 
degradation 
and 
belittling 
through 
poverty, 
thus 
he 
was 
compelled 
markedly 
to 
expand 
these 
secondary 
directions 
and 
to 
formulate 
and 
evaluate 



his 
experiences 
according 
to 
them 
in 
order 
to 
reach 
the 
heightening 
of 
his 
ego-consciousness, 
his 
masculine 
protest. 
It 
was 
only 
under 
such 
circumstances 
where 
through 
revelation 
of 
these 
traits 
of 
character 
a 
lowering 
of 
his 
ego 
might 
arise 
that 
he 
suppressed 
their 
apparent 
activity. 


It 
were 
an 
absurdity 
to 
wish 
to 
assume 
a 
normal 
standpoint 
in 
a 
medico-
psychological 
question, 
to 
consider 
people 
like 
the 
above 
as 
morally 
inferior. 
Those 
who 
have 
an 
inclination 
in 
this 
direction 
I 
wish 
to 
remind 
of 
the 
very 
strong, 
compensatory 
traits 
of 
character, 
of 
a 
worthy 
nature, 
for 
the 
rest 
I 
wish 
to 
remind 
them 
of 
Rochefoucauld's 
wise 
sentence 
viz: 
" 
I 
have 
never 
investigated 
the 
soul 
of 
a 
wicked 
man, 
but 
I 
once 
became 
acquainted 
with 
the 
soul 
of 
a 
good 
man: 
I 
was 
shocked." 


In 
another 
case, 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
avarice 
showed 
itself 
not 
as 
a 
safety 
device 
for 
the 
compensation 
of 
a 
feeling 
of 
degradation, 
but 
above 
all 
as 
an 
artifice 
in 
the 
service 
of 
the 
craving 
for 
security. 
A 
forty-five 
year 
old 
patient 
who 
suffered 
throughout 
life 
from 
psychic 
impotency, 
and 
was 
pursued 
by 
suicidal 
ideas, 
showed 
an 
especially 
marked 
tendency 
to 
degrade 
others. 


We 
know 
this 
trait 
of 
character 
from 
the 
description 
of 
the 
previous 
case 
where 
it 
served 
as 
it 
always 
does 
to 
do 
away 
with 
one's 
own 
feeling 
of 
inferiority. 
With 
this 
tendency 
there 
is 
usually 
associated 
exaggerated 
mistrust 
and 
envy, 
which 
have 
for 
their 
object 
as 
neurotic-psychic 
dexterities, 
the 
falsification 
of 
the 
search 
and 
valuation 
of 
experiences. 
A 
tendency, 
too, 
to 
cause 
others 
bodily 
and 
psychic 
pain, 
will 
likewise 
know 
how 
to 
assert 
itself 
in 
an 
accentuated 
manner. 
The 
abstract, 
guiding 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
patient, 
to 
assure 
his 
dominating 
position, 
to 
be 
above, 
appeared 
to 
be 
obviously 
threatened, 
and 
compelled 
a 
strengthening 
of 
fictitious 
guiding 
principles. 
Reminiscences 
out 
of 
his 
infantile 
period 
were 
utilized 
in 
the 
neurosis, 
as 
result 
of 
which 
he 
came 
near 
being 
the 
victim 
of 
a 
homosexualist. 
He 
was 
raised 
as 
an 
only 
boy 
among 
his 
sisters, 
a 
situation 
which, 
according 
to 
my 
experience, 
frequently 
narrows 
the 
understanding 
of 
one's 
own 
sexual 
role. 


Of 
importance 
was 
his 
attitude 
toward 
his 
father, 
because 
it 
likewise 
drove 
him 
to 
strengthened 
security 
devices. 
The 
father, 
namely, 
was 
brutal, 
egotistical, 
tyrannical, 
so 
that 
it 
was 
difficult 
for 
the 
boy 
to 
assert 
his 
own 
value 
in 
his 
presence. 
Several 
love 
adventures 
had 
thrown 
the 
father 
into 
quite 
difficult 
situations 
which 
our 
patient 
utilized 
as 
mementoes 
in 
his 



developed 
psychosis. 
This 
mistrust 
was 
directed 
against 
all 
women. 
Throughout 
life 
he 
remained 
ready 
to 
make 
sacrifices 
for 
his 
sisters, 
but 
he 
had 
already 
apperceived 
this 
fact 
with 
an 
unusual 
amount 
of 
feeling, 
and 
readily 
developed 
from 
this 
trains 
of 
thought 
which 
were 
to 
show 
how 
readily 
he 
gave 
in 
to 
women. 
Incidentally, 
he 
was 
able 
to 
advance 
quite 
considerably 
in 
this 
direction 
in 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
emphasize 
sharply 
this 
impression 
for 
himself. 
It 
was 
then 
that 
he 
was 
prepared 
to 
withdraw 
himself 
from 
women. 


He 
transformed 
into 
a 
sexual 
image, 
feelings 
of 
inferiority 
which 
were 
present 
in 
his 
childhood. 
The 
reason 
for 
his 
unmanly 
bearing 
for 
the 
homosexualist 
wanted 
to 
take 
him 
for 
a 
girl 
he 
sought 
for 
and 
found 
in 
an 
incidental 
Cryptorchism 
caused 
by 
a 
patent 
canal. 
At 
the 
age 
of 
eight 
he 
watched 
a 
boy 
in 
the 
act 
of 
masturbation. 
Hic 
puer 
ei 
semen 
ejacularit 
in 
os 
which 
he 
looked 
upon 
as 
a 
further 
sign 
of 
his 
feminine 
role. 
So 
long 
as 
he 
took 
his 
father 
as 
his 
guiding 
principle, 
he 
exhibited 
the 
ordinary 
dexterities 
intended 
to 
make 
him 
equal 
to 
his 
father. 
He 
secretly 
consumed 
his 
father's 
whiskey, 
endeavored 
to 
bring 
his 
mother 
over 
to 
his 
side, 
and 
already 
early 
in 
life 
had 
chosen 
his 
father's 
trade, 
by 
means 
of 
which 
he 
was 
also 
able 
to 
satisfy 
his 
sadistic 
tendencies 
which 
were 
excited 
by 
his 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
and 
his 
striving 
toward 
the 
paternal 
guiding 
line 
to 
choose 
the 
trade 
of 
a 
butcher. 
He 
was 
also 
fond 
of 
bringing 
his 
vulgar 
tendencies 
into 
execution 
upon 
girls 
and 
women 
he 
was 
in 
the 
habit 
of 
biting 
them, 
beating 
them, 
and 
took 
part 
one 
time 
in 
a 
sexual 
assault, 
when 
he 
carried 
out 
coitus 
per 
anum 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
a 
possibility 
of 
alimony. 
His 
experience, 
however, 
which 
showed 
him 
in 
the 
complete 
brutal 
character 
of 
his 
father, 
drove 
him, 
because 
of 
the 
threatening 
of 
a 
lawsuit, 
and 
the 
degradation 
associated 
with 
it, 
to 
a 
neurotic 
subterfuge. 
He 
utilized 
his 
already 
accentuated 
mistrust 
in 
women 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
torturing 
them 
with 
fits 
of 
jealousy, 
of 
bringing 
them 
entirely 
under 
his 
influence 
and 
to 
insure 
in 
this 
manner 
the 
appearance 
of 
dominancy. 


His 
ejaculatio 
prascox 
and 
the 
associated 
impotency 
served 
his 
need 
for 
security 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
did 
his 
animosity 
towards 
women. 
He 
showed 
preference 
for 
the 
seduction 
of 
married 
women 
in 
order 
to 
cause 
them 
disappointments 
through 
his 
impotency, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
however, 
to 
gain 
in 
a 
sportive 
manner 
a 
substantiation 
of 
his 
belief 
that 
all 
women 
were 
bad. 
Also 
in 
his 
compulsory 
ideas 
this 
tendency 
to 
cause 
pain 
manifested 
itself. 
Thus 



even 
during 
his 
treatment 
he 
experienced 
sudden 
impulsions 
to 
bite 
and 
beat 
a 
language 
teacher 
while 
taking 
a 
lesson 
from 
her, 
because 
he 
developed 
ideas 
that 
she 
had 
a 
lover 
whom 
she 
preferred 
to 
the 
patient. 
This 
sadistic 
reaction 
to 
a 
feeling 
of 
subordinacy, 
as 
a 
masculine' 
protest 
against 
a 
feeling 
of 
being 
unmanly, 
effeminate, 
had 
its 
origin 
in 
childhood 
and 
runs 
through 
his 
entire 
neurosis. 
It 
was 
not 
difficult 
to 
prove, 
that 
his 
impotency 
similarly 
obeyed 
the 
goal 
to 
find 
a 
means 
whereby 
to 
escape 
the 
call 
of 
love, 
the 
subordination 
to 
a 
wife, 
a 
tendency, 
however, 
which 
found 
its 
continuation 
in 
a 
further 
degradation 
of 
women. 


As 
he 
saw 
no 
prospect 
of 
dominating 
his 
teacher, 
he 
immediately 
left 
her, 
because 
he 
knew 
that 
she 
was 
dependent 
upon 
giving 
him 
lessons. 
Before, 
however, 
having 
done 
this 
he 
undertook 
a 
critical 
estimation 
of 
the 
expense 
of 
taking 
lessons, 
found 
them 
beyond 
his 
means 
which 
could 
be 
readily 
seen 
to 
be 
a 
false 
purposive 
valuation 
of 
the 
very 
well-to-do 
individual. 
In 
the 
same 
manner 
he 
made 
use 
of 
the 
occasionally 
recurring 
reminiscences 
of 
incestuous 
thoughts, 
in 
order 
to 
become 
apprehensively 
conscious 
of 
his 
inferiority, 
of 
his 
criminal 
tendencies 
as 
soon 
as 
women 
came 
into 
play. 
Thus 
he 
established 
his 
base 
of 
operation, 
by 
means 
of 
which 
he 
must 
insure 
himself 
against 
the 
feminine 
gender, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
which 
he 
seemed 
to 
be 
assured 
of 
lasting 
superiority 
throughout 
life. 


The 
essence 
of 
his 
compulsion 
towards 
an 
insurance 
against 
women 
lay 
in 
the 
fear 
that 
he 
might 
experience 
in 
marriage 
or 
love 
disappointment 
which 
he 
might 
attribute 
to 
his 
unmanliness. 
Inasmuch 
as 
he 
sought 
his 
remote 
goal 
in 
the 
proof 
of 
his 
might 
he 
was 
bound 
to 
become 
inclined 
toward 
caution 
and 
neurotic 
subterfuges. 
In 
this 
patient 
also 
there 
were 
present 
early 
gastrointestinal 
disturbances, 
and 
as 
a 
peripheral 
sign 
of 
inferiority 
the 
fatal 
inguinal 
hernia. 
In 
his 
sort 
of 
love-activity, 
exaggerated 
avarice 
lent 
itself 
as 
the 
most 
useful 
means 
for 
an 
insurance 
against 
a 
too 
far-reaching 
surrender. 
In 
order, 
however, 
that 
this 
avarice 
may 
be 
of 
use, 
it 
must 
embrace 
the 
whole 
sphere 
of 
his 
life's 
relations 
and 
must 
be 
omnipresent. 
It 
must 
in 
turn 
be 
supported, 
it 
must 
be 
assisted 
by 
all 
sorts 
of 
by-traits. 
This 
took 
place 
among 
other 
things 
in 
the 
arrangement 
of 
compulsory 
ideas. 
Whenever 
he 
used 
an 
automobile, 
the 
thought 
that 
a 
collision 
might 
take 
place 
came 
to 
his 
mind. 
A 
further 
analysis 
of 
this 
compulsory 
idea 
revealed 
that 
he 
was 
farthest 
away 
from 
a 
belief 
in 
such 
an 
eventuality, 
but 
that 
he 
always 
avoided 
all 
expensive 



means 
of 
travel. 
Yes, 
even 
when 
he 
used 
the 
tram 
cars 
for 
an 
extended 
trip, 
the 
thought 
occurred 
to 
him, 
upon 
reaching 
the 
point 
where 
the 
cheap 
fare 
terminated 
and 
the 
more 
expensive 
one 
began, 
that 
a 
collision 
might 
take 
place, 
or 
that 
the 
bridge 
which 
had 
to 
be 
crossed 
might 
collapse, 
so 
that 
he 
would 
always 
pay 
the 
cheaper 
fare, 
save 
a 
few 
pennies 
and 
cover 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
distance 
on 
foot. 
He 
was 
on 
the 
road 
where 
he 
felt 
bitterly 
every 
expenditure. 


Thus 
it 
also 
came 
to 
pass 
that 
he 
sought 
to 
degrade 
man, 
in 
order 
to 
gain 
a 
uniformity 
of 
behavior. 
This 
already 
became 
distinctly 
manifest 
in 
the 
hunt 
after 
married 
women, 
and 
the 
dismay 
and 
disappointment 
of 
the 
seduced 
women 
as 
well 
as 
the 
abusive 
language 
which 
he 
used 
toward 
them 
afterwards 
pleased 
him 
no 
less 
than 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
once 
again 
having 
shown 
himself 
to 
be 
the 
stronger. 
This 
was 
in 
line 
with 
the 
content 
of 
his 
life, 
with 
the 
change 
of 
form 
in 
which 
his 
original 
fiction 
to 
be 
the 
manliest 
came 
closest 
to 
realization. 


Only 
the 
fear 
of 
women 
which 
synchronously 
with 
the 
realization 
of 
his 
own 
femininity 
originally 
led 
him 
to 
his 
exaggerated 
masculine 
protest, 
found 
itself 
again 
in 
the 
unduly 
accentuated 
insurance 
against 
the 
domination 
of 
women 
and 
allowed 
him 
to 
strengthen 
beyond 
measure 
like 
a 
safety-dam 
his 
mistrust 
and 
avarice, 
both 
of 
which 
offered 
good 
arguments. 
Swept 
away 
by 
this 
craving 
for 
security, 
he 
furthermore 
attached 
4 
to 
it 
his 
psychic 
impotency, 
with 
which 
he 
became 
acquainted 
during 
his 
first 
attempts 
at 
coitus. 
A 
servant 
girl 
whom 
he 
wanted 
to 
seduce 
as 
a 
youngster, 
offered 
resistance 
and 
escaped 
him 
by 
tightening 
her 
limbs. 
He 
was 
at 
that 
time 
inexperienced 
and 
considered 
himself 
impotent. 
Later, 
as 
he 
became 
more 
experienced 
in 
these 
matters, 
he 
felt 
his 
inexperience 
in 
such 
a 
way, 
as 
if 
women 
were 
an 
insoluble 
puzzle 
to 
him. 
In 
the 
original 
impotency, 
however, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
his 
helplessness 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
woman, 
he 
found 
the 
neurotic 
subterfuges 
by 
means 
of 
which 
to 
escape 
a 
depreciatory 
defeat, 
a 
decision 
adverse 
to 
his 
masculinity. 
The 
comparing 
of 
himself 
with 
other 
men 
set 
in 
vehemently 
now. 
He 
would 
surprise 
himself 
for 
instance, 
when 
sitting 
at 
the 
table 
in 
company, 
in 
a 
psychic 
situation, 
where 
before 
any 
one 
even 
had 
spoken 
a 
word, 
he 
was 
already 
planning 
a 
repartee, 
already 
figuring 
how 
he 
might 
prove 
the 
speaker 
wrong, 
no 
matter 
whether 
he 
was 
speaking 
of 
a 
book 
or 
a 
theatrical 
performance, 
or 
society 
or 
place, 
his 
derogatory 
criticism 



always 
pushed 
itself 
to 
the 
front 
in 
a 
most 
pronounced 
form. 
And 
so 
it 
was 
to 
be 
expected 
that 
after 
a 
brief 
introductory 
period 
his 
traits 
of 
mistrust, 
avarice, 
and 
depreciation 
of 
others 
would 
become 
evident 
every 
time 
he 
underwent 
medical 
treatment, 
often 
quite 
artfully 
linked 
one 
with 
the 
other. 
This 
phenomenon, 
not 
at 
all 
in 
the 
Freudian 
sense 
of 
a 
transference, 
but 
because 
his 
rigidly 
fixed 
psychic 
gesture, 
his 
attitude 
of 
attack, 
his 
tendency 
to 
degrade 
others, 
actually 
did, 
and 
upon 
closer 
acquaintance, 
was 
obliged 
to 
come 
to 
the 
surface. 
To 
this 
was 
added 
another 
accentuating 
moment. 
His 
object 
when 
seeking 
the 
advice 
of 
a 
physician, 
could 
not 
have 
been 
simply 
to 
become 
rid 
of 
his 
impotency, 
because 
in 
such 
an 
event 
he 
would 
have 
been 
cast 
into 
the 
chaos 
of 
his 
apprehensions. 
He 
was 
much 
more 
anxious 
to 
find 
proof 
of 
his 
incurability, 
or 
to 
find 
a 
means 
of 
ridding 
himself 
of 
his 
impotency 
without 
the 
fear 
of 
a 
defeat. 
In 
order 
to 
bring 
about 
the 
first, 
a 
depreciation 
of 
the 
physician's 
ability 
was 
a 
preliminary 
condition. 
The 
proper 
means 
of 
ridding 
himself 
of 
his 
impotency, 
however, 
he 
could 
only 
find 
after 
following 
up 
his 
fear 
of 
women 
to 
its 
source, 
to 
the 
feeling 
of 
his 
unmanliness, 
in 
which 
his 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
became 
concrete. 
One 
of 
his 
dreams 
which 
occurred 
at 
the 
period 
preceding 
the 
termination 
of 
the 
treatment 
showed 
this 
state 
of 
affairs 
very 
distinctly. 


I 
must 
first 
of 
all 
briefly 
state 
that 
I 
make 
use 
of 
certain 
important 
parts 
of 
the 
Breuer-Freud 
technique 
of 
dream 
interpretation, 
but 
that 
I 
see 
in 
the 
dream 
an 
abstracting, 
simplifying 
endeavor 
to 
find, 
by 
means 
of 
a 
premeditation 
and 
testing 
of 
difficulties 
carried 
on 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
patient's 
own 
peculiar 
scheme 
a 
protective 
way 
for 
the 
ego-consciousness 
out 
of 
a 
situation 
which 
threatens 
a 
defeat. 


One 
will 
therefore 
always 
discover 
in 
the 
dream, 
that 
significant 
scheme 
of 
the 
antithetical 
mode 
of 
apperception: 
" 
masculine-feminine," 
"above 
beneath" 
as 
existing 
originally 
in 
everybody, 
but 
especially 
marked 
in 
the 
neurotic. 
The 
various 
notions 
and 
recollections 
which 
come 
to 
the 
surface 
in 
the 
dream, 
must 
be 
brought 
within 
this 
scheme 
before 
they 
can 
be 
of 
any 
aid 
in 
the 
interpretation 
of 
same, 
whose 
object 
it 
is 
not 
or 
at 
least 
not 
principally 
the 
fulfilment 
of 
infantile 
wishes 
but 
rather 
to 
accompany 
those 
introductory 
endeavors, 
to 
bring 
about 
a 
balance 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness, 
through 
balancing 
the 
patient's 
debit-credit 
account 
in 
a 
peculiarly 
neurotic 
manner. 
His 
dream 
was 
as 
follows: 



“I 
dealt 
in 
second-hand 
goods 
in 
Vienna, 
or 
in 
Germany, 
or 
in 
France. 
I 
had 
to 
buy, 
however, 
new 
goods 
and 
wash 
them, 
because 
this 
would 
then 
be 
cheaper. 
Then 
they 
were 
again 
old 
(second-hand) 
goods." 


The 
new 
goods 
meant 
new 
potent 
genitalia 
in 
contrast 
to 
the 
"(secondhand) 
old 
goods," 
his 
impotency 
which 
as 
yet 
nobody 
had 
cured. 
Here 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
new 
life, 
of 
a 
possibility 
of 
attaining 
potency, 
shines 
through. 
The 
words, 
"because 
they 
would 
be 
cheaper" 
correspond 
to 
the 
previously 
elucidated 
ideas, 
his 
fear 
of 
money 
expenditures 
in 
case 
he 
does 
not 
become 
potent. 
This 
idea, 
however, 
can 
only 
be 
accepted 
under 
one 
condition, 
to 
wit 
if 
the 
patient 
is 
saturated 
with 
the 
conviction 
that 
he 
is 
boundless 
in 
his 
love-
impulse, 
that 
he 
knows 
no 
limits 
and 
senselessly 
hunts 
after 
women. 
This 
conviction 
he 
purposely 
takes 
for 
himself 
out 
of 
his 
childhood 
reminiscences, 
out 
of 
his 
period 
of 
puberty 
and 
adolescence. 
In 
doing 
so 
he 
also 
assists 
in 
the 
shaping 
of 
his 
infantile 
incest-stirrings 
should 
these 
serve 
his 
purpose 
in 
a 
form, 
as 
if 
he 
had 
coveted 
his 
mother 
or 
sisters 
with 
a 
sexual 
object. 
This 
means 
that 
he 
works, 
with 
a 
fiction 
which 
arose 
from 
the 
assumed 
goal, 
through 
gaining 
security 
for 
himself, 
similarly 
as 
Sophocles 
developed 
and 
shaped 
the 
OEdipus 
legend 
in 
order 
to 
stabilize 
the 
holy 
commands 
of 
the 
gods. 
Our 
patient 
became 
a 
willing 
victim 
of 
his 
limited 
understanding 
of 
dialectic 
and 
of 
the 
antithetical 
manner 
of 
primitive 
thinking. 
The 
guiding 
idea 
of 
his 
ego-ideal 
" 
I 
must 
not 
covet 
blood 
relations," 
embraces 
dialectically 
the 
antithetical 
thought 
of 
an 
incestuous 
possibility. 
Inasmuch 
as 
the 
neurotic 
desires 
to 
insure 
himself, 
he 
clings 
to 
this 
antithetical 
thought, 
plays 
with 
it, 
emphasizes 
it 
and 
utilizes 
it 
in 
the 
neurosis 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
all 
other 
frightening 
reminiscences 
which 
appear 
to 
him 
to 
be 
useful 
for 
his 
security. 
In 
the 
life 
of 
our 
patient, 
and 
in 
the 
lives 
of 
all 
neurotics, 
there 
are 
very 
many 
more 
experiences, 
which 
might 
have 
been 
able 
to 
carry 
with 
them 
the 
conviction 
that 
they 
were 
free 
from 
incestuous 
stimuli, 
that 
they 
were 
always 
especially 
temperate, 
careful 
and 
timorous. 


Inasmuch, 
however, 
as 
he 
desires 
to 
reassure 
himself, 
his 
neurotic 
and 
falsifying 
mode 
of 
apperception 
push 
these 
traits 
of 
character 
purposely 
aside. 
He 
has 
many 
more 
impressions 
to 
that 
effect, 
that 
he 
does 
not 
covet 
his 
mother 
and 
sister, 
but 
he 
is, 
however, 
unable 
to 
utilize 
them 
in 
the 
service 
of 
his 
craving 
for 
security. 
Thus 
there 
remains 
for 
them 
only 
a 
memory 
rest 
of 
a 
playful 
preparatory 
venture, 
and 
because 
this 
may 
serve 
as 
a 
warning 
to 
him, 



he 
makes 
of 
it 
a 
bugbear, 
with 
which 
to 
frighten 
himself. 
Exactly 
in 
the 
same 
manner, 
develop 
neurotic 
anxiety, 
fear 
of 
places, 
hypochondriasis, 
pessimism 
and 
constant 
doubting, 
inasmuch 
as 
these 
patients 
only 
avail 
themselves 
of 
those 
impressions 
and 
experiences 
which 
serve 
the 
purpose 
of 
bringing 
about 
security, 
which 
strengthens 
their 
affective 
state 
while 
they 
depreciate 
all 
others 
especially 
those 
of 
an 
antithetical 
nature. 
The 
sophist's 
ability 
"in 
utram-que 
part 
em 
dicer 
e" 
of 
everything 
is 
also 
possessed 
by 
the 
neurotic 
as 
well 
as 
by 
the 
psychotic, 
and 
they 
utilize 
it 
as 
they 
need 
it. 


The 
thoroughly 
polished, 
purposefully 
strengthened 
dexterities 
of 
neurotics, 
and 
the 
neurotic 
traits 
of 
character 
which 
go 
with 
them 
are 
impossible 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
every 
new 
situation 
brings 
about 
havoc. 
(Lombroso's 
misoneismus.) 
More 
than 
anything 
else, 
our 
patient 
feared 
the, 
to 
him 
unknown, 
situation 
of 
sexual 
gratification 
and 
successful 
coitus, 
because 
in 
presentiments 
of 
this 
situation, 
he 
gave 
himself 
for 
reasons 
of 
safety 
the 
role 
of 
the 
underlying 
(unterliegenden). 
Now 
this 
fear, 
which 
is 
apperceived 
as 
a 
fear 
of 
impotency, 
furnishes 
a 
further 
security 
against 
the 
possibility 
of 
being 
restrained, 
restricted 
in 
freedom 
or 
deceived 
by 
his 
wife, 
against 
a 
possibility 
of 
not 
being 
equal 
to 
her, 
against 
a 
role 
which 
is 
contrary 
to 
his 
masculine 
ideal, 
and 
which 
he 
therefore 
evaluates 
as 
effeminate. 


Out 
of 
the 
harmless, 
ubiquitous 
traits 
of 
selfishness, 
avarice 
and 
stinginess, 
he 
puts 
together 
a 
far-reaching, 
apparently 
imminent, 
but 
in 
reality 
fictitious 
guiding 
principle 
of 
"avarice," 
because 
the 
retention 
of 
this 
appears 
to 
him 
to 
be 
lost. 
Should 
he 
become 
endowed, 
as 
was 
the 
case 
in 
the 
dream 
with 
that 
which 
he 
had 
desired 
already 
in 
childhood, 
namely, 
new 
genitals, 
a 
healthy 
potency, 
then 
he 
must 
defend 
himself 
against 
it. 
He 
takes 
hold 
then 
of 
a 
means, 
with 
which 
he 
has 
been 
long 
acquainted, 
which 
has 
often 
been 
highly 
recommended 
to 
him, 
which 
after 
all 
enfeebles 
his 
erections 
instead 
of 
strengthening 
them, 
he 
turns 
to 
cold 
washes. 
This 
according 
to 
his 
experiences, 
inadequate 
remedy, 
he 
considers 
equal 
to 
my 
treatment. 
The 
remedy 
shall 
bring 
about 
the 
opposite 
to 
what 
it 
is 
aimed 
to 
do, 
and 
this 
physician 
shall 
have 
just 
as 
little 
success 
as 
the 
former 
ones. 
Thus 
the 
dream 
shows 
him 
the 
way 
out 
of 
the 
situation, 
it 
tells 
him 
how 
to 
safeguard 
himself 
against 
the 
treatment 
and 
thus 
get 
the 
upper 
hand 
of 
the 
physician. 
“Then 
they 
are 
second-hand 
goods 
again." 


In 
other 
cases 
of 
psychic 
impotency 
a 
cure 
readily 
results, 
and 
as 
we 



know, 
as 
result 
of 
the 
most 
diverse 
kinds 
of 
remedies. 
Often 
it 
concerns 
neurotic 
patients 
who 
by 
the 
mere 
fact 
of 
going 
to 
consult 
a 
physician 
give 
one 
to 
understand 
that 
they 
would 
be 
inclined 
to 
give 
up 
this 
form 
of 
security. 
In 
that 
case 
all 
manner 
of 
medication, 
cold 
douches, 
electricity, 
hydrotheragy, 
and 
especially 
every 
form 
of 
suggestion, 
even 
the 
one 
resulting 
from 
an 
incomplete 
analysis 
are 
of 
value, 
occasionally 
the 
authoritative 
command 
of 
the 
physician 
suffices 
to 
bring 
about 
definite 
consequences. 
In 
severe 
cases, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
bring 
about 
a 
transformation 
of 
the 
all 
too 
absorbing, 
concentrated 
psyche 
upon 
the 
idea 
of 
security. 


Age 
often 
intensely 
stimulates 
envy 
and 
avarice. 
Psychologically 
this 
is 
not 
difficult 
to 
understand. 
No 
matter 
how 
beautifully 
poets 
and 
philosophers 
endeavor 
to 
picture 
age, 
it 
is 
nevertheless 
only 
given 
to 
the 
select 
souls, 
to 
maintain 
their 
equilibrium, 
when 
they 
see 
looming 
up 
in 
the 
distance 
the 
gate 
which 
leads 
to 
death. 
Then 
again 
the 
denials 
and 
restrictions, 
which 
the 
senium 
naturally 
carries 
with 
it, 
and 
the 
perceptible 
dominancy 
of 
the 
younger 
folks, 
of 
one's 
own 
relations, 
which 
often 
furnish 
the 
occasion, 
quite 
innocently 
or 
apparently 
so 
for 
a 
degradation 
of 
old 
people 
will 
almost 
always 
lead 
to 
a 
depression 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness. 
The 
sunshiny 
preparedness 
as 
it 
is 
refreshingly 
expressed 
in 
Goethe's 
" 
Father 
Time 
" 
is 
a 
quite 
unattainable 
illusion 
for 
most 
people, 
and 
fortunate 
indeed 
may 
be 
considered 
those 
who 
survive 
their 
best 
time 
of 
life 
without 
a 
severe 
depression 
of 
the 
spirits. 


According 
to 
our 
thesis, 
it 
must 
naturally 
follow 
that 
the 
period 
of 
aging 
brings 
forth 
similarly 
to 
a 
severe 
setback, 
a 
feeling 
of 
inferiority. 
Especially 
affected 
by 
this 
will 
be 
all 
those 
who 
are 
neurotically 
predisposed. 
At 
times 
it 
is 
age, 
in 
women, 
the 
climacteric, 
feelings 
of 
insufficiency 
of 
a 
psychic 
or 
physical 
nature, 
indications 
of 
impotency, 
a 
breaking 
up 
of 
the 
family, 
marriage 
of 
a 
son 
or 
daughter, 
as 
well 
as 
financial 
losses, 
the 
loss 
of 
a 
position 
or 
post 
of 
honor 
which 
first 
causes 
the 
breakdown. 
In 
most 
instances 
one 
may 
already 
find 
in 
the 
previous 
history 
indications 
of 
actual 
attacks 
of 
a 
neurotic 
character. 


Age 
with 
its 
losses 
has 
the 
same 
effect 
as 
other 
degradations 
of 
the 
ego-
consciousness. 
The 
aggressive 
tendency 
seeks 
other 
means 
whereby 
an 
adjustment 
may 
be 
brought 
about, 
other, 
means 
which 
unfortunately 
are 
not 
easily 
to 
be 
had 
in 
these 
cases. 
Renunciation 
would 
come 
easier, 
if 
along 
with 



the 
sinking 
of 
bodily 
and 
mental 
power 
there 
would 
also 
take 
place 
a 
narrowing 
of 
the 
emotional 
life. 
This 
seldom 
happens, 
and 
in 
order 
to 
find 
a 
substitute 
for 
the 
loss}, 
the 
aggressive 
tendency 
which 
has 
been 
stimulated 
by 
the 
insecurity 
again 
whips 
up 
all 
stimuli 
of 
desire. 
The 
universal 
decree 
frequently 
stands 
all 
too 
firm 
against 
all 
these 
endeavors. 
The 
bearing, 
the 
life, 
the 
desires, 
the 
dress, 
the 
work 
and 
accomplishments 
of 
aging 
people 
are 
subject 
to 
criticism 
in 
a 
great 
measure. 
Those 
who 
are 
predisposed 
to 
a 
neurosis 
will 
readily 
take 
this 
criticism 
as 
a 
barricade 
and 
will 
already 
shrink 
from 
those 
situations 
which 
still 
offer 
possibility 
of 
gratification. 
Such 
an 
individual 
will 
force 
himself 
into 
submission, 
will 
want 
to 
annihilate 
his 
feelings 
and 
desires, 
without 
being 
able 
to 
set 
himself 
to 
rights 
with 
them. 
Yes, 
still 
more 
intensely 
will 
these 
flare 
up 
when 
a 
renunciation 
without 
adjustment 
is 
demanded. 


Thus 
it 
happens 
that 
the 
active 
hostile 
traits 
of 
character 
develop, 
that 
envy, 
ill-will, 
avarice, 
the 
craving 
for 
dominancy, 
sadistic 
impulses 
of 
all 
sorts, 
experience 
accentuations, 
and 
never 
satisfied, 
bring 
about 
a 
restlessness 
which 
unremittingly 
strives 
for 
remedies, 
substitutions, 
securities, 
" 
Where 
you 
are 
not 
there 
is 
happiness 
" 
because 
the 
real 
position 
of 
aging 
people 
is 
seriously 
endangered 
in 
our 
state 
of 
society, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
is 
the 
productive 
value, 
which 
is 
almost 
exclusively 
the 
test 
of 
the 
worth 
of 
the 
personality. 
The 
neurotic's 
sustenance 
(Brod) 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
is 
the 
appearance 
of 
power, 
prestige, 
even 
suicide 
has 
already 
come 
within 
our 
experience 
as 
the 
last 
expression 
of 
masculine 
protest. 


The 
advent 
of 
senility 
has 
even 
a 
stronger 
effect 
upon 
women 
than 
upon 
men. 
Even 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
climacteric 
is 
usually 
phantastically 
exaggerated. 
Youth 
and 
beauty 
meant 
power 
for 
woman, 
and 
more 
so 
than 
for 
man. 
Her 
charms 
were 
able 
to 
give 
her 
dominancy, 
victories 
and 
triumphs, 
for 
which 
the 
neurotic 
greediness 
constantly 
longs. 


Age 
to 
them 
is 
like 
a 
stain. 
Besides 
their 
value 
sinks 
more 
decidedly 
than 
is 
the 
case 
with 
the 
aging 
man, 
and 
as 
far 
as 
it 
concerns 
aging 
woman, 
prevailing 
psychology 
may 
be 
designated 
point 
blank 
as 
actually 
hostile. 


This 
deplorable 
feature 
has 
its 
origin 
in 
the 
well 
known 
tendency 
of 
man 
to 
depreciate 
woman, 
coupled 
with 
the 
psychic 
defeat 
which 
they 
experience 
from 
our 
social 
life, 
a 
neurotic 
germ, 
which 
manifests 
itself, 
implacably 
and 
ineradicably 
even 
unto 
the 
grave. 
Consciously 
or 
unconsciously, 
often 



unavoidably 
from 
the 
nature 
of 
things, 
this 
derogatory 
tendency 
has 
its 
injurious 
effect 
upon 
the 
ego-consciousness 
of 
these 
aging 
women, 
who 
after 
all 
have 
a 
right 
to 
live. 
Children's 
love 
and 
respect 
for 
the 
aged 
as 
aids 
and 
guiding 
points 
of 
view 
in 
man's 
relations 
with 
his 
fellow 
men, 
furnish 
only 
the 
very 
minutest 
relief 
and 
can 
never 
suffice 
to 
gratify 
the 
stimulated 
desires 
of 
people 
whose 
powers 
are 
waning. 
It 
is 
then 
that 
the 
neurotic 
bent 
sets 
in 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
strengthening 
the 
guiding 
principle. 
"I 
am 
deprimed 
I 
had 
too 
little 
out 
of 
life 
I 
shall 
realize 
nothing 
more," 
this 
one 
regularly 
hears 
in 
the 
complaints 
of 
aging 
neurotics, 
and 
they 
accentuate 
this 
manner 
of 
viewing 
life 
to 
such 
an 
extent, 
that 
they 
suspiciously 
and 
distrustfully 
sink 
into 
a 
repulsive 
egoism, 
the 
like 
of 
which 
they 
had 
never 
before 
experienced 
so 
vividly. 
Through 
this, 
however, 
the 
vacillations 
and 
doubts 
become 
stabilized. 


" 
Act 
as 
though 
you 
were 
still 
obliged 
to 
attain 
worth," 
thus 
approximately 
rings 
a 
newly 
constructed 
guiding 
principle, 
and 
along 
with 
this 
the 
neurotic's 
sharpening 
of 
avarice 
becomes 
more 
acute, 
the 
avaricious, 
envious, 
domineering 
impulses 
come 
violently 
to 
the 
foreground, 
almost, 
however, 
restrained 
by 
the 
previously 
mentioned 
guiding 
principles 
in 
accordance 
with 
which 
these 
patients 
shrink 
with 
apprehension 
from 
every 
desire 
and 
beginning. 
Thus 
there 
lie 
unmistakably 
under 
cover, 
separated 
with 
difficulty 
from 
consciousness, 
those 
impulses 
which 
lastingly 
support 
dissatisfaction, 
impatience, 
mistrust, 
and 
uninterruptedly 
direct 
the 
attention 
to 
the 
unattained 
and 
often 
unattainable. 
In 
the 
last 
instance, 
to 
the 
success 
of 
which 
the 
marked 
adaptability 
of 
the 
sexual 
symbols 
contributes 
in 
a 
way, 
but 
furthermore 
also 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
proof 
of 
a 
lack 
of 
sexual 
gratification 
is 
readily 
to 
be 
had 
by 
every 
one, 
it 
therefore 
happens, 
that 
all 
desire 
becomes 
sexualized. 
It 
is 
readily 
understood 
that 
these 
people 
apperceive 
on 
a 
sexual 
basis. 
But 
one 
must 
avoid 
taking 
this 
sexual 
fiction, 
this, 
so 
to 
speak, 
"modus 
dicendi," 
or 
as 
I 
have 
called 
it, 
the 
sexual 
jargon, 
for 
an 
original 
experience. 
In 
the 
theoretical 
part 
I 
have 
discussed 
the 
reasons 
for 
the 
marked 
prominence 
of 
the 
sexual 
guiding 
principle 
in 
neurotics, 
first, 
because 
it, 
like 
all 
other 
guiding 
principles 
is 
considerably 
accentuated 
in 
the 
neurotic, 
and 
so 
to 
speak, 
felt 
as 
real 
instead 
of 
what 
it 
was 
intended 
for 
namely, 
as 
a 
protective 
guiding 
line 
and 
second, 
because 
it 
(the 
sexual 
guiding 
principle) 
leads 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest. 



Thus 
it 
happens 
that 
every 
desire 
of 
the 
aging 
neurotic 
woman 
may 
be 
referred 
not 
only 
by 
herself, 
but 
with 
a 
little 
effort 
by 
the 
physician 
to 
a 
sexual 
analogy. 
Likewise, 
that 
the 
physician 
may 
be 
able 
to 
fill 
the 
neurotic's 
want 
of 
a 
protective 
analogy, 
by 
means 
of 
a 
premature 
offering 
of 
a 
sexual 
guiding 
principle 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
orthodox 
Freudian 
school, 
may 
unquestionably 
be 
inferred 
from 
the 
foregoing 
considerations. 


There 
is 
no 
gain 
so 
long 
as 
one 
does 
not 
succeed 
in 
ridding 
the 
patient 
of 
his 
fiction, 
which 
becomes 
possible 
when 
he 
becomes 
more 
certain 
of 
himself, 
and 
is 
able 
to 
recognize 
his 
presumably 
libidinous 
impulse 
as 
a 
falsifying 
fiction. 


Such 
a 
fiction 
for 
instance 
is 
the 
so-called 
climacteric 
of 
the 
male, 
of 
former 
authors, 
described 
by 
Freud 
and 
Kurt 
Mendel. 
The 
climacteric 
of 
woman 
has 
its 
psychic 
effect 
irrespective 
of 
the 
metabolic 
phenomena, 
because 
of 
the 
heightening 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority. 
Concomitant 
disturbances 
of 
metabolism 
are 
only 
able 
to 
change 
or 
intensify 
the 
neurotic's 
aspect, 
the 
moment 
it 
makes 
itself 
specifically 
felt 
through 
an 
intensification 
of 
the 
insecurity. 
Basedow's 
neurosis 
in 
climacteric 
women 
) 
furnishes 
an 
example 
of 
such 
a 
mixed 
and 
intensified 
picture. 
7 
The 
neurosis 
of 
the 
climacteric 
in 
man, 
is 
likewise 
only 
indirectly-' 
influenced 
by 
atrophy 
of 
the 
genitals, 
may, 
however, 
experience 
an 
intensification 
through 
the 
aggravating 
abstraction, 
" 
I 
am 
no 
longer 
a 
man 
I 
am 
a 
woman." 
Inasmuch 
as 
the 
masculine 
guiding 
principle 
becomes 
intensified 
and 
hypostasized 
through 
carefulness 
and 
appropriate 
stimuli 
as 
a 
result 
of 
this 
ideologic 
standpoint 
those 
wonderful 
manifestations 
of 
the 
Johannistrieb 
take 
place, 
the 
frequent 
occurrence 
of 
which 
in 
women 
Karin 
Michaelis 
has 
amply 
explained 
in 
her 
" 
Dangerous 
Age." 


Only 
that 
the 
sexual 
guiding 
principle 
is 
not 
the 
exclusive 
or 
even 
most 
essential 
one 
as 
it 
is 
attempted 
to 
infer 
from 
a 
biologic 
point 
of 
view, 
but 
must 
be 
looked 
upon 
as 
a 
form 
of 
expression 
similar 
to 
other 
forms 
of 
desire 
if 
one 
is 
to 
face 
the 
facts 
squarely. 


The 
climacteric 
neurosis 
shows 
us 
accordingly 
only 
a 
different 
phase 
of 
the 
neurosis 
caused 
by 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
and 
the 
traits 
of 
character 
demonstrable 
in 
it 
resemble 
the 
hypostasizations 
already 
familiar 
to 
us. 
I 
have 
never 
seen 
a 
case 
where 
the 
neurosis 
became 
first 
manifested 
at 
the 
climacterium. 
And 
it 
is 
to 
be 
expected 
according 
to 
our 
thesis 
that 
the 
" 



climacteric 
" 
neurosis 
had 
already 
shown 
its 
face 
in 
former 
days, 
at 
times, 
in 
a 
mild 
manner, 
especially 
when 
favorable 
circumstances 
or 
cultural 
activity 
were 
able 
to 
lessen 
the 
attack 
through 
a 
partial 
gratification 
of 
the 
craving 
for 
power. 
Mostly 
one 
finds 
a 
gradually 
progressive 
intensification 
and 
spreading 
of 
the 
neurotic 
symptoms 
of 
some 
years' 
duration, 
which 
an 
antecedently 
necessitated 
intensification 
of 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
permits 
of 
detection. 
An 
example 
of 
this 
would 
be 
the 
transformation 
of 
headache 
and 
occasional 
migraine 
into 
a 
trifacial 
neuralgia. 
On 
the 
intensification 
of 
a 
neurotic 
cautiousness 
into 
anxiety 
and 
occasionally 
through 
the 
discounting 
of 
an 
anticipated 
disaster, 
into 
melancholy. 
For 
these 
three 
steps 
of 
protection 
one 
must 
consult 
the 
schema 
contained 
in 
the 
theoretical 
part. 


CAUTION: 
for 
instance, 
as 
if 
I 
may 
lose 
my 
money, 
I 
may 
be 
beneath. 


ANXIETY: 
as 
if 
I 
shall 
lose 
my 
money, 
I 
shall 
be 
beneath. 


MELANCHOLY: 
as 
if 
I 
had 
lost 
my 
money, 
as 
if 
I 
were 
beneath. 


In 
other 
words, 
the 
stronger 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
the 
more 
intensified 
the 
fiction 
becomes 
and 
the 
more 
closely 
it 
approaches 
a 
dogma, 
through 
an 
increasing 
abstraction 
from 
reality. 
And 
the 
patient 
approximates 
and 
handles 
everything 
which 
brings 
him 
nearer 
to 
his 
guiding 
principle. 
Reality 
is 
along 
with 
this 
depreciated 
in 
various 
degrees, 
and 
the 
corrective 
routes 
become 
more 
and 
more 
inadequate. 


One 
not 
infrequently 
sees 
cases 
in 
which 
there 
come 
to 
light 
neurotic 
phenomena 
in 
the 
pathogenic 
periods 
already 
known 
to 
us 
something 
on 
the 
order 
of 
an 
experiment. 
Kisch 
and 
others 
have 
called 
attention 
to 
this 
anamnestic 
data 
of 
neurotic 
complaints 
formed 
at 
the 
onset 
of 
puberty. 
More 
frequently 
one 
finds 
in 
the 
anamnesis 
neurotic 
molimina 
menstrualia, 
or 
neuroses 
before 
entering 
the 
marriage 
state, 
in 
the 
puerperium, 
or 
even 
continuously. 


After 
these 
considerations, 
we 
shall 
have 
to 
let 
the 
various 
guiding 
principles 
described 
by 
us 
coordinate 
themselves 
with 
the 
prime 
guiding 
principle. 
The 
neurosis 
of 
aged 
people 
is 
only 
a 
different 
phase, 
an 
adaptive 
psychic 
superstructure 
built 
up 
upon 
the 
one 
elementary 
directive 
principle 
I 
wish 
to 
be 
a 
man. 
And 
this 
directive 
principle, 
which 
has 
been 
outrightly 
condemned 
to 
destruction, 
avails 
itself 
of 
all 
manner 
of 
disguise, 
without 
ever 
finding 
a 
satisfactory 
one. 
Frequently 
the 
impression 
they 
make 
is 
one 
of 
great 
helplessness 
of 
resignation, 
as 
though 
the 
patient 
wanted 
to 
say 
he 
knew 



not 
how 
to 
go 
about 
the 
thing. 
In 
all 
their 
plans 
doubt 
is 
prominent 
vacillation 
never 
leaves 
them, 
along 
with 
this, 
however, 
one 
sees 
exaggerated 
explanations 
as 
if 
the 
patients 
wished 
to 
convince 
themselves 
that 
they 
are 
too 
old, 
or 
that 
they 
are 
still 
young. 
The 
tendency 
is 
toward 
the 
gaining 
of 
power, 
influence, 
worth. 
But 
the 
feeling, 
that 
they 
want 
the 
unattainable, 
never 
leaves 
them. 
In 
the 
dreams 
one 
regularly 
finds 
the 
endeavor 
to 
assist 
the 
masculine 
protest 
towards 
expression, 
to 
be 
young, 
to 
obtain 
sexual 
gratification, 
to 
show 
itself 
in 
a 
nude 
state, 
always, 
however, 
albeit 
at 
times 
well 
masked, 
the 
desire 
to 
be 
a 
man. 
Also 
the 
traits 
of 
character, 
the 
secondary 
guiding 
principles, 
show 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
craving 
for 
security. 


Pedantry, 
avarice, 
envy, 
craving 
for 
dominancy, 
and 
the 
desire 
to 
be 
popular, 
manifest 
themselves 
often 
in 
this 
disguised 
manner. 
Anxiety 
is 
frequently 
found, 
it 
seems, 
as 
proof 
that 
they 
cannot 
be 
alone. 
And 
in 
consummation, 
the 
neurotic 
symptoms 
force 
the 
entire 
household 
under 
the 
regime 
of 
the 
patient. 
Often 
the 
attempt 
is 
made 
in 
a 
more 
or 
less 
timorous 
concealed 
manner 
to 
realize 
a 
certain 
wish, 
as 
though 
in 
that 
event 
the 
masculine 
protest 
were 
assured. 


Frequently 
this 
wish 
manifests 
itself 
in 
a 
desire 
for 
divorce. 
or 
to 
move 
to 
a 
large 
city, 
or 
to 
humiliate 
the 
sons-in-law 
or 
the 
daughters-in-law 
as 
if 
tranquillity 
might 
be 
hoped 
for 
in 
that 
event. 


Difficulties 
in 
taking 
food, 
or 
in 
emptying 
the 
bowels, 
or 
fragmentary 
manifestations 
of 
imaginary 
pregnancies 
and 
childbirths 
are 
not 
rare. 
Along 
with 
this 
they 
bring 
into 
use 
forgetfulness, 
tremulousness, 
here 
and 
there 
an 
occasional 
traumatic 
incident, 
all 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
bringing 
to 
the 
attention 
of 
themselves 
and 
others 
their 
growing 
helplessness. 


Complaints 
constantly 
recur, 
every 
unpleasant 
incident 
serves 
a 
special 
significance, 
and 
their 
thoughts 
are 
constantly 
directed 
toward 
an 
approaching 
evil. 
The 
demonstrative 
emphasizing 
of 
their 
suffering 
and 
their 
hesitating 
attitude 
serve 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
to 
throttle 
their 
social 
circle, 
while 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
it 
is 
useful 
for 
the 
initiation 
of 
their 
withdrawal 
from 
society 
in 
the 
event 
of 
a 
painful 
anticipation 
of 
a 
setback. 
Psychologically 
this 
complaint 
may 
also 
be 
looked 
upon 
as 
a 
form 
of 
the 
revolt, 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest 
against 
a 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
it 
is 
intended 
to 
soften 
and 
weaken 
those 
about 
them. 


Treatment 
meets 
with 
considerable 
difficulties, 
inasmuch 
as 
the 



attainment 
of 
independence 
is 
much 
more 
difficult 
in 
advanced 
age, 
and 
promising 
predictions 
cannot 
be 
so 
plausibly 
made. 
As 
always 
is 
the 
case, 
the 
personality 
of 
the 
psychotherapeutist 
as 
well 
as 
any 
actual 
or 
possible 
successes 
of 
his 
are 
utilized 
to 
spur 
on 
envy, 
and 
thus 
it 
frequently 
happens 
that 
improvements 
serve 
to 
give 
rise 
to 
relapses. 
Then, 
too, 
the 
readily 
attainable 
authority 
over 
them 
serves 
to 
disturb 
the 
equilibrium 
of 
these 
patients, 
inasmuch 
as 
never 
in 
their 
life 
were 
they 
able 
to 
adjust 
themselves 
readily 
or 
what 
is 
more, 
subordinate 
themselves. 
As 
a 
last 
refuge 
in 
severe 
cases, 
the 
self-sacrifice 
of 
the 
physician 
following 
a 
thorough 
analysis 
recommends 
itself, 
so 
that 
one 
is 
obliged 
to 
own 
up 
to 
an 
apparent 
failure 
of 
his 
part 
of 
the 
treatment, 
and 
offer 
the 
laurels 
to 
some 
other 
therapeutic 
method. 
In 
two 
of 
my 
cases, 
this 
expedient 
justified 
itself:-in 
the 
one 
case 
the 
patient, 
a 
female, 
was 
cured 
through 
the 
medium 
/ 
of 
correspondence 
by 
a 
Bosnian 
country 
physician; 
in 
the 
other, 
a 
case 
of 
trifacial 
neuralgia 
of 
long 
standing 
which 
I 
had 
been 
treating 
for 
two 
years 
with 
varying 
success, 
recovered 
following 
I 
suggestions 
given 
against 
me 
in 
the 
wakeful 
state. 
In 
most 
of 
these 
cases, 
considerable 
improvement, 
remissions, 
or 
even 
complete 
recoveries 
set 
in 
of 
their 
own 
accord 
following 
the 
termination 
of 
the 
treatment. 


One 
of 
my 
patients, 
a 
fifty-six-year-old 
lady, 
had 
been 
suffering 
for 
eighteen 
years 
from 
anxiety 
states, 
dizziness, 
nausea, 
abdominal 
pains 
and 
severe 
obstipation. 
A 
considerable 
portion 
of 
this 
period 
was 
spent 
either 
in 
bed 
or 
lying 
on 
a 
sofa, 
especially 
during 
the 
last 
eight 
years, 
when 
severe 
pains 
in 
the 
back 
and 
limbs 
added 
to 
her 
complaints. 
The 
patient 
had 
been 
previously 
a 
robust 
woman, 
but 
at 
the 
age 
of 
eighteen 
had 
apparently 
suffered 
for 
months 
from 
joint 
rheumatism. 


Her 
present 
condition 
appeared 
to 
be 
psychogenetic 
in 
nature, 
inasmuch 
as 
there 
was 
an 
absence 
of 
corresponding 
organic 
changes, 
and 
the 
protective 
traits 
of 
character* 
discovered 
by 
me 
were 
easily 
demonstrable. 
(The 
differential-diagnostic 
significance 
of 
these 
is 
beyond 
doubt. 
Only 
one 
must 
regularly 
take 
into 
account 
the 
simultaneous 
existence 
of 
an 
organic 
affection.) 


The 
advice 
of 
a 
Hysterectomy 
by 
a 
prominent 
gynecologist 
because 
of 
some 
perimetritic 
adhesions 
I 
did 
not 
take 
into 
account 
since 
I 
have 
learned 
to 
understand 
from 
other 
cases, 
the 
etiologic 
significance 
of 
such 
maiming 



procedures 
in 
the 
neuroses 
influencing 
as 
they 
do 
the 
psyche 
indirectly. 


Changes, 
manifestations 
of 
arrests 
of 
development, 
deformities 
and 
disease 
of 
the 
genitals 
are 
frequently 
found 
in 
neurotics. 
A. 
Bossi 
certainly 
is 
correct 
in 
emphasizing 
this 
relationship 
as 
I 
had 
already 
done 
before 
in 
my 
" 
Studie 
(1907). 
This 
relationship, 
however, 
lies 
either 
in 
the 
adjustment 
of 
a 
special 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
which 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
neurotic 
predisposition 
gives 
occasion 
for 
the 
development 
of 
a 
neurosis 
or 
because 
the 
neurosis, 
developed 
as 
result 
of 
other 
causes, 
requires 
a 
protective 
allusion 
to 
an 
organic 
change, 
in 
order 
to 
start 
upon 
the 
road 
the 
fixed 
goal 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest. 


Sexual 
inferiority 
becomes, 
so 
to 
speak, 
the 
vehicle 
which 
especially 
forces 
itself 
upon 
one's 
attention 
when 
slight 
changes 
or 
even 
wholly 
imagined 
fictitious 
ones 
such 
as 
a 
supposed 
loss 
of 
the 
clitoris, 
enlargement 
of 
the 
labia-majora, 
moistening 
of 
the 
apertures, 
telling 
evidences 
of 
masturbation 
or 
anomalies 
of 
the 
hairy 
growth, 
phimoses, 
paraurethral 
passages 
and 
asymmetric 
posture 
of 
the 
penis 
or 
testicles, 
or 
cryptorchism 
are 
taken 
as 
an 
occasion 
for 
a 
symbol 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority. 


This 
patient's 
disease 
began 
during 
a 
game 
of 
tennis. 
One 
year 
before 
this 
one 
of 
her 
daughters 
died, 
and 
her 
husband, 
a 
great 
lover 
of 
children, 
wished 
to 
have 
more 
children. 
The 
patient 
who 
from 
her 
earliest 
childhood 
had 
bewailed 
her 
lot, 
and 
wished 
to 
be 
a 
man, 
was 
not 
at 
all 
inclined 
to 
gratify 
this 
wish 
of 
her 
husband. 
The 
pain 
which 
was 
probably 
caused 
by 
a 
twist 
gave 
her 
new 
food 
for 
this 
indistinctly 
conscious 
resistance, 
since 
that 
time 
she 
could 
not 
stand 
any 
pressure 
on 
the 
abdomen, 
her 
abdomen 
became 
for 
her 
a 
dainty 
part 
and 
by 
means 
of 
a 
further 
bringing 
into 
use 
of 
insomnia 
and 
nausea, 
the 
latter 
as 
a 
memento 
of 
pregnancy, 
she 
brought 
matters 
to 
a 
point 
where 
the 
husband, 
upon 
the 
advice 
of 
physicians, 
abandoned 
sexual 
concourse 
with 
her, 
and 
used 
a 
separate 
bedroom. 


Already 
her 
recital 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
rheumatism 
was 
characteristic. 
She 
blamed 
her 
dead 
mother 
for 
everything. 
The 
latter, 
she 
complained, 
forced 
her 
to 
wash 
and 
iron 
in 
the 
paternal 
home, 
always 
slighted 
her 
before 
the 
other 
sisters, 
and 
even 
in 
later 
years 
she 
was 
treated 
in 
the 
same 
hardhearted 
manner. 
This 
woman's 
greediness 
brought 
her 
into 
some 
difficulties. 
But 
her 
troubles, 
however, 
she 
attributed 
to 
her 
father, 
so 
that 
the 
latter 
also 
received 
his 
share 
of 
the 
blame. 



Such 
reproaches 
against 
the 
parents 
regularly 
draw 
attention 
according 
to 
my 
experience 
to 
another 
kind 
of 
reproach 
which 
the 
child 
is 
secretly 
making 
against 
the 
parents, 
when 
it 
finds 
itself 
incomplete, 
or 
what's 
more, 
unmanly. 
Such 
reproaches 
become 
abstract 
later 
on, 
as 
I 
have 
shown 
it 
to 
be 
likewise 
true 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
guilt, 
and 
in 
later 
life 
serve 
the 
purpose, 
so 
to 
speak, 
of 
shells 
to 
be 
filled 
up 
with 
different 
content. 
Thus 
it 
later 
on 
sounds 
as 
if 
the 
parents 
were 
not 
affectionate 
enough, 
or 
that 
they 
pampered 
the 
child, 
or 
that 
especially 
during 
the 
masturbation 
period 
they 
did 
not 
supervise 
him 
sufficiently. 
In 
short, 
we 
observe 
in 
these 
formulations 
of 
an 
attitude 
towards 
the 
parents 
and 
later 
on 
towards 
the 
world, 
formal 
changes 
such 
as 
are 
in 
line 
with 
guiding 
principles 
which 
are 
to 
serve 
a 
practical 
purpose, 
and 
we 
frequently 
see 
a 
different 
guise 
cut 
according 
to 
the 
pattern 
of 
the 
actual 
situation. 
It 
is 
then 
necessary 
to 
retrace 
the 
steps 
covered 
by 
the 
formal 
change. 
Here 
the 
analytical 
method 
makes 
use 
of 
the 
medium 
of 
reduction, 
of 
simplification 
(Nietzsche) 
of 
abstraction. 
Along 
with 
the 
formal 
change 
accentuations 
or 
attenuations 
of 
the 
guiding 
fiction 
play 
an 
important 
role. 
The 
more 
insecure 
the 
patient 
feels 
himself, 
the 
more 
he 
is 
driven 
by 
an 
unconscious 
tendency 
towards 
an 
intensification 
of 
his 
guiding 
principle, 
to 
make 
himself 
dependent 
upon 
it. 
I 
readily 
follow 
here 
the 
worthy 
views 
of 
Vaihinger, 
who 
maintains 
for 
the 
history 
of 
ideas, 
that 
historically 
considered 
they 
show 
a 
tendency 
to 
grow 
from 
a 
fiction 
(an 
unreal 
but 
practically 
useful 
safety-device) 
to 
hypotheses 
and 
later 
to 
dogmas. 
This 
change 
of 
intensity 
characterizes 
in 
a 
general 
way 
individual 
psychology, 
the 
thinking 
of 
the 
normal 
individual 
(fiction 
as 
an 
expedient) 
of 
the 
neurotic 
(attempt 
to 
realize 
the 
fiction) 
and 
of 
the 
insane 
(incomplete 
but 
protective 
anthropomorphism 
and 
realization 
of 
the 
fiction: 
dogmatization). 


The 
stronger 
inner 
need 
seeks 
adjustment 
through 
an 
intensification 
of 
the 
assuring 
guiding 
principles. 
We 
shall 
therefore 
regularly 
find 
equivalents 
of 
the 
neurotics' 
and 
psychotics' 
guiding 
principles 
and 
characteristics 
in 
the 
normal 
individual, 
which 
in 
the 
latter 
may 
become 
corrected 
in 
order 
that 
they 
may 
be 
able 
to 
approach 
reality 
without 
contradiction. 
If 
we 
were 
to 
reduce 
the 
manifest 
guiding 
principles 
of 
this 
patient, 
and 
free 
them 
of 
the 
various 
changes 
of 
form 
and 
intensity 
which 
they 
have 
undergone, 
so 
that 
we 
may 
take 
them 
in 
the 
original, 
not 
in 
the 
form 
developed 
later 
on, 
it 
would 
read, 
" 
I 
am 
a 
woman 
and 
want 
to 
be 
a 
man." 
The 
normal 
individual, 
too, 



adjusts 
himself 
throughout 
life 
in 
accordance 
with 
this 
formula. 
It 
aids 
him 
in 
attaching 
himself 
to 
our 
masculine 
culture, 
yes, 
it 
furnishes 
the 
latter 
with 
a 
steady 
impetus 
towards 
masculization 
(Vermannlichung). 
But 
here 
it 
plays 
a 
role 
similar 
to 
the 
Hilfslinie 
in 
a 
geometric 
construction. 
So 
soon 
as 
the 
object, 
a 
higher 
manly 
niveau 
is 
attained, 
it 
is 
lost 
from 
consideration 
(Vaihinger). 
Concerning 
the 
myth, 
a 
guiding 
principle 
of 
the 
race, 
Nietzsche 
laments 
its 
transformation 
into 
the 
fairy 
tale 
and 
demands 
a 
transformation 
into 
the 
manly 
(Mannliche). 
The 
neurotic 
emphasizes 
this 
fiction, 
takes 
it 
altogether 
too 
literally, 
and 
endeavors 
to 
bring 
about 
its 
realization. 


His 
object 
is 
not 
the 
dovetailing, 
the 
adjustment 
of 
his 
masculine 
prestige, 
but 
to 
give 
it 
value, 
which 
is 
mostly 
unattainable 
in 
its 
overstrained 
form 
or 
because 
of 
intrinsic 
contradictions 
in 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
or 
is 
hindered 
in 
its 
attainment 
because 
of 
the 
fear 
of 
a 
threatening 
defeat, 
the 
patient 
still 
remaining 
ignorant 
of 
the 
significance 
and 
scope 
of 
his 
largely 
unconscious? 
fiction. 
But 
his 
more 
intense 
feeling 
of 
uncertainty 
and 
inferiority 
also 
hinders 
him 
in 
the 
proper 
estimation 
of 
his 
fiction. 
The 
insane 
man 
conducts 
himself 
as 
if 
his 
fiction 
were 
a 
reality. 
He 
acts 
under 
the 
most 
intense 
urgency 
and 
delivers 
himself 
unto 
his 
self-created 
deity, 
which 
he 
apperceives 
as 
real. 
In 
a 
similar 
manner 
he 
simultaneously 
feels 
himself 
to 
be 
woman 
and 
superman, 
the 
latter 
as 
a 
reaction 
of 
the 
exaggerated 
masculine 
protest. 
The 
splitting 
of 
the 
personality 
corresponds 
to 
the 
psychic 
hermaphroditism, 
the 
formal 
change 
being 
a 
manifold 
one, 
manifests 
itself 
for 
the 
instant 
in 
the 
combination 
of 
ideas 
of 
persecution 
and 
grandeur, 
of 
depression 
and 
mania, 
whereas 
fixation 
as 
self 
-protection, 
is 
made 
facile 
through 
a 
relative 
insufficiency 
or 
absolute 
weakness 
of 
the 
corrective 
paths. 
If 
one 
were 
to 
remove 
from 
Freud's 
equation 
of 
dementia 
("Yearbook," 
Bleuler-Freud, 
1911) 
the 
introduced 
sexualization, 
if 
one 
were 
to 
shorten 
it 
on 
both 
sides 
of 
the 
superfluous 
libido 
factor, 
our 
much 
more 
profound 
formula 
of 
the 
psychic 
hermaphroditism 
with 
the 
masculine 
protest 
comes 
to 
the 
surface, 
against 
which, 
missing 
entirely 
its 
true 
significance, 
Freud 
argues 
in 
his 
work. 


To 
come 
back 
to 
the 
case 
history, 
it 
still 
remains 
to 
be 
mentioned 
that 
our 
patient 
in 
her 
feeling 
of 
insufficiency 
brought 
forth 
various 
forms 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
Thus 
she 
was 
unable 
to 
bring 
herself 
to 
remain 
tolerant 
of 
men's 
accomplishments. 
In 
this 
regard, 
she 
could 
be 
quite 
critical, 
especially 
when 
some 
one 
tried 
to 
overestimate 
himself. 
In 
these 
cases 
it 
not 



infrequently 
happens 
that 
physicians 
with 
a 
self-confident 
demeanor, 
which 
appears 
to 
be 
an 
essential 
to 
some 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
disease, 
are 
antagonized 
by 
the 
patient 
with 
neurotic 
impetuousness 
and 
with 
the 
same 
means. 
In 
this 
case, 
she 
was, 
aside 
from 
this, 
naturally 
guided 
by 
a 
sort 
of 
instinct 
which 
forbade 
her 
to 
adopt 
the 
physician's 
instructions, 
out 
of 
respect 
to 
the 
purpose 
of 
her 
disease. 
But 
at 
times 
matters 
reached 
a 
point 
where 
a 
harmless 
gain 
of 
influence 
over 
her 
by 
the 
physician 
was 
responded 
to 
by 
vomiting 
and 
nausea, 
in 
connection 
with 
which 
the 
patient 
never 
missed 
a 
chance 
to 
call 
attention 
to 
the 
unsuccessful 
effort 
of 
the 
physician. 
One 
need 
not 
lose 
one's 
tranquillity 
on 
account 
of 
this 
sort 
of 
manifestation, 
one 
must 
rather 
see 
in 
them 
a 
part 
of 
the 
entire 
whole, 
a 
formal 
change 
of 
the 
original 
envy 
of 
man 
and 
later 
of 
every 
one 
believed 
to 
be 
superior. 


Along 
with 
this 
our 
patient 
made 
extensive 
use 
of 
certain 
privileges 
given 
her 
by 
her 
illness. 
First 
of 
all 
she 
was 
able 
to 
withdraw 
herself 
as 
much 
as 
she 
wished 
to 
from 
the 
social 
duties 
imposed 
upon 
her 
by 
the 
role 
of 
housewife 
and 
important 
personage 
of 
a 
provincial 
city. 


'Tis 
true 
she 
received 
visitors, 
to 
whom 
she 
complained 
of 
her 
sufferings, 
but 
only 
exceptionally 
returned 
a 
call, 
thus 
assuring 
herself 
as 
is 
the 
case 
regularly 
with 
neurotics, 
of 
a 
favored 
and 
privileged 
position. 
Along 
with 
this 
it 
was 
possible 
to 
avoid 
comparisons 
and 
musterings, 
in 
one 
sense 
also 
trials, 
occasions 
for 
which 
social 
activities 
furnish 
as 
a 
rule. 
Of 
late 
years 
she 
has 
besides 
been 
frightened 
by 
the 
idea 
that 
she 
was 
being 
robbed 
as 
a 
result 
of 
her 
growing 
age, 
of 
the 
possibilities 
of 
wielding 
influence 
over 
men. 
A 
lady 
friend 
demonstrated 
to 
her 
very 
intimately 
how 
ridiculously 
society 
looks 
upon 
youthful 
conduct 
in 
an 
aging 
woman. 
Thus 
she 
decided 
by 
her 
way 
of 
dressing 
to 
lay 
special 
emphasis 
on 
her 
age, 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
bitter 
thought 
crowded 
itself 
to 
the 
surface 
of 
her 
consciousness 
that 
men 
of 
her 
age 
are 
by 
no 
means 
pushed 
into 
the 
corner. 
. 


At 
all 
times 
she 
felt 
bitterly 
the 
fact 
that 
she 
had 
to 
spend 
her 
life 
in 
a 
provincial 
city. 
Instinctively 
she 
strove 
in 
many, 
ways 
for 
a 
removal 
to 
Vienna. 
However, 
this 
was 
not 
to 
be 
attained 
in 
an 
open 
battle 
with 
her 
husband, 
who 
was 
many 
years 
her 
senior, 
because 
he 
disarmed 
her 
with 
his 
inexhaustible 
affection 
and 
his 
compliance 
in 
all 
other 
matters. 
She 
quarrelled 
most 
bitterly 
with 
her 
brother 
and 
affected 
an 
unbelievable 
anxiety 
at 
meeting 
this 
brother 
in 
this 
small 
town. 
When 
this 
did 
not 
suffice 
to 
bring 
about 
her 



object, 
she 
developed 
a 
most 
obstinate 
insomnia, 
as 
the 
most 
important 
cause 
of 
which 
she 
blamed 
the 
nightly 
rattling 
of 
wagons 
before 
the 
windows 
of 
her 
bedroom. 
Thus 
she 
brought 
about 
a 
temporary 
removal 
to 
Vienna, 
acquired 
a 
home 
in 
the 
neighbourhood 
of 
her 
daughter, 
the 
heavenly 
peacefulness 
of 
which 
she 
constantly 
emphasized, 
and 
where 
she 
likewise 
regained 
her 
sleep. 


Ever 
since 
her 
daughter 
had 
lived 
in 
Vienna, 
the 
small 
provincial 
city 
had 
become 
progressively 
more 
obnoxious 
to 
her. 
The 
analysis 
revealed 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
other 
directive 
principles 
that 
she 
intensely 
envied 
her 
daughter's 
prestige 
with 
which 
there 
was 
also 
associated 
an 
aristocratic 
predicate. 


She, 
too, 
wanted 
to 
live 
in 
Vienna, 
and 
would 
have 
brought 
this 
about 
long 
ago, 
had 
not 
a 
new 
danger 
threatened 
her 
in 
Vienna, 
namely, 
to 
have 
to 
cover 
her 
daughter's 
expenses 
with 
her 
own 
means. 


The 
rivalry 
with 
this 
Viennese 
daughter 
was 
wholly 
contained 
in 
her 
unconscious, 
and 
corresponded 
with 
an 
infantile 
guiding 
line, 
the 
wish 
to 
surpass 
her 
pampered 
older 
sister. 
This 
guiding 
principle, 
too, 
was 
found 
to 
be 
an 
equivalent 
of 
the 
basic 
one, 
which 
strove 
toward 
the 
attainment 
of 
greater 
worth, 
as 
if 
she 
were 
a 
man. 


On 
account 
of 
the 
heavy 
expenditures 
which 
her 
residence 
in 
Vienna 
imposed 
upon 
her 
there 
arose 
a 
contradiction 
in 
her 
masculine 
protest. 
The 
neurotic 
with 
his 
torturing 
feeling 
of 
inadequacy 
does 
not 
allow 
anything 
to 
be 
taken 
from 
him 
without 
suffering 
for 
it. 


He 
apprehends 
a 
further 
belittling 
(Verkurzung) 
as 
a 
lowering 
of 
his 
ego-
consciousness 
and 
along 
with 
his 
guiding 
principle 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
if 
this 
were 
a 
castration, 
an 
effeminization, 
a 
sexual 
assault 
at 
times 
also 
in 
the 
image 
of 
a 
pregnancy 
or 
birth.* 


* 
Thus 
it 
is 
that 
the 
thought 
process 
takes 
place 
not 
along 
reality, 
but 
depends 
on 
analogous 
symbols, 
whose 
falsifying 
affective 
accompaniment 
heightens 
the 
aggressive 
preparedness 
of 
the 
neurotic. 
The 
latter, 
however, 
corresponds 
to 
the 
unconscious, 
guiding 
"opinion." 
This 
disguise, 
the 
symbol, 
the 
analogy 
are 
as 
a 
device 
in 
the 
service 
of 
the 
aggressiveness 
to 
which 
the 
ego-ideal 
of 
the 
neurotic 
compels. 
The 
woman 
as 
a 
Sphinx, 
the 
man 
as 
a 
murderer, 
etc. 
means, 
but 
may, 
however, 
attribute 
a 
pleasure-quality 
to 
rectal 
sensations 
for 
years, 
up 
to 
the 
curing 
of 
his 
obstinacy. 



In 
our 
case 
the 
analogous 
sensations 
of 
pregnancy 
came 
especially 
to 
the 
surface, 
nausea, 
abdominal 
cramps 
and 
fixed 
ideas 
of 
an 
existing 
pregnancy 
made 
themselves 
felt, 
pains 
in 
the 
limbs 
represented 
a 
phlegmasia 
alba 
dolens, 
whereas 
an 
obstinate 
obstipation 
symbolized 
in 
part 
a 
vaginismus 
in 
the 
anal 
language, 
in 
part 
attempting 
to 
prevent 
expenditures 
symbolically, 
and 
thirdly 
attempted 
to 
express 
the 
impossibility 
of 
an 
independent 
conduct. 


A 
more 
profound 
understanding 
of 
the 
mode 
of 
expression 
of 
the 
neurosis 
appears 
to 
me 
to 
be 
impossible 
without 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
"organ-jargon" 
discovered 
by 
me. 
Folklore 
takes 
cognizance 
of 
this 
in 
the 
expression 
of 
popular 
speech 
and 
custom. 
Freud 
misunderstood 
this 
jargon, 
and 
has 
created 
out 
of 
its 
constructions 
the 
mainstay 
of 
his 
libido-theory, 
namely 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
erogenous 
zones. 
Especially 
his 
work 
on 
the 
anal 
character 
and 
analerotic 
is 
full 
of 
a 
strained 
and 
overworked 
phantasy. 
The 
point 
of 
outset 
is 
the 
relative 
inferiority 
of 
certain 
organs, 
the 
attitude 
of 
the 
environment 
towards 
the 
manifestations 
of 
these 
organs 
as 
well 
as 
the 
mass 
impressions 
of 
the 
two 
upon 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
child. 
Neurotically 
predisposed 
children 
will 
endeavour 
to 
associate 
with 
suitable 
manifestations 
of 
their 
organ-inferiority 
especially 
with 
defects 
of 
childhood, 
those 
traits 
of 
character 
which 
have 
their 
origin 
in 
their 
protesting 
ego-consciousness, 
such 
as 
obstinacy, 
greater 
need 
of 
affection, 
exaggerated 
cleanliness, 
pedantry, 
anxiousness, 
ambition, 
envy, 
revengefulness, 
etc., 
in 
order 
to 
gain 
an 
especially 
effective 
representation. 
One 
of 
my 
psychogenic 
epileptics 
utilized 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
strengthening 
his 
masculine 
protest 
such 
a 
device, 
an 
interlacing, 
so 
to 
speak, 
inasmuch 
as 
he 
managed 
to 
have 
most 
of 
his 
attacks 
preceded 
by 
an 
attack 
of 
obstipation 
in 
order 
to 
arouse 
anxious 
forebodings 
in 
his 
relatives 
and 
thus 
bring 
himself 
to 
their 
notice 
in 
the 
event 
of 
a 
degradation. 


Obstinacy 
and 
infantile 
negativism 
may 
already 
be 
well 
developed 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
the 
nursing 
period. 
It 
is 
the 
association 
of 
these 
anomalies 
of 
urination, 
defecation, 
and 
eating, 
which 
gives 
rise 
to 
the 
heightened 
"reasoning." 
The 
child 
who 
abstains 
from 
emptying 
his 
bowels 
derives 
his 
pleasurable 
sensations 
not 
from 
an 
irritation 
of 
the 
rectum, 
but 
from 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
his 
obstinacy 
which 
avails 
itself 
of 
this 
unaesthetic 


The 
mother 
of 
a 
nearly 
two-year-old 
girl 
who 
was 
still 
suffering 
from 
bed-wetting 
told 
me 
that 
she 
had 
frequently 
observed 
that 
when-awakened 



from 
her 
sleep 
her 
child 
would 
attend 
properly 
to 
the 
emptying 
of 
the 
bladder, 
providing 
she 
was 
still 
in 
a 
half-wakeful 
state 
only, 
but 
no 
sooner 
did 
she 
become 
fully 
awake 
than 
she 
refused 
to 
do 
so. 
If 
the 
child 
became 
fully 
awake 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
the 
urination, 
she 
upset 
the 
urinal 
and 
cried 
a 
long 
time 
out 
of 
rage 
at 
being 
thus 
taken 
unawares; 
if, 
on 
the* 
other 
hand, 
she 
still 
continued 
half 
asleep 
she 
turned 
over 
and 
went 
fast 
asleep. 
Thus 
we 
may 
find 
in 
every 
case 
that 
from 
the 
very 
earliest 
period 
of 
existence 
the 
ego-
consciousness 
of 
the 
child 
finds 
itself 
in 
a 
manifest 
and 
latent 
contrast 
with 
its 
environment, 
that 
it 
assumes 
a 
most 
pronounced 
attitude 
of 
hostility 
and 
belligerency 
until 
it 
finally 
brings 
about 
a 
uniform 
termination 
of 
all 
these 
aggressive 
stimuli, 
until 
it 
constructs 
these 
into 
the 
masculine 
protest 
which 
it 
brings 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
stimuli 
of 
tenderness, 
subordinacy, 
and 
weakness, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
the 
manifestations 
of 
inferiority, 
all 
of 
which 
it 
collectively 
apperceives 
and 
combats 
as 
symptoms 
of 
femininity. 
Only 
that 
at 
times 
an 
interlacing 
and 
intertwining 
takes 
place, 
where 
the 
masculine 
protest 
lays 
stress 
upon 
feminine 
symptoms 
in 
order 
to 
utilize 
them 
as 
a 
bugbear, 
or 
where 
he 
obstinately 
retains 
feminine 
symptoms 
and 
this 
makes 
possible 
the 
development 
of 
hermaphrodistic 
constructions 
which 
likewise 
exert 
their 
influence 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
For 
example, 
tears, 
indispositions, 
simulations 
and 
exaggerations 
of 
childhood 
defects. 
The 
over-
accentuated 
guiding 
principle, 
namely, 
"I 
wish 
to 
be 
a 
man," 
enlists 
then 
within 
its 
ranks 
all 
utilizable 
bodily 
symptoms, 
particularly 
those 
manifestations 
of 
inferiority 
upon 
which 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
patient 
as 
well 
as 
that 
of 
the 
environment 
is 
especially 
directed. 


Thus 
it 
happens 
that 
the 
masculine 
protest 
makes 
use 
of 
a 
somatic 
language 
"for 
the 
purpose 
of 
gaining 
expression. 
A 
beautiful 
example, 
one 
which 
frequently 
recurs 
in 
neurotic 
phantasies, 
is 
that 
of 
Leonardo 
da 
Vinci's 
childhood 
phantasy: 
"A 
vulture 
repeatedly 
shoved 
its 
tail 
into 
his 
mouth." 
This 
phantasy 
carries 
the 
artist's 
psychic 
constellation 
to 
a 
most 
accurate 
abstraction. 
Mouth 
phantasies 
are 
regularly 
related 
to 
manifestations 
of 
inferiority 
in 
the 
child's 
gastro-intestinal 
tract. 
Leonardo's 
inclinations 
to 
a 
science 
of 
nutrition 
were 
most 
likely 
the 
fruits 
of 
the 
attention 
directed 
to 
these 
channels. 


The 
tail 
of 
the 
vulture 
is 
a 
phallic 
symbol. 
A 
summing 
up 
of 
these 
two 
trends 
brings 
forth 
the 
characteristic 
basic 
idea, 
"I 
will 
experience 
the 
lot 
of 



the 
woman." 
But 
this 
rigid 
adherence 
to 
a 
symbolic 
guiding 
principle 
already 
draws 
our 
attention 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
these 
and 
similar 
trends 
of 
thought 
do 
not 
signify 
a 
psychic 
settlement 
but 
serve, 
under 
the 
pressure 
of 
our 
masculine 
culture, 
for 
a 
heightened 
impetus 
in 
the 
opposite 
direction, 
must 
lead 
to 
an 
over 
compensation 
toward 
the 
masculine 
side, 
where 
they 
evolve 
the 
masculine 
guiding 
principle 
the 
more 
distinctly, 
" 
therefore 
I 
must 
act 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
as 
if 
I 
were 
a 
complete 
man." 


That 
these 
two 
guiding 
principles 
contradict 
one 
another, 
aside 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
each 
individually 
is 
a 
contradiction 
to 
reality, 
in. 
so 
far 
as 
they 
are 
taken 
literally 
and 
not 
as 
something 
useful 
and 
corrigible, 
I 
have 
already 
set 
forth 
in 
my 
contribution 
on 
the 
" 
Psychic 
hermaphroditism 
in 
life 
and 
in 
the 
neurosis 
" 
(" 
Fortschritte 
der 
Medizin," 
Leipzig, 
1908). 


This 
contradiction 
is 
reflected 
in 
doubt, 
in 
indecision, 
and 
in 
fear 
of 
making 
decisions, 
the 
analysis 
of 
which 
reveals 
more 
or 
less 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
existed 
in 
early 
childhood 
an 
uncertainty 
as 
to 
the 
future 
sexual 
role, 
in 
the 
psychic 
superstructure 
of 
which 
all 
later 
sensations, 
feelings 
and 
stimuli 
were 
grouped 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
as 
doubtful, 
" 
I 
don't 
know 
whether 
I 
am 
a 
man 
or 
a 
woman 
" 
(see 
" 
Predispositions 
to 
Neurosis," 
Year 
Book, 
Bleuler-
Freud, 
1909). 


Our 
patient 
expressed 
in 
the 
anal 
language 
that 
she 
had 
closed 
up 
an 
opening. 
A 
distinctly 
feminine 
thought. 
One 
may 
picture 
to 
himself 
a 
group 
of 
men 
and 
women 
dressed 
in 
women's 
clothes 
gathered 
in 
a 
room 
into 
which 
a 
mouse 
was 
suddenly 
let 
loose. 
The 
women 
will 
at 
once 
betray 
their 
sex 
in 
that 
they 
will 
draw 
their 
clothes 
around 
their 
legs, 
as 
if 
they 
tried 
to 
prevent 
the 
mouse 
from 
entering. 
In 
the 
same 
manner, 
the 
feminine 
frightening 
guiding 
principle 
is 
betrayed 
by 
a 
fear 
of 
holes, 
of 
being 
bitten, 
stabbed, 
ideas 
of 
persecution 
by 
men, 
by 
bulls, 
the 
position 
of 
the 
back, 
the 
being 
pulled 
to 
the 
right, 
backwards, 
to 
be 
pressed 
upon, 
to 
fall, 
etc., 
a 
guiding 
principle 
which 
is 
readily 
reacted 
on 
with 
an 
insuring 
anxiety.(*The 
same 
masculine 
protest 
leads 
in 
the 
neurosis 
to 
trismus, 
blepharospasmus, 
vaginismus, 
spasm 
of 
the 
sphincter, 
globus 
and 
spasm 
of 
vocal 
cords.) 


Obstipation 
as 
a 
neurotic 
symptom 
takes 
its 
origin 
in 
a 
hereditary 
defect 
of 
the 
intestines, 
which 
leads 
to 
a 
neurotic 
/closure 
of 
the 
sphincter 
through 
ideas 
concerning 
anal 
birth 
and 
sexual 
relation. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact 
this 
patient 
suffered 
in 
her 
(childhood 
from 
intestinal 
catarrh 
and 
occasional 
intestinal 
V 



incontinence, 
later 
from 
obstipation 
and 
a 
recto-vaginal 
fistula. 
That 
the 
closure 
of 
the 
anus 
was 
under 
the 
domination 
of 
a 
guiding 
idea 
of 
closing 
of 
cavities 
is 
likewise 
seen 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
patient 
suffered 
for 
a 
considerable 
length 
of 
time 
following 
her 
marriage 
from 
vaginismus. 
The 
obstipation 
of 
this 
aging 
woman 
expresses 
in 
a 
dual 
way 
the 
same 
desire 
as 
did 
her 
erstwhile 
vaginismus, 
namely, 
" 
I 
don't 
want 
to 
be 
a 
woman, 
I 
want 
to 
be 
a 
man." 


At 
this 
point 
I 
must 
for 
practical, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
theoretical 
reasons 
go 
considerably 
beyond 
the 
scope 
of 
a 
mere 
character 
delineation, 
as 
one 
is 
for 
that 
matter 
usually 
compelled 
to 
take 
into 
account 
the 
psyche 
as 
a 
whole 
in 
every 
discussion 
of 
psychological 
questions. 
Besides 
this 
so 
minutely 
analyzed 
case 
furnishes 
a 
clearer 
insight 
than 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
gain 
in 
other 
cases, 
especially 
where, 
because 
of 
a 
dependence 
upon 
the 
physician 
or 
upon 
extraneous 
circumstances, 
a 
cure 
or 
discontinuance 
of 
the 
treatment 
takes 
place 
before 
the 
scheme, 
according 
to 
which 
the 
patient 
built 
his 
psychosis, 
becomes 
completely 
revealed. 
Thus 
I 
will 
attempt 
to 
set 
forth 
in 
this 
case, 
this 
scheme, 
by 
arranging 
according 
to 
this 
analytically 
disclosed 
scheme 
all 
her 
symptoms, 
the 
sentinels 
opposite 
the 
outer 
world, 
and 
show 
the 
synthetic 
relationship 
of 
the 
traits 
of 
character 
with 
it. 


According 
to 
this 
scheme 
(p. 
184-6) 
the 
patient 
arranged 
all 
her 
experiences, 
and 
wherever 
they 
fitted 
at 
all, 
occasion 
for 
which 
is 
amply 
furnished 
in 
the 
life 
of 
every 
individual 
by 
his 
symbolic 
as 
well 
as 
purposive 
apperceptions, 
she 
reacted 
to 
them 
with 
the 
appropriate 
disease 
manifestations. 
The 
protective 
traits 
of 
character 
were 
pushed 
to 
the 
fore, 
like 
outposts, 
were 
ever 
ready 
for 
defense, 
and 
explained 
situations 
in 
accordance 
with 
guiding 
thoughts, 
and 
whenever 
the 
occasion 
arose, 
borrowed 
support 
from 
the 
sum 
total 
of 
the 
appropriate 
symptoms. 
Her 
manifestations 
of 
independence 
were 
considerably 
interfered 
with 
by 
the 
intelligent 
and 
tender 
attitude 
of 
her 
husband 
and 
by 
certain 
benevolent 
guiding 
principles 
of 
the 
patient. 
Thus 
it 
happened 
that 
the 
basic 
scheme, 
"I'm 
only 
a 
woman," 
derived 
its 
influence 
from 
intentionally 
retained 
impressions 
of 
the 
feminine 
role, 
in 
connection 
with 
which 
the 
unconscious 
mechanism 
of 
the 
masculine 
guiding 
thoughts 
furnished 
the 
protecting 
memento. 
The 
healthy 
woman 
is 
characterized 
by 
a 
more 
conscious 
attitude 
toward 
the 
feminine 
role 
by 
a 
purposive 
dovetailing 
and 
corrective 
approximation 
of 
the 
scheme 
to 
reality. 



The 
psychosis 
produced 
an 
accentuation 
of 
the 
imaginary 
scheme 
for 
protective 
purposes, 
and 
an 
incorrigible 
attitude 
within 
this 
scheme; 
such 
a 
patient 
will 
conduct 
herself 
as 
if 
she 
really 
were 
pregnant. 
In 
all 
three 
cases 
the 
fiction 
of 
pregnancy 
and 
the 
greater 
circle 
of 
its 
manifestations, 
a 
symbol 
of 
the 
inferior 
feminine 
role, 
a 
convincing 
expression 
for 
the 
feeling 
of 
degradation, 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
looked 
upon 
from 
the 
standpoint 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
an 
artifice 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
avoiding 
further 
degradation, 
as 
was 
shown 
above.* 


* 
The 
transformation 
of 
the 
masculine 
fiction 
may 
reach 
a 
point 
where 
under 
its 
direction 
maternity, 
pregnancy, 
may 
be 
striven 
for, 
quite 
frequently 
in 
such 
cases 
where 
obstacles 
of 
a 
very 
gross 
nature 
exist. 
The 
cry 
for 
a 
baby 
is 
then 
regularly 
directed 
against 
the 
man. 
Phantom 
pregnancies 
frequently 
represent 
such 
an 
arrangement. 

A 
dream 
which 
took 
place 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
the 
treatment 
shows 
us 
the 
original 
guiding 
thought 
of 
the 
patient 
in 
connection 
with 
her 
actual 
inner 
conflicts. 
She 
dreamed: 
" 
As 
if 
she 
were 
sitting 
on 
a 
bench 
in 
a 
park 
near 
the 
residence 
of 
her 
parents, 
ill 
and 
weak. 
She 
wore 
on 
her 
head 
two 
bathing 
caps. 
Two 
girls 
then 
approached 
from 
behind 
her 
and 
one 
of 
them 
tore 
one 
of 
the 
caps 
from 
her 
head. 
She 
grabbed 
hold 
of 
the 
girl 
and 
held 
her 
while 
the 
other 
one 
disappeared 
and 
threatened 
to 
report 
her 
to 
the 
police. 
A 
poor, 
badly 
clothed 
woman 
passed 
by 
and 
told 
her 
that 
the 
girl's 
name 
was 
Velicka. 
At 
this 
point 
she 
went 
to 
her 
mother 
in 
order 
to 
complain. 
Her 
mother 
gave 
her 
a 
basket 
full 
of 
eggs 
and 
said 
they 
cost 
5 
guldens. 
She 
took 
two 
of 
the 
eggs 
in 
her 
hand 
and 
saw 
that 
they 
were 
pretty." 


The 
situation 
on 
the 
bench; 
her 
fatigue 
and 
the 
bathing 
caps 
referred 
to 
a 



hydropathic 
treatment 
which 
she 
had 
undertaken 
especially 
for 
the 
removal 
of 
an 
insomnia 
prior 
to 
coming 
under 
my 
care. 
On 
the 
day 
preceding 
the 
dream 
she 
reprimanded 
her 
daughter 
because 
the 
latter 
used 
her 
bath 
linen 
for 
her 
own 
use; 
she 
also 
possessed 
two 
bathing 
caps, 
as 
in 
the 
dream, 
which 
the 
daughter 
likewise 
often 
used. 
Velicka 
is 
a 
Slavic 
word 
signifying 
big. 
The 
daughter 
had 
a 
Slavic 
" 
Adelspiraedikat." 
The 
poorly-dressed 
woman 
is 
a 
noblewoman 
by 
the 
name 
of 
Grandvenire. 
Opposed 
to 
the 
two 
is 
she, 
the 
plebeian, 
degraded 
one. 
She 
was 
dissatisfied 
because 
her 
husband 
was 
not 
knighted, 
but 
on 
account 
of 
her 
pride 
she 
did 
not 
acknowledge 
this 
envy. 
She 
was 
afraid 
that 
her 
daughter 
might 
be 
able 
to 
take 
everything 
away 
from 
her. 
She 
had 
two 
daughters, 
one 
died, 
disappeared. 
She 
often 
complained 
to 
me 
that 
her 
daughter 
cost 
her 
much 
money. 
She 
has 
already 
given 
her 
all 
her 
jewelry. 
From 
her 
very 
childhood 
she 
has 
always 
been 
degraded 
before 
others. 
Even 
her 
mother 
always 
humbled 
her 
and 
demanded 
payment 
from 
her 
for 
every 
little 
thing 
after 
the 
patient 
had 
become 
married. 
She, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
supplied 
her 
daughter 
regularly 
with 
eggs, 
venison, 
milk, 
butter, 
etc., 
and 
still 
she 
needed 
so 
much 
money. 
Before 
she 
left 
for 
Vienna 
she 
forgot 
to 
settle 
a 
debt 
of 
5 
guldens. 
The 
day 
previous 
she 
wrote 
to 
her 
husband 
that 
he 
should 
pay 
this 
at 
once. 
In 
fact 
she 
always 
had 
to 
pay 
at 
once 
for 
everything 
she 
bought.* 


*The 
fear 
to 
become 
humiliated 
through 
further 
expenses 
is 
closely 
allied 
to 
the 
utilization 
of 
the 
character-type 
of 
greed 
and 
parsimony. 
These 
maternal, 
and 
according 
to 
her 
way 
of 
looking, 
feminine 
traits, 
she 
avoided 
through 
a 
compulsion 
to 
pay 
beforehand 
and 
showed 
herself 
to 
be 
superior 
to 
her 
mother 
through 
her 
liberality. 


The 
mother 
treated 
her 
badly. 
In 
the 
dream 
she 
recalled 
a 
forgotten 
obligation. 
She 
always 
saved 
at 
her 
expense. 
In 
the 
dream 
she 
received 
from 
her 
mother 
the 
masculine 
attribute 
(testicles) 
which 
the 
mother 
kept 
from 
her 
at 
the 
time 
of 
birth. 
We 
see 
again 
how 
out 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
femininity 
(degradation) 
the 
masculine 
protest 
is 
in 
the 
dream 
directed 
against 
further 
insults. 
This 
dream 
shows 
us 
the 
attempt 
of 
the 
patient 
to 
evade 
in 
her 
thoughts 
further 
degradation 
and 
to 
accuse 
her 
daughter 
that 
like 
her 
mother 
she 
kept 
everything 
from 
her. 


Similarly, 
this 
lust 
to 
possess 
everything 
is 
found 
in 
the 
following 
case 
history 
which 
shows 
still 
more 
clearly 
than 
the 
preceding 
case 
how 
the 
patient 
on 
account 
of 
his 
pride 
seeks 
to 
remove 
this 
lust 
from 
his 
field 
of 



vision, 
to 
repress 
it. 
We 
shall 
see 
how 
a 
decided 
change 
takes 
place 
through 
the 
revelation 
of 
this 
repression 
and 
through 
the 
elucidation 
of 
the 
OEdipus 
complex. 
In 
the 
same 
manner 
it 
appears 
from 
all 
these 
cases 
that 
this 
lust 
to 
have 
everything 
pursues 
the 
most 
senseless 
goals. 
Such 
patients 
have 
eyes 
for 
everything 
which 
others 
in 
their 
circle 
possess 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
are 
excluded 
from 
the 
possession 
of 
the 
same. 
They 
may 
possess 
more 
than 
the 
others 
and 
yet 
they 
will 
envy 
them. 
They 
may 
gain 
everything 
which 
they 
formerly 
begrudged 
others 
and 
will 
then 
unceremoniously 
set 
it 
aside 
in 
order 
to 
furnish 
new 
goals 
for 
their 
desires 
and 
possessions. 
And 
their 
lust 
for 
possession 
ever 
remains 
attached 
to 
those 
goals 
which 
they 
have 
not 
attained. 
It 
is 
readily 
understood 
that 
they 
are 
incapacitated 
for 
love 
and 
friendship. 
Often 
they 
acquire 
a 
general 
ability 
to 
misrepresent 
and 
set 
out 
to 
captivate 
souls 
because 
others 
also 
dominate. 
They 
constantly 
fear 
degradation 
and 
always 
seek 
to 
assure 
themselves 
long 
beforehand. 
The 
love 
of 
the 
parents 
enjoyed 
by 
the 
brother, 
their 
jewelry, 
the 
marriage 
of 
a 
brother 
or 
of 
a 
sister, 
a 
book, 
an 
accomplishment 
of 
an 
acquaintance 
or 
even 
of 
a 
total 
stranger, 
fill 
them 
with 
rage.* 


* 
Thus 
an 
approaching 
marriage 
of 
a 
girl 
may 
lead 
to 
the 
development 
of 
a 
neurosis 
in 
the 
brother 
or 
father 
when 
the 
latter 
are 
neurotically 
disposed. 
Thus 
the 
arrangement 
of 
affection 
may 
then 
give 
the 
impression 
of 
incest 
stirrings. 
The 
superiority 
of 
another, 
a 
successfully 
passed 
examination, 
possession 
or 
worth 
of 
brothers 
and 
sisters 
throw 
them 
into 
excitements, 
cause 
them 
headache, 
insomnia 
and 
more 
pronounced 
neurotic 
symptoms. 
Their 
constant 
fear 
not 
to 
become 
equal 
of 
an 
older 
or 
younger 
brother 
may 
render 
them 
unfit 
for 
work. 
It 
is 
then 
that 
they 
attempt 
to 
avoid 
all 
decisions 
and 
tests, 
it 
is 
then 
that 
they 
reach 
the 
stage 
of 
loss 
or 
initiative, 
approach 
often 
in 
any 
possible 
way 
the 
withdrawal 
from 
life 
and 
support 
themselves 
in 
the 
meanwhile 
on 
their 
ad 
hoc 
created 
symptoms 
among 
which 
there 
came 
to 
my 
attention 
frequently 
compulsory 
blushing, 
migraine, 
all 
sorts 
of 
headaches, 
palpitation 
of 
the 
heart, 
stuttering, 
agoraphobia 
and 
claustrophobia, 
tremor, 
sleepiness, 
depression, 
weakness 
of 
memory, 
excessive 
thirst 
and 
psychogenic 
epilepsy. 


I 
have 
especially 
emphasized 
above 
the 
case 
of 
the 
younger 
brother 



because 
I 
met 
with 
him 
oftenest 
and 
because 
he 
is 
most 
apt 
to 
be 
driven 
to 
rivalry. 
(Frisoliauf. 
" 
Psvchology 
of 
the 
Younger 
Brother." 
Munich, 
A. 
Keinhardt, 
1912.) 


This 
case 
is 
not 
an 
exception. 
One 
also 
finds 
in 
this 
role 
older 
siblings 
or 
only 
children, 
naturally 
also 
girls. 
The 
rivalry 
may 
also 
be 
directed 
primarily 
against 
the 
father 
or 
mother 
in 
whose 
picture 
the 
desired 
superiority 
appears 
to 
be 
concretely 
represented. 
It 
is 
then 
that 
the 
CEdipuscomplex 
develops 
out 
of 
the 
longing 
of 
the 
predisposed 
child, 
as 
a 
guiding 
model, 
a 
guiding 
fiction 
to 
gain 
satisfaction 
for 
his 
craving, 
and 
this 
takes 
place 
at 
a 
time 
when 
sexual 
craving 
is 
still 
out 
of 
the 
question, 
but 
it 
is 
also 
the 
desire 
to 
possess 
a 
person 
or 
an 
object 
which 
belongs 
to 
another. 
A 
belief 
in 
predestination 
and 
ideas 
of 
identification 
with 
God 
frequently 
develop 
as 
manifestations 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
Kleptomania 
is 
frequently 
revealed 
in 
the 
anamneses 
of 
these 
patients. 
At 
times 
the 
patient 
is 
unconscious 
of 
his 
guiding 
principle. 
Occasionally 
he 
is 
seen 
at 
work 
trying 
to 
conceal 
this 
guiding 
principle 
and 
to 
make 
it 
unrecognizable 
through 
a 
manifestation 
of 
opposed 
tendencies 
such 
as 
liberality. 


The 
wish, 
which 
for 
instance, 
draws 
him 
to 
his 
mother, 
changes 
nothing 
after 
it 
has 
become 
conscious 
in 
the 
disease 
picture, 
no 
matter 
how 
frankly 
sexual 
it 
may 
be 
shown 
to 
be. 
It 
is 
only 
after 
the 
patient 
understands 
and 
controls 
his 
desire 
for 
the 
unattainable, 
for 
that 
which 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
belongs 
to 
another, 
that 
recovery 
may 
take 
place. 


The 
boundless 
pride 
which 
one 
detects 
in 
some 
of 
these 
cases 
does 
not 
readily 
permit 
the 
patient 
to 
gain 
insight 
into 
his 
envy 
and 
jealousy. 
The 
tendency 
to 
belittle 
others 
is, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
quite 
markedly 
developed 
and 
readily 
comes 
to 
the 
surface. 
Malice, 
revengefulness, 
desire 
for 
intrigue 
(and 
in 
those 
of 
lower 
intelligence), 
more 
crudely 
aggressive 
tendencies, 
even 
sadistic 
and 
murder-instincts 
reveal 
themselves 
as 
attempts 
to 
insure 
oneself 
against 
a 
degradation 
in 
this 
eternal 
rivalry. 
The 
fear 
of 
the 
consequences, 
such 
as 
a 
lively 
concern 
about 
the 
needs 
of 
relatives, 
the 
picturing 
to 
oneself 
of 
punishments, 
arrest 
and 
misery 
are 
appertaining 
assurances 
against 
the 
ebullitions 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
Even 
epileptic 
seizures 
may 
serve 
as 
security 
devices, 
thus, 
for 
instance, 
as 
in 
our 
case, 
where 
a 
psychoepileptic 
insult 
associated 
itself 
with 
patricidal 
and 
fratricidal 
dream-stirrings. 


It 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
motive 
of 
a 
" 
scorned 
love 
" 
regularly 
plays 
a 
role 
in 



these 
cases, 
and 
brings 
about 
the 
most 
intense 
hate 
against 
the 
unattained 
person. 
One 
may 
justly 
doubt 
whether 
love 
in 
a 
normal 
person 
is 
capable 
of 
such 
a 
transformation. 
It 
requires 
the 
sum-total 
of 
power-instincts, 
the 
overheated 
ego-consciousness 
of 
these 
individuals 
to 
desire 
to 
bring 
about 
the 
spiritual 
possession 
of 
another 
person 
against 
that 
person's 
will. 
Inasmuch 
as 
the 
neurotic 
desires 
to 
possess 
everything, 
he 
is 
blind 
to 
all 
natural 
restrictions, 
and 
experiences 
in 
the 
scorn 
of 
his 
love 
a 
thrust 
at 
his 
most 
sensitive 
principle. 
Now 
he 
turns 
to 
revenge: 
Achevonia 
movebo. 


When 
one 
is 
in 
doubt 
as 
to 
which 
of 
two 
persons 
the 
patient 
has 
selected 
for 
his 
affections, 
whether 
the 
father 
or 
mother, 
it 
is 
safe 
to 
assume 
that 
it 
is 
the 
opposite 
to 
the 
one 
the 
patient 
mentions. 
It 
would 
be 
too 
painful, 
as 
a 
rule, 
to 
acknowledge 
scorned 
love. 
An 
exact 
solution 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
be 
furnished 
by 
the 
following 
simple 
experiment: 


One 
places 
the 
patient 
exactly 
between 
the 
two 
persons 
in 
question, 
and 
soon 
one 
observes 
that 
he 
has 
moved 
nearer 
the 
preferred 
one. 


Thus 
I 
was 
able 
to 
discover 
in 
the 
case 
which 
I 
am 
about 
to 
discuss 
in 
detail 
that 
the 
patient 
showed 
decided 
preference 
for 
his 
mother, 
though 
when 
he 
was 
alone 
he 
always 
gave 
preference 
to 
his 
father. 
He 
not 
infrequently 
scolded 
his 
mother, 
and 
not 
a 
day 
passed 
but 
what 
they 
quarrelled. 


A 
certain 
manifestation 
which 
one 
frequently 
observes 
in 
the 
neuroses 
was 
likewise 
present 
here, 
and 
in 
an 
especially 
accentuated 
form, 
namely, 
the 
strong 
emphasis 
of 
a 
pedantic 
character 
trait, 
which, 
not 
unlike 
the 
"crack 
regiment" 
in 
war 
time, 
took 
over 
the 
task 
of 
coming 
in 
touch 
with 
the 
enemy. 
The 
enemy 
was 
first 
of 
all 
the 
mother, 
and 
the 
daily 
battles 
regularly 
developed 
because 
the 
latter 
was 
unable 
to 
do 
full 
justice 
to 
the 
patient's 
pedantic 
demands 
in 
eating, 
in 
dressing, 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
his 
bath 
or 
bed. 
Our 
patient 
thus 
gained 
a 
base 
of 
operation 
from 
which 
emanated 
the 
various 
subterfuges 
by 
means 
of 
which 
he 
endeavored 
to 
place 
his 
mother, 
after 
all, 
completely 
at 
his 
service. 
In 
this 
is 
seen 
again 
a 
neurotic 
trait 
of 
character 
as 
a 
device, 
by 
means 
of 
which 
the 
patient 
seeks 
to 
be 
true 
to 
his 
inner 
fiction, 
to 
dominate 
his 
mother 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
he 
believed 
to 
have 
observed 
his 
father 
dominate 
her. 
"And 
should 
you 
be 
unwilling, 
I'll 
use 
force." 
This 
train 
of 
thought 
gained 
stability 
from 
the 
patient 
in 
his 
youth, 
and 
thus 
he 
at 
once 
assumed 
towards 
his 
mother 
an 
attitude 
of 
mistrust, 
constantly 
on 
the 
alert 
for 
setbacks, 
for 
the 
preferring 
of 
others; 
full 
of 
tense 
energy 
and 
gloomy 



expectation 
whether 
he 
will 
yet 
succeed 
in 
gaining 
her 
for 
himself. 
Not 
because 
he 
really 
loved 
her, 
or 
really 
desired 
to 
possess 
her, 
but 
because 
his 
desire 
for 
possession 
of 
her 
was 
similar 
to 
the 
desire 
which 
he 
had 
for 
many 
other 
things, 
jewelry, 
bonbons, 
which 
he 
valued 
not 
at 
all 
highly, 
but 
left 
lying 
in 
a 
drawer, 
forgotten, 
once 
he 
could 
call 
them 
his 
own. 
Thus 
the 
possession 
of 
the 
mother 
was 
not 
an 
end 
in 
itself, 
his 
desire 
was 
not 
at 
all 
a 
libidinous 
or 
sexual 
one, 
but 
the 
mother 
and 
his 
distance 
from 
her 
became 
a 
symbol 
for 
him, 
an 
estimate 
of 
his 
own 
inferiority. 
And 
because 
he 
apperceived 
the 
cosmic 
picture, 
every 
new 
acquaintance, 
every 
relation 
to 
the 
opposite 
sex 
with 
the 
same 
traits 
of 
character, 
suspiciously, 
full 
of 
sensitiveness, 
with 
a 
similar 
expectation 
of 
a 
disappointment, 
all 
success 
fled 
from 
him, 
all 
satisfaction 
in 
life 
was 
lost 
to 
him. 
He 
had 
eyes 
only 
for 
everything 
which 
spoke 
against 
him, 
against 
his 
success, 
and 
whatever 
he 
did 
attain 
lost 
all 
charm 
for 
him. 
He 
settled 
the 
problem 
of 
his 
life 
with 
the 
arrangement 
of 
his 
neurosis. 
He 
considered 
himself 
deficient 
by 
a 
whole 
lot 
and 
this 
deficiency 
was 
represented 
in 
the 
symbolic 
loss 
of 
the 
mother. 


Does 
one 
suppose 
that 
this 
patient 
who 
had 
been 
suffering 
from 
anxiety-
states, 
migraine 
and 
depressions, 
could 
have 
been 
cured 
if 
his 
mother 
were 
returned 
to 
him? 
Such 
an 
attempt 
would 
have 
been 
fruitless 
at 
the 
time 
the 
patient 
came 
to 
the 
physician. 
Even 
the 
most 
compliant 
mother 
and 
many 
of 
them 
are 
lastingly 
estranged 
from 
their 
sons 
could 
not 
have 
shown 
that 
measure 
of 
patience 
and 
sacrifice 
which 
the 
patient 
demanded 
in 
his 
boundless 
mistrust 
and 
desire 
for 
dominancy. 
The 
past, 
and 
the 
thought 
of 
former 
privations, 
were 
ever 
ready 
to 
furnish 
motives 
for 
new 
outbreaks 
and 
oppressions. 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
attempt 
at 
cure 
might 
have 
been 
a 
successful 
one 
in 
the 
patient's 
childhood, 
a 
pedagogic 
solution 
of 
this 
special 
neurotic 
problem 
in 
a 
gradual 
orientation 
and 
independence 
of 
the 
child, 
and 
an 
appropriate 
tranquilizing 
of 
the 
child 
concerning 
his 
future. 
It 
is 
the 
uncertainty 
which 
mars 
the 
outlook 
for 
the 
future 
in 
these 
children, 
an 
uncertainty 
whose 
organic 
and 
psychic 
roots 
we 
already 
know. 
In 
our 
case 
it 
was 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
patient, 
already 
as 
a 
child, 
even 
during 
the 
suckling 
period 
showed 
a 
tendency 
to 
become 
easily 
frightened 
and 
panicky. 
This 
fright 
of 
sucklings 
which 
is 
frequently 
taken 
as 
nervousness 
is 
obviously 
an 
organic 
inheritance 
and 
is 
associated, 
according 
to 
my 
observations, 
with 
an 
hereditary 
sensitiveness, 
inferiority 
of 
the 
auditory 
apparatus, 
so 
that 
children 



already 
become 
panicky 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
noises 
and 
tones 
to 
which 
other 
children 
pay 
no 
unusual 
attention. 
From 
our 
standpoint 
this 
striking 
tendency 
to 
fright 
signifies 
a 
sign 
of 
an 
hereditary, 
auditory 
oversensitiveness, 
a 
manifestation 
of 
a 
somatic 
inferiority 
of 
the 
familiar 
ear 
diseases, 
but 
likewise 
corresponds 
to 
a 
heightened 
refinement 
of 
hearing 
in 
the 
musical 
sense. 
The 
fact 
that 
our 
patient 
suffered 
at 
the 
age 
of 
6 
years 
from 
a 
protracted 
middle 
ear 
disease 
which 
necessitated 
paracentesis 
of 
the 
ear 
drum, 
is 
in 
accord 
with 
our 
views 
concerning 
somatic 
inferiority; 
similarly, 
his 
development 
of 
an 
excellent 
musical 
ear 
and 
of 
a 
strikingly 
refined 
sensitiveness 
in 
hearing 
which 
especially 
qualified 
him 
for 
eavesdropping. 
This 
somatic 
refinement 
brings 
with 
it 
that 
the 
child 
is 
driven 
to 
a 
development 
of 
a 
tendency 
towards 
a 
lurking 
curiosity, 
even 
though 
he 
may 
feel 
more 
marked 
uncertainties 
from 
other 
causes. 
The 
roots 
of 
this 
uncertainty 
from 
which 
he 
endeavors 
to 
escape 
by 
means 
of 
his 
curiosity, 
laid 
in 
the 
patient's 
weaker 
intellect, 
compared 
with 
an 
older 
brother 
who 
as 
it 
often 
happens 
to 
the 
detriment 
of 
bringing 
up 
made 
of 
the 
patient 
the 
plaything 
of 
his 
railleries 
and 
often 
made 
a 
fool 
of 
him. 


The 
patient 
also 
recalled 
that 
he 
had 
suffered 
from 
that 
form 
of 
cryptorchism 
in 
which 
a 
testicle 
occasionally 
disappears 
into 
the 
abdominal 
cavity 
through 
the 
patent 
canal. 
This 
fact, 
that 
is, 
the 
better 
sexual 
development 
of 
his 
brother, 
the 
earlier 
maturity 
of 
the 
latter, 
brought 
to 
his 
mind 
quite 
early 
the 
thought 
that 
he 
was 
perhaps 
a 
girl 
after 
all. 
Up 
to 
the 
fourth 
year 
of 
his 
life 
he 
was 
dressed 
in 
girl's 
clothes, 
and 
during 
this 
period 
he 
developed 
the 
fear 
that 
he 
never 
perhaps 
would 
reach 
the 
mature 
state 
of 
his 
father 
or 
his 
older 
brother, 
that 
is, 
never 
become 
a 
complete 
man. 
The 
marked 
development 
of 
his 
breasts 
lent 
considerable 
weight 
to 
his 
uncertainty. 
That 
he 
unconsciously 
gave 
considerable 
thought 
to 
the 
question 
of 
the 
difference 
of 
the 
sexes, 
one 
may 
glean 
from 
an 
occurrence 
which 
remained 
fixed 
in 
his 
memory, 
because 
at 
the 
time 
he 
told 
it 
everyone 
laughed 
at 
him. 
One 
day 
while 
in 
a 
public 
park 
he 
watched 
a 
girl 
urinate 
and 
upon 
reaching 
home 
related 
how 
he 
had 
seen 
a 
boy 
urinate 
from 
behind." 


This 
early 
period 
in 
his 
life 
was 
of 
marked 
significance 
in 
shaping 
his 
attitude 
towards 
his 
family 
and 
in 
a 
broader 
sense 
to 
the 
world 
at 
large. 
He 
saw 
himself 
belittled, 
and 
his 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
found 
no 
adjustment 
in 
the 
family. 
His 
covetousness, 
his 
craving 
to 
become 
the 
equal 
of 
his 
brother, 
of 
his 
father, 
of 
anyone 
whom 
he 
considered 
strong, 
able, 
powerful, 
gained 
in 



intensity 
and 
directed 
him 
upon 
paths 
in 
which 
he 
came 
into 
serious 
conflicts 
with 
his 
parents. 
He 
became 
a 
bad, 
unmanageable 
child, 
which 
made 
a 
tender 
attitude 
of 
his 
parents 
towards 
him 
still 
more 
difficult. 
His 
desires 
assumed 
measureless 
proportions, 
he 
began 
to 
insure 
himself 
against 
every 
setback 
suspiciously 
and 
with 
a 
growing 
choler, 
and 
this 
at 
a 
time 
when 
his 
maturing 
genitalia, 
his 
strikingly 
hairy 
body, 
his 
improved 
insight 
into 
matters 
sexual, 
should 
have 
had 
their 
tranquilizing 
effect 
upon 
him. 
But 
by 
this 
time 
his 
position 
in 
the 
family 
became 
such 
an 
unfavorable 
one, 
owing 
to 
the 
development 
of 
his 
traits 
of 
character, 
which 
likewise 
unfavorably 
influenced 
his 
school 
work, 
that 
with 
his 
over-sensitive 
nature 
he 
had 
good 
reason 
to 
feel 
himself 
slighted 
and 
belittled. 
Thus 
he 
was 
no 
longer 
able 
to 
find 
the 
road 
to 
normality. 
That 
he, 
however, 
continued 
to 
apperceive 
this 
slight 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
an 
analogy 
with 
the 
feminine 
role 
became 
already 
evident 
from 
the 
first 
dream 
which 
he 
recited 
during 
the 
treatment. 
The 
dream 
was 
"I 
felt 
as 
if 
I 
were 
witnessing 
an 
ape 
nursing 
a 
child." 


His 
brother 
often 
called 
him 
an 
ape 
because 
of 
his 
excessive 
hairy 
growth, 
which 
he 
nevertheless 
exhibited 
with 
pride. 
The 
ape, 
which 
is 
nursing 
the 
child, 
a 
female 
ape, 
is 
he 
himself 
that 
is, 
he 
sees 
himself, 
he 
feels 
himself 
in 
a 
feminine 
role, 
along 
with 
which 
the 
nursing 
is 
to 
be 
considered 
a 
gynecomastia 
(" 
Gynakomastie 
") 
which 
came 
up 
during 
the 
dream 
analysis. 
This 
is 
the 
feminine 
principle 
emphasized 
by 
me 
for 
all 
dreams 
against 
which 
the 
stressing 
of 
the 
excessive 
hairy 
growth 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
as 
pointing 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
Thus 
the 
patient 
enters 
upon 
the 
treatment 
with 
the 
disclosure 
that 
he 
feels 
himself 
belittled 
and 
permits 
us 
to 
divine 
from 
the 
choice 
of 
his 
figure 
of 
speech, 
that 
he 
evaluates 
this 
inferiority 
as 
feminine. 


1 
The 
original 
uncertainty 
of 
the 
sexual 
role, 
as 
I 
have 
been 
emphasizing 
for 
years, 
plays 
one 
of 
the 
chief 
parts 
in 
the 
development 
of 
the 
neurotic 
psyche, 
which 
is 
later 
on 
vitalized 
as 
a 
symbol 
and 
base 
of 
operation 
in 
the 
struggle 
for 
dominancy. 
It 
is 
only 
of 
late 
that 
many 
authorities 
are 
beginning 
to 
agree 
with 
me 
on 
this 
point. 


I 
wish 
to 
draw 
attention, 
in 
this 
connection, 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
dreamer 
often 
chooses 
pictures 
and 
forms 
of 
expression 
which 
show 
a 
simultaneous 
coloring 
of 
feminine 
and 
masculine 
traits. 
Here 
it 
was 
an 
ape, 
whose 
nursing 
was 
a 
feminine 
characteristic, 
while 
the 
hairy 
growth 
is 
to 
be 
apperceived 
as 
a 



masculine 
characteristic. 
Such 
forms 
of 
expression 
which 
I 
have 
recognized 
as 
belonging 
to 
the 
psychic 
hermaphroditism 
may 
be 
referred 
to 
two 
simplifying 
circumstances. 
First, 
they 
correspond 
to 
the 
infantile 
indefiniteness 
of 
sex-cognition. 
Second, 
because 
the 
element 
of 
time, 
as 
in 
other 
cases, 
the 
element 
of 
space, 
is 
during 
the 
marked 
abstraction 
of 
the 
dream 
state 
wholly 
or 
almost 
wholly 
eliminated, 
so 
that 
his 
thoughts 
which 
may 
be 
separated 
spatially 
or 
temporally, 
become 
united 
in 
one 
case 
the 
thoughts 
were 
" 
I 
feel 
myself 
a 
woman 
and 
wish 
to 
be 
a 
man." 
Stekel, 
in 
his 
further 
elaboration 
of 
my 
conception 
of 
psychic 
hermaphroditism, 
assumes 
a 
double 
sexual 
meaning 
for 
every 
dream 
symbol, 
which 
I 
think 
is 
a 
certain 
exaggeration, 
nevertheless 
he 
comes 
closer 
to 
the 
truth 
than 
does 
Freud 
who 
denies 
the 
regular 
manifestation 
in 
the 
dream 
of 
psychic 
hermaphroditism 
and 
the 
masculine 
protest. 


The 
distinctness 
with 
which 
this 
first 
dream 
of 
our 
patient 
points 
to 
his 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
so 
to 
speak, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
reaction 
to 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
treatment, 
is 
naturally 
also 
to 
be 
understood 
as 
an 
omen 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
physician: 
"My 
disease 
has 
its 
origin 
in 
my 
feeling 
of 
inferiority." 
"My 
disease," 
fainting 
attacks 
and 
business 
incapacity 
are 
security 
devices 
against 
a 
defeat 
in 
the 
fifth 
act. 
"I 
am 
impotent 
and 
inefficient 
as 
a 
child 
and 
long 
for 
love, 
ape-love, 
as 
I 
see 
it 
in 
the 
dream." 
We 
fill 
out: 
impotent 
for 
reason, 
in 
order 
to 
be 
pampered 
like 
a 
child, 
which 
he 
succeeds 
in 
attaining 
more 
readily 
after 
his 
attacks; 
and 
inefficient, 
in 
order 
that 
he 
may 
always 
be 
supplied 
with 
maintenance, 
in 
order 
that 
it 
may 
not 
be 
forgotten 
that 
he 
must 
be 
made 
secure 
for 
life 
through 
affection 
and 
legacy. 
His 
marked 
tendency 
to 
be 
frightened 
by 
sudden 
noises, 
his 
hyperacusis 
was 
especially 
fitted 
to 
aid 
him 
in 
gaining 
his 
point. 
The 
finale 
which 
he 
set 
before 
him, 
a 
desired 
overcompensation 
for 
a 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
consisted 
in 
not 
more 
nor 
less 
than 
the 
desire 
to 
gain 
the 
love 
of 
his 
parents, 
especially 
that 
difficult 
of 
attainment, 
mother's 
love. 
Thus 
he 
utilizes, 
with 
the 
object 
of 
influencing 
his 
mother's 
heart, 
the 
alreadymentioned 
experiences, 
such 
as 
becoming 
frightened 
upon 
hearing 
a 
shot, 
as 
he 
often 
manifested 
upon 
hearing 
the 
firing 
at 
a 
military 
funeral, 
upon 
hearing 
the 
puffing 
and 
shrill 
whistling 
of 
a 
locomotive, 
and 
during 
a 
sudden 
assault 
by 
his 
brother 
or 
playmates. 
The 
finale 
which 
constantly 
stands 
before 
his 
eyes, 
drew 
upon 
itself 
a 
fixation 
of 
this 
hyperacusis, 
which 
dominated 
him 
up 
to 
the 
present. 
This 
purposeful 



hypersensitiveness 
serves, 
as 
do 
similar 
phenomena 
in 
hysteria, 
to 
show 
us 
that 
the 
patient's 
uncertainty 
forces 
him 
to 
stretch 
forth 
his 
antennae 
as 
far 
as 
possible, 
as 
he 
is 
actually 
doing 
with 
over-tense 
traits 
of 
character. 
Aside 
from 
this 
his 
tendency 
to 
fear 
pressed 
upon 
his 
masculine 
feeling 
and 
gave 
him 
the 
sense 
of 
feminine 
stimuli. 
He 
endeavored, 
therefore, 
to 
bring 
forth 
in 
all 
other 
relations, 
courage 
and 
fearless 
behavior, 
in 
which 
he 
too 
succeeded. 


The 
laying 
bare 
of 
his 
desire 
for 
the 
love 
of 
the 
mother 
brought 
forth 
no 
particular 
result. 
His 
attacks 
occurred 
at 
about 
the 
same 
intervals, 
but 
now 
he 
had 
them 
in 
bed, 
in 
order 
to 
protect 
himself 
in 
this 
way 
from 
the 
possible 
inroads 
of 
the 
treatment, 
which, 
at 
this 
stage, 
was 
encountering 
more 
difficulty 
in" 
endeavoring 
to 
uncover 
the 
causes 
of 
his 
attacks. 
Prior 
to 
this 
the 
attacks 
occurred 
always 
in 
connection 
with 
experiences 
which 
threatened 
him 
with 
a 
set-back, 
but 
now 
I 
was 
compelled 
to 
reconstruct 
these 
experiences 
from 
his 
thoughts 
and 
dreams. 
Naturally 
the 
patient 
made 
a 
virtue 
of 
this 
necessity, 
and 
spoke 
of 
this 
change 
as 
an 
improvement 
due 
to 
my 
treatment, 
thus 
expecting 
to 
gain 
in 
this 
way 
my 
sympathy, 
an 
experience 
which 
he 
always 
apperceived 
as 
a 
feeling 
of 
power. 
To 
this 
craving 
after 
this 
feeling 
of 
power 
he 
owes 
his 
success 
in 
passing 
as 
a 
very 
sociable 
and 
pleasant 
fellow 
in 
his 
intercourse 
with 
strangers. 


It 
may 
be 
said 
here 
that 
because 
of 
my 
different 
conception 
of 
these 
matters, 
the 
OEdipus-complex 
does 
not 
come 
very 
clearly 
to 
the 
surface, 
here, 
at 
any 
rate 
not 
so 
clearly 
as 
Freud 
has 
demonstrated 
this 
complex. 
To 
this 
I 
would 
have 
to 
object 
energetically. 
It 
was 
this 
case 
particularly, 
as 
so 
few 
of 
them 
do, 
which 
brought 
to 
view 
regardless 
of 
consequence, 
the 
striving 
for 
the 
mother 
in 
a 
sexual 
manner, 
and 
the 
patient 
at 
no 
time 
hesitated 
to 
elaborate 
the 
frequently 
unconcealed 
OEdipus 
dreams 
as 
proof 
of 
his 
sexual 
striving 
after 
his 
mother. 
He 
had 
many 
such 
dreams. 
He 
dreamed: 
' 
I'm 
walking 
with 
a 
lady 
from 
our 
rendezvous 
towards 
the 
street." 


The 
lady 
represented 
his 
mother, 
as 
the 
various 
details 
showed. 
The 
"street" 
referred 
to 
prostitution. 
The 
"rendezvous”' 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
was 
a 
memory-remnant 
from 
his 
waking 
life 
and 
referred 
to 
a 
girl 
who 
refused 
him 
another 
meeting, 
thus 
by 
her 
refusal 
simulating 
his 
mother. 
He 
was 
unable 
to 
wield 
any 
influence 
over 
girls, 
and 
was 
thus, 
according 
to 
his 
own 
understanding, 
driven 
to 
the 
masculine 
feeling 
of 
power 
and 
in 
his 
protest 
degraded 
to 
the 
level 
of 
a 
prostitute 
his 
mother 
as 
well 
the 
girl, 
and 
for 
that 



matter 
all 
women, 
whom 
he 
naturally 
feared. 


Just 
as 
clearly 
the 
OEdipus-complex 
came 
to 
light 
in 
other 
dreams, 
where 
too 
the 
sexual, 
as 
a 
jargon, 
as 
a 
mode 
of 
speech, 
was 
only 
recognized 
after 
a 
penetration 
into 
the 
psychic 
constellation. 
Thus 
he 
dreamed:" 
I'm 
sitting 
at 
a 
smooth 
table 
made 
of 
brown 
wood. 
A 
girl 
brings 
me 
a 
large 
vessel 
of 
beer." 
The 
table 
reminded 
him 
of 
a 
subterranean 
cellar 
at 
Nuremberg, 
where 
he 
went 
to 
attend 
a 
scientific 
gathering 
which 
led 
him 
to 
the 
German 
museum. 
His 
thoughts 
drifted 
in 
the 
same 
general 
direction 
of 
Germanism 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
large 
vessel 
of 
beer. 
It 
is 
quite 
comprehensible 
that 
this 
unusually 
musical 
patient 
should 
in 
the 
analysis 
come 
upon 
Wagner's 
" 
Meistersinger." 
As 
he 
mentioned 
this 
he 
began 
to 
search 
for 
a 
scene 
in 
Wagner's 
operas, 
wherein 
some 
one 
takes 
a 
drink. 
At 
first 
he 
thought 
of 
Tristan, 
then 
of 
Siegfried's 
arrival 
at 
Gunter's 
palace 
v 
In 
both 
scenes 
the 
hero 
drinks 
a 
love 
potion. 
Thus 
our 
patient 
apperceives 
his 
enigmatical 
attraction 
for 
his 
mother 
as 
something 
provoked 
by 
the 
mother's 
magical 
powers. 
At 
last 
he 
thought 
of 
Siegmund 
to 
whom 
his 
sister 
Sieglinde 
compassionately 
gives 
a 
horn 
of 
meal. 


Thus 
the 
dream 
reads: 
The 
voice 
of 
blood 
(relation) 
hath 
spoken, 
the 
mother 
compassionately 
takes 
his 
part, 
he 
is 
the 
hero, 
who 
is 
the 
man 
(father) 
of 
his 
wife. 
An 
incestuous 
prospect, 
as 
in 
Wagner, 
the 
patient, 
as 
if 
intoxicated, 
longs 
after 
his 
mother. 


The 
psychic 
situation 
of 
the 
patient 
had 
experienced 
an 
"effeminization." 
His 
older 
brother 
had 
returned 
from 
a 
journey 
and 
was 
welcomed 
at 
home 
with 
much 
love. 
How 
different 
were 
matters 
upon 
his 
own 
return 
from 
his 
travels 
in 
Germany. 
The 
thought, 
I 
am 
belittled, 
became 
accentuated 
through 
the 
reception 
accorded 
his 
brother, 
and 
in 
the 
dream 
he 
seeks 
to 
save 
himself 
through 
a 
masculine 
guiding 
line. 
It 
was 
an 
attempt 
which 
was 
bound 
to 
fail. 
The 
same 
night 
he 
had 
a 
seizure. 


The 
seizure 
had 
for 
its 
purpose 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
mother's 
tenderness 
towards 
the 
patient. 
This 
was 
quite 
successful 
with 
the 
father. 
But 
even 
the 
mother 
would 
forget 
his 
jealous, 
frequently 
vulgar 
outbreaks 
of 
temper, 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
lay 
unconscious, 
and 
for 
a 
time 
would 
sit 
on 
his 
bed. 
Thus 
he 
satisfies 
his 
wish, 
his 
wish 
to 
possess 
everything, 
like 
the 
brother, 
like 
the 
father. 
The 
change 
of 
form 
of 
his 
original 
fiction, 
namely 
I 
have 
imperfect 
genitalia, 
I 
shall 
not 
be 
a 
complete 
man 
had 
reached 
the 
thought, 
I 
too 
wish 
to 



possess 
my 
mother 
as 
my 
father 
and 
brother 
possess 
her. 
In 
order 
to 
comport 
himself 
in 
this 
matter 
with 
the 
appropriate 
amount 
of 
energy, 
it 
required 
a 
deeply-felt 
conviction 
of 
his 
longing 
for 
his 
mother, 
which 
he 
proceeded 
to 
create. 


The 
most 
essential 
reason 
for 
his 
ardent 
attitude 
towards 
his 
mother 
was 
revealed 
in 
the 
further 
analysis, 
which 
revealed 
as 
the 
decisive 
point 
his 
feeling 
of 
uncertainty. 
As 
the 
mother 
isolated 
herself 
more 
and 
more 
from 
him 
during 
his 
childhood, 
he 
developed 
the 
idea, 
as 
is 
the 
case 
not 
infrequently 
with 
such 
children, 
that 
he 
did 
not 
belong 
to 
his 
family. 
The 
fairy 
tales 
of 
"Snow 
White" 
and 
" 
Cinderella 
" 
frequently 
furnish 
these 
children 
with 
leading 
thoughts. 
When 
his 
brother 
was 
ill 
once 
the 
mother 
did 
not 
leave 
him 
for 
a 
second. 
After 
that 
the 
patient 
was 
uninterruptedly 
stimulated 
to 
test, 
by 
means 
of 
his 
severe 
seizures, 
the 
family, 
especially 
the 
mother, 
and 
see 
if 
the 
"voice 
of 
blood 
" 
would 
speak. 
These 
tests 
he 
carried 
out 
with 
a 
genuine 
neurotic 
insatiability, 
and 
thus 
we 
see 
also 
in 
this 
case 
that 
the 
OEdipus-complex 
is 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
an 
especially 
arranged 
fiction, 
utilized 
as 
a 
means 
of 
expression 
for 
the 
masculine 
protest 
against 
a 
feeling 
of 
uncertainty 
and 
inferiority, 
and 
dependent 
upon 
the 
neurotic 
craving 
for 
security, 
the 
desire 
to 
possess 
everything. 


The 
inner 
contradiction 
which 
frequently 
comes 
into 
being 
in 
this 
form 
of 
masculine 
protest, 
the 
moral 
condemnation 
of 
a 
conduct 
corresponding 
to 
the 
basic 
thought 
" 
to 
possess 
everything," 
but 
also 
the 
greater 
insight 
into 
the 
impossibility 
of 
attainment 
or 
the 
fear 
of 
a 
decision 
which 
may 
assail 
the 
patient 
often 
necessitate 
a 
compromise. 
This 
may 
best 
be 
expressed 
by 
the 
words 
"half 
and 
half." 
The 
patient 
seeks 
a 
way 
out 
of 
this 
dilemma 
and 
thus 
reaches 
the 
point 
of 
"divide 
et 
impera." 
At 
times 
this 
solution 
is 
tenable, 
because 
of 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
gratification 
of 
the 
desire 
for 
dominancy. 


At 
times 
this 
leads 
to 
a 
marked 
cultural 
but 
also 
Utopian 
development 
of 
feeling 
of 
equality 
and 
love 
for 
justice.

AS

NATURE 
OF 
THE 
DELIRIUM. 
(DELIRIUM 
USED 
IN 
THE 
SENSE 
OF 
THE 
FRENCH: 
UNE 
DELIRE.) 


A 
CONSIDERATION 
which 
should 
align 
itself 
here 
endeavors 
to 
show 
how 
the 
compensating 
guiding 
idea, 
" 
to 
possess 
everything 
" 
may 
deviate 
from 
its 
straight 
course 
in 
order 
to 
stimulate 
in 
a 
roundabout 
way 
or 
by 
means 
of 
an 
artifice, 
accomplishments 
of 
a 
strangely 
neurotic, 
criminal, 
but 
also 
of 
a 
creative 
kind, 
in 
order 
to 
reach 
its 
ultimate 
good 
eventually 
and 
bring 
about 
in 
some 
way 
a 
maximation 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness 
or 
at 
least 
and 
to 
this 
extent 
the 
neurosis 
remains 
productive 
to 
prevent 
a 
degradation. 


The 
parsimony, 
penury 
and 
asceticism 
of 
certain 
neurotics 
already 
shows 
us 
such 
a 
detour 
upon 
which 
the 
patient 
permits 
himself 
to 
be 
driven 
as 
if 
he 
were 
able 
to 
avoid 
danger 
only 
in 
this 
way. 
He 
then 
behaves 
strictly 
according 
to 
these 
guiding 
ideas, 
believes 
in 
them 
and 
accentuates 
his 
abnormal 
being 
in 
moments 
of 
especial 
uncertainty 
to 
the 
point 
of 
a 
psychosis. 
In 
melancholic 
states 
when 
poverty 
phantasies 
predominate, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
hypochondriacs 
1 
the 
patient 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
the 
real 
danger, 
anticipates 
the 
feared 
state, 
endeavors 
to 
realize 
a 
fiction, 
emphasizes 
his 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
and 
utilizes 
his 
disease 
for 
the 
safeguarding 
of 
his 
ego-
consciousness. 


Cases 
exhibiting 
the 
lying-mania, 
fetichism, 
neurotic 
mania 
for 
gathering 
up 
things 
and 
kleptomania, 
also 
illustrate 
this 
craving 
to 
possess 
everything. 
Another 
evident 
trait 
exists, 
namely, 
to 
break 
through 
the 
boundaries 
laid 



down 
by 
reality 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
a 
fictitious 
guiding 
principle, 
in 
order 
to 
escape 
a 
feeling 
of 
degradation. 
Apperception 
always 
comes 
to 
light 
according 
to 
the 
rigidly 
formal 
antithesis 
of 
"manly-womanly" 
and 
frequently 
leads 
the 
patient 
to 
undertake 
accentuations 
by 
means 
of 
which 
it 
may 
be 
proved 
that 
he 
is 
a 
man. 
Sexual 
symbolism 
lends 
itself 
very 
well 
as 
a 
means 
of 
expression 
for 
this 
purpose, 
the 
solution 
of 
which 
is 
at 
times 
furnished 
by 
the 
exaggerated 
masculine 
trend 
through 
peculiar 
detours. 
Here 
belongs 
the 
neurotic 
lying, 
braggardism, 
as 
well 
as 
attempts 
to 
play 
with 
fire 
and 
love 
and 
thus 
extend 
as 
far 
as 
possible 
the 
established 
limits. 
Less 
harmful 
manifestations 
are 
pathological 
wanderlust, 
the 
expression 
of 
which 
is 
to 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
running 
away, 
in 
the 
fugues 
of 
neurotic 
and 
psychotic 
subjects. 
As 
a 
rule 
there 
exists 
in 
the 
guiding 
picture 
of 
these 
neurotics 
an 
ideal 
of 
personality, 
the 
apex 
of 
which 
it 
is 
attempted 
to 
reach 
through 
imitation 
or 
obstinate, 
negativistic 
behavior. 
The 
same 
trend, 
namely, 
to 
extend 
masculine 
cognition, 
to 
its 
very 
limits, 
is 
at 
the 
bottom 
also 
of 
the 
constant 
tendency 
to 
read 
about, 
listen 
to, 
see 
and' 
commit 
acts 
of 
a 
disgusting 
nature. 


The 
more 
pronounced 
this 
striving 
for 
worthless 
possession, 
the 
more 
normal 
tendencies 
and 
values 
are 
falsified, 
similarly 
to 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
love 
for 
nature 
is 
only 
a 
deception, 
but 
exhibited 
in 
an 
exaggerated 
manner, 
when 
a 
tourist 
wants 
to 
have 
every 
peak 
noted 
upon 
his 
mountain 
staff. 


The 
Leporelist 
shows 
us 
this 
desire 
with 
reference 
to 
love, 
and 
the 
Messalina 
is 
to 
be 
compared 
with 
Don 
Juan, 
a 
nymphomaniac 
who 
always 
imagines 
herself 
unsatiated 
and 
belittled 
because 
in 
this 
neurotic 
form 
real 
possibilities 
for 
gratification 
are 
unattainable. 
The 
fettering 
and 
degradation 
of 
the 
partner 
are 
of 
course 
taken 
into 
consideration 
in 
this 
relation. 


"Dear 
soul, 
what 
place 
can 
you 
think 
of 
where 
I 
have 
not 
been?” 


Immermann's 
Munchausen 
answers 
to 
the 
question, 
whether 
he 
knew 
a 
certain 
distant 
place. 
The 
real 
satisfaction 
in 
active 
games, 
riding, 
driving, 
racing 
and 
aviation 
originate 
from 
the 
desire 
for 
possession, 
for 
conquest. 
For 
this 
reason 
every 
child 
aspires 
to 
be 
a 
coachman, 
a 
conductor, 
a 
locomotive 
engineer 
or 
an 
aviator, 
but 
to 
no 
less 
an 
extent 
he 
wishes 
to 
be 
emperor 
or 
teacher 
in 
order 
to 
command 
his 
companions 
and 
to 
find 
a 
visible 
expression 
for 
his 
superiority, 
or 
a 
physician 
in 
order 
to 
conquer 
death 
and 
to 
extend 
the 
limits 
of 
life, 
or 
a 
general 
in 
order 
to 
lead 
an 
army 
or 
an 
admiral 
in 
order 
to 



command 
the 
sea. 
Lies, 
thefts 
and 
other 
crimes 
committed 
by 
children 
are 
manifestly 
attempts 
to 
extend 
the 
limits 
of 
power 
in 
this 
way. 
For 
the 
most 
part 
these 
attempts 
assume 
no 
more 
real 
form 
than 
that 
of 
day 
dreams 
or 
phantasies. 
An 
inquiry 
instituted 
by 
me 
in 
a 
girls' 
high 
school 
showed 
that 
all 
of 
the 
twenty-five 
girls 
remembered 
having 
committed 
trivial 
thefts. 
I 
was 
able 
to 
include 
even 
the 
teacher. 
On 
closer 
examination 
the 
motive 
for 
this 
striving 
for 
attainment 
is 
the 
intolerable 
stimulus 
arising 
from 
the 
child's 
feeling 
of 
inferiority. 
Frequently 
the 
child 
under 
this 
pressure 
is 
curious, 
eager 
to 
learn, 
seeks 
to 
recognize 
his 
faults 
and 
to 
make 
for 
himself 
a 
place 
for 
unfolding 
his 
personality. 
Defects, 
misfortunes, 
the 
feeling 
of 
uncertainty 
and 
inferiority 
often 
force 
a 
strong 
development 
of 
the 
higher 
psychic 
faculties, 
analogous 
to 
the 
compensatory 
stress 
in 
the 
organic 
compensatory 
tendency. 
Jatgeir 
says 
in 
Ibsen's 
" 
Pretender 
to 
the 
Crown," 
" 
I 
received 
the 
gift 
of 
pain 
arid 
became 
a 
skald." 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
prove 
in 
a 
number 
of 
cases 
that 
a 
particularly 
strong 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
sets 
into 
activity 
the 
impulse 
to 
investigation, 
or 
that 
the 
" 
vocation 
" 
to 
the 
life 
of 
an 
artist 
which 
later 
presents 
the 
example 
of 
a 
harmonious 
accord 
of 
art 
and 
life 
" 
began 
with 
a 
crude 
dissonance 
" 
(B. 
Litzmann, 
Clara 
Schumann). 


Another 
way 
in 
which 
children 
often 
show 
themselves 
superior 
to 
their 
parents 
has 
been 
described 
by 
me 
in 
the 
' 
Psychic 
Treatment 
of 
Trigeminal 
Neuralgia." 
This 
may 
consist 
in 
the 
following: 
From 
memory 
of 
earlier 
defects 
in 
imitation 
of 
others, 
a 
state 
of 
apparent 
stupidity, 
blindness, 
deafness, 
limping, 
stuttering, 
enuresis, 
untidiness, 
awkwardness, 
lack 
of 
appetite, 
nausea, 
etc., 
is 
retained. 
The 
psyche 
gradually 
forms 
out 
of 
these 
already 
prepared 
psychic 
habits 
which 
the 
child 
holds 
fast 
to 
as 
a 
protest 
against 
the 
feeling 
of 
being 
neglected, 
psychic 
aptitudes 
which 
in 
the 
neurosis 
following 
a 
given 
direction, 
constitute 
a 
symptom 
picture 
which 
may 
be 
stated 
as 
follows: 
Act 
as 
if 
you 
were 
obliged 
to 
shift 
for 
yourself 
by 
means 
of 
one 
of 
these 
faults, 
of 
these 
deficiencies, 
to 
gain 
through 
it 
a 
feeling 
of 
superiority. 
The 
difference 
between 
this 
and 
malingering 
often 
consists 
only 
in 
this, 
that 
in 
every 
case 
it 
is 
not 
always 
reflection 
which 
first 
calls 
up 
the 
phenomenon, 
but 
that 
the 
already 
existing 
preparedness 
for 
the 
symptom 
becomes 
embodied 
in 
the 
web 
and 
woof 
of 
memory 
as 
an 
insuring 
agent 
against 
the 
fear 
of 
being 
under-estimated 
or 
neglected, 
just 
as 
the 
technical 
skill 
in 
the 
fingers 
of 
a 
virtuoso 
is 
always 
ready 
to 
respond 
in 
the 
proper 



reaction 
to 
any 
demand. 
The 
whole 
army 
of 
neurotic 
symptoms, 
blushing, 
headache, 
migraine, 
fainting, 
pains, 
tremor, 
depression, 
exaltation, 
etc., 
may 
be 
traced 
to 
these 
ready-for-use 
psychic 
attitudes. 
One 
of 
the 
facts 
which, 
thanks 
to 
my 
method 
of 
viewing 
the 
subject, 
I 
was 
able 
to 
explain, 
concerns 
the 
less 
well 
known 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
common 
to 
all 
girls 
and 
women 
which 
is 
due 
to 
their 
feminine 
role 
in 
contrast 
to 
the 
masculine. 
Their 
soul 
life 
is 
thereby 
so 
altered 
that 
they 
constantly 
betray 
traits 
of 
the 
" 
masculine 
protest 
and 
in 
truth, 
usually 
in 
a 
circuitous 
form, 
in 
apparently 
feminine 
inferior 
traits 
such 
as 
are 
described 
in 
the 
previously 
cited 
group. 
Education 
as 
well 
as 
the 
necessary 
preparations 
for 
the 
future 
force 
them 
to 
bring 
their 
superiority 
to 
expression, 
their 
" 
masculine 
protest 
" 
in 
insidious 
ways, 
mostly 
having 
the 
character 
of 
resignation. 
The 
features 
of 
' 
Emotion 
" 
(Heyman's) 
are 
always 
sufficiently 
distinct, 
greed 
for 
power, 
envy, 
desire 
to 
please, 
inclination 
to 
cruelty 
are 
so 
apparent 
that 
they 
may 
be 
regarded 
as 
compensatory 
masculine 
traits, 
as 
directed 
towards 
a 
masculine 
goal. 
Parkes 
Weber 
(Lancet, 
1911) 
has, 
following 
me, 
discovered 
the 
foundation 
of 
hysterical 
phenomena 
in 
this 
sort 
of 
provision 
against 
under-estimation. 


Preparedness 
for 
crime 
is 
also 
to 
be 
regarded 
as 
an 
outcome 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest 
in 
persons 
whose 
compensatory 
ideal 
necessitates 
a 
fictitious 
guiding 
line 
which 
demands 
that 
the 
life, 
health, 
and 
possessions 
of 
his 
fellow 
man 
should 
be 
stripped 
of 
worth. 
In 
cases 
of 
extreme 
uncertainty 
where 
the 
deprivations, 
under-estimations, 
threaten 
loss 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
ego-
consciousness 
as 
well 
as 
where 
there 
is 
strained 
effort 
to 
" 
reach 
the 
top," 
to 
secure 
supremacy, 
such 
persons 
(whose 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
has 
sought 
compensation 
in 
emotional 
preparedness, 
in 
essential 
pursuit 
of 
the 
guiding 
line, 
by 
processes 
of 
abstraction 
from 
reality) 
will 
seek 
to 
come 
nearer 
to 
their 
ideal 
by 
a 
crime. 
D. 
A. 
Jassny, 
has 
given 
an 
excellent 
analysis 
of 
this 
mechanism 
which 
is 
manifested 
most 
clearly 
in 
emotional 
crimes, 
habitual 
crimes 
and 
crimes 
of 
negligence 
in 
women, 
in 
Gross' 
Archiv. 
f. 
Kriminalanthropologie, 
1911. 


The 
great 
importance 
of 
the 
relations 
of 
love 
in 
human 
life 
has 
as 
a 
result 
that 
the 
neurotic 
greed 
to 
possess 
everything 
enters 
regularly 
into 
the 
relations 
of 
man 
and 
wife, 
and 
there 
develops 
a 
disturbing 
tendency 
by 
introducing 
an 
inclination 
to 
disregard 
reality 
and 
causing 
the 
undertaking 
of 
enterprises 
with 
a 
view 
to 
the 
maximation 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
personal 
worth. 
It 



lies 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
neurotic 
to 
wish 
to 
diminish 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
by 
constant 
proofs 
of 
his 
superiority. 
For 
this 
reason, 
the 
person 
loved 
is 
forced 
to 
sacrifice 
his 
personality, 
to 
exist 
entirely 
through 
the 
neurotic 
who 
makes 
this 
demand, 
to 
become 
a 
means 
for 
augmenting 
the 
feeling 
of 
personal 
worth 
of 
the 
neurotic. 
A 
good 
proof 
of 
a 
real 
love 
without 
neurotic 
tendency 
would 
be 
that 
the 
person 
loved 
was 
encouraged 
to 
preserve 
his 
or 
her 
personal 
worth 
or 
when 
this 
personal 
worth 
even 
received 
support. 
Such 
cases 
are 
rare. 
In 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
sexes 
there 
arises 
nearly 
always 
an 
obstinate 
and 
selfish 
feature, 
a 
tendency 
to 
put 
to 
test, 
towards 
suspicion 
which 
constantly 
disturbs 
the 
peaceful 
marital 
relations. 
Arbitrary 
demands 
are 
the 
order 
of 
the 
day. 
One 
situation 
explains 
the 
other, 
so 
that 
the 
gist 
of 
the 
situation 
can 
always 
be 
easily 
recognized. 
It 
is 
as 
if 
both 
parties 
were 
confronted 
by 
an 
enigma 
which 
they 
endeavor 
to 
solve 
by 
every 
possible 
means. 
Analysis 
always 
reveals 
a 
fear 
of 
the 
sexual 
partner 
resulting 
from 
a 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
and 
thereby 
striving 
toward 
superiority. 


We 
have 
already 
become 
acquainted 
to 
some 
extent 
with 
the 
strivings 
by 
circuitous 
ways 
where 
there 
is 
an 
accentuated 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
in 
congenital 
defectives. 
This 
striving 
results 
in 
a 
number 
of 
neurotically 
acquired 
adaptations 
and 
certain 
traits 
of 
character 
assume 
prominence, 
so 
that 
the 
individual 
remains 
in 
close 
touch 
with 
the 
enemy. 
Perhaps 
the 
really 
most 
important 
features 
are 
distrust 
and 
jealousy, 
with 
which 
desire 
for 
mastery 
and 
disputatiousness 
are 
concurrent. 
According 
to 
the 
previous 
history 
of 
the 
patient 
and 
to 
the 
previous 
available 
practices 
as 
well 
as 
the 
neurosis 
which 
he 
can 
apply 
to 
his 
purpose, 
the 
one 
feature 
or 
the 
other 
declares 
itself 
with 
more 
or 
less 
distinctness. 
They 
all 
stand 
under 
the 
pressure 
of 
the 
fictitious 
final 
purpose 
and 
break 
forth 
when 
reduction 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
personal 
worth 
is 
threatened, 
or 
show 
that 
they 
are 
still 
effective 
when 
pride 
represses 
them 
into 
the 
unconscious. 
In 
all 
cases 
these 
individuals 
have 
at 
their 
disposal 
the 
neurotic 
adaptations, 
which 
now 
in 
the 
form 
of 
depression, 
again 
as 
anxiety 
at 
being 
left 
alone, 
as 
fear 
of 
places, 
as 
insomnia, 
and 
in 
a 
hundred 
and 
one 
other 
symptoms 
by 
means 
of 
which 
they 
seek 
to 
force 
" 
the 
opponent 
" 
to 
lay 
down 
his 
arms. 
The 
strongest 
moral 
principles 
have 
the 
same 
value 
as, 
for 
instance, 
coquetry 
and 
adultery 
as 
a 
revenge 
when 
the 
feeling 
of 
being 
under-estimated 
demands 
the 
reinstatement 
in 
equality 
or 
the 
gaining 
of 
the 
upper 
hand 
of 
the 
other 
party. 
The 
husband 
expresses 



protesting 
revengefulness 
where 
there 
is 
a 
lack 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
superiority 
by 
playing 
the 
wild 
man, 
in 
side 
leaps, 
in 
rejection, 
sometimes, 
however, 
in 
impotence, 
in 
remarkable 
protection 
of 
the 
children 
or 
doubts 
about 
their 
legitimacy,;frequently 
in 
shunning 
domesticity, 
in 
increased 
alcoholism 
or 
in 
the 
pursuit 
of 
pleasure. 
The 
purpose 
of 
this 
line 
of 
conduct 
is 
usually 
so 
obvious 
that 
it 
is 
generally 
understood. 
For 
it 
only 
then 
reaches 
its 
goal 
when 
the 
wife 
feels 
herself 
thereby 
degraded. 
The 
frequent 
delirium 
of 
jealousy 
of 
alcoholics 
is 
not 
based 
on 
the 
resulting 
impotence, 
but 
alcoholism, 
impotence 
and 
the 
increased 
jealousy 
as 
a 
trait 
of 
character 
are 
neurotic 
forms 
of 
expression 
of 
those 
predisposed 
and 
whose 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
experiences 
an 
aggravation. 
Like 
all 
other 
neurotics 
such 
an 
individual 
suffers 
from 
the 
neurotic 
apperception, 
by 
means 
of 
which 
he 
measures 
the 
distance 
of 
reality 
from 
an 
ideal 
which 
has 
been 
strengthened 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
his 
tendency. 
It 
is, 
however, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
effective 
attitudes 
of 
neurotic 
individuals 
to 
measure 
pollice 
verso 
so 
to 
speak, 
real 
human 
beings 
by 
an 
ideal, 
so 
that 
their 
value 
may 
be 
reduced 
to 
any 
desired 
extent. 
The 
revengefulness 
of 
the 
rejected 
wife 
manifests 
itself 
preferably 
in 
those 
neurotic 
symptoms 
in 
which 
frigidity 
plays 
the 
principal 
role. 
The 
purpose 
of 
this 
is 
to 
contest 
with 
the 
husband, 
the 
male 
force, 
to 
show 
him, 
even 
where 
there 
is 
perfect 
accord, 
limits 
of 
his 
power 
and 
thus 
to 
secure 
a 
considerable 
superiority. 


That 
this 
powerful 
construction 
is 
the 
result 
of 
an 
original 
feeling 
of 
deficiency 
which 
demands 
compensation 
becomes 
apparent 
from 
more 
thorough 
analysis. 
Ordinarily 
the 
apperception 
of 
an 
under-estimation 
of 
an 
analogous 
fear 
or 
of 
a 
wish 
of 
this 
nature 
takes 
place 
after 
the 
picture 
of 
the 
antithesis 
of 
" 
man 
woman," 
in 
accordance 
with 
which 
the 
maximation 
of 
the 
ego-consciousnesss 
is 
felt 
and 
valued 
as 
" 
masculine," 
the 
lowering 
as 
" 
feminine." 
Or 
instead 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
being 
under-estimated, 
in 
a 
phantasy 
or 
dream 
of 
a 
castration 
(feminine) 
a 
loss 
of 
the 
penis 
arises 
as 
a 
symbol. 
Very 
often 
the 
masculine 
guiding 
line 
which 
had 
already 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
the 
previous 
history 
penetrates 
into 
the 
neurosis 
as 
an 
essential 
or 
accessory 
component 
and 
accentuates 
the 
manly 
traits 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
ego-
consciousness 
enters 
into 
the 
question, 
a 
circumstance 
which 
as 
a 
rule 
is 
very 
striking 
in 
women. 


Aside 
from 
the 
predisposition 
to 
jealousy 
a 
large 
number 
of 
other 
symptoms 
are 
manifested 
in 
female 
neurotics, 
which 
originate 
from 
the 



adherence 
to 
the 
masculine 
guiding 
line. 
These 
symptoms 
usually 
have 
reference 
to 
love 
or 
to 
the 
sexual 
relation 
and 
claim 
may 
be 
made 
to 
many 
causes 
as 
their 
foundation, 
instead 
of 
the 
only 
right 
one, 
the 
desire 
to 
be 
a 
man, 
which 
as 
far 
as 
possible 
seeks 
realization. 
This 
inclination 
to 
love 
and 
' 
' 
manage 
' 
' 
then 
continues 
throughout 
the 
entire 
life 
or 
this 
form 
of 
the 
masculine 
guiding 
line 
develops 
in 
advanced 
years 
an 
inner 
contradiction, 
a 
fear 
of 
not 
being 
able 
to 
hold 
the 
husband, 
touches 
the 
ego-consciousness 
and 
causes 
constantly 
varying 
neurotic, 
erotic 
disturbances. 
These 
variations 
are 
dependent 
on 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
new 
guiding 
line, 
to 
win 
a 
husband, 
in 
order 
thereby 
to 
elevate 
the 
feeling 
of 
personal 
worth, 
contains 
within 
itself 
a 
contradiction: 
the 
lowering 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
personality 
by 
assuming 
the 
feminine 
role. 
In 
such 
cases 
often 
the 
neurotic 
system 
of 
indecision 
awakens 
and 
extends 
to 
the 
most 
banal 
relations 
of 
life, 
until 
the 
real 
situation 
is 
understood 
to 
depend 
upon 
the 
hermaphroditic 
attitude 
of 
the 
subject 
from 
which 
the 
impulse 
of 
indecision 
and 
doubt 
takes 
its 
source. 
Every 
decision 
calls 
up 
an 
antithetical 
reaction 
in 
the 
opposing 
consciousness 
which 
is 
then 
felt 
and 
valued 
after 
the 
antithesis 
of 
" 
man 
woman 
" 
so 
that 
the 
patient 
either 
simultaneously 
or 
in 
immediate 
sequence 
plays 
a 
feminine 
and 
then 
a 
masculine 
role. 
The 
following 
case 
may 
be 
considered 
as 
a 
visible 
example 
of 
such 
a 
condition: 


A 
girl 
30 
years 
of 
age, 
who 
earned 
her 
living 
by 
teaching, 
complained 
of 
uneasiness, 
constant 
doubt, 
insomnia 
and 
thoughts 
of 
suicide. 
Since 
the 
death 
of 
the 
father 
she 
had 
taken 
care 
of 
the 
whole 
family, 
thus 
taking 
the 
place 
of 
the 
man, 
the 
provider, 
and 
in 
her 
phantasies 
and 
dreams 
is 
a 
beast 
of 
burden, 
a 
horse 
that 
must 
draw 
all 
the 
load. 
She 
works 
until 
she 
is 
exhausted 
and 
sacrifices 
everything 
to 
her 
brother 
and 
to 
her 
sister. 
As 
far 
back 
as 
she 
can 
remember, 
she 
has 
always 
wished 
she 
had 
been 
a 
man. 
As 
a 
child, 
she 
had 
sturdy 
boyish 
traits 
and 
at 
15 
years 
of 
age 
was 
still 
mistaken 
for 
a 
boy 
at 
bathing 
places. 


Von 
Neusser 
has 
called 
attention 
to 
these 
bodily 
traits 
of 
the 
opposite 
sex 
where 
constitutional 
anomaly 
could 
be 
shown 
in 
his 
work 
on 
the 
status 
thymico-lymphaticus. 
Also 
in 
my 
work 
on 
neurology, 
I 
have 
emphasized 
the 
finding 
of 
bodily 
traits 
of 
the 
opposite 
sex 
and 
could 
prove 
concerning 
them 
that 
they 
are 
often 
made 
use 
of 
by 
neurotics, 
either 
for 
giving 
prominence 
to 
the 
inferiority 
in 
cases 
where 
the 
femininity 
is 
accentuated 
or 
for 
expressing 



the 
" 
masculine 
protest." 
The 
previous 
observations 
of 
Flies 
who 
as 
well 
as 
Halvan 
directed 
my 
attention 
to 
this 
field, 
do 
not 
take 
into 
consideration 
the 
psychic 
mechanisms 
as 
I 
understand 
them. 


In 
one 
variety, 
this 
female 
patient 
revealed 
the 
masculine 
protest 
on 
the 
very 
first 
day 
by 
refusing 
sharply, 
gratuitous 
treatment. 
She 
would 
receive 
no 
gifts, 
she 
repeated 
emphatically 
several 
times 
in 
succession 
and 
she 
subsequently 
explained 
to 
me 
in 
the 
manner 
with 
which 
I 
was 
already 
acquainted 
that 
it 
was 
unmanly 
to 
receive 
gifts. 
Therefore 
she 
had 
always 
refused 
them. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
she 
herself 
gave 
willingly, 
something 
she 
often 
practiced 
in 
the 
family 
in 
her 
role 
of 
father. 


From 
her 
history, 
I 
emphasize 
one 
incident 
as 
of 
importance. 
An 
uncle 
had 
attempted 
to 
violate 
her 
in 
her 
eighth 
year. 
In 
her 
terror, 
she 
had 
remained 
passive, 
but 
had 
never 
mentioned 
the 
attack. 
After 
her 
neurosis 
had 
made 
some 
progress, 
she 
had 
forced 
herself 
to 
the 
idea 
that 
as 
a 
child 
she 
was 
already 
a 
sinful 
creature 
and 
capable 
of 
yielding 
to 
any 
one, 
and 
that 
she 
had 
always 
remained 
the 
same. 
Thus 
we 
have 
the 
application 
of 
a 
souvenir 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
re-assurance 
with 
which 
we 
are 
already 
acquainted, 
for 
the 
course 
of 
this 
train 
of 
thought 
was 
that 
up 
to 
her 
thirtieth 
year 
of 
life 
she 
had 
yielded 
to 
all 
men. 


From 
her 
tenth 
year 
to 
the 
twenty-fifth 
year 
she 
asserted 
that 
she 
had 
practiced 
masturbation 
excessively. 
She 
developed 
therefrom 
a 
strong 
feeling 
of 
guilt, 
augmented 
the 
conviction 
of 
her 
sinfulness, 
and 
arrived 
at 
the 
conclusion 
that 
she 
had 
rendered 
herself 
eternally 
unworthy 
to 
enter 
into 
matrimony. 
This 
conviction 
was 
bound 
to 
have 
an 
extensive 
influence 
on 
her 
attitude 
toward 
men. 


The 
usual 
role 
of 
masturbation 
in 
neuroses 
is 
as 
follows, 
that 
in 
consequence 
thereof, 
a 
sensation 
of 
a 
feeling 
of 
guilt 
arises, 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
from 
the 
possibility 
of 
dispensing 
with 
a 
partner, 
the 
feeling 
of 
security 
from 
being 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
a 
partner. 
The 
analogy 
with 
those 
cases 
where 
the 
same 
security 
is 
sought 
by 
strengthening 
the 
defects 
of 
childhood, 
enuresis, 
stuttering 
or 
other 
neurotic 
symptoms 
is 
obvious. 
The 
original 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
remains 
behind 
as 
an 
echo, 
fills 
itself 
with 
phantasies 
of 
feminine 
deficiencies 
and 
feelings 
of 
guilt 
and 
forces 
the 
individual 
to 
strive 
for 
the 
manly 
guiding 
point. 
The 
conduct 
of 
our 
female 
patient 
is 
constructed 
according 
to 
the 
guiding 
line 
which 
may 
be 
expressed 
in 
the 
words, 
" 
I 
wish 



to 
be 
a 
man." 


A 
few 
years 
ago, 
a 
compulsory 
idea 
took 
hold 
of 
her 
which 
clearly 
reflects 
our 
idea 
of 
the 
neurosis. 
The 
patient 
believed 
that 
she 
had 
lost 
through 
masturbation 
a 
part 
of 
the 
genital 
region 
which 
extended 
forward 
and 
which 
according 
to 
her 
description 
seemed 
to 
her 
to 
be 
a 
penis. 
Now 
she 
had 
become 
wholly 
unfit 
for 
marriage, 
because 
she 
could 
not 
live 
through 
it 
if 
her 
husband 
should 
hear 
of 
her 
sins. 
The 
security 
seems 
to 
be 
thus 
entirely 
assured 
and 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
understand 
how 
she 
brings 
her 
fictitious 
masculine 
guiding 
principle 
as 
an 
ideal 
in 
contrast 
with 
her 
real 
femininity, 
emphasizes 
the 
latter 
and 
feels 
inferior, 
yet 
by 
this 
very 
expedient 
seeks 
to 
exempt 
herself 
from 
a 
feminine 
role 
in 
reality. 


But 
even 
this 
assurance, 
however 
strong 
it 
might 
seem, 
became 
in 
time 
insufficient 
to 
satisfy 
the 
ideal 
of 
personal 
value 
of 
our 
patient. 
Her 
female 
friends 
deserted 
her 
in 
order 
to 
marry, 
and 
when 
finally 
her 
younger 
sister 
married, 
her 
guiding 
line 
became 
no 
longer 
tenable 
because 
her 
ambition 
strove 
also 
for 
" 
mastery 
over 
men." 
She 
decided 
arbitrarily, 
as 
nervous 
girls 
with 
extreme 
indecision 
usually 
do, 
to 
take 
the 
first 
best. 
She 
went 
to 
a 
masquerade 
where 
she 
became 
acquainted 
with 
a 
worthy 
man 
who 
wished 
to 
marry 
her 
after 
a 
short 
acquaintance. 
During 
a 
trip 
she 
yielded 
to 
him 
because, 
as 
she 
said, 
she 
feared 
that 
by 
contact 
he 
might 
become 
aware 
of 
the 
defect 
of 
her 
genital 
organs 
and 
leave 
her 
disgraced 
and 
she 
would 
rather 
have 
anything 
else 
happen 
to 
her. 
When 
later 
the 
man 
in 
a 
friendly 
way 
insisted 
on 
her 
telling 
him 
if 
he 
were 
her 
first 
lover 
and 
why 
she 
had 
become 
so 
cold 
she 
threw 
him 
overboard 
with 
the 
untruthful 
explanation 
that 
she 
had 
had 
relations 
with 
other 
men. 
Thereupon 
the 
man 
broke 
off 
the 
affair. 


It 
is 
easy 
to 
imagine 
what 
now 
followed. 
The 
patient 
who 
was 
already 
constantly 
grieving 
over 
another 
loss 
than 
that 
of 
her 
masculinity, 
beheld 
herself 
thwarted 
and 
deprived 
of 
her 
new 
masculine 
triumph. 
She 
recalled 
her 
lie 
which, 
as 
she 
sought 
to 
explain 
to 
me 
later, 
she 
had 
told 
in 
order 
to 
punish 
the 
man 
for 
having 
conquered 
her, 
in 
order 
to 
deprive 
him 
of 
worth. 
She 
explained 
to 
him 
the 
facts, 
but 
he 
withdrew 
entirely, 
for 
the 
most 
part 
from 
fear 
of 
further 
discords 
in 
a 
marriage 
with 
this 
neurotic 
girl. 
Thereupon 
our 
patient 
became 
passionately 
in 
love 
with 
him, 
made 
a 
god 
of 
him, 
passed 
sleepless 
nights 
in 
thoughts 
of 
him, 
and 
took 
an 
oath 
to 
have 
him 
or 
no 
other 
husband, 
for 
this 
one 
was 
in 
all 
human 
probability 
lost 
to 
her. 
Thus 
by 
means 



of 
various 
expedients 
of 
her 
neurosis 
she 
had 
returned 
to 
her 
original 
guiding 
line, 
and 
had 
gained 
a 
fictitious 
ideal 
and 
up 
to 
the 
time 
of 
her 
treatment, 
had 
succeeded 
in 
avoiding 
the 
feminine 
role. 


In 
psychotherapeutic 
treatment, 
special 
attention 
should 
be 
given 
to 
prevent 
this 
blindly 
working 
tendency 
to 
depreciation 
of 
the 
patient 
from 
making 
the 
physician 
himself 
a 
victim, 
as 
the 
condition 
of 
disease 
is 
regularly 
used 
as 
a 
means 
of 
depriving 
the 
psychotherapeutist 
of 
his 
worth. 
The 
patient 
may 
do 
this 
by 
following 
the 
ordinary 
direction 
which 
his 
disease 
takes 
only 
with 
a 
sharper 
tone, 
because 
he 
strengthens 
the 
symptoms, 
or 
originates 
new 
ones, 
and 
tries 
to 
supply 
tense 
relations, 
frequently 
also 
situations 
of 
love 
and 
friendship, 
but 
always 
with 
the 
intention 
(which 
is 
the 
result 
of 
his 
neurotic 
tendency, 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest) 
of 
becoming 
master 
of 
the 
physician, 
of 
giving 
him 
a 
setback, 
of 
making 
him 
play 
a 
"feminine" 
part, 
of 
annihilating 
his 
worth. 
The 
tactical 
and 
pedagogic 
expedients 
to 
which 
one 
is 
obliged 
to 
resort 
in 
order 
to 
weaken 
this 
struggle 
of 
the 
patient 
against 
the 
physician, 
in 
order 
to 
render 
it 
comprehensible 
and 
in 
order 
to 
demonstrate 
in 
this 
way 
the 
neurotic 
conduct 
or 
attitude 
of 
the 
patient 
in 
life 
generally, 
become 
an 
important 
factor 
in 
the 
therapeusis. 
The 
silent 
protest 
of 
the 
neurotic 
should 
not 
however 
be 
undervalued, 
and 
one 
should 
be 
on 
the 
lookout 
for 
it 
to 
the 
very 
end 
of 
the 
treatment, 
laying 
special 
stress 
upon 
it 
towards 
its 
termination. 
It 
should 
be 
viewed 
with 
quiet, 
objective 
composure, 
as 
the 
matter-of-fact 
aggressiveness 
of 
the 
patient 
and 
as 
having 
the 
same 
value 
as 
has 
the 
neurosis, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
furnishes 
the 
neurotic 
predispositions 
and 
traits. 
Freud's 
hypothesis 
of 
transference 
will 
be 
referred 
to 
again 
later. 
It 
is 
nothing 
more 
than 
an 
expedient 
of 
the 
patient 
who 
seeks 
to 
rob 
the 
physician 
of 
superiority. 
Bezzola 
and 
others 
have 
described 
the 
circuitous 
ways 
in 
which 
the 
neurotic 
patient 
seeks 
to 
deprive 
physicians 
of 
their 
value. 
It 
is 
always 
the 
masculine 
guiding 
line 
which 
is 
revealed, 
the 
purpose 
of 
which 
is 
to 
assure 
the 
patient's 
superiority. 
The 
most 
usual 
manner 
of 
enhancing 
his 
tendency 
to 
aggression, 
the 
neurotic 
finds 
by 
holding 
fast 
to 
his 
symptoms, 
because 
these 
in 
themselves 
present 
a 
phase 
of 
his 
aggressive 
tendency. 


An 
extract 
from 
a 
history 
of 
a 
patient 
shortly 
before 
the 
end 
of 
her 
treatment 
reveals 
(in 
the 
form 
of 
an 
unfriendly 
impulse) 
this 
effort 
to 
deprive 
the 
physician 
of 
value 
as 
a 
psychic 
predisposition 
of 
her 
" 
masculine 
protest." 
The 
patient 
was 
placed 
under 
treatment 
because 
of 
an 
anxiety 
and 
was 
crying 



out 
at 
night. 
She 
was 
a 
virgin, 
36 
years 
of 
age. 
I 
will 
begin 
the 
description 
of 
this 
neurotic 
picture 
with 
the 
following 
dream: 


"I 
was 
lying 
at 
your 
feet 
and 
reached 
upward 
with 
my 
hand 
trying 
to 
grasp 
your 
clothes 
which 
were 
silk. 
You 
made 
a 
lascivious 
gesture, 
whereupon 
I 
said 
laughingly, 
' 
You 
are 
then 
no 
better 
than 
the 
other 
men!' 
You 
confirmed 
this 
with 
a 
nod." 


Those 
who, 
following 
Freud's 
interpretation 
of 
dreams, 
place 
the 
sexual 
wish-motive 
in 
the 
foreground, 
will 
not 
be 
at 
a 
loss 
for 
an 
interpretation; 
the 
requirements 
for 
a 
sexual 
basis 
for 
the 
dream 
were 
fully 
supplied. 
The 
requirements 
could 
also 
be 
complied 
with, 
as 
the 
patient 
had 
already 
done, 
by 
bringing 
forward 
a 
reminiscence 
from 
childhood, 
when 
she 
solicited 
her 
father 
in 
a 
similar 
manner; 
her 
neurotic 
tendency 
to 
attain 
security 
had 
indeed 
carefully 
collected 
all 
admonitory 
experiences, 
in 
order 
to 
use 
the 
man 
in 
an 
"anaphylactic 
" 
manner 
against 
repetitions. 
Indeed, 
one 
could 
easily 
get 
the 
assent 
of 
the 
patient 
to 
ascribe 
to 
repressed 
impulses 
of 
the 
will 
the 
emergence 
of 
souvenirs 
of 
like 
tendency 
and 
the 
present 
experiences. 
For 
her 
neurotic 
psyche 
sees 
such 
exaggerations 
as 
real 
remembrances 
and 
makes 
them 
her 
basis 
of 
operation, 
which 
she 
does 
by 
affirming 
her 
conviction 
of 
inferiority, 
of 
her 
fault, 
of 
her 
sin, 
of 
her 
too 
feminine 
nature, 
in 
order 
to 
defend 
with 
greater 
vehemence 
her 
superiority, 
her 
manliness 
and 
to 
increase 
her 
foresight. 
This 
increased 
masculine 
protest, 
however, 
which 
has 
its 
source 
in 
the 
defective 
perspective 
of 
the 
patient 
who 
is 
overfearful, 
can 
not 
but 
naturally 
increase 
the 
neurosis. 
The 
destruction 
of 
this 
false 
perspective 
first 
(the 
foundation 
of 
the 
neurotic 
apperception), 
and 
the 
damming 
up 
of 
the 
fictitious 
influx 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
and 
finally 
a 
right 
understanding 
of 
the 
superstitious 
faith 
in 
an 
abstract 
guiding 
line 
and 
the 
apotheosis 
of 
the 
same 
are 
the 
levers 
which 
must 
be 
used 
to 
remove 
neurosis. 


Our 
patient 
had 
begun 
a 
liaison 
with 
a 
married 
man 
about 
the 
time 
of 
this 
dream. 
When 
he 
pressed 
himself 
upon 
her 
and 
invited 
her 
to 
his 
.house 
during 
his 
wife's 
absence 
at 
a 
watering 
place, 
she 
was 
troubled 
with 
all 
sorts 
of 
scruples, 
which 
I 
strengthened 
considerably. 
Nevertheless, 
she 
justified 
the 
relation 
and 
"played 
with 
the 
fire" 
because 
she 
said 
the 
impatient 
writhing 
of 
the 
man 
amused 
her. 
Incidentally, 
her 
way 
of 
regarding 
the 
subject 
was 
an 
inimical 
act 
directed 
against 
her 
relatives 
and 
against 
me 
her 
monitor. 
Her 
own 
understanding 
could 
be 
interpreted 
as 
a 
reasonable 
excuse. 
But 
the 



previous 
history 
of 
the 
patient, 
and 
her 
conduct 
during 
her 
illness 
which 
lasted 
twenty 
years, 
and 
during 
her 
treatment, 
showed 
plainly 
that 
she 
was 
strongly 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
and 
that 
she 
could 
have 
demanded 
the 
subjugation 
of 
the 
man, 
but 
that 
she 
must 
have 
refused 
to 
play 
a 
feminine 
role 
(she 
suffered 
from 
anxiety 
states 
and 
crying 
out 
in 
terror 
at 
night). 
The 
central 
point 
of 
her 
psychic 
attitude 
consisted 
in 
fear 
of 
the 
man 
to 
whom 
she 
believed 
she 
was 
not 
equal, 
a 
fear 
which 
she 
sought 
to 
compensate 
by 
her 
own 
masculine 
bearing 
and 
by 
the 
lower 
estimation 
of 
men. 


After 
this 
information 
concerning 
the 
patient, 
we 
could 
venture 
to 
interpret 
the 
dream. 
She 
exaggerated 
her 
physical 
dependence 
on 
me 
and 
gave 
this 
conviction 
form 
by 
clothing 
it 
in 
a 
dream 
image 
which 
is 
admirably 
suited 
for 
this 
purpose. 
"As 
though 
I 
lay 
at 
your 
feet." 
This 
being 
" 
below 
" 
was 
taken 
as 
a 
basis 
of 
operation 
and 
we 
could 
rightly 
expect 
that 
the 
manly 
impetus 
would 
follow 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
fictitious 
feminine 
role. 
She 
reached 
upwards 
with 
the 
hands. 
The 
contamination 
contained 
my 
deprivation 
of 
masculinity. 
I 
wore 
a 
silk 
dress. 
The 
same 
psychic 
mechanism 
hovers 
in 
the 
remaining 
part 
of 
the 
dream. 
I 
had 
admonished 
the 
patient 
in 
the 
dream 
I 
made 
a 
lascivious 
gesture 
of 
which 
the 
seducer 
had 
been 
guilty, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
that 
I 
am 
on 
the 
same 
level, 
" 
I 
also 
am 
not 
better 
than 
the 
other 
men." 
Besides 
this 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
idea 
further, 
I 
was 
silent 
and 
showed 
assent 
by 
a 
gesture 
in 
the 
dream. 
The 
opposite 
thought 
that 
I 
could 
be 
better 
is 
insupportable 
to 
the 
patient; 
from 
it, 
which 
gives 
me 
a 
sort 
of 
superiority, 
originates 
the 
preventative 
dream 
fiction 
constructed 
after 
the 
neurotic 
perspective. 
The 
patient 
only 
felt 
secure 
when 
all 
men 
were 
alike 
bad. 
Then 
she 
is 
following 
her 
old 
guiding 
line 
and 
feels 
superior. 
Her 
superiority 
is 
reflected 
by 
her 
laughing 
in 
the 
dream 
as 
well 
as 
by 
my 
silence. 


The 
circumstance 
that 
she 
began 
this 
first 
dangerous 
liasion 
with 
a 
married 
man 
is 
worthy 
of 
attention. 
In 
all 
similar 
cases, 
such 
a 
relation 
may 
be 
recognized 
as 
an 
effort 
to 
obtain 
security 
from 
marriage, 
usually 
also 
from 
sexual 
relations. 
The 
masculine 
guiding 
line 
is 
preserved, 
but 
reality 
asserts 
itself 
by 
feminine 
excitements 
and 
emotions. 
It 
is 
as 
I 
have 
frequently 
pointed 
out, 
a 
masculine 
protest 
made 
with 
feminine 
means 
which 
recalls 
to 
me 
the 
fact 
of 
psychic 
hermaphroditism. 
Finally, 
too, 
the 
superiority 
over 
the 
lawful 
wife 
asserts 
itself 
in 
the 
three-cornered 
arrangement, 
something 
which 
in 
all 



analogous 
cases 
strengthens 
to 
an 
unusual 
degree 
the 
motive 
force. 


If 
we 
now 
proceed 
as 
it 
were 
to 
a 
comparative 
psychology 
and 
wish 
to 
bring 
to 
conscious 
expression 
the 
component 
parts 
of 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
apperception 
of 
this 
patient 
and 
put 
the 
question 
before 
us, 
whence 
these 
psychic 
preparations 
which 
lead 
to 
the 
attempt 
of 
unmanning 
the 
man 
by 
feminine 
means 
in 
order 
to 
enhance 
thereby 
her 
feeling 
of 
worth 
in 
a 
masculine 
direction 
and 
to 
surpass 
a 
woman's, 
the 
answer 
is: 
From 
her 
relation 
to 
her 
father 
and 
mother. 
There 
she 
derived 
the 
preparation 
to 
approach 
the 
father 
with 
love 
and 
esteem 
as 
a 
guiding 
ideal, 
learned 
to 
master 
him 
and 
had 
thus 
shown 
herself 
superior 
to 
the 
mother. 
If 
one 
abstracts 
the 
masculine 
protest 
of 
the 
neurotic 
child 
and 
if 
one 
apperceives 
these 
conditions 
(as 
neurotics 
often 
do) 
in 
a 
sexual 
scheme 
the 
" 
incest 
complex 
" 
remains. 
One 
can 
now, 
as 
I 
have 
shown 
in 
former 
works, 
take 
out 
of 
the 
incest 
complex 
again 
what 
the 
masculine 
guiding 
line 
has 
placed 
in 
it, 
namely, 
the 
assurance 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
personal 
worth 
under 
the 
title 
of 
an 
amative 
condition. 
In 
the 
literature 
on 
psycho-analysis, 
the 
assertion 
emerges 
constantly 
that 
the 
libido 
of 
the 
neurotic 
is 
fixed 
on 
the 
father 
or 
on 
the 
mother, 
on 
which 
account 
he 
seeks 
similar 
amative 
conditions 
which 
are 
in 
reality 
that 
which 
was 
loved 
in 
the 
parents. 
The 
" 
will 
to 
power 
and 
to 
seem 
" 
constitutes 
the 
only 
amative 
condition 
and 
this 
guiding 
point 
the 
neurotic 
seeks 
with 
all 
caution, 
but 
invariably, 
with 
all 
his 
practiced 
preventive 
precautions 
which 
have 
originated 
from 
and 
have 
exclusive 
value 
from 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
and 
which 
resist 
any 
change. 
The 
significance 
of 
the 
amative 
feeling 
is 
no 
other 
than 
the 
assurance 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness, 
and 
with 
this 
the 
exclusive 
influence 
of 
the 
same 
further 
betrays 
that 
the 
motive 
force 
there 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
masculine 
protest 
which 
has 
already 
constructed 
the 
incest 
constellation. 
Where, 
as 
in 
many 
cases, 
the 
attachment 
to 
one 
of 
the 
parents 
is 
clearly 
obvious, 
it 
is 
contracted 
with 
a 
purpose,(*in 
accordance 
with 
the 
life-plan, 
the 
finale) 
arranged 
in 
order 
to 
escape 
decisions 
concerning 
other 
partners, 
to 
escape 
marriage. 
Then 
usually 
the 
neurotic 
has 
destroyed 
the 
tendency 
to 
love 
and 
marriage 
as 
inconsistent 
with 
the 
masculine 
final 
purpose, 
or 
has 
not 
developed 
it. 


The 
original 
of 
the 
"three-cornered 
situation," 
the 
incest 
situation, 
resolves 
itself 
on 
closer 
examination 
into 
an 
affair 
caused 
by 
the 
megalomania 
of 
the 
child 
who 
already 
reveals 
all 
the 
characteristics 
of 
one 



predisposed 
to 
neurosis, 
i.e., 
envy, 
obstinacy, 
insatiableness, 
precocity. 
Without 
the 
sexual 
appetite 
really 
taking 
part 
therein, 
thoughts 
and 
reflections 
of 
the 
child 
may 
come 
to 
light 
which 
are 
later 
valued 
and 
represented 
as 
sexual 
when 
the 
neurotic 
tendency 
to 
gain 
security 
seeks 
to 
make 
such 
a 
connection. 
" 
I 
was 
already 
as 
a 
child, 
so 
beyond 
bounds, 
so 
culpable, 
my 
sexual 
appetite 
was 
so 
strong, 
I 
have 
such 
a 
criminal 
tendency, 
I 
am 
so 
much 
the 
slave 
of 
love," 
these 
are 
the 
echoes 
in 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
adult 
neurotic. 
“Therefore 
I 
must 
be 
careful." 
The 
impulse 
to 
hold 
certain 
appropriate 
memories, 
to 
falsifications 
of 
memory, 
to 
exaggerating 
traces 
of 
memories 
arises 
from 
a 
fear 
of 
a 
defeat 
in 
lire. 
And 
where 
the 
sexual 
appetite 
has 
really 
been 
revealed, 
where 
the 
possibility 
of 
incest 
really 
existed, 
the 
memory 
is 
preserved 
as 
an 
admonitory 
sign. 
That 
which 
diverts 
the 
neurotic 
psyche 
is 
not 
memory 
or 
reminiscence, 
but 
the 
fictitious 
final 
purpose 
which 
has 
derived 
profitable 
situations 
therefrom. 
It 
is 
nearly 
the 
same 
if 
these 
reminiscences 
have 
been 
repressed 
by 
the 
conscious 
ego, 
thrust 
back 
into 
the 
unconscious. 
The 
neurotic 
character 
and 
the 
other 
psychic 
gestures 
with 
their 
unconscious 
mechanism 
are 
none 
the 
less 
opposed 
to 
disposition 
in 
proper 
order 
in 
reality. 


Thus 
it 
was 
in 
the 
case 
of 
our 
female 
patient. 
She 
related, 
for 
example, 
that 
she 
always 
wished 
to 
win 
the 
father 
to 
her 
side 
and 
that 
she 
accomplished 
this 
by 
carefully 
falling 
in 
with 
his 
train 
of 
thought 
and 
his 
wishes. 
It 
was 
not 
difficult 
to 
leave 
her 
mother. 
From 
the 
age 
of 
fourteen, 
she 
began 
to 
refuse 
to 
kiss 
him 
because 
she 
began 
to 
feel 
a 
peculiar 
erotic 
emotion. 
In 
explanation 
of 
this, 
I 
might 
add 
that 
the 
patient 
had 
from 
her 
twelfth 
year 
manifested 
unmistakable 
signs 
of 
a 
neurosis. 
Her 
situation 
at 
that 
time 
permits 
us 
to 
understand 
the 
significance 
of 
this 
attempt 
at 
security 
through 
the 
construction 
of 
erotic 
preparations. 
She 
had 
always 
been 
an 
unruly, 
boyish 
creature 
who 
had 
already 
learned 
to 
feel 
the 
force 
of 
the 
sexual 
appetite 
and 
for 
some 
time 
had 
already 
practiced 
masturbation. 
About 
this 
time 
also, 
men 
began 
to 
make 
advances 
to 
her 
to 
which 
she 
reacted 
with 
extreme 
anxiety. 
Her 
craving 
for 
security 
had 
progressed 
so 
far 
that 
the 
patient 
had 
strengthened 
the 
anxiety 
preparedness 
which 
had 
been 
constructed 
out 
of 
real 
emotions 
of 
anxiety 
which 
she 
had 
originally 
felt, 
and 
now 
she 
was 
able, 
whenever 
she 
feared 
a 
defeat 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
being 
obliged 
to 
play 
a 
feminine 
role, 
any 
possible 
cause 
of 
which 
she 
was 
on 
the 
alert 
to 



anticipate, 
to 
develop 
in 
a 
hallucinatory 
manner, 
a 
condition 
of 
anxiety, 
so 
to 
speak, 
to 
discount 
it, 
such 
as 
would 
have 
corresponded 
for 
example 
to 
the 
eventuality 
of 
pregnancy. 
This 
anticipation 
and 
hallucinatory 
awakening 
of 
sensations 
which 
correspond 
to 
a 
fear 
of 
defeat 
which 
might 
arise 
in 
the 
future 
are 
the 
work 
of 
the 
preventive 
craving 
for 
security 
and 
constitute, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
emphasized, 
(Siphilidophobia, 
loc. 
Cit) 
the 
essential 
part 
of 
hypochondria, 
of 
phobia 
and 
of 
numerous 
neurasthenic 
and 
hysterical 
symptoms. 
I 
will 
only 
state 
briefly 
here 
that 
the 
essential 
part 
of 
a 
psychosis, 
too, 
depends 
upon 
a 
similar 
dogmatic 
anticipatory 
representation 
of 
a 
fear 
or 
a 
wish, 
which 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
offers 
for 
the 
better 
testimony 
in 
a 
phase 
of 
great 
insecurity, 
in 
strong 
dependence 
on 
the 
fictitious 
guiding 
line 
for 
the 
conservation 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness. 
When 
our 
patient 
foresaw 
a 
loss 
of 
prestige 
and 
provided 
against 
it 
by 
a 
condition 
of 
anxiety 
in 
a 
hallucinatory 
manner 
she 
felt 
most 
secure 
against 
it. 
At 
times, 
the 
hallucinatory 
emotion 
needed 
a 
further 
strengthening, 
then 
the 
patient 
arrived 
at 
the 
compulsory 
idea 
that 
she 
had 
killed 
a 
new 
born 
child. 
In 
the 
analysis 
this 
idea 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
man, 
at 
times 
a 
place 
anxiety, 
was 
shown 
to 
be 
connected 
with 
an 
admonition 
of 
her 
mother's. 
This 
signifies 
that 
the 
patient 
rescued 
from 
her 
memories 
even 
the 
words 
of 
her 
mother 
whom 
she 
constantly 
fought 
against, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
these 
words 
were 
adapted 
to 
her 
tendency 
to 
seek 
security. 
(*Along 
with 
this 
the 
mother 
should 
also 
be 
at 
fault 
with 
her 
apodictic 
threats.) 


Among 
these 
preparatory 
conditions 
an 
event 
occurred 
which 
favored 
greatly 
the 
hardy 
construction 
of 
these 
preparations 
for 
security. 
One 
of 
her 
cousins 
gave 
birth 
to 
a 
child 
out 
of 
wedlock, 
a 
fact 
which, 
in 
a 
family 
of 
respectable 
middle-class 
people, 
caused 
the 
greatest 
excitement, 
especially 
as 
the 
seducer 
shook 
the 
dust 
of 
the 
place 
from 
his 
feet. 
Our 
growing 
understanding 
for 
the 
development 
of 
this 
girl 
permits 
us 
to 
understand 
why 
this 
event 
must 
have 
accelerated 
the 
development 
of 
the 
neurosis 
and 
how 
it 
came 
that 
the 
words 
of 
the 
mother 
to 
whom 
she 
ordinarily 
showed 
little 
attention 
were 
given 
such 
importance. 
The 
patient 
was 
from 
her 
early 
childhood 
wild 
and 
boyish 
and 
of 
great 
strength, 
preferred 
boys' 
games 
and 
avoided 
every 
feminine 
emotion. 
She 
can 
still 
remember 
with 
what 
vehemence 
she 
refused 
to 
play 
with 
dolls 
or 
to 
engage 
in 
needlework. 
The 
personality 
of 
the 
father 
preponderated 
over 
that 
of 
the 
mother 
to 
a 



remarkable 
degree. 
An 
unmarried 
aunt 
who 
lived 
with 
the 
family 
of 
our 
patient 
took 
pleasure 
in 
her 
masculine 
manners, 
had 
a 
beardlike 
growth 
of 
hair 
and 
a 
masculine 
voice. 
To 
this 
strong 
and 
constantly 
recurring 
memory 
was 
associated 
another 
event 
of 
later 
occurrence 
and 
which 
furnished 
the 
necessary 
resonance 
to 
the 
dominating 
tendency 
of 
the 
patient 
to 
wish 
to 
become 
a 
man. 
She 
remembered 
that 
one 
of 
her 
fellow 
scholars 
with 
whom 
she 
had 
long 
been 
associated 
a 
pseudo 
hermaphrodite 
was 
changed 
into 
a 
man. 
These 
and 
similar 
communications 
for 
example, 
the 
special 
interest 
for 
hermaphroditism, 
are 
sufficient 
according 
to 
my 
experience 
for 
the 
preliminary 
assumption 
that 
patients 
of 
this 
sort 
wish 
to 
divest 
themselves 
of 
the 
appearance 
of 
femininity, 
and 
wish 
to 
assume 
masculine 
characteristics, 
as 
though 
they 
fully 
believed 
in 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
metamorphosis 
and 
that 
they 
invariably 
make 
an 
attempt 
to 
push 
forward 
to 
the 
manly 
role 
which 
is 
considered 
by 
them 
to 
be 
the 
higher. 
Among 
these 
attempts 
to 
change 
fate 
two 
interest 
us 
particularly 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
neurotic 
character 
and 
the 
neurotic 
preparations 
in 
the 
form 
of 
the 
neuroses 
and 
their 
symptoms. 


As 
a 
trait 
of 
character 
which 
is 
not 
rare 
with 
such 
patients, 
I 
may 
cite 
the 
tendency 
to 
expose 
nakedness, 
and 
indeed 
in 
childhood 
or 
in 
later 
years, 
in 
dreams, 
in 
phantasy 
or 
in 
neurotic 
attacks 
during 
which 
they 
tear 
the 
clothes 
from 
the 
body 
as 
though 
they 
would 
divest 
themselves 
of 
the 
modesty 
which 
they 
regard 
as 
feminine, 
as 
though 
they 
wished 
to 
make 
a 
parade 
of 
fictitious 
large 
masculine 
genital 
organs 
and 
thus 
belittle 
others. 
It 
may 
be 
seen 
from 
these 
cases 
how 
one 
perversion, 
that 
of 
exhibitionism, 
does 
not 
originate 
from 
a 
congenital 
sexual 
constitution, 
but 
that 
the 
neurosis 
which 
seeks 
to 
secure 
the 
egoconsciousness 
is 
impelled 
to 
suppress 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
to 
overcome 
it 
because 
in 
this 
neurosis 
the 
lively 
desire 
to 
be 
a 
complete 
man, 
to 
be 
of 
great 
account, 
finds 
expression. 
The 
sexual 
jargon 
is 
there 
in 
merely 
a 
form 
of 
expression 
an 
"as-if 
" 
of 
the 
sexual 
content 
of 
the 
thought 
or 
want, 
only 
a 
symbol 
of 
the 
scheme 
of 
life. 


Also 
the 
feminine, 
exaggerated 
modesty 
of 
such 
patients 
is 
an 
expedient 
in 
the 
opposite 
direction 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
deceiving 
concerning 
the 
lack 
of 
masculinity 
(Adler: 
The 
masculine 
attitude 
in 
female, 
neurotics, 
etc.) 


The 
absence 
of 
modesty 
in 
such 
cases 
answers 
for 
the 
desired 
masculinity, 
is 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
and 
more 
marked 
immodesty 
points 
invariably 
to 
disquieting 
dreams 
or 
thoughts 
concerning 
curtailed 
genital 



organs 
and 
hence 
releases 
feelings 
of 
protest 
of 
a 
masculine 
nature 
which 
considerably 
strengthen 
the 
line 
of 
ambition, 
of 
the 
desire 
to 
be 
first, 
to 
possess 
everything, 
of 
obstinacy. 
In 
the 
further 
development 
of 
the 
neurosis 
the 
desire 
for 
mastery 
and 
for 
conquest 
as 
well 
as 
the 
tendency 
to 
deprive 
others 
of 
worth 
may 
assert 
itself 
in 
the 
form 
of 
castration 
phantasies 
and 
their 
rationalization 
(Jones). 
The 
inclination 
to 
disarm 
the 
partner, 
to 
constantly 
feel 
the 
assurance 
of 
superiority 
which 
regularly 
constitutes 
the 
content 
of 
exhibitionism 
are 
often 
met 
with. 
At 
times, 
the 
lack 
of 
neatness 
and 
indecency 
in 
girls 
may 
be 
interpreted 
as 
a 
trace 
of 
the 
desire 
for 
masculinity. 


All 
of 
these 
traits 
of 
character 
although 
they 
at 
times 
seemed 
contradictory 
were 
all 
active 
in 
one 
direction 
toward 
the 
fictitious 
final 
goal 
in 
this 
patient. 
It 
was 
not 
difficult 
to 
discover 
a 
period 
of 
uncertainty 
in 
her 
early 
childhood 
as 
preliminary 
to 
her 
affectation 
of 
masculine 
traits, 
where 
she, 
because 
of 
lack 
of 
insight, 
misled 
by 
boyish 
traits 
and 
her 
compensatory 
ambition, 
cherished 
the 
hope 
of 
metamorphosing 
herself 
at 
some 
future 
time 
into 
a 
man. 
This 
final 
purpose 
of 
developing 
from 
a 
hermaphroditic 
condition 
to 
a 
male 
is 
easy 
to 
perceive 
if 
her 
boyish 
characteristics 
are 
understood 
as 
preparations 
for 
her 
fictitious 
final 
goal. 
Here 
also 
belongs 
her 
inclination 
to 
put 
on 
boys' 
clothes, 
a 
phenomenon 
which 
as 
with 
Hirschfeld's 
' 
Transvertiter 
" 
flows 
from 
the 
psychic 
dynamic 
just 
described. 
Her 
ideal 
was 
_ 
particularly 
distinct 
in 
the 
phantasies 
and 
day 
dreams 
of 
her 
childhood. 
Influenced 
by 
fairy 
stories 
and 
myths 
(" 
Dwarf 
Nose," 
" 
Thousand 
and 
One 
Nights," 
etc.) 
she 
imagined 
the 
most 
varied 
changes 
went 
on 
in 
her, 
sometimes 
believed 
herself 
changed 
into 
a 
Nix 
or 
mermaid, 
in 
which 
form 
a 
fish 
tail 
terminated 
the 
lower 
parts 
of 
the 
body, 
which 
is 
indicative 
of 
the 
peculiar 
sense. 
At 
this 
time 
a 
distinct 
neurotic 
symptom 
set 
in, 
in 
this 
connection; 
she 
could 
not 
walk 
at 
time?, 
as 
if, 
instead 
of 
legs, 
she 
had 
a 
fish 
tail. 
Also 
a 
shoe 
fetichism 
in 
this 
connection 
showed 
the 
masculine 
tendency 
and 
developed 
in 
the 
form 
that 
she 
insisted 
on 
wearing 
large 
shoes, 
we 
might 
say 
masculine 
shoes, 
because 
her 
feet 
hurt. 
From 
Ovid's 
Metamorphosis 
which 
in 
her 
rage 
for 
reading 
soon 
fell 
into 
her 
hands, 
she 
borrowed 
another 
fiction 
which 
emerged 
during 
her 
treatment 
in 
her 
dreams; 
she 
imagined 
she 
had 
been 
metamorphosed 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
the 
lower 
part 
of 
her 
body 
became 
a 
firmly 
rooted 
trunk. 
In 
this 
and 
in 
similar 
ways, 
she 
gave 
to 
herself 
the 
answer 
to 
the 
question 
concerning 
her 
future 
sexual 
role. 



We 
shall 
not 
be 
surprised 
to 
find 
that 
in 
this 
and 
similar 
cases,, 
the 
attitude 
towards 
woman 
was 
also 
influenced 
by 
the 
masculine 
final 
goal. 
In 
the 
preparations 
for 
the 
future 
the 
amative 
and 
sexual 
relations 
must 
have 
had 
a 
place 
and 
therefore 
we 
soon 
find 
our 
patient 
assuming 
the 
ideal 
masculine 
role 
of 
protector 
to 
a 
younger 
and 
weaker 
sister. 
Furthermore, 
there 
were 
sadistic 
acts 
towards 
little 
girls 
and 
servants, 
but 
also 
towards 
little, 
girlish 
boys. 
Thus 
we 
find 
in 
the 
masculine 
guiding 
line 
of 
the 
patient 
an 
intermixture 
of 
secondary 
features, 
auxiliary 
traits 
of 
homosexuality* 
and 
masculine 
sadism, 
whose 
arrangement 
resulted 
from 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
masculine 
predispositions 
and 
which 
is 
the 
only 
possible 
substitute 
if 
masculine 
sexuality 
were 
selected 
by 
her 
neurotic 
apperception 
from 
the 
impressions 
of 
life. 


* 
Moll 
has 
emphasized 
sharply 
the 
frequent 
association 
of 
homosexuality 
with 
exhibitionism. 
Our 
discussion 
reveals 
the 
inner 
relationship. 
Both 
perverse 
tendencies 
are 
expressions 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
As 
will 
be 
shown, 
both 
of 
these 
perversions 
are 
circuitous 
ways 
and 
expedients, 
secondary 
guiding 
lines 
which 
grow 
out 
of 
the 
exaggerated 
masculine 
protest. 
The 
question 
concerning 
a 
constitutional 
tendency 
to 
perversions 
is 
wholly 
irrelevant, 
because 
the 
neurosis 
seeking 
assurance 
and 
choosing 
its 
material 
in 
conformity 
with 
this 
tendency 
can 
fasten 
upon 
the 
most 
harmless 
relations, 
lend 
to 
them 
proportions 
and 
value 
which 
may 
become 
immeasurable 
in 
so 
far 
as 
the 
neurosis 
requires 
this 
by 
exaggerating 
them 
and 
lending 
them 
high 
values. 


One 
day 
as 
the 
patient, 
now 
fourteen 
years 
of 
age, 
was 
accosted 
by 
a 
man 
on 
the 
stairs 
who 
made 
advances 
to 
her, 
an 
insane 
idea 
developed 
on 
this 
foundation 
which 
is 
easy 
to 
see 
through. 
She 
imagined 
herself 
for 
many 
months 
the 
murderer 
of 
domestic 
servants 
(Hugo 
Schenk) 
and 
thus" 
by 
means 
of 
extreme 
abstractions 
which 
were 
introduced 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
security, 
she 
effected 
an 
interlacing 
of 
her 
masculine, 
her 
homosexual 
and 
her 
sadistic 
fiction, 
while 
she 
brought 
them 
to 
more 
distinct 
expression 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
held 
herself 
in 
anticipation 
of 
an 
event 
which 
she 
feared. 
These 
three 
conditions, 
mere 
abstractions 
from 
reality, 
strengthening 
of 
guiding 
lines 
leading 
to 
masculinity 
and 
upwards, 
and 
anticipation 
of 
the 
directing 
ideal 
mostly 
in 
a 
disguised 
form, 
are 
the 
fundamental 
components 
of 
the 
psychotic 



construction. 


The 
role 
of 
indigenous 
and 
exogenous 
poisons 
consists 
in 
many 
cases 
in 
the 
circumstance 
that 
these 
call 
up 
a 
feeling 
of 
heightened 
insecurity 
which 
can 
also 
result 
from 
psychic 
experiences. 
But 
the 
neurotic 
tendency 
toward 
security, 
which 
is 
strengthened 
in 
cases 
of 
increased 
uncertainty, 
is 
always 
the 
effective 
cause 
of 
the 
psychotic 
construction. 
It 
then 
draws 
more 
forcibly 
into 
its 
powers 
the 
neurotic 
method 
of 
apperception 
and 
thus 
causes 
a 
" 
barring 
off 
" 
(abspewung). 
The 
use 
of 
female 
domestic 
servants 
in 
the 
psychic 
construction 
of 
our 
patient 
brings 
to 
expression 
the 
tendency 
to 
depreciation 
of 
females. 
In 
her 
insane 
system 
anxiety 
is 
strongly 
manifested 
and 
is 
distinctly 
recognizable 
as 
a 
means 
to 
obtain 
security 
against 
the 
male 
and 
thus 
coordinated 
to 
the 
purpose 
of 
her 
insanity, 
constituting 
a 
second 
expression 
of 
her 
aggravated 
masculine 
protest.* 


* 
The 
accentuation 
of 
the 
fictitious 
guiding 
line 
in 
the 
neurotic 
who 
becomes 
insecure 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
has 
to 
utilize 
stronger 
measures 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
gaining 
security. 
Anxiety 
where 
another 
merely 
visualizes, 
hypochondriasis 
where 
another 
employs 
caution. 
Our 
patient 
had 
both 
the 
anxiety 
and 
the 
delusion 
where 
for 
other 
girls 
morality 
and 
caution 
were 
still 
sufficient 
Thus 
also 
in 
place 
of 
caution, 
hallucinations, 
and 
fears. 
A 
further 
perversion 
of 
our 
patient 
of 
which 
she 
was 
dimly 
conscious 
consisted 
in 
a 
fellatio 
phantasy. 
The 
realities 
connected 
therewith 
and 
which 
found 
application 
in 
the 
neurotic 
tendency 
of 
her 
phantasy 
were 
well 
known 
to 
the 
patient. 
She 
had 
always 
been 
very 
dainty 
and 
as 
a 
child 
had 
always 
been 
a 
slave 
to 
this 
tendency. 
Even 
to-day 
this 
characteristic 
often 
asserts 
itself. 
But 
it 
happened 
not 
infrequently 
that 
she 
took 
loathsome 
things 
into 
her 
mouth 
without 
disgust. 
In 
her 
avoidance 
of 
the 
feminine 
role 
this 
patient 
tried, 
because 
parturition 
seemed 
to 
her 
unacceptable 
and 
especially 
feminine, 
to 
imagine 
this 
perverse 
situation 
temporarily 
possible. 
The 
suggestion 
originated 
from 
a 
conversation 
which 
she 
had 
overheard. 
This 
perversion 
was 
asserted 
of 
a 
female 
neighbor 
living 
independently 
and 
in 
pleasant 
relations. 
Early 
forced 
away 
from 
the 
partner, 
she 
nevertheless 
sought 
to 
keep 
in 
touch 
with 
reality 
and 
found 
in 
the 
avoidance 
of 
labor, 
supported 
by 
her 
exaggerated 
leaning 
to 
disgusting 
procedures 
the 
way 
to 
this, 
perverse 
phantasy. 
But 
her 
masculine 
protest 
opposed 
even 
this. 
Her 



crying 
out 
at 
night 
was 
as 
a 
rule 
over 
dream 
situations 
of 
this 
sort, 
arranged 
tentatively, 
and 
with 
this 
masculine 
protest, 
she 
answered 
to 
the 
femininely 
perverse 
role 
which 
she 
imputed 
to 
herself. 


The 
psychic 
attitude 
of 
the 
patient 
described 
at 
the 
beginning 
shows 
the 
essential 
difference. 
At 
least 
a 
part 
of 
her 
fear 
of 
the 
man 
and 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest 
was 
present 
which 
after 
a 
short 
time 
made 
room 
for 
a 
normal 
attitude. 
What 
could 
make 
one 
apprehensive 
was 
the 
disposition 
to 
a 
difficult, 
socially 
inferior 
situation 
which 
could 
only 
be 
obviated 
by 
further 
inroads. 


Could 
there, 
however, 
be 
expected 
a 
much 
more 
favorable 
solution 
of 
the 
problem 
of 
this 
patient 
who 
has 
declined 
and 
who 
has 
been 
robbed 
of 
all 
social 
connections 
by 
the 
long 
duration 
s* 
of 
the 
neurosis, 
and 
is 
destitute? 


With 
all 
the 
solidity 
and 
obstinacy 
which 
cling 
to 
neurotic 
symptoms 
and 
the 
neurotic 
character 
there 
is 
often 
a 
changeableness 
and 
instability 
which 
has 
attracted 
the 
attention 
of 
many 
writers. 
The 
character 
of 
capriciousness, 
of 
uncertainty 
of 
temper, 
of 
suggestibility 
and 
of 
susceptibility 
to 
influence 
(Janet, 
Striimpell, 
Raimann 
and 
others) 
was 
wrongly 
given, 
as 
an 
important 
sign 
of 
a 
psychogenic 
affection. 
But 
attention 
must, 
however, 
be 
called 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
psychic 
phenomena 
which, 
as 
we 
have 
shown, 
only 
present 
means, 
modes 
of 
expression 
and 
purposeful 
dispositions, 
variability 
must 
often 
be 
preserved 
among 
the 
other 
characteristics, 
because 
it 
may 
also 
occur 
as 
an 
auxiliary 
line 
and 
serve 
the 
fictitious 
final 
goal, 
the 
maximating 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness. 
The 
neurotic 
self-valuation 
will 
at 
any 
rate 
take 
those 
variations 
as 
a 
point 
of 
departure 
for 
a 
way 
of 
thinking, 
will 
exaggerate 
the 
judgment 
of 
weakness 
by 
strengthening 
the 
suggestibility, 
will 
support 
it 
with 
selected 
neuroses 
for 
the 
most 
part 
falsely 
estimated 
in 
order 
to 
gain 
in 
a 
neurosis 
a 
strengthened 
impetus. 
As 
the 
following 
case 
teaches 
for 
example. 
A 
short 
time 
ago, 
a 
Viennese 
physician 
brought 
forward 
in 
a 
public 
session, 
examples 
of 
making 
waking 
suggestions 
which 
indeed 
succeeded 
with 
a 
certain 
lady 
on 
a 
few 
evenings. 
When 
the 
same 
lady 
was 
expected 
to 
offer 
herself 
again 
for 
a 
demonstration 
on 
a 
subsequent 
evening 
she 
responded 
with 
an 
hysterical 
attack 
of 
such 
nature 
that 
the 
further 
demonstrations 
were 
forbidden 
by 
the 
police. 
In 
the 
psychotherapeutic 
treatment, 
one 
must 
always 
be 
prepared 
for 
the 
circumstance 
that 
the 
introduction 
of 
the 
patient 
into 
the 
experiment 
heightens 
the 
masculine 
protest 
and 
the 
disposition 
to 
attacks 
and 



is 
above 
all 
forced 
to 
prevent 
this 
reaction. 
Every 
improvement 
in 
the 
condition 
is 
felt 
by 
the 
patient 
as 
compulsion 
and 
conquest 
and 
a 
relapse 
often 
follows 
from 
no 
other 
reason 
than 
that 
an 
improvement 
had 
preceded. 
The 
many 
ambivalent 
traits 
of 
neurotics 
and 
psychotic 
patients 
arranged 
according 
to 
a 
polar 
principle 
(Bleuler) 
are 
constructed 
on 
the 
hermaphroditic 
splitting 
of 
the 
neurotic 
psyche 
and 
obey 
exclusively 
the 
ideal 
of 
personal 
worth 
reassured 
by 
hypersensibility 
and 
great 
caution. 



CHAPTER 
III 


NEUROTIC 
PRINCIPLES: 
SYMPATHY, 
COQUETRY, 
NARCISSISM, 
PSYCHIC 
HERMAPHRODITISM, 
HALLUCINATORY 
SECURITY, 
VIRTUE, 
CONSCIENCE, 
PEDANTRY, 
FANATIC 
ATTACHMENT 
TO 
TRUTH 


IN 
our 
preceding 
observations 
we 
were 
able 
to 
follow 
the 
various 
attempts, 
preparations 
and 
dispositions 
of 
a 
patient 
which 
were 
conditioned 
by 
the 
setting 
in 
of 
the 
masculine 
tendency. 
The 
resulting 
fear 
of 
the 
man 
was 
so 
great 
that 
every 
amative 
relation 
was 
prevented 
until 
treatment 
made 
it 
possible. 
In 
very 
many 
cases 
the 
masculine 
protest 
manifests 
itself 
in 
an 
apparently 
opposite 
direction. 
The 
patients 
constantly 
begin 
new 
relations 
which, 
however, 
easily 
languish 
and 
are 
menaced 
by 
peculiar 
turns 
of 
fortune. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
they 
are 
capable 
of 
contracting 
marriage 
one 
or 
more 
times 
and 
also 
of 
dissolving 
the 
marriage 
again. 
Very 
often 
the 
deepest 
passions 
of 
love 
are 
shown 
which 
are 
strong 
enough 
to 
overcome 
all 
obstacles 
and 
are 
usually 
only 
augmented 
by 
them. 
The 
same 
phenomena 
are 
observed 
in 
male 
neurotics. 
Upon 
closer 
observation 
the 
well-known 
traits 
of 
the 
neurotic 
subject 
are 
again 
found 
(first 
of 
all 
the 
desire 
for 
mastery) 
which 
make 
use 
of 
the 
relations 
of 
life 
as 
a 
vehicle 
for 
realizing 
themselves 
demonstrably 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
do 
his 
other 
characteristics. 
The 
desire 
to 
possess 
everything 
finds 
expression 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
all 
men, 
at 
times, 
all 
human 
beings, 
become 
an 
object 
for 
conquest 
and 
in 
pursuing 
this 
object, 
coquetry, 
necessity 
for 
tenderness, 
and 
discontent 
with 
the 
lot 
assigned 
by 
fate, 
play 
an 
important 
part. 
The 
preference 
for 
difficulties 
is 
often 
remarkable. 
A 
little 
girl 
prefers 
only 
big 
men, 
or 
love 
first 
declares 
itself 
when 
the 
parents 
forbid 
it, 
while 
the 
attainable 
is 
treated 
with 
open 
disdain. 
In 
the 
conversation 
and 
deliberation 
of 
such 
girls 
the 
limiting 
word 
-emerges 
constantly. 
They 
wish 
only 
a 
cultured, 
only 
a 
broad, 
only 
a 
masculine 
man, 
only 
a 
platonic 
love, 
only 
a 
marriage 
without 
children, 
only 
a 
husband 
who 
will 
permit 
their 
entire 
liberty, 
etc. 
The 
tendency 
toward 
detraction 
is 
often 
so 
obvious 
in 
this 
process 
that 
hardly 
a 
man 
remains 
who 
would 
fit 
the 
requirements. 
Usually 
they 
have 
a 
completed, 
often 
unconscious 
ideal, 
in 



whom 
are 
mingled 
the 
features 
of 
the 
father, 
the 
brother, 
an 
imaginary 
personage, 
or 
a 
literary 
or 
historical 
character. 
The 
more 
we 
become 
acquainted 
with 
these 
ideals, 
the 
more 
are 
we 
convinced 
that 
they 
are 
advanced 
as 
a 
fictitious 
standard 
in 
order 
to 
detract 
from 
reality 
by 
comparison 
with 
them. 
The 
psychic 
tendency 
with 
the 
accompanying 
features 
of 
an 
"unwomanly" 
nature, 
which 
frequently 
gives 
rise 
to 
sexual 
liberty, 
unfaithfulness 
and 
unchastity, 
reveals 
obviously 
a 
striving 
after 
the 
masculine 
ideal. 
Analysis 
often 
shows 
original 
organic 
inferiority, 
an 
exaggerated 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
a 
remarkable 
original 
higher 
estimation 
of 
the 
male 
which 
follows 
on 
the 
heels 
of 
detraction 
as 
a 
means 
of 
assurance. 
Other 
assurances 
strengthen 
the 
opinion 
we 
have 
formed. 
Such 
ideas 
as, 
all 
men 
are 
rough, 
tyrannical, 
have 
a 
bad 
odor, 
are 
infected, 
etc., 
reveal 
the 
influence 
upon 
apperception 
of 
this 
trend. 
In 
male 
neurotics 
are 
observed 
ideas 
of 
a 
suspicious 
nature 
which 
make 
the 
accusation 
that 
all 
women 
are 
sinful, 
unstable, 
frivolous, 
psychologically 
weak-minded, 
abandoned 
unrestrainedly 
to 
their 
sexuality. 


Our 
teachers, 
philosophers 
and 
poets, 
who 
form 
the 
ideal 
of 
our 
time, 
the 
Secret 
Emperor 
(" 
heimichen 
Kaiser") 
(Simmel), 
are 
also 
not 
infrequently 
under 
the 
sway 
of 
the 
same 
fictions. 
The 
neurotic 
is 
therefore 
likely 
to 
seize 
upon 
them 
in 
order 
to 
gain 
a 
firm 
guiding 
line 
in 
the 
unrest 
of 
life. 
For 
the 
above 
neurotic 
tendency, 
Schopenhauer, 
Strindberg, 
Moebius, 
and 
Weininger, 
besides 
the 
religious 
teachers 
and 
fathers 
of 
the 
church, 
have 
produced 
the 
most 
pleasing 
cleiche. 
The 
malleus 
malificarium 
and 
the 
disgrace 
of 
the 
burning 
of 
witches 
followed 
the 
learned 
disputes 
of 
the 
clerics 
over 
the 
question 
whether 
woman 
has 
a 
soul, 
whether 
she 
is 
a 
human 
being. 
The 
reassuring 
schematic 
fictions 
of 
neurotic 
girls 
are 
derived 
from 
a 
childish 
view 
of 
the 
world, 
because 
art 
is 
still, 
nearly 
exclusively, 
masculine 
territory 
and 
the 
apperception 
offers 
a 
material 
less 
suited 
to 
it, 
and 
therefore 
these 
fictions 
of 
neurotic 
girls 
are 
brought 
into 
harmony 
with 
reality 
with 
greater 
difficulty. 


Where 
reality, 
however, 
is 
able 
to 
influence 
the 
neurotic 
fiction 
of 
the 
girl 
it 
usually 
causes 
traits 
of 
character 
and 
tendencies 
which 
reveal 
clearly 
enough 
the 
masculine 
inclination 
to 
conquer 
man, 
or 
where 
there 
is 
the 
strongest 
tendency 
to 
gain 
security 
in 
a 
homosexual 
way 
to 
conquer 
woman, 
but 
which 
make 
these 
neurotics 
nevertheless 
seek, 
as 
a 
lover 
or 
as 
a 
husband, 



the 
man 
to 
whom 
they 
deny 
value 
and 
who 
is 
only 
fitted 
in 
a 
small 
degree 
for 
conflict. 
The 
expression 
of 
sympathy 
can 
in 
such 
cases 
often 
disguise 
the 
state 
of 
affairs, 
and 
love 
is 
then 
free 
if 
thef 
man 
is 
powerless, 
enfeebled, 
a 
cripple, 
aged. 
In 
phantasies, 
dreams 
and 
hallucinations 
in 
which 
the 
man 
is 
castrated 
or 
changed 
into 
a 
woman, 
or 
corpse, 
is 
"below," 
and 
especially 
in 
the 
tendency 
to 
see 
the 
man 
without 
weapons, 
small, 
abased; 
is 
revealed 
the 
compulsion 
of 
the 
masculine 
guiding 
fiction 
and 
finds 
in 
necrophilia 
its 
highest 
expression. 
(*Eulenburg 
emphasized 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
the 
relationship 
between 
active 
algolagnia 
(v. 
Schrenck-Notzing) 
and 
necrophilia.) 


Another 
road, 
as 
we 
have 
already 
stated, 
leads 
over 
the 
line 
of 
the 
desire 
to 
possess 
everything, 
towards 
neurotic 
coquetry. 
The 
masculine 
protest 
is 
therein 
revealed, 
first 
in 
the 
tendency 
to 
compensate 
a 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
of 
deficiency 
apperceived 
through 
the 
picture 
of 
the 
lost 
masculine 
member 
by 
means 
of 
domination 
of 
many 
or 
of 
all 
men. 
Secondly, 
by 
the 
refusal 
of 
a 
feminine 
role 
in 
sexual 
relations, 
in 
marriage. 
In 
place 
of 
this 
despised 
role, 
expedients 
are 
resorted 
to 
which 
are 
dictated 
by 
the 
manly 
guiding 
line, 
such 
as 
sexual 
anesthesia 
and 
perversions 
of 
all 
sorts, 
among 
which 
the 
sadistic 
predominates. 
Bloch 
has 
emphasized 
in 
a 
fine 
manner 
the 
desire 
for 
domination 
by 
the 
coquette 
when 
he 
says: 
(" 
Beitrage 
zur 
Atiologie 
der 
Psychopathia 
sex," 
1903) 
" 
Coquetry, 
which 
may 
be 
defined 
as 
the 
effort 
of 
women 
to 
attach 
men 
to 
them, 
makes 
use, 
to 
a 
considerable 
extent, 
of 
purely 
sexual 
means 
to 
attain 
its 
object, 
and 
is, 
in 
this 
respect, 
an 
efflux 
of 
the 
true 
gynecokratic 
instinct." 
We 
can 
only 
add 
that 
these 
"gynecokratic 
instincts" 
are 
constructed 
according 
to 
the 
picture 
of 
the 
resemblance 
to 
men 
and 
thus 
prove 
themselves 
to 
be 
dependent 
on 
a 
masculine 
ideal, 
although 
in 
the 
attainment 
thereof 
feminine 
means 
are 
resorted 
to 
as 
expedients 
because 
they 
are 
the 
only 
ones 
at 
hand. 
The 
attention 
and 
interest 
of 
these 
neurotics 
(among 
whom 
the 
masculine 
coquettes 
are 
remarkable, 
because 
they 
seek 
to 
carry 
through 
their 
triumph 
valued 
as 
masculine 
by 
feminine 
means) 
is 
directed 
towards 
making 
an 
impression 
and 
to 
force 
others 
into 
their 
service. 
A 
result 
of 
this 
trait 
of 
character 
is 
that 
the 
neurotic 
strengthening 
of 
these 
secondary 
guiding 
lines 
leads 
to 
overestimation 
of 
self 
and 
therefore 
also 
to 
exaggeration 
of 
the 
desire 
for 
mastery, 
of 
pride, 
and 
of 
the 
tendency 
to 
detract 
from 
the 
worth 
of 
others. 
Hence 
we 
need 
not 
be 
surprised 
that 
the 
object 
of 



the 
desire, 
as 
a 
rule, 
appears 
to 
be 
overvalued 
through 
the 
narcissism 
(Naecke) 
of 
the 
patient. 
This 
overestimation 
is 
rather 
an 
a 
priori 
condition 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
relation 
and 
in 
it 
is 
reflected 
the 
exaggerated 
ego 
of 
the 
female 
patient. 
(*The 
belief 
in 
personal 
magic 
is 
so 
strong 
that 
every 
resistance 
leads 
to 
new 
endeavours.) 


In 
the 
psychotherapeutic 
treatment 
these 
cases 
produce 
especially 
the 
appearance 
of 
"being 
in 
love 
with 
the 
physician." 
It 
may, 
however, 
be 
easily 
seen 
that 
this 
"transfer 
of 
love" 
corresponds 
to 
one 
of 
the 
numerous 
preparations 
for 
conflict 
used 
for 
overcoming 
the 
obstacle, 
and 
thus 
to 
get 
the 
better 
of 
the 
superiority 
of 
the 
man, 
of 
the 
masculine 
physician; 
and 
it 
may 
be 
easily 
seen 
that 
the 
feeling 
of 
deficiency 
which 
calls 
forth 
this 
peculiar 
obscure 
form 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest 
springs 
from 
their 
femininity 
which 
they 
feel 
as 
inferiority. 
In 
no 
case, 
however, 
no 
matter 
how 
far 
the 
neurotic 
may 
carry 
coquetry, 
does 
it 
reach 
far 
enough 
to 
include 
subjection 
to 
the 
man. 
Sooner 
or 
later 
the 
man 
is 
threatened 
with 
defeat 
which 
carries 
with 
it 
loss 
of 
dignity, 
and 
in 
fact, 
always 
when 
the 
neurotic 
patient 
feels 
the 
situation 
to 
be 
too 
feminine. 
This 
moment 
may 
arrive 
at 
different 
stages, 
but 
it 
is 
as 
a 
rule, 
contact, 
a 
kiss, 
expectation 
of 
sexual 
relations, 
fear 
of 
pregnancy 
or 
of 
childbirth 
which 
releases 
the 
heightened 
tendency 
to 
gain 
reassurance 
and 
causes 
the 
outbreak 
of 
that 
which 
is 
ordinarily 
termed 
a 
neurosis 
or 
psychosis. 
Then 
the 
stronger 
abstraction 
of 
reality 
comes 
into 
its 
right, 
the 
fictions 
assert 
themselves 
with 
' 
greater 
distinctness, 
the 
tendency 
to 
detract 
from 
the 
value 
of 
the 
man 
leads 
to 
actions 
and 
deeds 
which 
apparently 
have 
lost 
all 
meaning, 
and 
the 
inimical 
dispositions 
of 
the 
aggressiveness, 
and 
with 
these 
the 
neurotic 
traits 
of 
character 
come 
to 
light. 


Every 
neurotic 
possesses 
to 
some 
degree 
this 
coquetry 
which 
has 
its 
origin 
in 
narcissism. 
They 
originate 
indeed 
from 
his 
hypostasized 
idea 
of 
personal 
value, 
are 
founded 
like 
this 
upon 
an 
original 
feeling 
of 
inferiority. 
The 
fact 
that 
neurotics, 
especially 
the 
species 
just 
described, 
find 
it 
so 
hard 
to 
separate 
themselves 
from 
persons 
or 
things 
is 
in 
harmony 
with 
this. 
The 
parting 
from 
a 
person, 
seemingly 
not 
in 
close 
relations 
with 
the 
neurotic, 
to 
say 
nothing 
of 
a 
seemingly 
loved 
person, 
is 
capable 
of 
producing 
the 
most 
severe 
neurotic 
symptoms, 
neuralgic 
attacks, 
depression, 
loss 
of 
sleep, 
attacks 
of 
weeping, 
etc. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
threats 
of 
desertion 
or 
separation 
are 
not 
rare, 
and 
are 
used 
to 
bring 
forth 
proof 
of 
the 
influence 
over 
the 
person 



threatened. 
That 
the 
masculine 
protest 
is 
dominant 
in 
this 
coquetry 
is 
proved 
from 
various 
phenomena. 
The 
strong 
disinclination 
for 
a 
distinctly 
feminine 
role 
has 
already 
been 
emphasized; 
it 
is 
capable 
in 
these 
cases 
of 
calling 
forth 
a 
remarkable 
picture, 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
double 
life 
a 
splitting 
of 
consciousness, 
an 
ambivalence 
(Bleuler). 
Analysis 
constantly 
furnishes 
greater 
proof 
for 
the 
striving 
toward 
masculinity. 
Dreams, 
phantasies, 
hallucinations, 
onset 
of 
psychosis 
show 
in 
a 
most 
distinct 
manner 
the 
striving 
to 
become 
a 
man, 
or 
one 
of 
the 
equivalents, 
as 
fear 
of 
a 
feminine 
lot. 
The 
strong 
tendency 
toward 
detraction 
of 
men 
originates 
from 
the 
effort 
to 
attain 
an 
equal 
value 
with 
the 
male 
and 
gives 
rise 
in 
sexual 
events 
to 
the 
masculine 
role, 
which 
is 
revealed 
in 
frigidity, 
in 
desire 
to 
be 
first 
and 
in 
those 
perversions 
which 
force 
the 
man 
to 
take 
a 
slavish 
and 
debasing 
position. 


Often 
the 
onset 
of 
the 
neurosis 
may 
be 
assumed 
to 
have 
set 
in 
when 
such 
symptoms 
as 
fear 
of 
a 
decision, 
of 
a 
test, 
of 
marriage, 
public 
appearance, 
of 
place 
(Platzangst), 
require 
medical 
treatment. 
These 
anxieties 
arise 
at 
the 
emerging 
of 
a 
contradiction 
in 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
if 
in 
pursuing 
the 
same 
a 
set-back, 
a 
feminine 
lot, 
a 
defeat 
is 
threatened 
and 
hence 
the 
forced 
admission 
of 
femininity. 


This 
was 
the 
case 
with 
one 
of 
my 
patients 
who, 
several 
years 
ago, 
just 
before 
her 
first 
public 
appearance, 
became 
ill 
with 
piano-player's 
cramp. 
This 
neurosis 
furnished 
a 
good 
excuse 
for 
escaping 
from 
a 
dreaded 
failure. 
The 
closer 
examination 
into 
the 
conditions 
of 
this 
illness 
showed 
a 
neurotic 
illusion 
in 
which 
the 
patient 
at 
the 
sight 
of 
notes 
was 
reminded 
of 
male 
genital 
organs. 
The 
first 
explanation 
to 
suggest 
itself 
was 
that 
of 
an 
exaggerated 
or 
repressed 
sexuality 
whose 
reflection 
in 
the 
piano-player's 
cramp 
was 
to 
be 
sought 
in 
the 
repression 
of 
the 
inclination 
to 
masturbation. 
The 
result 
furnished 
an 
entirely 
different 
explanation. 
The 
triumph 
before 
the 
public 
was 
supposed 
to 
signify 
an 
equality 
with 
the 
man, 
masculinity. 
This 
fiction 
was 
in 
contradiction 
with 
reality, 
with 
her 
femininity, 
so 
that 
a 
public 
appearance 
equalled 
a 
final 
balancing 
of 
the 
facts 
(many 
talented 
girls 
and 
women 
are 
wrecked 
for 
the 
same 
reason). 
The 
sense 
of 
reality 
of 
the 
patient 
placed 
instead 
of 
the 
facts, 
would 
not 
admit 
this 
condition 
of 
things, 
and 
when; 
arranged 
by 
a 
symbolic 
interpretation 
of 
the 
heads 
of 
the 
notes, 
works 
a 
fictitious 
abstraction 
which 
recalled 
the 
femininity 
and 
became 
a 
regressive 
signal. 
The 
contradiction 
in 
the 
masculine 
protest 
of 
this 
patient 
is 



manifested, 
as 
is 
nearly 
always 
the 
case 
in 
the 
neurosis, 
in 
the 
unrealizability 
of 
the 
fiction 
just 
when, 
before 
the 
decision, 
the 
possibility 
ol 
a 
failure 
estimated 
as 
"feminine" 
in 
character 
emerged 
a 
common 
phenomenon 
which 
needs 
no 
explanation. 
Now 
the 
traits 
of 
anxiety, 
of 
shyness, 
of 
stage-fright 
are 
strengthened, 
and 
they 
either 
themselves 
furnish 
excuses 
or 
preparations 
and 
predispositions 
(in 
our 
case 
pains 
and 
inability 
to 
move 
the 
hands) 
and 
divert 
the 
attention 
from 
the 
menace 
to 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
But 
in 
this 
case 
also 
the 
force 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest 
is 
astonishing, 
it 
forms 
a 
preparedness 
for 
conflict 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest 
even 
out 
of 
the 
illness 
in 
which 
the 
patient 
takes 
refuge. 
This 
girl 
had 
entered 
upon 
the 
career 
of 
a 
virtuoso 
against 
her 
will, 
forced 
thereto 
by 
her 
unyielding 
mother. 
The 
wrecking 
of 
her 
mother's 
ambitious 
plans 
meant 
for 
the 
daughter 
a 
victory 
which 
recompensed 
her 
in 
part. 
That 
which 
her 
obstinacy, 
her 
masculine 
tendency 
was 
not 
able 
to 
accomplish, 
was 
successful 
through 
her 
illness 
as 
soon 
as 
note-stems 
called 
up 
to 
her 
the 
menacing 
souvenir 
"you 
are 
a 
woman, 
take 
care, 
do 
not 
allow 
yourself 
to 
be 
forced 
to 
a 
feminine 
obedient 
role 
by 
your 
mother 
conquer 
her." 
A 
further 
construction, 
an 
excuse 
which 
yielded 
a 
foundation 
for 
the 
attitude 
toward 
her 
mother, 
lay 
in 
the 
heightened 
feeling 
that 
her 
younger 
sister 
was 
given 
preference. 
This 
train 
of 
thought, 
as 
well 
as 
her 
efforts 
to 
gain 
exclusive 
control 
over 
every 
one, 
her 
mother, 
all 
the 
members 
of 
the 
family, 
all 
human 
beings 
in 
the 
environment, 
even 
of 
a 
dog, 
was 
reflected 
in 
the 
heightened 
characteristics 
of 
her 
coquetry 
and 
found 
expression, 
for 
example, 
in 
one 
of 
her 
latest 
dreams 
concerning 
the 
physician. 
The 
dream 
was 
as 
follows: 
" 
I 
sit 
opposite 
you 
and 
ask 
if 
you 
like 
all 
the 
patients 
as 
well 
as 
you 
like 
me? 
You 
answered, 
' 
Yes, 
all, 
and 
my 
four 
children, 
too.' 
All 
at 
once 
you 
changed 
into 
a 
woman 
and 
went 
to 
sleep. 
A 
woman 
was 
looking 
at 
the 
black 
notes." 


The 
amative 
disposition 
of 
this 
patient 
could 
endure 
no 
rival. 
She 
made 
use 
of 
the 
certainty 
of 
her 
conquest 
in 
order 
to 
support 
her 
feeling 
of 
security. 
The 
physician 
who 
gave 
her 
to 
understand 
that 
he 
treated 
all 
patients 
with 
the 
same 
interest, 
and 
who 
loved 
his 
children 
besides, 
becomes 
forthwith 
the 
point 
of 
attack 
of 
her 
striving 
for 
domination, 
as 
was 
formerly, 
the 
mother, 
the 
man 
whom 
she 
married, 
as 
were 
all 
persons 
in 
her 
environment, 
domestic 
servants, 
trades-people, 
teachers, 
etc. 
Her 
self-centered 
nature 
did 
not 
need 
to 
"transfer," 
as 
she 
came 
to 
the 
treatment 
with 
rigid 
predispositions 
and 
put 



them 
in 
play 
from 
the 
first 
moment 
of 
her 
meeting 
with 
the 
physician. 
Only 
the 
new 
situation 
was 
surrounded 
with 
difficulties 
and 
obstacles 
which 
prevented 
the 
will 
to 
domination 
through 
love 
from 
fully 
developing. 
Naturally 
my 
wife 
was 
left 
out 
of 
the 
dream. 
Just 
this 
omission 
is 
the 
corner 
stone 
of 
the 
situation; 
my 
wife 
is 
definitely 
set 
aside. 
Up 
to 
this 
point 
the 
feminine 
means 
extend 
and 
characterize 
the 
feminine 
line 
to 
which 
the 
patient 
holds. 
Now 
the 
masculine 
protest 
emerges 
more 
distinctly. 
I 
become 
unmanned, 
the 
reassuring 
illusion 
of 
the 
patient, 
namely, 
the 
notes 
as 
a 
protecting 
symbol 
of 
the 
male 
genitals, 
asserts 
its 
right. 
She, 
herself, 
' 
takes 
care," 
secures 
herself 
in 
order 
not 
to 
sink 
in 
her 
feeling 
of 
masculine 
egoconsciousness, 
to 
suffer 
no 
defeat. 


That 
1 
go 
to 
sleep 
in 
the 
dream, 
assigns 
to 
me 
a 
place 
similar 
to 
that 
which 
her 
husband 
occupies. 
The 
patient 
feels 
it 
as 
a 
great 
neglect 
that 
her 
husband, 
an 
overworked 
manufacturer, 
often 
goes 
to 
sleep 
before 
she 
does. 
The 
unmanning 
of 
the 
husband 
is 
the 
answer 
thereto, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
prolonged 
insomnia 
whose 
constructive 
significance 
lies 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
permits 
the 
patient 
to 
operate 
against 
her 
husband. 
Now 
she 
could 
refuse 
him 
his 
right 
as 
a 
husband 
and 
turned 
him, 
at 
first 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
night, 
later 
permanently, 
out 
of 
her 
bedroom; 
because 
he 
"snored 
and 
disturbed 
her 
so 
much." 
Our 
patient 
would 
have 
easily 
found 
another 
argument 
if 
this 
one 
had 
not 
presented 
itself, 
and 
it 
would 
be 
erroneous 
to 
exclude 
the 
neurotic 
construction 
as 
a 
cause 
because 
in 
this 
case 
the 
neurotic 
happened 
to 
be 
right. 
In 
order 
to 
prove 
that 
she 
is 
right 
the 
patient 
will 
often 
argue 
aptly; 
the 
neurotic 
stigma 
in 
fact 
consists 
in 
the 
tendency 
to 
render 
the 
superiority 
visible 
by 
all 
possible 
means. 
Litigious 
paranoia 
for 
example 
reveals 
this 
mechanism 
to 
us 
with 
greater 
clearness. 
Besides, 
the 
neurosis 
of 
our 
patient 
continues 
in 
its 
construction 
of 
assurances. 
To 
her 
insomnia 
is 
added, 
in 
order 
to 
place 
this 
on 
a 
firmer 
basis, 
a 
sensitiveness 
of 
hearing, 
whose 
mechanism 
consists 
In 
an 
overcharging 
of 
the 
attention 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
serving 
the 
neurotic 
tendency, 
so 
that 
we 
were 
also 
able 
to 
say, 
by 
this 
overcharging, 
the 
patient 
is 
awakened 
by 
the 
slightest 
noise 
as 
soon 
as 
she 
falls 
asleep. 
Thus 
she 
can, 
still 
awake 
when 
morning 
comes, 
sleep 
far 
into 
the 
day 
and 
thus 
avoid 
the 
feminine 
tasks 
of 
the 
household, 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
she 
had 
escaped 
the 
mother's 
domination 
by 
stage 
fright 
and 
cramps 
in 
the 
fingers. 
An 
auditory 
hallucination, 
a 
sawing 
noise, 
constitutes 
a 
final 
security 
which 
may 



be 
pursued 
analytically 
in 
two 
directions. 
The 
one 
interpretation 
is 
furnished 
by 
a 
warning 
souvenir, 
which 
at 
the 
same 
time 
is 
an 
incentive 
to 
her 
coquetry 
once, 
when 
eight 
years 
old, 
she 
overheard 
an 
intimate 
scene 
at 
her 
married 
sister's, 
she 
felt 
shut 
out, 
neglected 
she 
gave 
a 
similar 
value 
to 
her 
husband's 
"indifference" 
when 
he 
fell 
asleep 
before 
she 
did, 
in 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
take 
a 
sharply 
aggressive 
attitude 
toward 
him. 
A 
second 
interpretation 
led 
in 
another 
direction. 
The 
noise 
recalled 
the 
sawing 
off 
of 
a 
stem 
and 
symbolized, 
acoustically,* 
the 
unmanning, 
the 
detraction 
from 
the 
worth 
of 
the 
man. 


*One 
is 
reminded 
here 
of 
the 
somatic-jargon 
of 
which 
we 
have 
already 
spoken-Thus 
the 
words, 
" 
schrill 
" 
and 
" 
grell," 
bring 
to 
expression 
senserially 
in 
their 
transformed 
meaning, 
analogies 
which 
are 
felt 
at 
one 
time 
through 
the 
eye, 
at 
another, 
through 
the 
ear 


As 
is 
also 
so 
frequently 
the 
case 
this 
symptom 
proved 
to 
be 
(just 
as 
I 
have 
maintained 
of 
the 
dream, 
of 
symptoms, 
and 
of 
the 
neurosis) 
a 
representative 
instance 
of 
the 
ascension 
from 
the 
feminine 
to 
the 
masculine 
line, 
as 
a 
masculine 
protest 
against 
a 
situation 
usually 
previously 
felt 
as 
feminine, 
against 
an 
anticipated 
feeling 
of 
defeat 
and 
as 
a 
symbol 
of 
the 
life 
scheme 
of 
this 
neurotic 
patient. 


This, 
and 
similar 
cases, 
explained 
to 
me 
in 
what 
manner 
suggestibility 
became 
an 
auxiliary 
of 
the 
tendency 
to 
attain 
security, 
either 
because 
therefrom 
the 
patient 
gained 
in 
small 
things 
the 
conviction 
of 
her 
weakness 
in 
order 
to 
provide 
herself 
with 
proper 
protection 
at 
critical 
times, 
or 
because 
the 
patient 
yields 
with 
surprisingpliability 
in 
order 
to 
gain 
ascendancy 
over 
the 
other 
person.* 


* 
The 
latter 
mechanism 
seems 
to 
be 
at 
the 
root 
of 
passive 
homosexuality 
while 
both 
attitudes 
may 
be 
taken 
as 
the 
structure 
of 
masochism, 
still 
better, 
pseudomasochism. 
The 
more 
direct 
efforts 
of 
her 
tendency 
to 
domination 
stand 
so 
sharply 
in 
contrast 
with 
this 
yielding 
that 
when 
only 
superficially 
observed 
the 
phenomenon 
resembles 
a 
splitting 
of 
consciousness. 
In 
the 
same 
manner, 
vanity, 
pride, 
and 
self-admiration 
will 
guide 
the 
patient 
in 
many 
cases 
to 
the 
same 
goal, 
while 
she 
at 
times, 
conducts 
herself 
with 
modesty, 
simplicity, 
and 
carelessness, 
using 
these 
qualities 
as 
expedients. 
Usually 
externals 
and 



attitudes 
are 
carefully 
studied. 
Very 
often 
fetichism 
is 
manifested, 
whose 
essential 
and 
constructive 
foundation 
represents 
efforts 
to 
prove 
equality 
with 
men 
in 
circuitous 
ways, 
hence 
to 
compensate 
for 
a 
feeling 
of 
deficiency. 
Literature 
furnishes 
us 
with 
representations 
of 
all 
these 
efforts 
in 
a 
most 
refined 
form 
in 
the 
memoirs 
of 
Baschkirzewa 
and 
Helen 
Rakowiza. 
Analyses 
of 
a 
series 
of 
cases 
where 
the 
memories 
of 
these 
remarkable 
impressions 
from 
childhood 
had 
been 
preserved 
more 
vividly 
than 
usual 
furnished 
me 
with 
interesting 
verifications 
at 
a 
time 
when 
I 
was 
already 
far 
advanced 
in 
my 
exposition 
of 
the 
doubts 
about 
the 
future 
sexual 
role 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
neurotic 
child 
and 
the 
masculine 
protest 
which 
necessarily 
springs 
therefrom. 
Some 
remembered 
very 
distinctly 
having 
been 
in 
doubt 
up 
to 
the 
twelfth 
or 
thirteenth 
year 
whether 
they 
were 
male 
or 
female. 
It 
may 
not 
be 
a 
matter 
of 
chance 
that 
these 
were 
male 
patients. 
At 
times 
the 
doubt 
emerged 
whether 
they 
were 
not 
hermaphrodites, 
so 
that 
I 
am 
inclined 
to 
think 
that 
in 
other 
cases 
where 
the 
thought 
of 
hermaphrodites 
was 
distinctly 
and 
importunately 
present 
in 
the 
memory 
of 
the 
patient 
and 
was 
spontaneously 
brought 
forward, 
it 
is 
the 
last 
impression 
of 
a 
doubt 
about 
the 
patient's 
own 
sex. 
And 
in 
literature, 
too, 
I 
have 
frequently 
run 
across 
this 
significant 
trace 
in 
the 
histories 
of 
neurotics 
and 
psychotics 
without 
the 
significance 
of 
this 
doubt 
concerning 
the 
sexual 
role 
being 
clear 
to 
the 
writers. 
Meschede 
described 
an 
interesting 
case 
of 
question-compulsion 
(Fragezwang), 
and 
Freud 
one 
of 
dementia 
after 
Schreber's 
biography. 
I 
disregard 
whether 
or 
not 
this 
interest 
of 
the 
patient 
was 
explained 
by 
illustrations, 
or 
placards, 
in 
the 
lexicon, 
by 
readings, 
by 
spectacles, 
by 
occurrences, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
scientific 
interpretation 
which 
seemed 
to 
concentrate 
its 
attention 
to 
the 
male 
periods, 
the 
male 
climacteric, 
to 
the 
examination 
of 
the 
male 
or 
female 
share 
in 
the 
individual, 
etc. 
For 
me, 
the 
permanent 
impression 
which 
asserted 
itself 
in 
an 
obvious 
emphasis 
of 
the 
relation 
and 
the 
reciprocal 
relation 
of 
the 
antithesis 
male-
female, 
was 
the 
important 
factor. 


In 
recent 
years 
since 
I 
have 
hit 
upon 
these 
fundamental 
phenomena 
of 
the 
neurosis, 
I 
have 
often 
asked 
myself 
if 
I, 
too, 
in 
the 
course 
of 
my 
development 
from 
childhood 
was 
not 
dominated 
by 
a 
similar 
doubt 
notwithstanding 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
question 
of 
hermaphroditism 
only 
attracted 
me 
at 
a 
very 
late 
period 
and 
from 
the 
standpoint 
of 
a 
critic, 
and 
hence 
in 
a 
secondary 
manner. 
Also 
my 
rejection 
of 
the 
biological 
hermaphroditism 
as 
a 
cause 
of 
the 



neurosis 
(Flies) 
I 
would 
use 
as 
an 
argument 
against 
such 
doubts 
in 
my 
early 
youth, 
if 
I 
were 
not 
familiar 
with 
the 
fact 
that 
often 
the 
negation 
is 
the 
assertion 
of 
an 
old 
interest 
which 
has 
become 
unconscious. 
But 
my 
view 
of 
life 
shows 
me 
that 
I 
must 
have 
become 
master 
of 
old 
childish 
contrary 
tendencies, 
without 
the 
exaggerated 
masculine 
protest 
having 
been 
developed. 
Because 
I 
have 
in 
life, 
as 
well 
as 
iri 
science, 
after 
a 
first 
abstract 
valuation 
of 
the 
masculine 
principle 
over 
the 
feminine, 
rejected 
the 
flood 
of 
arguments 
to 
prove 
the 
original 
deficiencies 
of 
women, 
with 
pertinent 
calmness. 


I 
believe, 
however, 
concerning 
the 
former 
critics 
of 
the 
"masculine 
protest," 
from 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
they 
have 
undertaken 
the 
contest, 
and 
from 
their 
stubborn 
failure 
to 
understand 
it, 
that 
the 
exaggerated 
savageness 
of 
their 
attack 
in 
a 
strictly 
scientific 
question 
is 
referable 
nearly 
as 
much 
as 
is 
their 
fear 
of 
the 
concept 
" 
hermaphroditism 
" 
to 
a 
childhood 
impression 
which 
alarmingly 
presented 
to 
them 
an 
accentuated 
effeminacy 
or 
hermaphroditism, 
with 
which, 
however, 
it 
is 
not 
my 
intention 
to 
deter 
anyone 
from 
a 
scientific 
criticism. 


Besides, 
there 
is 
no 
better 
way 
of 
judging 
the 
reaction 
of 
the 
neurotic 
psyche 
than 
from 
the 
answers 
to 
questions 
showing 
estimation 
of 
the 
opposite 
sex. 
It 
will 
become 
apparent 
that 
every 
stronger 
denial 
of 
the 
equality 
of 
the 
sexes, 
every 
detraction 
or 
overvaluation 
of 
the 
opposite 
sex 
is 
invariably 
connected 
with 
a 
neurotic 
disposition 
and 
neurotic 
traits. 
They 
are 
all 
dependent 
on 
the 
neurotic 
tendency 
to 
obtain 
security, 
and 
all 
manifest 
distinct 
traces 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest 
and 
are 
evidence 
of 
the 
essential, 
more 
abstract 
adherence 
to 
a 
guiding 
fiction. 
They> 
are 
one 
and 
all, 
expedients 
of 
human 
thought 
to 
enhance 
the 
feeling 
of 
personal 
worth. 


It 
follows 
from 
the 
exposition 
of 
my 
psychology 
of 
the 
neuroses 
that 
children 
with 
male 
as 
well 
as 
those 
with 
female 
tendencies, 
look 
forward 
with 
fear 
to 
the 
lot 
of 
a 
woman, 
to 
be 
subject 
to 
a 
man, 
to 
be 
deprived 
of 
virginity, 
injured, 
to 
be 
obliged 
to 
bear 
children, 
to 
play 
a 
subordinate 
role 
in 
life, 
to 
obey, 
to 
be 
backward 
in 
knowledge, 
in 
skill, 
in 
strength, 
wisdom, 
to 
be 
weak, 
to 
have 
periods, 
to 
become 
a 
sacrifice 
to 
husband 
and 
children, 
to 
become 
at 
last 
an 
old 
and 
neglected 
woman. 
How 
this 
fear 
of 
the 
future 
gives 
rise 
to 
egoistic 
traits 
of 
character 
has 
been 
described 
above. 
I 
have 
described 
a 
typical 
case 
of 
a 
little 
girl 
in 
the 
" 
Disposition 
zur 
Neurose 
" 
(I.e.). 



I 
am 
able 
to 
show 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
patient 
suffering 
from 
a 
gastric 
neurosis 
a 
line 
of 
conduct 
which 
is 
regularly 
observed 
in 
the 
psychic 
development 
of 
neurotic 
patients. 
This 
is 
the 
anticipation 
in 
thought 
and 
emotion 
of 
all 
disadvantages 
which 
could 
be 
expected 
to 
occur. 
This 
tendency 
is 
observed 
in 
early 
childhood 
when, 
where 
there 
is 
organic 
inferiority 
and 
the 
evils 
arising 
therefrom, 
it 
is 
of 
excessive 
growth. 
Very 
often 
this 
feelings 
occurs 
at 
the 
time 
immediately 
preceding 
the 
falling 
asleep, 
and 
it 
is 
then 
not 
remarkable 
that 
a 
dream 
fiction 
spurs 
further 
this 
effort 
of 
anticipation 
in 
a 
form 
to 
cause 
fear. 
Only 
the 
dream, 
in 
resemblance 
to 
the 
hallucination, 
brings 
with 
it 
a 
condition 
of 
feeling, 
of 
emotion, 
which 
has 
the 
significance 
as 
anticipation 
of 
emotion, 
parallel 
to 
anticipation 
in 
thought, 
in 
a 
waking 
condition. 
The 
hallucinatory 
excitability 
is, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
emphasized 
in 
the 
" 
Studie 
fiber 
Mindwertigkeit 
von 
Organ," 
an 
extended 
capacity 
of 
the 
brain 
which 
is 
overstrained 
in 
compensatory 
directions, 
serves 
the 
neurotic 
tendency 
to 
gain 
security 
and 
owes 
its 
representative 
faculty 
in 
consciousness 
to 
the 
memory 
which 
follows 
a 
certain 
tendency 
to 
the 
neurotic, 
cautious 
apperception. 
The 
childish 
undeveloped 
psyche 
shows 
at 
most, 
traces 
of 
tendencies 
toward 
hallucinatory 
feelings 
which 
are 
to 
be 
understood 
as 
the 
fictitious 
preparations 
for 
a 
goal, 
as 
anticipation 
in 
time 
of 
uncertainty. 


Thus 
laughing 
in 
sleep, 
or 
pleasant 
sensations 
in 
the 
anticipatory 
quest 
of 
organic 
satisfaction, 
or 
of 
security. 
The 
hallucinatory 
excitement 
in 
the 
neuroses 
and 
psychoses 
always, 
and 
without 
exception, 
serves 
the 
guiding 
fiction 
of 
the 
ideal 
of 
personality. 
The 
significance 
of 
the 
hallucinations 
of 
pain 
and 
anxiety 
for 
the 
fiction 
of 
nervous 
diseases 
should 
also 
be 
taken 
into 
account. 
A 
further 
examination 
of 
the 
mechanism 
of 
the 
hallucination 
teaches 
us 
unequivocally 
that 
it 
is 
composed 
of 
tendencies 
to 
abstraction 
and 
to 
anticipation, 
and 
that 
it 
gains 
significance 
as 
a 
strengthened 
fiction 
or 
as 
a 
warning 
souvenir, 
because 
it 
acts 
as 
a 
spur 
to 
the 
assurance 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
personal 
worth. 
That 
they 
are 
connected 
with 
traces 
of 
memory 
has 
no 
essential 
significance. 
The 
psyche 
works 
without 
exception 
with 
the 
content 
of 
consciousness 
and 
with 
sensations 
that 
are 
given 
by 
experience 
and 
originate 
in 
the 
corporal 
substratum. 
The 
significance 
of 
the 
psyche, 
and 
especially 
of 
the 
neurotic 
psyche, 
lies 
in 
the 
special 
choice 
of 
these 
memory 
traces 
and 
in 
their 
connection 
with 
the 
neurotic 
apperception 
which 
gives 
them 
their 
trend. 
Therefore 
the 
nervously 
exalted 
tendency 
to 
gain 
security 



makes 
use 
of 
a 
specially 
developed 
function 
of 
prevision, 
of 
hallucination, 
in 
which 
abstractly 
and 
imaginatively 
a 
scene 
unrolls, 
an 
anticipated 
denouement, 
a 
foreseen 
finale, 
with 
eagerness, 
so 
that 
the 
hallucinated 
individual 
builds 
the 
bridges 
to 
it, 
or 
they 
have 
an 
admonitory 
quality 
warning 
them 
to 
choose 
another 
way. 
Hallucinations 
as 
well 
as 
dreams 
are, 
like 
other 
tentatives 
of 
the 
psyche, 
fitted 
for 
finding 
the 
way 
which 
leads 
to 
the 
maximation 
or 
preservation 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness. 
In 
it 
are 
reflected 
the 
faiths, 
the 
hopes 
or 
the 
fears 
of 
the 
patient. 


The 
above 
patient 
was 
on 
the 
eve 
of 
marriage 
when 
her 
gastric 
neurosis 
began. 
She 
suffered 
from 
pains 
in 
the 
region 
of 
the 
stomach, 
belching, 
vomiting, 
loss 
of 
appetite 
and 
obstipation. 
One 
evening, 
shortly 
before 
going 
to 
sleep 
she 
heard 
the 
word 
" 
Eskadambra 
" 
distinctly. 
The 
formation 
of 
apparently 
meaningless 
words 
are 
often 
among 
the 
performances 
of 
neurotics. 
Usually 
they 
prove 
to 
be 
put 
together 
according 
to 
a 
plan, 
just 
as 
children 
invent 
languages 
by 
means 
of 
which 
they 
attain 
a 
feeling 
of 
superiority. 
Pfister 
was 
able 
to 
make 
interpretations 
of 
the 
word 
pictures 
which 
originated 
from 
fascination 
in 
the 
cases 
of 
those 
having 
the 
"gift 
of 
tongues." 


In 
a 
previous 
chapter 
I 
have 
given 
a 
solution 
of 
an 
hallucinatory 
" 
sawing" 
in 
the 
ears, 
in 
two 
other 
cases 
I 
found 
the 
roaring 
serving 
as 
an 
admonitory 
memory 
of 
the 
roaring 
of 
the 
sea 
and 
its 
dangers 
as 
a 
sense-
picture 
of 
life, 
just 
as 
Homer 
compares 
the 
ayopa 
to 
the 
roaring 
sea.(* 
On 
another 
occasion 
I 
found 
roaring 
in 
the 
ears 
to 
he 
a 
reminder 
of 
the 
tones 
of 
telegraph 
"wires-These 
tones 
reminded 
him 
of 
his 
isolation 
in 
childhood 
where 
alone 
he 
often 
embraced 
the 
world 
as 
does 
the 
telegraph, 
with 
his 
hopes 
for 
the 
future.) 
* 


In 
paranoia 
and 
dementia 
praecox 
the 
emotions 
leading 
to 
the 
masculine 
protest 
disguise 
themselves 
in 
the 
form 
of 
hallucinations 
and 
assure 
the 
psychotic 
scheme 
through 
their 
acoustic 
or 
visual 
complement. 
Likewise 
concerning 
the 
above 
mentioned 
rounding 
off 
of 
a 
psychic 
move 
into 
a 
hallucination 
of 
hearing, 
we 
may 
assume 
that 
a 
strong 
inner 
necessity 
has 
led 
to 
a 
greater 
tension 
of 
the 
tendency 
to 
gain 
security, 
for 
which 
the 
word 
" 
eskadambra," 
though 
without 
value 
or 
significance 
for 
the 
patient, 
can 
represent 
a 
signal 
or 
sign.(As 
one 
has 
to 
assume 
also 
concerning 
the 
dream 



which 
represents 
the 
image 
of 
a 
psychic 
movement 
in 
the 
state 
of 
consciousness.) 


One 
is 
justified 
in 
thinking, 
however, 
that 
a 
thorough 
understanding 
of 
this 
word 
would 
show 
a 
meaning 
which 
would 
reveal 
to 
us 
the 
mental 
condition 
of 
this 
girl. 
As 
a 
rule 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
obtain 
an 
understanding 
of 
hallucinations 
of 
this 
sort, 
at 
least 
not 
more 
difficult 
than 
for 
short 
fragments 
of 
dreams. 
Asked 
concerning 
the 
impression 
of 
the 
new-word 
formation, 
the 
patient 
answered, 
she 
recalled 
" 
alhambra 
" 
by 
this 
word. 
For 
this 
she 
had 
evidently 
always 
had 
a 
great 
interest; 
once 
it 
stood 
proudly, 
but 
it 
was 
now 
fallen 
into 
decay, 
a 
ruin. 
The 
beginning 
of 
the 
word 
" 
Esk 
" 
was 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
word 
"Eskimo," 
in 
" 
E(tru)skan 
" 
too, 
these 
letters 
are 
found. 
The 
race 
of 
' 
Baskes 
' 
' 
occurred 
also 
to 
her; 
in 
this 
word 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
"Esk" 
appears. 
The 
patient 
thus 
indicates 
the 
way 
she 
has 
followed 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
new 
word, 
she 
has 
joined 
a 
fragment 
of 
the 
names 
of 
ancient 
tribes 
and 
the 
name 
of 
a 
ruined 
city. 
Finally 
the 
word 
"alhambra" 
had 
for 
her 
also 
only 
the 
significance 
of 
a 
fragment, 
and 
hence 
we 
are 
justified 
in 
assuming 
the 
thought 
of 
being 
broken, 
made 
small, 
made 
short, 
would 
emerge 
in 
the 
interpretation 
of 
the 
hallucination. 
The 
letters 
" 
skad 
" 
belong, 
as 
the 
patient 
easily 
discovered, 
to 
the 
word 
"kaskade." 
She 
said 
she 
was 
certain 
of 
this 
because 
she 
had 
used 
the 
expression 
" 
ganze 
kaskaden 
" 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
period, 
the 
menstrual 
period 
just 
passed. 


When 
it 
is 
taken 
into 
consideration 
that 
this 
patient 
was 
about 
to 
be 
married, 
the 
connection 
of 
this 
construction 
of 
new 
words 
with 
the 
psychic 
condition 
can 
be 
understood 
without 
anything 
further. 
That 
she 
is 
disinclined 
to 
marry 
one 
can 
see 
from 
her 
neurosis 
which 
formed 
a 
ready 
obstacle.* 


*As 
has 
already 
been 
mentioned, 
the 
anticipation 
of 
marriage 
furnishes 
one 
of 
the 
most 
potent 
moments 
for 
the 
accentuation 
of 
a 
neurosis 
or 
for 
the 
development 
of 
a 
psychosis-The 
contrary 
expressions 
of 
these 
patients, 
such, 
for 
instance, 
as 
" 
I 
would 
like 
to 
be 
married," 
always 
prove 
themselves 
to 
be 
platonic. 


In 
the 
hallucination 
there 
is 
a 
disconnected 
sketch 
of 
the 
following 
train 
of 
thought: 
the 
glory 
of 
my 
virginity 
will 
be 
destroyed 
I 
shall 
bear 
a 
new 
race 
I 
shall 
be 
forced 
to 
sacrifice 
whole 
cascades 
of 
blood. 
When 
I 
had 
brought 
the 
interpretation 
up 
to 
this 
point, 
the 
patient 
helped 
me 
further 
by 
relating 
that 
when 
she 
was 
eight 
years 
old 
she 
had 
heard 
that 
a 
woman 
of 
her 
acquaintance 



had 
died 
from 
loss 
of 
blood 
at 
the 
birth 
of 
a 
child. 
Since 
then 
she 
had 
always 
been 
afraid 
of 
childbirth. 
What 
now 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
this 
hallucination? 
Can 
it 
be 
defined, 
even 
remotely, 
by 
the 
word 
"wish-fulfillment"? 
The 
meaning 
of 
this 
new 
formation 
of 
words 
is 
the 
anticipatory 
interpretation 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
a 
danger 
to 
be 
feared, 
of 
being 
humiliated, 
or 
the 
fear 
of 
becoming 
a 
ruin, 
as 
she 
had 
often 
called 
her 
mother, 
of 
dying 
like 
the 
woman 
she 
remembered 
in 
her 
childhood. 
This 
feeling 
against 
female 
functions 
(and 
the 
patient 
indeed 
strove 
also 
consciously 
against 
marriage) 
is 
of 
older 
date, 
originated 
in 
early 
childhood, 
and 
was 
at 
that 
time 
embodied 
in 
the 
wish 
to 
be 
ahead, 
healthy, 
strong 
like 
her 
father. 
It 
became 
then 
a 
fictitious 
guiding 
line 
and 
was 
filled 
with 
a 
logical 
content, 
which 
was 
grouped 
about 
a 
masculine 
ideal 
of 
personality, 
and 
was 
filled 
also 
with 
a 
fear 
in 
the 
same 
direction 
against 
a 
feminine 
role. 
Now 
I 
was 
able 
also 
to 
make 
clear 
to 
the 
patient 
the 
meaning 
of 
her 
stomach 
neurosis. 
It 
was 
a 
hallucinatory 
excitement 
which 
reflected 
the 
hardships 
of 
pregnancy, 
warning 
the 
patient 
to 
avoid 
the 
same. 
In 
the 
waking 
condition, 
in 
the 
dream 
and 
in 
hallucinations 
and 
in 
the 
neurosis 
there 
was 
a 
harmony 
of 
the 
tendency 
towards 
security 
do 
not 
be 
a 
woman, 
do 
not 
submit, 
be 
a 
man! 


This 
girl 
manifested 
in 
her 
demeanor 
rough, 
resolute 
traits, 
and 
could 
get 
along 
with 
no 
one. 
Her 
ambition 
flamed 
blazingly 
and 
made 
her 
intolerant. 
She 
required 
unconditional 
submission 
from 
her 
fiance 
whom 
she 
treated 
very 
badly 
and 
with 
whom 
she 
often 
dissolved 
all 
relations. 
Once, 
however, 
when 
he 
turned 
his 
attention 
to 
another 
girl, 
she 
offered 
everything 
in 
order 
to 
hold 
him. 
One 
of 
the 
day 
dreams 
of 
her 
childhood 
consisted 
in 
the 
phantasy 
that 
the 
whole 
human 
race 
was 
going 
to 
destruction 
and 
that 
she 
alone 
would 
remain, 
an 
analogy 
with 
the 
myth 
of 
the 
flood 
in 
which 
the 
ego-centric, 
inimical 
nature 
of 
the 
patient 
is 
clearly 
manifested. 


In 
the 
cases 
of 
many 
patients 
who 
show 
signs 
of 
the 
tendency 
to 
"have 
everything" 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
girl 
just 
described, 
traits 
of 
character 
of 
an 
opposite 
nature 
are 
found. 
They 
are 
often 
of 
such 
importunate 
honorableness, 
modesty 
and 
contentedness 
that 
the 
peculiar 
accentuation 
of 
these 
qualities 
awakens 
the 
suspicion 
of 
a 
special 
arrangement. 
Their 
conscience 
always 
makes 
itself 
heard 
and 
their 
feeling 
of 
being 
at 
fault 
is 
always 
ready 
to 
react 
on 
the 
slightest 
occasion."

The 
solution 
of 
this 
enigma 
which 
has 
puzzled 
humanity 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
is 
furnished 
by 
an 
understanding 
of 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
which 
breaks 
through 
the 
direct 
aggressive 
guiding 
line, 
and 
which 
puts 
an 
end 
to 
greed 
and 
immoderation 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
egoistic 
ideal 
is 
threatened 
by 
them. 
Conscience 
then 
constitutes, 
so 
to 
speak, 
an 
intermediate 
guiding 
fiction, 
as 
does 
also 
its 
anticipatory 
exaltation, 
the 
abstract 
self-accusation 
of 
guilt. 
These 
are 
instances 
in 
which 
all 
actions 
planned 
and 
anticipatory 
preparations 
are 
changed 
around 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
they 
are 
not 
injurious, 
that 
they 
permit 
the 
feeling 
of 
personal 
worth 
to 
be 
preserved. 
We 
perceive 
on 
this 
point 
the 
opposition 
in 
the 
original 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
as 
a 
compensation 
for 
the 
feeling 
of 
uncertainty 
which 
has 
come 
to 
moral 
expression. 
Now 
the 
neurotic 
can 
exclude 
a 
number 
of 
possibilities 
which 
could 
degrade 
him. 
In 
other 
relations, 
also', 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
is 
recognizable, 
in 
morals, 
in 
religion, 
in 
superstition, 
in 
stirrings 
of 
conscience 
and 
in 
the 
feeling 
of 
guilt. 
They 
all 
form 
themselves 
into 
rigid 
formulae 
and 
principles 
such 
as 
the 
uncertain 
neurotic 
loves. 
And 
he 
can 
prepare 
himself 
by 
practice 
in 
small 
things, 
test 
his 
moral 
strength 
on 
mere 
nothings 
and 
especially 
principiis 
obsta 
secures 
himself 
from 
a 
moral 
fall 
which 
he 
exaggerates 
in 
anticipation 
by 
feeling 
the 
moral 
defeat 
beforehand. 
This 
last 
hallucinatory 
expedient 
resembles 
the 
security 
through 
neurotic 
anxiety, 
and 
indeed 
conscientiousness, 
self-accusation, 
and 
anxiety 
often 
complement 
each 
other, 
or 
alternate 
with 
each 
other, 
in 
the 
neurosis. 
The 
knowledge 
of 
this 
fact 
is 
of 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
psychotherapeutist 
for 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
connection 
between 
masturbation 
and 
neurosis 
and 
from 
which 
may 
be 
comprehended 
the 
significance 
as 
a 
security 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
self-accusation 
constructed 
from 
the 
fact 
of 
onanism. 
If 
this 
feeling 
of 
guilt 
is 
brought 
into 
junction 
with 
the 
masturbation 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
working 
as 
a 
brake 
against 
the 
force 
of 
sexuality, 
both 
constitute, 
later, 
a 
base 
of 
operation 
from 
which 
the 
patient 
augments 
his 
neurotic 
disposition 
in 
order 
to 
guard 
against 
a 
reduction 
of 
his 
ego-consciousness. 
As 
a 
rule, 
both 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
anticipated 
results, 
as 
impotence, 
tabes, 
paralysis, 
loss 
of 
memory 
are 
used 
as 
an 
excuse 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
making 
decisions, 
and 
always 
also 
for 
deepening 
the 
fear 
of 
the 
sexual 
partner. 


I 
have 
often 
described 
connections 
of 
this 
sort 
in 
this 
and 
in 
previous 
works. 
In 
the 
neurosis, 
honorableness 
and 
conscientiousness 
border 
on 



pedantry, 
therefore 
we 
shall 
not 
be 
surprised 
to 
find 
how 
often 
these 
qualities 
draw 
their 
real 
value 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
thereby 
the 
neurotic 
is 
placed 
in 
a 
position 
to 
humiliate 
others, 
to 
come 
into 
conflict 
with 
them, 
to 
raise 
himself 
above 
others 
and 
press 
them 
into 
his 
service. 
It 
is 
just 
the 
neurotic 
whose 
tendency 
to 
dominate 
contains 
the 
scheme 
" 
to* 
possess 
everything" 
and 
who 
not 
rarely 
preserves 
memories 
of 
sins, 
who 
will 
usually 
take 
care 
not 
to 
betray 
a 
secret 
which 
would 
certainly 
result 
in 
his 
humiliation. 
He 
will 
rather 
seek 
to 
preserve 
appearances 
even 
with 
great 
pains 
and 
anxiety;: 
will 
blush 
anxiously 
when 
he 
lifts 
his 
own 
pocketbook 
from 
the 
floor, 
and 
will 
avoid 
being 
alone 
in 
a 
strange 
room 
in 
order 
not 
to 
fall 
under 
suspicion 
of 
theft, 
if 
something 
should 
be 
missed. 
In 
like 
manner 
I 
found 
an 
obstinate 
wish 
to 
pay 
in 
advance, 
to 
owe 
nothing, 
in 
patients 
to 
whom 
every 
expenditure 
seemed 
a 
reduction 
of 
their 
ego-consciousness. 
They 
preferred 
undergoing 
an 
evil 
and 
making 
an 
end 
of 
it 
to 
enduring 
one 
without 
end, 
but 
had 
at 
the 
same 
time 
a 
feeling 
of 
superiority 
in 
doing 
this, 
over 
the 
one 
who 
received 
the 
money. 


In 
the 
same 
manner 
the 
fanatic 
adherence 
to 
truth 
in 
many 
neurotics 
proves 
itself 
to 
be, 
as 
a 
rule, 
a 
reaction 
of 
the 
weaker 
against 
the 
superior 
power 
(in 
this 
connection 
the 
original 
picture 
of 
the 
same 
may 
called, 
the 
"enfant 
terrible"). 


I 
learned 
from 
the 
previous 
history 
of 
a 
catatonic 
that 
he 
was 
oppressed 
and 
humiliated 
by 
his 
wife. 
One 
night 
he 
broke 
out 
in 
sobs 
and 
told 
her 
that 
he 
had 
deceived 
her 
by 
an 
affair 
with 
a 
servant 
girl. 
His 
masculine 
protest 
made 
use 
of 
this 
expedient, 
adultery, 
in 
order 
to 
connect 
with 
it 
an 
open 
confession. 
Again, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
the 
neurotic 
conjunction 
with 
which 
we 
are 
already 
acquainted, 
it 
became 
apparent 
that 
the 
wife 
not 
only 
had 
the 
stronger 
will, 
but 
had, 
also, 
the 
command 
of 
the 
purse. 
The 
patient, 
himself 
a 
weak 
man, 
was 
obliged 
to 
live 
upon 
her 
money, 
which 
the 
wife 
and 
her 
family 
made 
the 
source 
of 
much 
unpleasantness, 
though 
they 
had 
known 
all 
about 
it 
beforehand. 
In 
order 
to 
protect 
himself 
from 
the 
superiority 
of 
his 
wife 
and 
not 
to 
submit 
entirely 
to 
her 
influence, 
he, 
already 
engaged 
in 
conflict 
over 
the 
male 
domination, 
arrived 
at 
an 
arrangement 
of 
a 
psychic 
impotence. 
The 
wife, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
overcame 
this 
impotence 
and 
humiliated 
the 
husband 
openly. 
His 
flirtation 
with 
the 
nurse 
girl 
was 
the 
beginning 
of 
his 
revenge. 
This 
could 
only 
be 
effective 
in 
a 
way 
to 
elevate 
him 
if 
he 
confessed 
his 
adultery 
in 
a 
manly 
way; 
therefore 
he 
had 
recourse 
to 
the 
love 
of 
truth, 
which 



had 
already 
served 
him 
as 
a 
vehicle 
for 
all 
sorts 
of 
rascality. 
The 
fact 
that 
he 
confessed 
his 
fault 
with 
tears 
was 
in 
keeping 
with 
his 
cowardice 
before 
a 
decision, 
but 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
made 
it 
easier 
for 
him 
to 
communicate 
the 
painful 
intelligence 
to 
his 
wife. 
The 
further 
course 
turned 
out 
against 
the 
masculine 
triumph 
of 
the 
psychic 
hermaphrodite; 
the 
wife 
went 
further 
in 
her 
aggression 
and 
complained 
to 
her 
relatives, 
who 
in 
turn 
reproached 
him 
in 
the 
most 
severe 
manner. 
Now 
he 
fell 
into 
an 
apathy 
with 
an 
augmented 
craving 
for 
security, 
wished 
to 
undo 
his 
transgression 
as 
it 
had 
not 
assisted 
him 
to 
the 
masculine 
triumph 
and 
found 
the 
solution 
in 
a 
fiction 
of 
a 
purifying 
miracle 
which 
God 
had 
wrought 
in 
him. 
He 
was 
again 
on 
the 
heights, 
his 
predestination 
phantasy 
broke 
out, 
he 
stood 
in 
communication 
with 
God, 
received 
orders 
and 
commands 
from 
Him, 
and 
built 
up 
a 
psychotic 
system 
in 
which 
he 
wandered 
on 
the 
earth 
as 
a 
prophet. 
The 
masturbation, 
too, 
which 
he 
practiced 
openly, 
he 
designated 
as 
a 
miracle, 
in 
order 
thus 
to 
escape 
the 
feeling 
of 
humiliation. 
Stereotypies 
were 
manifested, 
among 
other 
ways, 
by 
an 
occasional 
upright 
position 
of 
the 
body 
and 
by 
holding 
the 
head 
high, 
a 
motion 
which 
I 
was 
able 
to 
interpret 
as 
symbolic, 
as 
a 
phantasy 
of 
the 
erection 
of 
the 
male 
organ. 


“To 
tell 
someone 
a 
bitter 
truth 
" 
This 
expression 
contains 
the 
kernel 
for 
the 
comprehension 
of 
the 
case 
just 
described. 
The 
neurotic 
often 
makes 
use 
of 
the 
truth 
in 
order 
to 
cause 
pain 
to 
others. 
One 
never 
hears 
agreeable 
truths 
from 
neurotic 
patients 
without 
a 
reaction 
immediately 
becoming 
visible, 
usually 
in 
the 
form 
of 
an 
aggravation 
of 
the 
suffering. 
To 
every 
emotion 
of 
love, 
which 
is 
regarded 
as 
feminine, 
as 
a 
submission, 
there 
follows 
an 
emotion 
of 
hate, 
as 
masculine 
protest, 
the 
latter 
in 
the 
garments 
of 
truth 
honor 
bright! 
Also 
in 
this 
case 
of 
dementia 
praecox 
we 
find 
a 
stage 
where 
the 
doubt 
of 
the 
neurotic 
concerning 
his 
own 
masculinity 
is 
bridged 
over 
by 
means 
of 
expedients 
and 
by 
a 
tightening 
of 
the 
guiding 
fiction 
where 
the 
compensatory 
craving 
for 
security 
gives 
the 
impulse 
to 
take 
a 
guiding 
symbol 
verbally 
and 
to 
construct 
the 
fiction 
(as 
if 
the 
neurotic 
were 
a 
teacher, 
the 
Emperor, 
Savior). 
Other 
traits, 
such 
as 
moodiness 
and 
unsociability, 
are 
likewise 
to 
be 
recognized 
as 
neurotic 
anticipatory 
preparations, 
as 
always 
fitted 
to 
annihilate 
the 
superiority 
of 
others 
and 
to 
prevent 
them 
from 
carrying 
out 
their 
will. 


The 
neurotic 
individual 
is 
the 
typical 
kill-joy 
and 
peace 
destroyer. 
He 
is 
misled 
by 
his 
megalomaniac 
ideal 
in 
conditions 
of 
greatest 
uncertainty 
and 
is 



always 
busy 
trying 
to 
hypostasize 
and 
deify 
his 
own 
guiding 
line, 
and 
to 
cross 
those 
of 
others. 
These 
traits 
are 
also 
capable 
of 
a 
more 
extended 
application. 
The 
neurotic 
regards 
his 
inability 
to 
get 
along 
with 
others, 
his 
disturbing 
attacks, 
as 
proofs 
that 
others 
wish 
to 
injure 
him, 
and 
erects, 
as 
a 
protection, 
the 
wall 
of 
his 
principles 
within 
which 
his 
spirit 
of 
mastery 
is 
able 
to 
develop. 
Here 
emerge 
tendencies 
such 
as 
the 
desire 
to 
be 
alone, 
sometimes 
the 
desire 
to 
be 
buried; 
or 
pictures, 
such 
as 
being 
buried 
alive 
or 
concealed 
in 
the 
mother's 
body 
(Gruner). 
At 
times 
I 
have 
discovered 
as 
a 
fulfillment 
of 
this 
wish 
to 
dominate 
in 
solitude, 
the 
habit 
of 
remaining 
a 
long 
time 
on 
the 
stool. 
Wholly 
in 
the 
same 
direction, 
i.e., 
of 
gaining 
the 
upper 
hand, 
the 
neurotic 
carries 
out 
his 
exaggerated 
yielding 
and 
adaptability, 
but 
the 
patient 
is 
in 
this 
always 
on 
the 
watch, 
although 
he 
tries, 
too, 
in 
this 
way 
to 
captivate 
those 
who 
are 
stronger, 
to 
deviate 
toward 
the 
more 
manly 
line 
and 
to 
enjoy 
his 
open 
triumph. 


The 
inclination 
to 
daintiness 
furnishes 
the 
neurotic 
with 
the 
same 
readiness 
for 
conflict. 
By 
this 
means 
he 
can 
decry 
everything, 
secure 
himself 
against 
decisions 
and 
lay 
claim 
to 
his 
prerogative. 
He 
will 
be 
finicky 
in 
such 
instances 
as 
harmonize 
best 
with 
his 
tendencies 
and 
where 
he 
can 
gain 
the 
most 
advantages. 
In 
eating, 
in 
the 
choice 
of 
friends, 
in 
amorous 
relations, 
he 
secures 
to 
himself 
thereby 
a 
troublesome 
superiority. 
Everyone 
is 
obliged 
to 
make 
allowances 
for 
him 
because 
he 
is 
sick, 
nervous. 
This 
trait 
of 
character 
rises 
to 
great 
performances 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
fear 
of 
the 
sexual 
partner, 
of 
marriage, 
makes 
use 
of 
it. 
No 
girl, 
no 
man, 
then 
amounts 
to 
anything, 
and 
a 
twisted 
ideal 
furnishes 
the 
neurotic 
with 
a 
point 
of 
support 
for 
the 
disparagement 
of 
every 
one. 
At 
other 
times 
and 
in 
other 
relations, 
this 
trait 
manifests 
itself 
as 
an 
arrangement, 
as 
the 
foresight 
of 
an 
individual 
who 
has 
not 
as 
yet 
conquered 
the 
weak 
point 
of 
his 
feeling 
of 
inferiority. 
He 
can 
also 
be 
moderate 
"when 
the 
wind 
blows 
from 
the 
northwest," 
when 
his 
will 
to 
power 
requires 
it. 
One 
of 
the 
universal 
methods 
of 
quieting 
children 
when 
they 
show 
discontent 
is 
by 
comforting 
them 
with 
a 
prospect 
of 
the 
future, 
when 
they 
will 
be 
big, 
grown 
up. 
One 
often 
hears 
children 
themselves 
say, 
' 
When 
I 
am 
grown 
up, 
I 
will. 
. 
." 
The 
problem 
of 
growth 
engages 
the 
attention 
of 
children 
to 
an 
extraordinary 
extent 
and 
in 
the 
course 
of 
their 
development 
they 
are 
constantly 
reminded 
of 
it. 
It 
is 
thus 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
size 
of 
his 
body, 
the 
growth 
of 
his 
hair, 
of 
the 
teeth, 
and 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
comes 
to 
speculations 



concerning 
the 
sexual 
organs 
by 
the 
growth 
of 
the 
pubes 
and 
the 
genital 
organs. 
The 
entrance 
of 
the 
child 
upon 
his 
masculine 
role, 
of 
which 
we 
have 
often 
spoken, 
requires 
a 
distinct 
largeness 
of 
the 
person 
of 
the 
individual 
and 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
his 
body. 
Where 
this 
is 
denied 
him 
and 
here 
we 
encounter 
again 
the 
basis 
of 
somatic 
inferiority, 
especially 
the 
causal 
rickets 
(thymus 
anomalies?), 
anomalies 
of 
the 
thyroid, 
of 
the 
sperm 
glands, 
hypophysis, 
etc. 
the 
child 
has 
recourse 
on 
account 
of 
its 
desire 
for 
masculine 
value 
to 
the 
positing 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
Then 
it 
acquires 
the 
heightened 
impulse 
to 
covetousness, 
envy, 
bragging, 
greed, 
activity, 
together 
with 
the 
acute 
feeling 
of 
contrast 
and 
begins 
to 
measure 
himself 
constantly 
with 
others, 
especially 
with 
the 
persons 
of 
importance 
in 
his 
environment, 
and 
finally 
with 
the 
heroes 
from 
tales 
and 
stories. 
Thus 
the 
individual 
comes 
to 
a 
wishful 
contemplation 
of 
the 
future 
and 
the 
phantasy 
incited 
by 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
fills 
all 
wishes. 



CHAPTER 
IV 


THE 
DEROGATORY 
TENDENCY 
TO 
DISPARAGE 
OTHERS; 
OBSTINACY 
AND 
WILDNESS; 
THE 
SEXUAL 
RELATIONS 
OF 
NEUROTICS 
AS 
A 
MEANS 
OF 
COMPARISON; 
SYMBOLIC 
EMASCULATION; 
FEELING 
OF 
BEING 
BELITTLED; 
EQUALITY 
TO 
MAN 
AS 
A 
LIFE-PLAN; 
SIMULATION 
AND 
NEUROSIS; 
SUBSTITUTE 
FOR 
MASCULINITY; 
IMPATIENCE; 
DISCONTENT; 
INACCESSIBILITY 


THE 
compulsive 
craving 
of 
the 
neurotic 
to 
fill 
his 
egoistic 
ideal 
with 
the 
overvalued 
masculine 
traits 
impels 
him, 
especially 
because 
of 
the 
obstacles 
of 
reality, 
to 
a 
change 
in 
the 
formula 
of 
his 
guiding 
line, 
so 
that 
he 
attempts 
to 
attain 
the 
goal 
which 
he 
values 
as 
equal 
to 
the 
masculine 
goal 
by 
means 
of 
circuitous 
paths. 
What 
drives 
him 
to 
a 
psychosis 
is 
his 
longing 
to 
realize 
an 
unattainable 
ideal. 
Should 
he 
suffer 
a 
defeat 
in 
the 
main 
line 
of 
his 
masculine 
protest, 
or 
should 
he 
even 
anticipate 
such 
a 
-defeat, 
he 
seeks 
a 
substitute 
which 
he 
temporarily 
considers 
as 
of 
equal 
value 
through 
an 
arrangement 
of 
intensified 
reassuring 
expedients. 
At 
this 
point 
there 
begins 
as 
a 
rule 
that 
process 
of 
psychic 
transformation 
which 
we 
designate 
as 
neurosis, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
the 
guiding 
fiction 
does 
not 
lead 
to 
a 
violation 
of 
reality, 
the 
patient 
only 
feeling 
it 
as 
a 
disturbing 
element, 
as 
is 
the 
case 
in 
neurasthenia, 
hypochondriasis, 
anxiety 
and 
compulsion 
neuroses 
and 
in 
hysteria. 
In 
the 
psychosis 
the 
guiding 
masculine 
fiction 
appears 
disguised 
in 
pictures 
and 
symbols 
of 
infantile 
origin. 
The 
patient 
then 
conducts 
himself 
no 
longer 
as 
if 
he 
wished 
to 
be 
masculine, 
above, 
and 
as 
if 
he 
sought 
to 
attain 
this 
end 
by 
every 
possible 
means, 
but 
through 
the 
medium 
of 
anticipation 
as 
though 
he 
already 
had 
attained 
all 
these 
ends 
and 
only 
indicates 
at 
first, 
incidentally 
and 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
a 
foundation 
(depression, 
persecutory 
and 
self-accusatory 
ideas, 
ideas 
of 
poverty), 
that 
he 
is 
underneath, 
unmanly, 
feminine. 



For 
the 
sake 
of 
clarity, 
I 
will 
now 
proceed 
to 
the 
description 
of 
some 
neurotic 
character 
traits 
which 
tend 
in 
a 
direct 
line 
to 
the 
masculine 
egoistic 
ideal, 
or 
are 
so 
closely 
connected 
therewith 
that 
they 
force 
themselves 
upon 
the 
understanding 
as 
only 
slight 
deviations 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
They 
have 
been 
generally 
regarded 
as 
active, 
masculine 
traits 
and 
the 
neurotic 
can 
thus 
appeal 
to 
this 
general 
opinion 
in 
which 
there 
is 
agreement. 
But 
we 
have 
already 
endeavored 
to 
show 
in 
previous 
chapters 
that 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
masculine 
traits 
the 
choice 
of 
the 
fictitious 
goal 
is 
dependent 
upon 
and 
guided 
only 
within 
circumscribed 
limits 
by 
the 
conscious 
understanding 
of 
the 
neurotic 
or 
even 
of 
the 
critical 
observer. 
He 
also 
makes 
use 
of 
such 
guiding 
lines 
which 
to 
general 
logic 
do 
not 
always 
seem 
masculine, 
or 
at 
least 
only 
in 
part 
so, 
such 
for 
example 
as 
coquetry, 
deception, 
etc. 
As 
the 
direct 
traits 
of 
character 
in 
line 
with 
the 
masculine 
protest 
may 
be 
emphasized, 
the 
frequently 
displayed 
tendency 
to 
be 
a 
man 
through 
and 
through, 
courageous, 
ready 
for 
attack, 
open, 
hard-hearted, 
cruel, 
to 
excel 
everyone 
in 
strength, 
influence, 
power, 
wisdom, 
etc. 
When 
the 
fundamental 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
demands 
stronger 
reassuring 
compensations 
because 
"of 
an 
expected 
defeat 
or 
the 
suspicion 
of 
one, 
this 
compensation 
ensues 
by 
a 
strengthening 
of 
the 
readiness 
for 
conflict 
which 
now 
strives 
toward 
the 
masculine 
feeling 
of 
superiority, 
often 
by 
circuitous 
and 
more 
abstract 
ways, 
revealing 
simultaneous 
and 
often 
contradictory 
traits 
after 
the 
manner 
of 
tricks 
and 
artifices. 
It 
is 
then 
that 
the 
neurotic 
may 
manifest 
pliancy 
instead 
of 
obstinacy, 
or 
side 
by 
side 
with 
it, 
or 
as 
the 
occasion 
may 
require 
it, 
traits 
of 
exorbitant 
arrogance 
and 
modesty, 
roughness 
and 
mildness, 
courage 
and 
cowardice, 
lust 
for 
power 
and 
submissiveness. 
masculinity 
and 
femininity, 
all 
of 
which 
are 
used 
to 
gain 
security 
from 
defeat 
or 
in 
order 
to 
permit 
him 
by 
circuitous 
ways 
to 
enhance 
his 
own 
egoistic 
ideal 
or 
disparage 
that 
of 
others. 
That 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
conquer 
by 
weakness, 
submissiveness 
and 
modesty 
is 
shown 
in 
the 
example 
of 
women 
and 
by 
many 
examples 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
world. 


The 
dominancy 
of 
the 
self-created 
deities, 
of 
the 
guiding 
fiction 
is 
always 
easily 
discernible 
and 
is 
revealed 
in 
the 
psychosis 
with 
unmistakable 
clarity. 
I 
will 
endeavor 
to 
show 
by 
means 
of 
a 
dream 
of 
a 
22-year-old 
girl 
who 
was 
suffering 
from 
enuresis 
nocturna 
and 
in 
the 
daytime 
from 
frequent 
outbreaks 
of 
rage 
and 
ill-humor, 
who 
could 
get 
along 
with 
no 
one 
but 
me, 
and 
who 



often 
had 
suicidal 
ideas, 
that 
all 
of 
these 
phenomena, 
together 
with 
other 
traits 
of 
lust 
for 
power, 
of 
obstinacy 
or 
of 
anxiety 
were 
under 
the 
guidance 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
and 
that 
this 
protest 
was 
dependent 
in 
turn 
upon 
a 
constitutional 
inferiority 
of 
the 
urinary 
organ, 
which 
in 
combination 
with 
ugliness 
and 
mental 
retardation 
gave 
the 
impulse 
to 
the 
compensatory 
exhibition 
of 
an 
exaggerated 
masculine 
guiding 
line. 
In 
order 
to 
make 
the 
case 
brief 
and 
comprehensible, 
I 
preface 
the 
remark 
that 
the 
patient 
had 
applied 
the 
realities 
of 
her 
childhood 
to 
a 
reassuring 
neurosis, 
had 
constructed 
the 
enuresis 
as 
an 
ever-ready 
expedient 
and 
always 
had 
recourse 
to 
this 
symptom 
when 
her 
egoistic 
feeling 
suffered 
a 
humiliation. 
In 
this 
case, 
too, 
there 
was 
manifested 
the 
colossal 
power 
of 
the 
tendency 
to 
disparagement 
in 
the 
arrangement 
of 
the 
seizures 
which 
drove 
the 
mother 
to 
a 
powerless 
despair, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
patient 
disparaged 
her 
mother 
in 
the 
usual 
form 
of 
an 
allusion 
by 
excusing 
herself 
from 
all 
fault 
and 
throwing 
the 
blame 
on 
another. 
The 
following 
dream 
shows 
this 
in 
a 
specially 
clear 
manner. 


" 
My 
mother 
showed 
my 
friend 
the 
dirty 
cover 
of 
the 
bed. 
We 
began 
to 
quarrel. 
I 
say 
the 
cover 
is 
yours 
and 
begin 
to 
cry 
bitterly. 
I 
awake 
flooded 
in 
tears." 


A 
short 
time 
before 
she 
related 
to 
me 
that 
she 
often 
awoke 
weeping 
from 
sleep 
without 
knowing 
the 
cause 
of 
her 
weeping. 
From 
the 
connection 
of 
the 
genesis 
of 
the 
disease 
which 
was 
apparent 
even 
at 
that 
time, 
the 
weeping 
w; 
as 
of 
significance 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
mother, 
it 
represented 
one 
of 
the 
most 
usual 
childish 
procedures 
for 
diminishing 
the 
mother's 
superiority. 
After 
the 
communication 
of 
the 
dream 
she 
remarked, 
" 
You 
will 
certainly 
believe 
that 
you 
are 
right 
in 
your 
opinion 
concerning 
my 
weeping." 
One 
hears 
such 
remarks 
during 
a 
psychotherapeutic 
treatment 
as 
a 
regular 
thing, 
and 
must 
not 
overlook 
the 
concealed 
criticism 
therein 
as 
a 
device 
of 
the 
tendency 
to 
disparage, 
which 
is 
directed 
against 
everybody. 
The 
moderate 
expression 
of 
the 
same 
on 
this 
occasion 
led 
me 
to 
suspect 
that 
the 
cure 
of 
the 
neurosis 
was 
in 
progress, 
as 
the 
more 
lively 
reactions 
were 
absent. 
Formerly 
under 
similar 
circumstances 
she 
would 
have 
asserted 
sharply 
and 
passionately 
that 
I 
was 
wrong, 
or 
she 
would 
have 
omitted 
to 
mention 
or 
would 
have 
forgotten 
those 
dreams 
which 
confirmed 
my 
view. 
I 
was 
further 
confirmed 
in 
my 
assumption 
by 
the 
information 
that 
the 
patient 
after 
the 
dream 
immediately 
took 
off 
the 
slightly 
soiled 
bed 
linen 
and 
washed 
it 
in 
secret 
which 
was 
never 
the 
case 



before 
because 
the 
sight 
of 
the 
soiled 
linen 
was 
intended 
for 
her 
mother. 


For 
the 
explanation 
of 
the 
dream 
she 
related 
the 
following. 
She 
was 
firmly 
convinced 
that 
her 
mother 
told 
all 
her 
acquaintances 
about 
her 
enuresis. 
All 
her 
relatives 
seemed 
to 
know 
of 
her 
weakness. 
Once 
an 
uncle, 
obviously 
in 
order 
to 
comfort 
her, 
had 
informed 
her 
that 
both 
he 
and 
another 
brother 
had 
for 
a 
long 
time 
been 
in 
the 
habit 
of 
wetting 
the 
bed. 
In 
her 
dreams 
she 
reproached 
her 
mother, 
telling 
her, 
" 
The 
weakness 
is 
in 
your 
family, 
you 
are 
to 
blame 
if 
I 
soil 
the 
bed, 
the 
soiled 
cover 
is 
yours." 


She 
related 
further 
that 
in 
changing 
she 
often 
took 
a 
bed-slip 
instead 
of 
a 
cover; 
the 
one 
was 
closed, 
the 
other 
open; 
adding, 
" 
And 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
mistake 
them 
in 
the 
closet." 


Behind 
this 
thought 
lies 
the 
problem 
of 
open 
and 
shut 
which 
is 
clearly 
recognizable 
as 
an 
expression 
for 
the 
oppositeness 
of 
the 
sexes. 
She 
blames 
her 
mother 
for 
the 
disease, 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
casts, 
so 
to 
speak, 
a 
furtive 
glance 
at 
its 
source 
and 
spring, 
that 
is, 
the 
femininity 
for 
which 
she 
blames 
her 
mother 
and 
betrays 
to 
us 
in 
the 
masculine 
protest 
of 
her 
dreams 
how 
slightly 
she 
estimates 
the 
difference 
between 
man 
and 
woman. 
Similarly 
George 
Sand 
declared 
that 
there 
was 
only 
one 
sex. 
The 
quarrelling 
and 
weeping 
is 
the 
most 
important 
attitude 
of 
her 
aggression 
against 
her 
mother 
whose 
superiority 
she 
tried 
to 
destroy 
in 
this 
way 
as 
well 
as 
by 
her 
adherence 
to 
the 
enuresis. 
The 
fact 
that 
at 
the 
present 
time 
she 
operates 
against 
men 
by 
her 
enuritic 
device 
and 
thereby 
avoids 
marriage 
and 
"the 
tyranny 
of 
man," 
is 
a 
natural 
result 
to 
be 
inferred 
from 
other 
perspectives 
of 
her 
neurotic 
psyche. 


An 
example 
of 
the 
change 
of 
formula 
of 
the 
guiding 
masculine 
fiction 
which 
originally 
was 
" 
I 
will 
be 
a 
man," 
in 
the 
above 
described 
stage 
of 
the 
treatment 
was, 
" 
I 
will 
be 
superior 
to 
my 
mother 
like 
a 
man," 
and 
later 
on 
was 
expressed 
in 
the 
words, 


I 
will 
humiliate 
my 
mother 
by 
feminine 
means." 
In 
a 
dream, 
therefore, 
in 
a 
tentative, 
anticipatory 
test, 
this 
guiding 
line 
as 
we 
have 
maintained 
it 
to 
be 
comes 
to 
stronger 
expression. 
The 
dream 
is 
as 
follows: 


"I 
lie 
in 
a 
burning 
bed. 
All 
weep 
about 
me. 
I 
laugh 
aloud." 


A 
discussion 
of 
free 
love 
had 
preceded 
the 
dream. 
The 
burning 
bed, 
according 
to 
the 
patient's 
interpretation 
represented 
amorous 
pleasure. 
We 
translate 
according 
to 
our 
understanding 
of 
the 
dream. 
" 
How 
would 
it 
be 
if 
I 
should 
embrace 
free 
love? 
Then 
my 
mother 
would 
be 
humiliated 
but 
I 
would 



laugh 
at 
her, 
would 
be 
superior 
to 
her." 
Attention 
must 
also 
be 
called 
to 
the 
expression 
" 
burning," 
which 
arises 
so 
frequently 
in 
psychic 
constructions 
which 
spring 
from 
the 
urinary 
functions 
in 
antithesis 
to 
water 
(enuresis). 
*Adler, 
" 
Studie," 
1. 
c., 
Addendum. 
Freud 
has 
already 
touched 
upon 
the 
relationship 
between 
fire 
and 
water 
in 
the 
dream, 
and 
the 
allegorical 
representation 
based 
on 
this. 


The 
laughing 
in 
this 
dream 
is 
equivalent 
to 
the 
weeping 
in 
the 
first 
dream. 
Both 
show 
the 
aggressive 
tendency 
which 
seeks 
the 
mother's 
defeat. 
In 
this 
case, 
too, 
the 
untenability 
of 
the 
assumption 
of 
a 
splitting 
of 
personality 
is 
readily 
perceivable. 
Just 
as 
erroneous 
would 
be 
the 
assumption 
of 
a 
real 
sexual 
wish. 
This 
means 
would 
only 
serve 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
patient 
if 
the 
mother 
were 
set 
back 
and 
she 
could 
play 
the 
part 
of 
man 
in 
regard 
to 
her. 


The 
guiding 
fiction 
of 
the 
equality 
to 
man 
comes 
to 
expression 
in 
some 
way 
or 
other 
in 
all 
women 
and 
girls. 
As 
I 
was 
able 
to 
show 
in 
the 
foregoing 
case, 
it 
is 
the 
change 
of 
formula 
necessitated 
by 
reality 
which 
disguises 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
Hence 
it 
is 
essential 
in 
the 
analysis 
of 
neurotic 
female 
patients 
to 
discover 
at 
what 
point 
they 
protest 
against 
their 
femininity. 
This 
point 
can 
always 
be 
found, 
for 
the 
pressure 
toward 
the 
maximation 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness 
necessitates 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
reassuring 
guiding 
line 
which 
is 
erected 
as 
an 
antithesis 
to 
the 
idea 
" 
feminine." 
Cultural 
or 
uncultural 
ideas 
of 
emancipation, 
of 
militancy 
directed 
against 
men 
and 
their 
privileges 
are 
usually 
found 
in 
normal 
women 
and 
girls. 
They 
seek 
to 
diminish 
the 
distance 
as 
much 
as 
possible 
in 
dress, 
attitude, 
customs, 
laws, 
views 
of 
life. 
The 
masculine 
protest 
of 
neurotics 
is 
exaggerated 
in 
all 
these 
directions. 
In 
dress 
glaring 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
mannish 
fashions 
are 
affected, 
as 
the 
lengthening 
of 
single 
parts 
of 
dress 
and 
the 
wearing 
of 
strong 
high 
shoes. 
Or 
they 
avoid 
all 
fashions 
in 
dress 
which 
are 
distinctly 
feminine. 
Often 
there 
is 
a 
lively 
fight 
against 
the 
corset, 
a 
fight 
directed 
against 
the 
confinement, 
but 
which 
can 
also 
serve 
other 
purposes 
and 
is 
often 
brought 
into 
play 
to 
avoid 
seeing 
company 
and 
is 
most 
usually 
directed 
against 
the 
husband. 
The 
attitude 
and 
habits 
of 
neurotic 
women 
are 
often 
so 
masculine 
that 
it 
is 
noticeable 
from 
the 
first 
moment. 
Crossed 
legs 
and 
arms, 
and 
at 
times 
only 
indications 
which 
betray 
this 
tendency, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
tendency 
to 
take 
the 
left 
side 
as 
a 
man 
does 
or 
to 
allow 
no 
one 
to 
stand 
in 
front 
of 
them, 
etc., 
as 
in 
the 
dream. 
In 
the 
neurotic's 
view 
of 
life 
the 
usual 
ideal 
over



estimation 
of 
the 
masculine 
qualities 
is 
compensated 
for 
in 
a 
practical 
manner 
by 
the 
disparagement 
of 
men. 
In 
sexual 
relations 
anasthesia 
is 
the 
rule. 
Masculine 
variants, 
or 
those 
which 
disparage 
man 
are 
given 
preference. 


The 
neurotic 
psyche 
of 
men 
offers 
the 
same 
characteristics. 
It 
derives 
its 
artifices 
from 
an 
imaginary 
consciousness 
of 
femininity 
in 
order 
to 
arrive 
at 
a 
feeling 
of 
complete 
manliness. 
One 
of 
my 
patients 
who 
was 
suffering 
from 
asthma 
nervosum 
presented 
a 
very 
clear 
example 
of 
this 
dynamic. 
He 
had 
been 
a 
weak 
child 
and 
had 
suffered 
from 
the 
exudative 
diathesis, 
a 
relation 
to 
which 
Striimpell 
has 
called 
attention. 
His 
early 
catarrh 
permitted 
him 
already 
in 
childhood 
to 
press 
his 
mother 
into 
his 
service. 
She 
took 
him 
to 
her, 
cared 
for 
him 
in 
her 
bedroom 
and 
yielded 
to 
all 
his 
wishes. 
He 
was 
early 
placed 
under 
the 
care 
of 
a 
strict 
governess 
of 
whom 
he 
could 
not 
get 
the 
better, 
notwithstanding 
his 
rage 
and 
intractability. 
He 
felt 
weak 
before 
her 
and 
thus 
became 
acquainted 
with 
childish 
deceptions 
by 
means 
of 
which 
he 
was 
able 
to 
escape 
the 
governess, 
that 
is, 
he 
simulated 
and 
exaggerated 
the 
catarrhal 
affection 
by 
an 
arrangement 
of 
coughing 
and 
excitation 
of 
the 
bronchial 
tubes 
and 
larynx 
and 
by 
asthmatic 
phenomena 
which 
he 
produced 
after 
the 
manner 
of 
straining 
at 
difficult 
defecation, 
by 
tension 
of 
the 
abdomen 
and 
closing 
of 
the 
anus. 
He 
soon 
learned 
to 
know 
that 
these 
phenomena 
gained 
him 
a 
place 
in 
his 
mother's 
room, 
and 
in 
the 
course 
of 
years 
produced 
an 
asthmatic 
device 
which 
he 
set 
unconsciously 
into 
activity 
whenever 
he 
felt 
compelled 
on 
account 
of 
his 
overtense 
fictitious 
guiding 
goal 
to 
rise 
to 
the 
position 
of 
the 
lord 
of 
the 
house, 
and 
incidentally, 
of 
the 
governess. 
He 
soon 
gained 
the 
victory 
so 
that 
the 
governess 
was 
forbidden 
to 
treat 
him 
severely 
or 
to 
beat 
him. 


We 
see 
how 
his 
egotistic 
ideal 
had 
at 
its 
disposal 
from 
now 
on 
a 
neurotic 
weapon 
which 
placed 
him 
in 
a 
position 
to 
escape 
a 
defeat 
or 
to 
prevent 
the 
emergence 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
his 
original 
inferiority 
in 
a 
circuitous 
way, 
that 
is, 
no 
longer 
by 
obstinacy, 
rage, 
courage, 
manliness, 
but 
that 
he 
sought 
to 
get 
ahead 
by 
a 
sort 
of 
treachery, 
craft, 
unmanly 
conduct, 
cowardice, 
a 
leaning 
on 
the 
mother. 
This 
subterfuge, 
hypostasized. 
and 
elaborated 
to 
an 
unconsciously 
working 
mechanism, 
furnished 
him 
the 
necessary 
security 
for 
his 
whole 
life. 
His 
neurotic 
symptom 
which 
was 
constantly 
defended 
and 
laid 
claim 
to 
by 
further 
auxiliary 
lines 
of 
his 
trait 
of 
character, 
i.e., 
"to 
possess 
everything 
" 
by 
his 
lust 
for 
power, 
by 
his 
obstinacy 
and 
disputatiousness, 
and 



at 
the 
same 
time 
by 
his 
cowardice, 
fear 
of 
new 
undertakings, 
fear 
of 
men 
and 
women 
and 
by 
the 
tendency 
to 
disparagement 
which 
always 
evolves 
from 
these 
traits 
and 
which 
played 
such 
an 
important 
role 
in 
his 
aggressive 
devices 
furnished 
him 
a 
new 
organ, 
a 
means 
of 
making 
himself 
important 
in 
a 
special 
way, 
to 
dominate 
his 
world, 
inasmuch 
as 
he 
could 
always 
demand 
the 
protection 
of 
his 
mother. 
He 
felt 
safer 
with 
his 
mother 
than 
with 
his 
wife, 
and 
thus 
he 
was 
driven 
by 
necessity 
to 
fall 
in 
love 
with 
his 
mother, 
a 
love 
which 
upon 
closer 
analysis 
proved 
to 
be 
a 
sort 
of 
tyranny. 
Pregnancy 
phantasies 
reflected 
for 
him 
the 
feelings 
of 
humiliation 
connected 
with 
a 
feminine 
role 
and 
alternated 
with 
thoughts 
about 
castration 
and 
with 
phantasies 
about 
being 
a 
woman. 
His 
impulse 
to 
masturbation 
revealed 
the 
attempt 
to 
emancipate 
himself 
victoriously 
from 
women, 
to 
avoid 
a 
defeat, 
to 
conduct 
himself 
in 
a 
manly 
fashion, 
and 
was 
continued 
in 
similarly 
directed 
phantasies 
of 
greatness, 
both 
of 
which 
were 
forms 
of 
expression 
of 
his 
masculine 
protest. 
The 
imagined 
smallness 
of 
his 
genital 
organs, 
a 
thought 
which 
made 
a 
marked 
impression 
upon 
him, 
served 
him 
as 
a 
figure 
and 
perceptional 
form 
for 
his 
inferiority 
and 
feminine 
nature. 
From 
his 
childhood 
he 
sought 
to 
attribute 
all 
his 
unsuccessful 
efforts 
and 
defeats 
to 
his 
small 
penis, 
apperceived 
and 
grouped 
his 
experiences 
in 
this 
direction 
and 
according 
to 
related 
antithetical 
forms 
of 
apperception 
of 
"Manly-womanly." 
The 
small 
penis 
represented 
to 
him 
the 
figurative 
marginal 
concept 
between 
masculinity 
and 
femininity 
and 
was 
manifestly 
constructed 
as 
was 
the 
attitude 
of 
the 
patient 
on 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
corporal 
and 
psychic 
hermaphroditism 
and 
its 
tragedy. 
It 
is 
no 
wonder 
that 
in 
the 
psychoanalysis 
of 
these 
cases 
with 
the 
male-female 
manner 
of 
apperception 
which 
belongs 
to 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
neurotic 
psyche, 
one 
hits 
only 
upon 
sexual 
relations. 
They 
are 
all 
to 
be 
understood 
as 
a 
modus 
dicendi, 
as 
a 
jargon, 
and 
figurative 
modes 
of 
expression 
and 
are 
to 
be 
resolved 
into 
forms, 
whereby 
strength, 
victory, 
triumph 
come 
to 
expression 
in 
male 
sexual 
symbols, 
defeat 
in 
female 
and 
the 
neurotic 
artifices 
in 
both 
together, 
usually 
also 
in 
a 
perverse 
or 
hermaphroditic 
symbolism. 
It 
was 
easy 
to 
detect 
in 
our 
patient 
that 
besides 
the 
sexual 
mode 
of 
expression 
he 
had 
another 
fashion 
of 
apperception 
based 
upon 
the 
antithetical 
formula 
of 
inspiration-expiration 
which 
had 
been 
set 
in 
operation 
by 
the 
inferiority 
of 
his 
respiratory 
organ 
inclusive 
of 
the 
nose. 
Even 
the 
speech 
used 
for 
our 
mutual 
understanding 
likewise 
made 
use 
of 
such 
formulae 
and 
a 
sigh 
of 
relief 
from 
an 
oppressed 
breast 
could 
very 
well 
be 
clothed 
in 
the 
figure 
of 
"having 
air 



again." 
The 
patient 
was 
also 
able 
to 
represent, 
in 
pantomime 
form, 
memories 
of 
his 
boyhood 
race, 
a 
wild 
race 
to 
get 
to 
first 
place, 
the 
desire 
to 
be 
the 
first 
at 
the 
goal 
by 
means 
of 
breathless 
efforts. 
In 
a 
dream 
during 
the 
latter 
part 
of 
the 
treatment 
he 
made 
use 
of 
his 
ability 
to 
whistle 
(which 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
figuratively) 
in 
order 
to 
accentuate 
his 
manliness 
by 
respiration. 
The 
dream 
was 
as 
follows: 


"It 
seemed 
to 
me 
that 
four 
people 
were 
whistling. 
I 
remark 
that 
I 
can 
do 
it 
just 
as 
well 
as 
they." 


A 
short 
time 
before 
he 
had 
begun 
a 
relation 
with 
the 
governess 
in 
the 
family 
of 
his 
married 
brother 
and 
had 
asked 
her 
the 
question 
if 
his 
brother 
often 
visited 
his 
wife 
at 
night. 
The 
girl 
answered 
in 
the 
negative. 
Being 
able 
to 
whistle 
is 
the 
ideal 
of 
all 
small 
boys 
and 
some 
girls 
make 
efforts 
to 
acquire 
this 
manly 
attitude. 
In 
his 
dream 
he 
made 
a 
tentative 
comparison 
to 
see 
if 
he 
was 
the 
equal 
of 
his 
male 
relatives 
and 
thus 
arrived 
from 
this 
line, 
which 
originated 
in 
his 
feeling 
of 
effeminacy, 
to 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
He 
is 
the 
equal 
of 
all 
four. 


In 
this 
case 
too 
I 
found 
my 
observation 
confirmed 
that 
the 
neurotic 
feels 
his 
sexual 
libido, 
and 
manifests 
the 
same 
only 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
manner 
and 
degree 
that 
is 
required 
by 
his 
fictive 
goal, 
so 
that 
every 
psychological 
opinion 
which 
perceives 
in 
the 
libido 
a 
constitutionally 
acquired 
factor, 
in 
its 
alterations 
and 
fortunes 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
neurosis, 
becomes 
untenable. 
It 
is 
especially 
easy 
to 
arrange 
sexual 
excitations 
and 
they 
are 
always 
in 
some 
way 
subordinated 
to 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
The 
identification 
of 
masculinity 
with 
sexuality 
takes 
place 
in 
the 
neurosis 
by 
means 
of 
abstraction, 
symbolization 
and 
a 
figurative 
somatic-jargon, 
and 
it 
is 
this 
false 
artifice 
of 
the 
neurotic 
which 
fills 
his 
thought 
content 
with 
sexual 
pictures. 


The 
contentiousness 
and 
hidden 
querulousness 
which 
stand 
in 
the 
closest 
relation 
to 
the 
"tendency 
to 
disparagement 
present 
difficult 
tactical 
and 
pedagogic 
problems 
to 
the 
psychotherapeutist. 
They 
betray 
in 
every 
case 
the 
weak 
point, 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
of 
the 
patient 
which 
drives 
him 
to 
compensation. 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
uncover 
this 
neurotic 
aggressiveness 
by 
a 
very 
simple 
mode 
of 
approach. 
Let 
it 
be 
imagined 
that 
the 
neurotic 
feels 
that 
he 
has 
entirely 
lost 
his 
masculinity 
and 
feels 
himself 
humiliated 
and 
now 
let 
it 
be 
noted 
through 
what 
artifice 
he 
seeks 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
completion 
of 
his 
character 
or 
his 
overcompensation. 
One 
will 
then 
find 
a 
number 
of 



preparatory 
devices, 
characteristics, 
syndromes 
and 
symptoms 
which 
have 
for 
their 
aim 
the 
representation 
of 
an 
ideal 
organ, 
but 
one 
must 
however 
be 
prepared 
to 
view 
this 
as 
a 
riddle, 
which 
requires 
solution. 
For 
this 
"ideal 
organ," 
namely 
the 
neurosis 
or 
psychosis 
is 
of 
masculine 
origin 
and 
has 
for 
its 
purpose 
the 
prevention 
of 
a 
lowering 
of 
the 
patient's 
ego-consciousness, 
and 
to 
bring 
him 
closer 
to 
his 
masculine 
goal. 
Cruel 
reality, 
however, 
impedes 
the 
development 
of 
this 
fiction 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
that 
the 
most 
peculiar 
circuitous 
ways 
must 
be 
resorted 
to 
so 
that 
partial 
and 
apparent 
results 
are 
striven 
after 
without 
bringing 
the 
patient 
nearer 
to 
his 
goal. 
Without 
the 
help 
of 
the 
psychotherapeutist 
who 
in 
rare 
cases 
may 
prove 
to 
be 
a 
substitute 
for 
the 
fortunes 
of 
life, 
this 
"will 
to 
seem" 
becomes 
more 
and 
more 
accentuated 
in 
case 
of 
failure, 
and 
constantly 
strengthens 
the 
abstract, 
main 
line 
of 
the 
old 
guiding 
fiction. 
One 
of 
the 
principal 
circuitous 
ways 
along 
which 
this 
ideal 
organ 
i.e., 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
works, 
is 
the 
tendency 
to 
disparagement. 
That 
is 
the 
reason 
that 
it 
has 
been 
mentioned 
so 
often 
because 
it 
attracts 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
physician 
and 
is 
an 
expression 
of 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
neurotic 
impulse. 
It 
likewise 
furnishes 
an 
ever-present 
point 
of 
contact 
by 
means 
of 
which 
it 
may 
be 
possible 
to 
instil 
some 
insight 
into 
the 
patient 
and 
it 
is 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
those 
phenomena 
which 
Freud 
has 
described 
as 
resistance 
and 
has 
falsely 
viewed 
as 
the 
result 
of 
repressed 
sexual 
excitations. 
With 
this 
tendency 
the 
neurotic 
comes 
to 
the 
physician 
and 
he 
carries 
it 
with 
him, 
as 
does 
also 
the 
normal 
person, 
when 
he 
returns 
home. 
Only 
that 
then 
his 
increased 
insight 
stands 
as 
a 
guard, 
warning 
him 
against 
giving 
expression 
to 
this 
tendency 
and 
thus 
the 
patient 
is 
forced 
to 
show 
his 
desire 
to 
be 
"first" 
in 
other 
ways. 


One 
should 
never 
hesitate 
to 
guard 
all 
expressions 
of 
doubt, 
of 
critique, 
of 
forgetfulness, 
of 
tardiness, 
all 
demands 
of 
the 
patient, 
relapses 
after 
improvements, 
continued 
silence, 
as 
well 
as 
adherence 
to 
symptoms 
as 
effective 
means 
of 
the, 
tendency 
toward 
disparagement 
directed 
against 
the 
psychotherapeutist. 
One 
will 
rarely 
err 
in 
proceeding 
thus 
and 
usually 
be 
justified 
in 
this 
opinion 
by 
the 
comparison 
of 
coincident 
phenomena 
of 
a 
similar 
trend. 
The 
expressions 
of 
these 
tendencies 
are 
often 
of 
the 
most 
subtle 
nature. 
Shall 
I 
add 
that 
the 
most 
extensive 
experience 
and 
knowledge 
in 
regard 
to 
this 
" 
tendency 
to 
disparage 
" 
is 
barely 
sufficient 
to 
prevent 
being 
taken 
by 
surprise, 
and 
that 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
tact, 
renouncement 
of 
authority, 



and 
even 
friendliness, 
watchful 
interest 
and 
the 
consciousness 
of 
"being 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
sick 
person 
with 
whom 
it 
is 
out 
of 
place 
to 
engage 
in 
strife 
are 
indispensable 
to 
good 
results? 


I 
found 
it 
necessary 
once 
to 
explain 
to 
a 
stuttering 
patient 
the 
position 
of 
the 
larynx, 
by 
means 
of 
a 
drawing. 
Instead 
of 
taking 
the 
drawing 
home 
with 
him 
as 
he 
had 
intended 
in 
order 
to 
give 
it 
further 
consideration, 
he 
left 
it 
with 
me 
on 
the 
table. 
The 
next 
day 
he 
was 
a 
quarter 
of 
an 
hour 
late, 
first 
went 
to 
the 
toilet, 
related 
something 
of 
another 
patient 
who 
had 
complained 
of 
me, 
and 
after 
some 
silence 
related 
a 
dream 
which 
ran 
as 
follows: 


"It 
seemed 
to 
me 
that 
I 
had 
been 
looking 
at 
a 
drawing. 
A 
cylinder 
extended 
out 
from 
a 
circle; 
it 
did 
not 
run 
straight 
but 
sideways." 


The 
interpretation 
showed 
that 
this 
dream 
had 
reference 
to 
the 
drawing 
of 
the 
larynx 
on 
which 
the 
larynx 
was 
drawn 
straight 
downwards. 
The 
patient 
argued 
with 
me 
in 
the 
dream 
as 
though 
he 
would 
say 
"How 
would 
it 
be 
if 
my 
physician 
were 
wrong? 
' 
' 
and 
thus 
revealed 
to 
me 
his 
distrustful 
attitude 
the 
fear 
of 
being 
deceived 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
tendency 
to 
disparagement 
directed 
against 
me, 
which 
had 
been 
revealed 
by 
the 
subconscious 
measures 
of 
the 
forgetfulness, 
the 
delay, 
the 
recital 
of 
the 
complaint, 
the 
silence, 
and 
finally 
by 
the 
tentative 
endeavor 
in 
the 
dream 
to 
put 
me 
in 
the 
wrong. 
One 
may 
justly 
expect 
that 
the 
patient 
applies 
his 
stuttering 
for 
the 
same 
purpose 
against 
me 
and 
will 
continue 
thus 
to 
use 
it. 
In 
spite 
of 
many 
contradictions 
he 
forced 
me 
into 
the 
role 
of 
a 
former 
teacher 
whom 
he 
often 
corrected, 
so 
that 
he 
could 
continue 
to 
use 
against 
me 
his 
former 
artifices. 
(*An 
artifice 
which 
had 
for 
its 
purpose 
a 
tendencious, 
derogatory, 
affective 
expression.) 


This 
was 
revealed 
by 
his 
remarks 
concerning 
his 
dreams 
and 
further 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
his 
disease 
was 
assumed 
and 
adhered 
to 
in 
order 
to 
decry 
his 
father 
and 
gain 
superiority 
over 
him. 


A 
female 
patient 
who 
was 
assigned 
to 
me 
for 
treatment 
because 
of 
depression, 
suicidal 
ideas, 
weeping 
fits 
and 
"lesbischen 
Neigungen 
" 
was 
sent 
by 
me 
after 
a 
brief 
course 
of 
treatment, 
because 
of 
the 
suspicion 
of 
a 
genital 
affection, 
to 
a 
gynecologist 
who 
removed 
a 
large 
myoma 
and 
prognosticated 
a 
cure 
of 
the 
neurosis 
from 
the 
operation. 
After 
the 
operation 
the 
patient 
journeyed 
to 
her 
home 
and 
from 
there 
wrote 
me 
that 
the 
gynecologist 
was 
right 
in 
his 
prognosis. 
Of 
course 
she 
added 
it 
was 
to 
be 
expected 
that 
the 
operation 
succeeded 
better 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
countess 
upon 
whom 
the 
same 



surgeon 
had 
operated, 
and 
of 
whom 
she 
had 
read 
in 
the 
papers, 
than 
it 
had 
in 
her 
case. 
Soon 
afterwards 
she 
visited 
me, 
argued 
against 
one 
of 
my 
contributions 
which 
she 
had 
in 
some 
way 
procured, 
declared 
her 
extreme 
interest 
in 
my 
method 
of 
treatment, 
said 
her 
condition 
was 
the 
same 
as 
before 
the 
operation 
and 
vanished. 
From 
the 
portion 
of 
her 
history 
which 
she 
communicated 
to 
me 
during 
the 
treatment 
it 
became 
apparent 
among 
other 
things 
that 
she 
lived 
at 
sword 
's-point 
with 
her 
whole 
environment, 
that 
she 
dominated 
her 
husband 
entirely, 
that 
she 
hated 
the 
village 
and 
played 
the 
man 
psychically 
and 
sexually 
to 
one 
of 
her 
friends. 
Her 
fear 
of 
the 
blessing 
of 
children 
was 
astounding, 
-sexual 
relations 
unbearable 
because 
her 
husband 
seemed 
too 
heavy. 
When 
the 
latter 
visited 
her 
once 
during 
the 
treatment, 
she 
had 
the 
day 
before 
his 
visit 
the 
following 
dream: 


"It 
seemed 
to 
me 
that 
the 
whole 
room 
was 
enveloped 
by 
fire.” 


She 
gave 
the 
information 
spontaneously 
that 
this 
was 
a 
typical 
dream, 
and 
that 
it 
always 
returned 
at 
the 
time 
of 
her 
menstrual 
period. 
This 
time 
it 
occurred 
a 
long 
time 
before 
her 
period. 
The 
dream 
could 
be 
easily 
recognized 
as 
an 
attempt 
to 
use 
a 
feminine 
situation, 
menstruation, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest 
that 
is 
to 
avoid 
sexual 
relations. 
A 
deeper 
penetration 
into 
the 
meaning 
which 
would 
certainly 
have 
revealed 
an 
enuresis 
in 
childhood 
(fire-myoma, 
see 
" 
Studie," 
Appendix) 
was 
prevented 
by 
the 
interruption 
of 
the 
treatment. 
I 
received 
another 
letter 
which 
contained 
the 
assurance 
that 
the 
patient 
from 
now 
on 
would 
try 
to 
find 
peace 
in 
her 
environment 
in 
my 
sense 
of 
the 
word. 
I 
think 
that 
this 
must 
have 
been 
still 
difficult 
for 
her. 


Obstinacy, 
wildness 
and 
unruliness 
may 
in 
the 
same 
way 
serve 
as 
the 
proof 
which 
female 
patients 
seek 
in 
order 
to 
show 
how 
little 
they 
are 
fitted 
for 
the 
feminine 
role. 
These 
preparations 
begin 
already 
in 
the 
earliest 
childhood 
and 
lead 
gradually 
to 
physical 
and 
psychic 
aptitudes 
in 
gestures, 
facial 
expression, 
emotional 
predispositions 
and 
mimicry, 
while 
the 
character 
develops 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
ideal 
guiding 
line 
and 
cautiously 
introduces 
the 
patients' 
attitude 
of 
life. 
In 
many 
cases 
these 
characteristics 
are 
manifested 
in 
a 
direct 
manner 
and 
serve 
without 
deviation 
for 
the 
expression 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
Or 
there 
takes 
place 
a 
change 
of 
formula 
in 
the 
guiding 
fiction, 
either 
because 
of 
the 
emergence 
of 
contradictions 
in 
the 
guiding 
line, 
in 
the 
event 
of 
a 
real 
or 
threatened 
defeat, 
or 
because 
of 
something 
that 
usually 
coincides 
therewith, 
namely, 
an 
obstacle 
of 
reality 



which 
is 
estimated 
as 
unsurmountable. 
Under 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
security-
giving 
anxiety 
or 
feeling 
of 
guilt, 
or 
security-giving 
antithetical 
traits 
(dissociation 
of 
other 
writers), 
the 
deviations 
in 
neurotic 
circuitous 
ways 
follow. 
But 
the 
preparatory 
devices 
persist. 
It 
is 
only 
that 
the 
neurotic 
cautiousness 
introduces 
the 
devia 
under 
these 
new 
forms 
of 
security, 
anxiety, 
feeling 
of 
guilt, 
seizures, 
when 
the 
patient 
would 
otherwise 
have 
had 
to 
answer 
with 
the 
originally 
developed 
emotions 
such 
as, 
anger, 
rage, 
aggression. 
Frequently 
there 
come 
to 
light 
purposefully 
grouped 
memory 
pictures 
of 
a 
certain 
"boundlessness," 
thoughts, 
memories, 
illusions 
as 
though 
one 
were 
boundlessly 
desirous, 
sensuous, 
demoniac, 
criminal, 
are 
manifested, 
at 
times 
obviously 
arranged 
oversights 
and 
accidents 
which 
are 
nothing 
else 
than 
admonitions 
to 
be 
cautious. 
Or 
the 
sudden 
termination 
of 
the 
direct 
masculine 
aggressiveness 
takes 
place 
always 
just 
before 
a 
decision, 
a 
peculiarity 
which 
characterizes 
many 
neurotic 
love 
affairs. 
The 
deviation 
in 
such 
cases 
from 
the 
direct 
guiding 
line 
may 
follow 
in 
a 
perverse 
manner 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
craving 
for 
security, 
or 
the 
guiding 
line 
leads 
him 
to 
seek 
the 
protection 
of 
the 
father, 
mother, 
God, 
alcoholism 
or 
an 
idea. 
Attempts 
to 
reach 
the 
top 
through 
feminine 
means, 
or 
to 
surpass 
at 
least, 
all 
women, 
leads 
to 
excessive 
cleanliness, 
to 
the 
" 
cleaning 
mania," 
to 
a 
masochistic 
subjection 
or 
coquetry, 
to 
a 
desire 
to 
please 
and 
in 
female 
patients 
to 
a 
constant 
fretting. 
Along 
with 
this 
there 
will 
always 
be 
found 
character-traits 
and 
tell-tale 
traces 
which 
betray 
that 
the 
masculine 
fiction 
is 
all-powerful 
and 
seeks 
to 
arrive 
at 
its 
purpose 
by 
these 
circuitous 
ways. 
The 
excessive 
eroticism 
in 
many 
of 
these 
cases 
is 
not 
to 
be 
understood 
as 
real, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
as 
depending 
upon 
a 
constitutional 
basis, 
but 
shows 
itself 
to 
be 
associated 
with 
the 
fiction, 
and 
to 
be 
due 
to 
an 
uninterrupted 
attentiveness 
which 
has 
taken 
an 
erotic 
direction. 
The 
same 
is 
true 
of 
perversions 
and 
an 
apparently 
weakened 
libido, 
which 
are 
constructed 
from 
neurotic 
subterfuges. 
All 
sexual 
relations 
in 
the 
neurosis 
are 
only 
a 
simile. 


The 
fear 
of 
the 
superiority 
of 
the 
male 
and 
the 
depreciatory 
struggle 
directed 
against 
it 
is 
often 
clothed, 
as 
result 
of 
the 
neurotic 
antithetical 
perspective, 
in 
phantasies 
of 
emasculation 
which 
have 
for 
their 
object 
the 
deprivation 
of 
the 
male 
of 
worth. 
In 
the 
dreams 
of 
these 
female 
neurotic 
patients 
this 
comes 
clearly 
to 
light 
and 
can 
be 
readily 
proved 
by 
coexistent 
derogatory 
tendencies. 
One 
of 
these 
dreams 
is 
here 
given. 
The 
patient 
came 



under 
my 
care 
shortly 
after 
she 
had 
undergone 
an 
operation 
for 
a 
fistula, 
because 
of 
a 
compulsory 
thought 
and 
excitement. 
The 
compulsory 
thought 
ran, 
" 
I 
shall 
never 
be 
able 
to 
attain 
anything." 
At 
our 
very 
first 
meeting 
she 
expressed 
the 
thought 
whether 
I 
would 
be 
able 
to 
attain 
anything. 
The 
same 
line 
of 
disparagement 
illuminated 
her 
dream. 
She 
dreamed, 
"I 
cried 
out 
in 
my 
dream, 
Marie, 
the 
fistula 
is 
there 
again." 
The 
surgeon 
had 
promised 
her 
complete 
recovery 
and 
kept 
his 
word. 
He 
is 
under 
obligations 
to 
her 
in 
many 
ways 
and 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
take 
a 
fee. 
The 
patient 
became 
very 
excited 
over 
this 
and 
regarded 
it 
as 
an 
humiliation. 
For 
some 
time 
after 
she 
tortured 
herself 
with 
plans 
for 
paying 
the 
debt. 
Her 
servant 
was 
called 
Marie, 
and 
she 
had 
never 
spoken 
to 
her 
about 
the 
operation. 
If 
there 
should 
take 
place 
a 
new 
breaking 
out 
of 
the 
fistula 
her 
first 
trip 
would 
be 
to 
the 
surgeon 
to 
whom 
she 
would 
express 
her 
opinion 
Marie, 
a 
female 
servant, 
becomes 
the 
surgeon. 
The 
patient 
imagines 
the 
circumstances 
demanded 
by 
her 
masculine 
egoistic 
feeling, 
the 
surgeon 
has 
operated 
poorly, 
has 
not 
kept 
his 
promise, 
is 
a 
woman 
and 
a 
servant 
at 
the 
same 
time 
This 
expresses 
the 
way 
in 
which 
she 
could 
attain 
everything 
if 
she 
were 
only 
a 
man. 


When 
one 
examines 
the 
published 
analyses 
of 
no 
matter 
what 
psychological 
school 
the 
mechanism 
of 
the 
neurotic 
masculine 
protest 
will 
always 
be 
found 
therein. 
I 
shall 
again 
emphasize 
this 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
analysis 
of 
a 
case 
of 
migraine. 


The 
patient 
related 
immediately 
from 
the 
reminiscences 
of 
her 
childhood 
that 
she 
had 
constantly 
lived 
in 
conflict 
with 
her 
elder 
brothers 
because 
they 
wished 
to 
dominate 
her. 
This 
sort 
of 
reminiscences 
led, 
as 
soon 
as 
they 
were 
voluntarily 
related, 
to 
a 
hidden 
contest 
against 
male 
domination, 
and 
one 
will 
never 
be 
deceived 
in 
the 
assumption 
that 
other 
character-traits 
also 
point 
to 
this 
strife 
to 
become 
equal 
to 
the 
male. 
Uninfluenced, 
our 
patient 
continued 
to 
relate 
that 
she 
played 
almost 
exclusively 
with 
boys 
and 
was 
treated 
by 
them 
as 
one 
of 
their 
kind. 
This 
method 
of 
expression 
betrayed 
very 
clearly 
the 
high 
estimation 
in 
which 
the 
male 
sex 
was 
held, 
which 
brought 
this 
girl 
nearer 
to 
her 
father 
something 
which 
may 
easily 
be 
interpreted 
as 
sexual 
love 
for 
the 
father 
and 
as 
the 
" 
incest 
complex." 


The 
development 
of 
our 
patient 
took 
the 
same 
course. 
She 
took 
her 
father 
wholly 
as 
her 
ideal; 
especially 
as 
she 
once 
caught 
her 
mother 
in 
a 
lie 
she 
was 
anxious 
to 
imitate 
her 
father's 
example 
of 
truthfulness 
and 
punctuality. 



(*What 
other 
authors 
term 
imitativeness, 
identification, 
is 
always 
to 
be 
looked 
upon 
as 
the 
assumption 
of 
a 
model 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
a 
heightening 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness) 


She 
remembered 
also 
that 
her 
father 
had 
often 
regretted 
that 
she 
was 
not' 
a 
boy, 
and 
that 
it 
was 
his 
wish 
that 
she 
should 
study. 
In 
this 
situation 
an 
egoistic 
feeling 
was 
naturally 
developed 
in 
which 
ambitious 
efforts 
could 
not 
be 
absent. 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
her 
bashfulness 
which 
wrecked 
many 
of 
her 
principles 
was 
very 
noticeable 
to 
herself 
and 
others. 
This 
bashfulness 
is 
found 
with 
extraordinary 
frequency 
in 
the 
histories 
of 
neurotics. 
It 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
feeling 
of 
uncertainty, 
as 
soon 
as 
this 
is 
manifested 
in 
relations 
with 
others. 
Blushing, 
stuttering, 
downcast 
looks, 
avoidance 
of 
the 
society 
of 
adults, 
excitement 
before 
examinations 
and 
stage 
fright 
often 
accompany 
the 
attempts 
at 
approaches 
to 
other 
people 
or 
at 
the 
establishment 
of 
relations 
with 
them. 
Analysis 
shows 
that 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
is 
the 
source 
of 
this 
sort 
of 
uncertainty, 
usually 
accompanied 
by 
a 
strong 
feeling 
of 
shame. 
The 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
is 
conditioned 
by 
somatic 
inferiority 
which 
makes 
itself 
felt 
psychically, 
by 
faults 
of 
childhood 
and 
strong 
psychic 
pressure 
on 
the 
part 
of 
parents 
and 
relatives, 
and 
finally 
by 
real 
or 
imagined 
femininity 
which 
develops 
early 
in 
strong 
contrast 
to 
a 
male 
member 
of 
the 
family 
(father 
01 
brother). 
The 
analogy 
according 
to 
which 
the 
most 
diverse 
emotions 
of 
being 
belittled, 
of 
humiliation, 
of 
inferiority 
are 
apperceived 
by 
the 
child 
is 
then 
usually 
the 
analogy 
of 
" 
the 
smallness 
of 
the 
penis," 
which 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
symbolically, 
and 
thoughts 
of 
castration 
develop, 
of 
a 
feminine 
role 
in 
sexual 
relations, 
of 
conception 
and 
pregnancy 
or 
of 
persecution, 
of 
being 
stabbed 
or 
wounded, 
of 
falling 
and 
being 
" 
beneath." 
All 
these 
fictions 
are 
revealed 
in 
day-dreams, 
hallucinations, 
dreams, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
are 
not 
wholly 
supplanted 
by 
the 
fiction 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest 
and 
express 
a 
feeling 
of 
being 
belittled, 
which 
breaks 
forth 
in 
the 
thought, 
" 
I 
am 
a 
woman," 
against 
which 
the 
egoistic 
feeling 
presses 
forward 
and 
the 
masculine 
protest 
struggles. 


Of 
our 
patient 
we 
hear 
that 
she 
had 
some 
knowledge 
of 
sexual 
relations 
at 
a 
time 
when 
from 
lack 
of 
experience 
she 
was 
unable 
to 
take 
into 
account 
its 
results 
and 
purposes. 
In 
such 
cases 
we 
may 
always 
expect 
to 
find 
bashfulness, 
shame 
and 
doubt, 
and 
in 
later 
years 
fear 
of 
tests 
and 
decisions 
in 
every 
form, 
traits 
of 
character 
which 
resolve 
themselves 
analytically 
into 
the 



idea 
that 
others 
might 
be 
able 
to 
discover 
on 
the 
person 
of 
the 
patient 
genital 
defects 
or 
omissions. 
The 
characteristics 
which 
display 
an 
effort 
to 
attain 
equality 
with 
the 
male 
sex 
are 
usually 
manifested 
at 
an 
early 
age, 
and 
this 
effort 
occupies 
the 
foreground, 
while 
in 
many 
cases 
because 
of 
a 
tinge 
of 
hopelessness 
" 
the 
innate 
coloring 
of 
the 
decision 
" 
is 
affected. 
Because 
the 
direct 
route 
to 
masculinity 
is 
closed 
or 
seems 
to 
be 
so, 
circuitous 
and 
deviating 
ways 
are 
sought 
out. 
On 
one 
of 
these 
circuitous 
ways 
lies 
the 
socially 
valuable 
effort 
of 
woman 
toward 
emancipation, 
on 
another, 
the 
private 
expression 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
the 
neurosis 
of 
woman, 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
ideal 
male 
organ. 


It 
was 
easy 
to 
see 
in 
the 
case 
of 
this 
patient 
that 
in 
her 
childhood 
she 
had 
sought 
to 
attain 
the 
domination 
of 
man, 
of 
her 
brothers 
and 
her 
father, 
as 
she 
apparently 
had 
made 
very 
short 
work 
of 
her 
mother. 
Her 
father 
fell 
entirely 
under 
her 
authority. 
After 
a 
little 
experience 
the 
conclusion 
is 
easily 
arrived 
at 
concerning 
the 
direction 
of 
her 
neurotic 
symptoms, 
that 
her 
headache 
and 
migraine 
represent 
since 
her 
marriage 
a 
means 
for 
gaining 
the 
mastery 
over 
her 
husband. 
And 
in 
this 
mastery 
she 
sought 
a 
substitute 
for 
her 
masculine 
power 
which 
she 
believed 
she 
had 
lost. 


I 
know 
the 
objection 
which 
might 
be 
raised 
at 
this 
point. 
How 
shall 
the 
severe 
suffering 
of 
a 
neurosis, 
the 
terrible 
pain 
of 
trigeminal 
neuralgia, 
insomnia, 
unconsciousness, 
paralysis, 
migraine 
all 
be 
thrown 
into 
the 
bargain 
merely 
as 
a 
means 
to 
an 
end, 
because 
of 
the 
failure 
to 
attain 
equality 
with 
man? 
I 
have 
myself 
struggled 
against 
this 
conviction 
which 
thrust 
itself 
upon 
me. 
Is 
the 
case 
very 
much 
different 
when 
human 
beings 
endure 
all 
sorts 
of 
hardships 
for 
a 
whole 
life 
time 
in 
order 
to 
attain 
some 
other 
worthless 
bubble? 
Furthermore, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
shown, 
on 
these 
neurotic 
circuitous 
paths 
to 
masculinity 
are. 
found 
also 
crime, 
prostitution, 
the 
psychosis, 
suicide. 
This 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
mystery 
which 
shrouds 
human 
psychic 
mechanisms 
may 
be 
cited 
in 
support 
of 
my 
understanding 
of 
the 
matter. 
The 
psychic 
therapy 
of 
the 
neuroses 
is 
certainly 
based 
upon 
an 
understanding 
of 
the 
exaggerated 
valuation 
of 
the 
male 
destiny. 
And 
I 
draw 
from 
this 
objection 
the 
advantage 
in 
regard 
to 
my 
patients 
inasmuch 
as 
I 
endeavor 
to 
show 
them 
how 
they, 
placed 
before 
a 
choice 
between 
a 
natural 
role 
in 
the 
neurotic 
masculine 
goal, 
choose 
the 
greater 
of 
the 
two 
evils. 


From 
the 
previous 
history 
of 
our 
patient 
the 
further 
facts 
may 
be 



emphasized 
that 
she 
always 
had 
a 
disinclination 
to 
play 
with 
dolls, 
furthermore 
that 
until 
her 
marriage 
she 
took 
the 
greatest 
pleasure 
in 
gymnastics 
and 
sports. 
That 
these 
efforts, 
too, 
served 
as 
a 
substitute 
for 
masculinity 
is 
manifested 
more 
from 
their 
connection 
with 
other 
masculine 
traits 
than 
from 
their 
own 
nature, 
more 
especially 
from 
a 
sort 
of 
importunity 
with 
which 
the 
patient 
spoke 
of 
them. 
She 
was 
also 
passionately 
fond 
of 
extensive 
touring, 
of 
which 
inclination 
since 
the 
birth 
of 
her 
child, 
whom 
she 
wished 
and 
expected 
to 
be 
male, 
only 
the 
desire 
to 
make 
occasional 
journeys 
remained. 


The 
error 
must 
be 
avoided, 
however, 
of 
assuming 
that 
the 
traits 
of 
character 
here 
described 
and 
emphasized 
by 
the 
patient 
herself 
formed 
isolated 
islands 
in 
the 
extensive 
soul-life 
of 
a 
woman. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
it 
must 
be 
assumed 
that 
these 
masculine 
traits 
came 
to 
expression 
under 
the 
pressure 
of 
a 
dominating 
tendency, 
had 
their 
origin 
in 
a 
distinct 
life-plan 
and 
became 
conspicuous 
phenomena 
only 
because 
they 
had 
the 
power 
to 
do 
so, 
while 
all 
around 
these 
phenomena 
there 
existed 
an 
indistinct, 
only 
occasionally 
manifested 
masculine 
craving 
which 
was 
principally 
occupied 
with 
the 
prevention 
and 
transformation 
of 
feminine 
emotions 
until 
such 
time 
as 
it 
shall 
have 
reached 
an 
independent 
existence. 
In 
this 
conflict 
of 
masculine 
against 
feminine 
emotions 
the 
egoistic 
feeling 
is 
thrown 
entirely 
on 
the 
side 
of 
masculinity 
and 
makes 
use 
even 
of 
persistently 
emerging 
feminine 
emotions, 
among 
others 
also 
of 
the 
female 
sexual 
appetite 
in 
order 
to 
collect 
them 
as 
humiliating 
and 
dangerous,* 
to 
group 
them, 
to 
exaggerate, 
to 
emphasize 
them 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
to 
surround 
them 
with 
sentinels 
so 
that 
they 
may 
be 
robbed 
of 
their 
influence. 
These 
sentinels, 
securities, 
usually 
extend 
beyond 
the 
sphere 
of 
feminine 
emotions. 


*This 
affective 
accentuation 
is 
always 
derived 
from 
a 
purposeful 
device. 
Feminine 
role 
and 
abyss, 
drowning, 
death, 
being 
run 
over, 
or 
strangled. 


One 
always 
finds 
that 
these 
reassurances 
and 
protective 
devices, 
among 
which 
should 
be 
placed 
our 
symptoms 
of 
disease, 
do 
not 
stop 
at 
the 
mere 
fulfillment 
of 
their 
destiny, 
that 
is, 
the 
avoidance 
of 
defeat, 
but 
that 
they 
permeate 
these 
patients 
with 
a 
sort 
of 
cautiousness 
which 
finally 
renders 
them 
unfit 
for 
anything. 
It 
is 
only 
then 
that 
the 
primary 
insecurity 
which 
may 
be 
likened 
to 
a 
fear 
of 
a 
feminine 
role 
is 
at 
an 
end, 
but 
by 
this 
time 
it 
has 



permeated 
the 
entire 
life-relation 
of 
the 
individual 
and 
forces 
him 
outside 
the 
realm 
of 
all 
social 
relationship. 
We 
find 
all 
our 
patients 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
this 
retreat 
and 
their 
symptoms 
are 
for 
them 
assurances 
that 
they 
will 
not 
be 
forced 
back 
into 
the 
tumult 
of 
life. 
From 
this 
there 
develops 
a 
neurotic 
picture 
which 
often 
reveals 
a 
reversion 
to 
simpler, 
more 
child-like 
relations, 
either 
because 
these 
are 
developed 
after 
maturity, 
or 
for 
the 
reason 
that 
maturity 
was 
generally 
impeded. 
Thus 
many 
act 
as 
though 
they 
were 
in 
the 
nursery. 
Family 
relations 
become 
accentuated 
to 
an 
extraordinary 
degree, 
or 
instead 
of 
childish 
love 
for 
the 
parents 
the 
old 
childish 
obstinacy 
develops 
and 
both 
factors 
are 
used 
as 
guiding 
symbols, 
as 
though 
the 
patient 
sought 
to 
discover 
in 
.all 
persons 
the 
father 
or 
mother. 
Notwithstanding 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
comes 
in 
conflict 
with 
reality 
on 
account 
of 
this 
fiction, 
the 
patient 
holds 
fast 
to 
it 
because 
he 
found 
security 
in 
the 
relations 
existing 
in 
the 
nursery. 
Kipling 
relates 
of 
a 
person 
lying 
in 
the 
death 
struggle, 
whom 
he 
observed 
until 
the 
expected 
cry 
for 
the 
mother 
came 
from 
his 
lips. 
One 
has 
only 
to 
listen 
to 
the 
street-Arabs, 
who, 
when 
hard 
pressed, 
immediately 
cry 
out 
for 
their 
mother, 
in 
order 
to 
comprehend 
this 
longing 
for 
security. 
The 
same 
longing 
for 
security 
has 
crept 
into 
the 
worshipping 
of 
the 
Mother 
of 
God. 
In 
girls, 
the 
longing 
for 
security 
is 
as 
a 
rule 
in 
more 
pronounced 
analogy 
to 
the 
relation 
to 
the 
father. 
The 
" 
uterine 
phantasy 
" 
which 
is 
placed 
in 
the 
foreground 
by 
G. 
Gruner 
I 
have 
also 
found 
employed 
by 
neurotics 
only 
when 
they 
wish 
to 
express 
that 
peace 
can 
be 
found 
only 
with 
the 
mother 
or 
when 
they 
have 
thoughts 
of 
suicide, 
that 
is, 
the 
wish 
to 
return 
io 
the 
same 
state 
in 
which 
they 
were 
before 
birth. 
(The 
hermaphroditic 
progression 
backward.) 


Our 
patient, 
too, 
as 
child 
and 
girl 
sought 
this 
leaning 
on 
her 
father 
who 
spoiled 
her 
not 
a 
little. 
The 
mother, 
as 
is 
often 
the 
case, 
was 
more 
attracted 
to 
her 
brothers. 
This 
trait 
also 
shows 
itself 
to 
be 
conditioned 
by 
the 
exaggerated 
estimation 
of 
the 
masculine 
principle, 
which 
the 
father, 
being 
a 
man, 
would 
more 
readily 
renounce 
in 
her 
favor. 
Our 
patient 
soon 
noticed 
that 
her 
father's 
care 
for 
her 
increased 
whenever 
she 
was 
ill. 
Thus 
she 
came 
to 
have 
a 
special 
preference 
for 
being 
sick, 
which 
procured 
for 
her 
further 
petting, 
love, 
and 
sweetmeats. 
She 
must 
have 
regarded 
as 
the 
most 
appropriate 
substitute 
for 
that 
manliness 
-which 
she 
believed 
to 
be 
lost 
to 
her, 
that 
condition 
of 
sickness 
which 
gained 
for 
her 
the 
command 
of 
the 
whole 
house, 
the 
gratification 
of 
all 
her 
wishes 
and 
permitted 
her 
to 
escape 
all 
unpleasant 
encounters 
in 
school 



and 
society. 
Yes, 
it 
meant 
for 
her 
the 
highest 
attainable 
potency, 
her 
feeling 
of 
security, 
as 
soon 
as 
her 
father 
believed 
that 
she 
was 
ill. 
And 
she 
sometimes 
pretended 
to 
be 
ill, 
that 
is, 
she 
simulated 
or 
exaggerated. 


This 
fact 
of 
simulation 
in 
childhood 
is 
often 
found 
in 
the 
anamneses 
of 
neurotics. 
I 
have 
called 
attention 
to 
this 
phenomenon 
in 
the 
" 
Psychischen 
Behandlung 
der 
Trigeminus 
Neuralgic," 
and 
have 
mentioned 
that 
children 
often 
pretend 
to 
be 
deaf, 
blind, 
dumb, 
etc. 
E. 
Jones 
mentions 
this 
fact 
in 
his 
" 
Hamletstudie," 
and 
calls 
attention 
to 
the 
resemblance 
of 
Hamlet's 
pretense 
to 
that 
of 
children. 
There 
are 
many 
historical 
examples 
such 
as 
Saul, 
Claudius 
and 
others, 
and 
they 
show 
us 
the 
problem 
in 
its 
pure 
culture. 
The 
accompanying 
thought 
is 
always 
how 
can 
I 
secure 
myself 
from 
a 
danger, 
how 
can 
I 
avoid 
a 
defeat? 
It 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
neurotic 
who 
apperceives 
according 
to 
the 
analogy 
man-woman 
perceives 
in 
the 
domination 
of 
a 
position 
a 
masculine 
equivalent, 
a 
substitute 
and 
protection 
for 
the 
threatened 
loss 
of 
manliness. 
And 
the 
technique 
of 
simulation 
consists 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
individual 
sets 
forth 
a 
fiction 
and 
acts 
in 
accordance 
therewith 
as 
though 
he 
had 
the 
defect 
which 
would 
require 
such 
action, 
while 
he 
knows 
and 
maintains 
that 
he 
has 
no 
such 
defect. 
We 
maintain 
that 
the 
psychically 
conditioned 
neurotic 
symptom 
arises 
in 
the 
same 
way 
only 
with 
this 
difference 
that-the 
fiction 
is 
not 
recognized 
as 
a 
fiction, 
but 
is 
held 
as 
true.* 
3 
See 
theoretical 
part, 
Chapter 
III., 
"The 
accentuated 
fiction." 


As 
is 
frequently 
the 
case, 
we 
can 
obtain 
the 
best 
insight 
into 
this 
condition 
not 
from 
a 
neurotic 
symptom, 
but 
from 
a 
borderline 
case. 
We 
mean 
the 
psychology 
of 
sympathy. 
We 
are 
in 
a 
position 
to 
feel 
the 
suffering 
of 
another 
person 
as 
if 
it 
affected 
our 
own 
corporal 
sphere. 
Yes, 
we 
can 
even 
feel 
the 
suffering 
of 
another 
in 
anticipation 
before 
its 
occurrence. 
Well 
known 
examples 
of 
this 
are 
the 
anxious 
feelings 
which 
many 
persons 
experience 
when 
they 
see 
others, 
servant 
girls, 
roof 
workers 
or 
circus 
actors 
in 
dangerous 
situations, 
or 
even 
when 
they 
only 
think 
of 
such 
situations. 
These 
symptoms 
are 
usually 
felt 
by, 
those 
who 
suffer 
from 
dizziness 
when 
in 
high 
places 
and 
they 
act 
when 
others 
are 
in 
danger 
exactly 
as 
though 
they 
themselves 
stood 
at 
a 
window 
or 
on 
a 
rock. 
They 
withdraw 
under 
the 
feeling 
of 
anxiety, 
placing 
a 
safe 
distance 
between 
themselves 
and 
the 
usually 
not 
dangerous 
position, 
in 
short, 
they 
have 
a 
feeling 
akin 
to 
that 
which 
they 
would 
have 
were 
they 
themselves 
in 
a 
dangerous 
position. 
Here 
the 
exaggerated 
cautiousness 



becomes 
apparent 
which 
in 
neurotics 
is 
so 
strong 
that 
they 
will 
not 
cross 
a 
bridge 
for 
fear 
that 
they 
might 
fall 
into 
the 
water 
or 
throw 
themselves 
into 
it. 
I 
have 
found 
similar 
mechanisms 
of 
cautiousness 
in 
all 
cases 
of 
fear 
of 
places 
and 
they 
reveal 
to 
us 
that 
we 
have 
a 
patient 
who 
wishes 
to 
avoid 
decisions, 
who 
fears 
whether 
he 
is 
equal 
to 
a 
certain 
situation, 
usually 
the 
sexual 
partner. 
In 
all 
other 
phobias, 
too, 
as 
I 
have 
shown 
in 
my 
description 
of 
syphilidophobia, 
(Zeitschr. 
f. 
Psych., 
Bd. 
I, 
Heft 
9, 
1911), 
this 
"sympathy" 
in 
a 
situation 
which 
has 
not 
as 
yet 
been 
realized, 
but 
which 
may 
be 
expected 
with 
probability, 
constitutes 
the 
characteristic 
symptom 
(Lipps). 
It 
reveals 
itself 
as 
a 
very 
efficient 
tool 
of 
the 
craving 
for 
security, 
takes 
the 
place 
in 
many 
cases 
of 
a 
morality 
which 
is 
not 
invincible 
in 
character. 
Careful 
examination 
of 
this 
character-trait 
reveals 
that 
it 
has 
its 
foundation 
in 
that 
sort 
of 
feeling-participation 
for 
purposes 
of 
security, 
which 
is 
clearly 
set 
forth 
in 
Kant's 
categorical 
imperatives 
for 
the 
expression 
of 
the 
whole 
character, 
when 
this 
philosopher 
wishes 
each 
single 
individual 
to 
be 
influenced 
in 
his 
action 
by 
a 
point 
of 
view 
which 
permits 
of 
being 
regarded 
as 
if 
it 
were 
elevated 
to 
a 
universal 
maxim. 
(*Vaihinger, 
" 
The 
Philosophy 
of 
As 
If.") 


Fictions, 
maxims, 
guiding 
principles 
then 
similar 
to 
the 
reassuring 
fictions 
of 
the 
simulator 
form 
part 
of 
the 
mental 
character 
of 
all 
persons, 
especially 
of 
neurotically 
inclined 
children. 
And 
reduced 
to 
their 
nucleus 
all 
of 
these 
formulae 
are 
as 
follows: 
Act 
as 
though 
you 
were 
a 
complete 
man, 
or 
wished 
to 
be 
one. 
The 
content 
of 
this 
procedure 
which 
usually 
turns 
out 
to 
be 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
substitute 
is 
determined 
beforehand 
by 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
child 
and 
by 
the 
special 
type 
of 
somatic 
inferiority 
from 
which 
he 
suffers, 
but 
is 
subject 
to 
special 
alterations 
which 
must 
be 
regarded 
as 
formal 
changes 
arising 
from 
special 
circumstances 
connected 
with 
experiences 
to 
which 
"he 
gives 
neurotic 
valuations. 


Somatic 
inferiority 
determines 
through 
the 
accompanying 
psychic 
phenomena 
of 
repugnance 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
ideas 
of 
pleasure 
and 
thus 
conducts 
the 
compensatory 
processes 
into 
the 
psychic 
regions. 
Here, 
too, 
we 
behold 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
at 
work 
and 
usually 
in 
such 
a 
purposeful 
manner 
that 
it 
works 
coefficients 
which 
offer 
security 
and 
thus 
gives 
rise 
to 
an 
overcompensation. 
(*J. 
Reich, 
" 
Art 
and 
the 
Eye," 
5st, 
Rundschau, 
1909.) 


In 
the 
development, 
for 
instance 
of 
the 
stuttering 
Demosthenes 
to 
the 
greatest 
orator 
of 
Greece, 
of 
Clara 
Schumann 
(who 
was 
deaf) 
to 
an 



accomplished 
musician, 
of 
the 
near-sighted 
G. 
Freitag, 
of 
many 
poets 
and 
painters 
with 
anomalies 
of 
the 
eye 
to 
visually 
talented 
persons, 
and 
of 
the 
numerous 
physicians 
with 
anomalies 
of 
hearing, 
we 
perceive 
the 
result 
of 
the 
craving 
for 
security. 
We 
likewise 
see 
the 
result 
in 
every 
weak 
child 
who 
wishes 
to 
be 
a 
hero, 
in 
the 
clumsy 
child 
with 
thyroid 
affection 
who 
wishes 
to 
be 
an 
athletic 
racer 
and 
later 
in 
life 
always 
tries 
to 
be 
the 
first. 


But 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
in 
order 
to 
have 
its 
objective 
point 
must 
depend 
upon 
an 
example. 
And 
here 
the 
man 
offers 
more 
attraction 
to 
the 
egoistic 
feeling 
of 
childhood 
than 
does 
the 
woman. 
Indeed 
it 
seems 
that 
a 
female 
example 
can 
only 
be 
imitated 
after 
an 
initiatory 
conflict 
and 
only 
when 
this 
feminine 
example 
permits 
the 
attainment 
of 
mastery 
along 
the 
lines 
of 
least 
resistance. 


This 
was 
the 
case 
with 
our 
patient 
as 
it 
often 
is 
with 
cases 
of 
migraine. 
Numerous 
writers 
have 
emphasized 
the 
circumstance 
that 
it 
is 
so 
often 
possible 
to 
trace 
the 
inheritance 
of 
migraine 
from 
the 
mother. 
We 
must 
give 
up 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
inheritance 
of 
migraine 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
we 
were 
obliged 
to 
abandon 
the 
view 
of 
its 
organic 
etiology. 
I 
have 
already 
explained 
the 
nature 
of 
this 
question 
8 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
seven-f 
year-old 
girl, 
and 
had 
before 
that 
been 
convinced 
that 
a 
feeling 
of 
uncertainty 
and 
humiliation 
precedes 
the 
attack 
of 
migraine, 
and 
that 
the 
attacks 
serve 
to 
place 
the 
whole 
household 
at 
the 
service 
of 
the 
sufferer, 
for 
which 
reason 
the 
example 
of 
the 
mother 
is 
imitated. 
The 
husband, 
the 
father, 
other 
relatives 
suffer 
no 
less 
from 
the 
attack 
than 
does 
the 
patient. 
Thus 
migraine 
is 
to 
be 
placed 
in 
the 
series 
of 
neurotic 
affections 
which 
serve 
to 
secure 
the 
mastery 
in 
the 
household 
and 
in 
the 
family. 
That 
this 
tyranny 
has 
a 
masculine 
significance 
and 
can 
be 
reduced 
to 
the 
wish 
to 
be 
a 
man 
becomes 
obvious 
from 
further 
analysis. 
But 
a 
brief 
consideration 
of 
the 
migraine 
which 
occurs 
at 
the 
time 
of 
menstruation 
teaches 
us 
to 
understand 
in 
this 
case 
also 
the 
dissatisfaction 
with 
the 
feminine 
role. 
I 
have 
in 
various 
instances 
learned 
to 
recognize 
this 
connection 
with 
epilepsy, 
sciatica, 
trigeminal 
neuralgia. 
I 
have 
proved 
that 
these 
latter 
conclusion 
in 
the 
cases 
mentioned 
by 
me 
were 
psychogenic 
in 
nature 
and 
originated 
whenever 
stronger 
securities 
were 
demanded. 


The 
only 
sphere 
of 
influence 
which 
remained 
for 
our 
patient 
was 
her, 
tyranny 
over 
her 
father, 
over 
whom 
she 
had 
complete 
power, 
and 
this 
did 
not 
entirely 
satisfy 
her 
lust 
for 
power. 
Hence, 
a 
"still, 
still 
more" 
declared 
itself, 



as 
is 
often 
the 
casein 
neurotic 
affections, 
and 
she 
sought 
a 
more 
obvious 
grasp 
of 
the 
subjugation 
of 
the 
father. 
Her 
mother 
suffered 
from 
migraine 
and 
the 
time 
of 
her 
attacks 
was, 
as 
is 
usual 
with 
patients 
suffering 
from 
migraine, 
a 
time 
of 
absolute 
power. 
Therefore 
our 
patient 
also 
who 
comprehended 
the 
value 
of 
the 
disease 
pretended 
to 
be 
suffering 
from 
it."* 


*In 
my 
work 
on 
" 
The 
Neurotic 
Disposition," 
I 
have 
already 
emphasized 
what 
must 
likewise 
be 
mentioned 
here, 
that 
an 
original 
somatic 
inferiority 
determines 
the 
choice 
of 
a 
symptom. 
In 
the 
neurosis 
the 
mechanism 
becomes 
the 
property 
of 
the 
psyche 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
disease-preparedness. 


And 
our 
patient 
succeeded 
in 
doing 
what 
aboriginal 
man 
succeeded 
in 
doing 
when 
he 
made 
himself 
gods 
who 
filled 
him 
with 
terror, 
in 
creating 
for 
herself 
the 
migraine. 
This 
" 
as 
if 
" 
creation, 
this 
fiction 
became 
substantially 
independent, 
so 
that 
the 
pain 
and 
suffering 
could 
awaken 
whenever 
the 
patient 
needed 
them. 
The 
dramatic 
performance 
became 
so 
successful 
that 
the 
patient, 
because 
of 
its 
value 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
her 
tendencies, 
no 
longer 
saw 
through 
the 
fiction. 
Indeed 
she 
won 
by 
means 
of 
the 
same 
a 
superiority 
over 
and 
security 
against 
the 
husband 
just 
as 
she 
had 
previously 
done 
in 
regard 
to 
her 
father 
when 
she 
made 
use 
of 
this 
weapon 
to 
attain 
security. 
She 
strove 
to 
attain 
a 
masculine 
part 
in 
the 
marriage 
relation, 
directing 
all 
her 
activities 
towards 
gaining 
the 
mastery 
over 
her 
husband, 
but 
as 
there 
always 
remained 
an 
"and 
yet" 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
obtain 
still 
further 
substitutes 
as 
evidences 
of 
power. 
And 
the 
most 
important 
of 
these 
substitute 
formations 
was 
the 
resolution 
not 
to 
have 
any 
more 
children. 
It 
had 
become 
a 
general 
principle 
in 
the 
household 
of 
this 
patient 
as 
in 
many 
others 
(one 
of 
which 
I 
described 
in 
the 
Mannliche 
Einstellung 
Weiblicher 
Neurotiker," 
Zeitsch., 
f. 
Psychoanalyse, 
Heft 
4, 
1910) 
that 
a 
woman 
who 
suffered 
from 
such 
headaches 
should 
have 
no 
more 
children. 
Insomnia, 
impossibility 
of 
going 
to 
sleep 
again 
after 
having 
been 
disturbed, 
references 
to 
the 
difficulties 
concerning 
the 
place 
of 
residence, 
various 
protective 
arrangements 
and 
the 
spoiling 
of 
the 
only 
child 
completed 
the 
security. 


That 
these 
phenomena 
are 
merely 
a 
new 
view 
of 
the 
old 
wish 
for 
masculinity 
is 
proved 
by 
her 
first 
dream. 


"I 
was 
at 
the 
depot 
with 
my 
mother. 
We 
wished 
to 
-visit 
my 
father 
who 
was 
ill. 
I 
was 
afraid 
of 
missing 
the 
train. 
Then 
suddenly 
my 
father 
appeared. 



Then 
I 
was 
at 
a 
watch 
maker's 
and 
wanted 
to 
buy 
a 
substitute 
for 
the 
one 
I 
had 
lost." 


She 
felt 
superior 
to 
her 
mother 
who 
was 
greatly 
respected 
by 
her, 
and 
also 
to 
her 
father 
who 
humored 
her 
slightest 
wish. 
Sick 
means 
weak. 
The 
father 
had 
died 
a 
short 
time 
previously. 
Shortly 
after 
his 
death 
she 
had 
one 
of 
her 
dreadful 
attacks 
of 
migraine. 
In 
the 
dream 
he 
came 
to 
life 
again 
and 
his 
person 
signified 
for 
her 
a 
maximating 
of 
her 
ego-consciousness. 
She 
had 
always 
been 
impatient, 
afraid 
of 
being 
late. 
Her 
brother 
came 
before 
she 
did 
and 
became 
a 
man. 
She 
felt 
spurred 
on 
to 
hasten 
(a 
man 
does 
it 
with 
one 
bound, 
a 
woman 
with 
a 
hundred), 
in 
order 
to 
arrive 
at 
the 
summit 
of 
her 
ego-
consciousness. 
The 
day 
before 
the 
dream 
she 
was 
hastening 
to 
a 
concert 
and 
was 
held 
back 
by 
her 
mother. 
Women 
are 
often 
late 
and 
she 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
follow 
their 
example. 


Reality 
reminded 
her 
nevertheless 
that 
she 
was 
a 
woman 
like 
her 
mother. 
The 
thought 
lies 
in 
the 
picture 
of 
being 
together 
with 
her 
mother 
at 
the 
depot. 
Her 
aggressive 
affect 
which 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
masculine 
protest 
is 
directed 
against 
her 
husband, 
against 
her 
father. 
In 
the 
further 
analysis 
of 
the 
dream 
the 
disparaging 
thoughts 
come 
to 
light, 
such 
as 
that 
.the 
wife 
is 
stronger, 
more 
vigorous 
and 
healthier 
than 
the 
man. 
Then 
as 
a 
further 
incentive 
to 
conflict, 
the 
father 
(the 
man) 
suddenly 
emerges. 
This 
simile 
is 
taken 
from 
swimming 
and 
signifies 
in 
the 
neurotic 
perspective 
the 
" 
being 
above 
" 
in 
opposition 
to 
being 
" 
beneath." 
While 
the 
patient 
was 
afraid 
of 
missing 
the 
train, 
of 
being 
left 
behind 
in 
comparison 
with 
another, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
in 
comparison 
with 
the 
man, 
which 
can 
be 
supplied 
from 
the 
connection 
to 
submit 
to 
him, 
she 
notices 
as 
her 
experience 
increases 
that 
the 
man 
is 
first, 
is 
above. 
The 
application 
of 
a 
picture, 
of 
an 
abstract 
idea 
in 
space 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
illustrating 
the 
feeling 
of 
being 
belittled 
is 
often 
found 
in 
the 
neurosis, 
(See 
Syphilidophobia, 
1. 
c.) 
because 
it 
is 
adapted 
to 
prepare 
the 
disposition 
to 
conflict 
in 
the 
most 
extensive 
manner 
by 
means 
of 
the 
fictitious, 
abstract 
antithesis 
" 
nothing 
or 
all." 
In 
the 
same 
manner 
the 
artifice 
is 
made 
use 
of 
in 
painting, 
of 
representing 
the 
power 
of 
woman 
and 
the 
fear 
she 
inspires 
by 
giving 
her 
a 
higher 
position 
in 
space. 
In 
religious 
and 
cosmological 
phantasies 
this 
representation 
of 
superiority 
is 
the 
elevation 
of 
the 
position 
assigned. 
That 
in 
her 
dream 
the 
patient 
came 
through 
the 
spatially 
antithetical 
scheme 
according 
to 
the 
analogy 
of 
" 
man-woman," 
is 



indicated 
in 
the 
position 
of 
the 
patient 
beside 
her 
mother, 
that 
is, 
with 
her 
mother. 


Thus 
the 
first 
dream 
which 
the 
patient 
had 
during 
the 
course 
of 
the 
treatment 
begins 
with 
considerations 
of 
masculine 
and 
feminine 
roles. 
One 
should 
never 
neglect 
to 
take 
into 
consideration 
unprejudicially 
the 
possibility 
of 
the 
continuation 
of 
the 
dream 
and 
to 
await 
and 
compare 
new 
confirmatory 
data, 
even 
though 
the 
psycho-therapeutist 
may 
have 
the 
most 
firm 
convictions 
concerning 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
problem 
for 
the 
neurosis. 
The 
further 
explanation 
of 
the 
patient 
was 
in 
regard 
to 
a 
watch 
chain 
which 
had 
been 
lost 
through 
the 
fault 
of 
her 
husband. 
She 
cannot 
remember 
having 
lost 
a 
watch. 
Interrogated 
concerning 
the 
significance 
in 
the 
dream 
of 
the 
watch 
which 
was 
substituted 
for 
the 
chain, 
the 
patient 
answered 
with 
considerable 
affect 
but 
evasively, 
that 
it 
was 
not 
the 
loss 
of 
the 
chain 
but 
of 
a 
charm 
attached 
to 
it 
that 
disturbed 
her. 
In 
short 
the 
watch 
hanging 
to 
a 
lady's 
chain 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
lost 
watch 
charm 
for 
which 
the 
patient 
grieves 
and 
for 
which 
she 
seeks 
a 
substitute. 


The 
dream 
began 
with 
a 
symbolic 
contrast 
represented 
in 
space 
of 
an 
inferior 
femininity 
with 
a 
superior 
masculinity 
and 
ends 
with 
the 
logically 
following 
conclusion 
of 
the 
striving 
for 
a 
substitute 
for 
the 
lost 
masculinity. 
In 
this 
fictitious 
guiding 
line 
thus 
constructed 
the 
character, 
the 
affect 
reaction, 
the 
predispositions 
and 
neurotic 
symptoms 
must 
be 
represented, 
the 
correctness 
of 
which 
assumption 
the 
result 
of 
the 
case 
substantiated. 
The 
character-traits 
of 
impatience, 
discontent, 
obstinacy 
and 
reticence 
proved 
therefore 
to 
be, 
as 
did 
all 
the 
rest, 
auxiliary 
lines 
which 
stood 
in 
a 
dependent 
relation 
to 
the 
guiding 
fiction, 
that 
of 
attaining 
a 
masculine 
elevation. 



CHAPTER 
V 
CRUELTY. 
CONSCIENCE. 
PERVERSION 
AND 
NEUROSIS 


THE 
discovery 
of 
traits 
of 
a 
cruel 
nature 
in 
very 
earliest 
childhood 
is 
unusually 
frequent 
in 
the 
course 
of 
an 
analysis 
of 
neuroses 
and 
psychoses. 
It 
would 
be 
wrong 
to 
apply 
our 
moral 
standards 
to 
the 
first 
two 
years 
of 
life, 
and 
to 
regard 
the 
activities 
of 
such 
children, 
who 
in 
reality 
are 
still 
incapable 
of 
either 
good 
or 
evil, 
as 
sadistic 
or 
brutal 
as 
it 
often 
happens 
when 
parents 
or 
guardians 
relate 
the 
histories 
of 
psychopaths. 
For 
these 
manifestations 
become 
psychic, 
or 
in 
our 
sense 
neurotic 
only 
when 
they 
begin 
to 
serve 
a 
definite 
end 
and 
are 
constructed 
as 
an 
abstraction 
which 
has 
some 
future 
tendency 
in 
view. 
(*See 
also 
Wagner 
v. 
Janreg. 
" 
Ueber 
krankhaftc 
Triebhandlungen," 
Wiener 
klin. 
Wochenschrift, 
1912.) 


The 
fact 
that 
they 
are 
always 
created 
out 
of 
possibilities 
and 
capabilities 
of 
experience 
does 
not 
justify 
the 
assumption 
of 
a 
constitutional 
factor. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact 
one 
only 
finds 
the 
character-trait 
of 
cruelty 
as 
a 
compensatory 
psychic 
construction 
in 
those 
children 
who, 
apart 
from 
this, 
are 
forced 
by 
their 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
to 
an 
early 
and 
hasty 
development 
of 
their 
ideal 
of 
personality. 
The 
accompanying 
traits 
of 
obstinacy, 
rage, 
sexual 
precocity, 
ambition, 
envy, 
greed, 
malice 
and 
delight 
in 
doing 
harm 
as 
they 
are 
regularly 
evoked 
by 
the 
guiding 
fiction, 
and 
which 
the 
strife 
and 
emotional 
predispositions 
help 
to 
form 
and 
mobilize, 
furnish 
the 
highly 
colored 
kaleidoscopic 
picture 
of 
the 
refractory 
child. 
The 
lust 
for 
power 
of 
such 
children 
is 
regularly 
manifested 
in 
the 
family 
life 
and 
play, 
but 
most 
of 
all 
in 
their 
bearing, 
attitude 
and 
glance. 
In 
the 
play 
and 
early 
thoughts 
concerning 
the 
choice 
of 
a 
vocation, 
the 
tendency 
to 
cruelty 
is 
often 
betrayed 
in 
a 
veiled 
manner 
and 
makes 
them 
regard 
as 
ideal 
types, 
the 
hangman, 
the 
butcher, 
the 
policeman, 
the 
grave 
digger, 
the 
savage 
or 
coachman, 
"because 
they 
can 
whip 
the 
horses," 
or 
the 
teacher, 
"because 
they 
can 
whip 
the 
children," 
the 
physician 
"because 
they 
cut," 
or 
the 
soldier, 
"because 
they 
shoot," 
the 
judge, 
etc. 
(* 
Adler, 
" 
Aggreasionstneb," 
1. 
c.) 


The 
spirit 
of 
investigation 
is 
also 
often 
associated 
with 
this, 
and 
the 
torturing 
of 
animals 
and 
children, 
speculations 
and 
phantasies 
concerning 



possible 
misfortunes, 
often 
of 
those 
which 
might 
befall 
near 
relatives, 
an 
interest 
in 
funerals 
and 
church-yards 
and 
in 
horrible 
sadistic 
stories, 
are 
begun. 


The 
first 
purpose 
of 
these 
exaggerated 
tendencies 
to 
cruelty, 
is 
to 
prevent 
the 
emergence 
and 
the 
becoming 
effective 
of 
the 
ever 
present 
possibility 
of 
weakness 
and 
pity, 
because 
these 
stand 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
masculine 
guiding 
line. 
The 
general 
spreading 
of 
this 
craving 
to 
be 
manly 
which 
is 
thought 
to 
lead 
to 
superiority 
over 
others, 
is 
nowhere 
so 
clearly 
shown 
as 
in 
the 
disinterested 
pleasure 
in 
injuries. 
In 
neurotics 
this 
may 
be 
especially 
strongly 
emphasized 
and 
may 
be 
utilized 
in 
the 
most 
unreasonable 
manner 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
exalting 
the 
egoconsciousness. 
La 
Rochefoucauld 
expresses 
this 
in 
his 
quaint 
manner 
as 
follows, 
"There 
is 
something 
in 
the 
misfortunes 
of 
our 
friends 
which 
is 
not 
quite 
displeasing." 


I 
heard 
a 
patient 
laugh 
aloud 
when 
told 
of 
the 
Messina 
earth, 
quake. 
He 
suffered 
from 
severe 
masochistic 
attacks. 
Compulsory 
laughter 
often 
possessed 
this 
patient 
when 
he 
was 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
superior 
person, 
his 
teacher 
for 
instance, 
or 
someone 
who 
had 
some 
claim 
of 
authority 
over 
him. 
One 
finds 
in 
such 
patients 
a 
strong 
inclination 
to 
dominate 
over 
or 
torment 
others, 
at 
times 
sadistic 
phantasies, 
until 
one 
discovers 
that 
the 
compulsion 
to 
laughter, 
the 
lust 
for 
power 
and 
the 
sadism 
are 
erected 
over 
the 
weak 
point 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
in 
order 
to 
compensate 
for 
it. 
Pyromania, 
the 
delight 
in 
fire-brands 
and 
the 
almost 
irresistible 
compulsion 
to 
think 
of 
fire, 
or 
to 
cry 
out 
" 
fire 
" 
in 
the 
theatre 
or 
church 
seem 
to 
be 
referable, 
according 
to 
certain 
of 
my 
findings, 
to 
defects 
of 
the 
sensitive 
bladder 
or 
to 
eyes 
oversensitive 
to 
light, 
or 
at 
any 
rate 
to 
preparations 
for 
the 
compensation 
of 
these 
defects. 
But 
this 
guiding 
line 
of 
masculine 
cruelty 
is 
threatened 
with 
great 
danger 
and 
accident 
in 
a 
society 
where 
there 
exist 
ethical 
imperatives, 
it 
can, 
therefore, 
be 
only 
followed 
in 
a 
disguised 
form. 
Usually 
one 
sees 
deviations 
and 
circuitous 
paths 
in 
following 
which 
the 
sadistic 
trait 
seems 
wholly 
or 
in 
part 
lost. 
In 
this 
way 
the 
neurotic 
succeeds 
in 
gaining 
superiority 
over 
the 
weak, 
or 
he 
operates 
on 
this 
new 
line 
so 
skillfully 
as 
to 
manage 
to 
set 
up 
an 
aggression 
which 
enables 
him 
to 
dominate 
and 
torture 
others. 
In 
the 
compulsion 
neuroses 
one 
frequently 
finds 
that 
these 
patients 
have 
abandoned 
their 
sadistic 
guiding 
line 
and 
have 
turned 
to 
penance 
and 
reassuring 
measures, 
which 
have 
the 
same 
compulsory 
character 
and 
are 
not 
less 



oppressive 
for 
the 
environment 
than 
were 
the 
previous 
emotional 
predispositions 
of 
the 
patient, 
and 
hence 
are 
fitted 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
prime 
characteristics 
to 
render 
obvious 
the 
superiority 
of 
the 
neurotic. 
In 
the 
major 
attacks 
of 
so-called 
affective 
epilepsy, 
of 
hysteria, 
of 
trigeminal 
neuralgia, 
of 
migraine, 
etc., 
the 
masculine 
lust 
for 
power 
turns 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
neurotic 
" 
readiness 
for 
a 
paroxysm," 
but 
the 
helplessness 
of 
the 
environment 
and 
its 
suffering 
is 
not 
less 
but 
rather 
greater 
than 
in 
the 
rages 
and 
enmity 
which 
were 
active 
ways 
of 
the 
neurotic. 
An 
inclination 
for 
antivivisectionism, 
vegetarianism, 
prevention 
of 
cruelty 
to 
animals, 
charity, 
often 
distinguishes 
these 
connoisseurs 
of 
the 
sufferings 
of 
others, 
they 
cannot 
endure 
to 
see 
a 
goose 
bleed, 
but 
clap 
their 
hands 
gleefully 
when 
their 
opponent 
leaves 
the 
Exchange 
a 
bankrupt. 
Their 
inclination 
to 
sectarianism 
forms 
an 
inimical 
antisocial 
trait, 
as 
does 
their 
severe 
criticism 
of 
the 
valuation 
of 
others 
which 
they 
exhibit 
before 
they 
even 
form 
an 
opinion 
of 
their 
own. 
Tolerance 
is 
unknown 
to 
them, 
unless 
they 
cry 
out 
for 
it 
for 
themselves. 


If 
I 
sketch 
here 
traits 
which 
are 
to 
be 
encountered 
on 
all 
sides, 
they 
are 
nevertheless 
traits 
of 
a 
very 
prevalent 
neuroticism 
and 
signs 
of 
a 
deeply 
grounded 
uncertainty. 
They 
are 
by 
no 
means 
inherent 
in 
human 
nature, 
but 
are 
rather 
unsuccessful 
forms 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest 
which 
failed 
to 
bring 
assurance 
to 
the 
egoconsciousness. 
Should 
failure 
result 
in 
following 
the 
main 
guiding 
line, 
neurotic 
circuitous 
ways 
are 
entered 
upon 
and 
the 
"outbreak" 
of 
the 
neurosis 
or 
psychosis 
follows 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a 
change 
of 
form 
and 
accentuation 
of 
the 
guiding 
fiction. 


I 
must 
also 
disagree 
with 
the 
theory 
of 
congenital 
criminality 
of 
children 
and 
criminals 
promulgated 
by 
Lombroso 
and 
Ferrari, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
Stekel's 
theory 
of 
the 
universal 
criminality 
of 
neurotics. 
(Aggressionstrieb, 
1. 
c.). 
They 
are 
nothing 
but 
forms 
of 
the 
aggressive 
impulse 
become 
accentuated 
through 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
and 
which 
makes 
use 
of 
the 
masculine 
guiding 
line. 
The 
transformation 
into 
a 
clearly 
obvious 
neurosis 
follows 
the 
abandonment 
of 
this 
straightforward 
aggression. 
Where 
the 
fear 
of 
a 
decision 
is 
absent, 
an 
early 
result 
of 
the 
security-giving 
neurosis, 
and 
where 
there 
develops 
a 
strong 
tendency 
to 
deprive 
others 
of 
life, 
honor 
and 
property, 
criminality 
is 
the 
result.(*A. 
Jassny, 
" 
Dass

als 
Verbrecher," 
Arch. 
f. 
Kriminal-peych.,

) 



In 
the 
developed 
neurosis, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
one 
finds 
memory-traces 
of 
cruelty, 
criminality 
as 
well 
as 
those 
of 
sexuality 
purposefully 
exaggerated, 
falsely 
grouped 
and 
retained. 
Through 
the 
imagining 
of 
an 
accentuated 
conscience 
and 
exaggerated 
feeling 
of 
guilt, 
the 
masculine 
protest 
is 
diverted 
from 
the 
straight 
path 
of 
aggression 
and 
becomes 
inclined 
towards 
routes 
of 
softheartedness. 


It 
is 
only 
in 
the 
affect 
which 
occasionally 
comes 
to 
the 
surface, 
in 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
seizures, 
in 
the 
traits 
of 
character 
which 
become 
manifest 
now 
and 
then 
as 
is 
the 
case 
frequently 
at 
the 
onset 
of 
a 
psychosis 
and 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
goal 
of 
the 
neurotic 
subterfuges 
and 
traits 
of 
character 
which 
have 
become 
diverted 
from 
the 
straight 
course, 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
tyranny 
is 
erected 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
defeats, 
in 
the 
torture 
of 
others 
through 
self-torture, 
and 
finally 
in 
the 
intermixture 
of 
occasionally 
emerging 
original 
and 
direct 
traits 
of 
aggression, 
that 
one 
discovers 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
old 
over-tense 
goal 
still 
exists 
and 
that 
a 
change 
in 
the 
form 
of 
the 
fiction 
has 
only 
diverted 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
original 
tendency 
into 
other, 
often 
apparently 
opposite 
channels. 


Thus 
it 
happens 
that 
following 
a 
decidedly 
aggressive 
period, 
the 
greedy, 
brutal 
or 
violent 
traits 
of 
the 
psychopath, 
in 
anticipation 
of 
a 
defeat 
or 
after 
such 
has 
actually 
been 
experienced, 
may 
be 
made 
to 
approach 
more 
closely 
or 
even 
too 
eagerly 
general 
moral 
ideals, 
through 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
fictitious 
factor, 
" 
conscience," 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
the 
path 
of 
egocentric 
evil 
desire 
was 
entered 
upon 
from 
a 
feeling 
of 
inferiority. 
' 
Then 
I 
am 
destined 
to 
be 
bad," 
in 
this 
and 
similar 
ways 
the 
fictitious 
life-plan 
of 
many 
neurotics 
is 
unconsciously 
formed, 
until 
a 
glance 
into 
the 
abyss 
tears 
the 
giddy 
subject 
from 
his 
perilous 
position 
and 
forces 
him 
to 
seek 
a 
stronger 
security 
than 
is 
actually 
needed. 
Conscience 
develops 
out 
of 
the 
simpler 
forms 
of 
prevision 
and 
self-evaluation 
under 
the 
pressure 
of 
the 
craving 
for 
security, 
is 
endowed 
with 
the 
attributes 
of 
power 
and 
raised 
to 
a 
divinity, 
so 
that 
the 
individual 
may 
construct 
his 
ideal 
without 
objection 
from 
any 
side, 
so 
that 
he 
may 
be 
able 
better 
to 
orient 
himself 
in 
the 
uncertainty 
of 
events 
and 
have 
his 
choice 
in 
attacks 
and 
methods 
of 
combat 
to 
which 
his 
will 
to 
power 
guides 
him. 


But 
the 
neurotic 
brings 
about 
a 
reconstruction 
of 
his 
traits 
of 
character 
even 
for 
the 
sole 
purpose 
of 
being 
enabled 
to 
initiate 
the 
struggle 
to 
better 
advantage. 
Such 
is 
the 
case 
when 
he 
ascribes 
to 
the 
sexual 
partner 
of 
whom 



he 
stands 
in 
fear, 
traits 
of 
an 
egotistic, 
cruel 
and 
deceptive 
nature. 
He 
is 
then 
likely 
to 
hunt 
out 
and 
exaggerate 
from 
his 
memories 
and 
emotions, 
those 
which 
confirm 
his 
own 
character 
as 
affectionate, 
mild 
and 
open. 
For 
the 
purpose 
of 
proving 
these 
characteristics 
he 
will 
often 
act 
as 
though 
his 
virtues 
had 
the 
reality 
of 
innate 
and 
indestructible 
qualities. 


One 
important 
question 
must 
still 
be 
touched 
upon. 
Nearly 
all 
of 
our 
neurotic 
patients 
come 
to 
us 
in 
the 
" 
stadium 
of 
virtue," 
after 
having 
experienced 
a 
defeat, 
and 
we 
must 
therefore 
expect 
to 
discover 
their 
masculine 
protest 
less 
in 
direct 
traits 
of 
character 
and 
emotional 
predispositions 
than 
in 
neurotic 
circuitous 
ways, 
accentuated 
security 
devices, 
which 
may 
be 
detected 
only 
with 
difficulty 
through 
the 
analysis 
of 
their 
dreams 
and 
symptoms. 
One 
will 
discover 
that 
the 
infantile, 
fictive 
guiding 
line 
has 
only 
become 
more 
effective, 
and 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
concerns 
the 
cases 
just 
spoken 
of, 
that 
their 
neurotic 
symptoms 
lead 
to 
a 
more 
intense 
degradation 
of 
others 
than 
did 
their 
original 
cruelty 
and 
desire 
to 
torture. 
For 
all 
these 
guiding 
lines 
are 
tensely 
stretched 
between 
the 
insecurity 
of 
the 
constitutionally 
or 
subjectively 
defective 
individual 
and 
his 
unattainable 
ego-
ideal. 
However 
far 
back 
into 
childhood 
sadism, 
perversions 
of 
various 
sorts, 
sexual-libido, 
in 
short 
the 
masculine 
protest 
may 
extend, 
they 
are 
always 
constructed 
according 
to 
a 
life-plan 
and 
reveal 
their 
dependence 
thereon. 
The 
liberation 
of 
the 
sadism 
from 
the 
neurotic 
predisposition, 
and 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
Freud, 
from 
the 
unconscious 
and 
from 
repression, 
is 
to 
be 
likened 
to 
a 
carrying 
back 
of 
the 
neurosis 
to 
an 
earlier 
stadium, 
to 
a 
time 
before 
the 
defeat. 
Freud's 
scientific 
work, 
important 
and 
full 
of 
results 
as 
it 
was 
for 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
neurosis, 
did 
not 
give 
a 
correct 
picture 
of 
the 
neurotic 
psyche. 
The 
neurotic 
predispositions 
of 
heightened 
affectivity, 
the 
exaggerated 
aggressiveness, 
the 
hypersensibility, 
and 
the 
direct, 
compensatory 
character-peculiarities 
require 
a 
liberation 
from 
their 
overtense 
state; 
as 
do 
also 
the 
inclinations 
to 
neurotic 
perversions 
which 
are 
often 
constructed 
at 
a 
very 
early 
age, 
and 
which 
are 
to 
come 
to 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
general 
fear 
of 
decisions 
through 
a 
compromise 
formation. 
For 
this 
reason 
the 
effort 
should 
be 
made 
to 
conquer 
this 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
and 
the 
tendency 
to 
disparage 
which 
results 
therefrom, 
these 
two 
important 
poles 
of 
every 
neurotic 
state, 
by 
means 
of 
insight 
and 
contemplation 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
patient, 
for 
they 
like 
their 
sexual 
analogies 
(sadism, 
masochism, 
fetichism, 



homosexuality, 
incest-phantasies, 
apparent 
heightening 
or 
weakening 
of 
the 
sexual 
impulse), 
already 
form 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
neurosis.

THE 
NEUROTIC 
STRIVING 
FOR 
KNOWLEDGE 


THE 
abstraction 
of 
the 
concept, 
"above-beneath," 
obviously 
plays 
an 
extremely 
important 
role 
in 
the 
civilization 
of 
mankind, 
and 
is 
probably 
even 
connected 
with 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
upright 
carriage 
of 
human 
beings. 
As 
every 
child 
repeats 
this 
process 
in 
the 
course 
of 
his 
development 
when 
he 
arises 
from 
the 
floor 
and 
as 
training 
also 
teaches 
him 
a 
disgust 
for 
clinging 
to 
the 
floor 
and 
creeping 
on 
it 
from 
hygienic 
reasons, 
for 
being 
"down"; 
this 
higher 
development 
in 
childhood 
may 
contribute 
not 
a 
little 
to 
the 
tendency 
to 
value 
"up" 
more 
highly; 
a 
certain 
proof 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
small 
children 
who 
throw 
themselves 
on 
the 
floor 
angrily 
and 
thus 
try 
to 
make 
themselves 
dirty 
in 
order 
to 
attract 
the 
attention 
of 
their 
parents, 
but 
betray 
thereby 
that 
the 
idea 
of 
" 
being 
down 
" 
as 
a 
fiction 
of 
what 
is 
forbidden, 
dirty, 
sinful, 
is 
developing 
in 
them. 
In 
this 
psychic 
gesture 
of 
small 
children 
may 
also 
be 
detected 
the 
model 
for 
strongly 
developed 
later 
neurotic 
traits. 


Further 
notions 
may 
be 
gathered 
from 
the 
impressions 
of 
heavenly 
bodies, 
as 
may 
be 
seen 
from 
a 
psychological 
understanding 
of 
the 
various 
religions 
and 
of 
civilization. 
The 
aboriginal 
races, 
like 
the 
child, 
regarded 
the 
sun, 
the 
day, 
joy, 
elevation, 
being 
" 
up," 
as 
resembling 
each 
other 
and 
frequently 
associated 
" 
being 
down 
" 
with 
sin, 
death, 
dirt, 
sickness 
and 
night. 


The 
antithesis 
of 
" 
up-down 
" 
is 
not 
less 
distinct 
than 
in 
ancient 
religions. 



From 
a 
work 
by 
K. 
Th. 
Preuss 
on 
" 
Die 
Feuergotter 
als 
Ausgangspunkt 
zum 
Verstandniss 
der 
Mexicanischen 
Religion," 
Mitteilungen 
der 
Anthropologischen 
Gesellschaft 
in 
Wien, 
1903, 
we 
are 
able 
to 
infer 
the 
deeply 
rooted 
character 
of 
this 
antithesis 
and 
the 
association 
of 
" 
updown." 
The 
fire 
god 
is 
also 
the 
god 
of 
the 
dead 
who 
live 
with 
him 
at 
the 
place 
of 
descent. 


Overturned 
vessels, 
people 
who 
fell, 
were 
regarded 
as 
presentations 
of 
" 
up-downs," 
that 
is 
to 
say 
of 
falling 
into 
the 
realm 
of 
the 
dead, 
and 
thoughts 
of 
preservation 
and 
destructive 
activities 
were 
given 
this 
form 
of 
spatial 
antithesis. 
(*I 
am 
especially 
indebted 
to 
Prof. 
Dr. 
S. 
Oppenheim 
for 
some 
important 
historical 
data 
for 
my 
work.) 


Further, 
sensations 
and 
impressions 
from 
childhood 
tend 
to 
give 
form 
to 
the 
spatial 
notion 
of 
" 
up-down 
" 
and 
to 
define 
the 
contrast 
more 
sharply. 
Falling, 
tailing 
down, 
is 
painful, 
blamable, 
dishonorable, 
at 
times, 
punishable. 
Not 
rarely 
it 
is 
the 
result 
of 
inattention, 
lack 
of 
foresight, 
and 
the 
child 
may 
therefore 
assume 
these 
sensory 
traces 
as 
an 
admonition, 
so 
that 
being 
"down" 
may 
be 
felt 
as 
a 
forceful 
expression 
for 
" 
fallen," 
for 
inattention, 
for 
unskillfulness, 
for 
defeat, 
not 
without 
releasing 
or 
at 
least 
stimulating 
the 
protest 
which 
is 
directed 
against 
the 
approaching 
feeling 
of 
inferiority. 
In 
this 
category 
of 
" 
downup," 
one 
of 
which 
cannot 
be 
thought 
of 
without 
the 
other, 
is 
further 
found 
intermingled 
trains 
of 
thought 
(in 
both 
neurotics 
and 
normal 
persons), 
which 
express 
the 
antitheses 
of 
conquest 
and 
defeat, 
of 
triumph 
and 
inferiority. 
In 
individual 
cases, 
upon 
analysis, 
memory 
traces 
emerge 
of 
riding, 
swimming, 
flying, 
mountain 
climbing, 
climbing 
up 
and 
of 
climbing 
staircases, 
the 
antitheses 
of 
which 
reveal 
themselves 
as 
carrying 
a 
rider, 
incubus, 
sinking 
in 
water, 
falling 
down, 
tumbling 
down, 
a 
check 
in 
an 
upward 
or 
forward 
movement. 
The 
more 
abstract 
and 
figurative 
the 
memory 
is 
in 
dreams, 
in 
hallucinations, 
in 
separate 
neurotic 
symptoms, 
the 
more 
perceptible 
are 
the 
transitions 
which 
show 
a 
sexual 
factor. 
In 
this 
connection 
the 
masculine 
principle 
is 
only 
represented 
by 
the 
feeling 
of 
greater 
power, 
as 
being 
" 
up," 
and 
the 
feminine 
by 
the 
feeling 
of 
being 
" 
down." 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
see 
that 
scuffling 
and 
its 
results 
support 
this 
valuation. 


In 
the 
games 
of 
children 
which 
are 
preparatory 
for 
the 
conflicts 
of 
life 
(Karl 
Groos) 
this 
striving 
" 
upwards" 
is 
regularly 
found. 
Also 
in 
the 
thoughts 
of 
children 
concerning 
a 
vocation. 
In 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
psychic 
development 



reality 
is 
seen 
working 
as 
a 
brake, 
so 
that 
the 
abstraction 
" 
upwards 
" 
has 
a 
tendency 
to 
assume 
a 
concrete 
form 
in 
some. 
Very 
often 
in 
this 
connection 
caution 
in 
the 
form 
of 
fear 
of 
being 
in 
elevated 
positions 
is 
at 
work 
and 
changes 
the 
wish 
to 
be 
a 
roof 
maker 
into 
that 
of 
being 
a 
master 
builder, 
makes 
of 
the 
aviator 
a 
builder 
of 
flying 
machines, 
changes 
the 
wish 
of 
the 
little 
girl 
to 
be 
like 
her 
father 
into 
the 
more 
attainable 
wish 
of 
being 
able 
to 
command 
like 
her 
mother. 


The 
striving 
for 
security 
and 
the 
masculine 
protest 
make 
the 
greatest 
possible 
use 
of 
the 
resulting 
guiding 
lines 
of 
the 
" 
will 
to 
be 
up." 
Under 
the 
pressure 
of 
the 
fiction 
the 
neurotic 
is 
sometimes 
forced 
to 
decisions, 
to 
conflict 
and 
strife, 
to 
passionate 
haste, 
sometimes 
to 
cautious, 
hesitating, 
doubting 
behavior. 


Thus 
he 
is 
placed 
in 
a 
position 
to 
make 
an 
estimate 
of 
his 
worth 
in 
life 
and 
that 
through 
instances 
which 
escape 
the 
notice 
of 
others. 
He 
must 
scent 
out, 
hold 
fast, 
exaggerate 
or 
arrange 
situations 
which 
seem 
to 
us 
of 
very 
little 
value. 
Let 
us 
follow 
this 
conduct 
in 
detail. 


A 
girl, 
25 
years 
old, 
came 
to 
us 
with 
complaints 
of 
frequent 
headache, 
emotional 
attacks, 
disinclination 
for 
life 
and 
work. 
Traces 
of 
rickets 
were 
perceptible. 
The 
history 
of 
childhood 
revealed 
an 
extreme 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
which 
was 
kept 
at 
a 
strained 
tension 
because 
of 
the 
mother's 
preference 
for 
a 
younger 
brother 
and 
because 
of 
his 
intellectual 
superiority. 
The 
most 
cherished 
wish 
of 
this 
patient 
had 
always 
been 
to 
be 
big, 
very 
wise, 
and 
a 
man. 
She 
took 
the 
preparatory 
attitudes 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
this 
masculine 
ego-consciousness 
as 
far 
as 
was 
possible 
from 
her 
father. 
When 
this 
was 
not 
possible 
for 
her, 
a 
small, 
stupid 
girl, 
she 
had 
secured 
the 
imaginary 
egoconsciousness 
through 
emotional 
expedients 
of 
rage 
and 
anger 
against 
her 
relatives 
and 
especially 
in 
obstinacy 
toward 
her 
mother, 
in 
the 
simulation 
of 
stupidity, 
of 
awkwardness 
and 
sickness, 
and 
finally 
in 
the 
arrangement 
of 
laziness. 
I 
omit 
here 
the 
lines 
constructed 
by 
her 
of 
manliness, 
of 
malice, 
of 
obstinacy, 
and 
refrain 
also 
from 
analyzing 
her 
overweening 
ambition, 
her 
inclination 
to 
lying 
and 
ostentation, 
and 
will 
content 
myself 
with 
showing 
how 
all 
these 
habits 
are 
combined 
in 
the 
impulse 
to 
be 
"up" 
and 
serve 
the 
tendency 
to 
depreciate 
others. 
For 
this 
purpose 
I 
will 
refer 
to 
one 
of 
her 
dreams, 
which 
contains 
a 
modest 
reference 
to 
the 
psychology 
of 
somnambulism. 
The 
dream 
is 
as 
follows: 



" 
I 
became 
a 
sleepwalker 
and 
climbed 
on 
to 
the 
head 
of 
everybody." 


The 
patient 
had 
heard 
sleepwalkers 
spoken 
of 
a 
few 
days 
previous 
to 
this 
dream. 
In 
her 
attempt 
at 
explanation 
of 
this 
dream 
a 
series 
of 
ambitious 
thoughts 
emerged 
which 
takes 
the 
form 
among 
others 
of 
a 
sexual 
picture 
of 
domination 
over 
her 
future 
husband. 
She 
remembered 
dreams 
of 
earlier 
times 
which 
represented 
her 
as 
riding 
on 
a 
man, 
on 
a 
horse.* 
* 
Women 
riding 
on 
a 
man 
one 
frequently 
finds 
as 
the 
subject 
of 
paintings. 
I 
wish 
to 
call 
attention 
to 
Burgkmair, 
Hans 
Baldung, 
Grien, 
Diirer, 
and 
to 
tell 
of 
the 
many 
prints 
which 
show 
Alexander's 
paramours 
riding 
on 
Aristotle. 


I 
have 
never 
treated 
a 
real 
sleepwalker, 
but 
one 
finds 
this 
neurotic 
symptom 
sometimes 
indicated 
in 
onsets. 
It 
is 
manifested 
as 
is 
the 
dream 
of 
flying, 
of 
climbing 
stairs, 
etc., 
as 
a 
dynamic 
expression 
of 
the 
" 
will 
to 
be 
up 
" 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
manly 
aggression. 
In 
a 
patient 
who 
showed 
strong 
masochistic 
traits, 
I 
once 
discovered 
strenuous 
attempts 
to 
reach 
the 
ceiling 
of 
the 
room 
by 
putting 
his 
legs 
out 
on 
the 
wall 
during 
the 
night. 
The 
interpretation 
showed 
that 
the 
patient 
rescued 
himself 
from 
a 
real 
or 
an 
imagined 
situation 
which 
was 
regarded 
as 
feminine 
by 
turning 
around 
to 
the 
masculine 
protest 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
gave 
expression 
to 
this 
symbolic 
modus 
dicendi 
through 
his 
striving 
upwards. 


The 
second 
thought 
of 
the 
dream, 
" 
I 
climbed 
on 
to 
the 
heads 
of 
everybody," 
reveals 
the 
same 
meaning. 
The 
patient 
makes 
use 
here 
of 
a 
form 
of 
speech 
to 
express 
that 
she 
is 
superior 
to 
all 
others. 
Her 
striving 
upwards 
is 
only 
to 
be 
understood 
dialectically 
in 
an 
antithesis, 
for 
the 
thoughts 
of 
insecure 
neurotics 
generally 
move 
in 
strongly 
antithetical 
directions, 
in 
an 
" 
either-or, 
" 
in 
an 
abstraction 
understood 
according 
to 
the 
scheme 
of 
the 
opposites, 
masculine-feminine. 
The 
innumerable 
middle 
ways 
are 
not 
chosen 
because 
the 
two 
neurotic 
poles, 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
and 
the 
overtense 
egoconsciousness 
on 
the 
other 
only 
permit 
the 
antithetical 
values 
to 
reach 
consciousness. 
* 


That 
the 
tentative, 
insecurely 
begun, 
beginnings 
in 
philosophy 
have 
likewise 
hypotasized 
this 
antithetical 
mode 
of 
thinking 
we 
have 
already 
emphasized. 


Karl 
Joel 
speaks 
of 
this 
problem 
in 
the 
" 
Geechichte 
der 
Zahlprinzipien 
in 
der 
griechischen 
Philosophic 
" 
(Zeitechr. 
f. 
Philosophic 
und 
philos. 
Kritik. 
Bd. 
97). 
and 
states 
in 
this 
study, 
" 
The 
real 
root 
of 
' 
antithesis 
' 
lies 
in 
the 



instinctive, 
peculiar 
fixity 
of 
thought 
which 
only 
recognizes 
absolutes." 


The 
train 
of 
thought 
of 
this 
dream 
permits 
us 
to 
divine 
the 
neurotic 
predispositions 
of 
the 
patient. 
In 
reality 
her 
masculine 
protest, 
her 
inclination 
to 
belittle 
others, 
her 
ambition, 
her 
sensitiveness, 
defiance, 
unyieldingness, 
obstinacy, 
is 
sufficiently 
remarkable. 
The 
psychic 
significance 
of 
her 
headache 
is 
revealed 
in 
this 
dream. 
Previous 
analysis 
showed 
in 
fact 
that 
the 
symptom 
always 
made 
its 
appearance 
when 
there 
was 
a 
feeling 
of 
defeat, 
of 
belittlement, 
of 
emasculation 
to 
speak 
in 
the 
words 
of 
the 
dream, 
when 
one 
"mounted 
her 
head." 
In 
the 
phases 
of 
the 
headache, 
therefore, 
through 
the 
construction 
of 
these 
" 
expedients 
of 
pain 
" 
with 
consequent 
hallucinations 
of 
pain 
she 
strove 
to 
dominate 
all 
persons, 
especially 
her 
mother, 
and 
was 
able 
to 
enhance 
her 
ego-consciousness 
thereby 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
she 
was 
able 
to 
do 
it 
through 
defiance, 
laziness, 
and 
obstinacy, 
only 
to 
a 
greater 
degree, 
in 
short, 
had 
thus 
mounted 
on 
the 
heads 
of 
others. 


In 
children 
the 
tendency 
to 
be 
up 
is 
unmistakable 
and 
coincides 
with 
the 
wish 
to 
be 
big. 
They 
wish 
to 
be 
lifted 
up 
and 
like 
to 
climb 
on 
sofas, 
tables, 
boxes, 
and 
usually 
connect 
with 
this 
striving 
the 
idea 
of 
showing 
themselves 
unconquerably 
courageous, 
manly. 
How 
closely 
bordering 
on 
this 
is 
the 
tendency 
to 
depreciate 
others 
is 
shown 
by 
their 
joy 
when 
they 
succeed 
in 
being 
"bigger" 
than 
grown 
people. 
The 
heightening 
of 
the 
aggressive 
tendency 
is 
manifested 
in 
children 
who 
show 
neurotic 
symptoms 
at 
an 
early 
age 
by 
this 
exhibition. 
Thus 
it 
sometimes 
happens 
that 
children 
in 
the 
consulting 
room 
of 
the 
physician 
constantly 
climb 
on 
tables 
and 
benches 
and 
thus 
reveal 
their 
contempt. 


The 
danger 
of 
falling, 
of 
accidents 
in 
striving 
upwards 
as 
well 
as 
the 
customary 
training 
to 
cowardice, 
force 
the 
majority 
of 
children 
to 
a 
change 
of 
form 
of 
the 
guiding 
line, 
or 
to 
neurotic, 
circuitous 
ways, 
whereby 
the 
fear 
of 
elevated 
positions 
and 
heights 
opposes 
itself 
as 
an 
admonition 
usually 
in 
a 
symbolical 
form 
to 
undertakings 
and 
ventures 
of 
all 
sorts, 
and 
thus 
becomes 
the 
foundation 
of 
a 
predisposition 
which 
has 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
neurotic 
check 
on 
aggression. 
At 
times 
the 
desire 
to 
be 
up 
is 
transposed 
for 
the 
most 
part 
to 
a 
tendency 
to 
depreciate 
others. 
The 
tendency 
of 
those 
suffering 
from 
dementia 
praecox 
to 
change 
the 
furniture 
stands 
regularly 
in 
such 
close 
connection 
with 
the 
depreciation 
of 
the 
surroundings 
that 
the 
suspicion 
is 



justified, 
that 
this 
is 
one 
of 
the 
fictitious, 
abstract, 
circuitous 
ways 
by 
which 
the 
psychotic 
enhances 
his 
ego-consciousness. 
In 
a 
transferred 
form 
this 
placing 
of 
others 
in 
an 
inferior 
position 
is 
expressed 
in 
the 
tendency 
to 
calumny, 
especially, 
however, 
in 
neurotic 
jealousy 
and 
delirium 
of 
jealousy. 
I 
discovered 
further 
an 
interesting 
sort 
of 
derogation 
in 
nervous 
subjects 
in 
their 
care, 
their 
anxious 
behavior, 
in 
their 
fears 
for 
the 
fate 
of 
other 
people. 
They 
act 
as 
if 
others 
were 
incapable 
of 
caring 
for 
themselves 
without 
their 
help. 
They 
are 
constantly 
giving 
advice, 
wish 
to 
do 
everything 
themselves, 
are 
always 
finding 
new 
dangers 
and 
are 
never 
contented 
until 
others 
confide 
themselves 
entirely 
to 
their 
care. 
Neurotic 
parents 
are 
thus 
the 
cause 
of 
much 
harm, 
and 
in 
love 
and 
marriage 
much 
friction 
is 
caused 
in 
.this 
manner. 
One 
of 
my 
patients, 
who 
was 
run 
over 
twice 
in 
his 
childhood, 
associated 
his 
feeling 
of 
injured 
personality 
with 
this 
memory 
and 
whenever 
he 
crossed 
the 
street 
with 
another 
person 
he 
led 
that 
person 
anxiously 
over 
by 
the 
arm 
as 
though 
without 
his 
help, 
his 
companion 
could 
not 
have 
crossed. 
Many 
persons 
are 
filled 
with 
fears 
when 
their 
relatives 
travel 
by 
rail, 
go 
swimming 
or 
canoeing, 
give 
their 
nurses 
constant 
instructions 
and 
continue 
their 
tendency 
to 
depreciation 
in 
exaggerated 
criticisms 
and 
corrections. 
In 
schools 
and 
in 
offices 
this 
nagging 
depreciation 
is 
always 
found 
in 
neurotic 
teachers 
and 
superiors. 
In 
the 
practice 
of 
psychotherapy 
it 
is 
one 
of 
the 
main 
requirements 
to 
obviate 
predispositions 
of 
this 
sort, 
even 
when 
the 
patient 
provokes 
them. 
This 
requirement 
often 
amounts 
to 
a 
renunciation 
of 
authority. 
Every 
one 
who 
has 
become 
acquainted 
with 
the 
hypersensitiveness 
of 
neurotic 
subjects 
knows 
with 
what 
slight 
cause 
they 
feel 
themselves 
to 
be 
undervalued. 
One 
of 
my 
patients 
who 
suffered 
from 
hysteroepilepsy 
and 
always 
conducted 
himself 
as 
if 
he 
wished 
to 
place 
himself 
in 
an 
entirely 
subordinate 
position 
fell 
on 
one 
occasion 
unconscious 
before 
my 
door. 
In 
such 
"accidents" 
the 
tendency 
to 
undervaluation 
is 
clearly 
recognizable. 
While 
still 
in 
a 
confused 
condition 
he 
addressed 
me 
as 
" 
Teacher," 
and 
stammered 
that 
he 
would 
bring 
a 
note. 
After 
the 
attack 
he 
told 
me 
that 
he 
had 
come 
unwillingly 
on 
that 
occasion. 
The 
analysis 
showed 
that 
he 
had 
come 
to 
regard 
me 
as 
a 
teacher 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
the 
distance 
necessary 
for 
the 
conflict, 
in 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
act 
as 
though 
he 
were 
obliged 
to 
come 
to 
the 
school 
and 
to 
bring 
a 
written 
excuse 
for 
his 
absence. 
After 
he 
had 
placed 
himself 
as 
far 
as 
his 
feelings 
were 
concerned 
in 
this 
situation 
of 
inferiority 
he 
could 
allow 
the 
compensatory 
expedients 
derived 
therefrom 
to 
come 
into 



play 
in 
order 
to 
belittle 
me. 


A 
girl 
20 
years 
old 
suffered 
from 
the 
compulsory 
idea 
that 
she 
could 
not 
ride 
in 
a 
street-car 
because 
when 
she 
got 
in 
the 
thought 
always 
emerged 
that 
a 
man 
might 
get 
out 
at 
the 
same 
time 
and 
fall 
under 
the 
wheels. 
Analysis 
showed 
that 
this 
compulsory 
neurosis 
represented 
the 
masculine 
protest 
of 
the 
patient 
in 
the 
figure 
of 
being 
" 
above 
" 
corresponding 
with 
which 
the 
man 
must 
be 
" 
under," 
deprived 
of 
value, 
and 
should 
bear 
the 
injuries 
which 
he 
imposes 
on 
women, 
in 
addition 
the 
exaggerated 
striving 
for 
security 
constructed 
the 
protection 
of 
anxiety 
which 
was 
intended 
to 
satisfy 
further 
the 
fear 
of 
the 
male. 
Even 
then 
when 
her 
superiority 
was 
assured 
she 
could 
not 
bring 
herself 
to 
decide 
on 
marriage, 
for 
her 
future 
husband 
would 
have 
a 
hard 
time 
with 
her 
from 
this 
point 
of 
view 
one 
is 
able 
to 
understand 
the 
often 
incomprehensible 
striving 
of 
many 
neurotic 
girls 
and 
women 
to 
exact 
from 
their 
partners 
the 
greatest 
sacrifices 
and 
put 
them 
to 
the 
most 
severe 
tests, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
hope 
to 
attain 
thereby 
an 
enhancement 
of 
their 
ego-
consciousness 
to 
the 
point 
of 
an 
appearance 
of 
manliness. 


Thinking 
in 
crude 
antitheses 
is 
therefore 
in 
itself 
a 
sign 
of 
uncertainty 
and 
adheres 
to 
the 
sole 
genuine 
antithesis, 
that 
between 
male* 
and 
female. 
In 
this 
a 
judgment 
of 
worth 
is 
already 
given, 
which 
infuses 
itself 
unnoticed 
in 
every 
"antithesis" 
(Joel) 
because 
this 
antithesis 
is 
always 
made 
in 
the 
figure 
of 
a 
dissection 
of 
the 
hermaphroditic 
form 
into 
a 
male 
and 
female 
half. 
Plato 
has 
perhaps 
expressed 
this 
idea 
most 
purely. 
And 
human 
perception 
was 
unable 
until 
the 
time 
of 
Kant 
to 
disentangle 
itself 
from 
this 
self-made 
fiction. 
But 
the 
neurotically 
disposed 
child 
adheres 
to 
the 
oppositeness 
of 
the 
sexes 
and 
to 
the 
higher 
valuation 
of 
the 
male 
principle 
therewith 
connected 
in 
order 
to 
escape 
from 
uncertainty 
and 
in 
order 
to 
find 
a 
guiding 
line 
for 
his 
idea 
of 
egoistic 
worth. 
Thus 
it 
happens 
that 
this 
guiding 
fiction 
contains 
a 
manly 
aspect, 
and 
that 
in 
all 
the 
experiences 
and 
strivings 
of 
neurotic 
individuals 
the 
masculine 
protest 
is 
revealed 
as 
the 
ordering 
principle 
and 
motive 
force. 
The 
antithesis 
of 
the 
sexes 
is 
admirably 
expressed 
in 
the 
above 
given 
symbol 
of 
the 
spatial 
opposites 
of 
"up-down." 


And 
thus 
it 
becomes 
comprehensible 
that 
in 
every 
one 
of 
our 
psychological 
analyses 
this 
expression 
of 
a 
sharp 
antithetical 
schema 
must 
somehow 
or 
other 
come 
to 
light. 
It 
is 
still 
an 
open 
question 
whether 
reinforcements 
of 
the 
antithesis 
have 
been 
acquired 
from 
the 
events 
of 
early 



childhood 
and 
the 
resulting 
impressions, 
from 
the 
observations 
of 
sexual 
relations 
in 
human 
beings 
and 
animals, 
or 
whether 
the 
consciousness 
of 
the 
higher 
position 
of 
the 
male 
has 
been 
fixed 
by 
the 
normal 
situations 
of 
sexual 
relations. 


The 
"will 
to 
be 
above" 
of 
the 
neurotic 
woman 
is 
produced 
by 
her 
manly 
guiding 
idea 
and 
represents 
an 
attempt 
to 
identify 
herself 
with 
the 
man. 
The 
importunity 
and 
rigidity 
with 
which 
this 
takes 
place 
even 
in 
neurotic, 
circuitous 
ways 
testifies 
to 
the 
original 
uncertainty 
and 
fear 
of 
being 
"below," 
undervalued, 
female. 
Thus 
the 
transcendental 
egoistic 
idea 
attains 
its 
powerful 
dominancy 
because 
it 
promises 
compensation, 
the 
overcoming 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
in 
the 
opposite 
direction. 
Every 
gesture 
then 
says, 
"I 
will 
be 
above, 
I 
will 
be 
a 
man 
because 
I 
am 
afraid 
as 
a 
woman 
of 
being 
oppressed 
and 
misused." 
Ambition 
and 
envy 
are 
hereby 
strengthened 
and 
an 
unusually 
lively 
mistrust 
is 
awakened 
against 
every 
possibility 
of 
belittlement. 
Where 
there 
is 
real 
undervaluation, 
however, 
the 
masculine 
protest 
flashes 
forth 
and 
leads 
from 
slight 
and 
often 
from 
no 
cause 
to 
the 
well-known, 
unpleasant 
frictions 
of 
the 
neurotic 
individual 
with 
his 
environment, 
in 
which 
the 
principle 
weapons 
of 
attack 
used 
to 
confirm 
the 
feeling 
of 
power 
are 
disputatiousness, 
love 
for 
justice, 
obstinate 
adherence 
to 
opinion 
and 
trust 
in 
penetration. 
And 
in 
this 
connection 
the 
tendency 
to 
"look 
beneath" 
will 
never 
be 
absent, 
especially 
in 
times 
of 
uncertainty, 
the 
acute 
perception 
of 
affronts, 
neglects, 
undervaluations, 
and 
further 
than 
this 
arrangements 
of 
depression, 
anxiety, 
remorse, 
feeling 
of 
guilt 
and 
pangs 
of 
conscience. 
Stronger 
measures 
for 
security 
are 
applied 
and 
new 
neurotic 
symptoms 
and 
deviations 
are 
constructed, 
the 
neurotic 
traits 
of 
character 
become 
more 
deeply 
seated 
and 
more 
abstract 
and 
the 
fully 
developed 
picture 
of 
the 
neurosis 
arises.* 


* 
While 
writing 
this 
book 
I 
discovered 
in 
Alfred 
v. 
Berger's 
" 
Hofrat 
Eysenhardt 
" 
an 
excellent 
example 
of 
the 
type 
just 
described 
in 
whom 
the 
striving 
to 
be 
above 
was 
especially 
well 
marked 
and 
whose 
lectures 
I 
would 
recommend 
to 
every 
psychotherapeutist. 
One 
will 
find 
in 
this 
description 
a 
repetition 
of 
all 
we 
have 
said 
concerning 
this 
type 
of 
individual 
from 
a 
poet's 
standpoint. 
The 
all 
too 
powerful 
elan 
of 
the 
father, 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
of 
the 
boy 
along 
with 
the 
compensatory 
masculine 
protest. 
The 
accentuation 
of 
sexual 
desire, 
of 
the 
will 
to 
power, 
the 
preparation 
for 
the 
patricide, 

fetichism, 
contentious 
tendency, 
the 
exaggerated 
assurance 
in 
the 
case 
of 
threatening 
defeat. 
The 
construction 
of 
remorse, 
self-reproach, 
hallucinations, 
and 
compulsory 
ideas 
as 
a 
revengeful 
annihilation 
of 
the 
authority 
of 
the 
State. 
The 
loss 
of 
a 
tooth 
and 
the 
exaggerated 
fear 
of 
woman 
as 
the 
result 
of 
a 
further 
accentuated 
masculine 
protest, 
and 
along 
with 
this 
the 
repeated 
arrangement 
of 
an 
exaggerated 
sexual 
desire, 
all 
of 
which 
is 
very 
impressive 
and 
obvious, 
a 
description 
of 
the 
neurotic 
subterfuge 
which 
reminds 
one 
of 
Dostoyeffsky's 
descriptions 
and 
which 
requires 
no 
further 
elucidation. 


Thus 
the 
revolt 
for 
attaining 
a 
heightened 
ego-consciousness 
is 
fairly 
contrived, 
the 
introduction 
thereof 
is 
formed 
by 
the 
disease 
itself 
and 
by 
the 
predispositions 
to 
disease 
which 
in 
some 
way 
or 
other 
are 
made 
use 
of 
as 
means 
for 
attaining 
power 
in 
the 
environment. 


A 
patient, 
21 
years 
old, 
came 
under 
treatment 
because 
of 
extreme 
depression, 
loss 
of 
sleep 
and 
compulsory 
thoughts. 
It 
was 
ascertained 
that 
she 
had 
always 
had 
neurotic 
traits 
of 
character. 
The 
compulsory 
neurosis 
broke 
out 
as 
her 
relations 
with 
a 
man 
whom 
she 
wanted 
to 
marry 
became 
serious. 
The 
typical 
pathogenic 
situation 
brings 
the 
neurotic 
"no" 
to 
light, 
and 
while 
the 
patient 
was 
making 
her 
preparations 
for 
marriage, 
and 
did 
not 
hesitate 
with 
the 
affirmative 
answer, 
she 
arranged 
for 
the 
neurosis 
and 
conducted 
herself 
as 
if 
she 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
marry. 
In 
all 
these 
very 
numerous 
cases 
the 
next 
step 
is 
a 
condition 
which 
therefore 
takes 
the 
form, 
" 
If 
I 
were 
well, 
if 
I 
should 
overcome 
my 
present 
condition," 
etc. 
(in 
men, 
often: 
"HI 
were 
potent 
"), 
"I 
would 
marry." 
By 
this 
condition, 
which 
is 
equivalent 
to 
a 
vacillation, 
a 
doubt, 
to 
a 
special 
attitude 
of 
caution, 
the 
patient 
escapes 
all 
responsibility, 
has 
drawn 
the 
bolt 
in 
secret 
until 
something 
further 
happens, 
but 
may 
act 
as 
if 
he 
wishes 
to 
open 
the 
door. 
The 
traits 
of 
mistrust, 
of 
disputatiousness, 
of 
tyranny, 
and 
of 
wishing 
to 
be 
"above" 
are 
clearly 
revealed 
in 
the 
analysis, 
and 
one 
can 
easily 
comprehend 
that 
the 
fear 
of 
not 
being 
equal 
to 
the 
partner, 
the 
menace 
of 
feeling 
another 
superior 
in 
love 
or 
marriage 
necessitates 
the 
secret 
retreat 
and 
constructs 
the 
neurotic 
symptom. 
Not 
rarely 
one 
finds 
a 
purposeful 
valuation 
of 
the 
person's 
own 
sexuality 
from 
which 
without 
proof 
or 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
memories 
which 
everyone 
has 
at 
command, 
or 
by 
evoking 
unconscious 
falsifications 
the 
impression 
is 
sought 
that 
it 
is 
too 
little 



or 
too 
great 
to 
permit 
a 
marriage 
to 
be 
ventured 
on. 


The 
further 
communication 
of 
the 
patient 
explained 
that 
she 
could 
undertake 
nothing 
because 
whenever 
she 
began 
anything 
the 
thought 
emerged 
that 
it 
was 
useless 
because 
every 
one 
must 
die. 
As 
one 
sees, 
a 
nonsensical 
thought, 
which 
at 
the 
same 
time 
has 
sense, 
but 
above 
all 
brings 
time 
and 
development 
to 
a 
standstill 
and 
renders 
the 
entrance 
of 
the 
patient 
upon 
marriage 
impossible. 
In 
accordance 
with 
this 
the 
conviction 
that 
the 
patient 
only 
came 
to 
the 
physician 
because 
she 
was 
forced 
to, 
that 
she 
had 
no 
hope 
of 
cure 
and 
only 
desired 
proof 
of 
her 
incurability 
followed 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
course. 
One 
of 
her 
dreams 
showed 
much 
of 
this 
constellation. 
It 
was 
as 
follows: 


" 
A 
physician 
came 
to 
me, 
who 
said 
I 
should 
jump 
and 
sing 
when 
thoughts 
of 
death 
came 
to 
me, 
then 
the 
thoughts 
would 
vanish. 
Then 
a 
child 
(hesitatingly), 
a 
large 
one 
was 
brought. 
It 
was 
given 
medicine 
so 
that 
it 
should 
become 
quiet 
and 
sleep." 


The 
physician 
in 
the 
dream 
had 
once 
treated 
her 
as 
a 
child 
when 
she 
had 
scarlet 
fever. 
In 
the 
dream 
he 
uses 
the 
words 
which 
she 
during 
her 
present 
illness 
had 
constantly 
heard 
from 
her 
relatives 
and 
from 
physicians. 
He 
gives 
her 
advice 
of 
a 
kind 
which 
amounts 
to 
nothing. 
These 
thoughts 
are 
aimed 
at 
me 
and 
express 
the 
conviction 
that 
all 
my 
measures 
will 
be 
useless. 
Of 
course 
this 
dream 
was 
dreamed 
during 
a 
night 
when 
she 
slept 
for 
the 
first 
time 
after 
a 
period 
of 
insomnia. 
As 
the 
patient, 
however, 
saw 
in 
this 
fact 
a 
partial 
success 
of 
the 
treatment 
she 
realized 
with 
strong 
aggression 
my 
measures 
too 
were 
useless. 
The 
hesitation 
in 
emphasizing 
the 
"largeness" 
of 
the 
child 
shows 
on 
what 
the 
thoughts 
of 
the 
dreamer 
are 
dwelling, 
on 
a 
small, 
a 
newborn 
child. 
The 
expression, 
"a 
child 
is 
brought" 
(supply: 
into 
the 
world), 
is 
taken 
from 
the 
idea 
of 
giving 
birth 
and 
coincides 
with 
this 
in 
the 
outlined 
representation 
of 
the 
dream. 
The 
powder 
which 
is 
given 
to 
the 
child 
is 
the 
sleeping 
powder 
of 
the 
patient 
in 
a 
former 
treatment, 
an 
indication 
that 
pains 
also 
belong 
to 
the 
patient, 
to 
giving 
birth. 
In 
other 
words 
the 
patient 
here 
expresses: 
I 
cannot 
sleep 
because 
I 
think 
of 
giving 
birth 
with 
its 
pains. 
Giving 
birth, 
pains, 
dying, 
in 
these 
she 
sees 
her 
fate 
and 
hence 
she 
thinks 
of 
dying 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
giving 
birth. 


The 
exaggerated 
security 
against 
childbirth 
is 
a 
change 
of 
form 
and 
intensity 
of 
her 
masculine 
protest. 
In 
order 
to 
secure 
herself 
against 
the 



feminine 
role 
she 
enters 
upon 
the 
neurotic 
deviation, 
fixes 
her 
thought 
upon 
an 
anticipatory 
tendency 
on 
childbirth 
and 
death 
as 
admonitions 
and 
prefers 
to 
become 
a 
child, 
to 
take 
a 
powder 
rather 
than 
to 
be 
cured 
psychotherapeutically. 
Because 
her 
cure 
signifies 
her 
fitting 
herself 
into 
the 
feminine 
role. 
Now 
the 
conflict 
is 
turned 
more 
acutely 
against 
the 
physician 
who 
wishes 
to 
cure 
her 
insomnia. 
She 
must 
remain 
superior 
to 
him, 
must 
permit 
him 
to 
talk 
absurdities, 
and 
dictate 
to 
him, 
that 
he 
should 
treat 
her 
with 
medicines 
as 
she 
had 
been 
treated 
when 
a 
child. 
The 
compulsory 
neurosis 
represents 
her 
reassuring 
philosophy 
of 
the 
vanity 
of 
everything 
under 
the 
sun. 


In 
our 
sort 
of 
neuropsychology 
one 
always 
gains 
the 
impression 
that 
the 
visible 
neurotic 
conduct 
is 
directed 
straight 
to 
the 
final 
purpose, 
to 
the 
fictitious 
goal, 
as 
if 
one 
were 
examining 
one 
of 
the 
intermediary 
pictures 
in 
a 
cinematographic 
film. 
The 
problem 
consists 
in 
recognizing 
this 
conduct, 
that 
is, 
the 
symptoms, 
predispositions, 
and 
traits 
of 
character, 
and 
to 
learn 
to 
comprehend 
their 
object. 
In 
every 
neurotic 
attitude 
the 
beginning 
and 
final 
purpose 
is 
concealed 
in 
its 
significance.* 


*Bergson 
justly 
emphasizes 
the 
same 
thing 
for 
every 
move 
of 
life. 
One 
who 
possesses 
sufficient 
insight 
and 
experience 
is 
able 
to 
see, 
in 
every 
psychic 
phenomenon 
the 
past, 
present, 
and 
future, 
but 
also 
the 
desired 
finale. 
Thus 
every 
psychic 
phenomenon 
and 
every 
trait 
of 
character, 
similarly 
to 
the 
inferior 
somatic 
organ, 
is 
to 
be 
looked 
upon 
as 
a 
symbol 
of 
life, 
as 
an 
attempt 
at 
an 
ascendancy 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest. 


These 
facts 
form 
the 
foundation 
of 
every 
individualistic 
psychological 
method 
and 
coincide 
with 
our 
other 
findings. 
Therefore 
in 
the 
analysis 
of 
a 
symptom 
or 
of 
a 
dream 
the 
feeling 
of 
effeminacy, 
of 
inferiority, 
of 
being 
" 
down," 
and 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
the 
fictitious 
manly 
goal, 
the 
feeling 
of 
being 
" 
above," 
will 
always 
be 
found 
indicated, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
an 
upwardly 
directed 
psychic 
attitude, 
in 
a 
hermaphroditic 
picture 
which 
is 
apperceived 
in 
a 
strongly 
antithetical 
manner, 
in 
neurotic, 
circuitous 
ways, 
which 
as 
such 
characterize 
the 
tendency 
to 
meet 
obstacles 
with 
expedients, 
or 
when 
analyzed 
reveal 
at 
one 
time 
the 
tendency 
upwards, 
at 
another 
the 
tendency 
downwards 
in 
the 
alterations 
and 
vacillations 
of 
the 
psychic 
phenomena. 
Frequently 
this 
" 
will 
to 
be 
up 
" 
is 
expressed 
in 
a 
strongly 
figurative 
manner, 



especially 
in 
dreams, 
but 
also 
in 
symptoms, 
and 
takes 
the 
symbolic 
form 
of 
a 
race, 
of 
soaring, 
of 
climbing 
mountains, 
of 
emerging 
from 
water, 
etc., 
while 
the 
"down" 
is 
represented 
by 
falling, 
in 
short 
by 
a 
motion 
downwards. 
Just 
as 
frequently 
the 
figure 
or 
the 
fact 
of 
the 
sexual 
act 
is 
symbolically 
employed 
for 
the 
same 
expression. 
I 
will 
here 
give 
an 
account 
of 
the 
dreams 
of 
a 
patient 
who 
had 
fears 
for 
his 
future 
as 
a 
man 
on 
account 
of 
his 
weakness 
and 
noticeably 
effeminate 
conduct. 
In 
a 
dream 
of 
his 
early 
childhood 
which 
for 
a 
long 
time 
filled 
him 
with 
fears 
he 
saw 
himself 
pursued 
by 
a 
bull. 
As 
a 
farmer's 
son 
he 
understood 
at 
that 
early 
age 
that 
the 
male 
pursuer 
represented 
a 
race 
for 
a 
cow, 
that 
is, 
for 
the 
patient 
himself. 
When 
he 
was 
to 
enter 
school 
he 
directed 
his 
steps 
straight 
to 
the 
girls' 
school 
and 
had 
to 
be 
taken 
to 
the 
boys' 
school 
by 
force. 
He 
unconsciously 
regarded 
his 
life 
as 
a 
race, 
for 
which 
he 
constantly 
found 
preparations. 
When 
he 
was 
courting 
a 
girl 
his 
friend 
cut 
him 
out. 
When 
he 
contemplated 
marriage, 
he 
became 
afraid 
of 
the 
superiority 
of 
his 
wife, 
fell 
into 
the 
habit 
of 
compulsory 
masturbation, 
suffered 
from 
frequent 
pollutions, 
and 
fell 
victim 
to 
a 
tremor, 
which 
hindered 
his 
work 
and 
advancement 
in 
office. 
Naturally 
he 
set 
up 
the 
condition 
that 
he 
would 
only 
marry 
when 
he 
was 
cured, 
a 
thought 
which 
seemed 
to 
be 
wise 
and 
justified, 
but 
which 
permitted 
the 
patient 
to 
operate 
secretly 
against 
his 
marriage 
as 
behind 
a 
veil 
because 
he 
feared 
therefrom 
a 
reduction 
of 
his 
ego-
consciousness. 
The 
tremor 
represented 
to 
him 
the 
premonitions 
of 
a 
paralysis 
which 
he 
feared 
on 
account 
of 
his 
excessive 
masturbation. 
After 
he 
had 
secured 
himself 
in 
this 
manner 
he 
still 
felt 
the 
need 
of 
confirmation 
of 
his 
incurability 
and 
went 
weeping 
to 
physicians. 
Our 
conversation 
revealed 
to 
me 
the 
picture 
of 
a 
restless, 
ambitious 
individual 
who 
wished 
constantly 
to 
detract 
from 
others, 
but 
who 
recoiled 
in 
fear 
from 
a 
serious 
decision. 
Amorous 
relations 
were 
also 
with 
him 
principally 
a 
means 
of 
assuring 
himself 
of 
his 
superior 
manliness. 
No 
matter 
how 
eagerly 
he 
courted 
a 
girl, 
the 
moment 
she 
met 
his 
addresses, 
she 
lost 
all 
charm 
for 
him. 
Besides 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
approached 
an 
engagement 
he 
entered 
into 
other 
relations 
without 
prospect, 
or 
gave 
them 
a 
prospectless 
form 
and 
thus 
ran 
after 
his 
rejections 
in 
order 
to 
be 
able 
through 
the 
feeling 
of 
his 
lack 
of 
influence 
even 
vis-a-vis 
his 
future 
bride, 
to 
be 
able 
to 
regard 
himself 
as 
inferior. 
From 
this 
he 
constantly 
regained 
the 
impulse 
to 
work 
secretly 
against 
the 
apparently 
desired 
marriage. 
One 
of 
his 
dreams 
is 
as 
follows: 



"I 
was 
with 
my 
old 
friend 
and 
was 
speaking 
with 
him 
about 
a, 
mutual 
friend. 
He 
said, 
'Of 
what 
use 
is 
his 
money 
to 
him, 
he 
has 
learned 
nothing?'” 


The 
old 
friend, 
who 
had 
cut 
our 
patient 
out 
in 
the 
courtship 
of 
a 
girl, 
had 
failed 
in 
the 
Technical 
school 
and 
had 
given 
up 
study. 
The 
patient 
was 
superior 
to 
him 
for 
he 
had 
finished 
the 
course. 
He 
embraced 
the 
sublime 
principle, 
" 
Knowledge 
is 
more 
than 
money," 
especially 
as 
this 
profession 
served 
his 
fiction 
to 
be 
"above" 
and 
comforted 
him. 
The 
mutual 
acquaintance 
is 
placed 
here 
instead 
of 
the 
rich 
girl 
who 
was 
courted 
by 
both. 
The 
contest 
begins 
anew. 
Our 
patient 
is 
declared 
victor 
by 
his 
rival. 


A 
second 
dream 
which 
occurred 
the 
same 
night 
makes 
this 
clearer. 
The 
patient 
dreamed: 


"As 
if 
I 
had 
caused 
the 
fall 
of 
a 
girl 
of 
lower 
standing 
and 
had 
dishonored 
her." 


The 
fiction 
of 
this 
dream 
says 
a 
shade 
more 
clearly 
that 
he 
is 
above." 
The 
girl 
who 
was 
formerly 
courted 
is 
thus 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
patient 
brought 
down, 
made 
poor, 
and 
recognizes 
him 
as 
her 
master. 


I 
will 
here 
briefly 
mention 
that 
the 
occurrence 
of 
several 
dreams 
in 
a 
night 
signifies 
that 
various 
attempts 
at 
preliminary 
arrangements 
of 
tentative 
solutions 
of 
a 
problem 
are 
undertaken. 
It 
becomes 
regularly 
apparent 
that 
a 
single 
way 
is 
not 
sufficient 
for 
the 
guiding, 
egoistic 
idea 
of 
caution, 
a 
fact 
which 
is 
easily 
comprehended 
in 
the 
case 
of 
neurotics. 
The 
dream 
then, 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
more 
intensive 
craving 
for 
security 
becomes 
more 
abstract, 
more 
figurative, 
and 
one 
thus 
obtains 
in 
interpreting 
all 
the 
dreams 
of 
a 
night 
several 
psychic 
attitudes, 
from 
the 
comparison 
of 
which 
the 
dynamic 
of 
the 
neurosis 
becomes 
much 
clearer. 
In 
the 
above 
cited 
case 
the 
rival 
surrenders 
and 
the 
wealth 
of 
the 
girl 
her 
power 
is 
deprived 
of 
worth 
for 
him. 
The 
second 
dream 
deprives 
the 
girl 
also 
of 
power 
and 
places 
her 
in 
the 
position 
a 
woman 
that 
is 
"under" 
occupies, 
and 
this 
is 
done 
in 
the 
most 
far-
fetched 
and 
abstract 
manner, 
so 
that 
nothing 
personal 
is 
left 
to 
the 
girl 
under 
consideration 
except 
her 
subordinate 
position. 
The 
patient 
also 
expresses 
the 
thought 
that 
only 
an 
uneducated 
girl 
from 
the 
country 
will 
serve 
his 
purpose, 
as 
he 
can 
always 
remain 
her 
master. 
The 
girl 
whom 
he 
wishes 
to 
make 
his 
wife 
frightens 
him 
because 
of 
her 
intelligence. 
(*Another 
dream 
of 
the 
same 
night 
may 
have 
dealt 
with 
the 
violation 
of 
a 
girl.) 



This 
is 
the 
tendency 
of 
many 
neurotics, 
which 
causes 
them 
always 
to 
choose 
below 
their 
social 
level, 
and 
thus 
thoughts 
and 
facts 
come 
to 
pass 
such 
as 
choosing 
a 
prostitute 
or 
a 
little 
girl 
for 
love 
and 
marriage, 
necrophilic 
tendencies, 
etc. 
In 
all 
similar 
cases 
the 
tendency 
to 
detract 
from 
the 
partner 
is 
perceptible, 
which 
seeks 
to 
degrade 
the 
wife 
by 
the 
construction 
of 
mistrust, 
jealousy, 
tyranny, 
ethical 
principles 
and 
requirements. 


A 
further 
idea 
shown 
in 
a 
dream 
represents 
a 
race 
graphically: 


" 
I 
was 
riding 
in 
a 
railway 
car 
and 
looked 
out 
of 
the 
window 
to 
see 
if 
the 
dog 
was 
still 
running 
with 
the 
train. 
I 
thought 
that 
he 
had 
run 
himself 
to 
death, 
had 
fallen 
under 
the 
wheels. 
I 
felt 
sorry 
for 
him. 
Then 
the 
idea 
struck 
me 
that 
I 
had 
another 
dog, 
but 
a 
clumsy 
one." 


He 
had 
often 
ridden 
bicycle 
races 
with 
his 
old 
friend 
and 
rival 
and 
was 
usually 
left 
behind. 
Now 
as 
his 
friend 
occupies 
a 
position 
socially 
inferior 
to 
him, 
his 
friend 
" 
can 
run 
after 
him," 
as 
one 
says 
in 
Vienna 
when 
a 
person 
gives 
himself 
airs. 
The 
metamorphosis 
into 
a 
dog 
is 
a 
product 
of 
the 
tendency 
to 
derogation 
and 
is 
quite 
frequently 
met 
with. 
In 
a 
case 
of 
dementia 
precox 
I 
observed 
that 
the 
patient 
gave 
all 
dogs 
the 
names 
of 
women 
of 
importance. 
The 
dog 
also 
represented 
his 
future 
bride 
who 
also 
brought 
his 
superiority 
into 
question. 
Her 
death, 
moreover, 
would 
free 
him 
of 
his 
fear, 
just 
as 
he 
would 
also 
be 
free 
if 
she 
should 
listen 
to 
another 
suitor, 
as 
his 
suspicion 
often 
whispered 
to 
him 
was 
the 
case. 
" 
If 
she 
should 
fall 
under 
the 
wheels." 
" 
If 
this 
should 
occur, 
it 
would 
cause 
him 
sorrow." 
In 
the 
dream 
he 
regards 
this 
as 
having 
already 
happened 
and 
anticipates 
his 
sorrow. 
The 
" 
clumsy 
dog 
" 
is 
a 
girl 
who 
about 
this 
time 
had 
disgusted 
him 
by 
meeting 
his 
advances 
and 
for 
whom 
he 
no 
longer 
cared. 


His 
dislike 
for 
those 
above 
him 
is 
boundless 
and 
deep-seated. 
One 
night 
he 
dreamed: 


" 
Our 
singing 
society 
gave 
a 
concert. 
The 
director's 
place 
was 
empty." 


The 
society 
to 
which 
he 
belonged 
was 
on 
one 
occasion 
obliged 
to 
sing 
without 
a 
director 
because 
the 
latter 
had 
missed 
the 
1 
train. 
The 
situation 
appeared 
to 
him 
better 
than 
any 
other. 
" 
We 
need 
no 
director," 
he 
thought. 
This 
is 
his 
usual 
attitude 
in 
all 
situations 
in 
which 
he 
himself 
is 
not 
the 
director. 


The 
impulse 
to 
masturbation 
in 
male 
neurotics 
corresponds 
in 
female 
neurotics 
to 
the 
tendency 
to 
avoid 
a 
decision 
and 
thereby 
to 
remain 
"up." 
In 



the 
masturbation 
phantasies 
of 
girls 
the 
woman 
is 
often 
found 
to 
take 
the 
role 
of 
a 
man. 
Also 
the 
position 
which 
is 
taken 
therein 
is 
at 
times 
that 
of 
the 
man. 
In 
men 
masturbation 
serves, 
first, 
as 
proof 
that 
one 
can 
live 
alone, 
second, 
as 
a 
protection 
against 
and 
hindrance 
to 
sexual 
relations 
which 
on 
account 
of 
the 
superiority 
of 
the 
wife 
are 
feared 
and 
hence 
arises 
from 
the 
craving 
for 
security. 
If 
the 
situation 
necessitates 
stronger 
securities, 
impotence 
or 
the 
developed 
neurosis 
makes 
its 
appearance, 
not 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
renunciation 
of 
masturbation, 
but 
as 
a 
reenforced 
security. 
The 
masturbation 
phantasies 
in 
neurotics 
have 
often 
a 
masochistic 
or 
sadistic 
feature, 
according 
to 
the 
phase 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest 
which 
they 
aim 
to 
represent. 


Among 
the 
preparatory 
actions 
and 
neurotic 
expedients 
which 
are 
intended 
to 
serve 
to 
secure 
the 
position 
of 
being 
"up," 
curiosity, 
impulse 
to 
investigation, 
the 
desire 
to 
see 
everything, 
the 
" 
voyeur 
" 
impulse 
mentioned 
by 
writers 
occupies 
a 
prominent 
place. 
These 
impulses 
are 
always 
a 
proof 
of 
a 
primary 
uncertainty 
for 
the 
compensation 
of 
which 
the 
guiding 
lines 
of 
investigation 
are 
brought 
in. 
They 
serve 
especially 
in 
developed 
neuroses 
secondarily 
the 
purposes 
of 
dilatoriness 
to 
avoid 
a 
plan 
and 
a 
decision 
and 
are 
in 
life, 
especially 
in 
the 
erotic, 
very 
often 
changed 
from 
a 
means 
to 
an 
end 
on 
which 
all 
the 
psychic 
activities 
are 
based. 
Investigation, 
the 
search 
for 
truth, 
the 
wish 
to 
understand 
everything, 
the 
well-known 
neurotic 
thoroughness, 
these 
are 
then 
the 
traits 
which 
the 
ego-consciousness 
erects 
and 
must 
elevate 
or 
protect. 



CHAPTER 
VII 
PUNCTUALITY, 
THE 
WILL 
TO 
BE 
FIRST, 
HOMOSEXUALITY 
AND 
PERVERSION 
AS 
A 
SYMBOL, 
MODESTY 
AND 
EXHIBITIONISM, 
CONSTANCY 
AND 
INCONSTANCY, 
JEALOUSY 


A 
phenomenon 
often 
noted 
in 
neurotics 
is 
their 
attitude 
towards 
the 
question 
of 
punctuality. 
In 
accordance 
with 
our 
analysis 
of 
neurotic 
pedantry 
the 
expectation 
is 
justified 
that 
a 
large 
number 
of 
punctual 
individuals 
will 
be 
found 
among 
neurotics. 
This 
is 
in 
fact 
the 
case. 
But 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
perceive 
that 
these 
patients 
play 
with 
the 
thought, 
how 
would 
it 
be 
if 
they 
should 
let 
others 
wait, 
a 
train 
of 
thought 
which 
indicates 
their 
opposition 
to 
others. 
There 
always 
remains 
in 
this 
attitude 
of 
punctuality 
so 
much 
of 
aggression 
that 
these 
patients 
exact 
the 
greatest 
punctuality 
from 
everybody 
without 
exception 
and 
in 
consequence 
are 
often 
in 
a 
position 
to 
put 
their 
expedients 
and 
neurotic 
preparedness 
to 
attacks 
into 
operation 
at 
the 
tardiness 
of 
others. 
In 
other 
cases 
it 
is 
found 
that 
pride 
compels 
them 
to 
come 
late 
regularly, 
and 
when 
others 
are 
obliged 
to 
wait 
and 
a 
flood 
of 
excuses 
is 
offered, 
this 
is 
felt 
as 
an 
enhancement 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness. 
This 
tardiness 
is 
well 
fitted 
to 
form 
a 
substitute 
for 
the 
fear 
of 
decisions. 
The 
social 
fitness 
is 
greatly 
menaced 
and 
professional 
duties 
as 
well 
as 
relations 
with 
friends 
and 
loved 
ones 
are 
soon 
eliminated. 
Admonitions 
are 
entirely 
fruitless, 
because 
the 
obstinate 
attitude 
is 
only 
confirmed 
by 
them. 
The 
neurotic 
is 
able 
to 
master 
the 
situation 
by 
his 
eternal 
tardiness 
and 
thus 
place 
before 
his 
relatives 
an 
insoluble 
problem. 
The 
choice 
of 
this 
line 
of 
character 
often 
follows 
in 
conformity 
with 
an 
analogy: 
" 
as 
I 
came 
into 
the 
world 
too 
late 
among 
my 
brothers 
and 
sisters," 
" 
because 
I 
did 
not 
arrive 
later 
like 
my 
younger 
brother 
or 
sister." 
It 
may 
be 
seen 
from 
this 
how, 
by 
this 
neurotic 
arrangement 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
and 
the 
order 
of 
birth 
of 
the 
brothers 
and 
sisters 
a 
broad 
and 
permanent 
basis 
of 
operation 
for 
the 
battle 
for 
superiority 
is 
gained 
Patients 
who 
always 
come 
too 
early 
show 
also 
at 
other 
times 
the 
trait 
of 
impatience. 
Through 
a 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
they 
are 
constantly 
in 
fear 
of 



other 
new 
losses 
and 
reassure 
themselves 
by 
believing 
in 
their 
" 
unlucky 
star." 
In 
cases 
of 
these 
neurotics, 
too, 
the 
elder 
brother 
is 
often 
found 
as 
an 
opponent 
with 
whom 
they 
are 
engaged, 
as 
it 
were, 
in 
a 
race, 
an 
analogical 
fiction, 
but 
by 
no 
manner 
of 
means 
the 
casual 
factor 
of 
their 
conduct. 


Fictive 
rights 
of 
primogeniture 
become 
often 
for 
younger 
children 
the 
impetus 
for 
the 
enhancement 
of 
the 
egoistic 
idea, 
and 
in 
my 
experience 
second 
and 
later 
children 
show 
greater 
tendency 
to 
neuroses 
and 
psychoses, 
and 
certainly 
show 
greater 
ambition. 
(*Compare 
Frischauf, 
" 
The 
Psychology 
of 
the 
Younger 
Brother," 
B. 
Reinhardt, 
Munich 
(in 
preparation).) 


In 
their 
neurotic 
conduct 
the 
figurative 
analogy 
of 
the 
story 
of 
Jacob 
and 
Esau 
comes 
to 
light, 
proving 
that 
the 
wish 
to 
be 
first 
is 
at 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
situation. 
Their 
preparations 
and 
predispositions 
will 
always 
have 
as 
object 
to 
permit 
no 
one 
to 
have 
merit, 
to 
transform 
every 
relation 
by 
means 
of 
love 
and 
hate 
so 
that 
their 
superiority 
shall 
become 
apparent. 
The 
tendency 
to 
derogation 
exceeds 
all 
bounds. 
The 
individual 
of 
this 
type 
does 
not 
hesitate 
at 
harming 
himself 
if 
he 
can 
only 
harm 
others 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
In 
the 
formal 
change 
of 
the 
guiding 
line 
a 
view 
such 
as 
Caesar 
took 
is 
often 
arrived 
at, 
" 
Better 
first 
in 
a 
village 
than 
second 
in 
Rome," 
better 
to 
play 
the 
leading 
role 
with 
the 
mother 
or 
father 
than 
to 
draw 
an 
unknown 
lottery 
ticket 
in 
marriage, 
etc. 
Hatred 
is 
frequently 
felt 
for 
superiors, 
teachers 
and 
physicians. 
They 
are 
usually 
kill-joys 
in 
social 
gatherings, 
as 
soon 
as 
their 
superiority 
is 
not 
recognized, 
and 
they 
often 
break 
off 
every 
relation 
of 
friendship 
and 
love 
after 
a 
short 
time, 
if 
the 
other 
parties 
to 
these 
relationships 
do 
not 
acknowledge 
themselves 
inferior. 
Very 
often 
their 
conduct 
is 
brusque 
and 
inimical 
from 
the 
start, 
because 
they 
are 
already 
at 
strife 
before 
the 
other 
person 
suspects 
it. 
They 
cannot 
endure 
to 
have 
any 
one 
stand 
or 
walk 
before 
them, 
and 
avoid 
every 
school 
examination, 
because 
the 
superiority 
of 
the 
person 
conducting 
the 
examination 
is 
unendurable 
to 
them. 
That 
all 
these 
phenomena 
may 
finally 
be 
directed 
against 
the 
family 
environment, 
and 
take 
the 
form 
of 
the 
view 
that 
the 
family 
must 
care 
for 
the 
patient 
is 
a 
further 
step 
towards 
the 
proof 
of 
the 
significance 
and 
importance 
of 
the 
egoistic 
idea 
for 
the 
patient. 
At 
times 
they 
operate 
with 
their 
neuroses 
as 
others 
carry 
on 
fortune 
hunting. 


Frequently 
the 
wish 
to 
be 
first, 
with 
the 
wife, 
is 
hidden 
in 
the 
neurotic 



efforts 
of 
a 
male 
patient 
and 
he 
hunts 
through 
her 
previous 
life 
with 
jealousy 
and 
suspicion 
and 
constantly 
believes 
himself 
deceived, 
or 
he 
eagerly 
keeps 
watch 
lest 
his 
wife 
should 
prefer 
another, 
the 
fear 
of 
the 
wife 
as 
the 
expression 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
incomplete 
manliness. 
The 
neurotic 
only 
wants 
certainty 
in 
regard 
to 
this 
point 
and 
even 
goes 
so 
far 
as 
to 
put 
the 
wife 
to 
all 
sorts 
of 
tests. 
In 
the 
burning 
jealousy 
which 
from 
this 
point 
on 
possesses 
the 
neurotic 
the 
expedients 
by 
which 
the 
wife 
is 
degraded 
follow 
of 
themselves 
and 
the 
egoistic 
feeling 
of 
the 
jealous 
neurotic 
is 
thereby 
so 
greatly 
elevated 
that 
he 
is 
often 
not 
in 
a 
condition 
to 
separate 
from 
the 
justly 
or 
unjustly 
accused 
person. 
This 
latter 
fact 
which 
is 
often 
met 
with 
is 
wholly 
dependent 
on 
the 
masculine 
guiding 
idea 
of 
the 
patient. 
He 
cannot 
endure 
the 
thought 
that 
one 
could 
abandon 
him 
and 
reconstructs 
the 
facts 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
he 
is 
hindered, 
by 
love, 
by 
pity, 
by 
fear 
of 
misfortune 
which 
might 
come 
to 
wife 
or 
children 
from 
taking 
the 
final 
step. 


Perhaps 
the 
striving 
to 
be 
'first, 
to 
be 
master 
of 
all, 
is 
constructed 
on 
a 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
based 
with 
justification 
or 
without 
it 
on 
smallness 
of 
stature 
or 
of 
the 
genital 
organs. 
In 
the 
developed 
neurosis 
the 
patient 
through 
the 
arrangement 
of 
a 
neurotic 
symptom 
fails 
at 
a 
distance 
from 
the 
opportunity 
in 
which 
he 
was 
to 
have 
given 
proof. 
As 
a 
frequent 
symptom 
of 
this 
sort 
I 
was 
able 
to 
observe 
compulsory 
blushing. 


In 
a 
less 
marked 
degree 
the 
tendency 
to 
be 
first 
is 
a 
universal 
human 
characteristic 
and 
concomitant 
therewith 
is 
regularly 
found 
an 
inclination 
to 
conflict 
in 
all 
human 
beings. 
The 
competitive 
race 
begins 
even 
in 
earliest 
childhood 
and 
creates 
its 
psychic 
organs 
and 
reassuring 
traits 
of 
character. 
Thus 
one 
often 
finds 
in 
children 
the 
trait 
of 
character 
that 
they 
wish 
to 
be 
the 
first 
to 
eat 
or 
drink 
or 
that 
they 
like 
to 
run 
ahead 
in 
order 
to 
reach 
a 
place 
before 
others. 
Not 
rarely 
at 
five 
years 
of 
age 
they 
carry 
on 
the 
play 
of 
trying 
to 
outrun 
every 
wagon 
and 
many 
child's 
games 
owe 
their 
origin 
to 
the 
idea 
of 
competitive 
races. 
Many 
persons 
preserve 
this 
inclination 
throughout 
their 
entire 
life 
in 
the 
form 
of 
an 
unconscious 
gesture, 
always 
wish 
to 
walk 
at 
the 
head 
in 
a 
company 
or 
hasten 
their 
steps 
when 
any 
one 
attempts 
to 
pass 
them 
on 
the 
street. 
In 
a 
transferred 
sense 
this 
tendency 
makes 
itself 
noticeable 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
those 
who 
possess 
it 
are 
given 
to 
hero-worship 
whereby 
the 
more 
profound 
sense 
comes 
to 
light 
of 
being 
himself, 
also 
Heros, 
Achilles, 
Alexander, 
Hannibal, 
Caesar, 
Napoleon 
or 
Archimedes, 
and 
thus 
betraying 
at 



the 
same 
time 
the 
guiding 
fiction 
and 
the 
original 
feeling 
of 
inferiority. 
The 
likeness 
to 
God 
also 
reveals 
itself 
as 
an 
active 
fiction 
and 
is 
manifested 
at 
times 
in 
fairy 
tales, 
in 
phantasy, 
and 
in 
the 
psychoses. 
We 
have 
emphasized 
that 
in 
this 
state 
of 
the 
predispositions 
and 
traits 
of 
character 
all 
bonds 
of 
friendship 
and 
love 
are 
threatened 
and 
when 
the 
stronger 
uncertainty 
requires 
it, 
forces 
the 
patient 
into 
doubt, 
makes 
him 
represent 
scarecrows 
or 
ideal 
forms 
by 
means 
of 
which 
he 
secures 
himself 
permanently 
from 
reality. 
A 
caricature 
of 
Caesar, 
he 
now 
seeks 
his 
mother, 
the 
small 
city, 
the 
lower 
relations, 
wanders 
at 
times 
restlessly 
from 
one 
place 
of 
residence 
to 
another 
as 
if 
the 
external 
relations 
were 
the 
cause 
of 
his 
dissatisfaction. 
In 
this 
developed 
neurosis 
the 
sexual 
appetite 
is 
frequently 
directed 
to 
children, 
persons 
of 
low 
station, 
maids; 
homosexuality, 
perverse 
inclinations 
or 
inclinations 
to 
masturbation 
are 
constructed 
and 
adhered 
to 
because 
the 
patient 
hopes 
thus 
more 
easily 
to 
master 
the 
situation. 
For 
the 
fear 
of 
a 
woman 
hinders 
a 
natural 
sexual 
relation 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
that 
the 
neurotic 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
the 
defeat 
of 
which 
he 
stands 
in 
fear, 
arrives 
at 
the 
expedient 
of 
ejaculatio 
precox, 
of 
pollutions, 
and 
of 
impotence. 


The 
circumstances 
are 
similar 
in 
neurotic 
women 
of 
this 
type, 
in 
whom 
frequently 
rivalry 
in 
society 
with 
friends 
in 
the 
large 
city, 
with 
sisters, 
with 
a 
daughter 
and 
a 
daughter-in-law 
is 
secretly 
brewing, 
and 
forces 
to 
neurotic 
securities 
and 
this 
causes 
illness. 
In 
male 
neurotics 
the 
social 
position 
leads 
to 
the 
development 
of 
a 
neurosis 
as 
soon 
as 
precedence 
in 
society, 
in 
science 
or 
in 
amusement 
is 
called 
into 
question 
and 
contested. 


Where 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
of 
the 
younger 
child 
forms 
the 
fictitious 
guiding 
ideal 
according 
to 
the 
pattern 
of 
the 
first 
born 
or 
the 
earliest 
born 
the 
most 
varied 
real 
and 
apparent 
advantages 
incite 
the 
desire 
and 
envy 
of 
the 
younger 
child. 
Nearly 
always 
teachers 
will 
notice 
traits 
such 
as 
envy 
of 
the 
size 
of 
the 
older 
brother, 
of 
his 
growth 
of 
hair, 
of 
the 
size 
of 
his 
genital 
organs. 
That 
fictitious 
values 
are 
thereto 
given 
I 
was 
able 
to 
infer 
from 
the 
psychotherapeutic 
treatment 
of 
two 
brothers, 
of 
whom 
each 
had 
envied 
the 
other 
in 
childhood 
on 
account 
of 
the 
development 
of 
the 
genital 
organs. 
In 
the 
same 
manner 
the 
real 
preference 
for 
the 
older 
brother 
or 
such 
as 
arises 
naturally 
from 
the 
situation 
becomes 
the 
point 
of 
attack. 
The 
fact 
that 
he 
is 
taken 
to 
the 
theatre 
and 
on 
journeys, 
that 
he 
has 
more 
experience 
in 
the 
sexual 
problem, 
is 
sexually 
active, 
that 
he 
is 
preferred 
by 
girls 
and 
by 
the 



servants 
may 
fill 
the 
younger 
child, 
where 
there 
is 
a 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
with 
the 
most 
profound 
bitterness. 
For 
this 
melancholy, 
at 
times 
a 
hopeless 
emotional 
condition, 
arose 
at 
a 
very 
early 
age 
in 
our 
patient 
and 
attained 
an 
incredible 
degree. 
At 
times 
there 
seems 
no 
prospect 
of 
victory 
in 
the 
competition. 
His 
manly 
tendency 
turns 
around 
toward 
the 
pseudomasochistic 
side* 
and 
seeks 
now 
to 
attain 
the 
manly 
goal 
by 
emphasizing 
the 
feelings 
of 
sickness 
and 
weakness, 
by 
yielding 
and 
submitting 
to 
an 
extreme 
degree 
in 
the 
hope 
of 
thus 
winning 
the 
protection 
of 
parents 
and 
those 
with 
more 
strength 
and 
to 
gain 
in 
this 
manner 
the 
desired 
security 
in 
life. 


* 
According 
to 
our 
conception, 
every 
perversion 
arid 
inversion 
is 
& 
simile, 
a 
symbol. 
For 
pseudomasochism 
see 
" 
The 
Psychic 
Treatment 
of 
Trigeminal 
Neuralgia," 
1. 
c. 
I 
have 
seen 
cases 
where 
protracted 
catarrh 
in 
childhood 
(Czerny's 
exudative 
diathesis) 
was 
sustained 
by 
a 
combination 
of 
the 
clearing 
of 
the 
throat 
and 
panting 
and 
led 
to 
sneezing 
fits 
and 
asthma 
(see 
Strumpell's 
Asthma-theory) 
and 
in 
connection 
with 
which 
at 
the 
same 
time 
fictions 
of 
pregnancy 
and 
castration 
and 
exaggerated 
anal 
sensitiveness 
effected 
a 
homosexual 
factor 
which 
was 
to 
be 
understood 
symbolically. 
In 
one 
of 
these 
cases 
the 
fictitious 
feminine 
presentation 
went 
so 
far 
that 
the 
patient 
came 
to 
identify 
himself 
with 
his 
younger 
sister 
by 
a 
change 
of 
form 
of 
the 
guiding 
line. 
And 
as 
the 
mother 
showed 
a 
noticeable 
inclination 
always 
to 
be 
late, 
he 
took 
this 
fact 
and 
the 
wish 
that 
he 
had 
been 
born 
later 
in 
place 
of 
his 
younger 
sister 
as 
a 
guiding 
motive 
always 
to 
arrive 
late 
wherever 
he 
went, 
even 
when 
he 
came 
to 
me 
for 
treatment, 
a 
phenomenon 
which 
did 
not 
vanish 
when 
it 
was 
revealed, 
but 
only 
after 
a 
cure 
had 
been 
effected. 
In 
these 
feminine 
presentations 
the 
masculine 
protest 
is 
striven 
after 
by 
a 
circuitous 
route, 
by 
following 
the 
feminine 
guiding 
line 
and 
is 
regularly 
accompanied 
by 
day 
dreams, 
sensitiveness, 
disputatiousness, 
discontent, 
and 
is 
also 
as 
a 
rule 
forced 
into 
side 
paths 
by 
fear 
of 
tests, 
of 
decisions, 
of 
the 
sexual 
partner, 
so 
that 
perverse 
tendencies, 
onanism 
and 
pollutions 
are 
frequently 
found. 
The 
initial 
phenomena 
of 
inferiority 
of 
organs 
may 
disappear 
or 
only 
remain 
as 
a 
trace. 
Smallness 
and 
anomalies 
of 
the 
exterior 
genital 
organs 
may 
sometimes 
be 
discovered, 
but 
as 
a 
rule 
only 
reveal 
themselves 
psychically 
in 
the 
fear 
of 
not 
being 
able 
to 
dominate 
the 
sexual 
partner. 
This 
emotional 
condition 
often 



leads 
to 
jealousy, 
tendency 
to 
torment 
and 
sadistic 
inclinations, 
by 
which 
it 
is 
sought 
to 
establish 
the 
proof 
of 
potency 
and 
of 
being 
loved. 


Often 
the 
pride 
of 
the 
patient 
is 
so 
great 
that 
he 
is 
himself 
not 
conscious 
of 
his 
jealousy. 
According 
to 
our 
experience 
the 
solution 
of 
this 
psychic 
constellation 
is 
that 
the 
masculine 
protest 
in 
addition 
to 
other 
effects 
has 
also 
the 
effect 
of 
repressing 
jealousy 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
a 
diminution 
of 
personal 
worth. 
The 
consequence 
of 
this 
repression 
is 
not 
great, 
at 
most 
that 
the 
patient 
finds 
himself 
in 
ambiguous 
situations. 
Generally 
he 
acts 
as 
if 
he 
were 
jealous 
and 
often 
so 
plainly 
that 
every 
one 
else 
except 
the 
patient 
knows 
it. 
At 
times, 
however, 
the 
jealousy 
is 
masked 
by 
depression, 
headache, 
refuge 
in 
solitude, 
etc. 


I 
will 
give 
yet 
another 
dream 
of 
a 
patient 
who 
came 
under 
my 
treatment 
because 
of 
depression 
and 
anxiety 
in 
society, 
because 
in 
the 
partial 
interpretations 
undertaken 
by 
the 
patient 
this 
dream 
reveals 
many 
of 
the 
points 
just 
described 
of 
the 
competition 
of 
a 
neurotic 
with 
his 
older 
brother: 


"It 
seemed 
to 
me 
that 
I 
had 
made 
a 
bet 
with 
my 
brother 
Joseph 
to 
beat 
him 
to 
a 
certain 
place 
which 
was 
not 
distinguishable 
in 
the 
dream. 


"I 
saw 
myself 
now 
suddenly 
in 
a 
little 
three-wheeled 
automobile 
on 
the 
road, 
and 
tried 
to 
direct 
the 
automobile 
as 
well 
as 
possible 
by 
means 
of 
a 
small 
apparatus 
similar 
to 
a 
key 
which 
I 
was 
only 
able 
to 
take 
between 
the 
thumb 
and 
index 
finger. 
I 
rode 
-very 
insecurely 
and 
felt 
uncomfortable. 
I 
got 
into 
by-paths 
on 
which 
I 
could 
go 
no 
farther. 
The 
people 
whom 
I 
met 
were 
astonished 
and 
laughed. 
I 
was 
forced 
to 
take 
the 
auto 
on 
my 
back 
and 
turn 
back 
to 
the 
road. 
There 
I 
rode 
farther 
in 
the 
same 
manner. 


"Suddenly 
I 
saw 
myself 
with 
my 
three-wheeled 
vehicle 
in 
the 
room 
of 
an 
inn 
which 
was 
well 
known 
to 
me 
and 
was 
situated 
on 
a 
mountain 
near 
my 
native 
place. 
I 
now 
shoved 
my 
automobile 
into 
a 
corner 
and 
troubled 
myself 
no 
more 
about 
it. 
My 
brother 
had 
arrived 
before 
me 
at 
the 
same 
inn 
and 
alongside 
him 
there 
was 
sitting 
a 
well-known 
family 
who 
were 
deeply 
in 
debt, 
consisting 
of 
Mr. 
and 
Mrs. 
M 
and 
their 
two 
daughters. 
My 
brother 
and 
I 
paid 
no 
attention 
to 
them. 
Then 
Mr. 
M 
came 
to 
our 
table, 
spoke 
to 
us, 
and 
finally 
we 
went 
to 
their 
table 
which, 
however, 
was 
unpleasant 
to 
me. 


"The 
thought 
of 
a 
bet 
came 
up 
in 
the 
course 
of 
a 
conversation 
with 
my 
brother. 
He 
advised 
me 
not 
to 
bind 
myself 
at 
an 
early 
age 
to 
the 
flighty 
girl 
that 
I 
wished 
to 
marry 
and 
told 
me 
from 
his 
own 
experiences 
what 
ill 
results 



this 
can 
have 
to 
a 
man 
striving 
for 
success. 
I 
comprehended 
this 
and 
promised 
to 
act 
according 
to 
his 
advice. 
He 
took 
little 
stock 
of 
such 
promises. 
That 
incited 
me 
to 
a 
bet. 
In 
early 
years 
before 
I 
knew 
what 
lay 
buried 
in 
the 
depths 
of 
his 
nature 
he 
seemed 
to 
be 
a 
model 
to 
me 
and 
I 
strove 
to 
become 
like 
him 
in 
character, 
mode 
of 
thought, 
and 
bearing. 
Now 
I 
see, 
that 
I 
must 
not 
copy 
him 
in 
many 
things, 
if 
I 
do 
not 
wish 
to 
follow 
in 
his 
footsteps. 


"It 
is 
easier 
to 
reach 
one's 
destination 
with 
an 
automobile 
than 
on 
foot. 
This 
auto, 
however, 
obviously 
represented 
the 
wife, 
to 
whom 
I 
had 
tied 
myself. 
A 
three-wheeled 
auto 
is 
less 
perfect 
than 
a 
four-wheeled 
one, 
the 
former 
lacks 
something. 
Thus 
it 
is 
with 
a 
woman. 
Man 
is 
perfect. 
For 
that 
reason 
the 
antithesis, 
the 
small 
handle. 
In 
my 
earliest 
youth 
I 
was 
constantly 
seeking 
after 
something 
in 
girls. 
There 
was 
something 
I 
could 
not 
understand 
about 
them. 
Frequently 
we 
walked 
under 
a 
bridge 
and 
yet 
we 
did 
not 
know 
what 
we 
expected 
to 
see 
through 
the 
cracks 
above. 
At 
that 
time 
I 
was 
perhaps 
five 
years 
old 
I 
had 
not 
the 
slightest 
idea 
of 
sexual 
procedures 
(' 
uncertainty 
') 
and 
had 
also 
come 
upon 
no 
sexual 
aberration. 
I 
can, 
however, 
say 
that 
even 
at 
that 
time 
something 
drew 
me 
to 
girls, 
' 
the 
small 
handle 
on 
the 
auto' 
indicated 
at 
the 
same 
time 
that 
I 
possessed 
a 
too 
small 
penis 
or 
none 
at 
all, 
for 
which 
reason 
the 
girl 
must 
be 
superior 
to 
me. 


"I 
came 
into 
by-paths 
with 
my 
car, 
that 
is, 
through 
the 
woman, 
through 
which 
I 
could 
not 
pass 
and 
which 
brought 
me 
no 
nearer 
to 
the 
goal 
which 
I 
wished 
to 
attain, 
that 
is, 
no 
nearer 
to 
the 
summit 
of 
my 
efforts. 


"I 
took 
the 
car 
on 
my 
back 
the 
woman 
was 
thus 
more 
than 
ever 
above 
me. 


"The 
inn 
in 
which 
I 
finally 
found 
myself 
with 
my 
brother 
stood 
on 
the 
top 
of 
a 
mountain, 
this 
signified 
my 
burning 
desire 
for 
success 
in 
life, 
as 
I 
had 
expected 
it 
of 
my 
brother. 


"That 
I 
met 
with 
a 
family 
which 
was 
deeply 
in 
debt 
indicates 
that 
I 
had 
often 
had 
exaggerated 
thoughts 
concerning 
the 
cost 
of 
a 
wife 
to 
her 
husband 
and 
that 
the 
wife 
is 
too 
often 
the 
cause 
of 
running 
into 
debt. 


"It 
is 
clear 
to 
me 
also 
that 
trains 
of 
thought 
on 
masturbation 
(by-paths, 
being 
in 
debt) 
run 
through 
the 
dream, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
false 
connection 
of 
masturbation 
and 
the 
stunting 
of 
the 
genitals. 
The 
latter 
I 
ascribe 
to 
my 
uncertainty 
in 
regard 
to 
my 
bride. 
Without 
knowing 
it 
I 
hit 
upon 
all 
sorts 
of 
expedients 
for 
getting 
rid 
of 
her 
(in 
the 
corner). 
My 
condition 
of 
depression 
serves 
the 
same 
purpose, 
to 
be 
liberated 
from 
my 
wife, 
to 
prove 
my 



superiority 
in 
life." 


In 
our 
physiognomic 
of 
the 
soul 
we 
understand 
the 
theory 
of 
character 
to 
be 
this, 
we 
have 
already 
frequently 
spoken 
of 
those 
obvious 
and 
deep-seated 
wants 
which 
seek 
to 
support 
and 
maximate 
the 
ego-consciousness 
as 
an 
obtrusive 
proof 
of 
manliness, 
as 
if 
there 
were 
a 
constant 
fear 
of 
becoming 
" 
declassed," 
of 
the 
revelation 
of 
a 
feminine 
role. 
Thus 
the 
exaggerated 
modesty 
of 
many 
neurotics, 
who 
can 
visit 
no 
public 
toilet, 
who 
suffer 
from 
inhibition 
of 
the 
flow 
of 
urine 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
others, 
who 
withdraw 
from 
female 
society 
on 
account 
of 
blushing 
or 
anxiety 
and 
palpitation 
of 
the 
heart, 
reveals 
to 
us 
the 
strained 
manly 
ambition, 
which 
supports 
itself 
against 
the 
original 
feeling 
of 
inferiority. 
The 
masculine 
protest 
of 
these 
patients, 
insecure 
to 
the 
core, 
forces 
them 
to 
this 
arrangement 
whose 
boundaries 
pass 
over 
into 
those 
of 
bashfulness 
and 
awkwardness: 
or 
there 
is 
a 
concordance 
of 
these 
and 
other 
traits 
which 
may 
on 
occasion 
supplant 
each 
other. 
Often 
in 
neurotic 
persons 
of 
both 
sexes 
one 
finds 
an 
inability 
to 
go 
to 
the 
toilet 
in 
cases 
of 
great 
necessity 
before 
others. 
The 
greater 
modesty 
of 
women, 
especially 
of 
neurotic 
women, 
in 
all 
relations 
of 
life 
originates 
from 
the 
fear 
which 
is 
implanted 
in 
them 
from 
earliest 
childhood 
that 
attention 
might 
be 
directed 
to 
their 
sex. 
I 
have 
often 
convinced 
myself 
that 
the 
performances 
of 
girls 
and 
women 
suffer 
considerably 
from 
this 
more 
or 
less 
unconscious 
impression, 
indeed 
that 
the 
progress 
in 
the 
mental 
development 
just 
as 
is 
the 
case 
in 
male 
patients, 
who 
feel 
unmanly 
the 
formation 
of 
social 
and 
professional 
relations 
and 
relations 
of 
love 
are 
immediately 
checked 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
patient 
comes 
into 
a 
" 
feminine 
" 
or 
subordinate 
role 
or 
presupposes 
this 
expectation 
in 
others. 


This 
fact 
is 
in 
no 
manner 
affected 
when 
expressed 
or 
repressed 
sexual 
stimuli 
come 
to 
light 
as 
the 
apparent 
source 
of 
the 
checks 
of 
aggression. 
They 
are 
similarly 
arranged, 
have 
the 
purpose 
of 
enhancing 
the 
fear 
of 
the 
partner 
and 
of 
permitting 
the 
retreat 
decided 
upon 
in 
the 
plan 
of 
life 
to 
be 
entered 
upon; 
with 
certainty, 
are 
there 
also 
acts 
of 
foresight. 
The 
neurotic 
had 
already 
in 
childhood 
laid 
the 
foundation 
of 
this 
foresight 
and 
in 
it 
is 
reflected 
the 
feeling 
of 
shame 
as 
the 
guiding 
line 
of 
reassuring 
modesty 
and 
the 
prudery 
of 
civilization. 
The 
previous 
history 
of 
the 
patient 
reveals 
the 
exaggerated 
modesty 
and 
this 
is 
true 
at 
times 
of 
those 
who 
in 
other 
respects 
show 
a 
boyish 
nature, 
and 
the 
anxiety 
of 
nervous 
children 
on 
being 
exposed 
may 
be 



observed 
in 
their 
conduct. 
They 
exclude 
everyone 
from 
the 
room 
and 
will 
lock 
the 
doors 
when 
they 
are 
going 
to 
undress. 
This 
conduct 
is 
also 
often 
observed 
in 
boys 
who 
have 
grown 
up 
among 
girls. 
The 
masculine 
protest 
of 
the 
latter 
is 
expressed 
in 
these 
cases 
in 
the 
derogation 
of 
the 
boy, 
either 
purposely 
or 
unthinkingly, 
until 
he 
goes 
so 
far 
as 
to 
hide 
his 
sex. 
For 
the 
development 
of 
the 
neuroses 
this 
expedient 
of 
cowardice 
has 
an 
unfavorable 
significance. 
It 
is 
equal 
to 
later 
castration 
thoughts 
and 
wishes 
to 
the 
neurotic, 
wishes 
to 
be 
a 
woman, 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
fear 
of 
the 
wife 
seems 
actual, 
or 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
wishes 
to 
escape 
a 
decision. 
And 
it 
arises 
nevertheless 
originally 
from 
the 
compulsion 
of 
an 
exaggerated 
masculine 
protest, 
which 
is 
easily 
perceptible 
from 
the 
accompanying, 
often 
continuing 
traits 
of 
character, 
such 
as 
tyranny, 
burning 
ambition, 
the 
desire 
to 
have 
everything, 
to 
be 
first 
everywhere; 
from 
the 
emotional 
predispositions 
to 
rage 
and 
anger 
and 
finally 
from 
the 
tendency 
to 
derogate 
and 
to 
too 
great 
foresight. 


If 
therefore 
neurotic 
modesty 
should 
be 
considered 
equal 
to 
the 
secret 
attempt 
to 
play 
the 
man, 
this 
"consciousness 
of 
role" 
(Groos) 
is 
more 
clearly 
manifested 
in 
the 
apparently 
antithetical 
trait 
of 
character 
of 
shamelessness. 
In 
reality 
this 
latter 
line 
proves 
to 
be 
a 
reenforcement 
and 
continuation 
of 
the 
former, 
as 
an 
obtrusive 
reminder 
to 
the 
environment 
that 
one 
is 
a 
man. 
"The 
guiding 
idea, 
which 
causes 
the 
predisposition 
to, 
or 
habit 
of 
exhibitionistic 
gestures, 
hence 
often 
insulting 
or 
tactless 
-obtrusion 
in 
respect 
to 
the 
environment, 
betrays 
in 
detail 
the 
strong 
masculine 
factor. 
Thus 
it 
is 
when 
in 
nervous 
boys 
and 
men 
sexual 
exhibitionism 
breaks 
through 
or 
is 
expressed 
habitually 
in 
certain 
faults 
of 
toilette. 
In 
all 
similar 
cases 
one 
finds 
the 
belief 
in 
the 
power 
of 
the 
phallus 
constructed 
as 
in 
the 
antique 
religious 
cults 
as 
consciousness 
of 
power. 
Narcissistic 
traits 
are 
also 
regularly 
intermingled 
so 
that 
in 
these 
cases 
the 
attitude 
of 
conquest, 
accompanied 
by 
coquetry, 
by 
the 
inability 
to 
believe 
in 
a 
refusal, 
attracts 
the 
attention. 
In 
shameless 
girls 
the 
trait 
is 
even 
more 
noticeable 
because 
it 
is 
unusual. 
In 
conversation, 
in 
dress, 
in 
behavior, 
at 
times 
only 
in 
small 
things, 
at 
times 
obscurely 
or 
in 
coprology 
they 
demonstrate 
their 
inability 
to 
adapt 
themselves 
to 
or 
to 
satisfy 
themselves 
with 
their 
feminine 
role. 
The 
basis 
of 
operation 
for 
both 
sexes 
is 
manifested 
then 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
each 
demands 
from 
the 
other 
recognition 
or 
an 
extreme 
submission. 
In 
the 
analysis 
of 
such 
neurotic 
girls, 
at 
times 
only 
in 
their 
dreams 
and 
symptoms 
is 
observed 
the 
childish 
expectation 
of 
a 



metamorphosis 
into 
a 
male 
and 
in 
other 
cases 
always 
as 
an 
attempted 
substitute 
for 
the 
will 
to 
power, 
the 
wish 
to 
be 
above. 
If 
two 
persons 
of 
this 
sort 
meet, 
the 
result 
is 
not 
rarely 
that 
the 
reenforced 
masculine 
guiding 
line 
of 
the 
one 
affects 
the 
other 
preliminarily 
as 
a 
sort 
of 
miracle, 
a 
talisman, 
because 
in 
her 
guiding 
ideal 
the 
belief 
in 
the 
miraculousness 
and 
wonder 
working 
power 
of 
manliness 
is 
also 
contained. 
Thus 
there 
is 
often 
for 
both 
what 
seems 
a 
chance 
fulfilling 
of 
destiny, 
but 
which 
is 
really 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
power 
of 
their 
idea 
of 
personality. 
One 
often 
finds 
immodest 
conduct 
in 
neurotic 
girls 
as 
an 
anticipation 
of 
their 
fictitious 
expectation; 
they 
conduct 
themselves 
as 
if 
they 
were 
really 
a 
boy 
or 
a 
man, 
expose 
themselves 
naked 
or 
live 
out 
in 
neurotic 
symptoms, 
dreams 
and 
phantasies, 
their 
masculine 
reincarnation. 
Often 
in 
such 
patients 
the 
attempt 
is 
observed 
to 
ascribe 
the 
miraculous 
power 
of 
the 
phallus 
by 
means 
of 
an 
alteration 
of 
form 
of 
the 
fiction 
to 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
body, 
for 
example 
to 
the 
hands, 
feet, 
breasts, 
which 
thus 
altered 
into 
male 
members 
are 
taken 
into 
especial 
favor 
as 
fetiches 
and 
enjoy 
a 
Narcissus-form 
worship, 
as 
often 
also 
the 
genital 
organs 
or 
the 
whole 
body. 
This 
fetichism 
is 
nearly 
always 
transferred 
to 
the 
articles 
of 
clothing 
and 
constitutes 
a 
large 
part 
of 
the 
charm 
of 
fashion, 
from 
which 
we 
therefore 
must 
assume 
that 
this, 
like 
the 
fetichism 
itself, 
must 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
substitute 
of 
manliness 
with 
its 
larger 
sphere 
of 
usefulness, 
which 
has 
been 
lost 
but 
which 
is 
always 
to 
be 
sought. 


Like 
immodesty 
the 
deep-seated 
neurotic 
infidelity 
of 
many 
sick 
patients 
is 
an 
imitation 
of 
the 
exaggerated, 
apperceived 
masculine 
image. 
It 
indicates 
to 
us 
one 
of 
the 
ways 
which 
the 
masculine 
goal 
is 
forced 
to 
take. 
It 
is, 
like 
many 
of 
the 
neurotic 
traits 
of 
character, 
often 
only 
ideal, 
a 
maker 
of 
humor 
or 
of 
the 
view 
of 
life 
(Marczinowsky) 
or 
extends 
only 
to 
the 
boundary 
where 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
female 
role 
begins. 
Much 
oftener 
the 
virtue 
of 
fidelity 
is 
chosen 
as 
the 
means 
of 
security 
in 
the 
fear 
of 
the 
man. 
Phantasies 
of 
infidelity, 
at 
times 
to 
the 
degree 
of 
hallucinations 
or 
dreams, 
often 
result 
where 
there 
is 
real 
or 
imagined 
subjection 
exacted 
by 
the 
husband. 
Phantasies 
of 
prostitution 
indicate 
in 
these 
cases 
the 
neurotic, 
exaggerated 
perspective 
concerning 
the 
power 
of 
the 
sexual 
appetite 
and 
serve 
the 
same 
purpose 
of 
gaining 
security. 
In 
general 
in 
patients 
who 
are 
prone 
to 
speak 
of 
their 
sexuality 
the 
suspicion 
is 
justified 
that 
they 
paint 
their 
bugbear 
with 
great 
exaggeration. 
The 
reality 
is 
always 
in 
their 
favor. 
In 
girls 
often 
the 
holy 
conviction 
of 
their 
infidelity 



occupies 
the 
foreground 
entirely. 
It 
may 
be 
therefrom 
inferred 
that 
for 
them 
even 
a 
single 
man 
would 
be 
too 
much 
and 
that 
they 
wish 
to 
protect 
themselves 
from 
love 
and 
especially 
from 
marriage: 
" 
for 
where 
does 
my 
passion 
drive 
me? 
' 
The 
real 
infidelity 
of 
many 
persons, 
too, 
both 
men 
and 
women, 
is 
the 
result 
of 
the 
fear 
of 
the 
partner 
of 
whose 
superiority 
they 
are 
afraid. 
The 
understanding 
of 
the 
accompanying 
symptoms, 
fear 
of 
solitude, 
fear 
of 
places, 
fear 
of 
society, 
etc., 
unsocial 
conduct, 
fixation 
of 
faults 
of 
childhood 
and 
derogation 
of 
the 
opposite 
sex 
are 
other 
signs 
by 
which 
the 
masculine 
purpose 
of 
these 
traits 
of 
character 
is 
revealed. 
Often 
despised 
love 
gives 
rise 
to 
a 
feeling 
of 
a 
reduction 
of 
the 
egoistic 
sense 
to 
such 
a 
degree 
that 
hate, 
indifference 
or 
infidelity 
are 
the 
forms 
which 
the 
masculine 
protest 
assumes. 


In 
this 
place 
a 
few 
educational 
observations 
may 
be 
added, 
which 
I 
was 
in 
a 
position 
to 
make 
in 
regard 
to 
neurotics 
suffering 
from 
jealousy. 
They 
all 
have 
reference 
to 
the 
search 
for 
proofs 
of 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
individual 
over 
the 
partner 
and 
every 
situation 
which 
is 
even 
half-way 
fitted 
for 
this 
purpose 
is 
made 
use 
of. 
The 
insatiableness 
with 
which 
the 
neurotic 
tests 
his 
partner 
is 
an 
indication 
of 
the 
want 
of 
self-confidence, 
of 
his 
lack 
of 
self-esteem, 
of 
his 
uncertainty, 
so 
that 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
be 
seen 
how 
his 
jealous 
efforts 
serve 
to 
bring 
him 
more 
into 
notice, 
to 
attract 
more 
attention 
to 
himself 
and 
thus 
to 
secure 
his 
self-esteem. 
The 
old 
feeling 
of 
being 
disregarded 
and 
neglected 
is 
seen 
to 
be 
revived 
upon 
the 
slightest 
occasion 
together 
with 
the 
childish 
attitude 
of 
wishing 
to 
have 
everything, 
to 
obtain 
a 
proof 
of 
superiority 
from 
the 
partner. 
A 
glance, 
a 
word 
in 
company, 
an 
acknowledgment 
of 
a 
favor, 
a 
show 
of 
sympathy 
for 
a 
picture, 
for 
an 
author, 
for 
a 
relative, 
even 
a 
protective 
attitude 
towards 
servants 
may 
be 
taken 
as 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
operation. 
In 
severe 
cases 
the 
impression 
is 
distinctly 
given 
that 
the 
jealous 
individual 
cannot 
rest 
because 
he 
has 
no 
confidence 
in 
peaceful 
happiness 
on 
account 
of 
his 
misfortune. 
Now 
the 
neurosis 
develops 
in 
which 
the 
effort 
is 
made 
to 
bend 
the 
partner 
by 
an 
arrangement 
of 
attacks, 
to 
arouse 
the 
sympathy 
of 
the 
partner, 
or 
the 
attack 
is 
intended 
as 
a 
punishment. 
Headaches, 
weeping 
fits, 
conditions 
of 
weakness, 
paralysis, 
attacks 
of 
anxiety 
and 
depression, 
silence, 
etc., 
have 
the 
same 
value 
as 
abandonment 
to 
alcoholism, 
masturbation, 
perversion 
and 
lewdness. 
The 
lines 
of 
distrust 
and 
doubt 
often 
about 
the 
legitimacy 
of 
the 
children 
become 
more 
pronounced, 
outbreaks 
of 
wrath 
and 



scolding, 
mistrust 
of 
the 
entire 
opposite 
sex 
are 
regular 
phenomena 
and 
reveal 
the 
other 
side 
of 
jealousy 
as 
a 
preparation 
for 
the 
derogation 
of 
the 
other. 
Often 
pride 
prevents 
consciousness 
of 
jealousy; 
the 
conduct 
is 
the 
same. 
The 
situation 
is 
not 
rarely 
made 
worse 
by 
the 
circumstance 
that 
the 
other 
party 
meets 
the 
helplessness 
of 
the 
jealous 
person 
with 
an 
unconscious 
satisfaction, 
thereby 
giving 
foundation 
to 
his 
feeling 
of 
superiority 
and 
does 
not 
therefore 
find 
the 
right 
tone, 
the 
proper 
attitude 
to 
hold 
the 
jealousy 
at 
least 
within 
limits, 
jealousy 
of 
children 
often 
leads 
to 
grave 
faults 
of 
education. 
The 
belief 
in 
miracles 
as 
a 
threat 
to 
the 
sexual 
organs 
through 
births 
or 
aging 
nearly 
always 
causes 
jealous 
excitement 
to 
be 
more 
strongly 
manifested 
in 
neurotically 
disposed 
persons. 



CHAPTER 
VIII 


FEAR 
OF 
THE 
PARTNER; 
THE 
IDEAL 
IN 
THE 
NEUROSIS; 
INSOMNIA 
AND 
COMPULSION 
TO 
SLEEP; 
NEUROTIC 
COMPARISON 
OF 
MAN 
AND 
WOMAN; 
FORMS 
OF 
THE 
FEAR 
OF 
THE 
WIFE 


IN 
this 
striving 
of 
the 
neurotic 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
masculine 
guiding 
goal, 
one 
never 
misses 
the 
fact, 
as 
has 
already 
been 
emphasized, 
that 
the 
fear 
of 
a 
decision 
resolves 
itself 
into 
a 
fear 
of 
the 
opposite 
sex, 
that 
touchstone 
of 
the 
individual's 
own 
power, 
the 
fulfiller 
of 
the 
guiding 
idea. 
One 
finds 
in 
the 
family 
life 
of 
boys 
and 
girls, 
in 
their 
play 
and 
phantasy, 
in 
their 
assortment 
of 
experiences 
of 
all 
kinds, 
in 
their 
day 
dreams 
and 
poems 
and 
in 
their 
living 
out 
of 
actual 
experiences 
preparations 
for 
the 
struggle 
for 
supremacy 
so 
early, 
with 
such 
abundance 
and 
such 
unity 
of 
purpose 
that 
in 
arriving 
at 
puberty 
secure 
determinants 
for 
love 
and 
marriage 
already 
exist 
and 
by 
these 
alone 
the 
choice 
and 
direction 
of 
their 
eroticism 
is 
defined 
within 
narrow 
limits. 
Let 
us 
consider 
now 
of 
what 
nature 
these 
determinants 
of 
love 
objects 
may 
be 
in 
neurotics. 
Among 
these 
should 
be 
mentioned 
tyranny, 
hypersensitiveness, 
ambition, 
discontent 
and 
all 
the 
principal 
neurotic 
character-traits 
already 
described, 
the 
security-giving 
devices 
of 
mistrust, 
caution, 
jealousy 
and 
derogatory 
tendency 
which 
is 
everywhere 
seeking 
faults, 
the 
neurotic 
digressions 
and 
subterfuges 
which 
are 
at 
first 
directed 
against 
members 
of 
their 
own 
family, 
and 
which 
are 
intended, 
with 
this 
as 
a 
basis, 
to 
prove 
their 
own 
superiority 
or 
to 
facilitate 
the 
escape 
of 
the 
superiority 
of 
others. 
The 
neurotic 
device 
has 
its 
part 
in 
this 
and 
demands 
for 
love 
some 
quality 
which 
is 
difficult 
of 
attainment 
or 
entirely 
out 
of 
reach, 
or 
that 
the 
sexual 
partner 
" 
shall 
supply 
that 
which 
is 
lacking 
" 
(Plato 
and 
many 
modern 
sexologists), 
which 
is 
paramount 
to 
saying 
that 
the 
partner 
must 
fulfil 
or 
represent 
the 
" 
ego-ideal 
" 
which 
the 
other 
party 
to 
the 
contract 
has 
constructed 
as 
a 
compensation. 
The 
normal 
child, 
too, 
expects 
from 
his 
future, 
and 
especially 
from 
the 
one 
chosen 
in 
love 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
his 
ideals. 
But 
in 
due 
course 
of 
time, 
after 
he 
has 
permitted 
himself 
to 
be 
driven 
by 
his 
"ideal" 
as 
a 
means 
to 
an 
end 
he 
is 
able 
to 
detach 
himself 
from 
it, 
descend 
to 
reality 
and 
reckon 
with 



the 
demands 
of 
reality. 
Not 
so 
with 
the 
neurotic. 
He 
is 
unable 
to 
change 
his 
neurotic 
perspectives 
through 
his 
own 
power, 
he 
cannot 
dispense 
with 
his 
principles 
which 
have 
by 
now 
become 
fixed 
and 
rigid, 
he 
has 
no 
longer 
control 
over 
his 
traits 
of 
character. 
Chained 
to 
his 
"idea" 
he 
brings 
his 
old 
prejudices 
into 
his 
love-relations 
and 
behaves 
as 
though 
they 
ought 
to 
procure 
for 
him 
not 
reality 
but 
the 
security 
of 
his 
"idea," 
the 
triumph 
of 
his 
strained 
masculine 
protest. 
And 
soon 
disillusion 
makes 
its 
appearance. 
For 
it 
is 
introduced 
by 
the 
neurotic 
himself 
as 
a 
protective 
measure, 
as 
a 
security 
against 
the 
prospective 
derogatory 
effect 
of 
his 
fictive 
finale. 
The 
disillusionment 
furnishes 
the 
adequate 
basis 
for 
a 
continuance 
of 
the 
strife 
against 
the 
partner, 
for 
a 
recognition 
of 
every 
opportunity 
for 
the 
degradation 
of 
the 
latter. 
For 
these 
were, 
after 
all, 
the 
most 
immediate 
goals 
of 
the 
old 
preparatory 
training. 


Unconsciously, 
the 
fear 
of 
the 
sexual 
partner 
hovers 
in 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
growing 
neurotic 
as 
though 
he 
anticipated 
in 
the 
approach 
of 
that 
event 
the 
end 
of 
his 
masculine 
fiction 
and 
with 
it 
the 
annihilation 
of 
his 
ego-
consciousness, 
of 
his 
guiding 
star, 
of 
his 
security 
in 
the 
chaos 
of 
life. 
He 
creates 
for 
himself 
ideals 
in 
order 
to 
detract 
from 
reality. 
He 
screws 
his 
ego-
consciousness, 
often 
in 
a 
narcissistic 
manner, 
as 
high 
as 
possible 
in 
order 
to 
make 
every 
partner 
appear 
small 
by 
contrast. 
He 
surrounds 
himself 
with 
a 
wall 
of 
the 
most 
crass 
egotism 
in 
order 
to 
furnish 
the 
proof 
of 
his 
unfitness 
to 
himself 
and 
others. 
He 
arranges 
in 
a 
neurotic 
manner 
doubt, 
uncertainty, 
awkwardness, 
adheres 
to 
old 
faults 
of 
childhood 
and 
constructs 
new 
deficiencies 
in 
order 
to 
keep 
himself 
at 
a 
distance. 
He 
invents 
weaknesses, 
submissiveness, 
masochistic 
impulses 
in 
order 
to 
alarm 
himself. 
The 
power 
of 
the 
sex 
instinct 
becomes 
for 
him 
an 
"overvalued 
idea" 
(Wernicke), 
because 
he 
feels 
its 
need 
and 
apperceives 
his 
sexual 
desire 
as 
the 
superiority 
of 
the 
opposite 
sex. 
The 
neurotic 
is 
incapable 
of 
love, 
not 
because 
he 
has 
repressed 
his 
sexuality, 
but 
because 
his 
rigid 
predispositions 
lie 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
his 
fiction, 
in 
the 
line 
towards 
power. 
The 
neurotic 
caricatures 
of 
Don 
Juan 
and 
Messalina 
are, 
notwithstanding 
their 
sexuality, 
neurotic. 
Those 
who 
become 
inverts 
and 
perverts 
have 
already 
escaped 
the 
threatening 
cliffs 
and 
seek 
henceforth 
to 
make 
a 
virtue 
of 
necessity. 
And 
where 
thoughts 
of 
incest 
apparently 
effect 
a 
check 
on 
the 
erotic 
life, 
it 
can 
be 
shown 
that 
to 
the 
neurotic, 
who 
constantly 
fears 
a 
decision, 
this 
represents 
a 
secure 
refuge, 
that 



is, 
the 
secure 
way 
to 
the 
mother 
or 
father 
clothed 
in 
a 
sexual 
simile. 


The 
flight 
from 
the 
partner, 
especially 
the 
flight 
from 
the 
wife, 
succeeds 
better 
in 
those 
neurotics 
who 
have 
early 
succeeded 
in 
finding 
their 
way 
to 
a 
profession 
or 
who 
have 
turned 
to 
an 
artistic 
vocation. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
should 
they 
be 
threatened 
with 
a 
feminine 
role, 
with 
defeat, 
the 
fear 
of 
a 
decision, 
of 
their 
future, 
of 
life, 
of 
death 
may 
overtake 
them 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
their 
labors. 
Frequently, 
however, 
some 
sort 
of 
tranquilizing 
occupation 
furnishes 
the 
neurotic 
the 
means 
securing 
his 
ego 
consciousness, 
or 
his 
talents, 
in 
effecting 
a 
formal 
change 
in 
his 
fiction, 
furnish 
him 
the 
opportunity 
to 
contest 
for 
the 
palm 
of 
masculinity 
in 
art. 
It 
is 
then 
not 
rare 
that 
the 
motive 
and 
content 
of 
his 
artistic 
creations 
reflect 
that 
which 
has 
driven 
him 
into 
the 
security-giving 
sphere 
of 
art, 
namely, 
the 
power 
of 
woman 
and 
his 
fear 
of 
the 
wife. 


The 
wonderfully 
effective 
charm 
which 
many 
myths, 
many 
creations 
of 
art 
and 
philosophy 
possess 
for 
us, 
is 
in 
line 
with 
this; 
the 
fault 
of 
the 
woman, 
the 
banal 
"cherchez 
la 
femme," 
in 
all 
evils. 
The 
thought 
is 
expressed 
in 
a 
bizarre 
manner 
by 
Baudelaire, 
" 
I 
can 
form 
no 
idea 
of 
a 
beautiful 
woman 
without 
at 
the 
same 
time 
imagining 
misfortune 
connected 
with 
her;" 
mythically 
and 
sublimely, 
in 
the 
story 
of 
Eve, 
traces 
of 
which 
have 
never 
been 
missing 
from 
poetry. 
"The 
Iliad" 
is 
built 
upon 
this 
foundation, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
"Thousand 
and 
One 
Nights," 
and 
if 
one 
examines 
more 
closely, 
every 
great 
and 
small 
artistic 
creation. 
What 
is 
its 
leading 
thought? 
Nothing 
less 
than 
to 
win 
a 
standpoint 
in 
the 
uncertainties 
of 
life, 
in 
the 
conflict 
with 
love, 
in 
the 
fear 
of 
woman. 


Woman 
as 
a 
sphynx, 
as 
a 
demon, 
as 
a 
vampire, 
as 
a 
witch, 
as 
a 
man-
murdering 
horror, 
as 
benefactress, 
in 
all 
these 
pictures 
is 
reflected 
the 
sexual 
impulse 
which 
has 
become 
over-excited 
by 
the 
masculine 
protest 
and 
which 
has 
its 
counterpart 
in 
the 
caricature 
of 
woman, 
in 
the 
obscene 
outpourings 
of 
gall, 
in 
anecdotes 
and 
degrading 
comparisons. 
In 
the 
same 
manner 
the 
neurotic, 
philistine 
male-consciousness 
and 
the 
desire 
for 
superiority 
forces 
to 
those 
firm 
convictions 
which 
would 
deny 
woman 
equal 
rights, 
sometimes 
even 
the 
right 
to 
existence. 


Another 
turn 
which 
neurotic 
trains 
of 
thought 
may 
take 
in 
seeking 
security 
from 
woman 
leads 
as 
a 
natural 
consequence 
away 
from 
reality 
and 
life. 
In 
line 
with 
this 
Schopenhauer 
was 
led 
to 
a 
denial 
of 
life, 
the 
present, 
all 
time. 
(The 
preparations 
for 
this 
attitude 
originated 
in 
his 
unfriendly 
attitude 



towards 
his 
mother.) 
Many 
patients 
flee 
in 
a 
somewhat 
less 
consistent 
and 
methodical 
manner 
in 
their 
fear 
of 
woman, 
but 
they 
constantly 
hanker 
after 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
their 
fiction 
in 
phantasies 
and 
dreams 
which 
they 
weave 
about 
the 
future. 
Every 
neurotic 
shows 
this 
trait, 
wishes 
to 
illuminate 
and 
investigate 
the 
future 
in 
order 
to 
secure 
himself 
in 
good 
time. 
His 
cautious 
and 
anxious 
expectation 
gives 
the 
fundamental 
tone 
to 
future 
events, 
gray, 
sombre, 
full 
of 
danger. 
For 
they 
must 
seem 
thus 
to 
him 
in 
order 
to 
be 
effective 
as 
incentives. 
Now 
he 
is 
able 
to 
keep 
the 
greatest 
danger 
in 
sight, 
draw 
the 
lines 
of 
his 
character-traits 
and 
predispositions 
to 
the 
fineness 
of 
a 
hair 
in 
order 
to 
secure 
himself 
adequately. 
Now 
he 
believes 
to 
have 
discovered 
the 
road 
to 
his 
goal, 
and 
instead 
of 
ambition, 
longing 
after 
victory 
and 
triumph, 
honor, 
elevation, 
power 
and 
admiration, 
he 
allows 
his 
symptoms 
to 
become 
effective. 
He 
experiences 
under 
the 
compulsion 
of 
his 
guiding 
principle, 
as 
a 
prophetic 
gift, 
what 
sober 
individuals 
experience 
through 
their 
foresight 
and 
estimation 
of 
reality. 
But 
with 
neurotic 
strivings 
of 
"anticipatory 
thinking," 
attention 
approaches 
problems 
and 
arranges 
them 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
neurotic's 
antithetical 
mode 
of 
apperception, 
which 
values 
a 
defeat 
as 
death, 
as 
inferiority, 
as 
effeminacy, 
and 
victory 
as 
immortality, 
higher 
values, 
masculine 
triumph, 
while 
the 
hundreds 
of 
other 
possibilities 
of 
life 
are 
annihilated 
by 
withdrawing 
them 
from 
attention. 
In 
the 
same 
manner 
the 
way 
is 
entered 
upon 
to 
the 
anticipation 
of 
future 
triumph 
and 
terror 
as 
well 
as 
an 
hallucinatory 
reinforcement 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
security. 
The 
psychoses 
show 
this 
trend 
in 
a 
pure 
manner, 
melancholia 
and 
mania 
as 
anticipations 
of 
the 
pure 
antithesis 
"above-beneath," 
dementia 
praecox, 
paranoia 
and 
cyclothyemia 
as 
a 
mixture. 


The 
recognition 
and 
construction 
of 
traits 
of 
character 
now 
follow 
essentially 
in 
strict 
conformity 
with 
the 
goal-idea. 
The 
accentuation 
of 
the 
traits 
of 
greed 
and 
economy 
is 
intended 
to 
prevent 
the 
abjectness 
of 
poverty, 
pedantry, 
to 
assure 
against 
difficulties, 
ethical 
traits 
of 
character, 
against 
shame, 
and 
all 
of 
these 
against 
relations 
of 
love 
and 
marriage, 
against 
a 
subjection 
to 
the 
partner, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
furnish 
the 
possibility 
of 
an 
attack 
upon 
the 
partner, 
an 
ever 
ready 
excuse 
for 
his 
own 
depreciation 
of 
others. 
The 
device 
of 
the 
"principle 
of 
exclusion," 
is 
held 
in 
the 
highest 
esteem, 
becomes 
a 
religious 
or 
proverbial 
principle 
of 
life, 
of 
the 
highest 
wisdom. 
The 
uncertainties 
of 
our 
social 
system, 
ethical 
points 
of 
view 
and 
the 



difficulties 
attendant 
upon 
the 
rearing 
of 
children, 
furnish 
a 
welcome 
excuse 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
boundaries 
of 
a 
natural 
and 
reasonable 
attitude 
towards 
life 
as 
narrowly 
as 
possible, 
while 
the 
obscurity 
and 
insolubility 
of 
the 
problems 
of 
heredity 
are 
distorted 
in 
a 
similar 
manner 
in 
order 
to 
justify 
an 
unwedded 
life. 
Many 
take 
refuge 
in 
religion, 
surrender 
their 
present 
life, 
excite 
their 
moral 
and 
ascetic 
instincts 
in 
order 
to 
become 
partakers 
in 
the 
happiness, 
in 
the 
triumph 
in 
the 
"beyond." 
An 
asexual 
role 
is 
arranged 
and 
everything 
becomes 
a 
means 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
heightened 
ego-
consciousness 
which 
is 
rendered 
possible 
by 
the 
neurotic 
perspective 
of 
life 
and 
its 
experiences. 
At 
times 
security 
is 
attained 
through 
a 
want 
of 
satisfaction 
in 
sexual 
relations, 
through 
a 
heightening 
of 
the 
disillusionment 
to 
a 
marked 
degree, 
a 
device 
to 
which 
the 
patient 
plainly 
lends 
his 
assistance. 


It 
is 
only 
another 
phase 
of 
the 
fear 
of 
the 
partner 
when 
the 
patient 
brings 
his 
predispositions 
into 
play 
against 
the 
psychotherapeutist. 
The 
neurotic 
female 
patient 
combats 
the 
man 
in 
the 
physician 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
and 
seeks 
to 
escape 
his 
masculine 
influence 
which 
she 
often 
apperceives 
as 
most 
terrifying, 
looking 
at 
it 
as 
she 
does 
from 
a 
sexual 
point 
of 
view. 
The 
male 
neurotic 
secretly 
seeks 
to 
undermine 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
psychotherapeutist, 
which 
influence 
he 
apperceives 
as 
sexual 
superiority, 
and 
both 
conduct 
themselves 
during 
the 
course 
of 
the 
treatment 
as 
they 
had 
always 
conducted 
themselves 
whenever 
compelled 
to 
take 
an 
active 
part 
in 
life, 
or 
whenever 
confronted 
by 
a 
decision. 


At 
times 
patients 
are 
found 
whose 
flight 
from 
woman 
is 
into 
the 
past. 
It 
is 
then 
that 
their 
interest 
for 
antiquities, 
heraldry, 
dead 
languages, 
etc., 
becomes 
very 
acute, 
and 
they 
often 
become 
quite 
skillful 
in 
this 
direction. 
This 
skill 
is 
absent 
in 
those 
patients 
who 
instead 
turn 
their 
attention 
to 
grave-yards, 
death-
notices 
and 
funerals. 


I 
have 
already 
mentioned 
that 
the 
' 
' 
motive 
of 
the 
fear 
of 
woman" 
is 
the 
strongest 
incentive 
to 
art 
and 
phantasy. 
Permit 
me 
to 
quote 
an 
abstract 
from 
Grillparzer's 
autobiography, 
which 
illuminates 
much 
of 
our 
thesis. 


"Like 
every 
well-made 
man 
I 
felt 
myself 
attracted 
by 
the 
beautiful 
half 
of 
mankind. 
I 
was, 
however, 
far 
too 
little 
satisfied 
with 
myself 
to 
believe 
myself 
capable 
of 
making 
deep 
impressions 
in 
a 
short 
time. 
Could 
it 
have 
been 
the 
vague 
conception 
of 
the 
poet 
or 
of 
poetry, 
or 
was 
it 
the 
reverse 
of 
my 
nature, 
which 
when 
it 
does 
not 
repel, 
attracts, 
because 
of 
the 
spirit 
of 
contradiction? 
I 



would 
find 
myself 
deeply 
entangled 
while 
I 
still 
believed 
myself 
to 
be 
only 
at 
the 
first 
advances. 
This 
promised 
both 
pleasure 
and 
pain 
near 
at 
hand, 
though 
mostly 
the 
latter, 
because 
my 
real 
efforts 
had 
always 
been 
to 
preserve 
myself 
in 
that 
tranquil 
state 
which 
would 
not 
render 
difficult, 
or 
even 
entirely 
prevent 
the 
approach 
of 
my 
real 
goddess, 
art." 


When 
both, 
artist 
and 
neurotic, 
regard 
the 
attraction 
of 
woman 
as 
menacing, 
as 
dangerous, 
as 
a 
compulsion 
on 
account 
of 
the 
uncertainty 
of 
their 
triumph, 
when 
both 
regard 
amorous 
emotions 
as 
a 
subjection, 
it 
is 
only 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
fundamental 
disposition 
that 
animates 
both. 
By 
which 
I 
do 
not 
at 
all 
intend 
to 
deny 
the 
realities 
of 
these 
relations. 
An 
examination 
of 
love, 
be 
it 
ever 
so 
sober, 
reveals 
a 
mutual 
adaptation, 
a 
subjection 
of 
our 
will. 
To 
put 
forth, 
however, 
special 
efforts 
to 
unearth 
these, 
to 
think 
of 
them 
as 
something 
significant 
and 
to 
renounce, 
for 
this 
reason, 
the 
pleasurable 
yielding 
thereto, 
reveals 
unequivocally 
an 
unconquerable 
craving 
for 
self-
assertion 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
person 
in 
question, 
which 
we 
have 
frequently 
shown 
to 
be 
the 
neurotic's 
overcompensation 
for 
his 
neurotic 
feeling 
of 
inferiority. 
The 
guiding 
goal 
forbids 
the 
formation 
of 
fitting 
predispositions, 
or 
presents 
them 
only 
in 
the 
form 
of 
an 
unmeasurable 
masochistic 
exaggeration 
which 
is 
in 
turn 
itself 
used 
as 
a 
protective 
measure. 


At 
times 
this 
craving 
for 
self-assertion 
seeks 
other 
channels 
as 
soon 
as 
it 
feels 
its 
own 
libidinous 
tension 
as 
the 
superior 
power 
of 
the 
partner. 
Wishes 
and 
efforts 
then 
emerge 
to 
escape 
this 
power 
through 
t 
satiety, 
through 
orgies. 
Even 
castration 
wishes 
and 
intents, 
and 
similarly 
ascetic 
and 
repentant 
practices 
make 
their 
appearance, 
such 
as 
flagellation, 
etc., 
incited 
by 
the 
unconquerable 
craving 
for 
security, 
all 
in 
order 
to 
win 
peace 
from 
the 
demon, 
love. 
Active, 
constantly 
recurring 
perversions, 
especially 
masochistic 
manifestations, 
can 
be 
explained 
in 
no 
other 
way. 
They 
are 
an 
expression 
of 
the 
necessity 
of 
convincing 
one's-self 
in 
detail 
of 
the 
sinister 
strength 
of 
the 
partner, 
in 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
construct 
out 
of 
this 
conviction 
of 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
other 
and 
of 
one's 
own 
weakness 
an 
admonishing 
bugbear. 
The 
real 
result 
of 
this, 
the 
neurotic's 
rectification 
of 
boundaries, 
is 
a 
strong 
deviation 
from 
the 
normal 
path, 
which 
path 
he 
fears 
most 
of 
all. 
The 
self-degradation 
thus 
arranged 
now 
furnishes 
a 
stronger 
stimulus 
for 
the 
masculine 
protest 
and 
enhances 
it 
in 
line 
with 
the 
goal-idea. 
"It 
must 
be 
night, 
where 
Friedland's 
stars 
shine." 
Now, 
after 
these 
detours, 
his 
efforts 
are 
again 
directed 
along 
the 



paths 
of 
his 
neurotic 
goal, 
reveal 
sadistic 
admixtures 
and 
a 
strong 
purification 
fanaticism 
in 
case 
facts 
or 
fancies 
of 
a 
coprophilic 
nature 
play 
a 
role. 
Or 
the 
patient 
contents 
himself 
to 
create 
an 
appearance 
of 
justification 
for 
his 
neurotic 
detours 
by 
means 
of 
a 
struggle 
against 
the 
judgment 
of 
others, 
against 
the 
law, 
or 
often 
by 
having 
recourse 
to 
an 
unheard 
of 
logic, 
and 
in 
this 
way 
seeks 
again 
to 
prove 
his 
superiority. 
Thus 
it 
is 
in 
the 
arguments 
of 
inverts 
who 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
owe 
their 
neurotic 
deviation 
from 
normality 
to 
their 
fear 
of 
the 
opposite 
sex. 


The 
prestige 
which 
it 
is 
sought 
to 
maintain, 
the 
masculine 
protest 
is 
always 
shoved 
into 
the 
foreground, 
until 
the 
enlightening 
analysis 
arrives 
at 
that 
point 
where 
in 
the 
memories 
of 
man 
the 
neurotically 
grouped 
thoughts 
come 
to 
light, 
i.e., 
that 
it 
is 
his 
inferiority, 
his 
underdeveloped 
genitalia 
which 
will 
hinder 
him 
from 
obtaining 
victory 
over 
woman; 
in 
the 
memories 
of 
female 
patients 
this 
place 
is 
occupied 
by 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
by 
the 
neurotic 
terror 
of 
the 
feminine 
role. 
Along 
with 
these 
rediscovered 
trains 
of 
thought, 
which 
have 
their 
origin 
in 
the 
earliest 
years 
of 
childhood, 
one 
detects 
megalomanic 
ideas 
often 
in 
the 
shape 
of 
narcissism 
and 
exhibitionism. 
They 
are 
to 
be 
readily 
understood 
as 
preparatory 
attempts 
at 
compensation 
for 
the 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
such 
as 
are 
produced 
by 
the 
compulsion 
of 
the 
guiding 
fiction, 
as 
secondary 
neurotic 
formations 
which 
say, 
"I 
want 
to 
be 
a 
complete 
man." 
The 
change 
of 
formula 
which 
this 
thought 
experiences 
in 
girls 
into 
the 
ideal, 
"I 
will 
excel 
all 
women" 
has 
already 
been 
mentioned. 


I 
am 
able 
to 
present 
some 
of 
these 
relationships 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
following 
female 
patient. 
A 
19-year-old 
girl 
came 
under 
my 
care 
for 
depression, 
suicidal 
ideas, 
insomnia 
and 
incapacity 
for 
work. 
She 
had 
become 
an 
artist 
in 
order 
to 
have 
a 
profession. 
With 
the 
exception 
of 
indications 
of 
hereditary 
tuberculosis 
and 
myopia 
there 
were 
no 
discoverable 
bodily 
symptoms. 
The 
relatives 
described 
her 
as 
formerly 
an 
obstinate 
child 
who 
left 
home 
because 
she 
wished 
to 
be 
self-supporting. 
Her 
mother 
and 
her 
only 
older 
brother 
died 
of 
tuberculosis. 


The 
commencement 
of 
the 
treatment 
was 
very 
difficult 
because 
the 
patient 
sat 
before 
me 
showing 
great 
indifference 
and 
answered 
none 
of 
my 
questions. 
Only 
at 
times 
did 
she 
express 
herself 
with 
a 
negative 
gesture, 
or 
answered 
with 
" 
No." 


I 
began 
to 
work 
cautiously, 
I 
explained 
to 
her 
that 
her 
indifference 
is 



identical 
with 
her 
general 
derogatory 
tendency, 
the 
same 
being 
true 
of 
her 
continued 
silence 
in 
my 
presence, 
her 
negativism, 
her 
"No," 
all 
of 
which 
are 
part 
of 
this 
derogatory 
tendency 
now 
directed 
against 
me. 
I 
then 
endeavor 
to 
show 
her 
that 
her 
conduct 
indicates 
her 
discontent 
with 
her 
feminine 
role 
against 
which 
she 
seeks 
to 
secure 
herself 
in 
this 
manner. 
She 
answers 
me 
constantly 
with 
"No," 
which 
I 
disregard 
as 
something 
to 
be 
expected 
and 
which 
is 
directed 
against 
me, 
the 
male, 
and 
proceed. 
Her 
depression 
began 
during 
her 
sojourn 
at 
a 
bathing 
resort. 
I 
now 
maintain 
with 
certainty 
that 
something 
must 
have 
happened 
there 
which 
had 
released 
this 
“No,” 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
something 
which 
had 
brusquely 
brought 
to 
her 
attention 
her 
feminine 
role. 
Thereupon 
she 
related 
that 
more 
than 
a 
year 
ago 
she 
had 
been 
at 
another 
resort 
where 
she 
made 
the 
acquaintance 
of 
a 
young 
man, 
who 
was 
agreeable 
to 
her, 
and 
that 
tenderness 
and 
kisses 
had 
followed. 
One 
evening 
the 
young 
man 
had 
fallen 
upon 
her 
as 
though 
he 
were 
insane 
and 
tried 
to 
approach 
her 
in 
an 
indecent 
manner. 
Whereupon 
she 
immediately 
left 
the 
place. 
I 
call 
her 
attention 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
she 
tore 
herself 
away 
at 
the 
moment 
when 
the 
young 
man 
wished 
definitely 
to 
force 
her 
by 
his 
behaviour 
into 
a 
feminine 
role 
and 
added 
the 
remark 
that 
she 
must 
have 
undergone 
a 
similar 
experience 
during 
the 
present 
summer. 
She 
thereupon 
related 
to 
me 
that 
a 
guest 
at 
the 
resort, 
whose 
acquaintance 
she 
had 
made 
a 
short 
time 
previously, 
had 
conducted 
himself 
towards 
her 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
the 
afore-mentioned 
young 
man. 
She 
left 
the 
place 
just 
as 
she 
had 
done 
the 
previous 
year. 


The 
"return 
of 
the 
identical 
" 
(Nietzsche) 
leads 
to 
the 
belief 
that 
the 
patient 
must 
have 
had 
her 
part 
in 
the 
play 
since 
both 
times 
she 
helped 
herself 
out 
of 
the 
situation 
by 
a 
neurotic 
arrangement 
so 
as 
to 
break 
off 
at 
the 
same 
moment. 
In 
this 
connection 
the 
patient 
furnished 
valuable 
support 
in 
the 
statement 
that 
the 
kisses 
exchanged 
had 
not 
irritated 
her. 
I 
showed 
her 
that 
she 
acquiesced 
as 
long 
as 
the 
feminine 
role 
did 
not 
enter 
the 
question. 
I 
explained 
to 
her 
that 
her 
initial 
courage 
was 
the 
masculine 
idea 
of 
conquest 
in 
harmony 
with 
her 
masculine 
aim. 
At 
this 
stage 
her 
insomnia 
vanished. 
She 
communicated 
this 
remarkable 
improvement 
in 
her 
condition 
with 
the 
detracting 
remark, 
that 
now 
she 
would 
like 
to 
sleep 
day 
and 
night. 
Those 
who, 
like 
myself, 
have 
learned 
to 
recognize 
the 
tense 
aggressiveness 
of 
patients 
during 
the 
progress 
of 
a 
psychotherapeutic 
course 
of 
treatment, 
an 
aggressiveness 
which 
is 
directed 
against 
all 
superiors, 
in 
this 
instance 
against 



the 
masculine 
physician, 
and 
who 
have 
thus 
sharpened 
their 
perception 
for 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
neurotics 
express 
themselves, 
will 
not 
misunderstand 
the 
expression 
of 
our 
patient. 
The 
expression 
shows 
distinctly 
that 
she 
has 
detected 
the 
result 
of 
the 
treatment, 
but 
that 
she 
takes 
the 
trouble 
to 
detract 
with 
a 
light 
touch 
from 
this 
result 
and 
hence 
from 
me. 
She 
insinuatingly 
calls 
my 
attention 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
one 
evil 
has 
only 
been 
replaced 
by 
another. 


More 
closely 
questioned 
the 
patient 
stated 
that 
during 
her 
four 
weeks 
of 
insomnia 
she 
had 
constantly 
thought 
during 
her 
wakeful 
nights 
how 
worthless 
life 
was. 
We 
understand 
that 
she 
did 
not 
merely 
think 
of 
it, 
but 
had 
worked 
at 
it. 
Now 
when 
the 
male 
enemy 
in 
the 
form 
of 
the 
physician, 
whom 
she 
subjects 
to 
the 
same 
valuation 
as 
man 
generally, 
confronts 
her 
and 
lays 
bare 
her 
craving 
for 
security 
and 
thus 
undermines 
her 
effort 
to 
gain 
security 
by 
means 
of 
her 
wakefulness, 
she 
tries, 
when 
forced 
to 
sleep, 
to 
belittle 
him 
by 
asserting 
a 
superfluity 
of 
sleep. 


Neurotic 
insomnia 
is 
a 
symbolic 
attempt 
to 
escape 
from 
the 
defenselessness 
of 
sleep 
and 
to 
keep 
in 
mind 
the 
securities 
against 
beneath, 
underneath. 
The 
dream 
is 
another 
form 
of 
this 
effort, 
equal 
to 
a 
compromise, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
covers 
as 
in 
sleep, 
the 
defenselessness 
and 
consequent 
feeling 
of 
inferiority 
by 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
The 
dream, 
according 
to 
my 
observation, 
always 
drives 
towards 
security 
and 
has 
therefore 
the 
function 
of 
forethought. 
That 
this 
is 
accomplished 
through 
the 
medium 
of 
facts 
from 
experience 
is 
easily 
comprehensible, 
and 
thus 
it 
is 
that 
in 
the 
dream 
content 
and 
dream 
thoughts 
the 
defeats 
which 
one 
has 
experienced 
come 
to 
light, 
a 
circumstance 
which 
has 
led 
Freud 
to 
the 
formation 
of 
his 
heuristically 
valuable 
but 
otherwise 
imperfect 
and 
one-sided 
theory 
of 
dreams. 


After 
a 
prolonged 
hesitation 
and 
after 
having 
her 
attention 
called 
to 
the 
negative 
significance 
of 
her 
hesitation, 
the 
patient 
brought 
a 
few 
days 
later 
the 
following 
dream: 
"I 
was 
in 
front 
of 
the 
' 
Steinhoff 
' 
(Vienna's 
great 
insane 
asylum). 
I 
hurry 
fast, 
as 
I 
see 
a 
dark 
form 
within." 


In 
order 
to 
avoid 
all 
artificial 
influencing 
of 
the 
patient, 
especially 
in 
the 
interpretation 
of 
the 
dream, 
I 
avoid 
all 
explanations 
of 
my 
dream 
theory 
and 
only 
refer 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
dream 
rouses 
trains 
of 
thoughts 
which 
betray 
again 
how 
the 
patient 
tries 
to 
secure 
herself 
against 
sleep 
which 
is 
felt 
by 
her 
to 
be 
a 
defenseless 
condition, 
and 
which 
recalls 
to 
her 
her 
defenselessness 
in 
regards 
to 
life. 
In 
cases 
such 
as 
the 
one 
just 
given, 
who 
wish 
above 
all 
to 



discuss 
the 
fear 
of 
the 
feminine 
role, 
I 
indicate 
that 
sleep 
may 
be 
felt 
as 
a 
feminine 
situation. 


The 
figure 
of 
speech, 
" 
lying 
in 
the 
arms 
of 
Morpheus," 
the 
frequent 
sensation 
of 
being 
paralyzed, 
of 
being 
crushed, 
the 
analysis 
of 
nightmares, 
etc., 
and 
the 
feminine 
trends 
which 
I 
am 
able 
to 
discover 
in 
all 
dreams, 
trends 
out 
of 
which 
the 
dream 
raises 
itself 
to 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
and 
where 
furthermore 
the 
advent 
of 
sleep-banishing 
consciousness 
awakens 
an 
individual 
thought-association 
suggesting 
a 
feminine 
situation, 
prove 
with 
certainty 
the 
fact 
that 
every 
dream 
must 
reveal 
a 
progression 
from 
femininity 
to 
masculinity. 
That 
not 
every 
dream 
is 
of 
such 
a 
nature 
as 
to 
convince 
the 
beginner 
of 
the 
correctness 
of 
my 
conception, 
I 
have 
already 
emphasized. 
This 
arises 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
a 
sketch, 
and 
we 
must 
regard 
the 
dream 
as 
such, 
the 
sense 
and 
meaning 
of 
mere 
traces 
of 
ideas 
must 
be 
ferreted 
out 
and 
completed, 
a 
thing 
which 
is 
never 
difficult 
for 
the 
experienced. 
I 
teach 
the 
patient 
that 
he 
must 
regard 
the 
dream 
as 
he 
would 
the 
sketch 
of 
a 
painting, 
the 
details 
of 
which 
he 
is 
obliged 
to 
fill 
in 
according 
to 
his 
impressions. 


After 
this 
explanation 
the 
intelligent 
patient 
proceeded 
unassisted. 
" 
Steinhoff 
means 
insane. 
This 
point 
indicates 
that 
I 
am 
on 
the 
verge 
of 
insanity. 
But 
I 
hasten 
away. 
Then 
what 
you 
always 
tell 
me 
occurs 
to 
me, 
I 
am 
running 
away 
from 
my 
feminine 
role. 
Hence 
becoming 
insane 
and 
the 
feminine 
role 
are 
the 
same 
thing." 
I 
now 
lead 
her 
on 
to 
endeavor 
to 
force 
a 
meaning 
into 
the 
dream, 
and 
for 
this 
purpose 
make 
use 
of 
the 
patient's 
spirit 
of 
rivalry 
which 
is 
known 
to 
me, 
in 
order 
to 
excite 
her 
zeal 
when 
difficulties 
present 
themselves 
by 
saying, 
" 
But 
one 
certainly 
ought 
to 
be 
able 
to 
understand 
something 
under 
that 
idea." 


Patient: 
" 
Perhaps 
that 
it 
would 
be 
insane 
to 
play 
a 
feminine 
role? 
" 


I: 
" 
That 
would 
be 
an 
answer 
to 
a 
question. 
What 
then 
must 
the 
question 
have 
been? 
" 
Patient: 
" 
You 
told 
me 
yesterday, 
I 
should 
not 
be 
afraid 
of 
my 
feminine 
role." 


I: 
" 
Therefore 
an 
answer 
directed 
against 
me, 
in 
line 
with 
our 
conversations, 
a 
conflict 
against 
the 
man. 
And 
the 
black 
figure?" 
Patient: 
" 
Perhaps 
death? 
" 


I: 
" 
Try 
now 
to 
fit 
death 
into 
the 
situation." 

This 
was 
difficult 
for 
the 
patient, 
although 
it 
is 
wholly 
clear 
that 
she 
has 
taken 
the 
fear 
of 
death 
as 
a 
figure 
for 
her 
flight 
from 
the 
feminine 
role, 
in 
order 
to 
present 
it 
in 
a 
sufficiently 
strong 
manner. 
The 
connection 
of 
sexuality 
and 
death 
is 
often 
spoken 
of 
in 
philosophy 
and 
poetry. 
The 
analysis 
of 
neurotics 
often 
indicate 
this 
connection 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
an 
affect 
accentuating 
" 
conditional 
proposition." 


The 
sense 
of 
the 
dream 
is 
now 
shown 
to 
be 
an 
expedient 
directed 
against 
the 
physician, 
which 
with 
our 
knowledge 
of 
the 
patient's 
phantasy-life 
should 
be 
made 
to 
read: 
"It 
would 
be 
insane 
to 
submit 
to 
a 
man, 
equal 
to 
death." 
But 
according 
to 
her 
estimation, 
she 
had 
already 
submitted 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
she 
had 
slept 
since 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
treatment. 
This 
dream 
therefore 
revolts 
against 
sleep, 
and 
her 
derogatory 
remark 
that 
she 
would 
now 
like 
to 
sleep 
day 
and 
night, 
is 
in 
line 
with 
this. 
Therefore 
the 
neurotic 
predispositions 
of 
this 
patient 
against 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
man 
winning 
influence 
over 
her 
is 
laid 
bare, 
and 
it 
is 
shown 
that 
the 
patient 
acted 
and 
dreamed 
as 
though 
she 
were 
conscious 
of 
her 
guiding 
purpose. 
* 


*Richard 
Warner's 
genius-like 
intuition 
in 
the 
song 
of 
Erda. 
"My 
life 
is 
dreaming, 
my 
dreaming 
is 
thinking, 
my 
thinking 
the 
control 
of 
knowledge." 


This 
essential 
predisposition, 
her 
tendency 
to 
detract, 
her 
longing 
for 
victory 
over 
men 
and 
her 
neurotic 
craving 
for 
security, 
which 
stands 
menacing 
in 
the 
background 
with 
the 
terror 
of 
death 
and 
insanity, 
had 
also 
caused 
the 
development 
of 
the 
neurosis 
as 
a 
strengthened 
security. 
Through 
it 
the 
patient 
is 
unfitted 
for 
life. 
The 
neurotic 
apperception, 
which 
conjures 
up 
a 
connection 
between 
love, 
insanity 
and 
death 
has 
something 
of 
the 
ring 
of 
poetry. 
How 
firmly 
fixed 
this 
is 
in 
the 
thoughts 
of 
the 
patient 
is 
shown 
in 
her 
first 
account: 
the 
young 
man 
had 
fallen 
upon 
her 
as 
though 
he 
were 
insane. 


It 
is 
often 
learned 
from 
the 
anamneses 
of 
male 
neurotics 
that 
they 
had 
been 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
a 
strong 
woman, 
mother, 
teacher, 
sister, 
who 
therefore, 
instead 
of 
their 
feminine 
role 
or 
in 
addition 
thereto, 
played 
a 
masculine 
one, 
were 
above, 
and 
to 
whom 
the 
environment 
did 
not 
deny 
recognition, 
sometimes 
even 
disapprobation, 
showing 
that 
they 
were 
really 
regarded 
as 
men. 
This 
circumstance 
also 
often 
tends 
to 
strengthen 
the 
uncertainty 
of 
the 
neurotically 
disposed 
child, 
who 
tries 
to 
arrive 
at 
a 
conviction 
of 
his 
manliness 
by 
understanding 
the 
sexual 
differences. 
Especially 
when 
one 
endeavors 
to 
gain 
security 
through 
knowledge 
a 
certain 



sex 
inquisitiveness 
forces 
him 
to 
constantly 
seek 
visual 
confirmation 
of 
his 
sexual 
superiority, 
a 
necessity 
of 
obtaining 
definite 
knowledge 
and 
full 
comprehension 
of 
the 
female 
organs 
which 
approaches 
the 
masculine 
guiding 
line 
more 
nearly, 
in 
proportion 
as 
it 
is 
created 
out 
of 
preparations 
for 
the 
future. 


His 
pathological 
uncertainty 
adheres 
to 
the 
neurotic 
as 
a 
pretext 
and 
confirmation 
of 
his 
fear 
of 
woman 
even 
after 
he 
is 
married, 
so 
that 
the 
expression 
is 
often 
heard, 
that 
the 
feminine 
sexual 
apparatus, 
the 
condition 
of 
virginity, 
legitimacy 
of 
children, 
fatherhood, 
is 
a 
mystery 
just 
as 
a 
woman 
herself 
is. 
Along 
with 
this 
desire 
to 
obtain 
satisfaction 
through 
visual 
perception 
of 
the 
female 
organs, 
there 
is 
at 
times 
associated 
in, 
neurotically 
disposed 
children 
a 
sort 
of 
sinister 
feeling 
of 
danger, 
as 
though 
obscure 
thoughts 
arose 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
the 
boy, 
that 
his 
future 
life, 
his 
victory 
or 
defeat 
were 
dependent 
upon 
the 
solution 
he 
has 
reached 
concerning 
the 
sexual 
question. 
It 
is 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
things, 
that 
frequently 
the 
opportunity 
for 
this 
sort 
of 
visual 
confirmation 
is 
only 
offered 
when 
the 
woman 
occupies 
a 
position 
above 
the 
boy. 
Even 
this 
small 
circumstance 
forms, 
as 
I 
have 
repeatedly 
stated, 
a 
figurative 
representation 
of 
the 
feminine 
superiority 
in 
the 
phantasy 
of 
the 
neurotic 
individual 
who 
stands 
in 
fear 
of 
woman. 
Ganghofer 
and 
Stendhal 
give 
accounts 
in 
the 
history 
of 
their 
childhood 
of 
these 
terrifying 
experiences 
which, 
it 
is 
thought, 
left 
behind 
permanent 
traces. 
The 
terror 
was 
in 
itself 
already 
a 
security 
of 
the 
injured 
masculine 
prestige, 
and 
the 
exciting 
scene 
remained 
as 
an 
admonition, 
to 
be 
understood 
figuratively, 
of 
caution 
in 
regard 
to 
women. 
Frequently 
the 
derogatory 
tendency 
sets 
in 
at 
the 
point 
where 
the 
superiority 
of 
woman 
assumes 
a 
threatening 
aspect 
and 
leads 
to 
a 
comparison 
of 
male 
and 
female 
advantages 
and 
disadvantages. 
The 
abstract 
and 
figurative 
representation 
of 
the 
inferiority 
of 
woman, 
in 
dreams, 
phantasies, 
wit 
and 
science, 
frequently 
resorts 
to 
the 
mode 
of 
expression 
of 
a 
lost 
member, 
of 
supernumerary 
cavities. 
One 
of 
my 
patients 
who 
suffered 
from 
vertigo 
had 
a 
dream 
one 
time 
following 
an 
unusually 
stormy 
scene 
with 
his 
wife 
which 
summarily 
and 
essentially 
brought 
about 
a 
degradation 
of 
his 
domineering 
wife. 


"The 
picture 
of 
a 
birch 
trunk 
emerged. 
At 
one 
point 
there 
was 
a 
branch 
with 
a 
round 
swelling. 
There 
a 
twig 
had 
fallen 
off 
and 
I 
had 
the 
impression 
as 
though 
this 
was 
a 
female 
genital 
organ." 



I 
have 
already 
discussed 
such 
dreams, 
as 
have 
others 
also. 
To 
me 
such 
dreams 
represent 
figuratively 
the 
question 
concerning 
the 
differences 
of 
sex, 
which 
is 
answered 
after 
the 
manner 
of 
children 
that 
the 
girl 
is 
a 
boy 
who 
has 
been 
deprived 
of 
the 
male 
organ. 
The 
above 
dream 
fits 
into 
the 
psychic 
situation 
of 
the 
dreamer, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
reveals 
the 
thought, 
' 
' 
I 
am 
a 
man 
who 
has 
been 
deprived 
of 
manliness, 
who 
is 
weak 
and 
ill, 
who 
is 
in 
danger 
of 
being 
under, 
of 
falling 
beneath." 
Now 
he 
has 
the 
basis 
of 
operation, 
he 
beholds 
his 
prestige 
diminished 
and 
takes 
breath, 
for 
the 
effort 
again 
to 
regain 
power. 
The 
masculine 
protest 
now 
sets 
in 
in 
waking 
hours 
as 
tyranny, 
outbreaks 
of 
rage 
and 
acts 
of 
infidelity. 


It 
might 
be 
mentioned 
in 
this 
connection 
that 
one 
often 
hears 
from 
neurotics 
that 
in 
moments 
of 
personal 
danger 
or 
when 
they 
are 
threatened 
with 
defeat, 
they 
perceive 
a 
shortening 
or 
contraction 
of 
the 
genitals, 
at 
times 
also 
a 
feeling 
of 
pain 
which 
forcibly 
impels 
them 
to 
a 
termination 
of 
the 
situation.* 


* 
At 
times 
this 
feeling 
of 
pressure 
extends 
to 
the 
abdomen, 
to 
the 
breast 
and 
the 
cardiac 
region 
or 
affects 
only 
these 
regions, 
at 
times 
pollutions 
take 
place 
as 
reactive 
symbols 
of 
the 
masculine 
goal. 
These 
phenomena 
most 
frequently 
accompany 
states 
of 
anxiety 
in 
high 
places 
where 
there 
is 
fear 
of 
falling. 
The 
shortening 
of 
the 
genitals 
in 
the 
bath 
nearly 
always 
causes 
a 
reaction 
in 
the 
neurotic 
individual. 
He 
feels 
out 
of 
sorts 
and 
at 
times 
experiences 
pressure 
in 
the 
head. 


I 
have 
already 
emphasized 
that 
homosexuality 
as 
a 
tendency 
and 
behavior 
is 
the 
result 
of 
the 
fear 
of 
the 
opposite 
sex. 
In 
addition 
it 
may 
be 
briefly 
mentioned 
that 
the 
over-valuation 
of 
the 
homosexual 
partner 
serves 
also 
to 
raise 
the 
neurotic 
invert 
in 
his 
own 
estimation. 
In 
neuroses 
homosexuality 
even 
when 
carried 
into 
practice 
is 
always 
found 
to 
be 
a 
symbol 
by 
means 
of 
which 
it 
is 
sought 
to 
place 
the 
individual's 
own 
superiority 
beyond 
question. 
This 
mechanism 
is 
similar 
to 
that 
of 
a 
religious 
psychosis 
in 
which 
the 
nearness 
of 
God 
has 
the 
significance 
of 
an 
elevation. 


One 
of 
the 
forms 
which 
the 
fear 
of 
woman 
is 
especially 
likely 
to 
take 
is 
syphilophobia. 
The 
train 
of 
thought 
of 
such 
phobists 
(Adler, 
syphilidophobia, 


1. 
c.) 
is 
usually 
the 
following: 
They 
fear 
that 
they 
will 
not 
be 
able 
to 
play 
a 
dominating 
part 
in 
regard 
to 
woman 
because 
of 
some 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 

for 
which 
they 
have 
ready 
all 
sorts 
of 
foundations, 
at 
times 
without 
conscious 
motivation. 
In 
this 
manner, 
following 
the 
increasing 
trend 
to 
belittle 
woman, 
they 
arrive 
at 
suspicious 
trains 
of 
thought 
which 
are 
to 
secure 
them 
against 
sexual 
relations. 
Sometimes 
woman 
is 
a 
riddle, 
sometimes 
a 
criminal 
being, 
always 
thinking 
of 
adornment 
and 
expense 
and 
sexually 
insatiable. 
The 
suspicions 
constantly 
arise 
that 
a 
girl 
is 
only 
hunting 
for 
support, 
is 
bent 
on 
capturing 
the 
man, 
is 
crafty 
and 
cunning 
and 
always 
bent 
on 
evil. 
These 
trains 
of 
thought 
are 
universal 
and 
are 
found 
at 
all 
periods 
of 
history. 
They 
emerge 
in 
the 
most 
sublime 
and 
the 
lowest 
creations 
of 
art, 
have 
a 
place 
in 
the 
thoughts 
and 
efforts 
of 
the 
wisest, 
and 
create 
in 
man 
and 
in 
society 
a 
constant 
predisposition 
which 
develops 
suspicious 
and 
cautious 
traits, 
in 
order 
to 
always 
keep 
in 
touch 
with 
the 
enemy 
and 
to 
be 
in 
good 
time 
for 
the 
defense 
against 
knavish 
attacks. 
It 
is 
an 
error 
to 
think 
that 
it 
is 
only 
the 
man 
who 
harbors 
distrust 
of 
his 
sexual 
partner. 
The 
same 
trait 
is 
found 
also 
in 
the 
woman, 
often 
less 
distinct 
in 
character, 
when 
fictions 
of 
her 
own 
strength 
put 
a 
check 
to 
the 
doubt 
of 
her 
own 
value, 
but 
flashing 
up 
most 
strongly, 
when 
the 
feeling 
of 
degradation 
becomes 
overpowering. 


In 
the 
disputes 
of 
pious 
savants 
of 
the 
middle 
ages, 
questions 
arose 
as 
to 
whether 
woman 
had 
a 
soul, 
whether 
she 
was 
a 
human 
being, 
and 
the 
general 
prevalence 
of 
similar 
thoughts 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
insane 
burning 
of 
witches 
in 
the 
centuries 
following 
to 
which 
government, 
church 
and 
the 
blinded 
populace 
lent 
a 
hand. 
This 
detraction 
from 
women 
in 
hate 
as 
well 
as 
in 
love 
which 
recurs 
constantly 
in 
Christian, 
Jewish 
and 
Mohammedan 
religious 
usages, 
break 
out 
irresistibly 
in 
the 
timorous, 
uncertain 
man 
and 
so 
completely 
fills 
the 
world 
of 
thought 
of 
the 
neurotic, 
that 
the 
most 
accentuated 
trait 
of 
character 
in 
the 
neurotic 
psyche 
is 
found 
to 
be 
the 
tendency 
to 
detract 
from 
the 
sexual 
partner. 
Thus 
the 
outposts 
which 
offer 
security 
to 
the 
ego-consciousness 
become 
established 
and 
the 
peculiar 
play 
of 
the 
neurotic 
traits 
of 
character 
begins. 
Continuous 
testing, 
feeling, 
attempts 
to 
subjugate, 
to 
find 
fault 
with 
and 
to 
degrade 
the 
partner 
set 
in, 
always 
favored 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
attention 
and 
interest 
is 
directed 
to 
a 
single 
purpose, 
to 
keep 
in 
touch 
with 
the 
enemy 
and 
to 
prevent 
a 
surprise. 
As 
long 
as 
the 
tendency 
to 
detraction 
with 
its 
outward 
expressions, 
distrust, 
fear, 
jealousy, 
tyranny 
exists 
there 
is 
no 
hope 
of 
a 
cure 
of 
the 
neurotic. 
As 
we 
have 
seen 
worthy 
creations 
of 
art 
and 
literature 
which 
have 
received 
recognition 
on 
all 
sides 
owe 
their 



origin 
to 
this 
tendency. 


From 
the 
" 
Lysistrata 
" 
to 
the 
" 
kreuzel 
writers 
" 
leads 
the 
same 
path 
as 
from 
the 
Gorgo 
Medusa 
to 
the 
Syphilis 
fad, 
which 
arose 
before 
the 
eyes 
of 
Lenans 
or 
Ganghofer. 
The 
guiding 
line 
which 
prevails 
in 
Tolstoi's 
Kreutzer 
Sonata 
and 
which 
strives 
after 
the 
degradation 
of 
woman 
was 
perceptible 
even 
in 
his 
boyhood 
when 
he 
shoved 
his 
future 
bride 
out 
of 
the 
window. 
An 
old 
guiding 
line 
which 
is 
revealed 
in 
the 
myth 
of 
the 
poison-girl* 
of 
antiquity, 
in 
the 
middle 
ages 
and 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
modern 
times 
in 
the 
fear 
of 
witches, 
demons, 
vampires 
and 
sprites 
has 
undergone 
a 
change 
of 
form 
and 
has 
become 
the 
syphilophobia 
of 
to-day. 
Poggio 
relates 
of 
a 
man 
who 
had 
violated 
a 
girl. 
The 
girl 
changed 
into 
a 
devil 
and 
vanished 
with 
a 
stench. 


*Wilhelm 
Hertz, 
"The 
Myth 
of 
the 
Poison-girl." 
Abh. 
d. 
bayer 
Akademic 
der 
WissenBchaften, 
1897. 


All 
these 
trains 
of 
thought 
returning 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
they 
do 
in 
the 
dream 
and 
in 
the 
psyche 
of 
the 
neurotic, 
reveal 
the 
cautious 
man, 
doubtful 
of 
his 
manliness, 
who 
seeks 
to 
secure 
himself 
from 
real 
life 
just 
as 
much 
by 
the 
setting 
up 
of 
scarecrows 
as 
by 
the 
fear 
he 
has 
of 
this 
life 
itself, 
because 
of 
the 
veneration 
of 
an 
ideal. 


The 
bantering 
note 
in 
such 
an 
attitude 
toward 
woman 
is 
of 
little 
significance 
in 
so 
far 
as 
our 
view 
is 
concerned. 
It 
shows 
moreover 
an 
effort 
to 
be 
guilty 
of 
no 
exaggeration, 
to 
preserve 
decorum 
and 
to 
save 
one's 
self 
from 
ridicule 
by 
a 
spirit 
of 
wit. 


The 
case 
is 
similar 
to 
that 
of 
Gogol 
whose 
strong 
craving 
for 
security 
is 
perceptible 
in 
every 
vein 
of 
his 
poetry. 
In 
his 
'Jahrmarkt 
von 
Sorotschinsk’ 
(*From 
O. 
Kaus, 
"The 
Case 
of 
Gogol," 
Munchen, 
Reinhardt, 
1912) 
he 
makes 
a 
character 
say, 
"Lord 
in 
heaven, 
why 
dost 
thou 
punish 
us 
poor 
sinners 
so? 
There 
is 
already 
so 
much 
trouble, 
why 
didst 
thou 
also 
send 
women 
into 
the 
world?" 
In 
the 
"Dead 
Souls" 
of 
this 
great 
poet, 
who 
was 
neurotic 
during 
his 
entire 
life, 
suffered 
from 
compulsory 
masturbation 
and 
died 
in 
a 
mad 
house, 
he 
makes 
his 
hero 
reflect 
on 
seeing 
a 
young 
girl: 


"A 
superb 
little 
woman! 
The 
best 
about 
her 
is 
that 
she 
seems 
to 
have 
just 
come 
out 
of 
a 
boarding 
school 
or 
institute 
and 
as 
yet 
has 
none 
of 
those 
special 
feminine 
traits 
that 
disfigure 
the 
whole 
sex. 
She 
is 
still 
a 
pure 
child, 
everything 
about 
her 
is 
straightforward 
and 
simple; 
she 
speaks 
from 
her 
heart 



and 
laughs 
when 
she 
feels 
like 
it. 
All 
possibilities 
lie 
in 
her 
nature; 
she 
may 
become 
a 
superb 
creature 
but 
she 
may 
become 
a 
stunted 
being 
and 
that 
will 
probably 
be 
the 
result 
when 
the 
aunts 
and 
mammas 
set 
themselves 
to 
educate 
her. 
They 
will 
stuff 
her 
so 
full 
of 
their 
woman's 
nonsense 
in 
a 
year 
that 
her 
own 
father 
would 
no 
longer 
recognize 
her. 
She 
will 
acquire 
a 
pompous 
and 
affected 
nature, 
will 
turn 
and 
move 
and 
courtesy 
according 
to 
rules 
learned 
by 
heart, 
rack 
her 
brains 
over 
the 
questions, 
what 
to 
say, 
how 
much 
to 
say, 
and 
with 
whom 
to 
speak, 
and 
how 
she 
shall 
look 
at 
her 
cavalier, 
etc., 
she 
will 
constantly 
be 
in 
the 
greatest 
anxiety 
lest 
she 
may 
have 
spoken 
some 
superfluous 
word, 
and 
finally 
will 
no 
longer 
know 
what 
she 
ought 
to 
do 
and 
will 
go 
wandering 
through 
life, 
a 
great 
lie. 
Fie! 
the 
devil! 
For 
the 
rest 
I 
would 
like 
to 
know, 
of 
what 
sort 
she 
is!" 



CHAPTER 
IX 
SELF-REPROACHES, 
SELF-TORTURE, 
CONTRITION 
AND 
ASCETICISM, 
FLAGELLATION, 
NEUROSES 
IN 
CHILDREN; 
SUICIDE 
AND 
SUICIDAL 
IDEAS 


UNDER 
the 
forms 
of 
the 
neurotic 
lines 
of 
conduct 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
securing 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
trends 
of 
self-execration, 
self-reproach, 
self-
torture 
and 
suicide 
appear 
in 
marked 
accentuation. 
Our 
astonishment 
loses 
in 
force 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
see 
that 
the 
whole 
arrangement 
of 
the 
neurosis 
follows 
the 
trait 
of 
self-torture, 
that 
the 
neurosis 
is 
a 
self-torturing 
expedient 
whose 
purpose 
it 
is 
to 
enhance 
the 
feeling 
of 
personal 
esteem. 
In 
fact, 
the 
first 
stirrings 
of 
the 
aggressive 
tendency 
which 
is 
directed 
against 
the 
individual's 
own 
person, 
originate 
in 
the 
child 
from 
a 
situation 
in 
which 
the 
child 
through 
disease, 
death, 
shame 
and 
all 
sorts 
of 
constructed 
deficiencies 
seeks 
to 
prepare 
pain 
for 
the 
parents 
or 
to 
keep 
himself 
in 
their 
mind. 
This 
trait 
already 
characterizes 
the 
neurotically 
disposed 
child 
who 
has 
formed 
expedients 
out 
of 
the 
reminiscences 
of 
the 
phenomena 
of 
somatic 
inferiority 
and 
out 
of 
their 
significance 
for 
the 
maximation 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
increasing 
the 
tenderness 
and 
interest 
of 
the 
parents. 
The 
developed 
neurosis 
builds 
up 
these 
expedients 
and 
introduces 
their 
activity 
through 
a 
reinforcement 
of 
the 
fiction, 
as 
soon 
as 
this 
is 
demanded 
by 
the 
growing 
feeling 
of 
insecurity. 
It 
is 
well 
known 
how 
strong 
exacerbations 
take 
a 
hand 
in 
this, 
how 
the 
hallucinatory 
character, 
the 
anticipatory 
force 
of 
the 
neurotic 
assists 
in 
this 
and 
how 
the 
situation 
of 
the 
attack 
and 
the 
disturbances 
of 
health 
with 
the 
resultant 
dominancy 
over 
the 
environment 
takes 
place. 
Paradoxical 
as 
it 
may 
seem 
at 
first 
glance 
the 
neurotic 
is 
only 
at 
peace 
when 
he 
has 
an 
attack 
behind 
him. 
Janet 
has 
already 
called 
attention 
to 
this 
fact; 
I 
can 
only 
add 
as 
the 
basis 
for 
it 
that 
it 
is 
because 
he 
has 
then 
gained 
the 
security 
of 
his 
superiority, 
if 
only 
for 
a 
short 
time. 


The 
trait 
of 
character 
of 
wishing 
to 
excel 
all 
others 
is 
also 
contained 
in 
the 
feeling 
to 
which 
the 
neurotic 
constantly 
gives 
expression, 
that 
he 
excels 
all 
others 
in 
pain. 
He 
uses 
this 
conviction 
because 
it 
furnishes 
him 
with 
a 
basis 
of 
operation 
for 
feeling 
himself 
in 
opposition 
to 
others, 
for 
avoiding 
a 



decision 
or 
for 
making 
an 
attack. 
Thus 
it 
happens 
also 
that 
attacks, 
pains, 
or 
a 
disease 
are 
wished 
for, 
when 
the 
situation 
demands 
it. 
Sometimes 
the 
wish 
alone 
serves 
the 
purpose 
of 
an 
attack, 
when 
as 
a 
reminder 
it 
already 
terrifies 
the 
environment. 
For 
the 
patient's 
own 
psyche 
it 
is 
at 
times 
sufficient, 
as 
a 
female 
patient 
once 
told 
me, 
if 
a 
phantasy 
is 
formed 
as 
result 
of 
which 
the 
neurotic 
suffers 
pain 
through 
the 
acts 
of 
another. 
This 
brings 
about 
the 
feeling 
of 
suppression 
or 
mistreatment, 
awakens 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
and 
introduces 
the 
masculine 
protest. 


The 
significance 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
guilt, 
of 
the 
conscience 
and 
self-
reproaches 
as 
forms 
of 
security-giving 
fictions 
has 
already 
been 
described. 
Not 
rarely 
one 
finds 
in 
the 
psychology 
of 
masturbation 
an 
admixture 
of 
traits 
of 
atonement 
and 
of 
a 
desire 
to 
harm, 
the 
latter 
to 
be 
likened 
to 
an 
obstinate 
revolt 
against 
the 
parents, 
the 
former 
as 
a 
cheap 
pretext 
or 
sanctimonious 
act. 


The 
injuring 
of 
others 
through 
atonement 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
subtle 
expedients 
of 
the 
neurotic, 
for 
example 
when 
he 
launches 
forth 
in 
self-curses. 
Ideas 
of 
suicide 
often 
reveal 
the 
same 
mechanism, 
which 
is 
clearly 
seen 
in 
joint 
suicides. 
When 
one 
of 
my 
patients 
was 
treated 
by 
another 
physician 
with 
cold 
douches 
for 
impotence, 
he 
expressed 
the 
wish 
' 
' 
that 
the 
physician 
might 
tear, 
injure 
his 
genitals." 
When 
two 
years 
before 
he 
had 
suffered 
great 
losses 
in 
business 
he 
wished 
to 
commit 
suicide, 
although 
he 
was 
still 
a 
rich 
man. 
The 
motive 
force 
of 
these 
execrations 
(v. 
Shylock) 
is 
neurotic 
avarice. 
The 
analysis 
offers 
a 
complete 
explanation. 
In 
order 
to 
protect 
himself 
from 
expenses 
for 
girls 
he 
execrates 
himself 
also 
when 
he 
is 
obliged 
to 
pay 
physicians' 
fees. 
This 
is 
certainly 
accompanied 
by 
a 
half 
conscious 
feeling 
that 
his 
wishes 
need 
not 
be 
absolutely 
fulfilled. 
He 
execrates 
especially 
his 
levity, 
for 
this 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
his 
self-reproaches 
and 
execrations, 
when 
he 
has 
paid 
a 
large 
account 
or 
ought 
to 
pay 
one. 
Then 
every 
small 
expense 
disturbs 
him. 


He 
fears 
the 
charm 
of 
sexuality. 
Even 
his 
own 
sister 
he 
would 
like 
to 
throw 
into 
misfortune, 
or 
his 
sister's 
daughter, 
both 
of 
whom 
lived 
with 
him. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
he 
must 
have 
estimated 
his 
execrations 
as 
of 
very 
little 
importance 
or 
perhaps 
even 
expected 
the 
opposite. 
This 
is 
shown 
by 
the 
great 
number 
of 
his 
measures 
for 
security, 
among 
which 
the 
self-execrations 
only 
played 
an 
insignificant 
part. 
He 
secures 
himself 
to 
a 
much 
greater 
extent 
through 
the 
arrangement 
of 
impotence. 
Self-detraction 
and 
self-torture 
our 



patient 
constructed 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
hypochondria, 
in 
order 
to 
hold 
before 
his 
eyes 
the 
feeling 
of 
his 
own 
inferiority, 
to 
feel 
himself 
too 
weak, 
too 
small, 
too 
unworthy. 
They 
appear 
as 
hindrances 
and 
in 
this 
way 
take 
the 
place 
of 
doubts. 
Neurotic 
girls 
who 
fear 
the 
man, 
who 
do 
not 
wish 
to 
play 
a 
feminine 
role, 
worry 
constantly 
over 
their 
growth 
of 
hair, 
their 
birth 
marks 
and 
fear 
their 
children 
might 
be 
similarly 
deformed. 
In 
many 
cases 
they 
were 
homely 
children 
or 
were 
slighted 
for 
a 
preferred 
brother 
when 
they 
were 
small 
girls. 
In 
one 
of 
my 
female 
patients 
with 
a 
compulsion 
neurosis, 
her 
compulsory 
thought 
was 
revealed 
as 
belief 
in 
an 
enlargement 
of 
the 
pores 
of 
her 
skin, 
to 
be 
understood 
symbolically 
as 
a 
security 
against 
the 
feminine 
role. 
Another 
form 
of 
self-torture 
is 
manifested 
in 
the 
tendency 
to 
atonements. 
They 
may 
be 
recognized 
as 
simple 
cravings 
for 
security 
when 
it 
is 
taken 
into 
consideration 
that 
these 
patients 
seek 
just 
as 
little 
as 
those 
with 
the 
allied 
feeling 
of 
remorse 
for 
the 
past, 
to 
change 
or 
better 
things 
in 
the 
future. 


The 
symptom 
clearly 
aims 
at 
the 
future, 
and 
this 
just 
as 
much 
when 
it 
reveals 
itself 
as 
of 
personal 
emotion 
in 
individual 
form 
and 
conduct 
as 
when 
it 
is 
revealed 
socially 
in 
religious 
performances. 
As 
in 
all 
forms 
of 
craving 
for 
security, 
in 
this 
case 
too, 
it 
is 
not 
at 
all 
excluded 
that 
recently 
experienced 
evil 
thoughts 
and 
acts 
come 
to 
light. 
Its 
purpose 
is 
to 
become 
effective 
as 
a 
restraining 
admonition 
and 
to 
serve 
as 
proof 
of 
the 
worthy 
intentions 
of 
the 
one 
concerned. 
Not 
last 
of 
all 
in 
this 
self-inspection 
is 
the 
impulse 
to 
atonement 
and 
the 
emphasis 
of 
inner 
good 
qualities 
wherein 
the 
contrast 
to 
other 
people 
is 
always 
thought 
of, 
so 
much 
so, 
that 
the 
tendency 
to 
atonement 
and 
remorse 
at 
times 
betrays 
a 
strongly 
antagonistic, 
intractable, 
inimical 
note. 
The 
epidemic 
character 
of 
acts 
of 
atonement 
is 
scarcely 
ever 
without 
this 
pomp, 
people 
vie 
with 
each 
other 
in 
crying 
out, 
weeping, 
in 
self-torture 
and 
contrition. 


The 
possibility 
therefore 
of 
gaining 
a 
feeling 
of 
superiority 
by 
means 
of 
fasting 
and 
praying, 
wearing 
of 
sackcloth 
and 
ashes, 
etc., 
will 
have 
a 
charm 
for 
weak 
souls 
as 
soon 
as 
they 
have 
the 
inclination 
to 
appear 
pious 
and 
good, 
religious 
and 
sublime. 
And 
asceticism 
will 
lead 
to 
an 
elevation 
when 
it 
is 
felt 
as 
a 
triumph, 
in 
my 
sense, 
as 
a 
masculine 
protest. 
That 
in 
all 
this 
there 
is 
only 
an 
arbitrary 
valuation, 
in 
which 
frequently 
the 
contrast 
to 
otherwise 
superior 
people 
is 
taken 
as 
the 
point 
of 
departure, 
is 
revealed 
in 
the 
counterparts 
to 
the 



God-fearing 
type, 
in 
atheists, 
militant 
freethinkers 
and 
iconoclasts 
who 
seek 
to 
demonstrate 
their 
superiority 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
the 
former. 
Lichtenberg's 
expression 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
in 
this 
sense 
when 
he 
remarks, 
how 
rare 
are 
the 
people 
who 
live 
up 
to 
the 
principles 
of 
their 
religion, 
and 
how 
numerous 
those 
who 
fight 
for 
them. 
The 
conversion 
from 
militant 
freethinking 
to 
orthodoxy 
is 
not 
rare 
as 
is 
also 
not 
rare 
the 
conversion 
from 
Epicurianism 
to 
Asceticism. 


Along 
with 
this 
craving 
for 
security 
by 
means 
of 
atonement 
the 
masculine 
protest 
plays 
a 
role 
as 
a 
guide 
which 
should 
not 
be 
underestimated. 
But 
one 
must 
still 
keep 
in 
sight 
the 
building 
material, 
the 
possibilities 
dormant 
in 
the 
psyche, 
of 
which 
it 
makes 
use 
in 
order 
to 
reach 
expression. 
There 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
along 
with 
this, 
acts 
and 
thoughts 
of 
self-subjection 
come 
to 
light, 
that 
is, 
masochistic 
elements, 
which 
according 
to 
our 
way 
of 
looking 
at 
the 
subject 
are 
estimated 
as 
feminine 
elements 
of 
the 
masculine 
psyche. 
How 
incompatible 
these 
are 
with 
the 
consciousness 
of 
mankind 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
constantly 
demand 
a 
change 
of 
direction 
in 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
that 
therefore, 
they 
are 
pseudo-masochistic 
phenomena, 
is 
seen 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
this 
subjection 
is 
connected 
with 
a 
soaring, 
an 
elevation. 
The 
lines 
of 
force 
also 
in 
this 
case 
were 
from 
below 
upwards 
because 
the 
person 
who 
has 
made 
atonement 
feels 
himself 
elevated 
or 
cleansed, 
he 
speaks 
with 
his 
God, 
he 
comes 
nearer 
to 
him 
than 
others, 
than 
at 
other 
times, 
and 
"joy 
in 
the 
kingdom 
of 
heaven 
awaits 
him." 


One 
of 
my 
patients 
"punished 
herself" 
after 
the 
death 
of 
her 
mother, 
72 
years 
of 
age, 
with 
whom 
she 
had 
always 
lived 
at 
strife 
and 
to 
whom 
she 
would 
have 
been 
justified 
in 
making 
reproaches, 
by 
deep 
feelings 
of 
remorse 
because 
of 
her 
indifference 
for 
her 
mother, 
and 
by 
sleeplessness. 
Her 
feelings 
of 
remorse 
had 
the 
character 
of 
compulsory 
thoughts 
and 
compulsory 
acts. 
The 
analysis 
showed 
that 
she 
wished 
to 
prove 
her 
normal 
superiority 
over 
a 
sister. 
The 
sister 
was 
married, 
while 
our 
patient 
was 
tempted 
to 
enter 
into 
a 
liaison 
with 
a 
married 
man 
which 
experience 
she 
felt 
as 
a 
degradation. 
She 
was, 
therefore, 
according 
to 
her 
own 
opinion 
degraded 
in 
contrast 
to 
her 
sister. 
On 
the 
occasion 
of 
the 
death 
of 
her 
mother 
the 
masculine 
protest 
gave 
rise 
to 
a 
situation 
which 
again 
brought 
her 
uppermost, 
namely, 
her 
stronger 
grief 
for 
the 
sad 
event. 


In 
the 
history 
of 
civilization 
as 
in 
the 
neurosis, 
the 
tendency 
to 
atonement 



not 
rarely 
degenerates 
in 
scourging, 
flagellation, 
etc. 
From 
the 
confessions 
of 
Rousseau 
and 
from 
private 
communications 
of 
healthy 
as 
well 
as 
neurotic 
individuals, 
and 
furthermore 
from 
good 
observations 
of 
the 
behavior 
of 
children, 
as 
for 
example 
B. 
Asnaurow's, 
we 
know 
that 
in 
certain 
individuals 
blows 
are 
capable 
of 
arousing 
sexual 
excitations. 
This 
is 
the 
real, 
somatically 
perceptible 
moment 
which 
exists 
in 
the 
makeup 
of 
these 
individuals 
and 
which 
determines 
the 
choice 
of 
.a 
particular 
form 
of 
atonement. 
Patients 
have 
told 
me 
that 
in 
their 
childhood 
they 
experienced 
pleasure 
from 
blows 
on 
their 
buttocks, 
though 
it 
was 
terrible 
to 
them 
to 
be 
beaten. 
In 
the 
later 
life 
of 
these 
neurotics 
flagellation 
analogously 
with 
masturbation 
and 
all 
other 
forms 
of 
perversions 
is 
the 
visible 
expression 
of 
the 
fear 
of 
the 
opposite 
partner. 
I 
am 
indebted 
to 
a 
patient 
for 
the 
following 
communication. 
She 
had 
come 
under 
my 
care 
for 
severe 
migraine. 
Several 
years 
before 
the 
onset 
of 
the 
treatment 
she 
was 
subject 
to 
day-phantasies 
in 
which 
she 
saw 
herself 
detected 
in 
an 
act 
of 
infidelity 
and 
punished 
by 
a 
man 
to 
whom 
she 
thought 
herself 
married 
but 
who 
did 
not 
resemble 
her 
real 
husband. 
As 
a 
sequel 
to 
this 
phantasy 
there 
followed 
a 
severe 
self-scourging 
until 
she 
fell 
exhausted. 
This 
flagellation 
brought 
about 
intense 
sexual 
emotions. 
The 
analysis 
revealed 
that 
this 
woman 
hated 
her 
husband, 
a 
neurotic 
hatred, 
and 
in 
this 
hatred 
would 
have 
readily 
committed 
an 
act 
of 
infidelity 
in 
order 
to 
humiliate 
him 
thereby. 
Now 
she 
has 
gotten 
to 
be 
too 
old 
to 
be 
of 
any 
worth 
in 
sex 
matters, 
while 
in 
former 
years 
she 
was 
hindered 
by 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
For 
a 
short 
time 
before 
she 
thought 
of 
flagellation, 
she 
played 
with 
phantasies 
of 
infidelity, 
but 
not 
without 
securing 
herself 
against 
a 
realization. 
The 
detection 
by 
the 
husband, 
the 
flagellation 
and 
consequent 
auto-erotic 
gratification, 
all 
of 
this 
had 
its 
origin 
in 
the 
anticipatory 
craving 
for 
security 
and 
is 
but 
a 
play 
of 
phantasy 
which 
emphasizes 
in 
an 
especially 
strong 
manner 
the 
fear 
of 
the 
man. 
The 
substitution 
of 
her 
husband 
by 
another 
is 
the 
result 
of 
her 
derogatory 
tendency 
and 
equivalent 
to 
her 
wishes 
of 
infidelity, 
her 
husband 
is 
to 
be 
humiliated, 
another 
would 
be 
preferred 
in 
his 
stead. 
Continuing, 
she 
disavows 
this 
plausible 
assumption 
through 
an 
act 
of 
infidelity 
to 
this 
other 
one. 
In 
the 
course 
of 
years 
she 
gave 
up 
this 
flagellation. 
The 
derogatory 
tendency, 
however, 
is 
directed 
more 
vehemently 
against 
her 
husband 
as 
well 
as 
against 
all 
mankind. 
She 
developed 
migraine 
as 
soon 
as 
she 
feared 
that 
she 
was 
losing 
hold 
of 
her 
domineering 
role 
over 
anyone. 
Her 
disease 
succeeded 
too 
in 
enabling 
her 
to 
withdraw 
completely 
from 
society. 
Within 
her 
family 
circle 



she 
was 
absolute 
mistress 
as 
a 
result 
of 
her 
illness. 
She 
succeeded 
also 
in 
degrading 
in 
a 
large 
measure 
her 
various 
family 
physicians, 
inasmuch 
as 
her 
migraine 
remained 
unimproved 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
their 
treatment. 
Even 
morphine 
failed 
in 
its 
effect, 
and 
I 
might 
recommend 
that 
a 
perverse 
reaction 
to 
this 
remedy 
in 
any 
case 
should 
receive 
special 
attention. 
I 
mention 
incidentally, 
as 
a 
supplement 
to 
the 
termination 
of 
the 
treatment, 
that 
she 
also 
placed 
great 
obstacles 
in 
the 
way 
of 
my 
form 
of 
therapy 
and 
for 
a 
long 
time 
sought 
to 
expose 
me 
by 
retaining 
her 
pain 
even 
when 
openly 
flattering 
me. 
Patients 
recover 
as 
soon 
as 
they 
understand 
that 
this 
motive 
of 
adhering 
to 
their 
disease 
is 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
humiliating 
the 
physician. 


Incidentally, 
I 
will 
refer 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
according 
to 
my 
experience, 
"religious 
insanity," 
phantasies 
and 
hallucinations 
of 
God, 
heaven 
and 
the 
saints, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
feeling 
of 
being 
crushed 
are 
to 
be 
understood 
as 
infantile 
megalomanic 
ideas 
of 
these 
patients 
and 
as 
an 
expression 
of 
their 
feeling 
of 
superiority 
over 
their 
environment. 
There 
is 
often 
connected 
with 
this 
a 
hostile 
feeling 
against 
the 
environment, 
as 
is 
the 
case 
when 
a 
catatonic 
permits 
himself 
to 
be 
commanded 
by 
God 
to 
give 
his 
attendant 
a 
box 
on 
the 
ear 
or 
to 
overturn 
a 
bed 
or 
a 
table, 
or 
when 
he 
tries 
to 
compel 
his 
Jewish 
relatives 
to 
submit 
to 
baptism. 
The 
soaring 
in 
maniacs, 
the 
dements' 
grandiose 
ideas 
are 
parallel 
phenomena 
and 
indicate 
the 
buried 
feeling 
of 
humiliation 
which 
demands 
over-compensation 
in 
the 
psychosis. 
(*Paul 
Bjerre 
(" 
Zur 
Kadicalbehandlurig 
der 
chronischen 
Paranoia," 
Wien 
und 
Liepzig, 
Deuticke, 
1912) 
was 
the 
first 
to 
describe 
in 
a 
convincing 
manner 
the 
sisniificance 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest 
and 
of 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
in 
the 
psychosis 
.) 


In 
practice 
physicians 
often 
come 
across 
children 
who 
aggravate 
symptoms 
and 
simulate 
in 
order 
to 
escape 
oppression 
at 
the 
hands 
of 
their 
parents. 
How 
closely 
these 
phenomena 
border 
on 
unfaithfulness 
without 
entirely 
coinciding 
with 
it 
is 
self-apparent. 
Remarkable, 
however, 
is 
the 
concomitant 
manifestation 
of 
signs 
of 
somatic 
inferiority, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
emergence 
of 
the 
neurotic 
character-development, 
and 
hence 
the 
neurotic 
disposition. 
As 
examples, 
three 
cases 
of 
observations 
of 
neurotic 
children 
are 
given. 


A 
seven 
years 
old 
girl 
came 
under 
my 
care 
for 
periodical 
attacks 
of 



gastric 
pain 
and 
nausea. 
We 
found 
a 
frail, 
poorly 
developed 
child 
who 
suffered 
from 
struma 
cystica, 
adenoids 
and 
enlarged 
tonsils. 
Her 
voice 
had 
a 
hoarse 
intonation. 
Upon 
inquiry 
her 
mother 
stated 
that 
the 
child 
often 
suffered 
from 
catarrhal 
troubles 
accompanied 
by 
a 
cough, 
which 
were 
unusually 
protracted, 
as 
well 
as 
from 
protracted 
attacks 
of 
dyspepsia. 
Her 
present 
complaint 
had 
existed 
about 
a 
half 
year, 
without 
any 
demonstrable 
organic 
affection. 
Along 
with 
this 
her 
appetite 
and 
bowel 
functions 
remained 
normal. 
The 
gastric 
pains 
had 
developed 
since 
the 
girl 
began 
attending 
school. 
Her 
progress 
in 
school 
was 
an 
excellent 
one, 
but 
the 
teacher 
had 
repeatedly 
expressed 
wonder 
over 
the 
striking 
ambitiousness 
of 
the 
child. 
She 
was 
very 
sensitive 
about 
admonitions 
and 
felt 
herself 
slighted 
for 
a 
sister 
who 
was 
three 
and 
one-half 
years 
her 
junior. 
What 
especially 
attracted 
her 
mother's 
attention 
was 
a 
definite 
lengthening 
of 
the 
clitoris, 
one 
of 
the 
genital 
anomalies, 
the 
importance 
of 
which 
as 
a 
sign 
of 
inferiority 
I 
have 
already 
emphasized 
here, 
and 
which 
was 
later 
on 
discovered 
by 
Bartel 
and 
Kyrle 
and 
emphasized 
by 
them 
as 
very 
characteristic. 
Her 
skin 
was 
everywhere 
hypersensitive, 
and 
the 
tickling 
reflex 
noticeably 
accentuated. 
The 
child 
frequently 
asked 
to 
be 
tickled. 
The 
child's 
anxiousness 
exceeded 
the 
normal. 
The 
irregularity 
of 
the 
incisors 
is 
to 
be 
looked 
upon 
as 
a 
further 
indication 
of 
a 
somatic 
inferiority, 
which 
points 
to 
a 
defect 
of 
the 
gastrointestinal 
tract. 
The 
pharyngeal 
reflex 
was 
definitely 
exaggerated. 


One 
gains 
the 
impression 
from 
this 
ensemble 
of 
phenomena, 
that 
the 
reflex 
activity 
of 
the 
alimentary 
canal 
was 
likewise 
exaggerated. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact 
the 
child 
had 
vomited 
frequently 
during 
the 
first 
three 
years 
of 
her 
life. 
The 
frequent 
dyspeptic 
attacks 
likewise 
indicate 
an 
inferiority 
of 
the 
gastrointestinal 
tract. 
Along 
with 
this 
she 
had 
suffered 
for 
about 
a 
year 
from 
eczema 
of 
the 
buttocks, 
at 
the 
termination 
of 
the 
inferior 
alimentary 
canal, 
with 
itching 
which 
lasted 
for 
several 
months 
and 
which 
was 
cured 
by 
the 
family 
physician 
by 
means 
of 
suggestion 
and 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
a 
neutral 
salve. 


The 
painful 
pressure 
in 
the 
stomach 
proved 
to 
be 
a 
psychic 
reflex 
which 
set 
in 
whenever 
the 
child 
feared 
a 
humiliation 
at 
school 
or 
at 
home.* 


The 
purpose 
of 
this 
reflex 
which 
had 
been 
constructed 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
somatic 
inferiority 
lay 
in 
the 
effort 
to 
avoid 
punishment 
and 
to 
direct 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
somewhat 
harsh 
mother 
who 
preferred 
the 
younger 
girl. 
After 
the 
inner 
perception 
of 
this 
heightened 
reflex 
activity, 
there 
was 
obviously 



fixation 
and 
aggravation 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
child 
sought 
a 
guiding 
idea 
which 
she 
could 
use 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
maximating 
her 
ego-consciousness. 
On 
account 
of 
the 
brevity 
of 
the 
treatment 
I 
was 
able 
to 
discover 
no 
spontaneous 
expressions 
of 
traces 
of 
ideas 
concerning 
a 
future 
gravidity, 
as 
the 
anticipated 
destiny 
of 
a 
feminine 
role. 
The 
attacks 
vanished 
after 
a 
short 
time, 
after 
I 
had 
explained 
the 
connection 
to 
the 
child. 
A 
dream 
after 
one 
of 
these 
attacks 
points 
in 
the 
above 
described 
direction. 
She 
dreamed: 


"My 
friend 
was 
below. 
Then 
we 
played 
with 
each 
other." 


Her 
friend 
was 
a 
preferred 
rival 
in 
the 
school. 
Conflicts 
often 
resulted, 
without 
blows 
however. 
She 
lived 
on 
the 
floor 
above 
and 
they 
always 
played 
in 
the 
apartment 
of 
the 
patient. 
But 
the 
form 
of 
expression 
in 
the 
dream 
she 
related 
was 
sufficiently 
remarkable. 
When 
I 
asked 
this 
intelligent 
child 
if 
one 
would 
say 
"her 
friend 
was 
below 
" 
when 
the 
person 
who 
related 
the 
story 
was 
playing 
with 
her, 
she 
corrected 
herself 
immediately, 
and 
said 
" 
she 
was 
with 
me." 
But 
we 
will 
assume 
that 
the 
form 
of 
expression 
is 
right 
and 
the 
accent 
is 
on 
the 
"below," 
then 
behind 
this 
is 
concealed 
the 
thought 
that 
the 
rival 
was 
under 
the 
ambitious 
patient 
as 
in 
a 
conflict. 
" 
The 
friend 
was 
below 
" 
then 
means 
" 
I 
was 
above," 
a 
conception 
as 
result 
of 
which 
we 
are 
able 
to 
define 
the 
standpoint 
of 
the 
patient. 
The 
"then" 
also 
points 
in 
the 
same 
direction. 
It 
only 
has 
meaning 
when 
we 
assume 
that 
there 
is 
an 
interval 
between 
the 
two 
dream 
pictures, 
such 
as 
perhaps: 
"I 
must 
first 
be 
superior 
to 
my 
friend, 
then 
I 
will 
play 
with 
her." 


*E. 
Stern 
has 
described 
similar 
phenomena, 
of 
which 
we 
have 
already 
spoken 
frequently 
in 
this 
book, 
as 
preactive 
tensions 
(practive 
Spannungen). 
According 
to 
my 
conception 
we 
are 
dealing 
with 
a 
planful, 
albeit 
unconscious 
utilization 
of 
reflex 
irritability 
of 
inferior 
organs, 
with 
intelligent 
reflexes 
(" 
Intelligente 
Beflexe.") 


The 
history 
which 
preceded 
the 
attack 
which 
followed 
furnished 
a 
confirmation 
of 
our 
conception. 
The 
game 
of 
the 
two 
girls 
was 
as 
a 
rule 
playing 
"father 
and 
mother" 
or 
"playing 
doctor." 
In 
the 
first 
game 
there 
was 
a 
quarrel 
between 
the 
two 
girls 
as 
to 
whom 
should 
be 
"father" 
until 
the 
father 
finally 
took 
a 
hand 
and 
reproached 
the 
patient 
that 
her 
companion 
was 
always 
more 
yielding 
than 
she, 
which 
was 
the 
truth. 
The 
friend 
thereupon 
received 
the 
part 
of 
father. 
When 
the 
family 
shortly 
afterwards 
seated 
themselves 
at 



the 
table, 
the 
child 
was 
seized 
with 
an 
attack. 
She 
ate 
nothing 
and 
was 
put 
to 
bed 
and 
in 
fact 
in 
her 
parents' 
room, 
where 
at 
other 
times 
her 
other 
rival 
slept, 
her 
little 
sister. 
The 
dream 
now 
expresses 
a 
continuation 
of 
the 
same 
tendency 
which 
was 
served 
by 
the 
attack 
and 
furnishes 
us 
a 
hint 
concerning 
the 
patient's 
equal 
valuation 
of 
her 
desire 
for 
masculinity 
and 
her 
craving 
to 
assert 
her 
worth. 
The 
representation 
of 
the 
feminine 
part 
as 
that 
of 
the 
subordinate 
or 
the 
one 
who 
is 
beneath 
in 
the 
word, 
" 
under," 
strengthens 
this 
view 
greatly, 
but 
not 
without 
giving 
rise 
to 
the 
suspicion 
that 
the 
patient 
knows 
the 
position 
during 
coitus. 
She 
slept 
before 
the 
arrival 
of 
her 
younger 
sister 
in 
her 
parents' 
room 
and 
even 
later 
whenever 
she 
was 
ill. 
This 
suspicion 
expressed 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
mother 
remained 
uncontradicted, 
but 
had 
as 
result 
that 
both 
the 
children 
were 
kept 
permanently 
out 
of 
the 
parents' 
room. 
But 
here 
we 
see 
again 
how 
the 
character-traits 
of 
this 
child 
were 
active 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
functionating 
as 
distantly 
placed 
outposts 
whose 
object 
it 
was 
to 
secure 
her 
at 
a 
distance 
against 
every 
analogy, 
every 
symbolic 
experiencing 
of 
a 
female 
destiny, 
degradation, 
minimizing 
of 
the 
ego-consciousness, 
and 
furthermore, 
to 
protect 
her 
from 
all 
future 
misfortune. 


A 
similar 
affection 
well 
known 
to 
physicians 
is 
the 
school 
nausea 
and 
nausea 
at 
table 
or 
shortly 
after 
eating 
which 
resembles 
the 
above 
described 
disease 
in 
its 
psychic 
constitution 
in 
that 
it 
represents 
an 
unconscious 
expedient 
or 
one 
which 
has 
become 
unconscious 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
avoiding 
a 
threatened 
humiliation 
and 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
asserting 
one's 
own 
worth. 


A 
13 
years 
old 
boy 
had 
shown 
for 
the 
past 
three 
years 
a 
remarkable 
indolence, 
which 
prevented 
his 
progress 
at 
school, 
notwithstanding 
his 
indisputable 
intelligence. 
For 
several 
months 
past 
he 
had 
been 
manifesting 
a 
sort 
of 
lamenting 
habitus 
which 
would 
especially 
come 
to 
light 
whenever 
he 
was 
admonished 
for 
any 
cause 
whatever. 
His 
father 
and 
mother 
had 
probably 
always 
been 
a 
little 
too 
harsh 
with 
him, 
but 
as 
far 
as 
I 
could 
obtain 
information 
their 
admonitions 
only 
referred 
to 
his 
slowness 
in 
eating 
and 
dressing 
and 
to 
his 
eagerness 
for 
reading. 
Lately 
things 
had 
come 
to 
such 
a 
pass 
that 
the 
boy 
began 
to 
cry 
whenever 
he 
was 
reminded 
of 
anything 
or 
when 
anyone 
hurried 
him. 
The 
result 
of 
this 
condition 
was 
a 
more 
cautious 
attitude 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
parents, 
though 
they 
thought 
they 
could 
not 
dispense 
with 
admonitions 
entirely 
on 
account 
of 
the 
sluggishness 
of 
the 
boy. 


An 
inquiry 
concerning 
his 
last 
fit 
of 
weeping 
showed 
that 
he 
had 
been 



admonished 
to 
hurry 
to 
school, 
after 
he 
had 
been 
striving 
for 
half 
an 
hour 
before 
the 
glass 
to 
brush 
his 
stubborn 
hair 
smooth. 
The 
analysis 
showed 
that 
he 
saw 
himself 
nearing 
difficulty 
and 
wished 
to 
secure 
himself 
against 
painful 
humiliations 
by 
careful 
measures. 
He 
reproached 
himself 
severely 
with 
childish 
sex 
indiscretions 
which 
he 
had 
committed 
in 
company 
with 
other 
boys 
and 
girls. 
Above 
all 
he 
feared 
discovery 
by 
his 
parents 
and 
this 
fear 
reached 
an 
extraordinary 
degree 
when 
one 
night 
during 
a 
somnambulistic 
experience 
he 
entered 
the 
servant's 
room 
and 
to 
his 
great 
surprise 
found 
himself 
in 
the 
morning 
in 
the 
cook's 
empty 
bed. 
This 
sleepwalking 
was, 
as 
in 
all 
other 
cases 
which 
I 
have 
been 
able 
to 
penetrate, 
the 
result 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest 
against 
the 
feeling 
of 
humiliation. 
The 
day 
before 
he 
was 
transferred 
from 
the 
intermediary 
to 
the 
elementary 
school 
because 
of 
poor 
progress. 
The 
impression 
which 
this 
scene 
made 
upon 
him 
was 
so 
great, 
the 
fear 
that 
he 
might 
betray 
during 
his 
somnambulistic 
experiences, 
the 
secrets 
between 
him 
and 
his 
friends, 
because 
like 
all 
other 
somnambulists 
he 
talked 
in 
his 
sleep, 
was 
so 
terrifying 
that 
it 
led 
him 
to 
very 
strong 
measures 
of 
security. 
The 
thoughts 
were 
first 
in 
regard 
to 
his 
erections 
which 
he 
sought 
to 
conceal 
carefully 
from 
his 
parents. 
This 
he 
accomplished 
by 
a 
downward 
stroking 
of 
his 
erected 
penis 
with 
his 
hand. 
By 
this 
time 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
had 
taken 
possession 
of 
him 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
that 
he 
treated 
the 
hair 
which 
stubbornly 
persisted 
in 
standing 
up 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
sexual 
organ, 
as 
in 
fact 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
always 
reaches 
beyond 
what 
is 
absolutely 
necessary. 
In 
this 
case 
we 
see 
the 
modest 
beginning 
of 
a 
compulsory 
act 
whose 
mechanism 
regularly 
consists 
in 
a 
representation 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest 
or 
in 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
directed 
towards 
it. 
The 
latter 
becomes 
the 
content 
and 
motive 
force 
of 
the 
compulsion 
neuroses 
when 
the 
masculine 
protest 
goes 
too 
far 
and 
is 
threatened 
to 
fall 
into 
femininity 
through 
inner 
contradictions, 
because 
the 
consequences 
would 
be 
a 
punishment, 
a 
degradation 
or 
embarrassment. 
It 
is 
then 
that 
the 
safety 
device 
itself 
seems 
to 
be 
the 
more 
masculine, 
although 
the 
alluring 
feeling 
of 
triumph 
may 
not 
be 
produced. 
Under 
certain 
circumstances 
however 
the 
same 
results 
may 
be 
attained 
by 
a 
fighting 
against 
desire 
in 
every 
form, 
so 
that 
a 
powerful 
asceticism 
is 
valued 
as 
a 
triumph. 


As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
ascetic 
leanings 
as 
varieties 
of 
self-torture, 
found 
a 
place 
in 
this 
boy's 
craving 
for 
security, 
and 
this 
disinclination 
to 
eat 
had 
for 



its 
object 
analogously 
to 
abstinence 
the 
checking 
of 
his 
outcropping 
sexual 
instincts. 
The 
boy 
who, 
apart 
from 
this, 
was 
weak, 
became 
so 
reduced 
that 
the 
parents 
were 
obliged 
to 
interfere. 
Thus 
they 
came 
upon 
his 
craving 
for 
security 
which 
he 
had 
gratified 
with 
so 
much 
difficulty. 
Then 
the 
psychomotor 
familiarity 
with 
the 
attacks 
of 
the 
parents 
led 
to 
security 
through 
crime 
as 
a 
result 
of 
which 
his 
value 
again 
became 
enhanced. 


His 
eagerness 
to 
read 
also 
originated 
from 
his 
craving 
for 
security. 
The 
insecurity 
which 
had 
seized 
him 
at 
puberty 
compelled 
him 
to 
seek 
comfort, 
instruction 
and 
a 
reassuring 
fear 
of 
disease 
in 
the 
encyclopaedia. 
He 
was 
incredibly 
well 
read 
on 
the 
problems 
in 
question. 
Once 
fairly 
on 
the 
way 
to 
seek 
security 
in 
books, 
he 
overdid 
the 
thing 
because 
the 
elder 
brothers 
and 
sisters 
whom 
he 
emulated 
were 
remarkable 
readers, 
also 
because 
he 
acted 
against 
his 
parents, 
his 
oppressors 
in 
doing 
this; 
and 
thirdly 
because 
he 
was 
able 
to 
satisfy 
his 
original 
masculine 
protest 
in 
this 
way 
and 
follow 
the 
heroes 
of 
his 
books 
in 
danger 
and 
conflict, 
which 
was 
shown 
by 
his 
choice 
of 
reading 
matter 
he 
preferred 
Karl 
May. 


The 
third 
case 
was 
that 
of 
an 
eleven 
years 
old 
boy 
who 
suffered 
from 
a 
psychically 
determined 
protracted 
pertussis 
and 
who 
at 
that 
time 
still 
suffered 
from 
enuresis. 
He 
was 
an 
intractable 
child 
who 
wished 
to 
attach 
his 
father 
to 
himself 
while 
he 
tried 
to 
avoid 
his 
step-mother 
as 
a 
cruel 
persecutor. 
The 
receptive 
disposition 
of 
the 
father 
was 
manifested 
-in 
his 
extreme 
solicitude 
during 
attacks 
of 
whooping 
cough. 
One 
morning 
as 
the 
mother 
again 
reproached 
the 
boy 
because 
he 
had 
wet 
his 
bed, 
he 
jumped 
laughingly 
out 
of 
bed 
and 
ran 
about 
the 
room 
undressed 
until 
the 
solicitous 
father 
with 
an 
indignant 
remark 
to 
the 
mother 
carried 
the 
breathless 
boy 
back 
to 
bed. 
A 
severe 
fit 
of 
coughing 
which 
resembled 
whooping 
cough, 
from 
which 
he 
had 
just 
recovered, 
closed 
this 
scene 
and 
caused 
a 
quarrel 
between 
the 
married 
couple. 
When 
the 
boy 
again 
went 
to 
bed 
in 
the 
evening, 
he 
sprang 
up 
in 
an 
excited 
manner 
and 
galloped 
back 
and 
forth 
so 
that 
he 
again 
became 
breathless. 
The 
meaning 
of 
the 
attack 
was 
quite 
obvious. 
The 
boy 
wished 
to 
again 
provoke 
reproaches 
against 
the 
step-mother 
and 
to 
draw 
the 
father 
to 
his 
side. 
A 
suggestive 
treatment 
and 
an 
explanation 
of 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
attack 
brought 
about 
a 
cessation 
of 
same, 
but 
the 
pertussis 
still 
dragged 
on 
for 
half 
a 
year 
longer. 


Analogous 
mechanisms 
are 
at 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
idea 
of 
suicide. 
The 



deed 
itself 
is 
usually 
wrecked 
on 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
inner 
contradictions 
of 
this 
form 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest. 
The 
psychic 
change 
results 
from 
the 
thought 
of 
death, 
of 
nonexistence, 
the 
humiliating 
feeling 
of 
being 
about 
to 
become 
dust, 
of 
wholly 
losing 
one's 
personality. 
Where 
there 
are 
checks 
of 
a 
religious 
nature, 
they 
are 
merely 
the 
husks, 
a 
recoil 
as 
though 
this 
action 
too 
were 
a 
punishment. 
Hamlet, 
up 
to 
our 
time 
the 
model 
of 
a 
person 
who 
doubts 
of 
his 
manliness, 
of 
the 
psychic 
hermaphrodite, 
who 
consciously 
represents 
to 
himself 
in 
reassuring 
forethought 
the 
limitations 
of 
his 
manly 
protest, 
who 
rebels 
against 
his 
feminine 
line, 
and 
not 
without 
evading 
the 
dialectical 
change 
to 
the 
manly 
line, 
protects 
himself 
from 
suicide 
by 
conjuring 
up 
the 
dreams, 
" 
To 
sleep, 
perchance 
to 
dream, 
ay 
there's 
the 
rub, 
for 
in 
that 
sleep 
of 
death 
what 
dreams 
may 
come, 
when 
we 
have 
shuffled 
off 
this 
mortal 
coil." 
In 
the 
graveyard 
scene 
a 
real 
horror 
was 
manifested 
because 
Yorick's 
skull 
was 
of 
no 
more 
value 
than 
the 
others'. 


I 
have 
for 
some 
time 
defended 
the 
view 
that 
suicide 
is 
one 
of 
the 
strongest 
forms 
of 
masculine 
protest 
and 
represents 
a 
security 
from 
humiliation 
by 
withdrawal. 
The 
cases 
accessible 
to 
me 
of 
attempts 
at 
suicide 
have 
always 
revealed 
the 
neurotic 
structure 
in 
their 
psyche. 
Signs 
of 
somatic 
inferiority, 
feelings 
of 
uncertainty 
and 
inferiority 
from 
childhood, 
a 
psychic 
structure 
which 
is 
felt 
to 
be 
effeminate, 
and 
the 
overtense 
masculine 
protest 
answering 
to 
this 
feeling 
of 
effeminacy 
were 
manifested 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
in 
every 
neurotic. 
A 
nearer 
or 
more 
remote 
example 
shows 
the 
trend. 
The 
most 
powerful 
psychic 
hold 
originates 
from 
the 
thoughts 
of 
death 
in 
childhood 
which 
produce 
a 
constant 
predisposition 
to 
suicide 
by 
shaping 
the 
psychic 
physiognomy 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
egotistic 
idea. 
In 
the 
previous 
history 
of 
would-be 
suicides 
the 
same 
tendencies 
are 
found 
of 
trying 
to 
attain 
influence 
by 
illness, 
by 
attempting 
or 
by 
dwelling 
on 
the 
thoughts 
of 
death, 
dreaming 
of 
the 
mourning 
of 
relatives, 
to 
obtain 
satisfaction 
in 
a 
situation 
of 
humiliation 
or 
when 
there 
are 
feelings 
of 
despised 
love. 
And 
the 
idea 
becomes 
deed 
in 
a 
similar 
situation 
of 
the 
reduction 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
self-esteem, 
as 
soon 
as 
this 
loss 
leads 
to 
a 
strong 
reduction 
of 
the 
worth 
of 
life 
and 
is 
able 
to 
cause 
the 
dialectical 
change 
of 
the 
masculine 
idea 
of 
suicide 
to 
be 
overlooked 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
recent 
humiliation. 
Thus 
we 
must 
concede 
that 
those 
writers 
are 
correct 
who 
see 
in 
suicide 
a 
process 
allied 
to 
the 
insane 
constructions. 
My 
studies 
and 
those 
of 
Bartel's 
on 
the 
inferiority 
of 
organ, 



especially 
the 
inferiority 
of 
the 
sexual 
apparatus, 
are 
in 
harmony 
with 
this. 


In 
the 
neuroses 
the 
probability 
of 
a 
correction 
is 
stronger, 
if 
it 
does 
not 
always 
prevent 
suicide. 
It 
seems 
that 
the 
profound 
consideration 
of 
the 
problem 
of 
suicide 
which 
with 
the 
neurotic 
usually 
lasts 
for 
years 
is 
in 
itself 
a 
sign 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
a 
contributory 
cause 
of 
the 
correction. 
And 
in 
fact 
the 
deeds 
and 
thoughts 
of 
neurotics 
are 
full 
of 
thoughts 
of 
death. 
Here 
is 
the 
dream 
of 
a 
neurotic 
who 
was 
under 
treatment 
on 
account 
of 
stuttering 
and 
psychic 
impotence, 
during 
a 
night 
after 
he 
had 
waited 
in 
vain 
for 
a 
letter 
from 
his 
bride: 


"I 
thought 
I 
was 
dead. 
My 
relatives 
stood 
about 
the 
coffin 
and 
conducted 
themselves 
as 
though 
they 
were 
in 
despair." 


The 
patient 
remembered 
having 
often 
had 
thoughts 
in 
childhood 
that 
he 
would 
like 
to 
die 
because 
his 
parents 
preferred 
his 
younger 
brother. 
He 
had 
always 
been 
persecuted 
by 
the 
thought 
that 
because 
of 
hydrocele 
and 
because 
of 
smallness 
of 
the 
genital 
organs 
he 
was 
inferior 
and 
would 
have 
no 
children. 
Later 
he 
thought 
to 
protect 
himself 
by 
humiliation 
of 
women 
and 
great 
distrust 
of 
them 
to 
protect 
himself 
against 
them 
and 
unhappiness 
in 
marriage. 
In 
reality 
he 
felt 
too 
weak 
and 
was 
afraid 
of 
women. 
Just 
as 
he 
feared 
this 
test 
in 
marriage 
he 
avoided 
all 
decisions 
through 
a 
factor 
which 
had 
become 
motor. 
His 
impotence 
set 
in 
when 
he 
received 
a 
favorable 
answer 
from 
his 
bride, 
as 
an 
excuse, 
an 
expedient 
to 
postpone 
marriage. 
In 
the 
dream, 
the 
thought 
that 
his 
bride 
might 
prefer 
another 
is 
reflected. 
With 
this 
was 
connected 
an 
attempt 
at 
a 
solution 
by 
means 
of 
which 
he 
could 
divert 
her 
whole 
love 
to 
himself, 
in 
which, 
as 
in 
the 
arrangement 
of 
his 
impotence, 
the 
possibility 
of 
marriage 
was 
eliminated. 



CHAPTER 
X 
THE 
NEUROTIC'S 
ESPRIT 
DE 
FAMILLE, 
REFRACTORINESS 
AND 
OBEDIENCE, 
SILENCE 
AND 
LOQUACIOUNESS, 
THE 
TENDENCY 
TO 
CONTRARINESS. 


IN 
this 
chapter 
I 
will 
refer 
to 
another 
series 
of 
character-traits 
displayed 
by 
neurotics, 
such 
as 
are 
often 
found 
in 
the 
foreground 
of 
psychoanalytic 
observations 
where 
they 
merely 
influence 
the 
external 
picture 
of 
the 
neurosis. 
They 
merely 
assist 
in 
constructing 
the 
neurotic 
individuality, 
but 
just 
on 
this 
account 
may 
lend 
to 
the 
special 
neurosis 
a 
particular 
direction, 
or 
may 
provoke 
a 
definite 
fate 
in 
the 
conflict 
with 
the 
environment. 
Thus 
it 
may 
happen 
that 
the 
neurotic's 
esprit 
de 
famille 
may 
be 
revealed 
in 
an 
especially 
obtrusive 
manner, 
that 
genealogical 
investigations 
may 
fill 
a 
part 
of 
the 
neurotic's 
thinking, 
which 
conceals 
more 
deeply 
seated 
traits, 
often 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
an 
unjustifiable 
pride 
of 
ancestry, 
which 
is 
then 
utilized 
as 
a 
striving 
against 
the 
social 
obligations 
which 
go 
with 
sexual 
relations 
and 
marriage, 
similarly 
as 
the 
hunting 
out 
of 
heredity 
of 
disease 
is 
utilized. 
This 
readily 
succeeds 
through 
an 
arrangement 
of 
extreme 
affection 
for 
certain 
members 
of 
the 
family, 
or 
for 
the 
entire 
family. 
This 
affection 
originates 
from 
the 
compulsion 
of 
the 
same 
guiding 
fiction 
with 
its 
internal 
contradiction 
upon 
which 
the 
fear 
of 
decisions 
and 
of 
the 
sexual 
partner 
rests. 
This 
expedient 
then 
serves 
the 
purpose 
of 
gaining 
mastery 
over 
the 
family 
circle, 
for 
which 
purpose 
the 
family 
bond 
is 
taken 
as 
something 
holy. 
In 
neurotics 
the 
break 
with 
the 
family 
borders 
on 
the 
esprit 
de 
famille, 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
makes 
itself 
felt 
more 
strongly 
and 
requires 
proof 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
depend 
even 
on 
blood 
relations. 
Misanthropy 
as 
an 
abstract 
guiding 
line 
and 
refuge 
in 
solitude 
are 
then 
not 
rare 
occurrences 
and 
are 
plainly 
revealed 
in 
the 
psychosis. 


The 
subordination 
of 
the 
character-traits 
to 
the 
guiding 
fiction 
may 
be 
seen 
especially 
clearly 
in 
the 
antithetical 
traits 
of 
refractoriness 
and 
obedience,* 
which 
singly 
or 
intermingled 
in 
varying 
degrees 
contribute 
much 
to 
the 
coloring 
of 
the 
neurotic 
psyche.

Insight 
into 
the 
construction 
of 
these 
character-traits, 
which 
have 
been 
abstracted 
from 
neutral, 
actual 
impressions 
of 
the 
pre-neurotic 
period 
and 
have 
then 
been 
neurotically 
grouped 
and 
worked 
over 
into 
guiding 
lines, 
teaches 
us 
much 
concerning 
the 
origin, 
the 
meaning 
and 
purpose 
of 
a 
given 
character. 


The 
idea 
of 
a 
congenital 
origin 
of 
" 
character," 
is 
untenable 
because 
the 
real 
substratum 
for 
the 
formation 
of 
psychic 
character 
and 
whatever 
part 
thereof 
may 
be 
congenital, 
is 
metamorphosed 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
guiding 
idea 
until 
this 
idea 
is 
satisfied. 
Both 
refractoriness 
and 
obedience 
are 
only 
attitudes 
which 
reveal 
to 
us 
the 
jump 
from 
the 
uncertain 
past 
into 
the 
protecting 
future, 
as 
are 
all 
other 
character-traits. 


Timidity 
as 
an 
attitude 
of 
the 
fear 
of 
decisions 
is 
often 
accompanied 
in 
neurotics 
by 
the 
trait 
of 
uncommunicability. 
These 
devices 
work 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
an 
isolation 
which 
has 
for 
its 
purpose 
the 
withdrawal 
from 
the 
environment 
of 
the 
points 
of 
contact. 
The 
neurotic 
who 
persists 
in 
silence 
sometimes 
shows 
his 
superiority 
and 
derogatory 
tendency 
also 
in 
the 
role 
of 
kill-joy, 
or 
he 
arranges 
through 
his 
silence 
and 
apparent 
want 
of 
ideas 
the 
proof 
that 
he 
is 
not 
the 
equal 
of 
others, 
especially 
when 
these 
are 
in 
the 
majority, 
and 
that 
he 
is 
especially 
unfit 
for 
marriage. 
In 
the 
taking 
up 
and 
accentuating 
the 
antithesis 
of 
the 
above, 
loquaciousness, 
I 
have 
at 
times 
discovered 
the 
proof 
for 
the 
conviction 
that 
the 
individual 
cannot 
keep 
a 
secret. 
Another 
form 
of 
attack 
and 
detraction 
is 
found 
in 
the 
loud, 
impatient 
manner 
which 
many 
neurotics 
have 
of 
interrupting 
others. 
The 
object 
is 
often 
more 
obvious 
from 
the 
circumstance 
that 
he 
introduces 
every 
remark 
with 
a 
"No" 
or 
a 
"But" 
or 
an 
"On 
the 
contrary." 


A 
trait 
of 
character 
to 
which 
the 
neurosis 
owes 
much 
of 
its 
definiteness 
and 
significance, 
which 
is 
always 
present 
and 
which, 
together 
with 
refractoriness 
and 
negativism, 
belongs 
to 
the 
strongest 
forms 
of 
expression 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
is 
the 
tendency 
to 
desire 
to 
have 
everything 
different 
or 
turned 
around. 
This 
trait 
is 
found 
in 
the 
compensatory 
efforts 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
striving 
after 
neurotic 
expedients, 
it 
exists 
in 
the 
disputatiousness 
and 
in 
the 
neurotic 
derogatory 
tendency 
and 
possesses 
an. 
enormous 
applicability 
for 
the 
conflict 
with 
the 
environment. 
It 
is 
the 
counterpart 
of 
the 
frequently 
observed 
conservative, 
pedantic 
nature 
of 
the 
neurotic 
and 
like 
it 
permits 
him 



to 
confirm 
his 
thirst 
for 
mastery. 
The 
striving 
for 
change 
and 
revolution 
is 
found 
at 
the 
root 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest, 
when 
the 
latter 
is 
constructed 
according 
to 
an 
antithesis. 
' 
The 
essential 
of 
alt 
feminine 
dialectic 
is 
said 
to 
be: 
to 
wish 
everything 
different," 
announces 
E. 
Fuchs 
in 
" 
Die 
Frau 
in 
der 
Karikatur." 
In 
dress, 
morals, 
attitude, 
and 
movement, 
something 
bizarre 
is 
always 
revealed, 
usually 
with 
some 
pretext. 
One 
of 
my 
patients 
often 
turned 
herself 
around 
in 
sleep 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
when 
she 
awoke 
she 
found 
herself 
lying 
in 
the 
opposite 
direction. 
In 
waking 
hours 
also 
she 
sought 
to 
turn 
everything 
upside 
down. 
One 
of 
her 
favorite 
phrases 
was, 
"On 
the 
contrary," 
as 
an 
objection 
to 
the 
opinion 
of 
others. 
The 
wish 
to 
be 
above, 
to 
ride, 
to 
wear 
the 
pants 
is 
often 
found 
to 
be 
expressed 
in 
patients 
of 
this 
sort 
in 
an 
extraordinarily 
clear 
manner. 
In 
the 
psychotherapeutic 
treatment 
this 
trait 
is 
manifested 
from 
beginning 
to 
end, 
as 
is 
the 
case 
with 
negativism 
in 
catatonics, 
may 
be 
always 
anticipated 
and 
extends 
to 
the 
most 
trivial 
things. 
Very 
often 
these 
neurotic 
tendencies 
to 
contrariness 
are 
manifested 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
notion 
that 
the 
physician 
could 
come 
to 
the 
patient, 
not 
the 
patient 
to 
the 
physician. 
Predictions 
should 
as 
a 
rule 
be 
avoided 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
neurotics, 
but 
where 
there 
is 
a 
strong 
tendency 
to 
turn 
things 
around 
the 
physician 
will 
always 
be 
put 
in 
the 
wrong. 


The 
effort 
is 
constantly 
made 
to 
make 
up-down; 
right-left; 
before-behind, 
because 
the 
guiding 
fiction 
demands 
symbolically 
the 
turning 
around, 
that 
is, 
the 
changing 
from 
feminine 
to 
masculine. 
Words 
and 
writing 
are 
turned 
around 
(mirror 
writing), 
morality, 
sexual 
conduct, 
dreams 
are 
turned 
into 
opposites 
and 
follow 
in 
reverse 
sequence 
and 
sometimes 
playfully, 
but 
at 
other 
times 
offensively, 
thoughts 
are 
turned 
around. 
The 
expedient 
which 
is 
to 
preserve 
a 
masculine 
line 
of 
conduct 
has 
accordingly 
something 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
fury. 


The 
application 
of 
this 
" 
On 
the 
contrary 
" 
(Umgekehrt) 
in 
superstition, 
perhaps 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
cheating 
fate 
by 
expecting 
the 
opposite 
of 
what 
one 
would 
like, 
is 
a 
frequent 
trait 
in 
neurotics, 
reveals 
their 
complete 
insecurity, 
takes 
us 
back 
to 
the 
neurotic 
cautiousness 
and 
permits 
the 
recognition 
of 
the 
tremendous 
significance 
and 
wide 
scope 
which 
this 
attains 
in 
the 
psyche 
of 
the 
neurotic. 
(* 
See 
also 
Adler, 
" 
Syphilidophohia." 
1. 
c. 
) 


About 
this 
nucleus 
of 
cautiousness 
may 
be 
grouped, 
according 
to 
the 
exactions 
of 
the 
guiding 
ideal, 
traits 
of 
truthfulness 
or 
untruthfulness 
as 
the 



particular 
situation 
may 
demand. 
They 
always 
express 
the 
striving 
after 
full 
masculinity, 
sometimes 
directly, 
at 
other 
times 
by 
circuitous 
ways. 
Closely 
related 
to 
these 
are 
traits 
of 
deception 
and 
frankness, 
the 
first 
characteristic 
originating 
clearly 
in 
a 
feeling 
of 
inferiority, 
of 
being 
under. 
A 
strong 
anticipatory 
craving 
for 
security 
is 
revealed 
by 
the 
traits 
of 
hypersensitiveness 
to 
pain 
and 
suffering 
which 
keeps 
the 
Individual 
as 
well 
as 
the 
environment 
reminded 
that 
he 
can 
only 
choose 
those 
situations 
in 
life 
which 
can 
be 
endured 
without 
pain. 
It 
goes 
without 
saying 
that 
the 
anticipation 
of 
labor 
pains 
often 
enters 
into 
the 
construction 
of 
this 
guiding 
line. 
The 
neurotic's 
phenomena 
of 
doubt, 
of 
vacillation 
and 
of 
lack 
of 
decision 
which 
have 
been 
so 
frequently 
emphasized 
in 
this 
book 
are 
related 
to 
cautiousness. 


They 
always 
set 
in 
when 
reality 
influences 
the 
guiding 
fiction 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
that 
contradictions 
constantly 
emerge 
in 
the 
latter, 
when 
the 
danger 
of 
a 
defeat, 
of 
a 
loss 
of 
prestige, 
is 
threatened 
by 
reality. 
There 
are 
then, 
generally 
speaking, 
three 
ways 
open 
to 
the 
neurotic, 
which 
depend 
upon 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
fictitious 
guiding 
goal, 
so 
that 
the 
developed 
neurosis 
assumes 
an 
aspect 
in 
correspondence 
with 
one 
of 
these. 
The 
first 
way 
is 
by 
fixing 
the 
doubt 
and 
vacillation 
as 
a 
basis 
of 
operation, 
as 
is 
most 
frequently 
found 
in 
neurasthenics 
and 
psychasthenics, 
the 
tendency 
to 
doubt. 
The 
second 
way 
leads 
to 
the 
psychosis 
by 
means 
of 
which 
under 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
feeling 
of 
truth, 
* 
the 
fiction 
is 
hypostasized, 
deified.

Kanabich, 
" 
Zur 
Pathologie 
der 
Intellectuellen 
Emotionen 
" 
(" 
Psych 
otherapia," 
edited 
by 
v. 
N. 
Wiroboff, 
Moskau, 
1911), 
approached 
this 
thoughtvery 
closely. 
The 
third 
way 
leads 
to 
a 
formal 
change 
of 
the 
fiction 
under 
an 
arrangement 
of 
anxiety, 
weakness, 
pain, 
etc., 
in 
short 
to 
a 
neurotic, 
circuitous 
way 
in 
which 
feminine 
means 
are 
employed 
to 
attain 
the 
purposes, 
of 
the 
masculine 
protest. 



CONCLUSION 


Our 
study 
has 
shown 
that 
man's 
character-traits 
and 
their 
principal 
function 
in 
the 
life 
of 
the 
individual 
are 
manifested 
as 
expedients, 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
guiding 
lines 
for 
the 
thinking, 
feeling, 
willing, 
and 
acting 
of 
the 
human 
psyche, 
and 
that 
they 
are 
brought 
into 
stronger 
relief 
so 
soon 
as 
the 
individual 
strives 
to 
escape 
from 
the 
phase 
of 
uncertainty 
to 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
his 
fictitious 
guiding 
idea. 
The 
material 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
character-
traits 
is 
contained 
in 
the 
psychic 
totality 
and 
congenital 
differences 
vanish 
before 
the 
uniform 
effect 
of 
the 
guiding 
fiction. 
Goal 
and 
direction, 
the 
fictitious 
purpose 
of 
the 
traits 
of 
character 
may 
be 
best 
recognized 
in 
the 
original, 
direct, 
aggressive 
lines. 
Want 
and 
difficulties 
of 
life 
lead 
to 
alterations 
of 
character, 
so 
that 
only 
such 
constructions 
find 
favor 
as 
stand 
in 
harmony 
with 
the 
individual's 
ego-idea. 
In 
this 
manner 
are 
formed 
the 
more 
cautious, 
the 
more 
hesitating 
character-traits 
which 
show 
a 
deviation 
from 
the 
direct 
line, 
but 
examination 
of 
which 
reveals 
their 
dependence 
upon 
the 
guiding 
fiction. 


The 
neuroses 
and 
psychoses 
are 
attempts 
at 
compensation, 
constructive 
creations 
of 
the 
psyche 
which 
result 
from 
the 
accentuated 
and 
too 
highly 
placed 
guiding 
ideal 
of 
the 
inferior 
child. 
The 
uncertainty 
of 
these 
children 
in 
regard 
to 
their 
future 
and 
their 
success 
in 
life 
forces 
them 
to 
stronger 
efforts 
and 
reassurances 
in 
their 
fictitious 
life 
plan. 
The 
more 
fixed 
and 
rigid 
their 
guiding 
picture, 
their 
individual 
categorical 
imperative, 
the 
more 
dogmatically 
they 
draw 
the 
guiding 
lines 
of 
their 
lives. 
The 
more 
cautiously 
they 
proceed 
in 
this, 
the 
further 
they 
weave 
these 
threads 
of 
thought 
beyond 
their 
own 
person 
out 
into 
the 
future 
and 
organize 
on 
their 
peripheral 
ends 
where 
contact 
with 
the 
external 
world 
is 
to 
take 
place, 
those 
traits 
of 
character 
which 
are 
required 
to 
serve 
as 
outposts 
for 
their 
psychic 
predispositions. 
With 
its 
extraordinary 
sensitiveness 
the 
neurotic 
trait 
of 
character 
fastens 
itself 
to 
reality 
in 
order 
to 
change 
it 
according 
to 
the 
egoistic 
ideal, 
or 
in 
order 
to 
subject 
it 
to 
the 
same. 
Should 
defeat 
threaten, 
the 
neurotic 
predispositions 
and 
symptoms 
come 
into 
force. 


The 
slight 
significance 
of 
the 
congenital 
substratum 
as 
far 
as 
the 



formation 
of 
character 
is 
concerned 
arises 
also 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
guiding 
fiction 
only 
collects 
and 
unites 
into 
a 
group 
those 
psychic 
elements 
of 
which 
it 
can 
make 
use. 
It 
only 
collects 
those 
faculties 
and 
memories 
in 
which 
results 
are 
promised 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
final 
goal. 
In 
the 
neurotic 
reformation 
of 
the 
psyche 
the 
guiding 
fiction 
has 
absolute 
dominion 
and 
makes 
use 
of 
experience 
according 
to 
its 
own 
bent, 
as 
if 
the 
psyche 
were 
a 
motionless, 
concrete 
mass. 
It 
is 
only 
when 
the 
neurotic 
perspective 
becomes 
effective, 
when 
the 
neurotic 
character 
and 
predispositions 
are 
fully 
developed 
and 
the 
way 
to 
the 
guiding 
goal 
is 
assured 
that 
we 
recognize 
the 
individual 
as 
neurotic. 
It 
is 
then 
that 
the 
neurotic 
psyche 
teaches 
us 
more 
clearly 
than 
does 
the 
normal 
that, 
' 
Through 
the 
great 
being 
which 
surrounds 
and 
penetrates 
us, 
there 
is 
a 
great 
becoming 
which 
strives 
toward 
a 
completed 
being." 
(Durch 
das 
grosse 
Sein, 
das 
uns 
umgibt 
und 
weit 
in 
uns 
hineinreicht, 
zieht 
sich 
ein 
grosses 
Werden, 
das 
dem 
vollendeten 
Sein 
zustrebt.) 
Thus 
we 
find 
that 
" 
character," 
which 
has 
found 
its 
utility 
through 
the 
aiding 
ideal 
is 
something 
like 
an 
intelligent 
pattern 
(intelligente 
chablone) 
which 
is 
made 
use 
of 
by 
the 
craving 
for 
security 
as 
well 
as 
by 
the 
affect 
and 
disease 
predispositions. 
It 
is 
the 
task 
of 
comparative 
individualistic 
psychology 
to 
comprehend 
the 
meaning 
of 
these 
models, 
as 
Breuer 
has 
begun 
to 
understand 
them 
in 
their 
genetic, 
and 
in 
our 
sense, 
analogical 
construction, 
to 
regard 
them 
as 
a 
symbol 
of 
a 
life 
plan, 
as 
a 
simile. 
For 
through 
the 
analysis 
of 
character 
by 
means 
of 
which 
the 
line 
which 
ever 
soars 
toward 
the 
guiding 
ideal 
may 
always 
be 
followed, 
we 
find 
compressed 
in 
one 
point 
the 
past, 
present, 
future, 
and 
the 
desired 
goal. 


One 
will 
always 
find 
that 
neurotics 
cling 
tenaciously 
to 
their 
reassuring 
ideals. 
The 
defense 
of 
them 
becomes 
accentuated 
because 
the 
patient 
in 
abandoning 
his 
ideal 
as 
well 
as 
by 
a 
change 
in 
direction 
of 
his 
life 
plan 
brought 
about 
by 
another 
anxiously 
anticipates 
a 
defeat, 
a 
subordination, 
an 
emasculation. 
The 
next 
step 
in 
the 
therapeutic 
procedure 
will, 
according 
to 
this, 
have 
to 
be 
the 
removal 
of 
this 
strongly 
antithetical 
attitude, 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
patient 
to 
the 
physician, 
and 
its 
revelation 
as 
a 
form 
of 
the 
old 
neurotic 
ideal, 
as 
the 
exaggerated 
masculine 
protest. 


Thus 
as 
a 
final 
word 
and 
as 
an 
explanation 
of 
our 
standpoint 
we 
may 
sum 
up 
as 
follows: 
Inferior 
organs 
and 
neurotic 
phenomena 
are 
symbols 
of 
formative 
forces 
which 
strive 
to 
realize 
a 
self-constructed 
life 
plan 
by 
means 



of 
intense 
efforts 
and 
expedients.

CHAVES-MESEN 
THE 
KNIGHTS 
OF 
NOSTRADAMUS 


Based 
on 
prophecies, 
mysteries, 
and 
ancient 
secrets, 
in 
this 
original 
series 
of 
four 
novels, 
each 
book 
is 
about 
one 
piece 
of 
a 
big 
cosmic 
puzzle… 


I.CIRCLE 
OF 
POWER 
(Four 
Prophecies). 


In 
1553, 
in 
a 
little 
city 
of 
France, 
Michelle 
de 
Nostradamus 
predicted 
that 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
millennium 
a 
series 
of 
drastic 
changes 
would 
alter 
the 
world’s 
structures 
of 
power 
forever. 
For 
centuries, 
in 
their 
innermost 
core, 
human 
beings 
feared 
those 
fatidic 
dates. 
However, 
the 
millennium 
arrived 
and 
nothing 
seemed 
to 
happen. 
Nostradamus 
prophecies 
and 
all 
other 
prophecies 
regarding 
the 
end 
of 
the 
world 
failed 
miserably. 
Then 
again, 
there 
was 
2012, 
and 
again 
the 
prophecies 
did 
not 
fulfill. 
Everybody 
celebrated 
happily 
and 
relieved; 
and 
lives 
returned 
to 
normality. 
But 
a 
series 
of 
events 
are 
about 
to 
change 
that 
state 
of 
relaxation… 
In 
Paris, 
the 
Mona 
Lisa 
is 
stolen 
from 
the 
Louvre… 
In 
Milan, 
the 
author 
of 
a 
book 
that 
promises 
to 
reveal 
the 
biggest 
secrets 
of 
Leonardo 
Da 
Vinci 
is 
killed 
and 
his 
manuscripts 
disappear… 
In 
Rome, 
the 
ambassador 
of 
a 
small 
country 
is 
assassinated 
in 
a 
terrorist 
attack, 
leaving 
a 
shadow 
of 
mystery 
behind… 
Ricardo 
Díaz, 
a 
man 
who 
cannot 
find 
sense 
to 
his 
life, 
is 
sent 
as 
the 
new 
ambassador 
to 
investigate 
the 
murder. 
And 
from 
that 
moment 
on, 
death 
will 
follow 
him, 
as 
he 
gets 
involved 
in 
a 
world 
wide 
conspiracy 
of 
unimaginable 
reach 
and 
consequences. 
Without 
even 
knowing, 
he 
is 
about 
to 
reveal 
the 
enigmas 
of 
the 
Circle 
of 
Ancestral 
Power, 
a 
group 
of 
European 
Nobles 
that 
strives 
to 
regain 
the 
power 
of 
the 
world 
inspired 
and 
guided 
by 
the 
secrets 
of 
Leonardo 
Da 
Vinci 
and 
the 
prophecies 
of 
Nostradamus. 
How 
far 
would 
that 
group 
go 
to 
make 
those 
prophecies 
come 
true? 


II.THE 
PYRAMID 
OF 
APOCALYPSE 
What 
really 
happened 
at 
the 
Great 
Flood? 
Did 
Noah 
bring 
some 
ancient 



secrets 
to 
the 
new 
born 
World? 
Is 
the 
real 
apocalypse, 
the 
revelation, 
about 
to 
begin? 
Those 
are 
the 
secrets 
that 
a 
recently 
divorced 
and 
on 
sabbatical 
archeologist 
Stefano 
Della 
Crocce 
would 
have 
to 
uncover, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
learning 
about 
the 
secrets 
of 
his 
family, 
hidden 
for 
many, 
many 
generations.

III. 
THE 
CHALICE 
All 
the 
great 
prophets 
had 
a 
chalice. 
From 
the 
Holy 
Grail 
to 
Da 
Vinci; 
from 
Nostradamus 
to 
Jules 
Verne 
and 
William 
Atkinson, 
there 
was 
always 
a 
chalice. 
Was 
it 
the 
same? 
Has 
it 
the 
power 
to 
communicate 
with 
Something? 
Where 
is 
that 
chalice 
now, 
if 
indeed 
it 
exists? 
Who 
has 
it, 
and 
Why 
is 
it 
so 


important 
for 
the 
groups 
seeking 
world 
domination? 


Soon 
on 
Ebook.
