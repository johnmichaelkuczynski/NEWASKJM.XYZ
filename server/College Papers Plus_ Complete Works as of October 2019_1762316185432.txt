The So-called ‘Paradoxes of Validity’ of Elementary Symbolic Logic 
Consider the following five statements: 
S1: The moon has the shape of a cube. 
S2: The moon is made of non-dairy creamer. 
S3: The moon is a six-sided, three-dimensional figure. 
S4: The moon does not have the shape of a cube. 
S5: The moon is not made of non-dairy creamer. 
For right now, let us focus on S1, S2, and S3. We will discuss S4 and S5 in a moment. 
S2 obviously does not follow from S1, but S3 clearly does follow from S1. There is no way that S3 could be false if S1 were true, that being what it means to say that S3 follows from S1 (or, equivalently, that S1 ‘entails’ S3). But if S1 were true, that would obviously be perfectly compatible with S3’s being false; and S1 therefore fails to entail S3 (or, equivalently, S3 does not follow from S1). 
And yet every modern textbook on elementary symbolic logic contains the following two claims (or close variants thereof): 
K1: P.Q means “if P, then Q” 
K2: P.Q is true as long as it is not the case that P is true and Q is false. In other words, P.Q means “P and not-Q” is false. 
Ordinarily, of course, “if P, then Q” means that Q is a consequence of 
P. “If Jerry is in Paris, then Jerry is in France” is true, given, if indeed Jerry is in Paris, a consequence of that fact is that he is in France. 
But if K1 and K2 are both true, if P is false, it always entails Q, no matter Q is, and if Q is true, it always follows from P, no matter what P is. If K1 and K2 are both true, then “if the moon is the shape of a cube, the moon is made of non-dairy creamer” is true, simply because “the moon is the shape of a cube” is false. In other words, if K1 and K2 are both true, then S2 follows from S1. But this seems absurd, since, supposing that the moon had the shape of a cube, that wouldn’t require the moon to be made of non-dairy creamer. 
And it is absurd---demonstrably so, as we will now see. S5 is the negation of S3. (The negation of P is not-P. The negation of ‘snow is white’ is ‘it is not the case that snow is white.’) If K1 and K2 are true, then S5 follows form S1. In other words, if K1 and K2 are both true, then the negation of S3 follows from S1. Why? Because if K1 and K2 are true, then P.Q is true whenever P is false—and S1 is false. 
What has gone wrong here? Very simple. K1 does not have the same meaning as “if P, then Q.” The meaning of “if P, then Q” is “Q follows from P” or, equivalently, “not-Q is incompatible with P.” But this is not the meaning of “P.Q”. The meaning of “P.Q” is simply that it is not the case that both P is true and Q is false. “P.Q” contains no content relating to incompatibility/entailment. “P.Q” is a strictly truth-conditional notion. In other words, whether or not “P.Q” is true is a function only of the truth-values of P and Q (of whether they are true or false, in other words). By contrast “Q follows from P” is a non-truth-conditional notion; it is, in fact, a modal notion---meaning that it depends, not on the truth-values of P and Q, but rather on the possibility of the one’s being incompatible with the negation of the other. (“Modal” means “having to do with possibility and impossibility.”) 
So the solution to this ‘paradox’, if you wish to call it that, is simply that K1 is false. If we assume that K2 accurately states the meaning of “P.Q”, then we cannot hold that “P.Q” means “if P, then Q.” What we can do is hold that “P.Q” has some other meaning that, in some contexts, is sufficiently similar to the meaning of “if P, then Q” that in some contexts we may overlook the differences. 
The just-described ‘paradox of validity’---namely, that P, if false, entails any given Q (i.e. that nothing doesn’t follow from a false statement)--­is no paradox at all, since the meaning of “P.Q” is not that Q follows from P, but is merely that “P and not-Q” is false. 
Attempts have been made to construct formal logics in which “.” is replaced by some other symbol that really does capture the modal force of “if…then…” In most systems of so-called modal logic, there exists a symbol .. such that “P..Q” means “it is impossible for Q to be false if P is true.” And some logicians, notably Belnap and Anderson, have attempted to replace “.” with a symbol .. such that “P..Q” means “given what P and Q mean, P it is incoherent to suppose that Q is false if P is true.” Such logics are known as “relevance logics”, since they attempt to formalize the concept of one statement’s being relevant to another. But what all of these efforts have in common is that, while admitting that “if P, then Q” is not a strictly truth-conditional notion, they all try to assign a meaning to it that is as close as possible to being strictly truth-conditional. In other words, though they do not take “if P, then Q” to mean “P and not-Q is false”, they attempt to model the meaning of “if P, then Q” as closely as possible on that of “P and not-Q is false”---which for many reasons, some technical, some philosophical, is misconceived. 
As for ‘classical logic’, this so-called ‘paradox’ has no bearing on it at all. A classical logic is any system of logic in which the following two principles hold: 
No statement is both true and false (Law of Non-contradiction) 
Any given statement is either true or false (Law of Excluded Middle) 
Classical logic does not require that the concept expressed by “if” be understood in strictly truth-conditional terms. In fact, it implicitly requires the exact opposite. The motivation for the Law of Non-contradiction is that no statement can possibly be compatible with its own negation—in other words, any given statement entails (meaning that it necessarily warrants the truth of) the negation of its own negation. Therefore, the classical logic is committed, albeit implicitly, to an appropriately non-truth-conditional conception of conditionality (i.e. of the concept expressed by “if…then…”). And classical logic therefore demands a wholesale rejection of the (obviously false, as we have seen) strictly truth-conditional understanding of “if…then…” that generates the just-discussed ‘paradox of validity.’ 

The Self-defeating Nature of Utilitarianism and Consequentialism Generally 
Consider the following scenario by a contemporary philosopher: “Your good friend Erskin rests on his death bed---more accurately, the bed soon to be such. Alone with him, you have just promised that, when he passes on, you too will pass on, will pass on his stash of cash to Laetitia, a young lady friend of his. She knows nothing about the money. Erskin duly dies and in your search for Laetitia, you discover that she is a rich courtesan, as Erskin well knew. You also find---to your amazement---that Erskin has daughters and a former wife, who speak fondly of him, clearly distressed by his death. They live in poverty. Indeed, you could do with some money yourself. What ought you to do?” Argue as a utilitarian or a Kantian, and don’t forget to consider possible objections to your view. 
On his death bed, my friend Erskin asked me to make sure that his fortune be passed on to a lady friend of his. I agreed to honor that wish, but it turns out that there are others who would be more deserving of that money. What am I to do? According to the utilitarian, I should do whatever maximizes human welfare; and if that includes lying, breaking promises, or otherwise ‘using’ people, then so be it. According to the Kantian, I have but one moral obligation, namely, to treat people as ends unto themselves, and I must therefore keep my promise; for if I break it, then, by virtue of making it, I was simply manipulating Erskin out of his money and therefore treating him as a means, as opposed to an end-unto-himself. 
In this paper, I will defend the Kantian position. The basic conceit underlying my argument is that the alternative view is self-undermining: if we regard people as having so little value that they can permissibly be defrauded for a ‘greater good’, then there is no ‘greater good’, since it cannot coherently be supposed that there can be a ‘greater good’ in a world in which people lack moral worth. I will start by showing that the utilitarian position fails on its own terms, the reason being that it presupposes the existence of moral verities that it itself undermines. Then I will show that, precisely because it is thus self-undermining, utilitarianism lacks the one virtue that it is commonly thought to have and Kantianism lacks the one defect that that it is thought to have. Utilitarianism is assumed to make allowances for the welfare for the welfare of the many, and we will find this to be false; and Kantianism is thought to fail to make such allowances, and this too we will find to be false. 
Let us begin by identifying the incoherence internal to utilitarianism. When we’re told that Erskin has a wife and children who need the money, we are expected to regard their interests as having more moral weight than my promise. But there are many people on the planet who could benefit from that money: there are sick children on the other side of the planet who need money for life-saving medical procedures and brilliant entrepreneurs who need start-up capital to launch their projects. So why should be particularly concerned about Erskin’s wife and children? 
The reason is that marriage and parenthood are moral commitments. Married people have responsibilities that single people don’t, and marriage is a commitment to fulfill those responsibilities. Parents (meaning people who raise children, instead of merely having them) have responsibilities that non-parents don’t, and parenthood is a commitment to fulfill those responsibilities. Erskin did not have any such commitments to the aforementioned sick children and brilliant entrepreneurs, and that is why we don’t feel that he has any obligation to help them. Erskin did have such commitments to his wife and children, and that is why we do tend to feel that he has some obligation to help them. 
Here is the rub. I have a similar commitment to Erskin. and if it is morally permissible for me to violate my bond with Erskin, then it is equally morally permissible for Erskin to violate his bonds with his wife and children. The bonds of trust and responsibility that made Erskin responsible for taking care of his wife and children are the same as those that obligate me to keep my promise to him. It is therefore self-defeating to suppose that I should give the money to Erskin’s wife and children, instead of keeping my promise to him. For the very bonds of trust that obliged Erskin to take care of his wife and children, and that would have made it good for me to give them the money, also oblige me to keep my promise to Erskin, and therefore not to give them the money. 
The utilitarian’s position is that we should do the greatest good for the greatest number: and if this means lying, defrauding, manipulating, and the like, then so be it. But what do we mean by ‘the greatest good’? We mean a situation in which the greatest possible number of people can their exercise their autonomy, depend on parents, have truthful relations with friends and colleagues, and the like. In other words, we mean a situation in which people are not defrauding and undermining one another. But whatever it is that makes such a situation worth fighting for also makes it morally to fight for by defrauding people. 
The utilitarian position is that the needs of the many outweigh those of the view, with the consequence that it is indeed morally permissible, if not obligatory, to treat the few as nothing more than means to serving the interests of the many. At first, this seems very reasonable. The problem is that the interests of the many cannot possibly be served in a world in which any given person’s interests can be undermined for the same of some other person’s interests. A world in which the interests of the many are protected is a world in which the many can rely on others not to defraud them, and a world in which it is permissible to defraud the few for the sake of the many is not such a world. 
In conclusion, even though Kantianism initially seems to deprive people of what they deserve, it actually does the opposite, since a Kantian conception of morality is inherent in the very concept of ‘what one deserves’; and even though utilitarianism seems to give people what they deserve, it actually does the opposite, since it is only if anti-utilitarian ethical system, such as Kantianism, is correct that anyone deserves anything. Erskin’s wife and children do seem to deserve the money---and maybe they really do. But so far as they deserve, it is only because we live in a world in which people are not to be manipulated or otherwise treated as mere means and in which, in particular, promises must be kept; and because we live in such a world, my moral obligation is not to give the money to Erskin’s wife and children but is rather to keep my promise to him. 

The Altman-Z Bankruptcy-Prediction Algorithm 
Question 1 (15 Points) 
What are the benefits of utilizing a bankruptcy prediction model such as Altman’s Z score and how would you apply it to a company? (Use a specific company such as Microsoft to apply it). Read the appropriate portions of Module 4 of our Textbook for this Question. 
A company’s Altman Z-score provides a reasonably good indication of a company’s health and, in particular, of its likelihood of going bankrupt within the next two years. If X is a company, X’s Altman Z-score is the sum of the following numbers: 
3.3x(EBIT/total assets) 
1.4x(retained earnings/total assets) 
1.2x(working capital/total assets) 
.99x(sales/total assets) 
0.6x(market value of equity/total liabilities) MVE/TL 
In each case, we have a financial ratio multiplied by a coefficient that, in effect, assigns a certain degree of importance to that ratio. For example, EBIT/total assets is the ratio of a company’s total earnings (before interest and taxes) to its assets and is therefore a measure of the amount of work that those assets are doing. (EBIT is ten times larger than total assets, then total assets are operating with 1000% efficiency; if ten times smaller, then operating with 10% efficiency.) Because this is obviously such an important ratio, it is given a high degree of weight in the form of a large (3.3) coefficient. 
The next three ratios are similar to EBIT/total assets, but not as important, since they take into account taxes and interest and other factors that, although relevant to a company’s health, do not reflect how much work its assets are doing. As for market value of equity/total liabilities (MVE/TL ), this represents total value of stock divided by company-debt---in other words, the real value of equity, after debt is taken into account. This is obviously important, but it is not as important as the other ratios, since, unlike them, it says nothing about how much work company assets are doing---it speaks only to their current value. 
The higher a company’s Altman Z-score, the less likely is imminent bankruptcy, with a score of 3.0 considered the minimum score of a financially healthy company. Right now, Amazon’s Altman Z-score is 6.2--­meaning very little chance of bankruptcy. BlackBerry’s current score is negative, meaning that bankruptcy is highly possible. In 2012, Sears’ score was 2.3 which is low but almost acceptable. In 2017, it had a score of zero and declared bankruptcy that years. Historically, bankruptcy predictions based on Altman Z-scores have been accurate 90% of the time. 

Case Analysis (85 Points) 
Problems in bond ratings and the firms issuing them have led to both Standard and Poor’s as well as Moody’s modifying their ratings criteria. Included in these changes is an attempt to capture more risk elements in the rating process and to more comprehensively quantify potential areas of concern. 
The 2015 document issued by Moody’s explains their ratings criteria and the ratings they have assigned to the software industry. It can be found in the Final Exam Module. This document can be combined with corporate reporting data to apply these ratings criteria to specific companies covered by Moody’s. For this examination please use the 2018 10K for Microsoft provided earlier in the Mid-term Exam Module to apply bond ratings criteria to that company. In other words, utilize the analytics Moody’s applies to the software industry including any metrics that help in identifying and applying both the qualitative and quantitative criteria noted in the Moody’s Report on Software Companies. Please answer the following questions pertaining to the report. 

1) Discuss the five key factors important to Moody’s in assessing credit ratings for the industry. (15) 
Those five factors are: 
Scale Business Profile Profitability Leverage and Coverage Financial Policy 
Scale is cash flow, including free cash flow (cash flow minus expenditures). Obviously the bigger the cash flow, especially of free cash flow, the more robust the company. 
A company's business profile refers to its market-share and its range of goods and markets. A company that has a 100% market share is the only game in town, so to speak, and is therefore in a good position, and one that has a 0% market share is not doing any business at all. Obviously the larger a company's market share, the better. As for diversity of products/services (i.e. range of products/services), this is important because a company that offers only one product/service will go out of business if demand for that products/service dries up. That said, successful companies tend to specialize (consider A1, Goodyear, Microsoft, Coca Cola), and over-diversification of products/services can hurt a company. (This happened to A1 when it started selling seafood sauce, instead of just sticking to steak-sauce.) 
End-market diversity is the number of different markets where goods are sold. Obviously, the more such diversity, the better, other things equal, since a company whose eggs (products) are in one basket (market) is vulnerable to changes in that market. (The ‘other things equal’ rider is important, since the cost of doing business in a given market might exceed the benefits.) 
Geographic diversity is the range of venues (economically distinct areas) where it creates its products/services. As a general rule, some diversity in this respect is desirable as a hedge against contingencies. For example, if a company has all its operations in one place, then a single change could ruin it. (A tornado could destroy its facilities; a new president might decide to nationalize the corresponding industry; a new mayor might raise taxes; etc.) 
Profitability is the ratio of income to expense (‘bang for buck’, essentially). The higher this number, the better, for obvious reasons. 
A company’s leverage is the extent to which it is debt-financed, as opposed to asset-financed; and a company’s coverage is the extent to which it is able to services, in most cases, its debt. Insufficient coverage is a sign of poor financial health, as is excessive leverage. 
A company’s financial policy is the manner in which it deals with its own assets and liabilities. It is a bad sign if management is overly bearish (risk-averse), and shies away from all investment-opportunities, but it is no less a bad sign if it is overly bullish (risk-affine) and invests indiscriminately. It is a very bad sign if a company is slow to pay off its debts, and a good sign if it pays them off ahead of schedule, especially if its timeliness has to do with its having invested the borrowed assets profitably. All of this falls under the rubric of ‘financial policy.’ 

2) Why is it necessary for Moody’s to apply different weights for these factors? How are these factors measured? (10) 
Moody’s weights for these five factors are as follows: 
Leverage and Coverage 30% 
Business Profile 25% 
Financial Policy 20% 
Scale 15% 
Profitability 10% 
If a company cannot service its debt, it will, for purely legal reasons, immediately go out of existence (absent a government-bailout or some other, similarly improbable event). Of the five factors, leverage/coverage is the only one that relates to a company's legal obligations; the others relate to its economic viability. There are no laws against investing unwisely or selling mediocre products; there are laws against not repaying loans, and the penalty is typically liquidation. Consequently, leverage/coverage is weighted the most heavily (30%). 
A company’s business-profile includes its market-share and also includes its ability to survive changes in markets. Being so important, it is weighted the second most heavily (25%). 
A company’s financial policy includes the financial savviness of its management, along with the ability, or inability, to manage debt and to seize opportunities. Financial policy is therefore key to a company’s willingness and ability to grow. Financial policy is key to growth, but not as key to survival as the first two factors, and it is therefore weighted the third most heavily (20%). 
A company's scale is its total cash flow, which reflects the amount of business it is doing. Obviously, a company that is doing a lot of business is, other things equal, better off than one that is only doing a little business. The reason scale is so low on the list, with a weighting of only 15%, is that other things are not always equal. In particular, costs of materials, payroll, interest on debts, not to mention the abilities of key executives, may have critical positive or negative effects on a company’s feasibility. 
A company’s profitability is obviously important, since an unprofitable company is not worth investing in and won’t survive, this being why profitability is on the list. At the same time, it is long-term profits, not short-term profits, that matter. A company can be a pump-and-dump scheme and therefore briefly be very profitable. Consequently, profitability is not to be weighted too heavily, this being why it is ranked last, with a weighting of 10%. 
3) What are some of the assumptions, limitations and other considerations noted by Moody’s in employing this methodology? Are accounting adjustments an issue for Moody’s in applying their criteria? Please note that if so you are not required to make them but please discuss briefly what they consist of. (10) 
The most important such assumptions relate to the discount rate that a company uses when evaluating its own assets. First of all, it cannot be know with certainty at the present time how the value of money will fluctuate in the future; so discount-rates are always assumed, as opposed to known. That said, some discount-rates are more reasonable than others; and when a given company’s financials are based on overly optimistic discount-rates, Moody’s looks into the matter and, if the numbers don’t pan out, asks the company in question to revise its financials accordingly. 
One limitation that Moody’s must adjust for is that accounting and reporting requirements vary from country to country. Another is that even the most conservative financial statements are based on assumptions about interest-rates and markets in general that may prove false. 
There are two kinds of accounting adjustments, standard and non-standard, each of which is relevant to how Moody’s evaluates company­financials. Standard-adjustments include securities, pension-plans, R&D costs, and non-recurring expenses. Non-standard adjustments include debts reported at ‘fair value’ (market value), as well as likely benefits-obligations to future former employees of the company. 
4) Utilizing the data in the 10K for Microsoft please discuss the individual factor mapping results using the company’s own data (financial statements, etc.) and state whether you agree with the individual ratings assigned by Moody’s for each factor. (50) 
For the 2018 fiscal year, Microsoft’s profitability was 15%. This is considered a respectable degree of profitability. 
Its current ratio was 2.9. This figure is high, meaning that, at that time, Microsoft had a high degree of ability to meet its short-term obligations. 
Its quick ratio was 2.86. This figure is high, suggesting that Microsoft was holding to too much cash and therefore was not using its resources as efficiently as possible. 
Microsoft's cash flow was about $5 billion (extremely high), and its net income was about $16.5 billion (extremely high). 
Its total liabilities were just under $95 billion. 
Moody’s gave Microsoft AAA ratings (the highest possible) in every category, except for end-market diversity, geographic diversity, and free cash flow to debt, in which Microsoft received AA ratings. 
In every possible category, without exception, Microsoft was ranked higher than every single one of its competitors. 
In my judgments, these ratings are most part accurate, with some tentative qualifications. The first is that a AA FCF/debt ratio may be too high, given that Microsoft's total liabilities were $95 billion and its free cash flow in December 2018 was about $5 billion. Microsoft being the juggernaut that it is, this rating may well be justified; but if an assessment of Microsoft's FCF/debt were made strictly on the basis of its cash flow and debt, and not on the basis of anything else, an AA rating might be too high. 
As for end-market diversity and geographic diversity, an AA rating seems too low, given that Microsoft has a worldwide customer-base and also has operations on every continent, except for Africa. (This changed in May 2019, when it launched a $100 million facility in Kenya.) 


Application of Cobit-framework (July 24, 2019) 
To whom it may concern: 
There are many components of the COBIT framework that could be improved upon at RutgersCo. I will discuss the three that I believe to the most important. To quote my professor: “There are various components that assist with IT-governance: Culture, Ethics, and Behavior; People, Skills, and Competencies; and Services, Infrastructure, and Applications” (19_06_23_22.19.06.mp4). In this report, I will show that, in the case of RutgersCo, each of these components needs to be improved. 
Processes: One major problem is a lack of well-defined processes and procedures for carrying out tasks, especially—ominously---accounting related tasks. When I first met with the Assistant Controller (in other words, the second-in-command when it comes to managing RutgersCo’s finance’s), the first words out of his mouth were: “Boy, am I glad to see you. We need to get these books closed. The previous controller made a lot of entries himself. I have been trying to follow his work, but I just can’t quite figure out how he worked up some of the entries” (RiderCo’s Acquisition of RutgersCo). This means that procedures for keeping and sharing financial records are insufficiently defined, which is likely to lead both to loss of revenue, excessive or insufficient payments in taxes, and regulatory or even criminal sanctions. Also, the lack of such procedures in this respect leads to extra work for employees, as this quotation indicates, and also disorients employees and diminishes their respect for the company. 
This brings me to another component of the COBIT framework that could be improved at RutgersCo: People, Skills, and Competency. The accounting team at RutgersCo is feeling frustrated, because some of their best people were recently fired, making it hard for them to do their job (RiderCo’s Acquisition of RutgersCo). The purpose of the firings was to free up money for an ad campaign that totally failed, further angering RutgersCo employees. The firings diminished net competency as well as overall morale, and the ad campaign appears, at least to people in RutgersCo accounting department, to have been a callous attempt on the part of management to make quick money at the expensive of fundamentals. “People skills and competencies,” my professor observed, are integral to people “making good decisions” and thereby keeping the business going (19_06_23_22.19.06.mp4). 
Another Cobit-component that needs work here is Services, Infrastructure, and Applications. The accounting system is divided into a number of different modules, each with its own data-base and unable to communicate with one another in simple user-friendly way (RiderCo’s Acquisition of RutgersCo). This necessitates the use of ad hoc methods of communication, which require effort and increase the chance of human effort. Because of the problems with the accounting system, reporting cannot be automated and has to be done by hand, which is labor-intensive and which increases the likelihood of human error—and also increases the likelihood of deliberate falsification on the part of employees, either to minimize effort on their part or in order to commit fraud. 
These problems relate largely to poor IT-control at RutgersCo. Good IT-control requires that all employees involved in either the keep or reporting of finances be using the same system. Right now, this is not the case. There appear to be independent systems, each with its own database. The fact that multiple databases are used is likely to lead to multiple sets of company books, resulting in management having to arbitrarily choose between different sets of financial records, leading to loss of revenue and possible legal problems. 
Another IT-related problem is that there are unclear protocols relating to the cashing of checks. There should be one person or group of persons who cash checks. But right now, this is not the case, and checks are cashed by employees who happen to be in possession of them. Since these employees are in many cases not formally required to do this, the result is likely to that checks from clients simply are not cashed. Another possibility is that these employees embezzle by endorsing the checks to themselves instead of the company. There should be a well-defined company treasurer, which, at present, there is not. 
Another IT-related problem is that there are poor policies and poor communications relating to the commission-levels of sales personnel. According to one member of the accounting team, practically every single salesperson had a different agreement with management as to how much he was to receive in bonuses and as to what his commission-levels were (RiderCo’s Acquisition of RutgersCo). In fact, it appeared that different salespersons had simply gone rogue and were simply deciding for themselves what their commissions should be. This could lead to embezzlement on a large scale and, at the very least, could least to money-wastage. Also, if, as I likely under the current scenario, a given salesperson gave inconsistent reports concerning his commissions and bonuses to different members of the accounting, the result would be inconsistent records, wasted revenue, and possible regulatory and even criminal sanctions. “The culture, ethics, and behavior of individuals”, my professor said, has a significant effect on the “success of government and management activities” (19_06_23_22.19.06.mp4), and in the case of RutgersCo, the culture is one of low morale, there is a lack of internal possibly leading to loose ethics, and employee-behavior is correspondingly erratic, with an ‘every-man-for­himself’ mentality prevailing.

Introduction 
This present work is a financial analysis of Microsoft during the years 2017-2018. 2016 is included when the necessary data is available in course-documents. Other years are excluded. This analysis is not complete and it focuses only on the absolutely crucial financial indicators. Microsoft’s financials are compared to Oracle’s, so as to provide information as to Microsoft’s performance relative to its competitors. 
Our main source of information about Microsoft is Microsoft’s 2018 10-K form (specifically pages 50-53). Our main source of information about Oracle is Oracle’s income statement, accessed at 
http://financials.morningstar.com/income-statement/is.html? 
t=ORCL&region=usa&culture=en-US. 
The 
financial 
data 
provided 
in 
those 
documents rounds figures to the nearest thousandth. All specific financial data relating to Microsoft and Oracle come from these sources unless there is an indication otherwise. 
Microsoft’s performance during this time-period is positive in absolute terms. Microsoft also marginally outperforms Oracle. That said, the one companies financials parallel each other to a striking degree: Microsoft has more total assets, but its performance relative to its total assets is similar to (though marginally better than) Oracle’s performance relative to its total assets. Between 2017 and 2018, there are dips in Microsoft’s performance, but those are corresponding dips in Oracle’s performance, indicating that the issue is not with Microsoft itself but with the industry as a whole. 

Operating Cash Flow 
When conducting a financial analysis of a company, the first step is to determine its cash flow from operating activities, or operating cash flow (OCF), this being the amount of money that it generates from its activities, excluding long-term investments.[1] 
In 2016, Microsoft’s OCF was $33,325,000; in 2017, $35,507,000; and in 2018, $42,884,000. It is a good sign that Microsoft's OCF was positive during each of these years since this indicates that its products and services were generating income. A company whose OCF is zero or negative can still profit since it can make money from investments and assets, but its products and services are failing to generate income, and its position is therefore unstable. Also, Microsoft’s OCF grew over 30% during this period---also a positive sign. 
Microsoft’s net income (revenues minus expenses, i.e. profits) in 2016 was $20,539,000; in 2017, $25, 489,000; and in 2018, $16, 571,000. During each year, Microsoft’s net income was positive, but its net income fell by $8,918,000---a drop of over 34% (10K p. 52). 
Oracle’s OCF in 2016 was $13, 561, 000; in 2017, $14,126,000; and in 2018, $15,386,000. Oracle’s net income in 2016 was $8,901,000; in 2017, $9,335,000; and in 2018, $3,825,000. Oracle’s OCF was positive during each of these years, and also increased during this time period by around 13%. Between 2017 and 2018, Oracle’s net income plummeted, falling by over 50%. Since its OCF grew during this period, the fall does not indicate a decline in demand for Oracle products and services. 

Common Equity 
In 2016, Microsoft’s common equity (the amount invested by shareholders) was $68, 465, 000; in 2017, 68, 178,000; and in 2018, $69,315,000. There was therefore modest growth in Microsoft common equity during this period. In 2016, Oracle’s common equity was $164, 950, 000; in 2017, $209, 937, 000; and in 2018, $175,569,000.[2] 
Oracle’s performance here is more jagged than Microsoft’s but also better on the whole. 

Profitability 
The next few sections focus on financials relating to Microsoft’s degree of profitability. We will see that Microsoft is ‘in the black’, so to speak, and also compares better than Oracle, a representative competitor. 

Return on Equity 
In 2015, Microsoft’s return on equity (net income divided by shareholder’s equity, this being the change in the value of the shareholder’s equity) was 15.3%; in 2016, 26.9%; in 2017, 31.8%; and in 2018, 19.4% During each year, ROE is positive. At the same time, there was a decrease from 2017 to 2018. 
Oracle’s ROE in 2015 was 12.8%; in 2016, 10.3%and in 2017, 9.7%; and in 2018, 3.4%. In each year, ROE is positive, but much smaller than with Microsoft. Also, with Oracle, as with Microsoft, we see a 2017-2018 drop. This parallel suggests that in both cases the drop is a consequence not of anything company-specific but rather of some larger economic phenomenon. 
2015  2016  2017  2018  
Microsoft  15.3%  26.9%  31.8%  19.4%  
Oracle  12.8%  10.3%  9.7%  3.4%  


Net Profit Margin 
In 2015, Microsoft’s net profit margin (net income divided by total revenue, i.e. percentage of revenue that Microsoft retained after paying expenses) was 13.9%; in 2016, 22.5%; in in 107, 26.3%; and in 2018, 15%. The profit margins are all positive, though there is a (now familiar) 2017­2018 drop. 
Oracle's net profit margin in 2015 was 27.9%; in 2016, 23.7%; in 2017, 25.3%; and in 2018, 10.2%. Again, profit margins are positive, with a 2017-2018 drop. Microsoft's profit margin appears to track Oracle's, suggesting that changes in them are due not to company-specific but rather to industry-wide factors. 
2015  2016  2017  2018  
Microsoft  15.3%  26.9%  31.8%  19.4%  
Oracle  27.9%  23.7%  25.3%  10.2%  


Asset Turnover 
Asset turnover is significant because it is a good measure of a company’s health. A company with low-asset turnover is not using its assets efficiently, and a company with high-asset turnover is using them efficiently. 
In 2015, Microsoft’s asset turnover (total revenue divided by total assets) was 53%; in 2016, 44%; in 2017, 37%; and in 2018, 43%. In 2015, Oracle’s asset turnover was 34%; in 2016, 33%; in 2017, 28%; and in 2018, 
29%.[3] 
We are seeing parallels—increases in both cases, albeit higher ones in Microsoft’s case. 
2015  2016  2017  2018  
Microsoft  53%  44%  37%  43%  
Oracle  34%  33%  28%  29%  


Leverage 
In 2015, Microsoft’s leverage (debt/equity) was 34.7%; in 2016, 56.6%; in 2017, 86.7%; and in 2018, 87.3%. In 2015, Oracle’s asset turnover was 81%; in 2016, 84%; in 2017, 110%; and in 2018, 230%.[4] 
Both companies are highly leveraged, but Microsoft’s debt/equity ratio is always less than one, meaning that it has more assets than debts, and Oracles debt/equity is greater than one, meaning that is liabilities exceed its assets. A 
high degree of leverage can be a bad sign, since it can indicate deficit financing, but here it is not a bad sign, as it seems to indicate aggressive and successful investments in a growing economic sector.[5]

Return on Assets 
In 2015, Microsoft’s return on assets (ROA), i.e.net income divided by total assets, was 6.9%; in 2016, it was 8.6%; in 2017, 8.8%; and in 2018. 6.4%. In 2015, Oracle’s asset turnover was 8.8%; in 2016, 6.9%; in 2017, 7.1%; and in 2018, 3.1%[6] 
Both ROA’s are low but positive.

Liquidity Ratios Current Ratio 
The current ratio measures a company’s ability to pay its short-term obligations. The higher the ratio, the lower the likelihood of defaulting on such debts. Ratios above 1:1 (100%) are considered good, and lower ratios are considered bad. Microsoft’s current ratio is low, whereas Oracle’s is high as of 2018, though low before then.

Quick Ratio 
The quick ratio is like the current ratio except that non-liquid assets are excluded from this figure. As with current ratio, a ratio of 1:1 (100%) or higher is considered good, and anything lower is considered bad. Again, Oracle’s quick ratio is better than Microsoft’s.

Ebit Interest Coverage 
The Ebit Interest Coverage ratio determines how capable a company is paying the interest on its debt. Obviously should be a least one, since it will otherwise be unable to service its loan-debt. The higher the number, the better. We see here that Microsoft’s numbers compare favorably to Oracles and are also much higher than one.

Average Days to Collect Receivables 
Average days to collect receivables is the average number of days that it takes a company to collect payment for services rendered. The number for Microsoft is conspicuously high, which is ambiguous but which could correspond to the fact that Microsoft’s customers are ‘captives’ who Microsoft knows will eventually pay up.

Microsoft  73  72  77  80  
Oracle  14  17  11  13  


Conclusion 
Microsoft and Oracle are both vigorous companies with high operating cash flows and asset-turnovers. They are highly leveraged, but this seems to be because they have thus far profited from aggressive investments in their own growth.

Eco-friendly Dieting: A Bachelor’s Story 
When I was in high school, my mother prepared most of my meals, and I ate healthy. Also, I was an athlete, and it simply wasn’t an option for me to eat junk. During college, sadly, that has changed, and I’ve gotten into the habit of eating highly processed food that comes in plastic packaging. This assignment required me to make pretty significant adjustments to my eating habits. I think I could sustain those habits, and it would actually be good for my health and possibly my mood if I did so, but it would involve my making some non-trivial life-changes. In any case, I did succeed in making my diet more eco-friendly for two days, but it wasn't easy and I had only limited success, mainly because my eating habits are currently eco-unfriendly in the extreme. 
For me, breakfast is usually a few microwaved breakfast burritos, which I wash down with Mountain Dew. I often grab a bite to eat on campus. I usually have a cheeseburger or a couple of slices of pizza, along with a soft drink. In between classes, I often eat candy bars. Dinner is usually pizza, with pepperoni and extra cheese, and a soft drink. When I’m at home, I eat a lot of plastic-wrapped snacks in between meals, mainly potato chips. If I’m not at home, I tend to have fast-food for dinner---usually a couple of big macs and a side of fries, which I wash down with a coke. 
After doing some research, I put together a two-day plan for reducing the diet-based part of my ecological footprint. I would have to forego the snacks—no potato chips or candy bars or anything else that is processed or wrapped in plastic. Plus, I couldn’t eat anything cow-based so no beef or cheese, given how much methane cows produce and also given how much petroleum is involved in feeding them. During those two days, I could not eat anything that I am used to eating. I couldn’t even drink what I’m used to drinking, since I pretty much only drink soft-drinks that come in plastic bottles. During those days, I decided, breakfast would be eggs and toast—no sausage or bacon. I didn’t know what to do about lunch, so I just had egg­and-toast sandwiches. Dinner would be pasta with homemade sauce for dinner. There would be no meat in the sauce, but I would allow myself a little bit of parmesan cheese. I knew that I wouldn’t be able to resist eating snacks in between meals; so I decided that I would eat trail-mix instead. Also, I prepared the trail-mix myself (raisins, peanuts, chocolate chips, and cashews), so as to minimize the use of plastic. Instead of drinking soda, I would drink water. I already have a Britta filter and an ice-maker, so this was not too much of a problem. 
I actually stuck with this plan for the whole two days. And I felt better. I noticed that I felt less fatigue after meals and had more energy in general, even though I was consuming fewer calories. I could not sustain that exact diet, since I need some kind of meat in my diet. The most eco-friendly—and also the healthiest—form of meat is fish. Unfortunately, I don’t know how to prepare fish (or anything else, really) in an appetizing way, and that has to change if I’m going to have an eco-friendly diet on a long-term basis. In fact, the main lesson of all this for me, at least on a practical level, is that eating healthy and eco-friendly involves knowing how to cook. If I did learn how to prepare a few healthy dishes, I could definitely sustain a relatively eco­friendly diet in perpetuity. I don’t know whether this would lower my the diet-based part of my ecological footprint to an acceptable level, but it would indeed reduce it. 

Advanced Reading and Writing Semester Project Proposal: Designer Babies 
Topic: Designer babies. 
Context: Thanks to gene editing technology, human beings will likely soon have the ability to ‘design' their own babies by altering their genetic make-up. Depending on how it is used, this technology can do great good or great harm. It can help eliminate congenital illnesses and defects. At the same time, it can be used for questionable commercial, military, or political aims. Also, because it is likely to be expensive, unequal access to it would drive a wedge between rich and poor and it might even be used as a way for the rich to tyrannize the poor. 
Research question: What kinds of public policies would help ensure that this technology would benefit the greatest number of people. 
Preliminary thesis statement: While the use of gene editing technology to create ‘designer babies’ could create problems, these problems can be 
controlled through appropriate policies, with the effect that this technology benefits everyone, and not just a select few. 
Organizational structure: Proposal (Problem-solution) 
Introduction style: Scientific and factual. 
Rough outline: 1. The scientific facts relating to the history and probable future of gene editing technology and, in particular, to its likely use to create ‘designer babies.’ 
2. 
Gene editing technology, especially its use to create defect-free children, has the potential to do a great deal of good for society. At the same time, because it is likely to be expensive, it is likely to exacerbate disparities between rich and poor, and it must therefore be determined what kinds of laws and regulations allow society to enjoy the benefits of this technology while minimizing the injustices that could arise from it. 

3. 
Gene editing technology dates back to the early 2000s, but it wasn't until 2017 that a recently discovered technology known as CRISPR made it possible to edit genes reliably and precisely. Thanks to the invention of the CRISPR, gene editing can be now be used for medical purposes, and it will is likely that it will soon be possible to use CRISPR to create ‘designer babies.’ 

4. 
Because CRISPR is expensive, only the super-wealthy can afford to use it. So the immediate question that arises is what kinds of legal and regulatory changes will help provide those who are not wealthy with access to this technology. Other problems that are likely to arise soon concern the ethical limits of gene editing: Should the use of CRISPR be restricted to preventing instances of congenital illness? Or should it be used to create ‘beautiful' and ‘smart' and otherwise ‘perfect' babies? If so, what kind of health-care reforms are needed to prevent such uses from being used in a discriminatory manner? 

5. 
It is likely that private corporations will do more than Congress to ensure equal access to CRISPR technology, given the political gridlock that prevents legislation, especially healthcare-related legislation, from going through. 

6. 
It is likely that CRISPR technology, and gene editing technology in general, will continue to develop. What cannot be predicted is whether people who need it will have access to it; nor can it be predicted whether it will be used for good as opposed to evil. Law-makers tend to lack unanimity when it 

comes to matters relating to healthcare, and a more promising avenue is to appeal to civic-minded tech-magnates. 

7. 
The bottom line is that gene editing can eliminate illness and improve human life. Also, although gene editing is now expensive, technology tends to become less expensive over time. In the 1980s, only the super-wealthy could afford computers; now everyone can afford them. This may happen with CRISPR. At the same time, policymakers should hedge by beginning to grapple with the problems discussed above. Conclusion style: Dispassionate and consensus-building. We must approach this issue in a non-divisive manner. Our objective is not to alienate the very people and corporations who have access to CRISPR with accusations but is rather to figure out how to make it in their interest to make this technology widely available.

Microsoft Five Forces Analysis 

Introduction 
Microsoft is the world’s two leading supplier of software products, the other being Apple, with the two companies being nearly equal in terms of net worth.[7] 
Microsoft is best known for the Windows Operating System, used on all PC’s, which has a 90% market-share in the digital operating system market. Microsoft is also known for, and derives enormous revenue from, a number of other products, including Microsoft Word, Excel, Skype, Bing, OneDrive, Minecraft, LinkedIn, Cortana, and PowerPoint.[8] 
Microsoft’s annual revenue (as of 2018) is $110 billion, its annual profits are $16 billion, and its market capitalization (overall value) is $775 billion (10K 62). Apple’s annual revenue (as of 2018) is $230 billion, its profits are $10 billion, and its market capitalization is $700 billion.[9] 
The third largest player in the software is IBM, with annual revenue of $15 billion, net profits of $3 billion, and market capitalization of $110 billion (IBIS 22). 
The present study is a Porter’s Five-forces analysis of Microsoft. A Porter’s Five-forces analysis examines a company in terms of the following parameters: competition within its industry, potential of new entrants into that industry, power of suppliers, power of customers, and threat of substitutes. Each of these forces, whether favorable or unfavorable to the company being analyzed, is ranked as either ‘strong’, ‘moderate’, or ‘weak.’ 

Industry Competition (Strong Force) 
Competition within the software industry is fierce. There is intense rivalry on the part of Apple to switch to its operating system. Also, Apple, as well each of the many lesser players, are highly innovative and are rapidly developing products that could chip away at Microsoft’s position. Apple, for example, is known for its smart phone, iPods, and computer-tablets. [10] 

Microsoft’s versions of these products were not successful, although it did stave off the potential economic losses by establishing lucrative partnerships with successful players in these markets, notably Samsung, whose Android phone operating system is the leading smart-phone operating system and from the sales of which Microsoft is now the largest beneficiary. 
Switching costs for existing Microsoft customers are high. It is inconvenient and expensive for users of Windows and related applications to switch to non-Microsoft products. This is because such products are easy to use and tend to be bundled together in ways that are highly functional and that are difficult or impossible to replicate with non-Microsoft products. This force favors Microsoft. 
Other firms in this industry, including but not limited to Apple, are extremely innovative and are also aggressive in marketing their products. Microsoft is not as innovative as Apple or as many of its much smaller competitors. Microsoft counters this, with some success, by buying up patents and buying into companies that offer innovations that it is not itself providing. [11] 

There is a high degree of product-diversity in the software industry, which is a strong force that works against Microsoft, since it could lead, and in some cases has led, to substitutes for Microsoft products and also to products that simply render them obsolete. 

Bargaining Power of Customers (Weak Force) 
Switching costs for Microsoft customers are high, as previously stated, mainly because Windows, Microsoft’s highest earning product, is easy to use and also bundled with a number of applications in a way that can be replicated only with difficulty using non-Microsoft softwares. Microsoft’s great strength is that it offers products (e.g. Excel, Microsoft Word, PowerPoint) at least one or two of which many simply have no choice but to use, and then links that product’s functionality with those of other products for which those same customers are likely to have at least some use. For example, all people who do anything involving writing for a living need to use a product functionally similar to Microsoft Word. If they choose an alternative to Microsoft Word, they find, first, that those products tend to be bug-infested and, second, that if they want to convert them into PDF format or embed photos in them, they are simply out of luck. 
Also, many businesses use Microsoft products and also rely on their high degree of co-functionality with one another with non-Microsoft products. This would make it difficult, and in many cases impossible, for Microsoft’s numerous existing business customers to switch brands. 

Bargaining Power of Suppliers (Moderate Force) 
Microsoft offers a range of different products, and it also relies on many different products and technologies for its own R&D. This makes it vulnerable to shifts in prices in the corresponding raw materials (IBIS 32). In particular, Microsoft is vulnerable to shifts in copper (for the copper wiring in the operating systems that it manufactures) and in petroleum (use for the plastic in the casing, which it also sells). These are both price-volatile commodities, potentially posing a problem for Microsoft. 

Threat of Substitutes (Weak Force) 
It is often difficult and sometimes impossible for Microsoft customers to switch to other brands. Non-Microsoft versions of Word and Excel do not work very well and have lower functionality than their Microsoft counterparts. Also, Microsoft makes its products easy to use with one another and with related Non-Microsoft products. For example, Microsoft Word documents are easily saved to OneDrive, which is Microsoft’s Cloud Storage service; and Microsoft Word documents can easily be saved as Adobe PDF files (and vice versa). [12] 
Also, Microsoft makes it easy to import numbers into Excel Files, and it has loaded Excel with extremely useful and easy to use accounting features. These products and integrated functionalities are not offered by other companies, making switching a non-option in most cases. 
Also, Microsoft aggressively litigates would-be rival purveyors of alternatives on patent-grounds, helping to perverse its position. At the same time, Microsoft products can be cloned and pirated. Because the technology involved in cloning Microsoft products is still rather unwieldy, people are better off simply buying them from Microsoft. But as those products get easier to use, this could potentially change. But this is not likely to happen any time soon, given that these pirated products, though functional on their own, cannot be used in conjunction with Microsoft products. So for example, while it not hard to clone Microsoft Word software, documents made with Word-clones cannot be converted into Adobe PDF’s; nor could numerical data on them imported into Microsoft Excel files. [13] 
Replicating cross-application functionalities would involve systematic pirating of Microsoft-technology, which would not be easy to do. 

Threat of New Entrants (Moderate Force) 
Any given Microsoft product can be replicated, either legally or illegally, and any such product could, on its own, be mass-produced relatively inexpensively. The problem for would-be competitors is that Microsoft products are co-functional with many non-Microsoft products and these Microsoft has exclusivity agreements with these other companies, which limit the amount of functionality that non-Microsoft products can have. For example, Microsoft word documents have a feature whereby users can dictate words, instead of having to type them. This feature is easily replicated, but it couldn’t be used on PC’s made by any existing company, since they have contracted with Microsoft to block use of such application 
with any non-Microsoft product.[14] 

At the same time, there are many small companies that already create analogues of Microsoft-products, and such a company would be a threat if it had the financing needed to market itself and to establish legally protected Microsoft-style product-integrations with related companies. The chances of this are small but not negligible. 

Conclusion 
Microsoft’s position is relatively secure. It offers useful and easy to use products for low prices, and those products have useful integrations with one another and with non-Microsoft products. In addition, Microsoft protects itself against rivals either by contracting with them, as it did with Samsung, effectively buying them out, or entering into exclusivity agreements that limit the extent to which non-Microsoft products can have the range of uses as Microsoft products. Microsoft’s vulnerability is its current lack of innovativeness. But because Microsoft hedges against this problem by simply buying out would-be competitors, it is likely to retain its position as one of the top two software providers for the foreseeable future.

Wittgenstein on Language and Thought (Philosophy) 
It is obvious that linguistic competence (the ability to use and understand language) enhances the ability to think. But does it constitute that ability? In other words, is it identical with that ability? 
Ludwig Wittgenstein says ‘yes’. And he supports his position with two famous arguments of his: the ‘Private Language” argument and the ‘Rule-following argument’. 
According to the ‘Private Language’, one cannot invent a ‘private language’, except by translating some pre-existing public language into private terms. Wittgenstein’s argument is that semantic rules (rules that assign meanings to expressions) are, like all rules, null and void—and therefore as good as non-existence—unless enforced. And, so Wittgenstein also holds, the semantic rules of a private language would be unenforced— and therefore null and void. Therefore, so Wittgenstein concludes, a private language (that isn’t just a re-boot of a pre-existing public language) is impossible. 
According to the Rule Following argument, there can be no such thing as a ‘private rule’; in other words, one cannot impose a rule on oneself: all genuine rules are social rules, meaning that they involve pluralities of people. Wittgenstein’s argument for this is similar to the Private Language Argument: unenforced rules are non-rules and private rules are unenforced. 
Wittgenstein also holds that thinking involves following rules—his argument, so far as he has one, being that, unless mental activity is rule-governed, it isn’t principled and, unless it is principled, it isn’t thought so much as it is mere free association or mere sensation, or some such. 
Wittgenstein thus holds that thinking involves the following rules. He also holds that rules are inherently public. So he is forced by these starting points to find some set of public rules the following of which can reasonably be identified with the act of thinking. And he understandably believes that linguistic rules are the only rules that meet this requirement. And it follows from these assumptions that, indeed, thought is inherently linguistic, i.e. that linguistic competence is constitutive of cognitive competence. 
But Wittgenstein is wrong and his argument is bad. First of all, thought is needed in order to understand or operate with semantic rules. Without thought, a creature can make noises, but it cannot speak. The difference between a coffee-maker that makes noise and a person that speaks is that the latter, but not the former, understands the rules that link meaning to sounds. So Wittgenstein is simply false. 
Plus, not all thought is linguistic. There is visual thought, musical thought, etc. And there is no plausible way to identify these with the manipulating of linguistic symbols. 
Given that Wittgenstein’s position is false, there must be a flaw in his reasoning. And indeed there is: Wittgenstein is wrong to assume that non­public rules can be violated with impunity. Suppose that I invent a private code in which I tell myself that X means ‘poisonous berries’ and Y means ‘non-poisonous berries.’ If I misinterpret my own language, I won’t be penalized by other people—the ‘language police’ won’t get on my case—but I will indeed be penalized, as I will eat the poisonous berries and die. 
So the situation here is simply. Wittgenstein gave a bad argument for a wrong and implausible idea, and that’s the end of it. 

Camus and Schopenhauer on the Meaning of Life (Philosophy) 
Instructions: 
Please, answer the following essay question. Read the question closely and make sure to address all of its parts. The recommended length for your answer is: min. 500 words – max. 600 words. 
Q. How does Schopenhauer arrive at the basic insight that life is suffering? Under these apparently frustrating conditions, what is the best (or “least bad”) way to live, according to him? Next, what does Camus mean by “the absurd” and how shall we cope with it? What do Schopenhauer’s take on life and Camus’s take on life have in common, and in what ways are they different? Whose view of life do you find more convincing, and why? 
Schopenhauer believes that life is suffering. Camus believes that life is absurd. They thus both seem to have a fundamentally negative conception of life. To this extent, their conceptions of life are similar or at least seem to be. But scrutiny of their respective positions proves them to be very different. 
First of all, one can hold that life is fundamentally an exercise in suffering without holding that life is meaningless or ‘absurd’. Steve Jobs spent most of his life struggling to achieve success. And the amount of time that he spent struggling to achieve success may well have exceeded the amount of time that he actually enjoyed it. But was his life meaningless? No. 
Second, one can hold that life is fundamentally not about suffering without holding that it is absurd. In fact, people who have a hedonistic approach to life seem to be of the view that life is absurd. Also, if life is fundamentally an exercise in suffering, then it would seem that life does have meaning, its meaning being given to it by one’s need to minimize or eliminate suffering. And life is drained of meaning to the extent that it is free of adversity. 
This actually seems to be Schopenhauer’s own view. “Life without pain has no meaning”, Schopenhauer writes. Schopenhauer’s position is that pleasure and happiness are low-probability conditions, since they are unstable and hard to achieve, and that pain and unhappiness are high-probability conditions, since they are stable and easy to achieve. From this, Schopenhauer deduces that life is more about pain than pleasure, more about unhappiness than happiness. 
But Schopenhauer does not hold that life is meaningless. As already indicated, he holds that at least some strife is necessary for meaning. Second, he holds that pain and unhappiness can be minimized. In Schopenhauer’s view, people tend to have a preconception to the effect that life is supposed to make them happy; and if one lets go of that preconception, one is allowing life to be happy in its own way. 
Camus does not hold that life is necessarily painful. At the same time, Camus does hold that life is ‘absurd.’ By this Camus means that only that life does not supply Man with a meaning: [15] 
But Camus also holds that, if life did have some pre-existing meaning, that fact would hem us in. And the fact that it doesn’t, so Camus holds, allows us to be free.”[16] 

Although Camus’ views about the meaning(fulness) of life differ from Schopenhauer’s, both views coincide in one respect. According to both, it is by accepting that which is negative in life that one stands to gain what is positive in it. Says Camus: “You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.”[17] 
Says Schopenhauer: “If you accustom yourself to this view of life you will regulate your expectations accordingly, and cease to look upon all its disagreeable incidents … as anything unusual or irregular; nay, you will find everything is as it should be, in a world where each of us pays the penalty of existence in [their] own particular way.” [18] 



Are Late-term Abortions Ethical? (Philosophy) 
A late-term abortion is one that is performed in the third trimester of pregnancy. Are such abortions ethical? In this paper, I consider the work of four reputable scholars, two of whom argue that late-term abortions are ethical and two of whom argue that they are unethical. I arrive at the position that late-term abortions are unethical. 
Before we consider what these scholars say, let us make some general points of a philosophical nature. 
When an abortion is performed, two parties are involved: the mother and the fetus. The mother clearly has ethical rights, since she is indisputably a person. But does the fetus have rights? This is not clear, because it is not clear whether the fetus is a person. If the fetus is a person, then the fetus has rights. If the fetus is not a person--if it is a subhuman or a pre-person--then it either has no rights or has fewer rights than a person. 
A newborn infant is considered a person. A newborn infant does not have particularly well-developed reasoning capabilities, but it has consciousness, it can experience sensations and perceptions, and it can experience emotion. A one day old fetus is probably not a person since it has none of these attributes. 
Should it turn out that a fetus in the third trimester has all of the psychological attributes of a one-day old infant, then it would have rights. In particular, it would have the right to live. In any case, the question whether the fetus is psychologically comparable to a newborn is a medical question and can be answered only on the basis of knowledge of its nervous system and the like. 
According to Kenneth E. Himma, a professor of philosophy, late term abortions are perfectly ethical. His argument is that fetuses are not conscious, do not feel pain, do not make moral judgments and for these reasons fail to be people. 
According to Sara Miller, a journalist, late-term fetuses don’t feel pain and, indeed, don’t feel anything and are not therefore not people. 
According to Don Berkich, a professor of philosophy, fetuses will become people, even if they are not currently people, and in having an abortion, one is, as it were, killing the person that the fetus is going to be: one is robbing it of ‘a future like ours,’ as Berkich puts it. 
According to Maureen Condic, a professor of neurobiology, there is strong medical evidence to suggest that late-term fetuses can feel pain and have other psychological traits specific to human beings; and for this reason, Condic alleges, late-term abortions are ethically wrong. 
The medical evidence strongly suggests that Condic is right. Late-term fetuses are neurologically sufficiently similar to newborn infants that the former may reasonably be presumed to have the same psychological characteristics as the latter, a corollary being that the former have whatever ethical rights the latter have. The arguments put forth by Himma and Miller are therefore null and void, as they are based on false medical claims concerning the biological condition of late-term fetuses. As for Berkich’s claim that abortion robs the fetus of its future, this claim is consistent with the fact that, judging by the relevant neurobiological benchmarks, the fetus is indeed a person. 

Exploring Music Assignment 1 
This particular work---“Scared to be Lonely” by Martin Garrix and sung by Dua Lipa[19]--was probably more on the repetitive side than on the variable side, but it was, at the end of the day, a pretty healthy mix. Also, it has a nice balance of voice and instrumentation, including some Hybrid (electronic) instrumentation. 
The meter was 4:4. It was slow to medium-paced. 
The tonality was jazz/rock/blues---I’m not sure how exactly to categorize it, but it’s in the same category as Jamiroquai and Alanis Morrissette.

Chapter 1 Introduction to the Study 


Introduction 
Thanks to the internet, it is dramatically easier than it used to be for consumers to know what is supplied and for suppliers to know what is demanded. Prices have dropped; quality has increased; selection has grown exponentially; efficiency has increased exponentially. The internet makes information easy to acquire and easy to send, and that is why it has revolutionized commerce (Bauer & Latzer, 2016). 
One of the few economic sectors that the internet has not benefited is education (Slimp, 2019). Since the world went online in the late '90s, tuitions have increased, and quality of instruction has fallen. This is deeply paradoxical. Educators are information-providers; so the internet should in principle be driving tuitions down and drive quality of instruction up. 
There are two different academic disciplines---Knowledge Management (KM) and Information Economics (IE)—that should both explain and solve this problem (Hawamdeh, 2007). KM is the study of how institutions can improve internal communications and, on that basis, self-optimize (Dalkir 2018). IE is the study of knowledge-markets (Stiglitz 1985), a knowledge market being a market in which information is what is bought and sold. Each of these disciplines is young, with IE coming into existence in the '80s and KM coming into existence in the '90s. Neither discipline has said much of anything about the failure of the internet to improve education (Birchler & Butler, 2007). Further, neither has to any degree improved education or even tried to do so, there being no documented cases of any school self-optimizing or even trying to self-optimize on the basis of results from each discipline. 
At the same time, each discipline is rich in results that can be used to optimize education. The basic tenet of IE is that markets must be transparent in order to function; in other words, the values of assets must be known and those assets must be priced accordingly (Stiglitz 1985). The basic tenet of KM is that organizations must be transparent in order to function; in other words, the values of employees must be known and those employees must be positioned accordingly (Dalkir 2018). How these tenets are to be operationalized depends on the context. But each has been successfully operationalized in several different contexts, and prima facie there is nothing about the field of education that would make it especially difficult to figure how to operationalize them in that context (Friedman, 2012). The only reason it has not yet been figured out is, evidently, that nobody has tried (Law, 2020). 

Background to the Study 
In traditional economic theory, it is assumed that all market participants have equal access to information. This is, of course, false, as Hayek (1945) observed. People differ radically in respect of what they know. According to Hayek, these differences will help society, rather than hurt it, so long as governments don’t manipulate prices. When prices are set by the market, Hayek reasoned, they correctly degrees of supply and demand, and anyone who knows what prices are, no matter how ignorant he might otherwise be, can service demand and profit. 
This model is known as Efficient Market Theory (Arrow, 1999). Efficient Market Theory (EMT) embodies two distinct contentions: first, that markets are efficient when assets are appropriately priced; second, that assets are appropriately priced when governments don’t alter prices. The first contention has proven to be unqualifiedly accurate (Friedman 2012, Sowell 2016). The second has proven to be true of some markets (Lo 2017) and false or only partly true of others (Arrow 1996, Sen 2006, Tirole 2017). What matters in this context is that it is an attempt to figure out how markets must be arranged if assets, including information, are to be generated and distributed with maximal efficiency. According to Milton Friedman (1955), a corollary of EMT is that education cannot be efficient without being completely deregulated. 
In his (1963) paper “Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care”, Kenneth Arrow proved that it is impossible for knowledge to be equitably distributed in healthcare markets and that such markets therefore tend to be inefficient. George Akerlof (1970), Michael Spence (1970) Joseph Stiglitz (1975) proved the same to be true of information-markets: in other words, information is not and cannot possibly be equitably distributed in markets in which information is itself what is bought and sold, a corollary being that such markets therefore naturally tend to be inefficient. It was with the work of these three authors that IE became an autonomous subdiscipline of economics. 
The discipline of information economics has had virtually nothing to say about education (Akinyemi, 2013). This is surprising for many reasons. First, the education industry is a textbook case of a knowledge-market. Also, given how large the US Education Industry is, the macroeconomic consequences of inefficiencies in it, especially of inefficiencies resulting from inequitably distributed information, are virtually incalculable. (According to Bryant and Sarakatsannis (2015) “US education is a $1.5 trillion industry 
and growing at 5 percent annually.”)Finally, American education is both highly regulated and highly inefficient, making it an ideal testing ground for the very kinds of deregulation that economists so vehemently advocate in other industries. 
Like IE, KM has been curiously silent about education. KM came into existence in the earlyv90's, when companies began hiring Chief Knowledge Officers. A CKO’s job is to organize and optimally deploy a company’s ‘intangible assets.’ An intangible asset is simply one that is not physical, and knowledge itself is one of the most important kinds of intangible assets. Ikujiro Nonaka’s (1991) article “The Knowledge Creating Company”, published in the Harvard Business Review, introduced the concept of Knowledge Management to the academic community. In 1998, Thomas Stewart, editor of the Harvard Business Review, published his book Intellectual Capital: The New Wealth of Organizations. This helped give additional credibility to KM, both inside and outside of academia. Within a few years, it became customary for universities to offer courses in KM. 
The central tenet of KM is that companies gain by treating knowledge as a veritable asset, comparable to machinery or land, and lose when they treat it as a mere asset-precursor (Gupta 2004, Dalkir 2018). Exactly what is involved in treating knowledge as a veritable asset depends on the context. 
Within practically any large company outside of academia, there is at least one person whose job title is ‘knowledge manager.' But this position simply doesn't exist in schools and universities, and KM-theoreticians have said quite literally nothing about how schools and universities can improve internal communications (Yueh, 2018). 
In this work, we will map what KM and IE have already said and done onto universities and instruction-markets. But there is an important preliminary point. There are two very different kinds of Knowledge Management: Reactive and Proactive (Hunter, 2016). Reactive KM involves improving communications within an organization that is already mature and whose structure is therefore largely fixed. Proactive KM involves creating organizations whose structures guarantee good internal communications. A consequence of this distinction is that there are two ways of measuring the efficacy of KM: first, by considering reactive cases of KM, i.e. by considering the consequences on the part of an already existing and mature organization to implement principles of KM; second, by considering cases of proactive KM, i.e. by studying the difference between companies that applied KM to themselves only after they were mature and companies that were so designed as to avoid having KM problems in the first place. Some examples will help clarify these points. 
The Lehman Brothers investment bank was founded in 1844 and by the early 2000s had become so large that nobody within it, including management, had more than a fragmentary knowledge of its various operations. Management became concerned about its lack of knowledge of Lehman’s operations, fearing that it might be overexposed, and hired knowledge managers to help make its operations more internally transparent (Ball, 2018). This proved impossible, since Lehman’s various different departments enjoyed the autonomy that Lehman’s poor internal communications allowed them to have and actively fought attempts to expose their workings. As a result, Lehman invested more than it could afford to lose and collapsed when, in 2008, those investments proved to be bad ones. Lehman tried to use reactive KM to solve its problems, but by then its problems were intractable. 
Compare Lehman with E-trade. Founded in 1982, e-trade offers many of the same services offered by Lehman. But it was so designed to be lightweight, with transactions being automated whenever possible and all digitally logged in a centralized database. Because it is well-organized and has minimal overhead, E-trade is easy to use and charges its clients a fraction of what its brick-and-mortar counterparts charge. By practicing proactive KM, E-trade avoided Lehman-type communications blockages, and its market share has grown steadily since its inception (Moschella, 2017). 
In general, reactive KM yields only modest results, while proactive KM often yields spectacular results (Buffet, 2015). E-trade, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Airbnb, and Uber are companies whose success derives from proactive KM, and these are the very companies that we will discuss when investigating how KM can benefit education. 
KM-based cases of optimization are organization-internal, whereas IE-based cases of optimization involve whole markets and are therefore company-external. But IE-based optimization often results from KM-based optimization, and we will discuss several cases of this. For example, Amazon, E-trade, and Airbnb are both models of good KM and, partly for that reason, also led to efficient exchanges of information within markets, thereby optimizing those markets. But it must be kept in mind that no case of KM-based optimization is ever actually identical with a case of IE-based optimization, even though both may involve a single organization. Having good internal communications is a cause of, but is not identical with, Amazon’s making it easier for people to exchange information and products within many different markets (Keiding, 2017). 

Problem Statement 
The problem here is how to use accepted principles of KM and IE to optimize education. Information economists have proposed ways to optimize finance and healthcare, and in some cases those proposals have been implemented with good results, but they have maintained a veritable wall of silence as to how their discipline can be used to optimize education (Stankov, 2019). 
This is deeply perplexing. The very purpose of economics is to study how variations in inputs affect outputs. When more is spent and less is produced, economists are quick to sound the alarm. In education, costs have steadily grown over the last fifty years and yet outputs have declined (Busch, 2017). And yet economists have said nothing. The situation is doubly perplexing, given how much the internet could have optimized education and given how little it has done so (Pratt & DeDionisio, 2019). Similar points hold of KM. 
At the same time, these disciplines have created the intellectual instruments necessary to solve this problem. IE has made it clear how to optimize information-markets, and KM has made it clear how to optimize organization-internal communications. Universities are organizations, and instructions-markets are knowledge-markets. The purpose of this study is to map what IE has said about knowledge-markets in general onto instruction-markets specifically and to map what KM has said about organizations in general onto universities (Bootle, 2019). 

Purpose of the Study 
The purpose of this work is to show that IE and KM can be just as successful at optimizing instruction-markets and institutions of learning as they have been at optimizing knowledge-markets in general and organizations in general. 
We will discuss several cases of KM being used to optimize businesses and several cases of IE being used to optimize markets. It will be shown that each case involved the elimination of a suboptimality similar to one that vitiates American higher education, and it will then be shown how to implement the corresponding optimizations thereto. 
When discussing KM-based cases of optimization, we will focus on four companies: Amazon, E-trade, Uber, and Airbnb. Each of these KM-success stories corresponds to an IE-success story. This is because good internal communications allowed each of these companies to improve communications with its respective market and, on that basis, to improve those markets. We will describe the structure of each of these companies, making it clear how that structure conduces to good internal communications. We will then discuss how these companies were able to dominate and optimize their respective markets. In each case, it will be made clear how these companies optimized communications within their respective markets and how their doing so was responsible for their both dominating and optimizing those markets. 
We will find that, as each of these companies came to dominate its respective market, the structure of that market and that company’s internal structure increasingly mirrored each other. Before these companies came into existence, those markets were opaque and inefficient. After they came into existence, they began to become transparent and efficient, like those companies themselves. 
We will find that these companies have several structural similarities, in particular: 
*Small staff in relation to their business-volumes, 
*Heavy reliance on contract labor, 
*High degree of automation, 
*High employee turnover, 
*High degree of willingness to employ and to fire, 
*Well-defined performance-benchmarks, 
*Minimal middle-management, 
*An emphasis reducing consumer-costs, rather than on justifying high consumer-costs, 
*An emphasis on minimizing the amount of time between purchase and receipt of products/services, 
*Minimal reliance on public funding, 
*Non-adversarial relationship to independent and small operators, 
*An emphasis on helping suppliers and consumers find one another, and 
*Each enables people to do for themselves what they previously had to pay others to do (Boyd, 2019). 
Each of these companies benefits from market-transparency and deregulation. Their predecessors benefited form market-opacity and protectionism. E-trade by makes money by allowing people to act as their own brokers. Its predecessors made money by forcing people to go through their brokers. Uber makes money by allowing anyone to give a ride to anyone. Its predecessors made money by contracting with local governments to restrict would-be competitors from operating. Airbnb makes money by allowing any given person to rent out his home for a night. Its predecessors made money by offering lodging to people who simply didn't know that they had alternatives. Amazon makes money by giving consumers and suppliers access to each other. Amazon is the first company of its kind, and the markets that it now services were opaque and inefficient prior to its existence. Each of these companies makes money because the internet makes information available, and their predecessors made money because the absence of the internet made it unavailable (Rutherford, 2017). 
When examined, universities prove to be the very antithesis of the just-described companies, being characterized by high: 
*High degree of organizational opacity, 
*Minimal turnover, 
*Low degree of willingness to employ or to fire 
*Complete non-enforcement of economically meaningful performance-benchmarks, 
*Focus on justifying ever-increasing customer-expenses, instead of reducing them, 
*Minimal automation, 
*Heavy reliance on incumbent status, 
*Heavy reliance public funding, 
*High degree of exposure to costly labor regulations, 
*Adversarial relationship to independent operators, and 
*Fierce opposition to allowing customers to self-service (McDonald, 2010). 
Despite these facts, universities are not struggling financially. On the contrary, they are flourishing. This is because universities, though often nominally private, are parastatal organizations that do not compete on the open market (Cubberly, 2017). This point will be elaborated in Chapter 3. 
It might be surmised that there are formidable legal and regulatory barriers to creating universities, or university-substitutes, that embody the transparency and efficiency of an Amazon or an E-trade. This is not the case. The government is remarkably willing to grant the requisite licenses and is remarkably slow to regulate licensees out of existence (Mazzucatto, 2017). We appear to be dealing with a true market vacuum: a case where would-be suppliers have been slow to notice demand, and the already-mentioned success-stories strongly suggest ways to service this demand. This will be discussed in detail in Chapter 4. 

Research Questions 
An ‘instruction-provider’, as we will be using this term, is an organization whose purpose is to sell instruction. Thus, a university is an instruction-provider, as is an online tutoring agency. 
Our primary research question is: 
RQ1: What kind of an internal structure must an instruction-provider if it is to benefit from a transparent instruction-market? 
We will find that companies cannot benefit from transparent markets without themselves helping to make them transparent. For this reason, the answer to RQ1 is identical with the answer to: 
RQ2: What kind of an internal structure must an instruction-provider if it is to help make instruction-markets more transparent? 
Other questions that we will address are: 
RQ3: In what ways are existing instruction-providers succeeding and in what ways are they failing? 
RQ4: To what extent can be they be so restructured as to stop failing in those ways, and to what extent does their continued financial well-being depend on their being so restructured? 
RQ5: Are there markets that existing instruction-providers are systemically incapable of servicing, and if so, how could they be serviced? 
RQ1-RQ5 are all practical questions, but the answers to them will help us answer some important theoretical questions, the main one being 
RQ6: Granting that information is necessarily unevenly distributed in instruction-markets, how can the resulting inefficiencies be minimized? 
RQ6 is a specialized form of an open question of Information Economics, namely: 
RQ7: How can information-markets be efficient? 
In an information-market, information is ipso facto unevenly distributed. In an efficient market, information is ipso facto evenly distributed. Hence the raison d’être for RQ7. 

Advancing Scientific Knowledge and Significance of Study 
The primary significance of this study is that it will show how to make education better by making it profitable. A secondary significance is that it will show how to make knowledge-markets efficient. The first significance is practical; the second is theoretical. 
The idea that education is corrupted by being monetized is deeply entrenched in the popular psyche, despite there being no empirical evidence to that effect (Busch, 2017). Also, educational institutions, unlike businesses, are often treated as cultural icons. If a business fails to perform, no one for a second believes that it should be allowed to hold onto its market share. There were cries of outrage when the big three automakers were bailed, even though they employ hundreds of thousands of Americans and are veritable cornerstones of Americana (Tilleman, 2016). But universities receive more and more public money as they charge their students more and more for educations that benefit them less and less; and yet it is seldom so much as hinted that universities should explain where that money goes. The underlying conceit seems to be that research and instruction are sacred and must therefore be insulated from market forces, lest they be ‘bought’ (Samuelson, 2011). 
This conceit is false and injurious. It is not selling out to provide non-defective products and services for an agreed upon price. It is selling out to take money for defective products and services. The open market doesn’t allow people to take money for defective or undesired products and services. If I try to sell paintings that nobody wants or I try to sell cars that don’t work, I will go out of business. But if my money comes from someone other than the people who need my services, I can provide defective or useless services and continue to be funded (Sowell, 2016). 
In any case, it is a fact that monetized information-exchanges are more efficient non-monetized information-exchanges (Hazlitt, 1985). People who are financially motivated to avail others of information, they do more quickly and inexpensively than those who are not and also provide more accurate information. This insight has been used to optimize many different kinds of markets, including information-markets, and the present work will show how it can be used to optimize instruction-markets. 

Rationale for Methodology 
The basic contention of this work is that information-markets, including instruction-markets, are transparent when to the extent that they are monetized and opaque to the extent that they are not, a corollary being that education is optimized by being monetized. 
This proposition can be established on strictly econometric grounds. Information, as well as information-quality, can be quantified. Therefore, it is possible to identify and measure the factors that conduce to information-flow. Entrepreneurs do this implicitly, and recently mathematicians and economists have done this explicitly (Roe, 2019). Further, monetary inputs and outputs can obviously be quantified and can therefore correlated with other quantifiable inputs and outputs, such as labor, time, and information (Hayashi, 2011). 
Inevitably, there will be theoretical puzzles relating to the quantification of information, but they will not affect the contexts that we will be considering. 
Consequently, our methodology is quantitative; more specifically, econometrics-based, econometrics being the branch of economics that quantitative dependencies of economics outputs on economic inputs (Hayashi, 2011). 
The mathematics involved in econometrics can be very simple or very complex, depending on the context, and fortunately are simple in the contexts that concern us. 
Nature of the Research Design 

for the Study 
We will start by comparing our target-companies---Amazon, E-trade, Uber, and Airbnb---with unsuccessful companies in similar markets. We will assign an information-efficiency quotient (IEQ) to each company, a given company’s IEQ being high if it is likely to capitalize on information and low if it is unlikely to do so. On this basis, we will then identify the structural characteristics of companies, including instruction-providers, with high IEQ’s. 
We will then compare information-efficient markets with information-inefficient markets. The efficient-markets will be those that were made efficient by our target companies, and the inefficient ones will be those same markets prior to their being thus optimized. We will then assign IEQ’s to those various markets, on that basis identifying the structural properties of high-IEQ markets, including information-markets. 

Research Questions 
What organizational structure must an instruction-provider have if it is to provide the best possible instruction at the lowest possible price? 
What organizational structure must an instruction-provider have it is to be sensitive to changes in the kinds of instruction that are demanded and is also to be able to service those changes? 
Is it possible for a profitable instruction-provider to sell results as opposed to services? If so how? 
When does research have to be insulated from market-forces in order to be good, and when does it have to be exposed to market-forces to be good? 
Does tenure lead to transparency or to opacity in instruction-markets? 
Why are universities increasingly expensive, despite being an 
increasingly bad investment? 
Under what circumstances does the information-asymmetries inherent in information-markets, including instruction-markets, drive down the price of information? 
Are there certain kinds of information-providers that benefit from data-protectionism and market-opacity? Does a company that sells information about bond markets benefit from a lack of public access to data about such markets? 
What kind of organizational structure must a company have if it is to benefit from selling instruction that enables people to self-instruct? 
Can governments help make instruction-markets more transparent, or does government-intervention tend to make such markets less transparent? 
Are information-providers necessarily put out of business if they do their job too well? 
Is there a definition of the term ‘rational actor’ that accommodates the fact that what a person wants changes as he acquires more knowledge and more intelligence? 
We will put forth and defend answers to each of these questions. Here are some anticipations of what we will find. 
Properly structured instruction-providers benefit from transparency in their respective markets and are harmed by its absence. At the same time, a belief to the contrary is embodied in the very structures of most existing instruction-providers, a consequence being that instruction is more expensive, less available, and of lower quality than it need be (Friedman, 1993). 
Instruction-providers benefit from market-transparency to the extent that they provide good instruction and are harmed by it to the extent that they don’t. 
Information-providers that are not instruction-providers fall into two very different categories: information-hoarders (companies that make money by blocking the flow of information and then charging people for it) and information-seekers (companies that make money by finding information that would be hard to obtain even in transparent markets), with information-seekers benefiting from market-transparency and information-hoarders being harmed it (Seward, 2016). 
The concept of a ‘rational actor’ is a coherent one, and has operational economic significance, despite the fact that desires vary with changes in knowledge and intelligence. The reason is that economically rational actor necessarily desires the information needed to acquire more resources, and this desire only grows as he acquires more such knowledge (Gawronski, 2016). 

Definitions of Terms 
Parity: A situation in which economic competitors are equally competent (Hazhimzade, 2017). 
Information-parity: A situation in which economic competitors are equally informed (Clapham, 2014). 
Market-transparency: Equal availability of market-relevant information to all market-participants (Hazhimzade, 2017). 
Market-opacity: Absence of market-transparency (Clapham, 2014). 
Structural market-opacity: Market-opacity due to deliberate attempts on the part of governments or market-actors to obstruct the flow of information (Blackburn, 2016). 
Non-structural market-opacity: Market-opacity due to differences in luck, intelligence, and effort on the part of market participants, and not to deliberate attempts on anyone's part to obstruct access to information (Hazhimzade, 2017). 
Information-provider: Organization whose business is to sell information (Blackburn, 2016). 
Information-hoarder: Information-provider whose business involves 
its restricting access to information that would otherwise be available and then charging for access to said information (Ferguson, 2016). 
Information-seeker: Information-provider whose business is to obtain information that is unavailable only because of limitations on time, effort, and ability on the part of those want it (Rutherford, 2019). 
Data-protectionism: Policy adopted either by governments or private entities of sequestering otherwise publicly available information for the purpose of inflating its market-value and of protecting market-positions, not for the purpose of guaranteeing organizational or public security. Data-protectionist policies are often represented as serving the interests of national or organizational security, the distinction between security-driven and protectionist-driven data-sequestration tends to be clear. Data-protectionism undermines commerce; security-driven data-sequestration does not (Upton, 2014). 
Instruction-provider: Organization whose business is to sell instruction (Upton, 2014). 
Parastatal organization: An organization that is nominally private but functions as a governmental organization. The main difference between parastatal and genuinely private organizations is not that the former are more powerful than the latter; sometimes parastatal organizations have very little power, and sometimes genuinely private organizations are very powerful. Rather, the difference is that parastatal organizations are insulated from market-forces and persist despite a failure to provide goods or services for which there is any obvious demand (Reddy, 2005). 
Equilibrium: A market in which prices equal values is said to be in equilibrium. Disequilibrium leads to inefficiency, since it involves somebody’s either paying too much or not being paid enough. When prices are above equilibrium, consumers pay too much; and when prices are below equilibrium, suppliers are not paid enough (Ferguson, 2017). 
Rigid labor market: A labor market in which slow job turnover inflates labor-costs and diminishes labor-quality (Reddy, 2005). 
Efficient Market Theory (EMT): The principle that market-relevant information tends to be equitably distributed, leading to equilibrium, in the absence of government policies preventing the flow of information (Hazhimzade, 2017). 

Assumptions, Limitations, Delimitations 
People often have beliefs for which they do not have good evidence. Such a belief is a hypothesis when it is one’s objective to prove it true, and an assumption when one has no such objective (Kuczynski, 2009). This work will be rich in hypotheses but relatively free of assumptions. We will make relatively few assumptions as the truthfulness of descriptions of markets or of organizations, since our starting-point will be that opaque markets and organizations inherently lack credibility. As for transparent markets and organizations, statements about them are readily verified or falsified and therefore need not be assumed true or false. 
The discipline of economics is proverbially rich in assumptions, and those assumptions often prove to be false or irrelevant to real-world conditions, with the result that the theories based on them prove to be false or useless. An extreme but otherwise quite standard example of this is EMT. The crash of 2008 was a consequence of market-opacities resulting from data-hoarding on the part of private institutions, coupled with credulity on the part of the public (Soros, 2009). 
In this work, economic principles will be used, but no economic models or theories will be assumed true. A guiding principle of the present work is that unregulated commerce tends to be more efficient than regulated commerce. But this is never simply assumed in the present work; in some cases, it is argued for, and in others, it is argued to be false. 
The main assumption that the present work makes is that what is true of non-information markets, and also of information-markets that are not instruction-markets, will also hold of instruction-markets. That said, there are cases of instructions being made more efficient by being monetized, and no cases of them being made inefficient by being monetized. So this ‘assumption’ of ours is not a pure assumption (Clarey, 2011). 
The most questionable assumption that we will make is that instruction-markets are not in any way ‘special’---that emotional and cultural resistances to monetizing instruction, though possible, are not inevitable. This assumption is questionable given the iconic status that the ‘Academy’ has in present-day culture, along with the obvious affection people have for their ‘alma maters’, despite exorbitant tuitions and minimal returns-on-investment (Clarey, 2009). 

Summary and Organization of the Remainder of the Study 
In Chapter 2, the histories and structures of our target-companies--­Amazon, E-trade, Uber, and Airbnb---will be given. It will be said how their structures differ from those of their predecessors and few remaining competitors. It will be shown our target-companies are more aware of and able to capitalize on market-data than their predecessor-competitors, and it will also be explained why. It will also be explained how our target-companies affected markets. This will involve explaining what these markets were like before and after the inception of these companies, especially how information-flow within changed after their inception. In some cases, notably Amazon, these companies created new markets, the nature and effects of which we will discuss. 
In Chapter 3, the structures of existing instruction-providers will be compared with those of our target-companies, and the structures of existing instruction-markets will be compared with the markets optimized or created by those companies. Tentative conclusions as to how to optimize existing instruction-markets will be drawn. Finally, actual examples of efficient instruction-providers, along with the corresponding markets, will be discussed and shown to bear out these conclusions. 
In Chapter 4, we will delineate some of the theoretical implications of the previous chapters. We will develop the distinction between reactive and proactive KM. We will also discuss the distinction between normative and descriptive IE, descriptive IE between the study of how information flows within existing markets and normative IE being the study of how it should flow. In relation to this, it will be discussed what both private actors and governments can do to improve transparency within information-markets. We will also discuss the threat of parastatal organizations to market-transparency, especially in relation to information-and instruction-markets, and will discuss how those can be managed. We will find reason to believe that, in the United States at the present time, the government is not much of a threat to transparency within such markets and that, so far as they are opaque, it is only because private organizations have not made it a priority to make them transparent.

Goldman, Rousseau and von Hayek on the Ideal State (Politics) 
What kind of state would exist in a free and just society, and why? Goldman and Rousseau give similar answers to this question; Hayek gives a very different answer. 
Goldman’s answer is---none. A free and just society is one in which there is no government and therefore no state. Goldman’s position is that government is inherently unjust--a bully that exploits and coerces and does no good: “Just as religion has fettered the human mind, and as property, or the monopoly of things, has subdued and stifled man’s needs, so has the State enslaved his spirit, dictating every phase of conduct.” (Anarchism: What it Really Stands For, p. 4) 
Of course, the question arises: If there is no government (no state), then what will keep order? Goldman’s answer is that the very crime that it is supposedly the state’s purpose to prevent is itself a product of the state: “The most absurd apology for authority and law is that they serve to diminish crime...So long as every institution of today, economic, political, social, and moral, conspires to misdirect human energy into wrong channels; so long as most people are out of place doing the things they hate to do, living a life they loathe to live, crime will be inevitable, and all the laws on the statutes can only increase, but never do away with, crime.” (Anarchism: What it Really Stands For, p. 4) 
The idea here seems to be that human beings are inherently cooperative and, left to their own devices, engage in constructive rather than mutually antagonistic activity. 
Rousseau’s views are similar to Goldman’s. According to Rousseau, people are not naturally antagonistic towards one another: “So long as men remained content with their rustic huts.....they lived free, healthy, honest and happy lives, so long as their nature allowed, and as they continued to enjoy the pleasures of mutual and independent intercourse.” (Discourse on Inequality, p. 9) 
People became antagonistic, according to Rousseau, with the advent of civilization. Civilization made it possible for people to have more than they needed. When this happened, people became wealth-and status-driven and, in order to maximize their wealth and status, took to mutual exploitation: “[F]rom the moment it appeared advantageous to any one man to have enough provisions for two, equality disappeared, property was introduced, work became indispensable, and vast forests became smiling fields, which man had to water with the sweat of his brow, and where slavery and misery were soon seen to germinate and grow up with the crops.” (Discourse on Inequality, p. 8) In other words, human beings are best off living in tribes, tribalism being intermediate between anarchy and civilization. 
There is a serious problem with Rousseau’s position. While there may be some advantages to a tribal (or pre-civilizational) mode of existence, there are some serious disadvantages: lack of choices in regards to profession and lifestyle, lack of medical care, lack of education, confinement to a small geographical area, lack of technology, and the need to work for every single meal that one consumes. Also, it is unlikely that tribal life is as placid and carefree as Rousseau suggests. Tribes attacked one another and were certainly capable of behaving cruelly towards their own members. And if tribal life is so idyllic, why don’t people opt for it today? 
Goldman’s thinking is similarly flawed. Goldman may be right that the state is responsible for some of the crime that it claims to exist to prevent, and she is surely right that states often behave very unjustly. But without the state, contracts wouldn’t be enforced and there would be no economies of scale; and the state is therefore necessary for all of the improvements to life resulting from economies of scale. 
Rightly taking it for granted that the state is necessary for crime-prevention and contract enforcement, Hayek advocates what he refers to as ‘liberalism’, this being the view that the state should protect people but should otherwise not interfere with their lives: “Liberalism is opposed, however, to supplanting competition by inferior methods of guiding economic activity. And it regards competition as superior not only because in most circumstances it is the most efficient method known but because it is the only method which does not require the coercive or arbitrary intervention of authority. It dispenses with the need for ‘conscious social control’ and gives individuals a chance to decide whether the prospects of a particular occupation are sufficient to compensate for the disadvantages connected with it.” (Road to Serfdom, pp. 45-46) 
Is Hayek right that good government is minimal government? There is certainly considerable evidence for that claim: over-regulated economies (e.g. the Soviet Union) tend to fail and minimally regulated ones (e.g. the US in its early days) tend to flourish. More importantly, people should within reason be allowed to live the way they want to live, and overly invasive governments make that impossible. This does not mean that Hayek is unqualifiedly correct, which he probably isn’t, but it suggests that his position is likely to be a respectable first approximation to the truth. 
By contrast, the views of Goldman and Rousseau are not realistic, since, as previously explained, anarchy and tribalism fail to avail people of the freedoms and amenities that they want. 

Take-home Exam on Russian History (Politics/History/Current Events) 
Discuss the sources of the revolution initiated by the Bolsheviks in 1917. Address all relevant political, social, and economic causes. Was the revolution avoidable? Did the tsar's reforms after the 1905 Revolution have any chance at preventing the revolution? Explain. 
The Bolshevik Revolution per se had little popular support. But the Tsar’s government was weak, and towards the end of World War 1, and largely because of it, more or less just collapsed, at which point the Bolshevik’s simply ‘picked up’ power. The relevant question isn’t so much “what caused the Russian Revolution?” as it is “what caused the Tsarist system of government to lose power and credibility?” And the answer to the latter is as follows. Russia was largely poor; it was divided between a small group of very wealthy people and a vastly larger group of very poor people. Also, there was a growing urban intellectual class that (with some legitimacy) saw Tsarism as antiquated and unprogressive. The Tsarist system was proverbially bureaucratic and autocratic (though not, ironically, anywhere nearly as much as the Soviet system that would replace it). Tsar Nicolas’s reforms had a ‘too little, too late’ quality. WWI decapitalized Russia and made it defenseless against the numerically small but determined Bolshevik Party, which, as previously stated, was not at that point met by strong resistance to its (successful) 1917/1918 power-grab. 
Describe and discuss Stalin's Five-Year Plans. What was the goal of these plans? Did Stalin achieve his goals? Were there any negative consequences? Explain and provide examples. 
Stalin, though in some ways a ‘strong leader’, was really just an inept bungler whose methods of statecraft were crude. And his infamous ‘Five Year Plans” were prime examples of this. The Five-Year Plans were attempts to modernize and industrialize Russia, by building damns, factories, and the like, and in this way supposedly modernizing Russia’s economy. It should be pointed out that much of the labor for the Five Year Plans was slave labor, supplied by Stalin’s burgeoning Gulag population, which, though initially created by Stalin’s attempting to hold onto power by incarcerating actual, possible and conceivable political opposition, soon became (to some extent) about providing the labor-force for Stalin’s expensive Industrialization efforts. In any case, the Five Year Plans were successful in some respects; they did turn the Soviet Union into an industrial and military power. But they were grand failures in other respects, in that, even though they made the Soviet Union militarily powerful, they made the Soviet people poor and they also decapitalized the country, which led its collapse 50 years later. 
Describe the distribution of power under the Soviet model. What institutions were most powerful? How did this differ from the way power is supposed to be distributed? Make sure that you provide examples and address the concept of democratic centralism. 
The Communist Party of the Soviet Union would elect a Central Committee, this being a kind of ‘board of directors’ of the Soviet Union. The Central Committee would elect a Politburo, this being comparable, within limits, to the President’s ‘Cabinet.’ The politburo would elect a General Secretary, who was the Supreme Leader of the entire Soviet Union. The outcomes of these ‘elections’ were, at least during the Stalin years and to a lesser extent later, pre-determined by existing political alliances. But that is the way in which those alliances were given official force. The Central Committee and Politburo, under the direction of the General Secretary, would issue edicts/recommendations to local Party Central Committees, which, in their turn, would run their respective geographical territories. 
What is civil society? Do you agree that civil society is necessary for the formation of democracy? Explain. How did the Soviet Union deal with civil society? Has Russia under Putin's leadership been any different? Do you think Russia can become democratic based on its experiences with civil society? 
Civil Society is the totality of institutions and practices and values in a given country that are not either political or strictly commercial in in nature. Thus, family, religion (except for state-imposed religion), private morality, and personal conduct (e.g. one’s conduct outside of political contexts or commercial exchanges) are aspects of civil society. Civil society is not technically necessary for democracy. In a society of economic actors---none of whom had any existence apart from their business interests—there would still be a need for, and a possibility of, democracy. In fact, democratic institutions are especially important when it comes to the protection of economic interests, mainly of one’s right to engage in trade. Under the Soviet Union, civil society was fiercely repressed. Under Putin, civil society is not particularly repressed, contrary to what it is chic to say. Russians under Putin can recreate as they wish and they are free to engage in commerce (even though they often have to deal with organized crime). 
How has Putin managed to consolidate power in Russia? Has he obtained the support of the population and the Duma? If so, how? Evaluate whether there is any chance at democracy developing under Putin. 
Putin began in the KGB. After the Soviet Union fell, he became a protégé of Boris Yeltsin and was appointed Prime minister by Yeltsin in 1999. Putin later pardoned Yeltsin, thereby indebting the latter to him. Putin showed strength and decisiveness throughout his career. He began by imprisoning Oil Oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, which sent a message to the other Oligarchs—who threatened to dilute Putin’s power by having a share of it—to cease to vie for political power. Putin also handled a number of crises, including the Chechen War and also the seizure of a Moscow movie theatre by Chechen rebels—in a decisive manner, thus earning the respect, or at least the fear, of the Russian populace. Putin is in fact popular with the Russian people (even after allowances are made for likely fabrications on the part of a Putin-controlled media) because he is seen as having stabilized the country. And for similar reasons (and with similar qualifications), Putin is popular with the Duma, having recently won a ‘super-majority’ of support therein. 
What are the primary problems with the Russian economy? Provide explanations that engage economic and political factors. Based on this information, what changes need to occur for the Russian economy to improve and stabilize? Are these changes likely? Why or why not? 
Russia has three major economic problems. First, it relies too much on energy-exports. Technology is making many economic sectors less energy-dependent, and Russia’s reliance on a global energy-demand therefore does not bode well for it. 
Also, Russia suffers from political corruption, which negatively affects entrepreneurs and also discourages foreign investment in Russia. 
Finally, Russia, partly for the two reasons just mentioned, is suffering from a ‘brain-drain’: many talented members of intelligence-heavy professions are leaving Russia for greener pastures. 
In order to hedge against these problems, Russia would need to diversify its economy, which will be difficult to do unless political corruption is reigned in. It should be pointed out that there have been relatively non-corrupt autocracies and there have been, and are, highly corrupt democracies. So it isn’t necessarily the case that the demise of Putin-style autocracy is a sine qua non for the improvement of Russia’s economy. (Putinites would argue that the opposite is the case.) In any case, it doesn’t seem particularly likely that the needed changes will happen, mainly because no one—not Putin, not his opponents—seems to have any clear ideas as to how to make it happen. Nor are there are any obvious ideas as to how to do this. Nor, indeed, does there seem to be the requisite political will. My personal feeling is that there were incentive-programs for small businesses in Russia—programs that incentivized the Russian equivalent of Facebook (which, incidentally, does exist)---this might lead to the needed sort of economic diversification. But any views on these matters are necessarily speculative at this point.

or

(History/Politics) 
The 
US 
Constitution 
is 
at 
its 
core 
a 
democratic 
document, 
and 
since 
the 
US 
Constitution 
is 
the 
embodiment 
of 
the 
political 
views 
of 
its 
framers, 
these 
being 
the 
Founding 
Fathers, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
Founding 
Fathers 
supported 
democracy. 
In 
this 
paper, 
it 
will 
be 
shown, 
largely 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
direct 
quotes 
from 
the 
original 
(1789) 
US 
Constitution, 
that 
the 
latter 
is 
a 
largely 
if 
not 
a 
completely 
democratic 
document. 
Then 
we 
will 
show 
that 
some 
apparently 
undemocratic 
provisions 
of 
the 
Constitution 
are 
in 
fact 
democratic. 
Finally, 
we 
will 
discuss 
the 
fact 
that 
during 
the 
early 
years 
of 
the 
republic, 
only 
propertied 
white 
males 
could 
vote, 
and 
we 
will 
show 
that 
this 
obviously 
undemocratic 
practice 
does 
not 
prove 
the 
Constitution 
or 
the 
Founding 
Fathers 
to 
be 
undemocratic. 
A 
democracy 
is 
a 
society 
in 
which 
the 
people 
elect 
their 
officials. 
In 
the 
system 
of 
government 
described 
in 
the 
1789-Constitution, 
key 
government 
officials 
are 
elected 
and 
those 
that 
are 
not 
elected 
are 
appointed 
by 
those 
who 
are. 
First 
of 
all, 
provisions 
are 
made 
for 
the 
election 
of 
representatives, 
Senators 
and 
a 
chief 
executive 
(or 
President). 
In 
Article 
I, 
Section 
2 
of 
the 
1789-Constitution 
says: 
“The 
House 
of 
Representatives 
shall 
be 
composed 
of 
Members 
chosen 
every 
second 
Year 
by 
the 
People 
of 
the 
several 
States, 
and 
the 
Electors 
in 
each 
State 
shall 
have 
the 
Qualifications 
requisite 
for 
Electors 
of 
the 
most 
numerous 
Branch 
of 
the 
State 
Legislature….” 
This 
quote 
makes 
it 
that 
“the 
People”, 
this 
being 
some 
subset 
of 
the 
general 
population, 
choose 
who 
their 
governmental 
representatives 
will 
be, 
at 
least 
within 
limits. 
Later 
in 
Article 
I, 
Section 
2 
it 
is 
written 
that: 
“Representatives 
and 
direct 
Taxes 
shall 
be 
apportioned 
among 
the 
several 
States 
which 
may 
be 
included 
within 
this 
Union, 
according 
to 
their 
respective 
Numbers, 
which 
shall 
be 
determined 
by 
adding 
to 
the 
whole 
Number 
of 
free 
Persons, 
including 
those 
bound 
to 
Service 
for 
a 
Term 
of 
Years… 
When 
vacancies 
happen 
in 
the 
Representation 
from 
any 
State, 
the 
Executive 
Authority 
thereof 
shall 
issue 
Writs 
of 
Election 
to 
fill 
such 
Vacancies.” 
The first sentence of this quotations indicates that the degree of representation given to a state is a function of the number of people in that state, and the second sentence indicates that it is the citizens of that state who decide who will represent them. 
The last sentence of Article I, Section 2 states that: “The House of Representatives…shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.” In other words, these representatives have the power to remove the President from Office (or at least to initiate proceedings to the effect), this being a way of keeping the President under the control of elected officials. 
The 1789-Constitution intends for the House of Representatives to be unqualifiedly democratic, since it provides both that the people in a given state elect their representatives and also that the number of representatives per state is proportional to that state’s population. 
In Section III of the 1789-Constitution, it is written that: “The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen 
by 
the 
Legislature 
thereof, for six Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote.” Thus, the 1789-Constitution intends for the Senate to be a qualifiedly democratic institution, since although it provides that the people of a given state shall elect their own Senators, it does not provide that the number of Senators per state is proportional to that state’s population. 
In Article II, Section 1, it is written that: “The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows.” Each state has a number of ‘electors.’ The number of electors per state is proportional to the population of that state. The electors for a given state unanimously vote for the Presidential candidate voted for by a majority of the people in that state. So it is these electors who directly vote for President; the people only indirectly do so. But these electors always vote in line with the votes cast by the majority of their constituents. 
Basically, a state’s citizens do not directly vote for President. Rather, their state directly votes for the President, and they vote for who their state will vote for. 
This system makes it possible for a Presidential candidate who loses the popular vote to win the election, and some might regard this system as undemocratic or only imperfectly democratic. But that is not the only possible view of the matter. The electoral system gives the vote to states, and it therefore preserves all of the democratic functions carried out by states. 
There is an important respect in which the United States in 1789 was not democratic. Only white, male land-owners could vote. Women could not. Native Americans could not. African-Americans could not. And, significantly, unpropertied while males could not. (Be it noted that the 1789­Constitution does not itself restrict the vote to propertied while males. The Constitutions was silent on the matter, it being the culture at large that limited suffrage in this way.) 
Why was this? Although an element of racism, sexism and snobbism may have played a role, this system was primarily about restricting suffrage to people who had an economic stake in the welfare of the country. Obviously, slaves did not want the country to be an economic success, since it was denying them their freedom, and if given the right to vote, they might well have voted for its destruction. As for Native Americans, even though the United States did not enslave them and even though they had commercial ties to it, their welfare did not depend on its welfare, and for this reason they could not be counted to vote for its welfare. As for women in this time period, they were not engaged in commerce and, however positive their intentions towards the United States, might have been, they could not be counted upon to vote in an informed manner. The same is true of white males who had no property: however positive their intentions might have been, they could not be counted upon to vote in an informed manner. 
Finally, the 1789-Constitution did not prevent anyone from voting, and it has proved easy to amend so as to grant suffrage to people who did not previously have it. This was by design. The Founding Fathers designed a system that had a fundamentally democratic structure. That system has not always been implemented in a maximally democratic way, but that is only because it has not always been implemented as it was meant to be. 
In conclusion, the 1789 US-Constitution describes a highly democratic system of government. Although it contains some apparently undemocratic provisions, these provisions prove upon analysis not to be undemocratic or to be only qualifiedly so. As for the fact that only white propertied males could vote during the early years of this country’s existence, that had no basis in the Constitution, which did not prevent anyone from voting, and was instead a consequence of the way in which the Constitution was implemented. 
The Two Faces of China’s Negative Soft Power: China’s Belt and Road Initiative as a Case of Negative Soft Power (Politics) 
There are two kinds of power that a nation can have: hard power and soft power. Hard power is the ability to coerce using military or economic means. Soft power is about influencing, as opposed to coercing. A nation’s soft power lies in the appeal of its culture, the sentiments that others have about its practices, and its general countenance. 
Just as there are two kinds of power, so there are two kinds of soft power: positive and negative. Positive soft power is the power to influence other nations to engage in a constructive or affirmative endeavor, e.g. to build a dam. Negative soft power is the power to influence other nations to engage in a negative or privative endeavor, e.g. to refuse to transact with some nation or to withdraw support from 
There are two kinds of negative soft power: the deliberate kind and the inadvertent kind. In other words, negative soft power can sometimes, be used deliberately, but it can also just ‘happen’, without its being intended by the nation in question. An example of deliberate negative soft power would be the U.S.’s boycotting the Soviet Olympics in 1980: this was not a case of the US’s coercing anybody, militarily or otherwise. But it sent a message to other nations that the United States took a dim view of the Soviet Union, which message in turn reinforced those other nations’ existing misgiving about the Soviet Union. 
A case of inadvertent negative soft power would be the detestation for the US in the Islamic world that have resulted from the US’s attempts to grace the Islamic world with its pop culture, which attempts were seen in the Islamic world not as acts of kindness but as acts of cultural imperialism and of religious intolerance. 
In this study, I am going to show that China, through its Belts and Roads Initiate (BRI), is exercising a number of different forms of soft power: positive, deliberate negative, and inadvertent negative. On the one hand, as we will see, some see this initiative as a sincere attempt on China’s part to build economic (and literal) bridges between nations: so to this extent, it is a case of positive soft power. On the other hand, some see it as attempts on China’s part to infiltrate other nations: so to this extent it is inadvertent negative soft power. Finally, China has deliberately represented BRI as being a conscious attempt on China’s part to rally Asian and African nations against the US and other Western powers: so to this extent, it is deliberate negative soft power. 
Interest Groups and Political Parties (Politics/Current Events) 
Describe the evolution of political parties in the United States. 
The United States is technically a multi-party system, but in practice, it is and always has been a two-party system. When the United States was founded, there were no political parties, in the United States or anywhere else. The Founding Fathers did not see American as being party-based, and the Constitution does not even refer to political parties. But political parties quickly came into existence, quickly stabilizing into the two-party configuration that we still have today. The first two parties were the Federalist Party and the Democratic-Republican Party. The Federalist party concerned with the country’s macro-economic well-being, and the Democratic-Republican Party was concerned more with the individual’s welfare and quality of life. The Federalist party corresponded (with some qualifications) to today’s Republican Party, and the Democratic-Republican Party corresponded to today’s Democratic Party. (The qualifications relate to the fact that the Federalist Party was focused mainly on economic matters and, unlike today’s Republican Party, had little or no interest, or even negative interest, in ‘religious values’ and ‘family values’ and the like.) 
In fact, for the entirety of the USA’s existence, politics has been dominated by two parties, one corresponding to today’s Democratic Party, the other corresponding to today’s Republican Party. 
The actual Democratic Party came into existence in the 1830s and was founded by Andrew Jackson, as an attempt to transfer wealth away from plutocrats and into the hands of the masses, and the actual Republican Party was founded in 1854, largely as an attempt to end slavery but also as an attempt centralize power and unify the country under sustainable macro­economic policies. 
As the just-stated facts make clear, there have been pronounced shifts within and between the parties. Someone with Andrew Jackson’s values would now being seen as the antithesis of a democratic; in fact, Jackson’s positions were strongly in line with those of current President Donald Trump. (Trump, though wealthy and though in some ways a supporter of the wealthy, is also an arch-populist, just as Jackson was.) And Lincoln, though a Republican, probably had values at least in some ways more in line with those of contemporary democrats. (That said, Lincoln was in other respects quite representative of modern Republicanism, mainly in that, despite his progressive views on race-relations, he represented the interests of the Corporatistic North over the more agrarian and in some ways pre-capitalist South.) 
But even more striking than what has changed the American Party Politics over the last 250 years is what hasn’t changed. During any given election cycle, there is one party that focuses on macro-economic policy, and another that focuses on ‘the little guy’; there is one party that wants to centralize power and another that wants to decentralize it; there is one party that wants to cleave to the Constitution, and another that regards the Constitution as being contraindicated. In some contexts, in some respects, the Republican Party represents, or is seen as representing, the interests of small businesses; in other words, the Democratic Party has that role. At certain junctures, the Republican Party is relatively isolationist and relatively uninclined to go to war, and the Democratic party, being less isolationist, is relatively inclined to do so; and at the other junctures, the roles are reversed. 
Despite the differences between the two parties, there was a kind of equilibrium or stalemate between the Republicans and the Democrats. They agreed to disagree on certain issues and to agree on others, and their back­and-forth had a rather automated, kabuki-like quality to it. But with Donald Trump that changed (whether for better or worse is obviously a matter of debate). What is distinctive about Trump is that he came into politics from the outside. He is not a politician; he is a businessman who went into politics. And this is reflected in his views, which are in some ways more disruptive to Republican orthodoxies than to Democratic orthodoxies. (Trump actually conforms quite well to Democratic presumptions about the Republican Party, and for that same reason Trump does not conform well to Republican efforts to mollify the Democratic Party.) In any case, though, American party politics was quick to come into existence and assume a form barely distinguishable from its contemporary form. Be it noted that, in his book Propaganda, Edmund Bernays, the father of modern advertising, claimed that, for reasons of psychology, people need political parties and, at the same time, that they cannot have more than two. And it would seem that Bernays was right. 
France 
France has a semipresidential system. What exactly does this mean? Specifically, address the roles of the executive and legislative branches in this system. Would you recommend the semipresidential system for other countries? Explain why or why not 
Much like Russia, France has a semi-presidential system of government, meaning that there is a prime-minister as well as President, both of whom are answerable to the nation’s legislature. A semi-presidential system differs from a parliamentary republic in that in the case of a parliamentary republic the president is a mere figure head, whereas in the case of a semi-presidential republic has real power. And semi-presidential system differs from a presidential system in that, whereas in a presidential system the cabinet is appointed by the president and can also be dismissed by him, in a semi-presidential system the cabinet is appointed by the legislature and cannot be unilaterally dismissed by the president. In France, the President names the Prime Minister. 
France’s government, like the USA’s, is divided into executive, legislative, and judicial branches. And the judicial branch, like the USA’s, is divided into a National Assembly, corresponding to the US House of Representative, and a Senate, corresponding to the US senate. 
The legislative process in France, though basically similar to its American counterpart. In the United States, the Supreme court does not determine the constitutional of a prospective law; it merely determines the constitutionality of pre-existing laws, and then only under when their constitutionality is made salient by criminal or civil litigation. But in France, in order for a bill to become law, its constitutionality must be determined in advance (by the Constitutional Adviser) and so must its consistency with existing National and European laws (by the Conseil d’état). But the largest difference between the American and the French system is that, whereas the American system is presidential, the French system is semi-presidential, so that the French system has a ‘dual executive’ branch. 
The advantage of a semi-presidential over a presidential system is that it tends to prevent political gridlock, mainly by making it impossible for the President to exercise power without the support of both the Prime Minister and the legislature. So the legislature and the executive have trouble drifting far enough apart from each other for there to be insuperable disagreements between them. At the same time, this is also, at least in some contexts, a disadvantage, since it prevents the President taking the bold initiatives that may be necessary to deal with crises. 
My personal view is that, while there should be checks and balances and that Presidential authority must be restricted, the presidential has more than enough checks and balances on the President’s power. By the same token, the semi-presidential arraignment over-limits the President and (unless, as is the case in Russia, which is really an autocracy and only formally a semi-presidential system) and prevents him from taking bold and (in some contexts) necessary action. 
Russia 
How has geography influenced Russian political development over the centuries? 
The Russian Empire was physically extremely large. Also, much of it, being Arctic or Sub-arctic, is very cold. Further, even though it has the largest coastline of any country, that coastline is on the Arctic Ocean and is therefore of limited use for either commerce or for Russia’s self-management. Russia’s size, though in some respects a strength, left it exposed to invaders and made it difficult to protect, this being why, over the centuries, it sustained a series of nasty blows at the hands of numerous Central Asian and East Asian countries. 
Also, whereas the United States is replete with high-quality arable land, the land in Russia is relatively non-arable and the climate is inhospitable to many forms of agriculture. Russia’s geographical isolation, coupled with enormous size and the difficulties involved in Russia-internal (and therefore largely land-based) travel, had the result that Russia as a whole was in some ways more backwards than other European nations, being slower than most other European nations (including some Eastern European nations) to receive the benefits of political enlightenment. Also, the difficulties involved in traveling from Russia’s urban centers (e.g. St. Petersburg and Moscow)—all of which are located in the far West of the country and in which Russia’s aristocracy as well as its intelligence tended to reside---created an unusually large cleavage in outlook and in standard of living between the elite and the non-elite of Russia, which helped make Russia vulnerable to the 1917 Revolution. 
Additionally, Russia, being large and being difficult to travel within, was (and is) difficult to govern and to control, which is probably part of what made Russia slow to adopt democratic rule and which, in turn, was part of what it made relatively easy for the Bolsheviks to take over. To this day, Russia is ruled in a semi-autocratic manner, and its lack of arable manner has resulted in an economy that over-relies in petrol exports. 
Further, its harsh climate and vast internal distances make it difficult (but not impossible) to develop medium sized business. 
What led to the collapse of the Soviet Union? (Politics/History/Current 
Events) 
The proximal cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union was the lowering of gas prices that occurred in the late 80s. Russia, being a defunct, bureaucratic communist nation had very little economy, and its revenue came almost entirely from petroleum exports. So when petroleum prices fell in the late 80s, Russia was completely decapitalized, and its economy literally ground to a halt: trains containing food didn’t even leave the station, since worker’s weren’t being paid. 
The fall in prices was deliberate, being the workmanship of strongly anti-Soviet US President Ronald Reagan, who had already done much to deplete Soviet coffers by engaging in it a Nuclear Arms Race. (It was unclear whether it was Reagan’s intention in engaging in the Arms Race to decapitalize the Soviet Union. Some believe Reagan’s motivations were of a knee-jerk anti-Communist kind. Others believe that, indeed, Reagan was deliberately driving the Soviet Union to poverty and subsequent collapse.) 
Because Russia had no legitimate free market on the basis of which to generate funds, a return to Communism was not an option. At the same time, Russia had a vast grey-market economy and—as the next few years would make clear—no shortage of entrepreneurial talent. So (after a years of economic catastrophe, courtesy of Jeffrey Sachs and other Western Economic advisers) the Iron Hand of State-planning quickly made way for the Invisible Hand of the free market. 
What kind of political system does Russia have now? Is it effective? Legitimate? Explain. 
Russia is a Constitutional (constitution-based) Federal, Semi-presidential Republic. It is Federal in that, like the United States, it consists of a plurality of states that have their own individual governments but that are in their managed by a single (Federal) government. It is semi-Presidential, as opposed to presidential, in that, although the President is the de jure head of government, he shares power with a Prime Minister. (In actuality, the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, has more power than the President, Dmitry Medvedev.) 
In practice, Russia is a semi-autocratic state with democratic elements —but more of an autocracy than a democracy. This configuration is legitimate in the Russian people, though far from happy with every aspect of the job Putin is doing, seem to prefer strong, centralized governance, as opposed to decentralized, democratic governance. 
So relative to the awesome tasks faced by any possible government of Russia, the semi-autocratic, semi-democratic approach seems indicated, in that it combines the decisiveness and crisis-reading of a strong, autocratic government with the responsiveness to the people’s needs of a democratically elected government. 
Is it possible for Russia to break its dependence on strong leaders? If so, how will it get rid of Putin? And should it? 
While it is an article of faith in the West that ‘democracies’ are good and ‘autocracies’ are bad, autocracies can sometimes function better. An example is China: China’s massive economic growth and economic liberalization over the last 30 years were consequences of sapient, but strong centralized management. Russia’s economic growth during the last few decades, though not quite as good as China’s, has still been considerable. And this seems, at least in part, to have been made possible by the political stability created by Putin’s rather autocratic ruling style. 
Also, Russia, consisting as it does of a plurality of oftentimes mutually belligerent nationalities, might be better off, at least for the time being, having decisive strong rulers, instead of politically driven weak ones. Be it noted that, whereas only 1/5th of Russians express support for the democratic leaders they have had (basically Gorbachev and Yeltsin), ½ of Russians still have positive feelings about Brezhnev and Stalin![50] 

So while Putin’s future is unclear and while there is legitimate disagreement as to his merits, it seems unlikely that Western style democracy in Russia is particularly likely or desirable any time soon. 
Plato’s Republic as Pol Potist Bureaucracy (Politics/Philosophy) 
For Plato, justice is identical with people staying in their ‘rightful place.’ (“[T]o do one’s own business, in some shape or other, is justice.” [433 
b] ) Plato has a very narrow and hierarchical conception of what a person’s ‘rightful place’ is. He believes that a person’s social position should be determined by his ‘nature.’ He further believes that one’s ‘nature’ cannot in any relevant respects change. (“You are, all of you in this community, brothers. But when god fashioned you, he added gold in the composition of those of you who are qualified to be Rulers (which is why your prestige is greatest); he put silver in the Auxiliaries, and iron and bronze in the farmers and other workers.” [412 e] ) 
A corollary is that, for Plato, social strata should be rigidly defined, it being necessary that the barriers between them be virtually impenetrable. (““If they [the non-ruling classes] follow these rules, they will be safe themselves and the saviors of the city; but whenever they come to possess lands, and houses, and money of their own, they will be householders and cultivators instead of guardians, and will become hostile masters of their fellow-citizens rather than their allies.” [416 b] ) 
Further, Plato doesn’t acknowledge the legitimacy of a person’s private life. For him, the entirety of a person’s life should be subordinate to the interests of the state. Marriages should be arranged. (“We must arrange for marriage, and make it as sacred an affair as we can. And a sacred marriage is one that produces the most beneficial results.” [458 e]) And people must never marry or reproduce with people outside of their social classes. (“Guardians must ‘mate the best of our men with the best of our women as often as possible, and the inferior men with the inferior women as seldom as possible, and bring up only the offspring of the best.’” [459 e] ) 
In Plato’s ‘ideal republic’, life is so micromanaged by the state that there is practically no such thing as private life. Every aspect of each citizen’s life must be in alignment with the interests of the state, and existence is completely collectivized. (“Our men and women Guardians should be forbidden by law to live together in separate households, and all the women should be common to all the men; similarly, children should be held in common, and no parent should know its child, or child its parent.” See also: “They shall have no private property beyond the barest essentials. Second, none of them shall possess a dwelling-house or storehouse to which all have not the right of entry. Next, their food shall be provided by the other citizens as an agreed wage for the duties they perform…” [416 d] ) 
Plato correctly states that such a rigidly hierarchical social arrangement cannot be 
sustained unless the masses are kept ignorant and constantly lied to. (“And no one but the rulers must know what is happening, if we are to avoid dissension in our Guardian herd.” [459 a] ) 
So with respect to the question “To what extent does justice (for Plato) depend upon the state propagation of falsehoods?”, the answer is: Completely. For Plato, justice depends on the state’s constantly lying to its own citizenry. Not only that. It depends on its keeping them ignorant and also in the resulting gaps in its citizens’ knowledge with carefully constructed propaganda. Plato himself says this. Plato clearly states that the state must constantly subject its own citizenry to propaganda (pro-state lies) if the state is to remain intact and unified, it being Plato’s contention that nothing is more important than unity and intactness of the state. (“Is there anything worse for a state to be split and fragmented, or anything better than cohesion and unity?” [462 b] ) 
As for the question “Insofar as deception is necessary to maintain justice, can Plato’s distinction between benign or beneficial lies and improper or dangerous ones be sustained?”, the answer is: No--not at all. Of course, the answer to this question is tautologously ‘yes’ if one accepts Plato’s conception of ‘justice.’ But according to Plato’s conception of justice, nobody is entitled to any freedoms of any kind. Since there is no independent reason to accept such a conception of justice, and every reason to reject, the actual answer to the above question is indeed: No. The lies that, in Plato’s view, the state should require its citizens to accept are ones that the state must tell if it is to continue to enforce Plato’s conception of justice, According to that conception of justice, people do not have the right to listen to the kind of music they enjoy or marry the people they love or indeed do much of anything that they personally would like to do. Since such a restrictive conception of justice is false and evil, any lies that are told to uphold it are ipso facto evil, and there is therefore to principled distinction between good and evil lies in relation to such a conception.

Be it noted that, whereas only 1/5th of Russians express support for the democratic leaders they have had (basically Gorbachev and Yeltsin), ½ of Russians still have positive feelings about Brezhnev and Stalin![51] 

So while Putin’s future is unclear and while there is legitimate disagreement as to his merits, it seems unlikely that Western style democracy in Russia is particularly likely or desirable any time soon. 
Summary of Politics of Economic Growth in the States (Economics) 
In the 1980s, rates of economic growth among the various different states of India were relatively uniform. But in the 1990s, this changes. Whereas some states (e.g. Bihar, Orissa, UP, Punjab, Rajasthan) stagnated economically or even declined, rates of economic growth increased in other states (e.g. Gujarat, Kerala, West Bengal). 
How are these growth differentials to be explained? Let us start by identifying two plausible but false answers to this question. 
First liberalization in the states in question attracted investment-capital, which led to growth. Though plausible, this analysis is false, as Table 1A shows there to be no correlation between growth-rates and state-income during the period in question. 
Second, the states that had high rates of growth during the 1990s were those that had rates of growth during 1980s, and the high-rates of growth in the states in question were therefore simply the result of economic inertia. But this is simply false, as Table 1D shows. 
The actual answer is this: In each case, economic growth was a combination both of investment-capital along with pre-existing infrastructure; in other words, if a given Indian state exhibited pronounced economic growth during the 1990s, it was because of a combination of a high-degree of infrastructure on its part and a large amount of outside investment. 
Thus, states that were given a large amount of capital but had poor infrastructure did not appreciably grown, and neither did states that had good infrastructure were given little investment capital. Only those states grew that satisfied both conditions. And not only is this a priori reasonable; it is the only explanation not ruled out by the data (see Tables 1A-1D). 
Should the US have entered WWI? (History) 
The U.S. had two prima facie reasons for entering WWI on behalf of the Allies. First, the American economy stood to gain much if America fought in the War, specifically if it fought on behalf of the Allies. Second, the 
U.S. had reason to regard Germany as a military threat. In this context, it is necessary to distinguish reasons that the US had to go to war from the actual causes of its going to war, and it is necessary to distinguish each from what the US alleged to be the reasons for its going to war. We will see that although the US had legitimate economic and (to a lesser extent) military reasons for going to war, these probably were not the actual causes of its going to War. We will also see that what the US alleged to be its reasons for going to war were probably identical neither with the legitimate reasons it had for going to war nor with the actual causes of its doing so. 
WWI began in 1914 when a Serbian nationalist assassinated the Archduke Ferdinand. This led to a series of territory-disputes among the nations of Europe, which turned to into a full-blown international war. The two sides of this war were the Allies and the Central Powers. The Allies consisted of France, Britain, Russia, Japan and Italy. The Central Powers consisted Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey and Bulgaria. 
For the first 3 years of the War, the US was not involved. President Wilson urged neutrality and issued a ‘neutrality-proclamation.’ (Wilson had been re-elected on an anti-war platform with the slogan ‘he kept us out of war.’) Most Americans supported him in this. 
Both sides wanted the US to join them. The British had cultural and linguistic ties to the United States and al allowing them to drench the US with ant time, German Americans were one of th Kaiser Wilhelm II, the leader of German

part on Standardized Test Scores (Public Policy) 
In her article “Is it finally time to get rid of the SAT and ACT College Admissions Tests”, Valerie Strauss claims that by basing admissions-decisions on SAT and ACT scores, colleges and universities are somehow perpetuating some kind of systemic bias against those who are underprivileged. To this end, Strauss cites the fact that people from higher socioeconomic strata outperform those from the lower socioeconomic strata on SAT’s and ACT’s, the implication being that those tests ‘rig’ college admissions in favor of those who are already well-to-do. In this paper, a case will be made that Strauss’s suggestion, if implemented, would have disastrous consequences: instead of resulting a fair college admissions system, it would eliminate a metric that helps educators evaluate their own effectiveness and would consequently result in worse education for everybody, rich and poor alike. 
The first point is that if economically underprivileged people are underperforming on a test, the right response is to educate them better; it is not to get rid of the test. Consider the following hypothetical. In country X, each citizen must, upon turning 18, to two years of some kind of physical labor; and tests of physical ability are used to determine exactly who does what. If a given person cannot do a single push-up, then that person is not given a job that requires enormous amounts of physical strength. If someone cannot run more than ten feet without passing out, that person is not assigned a job that involves great physical endurance. In country X, wealthy people are more healthy than poor people, simply because wealth people in X have better medical care than poor people, are better nourished, drink cleaner water, and so on. Consequently, wealthy people in X vastly outperform poor people on these tests of physical aptitude. How should the government respond? Should it declare these physical tests to be ‘unjust’? Should it get rid of all tests that expose the differences in fitness and health between rich and poor? No. That would be the worst possible course of action, as it would hide the injustices in question. The right response is to keep using those metrics and to improve the performance of those whose performance is currently substandard. 
Strauss’s reasoning, if relativized to this hypothetical, would require the government of X to get rid of these fitness tests. This would make it hard to know whose fitness-levels had to improved and would perpetuate the whatever it was that was lowering the fitness levels of poor people. It would also make it hard to know whether attempts improve health and fitness were effective. Similarly, if the SAT’s and ACT’s ceased to be used, the result would simply be to cloak—not to fix—whatever it was that was responsible for the differences between rich and poor in respect of their scores on these tests. Hiding inequalities does not eliminate them; it exacerbates them and makes them harder to correct. 
Further, Strauss’s suggest that we scrap the SAT’s and ACT’s would deprive universities of an enormously valuable metric. On average, people who score high on these tests stay in college and do well in college, whereas people who score low do poorly and are highly likely to drop out. See Figures 1-3.

Figures 1-3 show that those who do well on the SAT tend to well in college and also to graduate, and they also show that those who do poorly on the SAT tend to do poorly and not to graduate. For what it is worth, this is consistent with my personal experience. To my knowledge, the people I know from high school did well on the SAT’s and ACT’s are flourishing in college, and those who did poorly are struggling and some have even dropped out. 
Straus writes: “For years, questions have been raised about the validity and value of SAT and ACT scores in college admissions. The College Board has paid for research touting the “predictive value” of SAT scores in forecasting how students will do in college and beyond, but critics have questioned the research.” We have just seen statistical proof of the claim that they are predictive of academic success. To be sure, there are enormously gifted people who do poorly on standardized tests and there are people who lack substance who do well on them. These are not perfect tests by any stretch of the imagination. But given a thousand people who scored in the top 5% on the SAT’s and a thousand who scored in the bottom 5%, the former group is much more likely to yield college-ready students than the latter, and universities would be foolish to spurn the use of SAT’s and other such metrics. 
Also, granting that standardized fail to measure creativity and insight and granting that their diagnostic value is indeed quite limited, they are one of the few meaningful data-points that college admissions have. Grades often reflect biases, either positive or negative, on the part of instructors, and ‘extra-curricular activities’, though laudable, are not little relevance to scholarly potential. 
I have a much older sister, and when she was growing up, my parents did not have enough money to send her to a good school. As a result, her education suffered and her SAT scores were mediocre. When I was growing up, my parents had the resources to send me to a good school, with the result that I did well on the SAT’s and am currently doing respectably in college. Part of what my motivated my father to earn more was his knowledge that he needed to do so to give me a good education, and my sister’s less than optimal test scores. 
Strauss tries to muddy the waters by linking the SAT’s to cheating on the part of people of means: “Is it finally time for colleges and universities to stop requiring applicants to take the SAT and ACT college admissions exams?” Strauss asks at the beginning of her article. “The question, long asked by testing critics, is being revived with new urgency amid the explosive college admissions bribery scandal rocking the world of higher education. As part of an investigation they called Operation Varsity Blues, federal prosecutors last week charged some 50 people, including famous Hollywood actresses and wealthy financiers. The alleged schemes included hiring impostors to take SAT and ACT exams, or rigging the test by asking for additional time to take it even when that wasn’t necessary.” 
This is not good reasoning. Obviously, these people were wrong to cheat, but the right response is not to get rid of the SAT but simply to make sure that people don’t cheat on it. Suppose that people bribed officials to be given life-saving medication that was in short supply. By Strauss’s reasoning, we should get rid of the medication. By my reasoning, we should prevent fraudulent use of it. 
In the United States, College admissions are to a large extent determined by one’s performance on the SAT or ACT. To be sure, one’s scores on these tests are not the only relevant factor, but admissions-committees give them enormous weight. Someone with low board scores will have a tough time getting into a top school, let alone being scholarship money. Is this right? Should one’s performance on a four-hour multiple-choice test determine where one goes to college or even whether one does so? Author and education-writer Strauss answers with a resounding "no", and she brilliantly defends her answers in her Washington Post Article "Is it finally time to get rid of the SAT and ACT college admissions test?" According to Strauss, SAT and ACT scores are no less a reflection of socioeconomic privilege than of actual merit. In defense of this, she cites the statistical fact that people from impoverished backgrounds do worse on these tests than people from wealthy backgrounds. Lest it be thought that wealthy test-takers might simply be more intelligent than poor ones, Strauss points out that the wealthy, unlike the poor, have the option of hiring private instructors to boost their performance on such tests. “[K]ids from poor families do worse than kids with money”, Strauss writes. “Wealthy parents can provide benefits that many poor families can’t, such as tutors [and] learning opportunities.” For good measure, Strauss reinforces this already weighty claim by quoting Bob Schaeffer, Director of Public Education at Fair Test. “How”, Schaeffer asks, “can any college admissions office tell whether the ACT/SAT score they receive reflects an applicant’s actual test-taking skills or whether it was inflated by test-coaching ‘steroids’?” (Strauss, 3) This is consistent with my personal experience. When raising my oldest sister, who is twelve years older than I am, my parents had little money and therefore little to invest in her education. When raising me, my parents did have resources and invested heavily in my education. As a result, I outperformed her on the SAT by a hefty margin, her Math score being 450 and mine being 750. My sister is actually mathematically gifted; but because of her straitened circumstances, she was forced to teach herself material that I had the privilege being taught by qualified instructors. My sister's low SAT scores closed off a lot of opportunities that would have been available to her had she had better instruction. She is obviously not an isolated case, and I am therefore inclined to agree with Strauss that SAT and ACT scores are quite as much a measure of wealth as they are of merit. Less than one month ago, Strauss points out, the FBI arrested over 50 wealthy financiers and famous actors for either hiring impostors to take their SAT's for their children and for other forms of SAT-related fraud. This shows us that people with money have the option not only of inflating but of falsifying their children’s test-scores; and according to Strauss, it constitutes an additional reason to marginalize the relevance of SAT and ACT scores to college admissions. Once again, Strauss quotes Bob Schaeffer, according to whom the wealthy have used a wide variety of ruses to falsify their children’s scores: “Those…schemes”, writes Schaeffer, “have included hiring impersonators to take the exams; making phony “disability’ claims to gain extra test-taking time; paying to change wrong answers or fill in missing responses; and bribing proctors and test-site supervisors to ignore these illegal acts.”(Strauss). I attended an elite private school in Thailand, and many of my classmates were given unlimited amounts of time to take tests because their parents had bribed psychiatrists to claim that they had medical conditions, such as ADHD, that warranted such dispensations. It was disturbing to me to see friends of mine cheat their way into having high test scores. 
“In some cases,” Strauss writes, “test administration in an entire country has had to be canceled at the last minute because of credible cheating allegations.” (Strauss, 2). In 2017, the SAT's were canceled in Thailand, when it was discovered that a number of students had been using high-tech glasses to have the answers fed to them. I remember a friend of my sister’s sobbing when she found out that she would not able to take the test. In situations where cheating is rampant, those who choose not to engage in it are penalized for their own integrity; and this, as Strauss points out, is yet another reason why SAT and ACT scores should be optional for college applicants. 
Strauss's arguments are compelling. Money can be used to inflate or even falsify SAT and ACT scores. So long as college admissions are based on such scores, people from wealthy families have an unfair advantage and those who have the integrity not to cheat are at an unfair disadvantage. The poor will continue to be unfairly deprived of the blessings of a college education so long as college admissions are based on SAT and ACT scores, and Strauss is therefore right that making these tests optional would do much to level the playing field. 
Being a Voter in Texas (Current Events) 
Why it is important to know about who represents you in the Texas Legislature. Be specific. 
I live in Houston Texas (specially, in 77017), which is in many respects a diverse and dynamic city. In a city of this size, there are inevitably many pressing issues; and in a city as culturally rich and diverse as Houston —as blessed by a wealth of different cultures and as cursed by the manifold difficulties striking equitable balances between so many different viewpoints­--state legislators have awesome responsibilities. It is their responsibility to make sure that the school board does its job, that city workers do their jobs, that hospitals, parks and basic public services are in working order. Further, state representatives must see to it that municipal workers do their job while also seeing to it that their district is hospitable to business. And it is proverbially difficult for representatives (or officials of any kind, for that matter) strike this balance. Our state representative in 77071 is Mary Ann Perez. Frankly, I myself have very little information about Representative Perez, so I cannot pass judgment. But her website (http://votemaryannperez.com/) provided next to no information about her views, which I found disconcerting, especially since one’s state representative is in many ways one’s go-to when one has problems within one’s own community. Obviously senators and congresspersons, having as they do both local and nation-level responsibilities, cannot be expected to respond promptly to strictly local problems. And precisely because state-representatives are there to step into that breech, it is especially helpful to know who one’s state representative is and how well he/she represents your interest. 
Three Takeaways from The Young Turks’ ‘Iceland does the Unimaginable’ (Current Events) 
Takeaway 1: In the US, bankers seem to have an almost special status. This may be a consequence of our nation’s high regard for wealth. Or it may be a consequence of the fact that they use their immense wealth to influence legislation and law-enforcement. 
Takeaway 2: In the US, regulators rationalize their failure to prosecutor bank-fraud on the grounds that, because banks are so big, doing so could disrupt the economy. But the real reason is likely that these regulators are ‘on the pad’, i.e. have been bought off. 
Takeaway 3: The spuriousness of this excuse on the part of regulator’s is evidenced by that fact that in Iceland, where they sent their top bankers to jail for fraud, the economy picked up as a result. 
Three Takeaways from WSJ Video about the European Union 
One reason that the Economic Union was created in order to bind nations together in such a way that it would not be in their interest go to war with each other. Thus, it was at least in part the traumatic experience of World Wars I and II that led Europe to see itself as needing to be economically unified. 
Another reason for establishing the EU was to consolidate the various European economies into a single super-economy that would be competitive no the world market. 
Because the EU comprises so many different economies and because it requires various different governments to agree on monetary policy, it takes a very long time to make decisions, with the result) that it cannot act quickly enough in crisis situations. And this is what happened with Greece: Greece couldn’t pay its debts, and because the EU couldn’t act quickly enough to contain the situation, Greece’s economy dragged down the other economies of the EU with it.

Divan Japonais A Paradigm of the Art Nouveau Movement 
“Art Nouveau is an international style of art, architecture and applied art, especially the decorative arts, that was most popular between 1890 and 1910. A reaction to the academic art of the 19th century, it was inspired by natural forms and structures, particularly the curved lines of plants and flowers.” 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Nouveau 
There is much truth, but also much falsehood in this definition of ‘Art Nouveau’, as we will now see in our analysis of a classic case of that movement Divan Japonais. 
Created by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec in 1892, Divan Japonais is a poster for a fashionable nightclub in Paris. Divan Japonais is an example of art nouveau. Like all artistic movements, art nouveau is better defined through examples than through words, but works belonging to this movement tend to be characterized by the use of “long, sinuous, organic lines” (https://www.britannica.com/art/Art-Nouveau). Here is an example of such a work: 

This work bears obvious similarities to Divan Japonais: 

And each work bears obvious similarities to other paradigms of this movement, for example: 

Interestingly, all of these works are similar have a decidedly ‘Japanese’ quality, as we can see when look at paradigms of classic Japanese paintings: 

Or, to take another example: 

What all these works have in common is a curious mixture of starkness, representational realism, two-dimensionalism, along with the fact that they depict people who are affecting very deliberate poses, much like actors in Kabuki theatre. 
Let us now focus on Divan Japonais: 

The iconic elements in this print are the graphic elements---the actual drawings. (Iconic representation is representation by virtue of resembling. A drawing of a hand resembles a hand and represents a hand for that reason. The express ‘Abo’s hand’ does not resemble Abod’s hand and represents said hand conventionally, or ‘symbolically’, and therefore non-iconically.) So the woman is an iconic representation (of a woman); her hat is an iconic representation; the blackness of her dress is an iconic representation (of the blackness of a dress); and so on. 
The words at the top of the poster are symbolic (conventional) representations (they denote a Parisian hotspot). There are no indexical representations (unless the painting itself is considered to be an indexical representation of the artist’s activity of depositing paint/ink on a canvass). 
The tension in Divan Japonais is more in the narrative (the message) than in either the form (the structure of the message) or the coding (use of encrypted messaging techniques). The narrative involves a highly well dressed woman, who clearly sees herself as an elegant grand dame, sitting next to a rather defeated looking man, who does not quite self-conceptualize as a member of the upper class and who does not have the upper hand in this situation. In the background there is another woman, similar to the first, with a proudly and unnaturally upright posture. The tension, I therefore surmise, lies primarily in the narrative. The fact that the woman is in the foreground, with the defeated looking man in the background, is arguably a coded message to women that at this nightclub, they will be treated as VIP’s. The fact that the defeated looking man is sandwiched between two hyper-proud women reinforces this message. 
The color-schema is hyper-coded, in that the one woman is dressed in black and the other in white, with a beige man in between them, as though the women were tag-teaming him or, alternately, as though the one woman’s seeming innocence (represented by the whiteness of her clothes) was a mask covering up manipulativeness (represented by the blackness of the other woman’s clothes). The shapes of the man and two women are literal and therefore under-coded; and the color of the clothes of the background woman —the white of her dress and the contrasting blackness of her gauntlets—is moderately cooded, in that it is both literal and also symbolic (of her being both good and bad or, more likely, of her appearing good while being a kind of predator, whose prey is this man or men of his ilk). 
This work, with its clear lines and clear visual message, overlaid on a sinister undercurrent, is characteristic of much work in the Art Nouveau 
tradition, for example: and also, interestingly, of classical Japanese art, for example: 


This last painting has clean lines and a forthright mode of exposition, but the figure depicted in it is cartoonish and contorted, almost a mockery of a person. much the same is true of the figures in Divan Japonais the same way, though in a more understated way. 
New Statendam 
Analysis of a piece of an Art Deco Work 
Art Deco, sometimes referred to as Deco, is a style of visual arts, architecture and design that first appeared in France just before World 
War 
I. 
[1] 
Art Deco influenced the design of buildings, furniture, jewelry, fashion, cars, movie theatres, trains, ocean liners, and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners.[2] 
It took its name, short for Arts Décoratifs, from the Exposition 
internationale 
des 
arts 
décoratifs 
et 
industriels 
modernes(International 
Exhibition 
of 
Modern 
Decorative 
and 
Industrial 
Arts) 
held in Paris in 1925.[3] 
It combined modernist 
styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials. During its heyday, Art Deco represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco 
This definition of ‘Art Deco’ is weak and vague, and we shall do much to improve it right now, by analyzing a classic example of Art Deco work, often referred to as “New Statendam.” 
Created in 1928 by Fernand Leger in 1928, this poster is an advertisement is for the New Statendam Holland-American shipping line. This work is an example of the art deco movement and also has heavy cubist influences. Art deco is a style of art that involves the use of clear lines, well-defined and often exaggerated geometric forms, crisp and starkly mutually contrasting colors, and an emphasis on functionality and purpose, as opposed to subtleties of meaning. In this respect, this posters (henceforth ‘New Statendam’) is a paradigm of the Art Deco movement: 

It becomes clear why this poster is so quintessentially Art Deco when 
we compare with other Art Deco paintings and illustrations, for example: 
And: 



And, finally: 
In all four of these works, we see an emphasis on clearly defined concepts, heavy use of well-defined geometrical figures, and an unflinching emphasis on functionality. Each of these paintings omits nuances of color, as well as nuances of meaning, so as to focus on shapes and on shape-related functions. Note how well-defined the Empire State building is and how crisply it contrasts with the background. Notice in the illustration of the gentleman that his facing is missing, even though his body-shape and the cut of this clothes are done with geometrical precision: the message being sent there is that function is what matters, not subjectivity. Much the same is true 

What is striking about New Statendam is that although it is an advertisement for a cruise ship, it emphasizes the functional aspects of the vessel in question: the pipes, with smoke gushing out of them, and what appear to be fuel tanks---all represented in a proudly geometrical manner, as though it were a factory that were being sold, or a freight vessel, not a cruise-line. This seems to reflect a certain optimism of this age and a faith that it had in mechanization. 
The only symbolic (purely conventional and therefore non-iconic) representations in this poster are the words. There are no indexical elements, unless the work itself is regarded as an indexical representation (i.e. as a representation by way of being an effect) of the artist’s activity. There is of course plenty of iconic representation, the most conspicuous ones being the drawings of the pipes belching smoke, all uniformly jutting up, as though they were soldiers fighting for the cause of industrial progress. 
The narrative seems to be: Hop on board on the future by booking a cruise with us. The form is scarcely distinguishable from the narrative, in that the narrative concerns the industrial efficacy of this vessel and the form consists of well-defined, seemingly functional geometrical figures. The coded message seems to be that if one doesn’t book passage on this ship, the future will pass one by. 
The smoke bellowing out of the smokestacks seems to be heavily coded, in that it has multiple messages, including the future is with this ship and also the future is toxic and noxious. The smokestacks (if that is the right word) seem to be moderately coded, in that while they are serving largely as literal representation, they also have ‘ulterior’ meanings, the main one being the vessel in question is a kind of method of transport to modernity. The color and shading on the smokestacks seem to be literal representations of actual color and shading and are therefore examples of undercoding. 
Art Deco is similar to cubism, in its heavy use of geometry and, more subtly, in its nihilistic undercurrents. But Art Deco, involving as it does clear illustrations of shapes and of other purpose-related aspects of objects, is ideal for advertisements, often being used to this end, with results that, despite their starkness, are logical and elegant, for example: 

As this last piece illustrates, Art Deco is ultimately less about nihilism than it is about progress and functionality. 
Lawn Tennis Analysis of a piece of an Art Deco Work 
As I’ve said before, “the Mod generation”, contrary to popular belief, 
was not born in even 1958, but in the 1920s after a steady gestation from about 1917 or so. Now, Mod certainly came of age, fully sure of itself by 1958, completely misunderstood by 1963, and in a perpetual cycle of reinvention and rediscovery of itself by 1967 and 1975, respectively, but it was born in the 1920s, and I will maintain this. I don’t care who disagrees with me, and there are dozens of reasons that I do so —from the Art Deco aesthetic, to flapper fashions (complete with bobbed hair), to androgyny and subtle effeminacy, to jazz.” 
- Ruadhán J. McElroy

According to this quotation, Art Deco is characterized by ‘subtle effeminacy’ and ‘androgyny’ and, so it is suggested, lacks the dignity of a ‘serious’ artistic movement. In this paper, we will see how false this characterization is. Indeed, we need only so much as glance at some paradigms of Art Deco illustrations to see as much, for example: 

Created by A.M. Cassandre in 1932, this work (henceforth “LT”, short of “Lawn Tennis”) is a poster-advertisement for a tennis tournament: 
Hence the wording on LT: “Grande Quinzaine Internationale de Lawn-Tennis” (“Grand Two week Lawn-tennis Tournament”), these words, along with the supplementary words in the header and footer positions, being the only symbolic (conventional, non-narrative, non-indexical) elements in LT. 
LT is quintessentially ‘Art Deco’, with its crisp, futuristic lines and proudly geometry-based, mathematical mode of representation. Notice that the centerpiece of this work is the tennis ball---appropriately represented by a perfect sphere---with the player, the only human being represented in this work, being reduced to a geometrical shape, stripped of a face and of a distinctive identity. This is typical of Art Deco work. (See Paper 2, specifically the representations of Bat Man and the well-dressed gentleman, neither of whom has a face but each of whom is otherwise represented with geometrical precision.) 
Note also the line of the tennis net---how it forms a perfectly uniform horizon that practically bisects the ball. 
The narrative here is that tennis, and by extension all human endeavor, is a mathematical game, not a vague spiritual endeavor. 
As previously stated, the symbolic (narrative) components of this work are confined to the words. And, as is the case with all art, there is no indexical component, unless the work itself is taken to be an indexical representation of the activities of the artist. As for symbolic representation, there is plenty: the ball resembles and thereby represents a ball; the man resembles and thereby represents a man; and so on. 
In the case of this work, the tension seems to be concentrated in the form, with the ball sphere being almost perfectly bisected by the horizon formed by the top of the next, all juxtaposed with a blank-faced, automaton-like human being. The narrative is fairly innocuous, its message basically being that tennis is being played. The coding seems to be to the effect that the ‘game’ of tennis is not so much a game as it is a matter of utter seriousness, comparable in its purposiveness to rocket-building or mathematical discovery. There is a dark energy—a mixture of optimism about industry and economics, coupled with spirituality—that informs this work and that informs Art Deco work in general. Consider the following four Art Deco paradigms: 


They all involve perfect symmetries, the absence (sometimes by way 
of omission, sometimes by way of deliberate effacement) of human subjectivity, clearly defined lines, an emphasis on functionality, sometimes to the exclusion of human welfare, an extreme confidence in science and industrialization, and an attitude of energetic, mathematically tinged optimism towards the future. What is striking about LT is that it treats a leisurely pursuit, the playing of tennis, as though it were comparable to industrial construction or scientific research, and it does this by using starkly geometrical forms and by omitting or anonymizing any human beings who might be involved, these techniques being representative of Art Deco work in general, granting that not all such work is quite as rigidly geometrical or as correspondingly inhuman. 
Art Deco is very much a product of its time, this being the early 20th Century. During this time, there was great faith in industrial progress and in the power of science and technology to improve both the technology and human life. There was also a decreased faith in religious faith and in subjectivism generally. Also, Art Deco, with its clean lines and generally utilitarian orientation, is ideal for advertising and has therefore often been 

Art Deco is an enduring style, because it doesn’t flood the mind with extraneous information and appeals to a clean-burning aesthetic, similar to, and possibly also exemplified by, the work of architect Frank Lloyd Wright: 

Student-passage and my revision thereof (Pedagogy) 
hi i need editing this passage please and rewording things 
There are many times in life where we run into a problems trying to figure things out whether at work or at school.and psychologist have come up with many different ways as to how to get over the stumbleing block and address the problem. If I was the head of a problem solving team and my team members ran into a problem. The frist stragety I would try to use to help get my team around the block is the heuristic stragety. This stragety is reffered to as the thinking strategie . where we reduce the number of options to make solving the problem much faster and easier. Another type of stragie I would try to use is an algorithm. An algorthem is stragety that uses step-by­step intructions to get to the answer. An algorthem would be useful in helping solve the problem because you are using step-by-step intruscutions and it can mostly likely get you the right answer. Trial and error can also be useful because it requires trying a number of different ways to get to the solution and helps rule out the soultions that don’t work. 
In life we have to do deal with many different kinds of problems. Some of these problems are external, meaning that they have to do with our circumstances, not with our personalities. But many of these problems are internal, meaning that they do have to do with our personalities and our ways of handling difficult situations. Psychologists help us with situations of the second kind. And even those of who are not psychologists often have occasion to put into practice the lessons that psychologists have to teach us. For example, psychologists have shown that seemingly unsolvable problems can be solved if, instead of being treated as indivisible units, they are broken down into small problems with known or easily identified solutions. This way of thinking is an example of a heuristic strategy—a strategy for dealing with complex or difficult situations. Psychologists have helped us identify many such strategies, and they have shown that our minds employ many such strategies, even without our consciously knowing it. A related concept is that of the algorithm. An algorithm is a well-defined step-by-step procedure for generating the solution to a problem. (The rules that we learn in grade school for the division and multiplication of multi-digit numbers are examples of algorithms.) The concept of an algorithm has its origins in mathematical logic, specifically in the work of Turing and other logicians. But psychologists have discovered that we unconsciously use algorithms in order to learn and to problem-solve. Sometimes more creative or informal methods are needed to solve problems, one example being the proverbial method of trial and error. Trial and error obviously doesn’t always lead to success. But oftentimes it is the only road to success, and we often learn much from our failures. One of the benefits of this method is that, precisely because it is so uncertain to lead to success, it leads to valuable experiences that inform and enrich us. The discipline of psychology, like all scientific disciplines, develops largely (though not entirely) through the use of the trial-and-error method, and psychologists have done much to clarify its importance in our lives.

Summary and Analysis of Tomatoland (Politics/Current Events) 
Tomatoland, by Barry Estabrook, is about the tomato industry in Florida, where about 70% of American tomatoes are grown. The book carefully describes the inhuman conditions under which workers in this industry labor, and it also discusses the manifold health consequences for these workers (and to a lesser extent all tomato-consumers in the US) of the heavy-duty chemicals and pesticides involved in the growth of tomatoes in Florida. The author repeatedly points out that Florida tomatoes are extremely bland and unsavory, especially as compared with tomatoes grown without pesticides, the point being that all of this loss and suffering is for naught. The author also describes the failure of the legal system to improve any aspect of this situation: it ignores the fact that slave labor is involved (and, indeed, heavily relied on); it ignores the abysmal working conditions of non-enslaved workers; and it ignores the adverse health effects of the industrial chemicals used in the process, which include sky-high cancer rates and limbless offspring. Finally, the author discusses some attempts that politicians and activists have made to remedy the situation, and he also discusses cases where people have produced quality-tomatoes without dehumanizing their workers and without using lethal chemicals. 
The book starts out by describing the origins of the American tomato industry. Tomatoes, like potatoes, were unknown to Europeans until the Spanish were introduced to them by the Aztecs and Incas. These tomatoes were small and did not have the smooth, near-spherical shape had by the tomatoes we currently use. The large, round tomatoes that we are familiar with are the handiwork of Alexander Livingston, an American entrepreneur and horticulturalist. Livingston first cultivated such tomatoes in the 1820s. Livingston’s distinctively round and succulent-looking tomatoes were a hit, and the American tomato-industry was born. 
In the 1870s, Florida became a tomato-producer, owing mainly to the fact that, thanks to recently built railroads, it was possible to quickly transport produce from Florida to the Northeast. Because of Florida’s climate, tomatoes can be grown there year-round. But with this qualification, so the author says, Florida is in many ways a terrible place to grow tomatoes. Because Florida is so hot, tomatoes have to be drenched in chemicals to keep them from being eaten by vermin. (In cooler climates, by contrast, chemicals need not be used, at least not in such abundance, granting that year-round tomato-growth is not a possibility in such places.) 
The author then shifts his discussion to the various chemical used in the growth of Florida tomatoes, going into great detail about the staggering costs both to human life, especially (but not exclusively) those of the workers involved, and to Florida’s ecosystem. After discussing the damage done to various native species (e.g. alligators and herons unable to reproduce and dying in droves), the author carefully describes the plight of the workers involved. (In this context, the author is discussing people who ‘choose’ to have these jobs.) If it rains, the workers cannot work and therefore aren’t paid. If there is moisture on the crops, they have to wait, without pay, until it dries before they can start working. On a good day, after working 12 hours, they are lucky to take home $70. Because they don’t have automobiles, they have no choice but to live near the tomato-fields, and landlords charge them outrageously high-rents, which eat up most of their salaries. They are often made ill by the chemicals they are handling and oftentimes cannot afford gloves or other basic protective gear. Because of these toxins, their children are unusually likely to be born with severe defects, including not having limbs or genitalia. But these workers don’t have insurance and therefore can’t pay for medical treatment for themselves or their children. And if a worker so much as complains of illness while on the job, he is likely to be fired and left without any source of income. Because the workers are undocumented, they are not protected by unions and, indeed, have minimal legal protections of any kind. 
The workers’ lack of legal protections brings the author to what I found to be the most poignant and informative part of the book: the discussion of the huge role of slave labor involved in the Florida tomato-industry. Many of the people picking tomatoes in Florida are veritable slaves. The companies that own the fields have agreements with human-traffickers who supply them with these workers, the latter having been abducted and forced to work, with no benefits and minimal pay, under the most brutal conditions. If they try to escape, they are beaten or killed. 
In the last part of the book, the author describes attempts that people have made to improve the situation. He talks about various civil rights and legal activists who are trying to improve working conditions, as well as purge the entire industry of slave labor. He also discusses the case of a Princeton graduate who started a successful tomato-business in Pennsylvania that, although not as lucrative as its sinister Florida counterparts, is relatively successful financial and also produces higher-quality tomatoes. 
I found this book to be readable and engaging, mainly because it was so loaded with very specific and very striking (usually strikingly grim) information about a relatively large sector of the American economy. There are very few statistics and very little analysis, but there is a wealth of carefully described, first-hand facts, and that this is this book’s greatest strength. 
It is also its greatest weakness. The author doesn’t explain why the Florida tomato-industry is so fraught with injustice. Why are conditions for workers so poor in this particular industry, and why is slave-labor used in this particular industry? Does this industry require the use of slave labor? Are its profit-margins so thin? If so, why? And why does the US government look the other way? Is the Florida tomato industry such an important part of the US economy that the government won't adequately police it? Is the United States actually without the financial resources to defray the costs of not dehumanizing workers in this industry? 
The author does mention one or two cases of reasonable successful companies that grew tomatoes without resorting unfair labor practices and without using ecocidal amounts of toxic chemicals. But each of these ‘companies’, as the author also points, though only in passing, was really just a single person, and that person did not have an operation of scale. The reader is thus left without an answer to the question: What is the alternative to the current state of affairs? 
At no point does the author explicitly put forth an economic explanation of the situation. So far as any such analysis is provided, it is confined to the usual mantra that ‘corporations’ are to blame. Nor does the author say how the situation can be improved. He spends a great deal of time talking about the efforts of various activists, along with the politicians (e.g. 
Bernie Sanders) who are sympathetic to them. But from what we can gather, these activists and politicians have done very little to improve the situation. 
This is not surprising. It isn’t activists and politicians who improve labor-conditions. It is economic development. When the industrial revolution first began in Britain, working conditions were appalling and injury-and fatality-rates were sky-high. Thanks to industrialization itself, Britain eventually became wealthy enough that it no longer needed to rely on exploitative labor practices, at which point labor unions became powerful and labor laws were put in place. Regulation can only do so much. If companies don’t have the money to pay their workers, they will either go out of business or use slave-labor, and there is nothing that regulation by itself can do to change this. Regulators can shut down companies that have unfair labor practices—and they should do so. But regulators cannot magically give these companies the funds that they need to pay their employees an honest wage. And if an industry-sector is sufficiently large, the government may choose not to regulate, especially if regulation will cause that sector to implode. Therefore, it has to be figured out how this industry-sector can be so modified that it doesn’t need to rely on unfair labor practices---and Estabrook says nothing about how to do this. Nor does Estabrook say anything as to how tomatoes can be mass-produced without using toxic chemicals. 
In sum: I enjoyed this book enormously, because it was so rich in first­hand facts, as opposed to empty statistics and abstract analysis. The problem discussed by the author is malfeasance on the part of tomato-growers in Florida, specifically in connection with grossly exploitative labor practices and also in connection with their use of environment-and health-destroying chemicals. The author doesn’t put forth an argument at all: he states facts. These facts make it clear that there is a problem, and they make it clear what that problem is (slave labor, underpaid workers, illness among workers and to some extent among the general public, and destruction of wildlife). What the author doesn’t say that is that people responsible for these horrors are obviously aware of them, and they wouldn’t continue to perpetrate them unless they had extremely strong financial incentives for doing so. And the author also doesn’t say why they have these incentives or how they honorable conduct on their part can be incentivized. So yes—Tomatoland is replete with solid evidence for specific factual claims, e.g. claims relating to worker-illness and worker-exploitation. But explanations are proposed and a fortiori no evidence or reasoning is adduced in their favor. The author did do a creditable job of explaining the history of Florida’s tomato-industry, but he doesn’t even try to identify the financial pressures that are responsible for its continued existence or for its abhorrent practices. As earlier stated, what I found most striking about this book was the discussion of slave labor in this industry-sector: I do not believe that the author is exaggerating. This is not an acceptable situation, and we as a nation must address it. But it seems to be entirely off of our national radar—a fact that I also find striking (and disturbing). 
A Demographic Analysis of Dropout-likelihood and Dropout-rationality 
Abstract 
In the fall of 2017, approximately 5 million people enrolled in college in the United States, and 56% of them had dropped out by the end of the school year (National Center for Education Statistics, 2019). In the present work, we will find that, contrary to what is generally assumed, people who drop out tend to be rational to do so. First, we will establish (1) that the greater the likely financial pay-off of a college degree, the less likely one is to drop out. Then we will establish (2) that the more likely a college degree is to lead to an emotionally satisfying career, the less likely one is to drop out. 
Claim (1) will be established on the basis of analysis of existing statistics. IQ is directly correlated with SAT-scores and SAT-scores are directly correlated with graduation-probability. The higher a given college­graduate’s SAT-scores, the greater the probable financial benefits of a college degree and the smaller the probable costs. The costs of college to those who score in the top percentile on the SAT are negligible compared to the gains. It therefore tends to be irrational for such people to drop out, and their drop-out rate is less than 1%. Strikingly, the dropout rate for those who score in the top percentile on the SAT are invariant with respect to gender, ethnicity, and personal finances. For those who score in the 40th percentile or below, the costs of a college degree a exceed the benefits. It therefore tends to be rational for such people to drop out of college, and over 60% of them do so. Dropout-rates within the class of low IQ dropouts are not invariant with respect to gender, ethnicity, and personal finances, minorities and males being marginally more likely Caucasians and females to drop out, and the socioeconomically underprivileged being non-marginally more likely than the socioeconomically privileged to do so. The higher the SAT, the more invariant dropout-rates become with respect to these variables. 
Within the class of low (<110) IQ graduates, those whose careers are based on vocational training received outside of college earn approximately 20% more than those whose careers are based on their college degrees. Within the class of low IQ persons who do not have vocational certifications, those with college degrees earn only marginally more than those without college degrees and earn less after student-debt is adjusted for. Moreover, the jobs that members of the one group are likely to have coincide for the most part with those that members of the other group are likely to have. 
Earnings therefore depend on IQ, vocational training, and college-degree. For those on the lower end of the IQ spectrum, vocational training is positively dispositive of high net earnings in those on the lower end of the IQ spectrum and a college degree is dispositive of low net earnings. In those on the upper end of the IQ spectrum, a college degree is dispositive of high net earnings and vocational training does not in general have an appreciable effect either way. More precisely, the aforementioned variables generate the following earnings hierarchy: 
(i) 
Low IQ non-graduates without vocational training 

(ii) 
High non-graduates without vocational training 


(iii) Low IQ graduates without vocational training 
(iv) 
High IQ non-graduates without vocational training 

(v) 
Low IQ non-graduates with vocational training 

(vi) 
High IQ non-graduates with vocational training 


(vii) High IQ graduates with vocational training 
(viii) High IQ graduates without vocational training 
Claim (2) cannot be established on the basis of existing statistics. This 
is not statistics are inherently incapable of settling the matter; it is simply because the existing statistical data does not exist. Consequently, the present researcher had to generate that data on his own, by administering a carefully constructed questionnaire the just-mentioned eight-groups of people, the defeasible presumption being that career-satisfaction levels will, to at least some degree, track, earnings levels.

Chapter 1: Introduction to the Study Introduction 
College dropout rates are currently over 50% and have been for over a decade (Pevin, 2015). This is often described as a ‘tragedy’ (Wolf, 2017) or a ‘scandal’ (Kirp, 2019). On the face of it, this is understandable. Dropping out is a form of quitting, and quitting is in many contexts a form of failure. Also, a college degree has come to be associated in the popular psyche with ‘the good life’---two cars in the driveway, a house in the suburbs, and so on (Corn, 2017). Also, just as Hillary Clinton said, college graduates do on average earn approximately $1,000,000 during their lifetimes than non-graduates (Bartik, 2016). Finally, it is obvious to many people that if they hadn’t gone to college, they wouldn’t have the careers that they do have: they wouldn’t be investment bankers or physicians or attorneys (Altoni et al., 2016). 
The truth is, however, that the dropout rates are not high enough. There is relatively definitive evidence of this of a purely objective, statistical nature. We will discuss this evidence in detail in the present work, but the upshot of it is easily stated: Those with high IQ’s economically benefit from college, and those with low IQ’s don’t. The reason for this, quite simply, is that people with low IQ’s derive little economic benefit from academic courses of study and are economically better off learning and practicing a trade. Not only is this the obvious, off-the-cuff explanation: it is, as we will go to great lengths to show, a matter of demonstrable statistical fact. These claims will be established on the basis of rigorous statistical analysis. 
Of course, money isn’t everything. Given only that someone with a low IQ stands to earn more money practicing a trade than he does using his college degree, it doesn’t follow that he is more fulfilled if he takes the first path. That said, we will show that he is in fact more fulfilled. We will show on the basis of survey-data that low IQ college graduates, not including those whose careers are based on vocational training received outside of college, are among the least fulfilled sub-populations in the country. The happiest sub-population, as those same surveys indicate, consists of high IQ college graduates, and the second happiest is vocationally trained college non-graduates. 
We will establish this by administering a carefully constructed questionnaire to eight groups of people. The groups in question are: 
(i) 
Low IQ non-graduates without vocational training 

(ii) 
High IQ non-graduates without vocational training 


(iii) Low IQ graduates without vocational training 
(iv) 
High IQ non-graduates without vocational training 

(v) 
Low IQ non-graduates with vocational training 

(vi) 
High IQ non-graduates with vocational training 


(vii) High IQ graduates with vocational training 
(viii) High IQ graduates without vocational training 
2. 
The survey uses a seven-point Likert-scale, making it possible to condense questionnaire-results into a single figure and therefore making it possible to establish quantitative comparisons between survey-results. 

3. 
Survey results will establish the following ‘fulfillment­hierarchy’: 


(ix) 
Low IQ non-graduates without vocational training 

(x) 
High non-graduates without vocational training 

(xi) 
Low IQ graduates without vocational training 


(xii) High IQ non-graduates without vocational training 
(xiii) Low IQ non-graduates with vocational training 
(xiv) High IQ non-graduates with vocational training 
(xv) High IQ graduates with vocational training 
(xvi) High IQ graduates without vocational training The reasons for targeting these specific groups is that, as we will see, dropout-likelihood and dropout-rationality depend on IQ and vocational-training. 
Background of the Study 
There is plenty of statistical data concerning college­dropoutism, but this data has not been properly interpreted. Attempts have been made to correlate dropout-rates with ethnicity (Shapiro et al., 2017), distance from home (Patterson Silver Wolf et al., 2017), relationship-status (Adams et al., 2016), eating disorders (Lipson et al., 2017), mental health (Eisenberg, 2016), video game usage (Schmitt et al., 2015), and personal finances (Britt et al., 2017)---all to little or no avail. What the statistical data makes absolutely clear is that people with extremely high SAT/ACT scores (henceforth ‘test-scores’) seldom drop out and that people with low test-scores usually drop out. The data also makes it clear that test-scores correlate with IQ (Armstrong et al., 2017), warranting the conclusion that dropout-likelihood correlates inversely with IQ. This is invariant across genders, ethnicities, relationship-statuses and the like. Further, the statistical data makes it clear towards the lower end of the IQ spectrum, the economic benefits of a college degree become marginal at best and also those benefits are directly dependent on IQ, with those in the gifted range economically benefitting enormously from college. 
Be it noted that the statistical data does not directly disclose any of this, even though, when scrutinized, it clearly does indicate as much. The correlation between dropout-likelihood and IQ is readily enough established. The correlation between dropout-rationality and IQ is not as easily established, granting that the difficulties in establishing it are ultimately purely technical in nature. Neither correlation is particularly hard to establish given the available statistical data, making it hard (but also, given our purposes, unnecessary) to explain why these correlations have not yet been established. 
A consequence of the fact that it has not thus far been established exactly who drops out is that it also has not been established how economically rational it is for those who drop out to do so. A consequence of this latter fact, in its turn, is that economic dropout-rationality has not yet been correlated with emotional dropout-rationality. In other words, the degree to which it is economically rational for a given person to drop out of college has not been correlated with the degree to which his doing so conduces to his having an emotionally fulfilling career. 
Problem Statement 
Prior to this study it was not known exactly who dropped out or why; nor, therefore, was it known to what extent it was rational for those who dropped out to do so. The purpose of this study is to answer each of these questions, with special attention being paid to the relationship between dropoutism and career-satisfaction. An expected consequence of this study will be a need to reframe our thinking about college-dropouts and college­dropoutism. Thus far, we have regarded dropouts as being the failures (Hollander et al., 2017) and those trying to prevent them dropping out as the heroes (Moriña et al., 2017; Bullard, 2018). 
This study will show that it is the other way around. Forcing people to go to college who are not inclined to do so deprives them of income and professional fulfillment and is also enormously expensive for society as a whole. There are many reasons for this. First of all, there are many people who are happy and financially successful as auto-mechanics---or electricians or plumbers or as practitioners of some other trade---who would be miserable if, instead of learning their trade, they had gone to college. Many such people are gifted at their trade, and many people need their services and pay handsomely for them. Those same people would in many cases not be faring as well had they opted for a college-based path. They would often struggle with the coursework and either drop out, in which case they are likely to self-identify as failures, or choose a major that gives them no marketable skills, in which case they are likely to be failures. 
Also, trades (e.g. auto-repair, plumbing, carpentry) are inherently useful. A person with an IQ can become a master plumber or auto-mechanic; and if they do, they will never have to worry about employment. Also, many people who learn trades launch successful businesses of their own based on those trades, and 70% of successful small to medium-sized business are started in this way. But liberal arts degrees, however much intrinsic value they may have, tend to provide those who have them with very little in the way of marketable skills. There is no obvious way for an intellectually average or even moderately intelligent person to monetize a degree in English or History or Philosophy. If someone is intellectually gifted, he may be able to find a way to leverage into a successful career of some kind; he may become a journalist or professor or financier. But these are long-shots even those who are intellectually gifted, and for most they are simply out of the question. The result is that most people with liberal arts degrees find themselves in an extremely competitive job-market with little to offer to prospective employers and no skills on the basis of which to become self-employed. 
It is assumed that STEM degrees, unlike degrees humanities and social sciences degrees, are inherently useful. This position is misconceived. First of all, most STEM are intellectually out of reach for most of the population, including most of the college population. Second, most STEM degrees, including those that are within the intellectual reach of the average college student, are not inherently useful. A degree in biology does not by itself qualify anyone to do anything. In the case of someone who is intellectually gifted, a degree in biology may eventuate in that person’s being a physician or researcher, but usually only on the condition that the person in question spend years in graduate school or medical school. But these are low-probability outcomes for someone of average or even moderately high intelligence, and a degree in biology opens up very few professional avenues for such a person. To be sure, somebody with a bachelor’s degree in petroleum engineering or computer science is for that reason alone likely to have excellent professional prospects, the same being true, albeit to a lesser extent, of someone with a bachelor’s in chemistry. But less than 20% of college students are able to complete even the first year of any given one of these majors. 
As for mathematics and physics, degrees in these fields, in and of themselves, do very little to make those who have them employable. To be sure, people with bachelor’s degrees in these fields are relatively likely to achieve professional success, but their becoming successful usually involves their spending years after college becoming proficient in areas (e.g. programming, architecture, finance) that are only tangentially related to their undergraduate degrees. But all of this is moot, given that less than 10% of all college students are able to complete even the first year of either of these majors. 
Today (July 3, 2019), the Washington Post reported that only 27% of people with college degree have jobs in areas relating to their college degrees (Plummer, 2019). By contrast, over 90% of those with vocational degrees have jobs in the areas of their degrees (Wladawsky-Berger, 2018). This is understandable. A credential in HVAC or plumbing or computer­maintenance makes one very useful; a degree in English or Religious Studies does not. A consequence is minor economic downturns greatly effect employment-and income levels of college graduates but have little effect on those of tradespersons (Alonso, 2015; Jahn et al., 2015; Friedman, 2018; Arnold, 2018; Levin-Waldman, 2018). 
Purpose of the Study 
The purpose of this study is to determine how rational it is for those who drop out of college to do so. This will involve figuring how exactly who drops out of college, i.e. we must first identify the characteristics that dispose someone to drop out of college. Having done this, we must correlate dropout-likelihood with probably average future earnings and also with probably average degree of career-satisfaction. 
Ultimately, what we refer to as ‘rationality’ coincides not with economic rationality but with emotional rationality. Stated simply, for a person to be rational is for him to make decisions that conduce to his emotional well-being. This often involves making decisions that conduce to one’s financial well-being. But economic rationality cannot be identified with rationality since someone who makes decisions that make wealthy but suicidally depressed is ceteris paribus less rational than someone who makes decisions that make him fulfilled but only moderately wealthy (Bennett, 2016). 
This is not a purely theoretical point. Setting aside those who simply don’t earn enough to satisfy basic needs, there is surprisingly little correlation between happiness-levels and income (Easterlin, 2015). Happiness is more easily correlated less with how much they earn than with how they earn it (Oishi et al., 2015). Lawyers who earn under $100,000 have extremely low rates of career-satisfaction, and most entrepreneurs who earn more than $25,000/year have extremely high rates of career satisfaction (Hessels et al., 2018). 
Because rationality clearly involves being able to make decisions that conduce to one’s own emotional well-being, we cannot go so far as to identify rationality with economic rationality (Christiansen, 2017). But there are important reasons not to disregard the concept of economic rationality. First of all, if people who are dropping out of college are rational to do so, that suggests that instead of wasting resources trying to keep them in college, we should use resources to identify and improve access to alternative professional paths. Second, economic rationality is completely objective: whereas people’s emotional self-assessments, though prima facie credible, may be replete with rationalizations, there is no denying how much a given person earns or what kind of work he does to earn it (Ervas, 2017). In this study, consequently, we will investigate both the economic and the emotional rationality of college-dropoutism. 
Research Questions and/or Hypotheses 
This study will investigate in what ways and to what degrees the consequences of dropping out of college depend on IQ and receipt of vocational training. Given the fact that many ‘high-IQ’ careers (e.g. physician, investment banker, professor) are simply out of the question for those who do not have college degrees, there exists a reasonable, if defeasible, presumption to the effect that it is in general more rational than not for those in the intellectually gifted range to graduate from college. What is less obvious is whether the same is true of those on the other end of the IQ spectrum. Day-to-day experience suggests that, where such people are concerned, a college degree tends to lead to a tedious and low-level office job. Day-to-day experience also suggests that, when such people receive vocational training and careers based thereupon, their work, though arduous, tends to be both lucrative and fulfilling. To put it bluntly and informally, auto-mechanics, super-intendents, welders, Emergency Medical Technicians, and Web-designers seem to enjoy their work, whereas secretaries, probation officers, intake-coordinators, low-level administrators, and office-workers do not seem to enjoy their work. Of course, these claims, being based only on personal experience, cannot be asserted with confidence, it being the purpose the present study to subject them to systematic scrutiny. 
Consequently, the following research question guides this qualitative study: 
RQ1: To what extent are those who drop out of college behaving rationally in doing so? 
There are two versions of RQ1, namely: 
RQ1F: To what extent are those who drop out of college being 
financially rational in doing so? In other words, to what extent does their doing so lead to increased earnings? 
And: RQ1E: To what extent are those who drop out of college being 
emotionally rational in doing so? In other words, to what extent does their doing so lead to increased career-satisfaction? 
In order to answer RQ1, we must first answer some other questions, in particular: 
RQ2: Who drops out of college? In other words, what characteristics are dispositive of a person’s dropping out of college? (Is it poverty, mental illness, physical illness, unstable home life, low IQ, etc.?) 
RQ2 can be answered on the basis of existing statistical data, the answer being: 
HQ2: The higher a given person’s IQ, the less likely he is to drop out of college. 
RQ1F is also to be answered on the basis of statistical analysis. The 
null-answer is: HQ1F0: A person’s IQ does not in general have any bearing, positive 
or negative, on whether it is financially for that person to drop out of 
college. 
The expected answer is: 
HQ1F: The higher a given person’s IQ, the less financially rational it is 
for him to drop out of college. 
RQ1E: is not to be answered on the basis of existing statistical data. 
We will attempt to answer it on the basis of survey data. The null answer is: HQ1E: A given person’s dropping out of college may conduce to 
increased career-satisfaction or to decreased career-satisfaction; and whether it does the one as opposed to the other is completely random and of his major, his intelligence level, and indeed any other given fact about him. 
The expected answer 
HQ1E: Categorizing people by IQ and college degree status generates 
the following career-satisfaction hierarchy: 
(i) 
Low IQ non-graduates without vocational training 

(ii) 
High non-graduates without vocational training 


(iii) Low IQ graduates without vocational training 
(iv) 
High IQ non-graduates without vocational training 

(v) 
Low IQ non-graduates with vocational training 

(vi) 
High IQ non-graduates with vocational training 


(vii) High IQ graduates with vocational training 
(viii) High IQ graduates without vocational training HQ1E is the ‘expected’ answer in three senses. First, it is consistent 
with statements made, but not adequately supported, in credible publications (Looseley et al., 2019). Second, it is consistent with my personal and professional experience. Third, it is consistent with small, informal studies that I have conducted in anticipation of the present study. 
Advancing Scientific Knowledge and Significance of the Study 
This study has manifold practical and theoretical significances. First of all, if the hypotheses stated above are correct, then the enormous resources that are being spent trying to prevent people from dropping out of college should instead be spent trying to build alternatives to college (Bok, 2017). Also, right now, k-12 education is essentially college-prep education (Harbour, 2015), and the current study is likely to show that this is misconceived: where many students are concerned, possibly most, the focus should not be on getting them into college, but on constructing alternatives to college. Also, as we will see, when low persons in the non-gifted IQ range have careers that they find fulfilling, those careers are based on vocational training, not on college degrees, and, what is more, those careers service vital and otherwise insufficiently serviced economic sectors. Right now, thanks to the exclusive focus on getting people, regardless of their talents, into and through college, many people are being steered away from careers that they would enjoy and be good at and that would benefit society. Governments and government-related bureaucracies being what they, might cannot necessarily expect the existing educational establishment to right-size itself, and the private sector may therefore have to step into this breech. 
This study also has significance of a purely theoretical kind for the fields of psychology and economics. According to the hypotheses stated above, entrepreneurs have higher levels of career satisfaction than ‘corporate wage-slaves’ who earn three times as much, and people who practice traces, such as plumbing and auto-repair, are happier than probation officers and administrators who earn twice as much. If correct, this tells us a great deal about human motivations, and it also tells us that what drives economic progress is not the desire for money so much as it is the desire for money that is acquired in a way that is consistent with one’s values and personality (Pagenelli, 2015). 
Rationale for Methodology 
There are three different investigative methodologies: quantitative, qualitative, and mixed. Quantitative methodologies attempt to assign numerical values to relevant factors and to investigate relations of dependence and predictability holding among such values (Hempel, 1965; Curtis et al., 2016); Salmon, 2017). Suppose for example that violent crime in Small Town USA has increased 500% over the last decade. A quantitative analysis of this phenomenon would try to find some numerically determinate variable (or variable-set) x (e.g. consistently decreasing funding for law-enforcement) such that changes in x correlated with the rise in crime in Small Town. Qualitative methods investigate causal relations holding among forces that either have not yet been quantified or cannot be quantified in any principled way. A qualitative analysis of the rise in crime in Small Town might involve case-studies of specific criminals, or interviews with criminals or victims of crime or law-enforcement personnel, the purpose being to elicit relevant information (e.g. information about changes in cultural norms). A mixed methodology is one that involves elements of both qualitative and quantitative methodologies (Rudestam & Newton, 2015). When applied to the rise in crime in Small Town, such an approach might involve a combination of the methods must described. 
There are two components to this project: a purely statistical component, in which the demographics of dropoutism are investigated, and a survey-based component, in which the psychology of dropoutism is investigated. In each case, the methodology used is quantitative. But there are important differences between the methodologies used, owing to the fact that, whereas the statistics needed to investigate the financial aspects of dropoutism already exist, the statistics needed to investigate its consequences for career-satisfaction do not yet exist, requiring us to generate those statistics ourselves. Consequently, the methodology used in the one case related only to the analysis of statistics, whereas the methodology used in the other case related both the analysis and to the generation of statistics. 
Nature of the Research Design of the Study 
Both parts of the inquiry were quantitative and causal-correlational in nature. The statistical part correlates dropout rates with IQ and subsequent earnings; the psychological part correlates earnings with levels of career-satisfaction. The statistical part involved nothing more than finding correlations so tight that they were obviously causal and then using commonsense to infer what the operative causal relations were. For example, there is an extremely tight connection between low SAT score and high freshman dropout-likelihood, but it is obvious that a low SAT score is not itself the cause of someone’s dropping out of college. An inability to do academic work is the cause, and this inability is manifested both in low SAT scores and also in poor performance in first-year college classes, the latter often being the immediate precursor of (voluntary or involuntary) permanent departure from college (Mabel et al., 2018). 
The psychological part involved administering surveys whose results could be represented as a single variable. Our objective here is to compare earnings with levels of career-satisfaction. Earnings are given by a single figure (e.g. $170,000/year), and we therefore need career-satisfaction to be represented by a single quantity if we are to correlate it with earnings and, consequently, if we are to determine how emotionally rational those who drop out are in doing so, i.e. if we are to determine degrees of dropoutE­
rationality (Chen et al., 2016) 
Definitions of Terms 
Dropout. In this context, a ‘dropout’ is somebody who drops out of college and does not return. Somebody who takes a year off is not a dropout. 
Dropoutism. The phenomenon of people dropping out of college. 
Dropout-likelihood. The probability that a given person will drop out of college. 
Dropout-probability. Synonymous with “dropout-likelihood.” 
Dropout-rationality. The degree to which it is rational for a given person to drop out of college. 
DropoutE-rationality. The degree to which it is economically rational 
for a given person to drop out of college. DropoutF-rationality. The degree to which it is emotionally rational 
(i.e. conducive to career-satisfaction) for a given person to drop out of college. Dropout-non-vocational. Somebody who drops out of college and then receives vocational training Dropout-vocational. Somebody who drops out of college and then receives vocational training. Dropoutism. A neologism used to denote the phenomenon of people dropping out of college. 
Economic Rationality. Ability to make decisions that maximize earnings. The concept of economic rationality is well defined, given that earnings can be quantified. Some scholars have attempted to broaden the concept of economic rationality to include other variables, such as quality of life, but these extensions of the concept of tend to strip it of operational significance. Importantly, economic rationality, narrowly construed, correlates with other quantifiable variables, such as health and longevity, which in their turn bear on quality of life. 
Graduate. In this context, a ‘graduate’ is someone who graduates from college. 
Graduation-likelihood: The probability that a given person will graduate from college. 
IQ. Short of ‘intelligence quotient.’ Existing ways of determining IQ are deeply flawed, as is evidenced by the quite routine occurrence of people who apparently do poorly on IQ tests but whose professional accomplishments unambiguously indicate extremely intelligence. That said, however unreliable the standard IQ tests may be with respect to geniuses and other outliers, they have proven reliable and useful and reliable when dealing with large populations, and IQ scores generated by such tests are therefore useful in the context of this study. 
Graduation-probability: Synonym of “graduation-likelihood.” IQ-comparable (adjective). x and y are IQ-comparable if they are in the same IQ range. IQ-comparables (noun). x and y are IQ-comparables if they are IQ-comparable. 
Non-dropouts. A neologism used to denote someone who has either graduated or is currently in college and has not dropped out of college thus far. 
Non-attendant. A neologism used to denote someone who simply doesn’t attend college at all. 
Rationality. Ability to make decisions that maximize one’s welfare. The concept of rationality simpliciter is of limited utility, owing to the absence of clear benchmarks, and often gives way to the better-defined concept of economic rationality. 
RQ. Given a particular IQ, the corresponding RQ is the ratio of average lifetime earnings of college graduates with that IQ to average lifetime earnings of non-graduates with that IQ. So RQ corresponding to IQ 103 is the ratio of average lifetime earnings of graduates with an IQ of 103 to average lifetime earnings of non-graduates with an IQ of 103. 
Test-score. Refers only to SAT and ACT scores. Oftentimes, the terms “SAT score”, “ACT score” and “SAT/ACT score” will be used; but whenever “test-score” is used, it is used to refer only to SAT/ACT scores. 
Assumptions, Limitations, Delimitations 
It is assumed that the statistical data that we are not ourselves generating is reliable. This assumption is warranted, given that in each case that data was collected by a reliable agency, such as the National Center for Education Statistics. We are also assuming that is administering the survey that we are using will in fact administer it to populations of the appropriate types. For example, when we task the survey company with administering our survey to people who have vocational certifications, we are assuming that they are in fact doing so. This assumption is warranted given that we are using a reputable survey-service. 
There is one very serious delimitation, namely that it cannot be ruled out that survey-results express wishful-thinking and rationalization (Daviaux et al. 2016). This is inherent in all psychological surveys (Taswell, 2015). That said, there are three ways in which we are hedging against this possibility. First, we will always have information about the respondent’s economic-situation, simply the company that is directly administering the survey will target people according to their demographics, including their earnings. Second, each population will be issued multiple different surveys; and if there is a tendency for a given population to respond disingenuously on a given survey, its answers on that survey are likely to conflict with its answers on the other surveys (Cosco et al., 2016). Finally, the surveys being used are already widely used and their efficacy has been established. 
Summary and Organization of the Remainder of the Study 
Chapter 2 will review the existing literature relating to the topic of this study, along with the relevant statistics. The statistical data is abundant. The literature, however, tends to be inconsistent with or non-explanatory of the statistical data. In Chapter 2, we will state the relevant statistics in detail and provide creditable models of them. In Chapter 3, methodology will be discussed. We will identify the underpinnings of the statistical work done in Chapter 2 and will also explain exactly how we will be using surveys to elicit information relating to career-satisfaction. In Chapter 4, we will analyze the survey results, and we will also restate, this time in more detail, the results of our statistical analysis of dropoutism; and we will compare those two bodies of data. In Chapter 5, we will identify the changes in public policy and also in personal conduct that are indicated by the contents of Chapter 4. 
Chapters 1-3 are already complete. The survey has already been constructed; the survey-company has verified that it can send the requisite number of surveys to the relevant populations; and the researcher has already familiarized himself with the survey software. Chapter 4 should be complete before October 2019, and Chapter 5 by January 1, 2010. 
Chapter 2: Literature Review Introduction to the Chapter 
It is easy to find out how many people don’t graduate from college (NCES, 2019a). It is also easy, though not quite as easy, to find out how many people within a given demographic fail to graduate from college (NCES, 2019b). It is not possible to find information to the effect that a person's likelihood of dropping out is a function of his having characteristic X, for some appropriate value of X. Blacks are less likely to graduate from college than whites (Shapiro et al., 2017), but 43% of blacks have college degrees and 43% of whites don't (Stout et al., 2018), and being as opposed to white, or vice versa, therefore cannot be the missing value of X in “X is why people drop out.” Similarly, males are more likely to drop out than females (Strumbos et al., 2016); but the differences are marginal, and “being male” is therefore not the missing value of X. Dropout-rates cannot even be explained in terms of poor financials. High-performing college students from impoverished backgrounds are less likely to drop out than poor-performing students from wealthy backgrounds (Korn et al., 2015; Yeager et al., 2016), and extremely high performing students from impoverished backgrounds have only marginally higher rates of dropoutism than comparably performing students from wealthy backgrounds (Hoxby et al., 2013). So poor financials, though obviously a contributing factor, are not the or even a principle factor. Religious people are less likely to graduate than non-religious people (Tentsho et al., 2019); and people who have formally diagnosed as having a serious mental illness are less likely to graduate than those who have not been so diagnosed (Naslund et al., 2015). Even if we form the intersection of each these ‘less-than' groups---even if we consider the class of socioeconomically disadvantaged, religious, mentally ill, minority males--the resulting group still has a graduation rate of around 25%, showing that none of the characteristics is more than marginally responsible for the phenomenon of dropoutism. 
Given that we don’t know what causes people to drop out, we don’t know how economically rational it is for people who drop out to do so. We are given extremely broad statistical claims, e.g. ‘college graduates out-earn non-graduates by $1,000,000’ (Witteveen et al., 2017), that supposedly settle the issue—but clearly don’t. Does staying in college always conduce to higher earnings? If not, when does it do so? We do not have answers to these questions. 
Nor do we have an answer to the question: How emotionally rational is it for people who drop out of college to do so? In other words, to what extent does their doing so conduce to their fulfillment or career-satisfaction? The presumption is that dropouts tend to end up slaving away at menial, low-paying jobs, whereas graduates tend to end up having intellectual demanding, high-paying careers. But this presumption is indeed just that. In this chapter, we will review the literature, along with the statistics, bearing on these matters. The literature is of little use, we will find, but the statistical data is of use, if properly interpreted. 
Identification of the Gap 

Who drops out of college and why, and what are they gaining and foregoing by doing so? These questions have not been answered. There is an abundance of literature concerning the demographics of dropoutism, but the claims therein made, even if correct, have little or no explanatory force. 
Within the last five years, it has been alleged, by scholars publishing in reputable journals, that dropoutism is ‘linked’ to: 
*Ethnicity (Boyraz, 2016) 
*Drug/alcohol abuse (Ho, 2016) 
*Mental illness (Mitchell, 2016) 
*Religious belief (Li, 2017) 
*Video game usage (Cochran, 2018) 
*Absence of easily accessed academic advisers and psychotherapists (Lovelace, 2017) 
*Poor dormitory and living conditions (Li, 2019) 
*Level of parents’ education (Stewart, 2015) 
*Parents’ combined income (Stewart, 2015), and 
*Relationship status (DeLuca, 2016). 
Only 30% of African Americans graduate from college. Therefore, there is a ‘link’ between race and dropout-likelihood (Tate, 2017). 
Dropouts are more likely than non-dropouts to play video-games. Therefore, there is a ‘link’ between video-game usage and dropout-likelihood (Dunckley, 2016). 
Dropouts are more likely than non-dropouts to have experienced serious childhood trauma. Therefore, there is a ‘link’ between childhood-trauma and dropout-likelihood (Dube, 2018). 
Dropouts are more likely to be religious than non-dropouts. Therefore, there is a ‘link’ between religious belief and dropout-likelihood. 
Dropouts often cite relationship issues when explaining why they dropped out. Therefore, there is a ‘link’ between relationship-status and dropout-likelihood (Legg, 2017). 
Dropouts more likely than non-dropouts to self-describe or be formally described as depressed or otherwise mentally ill. Therefore, there is a ‘link’ between depression/mental illness and dropout-likelihood (Marsh, 2017). 
People from low-income homes are more likely than those from high­income homes to drop out. Therefore, there is a ‘link' between parents' income and dropout-likelihood (Jaschik, 2015). 
People whose parents did not complete college are more likely to drop out than those whose parents did complete college. Therefore, there is a ‘link’ between parents’ education-level and dropout-likelihood (Casey, 2018). 
Dropouts are (in 2019) more likely than to be male than female. Therefore, there is a ‘link’ between gender and dropout-likelihood (Samuels, 2017). 
Let us scrutinize these claims. 30% of African Americans do graduate from college. So the ‘link’ between ethnicity is at best weak (Paul, 2018). 
Non-dropouts are as likely as dropouts to claim to be suffering from ‘serious relationship issues.’ (Greenburg, 2011). 
Although may cases of dropping do appear to be precipitated by mental illness, depression and suicidal ideation are in fact markedly more common among non-dropouts, being particularly high in those who enroll in doctoral programs (Wong, 2018). 
Students from “low-income” homes are indeed 600% more likely high income students to drop out, if ‘low income’ and ‘high income’ are taken to mean, respectively, “annual income of less than $30,000” and “annual income of more than $250,000”—but only because the graduation rate in the second group is less than 3%. Therefore, the ‘low parental income’ theory at most describes an ancillary factor. 
Religious students are only around 10% more likely than non-religious students to drop out. Also, this figure varies enormously depending on the religious denomination. Mormons have an exceedingly low drop-out rate, as do Orthodox Jews (Saxe et al. 2013). 
Non-dropouts are as likely as dropouts to be dissatisfied with dormitory-conditions, with their social lives, and with the degree of access to student-advisers and psychotherapists (Beiter et al. 2015). 
Dropouts are at most only marginally more likely than non-dropouts to play video-games excessively or to abuse drugs/alcohol, and there is some indication that video-game usage helps prevent those with severe depression from dropping out of college (Parker, 2019). 
There are deeper problems with these studies. Maybe people who drop out drink/do drugs/play video games because they don’t want to be in college. In other words, maybe their desire to drop out is the cause, and their engaging in these maladaptive behaviors is the effect. This is not a mere theoretical possibility, as we are about to say. 
Also, maybe soon-to-be dropouts are right not to want to be in college. Maybe they are depressed about being in college because they suspect that it is a waste of their time and money. Indeed, this is likely the case, we will find. 
African Americans with test-scores (SAT/ACT scores) in 90th percentile and above are minimally likely to drop out and are less likely to do so than their white counterparts. Students in the 95th percentile above have less than a one percent change of dropping out, regardless of gender, ethnicity, religious denomination, drug/alcohol use, mental illness/depression, relationship-status, and indeed any other given variable. 
A related fact is that students who drop out are overwhelmingly likely to be struggling academically, which is consistent with what we have said about IQ vis-à-vis dropout-likelihood and also with the fact, noted by Allen et al. (2017), that ACT-scores are predictive of graduation-likelihood. 

Figure 1 ACT vis-à-vis Likelihood of Having a 4.0 Average Freshman Year 
Adapted from: Jeff Allen and Justin Radunzel, “Relating ACT Composite Score to Different Levels of First Year College GPA.” ACT Table 4, May 2017. 
Approximately 80% of students with test scores in the 40th percentile or below drop out of college (Rothwell, 2017); and this figure is almost invariant with respect to gender, ethnicity, religious denomination, drug/alcohol use, mental illness/depression, relationship-status, and indeed any other given variable (Cooper, 2014). The totality of this data suggests that ethnicity, relationship status, etc. contribute to dropoutism only in those in the middle-range, suggesting that they function only as contributory causes. 
Also, there is a complete absence of data concerning the immediate aftermath of a person’s dropping out. It may be that their rates of depression, drug-use, etc. decrease. This is an open empirical question. If the answer is ‘yes’, then college was, to so speak, the disease, and dropping out the cure. 
More importantly, what are the economic prospects of those who drop out? Do they lose opportunities or gain them? We can’t answer that until we can identify some variable that correlates tightly with high dropout rates and then correlate that same variable with economic prospects. The literature has not identified this X-factor. 
Another deeply striking fact about the scholarly literature is that it always takes it as a given that dropping out is failure. It is not asked why students drop out. Nor is it asked what they gain by doing so. Sometimes it is asked what they would have lost by not dropping out; but the answers subsequently given are strictly financial in nature and, more importantly, don’t involve consideration of important sub-divisions within the class of non-graduates, in particular, the distinction between those who receive vocational training and those who do not. 
Identification of the Gap (Continued): The Statistical Data 
The academic literature is disappointing. The statistics are more illuminating. There are two statistics that are especially important: those relating IQ to test-scores (SAT/ACTS scores) to graduation rates, and those relating test-scores to IQ. The higher the test-score, the higher the likelihood of graduation (See Figures 1-9); and the higher the IQ, the higher, the test-score (See Figures 10-11). In each case, we are dealing with strictly monotonic correlations; and these nearly monotonic correlations explain many of the weak correlations earlier discussed.

The statistical data relating to ACT/SAT scores is independently corroborated by the fact that the graduation rate of a given college is a function of the average SAT scores of its students: the higher the average SAT score, the higher the graduation rate. To be sure, we are not dealing with strictly monotonic correlations. First of all, schools falling into special categories, e.g. theological seminaries, may have different graduation-rates from test-score-comparable liberal arts colleges. Also, there are cases average test-scores at colleges differ marginally (i.e. by less than 15 percentiles) but where the one has a higher graduation-rate than the other. But within these limits, average SAT/ACT-score correlates strictly monotonically with higher graduation-rates. See Figure 9. 
Once it becomes clear who drops out and why, it becomes possible to answer important questions that have not yet been systematically investigated, let alone answered, namely: What are the prospects for dropouts? What do they stand to gain by dropping out and what do they stand to lose? What kinds of careers do they subsequently have? Are they satisfied with those careers? How do their levels of career-satisfaction compare with those of non-dropouts? Answering these questions involves dealing with important theoretical issues, which we will now discuss. 
Theoretical Foundations and/or Conceptual Framework 
The phenomenon of dropoutism has thus far been studied from cultural, political, and emotional perspectives. It has been taken for granted that high dropout rates are a ‘tragedy’, and scholarship has consisted, with few or no exceptions, to find someone or something to blame. In some cases, the blame is placed on psychopathology: dropouts are alleged to be drug addicts, alcoholics, victims of childhood trauma, or simply mentally ill. In other cases, the blame is placed on classism or racism: dropouts do not have the right skin color or do not come from the right background. In other cases, blame is placed on inhospitable university environments: there are not enough student counselors or dormitories are too crowded. 
Universities have vigorously implemented policies based on these analyses. They have built new and better recreational facilities and dormitories (Taylor, C. G., 2017); they have hired additional academic advisers and, in many cases, have made round-the-clock tutoring services available to students (Han et al., 2018); and they have hired extra psychologists and substance-abuse specialists (Uddin et al., 2019). Meanwhile, dropout rates are not only climbing but accelerating (Facchini et al., 2019). 
The reason is that dropoutism is not a political or psychological or cultural issue; it is an economic issue. The less a person stands to benefit from a college degree, the more likely he is to drop out. The 
dropout rate for those with SAT’s above the 85th percentile is less than 25%, and the economic and professional benefits to such a person of a college degree are extremely high. The dropout rate for someone with the SAT’s below the 40th percentile is almost 75%, and the benefits of a degree to such a person are minimal. See Figures 12-15. 
Strikingly, philosophy majors are the only humanities majors whose earnings are comparable to those of upper end STEM-majors, and economics majors are the only social science majors to have such earnings. This is consistent with the high IQ of those with degrees in these disciplines. See Figures 15-20.

High IQ students who graduate are overwhelmingly likely to be financially successful and to have rewarding careers. The outcomes for low IQ graduates are very different. If they do not get vocational training, they end up unemployed, intermittently employed at menial jobs, or continuously employed in low-level administrative positions. The less someone stands to gain by staying in college, the more likely he is to drop out. If they do get vocational training and have careers based thereupon, they have moderately high incomes and rewarding careers, but are worse off than IQ-comparable people who skipped college altogether and started their vocational careers earlier. 
Outcomes for low IQ non-graduates are highly polarized. Those who do not get vocational training are much more likely than IQ-comparable graduates without vocational training to be unemployed or turn to crime. Those who do get vocational training are far less likely than IQ-comparable graduates without vocational training to be unemployed and under-employed, and they out-earn such graduates by a wide margin. Job-satisfaction for low-IQ graduates without vocational training is extremely low, and it is extremely high for vocationally trained low IQ graduates and non-graduates. Low IQ graduates vocationally trained graduates earn less than low-IQ vocationally trained non-attendants. Low IQ vocationally trained non-attendants are more likely than IQ-comparable vocationally trained dropouts to earn more $100,000+ annually, and the latter are more likely than IQ-comparable non-vocationally trained graduates to do so. 
In order to understand these results, we must know what low IQ graduates are likely to major in, since this affects how they are likely to be employed. Let us now turn to this matter and to the corresponding body of literature. 
Review of the Literature 
In order to understand the economic prospects of dropouts, we must know what people of a given intelligence-level are likely to major. Fortunately, this information is readily available and does not have to be inferred.

This information makes it possible to identify where low IQ college graduates are likely to be employed. Low IQ graduates are obviously likely to have had low IQ majors, these being Criminal Justice up to Psychology (inclusive). Choosing psychology as the cut-off was not arbitrary, since it is much more internally IQ-differentiated than psychology and since the career-outcomes of business-majors are correspondingly more diverse, economically and otherwise. 
Non-vocationally trained graduates with degrees in low IQ majors who find stable employment are overwhelmingly likely to end up in the following professional areas (Abel et al., 2014 and Nunley et al., 2016): 
*Probation and parole services *Corrections and prison administration *Social work *Elementary school teaching and administration *Flight-attendant and airport ground-attendant *Secretarial *Human resources *Drug-counseling *Convenience store management *Intake-coordination *Customer service *Sales and telemarketing *Military and Coast Guard *Restaurant-management

Averages annual salaries in these professions are approximately $38,000; adjusted for debt, $32,000; adjusted for debt and taxation $19,000. 
Most people with degrees in low IQ majors who do not have jobs falling into one of these categories do not have stable employment. 
Many of the just-mentioned career-paths require credentialing, in some cases a master’s degree, additional to the bachelor’s degree. 
The presence of people from high IQ majors (religious studies and above) in these professions is less than 1%. 
Non-vocationally trained recipients of low-IQ degrees make up less than 1% of all successful (earning at least $20,000/annually) entrepreneurs. 
Literature Review: Vocational Careers 
IQ-comparable people with vocational training, be they graduates or non-graduates, tend to work in the following areas (Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, 2019): 
*General automotive 
*Carpentry 
*Plumbing 
*Nursing 
*Respiratory therapist 
*Electrician 
*Civil Engineering Tech 
*Pharmacy Assistant 
*Dental Assistant 
*Machining 
*Pipe-fitting 
*Phlebotomy. 
*Welding 
*Network administration 
27% of successful entrepreneurs worked in these areas and then became entrepreneurs by becoming self-employed in those same areas (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019). 
Average annual salaries in these areas, not adjusted for debt, are approximately $48,870.

Literature Review: Earnings on the Part of Non-vocationally trained Non-graduates 
The presumption is that those with neither college degrees nor vocational training are in the worst economic position possible. This statistic provide little support for this position. First of all, the probable careers of low IQ graduates overlap to a high degree with those of low IQ non-vocationally trained non-graduates. 70% of employed non-graduates with no vocational certifications, as well as 40% of low IQ graduates, have jobs falling into one of the following categories (Kroeger et al., 2016): 
*Server 
*Cashier 
*Warehouse/factory worker 
*Insurance-sales 
*Custodial 
*Agricultural worker 
*Police Officer/Sheriff’s deputy 
*Military (infantry/non-commissioned officer) 
*Security guard 
*Hotel desk-worker/bellhop 
The average for these positions is $40,877. 
Approximately 15% of low IQ graduates go into education and social workers, and 15% go into various other professions (e.g. lab technician) that either formally or informally require college degrees (Howell et al., 2015). 
SAT/ACT-scores in these professions are on average slightly lower than those in low IQ majors (Hutchinson).

Literature Review: Financial Costs and Benefits of Low IQ Degree 
The lowest IQ majors are social work, education, psychology, criminal justice, and variants thereof. People graduating with degrees in these fields on average have around $25,000 in student-loan debt (Schmeiser et al., 2016). Since work in the corresponding fields often involves getting a master's degree or some other advanced degree, they usually have to take on more debt before they can be employed in those fields (Webber et al., 2017). Consequently, the average amount of student loan debt for licensed social workers is approximately $60,000; for licensed psychologists, $65,000; for schoolteachers, $45,000; probation and parole officers, $32,000 (Bowen, 2018). 
The median monthly amount of payments on student loan debts in these fields are $600, and it takes people employed in these fields an average of 25 years to pay off their student loan debts. This makes sense when it is taken into account that these are interesting bearing loans and also that median annual salaries in these fields just slightly $20,000 (Popescu, 2018). 
Student loan debt for non-attendants with vocational training is $8,000; for dropouts with vocational training, $13,450; and for graduates with vocational training, $31,000. The average amount of time needed to repay student loans for non-attendants with vocational training is two years; for vocationally trained dropouts, four years; and for vocationally trained graduates, 11 years (Odinet, 2019). 
Literature Review: Career Satisfaction 
How fulfilling are careers based on low IQ majors in comparison with careers based on vocational training? There is very little literature, and very few statistics, bearing directly on this question. There is considerable literature and statistical data indirectly bearing on it. 
First of all, there is literature, as well as statistical data, concerning levels of career satisfaction among probation and parole officers, social workers, and the other careers that graduates with low IQ majors tend to end up with. 
This body of literature is sparse and internally contradictory, with some authors saying that career-satisfaction is very low and others saying that it is moderately high, with each school of thought having its own statistics. No definitive conclusions can be drawn from it. 
The higher the average SAT scores at a given college, the lower its dropout rate and the higher the earnings of its graduates. Harvard’s average board scores are in the top 1%; its dropout rate is less than 1%; and annual 
graduate earnings are in the top 1%. The average SAT scores at Fort Valley State are below the 45th percentile for the nation; the dropout rate is over 70%; and annual graduate earnings are below the 45th percentile. Within these 
two extremes, dropout rates and graduate-earnings are strictly ordered according to average student test-score. 
Also, the higher the average test-scores at a given college, the smaller the percentage of students who earn degrees in low IQ majors. In fact, some high IQ majors, notably philosophy, are not even offered at the lower-end schools; and many low IQ majors are not offered at higher-end schools. 
When surveyed, dropouts seldom cite difficulty with coursework as their reason for dropping out. They are more likely to cite financial difficulties, trouble balancing schoolwork with family and personal relationships, homesickness, and inability to focus (Daley, 2010; McDermott et al., 2019). 
The statistics tell a different story. Less than one percent of students with test scores in the 85th percentile and above drop out; more than 95 percent of students with test scores in the 40th percentile and below drop out. Students in the first category take on 250% debt for every year spent in college than do students in the second category, but 80% of students in the first category pay back their student loans within 10 years, whereas only 20% of students in the second category do so (Webber, 2016). A student’s dropout-likelihood is therefore a function not of the size of his financial obligations but of his eventual ability to meet those obligations, and it is therefore a function of the financial benefit to him of a college degree. The greater than benefit, the lower the dropout-likelihood. 
Summary 
The people who stand to lose money by dropping out almost never do, the dropout rate being next to zero for those with test-scores above 85th percentile, these being the people who benefit the most from a college degree. For people in this category, the financial benefits of a college degree are unambiguous. 
For those who do drop out, those benefits are ambiguous. The lower a person’s IQ, the more likely he is to drop out of college, and the greater are the financial benefits to him of vocational work. 
This is not to say that those who drop out are always making the right choice. In many cases, they are not. Although unemployment among vocationally trained non-graduates is lower than that of college graduates, unemployment among non-graduates, on the whole, is more than twice as high. For those in the middle of the bell curve, the situation is objectively ambiguous: they stand to gain as much by staying in college as they do by opting for a vocational career. That said, the more economically rational it is for a given person to drop out, the more likely he is to do so. Dropout-likelihood tracks dropoutF-rationality. 
What is not clear is whether dropout-likelihood tracks dropoutE­
rationality. This is not easily deduced from information about the financial implications of dropping out. It is in principle deducible from other objective data, such as suicide rates, rates of drug abuse, and the like. But, firstly, supposing that low-IQ college graduates had the same rates of suicide, drug use, etc. as vocationally trained IQ-comparables, it wouldn't necessarily follow that they were equally satisfied with their careers. Second, the relevant data simply isn't available. For these reasons, we will ascertain relative degrees of career satisfaction through the use of surveys. 
Chapter 3 Methodology Introduction 
The purpose of this quantitative-correlational study was to determine the causes of dropoutism. This involved finding a principled way of determining the financial and emotional prospects for those dropping out, the reason being people considering dropping out likely make their decision on the basis of at least some kind of awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of doing so. When scrutinized, the statistical data clearly indicates that dropout-likelihood is a direct function of dropoutF-rationality. 
This finding is at odds with the vast majority of scholarly and non-scholarly literature on the matter, the premise of which is that dropping out is a form of failure is therefore a consequence of intellectual, emotional, or financial deficits of some kind (Xiao et al., 2017; Welton et al., 2015; Vasquez et al., 2015; Lavine et al., 1029; Swidey, 2016; Rivera-McCutchen, 2016). A strikingly high percentage of scholarly articles on this matter attribute dropoutism to mental illness (Bishop, 2016), even though the actual data is totally inconsistent with this (Kosyluk et al., 2016). In fact, those who are behaving the most rationally are those who are either maximally likely to drop out or maximally likely not to do so, since in those cases the financial consequences of dropping out are unambiguous; and people at those extremes categorically make the rational decision. The more remote a given student is from those extremes, the less the consequences of dropping out differ from those of not doing so and, consequently, the less obviously rational that person’s decision must necessarily be. 
Researchers and journalists tend to focus on the middle-of-the-road cases and are quick to pounce on even the feeblest indication of pathology on the student’s part. They blame it on depression (Ho et al., 2016), alcoholism (Kiciman et al., 2018), general lack of self-restraint (Nevarez, 2017), and the 
like, even though there is literally no indication that these mid-range dropouts are more depressed or debauched than those who don’t drop out. 
Researchers and journalists are quick to seize upon ‘findings’ on the part of university psychologist to the effect that 40% of college students are “binge drinkers” and that upwards of a third of college students are “seriously depressed” (Sharma et al., 2018). What isn’t reported is that if these figures were correct, then universities would have rates of depression comparable to those of most Federal prisons and alcoholism rates higher than among those who end up there (Holliday et al., 2016). Most importantly, if such a higher percentage of students are mentally ill drug addicts, the first question to ask is whether universities are the right place for them. Finally, we have found that college students are strikingly sane, at least when it comes to deciding whether or not to drop out. Also striking is that those at the lower end of the IQ spectrum are quite as rational in this regard as those at the upper end. 
Prior research has not correctly explained why students drop out or whether they are behaving in a financially rational manner in doing so. Nor, therefore, has it been explained whether they are behaving in an emotionally rational manner. In the pages to come, we will address this issue. 
Statement of the Problem 
Prior to this study, it was not known to what extent people who drop out of college are in doing so behaving in either a financially or emotionally rational manner. We have found that they are behaving in a financially rational manner. This suggests that they are also behaving in an emotionally rational manner. In the pages to come, we will determine whether or not this is in fact the case. 
Enormous resources are expended trying to prevent people from dropping out of college. Given that students tend to be serving their own financial interests by dropping out, those resources should be invested in college-alternative educational and professional tracks, so as to maximize the pay-off for them of leaving college, instead of being used, as they are now, to delegitimate their doing so. Should it turn out that students who choose vocational training over college higher degrees of career satisfaction than IQ-comparable college graduates, then there is that much more reason to reallocate resources in this way. 
Research Questions and Hypotheses 
Our objective in this study is to answer the following question: 
RQ1: To what extent are those who drop out of college behaving rationally in doing so? 
There are two versions of RQ1, namely: 
RQ1F: To what extent are those who drop out of college being 
financially rational in doing so? In other words, to what extent does their doing so lead to increased earnings? 
And: 
RQ1E: To what extent are those who drop out of college being 
emotionally rational in doing so? In other words, to what extent does their doing so lead to increased career-satisfaction? 
We have already answered RQ1F. the answer being: 
HQ1F: On balance, those who drop out of college are to a statistically 
significant degree improving their levels of career satisfaction. Now must now answer RQ1E. There are three answers to this question: 
HQ1ER: Those who drop out of college are thereby doing more to 
increase their level of career-satisfaction than to diminish it. HQ1EN: On balance, those who drop out of college are not thereby 
appreciably increasing or diminishing their levels of career-satisfaction. HQ1EI: Those who drop out of college are thereby doing more to 
diminish their level of career-satisfaction than to increase it. 
For reasons already discussed, we will answer this question on the basis of data generated by surveys that we administer. Whenever we administer a survey to a given group, we must also administer it to the appropriate complement-group. For example, if we were interested in levels of emotional satisfaction among people who drink tomato juice, we would want to survey consumers of tomato-juice as well as non-consumers. In the context of this study, there are several pairs of complement-groups. 
Given that we are comparing dropouts to graduates, we must administer surveys to members of both groups and compare the results. 
Given that a person’s dropout-likelihood is inversely proportional his IQ, the most important comparison to make is between low IQ dropouts and low IQ graduates, and we must administer surveys to both populations and compare the results. 
Given that dropouts with vocational training considerably out-earn dropouts without vocational training, and also out-earn IQ-comparable graduates without vocational training, we must administer surveys to dropout-vocationals and dropout-non-vocationals and compare the results. 
Given that low IQ graduates often receive vocational training and then have careers based on that training, we must administer surveys to members of that group and compare the results with those from surveys administered to low IQ non-graduate vocationals. 
The groups just mentioned are those on whose members a college degree confers relatively little benefit. In order to understand the results of the just-mentioned surveys, we must also administer surveys to high IQ college graduate and then compare the results with those of the above-mentioned surveys. We will also want to administer surveys to high IQ non-graduates. The results will directly help us understand how people with high IQ’s benefit from college, and it may shed indirect light on the benefits, or lack thereof, to other populations. 
The relevant independent variables are therefore (i) IQ, (ii) graduate or non-graduation, and (iii) vocationally trained or not. The independent variable in this case is degree of career-satisfaction. 
The researcher had no choice but to construct his own questionnaire, owing to the fact that no existing questionnaire sufficed for the purposes of this investigation. There exist many time-tested questionnaires that measure satisfaction with one's job, i.e. with one’s current position. But one’s level of satisfaction with one’s career is often very different from one’s level of satisfaction with one’s career. (A given physician can love being a physician but hate his current position.) Nor were any of the many existing life-satisfaction questionnaires usable, since career-satisfaction and life-satisfaction, though linked, are distinct. (A given person can have love his career but have relationship or family-difficulties that leave him unfulfilled.) There exist many questionnaires relating to satisfaction with certain specific career-paths, but these were obviously too narrow for our purposes. Further, it was necessary that our questionnaire not assume that the respondent actually had a career, given that many of the respondents were likely to be unemployed, intermittently employed, or menially employed. So even if there did exist reputable career-satisfaction questionnaires, we might not have been able to use them. Finally, we needed a questionnaire that could be used effectively with each of the following populations: 
* 
Low IQ non-graduates without vocational training, 

* 
Low IQ non-graduates with vocational training 

* 
Low IQ graduates without vocational training 

* 
Low IQ graduates with vocational training, 

* 
High IQ non-graduates without vocational training 

* 
High IQ non-graduates with vocational training 

* 
High IQ graduates without vocational training *High IQ graduates with vocational training This fact imposed significant constraints on the structure of the 


questionnaire to be used. It had to be intelligible to people who varied widely in education-level, intelligence, and profession. It also had to elicit relatively specific information without leading the respondents towards a given answer. No existing questionnaire of the appropriate kind satisfied these constraints, leaving it to the researcher to construct one. 
A professional service was used to administer the survey to people according to custom variables, College Degree Status, Vocational Training Status, SAT/ACT-score, and college-major. Therefore, respondents did not have to answer questions relating to their test-scores or college majors and only had to answer questions relating to career-satisfaction. All questions were required. 
The possible to answers to each question were: 
1=Strongly Disagree 
2=Disagree 
3=Slightly Disagree 
4=Neither Agree Nor Disagree 
5=Slightly Agree 
6=Agree 
7=Strongly Agree 
The answers generated seven-point Likert-scale representing career-satisfaction. 
The minimum sample size was 115 for each of the eight populations surveyed, with a total of 920. 

For the purposes of our G*Power calculations, we operated on the assumption that we were generating a parametric two-tailed Pearson’s correlation. Technically, this is not the case. The variables in our case are, respectively, (a) membership in one of the eight populations in question and 
(b) survey-score. Neither of those variables is continuous, the reason being that, as is the case with any survey-generated correlation, (DiNunno, 2011) both of the variables range over finite sets of integers. That said, this inaccuracy is innocuous when computing sample sizes for surveys, provided that, for computational purposes, the correlation in question is treated as two-tailed Pearson correlation (Nardi, 2019). 
Surveys will be professionally administered online.The survey-service estimated the completion rate to be 76%. Consequently, surveys have to be sent to at least 151 people/target-population, making for a total of 1,208 surveys to be sent, with approximately 850 of them likely to be completed. 
Research Methodology 
The methodology used in this study is quantitative. When determining the economic rationality of dropoutism, we used a relatively strictly statistical method. We found a numerical variable, namely SAT/ACT score, this being a proxy for IQ, that statistically correlated to an extremely high degree (.<.02) with graduation-probability. We then looked at future earnings of both graduates and dropouts. We then correlated IQ with the financial costs and benefits of a college degree. Benefits vary directly with IQ, we found, and costs vary indirectly, and they cancel each other out in the middle range of the IQ spectrum. 
When determining the emotional rationality of dropoutism, our methodology was also quantitative. Having correlated dropout-probability with dropoutF-rationality, it remained only to see whether 
dropoutF-rationality correlated with dropoutE-rationality. Given that dropoutF­
rationality is expressed as a dollar amount and therefore as a single number, it is necessary that dropoutE-rationality also be expressed by a single number if 
it is to be compared with dropoutF-rationality. Prior to this study, dropoutE­
rationality had never even been ascertained, let alone expressed as a single figure, and we ourselves had to figure out (i) how to assign dropoutE­
rationality quotients to people and (ii) whose dropoutE-rationality was what. 
This was readily done. First of all, dropping out is emotionally rational to the extent that doing so makes one more fulfilled than similar people who graduated. Given that the benefits of a college degree reliably correlate with IQ and IQ alone, two people are to be regarded as ‘similar’ just in case they are IQ-comparable. Therefore, for people of a given intelligence level, dropoutE-rationality is hewed to, and may therefore be identified with, the extent to which they are more fulfilled than IQ-comparable graduates. 
Having thus operationally defined ‘dropout-rationality’, we must find a way to correlate degrees of career-satisfaction with graduation-status. Given the veritable absence of career-satisfaction surveys, apart from ones that were extremely demographic-specific, we have no choice but to construct a survey of our own, which we will administer, using a professional survey service, to randomly chosen samples of each of the eight populations in question. (SAT/ACT-scores served as proxies for IQ.) The results are expected to enable us to rank the following the groups by average level of wellness and consequently to rank groups (1), (2), (5) and (6) according to dropoutE­
rationality. 
(i) 
Low IQ non-graduates without vocational training 

(ii) 
High non-graduates without vocational training 


(iii) Low IQ graduates without vocational training 
(iv) 
High IQ non-graduates without vocational training 

(v) 
Low IQ non-graduates with vocational training 

(vi) 
High IQ non-graduates with vocational training 


(vii) High IQ graduates with vocational training 
(viii) High IQ graduates without vocational training 
Research Design 
The methodology used in this phase of the study is both correlational and non-experimental. The study is correlational because we were investigating the dependence of one set of variables (personal and financial fulfillment) on another. An experimental approach is neither possible (given that the variables, e.g. IQ and educational status, were ones that we could not alter) nor necessary (given how many people there are who differ in the relevant respects but are otherwise comparable). 
Eight different groups will be surveyed, and respondents therefore must be pre-screened for test-scores (this being the best available proxy for IQ), college degree, and vocational training. Since IQ, college degree, and vocational training are the independent variables in this study, they must be screened for. Apart from those variables, sampling must be random, so that results are in no way predetermined by selection-bias. 
The minimum sample size for each of the seven groups was 115. Since eight groups were surveyed, the total number surveyed (meaning that they complete a survey) will be 920. Given the predicted response-rate of 76, the number of people to whom surveys will have to be given is 1,208. 
The objective of the surveys is to rank populations in terms of career-satisfaction, where the populations are defined by (i) their average IQ’s, (ii) their either having or not having college degrees and (ii) their either being or not being vocationally trained. Our concern is not ‘absolute’ but rather relative levels of career of satisfaction. Should it turn out that low IQ graduates without vocational training have moderate degrees of career-satisfaction, that would not be as meaningful as it would be should it turn out out that low IQ dropouts with vocational training have high levels of career satisfaction. 
Since the survey uses a seven-point Likert scale, survey results for individuals will expressed in a single number. Results for populations will be averaged, and these averages will be used to generate rankings among the populations surveyed. 
Population and Sample Selection 
There are eight targeted populations: 
(1) 
Low IQ non-graduates without vocational training, 

(2) 
Low IQ non-graduates with vocational training 

(3) 
Low IQ graduates without vocational training 

(4) 
Low IQ graduates with vocational training, 

(5) 
High IQ non-graduates without vocational training 

(6) 
High IQ non-graduates with vocational training 

(7) 
High IQ graduates without vocational training 

(8) 
High IQ graduates with vocational training 


Within the United States, each of these populations is in the millions. The general statistical rule of thumb is that given a population of over 1,000,000, if n% group of 115 randomly chosen members of that population has a given characteristics, then n±5% of the population have that characteristics (Nardi, 2018). For example, given population of 1,000,000, if 115 members of that population are randomly chosen and 75 (65%) of them like chocolate ice-cream, then 65±10% of the original population like chocolate ice-cream. In other words, between 60% and 70% of the original population like chocolate ice-cream. 
But these points only hold when the information that is sought about the population in question can be given with a simple “yes” or “no” (Becker et al., 2016). For example, if the question is "do you prefer to chocolate to vanilla?", then, if 115 randomly chosen members from a population of 1,000,000 are surveyed, there is a 5% error margin. But this error margin may shrink even if sample-size and population-size are held fixed. It shrinks if the answers to the survey questions involve rankings (e.g. “Strongly agree, Agree, Slightly Agree…”) and the answers are bunched around one of the extremes. Suppose the survey question is “how good a job do you feel Senator X is doing?”, and 115 people are randomly chosen, with all political affiliations, economic strata, ethnicities, etc. being evenly represented; and suppose that the respondent has to answer with a number between 1 and 10 (1=completely bad and 10=perfect). If 98% of the answers are 1’s, or if 99% are 10’s, then the error margin drops to under 5% (Hopkins et al., 2018). 
Also relevant is the case where a survey is asking for a ranking, as opposed to a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’, and, moreover, the survey is attempting to elicit that information through multiple different versions of the same query. If answers on individual questionnaires tend to be bunched around one of the extremes and if, moreover, averages of survey-responses in their turn are bunched around extremes, then the error-margin is lowered considerably. Suppose, as before, that we are trying to find out how Senator X’s constituents feel about the job he is doing, except that this time, instead of just asking “is he doing a good job?”, we ask a number of different versions of this question, e.g. “has your financial situation improved since X took office?”, “has the quality of tap water improved?”, “is your neighborhood more safe?”, etc., with the possible answers, as before, being a ranking of 1 through 10, with 1 being maximally bad and 10 being maximally good. Under this circumstance, if answers on a given survey tend to be bunched around one of the extremes and if, moreover, the overwhelming majority of survey-responses are bunched around the same extreme, then the error-margin is much lower than ceteris paribus it would otherwise be (Benjamin et al., 2018). 
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, a 5% error margin may be more than acceptable in some contexts. Here is an example of such a context. The objective of a given survey is to establish a ranking of some kind among different populations. The survey is administered and survey-results are in. It turns out that, even after taking the error-margin into account, those results generate unambiguous ranking. Under these circumstances, the error-margin is of no consequence, even if it is wide in absolute terms. Contrariwise, if the error-margin has to be extremely narrow to establish the ranking in question, then the ranking is that much less worth establishing, since its extremes are that much closer to each other. We have seen how dropoutF-rationality depends on the variables in question; if dropoutE-rationality depends on them 
in a similar way, then wide error-margins can be tolerated. 
Instrumentation 
Since there no pre-existing career-satisfaction questionnaires, we had to come up with our own. That said, we had two sources of support in the existing literature. First, there is an abundance of cogent literature as to what constitutes a ‘dream job’, which is a tolerable synonym for ‘ideal career’ (Li et al., 2016). Second, there were reputable job-satisfaction surveys with questions that, when answered affirmatively, are consistent with the respondent’s having a position that he regards as being a career and a fulfilling one at that (Khamisa et al., 2015). 
The best and most research suggests that a ‘dream job’ for a given person is one that satisfies three conditions: The job-holder is good at it; it is work that he regards as benefiting the world; conditions are supportive and conduce to a ‘state of flow’, including reasonable pay, schedule that fits one’s lifestyle, non-antagonistic co-workers, and the like. 
Importantly, although reasonable pay is necessary for a dream job, satisfaction-returns on pay over and above that amount quickly diminish (Türkoglu et al., 2017; Deeba et al., 2015). This entails that compensation is not what makes a job reasonable: if the person likes the job, he will do it for a reasonable amount; and he doesn’t like it, no amount of money will make it fulfilling for him, even though enough money induce to keep doing it. Another interesting fact is that a job's being a dream-job doesn't depend on its not being stressful. If X is John's dream job, it will continue to be his dream job even it becomes increasingly stressful, provided the stress-levels are not incapacitating; and if X is not John's dream job, decreasing job-related stress, even to the point of non-existence, won't turn X into a dream job. 
In terms of questionnaire-design, the basic desiderata for psychometric tests, such as this one, are as follows (Sijtsma et al., 2017; Nardi, 2018). 
Questions must be clear. “Are you paid enough?” is clear. “Would it not necessarily be so bad if you were better remunerated than you currently are?” is not clear. 
Questions must not be tendentiously phrased. “Do you find your work engaging?” is non-tendentiously and non-judgmentally phrased. “Does your work, despite its menial and insignificant character, manage to interest you?” 
is tendentiously and judgmentally phrased. 
Questions should not be vague or overly theoretical. “Are your clients happy with your work?” is non-vague. “In the long-term, does the economy benefit from your work?” is vague and overly theoretical. 
Questions should not be circuitous. The respondent should not feel that games are being played. “Do you get along with your boss” is direct. “If your boss became a spokesperson for a fast-food chain, would that make you want to stop eating there?” is circuitous and manipulative. 
Also, the questionnaire should not be too long. Otherwise, response rates will decline and answer-quality will deteriorate in those who complete the questionnaire. 
Finally, when information about the respondent’s attitudes is being sought, it is necessary to ask questions relating to different ways in which that attitude might actually guide his thought and behavior. Simply asking “do you like your career?” will not elicit fine-grained information about the respondent’s attitude towards his career and may even elicit a defensive response. Fine-grained and sincere responses are more likely to be elicited by questions such as the following: 
“Do you regard difficult assignments as inconveniences or as challenges?” 
“Do you find yourself thinking about how to improve your professional skills even when you are not on the job?” 
“Do you tend to throw yourself into your work when you have personal problems?” 
“Do you work even when don’t have to?” 
The researcher constructed a test satisfying these desiderata. Also, the test is sufficiently similar to proven and reputable job-satisfaction questionnaires as to minimize the risk of its failing of its purpose, while also, unlike existing questionnaires, eliciting information specific to the respondent’s level of career-satisfaction (as opposed to job-satisfaction). 
Validity 
Validity is being ensured in the following ways. 
First, a reputable professional survey-service has already been retained to administer the survey to the eight demographics in question. This service provides automated, reliable analytics and always complies with legal and professional protocols. 
Second, questions are clearly and modeled on those of reputable questionnaires, within the limits set by the differences in subject-matter. Also, the survey company has a grading system whereby survey-efficacy is assessed before the survey is administered; and this surveyed a score of 100%. 
Third, questions will initially administered to small samples, and then scaled up when results from initial surveys show that error margins were unlikely to vitiate results. Tight, demographically-driven clusterings of responses diminish error-margins and warrant upscaling; and the absence of such clusterings warrant changing the survey, so as to increase confidence-intervals, before re-administering. 
Finally, we only need error-margins to be as narrow as was consistent with their establishing unambiguous rankings. The fact that one of the variables is discontinuous made any other standard of precision irrelevant. Therefore, once initial surveys established that error-margins are narrow enough to yield an unambiguous ranking, we will be free to administer the survey to a large population. 
Reliability 
The survey consists of 20 questions. Four of the questions are concerned with the respondent’s perception of his own abilities at his work. Four are concerned with his feelings as to his level of enthusiasm for his work. Four concern his beliefs as to how much good for the world he believes himself to do. Four concern his beliefs as to whether he is adequately compensated. Four concern his beliefs as to whether his clients, co-workers, and supervisors adequately appreciate his work. No two questions within any given one of these five question-groups are identical, but answers to questions within a given group should elicit similar responses. Consequently, consistency of responses within groups indicates a high-degree of reliability and validity, and low consistency indicates low degree of reliability and validity. 
The survey-company software approved the survey for clarity and ease of use and probable high (76%) completion of rate. At the researcher’s request (and expense), a manual review of the questions was conducted, in light of information concerning the nature of the research being conducted. No changes were recommended. 
Data Collection and Management 
The survey-service will prescreen for the relevant variables (test-score, college graduation, vocationally trained). Respondents will not be prescreened for income, since surveys must be distributed randomly within each population group. Potential respondents will be sent an email with a link to the survey. 
The email contains a description of the survey, the number of questions, and the nature of those questions. It is stated that the questions were multiple choice. It is also stated that no information would ever be publicized concerning an individual respondent’s answers. It is made clear that the survey had no relation to their work or any aspect of their life and that their responses, or decision not to do or to complete the survey, will have no effect on any aspect of their lives. It is also stated that survey results would be kept for a minimum of three years. The purpose of the survey is also stated, along with the disclaimer that this is research being conducted by a doctoral candidate and is not an official government action of any kind. The identity of the researcher is not disclosed, nor is any other identifying information. 
No ‘frill material’ is included. Itis not said that responses would ‘enrich scholarship’ or anything of the sort. It is not suggested or stated that negative consequences will follow from non-responses or certain kinds of responses or that good consequences will follow from completed surveys or from certain kinds of responses. The tone is neutral and no imagery or suggestive fonts, italicizations, capitalizations, colorings, or other iconographies are used. 
If email recipients click on the link, they are taken to page where this information is repeated and where they are presented with two boxes: I CONSENT and I DO NOT CONSENT. If they click on the first box, they are taken to the survey proper. 
Data Analysis Procedures 
Our research question is: 
RQ1E: To what extent are those who drop out of college being 
emotionally rational in doing so? In other words, to what extent does their doing so lead to increased career-satisfaction? 
In order to answer RQ1, we first had to answer: 
RQ2: Who drops out of college? In other words, what characteristics are dispositive of a person’s dropping out of college? (Is it poverty, mental illness, physical illness, unstable home life, low IQ, etc.?) 
We found the answer to be: 
HQ2: The higher a given person’s IQ, the less likely he is to drop out of college. 
In the course of generating HQ2, we discovered that: 
HQ1F: The higher a given person’s IQ, the less financially rational it is 
for him to drop out of college. This established the following earnings-ranking (from bottom to top): 
(1) 
Low IQ, non-vocationally trained non-graduates 

(2) 
High IQ non-vocationally trained non-graduates 

(3) 
Low IQ, non-vocationally trained graduates 

(4) 
Low IQ vocationally trained graduates 

(5) 
Low IQ vocationally trained non-graduates 

(6) 
High IQ vocationally trained non-graduates 

(7) 
High IQ vocationally trained graduates 

(8) 
High IQ non-vocationally trained graduates 


The need to discover whether career-satisfaction generated a similar hierarchy governed our data-analysis procedures. Questionnaires pre-screen for the dependence variables (test-scores, graduation-status, vocational-status). The survey-software will be set to do the following: 
(i) 
Provide data for each respondent 

(ii) 
Find average value for each question for each target-population 


(iii) Average these averages by population, as to generate an overall career-satisfaction score for each population. 
We are operating on the assumption that answers are up to 10% inaccurate, even though that actual error-margin is less than 5%. 
Ethical Considerations 
We will administer surveys by way of a reputable company that will not spam anyone, invade their privacy, offer incentives, or otherwise violate the rights of respondents or skew responses. The questions are phrased in such a way that respondents will know that their responses, whatsoever they might be, are genuinely valued. 
Limitations and Delimitations 
The results generated will not have validity across any society at all times or across all societies at a given time. This study is not intended to establish universally applicable sociological principles. It would be important to know how existing economic conditions and government policies affected the realities discussed in this study. 
Another limitation is that this study does not examine the internal structure of any of the populations involved. For example, the population of high IQ non-vocationally trained college graduates is internally stratified, with some of its member loving their careers and others hating them, and it would be worth how it was stratified and why. The same is true of each of the sub-populations. 
Finally, it would be worth seeing if the results we obtain, whatever they might be, hold up when larger populations are concerned. 
Summary 
In the first two chapters, we discovered extremely tight connections between IQ and both dropout-rate and dropout-rationality. With those in the upper IQ range, a college degree was more significant than vocational training. With those in all IQ ranges, dropout-behavior tracked dropout-rationality. It is unambiguously rational for those in the very low IQ range to drop out and that is they do. It is unambiguously rational for people in the upper IQ range to graduate from college, and that what they do. It is ambiguously rational for those in the lower-medium range to drop out, and that is what half of them do. 
Given this information, the question to ask is whether the degree to which is emotionally rational to drop out, in the sense of being conducive to career-satisfaction, tracks the degree to which it is financially rationally to do so. We figured out how to answer this question. Having already discovered that IQ, college-graduation status, and vocational status generated an earnings hierarchy, we simply had to find out whether they also generated a career-satisfaction hierarchy. 
Because there did not exist any statistics that explicitly or implicitly answered this question, we have to generate those statistics ourselves. Because there do not exist any questionnaires that we could use, we had to design our own questionnaire; and we did so, taking care to model it, as closely as its distinctive subject-matter allowed, on existing questionnaires. Because we designed our own questionnaire, we had to make sure that it covered the relevant variables, and we also had to see to it that it generated credible information. This was labor intensive but well worth it.

Is the Turing Test a good test of intelligence? (philosophy) 
The statement ‘the Turing Test is a good test of intelligence’ is ambiguous. On the one hand, it can be taken to mean that a given entity’s acting like an intelligent being is evidence of its having intelligence, meaning that such behavior is good but not definitive reason to ascribe intelligence to the being in question. On the other hand, it can be taken to mean a given entity’s acting like an intelligent creature is constitutive of its having intelligence, meaning that there is no difference between its being intelligent and its behaving (or able to behave) like an intelligent creature. The first disambiguation, so I will argue, is correct only if subject to heavy qualifications, and the second disambiguation, so I will argue, is unqualifiedly incorrect. 
Turing introduced the concept of the Turing Test through the following hypothetical. A written but rapid exchange between two parties is occurring. One of those parties is a machine, and the other is a person. A second person is monitoring the exchange. This person knows that one of the parties involved is a person and that the other is a machine, and he also knows what each party writes and when it writes it, but he has no additional information as to either one’s identity. According to Turing, if this person is consistently able to figure out which of the two parties is the machine and which one is the person, then the machine does not have intelligence. On the other hand, if that person cannot consistently determine which of the parties is the machine, then that machine has intelligence. 
We can use a variant of Turing’s own scenario to demonstrate the spuriousness of Turing’s own reasoning. Let X be the person involved in the exchange just described and let Y be the machine; and suppose that the exchange they are having concerns arithmetic. X is making arithmetical statements (e.g. “1+1=2”, “1+2=3”, “1+2.3”), and Y is evaluating those statements. If X says “23=8”, Y responds by saying “that is correct”; and if X says “23=6”, Y responds by saying “that is incorrect.” As it happens, let us suppose, X, though an extremely gifted playwright and poet, has a blind spot for mathematics. He cannot for the life of him understand why “23=6” is false or why “23=8” is true. Consequently, when ‘conversing’ with Y, the statements that he makes are often false. But he never generates those statements mechanically. In some cases, he draws on poetic inspiration; in other cases, he considers the aesthetic properties of the inscriptions involved; sometimes he grasps the mathematical principles but misapplies them; and occasionally he grasps those principles and correctly applies them. In each 
case, a great of intelligence is involved, but it is usually either the wrong kind of intelligence or the right kind of intelligence but applied in the wrong way. 
Turing would have us believe that, in this exchange, Y is the intelligent one and X is the unintelligent one. But that is the exact opposite of the truth. The reason X is so often wrong is that he is thinking too much, albeit the wrong ways; and the reason Y is always right is that its behavior is completely reflexive, with the qualification that, thanks to the intelligence of Y’s creator, the reflexes in question track the relevant body of truths. What makes a creature intelligent is not what it does, contrary to what Turing assumes, but why it does it. In some contexts, intelligence leads to the wrong behaviors and its absence leads to the right ones. To be sure, intelligence is more likely than its absence to generate the right behaviors (including the right statements). But given a sufficiently constricted context, an unintelligent or minimally intelligent being can outperform one that is hyper-intelligent: someone with little mathematical intelligence can be trained to produce sums and products faster than Gauss could and will therefore do a better job of passing the corresponding Turing Tests. In certain contexts, certain behaviors are relatively likely to be engaged in only by intelligent creatures, and certain behaviors may therefore be relatively good evidence of intelligence; but there is no single form of conduct engaged in by intelligent beings that cannot be mimicked by unintelligent ones, and for this reason intelligence is never identical with a tendency to engage in a certain kind of overt behavior in a certain kind of context. So yes—Turing Tests are sometimes good tests of intelligence, but only in the sense that they may provide reasonable strong evidence of intelligence, not in the sense they provide definitive proof of it. 
Like us, John Searle holds that overt behavior is nothing more than evidence of intelligence, and he therefore rejects Turing’s contention to the contrary. Unfortunately, Searle’s defense of his own position is a failure and actually gives undeserved credence to Turing’s position. Searle asks to suppose that, inside of a giant robot (or robot-like carapace), there lives a man who speaks no Chinese but who has access to Chinese dictionaries and pronunciation manuals, and the like. Despite not speaking a word of Chinese himself, this man has become extremely adept at using these resources to generate decrypt Chinese statements and respond to them with content-appropriate Chinese utterances of his own, which are electronically broadcast in a metallic voice to the external world, making it seem to those in the external world that there exists a Chinese-speaking robot. According to Searle, a consequence of Turing’s position is that there really does exist a Chinese-speaking robot; and Searle takes it for granted that those who hold this are simply wrong. 
The problem is that the behavior of this ‘robot’ (i.e. the metallic husk with the man inside it) is intelligent. After all, the sounds that it produces are guided by an understanding of what linguistic symbols mean and of what those meanings make it appropriate to say, and those who believe the ‘robot’ to be intelligent are not entirely off the mark. True—those people are very wrong as to the mechanisms involved. They believe electrical circuity, as opposed to biological wetware, to be doing all the work. But they are right about intelligence being responsible for the robot’s behavior. What about their belief that the robot speaks Chinese? Searle takes it for granted that this belief is false. But is it? There is somebody inside the metallic husk who is intelligently mapping English statements onto Chinese statements and vice versa, and this person’s behavior is responsible for the noises leaving the robot-husk. The essence of a given person’s supposedly mistaken belief that the ‘the robot’ speaks Chinese is the correct belief the sounds that come out of the robot are intelligent, as opposed to mechanical, responses to the sounds that are directed at it. 
In conclusion, although a tendency to engage in certain forms of behavior in certain contexts can obviously be evidence of intelligence, such a disposition cannot itself be identical with intelligence, the reason being that any behavior that an intelligent creature is likely to engage in can be replicated by an unintelligent creature. Consequently, if Turing’s position is taken to be that overt behavior can be evidence of intelligence, then it is correct but trivial, and if it is taken to be that overt behavior can itself be intelligence, then it is simply false. Though motivated by an awareness of these truths, John Searle’s miscarried attempt to refute Turing ends up giving the latter’s an undeserved sheen of legitimacy. 
Is the Turing Test a good test of intelligence? Second Version (philosophy) 
To say that a given entity ‘passes the Turing Test’ is to say that, in some context or other, its behavior is indistinguishable from that of a being whose conduct is guided by intelligence. Turing believed, for reasons to be identified forthwith, that there is no difference between acting like an intelligent entity and being an intelligent being. Turing’s answer to the question ‘is the Turing Test a good test of intelligence?’ is therefore ‘yes.’ 
In this paper, Turing’s position will be examined and refuted. I will start by examining the hypothetical scenario through Turing himself attempts to motivate what he believes the answer to this question to be, and I will use a variant of that same scenario to show that Turing’s reasoning is spurious and, moreover, that his position is false. Then I will examine John Searle’s attempt to refute Turing’s position. It will be shown that, although Searle is right to regard Turing’s position as false, Searle’s attempt to refute Turing’s position has little force. 
Turing introduced the concept of the Turing Test through the following hypothetical. A written but rapid exchange between two parties is occurring. One of those parties is a machine, and the other is a person. A second person is monitoring the exchange. This person knows that one of the parties involved is a person and that the other is a machine, and he also knows what each party writes and when it writes it, but he has no additional information as to either one’s identity. According to Turing, if this person is consistently able to figure out which of the two parties is the machine and which one is the person, then the machine does not have intelligence. On the other hand, if that person cannot consistently determine which of the parties is the machine, then that machine has intelligence. 
We can use a variant of Turing’s own scenario to demonstrate the spuriousness of Turing’s own reasoning. Let X be the person involved in the exchange just described and let Y be the machine; and suppose that the exchange they are having concerns arithmetic. X is making arithmetical statements (e.g. “1+1=2”, “1+2=3”, “1+2.3”), and Y is evaluating those statements. If X says “23=8”, Y responds by saying “that is correct”; and if X says “23=6”, Y responds by saying “that is incorrect.” As it happens, let us suppose, X, though an extremely gifted playwright and poet, tends to overthink trivial matters and therefore has trouble producing correct statements of arithmetic. Consequently, when ‘conversing’ with Y, the statements that he makes are often false. But he never generates those statements mechanically. 
Turing would have us believe that, in this exchange, Y is the intelligent one and X is the unintelligent one. But that is the exact opposite of the truth. The reason X is so often wrong is (so we may suppose) that he is thinking too much, albeit the wrong ways; and the reason Y is always right is that its behavior is completely reflexive, with the qualification that, thanks to the intelligence of Y’s creator, the reflexes in question track the relevant body of truths. What makes a creature intelligent is not what it does, contrary to what Turing assumes, but why it does it. In some contexts, intelligence leads to the wrong behaviors and its absence leads to the right ones. Given a sufficiently constricted context, an unintelligent or minimally intelligent being can outperform one that is hyper-intelligent: someone with little mathematical intelligence can be trained to produce sums and products faster than Gauss could and will therefore do a better job of passing the corresponding Turing Tests. There is no single form of conduct engaged in by intelligent beings that cannot be mimicked by unintelligent ones, and for this reason intelligence is never identical with a tendency to engage in a certain kind of overt behavior in a certain kind of context. So a given Turing Test provides, at most, highly defeasible, context-internal evidence of intelligence, and under no circumstances can a given creature’s passing such a test be regarded as definitive proof of intelligence; and the Turing Test is therefore not in any significant sense a good test of intelligence. 
Like us, John Searle holds that overt behavior is nothing more than evidence of intelligence, and he therefore rejects Turing’s contention to the contrary. Unfortunately, Searle’s defense of his own position is a failure and actually gives undeserved credence to Turing’s position. Searle asks to suppose that, inside of a giant robot (or robot-like carapace), there lives a man who speaks no Chinese but who has access to Chinese dictionaries and pronunciation manuals, and the like.

The problem is that the behavior of this ‘robot’ (i.e. the metallic husk with the man inside it) is intelligent. After all, the sounds that it produces are guided by an understanding of what linguistic symbols mean and of what those meanings make it appropriate to say, and those who believe the ‘robot’ to be intelligent are not entirely off the mark. Although these people are wrong about the specific mechanisms involved, they are right about intelligence being responsible for the robot’s behavior. What about their belief that the robot speaks Chinese? Searle takes it for granted that this belief is false. But is it? There is somebody inside the metallic husk who is intelligently mapping English statements onto Chinese statements and vice versa, and this person’s behavior is responsible for the noises leaving the robot-husk. The essence of a given person’s supposedly mistaken belief that the ‘the robot’ speaks Chinese is the correct belief the sounds that come out of the robot are intelligent, as opposed to mechanical, responses to the sounds that are directed at it. 
In conclusion, although a tendency to engage to engage in certain forms of behavior in certain contexts can obviously be evidence of intelligence, such a disposition cannot itself be identical with intelligence, the reason being that any behavior that an intelligent creature is likely to engage in can be replicated by an unintelligent creature. Consequently, if Turing’s position is taken to be that overt behavior can be evidence of intelligence, then it is correct but trivial, and if it is taken to be that overt behavior can itself be intelligence, then it is simply false. Though motivated by an awareness of these truths, John Searle’s miscarried attempt to refute Turing ends up giving the latter’s an undeserved sheen of legitimacy. 
Should Caffeine be a Controlled Substance? 
Abstract 
Average daily caffeine intake among pre-adults in the United States has increased more than 100% in the last twenty years, from 30 mg/day to 70 mg/day, almost entirely due to the popularity, especially among children, of candy-flavored, highly caffeinated energy-drinks, such as Rock Star and Monster. This development is a concern for many reasons. First, caffeine is a psychoactive substance, like alcohol or marijuana, and for that reason alone, so it is felt, is not appropriate for children. Second, there is reasonably compelling that caffeine use among children is linked to temporary episodes of ADHD-like behavior. Most ominously, there have been recent studies on rats showing that massive daily doses of caffeine can impair brain-development. For these reasons, the question arises whether the selling of energy-drinks or other caffeinated substances should be criminalized or otherwise heavily regulated. The answer to that question, so it is argued in this paper, is “no.” There is no demonstrated evidence that, when consumed in moderate doses, caffeine has any effect on brain development in humans, and there is in fact evidence that, in low doses, it has neuro-regenerative and neuro-protective qualities. Second, although there is reasonably good evidence that caffeine-intake in children can temporarily cause ADHD-like symptoms, such as distractedness and fidgeting, there is no evidence that it ever leads to antisocial or violent behavior. Third, granting that children should not in general be allowed to use psychoactive substances to recreate or self-medicate, there is no evidence that caffeine has become a gateway drug for children, or that caffeine use among children is dangerously high, or that such caffeine use as there is has to any degree impaired the psychological or physical development of children or adolescents. Also, because caffeine is the active ingredient in a number of over the counter medications, including all medications for PMS and Migraine headaches, and because caffeine naturally occurs in high doses in many comestibles, including chocolate, caffeine-related regulations would be unusually burdensome to businesses and expensive for the general public. Consequently, the benefits of caffeine-related regulations, including regulations relating to the sale of energy drinks, would be far too small to justify the considerable financial and societal costs. 
Introduction 
Caffeine is the most widely used psychoactive substance in existence. For the most part, caffeine is harmless, and there is growing evidence of the health benefits of moderate caffeine consumption, especially on cognitive performance (Brice, 2016). At the same time, caffeine is not entirely innocuous. It is toxic when consumed in large doses. Also, studies have shown that proper brain development does not occur in rats that are fed astronomically high quantities of caffeine over a long period, suggesting, albeit weakly, that moderate consumption of caffeine could inhibit proper brain development in human children (Doepker et al., 2016). Additionally, although low quantities of caffeine actually have a calming effect in children, there is reasonably strong evidence that it can induce temporary ADHD-like symptoms when consumed in large quantities (França, A. P., 2018). This last fact is significant, owing to the fact that caffeine consumption among children and adolescents more than doubled over the last thirty years. The reason for this spike is the popularity among children and adolescents of highly caffeinated energy drinks, such as Rock Star and Monster. Loaded with sugar, these carbonated beverages are as easy to guzzle down as any soft-drink, making them popular with people of all ages, and they have a candy-like taste, making them especially popular with children (Chen et al., 2019). 
What should the government’s response be? Should the government take a completely hand’s off approach and do nothing to restrict the sale of caffeine, even to minors? Or should it intervene and criminalize or at least penalize the sale of caffeinated products to minors and possibly other vulnerable groups? 
It is the purpose of this paper to answer this question. After considering all of the relevant facts, we will come to the conclusion that, although parents should be mindful of possible caffeine use on the part of their children, the sale and use of caffeine should not be any more regulated than they currently are. Although caffeine can be abused, the benefits of treating caffeine as a controlled substance, even in a highly circumscribed manner, would not be worth the costs. 
The structure of this paper is as follows. We will start by identifying the relevant statistical and economic data relating to caffeine-use. Then we will discuss the effects of caffeine on both children and adults. We will discuss its various benefits, including its medicinal uses, and we will also discuss the adverse effects that it can have, especially when consumed in large doses. We will then discuss the financial and logistical complexities involved in regulating the sale and use of caffeine, many of which derive from the fact that caffeine is present not just in coffee, but also in tea, soft-drinks, and chocolate, as well as in numerous over the counter medications, including Excedrin and Midol. We will conclude by synthesizing all of this data, our conclusion being that the sale and use of caffeine should be unregulated or minimally regulated. 
Important Facts and Statistics Relating to Caffeine-use 
Caffeine is the most widely used psychoactive substance in existence. In the United States, for example, approximately 450 million cups of coffee are consumed every day (Baron, 2019). In other countries, coffee consumption is much higher. For every three cups of coffee consumed by the average American, the average German consumes five, the average Slovenian six, the average Norwegian seven, and the average Finn nine (Baron, 2019. 
Importantly, coffee-drinking, though the primary way of ingesting caffeine, is not the only way of doing so. High concentrations of caffeine are present in tea and moderate concentrations are present in soft-drinks and in chocolate. Caffeine can also be consumed ‘directly’, in the form of caffeine pills, such as Vivarin and NoDoz. Also, caffeine is the primary active ingredient in so-called ‘energy drinks’, such as Red Bull and Rock Star, which, non-coincidentally, are also loaded with sugar, giving them a candy-like taste, and are increasingly popular with adolescents and, to a lesser extent, children. Coffee-drinking accounts for 70% of caffeine-consumption; tea, chocolate, and soft-drinks, including energy drinks, for 28%; and caffeine pills, for 2% (Brice, 2016). 
Unlike opiates, tobacco, alcohol, and almost all other controlled substances, caffeine naturally occurs in many foods and beverages. Moderate to high levels of it are present in chocolate, colas, sunflower seeds, and various other staples; and it is therefore present, sometimes in high quantities, in foods that contain these ingredients, including ice-cream, trail mixes, and health bars (Brice, 2016). 
Importantly, caffeine is the active ingredient in many different over the counter (OTC) medications. It is the active ingredient in Excedrin, Anacin, and every other OTC remedy for migraines, and it is the active ingredient in Midol, Pamprin and every other OTC remedy for premenstrual syndrome. Consequently, restricting the sale of caffeine to minors would involve restricting the sale of all such items to minors. Though theoretically possible, this would be expensive, with the costs being passed onto to consumers, taxpayers, and businesses; and it would also lead to irksome expansions of regulatory bureaucracies. In order to know whether these costs would be worth bearing, we must know how caffeine affects people, in both the short and long terms (França et al., 2018). Let us now turn to this topic. 
Health-benefits of Caffeine 
First of all, caffeine increases cognitive performance. Studies have shown that people do better on standardized tests when they are under the influence of caffeine (Grosso et al. 2017). Studies have also shown that caffeine boosts manual dexterity and, in particular, that physicians performing surgery, including microsurgery, perform better when they are under the influence of caffeine (Spiller, 2019). This is obviously linked with the fact that almost all surgical operations are performed by physicians under the influence of caffeine. This is true even of physicians belonging to religious faiths, such as Mormonism, that prohibit the use of caffeine (Kelly et al., 2016). 
There also appear to be long-term health-benefits to caffeine use. Several studies have shown that caffeine use correlates with improved long­term memory. Studies also show an inverse correlation between heavy caffeine-consumption and likelihood of succumbing to Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia. Strikingly, studies show much the same to be true of Parkinson’s Disease (PD): “26 studies found that the overall risk of developing PD fell by 24-32% per 300 mg increase in caffeine intake (i.e. with every 3 cups of coffee, approximately)” (Spiller, 2019). There is also evidence that coffee-consumption reduces the likelihood of developing certain kinds of cancer, including oral cancer and colon cancer (Endesfelder et al., 2017). This is likely a consequence not of caffeine but of the antioxidants in coffee. 
Adverse Health-effects of Caffeine 
Caffeine can also have adverse health-effects. Here it is important to note that the effects of caffeine on adults differ in some respects from its effects on children and adolescents. In adults, the adverse effects of caffeine tend to be short-term, the most common ones being insomnia and irritability. Caffeine-intake also temporarily increases heartrate and blood pressure, but these effects subside within a few hours. Contrary to what used to be thought, caffeine does not cause arrhythmia or coronary heart disease; nor does it otherwise adversely affect cardiovascular health. In adults, the main reason not to consume caffeine is that it can cause insomnia, which in turn can have serious effects on quality of life. Also, people with mental illnesses, such as schizoaffective disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, often have adverse emotional responses to caffeine (Doepker et al., 2016). 
The effects of caffeine on children and adolescents are not entirely clear, but there is evidence that it can slow down brain development if consumed in large quantities on a consistent basis. Significantly, this conclusion is based on experiments involving rats; it is not based on direct evidence, such as the performance-metrics of children known to consume caffeine regularly. Moreover, the rats in question were given astronomically high quantities of caffeine (the equivalent, after adjusting for their body-mass, of 100 cups of coffee) every day of their pre-adult lives. Finally, because those rats experienced acute sleep deprivation, it is possible that their slow brain development was a consequence of their lack of sleep, not, except indirectly, of their caffeine intake (Kolahdouzan et al. 2017). Nonetheless, the study unambiguously showed that caffeine use in some way or other retarded brain development in rats, and the similarities between rat brains and human brains make it extremely likely that, if consumed in large enough quantities over a long enough period of time, caffeine can slow down brain development in humans (Mohan et al., 2015). 
This last point is subject to some important qualifications. First of all, when administered to rats in moderate doses, caffeine actually offset the damage done by brain-injuries and, in cases when the brain-injured rats were still developing, permitted the resumption of normal brain-development. Something analogous seems to hold of human beings, in that persons who take caffeine pills during a stroke minimize the brain-damage subsequently done by that stroke. Finally, studies have shown that caffeine helps offset the damage done to neonatal rats by instances of hypoxia (Meeusen et al., 2018). 
Importantly, when taken in low to moderate doses, caffeine actually has a calming effect on children. This is why it is often prescribed by physicians to children who have ADHD, the standard daily dose being 200 mg to 400 mg. When children do not have ADHD, 300 mg or more of caffeine may temporarily cause ADHD-like symptoms, mainly fidgeting and increased anxiety. It is extremely unusual for pre-adolescents to consume this much caffeine and there are no reported cases of caffeine consumption in children leading to anti-social or self-destructive behavior or of their having any adverse health-consequences (Meeusen et al., 2018). 
For ethical reasons, there have been few studies of how caffeine affects the cognitive abilities of children or adolescents. The only studies that have been conducted concern children with ADHD who have been prescribed caffeine by a licensed physician. Those studies show that caffeine improves test-scores in children with ADHD and also improves manual dexterity. It is not clear whether the same would be true of children who do not have ADHD; nor is it otherwise clear whether those results in any way generalize to other populations. That said, there have been studies of how caffeine affects cognitive performance in college students and other populations, and those studies all show that it enhances cognitive performance (Schmidt, 2017). 
As a general rule, caffeine temporarily increases blood-pressure and heartrate, granting that, when taken in low to moderate doses, it tends to have the opposite effect on children, especially children with ADHD. For this reason, people are inclined to suspect that caffeine-use increases the likelihood of stroke and heart-attack. This has been thoroughly studied and proven to be totally false. Setting aside people with heart-conditions, even high doses of caffeine do not increase the likelihood of heart-attack or stroke. The effects of high doses of caffeine on those with coronary conditions have not been thoroughly studied. There have been no documented cases of caffeine consumption causing a cardiac incident, even in people with coronary conditions; but because caffeine is a stimulant whose effects on such people have not been studied, physicians recommend that they moderate or eliminate their use of caffeine (Spiller, 2019). 
Pros and Cons of Caffeine-regulation 
Granting that the long-term effects on children of heavy caffeine use are still unclear, their short-term effects are moderately well-known and are sometimes negative. Whereas adults respond to moderate amounts of caffeine by becoming focused, children sometimes respond by becoming confused and agitated. Caffeine makes it easy for an adult to get through a boring meeting, but it can make it hard for a child or even an adolescent to get through a boring class. (This is subject to the qualification that it helps children with ADHD to focus and behave properly.) 
This is significant because, over the last twenty years, caffeine use among pre-adults has risen from an average of 30 mg/day to 70 mg/day. Almost all of this extra caffeine comes from carbonated, candy-flavored, and highly caffeinated so-called ‘energy drinks’, such as Red Bull, Monster, and Rock Star. A single ‘Red Bull’ or ‘Rock Star’ contains around 200 mg of caffeine—the same as a strong cup of coffee. But these beverages, unlike coffee, are palatable to children; and unlike coffee, they go down smooth and can easily be guzzled down. And this is just what is happening, especially with adolescents and pre-adolescents. Currently, there are no laws preventing children from purchasing energy drinks, and it must therefore be asked whether such laws should be introduced (Spiller, 2019). 
In the present author’s judgment, the answer to this question is ‘no.’ First of all, we must distinguish the question ‘should children drink caffeinated beverages?’ from the question ‘should the sale of caffeinated beverages to children be criminalized?’ Children shouldn’t spend hours watching TV; but if they do, neither they nor their guardians should be fined or jailed for it. When asking whether such and such should be illegal, it is not enough to know whether X is morally good. It must also be taken into account whether the cure would be worse than the disease. Laws are expensive; people have to be paid to enforce them; and before we decide to criminalize such and such, we must be sure that the financial costs of doing so do not outweigh the benefits (Friedman, 1962). 
We must also know that, in criminalizing such and such, we are not thereby criminalizing things that shouldn’t be criminalized. It’s well and good to prohibit minors from purchasing energy drinks and caffeine pills. But what if the minor is a 17-year-old who is suffering an acute migraine and needs Excedrin? What if the minor is a 14-year-old female who is suffering from wrenching pains due to PMS and needs Midol? In terms of its caffeine-content, a single dose of Midol or Excedrin is comparable to the average energy drink. (A single Excedrin has 65 mg of caffeine; a single Midol has 60 mg., the recommended dosage of each being two to four pills daily.) 
Of course, one option would be to be to allow minors to purchase caffeinated medications but prohibit them from purchasing energy drinks or other caffeinated non-medicinal items. This seems reasonable at first, but it starts to seem less reasonable when financial realities are considered. This law cannot be enforced unless police officers and prosecutors are given special training and then dedicate at least some of their time to investigating and prosecuting allege offenders. Either the public defrays these costs, in which case it has that much less money to invest in education and business and the like, or it doesn’t, in which case police and prosecutors have one more law to enforce but no extra money with which to enforce it, the inevitable result being that they cease to enforce some other law. This does not mean that it would necessarily be wrong to enact the law in question, but it means that before deciding to do so, we must know what we are gaining and what we are losing (Friedman 1962). 
The gains would be modest. Fatal caffeine overdoses are extremely rare. In order to die from a caffeine overdose, it is necessary to ingest over 5 grams of caffeine within a few seconds. This can be done, but only by ingesting caffeine pills or powder; it cannot be done by drinking caffeinated liquid, since the caffeine being ingested is metabolized before it can reach fatal levels (Turnbull et al., 2017). 
What about the effects of caffeine on brain development? Do they not warrant banning the sale of energy drinks to youths? They do not. The rats in the studies in question were given 300 mg of caffeine every day of their lives until they reached adulthood. The average rat weighs under 10 oz; the average person weights around 175 lbs. or 2800 oz. This means that these rats were given the equivalent of 84000 mg of caffeine every single day of their pre-adult lives. The average American middle-schooler, by contrast, consumes 70 mg of caffeine, making it unclear whether that experiment has any bearing at all on the effects of caffeine on human brain development (Winerdal et al., 2017). 
What about the ADHD-like symptoms that caffeine elicits from pre­adolescents? Do they not demand that we criminalize the sale of energy drinks to minors? No. Children obviously shouldn’t consume energy drinks; but that doesn’t mean that we should criminalize their doing so. Children do not respond to caffeine by becoming violent or otherwise ‘acting out.’ Their responses are internal: anxiety, restlessness, irritability, and the like. These emotional changes may lead to expressions of discomfort, such as fidgeting and squirming, but there are no documented cases of their leading to violent or confrontational behavior (Brice, 2016). 
The most serious consequence for children of caffeine-consumption is difficulty sleeping. Sleep-deprivation, especially in children, is a serious matter. But, first of all, there are no documented cases of children suffering from chronic insomnia as a result of caffeine consumption, and even if there were, the right response would not be to criminalize their behavior. Setting aside cases of violent or excessively disruptive behavior, substandard behavior on the part of children can and should be dealt with by parents and teachers, through instruction and discipline. If we try to solve non-criminal problems by criminalizing them, we will only create worse problems (Friedman, 1962). 
Conclusion 
There is no evidence that caffeine consumption among adults does them harm, and there is considerable evidence that it does good. There are studies that show that daily mega-doses of caffeine impair brain development in rats; but the doses given, when adjusted for weight, were over hundreds of times higher than any dose that any human being could possibly consume. Also, those studies do not make it clear whether the caffeine directly impaired brain-development in rats or whether it did so by causing sleep-deprivation. 
Children with ADHD who are given moderate to high doses of caffeine respond with improved test-performances and improved conduct. Children without ADHD who take comparable doses respond by temporarily having ADHD-like symptoms, such as fidgeting, but they do not act out or act violently, and the effects last only a few hours. 
Although there has been a large percentage-increase in caffeine consumption among children, due almost entirely to the popularity with that demographic of energy drinks, the absolute levels of caffeine consumption among pre-adults remains low. Moreover, there has been no evidence that caffeine consumption has adversely affected children’s health or psychological development, and there is definitive evidence that it is helpful in these respects to children with ADHD. 
Government regulations are expensive. They are expensive to implement and expensive to enforce. Oftentimes, these expenses are justified. For example, the laws that prohibit minors from purchasing alcohol, tobacco, and firearms are justified, given the obvious health-problems that such regulations prevent. In the case of caffeine-related regulations, such expenses would not be justified. Currently the sale of caffeine is almost completely unregulated, and there is no evidence of any kind that children or anyone else is being harmed as a result. Also, the introduction of such regulations would be especially thorny, given the fact that it is the active ingredient in many medications, including every single OTC medicine for migraine headaches and premenstrual syndrome. It is a distinct possibility that adolescents wanting a ‘caffeine fix’ might resort to buying Excedrin or Anacin, which, unlike straight caffeine, are far from harmless. Of course, the government could counter-respond by prohibiting the sale of Excedrin and other such medications, but nothing but suffering and inconvenience would come of any such prohibition, as anyone suffering from a migraine or from premenstrual syndrome knows all too well. 
Further problems arise from the fact that caffeine is available to consumers in a wide variety of forms, including snack-bars, teas, and health-drinks. Restrictions on the sale of caffeine, if enforced, would require a veritable army of regulators and would also debilitate a wide variety of businesses. The result of such restrictions would be an unwelcome and useless encroachment of government on the private sector, with no foreseeable gain for any demographic. It must therefore be concluded that, at present, any dialing up of caffeine-related regulations are contraindicated.

Who started the Cold War? 
The Soviet Union’s political ideology was inherently aggressive and expansionistic, and that—and that alone—is why the Cold War happened. It is obviously more politically correct to take the view that both of the two major parties involved in the Cold War were equally responsible for its genesis. But that isn’t at all true, for reasons to be discussed. Nor is it true that, once the Cold War had begun, the situation was morally symmetrical, with both parties behaving equally morally and equally immorally. The situation was fundamentally asymmetrical. This was because communism—especially, the particularly invidious form of it on which the USSR was based—was not simply one political system among others. Bolshevik communism was not intended to bring peace or prosperity either to the Russian people or to the rest of the world; and the founders of the Soviet Union had every intention of bringing about a war, or some kind or other, with the ‘decadent West’, especially the United States. 
“It is better than half the world perish and the other half be communist”, said Lenin, founder the Soviet Union, “than the entire human race live and communism perish.” Before World War II, the Soviet Leadership, headed by Joseph Stalin, had already deliberately starved one third of the Ukrainian population to death, as a way of breaking Ukrainian resistance to Soviet rule. In additions, millions of people in all of the Soviet Republics had been shot, imprisoned in the Gulag, or forced to relocate en masse. Freedom of speech was non-existent; private property was equally non-existent; living conditions were wretched; there were virtually no personal, religious, or commercial freedoms of any kind. Although some people obviously had more power than others, nobody had any legal rights of any kind. Stalinist Russia was the purest example in human history of a state that was inimical to its own people. 
In popular culture, we are often told that Stalin corrupted the revolution. “The revolution began with noble ideals”, we are told. “Trotsky and Lenin wanted to create a just and egalitarian social order, but Stalin seized power and derailed the Revolution.” Lenin and Trotsky had deliberately created a hyper-authoritarian state, and they used it to break the Russian the middle class, as well as most of the rest of Russian society. Lenin’s great ‘theoretical innovation’ as a Marxist was his belief that that, in order for a Marxist state to be created, it was necessary that a ‘revolutionary vanguard’, operating without any other party’s consent, autonomously take power and, once in power, forcibly impose communism on society. As for Trotsky, his great “innovation” as a Marxist was his belief in “permanent revolution” in all countries. In Trotsky’s view, the rightful objective of a Marxist “revolutionary vanguard” was to impose Marxist communism on all nations, not just on this or that specific nation. 
Lenin and Trotsky were in complete agreement on all of these points. In fact, their only significant points of disagreement concerned matters that were internal to Marxist theory and proved to be of no significance. For example, Trotsky, unlike Lenin and Marx, held that labor unions were not inimical to the long-term interests of the ‘proletariat.’ But since there were no labor unions in Russia, this disagreement was not important. Also, Lenin and Trotsky made it their objective to strip all Russians, including peasants, of all of their assets and to kill those who resisted. They rationalized this by saying that anyone who had any assets and did not immediately relinquish them was for that very reason a ‘kulak’ (meaning an exploitative landowner, comparable to a feudal lord) who, as such, had to be ‘exterminated.’ During World War 1, when the Red Cross entered Russia to provide food and medicine to the sick and malnourished Russian peasants, Lenin and Trotsky organized troops to drive them out of Russia, which they succeeded in doing and which they rationalized by saying that the Russian peasantry had to suffer as much as possible so that they would come to hate the Tsarist order and join them in overthrowing it. 
Stalin did indeed seize power; but he was only able to do so because the Communist Party had total power and he belonged to it. The Communist Party had total power because Lenin and Trotsky fought for decades to give it total power. Stalin and Trotsky were indeed foes, but not because they had important ideological disagreements. Quite the contrary, they were in perfect agreement as to what kind of government Russia was to have, their only disagreement concerning who was to be in charge of it. 
Stalin exiled Trotsky in 1928; and by the start of WWII, Stalin had long since had total power. Stalin used World War II to expand his power base to other countries, his first move in this direction being to absorb all of Eastern Europe into the Soviet Union. It is generally believed that this was the beginning of the Cold War. Not so. Before the Soviet Union had even been established, Lenin and Trotsky had agitated for Communist revolution in the United States and Britain and had already established a network of ‘fellow travelers.’ After WWII ended, the Soviet Union had real power; and Stalin, and the many others who wanted to spread the gospel of Marxist communism, had soviet military power behind them and therefore no longer had to rely solely on agitation and other such grass-roots measures. But the so-called ‘Cold War’ was merely a militarized continuation of a campaign to take control of the West that had been occurring since the first decade of the 20th century. This led to the wholesale Marxist takeover of China, North Korea, Cuba, and Cambodia. 
The United States’ role in the Cold War was entirely defensive, in every sense. To be sure, it made many terrible mistakes. It fought communism where it wasn’t a significant threat (e.g. Vietnam, Angola) and didn’t fight it where it was a significant threat (e.g. Eastern Europe, right after the end of WWII). But the Soviet Union was the aggressor. Also, the Soviet Union’s economy was completely broken; so even though its post-Stalinist leaders lacked the Marxist ardor of their predecessors, they had no choice but to expand, since their economy wasn’t self-sufficient. (When the Soviet Union fell in 1989, it was because it simply ran out of money.) The United States had a booming economy during the Cold War—and before it, except during the early 1930s—and stood to gain little, from its wars-by-proxy with the Soviet Union. It did not gain resources or land or trading partners; and it also lost good will and credibility, with its own citizens and with the rest of the world. But the Soviet Union had everything to gain from its engagements abroad; and those engagements where what kept it economically afloat during its short existence. 
In conclusion, the Cold War was a war of Soviet aggression, fueled by a commitment to aggressive expansionism that was built into its very system by its founders and catalyzed by its desperate need for resources. For the United States, the Cold War was a losing proposition; the United States did not profit from its engagements in Vietnam or Korea or Cuba or Guyana or Angola. Moreover, those engagements were public relations disasters. The only reason the United States undertook them is that it was trying to keep Soviet aggression in check. 
Who was a better President? 
Eisenhower or JFK? 
Ultimately, Eisenhower was a better president than JFK. This is not because JFK failed to accomplish anything during his presidency: he accomplished a great deal; and his list of presidential accomplishments is longer and more illustrious than Eisenhower’s list. It isn’t because he did too little that JFK was less of a President than Eisenhower, but rather because he did too much. The American people take it for granted that their President is supposed to solve their problems. This is largely JFK’s doing: thanks to him, government is now expected to be, for lack of a better term, a ‘big brother’— a righter of wrongs, as opposed to a neutral administrator, with the result that government is now so large that nobody’s rights are secure. Eisenhower’s presidency, by contrast, was emotionally neutral and, unlike JFK’s, did not pave the way for the situation we have now, in which the government is omnipresent. 
Let us start by listing Eisenhower’s main presidential accomplishments[161]: 
*He balanced the budget. 
*He created the highway system. 
*He kept America out of war. 
*He ended the Korean war and did so on terms that were at least reasonably consistent with American interests. 
*He signed the first Civil Rights Acts into law. 
Now let us state his main presidential failures (or what are taken to be such)[162]: 
*He failed to end the Cold War. 
*He failed to help the American farmer. 
*Economic growth, though steady, was slow. 
*He did not combat the hard-right, McCarthyite wing of the Republican Party. 
*He did not promote Civil Rights sufficiently aggressively. 
Notice that Eisenhower’s supposed ‘failures’ as a President were really about his not taking an interventionist, moralizing role in American 
affairs. When we say that Eisenhower ‘should’ have done more to combat McCarthyism, what is the justification? McCarthy had a position; other people had different positions. It may have been Eisenhower’s responsibility to curb criminal misconduct on McCarthy’s part, but it was not his responsibility to extirpate all support for McCarthy’s political views. So this ‘failure’ of Eisenhower’s was a failure only relative to an activist, Kennedyesque conception of government. 
Now let us look at Kennedy’s presidential achievements and failings, starting with his (alleged) achievements[163]: 
*He averted nuclear war. *He founded the peace corp. *He encouraged public service on the part of Americans. *He helped usher in affirmative action, equal pay, and civil rights. *He started the US space program. *He gave a temporary boost to the economy. 
Now let us look at his failures: 
*He gave arms to many (then) US allies, many of which are now dangerous actors. 
*He deepened our involvement in Viet Nam. 
*He failed to remove Castro from power, emboldening the Soviets to threaten us with Nuclear war. 
JFK’s achievements are impressive—but dubious. The theme we see running through his presidency is that it is the President’s job to be a hero: a righter of wrongs, as opposed to a mere administrator---which sometimes has positive effects (e.g. civil rights), sometimes has negative ones (e.g. Viet Nam), and sometimes has ambiguous effects (e.g. expansion of money supply and credit, leading to temporary economic spike), but has led to over-expansions of government in both domestic and foreign policy. 
Sadly, unless there is an actual crisis, it is the government’s job to govern—not to inspire, not to create a utopia, not even to eliminate all injustices. Eisenhower’s Presidency was a blank compare to Kennedy’s, his main accomplishment being the construction of the national highway system. Kennedy’s system was certainly not a blank, and he was obviously in many respects a singularly good president; but his legacy was that Presidents are supposed to be heroes, not mere civil servants, which has caused politics to become much more ideological and divisive than it has to be and which, consequently, has impaired the effectiveness of government. 
Who was a better President? Nixon or LBJ? 
Richard Nixon is now made out to be a bigoted right-wing extremist, and LBJ is made out to be the exact opposite, the conventional wisdom that Richard Nixon was an oppressor and LBJ a champion of the oppressed. But this position is not consistent with their actual political legacies. Under LBJ, and to a large extent because of him, the United States government engaged in aggressive campaigns to improve education and to fight poverty, unemployment, and racial discrimination. But the aftermath of these measures is increased unemployment among African Americans, a dysfunctional educational system for everybody, and a bloated and hyper-authoritarian Federal government. Richard Nixon, by contrast, did have at least some unambiguous successes as President and must therefore be regarded as better President than LBJ. 
Let us start by listing what many would regard as LBJ’s greatest accomplishments: 
*He created the welfare system, with its general financial provisions for those in dire economic straits. 
*He signed into law measures that aggressively racism towards ethnic minorities illegal in all but the most completely personal contexts. 
*He increased Federal funding, as well as oversight, of education by a factor of ten. 
LBJ’s greatest mistake as President is generally believed to be his decision to deep American involvement in Viet Nam. 
What about Richard Nixon? What were his greatest accomplishments 
as President? 
*Nixon founded the EPA. 
*Nixon officially recognized Communist China, which, by his 
intention, hastened the demise of the Soviet Union. 
*Nixon ended the Viet Nam war 
What were Nixon’s greatest mistakes? 
*He used the instruments of government to cover up a crime that he committed. 
*He deepened American involvement in Viet Nam before ending the war. 
*He started the War on Drugs. 
*He took America off the gold standard. 
With regard to the last item, I do not myself know that this was a mistake; but it is sufficiently often mentioned that I felt obliged to include it. As for the War on Drugs, for various reasons (the main being that penalizes lifestyles, as opposed to crimes, and therefore turns the police into thought police), I believe this to be one of the worst mistakes ever made in the history of public policy, and it is, in my judgment, the blackest spot on Nixon’s legacy. 
Given only what we’ve said thus far, LBJ appears to be the obvious front-runner. But not so fast! LBJ’s ‘War on Poverty’ created more poverty, especially among the very groups that it was intended to help. Prior to LBJ’s great reforms, 
*Unemployment among African Americans was lower than it is. 
*African Americans were considerably more likely to own their 
businesses than they are now 
*African Americans were more likely to be employed as engineers and to have trades. 
*Crime among African Americans was lower, as were incarceration rates. 
*Income-gaps between Caucasians and African Americans were 
smaller, as were education-gaps. 
*Public education was better and less expensive. 
*The Federal government was smaller. 
*The cost of living was lower. 
*Rates of depression and mental illness were lower. 
*Rates of homeownership, including among African Americans, were higher. 
*Levels of well-being, including among African Americans, were higher. 
In a word, each of LBJ’s signature policies, though admirable in intent, seriously backfired. Also, LBJ’s decisions concerning Viet Nam cost lives on both sides, while failing to advance American interests. 
By contrast, Nixon’s good deeds as Presidents have stood the test of time. By recognizing China, Nixon created infighting within the Communist bloc and thereby paved the way for the demise of Soviet Communism. AS for the EPA, it does water it is supposed to do: it protects the environment, including wildlife, and helps keep water clean and water drinkable. As for Nixon’s behavior vis-à-vis Vietnam, this, like many other aspects of his presidency, was ambiguous. But he did end the war, despite being under pressure from his own base to continue it; and that is more than can be said for Johnson. 
In conclusion, LBJ clearly meant well, but his policies to a large extent did the opposite of what they were supposed to do. According to economists, this is because those policies replaced the invisible hand of supply-and-demand with the dead hand of government policy, leading to a weakened economy and a consequent loss of wealth across the board, especially for those on the bottom economic rung. I suspect that there is more to the story. I personally do not believe that welfare is particularly destructive, economically or otherwise, and I don’t believe LBJ was wrong to implement generous welfare policies. But his expansion of government was too fast and too large, its aftermath being a government that is too large and is too involved in people’s lives. 
Technology-caused Job-shortages and the Need for Universal Welfare 
How, if at all, will artificial jobs affect employment in the future? Are you an optimist on this score, or a pessimist? 
Artificial intelligence eliminates several jobs for each job that it creates. This is what has been happening since AI’s very inception, and this is what will continue to happen. Some people claim that AI creates as many jobs as it eliminates. This is false, and it is the purpose of this essay to prove that it is false. I will start by showing that it is inherent in what technology is that technological advancement decreases the amount of work that there is for people to do. I will then explain why this is doubly true of AI. I will end by discussing how government should deal with the job-shortage that AI will inevitably lead to. 
Technology reduces the need to work, and it makes the work that it doesn’t eliminate less difficult. Thanks to tractors, sewing-machines, and gas-powered drills, it takes little effort to do in an afternoon what it would take months of back-breaking labor to do by hand. What is true of cars, tractors, and sewing machines is true of AI-based technologies: thanks to smartphone-apps and computer-programs, it takes little effort, as well as little training, to do in a single afternoon what would otherwise be impossible or would require months of intense intellectual work on the part of a trained professional. 
Many people have either lost jobs to technology or fear that they soon will. Right-wing economists have argued that such people are wrong. According to such economists, technology creates a job for every job that it takes away. In their view, technology took jobs away from cobblers, but it created new jobs for the engineers needed to build and maintain the machines that made cobblers unnecessary. Similarly, so they argue, AI is taking jobs away from stockbrokers, but it has created new jobs for the programmers needed to service the e-platforms that eliminated the need for stockbrokers. In general, so it is argued, technology needs people to service it and therefore creates jobs that take the place of those that it eliminates. 
This position is false and always has been. In societies that have little or no technology, the unemployment rate tends to be zero. There was no unemployment in Cambodia under Pol Pot; nor was there any in an Eskimo fishing community in the year 1600. The reason is the same in each case: where there is no technology, labor is inefficient, and everybody must therefore work. To be sure, new technology does indeed create new kinds of work: before there were cars, there were no auto-mechanics; and before there were smartphones, there were no app-developers. But the purpose of technology is to minimize how much work we have to do; it is not to alter the nature of what we have to do while keeping its quantity the same. If cars, tractors, and fork-lifts didn’t lighten workloads, we wouldn’t have much use for them. Consequently, there is no truth whatsoever to the idea that technological advancement creates as much work as it eliminates. 
Why was such an absurd position ever argued for? The main reason is that the economists who advocate this position want to minimize the amount of government-interference in the economy. Their position is that government regulation restricts commerce and thwarts economic development: and in most contexts, they are right, since a society cannot function for long unless its members are allowed to exchange goods and services. But even if unregulated societies economically outperform regulated ones, it doesn’t follow that the government should never regulate. Second, unemployment benefits are not a form of government regulation and don’t have the same invidious economic effects as regulations. The law that prevents people from teaching unless they have a master’s degree in education is a regulation, since it prevents the market from deciding who works and gives that power to the government. The laws prevent people from killing and robbing are not regulations, since they don’t do this, and neither, for the same reason, are the laws that give people welfare benefits. To be sure, welfare benefits are not economically innocuous, since they have to be paid for out of people’s taxes; but granting that excessive taxation hurts an economy, moderate taxation is sometimes a necessity, this being a case in point. 
Technology has always eliminated jobs; but in times past, the contrary position, though false, was at least defensible. Pre-AI technology did not run itself, and its effect was not so much to eliminate employment as it was to make employment less about physical labor and more about knowing how to operate labor-saving machines. When the tractor came into existence, agricultural work became that much less about physical labor and that much more about knowing how to operate a tractor. But the story is very different when tractors are replaced by self-operating tractors and when, more generally, machines are replaced by robots. True—people will still be needed to maintain those robots, but there will be very few such jobs in relation to the number of labor jobs lost, and those jobs will also require unusually high levels of training and intellectual acumen. In general, a slight improvements in technology creates massive gains in efficiency and a corresponding drop in the demand for a given person’s labor. 
This is cause for alarm if people are still required to work for food, lodging, and other necessities, since new technology, especially AI-based technology, makes most people economically redundant. But it is not a cause for alarm if people are not forced to work for basic necessities. And thanks to the surpluses of wealth created by the very technologies that make most people economically redundant, there is no reason for most people to work. 
The standard response to this is that, unless people are forced to work, they will become parasites and society will fall apart. But the truth is that most people right now are parasites: most jobs are not necessary and cost society more than they are worth. Somebody who receives $20,000 in welfare is quite harmless. But a redundant police officer or government bureaucrat is not harmless, since, unlike the welfare recipient, that person has power. This is not to say that all government employees and police officers are useless. But there is no way to create jobs for people without giving them at least some power. Even the lowliest and most unnecessary clerk can jam up legitimate business—and is likely to do so to make himself feel important. Creating jobs for unemployable people gives them the ability to prevent employable people from contributing, and it is therefore best simply to give them money for basic necessities. Ironically, the belief of right-wing economists that everyone should have to compete in the arena of commerce, with its consequent refusal on the part of government to give welfare to people who simply cannot do so, leads to the creation of vast numbers of jobs that benefit nobody, including those who have them. I therefore suggest that a universal welfare policy be instituted. In this I am in agreement with many distinguished people, including economically informed right-wing figures, such as Richard Nixon, who was one of the first public figures to advocate such a policy, as well as technology-wise left-wing figures, such as Mark Zuckerberg. 
My Reaction to Schoenberg’s A Survivor from Warsaw https://www.youtube.com/wa 
v=DFXkc9AGoeU 

The ‘point’ of this work, so to speak, is that the events in question were not simply dark but fell outside of what human beings are able to process; and this work conveys that point by being atonal and, on that basis, deriding and caricaturing pre-existing musical norms, rather than deploying them in any ordinary way. The first sounds that we hear are of an almost triumphant-sounding trumpet (01:-04). The motif is almost like that of a national anthem (e.g. the Chinese National Anthem, which is based on what sounds like a tonal version of this same trumpet-riff). But the modal is askew, being atonal, and is quickly met with a dark, semi-atonal orchestral background. Incidentally, the cello motif immediately heard thereafter sounds like Philip Glass, and I suspect that he may even have consciously borrowed it. (Cf. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Stu7h7Qup8 
32:09) 
The rest of this work followed suit, all of it being on the edges of tonal music and all of it being, as it were, derogatory of it and, so it seems, of the cultural norms thereby represented, the work’s overall point seemingly being that what was happening in the world could no longer be understood in the usual rationality-based ways. What was a little hard to understand—or at least to fit into this way of understanding this work---was Chorale part, sung in Hebrew, as to the Jewish people’s future responsibilities to itself. The lyrics were straightforward and clearly non-ironic; but the accompanying music was atonal and, so it seemed, derisive, making it unclear whether the words being sung were to be taken literally, on the one hand, or, on the other hand, dismissed, in light of recent events, as naïve. I suspect that they were meant to be taken literally and were accompanied by atonal, ambiguous-sounding music only because that was the genre in which Schoenberg happened to composer. 
I chose to listen to the video that did not feature Holocaust pictures. This was because I wanted to listen to the music without being ‘told’, so to speak, how to react. (The singing, especially the solo singing in English, did, however, tell me, quite literally, what I was to be thinking and feeling; and I was a bit surprised at this brazen violation of the ‘show, don’t tell’ rule governing theatrical performances.) Frankly, I found this work easy to listen to, precisely because it doesn’t use conventional tonality. I was able to listen to each bar on its own, without having to feel that I had to embed in a larger musical narrative. Also, even though this music is classified as ‘atonal’, it is not, literally speaking, atonal; it is only relatively atonal. Relatedly, I think that contemporary audiences would find this piece much less jarring than Schoenberg’s contemporaries, mainly because so much film music sounds like this, probably because, so I suspect, Schoenberg’s music itself influenced film-composers. 
And this last point, I think, is central to what is going with Schoenberg’s music. Bach’s music is not meant to represent anything; neither is Mozart’s or Beethoven’s. These composers did, of course, compose masses and operas and other story-accompanying works; but their music is always, ultimately, to be listened to by itself. Schoenberg’s music, by contrast, sounds like a movie score and is easy to listen if listened to in that way. But if listened to on its own, in the way in which Mozart or Beethoven are listened to, it is a bit grating. I would conjecture that part of what allowed Schoenberg to compose atonal music was that his music was, at least by his intention, to be listened to as an accompaniment to a play or some such, and not on its own, so that the dissonances in it as comments on an independent story-line, and not as musical ends unto themselves.

Identify an argument in an article, book etc. that does poorly on TWO or more of the 7 standards Paul & Elder say help assess critical thinking. Briefly discuss. 
The book I chose is 'Being and Time' by Martin Heidegger. I have been told that it is a great work; but I found scarcely a single intelligible sentence in it. Plus, I also found repeated use of the same undefined terms ("existential", "authenticity", "throwness"), often with confusing variations. So far as I could understand it, it seemed to be saying that human beings are being true to themselves when they work with their hands but not when they work for companies or bureaucracies, the idea being that the latter are soul-robbingly parasitical organizations. Which--if that is what Heidegger is saying-is fine, but could have been, and has been said, better and certainly more concisely. I'd have to give this work an F on clarity, logic, and organization. 
Here is a characteristic quotation: 
"inquiring or in choosing. This holds true-and by no means least-for that understanding which is rooted in Dasein's ownmost Being, and for the possibility of developing it-namely, for ontological understanding. When tradition thus becomes master, it does so in such a way that what it 'transmits' is made so inaccessible, proximally and for the most part, that it rather becomes concealed. Tradition takes what has come down to us and delivers it over to self-evidence; it blocks our access to those primordial 'sources' from which the categories and concepts handed down to us have been in part quite genuinely drawn'! Indeed it makes us forget that they have had such an origin, and makes us suppose that the necessity of going back to these sources is something which we need not even understand. Dasein has had its historicality so thoroughly uprooted by tradition that it confines its interest to the multiformity of possible types, directions, and standpoints of philosophical activity in the most exotic and alien of cultures; and by this very interest it seeks to veil the fact that it has no ground of its Own to stand on. Consequently, despite all its iological interests and all its zeal for an Interpretation which is philologically 'objective' ["sachliche"], Dasein no longer understands the most elcmentary conditions which would alone enable it to go back to the past in a positive manner and make it productively its own. We have shown at the outset (Section I) not only that the question of the meaning of Being is one that has not been attended to and one that has been inadequately formulated, but that it has become quite forgotten in spite of all our interest in 'metaphysics'. Greek ontology and its history -which, in their numerous filiations and distortions, determine the conceptual character of philosophy even today-prove that when Dasein 22 understands either itself or Being in general, it does so in terms of the 'world', and that the ontology which has thus arisen has deteriorated to a tradition in which it gets reduced to something self-evident -merely material for reworking, as it was for In the Middle Ages this uprooted Greek ontology became a fixed body of doctrine. Its systematics, however, is by no means a mere joining together of traditional pieces into a single edifice. Though its basic conceptions of Being have been taken over dogmatically from the Greeks, a great deal of unpretentious work has been carried on further within these limits. With the peculiar character which the Scholastics gave it, Greek ontology has, in its essentials, travelled the path that leads through the Disputationes metaphysicae of Suarez to the 'metaphysics' and transcendental philosophy of modern times, determining even the foundations and the aims of Hegel's..."

Response to Posts about Descartes’ Evil Demon (my material in italics) 
Erik Smallwood posted Oct 15, 2019 6:24 AM 
Descartes evil genius theory very compelling. I can relate this to a couple of different things. One way is how do actually know that you are awake or if you are dreaming. I think of the movie Inception. The only way they could know if they were out of the dream world was by checking their personal totems. The phrase Cogito Ergo Sum reminds me of the Matrix or conspiracy theories that involve our world being run by a computer simulation program (Sims, SimCity). I think, therefore I am would seem to be able to stand up to the challenge but when looking at it in the Inception or Matrix views the computer could be allowing you think. As for the topics we have discussed in previous posts, I think the only one that could come close to passing the challenge presented would be death. We now that we will all die eventually. I do find a problem with this in the fact that we have multiple instances of reincarnation through out the history of religion. You could view death as just the next step in fulfilling the ultimate purpose of said thing. Use a fish for example. The fish is caught and killed. It turns into food which gives energy when we eat it. We also use the guts and remains to help fertilize and grow our plants. If you look at death t 
Great post! You made a profound point, namely, that the Evil Genius scenario is concerned not just with epistemology but also with political and even personal life. Ordinarily, the Evil Genius scenario is taken as a way of motivating skepticism, its purpose being to show that our sensory experiences could in principle be hallucinations. But if Descartes’ objective had been to make a strictly epistemological point, he wouldn’t have used such a pregnant metaphor; he would have attributed the hallucinations in question to impersonal forces, such as a chemical balance, not to a sentient being, let alone a malicious God-like one. 
During this time, science was proving the erroneousness of Scripture and the Catholic Church was being outed as a malicious deceiver. And as this was happening, the Church responded maliciously and defensively, sometimes simply killing the scientists in question. I believe that the ‘demon’ of which Descartes speaks was a metaphor for the Catholic Church. I do not believe that this was by Descartes’ conscious intention, but it was nonetheless intentional, albeit unconsciously so. 
Madisen Domayer posted Oct 14, 2019 4:48 PM 
The argument of the evil genius is confusing. Trying to understand that we “live” in a world where everything is full of deceptions is hard to grasp. It hard to imagine everything I think or see as being false, or possibly false. I think this relates to his argument of conscious vs. consciousness. Conscious refers to what we believe while consciousness is what is true. According to the evil genius theory, our conscious and consciousness are not the same, for our conscious is full of deception. One way to disprove this theory is finding ideas that we can ensure exist without doubt, such as counting numbers and knowing the alphabet. This concept relates to the Cogito Ergo Sum argument. Since I think something is true, it has to exist, despite the evil genius theory. If I can think it, it is real. I think these two theories can become confusing, but if you think of them as two separate idea, even two that contract teach other, they seem to make more since. 
I don’t think the Evil Genius scenario is quite as opaque as you make it out to be. The idea is simply that our sense-perceptions could be hallucinations. I grant that Descartes muddies the waters a bit by attributing those hallucinations to an ‘evil demon’, which introduces potentially confusing political and emotional resonances into the scenario. But the point is clear enough: what we regard as accurate awarenesses could be delusions. 
In response to which, Descartes rightly asks: What is it that I could not fail to be right about? What is my Archimedean point in my question for knowledge? Supposing that I am the victim of deliberate and systematic deception, what is that, for all that, I could not possibly be deceived about? Descartes’ answer is—I know that I doubt, and therefore think, and therefore exist. In a word—I think, therefore I am. The mere existence of doubt proves the existence of thought and, consequently, of one’s own existence. And Descartes is right about this: one’s own thought, even if that thought assumes the form of doubt, affirms one’s own existence. 
Descartes also believes that, on this slender basis, he can prove that we in fact know what we think we know—that, in particular, we can prove that, as a general rule, our sensory experiences are accurate, the same being true, with some qualifications, of the inferences we draw from them. Although I agree with Descartes that we do in fact have much of the knowledge that we attribute to ourselves, I don’t know that ‘I think, therefore I am’ is, or even could be, the basis of that knowledge. The actual basis of our knowledge of the external world is derived from considerations of continuity and coherence, as in, we must posit an external world answering to our ‘perceptual narrative’ in order to render the gaps in that narrative non-anomalous.

Solve for x, 3.6=x/.04 X=.144 
4. Elasticity of supply=1.5, price increases 2%, what effect on quantity supplied? 
Solve for x, 1.5=x/.02 X=.03 
5. Farmer’s yields up 30% 
Farm output elasticity=--.75 What effect on revenue? Solve for x, -.75=.3/x X=-.4 Therefore, yield increases by 30% but demand decreases by 40%. So percentage of output not demanded has increased, and net revenue (revenue minus expenses) has therefore decreased.

Demand curve: p=200-.2q 

7. 
What level of tax will lead to social equilibrium? 


MPC=50+.1q MEC=.1q 
Private equilibrium=intersection of p=200-.2q and 50+.1q->q=500 

Tax = MEC at social equilibrium = .1(2000/3)=66.67 
8. Does tax create deadweight loss 
Deadweight loss=economic inefficiency Question ambiguous Taxing negative externality eliminates deadweight loss. So this particular tax ($66.67) does not create deadweight loss. Taxing non-externality does create deadweight loss, since the amount taxed is unpaid work, leading to inefficiency Professor seems to have had second disambiguation in mind, but your answer correct given the context. 
9. At private equilibrium, calculate elasticity of demand 
Private equilibrium -> 500->p/q=100/500 Elasticity=125/-25=-5 
Elasticity of demand at private equilibrium=-5(1/5)=-1 
10. Calculate elasticity of demand between two equilibrium points using midpoint method: 
General formula: 
(q2-q1)/((q1+q2)/2) divided by (p2-p1)/((p1+p2)/2) 
Q1=375 Q2=500 
P1=125 P2=100 
Q2-q1=125 Q2+q1=875 (q2+q1)/2=437.5 
(q2-q1)/((q1+q2)/2)=125/437.5=.256 
P2-p1=-25 p2+p1=225 (p2+p1)/2=112.5 (p2-p1)/((p1+p2)/2)=-25/112.5=-.222 
(q2-q1)/((q1+q2)/2) divided by (p2-p1)/((p1+p2)/2) 
= .256/-.222 =

Summary of Video about Milgram Experiment 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?

Critical Viewing Form 
BA 3102 
Instructions: Please address each item below for each movie. The total length of your critical viewing form responses should be approximately one-half to one page, single spaced. This form will be graded on a pass/fail basis. To pass, you need to provide reasonably detailed and insightful answers to the items below. 
1. Briefly summarize the basic plot, or issue that the movie addresses. 
The video concerned the Milgram experiment, along with a recent recreation thereof. In these experiments, volunteers were ordered to commit acts that, so they were led to believe, caused intense pain to human beings. (In reality, the people being tortured were actors and were not experiencing pain, but the volunteers did not know this and had every reason to believe otherwise.) 90% of the volunteers followed orders to a tee, their ‘excuse’ (or ‘justification’, depending on how you look it) being ‘I had my orders; the rest is not my responsibility.’ The point of these videos seems to be that people don’t take responsibility for their behavior unless they have to. 
2. What do you think is the most interesting point in the movie? 
I found it interesting that there was little or no difference between men and women in respect of how willing they were to follow orders even when those orders involved inflicting pain. Unlike the commentators, however, I did not find the result particularly surprising. Supposing for argument’s sake that women are more empathic, this empathy can either play out in the form of empathic connectedness to one’s supervisor or to one’s victim; and, as it turns out, it is more likely to play out in the former way. 
3. What is the most controversial statement you’ve heard? 
It may be that my own life-experiences have biased me, or it may be that I have already internalized and accepted the results of the Milgram experiment; but what I found most controversial was the assumption, made by all parties involved, that a human being’s go-to is just behavior and that unjust behavior requires that special rationalizations be operative. In my own experience, people tend to take the path of least resistance; they do what is expedient, not for the most part what is principled. To be sure, setting aside the odd psychopath, people choose expediency within the limits set by social acceptability; but, in my own experience, people who act with integrity despite strong social incentives to act without it are more the exception than the rule; and I found the frequently made assertion to the contrary to be particularly controversial, at least relative to my own starting assumptions. 
4. What is the most important ethical issue that the movie is addressing? Please explain. 
Do people do what is right or what is expedient? If the movie is to be trusted, which it is, the answer is: they do what is expedient. It may not have been the intention of Stanley Milgram or of the movie-makers to make this point; perhaps it was their intention to make a case that people’s moral judgment is easily skewed, with the result that, despite having the best of intentions, they act wrongly. And maybe that is what it shows: but I think the reality uncovered here is simply that people are more self-interested than ethical. 
Racism and Sexism 
BA 3102 Online Reflection Paper #2 Instructions 
Please take the Implicit Association Test and reflect on your results. The test is on the web, located at www.understandingprejudice.org/iat. Take the race and gender/career IAT tests. You need not report your scores. In your paper, please answer these questions: 
1. 
Do you think that the tests measure unconscious bias with respect to race and gender? Please be specific in discussing aspects of the test that you think are or are not valid for measuring unconscious bias. 

2. 
Either way, do you think unconscious bias exists in society (regarding race and/or gender)? If not, why not; if you think it does, how might it show itself in the organizational context? 


If you have questions about how the test works, go to https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/demo/background/faqs.html; it may be able to answer them. 
Please note that research shows that the order in which the faces are presented to you does have an effect, but the effect is very small and usually does not have a significant effect on your results. Also, please note that there are other tests in addition to the race and gender/career tests. If you wish to take one or more of these, go to this site: https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/demo/takeatest.html. You need not log in. Just enter as a guest. 
Your paper should be one to two double spaced pages, using 1 inch margins and a normal sized font. Your reflection paper will be graded on a pass/fail basis. To pass, you need to make a reasonable case for your point of view and meet the page requirement. 
There were two tests: one concerning gender, the other concerning race. The test on gender definitely did a good job of measuring the degree to which the test-taker associates career with masculinity and family with femininity. According to the test, I myself do strongly associate masculinity with work and femininity with family. I do not regard this as a bias. I used to be an ardent feminist; but, ironically, it was female acquaintances of mine who convinced to soften my pro-feminist attitudes. They told me that feminism forced them to have to work, which left them little time for family and children, which, so they told me, they deeply resented. 
When in public, I always defer to politically correct positions; and I also think that gender-roles are in fact easily overvalued. I know many men who are dismal professionals and many women who are highly competent ones; and the issue is not, frankly, one that greatly exercises me. In any case, the test did accurately gauge my feelings about traditional gender roles, with the qualification that I would not refer to those feelings as ‘biases’, since, when confronted with a woman who clearly feels at home in the workplace, or a man who clearly feels at home at home (pun intended), I strongly feel that the woman belongs in the workplace and the man belongs at home. 
As for the test on racism, it did a good job of measuring one’s feelings concerning one’s feelings about blacks (if one is white) or whites (if one is black). That said, even if one unconsciously regards whites as superior to blacks or vice versa, that is not, in and of itself, racism, since it is actions that are racist, not feelings. Somebody who has an anti-black bias but resists it when making decisions—when deciding who to hire, for example---is not racist, even though he may have the emotional underpinnings of racism. 
Humans should not be condemned if, at a given moment, they have a politically incorrect sentiment, since feelings are fluid and will tend to right­size themselves as the occasion demands. I used to have preconceptions about Chinese culture; then I got involved with a Chinese woman and, as a result, developed a pro-Chinese bias, which in its turn led to an anti-Western bias. I do not think such reversals are unusual; and I also think that, although people inevitably have preferences, some of them not entirely well-informed, they tend at the end of the day to be reasonably fair-minded when it comes to matters of race. 
Are their unconscious racial biases in our society? Of course there are. There are three hundred million people in this country, and practically any given American, including those who pose as completely politically correct, inevitably have ‘in-group’ biases. But, first of all, the people who go out of their way to show how politically correct they are often, in my experience, have politically driven and unnatural views about members of other groups. They treat a given black person as a black person, not as a black person. Individual blacks, like individual whites, want to move forward professionally; they fall in love; they fall out of love; and so on. The same being true of individual members of any other given group. And in my experience, people who are excessively concerned with political correctness seem to be focused, ironically, on group-affiliations, as opposed to individual characteristics. 
More importantly, what is important is not how individual members of a society feel but how they act. Behaviors can be managed, through laws and policies and the like, but emotions cannot be directly managed—and should not be directly managed. And whatever the private sentiments of individual American may be—and those sentiments vary widely, even within a given demographic---I don’t see that there is systematic denial of opportunity or of justice to people based on gender or race. There are laws and institutions that are intended to protect would-be targets of discriminatory conduct—and, as far as I can tell, do a creditable job of doing so. Finally, I think that the personal sentiments of individual Americans tend to follow official policy in this regard, with the consequence that we are not on the whole a particularly racist or sexist or otherwise bigoted group.

5. 
What am I going to do to become true to myself? Am I going to keep doing what others expected me to do? 


Hi Sahillys! I am a big Orwell fan, and I have read “Shooting an Elephant.” So I will try to answer your questions: 1*. First of all, “Shooting an Elephant” (SAE) is not a story; it is non­fiction. Orwell was a civil servant in Burma, and this is a true story about one of his experiences there. And yes, Orwell represents the British Empire. Actually, both he and the elephant represent the British Empire, each of them being, its own way, wounded and faltering, like (so it is suggested) the British Empire. 2*. Orwell had a legal and moral duty to kill the elephant, given that it was on a rampage. So he did in fact behave correctly. 3*. I don’t know that the elephant deserved to die, but it was killing people; so it had to be dispatched. 4*. Yes, the elephant symbolizes the British Empire---or is meant to. Orwell was a liberal anti-colonialist; and the point of SAE is to depict the British Empire as bombastic and oppressive. 5*. I believe that Orwell’s behavior in this context was not so much about personal pressure as it was about professional obligation. And no, Orwell was not a particularly powerful person. He never had much money or status and died in a poor house. 1*. Some people wear masks; others don’t. Those who wear masks tend to so most of the time, if not all of the time. Those who don’t do so are rarely phony. 2*. Some people are who they are and live honestly; others aren’t and don’t. We are not all in the same boat, as far being honest and living authentically are concerned. Some people embrace who they are and don’t buckle under peer pressure; others collapse like a house of cards. Anthropologists say that, given a group of twenty people, 19 do what the rest do and one decides for himself what to do. 3*. People who are real in real life are real in social media; people who are fake in real life are fake in social media. The former are less drawn to social media than the latter and are likely to use it primarily for reasons of 
a practical as opposed to emotional nature. 4*. Yes, tautologously so. If it is right, then we have a responsibility to do it; and if it is wrong, we have a responsibility not to do it. These are definitional truths. 5*. Nothing is preventing you from being you except you. People are what they choose to be. 
When is it a good for a company to decentralize? 
Given only the information provided, Derek should fight the holacracy initiative. Given additional information, the verdict might be different, but none of the information provided warrants decentralizing Contect; in fact, that information suggests that the opposite path is the appropriate one. Also, the changes involved in the holacracy initiative would be far-reaching and would have unpredictable consequences; and such an initiative would therefore be contraindicated in this context, since Contect’s growth has been steady and might well be jeopardized by such an initiative. 
Contect is a global construction company with many regional offices. Given that Contect is global, it might seem to be a good idea to decentralize. After all, each of its branch offices knows better than central management what it has to do and what constraints it is operating within; and it might therefore seem reasonable to implement a Holacracy-style decentralization-initiative. Also, decentralization has been proven to be the way to go in many contexts. One way for a corporation to decentralize is for it to become a franchise, and sometimes this is extremely profitable, as the case of McDonald’s shows. 
This does not appear to be one of those times. “Without centralized oversight of projects,” it says in the Case Study, “any single subsidiary’s missteps risked taking down the entire company,” the reason being that Contect is a construction-company. Construction-projects are magnets for civil and criminal litigation. There is a high probability of deliberately or accidentally violating local laws. If a Contect regional manager decides to cut costs by flouting some regulation, the result could be large numbers of deaths and injuries, a likely result being that Contect as a whole is targeted for criminal and civil actions and either shut down because of a legal action or bankrupted out of existence. Also, we know about a case where poor decisions on the part of a Contect regional office led to losses of approximately $700,000,000 as well as loss of reputation. 
It’s one thing to make Big Macs. It is quite another to make buildings. There is a single uniform recipe for all Big Macs. There cannot possibly be anything similar in the case of buildings. In addition, success in the construction-business is largely about not making mistakes. Suppose that Contect builds 100 buildings that don’t fall down and one building that does fall down. That one building is more than enough to shut off Contect’s lights and possibly put its leaders in prison. Of course, if there is a case of food-poisoning at a single McDonald’s, that too could cause major problems for the McDonald’s corporation. But McDonald’s can hedge against that by insisting that all franchises strictly follow a script; and this is not possible in the case of Contect, since no two buildings are the same. 
In some contexts, decentralization is appropriate. A personal acquaintance of mine runs an extremely successful online consulting business; and although he is the boss, each employee has almost complete autonomy. This person (let’s call him “Smith”) is himself very talented and he hired five or six very talented people; he finds them business and in exchange they ‘kick up’ a percentage, but nobody gives orders to anybody. His motto is “hire good people and leave them alone.” Smith’s overhead costs are minimal; there is no bureaucratic redundancy; and everyone who works for him is happy, since they have complete freedom. At Smith’s firm, there are no group meetings. When Smith meets with people, it is always one-on-one. And those occasions are rare. If an employee is underperforming, he is given a brief warning or just let go; and if he is performing adequately, he is not likely to hear anything. 
I know another person (let’s call him “Brown”) who started a consulting business in a similar professional area. Brown’s business-model is very different from Smith’s. Brown wants rules and predictability; and he insists on regular group-meetings and group-outings, and the like. The problem is that Brown’s company is small, and its employees find it hard to bring clients in, or to service existing clients, without getting blowback of some kind from Brown. Brown managed to borrow millions of dollars to start his business, which is why his business is still up and running, but it has been losing money since day one, unlike Smith’s business, which began with a $20,000 loan and is making money since day one. 
The kind of anarchical approach to management that Brian Robertson is talking about makes a lot of sense when profits depend on creativity, as is the case with Smith’s firm; and it also makes a lot of sense when well-defined procedures can take the place of central management, as is the case with McDonald’s. It makes less sense with a company, such as Contect, whose product is buildings, as opposed to ideas, and whose production-process cannot in any way be predetermined by some McFormula. Implementing Holacracy might benefit Contect, but it would also be extremely risky; and the risk is not worth taking, since Contect is currently doing well. 
A Tough Business Decision 
Instructions: Please answer the questions below. The length of your written case assignment form responses should be approximately one to one and a half pages, single spaced. This form will be graded on a pass/fail basis. To pass, you need to provide reasonably detailed and insightful answers to the questions below. 
You have a decision to make as Nash. To simplify things, assume that you can either (A.) sell the property to Fledgling (you won’t face legal repercussions), or (B.) not sell the property (delaying the sale while you investigate the toxic waste will likely kill the sale). 
1. What/who are the main stakeholders to your decision? List them with a brief explanation. 
The stakeholders are all of the parties who stand to be affected by my (Nash’s) decision. Nash. Therefore, *I myself am a major stakeholder, since I stand to lose my job and even my career if I make the wrong decision (and also, indeed, if I make the right one). *DAC as a whole is another stakeholder---and probably the largest one, since its solvency is at stake, as well as its reputation. *All employees of DAC are stakeholders, with higher ranking employees having commensurately more at stake than lower ranking ones. *The people who are planning on purchasing the land are stakeholders. And finally *Anyone whose health might be adversely affected by the deal is a stakeholder, since, of course, one’s health is one’s most important asset. 
2. What would you do? Sell it or not sell it? Why? 
The question is not whether or not to sell, but whether or not to make all parties involved aware of the relevant facts. And the answer to that question is: yes. I know that there are threats to people’s health on that land, and I have a moral, if not a legal, obligation to apprise any people who might be either selling or buying that land of those facts. 
I have a moral obligation to the people who are buying it, because the deal will not be in good faith if I don’t do so and also because, if they aren’t given this information, their own health and those of their tenants will be jeopardized, not to mention that they may well be lost to criminal and civil liability. 
Also, if I don’t make Williams, my boss, aware of the relevant facts, then, first of all, he won’t be in a position to make a morally informed decision and, what’s more, he could blame the entire situation on me if all goes awry, which is very likely. 
3. Please indicate whether your decision in 2. is more consistent with utilitarianism, profit maximization, or universalism, and explain why. 
I would make Williams aware of the facts. For practical reasons, I would tell him that I was doing this to protect the airline’s reputation and to protect him civil and criminal fallout. I would also point out to him that the airline’s current cashflow problems would be negligible compared to the problems to which not disclosing the situation might lead. Finally, we have no idea how the buyers will react: for all we know, they will still want the land, granting that they will probably be able to bargain down the price. 
We are dealing a potential case of serious criminal negligence. Further, I don’t even know that I would lose out financially by coming clean with Williams and also with the buyers. Finally, if Williams is smart, then he knows that, if he greenlights the deal without disclosing what he knows, I will be a witness to what he did. This does not mean that Williams let me keep my job. But if he fires me, I will still have my reputation and my integrity; and if I don’t tell him, I will very likely lose both. And the situation being what it is, the probability is that I will eventually lose both. Conclusion: Tell Williams and give him the chance to come clean with the buyers; and if he doesn’t, play the hero and go them directly, which, as Williams knows, would make it hard for him to fire me without turning himself into a villain and which, in addition, is the right thing to do. 
An Ethical Quandry 
Instructions: Please answer the questions below. The length of your video case assignment form responses should be approximately one page, single spaced. This form will be graded on a pass/fail basis. To pass, you need to provide reasonably detailed and insightful answers to the questions below. 
1. After part one if the video case, Julia is confronted with a 
decision: Should she turn left, into town, and report the accident to the 
police? Or should she turn right and go home? What do you think is 
the most ethical decision? 
Obviously, the ethical decision is to take responsibility. In a way, the fact that it was ‘accidental’---in the sense that it was caused by negligence—makes the situation less morally complicated, not more. Suppose that, for some reason or other, had targeted this person, perhaps because of a vendetta or perhaps simply because she was just plain evil. In that case, of course, her act of killing the other person would have been unambiguously evil, but her subsequent act of not turning herself in, though itself evil in its right, would at least have not been hypocritical. Moreover, she would not under that circumstance have been guilty of negligence---that is, of simply not taking full responsibility for her own actions before committing them. It is not too much to demand of a person that they not drink and drive and also that they not, while driving, rummage around items that they drop. I myself constantly have occasion to drive while tired or under the influence of Ambien, and I myself also frequently have occasion to change the radio while driving or to pick up items that I drop. But I don’t---not because I morally perfect, but simply because I am not a complete degenerate. 
But Julia was negligent, and her behavior was hypocritical. She had spent the entire evening reveling in accolades given to her for her civic mindedness. But then when the very same social system that conferred those honors demanded that she take care to drive carefully, she failed to do so; and when it then required her to take responsibility for this lapse of hers, she again failed to take responsibility. 
Julia’s failure to turn herself, though understandable, bespoke a lack of integrity as well as a lack of regard for the very community-norms that she allowed herself to be so praised for upholding, and she therefore cannot be said to have behaved rightly in not turning herself in. 
Of course, the de rigueur response is that such considerations are irrelevant, since we have to consider the hypothetical as it is presented to us, not as it might be were it real. But moral injunctions derive their force from their ability to hold up when the facts continue to pile on. It is easy to fabricate some context in which it would benefit one more to skip out on a debt than to pay it; but the moral injunction derives its practical forces from the hard-learned lessons about the consequences of not paying one’s debts, the same being true of the moral injunction to turn oneself in for crimes for which one simply ‘knows’ one would otherwise not be held responsible. 
2. After watching the second part of the video case (i.e., “part 3), do you think you made the right choice for Julia? That is, does part 3 change anything for you? 
It does not. If anything, the fact that the other driver was drunk means that, from a purely utilitarian perspective, Julia should have turned herself in. For had she done so, she would have been commended for her honesty and probably also legally exonerated. But as it stands, she is a liar and law-breaker, her decision puts on the wrong side not only of universalist but also quite possible of utilitarian conceptions of morality. 
3. Please indicate whether your decision in 1. is more consistent with utilitarianism or universalism, and explain why. 
Assuming for argument’s sake that the various beneficiaries of Julia’s teaching and charitable deeds really did depend on her specifically for assistance, then her decision to skip out taking responsibility for her crime is justifiable from a utilitarian perspective, the reason being that the more would suffer than would benefit from her going to jail or otherwise losing her ability to continue her charitable work. From a Kantian or Universalist perspective, according to which moral laws are inviolable and are not mere means to desired ends, then, of course, her conduct was immoral. That said, if psychological and sociological realities are taken into account, it is less than clear that the utilitarian and universalist verdicts would differ. In all likelihood, the loss of self-respect that Julia would like experience might well undermine her moral fiber and, for that reason, her ability and willingness to continue her work. Also, in all likelihood, there would be people who could step into the breech if she had to stop her work. People have great respect for people who take responsibility, and had Julia done so, she might well have been given a pass, and also retained her self-respect, none of which will happen if she continues the cover-up and is then found out. 
Legitimate Line Extensions as an 
Alternative to Front-businesses 
The Solution to the Pizza Puzzle 
Section I. There are two ways to implement this proposal: relative to one of them, there may be a moral dilemma; and relative to the other, there is no moral dilemma. Taken one way, Brittany is proposing that high-quality pizza be given to the guests at competitive prices through a ‘front’ of sorts, this front being a hotel-service that is posing as an independent business. Taken another way, Brittany is proposing that the hotel go into the Pizza business. In other words, she is proposing a line-extension: instead of simply providing lodging and other strictly hotel-related services, the hotel will also provide pizza, doing so not just for hotel-guests but for the general public. 
Regardless of how her proposal is interpreted, the primary stakeholders are the same, these being: the hotel-owners, including shareholders and creditors, the hotel-employees, the hotel guests, and the general pizza-consuming public. If the hotel launches an independent pizza business, which sells and delivers pizza to the general public, then the general public is more of a stakeholder than it would be if the pizza-service is implemented in a purely in-house way; but it is a stakeholder either way, since it is either being given or denied a valuable service. Also, regardless of how the proposal is carried out, competitor pizza-providers are also stakeholders, with the qualification that, unlike the other stakeholders, they are negatively affected if the venture in question is a success. 
Of course, Brittany’s proposal can simply be rejected, which means that there are three options, each with distinctive effects on the various stakeholders involved. Importantly, the ethical complexion of the case depends very much on the quality and prices of the pizza being provided. But in keeping with the terms of the hypothetical, we will operate on the assumption that the pizza continues to be reasonably priced and of high 
quality.

Section II. There are three frameworks within which to evaluate the available options in this context: utilitarian, universalist, and profit-maximization. It will be argued that, in this particular case, all of these frameworks yield the same verdict, the reason being that in the long-term it is hard for a business to be profitable if it isn’t benefiting its consumers. 
Let us consider each of the three possible decisions, beginning with the decision to reject Brittany’s proposal. In that case, the hotel loses money. It probably has to raise costs in order to compensate for these losses. Customers end up being gouged, not to mention that they miss out on a nice dining experience, and the hotel loses business. 
Now let us suppose that the hotel has an inhouse pizza-service that poses as an independent business. First of all, a business’s obligation is to provide agreed upon services for agreed upon prices. If you pay me to build you a swimming pool, what matters is whether the job gets done at the agreed upon price. If I pretend to subcontract to my cousin Jerry, while in fact doing the job myself, that is irrelevant, so long as you are not being deceived as to the quality of the work being done. The only material considerations in this sort of context are (i) quality of work and (ii) payment-related agreements. (In some contexts—for example, with lawyers or financial-service providers­--there can be conflict-of-interest issues; but that is not an operative consideration in the pool-case or the pizza-case. Also, conflicts of interest are only material because they impact quality of service: a lawyer can’t effectively represent opposing parties, after all.) 
Also, in-house businesses of this kind are very common. I personally have never been to a hotel where there weren’t restaurants and sometimes other services that had their own names and branding but clearly had no existence outside of the hotel in question. Plus, if the hotel actually invests in special uniforms for the delivery-personnel and otherwise enhances branding, the effect is not so much to deceive customers as to enhance their experience. People will happily pay $200 for a $10 steak if they are also given nice service. The mark-up becomes unambiguously ethically problematic only when it is used to hide low-quality. If I charge you $200 for a steak and a show (possibly in the form of a well-attired delivery-person) and I only give you a steak, then I am in breech; but if I give you both, I am not in breech. 
From a utilitarian standpoint, this would be a respectable option; from a universalist perspective, this would be questionable, given the element of dishonesty involved; and from a profit-maximization perspective, it would be questionable, since it is not clear whether the expenses incurred would be offset by the hotel’s own pizza-consuming base. 
Consequently, the ideal path here would be to create a pizza service that also services the general public. This would eliminate any hint of dishonesty and would also broaden the service’s customer-base, which would help defray the various sunk costs involved in purchasing the uniforms, doing in-house promotion, and the like. Also, there would be little reason not to go this route, since most of the work, including the branding as well as product-creation, would already have been done. This approach, assuming that it was properly carried out, would therefore be optimal from all three of the perspectives in question, granting, of course, that no business venture can be known with certainty to succeed. 
As for the null path, that of simply rejecting Brittany’s offer, that would be safe in the short-term but would eat into the hotel’s bottom line and would also cut the hotel out of a potentially lucrative market, while also depriving the public of a great pizza. 
This case helps us weigh in on the debate between John Mackay and Milton Friedman, Friedman’s position being that a business’s sole concern is to profit, since the ‘invisible hand’ of the market will take care of any ethical problems involved, and Mackay’s position being that a business has to meet the market half-way when it comes to holding itself to ethical norms. Ultimately, Mackay’s position is the right one. Businesses do not profit by being ethical; they profit by giving their customers what they want. If the general public wants toxic waste and assassins-for-hire, businesses can profit by providing these unethical services. 
Friedman seems to hold that transactional ethics are identical with ethics in general, which they often are but sometimes are not. Economists, including Kenneth Arrow and Amartya Sen, have focused a great deal in the last few decades on negative ‘externalities’ which the market’s invisible hand does not do a very good job of mitigating, an externality being an unintended by-product of an economic transaction. Heavy industry generates pollution; for-profit prisons incentivize the manufacturing of crime; and unregulated agriculture incentivizes the creation of cheap but unhealthy foods. These are all examples of externalities, and the free market has not been proven to do as good a job of mitigating them as Friedman and other free-marketeers hold. This means that it is incumbent either on government regulation or the moral integrity of business-owners to do damage control. 
Another problem that Friedman overlooks is that, when not restrained either by ethics or law, businesses tend to collude with government. The government is staffed by human beings who need to eat and pay rent, the same being true of businesses; and it is only to be expected that, given the opportunity, businesses will do their best to use the government to shut out competitors and also to insulate themselves from the law. Realistically speaking, if someone is running a $20,000,000,000 business, they are likely to make donations to politicians, who in their turn will be expected to curb regulatory and law-enforcement agencies. Without either government regulation or personal integrity on the part of executives, it is likely that such collusion will rise to unacceptable levels. 
All of this said, Friedman’s position is still more true than false and isn’t as opposed to Mackay’s position as it initially seems to be. A business that is focused only on the bottom line is likely in the long run to do shoddy work and therefore to fail financially. If the public detests you and your product, which they will if you are ill-serving them and also squeezing out competitors, it will be hard to stay afloat, even with government cooperation. The reason is simply that the economy is much too large even for the government to control, this being why Enron and Bernie Madoff and Lehman Brothers, came to a screeching and disastrous halt. Each was ‘chummy’ with regulators, but there is only so much regulators can do to pacify shareholders who have lost everything. So yes—Friedman is probably right that economic rationality probably does eliminate many negative externalities, but he also probably overestimates the extent to which economic actors are long-term rational. 

Section III. I would choose to create the pizza service, complete with new branding, and would at least offer it to the general public, so as to offset the possible element of dishonesty and also to test market-demand for what might prove to be a lucrative product. The hotel has already gone to the trouble of creating a pizza that is as good as that of its competitors. If it takes no action, it will continue to lose money, which decision would be a loser relative to each of the moral frameworks in question. 
At the same time, if it goes to the trouble of buying special outfits for delivery personnel, giving them the requisite training, and so on, then it might as offer the pizza to the general public, since it would at that point have created the product and branding; and if it wanted to offer the product to the public, it would be all but ready to do so, give or take some non-trivial but manageable concerns relating to delivery and production-capacity. 
This would be 100% honest and, if successful, would maximize the benefit to all of the stakeholders. Further, there is already proof-of-product, meaning that the hotel’s pizza is already known to be good; and, of course, all of the investment in machinery and personnel is already at this point sunk, making a maximum-value approach advisable. Of course, the do-nothing approach is an option, but businesses that shirk from opportunities to grow tend to die, and it also isn’t clear that it is an option for the hotel, given how much it is already losing in pizza-based revenue. In conclusion, the line-extension option, involving a real pizza business servicing both hotel guests and non-guests, is from all the relevant perspectives the indicated path. 
Why is Sartre’s later work so bad? Response to “Human all too human: Sartre” (http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=4G4R_iAZWbQ) 
The video-series (“Human all too human: Sartre”) made a number of striking facts about Sartre’s life clear. First, he initially very much seemed to try to live in accordance with his own existentialism. He very much tried to live freely and not to surrender his identity to cultural norms or to other people’s expectations of him. I have read Being and Nothingness many times, and the purity and simplicity of its message is striking: Be free or be fake. That is its message. And it’s not just asserting it; it is providing a credible metaphysical defense of it. 
The idea is that mind, being representational, must be a kind of cavity­--or ‘nothingness’—into which the rest of the world is able to reflect itself. Were the mind as much a ‘fullness’ as other beings, so it is argued, then it wouldn’t have the reflectiveness (or ‘intentionality’, to use Brentano’s term, which Sartre also uses) characteristic of mind. Being a kind of non-being, so to speak, mind is not subject to the usual determinisms that govern the rest of reality and is therefore inherently free, attempts on our part to believe otherwise being so much ‘bad faith’, as Sartre puts it. 
This reasoning, though obviously questionable, is impressive; and even if it does not itself go through, the proposition that Sartre is attempting to establish—namely, that if we don’t live freely, then we aren’t really living at all—can and should be accepted. 
The video seemed to suggest that, for a while, Sartre himself did accept this, his acceptance of it being manifested in the creativity and originality of his brilliant early works, such as Nausea (1938) and Being and Nothingness (1943). But then, it seems to me, he ceased to accept it. This happened in two phases. First, his acceptance of it assumed degraded forms: instead of continuing to be an iconoclastic thinker, he became a rather garden-variety debauched party-boy, drinking to excess and carrying on with, and therefore presumably manipulating, multiple women at the same time. Many philosophers, including very ancient ones such as Confucius, have been quick to distinguish between genuine freedom, on the one hand, and mere self-indulgence, on the other. At some point, Sartre’s behavior down­shifted from the one to the other. The cause, I suspect, was the extreme success of his early work, which turned him into an icon, which in turn made him self-important and soft. Note that all of the works of his that are still read were published at the very beginning of his career: Nausea (1938), The Imagination (1940), Being and Nothingness (1943), and No Exit (1940). In addition to being his best works and to being the ones for which he is still famous, they are also the ones that catapulted him to fame. 
But after he became famous, his work deteriorated. Although he published quite a lot during the 50s, the only work of his from that period that is at all widely read is Existentialism is a Humanism, which, though it makes some good points, is just a 20 page, watered down version of Being and Nothingness. To its credit, it does contain the famous phrase: existence precedes essence, which, as Star Trek fans know, was paraphrased as “existence precedes programming” by a robot that became self-aware and consequently became free. In any case, Sartre’s 1950s work simply didn’t have the same ‘zip’ as his earlier work. 
The second phase of Sartre’s degeneration was his descent into Marxism. First of all, Marxism seems to be the opposite of Sartre’s existentialism. The basic precept of existentialism is: you are free to choose your own fate—indeed, you have no choice but to do so. The basic precept of Marxism is: You are not free to choose your own fate, since your socioeconomic status has already decided it for you. (Later versions of Marxism would say that your gender, sexual orientation, and ethnicity, as well as your socioeconomic status, co-determine your life-situation.) So it is deeply unclear how an existentialist can also be a Marxist. 
Sartre spent the 1960s and 1970s trying to reconcile existentialism and Marxism, his main effort in this direction being a giant work called Critique of Dialectical Reasoning. I personally don’t know whether this work has merit. I have made several attempts to read it, but simply found it boring and unintelligible; and I was struck by the contrast with his fast-paced and highly readable early works. 
The video does a good job of discussing this part of Sartre’s career. The one interviewee really nailed it when he said that Sartre’s Marxism was really about his ceasing to be the upstart that he once was and becoming a member of a tired old establishment. In other words, Sartre’s Marxism, though superficially about him being a rebel, was about him selling out. And it was this loss of his old existentialism-based identity that made his later work so boring. His early work had one focus: existentialism. His later work had two foci: existentialism and Marxism—which meant it had no focus, which made it incoherent and therefore boring. 
Summary and Analysis of The Yellow Wallpaper 
This story is told from the viewpoint of a highly emotionally sensitive woman, who in times past would have been classified as ‘neurasthenic’, meaning, in effect, that she had a persistent case of ‘raw nerves.’ The woman lives in a room by herself. She never seems to leave the room, even though it is a part of a large house, which is also occupied by her husband. Her husband is a medical doctor and is also functioning, ominously, as her personal medical doctor—more specifically, as her psychiatrist. (And, like many psychiatrists, he is not, it turns out, a particularly good one.) It is clear from the beginning of the story that the woman is emotionally troubled and, at the very least, extremely neurotic. 
But there is a great deal about her condition that is not clear. It is not clear whether she is basically a normal, if highly sensitive woman, who has experienced a bit of emotional throttling or, on the contrary, whether she has a had full-on psychotic break with reality. At the beginning of the story, we are led to believe that she is more on the neurotic side of the spectrum, but at the end it is revealed by that she is very much at the psychotic extreme. 
The story consists for the most part of the woman’s pondering her husband’s alleged failure to have a genuinely emotional, as opposed to narrowly clinical, understanding of her condition. Her husband has very clearly written her off as a demented woman, who, for reasons of protocol, must be tolerated and treated with a certain degree of civility but not sympathized with or respected. The woman’s grievances about her husband prove to be justified, and as the story progresses, it begins to emerge that her complaints about him are seriously understated, as he is driven not by cold professionalism but by ill-will and hatred towards his wife. 
At the same time, the woman’s mental condition is increasingly clearly that of somebody who is completely psychotic, as is evidenced by her fixation with, and delusions concerning, the peeling yellow wallpaper in her room, which represents her unravelling soul. 
At the end of the story, it is revealed that, contrary to what the woman herself has believed all along and also to what the reader has assumed, the woman is a prisoner and is simply trapped in that room—much as, so it is suggested, she is trapped in her own madness. 
Summary and Analysis of James 
Baldwin’s Sonny’s Blues 
This is a story about a schoolteacher, who is the narrator, and his younger heroin-addicted brother Sonny. The story starts with the narrator reading in the newspaper that Sonny had been arrested in a drug-sting. The narrator later finds out from mutual acquaintances that Sonny will be released from jail after he ‘detoxes.’ 
It is clear from the very beginning of the story that the narrator’s relationship with Sonny is weak and ambiguous, with occasional spasms of concern and interest. With the passage of time, the narrator’s heart has softened, partly because his own daughter died and left him with an emotional need for family, and he writes a letter to Sonny, asking to reunite. They do so, but constantly fight, mainly because the brother wants to be allowed to continue to live his bohemian life, heroin-addiction included, and the narrator, being a by-the-book schoolteacher, sees little legitimacy in such a lifestyle. The narrator eventually finds out that Sonny is a talented pianist who has made a name for himself in the local jazz scene. This greatly increases his respect for Sonny and makes him more willing to accept Sonny into his life. 
Dialogue about Sonny’s Blues and The Yellow Wallpaper 
Smith: Brown! How are you, my friend? How did you like those two stories? 
Brown: I very much liked The Yellow Wallpaper (YP). I’m not sure how I felt about Sonny’s Blues (SB). 
Smith: When you say “not sure…”, do you actually mean you’re not sure? Or are you politely saying that it didn’t work for you? 
Brown: It didn’t work for me. 
Smith: That’s surprising, because I know you like non-fiction, or non-fiction-like, stories about wayward lifestyles and the gritty realities they involve. 
Brown: I do. But SB didn’t work for me. 
Smith: Why not? 
Brown: First of all, the main character---the narrator—was boring. He had a boring outlook, and I got the feeling that his job was just a kind of prop. And I didn’t really know what he was supposed to represent. 
Smith: I can kind of see that. 
Brown: On the one hand, he was supposed to be this square schoolteacher, which I can certainly understand. But then there were these weird flashes of bitterness about racial injustice, among other things, that, although morally justified, had no real foundation in the character. They just came out of the blue. 
Smith: I got that feeling myself. The main character was supposed to be a blank—a mirror that reflected reality---but sometimes he would stop being a blank and would go into an angry political mode, which, however justified historically, didn’t cohere with the rest of the character’s personality. 
Brown: Yes, frankly, I felt that way too. I didn’t really know what the story was about. I mean, there were really only two characters: the main one, who was just kind of a run-of-the-mill narrator, and Sonny, who, apart from his piano-talent, had no particularly good or interesting qualities. 
Smith: Yes, and there seemed to be an understanding to the effect that all of this was a consequence of racism, or some such, and maybe it was. But if the story is just considered on its own terms—if it’s just read as a story about a man and his brother, rather than as a political diatribe—it doesn’t really work very well. 
Brown: No, it doesn’t. Not in my view, anyway. And there was undischarged premise there, something to the effect that Sonny was a lost soul who would not have been lost in a non-racist society. Which may or may not be true and which, in any case, didn’t really make for very engaging reading, I’m sorry to say. 
Smith: What about YP? What did you think of that? 
Brown: That one I very much liked. 
Smith: Which is ironic, given that you’re a male and the main character isn’t. 
Brown: Yes, that’s an irony, I suppose. But I still liked it. 
Smith: Because..? 
Brown: Because it was realistic. Especially the way the woman’s delusions were intertwined with accurate emotional perceptions. 
Smith: Explain please. 
Brown: Ok. So obviously the woman’s belief that she lived in the wallpaper, or whatever her delusion was, was indeed a delusion. But her beliefs about her husband’s emotional disposition towards her was accurate. 
Smith: That makes sense. 
Brown: And I think what drove her insane was her awareness, her unconscious awareness, of her husband’s actual feelings. 
Smith: So was it the fact that she was aware of her husband’s feelings that drove her mad, or was it the fact that she was unconsciously aware of her husband’s feeling? 
Brown: The latter. If she had known, consciously and lucidly, what her husband was really about, it would not have driven her mad, since frank acceptances of ugly realities, though unpleasant, don’t undermine mental health. 
Smith: So it was the fact that she was aware of her husband’s actual disposition towards her but couldn’t admit it. 
Brown: Right, she couldn’t admit it---except by going into a kind of perpetual dream-like state. 
Smith: You’re referring to her psychosis. 
Brown: Yes, psychosis being, as Freud said, a prolonged waking dream. 
Smith: Hoo boy! 
Brown: Yes, it’s heavy. That’s why I liked the story. 
Smith: You liked it because it was heavy, or because it was accurate? 
Brown: It wouldn’t have been heavy if it had not been psychologically accurate. 
Smith: Good point, Brown. Good point. 
The Purpose of Fiction 
Albert Camus is reported to have said that “fiction is a lie through which we tell the truth.”[170] 
Before taking this class, my position on fiction was that it was just a lie, albeit a harmless and entertaining one. I have always enjoyed reading science fiction, for example; and I have always been an avid 
movie buff, albeit of the unsophisticated type who prefers Spielberg to Fellini. And had it not been for this class, this would still be my position. 
But it isn’t. To be honest, I took this class because I had to. But after I read the first few stories, I experienced a major shift. I remember the very moment when it happened. It was when I was reading “Young Goodman Brown” that it occurred to me: fiction isn’t fiction! Fiction is a way that we confront that which we could not otherwise confront. What is “Young Goodman Brown” about? There is a young man who has absurdly simplistic views about his wife and, indeed, the rest of humanity. He assumes that they are all magically free of the impulses that he knows himself to have. Goodman Brown is, by all accounts, a decent person; but he is indeed a person—a biological organism, with aggressive and libidinal urges—and he is surely guilty of a certain degree of self-deception in assuming his wife and other community members to be the paragons of purity that they make themselves out to be. 
And that is the whole point of the story. He sets out on a journey and discovers that his wife and fellow villagers are all ‘Satanists.’ Then he wakes up! It was all a dream! But, of course, it wasn’t. What does it mean, after all, to say that his (appropriately named) beloved wife Faith is a ‘Satanist’? What does it mean, really, to say that anybody is a ‘Satanist’? It means that they are a human being. People have religions that force them to be pure because they are not pure; and they are not pure not because they are categorically evil, but because human beings are four parts animal and one part human (if that makes any sense); and the human side of us knows that, if we are to live in harmony, we must suppress our animalistic side, this being one of the functions of religion and also of law. A ‘Satanist’ is somebody who makes a point of publicly acknowledging that we are more animal than we care to admit; and since each of us has no choice but to admit this, if only to ourselves, we are all, after a fashion, Satanists. 
So the point of “Young Goodman Brown” is really that human beings are indeed more ‘human’---or sub-human, depending on how you look at it— then people care to admit. It was when I was finishing reading this story that I realized---that the point of fiction is to disclose, not to hide. Playing Devil’s Advocate, I asked myself: ‘But if that is true, why didn’t Hawthorne just come out and say what I just said?’ 
‘Suppose he had done so,’ I answered. ‘If he had done that, he would have just produced a boring treatise that wouldn’t resonate with people.’ 
People don’t respond to theories particularly well, sometimes because they are emotionally resistant to them but usually because they are too abstract and don’t connect with people in the same experiential way as stories. 
But then I realized there was another objection to my theory: ‘If writing is about baring the depths of the human psyche,’ I asked myself, ‘why don’t writers just stick to true crime and other non-fiction genres?’ This one stumped me for a while, partly because I myself used to be an avid true crime reader. But then it hit me: true crime describes what only a few people do, but fiction describes how everybody feels. The people described in true crime books are mentally ill, and usually quite devoid of morality, and their acts are not merely about garden-variety impulses coming to the surface; they are also about a lack of morality specific to such people. So when we read about criminals and serial killers, we aren’t really getting the whole story: we are certainly witnessing the deprave side of humanity, but we aren’t seeing the conflicts to which it gives rise in most people. 
But that is what we are seeing in “Young Goodman Brown.” Faith is not Ted Bundy; she is not a monster. She is a normal person, with an animalistic side and a moral side, the same being true, to varying degrees, of Goodman Brown’s townsfolk and of Goodman Brown himself. And if we just focus on non-fiction—on history, on what people have done—we don’t see the conflicts; we don’t see the really important part of the story. It is only through fiction that we see the inner story. 
Many years ago, when I was in high school, I read “Bartleby the Scrivener.” I had not the slightest idea what it was about, the reason being that, back then, the whole idea that fiction was about exposing psychological realities was alien to me. But this time, I understood it. In the years since high school, I have known people on the autism spectrum; and I have known people who, though not autistic, retreated into Bartleby-like cocoons of isolation. The people I am thinking of actually ended up having Bartleby-like jobs, one as a paralegal, the other as a statistician in the bowels of an investment bank. Both acted like Bartleby; they were rigid and unbelievably stubborn. When I read “Bartleby”, I realized that they were deeply angry; and since they were so powerless, all they could do was refuse to do as told. 
If I had been told this before re-reading Bartleby in the context of this class, I would simply have laughed. But I now see it as a simple truth—one that I had to be told through fiction to grasp. 
The story that struck me the most in this class was Kafka’s “The Hunger Artist.” Like the other two stories just discussed, this one is realistic enough that we can relate it to personal experience while being just so skewed that we see the emotional realities beneath the familiar surfaces. We are all familiar with the term ‘starving artist’ and also with the corresponding concept. And in many ways, what is being described in Kafka’s story is very normal: there is an artist—or ‘freak’, depending on how you look at it---being jeered at by an unappreciative public. So far, so good; and at first, I thought the point of this story was just that artists are not understood by their peers. But then when I read it a second time, and then a third, I realized that Kafka, though himself an artist, was not on the side of the artist in his story. Kafka seemed to have contempt for him. Kafka’s attitude towards the Starving Artist is similar to his attitude towards Gregor Samsa: he sees the latter as a cockroach, and that is how he sees the former. He sees both as fussy and small, and his story exposes a streak of narcissism and grandiosity in the so-called ‘starving artist’---none of which he could have done, at least not so poignantly, had he expressed himself through theories or through non­fictional descriptions of actual human beings. 
What I have learned in this class, therefore, is that, whereas non­fiction tells the truth about the outer, fiction tells the truth about the inner. Fiction is not, I now realize, mere entertainment. It is the most transparent window we have into the soul, and that is why all civilizations hold their myths and fables in such high regard. 
Summaries with Analysis of Ibsen’s A Doll’s House and Hawthorn’s Young Goodman Brown 
Summary of A Doll’s House: Nora Helmer, wife of banker Torvald Helmer, is living grandly, spending lavishly on Christmas presents and other non-necessaries. Her husband takes note and is put off by this, but on the surface continues to seem loving. 
Ms. Linde, a friend of Nora’s, comes by the house and asks Nora to 
persuade Torvald to get her (Ms. Linde) a job at his bank. She needs the money, she explains, because her recently deceased husband left her penniless. Nora discloses to Ms. Linde that, with the collusion of a bank employee named Krogstad, she (Nora) had fraudulently obtained a loan, which she used to help Torvald, who was ill at the time, go on a medically necessary vacation. 
Krogstad drops by and reveals that he knows that Torvald, who is his boss, is going to fire him; and he says that unless Nora convinces him not to do so, he will reveal her crime to Torvald. Despite Nora’s best efforts, Norvald fires Krogstad and he sends a letter outing Nora to Torvald. 
It turns out that Krogstad was previously in a serious relationship with Ms. Linde and is still in love with her, despite being angry that she dumped him for a (now deceased) wealthier man. Ms. Linde nonetheless manages to reactivate her relationship with Krogstad. It is not entirely clear why she does so, but the supposed reason is to convince Krogstad not to bring the law down on Nora. 
Nora succeeds in softening Krogstad’s heart, and he drops the whole matter. But the damage is done, since Torvald has read the letter and, without formally divorcing Nora, emotionally disowns her. 
Nora then realizes that her marriage with Torvald was a fraud, as he never had any real emotional connection to her and kept her on only as a trophy-doll for his perfect dollhouse-life. She then realizes that she must be the master of her own life if she is to be happy. 
Summary of Young Goodman Brown: Recently married Goodman Brown, an earnest young man, announces to his wife, Faith, that he must go on a long journey on foot in the forest. She begs him not to go, telling him how dangerous such an expedition might be; but he goes anyway. In the woods, he crosses paths with Satan. While walking and talking, Goodman Brown and the Devil cross paths with many friends of Goodman’s from back in his home village, all of whom, it turns out, are Satanists who are en route to a Luciferian gathering of some kind. When it turns out that Faith is one of these Satanists, Goodman wakes up: It was all a dream! 
Analysis of both stories: Both stories are about growing up and parting with childish fictions about other people’s motivations. More specifically, each story is about a member of the one gender finding out about the motivations of members of the other gender. Torvald cares about status and he wants a trophy wife. Nora idiotically thought that he loved her, but he was actually just using her. For Torvald, Nora was simply a kind of animate ‘doll.’ 
Goodman Brown thought that his wife was pure and innocent. But she wasn’t--not because she is a bad person, but because she is indeed a person, and a ‘pure’ person is a biological impossibility. Some people are more ethical than others, but people are people---not ‘dolls’ that do and think what we want them to. 
Goodman Brown, being a male, wants a woman who burns with passion for him but is otherwise pure. But this is not possible, not because Faith is a bad person, but because passion of its very nature follows its own dark ways. Nora Helmer wants a husband who, in addition to being a money-and status-obsessed banker, also loves and cherishes Nora. But this is not possible, not because he has no love to give, but because love, being an emotion, necessarily brings many other emotions in its wake and therefore has no place in the Kabuki-theatre, dollhouse-life that Nora wanted. 
BCG Matrix Bulletin Points 

Stars 

*Grow rapidly in high-growth markets and are therefore by far the best possible investment, if you are lucky enough to identify one. *Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, and E-trade used to be stars, but are now cash cows (see below), owing to maturation of their respective markets. *Tend to be monopolies or semi-monopolies. Consider Amazon/Microsoft. *Because they are on the bleeding edge of growth, they tend to have aggressive and original marketing schemes, unlike cash cows, which tend to stick with the tried and true. 
Cash Cows 

*Grow predictably and slowly. *Good place to park assets, since they have reliable rates of return that exceed the usual savings account rates. *They focus on retention more than acquisition, since they are already in mature, low-growth markets. *Examples: Kellogg’s, Coca Cola, Disney. 

Question Marks *Rapid growth companies with small market shares: hence their ambiguous status. *Examples might be Coinbase, Express VPN, and TuneCore. *Smart investors scrutinize these, since they are likely to be overlooked but are promising. Likely to be miscategorized as dogs by mediocre investors. *A question mark is best advised to find a way to carve out a niche for itself, since there is no way that it can compete on size. 

*Low growth companies in low growth markets. *Examples: Sears, Kodak, any local cab business, any mom and pop that tries to compete with Jiffy Lube. *Often on the wrong side of technological change; for example, Sears is on the wrong side of the e-commerce revolution. *Investors are advised to stay away.

Dennett and Skinner on the Human 
Condition 
Response to “Reading Minds” 
(http://www.youtube.com/watch? 
v=8jc8URRxPIg) 
and “Neuroscience and Free Will” 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch? 
v=VnGDrc_s6KA) 
For me, the take-home from the B.F. Skinner video (“Operant Condition”) was how shallow a thinker Skinner was. True: gambling is compulsive, addiction-mediated behavior, and such behavior is indeed reflexive. That is why we regard it as animalistic, and that is also why B.F. Skinner was discussing it. Skinner’s theory is that all behavior is reflexive: no intelligence or rationality is involved. And compulsive, addiction-driven behavior is certainly more consistent with that theory than is non-addiction­driven, non-compulsive behavior. But the very fact that Skinner had to use a degenerate and reflexive form of behavior, such as gambling, in order to substantiate his theory shows how bankrupt that theory is. 
As for the other video---“Consciousness and Free Will”---I was underwhelmed. Dennett goes on and on about how ‘people’ think that ‘consciousness is just so wonderful’, and he repeatedly says how stunted and misguided such people are. And maybe he’s right. But he doesn’t ever explain how to explain consciousness—at least not in that video and also not in his book consciousness Explained—which, though an extremely intelligent and informative book, does not so much explain consciousness as attempt to deny it. Which, of course, is implausible as well as self-refuting, given that, without consciousness, there are no denials or hallucinations or mistakes. 
Dennett 
made 
one 
point 
that 
struck 
me 
as 
totally 
false. 
He 
says 
that 
it 
is 
because 
people 
believe 
in 
free 
will 
that 
they 
believe 
consciousness 
to 
be 
unexplainable. 
That 
is 
not 
accurate, 
at 
least 
categorically. 
If 
decisions 
are 
the 
result 
of 
causal 
mechanisms, 
then 
either 
we 
don’t 
have 
free 
will, 
whatever 
that 
means, 
or 
we 
have 
it 
only 
in 
some 
attenuated 
sense. 
And 
if 
decisions 
are 
not 
the 
result 
of 
causal 
mechanisms, 
then 
those 
decisions 
have 
no 
roots 
in 
who 
we 
are 
and 
would 
therefore 
seem 
to 
be 
disruptions 
of 
freedom, 
like 
an 
epileptic, 
rather 
than 
expressions 
of 
it. 
One 
can 
believe 
all 
of 
that, 
as 
I 
do, 
while 
also 
believing 
that 
it 
is 
difficult 
if 
not 
impossible 
to 
explain 
psychological 
truths 
in 
terms 
of 
strictly 
physical 
truths. 
It 
may 
be 
that 
a 
desire 
to 
believe 
that 
we 
are 
free 
contributes 
a 
certain 
degree 
of 
emotional 
resistance 
to 
attempts 
a-la-Dennett 
to 
explain 
away 
consciousness. 
But 
I 
think 
the 
real 
resistance 
has 
to 
do 
with 
the 
fact 
that 
Dennett 
hasn’t 
yet 
actually 
given 
us 
an 
explanation 
of 
consciousness—he 
has 
just 
berated 
people 
who 
hold 
onto 
the 
idea 
that 
it 
is 
unexplainable. 
And 
contrary 
to 
what 
Dennett 
says, 
consciousness 
does 
seem 
to 
be 
uniquely 
unexplainable. 
If 
one 
considers 
a 
living 
brain, 
or 
any 
other 
biological 
system, 
there 
are 
obviously 
many 
unusually 
hard 
to 
explain 
problems 
of 
a 
purely 
biological 
kind. 
But 
so 
long 
as 
we 
are 
dealing 
with 
purely 
biological 
mechanisms, 
e.g. 
respiration, 
we 
are 
just 
dealing 
with 
garden-variety 
cause 
and 
effect. 
We 
are 
not 
having 
to 
deal 
with 
awareness 
or 
any 
other 
form 
of 
subjectivity, 
and 
explanation 
can 
therefore 
ultimately 
assume 
the 
form 
of 
identifying 
the 
relevant 
pushes 
and 
pulls, 
so 
to 
speak. 
But 
not 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
consciousness 
or 
any 
other 
aspect 
of 
the 
mental: 
I 
can 
understand 
exactly 
what 
is 
going 
on 
a 
given 
person’s 
brain 
without, 
for 
that 
very 
reason, 
having 
even 
the 
slightest 
idea 
what, 
if 
anything, 
is 
going 
on 
in 
his 
mind. 
It 
may 
be 
that 
consciousness 
and, 
more 
generally, 
mind 
are 
explainable; 
but 
if 
so, 
Dennett 
hasn’t 
said 
why. 
Do 
we 
have 
free 
will? 
Response 
to 
“Operant 
Conditioning” 
(http://www.youtube.com/watch? 
v=I_ctJqjlrHA) “Consciousness and Free Will” (http://www.youtube.com/watch? 
v=PyWfVyoz7BQ) 

The obvious response to have to the first video (“Reading Your Mind”) is to ask alarmist questions about the police using this technology to read our minds and destroy any last vestiges of freedom and privacy that we have. But in my view, the really relevant questions concern the educational (and, to a lesser extent, diagnostic) possibilities of this technology. If we knew exactly what kinds of thoughts people had in response to a given quantum of information, we could streamline education, and also customize it to fit a given person’s cognitive profile; and it looks as though this technology, when developed, will make this possible. 
As for the concerns about the state using this technology to raid our psyches—that’s certainly possible, but it’s also extremely unlikely. The reasons for this have nothing to do with human nature: human beings obviously can and will do whatever they can to control people and would gladly use this technology. The reasons have to do entirely with the enormous costs involved in doing so, coupled with the latest projections about the world’s oil supply. The relevant question, I stress, is: how can we use this technology to optimize teaching? 
As for the video about free will (“Neuroscience and Free Will”), that too was illuminating, with the qualification that it wasn’t the topic of free will that was illuminated. The question ‘do we have free will?’ is very vague, and the short answer seems to be ‘no.’ The long answer seems to be something along the lines of: ‘no…but if your various psychological faculties are working with one another, instead of grinding up against one another, then you can have something that, although not quite what we mean when we talk about “free will”, has many of the same virtues.’ All of that said, the video made it clear just how much of our mental activity is unconscious or semi­conscious, and that is the respect in which it was illuminating.

“The Pre-Socratics: Part 3” (http://www.youtube.com/watch? 
v=qVrwRHSIRIg) 

It seems to me that there are many different versions of the so-called “problem of the one and the many.” From what I can gather, the original version of this problem is given by the question: “What is it that unifies the various different parts of the universe? In other words, in virtue of what fact are the various different objects in the universe—the various animals and particles and planets and so on—components of a single universe, as opposed to multiple different universes?” 
Physics has already answered this question. Any two events are causally connected. (Any two events either have common causal origins or one is part of a causal chain that is responsible for the other.) If there is absolutely no conceivable causal connection between two events---if there is no possible causal process either directly linking them or linking them by way of some third event---then it simply makes no sense to say that they belong to the same universe. 
Relativity Theory made this position popular, at least among physicists, the reason being that, in Relativity Theory, chronological relations are defined in terms of causal relations. (e1 is said to pre-date e2 if and only if e1 can have a causal influence on e2; and e1 and e2 are said to be simultaneous if neither can have a causal influence on the other.) But it seems to me that, at some level, all people must accept it, since it seems incoherent to suppose that two events could be totally causally divorced from each other but belong to the same universe. 
In any case, when I was watching the videos about Parmenides and Thales, it occurred to me that, when people refer to “the problem of the one and may” there is a second problem that they sometimes have in mind. Thales said that everything is water, and Parmenides said that, despite appearances, nothing changes. The first view is false, and the second is not only false but absurd. But it seems to me that both of these hypotheses embody the insight that a few immutable natural laws are responsible for the various changes that occur in the universe; and when people refer to “the problem of the one and the many”, they are sometimes referring to the question: What are these laws? In other words, what are the unchanging principles underneath and responsible for the various changes that occur?” Once again, this question, though presented in this context as a philosophical question, is one that can only be answered on scientific grounds, through observation and experimentation and the like, and that has been answered to a considerable extent. 
What do we have that chimps don’t? Response to : “Ape Genius” (https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=wg-mPjhCnc8) 
The purpose of the video was supposedly to explain exactly how human beings were superior to chimpanzees. As it itself put it, it was to answer the question: Why do human study chimps, not the other way around? 
The video didn’t really answer this question, though it did hazard a guess, albeit 45 minutes into it. The mike-dropper of an answer that it gave was: 
(TA) “Humans teach each other, but chimps don’t, and chimps therefore have to learn everything they know on their own.” 
“TA” is short for ‘their answer.’ 
TA is not plausible. Chimps don’t teach each other because they can’t. Human beings do we because we can. So TA takes a mere consequence of the relevant difference between people and chimps to be the very the essence of that difference. 
If TA were correct then, if chimps started teaching one another, they would come to be human-like in their intellectual proportions and configuration---even if everything else about them were held constant. But, of course, such a counterfactual is either trivial or absurd, depending on how it is looked at. It’s trivial if it is supposed that chimps magically acquired the ability to teach one another, and it is absurd if it is supposed that they could have this ability without acquiring the various abilities—had by us and lacked by them--underlying it. 
So yes—chimps are smarter than most people are inclined to believe. The video proved this much. But no---it isn’t because people do, whereas chimps don’t, teach one another that we are able to study them but they are not able to study us. It’s the other away around: it is because we are able to study them, whereas they cannot study us, that we can teach one another, whereas chimps cannot. 
So what is the difference between us and them? One point the video made that was important is that the difference is not strictly quantitative. It isn’t just that we have more brain-cells. There is some kind of existential divide that we are on one side of and that chimps are on the other side of. 
That divide, I would suggest, is the ability to interact with reality through symbolism. Consider what we are doing in this very class and indeed in the context of this very assignment. We are exchanging symbols with one another. Most of us don’t even know what most of the rest of us even look like. But that doesn’t matter, because, unlike chimps, we don’t need to look at one another’s facial expressions and bodily behavior to communicate, since we, unlike chimps, have language at our disposal. And not just language, but a plurality of representational media: different kinds of visual art, different kinds of non-visual art, specialized mathematical and technical notations, not to mention ad hoc codes---none of which chimps have. 
The video obscured this point when it showed the chimp supposedly ‘adding one’, which, supposing that it did in fact do so, it did by tapping on a now blank part of the screen that previously had a numeral one. The problem with this supposed proof is that the ability to ‘add one’ is one of the only forms of mathematical competence that can be mimicked by pretty much any creature. Could the chimp have multiplied by three? Or divided by four? What about exponentiation? No. Of course, not. Unless a creature can interact through symbols, as opposed to mere gestures, it doesn’t even make sense to suppose that it is computing square roots or multiplying by fractions. Contrariwise, if one wants to prove that one’s St. Bernard is a mathematician, the best one can do is prove that it can ‘add one.’ 
Chimps have plenty of intelligence, as do cats and dogs and squirrels. Anyone who has had a cat knows how incredibly intuitive they are, not to mention how surgically precise their movements are. And the same can be said of chimps and terriers and pretty much all mammals, as well as many non-mammals. But there is some line that separates us from them, and that line is not the ability to teach one another; it is the ability to grasp meanings, as opposed to objects, which is a conconmitant of the ability to understand symbols. A consequence of this ability is the ability to engage in certain forms of mutual instructions, but it is not mutual instruction that separates us from them. 
Also, chimps do teach one another, at least so far as they non-symbolic relation to reality allows them to. In the following article, published in 2014 and therefore after the video, it is shown that chimps do teach 
one 
another: 
https://www.livescience.com/48078-chimpanzees-learn­
behaviors-socially.html 
“Humanity's 
closest 
living 
relatives”, 
it 
says. 
“can 
pass on culture and customs just as humans do, shedding light on the possible capabilities of the last 
common 
ancestor 
of 
both 
humans 
and chimps, the researchers say.” 
In conclusion, the video, though informative, did not answer the question that it set out to answer, and, despite its attempt to show-case the intellectual abilities of chimpanzees, failed to give them credit for one of their most astonishing intellectual powers. 
My Questions about “Dum Dum Boys”, by Cameron Joy, pp. 109-119 
I read “Dum Dum Boys”, by Cameron Joy, a very sad story about a young man who has a good heart but also has psychological problems, which he deals with by taking drugs, causing him to overdose and die as a teenager. 
About Questions 
What was the point of this story? (Was it to illustrate the evils of drug use? Or was it rather to illustrate the fragility of human beings? Or am I wrong to 
try to find a moral agenda in it?) Was this story about adolescence or was it about 1980s-style decadence? What was Cameron’s medical condition? Was he depressed? Psychotic? What did Cameron’s death teach the narrator about life? What were the narrator’s feelings about Cameron’s death? 
Beyond Questions 
Does mental illness lead to drug use or is it the other way around? What was happening in American society when this was written that caused the sort of personal disintegration described in this story? Would this story still have as much of an impact on readers today? This story seems to be in the same genre as Less than Zero, meaning that it is a story about 1980s-style lack of moral fiber, which makes me wonder: Will people today understand this story or find it relevant? 
The Meaning of Plato’s Cave Allegory Response to (http://www.youtube.com/watch? 
v=69F7GhASOdM) 

There are two ways to understand the Allegory of the Cave. On the one hand, it can be seen as putting forth a hypothesis concerning the structure of reality. On the other hand, it can be interpreted as an attempt to ‘red pill’ people about the structure of society. 
Taken the first way, the Allegory of the Cave is saying that, although our senses give us raw data, intellect is needed to model this data appropriately and therefore to see the true structure of reality. Thus taken, this allegory has no political or social overtones and is merely a point about how 
the world is structured (it consist of visible phenomena governed by underlying and therefore invisible laws), along with an epistemological corollary (in order to understand the world, it is not enough to observe it: we must also interpret those observations, and the intellect is therefore at least as much a source of knowledge as our senses). 
Taken the second way, this allegory seems to be saying that members of society live propaganda-based lies. In this particular context, Plato does not tell us much about the nature of those lies. Indeed, it is not entirely clear that he is in fact discussing society. But his repeated use of terms like ‘prisoner’, ‘shackles’, and ‘blinded’ suggests as much. Also, having read the rest of The Republic as well as large parts of his dialogue The Laws, I do know that Plato was deeply distrustful of every stratum of society. He distrusted non-rulers, thinking them little more than animals; and he also distrusted rulers, mainly because, it seems, he himself wanted to be one (or was one) and therefore knew firsthand how untrustworthy they could be. 
The second interpretation is, I admit, highly speculative, and there is little direct textual evidence for it in the video (which was taken from The Republic, which, of course, contains a number of passages that are overtly political, as well as overtly cynical, both about politics and human nature). The first interpretation is less speculative, since, in the passage in question, Plato is explicitly saying that how reality seems is not how it is and, consequently, that it is only by analyzing appearances that one acquires actual understanding. 
The one interpretation puts this passage in line with the readings we have done from Heraclitus and Thales, the other with the excerpt that we watched from the Matrix. 
An Ethical Dilemma 
Every summer, starting when I was 11, a friend of mine and I worked at a local tennis club. (I will refer to this friend as “Jacob”, even though that is not his real name.) We both performed low-level jobs: cleaning up after club-members, sometimes picking up balls, working in the kitchen, etc. As we got older, our club-related duties began to pull apart. Being an out-doorsy, athletic sort of person, I usually preferred activities relating to golf and tennis. 
I’m a passable tennis player and golfer and have taught both. But mostly my work at the club has been pretty menial and usually involved me working as a caddy and the like—which I don’t mind, since I like being outdoors. 
Jacob’s work was very different. He always had a knack for numbers and was (and, I suppose, still is) a whiz at math and computers. Starting when we were fifteen, the summer after the 9th grade, Jacob started doing office-work at the club. They had tried to hire people to help with Quicken and other softwares, but nobody could do the job, even the ones with college degrees. As for the management, they were hopeless with anything relating to computers, as they were decidedly ‘old school’---as in, they were very old and not computer-literate. (It is a small club, which services a small, close-knit community in upstate New York.) And they didn’t even know where to begin. 
But Jacob had no problem doing this sort of thing. Plus, Jacob was the son of a well-liked club-member; so the management trusted him. And so it happened that a 15-year-old, without any formal training or licenses, was doing the financials for a country club most of whose members were millionaires. It worked out well---for a time. 
Jacob had always lived life ‘fast and loose.’ He had once been caught cheating, and there were suspicions that he occasionally sold drugs. It was common knowledge that he did drugs, but that was brushed aside on the grounds that it was only pot and that it was only occasional. In point of fact, it was very non-occasional, and although it began with pot, it quickly escalated to cocaine and heroin. Oddly, I was the only one at the club who seemed to notice. (I think the other people there were more focused on Jacob’s job-performance, which was always impeccable.) 
One day, Jacob let me in on a little ‘secret.’ He had started using club-member credit card numbers to make purchases on Amazon, sometimes for himself, sometimes for others, usually drug dealers to whom he owed money. He always only made small purchases, he told me, $10 here, $15 there. Because he had access to every club-member’s card-information, he was able to spend thousands of dollars of club-member money without any of them being the wiser, since he spread the purchases out over so many different credit cards. 
I was absolutely stunned. I was also conflicted. Jacob and I went way back. I knew what he was doing was wrong, but he had always been a loyal friend to me. At the same time, my father was a member of that club, and I thought I might have a duty to tell him that somebody else was using his credit card. I told Jacob this, but he immediately replied that he would never use my father’s card information. That later turned out to be a lie, and deep down I think I knew that it was a lie; but it did give me pause. So I bided my time, telling myself that I was trying to figure out what to do: be loyal to Jacob or prevent Jacob from continuing with this fraud. Frankly, I was not strongly inclined to turn Jacob in. The club members had money, and it didn’t seem quite worth it to ruin Jacob’s life over this theft. If it had continued for longer, I might have changed my mind, but I’m not sure. 
Fortunately—or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it— Jacob was found out. No criminal charges were filed—probably to avoid stigmatizing the club. But his parents were kicked out of the club and had to pay around $45,000 in restitution. Jacob then went to another school. I haven’t kept in touch with him, but the rumor is that his life has gone downhill in a huge way. 
This was, in my opinion, a real moral dilemma. It’s easy to say that I simply should have turned Jacob in—and that’s probably what I would have done if it had gone on much longer—but there is more to it than that. He had never wronged me, and although he was technically stealing, the people at the club certainly wouldn’t miss the few dollars Jacob was stealing from them. This was a tough one—which, fortunately, circumstance resolved for me, sparing me a tough ethical decision. 
Answers to questions about 
documentary about how corporations 
are evil (Response to 
https://www.youtube.com/watch? 

v=Pin8fbdGV9Y) 
1. Briefly summarize the basic plot, or issue that the movie addresses. 
The basic point of this documentary is that corporations, while operating under the banner of providing people with necessary goods and services, are the very embodiment of amoral greed. The basic conceit is that, although evil has always existed, corporations managed to turn it into a science, using the free-market, along with the corresponding ready-made slogans, as a cover. 
2. What do you think is the most interesting point in the movie? 
For me, the most interesting point made by the movie was that corporations had had such a profound influence on the making and executing of laws in the United States. The fact that corporations are legally classified as persons is indeed striking. 
3. What is the most controversial statement you’ve heard? 
That IBM was responsible to some extent for the Holocaust, which, speaking on historical grounds (including testimony of relatives who spent time in Auschwitz), is extremely questionable, given that the WW2 was more about Germany’s straitened economic circumstances coupled with centuries-old ethnic conflicts, with none of which IBM or indeed any other company had anything to do. 
4. What is the most important ethical issue that the movie is addressing? Please explain. 
The most important ethical issue is how to control corporate greed without crippling the market’s ability to function.

Instructions: Please answer the questions below. The length of your video case assignment form responses should be approximately one page, single spaced. This form will be graded on a pass/fail basis. To pass, you need to provide reasonably detailed and insightful answers to the questions below. 
1. What do you think you would have done were you Buzz McCoy, the narrator of the film (the Morgan Stanley executive), and the Sadhu was dropped at your feet? Would you have left the Sadhu for the next group, as Buzz did? Would you have taken the Sadhu to safety, and likely sacrificed your trip? 
I obviously like to think that I would have rescued the Sadhu. But the reality is that it depends on the circumstances. If the trip were mere recreation for me, then yes, I would have helped. If the trip were the equivalent of my one shot at an Olympic Gold Medal, then no, I would not have helped. I have been in situations that were similar, albeit much smaller, and I did help. But those situations required little sacrifice on my part, so I don’t know how much can be read into them. 
2. No matter how you answer in 1. above, why do you think Buzz did what he did? Why didn’t Buzz take the Sadhu to safety? In other words, if the situation was different, might Buzz have taken the Sadhu to safety? If so, how would the situation have to change? And what about Buzz himself? What things about him or his personality do you think affected his decision? 
I think it’s important to know that we simply don’t know what Buzz specifically would have done under different circumstances. Obviously, we are led to believe that it was only with great reluctance that he did not help that Sadhu. But actions speak louder than words, and he didn’t help. For all we know, if he had been in a situation where the sacrifice to himself was minimal, he still would have come up with an excuse not to help. Nothing can be assumed here. 
3. What do you think is the “moral” of the parable (case)? 
That people always pass the buck and, therefore, that true morality is about doing the right thing, instead of just having an excuse for not doing it. 
Answers to Questions about Walmart-documentary (https://www.youtube.com/watch? 
v=jf-Sr3SjBzk) 
Instructions: Please address each item below for each movie. The total length of your critical viewing form responses should be approximately one-half to one page, single spaced. This form will be graded on a pass/fail basis. To pass, you need to provide reasonably detailed and insightful answers to the items below. 
1. Briefly summarize the basic plot, or issue that the movie addresses. 
The point of the movie is that Walmart is an exploitative as well as deceptive corporation. The larger point is that exploitativeness and deceptiveness are inherent in what corporations are. 
2. What do you think is the most interesting point in the movie? 
The material about the overseas sweatshops was striking and did show a lack of conscience on the part of Walmart’s management. 
3. What is the most controversial statement you’ve heard? 
The most debatable contention in the movie is that Walmart economically devastates communities. That may be true, but it’s hard to square with my personal experience. I myself shop at Walmart and the prices and selection are very good. And I’m friends with Walmart employees, and although it is not stimulating work, they seem happy to have any kind of employment at all, which Walmart, unlike other employers, was more than happy to offer. 
4. What is the most important ethical issue that the movie is addressing? Please explain. 
The issue was how to curb corporate amorality. As a believer in economic freedom, I would like to think that the movie was concerned with how to keep markets free while preventing malfeasance on the part of juggernauts such as Walmart. But there wasn’t really any direct evidence that the writer-director was concerned with that issue, his focus being, as far as I could tell, to indict Walmart with misconduct, without worrying too much about how to do that without over-regulating the economy.

Advertising Assignment 
1. Identify any advertisement and provide a copy or link to your submission on Canvas 
https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/10-natural-ways-have-beautiful­
and-youthful-skin.html 


2. Clearly state the objectives and target audience of the ad 
The immediate objective of the ad is to sell literature published by LifeHack, a company specializing in personal growth. The long term objective is to hook the prospect into becoming a serial customer of LIfeHack goods (mainly books) and services (mainly information and some personal consulting). The target audience is anyone who believes that his professional future is tied less to his to his doing the intellectual equivalent of going to the gym three times/week. 
3. How does this ad fit into the company’s/organization’s marketing communication strategy? 
It fits well. It’s a pop-up ad that appears in an ad on anti-aging skin cream (which, though I am in my early 20s, I sometimes use), and the two products (the cream and the book) do fit with each other psychologically and also fit with the fact that the company is online-centered and has an amicably aggressive style. 
4. Explain the tone, appeal and format of the ad 
Friendly but ‘in-your-face’: you can be a slacker or you can buy our products---your call. 
5. Assess the ad’s level of effectiveness 
Pretty effective, largely because LifeHack has independent credibility, but it the positioning works: I think I’m going to buy the product right now 
6. How would you make improvements to the ad? 
I would ad an image that draws the person in: I like pictures, and the ad in its current form has none and is too abstract. I want to see an image of a smart person or a good-looking person. As it stands, I have only the text to tell what I’m buying, which isn’t quite enough to seal the deal. 
Does good employee treatment (SAS movie) usually mean more profit? If not, why not? If so, why, and why don't more companies treat their employees well? 
Yes, there is no doubt about it. Happy employees work hard and work intelligently. Unhappy employees cost the firm more than they are worth. The use of force in business contexts is expensive, since it results in mediocre work. Adam Smith said it well: 
The experience of all ages and nations, I believe, demonstrates that the work done by slaves, though it appears to cost only their maintenance, is in the end the dearest of any. A person who can acquire no property can have no other interest but to eat as much and to labour as little as possible. Whatever work he does beyond what is sufficient to purchase his own maintenance, can be squeezed out of him by violence only, and not by any interest of his own. 
Smith, Adam. An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (Kindle Locations 5871-5874). University Of Chicago Press. Kindle Edition. 
In other words, people do the bare minimum when it's all stick and no carrot. I myself make money by doing very labor-intensive, highly skilled labor, and the minute a client tries to low-ball me, I immediately put them on a blacklist on my mind. I will fulfill existing contracts, but then they are on their own. If you want results, you have to treat workers well and pay them enough to be happy, since without happiness the emotional basis for good work is absent. 
Should corporate executives be held criminally liable for deaths or injuries in the workplace? Discussion Post 
It really depends on the nature and circumstances of the injury. Suppose that an idiotic employee pours hot coffee on another employee: Should the owner of the company be held criminally responsible? Obviously not. What about if the CEO insists on observance of safety-protocols, which are then ignored, resulting in an accident? Again--no. Of course, you could say that these injuries resulted not from work proper but from workplace goofery. Very well, But what if the stress of being a young lawyer causes Smith to have a heart-attack? In that case, the heart attack is the result of Smith's work: so are the partners of law firm guilty of criminal negligence? Or should they be? Doesn't seem like it. If safety-hazards are not disclosed and the accident is demonstrably a result of such non-disclosure, then yes, there is criminal and civil liability. But it wont' do to say that the owner/CEO should categorically be held responsible for any and all injuries incurred while at work or even as a result of work: the economy would grind to a halt. 
Is Money a Drug? Discussion Post 
I don't agree with Bevilaqua and Singh, and Polk. What is being described is not the effect of money itself, but of money obtained too easily and in questionable ways. I have received some money from parents, and worked for some of money, and I cannot say that any of it was drug-like, especially not the money that I worked for. It may well be that what investment bankers do is on the meaningless side, and it may also be that when large amounts of money are given in exchange for meaningless work, a certain moral vertigo ensues. There are definitely some dodgy ways to make a living, but I'm not sold on the 'money-is-the-root-of-evil' idea just yet. And frankly, I don't think it's a concern my generation will have. The economy is shrinking in some ways (not all), and I don't think there is any 'easy money' out there anymore. For better or for worse, my generation probably won't have the luxury of wrestling with moral perplexities of excessive wealth. Tell somebody who works 12 hours a day for $200 that the feeling of satisfaction is a drug-induced illusion---won't fly. Maybe if he fails to work and gets $20,000, the story will be different. But frankly given only what I know, I can't quite throw my weight the idea that money in and of itself is to be treated with the same contempt as crack or PCP. 
The “Heaven Help Her” Scenario: Utilitarian and Universalist Perspectives 
Section I. In this context, my (Jiu’s) two basic options are (i) lie to the person selling the manufacturing plant (henceforth ‘the seller’) and (ii) do not lie to that person. In this context, a number of assumptions are being made that must be made explicit if it is to be possible to put forth an analysis of the moral complexion of this situation. These are assumptions are: 
(1) 
If I take option (i), Rev. Smith will get a better price and better financing terms than he would get were I to take option (ii). 

(2) 
If I take option (i), my boss will be happier with the outcome than he would be were I to contravene his instructions and take option (ii). 

(3) 
If I cannot find a way to convince Tyler, my boss, to be happy about letting me be truthful with the seller. 

(4) 
Rev. Smith simply cannot or will not raise more than $150,000. 

(5) 
There is no way for me to get the seller to lower the price to within Rev. Smith’s reach except by lying to him about Smith’s caring about wanting to fix the machines. 


If any one of (1)-(5) is rejected, then there is a ‘moral workaround’ for me, in which case the dilemma is ‘solved’ only by fundamentally changing the ethical structure of the situation. For example, if Rev. Smith wins the lottery, then there is indeed no dilemma---but only because the situation in question has been replaced with a morally very different one. We will therefore not reject any one of (1)-(5). 
The stakeholders in this situation are myself (Jiu), Rev. Smith, Tyler, and the seller. Since we are not introducing additional assumptions, there are no other stakeholders. These being the facts, a stakeholder analysis is readily generated: 
Lie to Seller  Do Not Lie to Seller  
Jiu (myself)  + Keep job, make money.  -Lose job, lose money.  
Rev. Smith  +Able to purchase manufacturing plant.  -Not able to purchase manufacturing plant.  
Tyler  +Effectuates sale, makes money from deal, pleases his client.  -Does not effectuate sale, does not make money deal, loses client.  
The Seller  -Sells manufacturing plant for less desired  +Sells manufacturing plant for desired price.  


Section II. 
Utilitarianism: According to utilitarianism, a given act is the right one if, out of the various possible acts, it does the best job of maximizing utility. So according to utilitarianism, I am right to lie if the utility thereby generated exceeds the utility gained if I tell the truth. It is the other way around if telling the truth generates more utility than lying, and neither course of option is morally superior to the other if neither would generate more utility than the other. 
In order to state a utilitarian analysis of this situation, we have to make the following assumptions: 
(1) 
If I lie, the utility lost to the seller does not outweigh the utility gained by the other three parties. 

(2) 
If I tell the truth, the utility gained by the seller does not outweigh the utility 


If we are not granted these assumptions, then it is simply known what the net utility of my decision is, which makes a utilitarian impossible, since utilitarian says ‘it is right if and only if it maximizes net utility.’ 
Given (1) and (2), the utilitarian says: Lie. The reason: if I lie, three people benefit and only one is hurt, whereas three people are hurt and only person benefits if I tell the truth. 
Universalism: The universalist says that one must only act in such a way that, were others to act similarly, that act would not be self-defeating. So I should not, since lies wouldn’t be credible in a world in which everybody lied and my act of lying would therefore fail of its purpose in such a world. 
The universalist also holds that one should treat people as subjects, not as objects. In other words, people should not be ‘used’ or manipulated, since, as subjects, they should be treated as ends unto themselves, rather than as mere means to ends. 
These principles seem not to be equivalent. If I teach someone how to play the piano, I am not ‘using’ that person; but in a world in which everybody wanted to teach piano, nobody could do so, since nobody would make those pianos—not to mention build houses or enforce laws. That said, they happen to have the same result in this particular context. 
If I lie to the seller, I am treating him as a means, not as an end unto himself; and the universalist (i.e. the advocate of the principle that one should treat others as subjects, not objects) would say that I am acting wrongly. 
If I lie to the seller, then, for the reason given a moment, I am acting in a way in which I could not coherently want everyone else to act; and the universalist (i.e. the advocate of the principle that one should only act in such a way that one’s act would not be self-defeating if everyone else acted similarly) would say that I am acting wrongly. 
Profit maximization: According to this view, I should act in a way that maximizes profit provided that I am not (i) breaking the law, (ii) preventing free and open competition, or (iii) lying or committing fraud. The idea is that, if I act in a way that maximizes profit while complying with these constraints, then the economy and society benefit. If I maximize profit but fail to abide by these constraints, then, so the theory goes, society is a whole is not benefited, even though my firm may benefit. 
Since, according to this theory, lying is categorically verboten, I am wrong to lie and right to tell the truth to the seller, notwithstanding that lying may maximize my firm’s profits. Although Friedman and Mackey disagree as to whether a company should have any obligations other than to maximize profits, Friedman’s position being that it should and Mackey’s being that it shouldn’t, they both agree that companies should lie, restrain trade, or break the law, and they would both hold that I would be wrong to lie. 
Section III. I would not lie. I would not lie because, in this context, to lie would be to commit fraud. That raises the question: Why is fraud wrong? According to universalism (people are to be treated as subjects, not objects, and therefore not manipulated, swindled, coerced or otherwise objectified), fraud is inherently wrong. 
As for the utilitarian, his position would be that a given act of fraud is wrong only if it does more than good and, therefore, that fraud is not inherently wrong; and the utilitarian’s position would be that, given the previously stated assumptions, I should lie and therefore should not tell the 
truth. 
That said, my grounds for choosing to tell the truth would not be strictly non-utilitarian. In my personal experience, fraud always does more harm than good. In other words, setting aside issues relating to guilt and other intangibles, fraud is a losing proposition even from a strictly pragmatic viewpoint. I’ve known many fraudsters, and their victories were always small and short-lived; and the people I’ve known who succeeded in life were honest. In my experience, in a situation like the one in question, there would be a practical downside to lying. First of all, an employer who asks employees to lie is, in my experience, likely to lie—and otherwise abuse—his employees. Second, if Rev. Smith were willing to play along with this lie, then he is a fraudster and his charity is also likely to be fraudulent. 
To be sure, given the previously stated assumptions, the utilitarian would say that I should lie. But if I were actually in this situation, my decision to tell the truth would be influenced by such considerations— however irrelevant they might be to the exact version of the hypothetical we are describing—as well as by universalist considerations; and their respective influences on my decision would not be easily separated.

Do we have free will? Responses to discussions posts (my content in bold­faced italics) 
Colleen Sparkman-van der Werf posted Oct 21, 2019 12:32 PM Subscribe I would say that without a doubt yes, we have free will. I believe that although we condition our bodies and brains to do what is natural and what is the norm for us, we, as human beings still have the ability to choose. I feel that what we are getting caught up in is that we tend to choose what is comfortable and safe. And our brains have been programed to remember what we would typically choose. In the video clip “Neuroscience and Free will” although some brains knew the button was going to be pushed beforehand, it is not enough to prove that they did not have free will. This experiment is subjective. This only proves that the brain knew they wold be hitting the button. It is difficult to positively know whether the subjects really did not think about it before their finger actually went to touch it. This also could prove that it is a conditioning of our brain. I suppose this goes against the position of new materialism. I also think that humans condition their brains for self preservation. And the least resistance for that would be to do what is safe and known. Which, in reality, would not be considered free will because you are then choosing something based on what your brain and body is telling you that you need; whereas if you chose to do something just because you wanted to do it and not worry about the consequences, then that would be free will. 
Hello CW! I greatly enjoyed your post. I’m not 100% clear what our position. First, you say that we clearly have free will. But you immediately thereafter say that our behavior is governed by ‘programming’ and ‘conditioning’, which, if true, suggests that very much lack free will. 
Is your position that, when we aren’t being brainwashed or 
manipulated or otherwise ‘conditioned’ or ‘programmed’, our natural state is one of being free? If so, that is a position worth developing, with the caveat that you would have to make it clear what you mean by ‘free will.’ At one point, you correctly that we make our own choices. But are all choices made freely? Setting aside cases of duress or external compulsion, are choices always made freely? 
The video suggested that our choices ‘make themselves’, as it were, and that our conscious minds are simply to take not of our decisions after the fact. This was argued compelling by Freud over hundred years ago, though not on quite the same grounds; and although I personally agree with you that, under certain circumstances, it is an option to make decisions that are in some respects ‘free’, it would have to said which decisions are made freely, and in exactly what respect they are made freely, before it can be said that are categorically ‘free.’ 
Erik Smallwood posted Oct 21, 2019 7:06 AM Subscribe I had a hard time following interpreting the first video we watched. I feel like the researchers did not give us enough information about how they are conducting their experiments. I was thinking during the beginning and middle of the video that they also need to have their subjects think about hitting a button and then decided not to. This way they can compare the brain usage/ramping of both decisions. The researcher at the end of the video said there are multiple impulses running at the same time and certain ones win out. 
I think that what they are finding is more about how our decision making process works. We starting thinking about something/action before we do it which I think is what they are reading. I don’t feel like they even believe that we do not have free will but that we just don’t know when we start thinking about something. I can relate that to conditioning. We are so used to our brains work the way they do that we don’t think about how they take part in our actions or decisions. 
I do think that it can be a little bit of both. We do have free will to make a decision but some of those are decisions could already be predetermined for whatever reason. I do not think my views are threatened by any of these new findings. I think that it could be some combination of everything that makes the whole thing work. I think this quote from the movie Forrest Gump can sum up this topic well. “I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I, I think maybe it's both. Maybe both is happening at the same time.” 
Hi Erik! I agree that the people who made the video could have been more clear about the structure of the experiment. Nonetheless, the basic idea was ultimately pretty clear. When a given person makes a given decision, his body gives off a number of signals, in much the way that a bad poker player gives off ‘tells’ (meaning that he inadvertently discloses his hand); and this experiment seemed to show pretty conclusively that a number of involuntary signals that a given decision has been made are given off before the person actually ‘pushes the button’ on the matter. In other words, the subject knows only when the clicks the mouse; but his body, so this experiment showed, has already given off a lot of involuntary signals that show that he was already locked into a certain path. Cheers, Monzer 
Discussion Post #8 (worth 30 points; at least 200 words): Due by Saturday, Oct 26th, by 11:30 p.m. (my work in boldfaced italics) 
Read the introduction to the theme of “Culture and Identity” on pp. 428-430. Then read Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s “The Yellow Wallpaper” on pp. 442-454 (I've also put an audio reading of the story above, so you can listen to it as well.) Then read any ONE other piece of fiction or poetry or drama or nonfiction from the “Culture and Identity” theme from pp. 428-575. Again, though, you may NOT use the same piece for post #8 as you did for post #7 
For discussion post #8, there are two parts: 
First for part A (worth 15 points). SUMMARIZE “The Yellow Wallpaper” and the other piece you read with one FULL paragraph of 6-8 sentences (at least 50 words) given to each piece for a total of at least 100 words for this part (remember, your summaries should be detailed enough to SHOW you read well . . .). Make sure when you do your post that you give the title of the piece you are responding to, as well as the pages it is on in our text. 
Summary and Analysis of The Yellow Wallpaper 
This story is told from the viewpoint of a highly emotionally sensitive woman, who in times past would have been classified as ‘neurasthenic’, meaning, in effect, that she had a persistent case of ‘raw nerves.’ The woman lives in a room by herself. She never seems to leave the room, even though it is a part of a large house, which is also occupied by her husband. Her husband is a medical doctor and is also functioning, ominously, as her personal medical doctor—more specifically, as her psychiatrist. (And, like many psychiatrists, he is not, it turns out, a particularly good one.) It is clear from the beginning of the story that the woman is emotionally troubled and, at the very least, extremely neurotic. 
But there is a great deal about her condition that is not clear. It is not clear whether she is basically a normal, if highly sensitive woman, who has experienced a bit of emotional throttling or, on the contrary, whether she has a had full-on psychotic break with reality. At the beginning of the story, we are led to believe that she is more on the neurotic side of the spectrum, but at the end it is revealed by that she is very much at the psychotic extreme. 
The story consists for the most part of the woman’s pondering her husband’s alleged failure to have a genuinely emotional, as opposed to narrowly clinical, understanding of her condition. Her husband has very clearly written her off as a demented woman, who, for reasons of protocol, must be tolerated and treated with a certain degree of civility but not sympathized with or respected. The woman’s grievances about her husband prove to be justified, and as the story progresses, it begins to emerge that her complaints about him are seriously understated, as he is driven not by cold professionalism but by ill-will and hatred towards his wife. 
At the same time, the woman’s mental condition is increasingly clearly that of somebody who is completely psychotic, as is evidenced by her fixation with, and delusions concerning, the peeling yellow wallpaper in her room, which represents her unravelling soul. 
At the end of the story, it is revealed that, contrary to what the woman herself has believed all along and also to what the reader has assumed, the woman is a prisoner and is simply trapped in that room— much as, so it is suggested, she is trapped in her own madness. 
For part B (worth 15 points). Then RESPOND to the story and other piece and/or the ideas in them in some way--either creatively or critically (for critical, for example, see the handout called "An Inductive/Inquiry Approach to Studying Texts" in week two’s module or the “Glossary of Critical Approaches” on pp. 946-954). You might write several questions (as outlined in the Inquiry Approach) or you might choose one of the critical approaches and analyze the story or stories from that perspective. Or you could compare/contrast the story and the other piece in terms of what they say about the theme of “Culture and Identity.” Or you could write about how you interpreted these pieces. These are just some suggestions for ways you can respond to literature you have read. 
If you want to do a creative response, then write your own "mini-story"or poem about this theme or in the style/vein/voice of one of the pieces you read. 
Or you can answer/address this question: Charlotte Perkins Gilman said that she wrote this piece as a feminist protest against the way women were treated during her time. Do you see this character as protesting or not? Is she trying to create a different kind of identity for herself than the one that was acceptable for women at that time—or is she just mentally unstable? Write about her and this story and compare it to the other piece you read somehow. 
For the response part, I am looking for at least 100 words for this part also. The more detail the better; the more thoughtful/thought-provoking, the better! 
Dialogue about Sonny’s Blues and The Yellow Wallpaper 
Smith: Brown! How are you, my friend? How did you like those two stories? 
Brown: I very much liked The Yellow Wallpaper (YP). I’m not sure how I felt about Sonny’s Blues (SB). 
Smith: When you say “not sure…”, do you actually mean you’re not sure? Or are you politely saying that it didn’t work for you? 
Brown: It didn’t work for me. 
Smith: That’s surprising, because I know you like non-fiction, or non-fiction-like, stories about wayward lifestyles and the gritty realities they involve. 
Brown: I do. But SB didn’t work for me. 
Smith: Why not? 
Brown: First of all, the main character---the narrator—was boring. He had a boring outlook, and I got the feeling that his job was just a kind of prop. And I didn’t really know what he was supposed to represent. 
Smith: I can kind of see that. 
Brown: On the one hand, he was supposed to be this square schoolteacher, which I can certainly understand. But then there were these weird flashes of bitterness about racial injustice, among other things, that, although morally justified, had no real foundation in the character. They just came out of the blue. 
Smith: I got that feeling myself. The main character was supposed to be a blank—a mirror that reflected reality---but sometimes he would stop being a blank and would go into an angry political mode, which, however justified historically, didn’t cohere with the rest of the character’s personality. 
Brown: Yes, frankly, I felt that way too. I didn’t really know what the story was about. I mean, there were really only two characters: the main one, who was just kind of a run-of-the-mill narrator, and Sonny, who, apart from his piano-talent, had no particularly good or interesting qualities. 
Smith: Yes, and there seemed to be an understanding to the effect that all of this was a consequence of racism, or some such, and maybe it was. But if the story is just considered on its own terms—if it’s just read as a story about a man and his brother, rather than as a political diatribe—it doesn’t really work very well. 
Brown: No, it doesn’t. Not in my view, anyway. And there was undischarged premise there, something to the effect that Sonny was a lost soul who would not have been lost in a non-racist society. Which may or may not be true and which, in any case, didn’t really make for very engaging reading, I’m sorry to say. 
Smith: What about YP? What did you think of that? 
Brown: That one I very much liked. 
Smith: Which is ironic, given that you’re a male and the main character isn’t. 
Brown: Yes, that’s an irony, I suppose. But I still liked it. 
Smith: Because..? 
Brown: Because it was realistic. Especially the way the woman’s delusions were intertwined with accurate emotional perceptions. 
Smith: Explain please. 
Brown: Ok. So obviously the woman’s belief that she lived in the wallpaper, or whatever her delusion was, was indeed a delusion. But her beliefs about her husband’s emotional disposition towards her was accurate. 
Smith: That makes sense. 
Brown: And I think what drove her insane was her awareness, her unconscious awareness, of her husband’s actual feelings. 
Smith: So was it the fact that she was aware of her husband’s feelings that drove her mad, or was it the fact that she was unconsciously aware of her husband’s feeling? 
Brown: The latter. If she had known, consciously and lucidly, what her husband was really about, it would not have driven her mad, since frank acceptances of ugly realities, though unpleasant, don’t undermine mental health. 
Smith: So it was the fact that she was aware of her husband’s actual disposition towards her but couldn’t admit it. 
Brown: Right, she couldn’t admit it---except by going into a kind of perpetual dream-like state. 
Smith: You’re referring to her psychosis. 
Brown: Yes, psychosis being, as Freud said, a prolonged waking dream. 
Smith: Hoo boy! 
Brown: Yes, it’s heavy. That’s why I liked the story. 
Smith: You liked it because it was heavy, or because it was accurate? 
Brown: It wouldn’t have been heavy if it had not been psychologically accurate. 
Smith: Good point, Brown. Good point.

The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman (page 442-454) 
From the beginning this story will open the doors to a psychological thriller that will leave you wanting more all the way to the end. It begins by detailing the daily struggles of a Physician named John and his wife who seem to operate strangely in their personal relationship. John is his wife’s physician and that will hinder her ability to cope with her mental illness throughout the story. John seems to be in true denial of his wife’s mental condition. This story will lead you to believe that John’s wife is going through postpartum depression in many ways. He has taken her away to a beautiful yet older rental home to heal, and ultimately this home will begin to unravel her mental illness. She becomes obsessed with things she sees and begins to write about them in her journals. The story will explain how John’s wife is hiding a lot of her fears and feelings. She begins to write a secretive journal detailing the things she is experiencing and seeing in the rental house. The yellow wallpaper in the house will have a major significance to the story and will add to the wife’s perception of reality. She begins to see an imprisoned woman within the yellow wallpaper which will leave the reader wondering. At times this story will go from documenting the first person struggles of anxiety and depression to something that is a bit evil and full of suspense. 
Hi Jennifer! I very much enjoyed your post. But I feel that you simply stated the ‘cold facts’ of the case, as it were. Yes, this woman is obviously cycling into psychosis, possibly caused by post-partum depression, and yes she does start to project onto the wall-papers. But what, in your opinion, does all of this mean? In other words, what is it that isn’t said but lies beneath the surface of these events? For example, is the husband deliberately torturing her? If so, why? Is there a larger conceit at work concerning gender relations? If so, what? I would be very interested on your thoughts on these matters! -Monzer 
A Poet To His Baby Son by James Weldon Johnson (page 504-505) 
This poem is about a father who wants his son to grow up to be something great. As his son lays in front of him as a baby, he begins to think of the future and what his son will grow up to be. His son is described as being blessed with his mother’s face and cursed with his father’s mind. He wants his son to grow up to be a banker, a politician, leader or a type of go getter. The father seems to have strong opinions on what he does not want is son to be. He states, “Take the advice of a father who knows.” He clearly does not want his son to become a poet. He defines in the poem that it is no time or place for poets today. He views the language of poets as an unknown tongue today. 
Great post! What are your thoughts on the father’s values? Is the father right to have such specific views as to what constitutes success? And why does he have them? Is it because he is himself unfulfilled? Or is it just that he is ‘old school’ and has rather retrograde beliefs about how life is to be lived? Finally, what are your own views on these matters? Are you a poet who others tried to force into some pre-existing professional template? Cheers, Monzer 
Questions about the Yellow Wallpaper 
What type of physician is John? Does he have any experience with mental illness or postpartum depression? Is a psychiatrist? What type of physician is her brother? 
Probably a general practitioner who, if given the choice, would specialize in psychiatry. 
How did she really feel about the yellow wallpaper? She used words like flamboyant, repellent, revolting and unclean. Did she really hate the yellow wallpaper? 
She does not like it. It is clinical and fake, and it represents her tattered psyche. 
The story mentioned that Mary is good with the baby. Is this their first baby? Has Mary been there as the caregiver for more than one child for John and his wife? Does Mary know she has postpartum and that’s why they are at the rental house? 
I don’t know that she thinks in quite such logical, transactional terms. 
In the story she states she is angry enough to do something desperate. She also mentions she has a hidden rope. Does John take her suicide signs seriously? Does John know that his wife could be suicidal? 
He is probably deliberately causing her to be suicidal, or so the subtext suggests. 
John takes it as far as to take his wife to a rental house to recover from 
postpartum depression. Has John seen signs that would make him think his wife would harm their child? 
Great suggestion, but his objective seems to be to hurt, not to protect. 
Questions A Poet To His Baby Son 
Why does the author think becoming a poet is such a bad choice? Is the author a poet himself? 
He thinks it’s a bad choice, because, financially speaking, it is a bad choice. Pan-handlers make more money than poets. 
Why does the author think that poets are unfortunate fellows? Why doesn’t he want his son to grow up to be like one? Is that because you cannot earn a living being a poet? The poem says that poetry is unknown tongue? Does he think that no one reads or respects poetry anymore? 
He thinks this, because they have no earning power and are therefore defenseless. Plus, there are great poets who have day-jobs, such as Wallace Stevens, who was an investment banker. Even Shakespeare made his living as an actor, not as a poet or playwright. 
It seems the author wants the best for his son. Why would he be critical of what he does not want his son to be when he grows up? 
Asked and answered. See above. 
Why would the author think that poetry is not a good way of communicating love for his son if he is writing his own son a poem like this? 
Poetry is a great way to communicate love, but it isn’t a good way to pay the bills. A friend of mine is a poet, and he always had to ask other people for money, including me. One day I lent him my car, and he just drove away. With my dog and birth-certificate. 
How would the author feel if his son grew up to become a poet and read this 
poem that was written for him as a baby? Would be feel regretful that he has such harsh feeling on poets knowing his own son became one? less 
That really depends. It depends on the father and also depends on the son’s situation. Is he writing the poem from his mansion or from his jail cell? 
Legal vs. Substantive Freedom and the Paradox of the Free Market Reflections on works by Hall, Debord, and Morgan & Tierney 
This paper is a critical response to three articles: “The Commodity as Spectacle”, by Guy Debord; “The Spectacle of the Other”, by Stuart Hall; and “An Illustrated Guide to Guy Debord’s ‘The Society of the Spectacle’”, by Tiernan Morgan and Lauren Purje. Each one of these articles had most, if not all, of the following five characteristics: 
(a) 
It correctly points out that a society that is market-based, as opposed to culture-based, inevitably turns people into objects; 

(b) 
Despite making this important point, not a single one of these articles discusses pornography, which is the best conceivable illustration of the fact that market-based societies turn people into objects or, to use Debord’s term, ‘mere spectacles’; 

(c) 
Up to a point, each of these articles is itself an example of the very commodity-fetishism that it is its very purpose to expose and heap scorn on; 

(d) 
Although each of these papers does expose a deep problem with all economy-based societies--namely, that human beings are turned into 


objects it does so much as attempt to identify a constructive way of 
responding to this fact; and finally, 
(e) Although, as just stated, each of these papers identified this important problem with market-based societies, there is an important corollary that each of them hints at but not a single one of them clearly states, namely, that the various freedoms that people necessarily have in a given market-economy---in particular, the freedoms to own and exchange goods and services---inevitably lead to complete mutual enslavement on the part of that society’s members, albeit under the pretexts of ‘universal legal protection of individual rights’ and ‘economic and individual freedom.’ 
Let us now clarify and substantiate each of these points, and relate it to the articles in question. First of all, what better example of “the Commodity as Spectacle”, to use Guy Debord’s term, could there be than a stripper or pornographic actress? Debord himself does not mention these professions, and yet they are the best conceivable examples of his point that the free-market turns people into mere ‘spectacles.’ For here we have a human being who has been turned into a commodity that is in the most literal possible way a spectacle. This woman is paid to be ‘stripped’ of her clothing—and dignity —and turned into a pure spectacle—something that exists only to be consumed and that is consumed by being looked at. 
This is not to say that strippers and pornographic actresses are forced into their professions: in most cases they are not. But in a way, the fact that they enter these professions ‘freely’ only shows how insidiously and deceptively destroying of freedom the so-called ‘free market’ really is. First of all, if a woman is abducted and forced to become a pornographic actress, that does not redound to the discredit of capitalism. Capitalism is about people transacting with one another. In other words, it is about people having and using the legal right to dispose of their own assets in a manner of their own choosing. Since the woman was forced into prostitution, her being a prostitute is not the result of a transaction (being kidnapped and forced into a certain line of work is not a way of transacting, after all), and it therefore falls outside the scope of what a capitalist system permits. 
So let us consider the case where the woman ‘freely’ becomes a stripper or pornographic actress. Why has this woman chosen this path? Very simple. She needs money; in a market-economy, she has no value over and above what people are willing to give her in the form of money; and unless she has the wherewithal to become a high-level professional, such as a medical doctor or computer-programmer, her options are either (i) earn a paltry income doing time-consuming, soul-destroying menial work (e.g. work as a waitress or telemarketer) or (ii) make real money by literally turning herself into a spectacle. 
Pornographers and consumers of pornography will say that this woman ‘did this to herself’—that she ‘did it freely.’ And after a fashion, they are right. Like all members of a market-economy, this woman started off with certain legal ‘freedoms’; and in order to eat and pay rent, she disposed of those freedoms in a manner that, given the options available to her, was the most ‘rational’ and that she consequently ‘freely’ chose. And yet all of this ‘freedom’ and ‘rationality’ has been turned against itself and made its possessor into a slave: this woman may be legally free, but how much more freedom than an actual slave does she actually have? If a slave tries to escape, he may be hunted down and beaten, maybe even killed. If this woman refuses to either work ten hours a day in a cubicle or spend those same ten hours dancing naked under neon lights, she will be out on the streets and either die of exposure or be jailed for vagrancy. Incidentally, supposing for argument’s sake that she does choose to live on the streets, the various petty convictions that she will wrack up as a result will make it impossible for her to get any kind of job that pays enough money to live on. So no—her situation is not, at least not unambiguously, different from that of an actual slave, even though her every move is carried out ‘freely.’ 
Debord writes: 
The spectacle subjugates living men to itself to the extent that the economy has totally subjugated them. It is no more than the economy developing for itself. It is the true reflection of the production of things, and the false objectification of the producers (Debord, 142). 
How much more impactful this statement would have been had it been followed by a specific example! And what better illustration of it could there be than the just-discussed completely literal one! 
Debord’s article is the work of someone with a powerful intellect. It reads much like Marx’s “Theses on Feuerbach” and seems to have been modeled on them, both consisting of deep but obscure epigrams that would be a lot less obscure if concretely illustrated. And not a single one of the forty epigrams composing this work involves a concrete illustration-even though illustrations abound, as we have seen. 
Presumably, it was presumably for this very reason that Morgan and Purje wrote their article “An Illustrated Guide to Guy Debord’s ‘The Society of the Spectacle’”. Though brilliant, this article suffers from one major flaw: it doesn’t contain any illustrations. Yes—it contains ‘illustrations’ in the sense that it there is art-work in it; but it is quite as devoid of specific examples of the phenomenon in question (that the ‘free market’ turns people into two-dimensional spectacle-commodities) as Debord’s work itself. And its attempt to clarify Debord’s meaning do not in my view do Debord’s work justice: 
As spectators, we regularly experience advertisements for rival products — Pepsi and Coca-Cola, Delta and US Airways, The X-Factor and The Voice. Often we’re presented with conflicting desires or messages. For instance, a television drama depicting an AA meeting might be preceded by a glamorous vodka advertisement. Such logical inconsistencies are buried by the spectacle’s relentless proffering of goods and imagery. Gradually, we begin to conflate visibility with value (Morgan and Purje). 
Yes, technically speaking, it is ironic that the same consumers are being shown ads for booze are also being shown ads for ways to get off of booze. But this isn’t exactly a ‘logical inconsistency.’ It is, indeed, just a humorous irony: advertisements are seen by millions of people; some of them want vodka and others want to drop drinking vodka---just as some of them want to buy sneakers and others want to buy dress shoes. 
Also, Morgan and Purje are interpreting Debord overly literally. In their view, Debord is making the pedestrian point that, in a market-society, people focus almost as much on packaging—on the wrapper and the ribbons and the like—as they do on the actual product. But Debord is trying to make a much deeper point—one to the effect that capitalistic transactionalism drains turns human beings into soulless widgets who, as such, have nothing on the ‘inside’ and are therefore pure ‘outside’—pure appearance in other words. 
As for Stuart Hall’s “The Spectacle of the Other” (Hall, 2001), this work was a combination of very sharp and accurate and also very misconceived. Hall points out that, thanks to predatory capitalistic practices, human beings were enslaved and that this was subsequently rationalized on free-market grounds. This is true, of course. Hall then insightfully says that capitalism ‘otherizes’ human beings—which it does, in that, in a ‘free’ market system, people do not interact, so much as they transact, with the result that kinship and moral ties are dissolved in an acid bath of acquisitiveness. 
Where, in my view, Hall goes quite astray is his contention capitalism reinforces distinctions of race and gender. As Marx and Engels themselves said, capitalism does quite the opposite: capitalism replaces the biological with the financial: biologically rooted instincts---both wholesome ones, such as feelings of warmth for friends and family, as well ugly offshoots, such as chauvinism and racism---are replaced by cold calculations, with friends and family and even children having only as much worth as an accounting program says they have. So yes—historically, just as Hall says, capitalism led to acts of profiteering that involved exploiting racial differences. What Hall fails to say is that, when capitalism is allowed to run its course, it dehumanizes everybody: all people—man, woman, black, white—are equally required to toil in cubicles for paychecks that barely cover their rent; and if, in order to tend to a sick child or make a much needed visit to the doctor’s office, they take so much as a day off without ‘written permission’ from their supervisor, they are rewarded for it by having their livelihood cut off—none

1.1 Research Topic 
The proposed research study topic is implicit bias 
on the part of Nursing Faculties against African Americans who are not first-generation immigrants. It is therefore important in this context to distinguish between native born African Americans and first-generation African Americans, since the current study is concerned with implicit institutional biases that are direct towards native born African Americans but are not, at least not with equal intensity, directed towards first-generation immigrants of African Ancestry. A case will be made that native born (Muronda, 2015). 
Less than 10% of Nursing Faculty members are 
of African (Sub-Saharan) descent, even though African Americans are over 13% of the population (US Census Bureau, 2018). At the same time, first-generation immigrants of African descent disproportionately represented in Nursing Faculties (South, 2018). The population of the United States is approximately 330 million, approximately 42 million of whom are of African ancestry. Of those 42 million, approximately 3.4 million are first generation immigrants, approximately 95% of whom come from one of the following countries: Jamaica, Haiti, Nigeria, Trinidad & Tobago, the Dominican Republic, Ghana, Guyana, Kenya, and Somalia (US Census Bureau, 2018). Immigrants from these countries are twice as likely as native born Americans to be employed as medical professionals, over three times as likely as native-born African Americans to be employed as medical professionals, over four times as likely as native-born African Americans to be employed as nurses, and over five times as likely as native-born African Americans to be employed as members of Nursing Faculties (South, 2019). 



1.2 Research Problem (1 Paragraph) 
Although there is a voluminous scholarly literature concerning racism towards African-Americans, there is a paucity of literature concerning the effects of such literature in the context of Nursing Faculties, and there extremely little literature concerning how the attitudes of nursing faculty members towards first-generation immigrants of African descent differ from their attitudes towards native-born African Americans. 
There does exist purely statistical data relating to the rates of employment in Nursing Faculties of 
both native-born African Americans as well as first-generation immigrants of African descent. But this data has not been interpreted (Akintoye, 2019). It has been observed that, in many different professional context, including nursing and nursing-instruction, first-generation immigrants of African descent do in fact ‘outperform’ native-born African Americans, both when it comes to being hired and also when it comes to being promoted. But this has not been treated as a sign of bias or prejudice. In fact, it has been celebrated as evidence of their absence (White-means, 2009).

2.1 Research Problem Background 
American laws and mores have changed 
enormously over the last sixty years. Jim Crow laws, which explicitly discriminated against African Americans, were abolished and replaced with laws designed to ensure equality of treatment and opportunity (Akintoye, 2019). Also, during this period, the United States has transitioned from being 90% white, has become highly diverse and multicultural, with whites being expected to become a minority by 2043 (Lieberman, 2019). 
It is difficult, however, to track the 
psychological realities underlying these massive demographic shifts and, in particular, to know whether people’s private attitudes have kept pace with the just-mentioned legal and institutional changes. Racism and ethnic bias no longer assume overt forms, but that doesn’t mean they don’t exist. For example, even though the white population has shrunk by almost a third over the last sixty years, nursing faculties are still over 90% white, even in areas, such as Detroit and Chicago, where they make up less than one third of the population (Phillips, 2014). 
Also, the fact that first-generation immigrants 
of African descent are so much more likely than equally qualified native-born African Americans to be hired and promoted by such faculties suggests that their members are still uneasy about native-born African Americans (Sabin, 2009). 
A related fact is that native-born African 
Americans are culturally and even to some extent ethnically distinct from first-generation immigrants of African descent (Hamilton, 2019). The upbringing and outlook of a given immigrant from Lagos, Nigeria is likely to be very different from that of an African American who was raised in Baltimore or Los Angeles; and in addition to speaking with different accents, the two are likely to have different preferences in relation clothing and other personal matters (Hamilton, 2019). Researches have established that racial bias is triggered not by skin color alone but by skin color in conjunction with distinctive accents, clothing styles, and personal manner, and first-generation immigrants of African descent may therefore fail to trigger the biases that operate against his native-born counterpart (Smedley, 2003). 




2.2 Research Question(s)  Is implicit bias on the part of nursing faculty members towards native-born African Americans responsible for the fact that, compared to equally qualified first-generation immigrants of African descent, they are disproportionately unlikely to be hired and, if hired, disproportionately unlikely to be promoted?  
If so, is this bias conscious?  
What non-disruptive and politically feasible measures can be taken to counteract the effects of  
this bias?  
What are the economic consequences of this bias and what would the economic consequences of their elimination be?  
2.3 Purpose of the Study  The purpose of this study is to identify and delineate the social consequences of the psychological forces responsible for the fact that native-born African Americans are less likely than members of all other ethnicities, including first-generation immigrants of African descent, to be recruited/promoted by nursing faculties.  
2.4 Methodology and Basic Design Overview  This study will be divided into two parts, and the methodology used in each part will be quantitative. In the first part, the relevant statistical data will be analyzed, so as to establish that the above-stated discrepancies are indeed a function of implicit bias. Since this will involve correlating hiring-rates and promotion-rates with applicant-credentials, the methodology in question, being causal-correlational, will be quantitative (Cresswell, 2015). In the second part, the nature and causes of the biases in question will be investigated. This will be done through a carefully constructed survey, which will be administered online. The survey will use the standard six-point Likert scale, making it possible for results to evaluated automatically and objectively (Bachmann, 2015).

3.1 Theoretical Foundations 
Ultimately, the foundations for this study lie in 
Levi-Strauss’s structural approach to 
anthropological research and in James Gibson’s 
ecological approach to psychological research. 
According to Levi-Strauss’s structuralism, 
human interrelations are governed by rules, most of them implicit, that are defined in terms of binaries, such as black/white, good/bad, boss/underlying, and male/female (Levi-Strauss, 1963). It is to be stressed that the rules in question are not laws or even conventions. Rather, they are largely unconscious understandings that, although having some biological roots, are changeable and only assume rigid forms when given external reinforcement in the form of statutes and other expressions of institutional force. 
According to Gibson’s ecological 
methodology, interactions among organisms, including human beings, are guided by implicit understandings as to how maintain viable equilibria in a sustainable manner (Gibson, 1977). Oftentimes, these understandings give rise to enlightened practices, but they may also lead to behavior that, although productive in times past, has long since ceased to be so (Gibson, 2002). 
Structuralism has been used with great advantage in the study of racism, including in the 
medical profession, by a number of scholars, 
including Bonilla-Silva (1996) and Viruell-
Fuentes (2012), who have shown that otherwise 
inexplicable and highly invidious forms of 
racism, such as Jim Crow and Apartheid, can be 
understood, though obviously not justified, if 
mapped onto Levi-Strauss’s structuralism Bonilla-Silva (1996). 


As for Gibson’s ecological school of 
psychological research, Anderson (1999), Williams (2001), and Krieger (2014) have done extensive work showing that racial institutions, as well as their psychological residues, can be understood along Gibsonian lines by regarding them as over-deployed defensive-mechanisms, comparable to those that mediate asthma, lupus, and other auto-immune disorders (Krieger, 2014).

mentioned contextualizations of the theories of Gibson and Levi-Strauss not only make it possible to interpret irrationally discriminatory behavior on the part of otherwise rational professionals but also help identify feasible policy-recommendations that would help reconcile the various parties afflicted by the 
racial biases examined in the current study. 
The primary theoretical implication of the 
present study is that racial attitudes, along with the social damage thereby done, can be mitigated without overhauling the institutions implications you believe your study could have for your field AND your specialization area. This will be the theoretical framework(s) to be used in conceptualizing the study and analyzing the data.

that host them or otherwise engaging in extreme measures that are likely to lead to hate, as opposed to reconciliation (LeGrande, 2018). 
Thus far, racism has been combatted either 
through heart-wrenching but ultimately empty pleas for ‘compassion’ or through massive social changes requiring prohibitively large amounts of political will and financial capital (Kumi-Yeboah, 2019). The current study will identify measures that are both non-ideological and also enviro-friendly and, for those reasons among others, would be loss costly and less likely to meet with emotional or political resistance (LeGrand, 218). 



3.4 Practical Implications 
Please describe the specific practical implications that may result from this research that can be used by any or all of the following stakeholders: the population being studied, professionals for whom this topic pertains, and/or the wider community itself.

Discriminatory behavior is never innocuous, 
but it is especially harmful in the context of decisions relating to the hiring and promoting of healthcare employees. Researchers have established that discriminatory hiring-practices correlate with lower-quality healthcare being given to members of the group thereby discriminated against (Sen, 2018). 
Also, economists in the United Kingdom, 
Germany, and the United States have estimated that biases on the part of healthcare providers, including racial biases, increases health-care costs by as much as 20%. Any insight that can be provided as to how to mitigate such bias is therefore likely to improve quality of healthcare while stabilizing costs (Simon, 2019)

Discussion Post #8 (worth 30 points; at least 200 words): Due by Saturday, Oct 26th, by 11:30 p.m. 
Read the introduction to the theme of “Culture and Identity” on pp. 428-430. Then read Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s “The Yellow Wallpaper” on pp. 442-454 (I've also put an audio reading of the story above, so you can listen to it as well.) Then read any ONE other piece of fiction or poetry or drama or nonfiction from the “Culture and Identity” theme from pp. 428-575. Again, though, you may NOT use the same piece for post #8 as you did for post #7 
For discussion post #8, there are two parts: 
First for part A (worth 15 points). SUMMARIZE “The Yellow Wallpaper” and the other piece you read with one FULL paragraph of 6-8 sentences (at 
least 50 words) given to each piece for a total of at least 100 words for this part (remember, your summaries should be detailed enough to SHOW you read well . . .). Make sure when you do your post that you give the title of the piece you are responding to, as well as the pages it is on in our text. 
For part B (worth 15 points). Then RESPOND to the story and other piece and/or the ideas in them in some way--either creatively or critically (for critical, for example, see the handout called "An Inductive/Inquiry Approach to Studying Texts" in week two’s module or the “Glossary of Critical Approaches” on pp. 946-954). You might write several questions (as outlined in the Inquiry Approach) or you might choose one of the critical approaches and analyze the story or stories from that perspective. Or you could compare/contrast the story and the other piece in terms of what they say about the theme of “Culture and Identity.” Or you could write about how you interpreted these pieces. These are just some suggestions for ways you can respond to literature you have read. 
If you want to do a creative response, then write your own "mini-story"or poem about this theme or in the style/vein/voice of one of the pieces you read. 
Or you can answer/address this question: Charlotte Perkins Gilman said that she wrote this piece as a feminist protest against the way women were treated during her time. Do you see this character as protesting or not? Is she trying to create a different kind of identity for herself than the one that was acceptable for women at that time—or is she just mentally unstable? Write about her and this story and compare it to the other piece you read somehow. 
For the response part, I am looking for at least 100 words for this part also. The more detail the better; the more thoughtful/thought-provoking, the better!

The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman (page 442-454) 
From the beginning this story will open the doors to a psychological thriller that will leave you wanting more all the way to the end. It begins by detailing the daily struggles of a Physician named John and his wife who seem to operate strangely in their personal relationship. John is his wife’s physician and that will hinder her ability to cope with her mental illness throughout the story. John seems to be in true denial of his wife’s mental condition. This story will lead you to believe that John’s wife is going through postpartum depression in many ways. He has taken her away to a beautiful yet older rental home to heal, and ultimately this home will begin to unravel her mental illness. She becomes obsessed with things she sees and begins to write about them in her journals. The story will explain how John’s wife is hiding a lot of her fears and feelings. She begins to write a secretive journal detailing the things she is experiencing and seeing in the rental house. The yellow wallpaper in the house will have a major significance to the story and will add to the wife’s perception of reality. She begins to see an imprisoned woman within the yellow wallpaper which will leave the reader wondering. At times this story will go from documenting the first person struggles of anxiety and depression to something that is a bit evil and full of suspense. 
Hi Jennifer! I very much enjoyed your post. But I feel that you simply stated the ‘cold facts’ of the case, as it were. Yes, this woman is obviously cycling into psychosis, possibly caused by post-partum depression, and yes she does start to project onto the wall-papers. But what, in your opinion, does all of this mean? In other words, what is it that isn’t said but lies beneath the surface of these events? For example, is the husband deliberately torturing her? If so, why? Is there a larger conceit at work concerning gender relations? If so, what? I would be very interested on your thoughts on these matters! -Monzer 
A Poet To His Baby Son by James Weldon Johnson (page 504-505) 
This poem is about a father who wants his son to grow up to be something great. As his son lays in front of him as a baby, he begins to think of the future and what his son will grow up to be. His son is described as being blessed with his mother’s face and cursed with his father’s mind. He wants his son to grow up to be a banker, a politician, leader or a type of go getter. The father seems to have strong opinions on what he does not want is son to be. He states, “Take the advice of a father who knows.” He clearly does not want his son to become a poet. He defines in the poem that it is no time or place for poets today. He views the language of poets as an unknown tongue today. 
Great post! What are your thoughts on the father’s values? Is the father right to have such specific views as to what constitutes success? And why does he have them? Is it because he is himself unfulfilled? Or is it just that he is ‘old school’ and has rather retrograde beliefs about how life is to be lived? Finally, what are your own views on these matters? Are you a poet who others tried to force into some pre-existing professional template? Cheers, Monzer 
Questions about the Yellow Wallpaper 
What type of physician is John? Does he have any experience with mental illness or postpartum depression? Is a psychiatrist? What type of physician is her brother? 
Probably a general practitioner who, if given the choice, would specialize in psychiatry. 
How did she really feel about the yellow wallpaper? She used words like flamboyant, repellent, revolting and unclean. Did she really hate the yellow wallpaper? 
She does not like it. It is clinical and fake. 
The story mentioned that Mary is good with the baby. Is this their first baby? Has Mary been there as the caregiver for more than one child for John and his wife? Does Mary know she has postpartum and that’s why they are at the rental house? 
I don’t know that she thinks in quite such logical, transactional terms. 
In the story she states she is angry enough to do something desperate. She also mentions she has a hidden rope. Does John take her suicide signs seriously? Does John know that his wife could be suicidal? 
He is probably deliberately causing her to be suicidal, or so the subtext suggests. 
John takes it as far as to take his wife to a rental house to recover from postpartum depression. Has John seen signs that would make him think his wife would harm their child? 
Great suggestion, but his objective seems to be to hurt, not to protect. 
Questions A Poet To His Baby Son 
Why does the author think becoming a poet is such a bad choice? Is the author a poet himself? 
He thinks it’s a bad choice, because, financially speaking, it is a bad choice. Pan-handlers make more money than poets. 
Why does the author think that poets are unfortunate fellows? Why doesn’t he want his son to grow up to be like one? Is that because you cannot earn a living being a poet? The poem says that poetry is unknown tongue? Does he think that no one reads or respects poetry anymore? 
He thinks this, because they have no earning power and are therefore defenseless. Plus, there are great poets who have day-jobs, such as Wallace Stevens, who was an investment banker. Even Shakespeare made his living as an actor, not as a poet or playwright. 
It seems the author wants the best for his son. Why would he be critical of what he does not want his son to be when he grows up? 
Asked and answered. See above. 
Why would the author think that poetry is not a good way of communicating love for his son if he is writing his own son a poem like this? 
Poetry is a great way to communicate love, but it isn’t a good way to pay the bills. A friend of mine is a poet, and he always had to ask other people for money, including me. One day I lent him my car, and he just drove away. With my dog and birth-certificate. 
How would the author feel if his son grew up to become a poet and read this poem that was written for him as a baby? Would be feel regretful that he has such harsh feeling on poets knowing his own son became one? less 
That really depends. It depends on the father and also depends on the son’s situation. Is he writing the poem from his mansion or from his jail cell?

See Sowell (2005).

These four reasons are taken from:

[63] 
See Marshall (1890) and Smith (1776), both of whom argue at length that it is more expensive, both to employers and the economy as a whole, than to pay them adequately. 
[64] 
See Myerson (1997), who argues that for the reason just given minimum wage increases are necessary to prevent places of business from becoming soul-destroying ‘sweatshops.’ 
[65] 
Adam Smith (1776) was one of the first economists to point out that surpluses are necessary for economic growth and also that there won’t be adequate surpluses unless workers are adequately compensated. 
[66] 
Milton Friedman (2009) makes this point, as does Jevons (1871). 
[67] 
Sowell (2017) makes this point, as do Friedman (2009) and Jevons (1871). 
[68] 
Sowell (2017), Friedman (2009) and Jevons (1871) makes this point. 
[69] 
Henry Hazlitt makes this point, as do Smith (1776), Jevons (1871), Friedman (2009) and Sowell (2017).

“If a man has been his mother's undisputed darling,” Freud wrote, “he retains throughout life the triumphant feeling, the confidence in success, which not seldom brings actual success along with it.”

In other words, a surplus of maternal love gives the child the self-confidence necessary to succeed, it being the father’s job to temper that self-love with the necessary degree of self-discipline. [120]

Cleckley (1950), Kernberg (1984, 1984b, 1985), Hare (1993). Be it noted that there are different degrees of psychopathy: a given person might have a high degree of professional integrity, and to that extent by non-psychopathic, but otherwise be highly psychopathic. This was the case with Jeffrey MacDonald, the Army doctor who slaughtered his whole family and had no remorse at all doing so. Jeffrey MacDonald's performance as a physician was consistently exemplary, there being no indication that it was in any way corrupted by psychopathy, even though there is no doubt that Dr. MacDonald was otherwise a textbook case of a psychopath. Dr. MacDonald's case is in no way a singularity, there being many cases of psychopaths who, like Dr. MacDonald, are non-psychopathic in specific contexts. See McGuiness (1983).

Explanation of this parenthetical hedge: W.V.O. Quine and Joseph Ullian wrote a book called ‘The Web of Belief’, in which they argue for a form of the ‘network-conception’ of ideas. Also, this conception is also the basis of connectionist theories of ideas, and there are in all likelihood many other anticipations of what Johnson is saying here.
