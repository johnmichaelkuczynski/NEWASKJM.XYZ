PREFATORY 
NOTE 
BY 
THE 
AUTHOR 
If 
this 
Discourse 
appear 
too 
long 
to 
be 
read 
at 
once, 
it 
may 
be 
divided 
into 
six 
Parts: 
and, 
in 
the 
first, 
will 
be 
found 
various 
considerations 
touching 
the 
Sciences; 
in 
the 
second, 
the 
principal 
rules 
of 
the 
Method 
which 
the 
Author 
has 
discovered, 
in 
the 
third, 
certain 
of 
the 
rules 
of 
Morals 
which 
he 
has 
deduced 
from 
this 
Method; 
in 
the 
fourth, 
the 
reasonings 
by 
which 
he 
establishes 
the 
existence 
of 
God 
and 
of 
the 
Human 
Soul, 
which 
are 
the 
foundations 
of 
his 
Metaphysic; 
in 
the 
fifth, 
the 
order 
of 
the 
Physical 
questions 
which 
he 
has 
investigated, 
and, 
in 
particular, 
the 
explication 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
heart 
and 
of 
some 
other 
difficulties 
pertaining 
to 
Medicine, 
as 
also 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
soul 
of 
man 
and 
that 
of 
the 
brutes; 
and, 
in 
the 
last, 
what 
the 
Author 
believes 
to 
be 
required 
in 
order 
to 
greater 
advancement 
in 
the 
investigation 
of 
Nature 
than 
has 
yet 
been 
made, 
with 
the 
reasons 
that 
have 
induced 
him 
to 
write. 


PART 
I 
Good 
sense 
is, 
of 
all 
things 
among 
men, 
the 
most 
equally 
distributed; 
for 
every 
one 
thinks 
himself 
so 
abundantly 
provided 
with 
it, 
that 
those 
even 
who 
are 
the 
most 
difficult 
to 
satisfy 
in 
everything 
else, 
do 
not 
usually 
desire 
a 
larger 
measure 
of 
this 
quality 
than 
they 
already 
possess. 
And 
in 
this 
it 
is 
not 
likely 
that 
all 
are 
mistaken 
the 
conviction 
is 
rather 
to 
be 
held 
as 
testifying 
that 
the 
power 
of 
judging 
aright 
and 
of 
distinguishing 
truth 
from 
error, 
which 
is 
properly 
what 
is 
called 
good 
sense 
or 
reason, 
is 
by 
nature 
equal 
in 
all 
men; 
and 
that 
the 
diversity 
of 
our 
opinions, 
consequently, 
does 
not 
arise 
from 
some 
being 
endowed 
with 
a 
larger 
share 
of 
reason 
than 
others, 
but 
solely 
from 
this, 



that 
we 
conduct 
our 
thoughts 
along 
different 
ways, 
and 
do 
not 
fix 
our 
attention 
on 
the 
same 
objects. 
For 
to 
be 
possessed 
of 
a 
vigorous 
mind 
is 
not 
enough; 
the 
prime 
requisite 
is 
rightly 
to 
apply 
it. 
The 
greatest 
minds, 
as 
they 
are 
capable 
of 
the 
highest 
excellences, 
are 
open 
likewise 
to 
the 
greatest 
aberrations; 
and 
those 
who 
travel 
very 
slowly 
may 
yet 
make 
far 
greater 
progress, 
provided 
they 
keep 
always 
to 
the 
straight 
road, 
than 
those 
who, 
while 
they 
run, 
forsake 
it. 


For 
myself, 
I 
have 
never 
fancied 
my 
mind 
to 
be 
in 
any 
respect 
more 
perfect 
than 
those 
of 
the 
generality; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
I 
have 
often 
wished 
that 
I 
were 
equal 
to 
some 
others 
in 
promptitude 
of 
thought, 
or 
in 
clearness 
and 
distinctness 
of 
imagination, 
or 
in 
fullness 
and 
readiness 
of 
memory. 
And 
besides 
these, 
I 
know 
of 
no 
other 
qualities 
that 
contribute 
to 
the 
perfection 
of 
the 
mind; 
for 
as 
to 
the 
reason 
or 
sense, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
is 
that 
alone 
which 
constitutes 
us 
men, 
and 
distinguishes 
us 
from 
the 
brutes, 
I 
am 
disposed 
to 
believe 
that 
it 
is 
to 
be 
found 
complete 
in 
each 
individual; 
and 
on 
this 
point 
to 
adopt 
the 
common 
opinion 
of 
philosophers, 
who 
say 
that 
the 
difference 
of 
greater 
and 
less 
holds 
only 
among 
the 
accidents, 
and 
not 
among 
the 
forms 
or 
natures 
of 
individuals 
of 
the 
same 
species. 


I 
will 
not 
hesitate, 
however, 
to 
avow 
my 
belief 
that 
it 
has 
been 
my 
singular 
good 
fortune 
to 
have 
very 
early 
in 
life 
fallen 
in 
with 
certain 
tracks 
which 
have 
conducted 
me 
to 
considerations 
and 
maxims, 
of 
which 
I 
have 
formed 
a 
method 
that 
gives 
me 
the 
means, 
as 
I 
think, 
of 
gradually 
augmenting 
my 
knowledge, 
and 
of 
raising 
it 
by 
little 
and 
little 
to 
the 
highest 
point 
which 
the 
mediocrity 
of 
my 
talents 
and 
the 
brief 
duration 
of 
my 
life 
will 
permit 
me 
to 
reach. 
For 
I 
have 
already 
reaped 
from 
it 
such 
fruits 
that, 
although 
I 
have 
been 
accustomed 
to 
think 
lowly 
enough 
of 
myself, 
and 
although 
when 
I 
look 
with 
the 
eye 
of 
a 
philosopher 
at 
the 
varied 
courses 
and 
pursuits 
of 
mankind 
at 
large, 
I 
find 
scarcely 
one 
which 
does 
not 
appear 
in 
vain 
and 
useless, 
I 
nevertheless 
derive 
the 
highest 
satisfaction 
from 
the 
progress 
I 
conceive 
myself 
to 
have 
already 
made 
in 
the 
search 
after 
truth, 
and 
cannot 
help 
entertaining 
such 
expectations 
of 
the 
future 
as 
to 
believe 
that 
if, 
among 
the 
occupations 
of 
men 
as 
men, 
there 
is 
any 
one 
really 
excellent 
and 
important, 
it 
is 
that 
which 
I 
have 
chosen. 


After 
all, 
it 
is 
possible 
I 
may 
be 
mistaken; 
and 
it 
is 
but 
a 
little 
copper 
and 



glass, 
perhaps, 
that 
I 
take 
for 
gold 
and 
diamonds. 
I 
know 
how 
very 
liable 
we 
are 
to 
delusion 
in 
what 
relates 
to 
ourselves, 
and 
also 
how 
much 
the 
judgments 
of 
our 
friends 
are 
to 
be 
suspected 
when 
given 
in 
our 
favor. 
But 
I 
shall 
endeavor 
in 
this 
discourse 
to 
describe 
the 
paths 
I 
have 
followed, 
and 
to 
delineate 
my 
life 
as 
in 
a 
picture, 
in 
order 
that 
each 
one 
may 
also 
be 
able 
to 
judge 
of 
them 
for 
himself, 
and 
that 
in 
the 
general 
opinion 
entertained 
of 
them, 
as 
gathered 
from 
current 
report, 
I 
myself 
may 
have 
a 
new 
help 
towards 
instruction 
to 
be 
added 
to 
those 
I 
have 
been 
in 
the 
habit 
of 
employing. 


My 
present 
design, 
then, 
is 
not 
to 
teach 
the 
method 
which 
each 
ought 
to 
follow 
for 
the 
right 
conduct 
of 
his 
reason, 
but 
solely 
to 
describe 
the 
way 
in 
which 
I 
have 
endeavored 
to 
conduct 
my 
own. 
They 
who 
set 
themselves 
to 
give 
precepts 
must 
of 
course 
regard 
themselves 
as 
possessed 
of 
greater 
skill 
than 
those 
to 
whom 
they 
prescribe; 
and 
if 
they 
err 
in 
the 
slightest 
particular, 
they 
subject 
themselves 
to 
censure. 
But 
as 
this 
tract 
is 
put 
forth 
merely 
as 
a 
history, 
or, 
if 
you 
will, 
as 
a 
tale, 
in 
which, 
amid 
some 
examples 
worthy 
of 
imitation, 
there 
will 
be 
found, 
perhaps, 
as 
many 
more 
which 
it 
were 
advisable 
not 
to 
follow, 
I 
hope 
it 
will 
prove 
useful 
to 
some 
without 
being 
hurtful 
to 
any, 
and 
that 
my 
openness 
will 
find 
some 
favor 
with 
all. 


From 
my 
childhood, 
I 
have 
been 
familiar 
with 
letters; 
and 
as 
I 
was 
given 
to 
believe 
that 
by 
their 
help 
a 
clear 
and 
certain 
knowledge 
of 
all 
that 
is 
useful 
in 
life 
might 
be 
acquired, 
I 
was 
ardently 
desirous 
of 
instruction. 
But 
as 
soon 
as 
I 
had 
finished 
the 
entire 
course 
of 
study, 
at 
the 
close 
of 
which 
it 
is 
customary 
to 
be 
admitted 
into 
the 
order 
of 
the 
learned, 
I 
completely 
changed 
my 
opinion. 
For 
I 
found 
myself 
involved 
in 
so 
many 
doubts 
and 
errors, 
that 
I 
was 
convinced 
I 
had 
advanced 
no 
farther 
in 
all 
my 
attempts 
at 
learning, 
than 
the 
discovery 
at 
every 
turn 
of 
my 
own 
ignorance. 
And 
yet 
I 
was 
studying 
in 
one 
of 
the 
most 
celebrated 
schools 
in 
Europe, 
in 
which 
I 
thought 
there 
must 
be 
learned 
men, 
if 
such 
were 
anywhere 
to 
be 
found. 
I 
had 
been 
taught 
all 
that 
others 
learned 
there; 
and 
not 
contented 
with 
the 
sciences 
actually 
taught 
us, 
I 
had, 
in 
addition, 
read 
all 
the 
books 
that 
had 
fallen 
into 
my 
hands, 
treating 
of 
such 
branches 
as 
are 
esteemed 
the 
most 
curious 
and 
rare. 
I 
knew 
the 
judgment 
which 
others 
had 
formed 
of 
me; 
and 
I 
did 
not 
find 
that 
I 
was 
considered 
inferior 
to 
my 
fellows, 
although 
there 
were 
among 
them 
some 
who 
were 
already 
marked 
out 
to 
fill 
the 
places 
of 
our 
instructors. 
And, 
in 



fine, 
our 
age 
appeared 
to 
me 
as 
flourishing, 
and 
as 
fertile 
in 
powerful 
minds 
as 
any 
preceding 
one. 
I 
was 
thus 
led 
to 
take 
the 
liberty 
of 
judging 
of 
all 
other 
men 
by 
myself, 
and 
of 
concluding 
that 
there 
was 
no 
science 
in 
existence 
that 
was 
of 
such 
a 
nature 
as 
I 
had 
previously 
been 
given 
to 
believe. 


I 
still 
continued, 
however, 
to 
hold 
in 
esteem 
the 
studies 
of 
the 
schools. 
I 
was 
aware 
that 
the 
languages 
taught 
in 
them 
are 
necessary 
to 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
writings 
of 
the 
ancients; 
that 
the 
grace 
of 
fable 
stirs 
the 
mind; 
that 
the 
memorable 
deeds 
of 
history 
elevate 
it; 
and, 
if 
read 
with 
discretion, 
aid 
in 
forming 
the 
judgment; 
that 
the 
perusal 
of 
all 
excellent 
books 
is, 
as 
it 
were, 
to 
interview 
with 
the 
noblest 
men 
of 
past 
ages, 
who 
have 
written 
them, 
and 
even 
a 
studied 
interview, 
in 
which 
are 
discovered 
to 
us 
only 
their 
choicest 
thoughts; 
that 
eloquence 
has 
incomparable 
force 
and 
beauty; 
that 
poesy 
has 
its 
ravishing 
graces 
and 
delights; 
that 
in 
the 
mathematics 
there 
are 
many 
refined 
discoveries 
eminently 
suited 
to 
gratify 
the 
inquisitive, 
as 
well 
as 
further 
all 
the 
arts 
an 
lessen 
the 
labour 
of 
man; 
that 
numerous 
highly 
useful 
precepts 
and 
exhortations 
to 
virtue 
are 
contained 
in 
treatises 
on 
morals; 
that 
theology 
points 
out 
the 
path 
to 
heaven; 
that 
philosophy 
affords 
the 
means 
of 
discoursing 
with 
an 
appearance 
of 
truth 
on 
all 
matters, 
and 
commands 
the 
admiration 
of 
the 
more 
simple; 
that 
jurisprudence, 
medicine, 
and 
the 
other 
sciences, 
secure 
for 
their 
cultivators 
honors 
and 
riches; 
and, 
in 
fine, 
that 
it 
is 
useful 
to 
bestow 
some 
attention 
upon 
all, 
even 
upon 
those 
abounding 
the 
most 
in 
superstition 
and 
error, 
that 
we 
may 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
determine 
their 
real 
value, 
and 
guard 
against 
being 
deceived. 


But 
I 
believed 
that 
I 
had 
already 
given 
sufficient 
time 
to 
languages, 
and 
likewise 
to 
the 
reading 
of 
the 
writings 
of 
the 
ancients, 
to 
their 
histories 
and 
fables. 
For 
to 
hold 
converse 
with 
those 
of 
other 
ages 
and 
to 
travel, 
are 
almost 
the 
same 
thing. 
It 
is 
useful 
to 
know 
something 
of 
the 
manners 
of 
different 
nations, 
that 
we 
may 
be 
enabled 
to 
form 
a 
more 
correct 
judgment 
regarding 
our 
own, 
and 
be 
prevented 
from 
thinking 
that 
everything 
contrary 
to 
our 
customs 
is 
ridiculous 
and 
irrational, 
a 
conclusion 
usually 
come 
to 
by 
those 
whose 
experience 
has 
been 
limited 
to 
their 
own 
country. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
when 
too 
much 
time 
is 
occupied 
in 
traveling, 
we 
become 
strangers 
to 
our 
native 
country; 
and 
the 
over 
curious 
in 
the 
customs 
of 
the 
past 
are 
generally 



ignorant 
of 
those 
of 
the 
present. 
Besides, 
fictitious 
narratives 
lead 
us 
to 
imagine 
the 
possibility 
of 
many 
events 
that 
are 
impossible; 
and 
even 
the 
most 
faithful 
histories, 
if 
they 
do 
not 
wholly 
misrepresent 
matters, 
or 
exaggerate 
their 
importance 
to 
render 
the 
account 
of 
them 
more 
worthy 
of 
perusal, 
omit, 
at 
least, 
almost 
always 
the 
meanest 
and 
least 
striking 
of 
the 
attendant 
circumstances; 
hence 
it 
happens 
that 
the 
remainder 
does 
not 
represent 
the 
truth, 
and 
that 
such 
as 
regulate 
their 
conduct 
by 
examples 
drawn 
from 
this 
source, 
are 
apt 
to 
fall 
into 
the 
extravagances 
of 
the 
knight-errants 
of 
romance, 
and 
to 
entertain 
projects 
that 
exceed 
their 
powers. 


I 
esteemed 
eloquence 
highly, 
and 
was 
in 
raptures 
with 
poesy; 
but 
I 
thought 
that 
both 
were 
gifts 
of 
nature 
rather 
than 
fruits 
of 
study. 
Those 
in 
whom 
the 
faculty 
of 
reason 
is 
predominant, 
and 
who 
most 
skillfully 
dispose 
their 
thoughts 
with 
a 
view 
to 
render 
them 
clear 
and 
intelligible, 
are 
always 
the 
best 
able 
to 
persuade 
others 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
what 
they 
lay 
down, 
though 
they 
should 
speak 
only 
in 
the 
language 
of 
Lower 
Brittany, 
and 
be 
wholly 
ignorant 
of 
the 
rules 
of 
rhetoric; 
and 
those 
whose 
minds 
are 
stored 
with 
the 
most 
agreeable 
fancies, 
and 
who 
can 
give 
expression 
to 
them 
with 
the 
greatest 
embellishment 
and 
harmony, 
are 
still 
the 
best 
poets, 
though 
unacquainted 
with 
the 
art 
of 
poetry. 


I 
was 
especially 
delighted 
with 
the 
mathematics, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
certitude 
and 
evidence 
of 
their 
reasonings; 
but 
I 
had 
not 
as 
yet 
a 
precise 
knowledge 
of 
their 
true 
use; 
and 
thinking 
that 
they 
but 
contributed 
to 
the 
advancement 
of 
the 
mechanical 
arts, 
I 
was 
astonished 
that 
foundations, 
so 
strong 
and 
solid, 
should 
have 
had 
no 
loftier 
superstructure 
reared 
on 
them. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
I 
compared 
the 
disquisitions 
of 
the 
ancient 
moralists 
to 
very 
towering 
and 
magnificent 
palaces 
with 
no 
better 
foundation 
than 
sand 
and 
mud: 
they 
laud 
the 
virtues 
very 
highly, 
and 
exhibit 
them 
as 
estimable 
far 
above 
anything 
on 
earth; 
but 
they 
give 
us 
no 
adequate 
criterion 
of 
virtue, 
and 
frequently 
that 
which 
they 
designate 
with 
so 
fine 
a 
name 
is 
but 
apathy, 
or 
pride, 
or 
despair, 
or 
parricide. 


I 
revered 
our 
theology, 
and 
aspired 
as 
much 
as 
any 
one 
to 
reach 
heaven: 
but 
being 
given 
assuredly 
to 
understand 
that 
the 
way 
is 
not 
less 
open 
to 
the 
most 
ignorant 
than 
to 
the 
most 
learned, 
and 
that 
the 
revealed 
truths 
which 
lead 
to 
heaven 
are 
above 
our 
comprehension, 
I 
did 
not 
presume 
to 
subject 



them 
to 
the 
impotency 
of 
my 
reason; 
and 
I 
thought 
that 
in 
order 
competently 
to 
undertake 
their 
examination, 
there 
was 
need 
of 
some 
special 
help 
from 
heaven, 
and 
of 
being 
more 
than 
man. 


Of 
philosophy 
I 
will 
say 
nothing, 
except 
that 
when 
I 
saw 
that 
it 
had 
been 
cultivated 
for 
many 
ages 
by 
the 
most 
distinguished 
men, 
and 
that 
yet 
there 
is 
not 
a 
single 
matter 
within 
its 
sphere 
which 
is 
not 
still 
in 
dispute, 
and 
nothing, 
therefore, 
which 
is 
above 
doubt, 
I 
did 
not 
presume 
to 
anticipate 
that 
my 
success 
would 
be 
greater 
in 
it 
than 
that 
of 
others; 
and 
further, 
when 
I 
considered 
the 
number 
of 
conflicting 
opinions 
touching 
a 
single 
matter 
that 
may 
be 
upheld 
by 
learned 
men, 
while 
there 
can 
be 
but 
one 
true, 
I 
reckoned 
as 
well-nigh 
false 
all 
that 
was 
only 
probable. 


As 
to 
the 
other 
sciences, 
inasmuch 
as 
these 
borrow 
their 
principles 
from 
philosophy, 
I 
judged 
that 
no 
solid 
superstructures 
could 
be 
reared 
on 
foundations 
so 
infirm; 
and 
neither 
the 
honor 
nor 
the 
gain 
held 
out 
by 
them 
was 
sufficient 
to 
determine 
me 
to 
their 
cultivation: 
for 
I 
was 
not, 
thank 
Heaven, 
in 
a 
condition 
which 
compelled 
me 
to 
make 
merchandise 
of 
science 
for 
the 
bettering 
of 
my 
fortune; 
and 
though 
I 
might 
not 
profess 
to 
scorn 
glory 
as 
a 
cynic, 
I 
yet 
made 
very 
slight 
account 
of 
that 
honor 
which 
I 
hoped 
to 
acquire 
only 
through 
fictitious 
titles. 
And, 
in 
fine, 
of 
false 
sciences 
I 
thought 
I 
knew 
the 
worth 
sufficiently 
to 
escape 
being 
deceived 
by 
the 
professions 
of 
an 
alchemist, 
the 
predictions 
of 
an 
astrologer, 
the 
impostures 
of 
a 
magician, 
or 
by 
the 
artifices 
and 
boasting 
of 
any 
of 
those 
who 
profess 
to 
know 
things 
of 
which 
they 
are 
ignorant. 


For 
these 
reasons, 
as 
soon 
as 
my 
age 
permitted 
me 
to 
pass 
from 
under 
the 
control 
of 
my 
instructors, 
I 
entirely 
abandoned 
the 
study 
of 
letters, 
and 
resolved 
no 
longer 
to 
seek 
any 
other 
science 
than 
the 
knowledge 
of 
myself, 
or 
of 
the 
great 
book 
of 
the 
world. 
I 
spent 
the 
remainder 
of 
my 
youth 
in 
traveling, 
in 
visiting 
courts 
and 
armies, 
in 
holding 
intercourse 
with 
men 
of 
different 
dispositions 
and 
ranks, 
in 
collecting 
varied 
experience, 
in 
proving 
myself 
in 
the 
different 
situations 
into 
which 
fortune 
threw 
me, 
and, 
above 
all, 
in 
making 
such 
reflection 
on 
the 
matter 
of 
my 
experience 
as 
to 
secure 
my 
improvement. 
For 
it 
occurred 
to 
me 
that 
I 
should 
find 
much 
more 
truth 
in 
the 
reasonings 
of 
each 
individual 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
affairs 
in 
which 
he 
is 
personally 
interested, 
and 
the 
issue 
of 
which 
must 
presently 
punish 
him 
if 
he 



has 
judged 
amiss, 
than 
in 
those 
conducted 
by 
a 
man 
of 
letters 
in 
his 
study, 
regarding 
speculative 
matters 
that 
are 
of 
no 
practical 
moment, 
and 
followed 
by 
no 
consequences 
to 
himself, 
farther, 
perhaps, 
than 
that 
they 
foster 
his 
vanity 
the 
better 
the 
more 
remote 
they 
are 
from 
common 
sense; 
requiring, 
as 
they 
must 
in 
this 
case, 
the 
exercise 
of 
greater 
ingenuity 
and 
art 
to 
render 
them 
probable. 
In 
addition, 
I 
had 
always 
a 
most 
earnest 
desire 
to 
know 
how 
to 
distinguish 
the 
true 
from 
the 
false, 
in 
order 
that 
I 
might 
be 
able 
clearly 
to 
discriminate 
the 
right 
path 
in 
life, 
and 
proceed 
in 
it 
with 
confidence. 


It 
is 
true 
that, 
while 
busied 
only 
in 
considering 
the 
manners 
of 
other 
men, 
I 
found 
here, 
too, 
scarce 
any 
ground 
for 
settled 
conviction, 
and 
remarked 
hardly 
less 
contradiction 
among 
them 
than 
in 
the 
opinions 
of 
the 
philosophers. 
So 
that 
the 
greatest 
advantage 
I 
derived 
from 
the 
study 
consisted 
in 
this, 
that, 
observing 
many 
things 
which, 
however 
extravagant 
and 
ridiculous 
to 
our 
apprehension, 
are 
yet 
by 
common 
consent 
received 
and 
approved 
by 
other 
great 
nations, 
I 
learned 
to 
entertain 
too 
decided 
a 
belief 
in 
regard 
to 
nothing 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
which 
I 
had 
been 
persuaded 
merely 
by 
example 
and 
custom; 
and 
thus 
I 
gradually 
extricated 
myself 
from 
many 
errors 
powerful 
enough 
to 
darken 
our 
natural 
intelligence, 
and 
incapacitate 
us 
in 
great 
measure 
from 
listening 
to 
reason. 
But 
after 
I 
had 
been 
occupied 
several 
years 
in 
thus 
studying 
the 
book 
of 
the 
world, 
and 
in 
essaying 
to 
gather 
some 
experience, 
I 
at 
length 
resolved 
to 
make 
myself 
an 
object 
of 
study, 
and 
to 
employ 
all 
the 
powers 
of 
my 
mind 
in 
choosing 
the 
paths 
I 
ought 
to 
follow, 
an 
undertaking 
which 
was 
accompanied 
with 
greater 
success 
than 
it 
would 
have 
been 
had 
I 
never 
quitted 
my 
country 
or 
my 
books. 


PART 
II 


I 
was 
then 
in 
Germany, 
attracted 
thither 
by 
the 
wars 
in 
that 
country, 
which 
have 
not 
yet 
been 
brought 
to 
a 
termination; 
and 
as 
I 
was 
returning 
to 
the 
army 
from 
the 
coronation 
of 
the 
emperor, 
the 
setting 
in 
of 
winter 
arrested 
me 
in 
a 
locality 
where, 
as 
I 
found 
no 
society 
to 
interest 
me, 
and 
was 
besides 
fortunately 
undisturbed 
by 
any 
cares 
or 
passions, 
I 
remained 
the 
whole 
day 
in 



seclusion, 
with 
full 
opportunity 
to 
occupy 
my 
attention 
with 
my 
own 
thoughts. 
Of 
these 
one 
of 
the 
very 
first 
that 
occurred 
to 
me 
was, 
that 
there 
is 
seldom 
so 
much 
perfection 
in 
works 
composed 
of 
many 
separate 
parts, 
upon 
which 
different 
hands 
had 
been 
employed, 
as 
in 
those 
completed 
by 
a 
single 
master. 
Thus 
it 
is 
observable 
that 
the 
buildings 
which 
a 
single 
architect 
has 
planned 
and 
executed, 
are 
generally 
more 
elegant 
and 
commodious 
than 
those 
which 
several 
have 
attempted 
to 
improve, 
by 
making 
old 
walls 
serve 
for 
purposes 
for 
which 
they 
were 
not 
originally 
built. 
Thus 
also, 
those 
ancient 
cities 
which, 
from 
being 
at 
first 
only 
villages, 
have 
become, 
in 
course 
of 
time, 
large 
towns, 
are 
usually 
but 
ill 
laid 
out 
compared 
with 
the 
regularity 
constructed 
towns 
which 
a 
professional 
architect 
has 
freely 
planned 
on 
an 
open 
plain; 
so 
that 
although 
the 
several 
buildings 
of 
the 
former 
may 
often 
equal 
or 
surpass 
in 
beauty 
those 
of 
the 
latter, 
yet 
when 
one 
observes 
their 
indiscriminate 
juxtaposition, 
there 
a 
large 
one 
and 
here 
a 
small, 
and 
the 
consequent 
crookedness 
and 
irregularity 
of 
the 
streets, 
one 
is 
disposed 
to 
allege 
that 
chance 
rather 
than 
any 
human 
will 
guided 
by 
reason 
must 
have 
led 
to 
such 
an 
arrangement. 
And 
if 
we 
consider 
that 
nevertheless 
there 
have 
been 
at 
all 
times 
certain 
officers 
whose 
duty 
it 
was 
to 
see 
that 
private 
buildings 
contributed 
to 
public 
ornament, 
the 
difficulty 
of 
reaching 
high 
perfection 
with 
but 
the 
materials 
of 
others 
to 
operate 
on, 
will 
be 
readily 
acknowledged. 
In 
the 
same 
way 
I 
fancied 
that 
those 
nations 
which, 
starting 
from 
a 
semi-barbarous 
state 
and 
advancing 
to 
civilization 
by 
slow 
degrees, 
have 
had 
their 
laws 
successively 
determined, 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
forced 
upon 
them 
simply 
by 
experience 
of 
the 
hurtfulness 
of 
particular 
crimes 
and 
disputes, 
would 
by 
this 
process 
come 
to 
be 
possessed 
of 
less 
perfect 
institutions 
than 
those 
which, 
from 
the 
commencement 
of 
their 
association 
as 
communities, 
have 
followed 
the 
appointments 
of 
some 
wise 
legislator. 
It 
is 
thus 
quite 
certain 
that 
the 
constitution 
of 
the 
true 
religion, 
the 
ordinances 
of 
which 
are 
derived 
from 
God, 
must 
be 
incomparably 
superior 
to 
that 
of 
every 
other. 
And, 
to 
speak 
of 
human 
affairs, 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
pre-eminence 
of 
Sparta 
was 
due 
not 
to 
the 
goodness 
of 
each 
of 
its 
laws 
in 
particular, 
for 
many 
of 
these 
were 
very 
strange, 
and 
even 
opposed 
to 
good 
morals, 
but 
to 
the 
circumstance 
that, 
originated 
by 
a 
single 
individual, 
they 
all 
tended 
to 
a 
single 
end. 
In 
the 
same 
way 
I 
thought 
that 
the 
sciences 
contained 
in 
books 
(such 
of 
them 
at 
least 
as 
are 
made 
up 
of 
probable 
reasonings, 
without 
demonstrations), 
composed 
as 
they 
are 
of 
the 
opinions 
of 
many 
different 
individuals 
massed 
together, 
are 



farther 
removed 
from 
truth 
than 
the 
simple 
inferences 
which 
a 
man 
of 
good 
sense 
using 
his 
natural 
and 
unprejudiced 
judgment 
draws 
respecting 
the 
matters 
of 
his 
experience. 
And 
because 
we 
have 
all 
to 
pass 
through 
a 
state 
of 
infancy 
to 
manhood, 
and 
have 
been 
of 
necessity, 
for 
a 
length 
of 
time, 
governed 
by 
our 
desires 
and 
preceptors 
(whose 
dictates 
were 
frequently 
conflicting, 
while 
neither 
perhaps 
always 
counseled 
us 
for 
the 
best), 
I 
farther 
concluded 
that 
it 
is 
almost 
impossible 
that 
our 
judgments 
can 
be 
so 
correct 
or 
solid 
as 
they 
would 
have 
been, 
had 
our 
reason 
been 
mature 
from 
the 
moment 
of 
our 
birth, 
and 
had 
we 
always 
been 
guided 
by 
it 
alone. 


It 
is 
true, 
however, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
customary 
to 
pull 
down 
all 
the 
houses 
of 
a 
town 
with 
the 
single 
design 
of 
rebuilding 
them 
differently, 
and 
thereby 
rendering 
the 
streets 
more 
handsome; 
but 
it 
often 
happens 
that 
a 
private 
individual 
takes 
down 
his 
own 
with 
the 
view 
of 
erecting 
it 
anew, 
and 
that 
people 
are 
even 
sometimes 
constrained 
to 
this 
when 
their 
houses 
are 
in 
danger 
of 
falling 
from 
age, 
or 
when 
the 
foundations 
are 
insecure. 
With 
this 
before 
me 
by 
way 
of 
example, 
I 
was 
persuaded 
that 
it 
would 
indeed 
be 
preposterous 
for 
a 
private 
individual 
to 
think 
of 
reforming 
a 
state 
by 
fundamentally 
changing 
it 
throughout, 
and 
overturning 
it 
in 
order 
to 
set 
it 
up 
amended; 
and 
the 
same 
I 
thought 
was 
true 
of 
any 
similar 
project 
for 
reforming 
the 
body 
of 
the 
sciences, 
or 
the 
order 
of 
teaching 
them 
established 
in 
the 
schools: 
but 
as 
for 
the 
opinions 
which 
up 
to 
that 
time 
I 
had 
embraced, 
I 
thought 
that 
I 
could 
not 
do 
better 
than 
resolve 
at 
once 
to 
sweep 
them 
wholly 
away, 
that 
I 
might 
afterwards 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
admit 
either 
others 
more 
correct, 
or 
even 
perhaps 
the 
same 
when 
they 
had 
undergone 
the 
scrutiny 
of 
reason. 
I 
firmly 
believed 
that 
in 
this 
way 
I 
should 
much 
better 
succeed 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
my 
life, 
than 
if 
I 
built 
only 
upon 
old 
foundations, 
and 
leaned 
upon 
principles 
which, 
in 
my 
youth, 
I 
had 
taken 
upon 
trust. 
For 
although 
I 
recognized 
various 
difficulties 
in 
this 
undertaking, 
these 
were 
not, 
however, 
without 
remedy, 
nor 
once 
to 
be 
compared 
with 
such 
as 
attend 
the 
slightest 
reformation 
in 
public 
affairs. 
Large 
bodies, 
if 
once 
overthrown, 
are 
with 
great 
difficulty 
set 
up 
again, 
or 
even 
kept 
erect 
when 
once 
seriously 
shaken, 
and 
the 
fall 
of 
such 
is 
always 
disastrous. 
Then 
if 
there 
are 
any 
imperfections 
in 
the 
constitutions 
of 
states 
(and 
that 
many 
such 
exist 
the 
diversity 
of 
constitutions 
is 
alone 
sufficient 
to 
assure 
us), 
custom 
has 
without 
doubt 
materially 
smoothed 
their 
inconveniences, 
and 
has 
even 
managed 
to 
steer 



altogether 
clear 
of, 
or 
insensibly 
corrected 
a 
number 
which 
sagacity 
could 
not 
have 
provided 
against 
with 
equal 
effect; 
and, 
in 
fine, 
the 
defects 
are 
almost 
always 
more 
tolerable 
than 
the 
change 
necessary 
for 
their 
removal; 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
that 
highways 
which 
wind 
among 
mountains, 
by 
being 
much 
frequented, 
become 
gradually 
so 
smooth 
and 
commodious, 
that 
it 
is 
much 
better 
to 
follow 
them 
than 
to 
seek 
a 
straighter 
path 
by 
climbing 
over 
the 
tops 
of 
rocks 
and 
descending 
to 
the 
bottoms 
of 
precipices. 


Hence 
it 
is 
that 
I 
cannot 
in 
any 
degree 
approve 
of 
those 
restless 
and 
busy 
meddlers 
who, 
called 
neither 
by 
birth 
nor 
fortune 
to 
take 
part 
in 
the 
management 
of 
public 
affairs, 
are 
yet 
always 
projecting 
reforms; 
and 
if 
I 
thought 
that 
this 
tract 
contained 
aught 
which 
might 
justify 
the 
suspicion 
that 
I 
was 
a 
victim 
of 
such 
folly, 
I 
would 
by 
no 
means 
permit 
its 
publication. 
I 
have 
never 
contemplated 
anything 
higher 
than 
the 
reformation 
of 
my 
own 
opinions, 
and 
basing 
them 
on 
a 
foundation 
wholly 
my 
own. 
And 
although 
my 
own 
satisfaction 
with 
my 
work 
has 
led 
me 
to 
present 
here 
a 
draft 
of 
it, 
I 
do 
not 
by 
any 
means 
therefore 
recommend 
to 
every 
one 
else 
to 
make 
a 
similar 
attempt. 
Those 
whom 
God 
has 
endowed 
with 
a 
larger 
measure 
of 
genius 
will 
entertain, 
perhaps, 
designs 
still 
more 
exalted; 
but 
for 
the 
many 
I 
am 
much 
afraid 
lest 
even 
the 
present 
undertaking 
be 
more 
than 
they 
can 
safely 
venture 
to 
imitate. 
The 
single 
design 
to 
strip 
one's 
self 
of 
all 
past 
beliefs 
is 
one 
that 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
taken 
by 
every 
one. 
The 
majority 
of 
men 
is 
composed 
of 
two 
classes, 
for 
neither 
of 
which 
would 
this 
be 
at 
all 
a 
befitting 
resolution: 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
of 
those 
who 
with 
more 
than 
a 
due 
confidence 
in 
their 
own 
powers, 
are 
precipitate 
in 
their 
judgments 
and 
want 
the 
patience 
requisite 
for 
orderly 
and 
circumspect 
thinking; 
whence 
it 
happens, 
that 
if 
men 
of 
this 
class 
once 
take 
the 
liberty 
to 
doubt 
of 
their 
accustomed 
opinions, 
and 
quit 
the 
beaten 
highway, 
they 
will 
never 
be 
able 
to 
thread 
the 
byway 
that 
would 
lead 
them 
by 
a 
shorter 
course, 
and 
will 
lose 
themselves 
and 
continue 
to 
wander 
for 
life; 
in 
the 
second 
place, 
of 
those 
who, 
possessed 
of 
sufficient 
sense 
or 
modesty 
to 
determine 
that 
there 
are 
others 
who 
excel 
them 
in 
the 
power 
of 
discriminating 
between 
truth 
and 
error, 
and 
by 
whom 
they 
may 
be 
instructed, 
ought 
rather 
to 
content 
themselves 
with 
the 
opinions 
of 
such 
than 
trust 
for 
more 
correct 
to 
their 
own 
reason. 


For 
my 
own 
part, 
I 
should 
doubtless 
have 
belonged 
to 
the 
latter 
class, 
had 



I 
received 
instruction 
from 
but 
one 
master, 
or 
had 
I 
never 
known 
the 
diversities 
of 
opinion 
that 
from 
time 
immemorial 
have 
prevailed 
among 
men 
of 
the 
greatest 
learning. 
But 
I 
had 
become 
aware, 
even 
so 
early 
as 
during 
my 
college 
life, 
that 
no 
opinion, 
however 
absurd 
and 
incredible, 
can 
be 
imagined, 
which 
has 
not 
been 
maintained 
by 
some 
on 
of 
the 
philosophers; 
and 
afterwards 
in 
the 
course 
of 
my 
travels 
I 
remarked 
that 
all 
those 
whose 
opinions 
are 
decidedly 
repugnant 
to 
ours 
are 
not 
in 
that 
account 
barbarians 
and 
savages, 
but 
on 
the 
contrary 
that 
many 
of 
these 
nations 
make 
an 
equally 
good, 
if 
not 
better, 
use 
of 
their 
reason 
than 
we 
do. 
I 
took 
into 
account 
also 
the 
very 
different 
character 
which 
a 
person 
brought 
up 
from 
infancy 
in 
France 
or 
Germany 
exhibits, 
from 
that 
which, 
with 
the 
same 
mind 
originally, 
this 
individual 
would 
have 
possessed 
had 
he 
lived 
always 
among 
the 
Chinese 
or 
with 
savages, 
and 
the 
circumstance 
that 
in 
dress 
itself 
the 
fashion 
which 
pleased 
us 
ten 
years 
ago, 
and 
which 
may 
again, 
perhaps, 
be 
received 
into 
favor 
before 
ten 
years 
have 
gone, 
appears 
to 
us 
at 
this 
moment 
extravagant 
and 
ridiculous. 
I 
was 
thus 
led 
to 
infer 
that 
the 
ground 
of 
our 
opinions 
is 
far 
more 
custom 
and 
example 
than 
any 
certain 
knowledge. 
And, 
finally, 
although 
such 
be 
the 
ground 
of 
our 
opinions, 
I 
remarked 
that 
a 
plurality 
of 
suffrages 
is 
no 
guarantee 
of 
truth 
where 
it 
is 
at 
all 
of 
difficult 
discovery, 
as 
in 
such 
cases 
it 
is 
much 
more 
likely 
that 
it 
will 
be 
found 
by 
one 
than 
by 
many. 
I 
could, 
however, 
select 
from 
the 
crowd 
no 
one 
whose 
opinions 
seemed 
worthy 
of 
preference, 
and 
thus 
I 
found 
myself 
constrained, 
as 
it 
were, 
to 
use 
my 
own 
reason 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
my 
life. 


But 
like 
one 
walking 
alone 
and 
in 
the 
dark, 
I 
resolved 
to 
proceed 
so 
slowly 
and 
with 
such 
circumspection, 
that 
if 
I 
did 
not 
advance 
far, 
I 
would 
at 
least 
guard 
against 
falling. 
I 
did 
not 
even 
choose 
to 
dismiss 
summarily 
any 
of 
the 
opinions 
that 
had 
crept 
into 
my 
belief 
without 
having 
been 
introduced 
by 
reason, 
but 
first 
of 
all 
took 
sufficient 
time 
carefully 
to 
satisfy 
myself 
of 
the 
general 
nature 
of 
the 
task 
I 
was 
setting 
myself, 
and 
ascertain 
the 
true 
method 
by 
which 
to 
arrive 
at 
the 
knowledge 
of 
whatever 
lay 
within 
the 
compass 
of 
my 
powers. 


Among 
the 
branches 
of 
philosophy, 
I 
had, 
at 
an 
earlier 
period, 
given 
some 
attention 
to 
logic, 
and 
among 
those 
of 
the 
mathematics 
to 
geometrical 
analysis 
and 
algebra,--three 
arts 
or 
sciences 
which 
ought, 
as 
I 
conceived, 
to 



contribute 
something 
to 
my 
design. 
But, 
on 
examination, 
I 
found 
that, 
as 
for 
logic, 
its 
syllogisms 
and 
the 
majority 
of 
its 
other 
precepts 
are 
of 
avail--rather 
in 
the 
communication 
of 
what 
we 
already 
know, 
or 
even 
as 
the 
art 
of 
Lully, 
in 
speaking 
without 
judgment 
of 
things 
of 
which 
we 
are 
ignorant, 
than 
in 
the 
investigation 
of 
the 
unknown; 
and 
although 
this 
science 
contains 
indeed 
a 
number 
of 
correct 
and 
very 
excellent 
precepts, 
there 
are, 
nevertheless, 
so 
many 
others, 
and 
these 
either 
injurious 
or 
superfluous, 
mingled 
with 
the 
former, 
that 
it 
is 
almost 
quite 
as 
difficult 
to 
effect 
a 
severance 
of 
the 
true 
from 
the 
false 
as 
it 
is 
to 
extract 
a 
Diana 
or 
a 
Minerva 
from 
a 
rough 
block 
of 
marble. 
Then 
as 
to 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
ancients 
and 
the 
algebra 
of 
the 
moderns, 
besides 
that 
they 
embrace 
only 
matters 
highly 
abstract, 
and, 
to 
appearance, 
of 
no 
use, 
the 
former 
is 
so 
exclusively 
restricted 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
figures, 
that 
it 
can 
exercise 
the 
understanding 
only 
on 
condition 
of 
greatly 
fatiguing 
the 
imagination; 
and, 
in 
the 
latter, 
there 
is 
so 
complete 
a 
subjection 
to 
certain 
rules 
and 
formulas, 
that 
there 
results 
an 
art 
full 
of 
confusion 
and 
obscurity 
calculated 
to 
embarrass, 
instead 
of 
a 
science 
fitted 
to 
cultivate 
the 
mind. 
By 
these 
considerations 
I 
was 
induced 
to 
seek 
some 
other 
method 
which 
would 
comprise 
the 
advantages 
of 
the 
three 
and 
be 
exempt 
from 
their 
defects. 
And 
as 
a 
multitude 
of 
laws 
often 
only 
hampers 
justice, 
so 
that 
a 
state 
is 
best 
governed 
when, 
with 
few 
laws, 
these 
are 
rigidly 
administered; 
in 
like 
manner, 
instead 
of 
the 
great 
number 
of 
precepts 
of 
which 
logic 
is 
composed, 
I 
believed 
that 
the 
four 
following 
would 
prove 
perfectly 
sufficient 
for 
me, 
provided 
I 
took 
the 
firm 
and 
unwavering 
resolution 
never 
in 
a 
single 
instance 
to 
fail 
in 
observing 
them. 


The 
first 
was 
never 
to 
accept 
anything 
for 
true 
which 
I 
did 
not 
clearly 
know 
to 
be 
such; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
carefully 
to 
avoid 
precipitancy 
and 
prejudice, 
and 
to 
comprise 
nothing 
more 
in 
my 
judgement 
than 
what 
was 
presented 
to 
my 
mind 
so 
clearly 
and 
distinctly 
as 
to 
exclude 
all 
ground 
of 
doubt. 


The 
second, 
to 
divide 
each 
of 
the 
difficulties 
under 
examination 
into 
as 
many 
parts 
as 
possible, 
and 
as 
might 
be 
necessary 
for 
its 
adequate 
solution. 


The 
third, 
to 
conduct 
my 
thoughts 
in 
such 
order 
that, 
by 
commencing 
with 
objects 
the 
simplest 
and 
easiest 
to 
know, 
I 
might 
ascend 
by 
little 
and 
little, 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
step 
by 
step, 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
more 
complex; 
assigning 
in 
thought 
a 
certain 
order 
even 
to 
those 
objects 
which 
in 
their 
own 



nature 
do 
not 
stand 
in 
a 
relation 
of 
antecedence 
and 
sequence. 


And 
the 
last, 
in 
every 
case 
to 
make 
enumerations 
so 
complete, 
and 
reviews 
so 
general, 
that 
I 
might 
be 
assured 
that 
nothing 
was 
omitted. 


The 
long 
chains 
of 
simple 
and 
easy 
reasonings 
by 
means 
of 
which 
geometers 
are 
accustomed 
to 
reach 
the 
conclusions 
of 
their 
most 
difficult 
demonstrations, 
had 
led 
me 
to 
imagine 
that 
all 
things, 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
which 
man 
is 
competent, 
are 
mutually 
connected 
in 
the 
same 
way, 
and 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
so 
far 
removed 
from 
us 
as 
to 
be 
beyond 
our 
reach, 
or 
so 
hidden 
that 
we 
cannot 
discover 
it, 
provided 
only 
we 
abstain 
from 
accepting 
the 
false 
for 
the 
true, 
and 
always 
preserve 
in 
our 
thoughts 
the 
order 
necessary 
for 
the 
deduction 
of 
one 
truth 
from 
another. 
And 
I 
had 
little 
difficulty 
in 
determining 
the 
objects 
with 
which 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
commence, 
for 
I 
was 
already 
persuaded 
that 
it 
must 
be 
with 
the 
simplest 
and 
easiest 
to 
know, 
and, 
considering 
that 
of 
all 
those 
who 
have 
hitherto 
sought 
truth 
in 
the 
sciences, 
the 
mathematicians 
alone 
have 
been 
able 
to 
find 
any 
demonstrations, 
that 
is, 
any 
certain 
and 
evident 
reasons, 
I 
did 
not 
doubt 
but 
that 
such 
must 
have 
been 
the 
rule 
of 
their 
investigations. 
I 
resolved 
to 
commence, 
therefore, 
with 
the 
examination 
of 
the 
simplest 
objects, 
not 
anticipating, 
however, 
from 
this 
any 
other 
advantage 
than 
that 
to 
be 
found 
in 
accustoming 
my 
mind 
to 
the 
love 
and 
nourishment 
of 
truth, 
and 
to 
a 
distaste 
for 
all 
such 
reasonings 
as 
were 
unsound. 
But 
I 
had 
no 
intention 
on 
that 
account 
of 
attempting 
to 
master 
all 
the 
particular 
sciences 
commonly 
denominated 
mathematics: 
but 
observing 
that, 
however 
different 
their 
objects, 
they 
all 
agree 
in 
considering 
only 
the 
various 
relations 
or 
proportions 
subsisting 
among 
those 
objects, 
I 
thought 
it 
best 
for 
my 
purpose 
to 
consider 
these 
proportions 
in 
the 
most 
general 
form 
possible, 
without 
referring 
them 
to 
any 
objects 
in 
particular, 
except 
such 
as 
would 
most 
facilitate 
the 
knowledge 
of 
them, 
and 
without 
by 
any 
means 
restricting 
them 
to 
these, 
that 
afterwards 
I 
might 
thus 
be 
the 
better 
able 
to 
apply 
them 
to 
every 
other 
class 
of 
objects 
to 
which 
they 
are 
legitimately 
applicable. 
Perceiving 
further, 
that 
in 
order 
to 
understand 
these 
relations 
I 
should 
sometimes 
have 
to 
consider 
them 
one 
by 
one 
and 
sometimes 
only 
to 
bear 
them 
in 
mind, 
or 
embrace 
them 
in 
the 
aggregate, 
I 
thought 
that, 
in 
order 
the 
better 
to 
consider 
them 
individually, 
I 
should 
view 
them 
as 
subsisting 
between 
straight 
lines, 
than 
which 
I 
could 
find 
no 
objects 
more 
simple, 
or 



capable 
of 
being 
more 
distinctly 
represented 
to 
my 
imagination 
and 
senses; 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
that 
in 
order 
to 
retain 
them 
in 
the 
memory 
or 
embrace 
an 
aggregate 
of 
many, 
I 
should 
express 
them 
by 
certain 
characters 
the 
briefest 
possible. 
In 
this 
way 
I 
believed 
that 
I 
could 
borrow 
all 
that 
was 
best 
both 
in 
geometrical 
analysis 
and 
in 
algebra, 
and 
correct 
all 
the 
defects 
of 
the 
one 
by 
help 
of 
the 
other. 


And, 
in 
point 
of 
fact, 
the 
accurate 
observance 
of 
these 
few 
precepts 
gave 
me, 
I 
take 
the 
liberty 
of 
saying, 
such 
ease 
in 
unraveling 
all 
the 
questions 
embraced 
in 
these 
two 
sciences, 
that 
in 
the 
two 
or 
three 
months 
I 
devoted 
to 
their 
examination, 
not 
only 
did 
I 
reach 
solutions 
of 
questions 
I 
had 
formerly 
deemed 
exceedingly 
difficult 
but 
even 
as 
regards 
questions 
of 
the 
solution 
of 
which 
I 
continued 
ignorant, 
I 
was 
enabled, 
as 
it 
appeared 
to 
me, 
to 
determine 
the 
means 
whereby, 
and 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
a 
solution 
was 
possible; 
results 
attributable 
to 
the 
circumstance 
that 
I 
commenced 
with 
the 
simplest 
and 
most 
general 
truths, 
and 
that 
thus 
each 
truth 
discovered 
was 
a 
rule 
available 
in 
the 
discovery 
of 
subsequent 
ones 
Nor 
in 
this 
perhaps 
shall 
I 
appear 
too 
vain, 
if 
it 
be 
considered 
that, 
as 
the 
truth 
on 
any 
particular 
point 
is 
one 
whoever 
apprehends 
the 
truth, 
knows 
all 
that 
on 
that 
point 
can 
be 
known. 
The 
child, 
for 
example, 
who 
has 
been 
instructed 
in 
the 
elements 
of 
arithmetic, 
and 
has 
made 
a 
particular 
addition, 
according 
to 
rule, 
may 
be 
assured 
that 
he 
has 
found, 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
numbers 
before 
him, 
and 
that 
in 
this 
instance 
is 
within 
the 
reach 
of 
human 
genius. 
Now, 
in 
conclusion, 
the 
method 
which 
teaches 
adherence 
to 
the 
true 
order, 
and 
an 
exact 
enumeration 
of 
all 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
thing 
sought 
includes 
all 
that 
gives 
certitude 
to 
the 
rules 
of 
arithmetic. 


But 
the 
chief 
ground 
of 
my 
satisfaction 
with 
thus 
method, 
was 
the 
assurance 
I 
had 
of 
thereby 
exercising 
my 
reason 
in 
all 
matters, 
if 
not 
with 
absolute 
perfection, 
at 
least 
with 
the 
greatest 
attainable 
by 
me: 
besides, 
I 
was 
conscious 
that 
by 
its 
use 
my 
mind 
was 
becoming 
gradually 
habituated 
to 
clearer 
and 
more 
distinct 
conceptions 
of 
its 
objects; 
and 
I 
hoped 
also, 
from 
not 
having 
restricted 
this 
method 
to 
any 
particular 
matter, 
to 
apply 
it 
to 
the 
difficulties 
of 
the 
other 
sciences, 
with 
not 
less 
success 
than 
to 
those 
of 
algebra. 
I 
should 
not, 
however, 
on 
this 
account 
have 
ventured 
at 
once 
on 
the 
examination 
of 
all 
the 
difficulties 
of 
the 
sciences 
which 
presented 
themselves 



to 
me, 
for 
this 
would 
have 
been 
contrary 
to 
the 
order 
prescribed 
in 
the 
method, 
but 
observing 
that 
the 
knowledge 
of 
such 
is 
dependent 
on 
principles 
borrowed 
from 
philosophy, 
in 
which 
I 
found 
nothing 
certain, 
I 
thought 
it 
necessary 
first 
of 
all 
to 
endeavor 
to 
establish 
its 
principles. 
And 
because 
I 
observed, 
besides, 
that 
an 
inquiry 
of 
this 
kind 
was 
of 
all 
others 
of 
the 
greatest 
moment, 
and 
one 
in 
which 
precipitancy 
and 
anticipation 
in 
judgment 
were 
most 
to 
be 
dreaded, 
I 
thought 
that 
I 
ought 
not 
to 
approach 
it 
till 
I 
had 
reached 
a 
more 
mature 
age 
(being 
at 
that 
time 
but 
twenty-three), 
and 
had 
first 
of 
all 
employed 
much 
of 
my 
time 
in 
preparation 
for 
the 
work, 
as 
well 
by 
eradicating 
from 
my 
mind 
all 
the 
erroneous 
opinions 
I 
had 
up 
to 
that 
moment 
accepted, 
as 
by 
amassing 
variety 
of 
experience 
to 
afford 
materials 
for 
my 
reasonings, 
and 
by 
continually 
exercising 
myself 
in 
my 
chosen 
method 
with 
a 
view 
to 
increased 
skill 
in 
its 
application. 


PART 
III 


And 
finally, 
as 
it 
is 
not 
enough, 
before 
commencing 
to 
rebuild 
the 
house 
in 
which 
we 
live, 
that 
it 
be 
pulled 
down, 
and 
materials 
and 
builders 
provided, 
or 
that 
we 
engage 
in 
the 
work 
ourselves, 
according 
to 
a 
plan 
which 
we 
have 
beforehand 
carefully 
drawn 
out, 
but 
as 
it 
is 
likewise 
necessary 
that 
we 
be 
furnished 
with 
some 
other 
house 
in 
which 
we 
may 
live 
commodiously 
during 
the 
operations, 
so 
that 
I 
might 
not 
remain 
irresolute 
in 
my 
actions, 
while 
my 
reason 
compelled 
me 
to 
suspend 
my 
judgement, 
and 
that 
I 
might 
not 
be 
prevented 
from 
living 
thenceforward 
in 
the 
greatest 
possible 
felicity, 
I 
formed 
a 
provisory 
code 
of 
morals, 
composed 
of 
three 
or 
four 
maxims, 
with 
which 
I 
am 
desirous 
to 
make 
you 
acquainted. 


The 
first 
was 
to 
obey 
the 
laws 
and 
customs 
of 
my 
country, 
adhering 
firmly 
to 
the 
faith 
in 
which, 
by 
the 
grace 
of 
God, 
I 
had 
been 
educated 
from 
my 
childhood 
and 
regulating 
my 
conduct 
in 
every 
other 
matter 
according 
to 
the 
most 
moderate 
opinions, 
and 
the 
farthest 
removed 
from 
extremes, 
which 
should 
happen 
to 
be 
adopted 
in 
practice 
with 
general 
consent 
of 
the 
most 
judicious 
of 
those 
among 
whom 
I 
might 
be 
living. 
For 
as 
I 
had 
from 
that 
time 



begun 
to 
hold 
my 
own 
opinions 
for 
nought 
because 
I 
wished 
to 
subject 
them 
all 
to 
examination, 
I 
was 
convinced 
that 
I 
could 
not 
do 
better 
than 
follow 
in 
the 
meantime 
the 
opinions 
of 
the 
most 
judicious; 
and 
although 
there 
are 
some 
perhaps 
among 
the 
Persians 
and 
Chinese 
as 
judicious 
as 
among 
ourselves, 
expediency 
seemed 
to 
dictate 
that 
I 
should 
regulate 
my 
practice 
conformably 
to 
the 
opinions 
of 
those 
with 
whom 
I 
should 
have 
to 
live; 
and 
it 
appeared 
to 
me 
that, 
in 
order 
to 
ascertain 
the 
real 
opinions 
of 
such, 
I 
ought 
rather 
to 
take 
cognizance 
of 
what 
they 
practised 
than 
of 
what 
they 
said, 
not 
only 
because, 
in 
the 
corruption 
of 
our 
manners, 
there 
are 
few 
disposed 
to 
speak 
exactly 
as 
they 
believe, 
but 
also 
because 
very 
many 
are 
not 
aware 
of 
what 
it 
is 
that 
they 
really 
believe; 
for, 
as 
the 
act 
of 
mind 
by 
which 
a 
thing 
is 
believed 
is 
different 
from 
that 
by 
which 
we 
know 
that 
we 
believe 
it, 
the 
one 
act 
is 
often 
found 
without 
the 
other. 
Also, 
amid 
many 
opinions 
held 
in 
equal 
repute, 
I 
chose 
always 
the 
most 
moderate, 
as 
much 
for 
the 
reason 
that 
these 
are 
always 
the 
most 
convenient 
for 
practice, 
and 
probably 
the 
best 
(for 
all 
excess 
is 
generally 
vicious), 
as 
that, 
in 
the 
event 
of 
my 
falling 
into 
error, 
I 
might 
be 
at 
less 
distance 
from 
the 
truth 
than 
if, 
having 
chosen 
one 
of 
the 
extremes, 
it 
should 
turn 
out 
to 
be 
the 
other 
which 
I 
ought 
to 
have 
adopted. 
And 
I 
placed 
in 
the 
class 
of 
extremes 
especially 
all 
promises 
by 
which 
somewhat 
of 
our 
freedom 
is 
abridged; 
not 
that 
I 
disapproved 
of 
the 
laws 
which, 
to 
provide 
against 
the 
instability 
of 
men 
of 
feeble 
resolution, 
when 
what 
is 
sought 
to 
be 
accomplished 
is 
some 
good, 
permit 
engagements 
by 
vows 
and 
contracts 
binding 
the 
parties 
to 
persevere 
in 
it, 
or 
even, 
for 
the 
security 
of 
commerce, 
sanction 
similar 
engagements 
where 
the 
purpose 
sought 
to 
be 
realized 
is 
indifferent: 
but 
because 
I 
did 
not 
find 
anything 
on 
earth 
which 
was 
wholly 
superior 
to 
change, 
and 
because, 
for 
myself 
in 
particular, 
I 
hoped 
gradually 
to 
perfect 
my 
judgments, 
and 
not 
to 
suffer 
them 
to 
deteriorate, 
I 
would 
have 
deemed 
it 
a 
grave 
sin 
against 
good 
sense, 
if, 
for 
the 
reason 
that 
I 
approved 
of 
something 
at 
a 
particular 
time, 
I 
therefore 
bound 
myself 
to 
hold 
it 
for 
good 
at 
a 
subsequent 
time, 
when 
perhaps 
it 
had 
ceased 
to 
be 
so, 
or 
I 
had 
ceased 
to 
esteem 
it 
such. 


My 
second 
maxim 
was 
to 
be 
as 
firm 
and 
resolute 
in 
my 
actions 
as 
I 
was 
able, 
and 
not 
to 
adhere 
less 
steadfastly 
to 
the 
most 
doubtful 
opinions, 
when 
once 
adopted, 
than 
if 
they 
had 
been 
highly 
certain; 
imitating 
in 
this 
the 
example 
of 
travelers 
who, 
when 
they 
have 
lost 
their 
way 
in 
a 
forest, 
ought 
not 



to 
wander 
from 
side 
to 
side, 
far 
less 
remain 
in 
one 
place, 
but 
proceed 
constantly 
towards 
the 
same 
side 
in 
as 
straight 
a 
line 
as 
possible, 
without 
changing 
their 
direction 
for 
slight 
reasons, 
although 
perhaps 
it 
might 
be 
chance 
alone 
which 
at 
first 
determined 
the 
selection; 
for 
in 
this 
way, 
if 
they 
do 
not 
exactly 
reach 
the 
point 
they 
desire, 
they 
will 
come 
at 
least 
in 
the 
end 
to 
some 
place 
that 
will 
probably 
be 
preferable 
to 
the 
middle 
of 
a 
forest. 
In 
the 
same 
way, 
since 
in 
action 
it 
frequently 
happens 
that 
no 
delay 
is 
permissible, 
it 
is 
very 
certain 
that, 
when 
it 
is 
not 
in 
our 
power 
to 
determine 
what 
is 
true, 
we 
ought 
to 
act 
according 
to 
what 
is 
most 
probable; 
and 
even 
although 
we 
should 
not 
remark 
a 
greater 
probability 
in 
one 
opinion 
than 
in 
another, 
we 
ought 
notwithstanding 
to 
choose 
one 
or 
the 
other, 
and 
afterwards 
consider 
it, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
relates 
to 
practice, 
as 
no 
longer 
dubious, 
but 
manifestly 
true 
and 
certain, 
since 
the 
reason 
by 
which 
our 
choice 
has 
been 
determined 
is 
itself 
possessed 
of 
these 
qualities. 
This 
principle 
was 
sufficient 
thenceforward 
to 
rid 
me 
of 
all 
those 
repentings 
and 
pangs 
of 
remorse 
that 
usually 
disturb 
the 
consciences 
of 
such 
feeble 
and 
uncertain 
minds 
as, 
destitute 
of 
any 
clear 
and 
determinate 
principle 
of 
choice, 
allow 
themselves 
one 
day 
to 
adopt 
a 
course 
of 
action 
as 
the 
best, 
which 
they 
abandon 
the 
next, 
as 
the 
opposite. 


My 
third 
maxim 
was 
to 
endeavor 
always 
to 
conquer 
myself 
rather 
than 
fortune, 
and 
change 
my 
desires 
rather 
than 
the 
order 
of 
the 
world, 
and 
in 
general, 
accustom 
myself 
to 
the 
persuasion 
that, 
except 
our 
own 
thoughts, 
there 
is 
nothing 
absolutely 
in 
our 
power; 
so 
that 
when 
we 
have 
done 
our 
best 
in 
things 
external 
to 
us, 
all 
wherein 
we 
fail 
of 
success 
is 
to 
be 
held, 
as 
regards 
us, 
absolutely 
impossible: 
and 
this 
single 
principle 
seemed 
to 
me 
sufficient 
to 
prevent 
me 
from 
desiring 
for 
the 
future 
anything 
which 
I 
could 
not 
obtain, 
and 
thus 
render 
me 
contented; 
for 
since 
our 
will 
naturally 
seeks 
those 
objects 
alone 
which 
the 
understanding 
represents 
as 
in 
some 
way 
possible 
of 
attainment, 
it 
is 
plain, 
that 
if 
we 
consider 
all 
external 
goods 
as 
equally 
beyond 
our 
power, 
we 
shall 
no 
more 
regret 
the 
absence 
of 
such 
goods 
as 
seem 
due 
to 
our 
birth, 
when 
deprived 
of 
them 
without 
any 
fault 
of 
ours, 
than 
our 
not 
possessing 
the 
kingdoms 
of 
China 
or 
Mexico, 
and 
thus 
making, 
so 
to 
speak, 
a 
virtue 
of 
necessity, 
we 
shall 
no 
more 
desire 
health 
in 
disease, 
or 
freedom 
in 
imprisonment, 
than 
we 
now 
do 
bodies 
incorruptible 
as 
diamonds, 
or 
the 
wings 
of 
birds 
to 
fly 
with. 
But 
I 
confess 
there 
is 
need 
of 
prolonged 
discipline 
and 
frequently 
repeated 
meditation 
to 
accustom 
the 
mind 
to 
view 
all 
objects 



in 
this 
light; 
and 
I 
believe 
that 
in 
this 
chiefly 
consisted 
the 
secret 
of 
the 
power 
of 
such 
philosophers 
as 
in 
former 
times 
were 
enabled 
to 
rise 
superior 
to 
the 
influence 
of 
fortune, 
and, 
amid 
suffering 
and 
poverty, 
enjoy 
a 
happiness 
which 
their 
gods 
might 
have 
envied. 
For, 
occupied 
incessantly 
with 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
limits 
prescribed 
to 
their 
power 
by 
nature, 
they 
became 
so 
entirely 
convinced 
that 
nothing 
was 
at 
their 
disposal 
except 
their 
own 
thoughts, 
that 
this 
conviction 
was 
of 
itself 
sufficient 
to 
prevent 
their 
entertaining 
any 
desire 
of 
other 
objects; 
and 
over 
their 
thoughts 
they 
acquired 
a 
sway 
so 
absolute, 
that 
they 
had 
some 
ground 
on 
this 
account 
for 
esteeming 
themselves 
more 
rich 
and 
more 
powerful, 
more 
free 
and 
more 
happy, 
than 
other 
men 
who, 
whatever 
be 
the 
favors 
heaped 
on 
them 
by 
nature 
and 
fortune, 
if 
destitute 
of 
this 
philosophy, 
can 
never 
command 
the 
realization 
of 
all 
their 
desires. 


In 
fine, 
to 
conclude 
this 
code 
of 
morals, 
I 
thought 
of 
reviewing 
the 
different 
occupations 
of 
men 
in 
this 
life, 
with 
the 
view 
of 
making 
choice 
of 
the 
best. 
And, 
without 
wishing 
to 
offer 
any 
remarks 
on 
the 
employments 
of 
others, 
I 
may 
state 
that 
it 
was 
my 
conviction 
that 
I 
could 
not 
do 
better 
than 
continue 
in 
that 
in 
which 
I 
was 
engaged, 
viz., 
in 
devoting 
my 
whole 
life 
to 
the 
culture 
of 
my 
reason, 
and 
in 
making 
the 
greatest 
progress 
I 
was 
able 
in 
the 
knowledge 
of 
truth, 
on 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
method 
which 
I 
had 
prescribed 
to 
myself. 
This 
method, 
from 
the 
time 
I 
had 
begun 
to 
apply 
it, 
had 
been 
to 
me 
the 
source 
of 
satisfaction 
so 
intense 
as 
to 
lead 
me 
to, 
believe 
that 
more 
perfect 
or 
more 
innocent 
could 
not 
be 
enjoyed 
in 
this 
life; 
and 
as 
by 
its 
means 
I 
daily 
discovered 
truths 
that 
appeared 
to 
me 
of 
some 
importance, 
and 
of 
which 
other 
men 
were 
generally 
ignorant, 
the 
gratification 
thence 
arising 
so 
occupied 
my 
mind 
that 
I 
was 
wholly 
indifferent 
to 
every 
other 
object. 
Besides, 
the 
three 
preceding 
maxims 
were 
founded 
singly 
on 
the 
design 
of 
continuing 
the 
work 
of 
self-instruction. 
For 
since 
God 
has 
endowed 
each 
of 
us 
with 
some 
light 
of 
reason 
by 
which 
to 
distinguish 
truth 
from 
error, 
I 
could 
not 
have 
believed 
that 
I 
ought 
for 
a 
single 
moment 
to 
rest 
satisfied 
with 
the 
opinions 
of 
another, 
unless 
I 
had 
resolved 
to 
exercise 
my 
own 
judgment 
in 
examining 
these 
whenever 
I 
should 
be 
duly 
qualified 
for 
the 
task. 
Nor 
could 
I 
have 
proceeded 
on 
such 
opinions 
without 
scruple, 
had 
I 
supposed 
that 
I 
should 
thereby 
forfeit 
any 
advantage 
for 
attaining 
still 
more 
accurate, 
should 
such 
exist. 
And, 
in 
fine, 
I 
could 
not 
have 
restrained 
my 
desires, 
nor 
remained 



satisfied 
had 
I 
not 
followed 
a 
path 
in 
which 
I 
thought 
myself 
certain 
of 
attaining 
all 
the 
knowledge 
to 
the 
acquisition 
of 
which 
I 
was 
competent, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
largest 
amount 
of 
what 
is 
truly 
good 
which 
I 
could 
ever 
hope 
to 
secure 
Inasmuch 
as 
we 
neither 
seek 
nor 
shun 
any 
object 
except 
in 
so 
far 
as 
our 
understanding 
represents 
it 
as 
good 
or 
bad, 
all 
that 
is 
necessary 
to 
right 
action 
is 
right 
judgment, 
and 
to 
the 
best 
action 
the 
most 
correct 
judgment, 
that 
is, 
to 
the 
acquisition 
of 
all 
the 
virtues 
with 
all 
else 
that 
is 
truly 
valuable 
and 
within 
our 
reach; 
and 
the 
assurance 
of 
such 
an 
acquisition 
cannot 
fail 
to 
render 
us 
contented. 


Having 
thus 
provided 
myself 
with 
these 
maxims, 
and 
having 
placed 
them 
in 
reserve 
along 
with 
the 
truths 
of 
faith, 
which 
have 
ever 
occupied 
the 
first 
place 
in 
my 
belief, 
I 
came 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
I 
might 
with 
freedom 
set 
about 
ridding 
myself 
of 
what 
remained 
of 
my 
opinions. 
And, 
inasmuch 
as 
I 
hoped 
to 
be 
better 
able 
successfully 
to 
accomplish 
this 
work 
by 
holding 
intercourse 
with 
mankind, 
than 
by 
remaining 
longer 
shut 
up 
in 
the 
retirement 
where 
these 
thoughts 
had 
occurred 
to 
me, 
I 
betook 
me 
again 
to 
traveling 
before 
the 
winter 
was 
well 
ended. 
And, 
during 
the 
nine 
subsequent 
years, 
I 
did 
nothing 
but 
roam 
from 
one 
place 
to 
another, 
desirous 
of 
being 
a 
spectator 
rather 
than 
an 
actor 
in 
the 
plays 
exhibited 
on 
the 
theater 
of 
the 
world; 
and, 
as 
I 
made 
it 
my 
business 
in 
each 
matter 
to 
reflect 
particularly 
upon 
what 
might 
fairly 
be 
doubted 
and 
prove 
a 
source 
of 
error, 
I 
gradually 
rooted 
out 
from 
my 
mind 
all 
the 
errors 
which 
had 
hitherto 
crept 
into 
it. 
Not 
that 
in 
this 
I 
imitated 
the 
sceptics 
who 
doubt 
only 
that 
they 
may 
doubt, 
and 
seek 
nothing 
beyond 
uncertainty 
itself; 
for, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
my 
design 
was 
singly 
to 
find 
ground 
of 
assurance, 
and 
cast 
aside 
the 
loose 
earth 
and 
sand, 
that 
I 
might 
reach 
the 
rock 
or 
the 
clay. 
In 
this, 
as 
appears 
to 
me, 
I 
was 
successful 
enough; 
for, 
since 
I 
endeavored 
to 
discover 
the 
falsehood 
or 
incertitude 
of 
the 
propositions 
I 
examined, 
not 
by 
feeble 
conjectures, 
but 
by 
clear 
and 
certain 
reasonings, 
I 
met 
with 
nothing 
so 
doubtful 
as 
not 
to 
yield 
some 
conclusion 
of 
adequate 
certainty, 
although 
this 
were 
merely 
the 
inference, 
that 
the 
matter 
in 
question 
contained 
nothing 
certain. 
And, 
just 
as 
in 
pulling 
down 
an 
old 
house, 
we 
usually 
reserve 
the 
ruins 
to 
contribute 
towards 
the 
erection, 
so, 
in 
destroying 
such 
of 
my 
opinions 
as 
I 
judged 
to 
be 
Ill-founded, 
I 
made 
a 
variety 
of 
observations 
and 
acquired 
an 
amount 
of 
experience 
of 
which 
I 
availed 
myself 
in 
the 
establishment 
of 
more 
certain. 
And 
further, 
I 
continued 
to 
exercise 



myself 
in 
the 
method 
I 
had 
prescribed; 
for, 
besides 
taking 
care 
in 
general 
to 
conduct 
all 
my 
thoughts 
according 
to 
its 
rules, 
I 
reserved 
some 
hours 
from 
time 
to 
time 
which 
I 
expressly 
devoted 
to 
the 
employment 
of 
the 
method 
in 
the 
solution 
of 
mathematical 
difficulties, 
or 
even 
in 
the 
solution 
likewise 
of 
some 
questions 
belonging 
to 
other 
sciences, 
but 
which, 
by 
my 
having 
detached 
them 
from 
such 
principles 
of 
these 
sciences 
as 
were 
of 
inadequate 
certainty, 
were 
rendered 
almost 
mathematical: 
the 
truth 
of 
this 
will 
be 
manifest 
from 
the 
numerous 
examples 
contained 
in 
this 
volume. 
And 
thus, 
without 
in 
appearance 
living 
otherwise 
than 
those 
who, 
with 
no 
other 
occupation 
than 
that 
of 
spending 
their 
lives 
agreeably 
and 
innocently, 
study 
to 
sever 
pleasure 
from 
vice, 
and 
who, 
that 
they 
may 
enjoy 
their 
leisure 
without 
ennui, 
have 
recourse 
to 
such 
pursuits 
as 
are 
honorable, 
I 
was 
nevertheless 
prosecuting 
my 
design, 
and 
making 
greater 
progress 
in 
the 
knowledge 
of 
truth, 
than 
I 
might, 
perhaps, 
have 
made 
had 
I 
been 
engaged 
in 
the 
perusal 
of 
books 
merely, 
or 
in 
holding 
converse 
with 
men 
of 
letters. 


These 
nine 
years 
passed 
away, 
however, 
before 
I 
had 
come 
to 
any 
determinate 
judgment 
respecting 
the 
difficulties 
which 
form 
matter 
of 
dispute 
among 
the 
learned, 
or 
had 
commenced 
to 
seek 
the 
principles 
of 
any 
philosophy 
more 
certain 
than 
the 
vulgar. 
And 
the 
examples 
of 
many 
men 
of 
the 
highest 
genius, 
who 
had, 
in 
former 
times, 
engaged 
in 
this 
inquiry, 
but, 
as 
appeared 
to 
me, 
without 
success, 
led 
me 
to 
imagine 
it 
to 
be 
a 
work 
of 
so 
much 
difficulty, 
that 
I 
would 
not 
perhaps 
have 
ventured 
on 
it 
so 
soon 
had 
I 
not 
heard 
it 
currently 
rumored 
that 
I 
had 
already 
completed 
the 
inquiry. 
I 
know 
not 
what 
were 
the 
grounds 
of 
this 
opinion; 
and, 
if 
my 
conversation 
contributed 
in 
any 
measure 
to 
its 
rise, 
this 
must 
have 
happened 
rather 
from 
my 
having 
confessed 
my 
Ignorance 
with 
greater 
freedom 
than 
those 
are 
accustomed 
to 
do 
who 
have 
studied 
a 
little, 
and 
expounded 
perhaps, 
the 
reasons 
that 
led 
me 
to 
doubt 
of 
many 
of 
those 
things 
that 
by 
others 
are 
esteemed 
certain, 
than 
from 
my 
having 
boasted 
of 
any 
system 
of 
philosophy. 
But, 
as 
I 
am 
of 
a 
disposition 
that 
makes 
me 
unwilling 
to 
be 
esteemed 
different 
from 
what 
I 
really 
am, 
I 
thought 
it 
necessary 
to 
endeavor 
by 
all 
means 
to 
render 
myself 
worthy 
of 
the 
reputation 
accorded 
to 
me; 
and 
it 
is 
now 
exactly 
eight 
years 
since 
this 
desire 
constrained 
me 
to 
remove 
from 
all 
those 
places 
where 
interruption 
from 
any 
of 
my 
acquaintances 
was 
possible, 
and 
betake 
myself 
to 
this 
country, 
in 
which 
the 
long 
duration 
of 
the 
war 
has 



led 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
such 
discipline, 
that 
the 
armies 
maintained 
seem 
to 
be 
of 
use 
only 
in 
enabling 
the 
inhabitants 
to 
enjoy 
more 
securely 
the 
blessings 
of 
peace 
and 
where, 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
a 
great 
crowd 
actively 
engaged 
in 
business, 
and 
more 
careful 
of 
their 
own 
affairs 
than 
curious 
about 
those 
of 
others, 
I 
have 
been 
enabled 
to 
live 
without 
being 
deprived 
of 
any 
of 
the 
conveniences 
to 
be 
had 
in 
the 
most 
populous 
cities, 
and 
yet 
as 
solitary 
and 
as 
retired 
as 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
most 
remote 
deserts. 


PART 
IV 


I 
am 
in 
doubt 
as 
to 
the 
propriety 
of 
making 
my 
first 
meditations 
in 
the 
place 
above 
mentioned 
matter 
of 
discourse; 
for 
these 
are 
so 
metaphysical, 
and 
so 
uncommon, 
as 
not, 
perhaps, 
to 
be 
acceptable 
to 
every 
one. 
And 
yet, 
that 
it 
may 
be 
determined 
whether 
the 
foundations 
that 
I 
have 
laid 
are 
sufficiently 
secure, 
I 
find 
myself 
in 
a 
measure 
constrained 
to 
advert 
to 
them. 
I 
had 
long 
before 
remarked 
that, 
in 
relation 
to 
practice, 
it 
is 
sometimes 
necessary 
to 
adopt, 
as 
if 
above 
doubt, 
opinions 
which 
we 
discern 
to 
be 
highly 
uncertain, 
as 
has 
been 
already 
said; 
but 
as 
I 
then 
desired 
to 
give 
my 
attention 
solely 
to 
the 
search 
after 
truth, 
I 
thought 
that 
a 
procedure 
exactly 
the 
opposite 
was 
called 
for, 
and 
that 
I 
ought 
to 
reject 
as 
absolutely 
false 
all 
opinions 
in 
regard 
to 
which 
I 
could 
suppose 
the 
least 
ground 
for 
doubt, 
in 
order 
to 
ascertain 
whether 
after 
that 
there 
remained 
aught 
in 
my 
belief 
that 
was 
wholly 
indubitable. 
Accordingly, 
seeing 
that 
our 
senses 
sometimes 
deceive 
us, 
I 
was 
willing 
to 
suppose 
that 
there 
existed 
nothing 
really 
such 
as 
they 
presented 
to 
us; 
and 
because 
some 
men 
err 
in 
reasoning, 
and 
fall 
into 
paralogisms, 
even 
on 
the 
simplest 
matters 
of 
geometry, 
I, 
convinced 
that 
I 
was 
as 
open 
to 
error 
as 
any 
other, 
rejected 
as 
false 
all 
the 
reasonings 
I 
had 
hitherto 
taken 
for 
demonstrations; 
and 
finally, 
when 
I 
considered 
that 
the 
very 
same 
thoughts 
(presentations) 
which 
we 
experience 
when 
awake 
may 
also 
be 
experienced 
when 
we 
are 
asleep, 
while 
there 
is 
at 
that 
time 
not 
one 
of 
them 
true, 
I 
supposed 
that 
all 
the 
objects 
(presentations) 
that 
had 
ever 
entered 
into 
my 
mind 
when 
awake, 
had 
in 
them 
no 
more 
truth 
than 
the 
illusions 
of 
my 
dreams. 
But 
immediately 
upon 
this 
I 
observed 
that, 
whilst 
I 
thus 
wished 
to 



think 
that 
all 
was 
false, 
it 
was 
absolutely 
necessary 
that 
I, 
who 
thus 
thought, 
should 
be 
somewhat; 
and 
as 
I 
observed 
that 
this 
truth, 
I 
think, 
therefore 
I 
am 
(COGITO 
ERGO 
SUM), 
was 
so 
certain 
and 
of 
such 
evidence 
that 
no 
ground 
of 
doubt, 
however 
extravagant, 
could 
be 
alleged 
by 
the 
sceptics 
capable 
of 
shaking 
it, 
I 
concluded 
that 
I 
might, 
without 
scruple, 
accept 
it 
as 
the 
first 
principle 
of 
the 
philosophy 
of 
which 
I 
was 
in 
search. 


In 
the 
next 
place, 
I 
attentively 
examined 
what 
I 
was 
and 
as 
I 
observed 
that 
I 
could 
suppose 
that 
I 
had 
no 
body, 
and 
that 
there 
was 
no 
world 
nor 
any 
place 
in 
which 
I 
might 
be; 
but 
that 
I 
could 
not 
therefore 
suppose 
that 
I 
was 
not; 
and 
that, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
from 
the 
very 
circumstance 
that 
I 
thought 
to 
doubt 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
other 
things, 
it 
most 
clearly 
and 
certainly 
followed 
that 
I 
was; 
while, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
if 
I 
had 
only 
ceased 
to 
think, 
although 
all 
the 
other 
objects 
which 
I 
had 
ever 
imagined 
had 
been 
in 
reality 
existent, 
I 
would 
have 
had 
no 
reason 
to 
believe 
that 
I 
existed; 
I 
thence 
concluded 
that 
I 
was 
a 
substance 
whose 
whole 
essence 
or 
nature 
consists 
only 
in 
thinking, 
and 
which, 
that 
it 
may 
exist, 
has 
need 
of 
no 
place, 
nor 
is 
dependent 
on 
any 
material 
thing; 
so 
that 
"I," 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
mind 
by 
which 
I 
am 
what 
I 
am, 
is 
wholly 
distinct 
from 
the 
body, 
and 
is 
even 
more 
easily 
known 
than 
the 
latter, 
and 
is 
such, 
that 
although 
the 
latter 
were 
not, 
it 
would 
still 
continue 
to 
be 
all 
that 
it 
is. 


After 
this 
I 
inquired 
in 
general 
into 
what 
is 
essential 
to 
the 
truth 
and 
certainty 
of 
a 
proposition; 
for 
since 
I 
had 
discovered 
one 
which 
I 
knew 
to 
be 
true, 
I 
thought 
that 
I 
must 
likewise 
be 
able 
to 
discover 
the 
ground 
of 
this 
certitude. 
And 
as 
I 
observed 
that 
in 
the 
words 
I 
think, 
therefore 
I 
am, 
there 
is 
nothing 
at 
all 
which 
gives 
me 
assurance 
of 
their 
truth 
beyond 
this, 
that 
I 
see 
very 
clearly 
that 
in 
order 
to 
think 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
exist, 
I 
concluded 
that 
I 
might 
take, 
as 
a 
general 
rule, 
the 
principle, 
that 
all 
the 
things 
which 
we 
very 
clearly 
and 
distinctly 
conceive 
are 
true, 
only 
observing, 
however, 
that 
there 
is 
some 
difficulty 
in 
rightly 
determining 
the 
objects 
which 
we 
distinctly 
conceive. 


In 
the 
next 
place, 
from 
reflecting 
on 
the 
circumstance 
that 
I 
doubted, 
and 
that 
consequently 
my 
being 
was 
not 
wholly 
perfect 
(for 
I 
clearly 
saw 
that 
it 
was 
a 
greater 
perfection 
to 
know 
than 
to 
doubt), 
I 
was 
led 
to 
inquire 
whence 
I 
had 
learned 
to 
think 
of 
something 
more 
perfect 
than 
myself; 
and 
I 
clearly 



recognized 
that 
I 
must 
hold 
this 
notion 
from 
some 
nature 
which 
in 
reality 
was 
more 
perfect. 
As 
for 
the 
thoughts 
of 
many 
other 
objects 
external 
to 
me, 
as 
of 
the 
sky, 
the 
earth, 
light, 
heat, 
and 
a 
thousand 
more, 
I 
was 
less 
at 
a 
loss 
to 
know 
whence 
these 
came; 
for 
since 
I 
remarked 
in 
them 
nothing 
which 
seemed 
to 
render 
them 
superior 
to 
myself, 
I 
could 
believe 
that, 
if 
these 
were 
true, 
they 
were 
dependencies 
on 
my 
own 
nature, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
possessed 
a 
certain 
perfection, 
and, 
if 
they 
were 
false, 
that 
I 
held 
them 
from 
nothing, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
that 
they 
were 
in 
me 
because 
of 
a 
certain 
imperfection 
of 
my 
nature. 
But 
this 
could 
not 
be 
the 
case 
with-the 
idea 
of 
a 
nature 
more 
perfect 
than 
myself; 
for 
to 
receive 
it 
from 
nothing 
was 
a 
thing 
manifestly 
impossible; 
and, 
because 
it 
is 
not 
less 
repugnant 
that 
the 
more 
perfect 
should 
be 
an 
effect 
of, 
and 
dependence 
on 
the 
less 
perfect, 
than 
that 
something 
should 
proceed 
from 
nothing, 
it 
was 
equally 
impossible 
that 
I 
could 
hold 
it 
from 
myself: 
accordingly, 
it 
but 
remained 
that 
it 
had 
been 
placed 
in 
me 
by 
a 
nature 
which 
was 
in 
reality 
more 
perfect 
than 
mine, 
and 
which 
even 
possessed 
within 
itself 
all 
the 
perfections 
of 
which 
I 
could 
form 
any 
idea; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
in 
a 
single 
word, 
which 
was 
God. 
And 
to 
this 
I 
added 
that, 
since 
I 
knew 
some 
perfections 
which 
I 
did 
not 
possess, 
I 
was 
not 
the 
only 
being 
in 
existence 
(I 
will 
here, 
with 
your 
permission, 
freely 
use 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
schools); 
but, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
that 
there 
was 
of 
necessity 
some 
other 
more 
perfect 
Being 
upon 
whom 
I 
was 
dependent, 
and 
from 
whom 
I 
had 
received 
all 
that 
I 
possessed; 
for 
if 
I 
had 
existed 
alone, 
and 
independently 
of 
every 
other 
being, 
so 
as 
to 
have 
had 
from 
myself 
all 
the 
perfection, 
however 
little, 
which 
I 
actually 
possessed, 
I 
should 
have 
been 
able, 
for 
the 
same 
reason, 
to 
have 
had 
from 
myself 
the 
whole 
remainder 
of 
perfection, 
of 
the 
want 
of 
which 
I 
was 
conscious, 
and 
thus 
could 
of 
myself 
have 
become 
infinite, 
eternal, 
immutable, 
omniscient, 
all-powerful, 
and, 
in 
fine, 
have 
possessed 
all 
the 
perfections 
which 
I 
could 
recognize 
in 
God. 
For 
in 
order 
to 
know 
the 
nature 
of 
God 
(whose 
existence 
has 
been 
established 
by 
the 
preceding 
reasonings), 
as 
far 
as 
my 
own 
nature 
permitted, 
I 
had 
only 
to 
consider 
in 
reference 
to 
all 
the 
properties 
of 
which 
I 
found 
in 
my 
mind 
some 
idea, 
whether 
their 
possession 
was 
a 
mark 
of 
perfection; 
and 
I 
was 
assured 
that 
no 
one 
which 
indicated 
any 
imperfection 
was 
in 
him, 
and 
that 
none 
of 
the 
rest 
was 
awanting. 
Thus 
I 
perceived 
that 
doubt, 
inconstancy, 
sadness, 
and 
such 
like, 
could 
not 
be 
found 
in 
God, 
since 
I 
myself 
would 
have 
been 
happy 
to 
be 
free 
from 
them. 
Besides, 
I 
had 
ideas 
of 
many 
sensible 
and 
corporeal 
things; 
for 



although 
I 
might 
suppose 
that 
I 
was 
dreaming, 
and 
that 
all 
which 
I 
saw 
or 
imagined 
was 
false, 
I 
could 
not, 
nevertheless, 
deny 
that 
the 
ideas 
were 
in 
reality 
in 
my 
thoughts. 
But, 
because 
I 
had 
already 
very 
clearly 
recognized 
in 
myself 
that 
the 
intelligent 
nature 
is 
distinct 
from 
the 
corporeal, 
and 
as 
I 
observed 
that 
all 
composition 
is 
an 
evidence 
of 
dependency, 
and 
that 
a 
state 
of 
dependency 
is 
manifestly 
a 
state 
of 
imperfection, 
I 
therefore 
determined 
that 
it 
could 
not 
be 
a 
perfection 
in 
God 
to 
be 
compounded 
of 
these 
two 
natures 
and 
that 
consequently 
he 
was 
not 
so 
compounded; 
but 
that 
if 
there 
were 
any 
bodies 
in 
the 
world, 
or 
even 
any 
intelligences, 
or 
other 
natures 
that 
were 
not 
wholly 
perfect, 
their 
existence 
depended 
on 
his 
power 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
they 
could 
not 
subsist 
without 
him 
for 
a 
single 
moment. 


I 
was 
disposed 
straightway 
to 
search 
for 
other 
truths 
and 
when 
I 
had 
represented 
to 
myself 
the 
object 
of 
the 
geometers, 
which 
I 
conceived 
to 
be 
a 
continuous 
body 
or 
a 
space 
indefinitely 
extended 
in 
length, 
breadth, 
and 
height 
or 
depth, 
divisible 
into 
divers 
parts 
which 
admit 
of 
different 
figures 
and 
sizes, 
and 
of 
being 
moved 
or 
transposed 
in 
all 
manner 
of 
ways 
(for 
all 
this 
the 
geometers 
suppose 
to 
be 
in 
the 
object 
they 
contemplate), 
I 
went 
over 
some 
of 
their 
simplest 
demonstrations. 
And, 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
I 
observed, 
that 
the 
great 
certitude 
which 
by 
common 
consent 
is 
accorded 
to 
these 
demonstrations, 
is 
founded 
solely 
upon 
this, 
that 
they 
are 
clearly 
conceived 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
rules 
I 
have 
already 
laid 
down 
In 
the 
next 
place, 
I 
perceived 
that 
there 
was 
nothing 
at 
all 
in 
these 
demonstrations 
which 
could 
assure 
me 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
their 
object: 
thus, 
for 
example, 
supposing 
a 
triangle 
to 
be 
given, 
I 
distinctly 
perceived 
that 
its 
three 
angles 
were 
necessarily 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles, 
but 
I 
did 
not 
on 
that 
account 
perceive 
anything 
which 
could 
assure 
me 
that 
any 
triangle 
existed: 
while, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
recurring 
to 
the 
examination 
of 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
Perfect 
Being, 
I 
found 
that 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
Being 
was 
comprised 
in 
the 
idea 
in 
the 
same 
way 
that 
the 
equality 
of 
its 
three 
angles 
to 
two 
right 
angles 
is 
comprised 
in 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
triangle, 
or 
as 
in 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
sphere, 
the 
equidistance 
of 
all 
points 
on 
its 
surface 
from 
the 
center, 
or 
even 
still 
more 
clearly; 
and 
that 
consequently 
it 
is 
at 
least 
as 
certain 
that 
God, 
who 
is 
this 
Perfect 
Being, 
is, 
or 
exists, 
as 
any 
demonstration 
of 
geometry 
can 
be. 


But 
the 
reason 
which 
leads 
many 
to 
persuade 
them 
selves 
that 
there 
is 
a 



difficulty 
in 
knowing 
this 
truth, 
and 
even 
also 
in 
knowing 
what 
their 
mind 
really 
is, 
is 
that 
they 
never 
raise 
their 
thoughts 
above 
sensible 
objects, 
and 
are 
so 
accustomed 
to 
consider 
nothing 
except 
by 
way 
of 
imagination, 
which 
is 
a 
mode 
of 
thinking 
limited 
to 
material 
objects, 
that 
all 
that 
is 
not 
imaginable 
seems 
to 
them 
not 
intelligible. 
The 
truth 
of 
this 
is 
sufficiently 
manifest 
from 
the 
single 
circumstance, 
that 
the 
philosophers 
of 
the 
schools 
accept 
as 
a 
maxim 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
the 
understanding 
which 
was 
not 
previously 
in 
the 
senses, 
in 
which 
however 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
the 
ideas 
of 
God 
and 
of 
the 
soul 
have 
never 
been; 
and 
it 
appears 
to 
me 
that 
they 
who 
make 
use 
of 
their 
imagination 
to 
comprehend 
these 
ideas 
do 
exactly 
the 
some 
thing 
as 
if, 
in 
order 
to 
hear 
sounds 
or 
smell 
odors, 
they 
strove 
to 
avail 
themselves 
of 
their 
eyes; 
unless 
indeed 
that 
there 
is 
this 
difference, 
that 
the 
sense 
of 
sight 
does 
not 
afford 
us 
an 
inferior 
assurance 
to 
those 
of 
smell 
or 
hearing; 
in 
place 
of 
which, 
neither 
our 
imagination 
nor 
our 
senses 
can 
give 
us 
assurance 
of 
anything 
unless 
our 
understanding 
intervene. 


Finally, 
if 
there 
be 
still 
persons 
who 
are 
not 
sufficiently 
persuaded 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
God 
and 
of 
the 
soul, 
by 
the 
reasons 
I 
have 
adduced, 
I 
am 
desirous 
that 
they 
should 
know 
that 
all 
the 
other 
propositions, 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
which 
they 
deem 
themselves 
perhaps 
more 
assured, 
as 
that 
we 
have 
a 
body, 
and 
that 
there 
exist 
stars 
and 
an 
earth, 
and 
such 
like, 
are 
less 
certain; 
for, 
although 
we 
have 
a 
moral 
assurance 
of 
these 
things, 
which 
is 
so 
strong 
that 
there 
is 
an 
appearance 
of 
extravagance 
in 
doubting 
of 
their 
existence, 
yet 
at 
the 
same 
time 
no 
one, 
unless 
his 
intellect 
is 
impaired, 
can 
deny, 
when 
the 
question 
relates 
to 
a 
metaphysical 
certitude, 
that 
there 
is 
sufficient 
reason 
to 
exclude 
entire 
assurance, 
in 
the 
observation 
that 
when 
asleep 
we 
can 
in 
the 
same 
way 
imagine 
ourselves 
possessed 
of 
another 
body 
and 
that 
we 
see 
other 
stars 
and 
another 
earth, 
when 
there 
is 
nothing 
of 
the 
kind. 
For 
how 
do 
we 
know 
that 
the 
thoughts 
which 
occur 
in 
dreaming 
are 
false 
rather 
than 
those 
other 
which 
we 
experience 
when 
awake, 
since 
the 
former 
are 
often 
not 
less 
vivid 
and 
distinct 
than 
the 
latter? 
And 
though 
men 
of 
the 
highest 
genius 
study 
this 
question 
as 
long 
as 
they 
please, 
I 
do 
not 
believe 
that 
they 
will 
be 
able 
to 
give 
any 
reason 
which 
can 
be 
sufficient 
to 
remove 
this 
doubt, 
unless 
they 
presuppose 
the 
existence 
of 
God. 
For, 
in 
the 
first 
place 
even 
the 
principle 
which 
I 
have 
already 
taken 
as 
a 
rule, 
viz., 
that 
all 
the 
things 
which 
we 
clearly 
and 
distinctly 
conceive 
are 
true, 
is 
certain 
only 
because 
God 
is 
or 
exists 
and 



because 
he 
is 
a 
Perfect 
Being, 
and 
because 
all 
that 
we 
possess 
is 
derived 
from 
him: 
whence 
it 
follows 
that 
our 
ideas 
or 
notions, 
which 
to 
the 
extent 
of 
their 
clearness 
and 
distinctness 
are 
real, 
and 
proceed 
from 
God, 
must 
to 
that 
extent 
be 
true. 
Accordingly, 
whereas 
we 
not 
infrequently 
have 
ideas 
or 
notions 
in 
which 
some 
falsity 
is 
contained, 
this 
can 
only 
be 
the 
case 
with 
such 
as 
are 
to 
some 
extent 
confused 
and 
obscure, 
and 
in 
this 
proceed 
from 
nothing 
(participate 
of 
negation), 
that 
is, 
exist 
in 
us 
thus 
confused 
because 
we 
are 
not 
wholly 
perfect. 
And 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
it 
is 
not 
less 
repugnant 
that 
falsity 
or 
imperfection, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
imperfection, 
should 
proceed 
from 
God, 
than 
that 
truth 
or 
perfection 
should 
proceed 
from 
nothing. 
But 
if 
we 
did 
not 
know 
that 
all 
which 
we 
possess 
of 
real 
and 
true 
proceeds 
from 
a 
Perfect 
and 
Infinite 
Being, 
however 
clear 
and 
distinct 
our 
ideas 
might 
be, 
we 
should 
have 
no 
ground 
on 
that 
account 
for 
the 
assurance 
that 
they 
possessed 
the 
perfection 
of 
being 
true. 


But 
after 
the 
knowledge 
of 
God 
and 
of 
the 
soul 
has 
rendered 
us 
certain 
of 
this 
rule, 
we 
can 
easily 
understand 
that 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
thoughts 
we 
experience 
when 
awake, 
ought 
not 
in 
the 
slightest 
degree 
to 
be 
called 
in 
question 
on 
account 
of 
the 
illusions 
of 
our 
dreams. 
For 
if 
it 
happened 
that 
an 
individual, 
even 
when 
asleep, 
had 
some 
very 
distinct 
idea, 
as, 
for 
example, 
if 
a 
geometer 
should 
discover 
some 
new 
demonstration, 
the 
circumstance 
of 
his 
being 
asleep 
would 
not 
militate 
against 
its 
truth; 
and 
as 
for 
the 
most 
ordinary 
error 
of 
our 
dreams, 
which 
consists 
in 
their 
representing 
to 
us 
various 
objects 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
our 
external 
senses, 
this 
is 
not 
prejudicial, 
since 
it 
leads 
us 
very 
properly 
to 
suspect 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
ideas 
of 
sense; 
for 
we 
are 
not 
infrequently 
deceived 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
when 
awake; 
as 
when 
persons 
in 
the 
jaundice 
see 
all 
objects 
yellow, 
or 
when 
the 
stars 
or 
bodies 
at 
a 
great 
distance 
appear 
to 
us 
much 
smaller 
than 
they 
are. 
For, 
in 
fine, 
whether 
awake 
or 
asleep, 
we 
ought 
never 
to 
allow 
ourselves 
to 
be 
persuaded 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
anything 
unless 
on 
the 
evidence 
of 
our 
reason. 
And 
it 
must 
be 
noted 
that 
I 
say 
of 
our 
reason, 
and 
not 
of 
our 
imagination 
or 
of 
our 
senses: 
thus, 
for 
example, 
although 
we 
very 
clearly 
see 
the 
sun, 
we 
ought 
not 
therefore 
to 
determine 
that 
it 
is 
only 
of 
the 
size 
which 
our 
sense 
of 
sight 
presents; 
and 
we 
may 
very 
distinctly 
imagine 
the 
head 
of 
a 
lion 
joined 
to 
the 
body 
of 
a 
goat, 
without 
being 
therefore 
shut 
up 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
a 
chimaera 
exists; 
for 
it 
is 
not 
a 
dictate 
of 
reason 
that 
what 
we 
thus 
see 
or 
imagine 
is 
in 
reality 
existent; 
but 
it 



plainly 
tells 
us 
that 
all 
our 
ideas 
or 
notions 
contain 
in 
them 
some 
truth; 
for 
otherwise 
it 
could 
not 
be 
that 
God, 
who 
is 
wholly 
perfect 
and 
veracious, 
should 
have 
placed 
them 
in 
us. 
And 
because 
our 
reasonings 
are 
never 
so 
clear 
or 
so 
complete 
during 
sleep 
as 
when 
we 
are 
awake, 
although 
sometimes 
the 
acts 
of 
our 
imagination 
are 
then 
as 
lively 
and 
distinct, 
if 
not 
more 
so 
than 
in 
our 
waking 
moments, 
reason 
further 
dictates 
that, 
since 
all 
our 
thoughts 
cannot 
be 
true 
because 
of 
our 
partial 
imperfection, 
those 
possessing 
truth 
must 
infallibly 
be 
found 
in 
the 
experience 
of 
our 
waking 
moments 
rather 
than 
in 
that 
of 
our 
dreams. 


PART 
V 


I 
would 
here 
willingly 
have 
proceeded 
to 
exhibit 
the 
whole 
chain 
of 
truths 
which 
I 
deduced 
from 
these 
primary 
but 
as 
with 
a 
view 
to 
this 
it 
would 
have 
been 
necessary 
now 
to 
treat 
of 
many 
questions 
in 
dispute 
among 
the 
earned, 
with 
whom 
I 
do 
not 
wish 
to 
be 
embroiled, 
I 
believe 
that 
it 
will 
be 
better 
for 
me 
to 
refrain 
from 
this 
exposition, 
and 
only 
mention 
in 
general 
what 
these 
truths 
are, 
that 
the 
more 
judicious 
may 
be 
able 
to 
determine 
whether 
a 
more 
special 
account 
of 
them 
would 
conduce 
to 
the 
public 
advantage. 
I 
have 
ever 
remained 
firm 
in 
my 
original 
resolution 
to 
suppose 
no 
other 
principle 
than 
that 
of 
which 
I 
have 
recently 
availed 
myself 
in 
demonstrating 
the 
existence 
of 
God 
and 
of 
the 
soul, 
and 
to 
accept 
as 
true 
nothing 
that 
did 
not 
appear 
to 
me 
more 
clear 
and 
certain 
than 
the 
demonstrations 
of 
the 
geometers 
had 
formerly 
appeared; 
and 
yet 
I 
venture 
to 
state 
that 
not 
only 
have 
I 
found 
means 
to 
satisfy 
myself 
in 
a 
short 
time 
on 
all 
the 
principal 
difficulties 
which 
are 
usually 
treated 
of 
in 
philosophy, 
but 
I 
have 
also 
observed 
certain 
laws 
established 
in 
nature 
by 
God 
in 
such 
a 
manner, 
and 
of 
which 
he 
has 
impressed 
on 
our 
minds 
such 
notions, 
that 
after 
we 
have 
reflected 
sufficiently 
upon 
these, 
we 
cannot 
doubt 
that 
they 
are 
accurately 
observed 
in 
all 
that 
exists 
or 
takes 
place 
in 
the 
world 
and 
farther, 
by 
considering 
the 
concatenation 
of 
these 
laws, 
it 
appears 
to 
me 
that 
I 
have 
discovered 
many 
truths 
more 
useful 
and 
more 
important 
than 
all 
I 
had 
before 
learned, 
or 
even 
had 
expected 
to 
learn. 



But 
because 
I 
have 
essayed 
to 
expound 
the 
chief 
of 
these 
discoveries 
in 
a 
treatise 
which 
certain 
considerations 
prevent 
me 
from 
publishing, 
I 
cannot 
make 
the 
results 
known 
more 
conveniently 
than 
by 
here 
giving 
a 
summary 
of 
the 
contents 
of 
this 
treatise. 
It 
was 
my 
design 
to 
comprise 
in 
it 
all 
that, 
before 
I 
set 
myself 
to 
write 
it, 
I 
thought 
I 
knew 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
material 
objects. 
But 
like 
the 
painters 
who, 
finding 
themselves 
unable 
to 
represent 
equally 
well 
on 
a 
plain 
surface 
all 
the 
different 
faces 
of 
a 
solid 
body, 
select 
one 
of 
the 
chief, 
on 
which 
alone 
they 
make 
the 
light 
fall, 
and 
throwing 
the 
rest 
into 
the 
shade, 
allow 
them 
to 
appear 
only 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
can 
be 
seen 
while 
looking 
at 
the 
principal 
one; 
so, 
fearing 
lest 
I 
should 
not 
be 
able 
to 
compense 
in 
my 
discourse 
all 
that 
was 
in 
my 
mind, 
I 
resolved 
to 
expound 
singly, 
though 
at 
considerable 
length, 
my 
opinions 
regarding 
light; 
then 
to 
take 
the 
opportunity 
of 
adding 
something 
on 
the 
sun 
and 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
since 
light 
almost 
wholly 
proceeds 
from 
them; 
on 
the 
heavens 
since 
they 
transmit 
it; 
on 
the 
planets, 
comets, 
and 
earth, 
since 
they 
reflect 
it; 
and 
particularly 
on 
all 
the 
bodies 
that 
are 
upon 
the 
earth, 
since 
they 
are 
either 
colored, 
or 
transparent, 
or 
luminous; 
and 
finally 
on 
man, 
since 
he 
is 
the 
spectator 
of 
these 
objects. 
Further, 
to 
enable 
me 
to 
cast 
this 
variety 
of 
subjects 
somewhat 
into 
the 
shade, 
and 
to 
express 
my 
judgment 
regarding 
them 
with 
greater 
freedom, 
without 
being 
necessitated 
to 
adopt 
or 
refute 
the 
opinions 
of 
the 
learned, 
I 
resolved 
to 
leave 
all 
the 
people 
here 
to 
their 
disputes, 
and 
to 
speak 
only 
of 
what 
would 
happen 
in 
a 
new 
world, 
if 
God 
were 
now 
to 
create 
somewhere 
in 
the 
imaginary 
spaces 
matter 
sufficient 
to 
compose 
one, 
and 
were 
to 
agitate 
variously 
and 
confusedly 
the 
different 
parts 
of 
this 
matter, 
so 
that 
there 
resulted 
a 
chaos 
as 
disordered 
as 
the 
poets 
ever 
feigned, 
and 
after 
that 
did 
nothing 
more 
than 
lend 
his 
ordinary 
concurrence 
to 
nature, 
and 
allow 
her 
to 
act 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
laws 
which 
he 
had 
established. 
On 
this 
supposition, 
I, 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
described 
this 
matter, 
and 
essayed 
to 
represent 
it 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
that 
to 
my 
mind 
there 
can 
be 
nothing 
clearer 
and 
more 
intelligible, 
except 
what 
has 
been 
recently 
said 
regarding 
God 
and 
the 
soul; 
for 
I 
even 
expressly 
supposed 
that 
it 
possessed 
none 
of 
those 
forms 
or 
qualities 
which 
are 
so 
debated 
in 
the 
schools, 
nor 
in 
general 
anything 
the 
knowledge 
of 
which 
is 
not 
so 
natural 
to 
our 
minds 
that 
no 
one 
can 
so 
much 
as 
imagine 
himself 
ignorant 
of 
it. 
Besides, 
I 
have 
pointed 
out 
what 
are 
the 
laws 
of 
nature; 
and, 
with 
no 
other 
principle 
upon 
which 
to 
found 
my 
reasonings 
except 
the 
infinite 
perfection 
of 
God, 
I 
endeavored 
to 
demonstrate 
all 
those 
about 
which 
there 



could 
be 
any 
room 
for 
doubt, 
and 
to 
prove 
that 
they 
are 
such, 
that 
even 
if 
God 
had 
created 
more 
worlds, 
there 
could 
have 
been 
none 
in 
which 
these 
laws 
were 
not 
observed. 
Thereafter, 
I 
showed 
how 
the 
greatest 
part 
of 
the 
matter 
of 
this 
chaos 
must, 
in 
accordance 
with 
these 
laws, 
dispose 
and 
arrange 
itself 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
present 
the 
appearance 
of 
heavens; 
how 
in 
the 
meantime 
some 
of 
its 
parts 
must 
compose 
an 
earth 
and 
some 
planets 
and 
comets, 
and 
others 
a 
sun 
and 
fixed 
stars. 
And, 
making 
a 
digression 
at 
this 
stage 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
light, 
I 
expounded 
at 
considerable 
length 
what 
the 
nature 
of 
that 
light 
must 
be 
which 
is 
found 
in 
the 
sun 
and 
the 
stars, 
and 
how 
thence 
in 
an 
instant 
of 
time 
it 
traverses 
the 
immense 
spaces 
of 
the 
heavens, 
and 
how 
from 
the 
planets 
and 
comets 
it 
is 
reflected 
towards 
the 
earth. 
To 
this 
I 
likewise 
added 
much 
respecting 
the 
substance, 
the 
situation, 
the 
motions, 
and 
all 
the 
different 
qualities 
of 
these 
heavens 
and 
stars; 
so 
that 
I 
thought 
I 
had 
said 
enough 
respecting 
them 
to 
show 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
observable 
in 
the 
heavens 
or 
stars 
of 
our 
system 
that 
must 
not, 
or 
at 
least 
may 
not 
appear 
precisely 
alike 
in 
those 
of 
the 
system 
which 
I 
described. 
I 
came 
next 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
earth 
in 
particular, 
and 
to 
show 
how, 
even 
though 
I 
had 
expressly 
supposed 
that 
God 
had 
given 
no 
weight 
to 
the 
matter 
of 
which 
it 
is 
composed, 
this 
should 
not 
prevent 
all 
its 
parts 
from 
tending 
exactly 
to 
its 
center; 
how 
with 
water 
and 
air 
on 
its 
surface, 
the 
disposition 
of 
the 
heavens 
and 
heavenly 
bodies, 
more 
especially 
of 
the 
moon, 
must 
cause 
a 
flow 
and 
ebb, 
like 
in 
all 
its 
circumstances 
to 
that 
observed 
in 
our 
seas, 
as 
also 
a 
certain 
current 
both 
of 
water 
and 
air 
from 
east 
to 
west, 
such 
as 
is 
likewise 
observed 
between 
the 
tropics; 
how 
the 
mountains, 
seas, 
fountains, 
and 
rivers 
might 
naturally 
be 
formed 
in 
it, 
and 
the 
metals 
produced 
in 
the 
mines, 
and 
the 
plants 
grow 
in 
the 
fields 
and 
in 
general, 
how 
all 
the 
bodies 
which 
are 
commonly 
denominated 
mixed 
or 
composite 
might 
be 
generated 
and, 
among 
other 
things 
in 
the 
discoveries 
alluded 
to 
inasmuch 
as 
besides 
the 
stars, 
I 
knew 
nothing 
except 
fire 
which 
produces 
light, 
I 
spared 
no 
pains 
to 
set 
forth 
all 
that 
pertains 
to 
its 
nature,--the 
manner 
of 
its 
production 
and 
support, 
and 
to 
explain 
how 
heat 
is 
sometimes 
found 
without 
light, 
and 
light 
without 
heat; 
to 
show 
how 
it 
can 
induce 
various 
colors 
upon 
different 
bodies 
and 
other 
diverse 
qualities; 
how 
it 
reduces 
some 
to 
a 
liquid 
state 
and 
hardens 
others; 
how 
it 
can 
consume 
almost 
all 
bodies, 
or 
convert 
them 
into 
ashes 
and 
smoke; 
and 
finally, 
how 
from 
these 
ashes, 
by 
the 
mere 
intensity 
of 
its 
action, 
it 
forms 
glass: 
for 
as 
this 
transmutation 
of 
ashes 
into 
glass 
appeared 
to 
me 
as 
wonderful 
as 
any 
other 
in 



nature, 
I 
took 
a 
special 
pleasure 
in 
describing 
it. 
I 
was 
not, 
however, 
disposed, 
from 
these 
circumstances, 
to 
conclude 
that 
this 
world 
had 
been 
created 
in 
the 
manner 
I 
described; 
for 
it 
is 
much 
more 
likely 
that 
God 
made 
it 
at 
the 
first 
such 
as 
it 
was 
to 
be. 
But 
this 
is 
certain, 
and 
an 
opinion 
commonly 
received 
among 
theologians, 
that 
the 
action 
by 
which 
he 
now 
sustains 
it 
is 
the 
same 
with 
that 
by 
which 
he 
originally 
created 
it; 
so 
that 
even 
although 
he 
had 
from 
the 
beginning 
given 
it 
no 
other 
form 
than 
that 
of 
chaos, 
provided 
only 
he 
had 
established 
certain 
laws 
of 
nature, 
and 
had 
lent 
it 
his 
concurrence 
to 
enable 
it 
to 
act 
as 
it 
is 
wont 
to 
do, 
it 
may 
be 
believed, 
without 
discredit 
to 
the 
miracle 
of 
creation, 
that, 
in 
this 
way 
alone, 
things 
purely 
material 
might, 
in 
course 
of 
time, 
have 
become 
such 
as 
we 
observe 
them 
at 
present; 
and 
their 
nature 
is 
much 
more 
easily 
conceived 
when 
they 
are 
beheld 
coming 
in 
this 
manner 
gradually 
into 
existence, 
than 
when 
they 
are 
only 
considered 
as 
produced 
at 
once 
in 
a 
finished 
and 
perfect 
state. 


From 
the 
description 
of 
inanimate 
bodies 
and 
plants, 
I 
passed 
to 
animals, 
and 
particularly 
to 
man. 
But 
since 
I 
had 
not 
as 
yet 
sufficient 
knowledge 
to 
enable 
me 
to 
treat 
of 
these 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
of 
the 
rest, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
by 
deducing 
effects 
from 
their 
causes, 
and 
by 
showing 
from 
what 
elements 
and 
in 
what 
manner 
nature 
must 
produce 
them, 
I 
remained 
satisfied 
with 
the 
supposition 
that 
God 
formed 
the 
body 
of 
man 
wholly 
like 
to 
one 
of 
ours, 
as 
well 
in 
the 
external 
shape 
of 
the 
members 
as 
in 
the 
internal 
conformation 
of 
the 
organs, 
of 
the 
same 
matter 
with 
that 
I 
had 
described, 
and 
at 
first 
placed 
in 
it 
no 
rational 
soul, 
nor 
any 
other 
principle, 
in 
room 
of 
the 
vegetative 
or 
sensitive 
soul, 
beyond 
kindling 
in 
the 
heart 
one 
of 
those 
fires 
without 
light, 
such 
as 
I 
had 
already 
described, 
and 
which 
I 
thought 
was 
not 
different 
from 
the 
heat 
in 
hay 
that 
has 
been 
heaped 
together 
before 
it 
is 
dry, 
or 
that 
which 
causes 
fermentation 
in 
new 
wines 
before 
they 
are 
run 
clear 
of 
the 
fruit. 
For, 
when 
I 
examined 
the 
kind 
of 
functions 
which 
might, 
as 
consequences 
of 
this 
supposition, 
exist 
in 
this 
body, 
I 
found 
precisely 
all 
those 
which 
may 
exist 
in 
us 
independently 
of 
all 
power 
of 
thinking, 
and 
consequently 
without 
being 
in 
any 
measure 
owing 
to 
the 
soul; 
in 
other 
words, 
to 
that 
part 
of 
us 
which 
is 
distinct 
from 
the 
body, 
and 
of 
which 
it 
has 
been 
said 
above 
that 
the 
nature 
distinctively 
consists 
in 
thinking, 
functions 
in 
which 
the 
animals 
void 
of 
reason 
may 
be 
said 
wholly 
to 
resemble 
us; 
but 
among 
which 
I 
could 
not 
discover 
any 
of 
those 
that, 
as 
dependent 
on 
thought 
alone, 
belong 
to 
us 
as 



men, 
while, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
I 
did 
afterwards 
discover 
these 
as 
soon 
as 
I 
supposed 
God 
to 
have 
created 
a 
rational 
soul, 
and 
to 
have 
annexed 
it 
to 
this 
body 
in 
a 
particular 
manner 
which 
I 
described. 


But, 
in 
order 
to 
show 
how 
I 
there 
handled 
this 
matter, 
I 
mean 
here 
to 
give 
the 
explication 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
heart 
and 
arteries, 
which, 
as 
the 
first 
and 
most 
general 
motion 
observed 
in 
animals, 
will 
afford 
the 
means 
of 
readily 
determining 
what 
should 
be 
thought 
of 
all 
the 
rest. 
And 
that 
there 
may 
be 
less 
difficulty 
in 
understanding 
what 
I 
am 
about 
to 
say 
on 
this 
subject, 
I 
advise 
those 
who 
are 
not 
versed 
in 
anatomy, 
before 
they 
commence 
the 
perusal 
of 
these 
observations, 
to 
take 
the 
trouble 
of 
getting 
dissected 
in 
their 
presence 
the 
heart 
of 
some 
large 
animal 
possessed 
of 
lungs 
(for 
this 
is 
throughout 
sufficiently 
like 
the 
human), 
and 
to 
have 
shown 
to 
them 
its 
two 
ventricles 
or 
cavities: 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
that 
in 
the 
right 
side, 
with 
which 
correspond 
two 
very 
ample 
tubes, 
viz., 
the 
hollow 
vein 
(vena 
cava), 
which 
is 
the 
principal 
receptacle 
of 
the 
blood, 
and 
the 
trunk 
of 
the 
tree, 
as 
it 
were, 
of 
which 
all 
the 
other 
veins 
in 
the 
body 
are 
branches; 
and 
the 
arterial 
vein 
(vena 
arteriosa), 
inappropriately 
so 
denominated, 
since 
it 
is 
in 
truth 
only 
an 
artery, 
which, 
taking 
its 
rise 
in 
the 
heart, 
is 
divided, 
after 
passing 
out 
from 
it, 
into 
many 
branches 
which 
presently 
disperse 
themselves 
all 
over 
the 
lungs; 
in 
the 
second 
place, 
the 
cavity 
in 
the 
left 
side, 
with 
which 
correspond 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
two 
canals 
in 
size 
equal 
to 
or 
larger 
than 
the 
preceding, 
viz., 
the 
venous 
artery 
(arteria 
venosa), 
likewise 
inappropriately 
thus 
designated, 
because 
it 
is 
simply 
a 
vein 
which 
comes 
from 
the 
lungs, 
where 
it 
is 
divided 
into 
many 
branches, 
interlaced 
with 
those 
of 
the 
arterial 
vein, 
and 
those 
of 
the 
tube 
called 
the 
windpipe, 
through 
which 
the 
air 
we 
breathe 
enters; 
and 
the 
great 
artery 
which, 
issuing 
from 
the 
heart, 
sends 
its 
branches 
all 
over 
the 
body. 
I 
should 
wish 
also 
that 
such 
persons 
were 
carefully 
shown 
the 
eleven 
pellicles 
which, 
like 
so 
many 
small 
valves, 
open 
and 
shut 
the 
four 
orifices 
that 
are 
in 
these 
two 
cavities, 
viz., 
three 
at 
the 
entrance 
of 
the 
hollow 
veins 
where 
they 
are 
disposed 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
as 
by 
no 
means 
to 
prevent 
the 
blood 
which 
it 
contains 
from 
flowing 
into 
the 
right 
ventricle 
of 
the 
heart, 
and 
yet 
exactly 
to 
prevent 
its 
flowing 
out; 
three 
at 
the 
entrance 
to 
the 
arterial 
vein, 
which, 
arranged 
in 
a 
manner 
exactly 
the 
opposite 
of 
the 
former, 
readily 
permit 
the 
blood 
contained 
in 
this 
cavity 
to 
pass 
into 
the 
lungs, 
but 
hinder 
that 
contained 
in 
the 
lungs 
from 
returning 
to 
this 
cavity; 
and, 
in 
like 
manner, 
two 



others 
at 
the 
mouth 
of 
the 
venous 
artery, 
which 
allow 
the 
blood 
from 
the 
lungs 
to 
flow 
into 
the 
left 
cavity 
of 
the 
heart, 
but 
preclude 
its 
return; 
and 
three 
at 
the 
mouth 
of 
the 
great 
artery, 
which 
suffer 
the 
blood 
to 
flow 
from 
the 
heart, 
but 
prevent 
its 
reflux. 
Nor 
do 
we 
need 
to 
seek 
any 
other 
reason 
for 
the 
number 
of 
these 
pellicles 
beyond 
this 
that 
the 
orifice 
of 
the 
venous 
artery 
being 
of 
an 
oval 
shape 
from 
the 
nature 
of 
its 
situation, 
can 
be 
adequately 
closed 
with 
two, 
whereas 
the 
others 
being 
round 
are 
more 
conveniently 
closed 
with 
three. 
Besides, 
I 
wish 
such 
persons 
to 
observe 
that 
the 
grand 
artery 
and 
the 
arterial 
vein 
are 
of 
much 
harder 
and 
firmer 
texture 
than 
the 
venous 
artery 
and 
the 
hollow 
vein; 
and 
that 
the 
two 
last 
expand 
before 
entering 
the 
heart, 
and 
there 
form, 
as 
it 
were, 
two 
pouches 
denominated 
the 
auricles 
of 
the 
heart, 
which 
are 
composed 
of 
a 
substance 
similar 
to 
that 
of 
the 
heart 
itself; 
and 
that 
there 
is 
always 
more 
warmth 
in 
the 
heart 
than 
in 
any 
other 
part 
of 
the 
body--and 
finally, 
that 
this 
heat 
is 
capable 
of 
causing 
any 
drop 
of 
blood 
that 
passes 
into 
the 
cavities 
rapidly 
to 
expand 
and 
dilate, 
just 
as 
all 
liquors 
do 
when 
allowed 
to 
fall 
drop 
by 
drop 
into 
a 
highly 
heated 
vessel. 


For, 
after 
these 
things, 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
for 
me 
to 
say 
anything 
more 
with 
a 
view 
to 
explain 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
heart, 
except 
that 
when 
its 
cavities 
are 
not 
full 
of 
blood, 
into 
these 
the 
blood 
of 
necessity 
flows,--from 
the 
hollow 
vein 
into 
the 
right, 
and 
from 
the 
venous 
artery 
into 
the 
left; 
because 
these 
two 
vessels 
are 
always 
full 
of 
blood, 
and 
their 
orifices, 
which 
are 
turned 
towards 
the 
heart, 
cannot 
then 
be 
closed. 
But 
as 
soon 
as 
two 
drops 
of 
blood 
have 
thus 
passed, 
one 
into 
each 
of 
the 
cavities, 
these 
drops 
which 
cannot 
but 
be 
very 
large, 
because 
the 
orifices 
through 
which 
they 
pass 
are 
wide, 
and 
the 
vessels 
from 
which 
they 
come 
full 
of 
blood, 
are 
immediately 
rarefied, 
and 
dilated 
by 
the 
heat 
they 
meet 
with. 
In 
this 
way 
they 
cause 
the 
whole 
heart 
to 
expand, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
press 
home 
and 
shut 
the 
five 
small 
valves 
that 
are 
at 
the 
entrances 
of 
the 
two 
vessels 
from 
which 
they 
flow, 
and 
thus 
prevent 
any 
more 
blood 
from 
coming 
down 
into 
the 
heart, 
and 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
rarefied, 
they 
push 
open 
the 
six 
small 
valves 
that 
are 
in 
the 
orifices 
of 
the 
other 
two 
vessels, 
through 
which 
they 
pass 
out, 
causing 
in 
this 
way 
all 
the 
branches 
of 
the 
arterial 
vein 
and 
of 
the 
grand 
artery 
to 
expand 
almost 
simultaneously 
with 
the 
heart 
which 
immediately 
thereafter 
begins 
to 
contract, 
as 
do 
also 
the 
arteries, 
because 
the 
blood 
that 
has 
entered 
them 
has 
cooled, 
and 
the 
six 
small 
valves 
close, 
and 
the 
five 
of 
the 
hollow 
vein 
and 
of 



the 
venous 
artery 
open 
anew 
and 
allow 
a 
passage 
to 
other 
two 
drops 
of 
blood, 
which 
cause 
the 
heart 
and 
the 
arteries 
again 
to 
expand 
as 
before. 
And, 
because 
the 
blood 
which 
thus 
enters 
into 
the 
heart 
passes 
through 
these 
two 
pouches 
called 
auricles, 
it 
thence 
happens 
that 
their 
motion 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
that 
of 
the 
heart, 
and 
that 
when 
it 
expands 
they 
contract. 
But 
lest 
those 
who 
are 
ignorant 
of 
the 
force 
of 
mathematical 
demonstrations 
and 
who 
are 
not 
accustomed 
to 
distinguish 
true 
reasons 
from 
mere 
verisimilitudes, 
should 
venture, 
without 
examination, 
to 
deny 
what 
has 
been 
said, 
I 
wish 
it 
to 
be 
considered 
that 
the 
motion 
which 
I 
have 
now 
explained 
follows 
as 
necessarily 
from 
the 
very 
arrangement 
of 
the 
parts, 
which 
may 
be 
observed 
in 
the 
heart 
by 
the 
eye 
alone, 
and 
from 
the 
heat 
which 
may 
be 
felt 
with 
the 
fingers, 
and 
from 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
blood 
as 
learned 
from 
experience, 
as 
does 
the 
motion 
of 
a 
clock 
from 
the 
power, 
the 
situation, 
and 
shape 
of 
its 
counterweights 
and 
wheels. 


But 
if 
it 
be 
asked 
how 
it 
happens 
that 
the 
blood 
in 
the 
veins, 
flowing 
in 
this 
way 
continually 
into 
the 
heart, 
is 
not 
exhausted, 
and 
why 
the 
arteries 
do 
not 
become 
too 
full, 
since 
all 
the 
blood 
which 
passes 
through 
the 
heart 
flows 
into 
them, 
I 
need 
only 
mention 
in 
reply 
what 
has 
been 
written 
by 
a 
physician 
of 
England, 
who 
has 
the 
honor 
of 
having 
broken 
the 
ice 
on 
this 
subject, 
and 
of 
having 
been 
the 
first 
to 
teach 
that 
there 
are 
many 
small 
passages 
at 
the 
extremities 
of 
the 
arteries, 
through 
which 
the 
blood 
received 
by 
them 
from 
the 
heart 
passes 
into 
the 
small 
branches 
of 
the 
veins, 
whence 
it 
again 
returns 
to 
the 
heart; 
so 
that 
its 
course 
amounts 
precisely 
to 
a 
perpetual 
circulation. 
Of 
this 
we 
have 
abundant 
proof 
in 
the 
ordinary 
experience 
of 
surgeons, 
who, 
by 
binding 
the 
arm 
with 
a 
tie 
of 
moderate 
straitness 
above 
the 
part 
where 
they 
open 
the 
vein, 
cause 
the 
blood 
to 
flow 
more 
copiously 
than 
it 
would 
have 
done 
without 
any 
ligature; 
whereas 
quite 
the 
contrary 
would 
happen 
were 
they 
to 
bind 
it 
below; 
that 
is, 
between 
the 
hand 
and 
the 
opening, 
or 
were 
to 
make 
the 
ligature 
above 
the 
opening 
very 
tight. 
For 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
the 
tie, 
moderately 
straightened, 
while 
adequate 
to 
hinder 
the 
blood 
already 
in 
the 
arm 
from 
returning 
towards 
the 
heart 
by 
the 
veins, 
cannot 
on 
that 
account 
prevent 
new 
blood 
from 
coming 
forward 
through 
the 
arteries, 
because 
these 
are 
situated 
below 
the 
veins, 
and 
their 
coverings, 
from 
their 
greater 
consistency, 
are 
more 
difficult 
to 
compress; 
and 
also 
that 
the 
blood 
which 
comes 
from 
the 
heart 
tends 
to 
pass 
through 
them 
to 
the 
hand 
with 
greater 



force 
than 
it 
does 
to 
return 
from 
the 
hand 
to 
the 
heart 
through 
the 
veins. 
And 
since 
the 
latter 
current 
escapes 
from 
the 
arm 
by 
the 
opening 
made 
in 
one 
of 
the 
veins, 
there 
must 
of 
necessity 
be 
certain 
passages 
below 
the 
ligature, 
that 
is, 
towards 
the 
extremities 
of 
the 
arm 
through 
which 
it 
can 
come 
thither 
from 
the 
arteries. 
This 
physician 
likewise 
abundantly 
establishes 
what 
he 
has 
advanced 
respecting 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
blood, 
from 
the 
existence 
of 
certain 
pellicles, 
so 
disposed 
in 
various 
places 
along 
the 
course 
of 
the 
veins, 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
small 
valves, 
as 
not 
to 
permit 
the 
blood 
to 
pass 
from 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
body 
towards 
the 
extremities, 
but 
only 
to 
return 
from 
the 
extremities 
to 
the 
heart; 
and 
farther, 
from 
experience 
which 
shows 
that 
all 
the 
blood 
which 
is 
in 
the 
body 
may 
flow 
out 
of 
it 
in 
a 
very 
short 
time 
through 
a 
single 
artery 
that 
has 
been 
cut, 
even 
although 
this 
had 
been 
closely 
tied 
in 
the 
immediate 
neighborhood 
of 
the 
heart 
and 
cut 
between 
the 
heart 
and 
the 
ligature, 
so 
as 
to 
prevent 
the 
supposition 
that 
the 
blood 
flowing 
out 
of 
it 
could 
come 
from 
any 
other 
quarter 
than 
the 
heart. 


But 
there 
are 
many 
other 
circumstances 
which 
evince 
that 
what 
I 
have 
alleged 
is 
the 
true 
cause 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
blood: 
thus, 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
the 
difference 
that 
is 
observed 
between 
the 
blood 
which 
flows 
from 
the 
veins, 
and 
that 
from 
the 
arteries, 
can 
only 
arise 
from 
this, 
that 
being 
rarefied, 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
distilled 
by 
passing 
through 
the 
heart, 
it 
is 
thinner, 
and 
more 
vivid, 
and 
warmer 
immediately 
after 
leaving 
the 
heart, 
in 
other 
words, 
when 
in 
the 
arteries, 
than 
it 
was 
a 
short 
time 
before 
passing 
into 
either, 
in 
other 
words, 
when 
it 
was 
in 
the 
veins; 
and 
if 
attention 
be 
given, 
it 
will 
be 
found 
that 
this 
difference 
is 
very 
marked 
only 
in 
the 
neighborhood 
of 
the 
heart; 
and 
is 
not 
so 
evident 
in 
parts 
more 
remote 
from 
it. 
In 
the 
next 
place, 
the 
consistency 
of 
the 
coats 
of 
which 
the 
arterial 
vein 
and 
the 
great 
artery 
are 
composed, 
sufficiently 
shows 
that 
the 
blood 
is 
impelled 
against 
them 
with 
more 
force 
than 
against 
the 
veins. 
And 
why 
should 
the 
left 
cavity 
of 
the 
heart 
and 
the 
great 
artery 
be 
wider 
and 
larger 
than 
the 
right 
cavity 
and 
the 
arterial 
vein, 
were 
it 
not 
that 
the 
blood 
of 
the 
venous 
artery, 
having 
only 
been 
in 
the 
lungs 
after 
it 
has 
passed 
through 
the 
heart, 
is 
thinner, 
and 
rarefies 
more 
readily, 
and 
in 
a 
higher 
degree, 
than 
the 
blood 
which 
proceeds 
immediately 
from 
the 
hollow 
vein? 
And 
what 
can 
physicians 
conjecture 
from 
feeling 
the 
pulse 
unless 
they 
know 
that 
according 
as 
the 
blood 
changes 
its 
nature 
it 
can 
be 
rarefied 
by 
the 
warmth 
of 
the 
heart, 
in 
a 
higher 
or 
lower 
degree, 
and 
more 
or 
less 
quickly 
than 



before? 
And 
if 
it 
be 
inquired 
how 
this 
heat 
is 
communicated 
to 
the 
other 
members, 
must 
it 
not 
be 
admitted 
that 
this 
is 
effected 
by 
means 
of 
the 
blood, 
which, 
passing 
through 
the 
heart, 
is 
there 
heated 
anew, 
and 
thence 
diffused 
over 
all 
the 
body? 
Whence 
it 
happens, 
that 
if 
the 
blood 
be 
withdrawn 
from 
any 
part, 
the 
heat 
is 
likewise 
withdrawn 
by 
the 
same 
means; 
and 
although 
the 
heart 
were 
as-hot 
as 
glowing 
iron, 
it 
would 
not 
be 
capable 
of 
warming 
the 
feet 
and 
hands 
as 
at 
present, 
unless 
it 
continually 
sent 
thither 
new 
blood. 
We 
likewise 
perceive 
from 
this, 
that 
the 
true 
use 
of 
respiration 
is 
to 
bring 
sufficient 
fresh 
air 
into 
the 
lungs, 
to 
cause 
the 
blood 
which 
flows 
into 
them 
from 
the 
right 
ventricle 
of 
the 
heart, 
where 
it 
has 
been 
rarefied 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
changed 
into 
vapors, 
to 
become 
thick, 
and 
to 
convert 
it 
anew 
into 
blood, 
before 
it 
flows 
into 
the 
left 
cavity, 
without 
which 
process 
it 
would 
be 
unfit 
for 
the 
nourishment 
of 
the 
fire 
that 
is 
there. 
This 
receives 
confirmation 
from 
the 
circumstance, 
that 
it 
is 
observed 
of 
animals 
destitute 
of 
lungs 
that 
they 
have 
also 
but 
one 
cavity 
in 
the 
heart, 
and 
that 
in 
children 
who 
cannot 
use 
them 
while 
in 
the 
womb, 
there 
is 
a 
hole 
through 
which 
the 
blood 
flows 
from 
the 
hollow 
vein 
into 
the 
left 
cavity 
of 
the 
heart, 
and 
a 
tube 
through 
which 
it 
passes 
from 
the 
arterial 
vein 
into 
the 
grand 
artery 
without 
passing 
through 
the 
lung. 
In 
the 
next 
place, 
how 
could 
digestion 
be 
carried 
on 
in 
the 
stomach 
unless 
the 
heart 
communicated 
heat 
to 
it 
through 
the 
arteries, 
and 
along 
with 
this 
certain 
of 
the 
more 
fluid 
parts 
of 
the 
blood, 
which 
assist 
in 
the 
dissolution 
of 
the 
food 
that 
has 
been 
taken 
in? 
Is 
not 
also 
the 
operation 
which 
converts 
the 
juice 
of 
food 
into 
blood 
easily 
comprehended, 
when 
it 
is 
considered 
that 
it 
is 
distilled 
by 
passing 
and 
repassing 
through 
the 
heart 
perhaps 
more 
than 
one 
or 
two 
hundred 
times 
in 
a 
day? 
And 
what 
more 
need 
be 
adduced 
to 
explain 
nutrition, 
and 
the 
production 
of 
the 
different 
humors 
of 
the 
body, 
beyond 
saying, 
that 
the 
force 
with 
which 
the 
blood, 
in 
being 
rarefied, 
passes 
from 
the 
heart 
towards 
the 
extremities 
of 
the 
arteries, 
causes 
certain 
of 
its 
parts 
to 
remain 
in 
the 
members 
at 
which 
they 
arrive, 
and 
there 
occupy 
the 
place 
of 
some 
others 
expelled 
by 
them; 
and 
that 
according 
to 
the 
situation, 
shape, 
or 
smallness 
of 
the 
pores 
with 
which 
they 
meet, 
some 
rather 
than 
others 
flow 
into 
certain 
parts, 
in 
the 
same 
way 
that 
some 
sieves 
are 
observed 
to 
act, 
which, 
by 
being 
variously 
perforated, 
serve 
to 
separate 
different 
species 
of 
grain? 
And, 
in 
the 
last 
place, 
what 
above 
all 
is 
here 
worthy 
of 
observation, 
is 
the 
generation 
of 
the 
animal 
spirits, 
which 
are 
like 
a 
very 
subtle 
wind, 
or 
rather 
a 
very 
pure 
and 
vivid 
flame 
which, 
continually 
ascending 
in 
great 



abundance 
from 
the 
heart 
to 
the 
brain, 
thence 
penetrates 
through 
the 
nerves 
into 
the 
muscles, 
and 
gives 
motion 
to 
all 
the 
members; 
so 
that 
to 
account 
for 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
blood 
which, 
as 
most 
agitated 
and 
penetrating, 
are 
the 
fittest 
to 
compose 
these 
spirits, 
proceeding 
towards 
the 
brain, 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
to 
suppose 
any 
other 
cause, 
than 
simply, 
that 
the 
arteries 
which 
carry 
them 
thither 
proceed 
from 
the 
heart 
in 
the 
most 
direct 
lines, 
and 
that, 
according 
to 
the 
rules 
of 
mechanics 
which 
are 
the 
same 
with 
those 
of 
nature, 
when 
many 
objects 
tend 
at 
once 
to 
the 
same 
point 
where 
there 
is 
not 
sufficient 
room 
for 
all 
(as 
is 
the 
case 
with 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
blood 
which 
flow 
forth 
from 
the 
left 
cavity 
of 
the 
heart 
and 
tend 
towards 
the 
brain), 
the 
weaker 
and 
less 
agitated 
parts 
must 
necessarily 
be 
driven 
aside 
from 
that 
point 
by 
the 
stronger 
which 
alone 
in 
this 
way 
reach 
it 
I 
had 
expounded 
all 
these 
matters 
with 
sufficient 
minuteness 
in 
the 
treatise 
which 
I 
formerly 
thought 
of 
publishing. 
And 
after 
these, 
I 
had 
shown 
what 
must 
be 
the 
fabric 
of 
the 
nerves 
and 
muscles 
of 
the 
human 
body 
to 
give 
the 
animal 
spirits 
contained 
in 
it 
the 
power 
to 
move 
the 
members, 
as 
when 
we 
see 
heads 
shortly 
after 
they 
have 
been 
struck 
off 
still 
move 
and 
bite 
the 
earth, 
although 
no 
longer 
animated; 
what 
changes 
must 
take 
place 
in 
the 
brain 
to 
produce 
waking, 
sleep, 
and 
dreams; 
how 
light, 
sounds, 
odors, 
tastes, 
heat, 
and 
all 
the 
other 
qualities 
of 
external 
objects 
impress 
it 
with 
different 
ideas 
by 
means 
of 
the 
senses; 
how 
hunger, 
thirst, 
and 
the 
other 
internal 
affections 
can 
likewise 
impress 
upon 
it 
divers 
ideas; 
what 
must 
be 
understood 
by 
the 
common 
sense 
(sensus 
communis) 
in 
which 
these 
ideas 
are 
received, 
by 
the 
memory 
which 
retains 
them, 
by 
the 
fantasy 
which 
can 
change 
them 
in 
various 
ways, 
and 
out 
of 
them 
compose 
new 
ideas, 
and 
which, 
by 
the 
same 
means, 
distributing 
the 
animal 
spirits 
through 
the 
muscles, 
can 
cause 
the 
members 
of 
such 
a 
body 
to 
move 
in 
as 
many 
different 
ways, 
and 
in 
a 
manner 
as 
suited, 
whether 
to 
the 
objects 
that 
are 
presented 
to 
its 
senses 
or 
to 
its 
internal 
affections, 
as 
can 
take 
place 
in 
our 
own 
case 
apart 
from 
the 
guidance 
of 
the 
will. 
Nor 
will 
this 
appear 
at 
all 
strange 
to 
those 
who 
are 
acquainted 
with 
the 
variety 
of 
movements 
performed 
by 
the 
different 
automata, 
or 
moving 
machines 
fabricated 
by 
human 
industry, 
and 
that 
with 
help 
of 
but 
few 
pieces 
compared 
with 
the 
great 
multitude 
of 
bones, 
muscles, 
nerves, 
arteries, 
veins, 
and 
other 
parts 
that 
are 
found 
in 
the 
body 
of 
each 
animal. 
Such 
persons 
will 
look 
upon 
this 
body 
as 
a 
machine 
made 
by 
the 
hands 
of 
God, 
which 
is 
incomparably 
better 
arranged, 
and 
adequate 
to 
movements 
more 
admirable 
than 
is 
any 
machine 
of 
human 
invention. 
And 



here 
I 
specially 
stayed 
to 
show 
that, 
were 
there 
such 
machines 
exactly 
resembling 
organs 
and 
outward 
form 
an 
ape 
or 
any 
other 
irrational 
animal, 
we 
could 
have 
no 
means 
of 
knowing 
that 
they 
were 
in 
any 
respect 
of 
a 
different 
nature 
from 
these 
animals; 
but 
if 
there 
were 
machines 
bearing 
the 
image 
of 
our 
bodies, 
and 
capable 
of 
imitating 
our 
actions 
as 
far 
as 
it 
is 
morally 
possible, 
there 
would 
still 
remain 
two 
most 
certain 
tests 
whereby 
to 
know 
that 
they 
were 
not 
therefore 
really 
men. 
Of 
these 
the 
first 
is 
that 
they 
could 
never 
use 
words 
or 
other 
signs 
arranged 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
as 
is 
competent 
to 
us 
in 
order 
to 
declare 
our 
thoughts 
to 
others: 
for 
we 
may 
easily 
conceive 
a 
machine 
to 
be 
so 
constructed 
that 
it 
emits 
vocables, 
and 
even 
that 
it 
emits 
some 
correspondent 
to 
the 
action 
upon 
it 
of 
external 
objects 
which 
cause 
a 
change 
in 
its 
organs; 
for 
example, 
if 
touched 
in 
a 
particular 
place 
it 
may 
demand 
what 
we 
wish 
to 
say 
to 
it; 
if 
in 
another 
it 
may 
cry 
out 
that 
it 
is 
hurt, 
and 
such 
like; 
but 
not 
that 
it 
should 
arrange 
them 
variously 
so 
as 
appositely 
to 
reply 
to 
what 
is 
said 
in 
its 
presence, 
as 
men 
of 
the 
lowest 
grade 
of 
intellect 
can 
do. 
The 
second 
test 
is, 
that 
although 
such 
machines 
might 
execute 
many 
things 
with 
equal 
or 
perhaps 
greater 
perfection 
than 
any 
of 
us, 
they 
would, 
without 
doubt, 
fail 
in 
certain 
others 
from 
which 
it 
could 
be 
discovered 
that 
they 
did 
not 
act 
from 
knowledge, 
but 
solely 
from 
the 
disposition 
of 
their 
organs: 
for 
while 
reason 
is 
an 
universal 
instrument 
that 
is 
alike 
available 
on 
every 
occasion, 
these 
organs, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
need 
a 
particular 
arrangement 
for 
each 
particular 
action; 
whence 
it 
must 
be 
morally 
impossible 
that 
there 
should 
exist 
in 
any 
machine 
a 
diversity 
of 
organs 
sufficient 
to 
enable 
it 
to 
act 
in 
all 
the 
occurrences 
of 
life, 
in 
the 
way 
in 
which 
our 
reason 
enables 
us 
to 
act. 
Again, 
by 
means 
of 
these 
two 
tests 
we 
may 
likewise 
know 
the 
difference 
between 
men 
and 
brutes. 
For 
it 
is 
highly 
deserving 
of 
remark, 
that 
there 
are 
no 
men 
so 
dull 
and 
stupid, 
not 
even 
idiots, 
as 
to 
be 
incapable 
of 
joining 
together 
different 
words, 
and 
thereby 
constructing 
a 
declaration 
by 
which 
to 
make 
their 
thoughts 
understood; 
and 
that 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
there 
is 
no 
other 
animal, 
however 
perfect 
or 
happily 
circumstanced, 
which 
can 
do 
the 
like. 
Nor 
does 
this 
inability 
arise 
from 
want 
of 
organs: 
for 
we 
observe 
that 
magpies 
and 
parrots 
can 
utter 
words 
like 
ourselves, 
and 
are 
yet 
unable 
to 
speak 
as 
we 
do, 
that 
is, 
so 
as 
to 
show 
that 
they 
understand 
what 
they 
say; 
in 
place 
of 
which 
men 
born 
deaf 
and 
dumb, 
and 
thus 
not 
less, 
but 
rather 
more 
than 
the 
brutes, 
destitute 
of 
the 
organs 
which 
others 
use 
in 
speaking, 
are 
in 
the 
habit 
of 
spontaneously 
inventing 



certain 
signs 
by 
which 
they 
discover 
their 
thoughts 
to 
those 
who, 
being 
usually 
in 
their 
company, 
have 
leisure 
to 
learn 
their 
language. 
And 
this 
proves 
not 
only 
that 
the 
brutes 
have 
less 
reason 
than 
man, 
but 
that 
they 
have 
none 
at 
all: 
for 
we 
see 
that 
very 
little 
is 
required 
to 
enable 
a 
person 
to 
speak; 
and 
since 
a 
certain 
inequality 
of 
capacity 
is 
observable 
among 
animals 
of 
the 
same 
species, 
as 
well 
as 
among 
men, 
and 
since 
some 
are 
more 
capable 
of 
being 
instructed 
than 
others, 
it 
is 
incredible 
that 
the 
most 
perfect 
ape 
or 
parrot 
of 
its 
species, 
should 
not 
in 
this 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
most 
stupid 
infant 
of 
its 
kind 
or 
at 
least 
to 
one 
that 
was 
crack-brained, 
unless 
the 
soul 
of 
brutes 
were 
of 
a 
nature 
wholly 
different 
from 
ours. 
And 
we 
ought 
not 
to 
confound 
speech 
with 
the 
natural 
movements 
which 
indicate 
the 
passions, 
and 
can 
be 
imitated 
by 
machines 
as 
well 
as 
manifested 
by 
animals; 
nor 
must 
it 
be 
thought 
with 
certain 
of 
the 
ancients, 
that 
the 
brutes 
speak, 
although 
we 
do 
not 
understand 
their 
language. 
For 
if 
such 
were 
the 
case, 
since 
they 
are 
endowed 
with 
many 
organs 
analogous 
to 
ours, 
they 
could 
as 
easily 
communicate 
their 
thoughts 
to 
us 
as 
to 
their 
fellows. 
It 
is 
also 
very 
worthy 
of 
remark, 
that, 
though 
there 
are 
many 
animals 
which 
manifest 
more 
industry 
than 
we 
in 
certain 
of 
their 
actions, 
the 
same 
animals 
are 
yet 
observed 
to 
show 
none 
at 
all 
in 
many 
others: 
so 
that 
the 
circumstance 
that 
they 
do 
better 
than 
we 
does 
not 
prove 
that 
they 
are 
endowed 
with 
mind, 
for 
it 
would 
thence 
follow 
that 
they 
possessed 
greater 
reason 
than 
any 
of 
us, 
and 
could 
surpass 
us 
in 
all 
things; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
it 
rather 
proves 
that 
they 
are 
destitute 
of 
reason, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
nature 
which 
acts 
in 
them 
according 
to 
the 
disposition 
of 
their 
organs: 
thus 
it 
is 
seen, 
that 
a 
clock 
composed 
only 
of 
wheels 
and 
weights 
can 
number 
the 
hours 
and 
measure 
time 
more 
exactly 
than 
we 
with 
all 
our 
skin. 


I 
had 
after 
this 
described 
the 
reasonable 
soul, 
and 
shown 
that 
it 
could 
by 
no 
means 
be 
educed 
from 
the 
power 
of 
matter, 
as 
the 
other 
things 
of 
which 
I 
had 
spoken, 
but 
that 
it 
must 
be 
expressly 
created; 
and 
that 
it 
is 
not 
sufficient 
that 
it 
be 
lodged 
in 
the 
human 
body 
exactly 
like 
a 
pilot 
in 
a 
ship, 
unless 
perhaps 
to 
move 
its 
members, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
for 
it 
to 
be 
joined 
and 
united 
more 
closely 
to 
the 
body, 
in 
order 
to 
have 
sensations 
and 
appetites 
similar 
to 
ours, 
and 
thus 
constitute 
a 
real 
man. 
I 
here 
entered, 
in 
conclusion, 
upon 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
soul 
at 
considerable 
length, 
because 
it 
is 
of 
the 
greatest 
moment: 
for 
after 
the 
error 
of 
those 
who 
deny 
the 
existence 
of 
God, 
an 
error 
which 
I 
think 
I 
have 
already 
sufficiently 
refuted, 
there 
is 
none 
that 
is 



more 
powerful 
in 
leading 
feeble 
minds 
astray 
from 
the 
straight 
path 
of 
virtue 
than 
the 
supposition 
that 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
brutes 
is 
of 
the 
same 
nature 
with 
our 
own; 
and 
consequently 
that 
after 
this 
life 
we 
have 
nothing 
to 
hope 
for 
or 
fear, 
more 
than 
flies 
and 
ants; 
in 
place 
of 
which, 
when 
we 
know 
how 
far 
they 
differ 
we 
much 
better 
comprehend 
the 
reasons 
which 
establish 
that 
the 
soul 
is 
of 
a 
nature 
wholly 
independent 
of 
the 
body, 
and 
that 
consequently 
it 
is 
not 
liable 
to 
die 
with 
the 
latter 
and, 
finally, 
because 
no 
other 
causes 
are 
observed 
capable 
of 
destroying 
it, 
we 
are 
naturally 
led 
thence 
to 
judge 
that 
it 
is 
immortal. 


PART 
VI 


Three 
years 
have 
now 
elapsed 
since 
I 
finished 
the 
treatise 
containing 
all 
these 
matters; 
and 
I 
was 
beginning 
to 
revise 
it, 
with 
the 
view 
to 
put 
it 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
a 
printer, 
when 
I 
learned 
that 
persons 
to 
whom 
I 
greatly 
defer, 
and 
whose 
authority 
over 
my 
actions 
is 
hardly 
less 
influential 
than 
is 
my 
own 
reason 
over 
my 
thoughts, 
had 
condemned 
a 
certain 
doctrine 
in 
physics, 
published 
a 
short 
time 
previously 
by 
another 
individual 
to 
which 
I 
will 
not 
say 
that 
I 
adhered, 
but 
only 
that, 
previously 
to 
their 
censure 
I 
had 
observed 
in 
it 
nothing 
which 
I 
could 
imagine 
to 
be 
prejudicial 
either 
to 
religion 
or 
to 
the 
state, 
and 
nothing 
therefore 
which 
would 
have 
prevented 
me 
from 
giving 
expression 
to 
it 
in 
writing, 
if 
reason 
had 
persuaded 
me 
of 
its 
truth; 
and 
this 
led 
me 
to 
fear 
lest 
among 
my 
own 
doctrines 
likewise 
some 
one 
might 
be 
found 
in 
which 
I 
had 
departed 
from 
the 
truth, 
notwithstanding 
the 
great 
care 
I 
have 
always 
taken 
not 
to 
accord 
belief 
to 
new 
opinions 
of 
which 
I 
had 
not 
the 
most 
certain 
demonstrations, 
and 
not 
to 
give 
expression 
to 
aught 
that 
might 
tend 
to 
the 
hurt 
of 
any 
one. 
This 
has 
been 
sufficient 
to 
make 
me 
alter 
my 
purpose 
of 
publishing 
them; 
for 
although 
the 
reasons 
by 
which 
I 
had 
been 
induced 
to 
take 
this 
resolution 
were 
very 
strong, 
yet 
my 
inclination, 
which 
has 
always 
been 
hostile 
to 
writing 
books, 
enabled 
me 
immediately 
to 
discover 
other 
considerations 
sufficient 
to 
excuse 
me 
for 
not 
undertaking 
the 
task. 
And 
these 
reasons, 
on 
one 
side 
and 
the 
other, 
are 
such, 
that 
not 
only 
is 
it 
in 
some 
measure 
my 
interest 
here 
to 
state 
them, 
but 
that 
of 
the 
public, 



perhaps, 
to 
know 
them. 


I 
have 
never 
made 
much 
account 
of 
what 
has 
proceeded 
from 
my 
own 
mind; 
and 
so 
long 
as 
I 
gathered 
no 
other 
advantage 
from 
the 
method 
I 
employ 
beyond 
satisfying 
myself 
on 
some 
difficulties 
belonging 
to 
the 
speculative 
sciences, 
or 
endeavoring 
to 
regulate 
my 
actions 
according 
to 
the 
principles 
it 
taught 
me, 
I 
never 
thought 
myself 
bound 
to 
publish 
anything 
respecting 
it. 
For 
in 
what 
regards 
manners, 
every 
one 
is 
so 
full 
of 
his 
own 
wisdom, 
that 
there 
might 
be 
found 
as 
many 
reformers 
as 
heads, 
if 
any 
were 
allowed 
to 
take 
upon 
themselves 
the 
task 
of 
mending 
them, 
except 
those 
whom 
God 
has 
constituted 
the 
supreme 
rulers 
of 
his 
people 
or 
to 
whom 
he 
has 
given 
sufficient 
grace 
and 
zeal 
to 
be 
prophets; 
and 
although 
my 
speculations 
greatly 
pleased 
myself, 
I 
believed 
that 
others 
had 
theirs, 
which 
perhaps 
pleased 
them 
still 
more. 
But 
as 
soon 
as 
I 
had 
acquired 
some 
general 
notions 
respecting 
physics, 
and 
beginning 
to 
make 
trial 
of 
them 
in 
various 
particular 
difficulties, 
had 
observed 
how 
far 
they 
can 
carry 
us, 
and 
how 
much 
they 
differ 
from 
the 
principles 
that 
have 
been 
employed 
up 
to 
the 
present 
time, 
I 
believed 
that 
I 
could 
not 
keep 
them 
concealed 
without 
sinning 
grievously 
against 
the 
law 
by 
which 
we 
are 
bound 
to 
promote, 
as 
far 
as 
in 
us 
lies, 
the 
general 
good 
of 
mankind. 
For 
by 
them 
I 
perceived 
it 
to 
be 
possible 
to 
arrive 
at 
knowledge 
highly 
useful 
in 
life; 
and 
in 
room 
of 
the 
speculative 
philosophy 
usually 
taught 
in 
the 
schools, 
to 
discover 
a 
practical, 
by 
means 
of 
which, 
knowing 
the 
force 
and 
action 
of 
fire, 
water, 
air 
the 
stars, 
the 
heavens, 
and 
all 
the 
other 
bodies 
that 
surround 
us, 
as 
distinctly 
as 
we 
know 
the 
various 
crafts 
of 
our 
artisans, 
we 
might 
also 
apply 
them 
in 
the 
same 
way 
to 
all 
the 
uses 
to 
which 
they 
are 
adapted, 
and 
thus 
render 
ourselves 
the 
lords 
and 
possessors 
of 
nature. 
And 
this 
is 
a 
result 
to 
be 
desired, 
not 
only 
in 
order 
to 
the 
invention 
of 
an 
infinity 
of 
arts, 
by 
which 
we 
might 
be 
enabled 
to 
enjoy 
without 
any 
trouble 
the 
fruits 
of 
the 
earth, 
and 
all 
its 
comforts, 
but 
also 
and 
especially 
for 
the 
preservation 
of 
health, 
which 
is 
without 
doubt, 
of 
all 
the 
blessings 
of 
this 
life, 
the 
first 
and 
fundamental 
one; 
for 
the 
mind 
is 
so 
intimately 
dependent 
upon 
the 
condition 
and 
relation 
of 
the 
organs 
of 
the 
body, 
that 
if 
any 
means 
can 
ever 
be 
found 
to 
render 
men 
wiser 
and 
more 
ingenious 
than 
hitherto, 
I 
believe 
that 
it 
is 
in 
medicine 
they 
must 
be 
sought 
for. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
science 
of 
medicine, 
as 
it 
now 
exists, 
contains 
few 
things 
whose 
utility 
is 
very 
remarkable: 
but 
without 
any 
wish 
to 
depreciate 
it, 
I 
am 
confident 
that 
there 
is 
no 
one, 
even 
among 



those 
whose 
profession 
it 
is, 
who 
does 
not 
admit 
that 
all 
at 
present 
known 
in 
it 
is 
almost 
nothing 
in 
comparison 
of 
what 
remains 
to 
be 
discovered; 
and 
that 
we 
could 
free 
ourselves 
from 
an 
infinity 
of 
maladies 
of 
body 
as 
well 
as 
of 
mind, 
and 
perhaps 
also 
even 
from 
the 
debility 
of 
age, 
if 
we 
had 
sufficiently 
ample 
knowledge 
of 
their 
causes, 
and 
of 
all 
the 
remedies 
provided 
for 
us 
by 
nature. 
But 
since 
I 
designed 
to 
employ 
my 
whole 
life 
in 
the 
search 
after 
so 
necessary 
a 
science, 
and 
since 
I 
had 
fallen 
in 
with 
a 
path 
which 
seems 
to 
me 
such, 
that 
if 
any 
one 
follow 
it 
he 
must 
inevitably 
reach 
the 
end 
desired, 
unless 
he 
be 
hindered 
either 
by 
the 
shortness 
of 
life 
or 
the 
want 
of 
experiments, 
I 
judged 
that 
there 
could 
be 
no 
more 
effectual 
provision 
against 
these 
two 
impediments 
than 
if 
I 
were 
faithfully 
to 
communicate 
to 
the 
public 
all 
the 
little 
I 
might 
myself 
have 
found, 
and 
incite 
men 
of 
superior 
genius 
to 
strive 
to 
proceed 
farther, 
by 
contributing, 
each 
according 
to 
his 
inclination 
and 
ability, 
to 
the 
experiments 
which 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
make, 
and 
also 
by 
informing 
the 
public 
of 
all 
they 
might 
discover, 
so 
that, 
by 
the 
last 
beginning 
where 
those 
before 
them 
had 
left 
off, 
and 
thus 
connecting 
the 
lives 
and 
labours 
of 
many, 
we 
might 
collectively 
proceed 
much 
farther 
than 
each 
by 
himself 
could 
do. 


I 
remarked, 
moreover, 
with 
respect 
to 
experiments, 
that 
they 
become 
always 
more 
necessary 
the 
more 
one 
is 
advanced 
in 
knowledge; 
for, 
at 
the 
commencement, 
it 
is 
better 
to 
make 
use 
only 
of 
what 
is 
spontaneously 
presented 
to 
our 
senses, 
and 
of 
which 
we 
cannot 
remain 
ignorant, 
provided 
we 
bestow 
on 
it 
any 
reflection, 
however 
slight, 
than 
to 
concern 
ourselves 
about 
more 
uncommon 
and 
recondite 
phenomena: 
the 
reason 
of 
which 
is, 
that 
the 
more 
uncommon 
often 
only 
mislead 
us 
so 
long 
as 
the 
causes 
of 
the 
more 
ordinary 
are 
still 
unknown; 
and 
the 
circumstances 
upon 
which 
they 
depend 
are 
almost 
always 
so 
special 
and 
minute 
as 
to 
be 
highly 
difficult 
to 
detect. 
But 
in 
this 
I 
have 
adopted 
the 
following 
order: 
first, 
I 
have 
essayed 
to 
find 
in 
general 
the 
principles, 
or 
first 
causes 
of 
all 
that 
is 
or 
can 
be 
in 
the 
world, 
without 
taking 
into 
consideration 
for 
this 
end 
anything 
but 
God 
himself 
who 
has 
created 
it, 
and 
without 
educing 
them 
from 
any 
other 
source 
than 
from 
certain 
germs 
of 
truths 
naturally 
existing 
in 
our 
minds 
In 
the 
second 
place, 
I 
examined 
what 
were 
the 
first 
and 
most 
ordinary 
effects 
that 
could 
be 
deduced 
from 
these 
causes; 
and 
it 
appears 
to 
me 
that, 
in 
this 
way, 
I 
have 
found 
heavens, 
stars, 
an 
earth, 
and 
even 
on 
the 
earth 
water, 
air, 
fire, 
minerals, 
and 



some 
other 
things 
of 
this 
kind, 
which 
of 
all 
others 
are 
the 
most 
common 
and 
simple, 
and 
hence 
the 
easiest 
to 
know. 
Afterwards 
when 
I 
wished 
to 
descend 
to 
the 
more 
particular, 
so 
many 
diverse 
objects 
presented 
themselves 
to 
me, 
that 
I 
believed 
it 
to 
be 
impossible 
for 
the 
human 
mind 
to 
distinguish 
the 
forms 
or 
species 
of 
bodies 
that 
are 
upon 
the 
earth, 
from 
an 
infinity 
of 
others 
which 
might 
have 
been, 
if 
it 
had 
pleased 
God 
to 
place 
them 
there, 
or 
consequently 
to 
apply 
them 
to 
our 
use, 
unless 
we 
rise 
to 
causes 
through 
their 
effects, 
and 
avail 
ourselves 
of 
many 
particular 
experiments. 
Thereupon, 
turning 
over 
in 
my 
mind 
I 
the 
objects 
that 
had 
ever 
been 
presented 
to 
my 
senses 
I 
freely 
venture 
to 
state 
that 
I 
have 
never 
observed 
any 
which 
I 
could 
not 
satisfactorily 
explain 
by 
the 
principles 
had 
discovered. 
But 
it 
is 
necessary 
also 
to 
confess 
that 
the 
power 
of 
nature 
is 
so 
ample 
and 
vast, 
and 
these 
principles 
so 
simple 
and 
general, 
that 
I 
have 
hardly 
observed 
a 
single 
particular 
effect 
which 
I 
cannot 
at 
once 
recognize 
as 
capable 
of 
being 
deduced 
in 
man 
different 
modes 
from 
the 
principles, 
and 
that 
my 
greatest 
difficulty 
usually 
is 
to 
discover 
in 
which 
of 
these 
modes 
the 
effect 
is 
dependent 
upon 
them; 
for 
out 
of 
this 
difficulty 
cannot 
otherwise 
extricate 
myself 
than 
by 
again 
seeking 
certain 
experiments, 
which 
may 
be 
such 
that 
their 
result 
is 
not 
the 
same, 
if 
it 
is 
in 
the 
one 
of 
these 
modes 
at 
we 
must 
explain 
it, 
as 
it 
would 
be 
if 
it 
were 
to 
be 
explained 
in 
the 
other. 
As 
to 
what 
remains, 
I 
am 
now 
in 
a 
position 
to 
discern, 
as 
I 
think, 
with 
sufficient 
clearness 
what 
course 
must 
be 
taken 
to 
make 
the 
majority 
those 
experiments 
which 
may 
conduce 
to 
this 
end: 
but 
I 
perceive 
likewise 
that 
they 
are 
such 
and 
so 
numerous, 
that 
neither 
my 
hands 
nor 
my 
income, 
though 
it 
were 
a 
thousand 
times 
larger 
than 
it 
is, 
would 
be 
sufficient 
for 
them 
all; 
so 
that 
according 
as 
henceforward 
I 
shall 
have 
the 
means 
of 
making 
more 
or 
fewer 
experiments, 
I 
shall 
in 
the 
same 
proportion 
make 
greater 
or 
less 
progress 
in 
the 
knowledge 
of 
nature. 
This 
was 
what 
I 
had 
hoped 
to 
make 
known 
by 
the 
treatise 
I 
had 
written, 
and 
so 
clearly 
to 
exhibit 
the 
advantage 
that 
would 
thence 
accrue 
to 
the 
public, 
as 
to 
induce 
all 
who 
have 
the 
common 
good 
of 
man 
at 
heart, 
that 
is, 
all 
who 
are 
virtuous 
in 
truth, 
and 
not 
merely 
in 
appearance, 
or 
according 
to 
opinion, 
as 
well 
to 
communicate 
to 
me 
the 
experiments 
they 
had 
already 
made, 
as 
to 
assist 
me 
in 
those 
that 
remain 
to 
be 
made. 


But 
since 
that 
time 
other 
reasons 
have 
occurred 
to 
me, 
by 
which 
I 
have 



been 
led 
to 
change 
my 
opinion, 
and 
to 
think 
that 
I 
ought 
indeed 
to 
go 
on 
committing 
to 
writing 
all 
the 
results 
which 
I 
deemed 
of 
any 
moment, 
as 
soon 
as 
I 
should 
have 
tested 
their 
truth, 
and 
to 
bestow 
the 
same 
care 
upon 
them 
as 
I 
would 
have 
done 
had 
it 
been 
my 
design 
to 
publish 
them. 
This 
course 
commended 
itself 
to 
me, 
as 
well 
because 
I 
thus 
afforded 
myself 
more 
ample 
inducement 
to 
examine 
them 
thoroughly, 
for 
doubtless 
that 
is 
always 
more 
narrowly 
scrutinized 
which 
we 
believe 
will 
be 
read 
by 
many, 
than 
that 
which 
is 
written 
merely 
for 
our 
private 
use 
(and 
frequently 
what 
has 
seemed 
to 
me 
true 
when 
I 
first 
conceived 
it, 
has 
appeared 
false 
when 
I 
have 
set 
about 
committing 
it 
to 
writing), 
as 
because 
I 
thus 
lost 
no 
opportunity 
of 
advancing 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
public, 
as 
far 
as 
in 
me 
lay, 
and 
since 
thus 
likewise, 
if 
my 
writings 
possess 
any 
value, 
those 
into 
whose 
hands 
they 
may 
fall 
after 
my 
death 
may 
be 
able 
to 
put 
them 
to 
what 
use 
they 
deem 
proper. 
But 
I 
resolved 
by 
no 
means 
to 
consent 
to 
their 
publication 
during 
my 
lifetime, 
lest 
either 
the 
oppositions 
or 
the 
controversies 
to 
which 
they 
might 
give 
rise, 
or 
even 
the 
reputation, 
such 
as 
it 
might 
be, 
which 
they 
would 
acquire 
for 
me, 
should 
be 
any 
occasion 
of 
my 
losing 
the 
time 
that 
I 
had 
set 
apart 
for 
my 
own 
improvement. 
For 
though 
it 
be 
true 
that 
every 
one 
is 
bound 
to 
promote 
to 
the 
extent 
of 
his 
ability 
the 
good 
of 
others, 
and 
that 
to 
be 
useful 
to 
no 
one 
is 
really 
to 
be 
worthless, 
yet 
it 
is 
likewise 
true 
that 
our 
cares 
ought 
to 
extend 
beyond 
the 
present, 
and 
it 
is 
good 
to 
omit 
doing 
what 
might 
perhaps 
bring 
some 
profit 
to 
the 
living, 
when 
we 
have 
in 
view 
the 
accomplishment 
of 
other 
ends 
that 
will 
be 
of 
much 
greater 
advantage 
to 
posterity. 
And 
in 
truth, 
I 
am 
quite 
willing 
it 
should 
be 
known 
that 
the 
little 
I 
have 
hitherto 
learned 
is 
almost 
nothing 
in 
comparison 
with 
that 
of 
which 
I 
am 
ignorant, 
and 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
which 
I 
do 
not 
despair 
of 
being 
able 
to 
attain; 
for 
it 
is 
much 
the 
same 
with 
those 
who 
gradually 
discover 
truth 
in 
the 
sciences, 
as 
with 
those 
who 
when 
growing 
rich 
find 
less 
difficulty 
in 
making 
great 
acquisitions, 
than 
they 
formerly 
experienced 
when 
poor 
in 
making 
acquisitions 
of 
much 
smaller 
amount. 
Or 
they 
may 
be 
compared 
to 
the 
commanders 
of 
armies, 
whose 
forces 
usually 
increase 
in 
proportion 
to 
their 
victories, 
and 
who 
need 
greater 
prudence 
to 
keep 
together 
the 
residue 
of 
their 
troops 
after 
a 
defeat 
than 
after 
a 
victory 
to 
take 
towns 
and 
provinces. 
For 
he 
truly 
engages 
in 
battle 
who 
endeavors 
to 
surmount 
all 
the 
difficulties 
and 
errors 
which 
prevent 
him 
from 
reaching 
the 
knowledge 
of 
truth, 
and 
he 
is 
overcome 
in 
fight 
who 
admits 
a 
false 
opinion 
touching 
a 
matter 
of 
any 
generality 
and 
importance, 
and 
he 



requires 
thereafter 
much 
more 
skill 
to 
recover 
his 
former 
position 
than 
to 
make 
great 
advances 
when 
once 
in 
possession 
of 
thoroughly 
ascertained 
principles. 
As 
for 
myself, 
if 
I 
have 
succeeded 
in 
discovering 
any 
truths 
in 
the 
sciences 
(and 
I 
trust 
that 
what 
is 
contained 
in 
this 
volume 
I 
will 
show 
that 
I 
have 
found 
some), 
I 
can 
declare 
that 
they 
are 
but 
the 
consequences 
and 
results 
of 
five 
or 
six 
principal 
difficulties 
which 
I 
have 
surmounted, 
and 
my 
encounters 
with 
which 
I 
reckoned 
as 
battles 
in 
which 
victory 
declared 
for 
me. 
I 
will 
not 
hesitate 
even 
to 
avow 
my 
belief 
that 
nothing 
further 
is 
wanting 
to 
enable 
me 
fully 
to 
realize 
my 
designs 
than 
to 
gain 
two 
or 
three 
similar 
victories; 
and 
that 
I 
am 
not 
so 
far 
advanced 
in 
years 
but 
that, 
according 
to 
the 
ordinary 
course 
of 
nature, 
I 
may 
still 
have 
sufficient 
leisure 
for 
this 
end. 
But 
I 
conceive 
myself 
the 
more 
bound 
to 
husband 
the 
time 
that 
remains 
the 
greater 
my 
expectation 
of 
being 
able 
to 
employ 
it 
aright, 
and 
I 
should 
doubtless 
have 
much 
to 
rob 
me 
of 
it, 
were 
I 
to 
publish 
the 
principles 
of 
my 
physics: 
for 
although 
they 
are 
almost 
all 
so 
evident 
that 
to 
assent 
to 
them 
no 
more 
is 
needed 
than 
simply 
to 
understand 
them, 
and 
although 
there 
is 
not 
one 
of 
them 
of 
which 
I 
do 
not 
expect 
to 
be 
able 
to 
give 
demonstration, 
yet, 
as 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
they 
can 
be 
in 
accordance 
with 
all 
the 
diverse 
opinions 
of 
others, 
I 
foresee 
that 
I 
should 
frequently 
be 
turned 
aside 
from 
my 
grand 
design, 
on 
occasion 
of 
the 
opposition 
which 
they 
would 
be 
sure 
to 
awaken. 


It 
may 
be 
said, 
that 
these 
oppositions 
would 
be 
useful 
both 
in 
making 
me 
aware 
of 
my 
errors, 
and, 
if 
my 
speculations 
contain 
anything 
of 
value, 
in 
bringing 
others 
to 
a 
fuller 
understanding 
of 
it; 
and 
still 
farther, 
as 
many 
can 
see 
better 
than 
one, 
in 
leading 
others 
who 
are 
now 
beginning 
to 
avail 
themselves 
of 
my 
principles, 
to 
assist 
me 
in 
turn 
with 
their 
discoveries. 
But 
though 
I 
recognize 
my 
extreme 
liability 
to 
error, 
and 
scarce 
ever 
trust 
to 
the 
first 
thoughts 
which 
occur 
to 
me, 
yet-the 
experience 
I 
have 
had 
of 
possible 
objections 
to 
my 
views 
prevents 
me 
from 
anticipating 
any 
profit 
from 
them. 
For 
I 
have 
already 
had 
frequent 
proof 
of 
the 
judgments, 
as 
well 
of 
those 
I 
esteemed 
friends, 
as 
of 
some 
others 
to 
whom 
I 
thought 
I 
was 
an 
object 
of 
indifference, 
and 
even 
of 
some 
whose 
malignancy 
and 
envy 
would, 
I 
knew, 
determine 
them 
to 
endeavor 
to 
discover 
what 
partiality 
concealed 
from 
the 
eyes 
of 
my 
friends. 
But 
it 
has 
rarely 
happened 
that 
anything 
has 
been 
objected 
to 
me 
which 
I 
had 
myself 
altogether 
overlooked, 
unless 
it 
were 
something 
far 
removed 
from 
the 
subject: 
so 
that 
I 
have 
never 
met 
with 
a 



single 
critic 
of 
my 
opinions 
who 
did 
not 
appear 
to 
me 
either 
less 
rigorous 
or 
less 
equitable 
than 
myself. 
And 
further, 
I 
have 
never 
observed 
that 
any 
truth 
before 
unknown 
has 
been 
brought 
to 
light 
by 
the 
disputations 
that 
are 
practised 
in 
the 
schools; 
for 
while 
each 
strives 
for 
the 
victory, 
each 
is 
much 
more 
occupied 
in 
making 
the 
best 
of 
mere 
verisimilitude, 
than 
in 
weighing 
the 
reasons 
on 
both 
sides 
of 
the 
question; 
and 
those 
who 
have 
been 
long 
good 
advocates 
are 
not 
afterwards 
on 
that 
account 
the 
better 
judges. 


As 
for 
the 
advantage 
that 
others 
would 
derive 
from 
the 
communication 
of 
my 
thoughts, 
it 
could 
not 
be 
very 
great; 
because 
I 
have 
not 
yet 
so 
far 
prosecuted 
them 
as 
that 
much 
does 
not 
remain 
to 
be 
added 
before 
they 
can 
be 
applied 
to 
practice. 
And 
I 
think 
I 
may 
say 
without 
vanity, 
that 
if 
there 
is 
any 
one 
who 
can 
carry 
them 
out 
that 
length, 
it 
must 
be 
myself 
rather 
than 
another: 
not 
that 
there 
may 
not 
be 
in 
the 
world 
many 
minds 
incomparably 
superior 
to 
mine, 
but 
because 
one 
cannot 
so 
well 
seize 
a 
thing 
and 
make 
it 
one's 
own, 
when 
it 
has 
been 
learned 
from 
another, 
as 
when 
one 
has 
himself 
discovered 
it. 
And 
so 
true 
is 
this 
of 
the 
present 
subject 
that, 
though 
I 
have 
often 
explained 
some 
of 
my 
opinions 
to 
persons 
of 
much 
acuteness, 
who, 
whilst 
I 
was 
speaking, 
appeared 
to 
understand 
them 
very 
distinctly, 
yet, 
when 
they 
repeated 
them, 
I 
have 
observed 
that 
they 
almost 
always 
changed 
them 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
that 
I 
could 
no 
longer 
acknowledge 
them 
as 
mine. 
I 
am 
glad, 
by 
the 
way, 
to 
take 
this 
opportunity 
of 
requesting 
posterity 
never 
to 
believe 
on 
hearsay 
that 
anything 
has 
proceeded 
from 
me 
which 
has 
not 
been 
published 
by 
myself; 
and 
I 
am 
not 
at 
all 
astonished 
at 
the 
extravagances 
attributed 
to 
those 
ancient 
philosophers 
whose 
own 
writings 
we 
do 
not 
possess; 
whose 
thoughts, 
however, 
I 
do 
not 
on 
that 
account 
suppose 
to 
have 
been 
really 
absurd, 
seeing 
they 
were 
among 
the 
ablest 
men 
of 
their 
times, 
but 
only 
that 
these 
have 
been 
falsely 
represented 
to 
us. 
It 
is 
observable, 
accordingly, 
that 
scarcely 
in 
a 
single 
instance 
has 
any 
one 
of 
their 
disciples 
surpassed 
them; 
and 
I 
am 
quite 
sure 
that 
the 
most 
devoted 
of 
the 
present 
followers 
of 
Aristotle 
would 
think 
themselves 
happy 
if 
they 
had 
as 
much 
knowledge 
of 
nature 
as 
he 
possessed, 
were 
it 
even 
under 
the 
condition 
that 
they 
should 
never 
afterwards 
attain 
to 
higher. 
In 
this 
respect 
they 
are 
like 
the 
ivy 
which 
never 
strives 
to 
rise 
above 
the 
tree 
that 
sustains 
it, 
and 
which 
frequently 
even 
returns 
downwards 
when 
it 
has 
reached 
the 
top; 
for 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
they 
also 
sink, 
in 
other 
words, 
render 
themselves 
less 
wise 
than 
they 
would 
be 
if 
they 
gave 
up 
study, 



who, 
not 
contented 
with 
knowing 
all 
that 
is 
intelligibly 
explained 
in 
their 
author, 
desire 
in 
addition 
to 
find 
in 
him 
the 
solution 
of 
many 
difficulties 
of 
which 
he 
says 
not 
a 
word, 
and 
never 
perhaps 
so 
much 
as 
thought. 
Their 
fashion 
of 
philosophizing, 
however, 
is 
well 
suited 
to 
persons 
whose 
abilities 
fall 
below 
mediocrity; 
for 
the 
obscurity 
of 
the 
distinctions 
and 
principles 
of 
which 
they 
make 
use 
enables 
them 
to 
speak 
of 
all 
things 
with 
as 
much 
confidence 
as 
if 
they 
really 
knew 
them, 
and 
to 
defend 
all 
that 
they 
say 
on 
any 
subject 
against 
the 
most 
subtle 
and 
skillful, 
without 
its 
being 
possible 
for 
any 
one 
to 
convict 
them 
of 
error. 
In 
this 
they 
seem 
to 
me 
to 
be 
like 
a 
blind 
man, 
who, 
in 
order 
to 
fight 
on 
equal 
terms 
with 
a 
person 
that 
sees, 
should 
have 
made 
him 
descend 
to 
the 
bottom 
of 
an 
intensely 
dark 
cave: 
and 
I 
may 
say 
that 
such 
persons 
have 
an 
interest 
in 
my 
refraining 
from 
publishing 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
philosophy 
of 
which 
I 
make 
use; 
for, 
since 
these 
are 
of 
a 
kind 
the 
simplest 
and 
most 
evident, 
I 
should, 
by 
publishing 
them, 
do 
much 
the 
same 
as 
if 
I 
were 
to 
throw 
open 
the 
windows, 
and 
allow 
the 
light 
of 
day 
to 
enter 
the 
cave 
into 
which 
the 
combatants 
had 
descended. 
But 
even 
superior 
men 
have 
no 
reason 
for 
any 
great 
anxiety 
to 
know 
these 
principles, 
for 
if 
what 
they 
desire 
is 
to 
be 
able 
to 
speak 
of 
all 
things, 
and 
to 
acquire 
a 
reputation 
for 
learning, 
they 
will 
gain 
their 
end 
more 
easily 
by 
remaining 
satisfied 
with 
the 
appearance 
of 
truth, 
which 
can 
be 
found 
without 
much 
difficulty 
in 
all 
sorts 
of 
matters, 
than 
by 
seeking 
the 
truth 
itself 
which 
unfolds 
itself 
but 
slowly 
and 
that 
only 
in 
some 
departments, 
while 
it 
obliges 
us, 
when 
we 
have 
to 
speak 
of 
others, 
freely 
to 
confess 
our 
ignorance. 
If, 
however, 
they 
prefer 
the 
knowledge 
of 
some 
few 
truths 
to 
the 
vanity 
of 
appearing 
ignorant 
of 
none, 
as 
such 
knowledge 
is 
undoubtedly 
much 
to 
be 
preferred, 
and, 
if 
they 
choose 
to 
follow 
a 
course 
similar 
to 
mine, 
they 
do 
not 
require 
for 
this 
that 
I 
should 
say 
anything 
more 
than 
I 
have 
already 
said 
in 
this 
discourse. 
For 
if 
they 
are 
capable 
of 
making 
greater 
advancement 
than 
I 
have 
made, 
they 
will 
much 
more 
be 
able 
of 
themselves 
to 
discover 
all 
that 
I 
believe 
myself 
to 
have 
found; 
since 
as 
I 
have 
never 
examined 
aught 
except 
in 
order, 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
what 
yet 
remains 
to 
be 
discovered 
is 
in 
itself 
more 
difficult 
and 
recondite, 
than 
that 
which 
I 
have 
already 
been 
enabled 
to 
find, 
and 
the 
gratification 
would 
be 
much 
less 
in 
learning 
it 
from 
me 
than 
in 
discovering 
it 
for 
themselves. 
Besides 
this, 
the 
habit 
which 
they 
will 
acquire, 
by 
seeking 
first 
what 
is 
easy, 
and 
then 
passing 
onward 
slowly 
and 
step 
by 
step 
to 
the 
more 
difficult, 
will 
benefit 
them 
more 
than 
all 
my 
instructions. 
Thus, 
in 
my 
own 



case, 
I 
am 
persuaded 
that 
if 
I 
had 
been 
taught 
from 
my 
youth 
all 
the 
truths 
of 
which 
I 
have 
since 
sought 
out 
demonstrations, 
and 
had 
thus 
learned 
them 
without 
labour, 
I 
should 
never, 
perhaps, 
have 
known 
any 
beyond 
these; 
at 
least, 
I 
should 
never 
have 
acquired 
the 
habit 
and 
the 
facility 
which 
I 
think 
I 
possess 
in 
always 
discovering 
new 
truths 
in 
proportion 
as 
I 
give 
myself 
to 
the 
search. 
And, 
in 
a 
single 
word, 
if 
there 
is 
any 
work 
in 
the 
world 
which 
cannot 
be 
so 
well 
finished 
by 
another 
as 
by 
him 
who 
has 
commenced 
it, 
it 
is 
that 
at 
which 
I 
labour. 


It 
is 
true, 
indeed, 
as 
regards 
the 
experiments 
which 
may 
conduce 
to 
this 
end, 
that 
one 
man 
is 
not 
equal 
to 
the 
task 
of 
making 
them 
all; 
but 
yet 
he 
can 
advantageously 
avail 
himself, 
in 
this 
work, 
of 
no 
hands 
besides 
his 
own, 
unless 
those 
of 
artisans, 
or 
parties 
of 
the 
same 
kind, 
whom 
he 
could 
pay, 
and 
whom 
the 
hope 
of 
gain 
(a 
means 
of 
great 
efficacy) 
might 
stimulate 
to 
accuracy 
in 
the 
performance 
of 
what 
was 
prescribed 
to 
them. 
For 
as 
to 
those 
who, 
through 
curiosity 
or 
a 
desire 
of 
learning, 
of 
their 
own 
accord, 
perhaps, 
offer 
him 
their 
services, 
besides 
that 
in 
general 
their 
promises 
exceed 
their 
performance, 
and 
that 
they 
sketch 
out 
fine 
designs 
of 
which 
not 
one 
is 
ever 
realized, 
they 
will, 
without 
doubt, 
expect 
to 
be 
compensated 
for 
their 
trouble 
by 
the 
explication 
of 
some 
difficulties, 
or, 
at 
least, 
by 
compliments 
and 
useless 
speeches, 
in 
which 
he 
cannot 
spend 
any 
portion 
of 
his 
time 
without 
loss 
to 
himself. 
And 
as 
for 
the 
experiments 
that 
others 
have 
already 
made, 
even 
although 
these 
parties 
should 
be 
willing 
of 
themselves 
to 
communicate 
them 
to 
him 
(which 
is 
what 
those 
who 
esteem 
them 
secrets 
will 
never 
do), 
the 
experiments 
are, 
for 
the 
most 
part, 
accompanied 
with 
so 
many 
circumstances 
and 
superfluous 
elements, 
as 
to 
make 
it 
exceedingly 
difficult 
to 
disentangle 
the 
truth 
from 
its 
adjuncts--besides, 
he 
will 
find 
almost 
all 
of 
them 
so 
ill 
described, 
or 
even 
so 
false 
(because 
those 
who 
made 
them 
have 
wished 
to 
see 
in 
them 
only 
such 
facts 
as 
they 
deemed 
conformable 
to 
their 
principles), 
that, 
if 
in 
the 
entire 
number 
there 
should 
be 
some 
of 
a 
nature 
suited 
to 
his 
purpose, 
still 
their 
value 
could 
not 
compensate 
for 
the 
time 
what 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
make 
the 
selection. 
So 
that 
if 
there 
existed 
any 
one 
whom 
we 
assuredly 
knew 
to 
be 
capable 
of 
making 
discoveries 
of 
the 
highest 
kind, 
and 
of 
the 
greatest 
possible 
utility 
to 
the 
public; 
and 
if 
all 
other 
men 
were 
therefore 
eager 
by 
all 
means 
to 
assist 
him 
in 
successfully 
prosecuting 
his 
designs, 
I 
do 
not 
see 
that 
they 
could 
do 
aught 
else 
for 
him 
beyond 
contributing 
to 
defray 
the 
expenses 



of 
the 
experiments 
that 
might 
be 
necessary; 
and 
for 
the 
rest, 
prevent 
his 
being 
deprived 
of 
his 
leisure 
by 
the 
unseasonable 
interruptions 
of 
any 
one. 
But 
besides 
that 
I 
neither 
have 
so 
high 
an 
opinion 
of 
myself 
as 
to 
be 
willing 
to 
make 
promise 
of 
anything 
extraordinary, 
nor 
feed 
on 
imaginations 
so 
vain 
as 
to 
fancy 
that 
the 
public 
must 
be 
much 
interested 
in 
my 
designs; 
I 
do 
not, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
own 
a 
soul 
so 
mean 
as 
to 
be 
capable 
of 
accepting 
from 
any 
one 
a 
favor 
of 
which 
it 
could 
be 
supposed 
that 
I 
was 
unworthy. 


These 
considerations 
taken 
together 
were 
the 
reason 
why, 
for 
the 
last 
three 
years, 
I 
have 
been 
unwilling 
to 
publish 
the 
treatise 
I 
had 
on 
hand, 
and 
why 
I 
even 
resolved 
to 
give 
publicity 
during 
my 
life 
to 
no 
other 
that 
was 
so 
general, 
or 
by 
which 
the 
principles 
of 
my 
physics 
might 
be 
understood. 
But 
since 
then, 
two 
other 
reasons 
have 
come 
into 
operation 
that 
have 
determined 
me 
here 
to 
subjoin 
some 
particular 
specimens, 
and 
give 
the 
public 
some 
account 
of 
my 
doings 
and 
designs. 
Of 
these 
considerations, 
the 
first 
is, 
that 
if 
I 
failed 
to 
do 
so, 
many 
who 
were 
cognizant 
of 
my 
previous 
intention 
to 
publish 
some 
writings, 
might 
have 
imagined 
that 
the 
reasons 
which 
induced 
me 
to 
refrain 
from 
so 
doing, 
were 
less 
to 
my 
credit 
than 
they 
really 
are; 
for 
although 
I 
am 
not 
immoderately 
desirous 
of 
glory, 
or 
even, 
if 
I 
may 
venture 
so 
to 
say, 
although 
I 
am 
averse 
from 
it 
in 
so 
far 
as 
I 
deem 
it 
hostile 
to 
repose 
which 
I 
hold 
in 
greater 
account 
than 
aught 
else, 
yet, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
I 
have 
never 
sought 
to 
conceal 
my 
actions 
as 
if 
they 
were 
crimes, 
nor 
made 
use 
of 
many 
precautions 
that 
I 
might 
remain 
unknown; 
and 
this 
partly 
because 
I 
should 
have 
thought 
such 
a 
course 
of 
conduct 
a 
wrong 
against 
myself, 
and 
partly 
because 
it 
would 
have 
occasioned 
me 
some 
sort 
of 
uneasiness 
which 
would 
again 
have 
been 
contrary 
to 
the 
perfect 
mental 
tranquillity 
which 
I 
court. 
And 
forasmuch 
as, 
while 
thus 
indifferent 
to 
the 
thought 
alike 
of 
fame 
or 
of 
forgetfulness, 
I 
have 
yet 
been 
unable 
to 
prevent 
myself 
from 
acquiring 
some 
sort 
of 
reputation, 
I 
have 
thought 
it 
incumbent 
on 
me 
to 
do 
my 
best 
to 
save 
myself 
at 
least 
from 
being 
ill-spoken 
of. 
The 
other 
reason 
that 
has 
determined 
me 
to 
commit 
to 
writing 
these 
specimens 
of 
philosophy 
is, 
that 
I 
am 
becoming 
daily 
more 
and 
more 
alive 
to 
the 
delay 
which 
my 
design 
of 
self-instruction 
suffers, 
for 
want 
of 
the 
infinity 
of 
experiments 
I 
require, 
and 
which 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
me 
to 
make 
without 
the 
assistance 
of 
others: 
and, 
without 
flattering 
myself 
so 
much 
as 
to 
expect 
the 
public 
to 
take 
a 
large 
share 
in 
my 
interests, 
I 
am 
yet 
unwilling 
to 
be 
found 
so 
far 
wanting 
in 
the 
duty 
I 



owe 
to 
myself, 
as 
to 
give 
occasion 
to 
those 
who 
shall 
survive 
me 
to 
make 
it 
matter 
of 
reproach 
against 
me 
some 
day, 
that 
I 
might 
have 
left 
them 
many 
things 
in 
a 
much 
more 
perfect 
state 
than 
I 
have 
done, 
had 
I 
not 
too 
much 
neglected 
to 
make 
them 
aware 
of 
the 
ways 
in 
which 
they 
could 
have 
promoted 
the 
accomplishment 
of 
my 
designs. 


And 
I 
thought 
that 
it 
was 
easy 
for 
me 
to 
select 
some 
matters 
which 
should 
neither 
be 
obnoxious 
to 
much 
controversy, 
nor 
should 
compel 
me 
to 
expound 
more 
of 
my 
principles 
than 
I 
desired, 
and 
which 
should 
yet 
be 
sufficient 
clearly 
to 
exhibit 
what 
I 
can 
or 
cannot 
accomplish 
in 
the 
sciences. 
Whether 
or 
not 
I 
have 
succeeded 
in 
this 
it 
is 
not 
for 
me 
to 
say; 
and 
I 
do 
not 
wish 
to 
forestall 
the 
judgments 
of 
others 
by 
speaking 
myself 
of 
my 
writings; 
but 
it 
will 
gratify 
me 
if 
they 
be 
examined, 
and, 
to 
afford 
the 
greater 
inducement 
to 
this 
I 
request 
all 
who 
may 
have 
any 
objections 
to 
make 
to 
them, 
to 
take 
the 
trouble 
of 
forwarding 
these 
to 
my 
publisher, 
who 
will 
give 
me 
notice 
of 
them, 
that 
I 
may 
endeavor 
to 
subjoin 
at 
the 
same 
time 
my 
reply; 
and 
in 
this 
way 
readers 
seeing 
both 
at 
once 
will 
more 
easily 
determine 
where 
the 
truth 
lies; 
for 
I 
do 
not 
engage 
in 
any 
case 
to 
make 
prolix 
replies, 
but 
only 
with 
perfect 
frankness 
to 
avow 
my 
errors 
if 
I 
am 
convinced 
of 
them, 
or 
if 
I 
cannot 
perceive 
them, 
simply 
to 
state 
what 
I 
think 
is 
required 
for 
defense 
of 
the 
matters 
I 
have 
written, 
adding 
thereto 
no 
explication 
of 
any 
new 
matte 
that 
it 
may 
not 
be 
necessary 
to 
pass 
without 
end 
from 
one 
thing 
to 
another. 


If 
some 
of 
the 
matters 
of 
which 
I 
have 
spoken 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
"Dioptrics" 
and 
"Meteorics" 
should 
offend 
at 
first 
sight, 
because 
I 
call 
them 
hypotheses 
and 
seem 
indifferent 
about 
giving 
proof 
of 
them, 
I 
request 
a 
patient 
and 
attentive 
reading 
of 
the 
whole, 
from 
which 
I 
hope 
those 
hesitating 
will 
derive 
satisfaction; 
for 
it 
appears 
to 
me 
that 
the 
reasonings 
are 
so 
mutually 
connected 
in 
these 
treatises, 
that, 
as 
the 
last 
are 
demonstrated 
by 
the 
first 
which 
are 
their 
causes, 
the 
first 
are 
in 
their 
turn 
demonstrated 
by 
the 
last 
which 
are 
their 
effects. 
Nor 
must 
it 
be 
imagined 
that 
I 
here 
commit 
the 
fallacy 
which 
the 
logicians 
call 
a 
circle; 
for 
since 
experience 
renders 
the 
majority 
of 
these 
effects 
most 
certain, 
the 
causes 
from 
which 
I 
deduce 
them 
do 
not 
serve 
so 
much 
to 
establish 
their 
reality 
as 
to 
explain 
their 
existence; 
but 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
causes 
is 
established 
by 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
effects. 
Nor 
have 
I 
called 
them 
hypotheses 
with 
any 
other 
end 
in 
view 
except 
that 
it 



may 
be 
known 
that 
I 
think 
I 
am 
able 
to 
deduce 
them 
from 
those 
first 
truths 
which 
I 
have 
already 
expounded; 
and 
yet 
that 
I 
have 
expressly 
determined 
not 
to 
do 
so, 
to 
prevent 
a 
certain 
class 
of 
minds 
from 
thence 
taking 
occasion 
to 
build 
some 
extravagant 
philosophy 
upon 
what 
they 
may 
take 
to 
be 
my 
principles, 
and 
my 
being 
blamed 
for 
it. 
I 
refer 
to 
those 
who 
imagine 
that 
they 
can 
master 
in 
a 
day 
all 
that 
another 
has 
taken 
twenty 
years 
to 
think 
out, 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
has 
spoken 
two 
or 
three 
words 
to 
them 
on 
the 
subject; 
or 
who 
are 
the 
more 
liable 
to 
error 
and 
the 
less 
capable 
of 
perceiving 
truth 
in 
very 
proportion 
as 
they 
are 
more 
subtle 
and 
lively. 
As 
to 
the 
opinions 
which 
are 
truly 
and 
wholly 
mine, 
I 
offer 
no 
apology 
for 
them 
as 
new,--persuaded 
as 
I 
am 
that 
if 
their 
reasons 
be 
well 
considered 
they 
will 
be 
found 
to 
be 
so 
simple 
and 
so 
conformed, 
to 
common 
sense 
as 
to 
appear 
less 
extraordinary 
and 
less 
paradoxical 
than 
any 
others 
which 
can 
be 
held 
on 
the 
same 
subjects; 
nor 
do 
I 
even 
boast 
of 
being 
the 
earliest 
discoverer 
of 
any 
of 
them, 
but 
only 
of 
having 
adopted 
them, 
neither 
because 
they 
had 
nor 
because 
they 
had 
not 
been 
held 
by 
others, 
but 
solely 
because 
reason 
has 
convinced 
me 
of 
their 
truth. 


Though 
artisans 
may 
not 
be 
able 
at 
once 
to 
execute 
the 
invention 
which 
is 
explained 
in 
the 
"Dioptrics," 
I 
do 
not 
think 
that 
any 
one 
on 
that 
account 
is 
entitled 
to 
condemn 
it; 
for 
since 
address 
and 
practice 
are 
required 
in 
order 
so 
to 
make 
and 
adjust 
the 
machines 
described 
by 
me 
as 
not 
to 
overlook 
the 
smallest 
particular, 
I 
should 
not 
be 
less 
astonished 
if 
they 
succeeded 
on 
the 
first 
attempt 
than 
if 
a 
person 
were 
in 
one 
day 
to 
become 
an 
accomplished 
performer 
on 
the 
guitar, 
by 
merely 
having 
excellent 
sheets 
of 
music 
set 
up 
before 
him. 
And 
if 
I 
write 
in 
French, 
which 
is 
the 
language 
of 
my 
country, 
in 
preference 
to 
Latin, 
which 
is 
that 
of 
my 
preceptors, 
it 
is 
because 
I 
expect 
that 
those 
who 
make 
use 
of 
their 
unprejudiced 
natural 
reason 
will 
be 
better 
judges 
of 
my 
opinions 
than 
those 
who 
give 
heed 
to 
the 
writings 
of 
the 
ancients 
only; 
and 
as 
for 
those 
who 
unite 
good 
sense 
with 
habits 
of 
study, 
whom 
alone 
I 
desire 
for 
judges, 
they 
will 
not, 
I 
feel 
assured, 
be 
so 
partial 
to 
Latin 
as 
to 
refuse 
to 
listen 
to 
my 
reasonings 
merely 
because 
I 
expound 
them 
in 
the 
vulgar 
tongue. 


In 
conclusion, 
I 
am 
unwilling 
here 
to 
say 
anything 
very 
specific 
of 
the 
progress 
which 
I 
expect 
to 
make 
for 
the 
future 
in 
the 
sciences, 
or 
to 
bind 
myself 
to 
the 
public 
by 
any 
promise 
which 
I 
am 
not 
certain 
of 
being 
able 
to 



fulfill; 
but 
this 
only 
will 
I 
say, 
that 
I 
have 
resolved 
to 
devote 
what 
time 
I 
may 
still 
have 
to 
live 
to 
no 
other 
occupation 
than 
that 
of 
endeavoring 
to 
acquire 
some 
knowledge 
of 
Nature, 
which 
shall 
be 
of 
such 
a 
kind 
as 
to 
enable 
us 
therefrom 
to 
deduce 
rules 
in 
medicine 
of 
greater 
certainty 
than 
those 
at 
present 
in 
use; 
and 
that 
my 
inclination 
is 
so 
much 
opposed 
to 
all 
other 
pursuits, 
especially 
to 
such 
as 
cannot 
be 
useful 
to 
some 
without 
being 
hurtful 
to 
others, 
that 
if, 
by 
any 
circumstances, 
I 
had 
been 
constrained 
to 
engage 
in 
such, 
I 
do 
not 
believe 
that 
I 
should 
have 
been 
able 
to 
succeed. 
Of 
this 
I 
here 
make 
a 
public 
declaration, 
though 
well 
aware 
that 
it 
cannot 
serve 
to 
procure 
for 
me 
any 
consideration 
in 
the 
world, 
which, 
however, 
I 
do 
not 
in 
the 
least 
affect; 
and 
I 
shall 
always 
hold 
myself 
more 
obliged 
to 
those 
through 
whose 
favor 
I 
am 
permitted 
to 
enjoy 
my 
retirement 
without 
interruption 
than 
to 
any 
who 
might 
offer 
me 
the 
highest 
earthly 
preferments.

OF 
LOGIC 
AND 
RHETORIC 
IN

From 
the 
Publisher's 
Preface. 


The 
present 
volume 
contains 
a 
reprint 
of 
the 
preface 
and 
the 
first 
part 
of 
the 
Principles 
of 
Philosophy, 
together 
with 
selections 
from 
the 
second, 
third 
and 
fourth 
parts 
of 
that 
work, 
corresponding 
to 
the 
extracts 
in 
the 
French 
edition 
of 
Gamier, 
are 
also 
given, 
as 
well 
as 
an 
appendix 
containing 
part 
of 
Descartes' 
reply 
to 
the 
Second 
Objections 
(viz., 
his 
formal 
demonstrations 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
Deity). 
The 
translation 
is 
based 
on 
the 
original 
Latin 
edition 
of 
the 
Principles, 
published 
in 
1644. 


The 
work 
had 
been 
translated 
into 
French 
during 
Descartes' 
lifetime, 
and 
personally 
revised 
and 
corrected 
by 
him, 
the 
French 
text 
is 
evidently 
deserving 
of 
the 
same 
consideration 
as 
the 
Latin 
originals, 
and 
consequently, 
the 
additions 
and 
variations 
of 
the 
French 
version 
have 
also 
been 
given—the 
additions 
being

SELECTIONS 
FROM 
THE 
PRINCIPLES 
OF 
PHILOSOPHY 


OF 
DESCARTES 


TRANSLATED 
FROM 
THE 
LATIN 
AND 
COLLATED 
WITH 
THE 
FRENCH 


LETTER 
OF 
THE 
AUTHOR 


TO 
THE 
FRENCH 
TRANSLATOR 
OF 
THE 
PRINCIPLES 
OF 
PHILOSOPHY 
SERVING 
FOR 
A 
PREFACE. 


Sir,—The 
version 
of 
my 
principles 
which 
you 
have 
been 
at 
pains 
to 
make, 
is 
so 
elegant 
and 
finished 
as 
to 
lead 
me 
to 
expect 
that 
the 
work 
will 
be 
more 
generally 
read 
in 
French 
than 
in 
Latin, 
and 
better 
understood. 
The 
only 
apprehension 
I 
entertain 
is 
lest 
the 
title 
should 
deter 
some 
who 
have 
not 
been 
brought 
up 
to 
letters, 
or 
with 
whom 
philosophy 
is 
in 
bad 
repute, 
because 
the 
kind 
they 
were 
taught 
has 
proved 
unsatisfactory; 
and 
this 
makes 
me 
think 
that 
it 
will 
be 
useful 
to 
add 
a 
preface 
to 
it 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
showing 
what 
the 
MATTER 
of 
the 
work 
is, 
what 
END 
I 
had 
in 
view 
in 
writing 
it, 
and 
what 
UTILITY 
may 
be 
derived 
from 
it. 
But 
although 
it 
might 
be 
my 
part 
to 
write 
a 
preface 
of 
this 
nature, 
seeing 
I 
ought 
to 
know 
those 
particulars 
better 
than 
any 
other 
person, 
I 
cannot 
nevertheless 
prevail 
upon 
myself 
to 
do 
anything 
more 
than 
merely 
to 
give 
a 
summary 
of 
the 
chief 
points 
that 
fall, 
as 
I 
think, 
to 
be 
discussed 
in 
it: 
and 
I 
leave 
it 
to 
your 
discretion 
to 
present 
to 
the 
public 
such 
part 
of 
them 
as 
you 
shall 
judge 
proper. 


I 
should 
have 
desired, 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
to 
explain 
in 
it 
what 
philosophy 
is, 
by 
commencing 
with 
the 
most 
common 
matters, 
as, 
for 
example, 
that 
the 
word 
PHILOSOPHY 
signifies 
the 
study 
of 
wisdom, 
and 
that 
by 
wisdom 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
not 
merely 
prudence 
in 
the 
management 
of 
affairs, 
but 
a 
perfect 
knowledge 
of 
all 
that 
man 
can 
know, 
as 
well 
for 
the 
conduct 
of 
his 
life 
as 
for 
the 
preservation 
of 
his 
health 
and 
the 
discovery 
of 
all 
the 
arts, 
and 
that 



knowledge 
to 
subserve 
these 
ends 
must 
necessarily 
be 
deduced 
from 
first 
causes; 
so 
that 
in 
order 
to 
study 
the 
acquisition 
of 
it 
(which 
is 
properly 
called 
philosophizing), 
we 
must 
commence 
with 
the 
investigation 
of 
those 
first 
causes 
which 
are 
called 
PRINCIPLES. 
Now 
these 
principles 
must 
possess 
TWO 
CONDITIONS: 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
they 
must 
be 
so 
clear 
and 
evident 
that 
the 
human 
mind, 
when 
it 
attentively 
considers 
them, 
cannot 
doubt 
of 
their 
truth; 
in 
the 
second 
place, 
the 
knowledge 
of 
other 
things 
must 
be 
so 
dependent 
on 
them 
as 
that 
though 
the 
principles 
themselves 
may 
indeed 
be 
known 
apart 
from 
what 
depends 
on 
them, 
the 
latter 
cannot 
nevertheless 
be 
known 
apart 
from 
the 
former. 
It 
will 
accordingly 
be 
necessary 
thereafter 
to 
endeavour 
so 
to 
deduce 
from 
those 
principles 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
things 
that 
depend 
on 
them, 
as 
that 
there 
may 
be 
nothing 
in 
the 
whole 
series 
of 
deductions 
which 
is 
not 
perfectly 
manifest. 
God 
is 
in 
truth 
the 
only 
being 
who 
is 
absolutely 
wise, 
that 
is, 
who 
possesses 
a 
perfect 
knowledge 
of 
all 
things; 
but 
we 
may 
say 
that 
men 
are 
more 
or 
less 
wise 
as 
their 
knowledge 
of 
the 
most 
important 
truths 
is 
greater 
or 
less. 
And 
I 
am 
confident 
that 
there 
is 
nothing, 
in 
what 
I 
have 
now 
said, 
in 
which 
all 
the 
learned 
do 
not 
concur. 


I 
should, 
in 
the 
next 
place, 
have 
proposed 
to 
consider 
the 
utility 
of 
philosophy, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
have 
shown 
that, 
since 
it 
embraces 
all 
that 
the 
human 
mind 
can 
know, 
we 
ought 
to 
believe 
that 
it 
is 
by 
it 
we 
are 
distinguished 
from 
savages 
and 
barbarians, 
and 
that 
the 
civilisation 
and 
culture 
of 
a 
nation 
is 
regulated 
by 
the 
degree 
in 
which 
true 
philosophy 
nourishes 
in 
it, 
and, 
accordingly, 
that 
to 
contain 
true 
philosophers 
is 
the 
highest 
privilege 
a 
state 
can 
enjoy. 
Besides 
this, 
I 
should 
have 
shown 
that, 
as 
regards 
individuals, 
it 
is 
not 
only 
useful 
for 
each 
man 
to 
have 
intercourse 
with 
those 
who 
apply 
themselves 
to 
this 
study, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
incomparably 
better 
he 
should 
himself 
direct 
his 
attention 
to 
it; 
just 
as 
it 
is 
doubtless 
to 
be 
preferred 
that 
a 
man 
should 
make 
use 
of 
his 
own 
eyes 
to 
direct 
his 
steps, 
and 
enjoy 
by 
means 
of 
the 
same 
the 
beauties 
of 
colour 
and 
light, 
than 
that 
he 
should 
blindly 
follow 
the 
guidance 
of 
another; 
though 
the 
latter 
course 
is 
certainly 
better 
than 
to 
have 
the 
eyes 
closed 
with 
no 
guide 
except 
one's 
self. 
But 
to 
live 
without 
philosophizing 
is 
in 
truth 
the 
same 
as 
keeping 
the 
eyes 
closed 
without 
attempting 
to 
open 
them; 
and 
the 
pleasure 
of 
seeing 
all 
that 
sight 
discloses 
is 
not 
to 
be 
compared 
with 
the 
satisfaction 
afforded 
by 
the 
discoveries 
of 
philosophy. 
And, 
finally, 
this 
study 
is 
more 
imperatively 



requisite 
for 
the 
regulation 
of 
our 
manners, 
and 
for 
conducting 
us 
through 
life, 
than 
is 
the 
use 
of 
our 
eyes 
for 
directing 
our 
steps. 
The 
brutes, 
which 
have 
only 
their 
bodies 
to 
conserve, 
are 
continually 
occupied 
in 
seeking 
sources 
of 
nourishment; 
but 
men, 
of 
whom 
the 
chief 
part 
is 
the 
mind, 
ought 
to 
make 
the 
search 
after 
wisdom 
their 
principal 
care, 
for 
wisdom 
is 
the 
true 
nourishment 
of 
the 
mind; 
and 
I 
feel 
assured, 
moreover, 
that 
there 
are 
very 
many 
who 
would 
not 
fail 
in 
the 
search, 
if 
they 
would 
but 
hope 
for 
success 
in 
it, 
and 
knew 
the 
degree 
of 
their 
capabilities 
for 
it. 
There 
is 
no 
mind, 
how 
ignoble 
soever 
it 
be, 
which 
remains 
so 
firmly 
bound 
up 
in 
the 
objects 
of 
the 
senses, 
as 
not 
sometime 
or 
other 
to 
turn 
itself 
away 
from 
them 
in 
the 
aspiration 
after 
some 
higher 
good, 
although 
not 
knowing 
frequently 
wherein 
that 
good 
consists. 
The 
greatest 
favourites 
of 
fortune—those 
who 
have 
health, 
honours, 
and 
riches 
in 
abundance— 
are 
not 
more 
exempt 
from 
aspirations 
of 
this 
nature 
than 
others; 
nay, 
I 
am 
persuaded 
that 
these 
are 
the 
persons 
who 
sigh 
the 
most 
deeply 
after 
another 
good 
greater 
and 
more 
perfect 
still 
than 
any 
they 
already 
possess. 
But 
the 
supreme 
good, 
considered 
by 
natural 
reason 
without 
the 
light 
of 
faith, 
is 
nothing 
more 
than 
the 
knowledge 
of 
truth 
through 
its 
first 
causes, 
in 
other 
words, 
the 
wisdom 
of 
which 
philosophy 
is 
the 
study. 
And, 
as 
all 
these 
particulars 
are 
indisputably 
true, 
all 
that 
is 
required 
to 
gain 
assent 
to 
their 
truth 
is 
that 
they 
be 
well 
stated. 


But 
as 
one 
is 
restrained 
from 
assenting 
to 
these 
doctrines 
by 
experience, 
which 
shows 
that 
they 
who 
make 
pretensions 
to 
philosophy 
are 
often 
less 
wise 
and 
reasonable 
than 
others 
who 
never 
applied 
themselves 
to 
the 
study, 
I 
should 
have 
here 
shortly 
explained 
wherein 
consists 
all 
the 
science 
we 
now 
possess, 
and 
what 
are 
the 
degrees 
of 
wisdom 
at 
which 
we 
have 
arrived. 
The 
first 
degree 
contains 
only 
notions 
so 
clear 
of 
themselves 
that 
they 
can 
be 
acquired 
without 
meditation; 
the 
second 
comprehends 
all 
that 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
senses 
dictates; 
the 
third, 
that 
which 
the 
conversation 
of 
other 
men 
teaches 
us; 
to 
which 
may 
be 
added 
as 
the 
fourth, 
the 
reading, 
not 
of 
all 
books, 
but 
especially 
of 
such 
as 
have 
been 
written 
by 
persons 
capable 
of 
conveying 
proper 
instruction, 
for 
it 
is 
a 
species 
of 
conversation 
we 
hold 
with 
their 
authors. 
And 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
all 
the 
wisdom 
we 
in 
ordinary 
possess 
is 
acquired 
only 
in 
these 
four 
ways; 
for 
I 
do 
not 
class 
divine 
revelation 
among 
them, 
because 
it 
does 
not 
conduct 
us 
by 
degrees, 
but 
elevates 
us 
at 
once 
to 
an 
infallible 
faith. 



There 
have 
been, 
indeed, 
in 
all 
ages 
great 
minds 
who 
endeavoured 
to 
find 
a 
fifth 
road 
to 
wisdom, 
incomparably 
more 
sure 
and 
elevated 
than 
the 
other 
four. 
The 
path 
they 
essayed 
was 
the 
search 
of 
first 
causes 
and 
true 
principles, 
from 
which 
might 
be 
deduced 
the 
reasons 
of 
all 
that 
can 
be 
known 
by 
man; 
and 
it 
is 
to 
them 
the 
appellation 
of 
philosophers 
has 
been 
more 
especially 
accorded. 
I 
am 
not 
aware 
that 
there 
is 
any 
one 
of 
them 
up 
to 
the 
present 
who 
has 
succeeded 
in 
this 
enterprise. 
The 
first 
and 
chief 
whose 
writings 
we 
possess 
are 
Plato 
and 
Aristotle, 
between 
whom 
there 
was 
no 
difference, 
except 
that 
the 
former, 
following 
in 
the 
footsteps 
of 
his 
master, 
Socrates, 
ingenuously 
confessed 
that 
he 
had 
never 
yet 
been 
able 
to 
find 
anything 
certain, 
and 
that 
he 
was 
contented 
to 
write 
what 
seemed 
to 
him 
probable, 
imagining, 
for 
this 
end, 
certain 
principles 
by 
which 
he 
endeavoured 
to 
account 
for 
the 
other 
things. 
Aristotle, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
characterised 
by 
less 
candour, 
although 
for 
twenty 
years 
the 
disciple 
of 
Plato, 
and 
with 
no 
principles 
beyond 
those 
of 
his 
master, 
completely 
reversed 
his 
mode 
of 
putting 
them, 
and 
proposed 
as 
true 
and 
certain 
what 
it 
is 
probable 
he 
himself 
never 
esteemed 
as 
such. 
But 
these 
two 
men 
had 
acquired 
much 
judgment 
and 
wisdom 
by 
the 
four 
preceding 
means, 
qualities 
which 
raised 
their 
authority 
very 
high, 
so 
much 
so 
that 
those 
who 
succeeded 
them 
were 
willing 
rather 
to 
acquiesce 
in 
their 
opinions, 
than 
to 
seek 
better 
for 
themselves. 
The 
chief 
question 
among 
their 
disciples, 
however, 
was 
as 
to 
whether 
we 
ought 
to 
doubt 
of 
all 
things 
or 
hold 
some 
as 
certain,—a 
dispute 
which 
led 
them 
on 
both 
sides 
into 
extravagant 
errors; 
for 
a 
part 
of 
those 
who 
were 
for 
doubt, 
extended 
it 
even 
to 
the 
actions 
of 
life, 
to 
the 
neglect 
of 
the 
most 
ordinary 
rules 
required 
for 
its 
conduct; 
those, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
who 
maintained 
the 
doctrine 
of 
certainty, 
supposing 
that 
it 
must 
depend 
upon 
the 
senses, 
trusted 
entirely 
to 
them. 
To 
such 
an 
extent 
was 
this 
carried 
by 
Epicurus, 
that 
it 
is 
said 
he 
ventured 
to 
affirm, 
contrary 
to 
all 
the 
reasonings 
of 
the 
astronomers, 
that 
the 
sun 
is 
no 
larger 
than 
it 
appears. 


It 
is 
a 
fault 
we 
may 
remark 
in 
most 
disputes, 
that, 
as 
truth 
is 
the 
mean 
between 
the 
two 
opinions 
that 
are 
upheld, 
each 
disputant 
departs 
from 
it 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
degree 
in 
which 
he 
possesses 
the 
spirit 
of 
contradiction. 
But 
the 
error 
of 
those 
who 
leant 
too 
much 
to 
the 
side 
of 
doubt, 
was 
not 
followed 
for 
any 
length 
of 
time, 
and 
that 
of 
the 
opposite 
party 
has 
been 
to 
some 
extent 
corrected 
by 
the 
doctrine 
that 
the 
senses 
are 
deceitful 
in 
many 
instances. 



Nevertheless, 
I 
do 
not 
know 
that 
this 
error 
was 
wholly 
removed 
by 
showing 
that 
certitude 
is 
not 
in 
the 
senses, 
but 
in 
the 
understanding 
alone 
when 
it 
has 
clear 
perceptions; 
and 
that 
while 
we 
only 
possess 
the 
knowledge 
which 
is 
acquired 
in 
the 
first 
four 
grades 
of 
wisdom, 
we 
ought 
not 
to 
doubt 
of 
the 
things 
that 
appear 
to 
be 
true 
in 
what 
regards 
the 
conduct 
of 
life, 
nor 
esteem 
them 
as 
so 
certain 
that 
we 
cannot 
change 
our 
opinions 
regarding 
them, 
even 
though 
constrained 
by 
the 
evidence 
of 
reason. 


From 
ignorance 
of 
this 
truth, 
or, 
if 
there 
was 
any 
one 
to 
whom 
it 
was 
known, 
from 
neglect 
of 
it, 
the 
majority 
of 
those 
who 
in 
these 
later 
ages 
aspired 
to 
be 
philosophers, 
blindly 
followed 
Aristotle, 
so 
that 
they 
frequently 
corrupted 
the 
sense 
of 
his 
writings, 
and 
attributed 
to 
him 
various 
opinions 
which 
he 
would 
not 
recognise 
as 
his 
own 
were 
he 
now 
to 
return 
to 
the 
world; 
and 
those 
who 
did 
not 
follow 
him, 
among 
whom 
are 
to 
be 
found 
many 
of 
the 
greatest 
minds, 
did 
yet 
not 
escape 
being 
imbued 
with 
his 
opinions 
in 
their 
youth, 
as 
these 
form 
the 
staple 
of 
instruction 
in 
the 
schools; 
and 
thus 
their 
minds 
were 
so 
preoccupied 
that 
they 
could 
not 
rise 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
true 
principles. 
And 
though 
I 
hold 
all 
the 
philosophers 
in 
esteem, 
and 
am 
unwilling 
to 
incur 
odium 
by 
my 
censure, 
I 
can 
adduce 
a 
proof 
of 
my 
assertion, 
which 
I 
do 
not 
think 
any 
of 
them 
will 
gainsay, 
which 
is, 
that 
they 
all 
laid 
down 
as 
a 
principle 
what 
they 
did 
not 
perfectly 
know. 
For 
example, 
I 
know 
none 
of 
them 
who 
did 
not 
suppose 
that 
there 
was 
gravity 
in 
terrestrial 
bodies; 
but 
although 
experience 
shows 
us 
very 
clearly 
that 
bodies 
we 
call 
heavy 
descend 
towards 
the 
center 
of 
the 
earth, 
we 
do 
not, 
therefore, 
know 
the 
nature 
of 
gravity, 
that 
is, 
the 
cause 
or 
principle 
in 
virtue 
of 
which 
bodies 
descend, 
and 
we 
must 
derive 
our 
knowledge 
of 
it 
from 
some 
other 
source. 
The 
same 
may 
be 
said 
of 
a 
vacuum 
and 
atoms, 
of 
heat 
and 
cold, 
of 
dryness 
and 
humidity, 
and 
of 
salt, 
sulphur, 
and 
mercury, 
and 
the 
other 
things 
of 
this 
sort 
which 
some 
have 
adopted 
as 
their 
principles. 
But 
no 
conclusion 
deduced 
from 
a 
principle 
which 
is 
not 
clear 
can 
be 
evident, 
even 
although 
the 
deduction 
be 
formally 
valid; 
and 
hence 
it 
follows 
that 
no 
reasonings 
based 
on 
such 
principles 
could 
lead 
them 
to 
the 
certain 
knowledge 
of 
any 
one 
thing, 
nor 
consequently 
advance 
them 
one 
step 
in 
the 
search 
after 
wisdom. 
And 
if 
they 
did 
discover 
any 
truth, 
this 
was 
due 
to 
one 
or 
other 
of 
the 
four 
means 
above 
mentioned. 
Notwithstanding 
this, 
I 
am 
in 
no 
degree 
desirous 
to 
lessen 
the 
honour 
which 
each 
of 
them 
can 
justly 
claim; 
I 
am 
only 
constrained 
to 
say, 
for 
the 
consolation 
of 
those 
who 



have 
not 
given 
their 
attention 
to 
study, 
that 
just 
as 
in 
travelling, 
when 
we 
turn 
our 
back 
upon 
the 
place 
to 
which 
we 
were 
going, 
we 
recede 
the 
farther 
from 
it 
in 
proportion 
as 
we 
proceed 
in 
the 
new 
direction 
for 
a 
greater 
length 
of 
time 
and 
with 
greater 
speed, 
so 
that, 
though 
we 
may 
be 
afterwards 
brought 
back 
to 
the 
right 
way, 
we 
cannot 
nevertheless 
arrive 
at 
the 
destined 
place 
as 
soon 
as 
if 
we 
had 
not 
moved 
backwards 
at 
all; 
so 
in 
philosophy, 
when 
we 
make 
use 
of 
false 
principles, 
we 
depart 
the 
farther 
from 
the 
knowledge 
of 
truth 
and 
wisdom 
exactly 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
care 
with 
which 
we 
cultivate 
them, 
and 
apply 
ourselves 
to 
the 
deduction 
of 
diverse 
consequences 
from 
them, 
thinking 
that 
we 
are 
philosophizing 
well, 
while 
we 
are 
only 
departing 
the 
farther 
from 
the 
truth; 
from 
which 
it 
must 
be 
inferred 
that 
they 
who 
have 
learned 
the 
least 
of 
all 
that 
has 
been 
hitherto 
distinguished 
by 
the 
name 
of 
philosophy 
are 
the 
most 
fitted 
for 
the 
apprehension 
of 
truth. 


After 
making 
those 
matters 
clear, 
I 
should, 
in 
the 
next 
place, 
have 
desired 
to 
set 
forth 
the 
grounds 
for 
holding 
that 
the 
true 
principles 
by 
which 
we 
may 
reach 
that 
highest 
degree 
of 
wisdom 
wherein 
consists 
the 
sovereign 
good 
of 
human 
life, 
are 
those 
I 
have 
proposed 
in 
this 
work; 
and 
two 
considerations 
alone 
are 
sufficient 
to 
establish 
this—the 
first 
of 
which 
is, 
that 
these 
principles 
are 
very 
clear, 
and 
the 
second, 
that 
we 
can 
deduce 
all 
other 
truths 
from 
them; 
for 
it 
is 
only 
these 
two 
conditions 
that 
are 
required 
in 
true 
principles. 
But 
I 
easily 
prove 
that 
they 
are 
very 
clear; 
firstly, 
by 
a 
reference 
to 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
I 
found 
them, 
namely, 
by 
rejecting 
all 
propositions 
that 
were 
in 
the 
least 
doubtful, 
for 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
such 
as 
could 
not 
be 
rejected 
by 
this 
test 
when 
they 
were 
attentively 
considered, 
are 
the 
most 
evident 
and 
clear 
which 
the 
human 
mind 
can 
know. 
Thus 
by 
considering 
that 
he 
who 
strives 
to 
doubt 
of 
all 
is 
unable 
nevertheless 
to 
doubt 
that 
he 
is 
while 
he 
doubts, 
and 
that 
what 
reasons 
thus, 
in 
not 
being 
able 
to 
doubt 
of 
itself 
and 
doubting 
nevertheless 
of 
everything 
else, 
is 
not 
that 
which 
we 
call 
our 
body, 
but 
what 
we 
name 
our 
mind 
or 
thought, 
I 
have 
taken 
the 
existence 
of 
this 
thought 
for 
the 
first 
principle, 
from 
which 
I 
very 
clearly 
deduced 
the 
following 
truths, 
namely, 
that 
there 
is 
a 
God 
who 
is 
the 
author 
of 
all 
that 
is 
in 
the 
world, 
and 
who, 
being 
the 
source 
of 
all 
truth, 
cannot 
have 
created 
our 
understanding 
of 
such 
a 
nature 
as 
to 
be 
deceived 
in 
the 
judgments 
it 
forms 
of 
the 
things 
of 
which 
it 
possesses 
a 
very 
clear 
and 
distinct 
perception. 
Those 
are 
all 
the 
principles 
of 
which 
I 
avail 
myself 
touching 
immaterial 
or 



metaphysical 
objects, 
from 
which 
I 
most 
clearly 
deduce 
these 
other 
principles 
of 
physical 
or 
corporeal 
things, 
namely, 
that 
there 
are 
bodies 
extended 
in 
length, 
breadth, 
and 
depth, 
which 
are 
of 
diverse 
figures 
and 
are 
moved 
in 
a 
variety 
of 
ways. 
Such 
are 
in 
sum 
the 
principles 
from 
which 
I 
deduce 
all 
other 
truths. 
The 
second 
circumstance 
that 
proves 
the 
clearness 
of 
these 
principles 
is, 
that 
they 
have 
been 
known 
in 
all 
ages, 
and 
even 
received 
as 
true 
and 
indubitable 
by 
all 
men, 
with 
the 
exception 
only 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
God, 
which 
has 
been 
doubted 
by 
some, 
because 
they 
attributed 
too 
much 
to 
the 
perceptions 
of 
the 
senses, 
and 
God 
can 
neither 
be 
seen 
nor 
touched. 


But, 
though 
all 
the 
truths 
which 
I 
class 
among 
my 
principles 
were 
known 
at 
all 
times, 
and 
by 
all 
men, 
nevertheless, 
there 
has 
been 
no 
one 
up 
to 
the 
present, 
who, 
so 
far 
as 
I 
know, 
has 
adopted 
them 
as 
principles 
of 
philosophy: 
in 
other 
words, 
as 
such 
that 
we 
can 
deduce 
from 
them 
the 
knowledge 
of 
whatever 
else 
is 
in 
the 
world. 
It 
accordingly 
now 
remains 
for 
me 
to 
prove 
that 
they 
are 
such; 
and 
it 
appears 
to 
me 
that 
I 
cannot 
better 
establish 
this 
than 
by 
the 
test 
of 
experience: 
in 
other 
words, 
by 
inviting 
readers 
to 
peruse 
the 
following 
work. 
For, 
though 
I 
have 
not 
treated 
in 
it 
of 
all 
matters--that 
being 
impossible—I 
think 
I 
have 
so 
explained 
all 
of 
which 
I 
had 
occasion 
to 
treat, 
that 
they 
who 
read 
it 
attentively 
will 
have 
ground 
for 
the 
persuasion 
that 
it 
is 
unnecessary 
to 
seek 
for 
any 
other 
principles 
than 
those 
I 
have 
given, 
in 
order 
to 
arrive 
at 
the 
most 
exalted 
knowledge 
of 
which 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
is 
capable; 
especially 
if, 
after 
the 
perusal 
of 
my 
writings, 
they 
take 
the 
trouble 
to 
consider 
how 
many 
diverse 
questions 
are 
therein 
discussed 
and 
explained, 
and, 
referring 
to 
the 
writings 
of 
others, 
they 
see 
how 
little 
probability 
there 
is 
in 
the 
reasons 
that 
are 
adduced 
in 
explanation 
of 
the 
same 
questions 
by 
principles 
different 
from 
mine. 
And 
that 
they 
may 
the 
more 
easily 
undertake 
this, 
I 
might 
have 
said 
that 
those 
imbued 
with 
my 
doctrines 
have 
much 
less 
difficulty 
in 
comprehending 
the 
writings 
of 
others, 
and 
estimating 
their 
true 
value, 
than 
those 
who 
have 
not 
been 
so 
imbued; 
and 
this 
is 
precisely 
the 
opposite 
of 
what 
I 
before 
said 
of 
such 
as 
commenced 
with 
the 
ancient 
philosophy, 
namely, 
that 
the 
more 
they 
have 
studied 
it 
the 
less 
fit 
are 
they 
for 
rightly 
apprehending 
the 
truth. 


I 
should 
also 
have 
added 
a 
word 
of 
advice 
regarding 
the 
manner 
of 
reading 
this 
work, 
which 
is, 
that 
I 
should 
wish 
the 
reader 
at 
first 
to 
go 
over 
the 
whole 



of 
it, 
as 
he 
would 
a 
romance, 
without 
greatly 
straining 
his 
attention, 
or 
tarrying 
at 
the 
difficulties 
he 
may 
perhaps 
meet 
with 
in 
it, 
with 
the 
view 
simply 
of 
knowing 
in 
general 
the 
matters 
of 
which 
I 
treat; 
and 
that 
afterwards, 
if 
they 
seem 
to 
him 
to 
merit 
a 
more 
careful 
examination, 
and 
he 
feel 
a 
desire 
to 
know 
their 
causes, 
he 
may 
read 
it 
a 
second 
time, 
in 
order 
to 
observe 
the 
connection 
of 
my 
reasonings; 
but 
that 
he 
must 
not 
then 
give 
it 
up 
in 
despair, 
although 
he 
may 
not 
everywhere 
sufficiently 
discover 
the 
connection 
of 
the 
proof, 
or 
understand 
all 
the 
reasonings—it 
being 
only 
necessary 
to 
mark 
with 
a 
pen 
the 
places 
where 
the 
difficulties 
occur, 
and 
continue 
to 
read 
without 
interruption 
to 
the 
end; 
then, 
if 
he 
does 
not 
grudge 
to 
take 
up 
the 
book 
a 
third 
time, 
I 
am 
confident 
he 
will 
find 
in 
a 
fresh 
perusal 
the 
solution 
of 
most 
of 
the 
difficulties 
he 
will 
have 
marked 
before; 
and 
that, 
if 
any 
still 
remain, 
their 
solution 
will 
in 
the 
end 
be 
found 
in 
another 
reading. 


I 
have 
observed, 
on 
examining 
the 
natural 
constitutions 
of 
different 
minds, 
that 
there 
are 
hardly 
any 
so 
dull 
or 
slow 
of 
understanding 
as 
to 
be 
incapable 
of 
apprehending 
good 
opinions, 
or 
even 
of 
acquiring 
all 
the 
highest 
sciences, 
if 
they 
be 
but 
conducted 
along 
the 
right 
road. 
And 
this 
can 
also 
be 
proved 
by 
reason; 
for, 
as 
the 
principles 
are 
clear, 
and 
as 
nothing 
ought 
to 
be 
deduced 
from 
them, 
unless 
most 
manifest 
inferences, 
no 
one 
is 
so 
devoid 
of 
intelligence 
as 
to 
be 
unable 
to 
comprehend 
the 
conclusions 
that 
flow 
from 
them. 
But, 
besides 
the 
entanglement 
of 
prejudices, 
from 
which 
no 
one 
is 
entirely 
exempt, 
although 
it 
is 
they 
who 
have 
been 
the 
most 
ardent 
students 
of 
the 
false 
sciences 
that 
receive 
the 
greatest 
detriment 
from 
them, 
it 
happens 
very 
generally 
that 
people 
of 
ordinary 
capacity 
neglect 
to 
study 
from 
a 
conviction 
that 
they 
want 
ability, 
and 
that 
others, 
who 
are 
more 
ardent, 
press 
on 
too 
rapidly: 
whence 
it 
comes 
to 
pass 
that 
they 
frequently 
admit 
principles 
far 
from 
evident, 
and 
draw 
doubtful 
inferences 
from 
them. 
For 
this 
reason, 
I 
should 
wish 
to 
assure 
those 
who 
are 
too 
distrustful 
of 
their 
own 
ability 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
my 
writings 
which 
they 
may 
not 
entirely 
understand, 
if 
they 
only 
take 
the 
trouble 
to 
examine 
them; 
and 
I 
should 
wish, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
to 
warn 
those 
of 
an 
opposite 
tendency 
that 
even 
the 
most 
superior 
minds 
will 
have 
need 
of 
much 
time 
and 
attention 
to 
remark 
all 
I 
designed 
to 
embrace 
therein. 


After 
this, 
that 
I 
might 
lead 
men 
to 
understand 
the 
real 
design 
I 
had 
in 



publishing 
them, 
I 
should 
have 
wished 
here 
to 
explain 
the 
order 
which 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
one 
ought 
to 
follow 
with 
the 
view 
of 
instructing 
himself. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
a 
man 
who 
has 
merely 
the 
vulgar 
and 
imperfect 
knowledge 
which 
can 
be 
acquired 
by 
the 
four 
means 
above 
explained, 
ought, 
before 
all 
else, 
to 
endeavour 
to 
form 
for 
himself 
a 
code 
of 
morals, 
sufficient 
to 
regulate 
the 
actions 
of 
his 
life, 
as 
well 
for 
the 
reason 
that 
this 
does 
not 
admit 
of 
delay 
as 
because 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
our 
first 
care 
to 
live 
well. 
In 
the 
next 
place, 
he 
ought 
to 
study 
Logic, 
not 
that 
of 
the 
schools, 
for 
it 
is 
only, 
properly 
speaking, 
a 
dialectic 
which 
teaches 
the 
mode 
of 
expounding 
to 
others 
what 
we 
already 
know, 
or 
even 
of 
speaking 
much, 
without 
judgment, 
of 
what 
we 
do 
not 
know, 
by 
which 
means 
it 
corrupts 
rather 
than 
increases 
good 
sense—but 
the 
logic 
which 
teaches 
the 
right 
conduct 
of 
the 
reason 
with 
the 
view 
of 
discovering 
the 
truths 
of 
which 
we 
are 
ignorant; 
and, 
because 
it 
greatly 
depends 
on 
usage, 
it 
is 
desirable 
he 
should 
exercise 
himself 
for 
a 
length 
of 
time 
in 
practising 
its 
rules 
on 
easy 
and 
simple 
questions, 
as 
those 
of 
the 
mathematics. 
Then, 
when 
he 
has 
acquired 
some 
skill 
in 
discovering 
the 
truth 
in 
these 
questions, 
he 
should 
commence 
to 
apply 
himself 
in 
earnest 
to 
true 
philosophy, 
of 
which 
the 
first 
part 
is 
Metaphysics, 
containing 
the 
principles 
of 
knowledge, 
among 
which 
is 
the 
explication 
of 
the 
principal 
attributes 
of 
God, 
of 
the 
immateriality 
of 
the 
soul, 
and 
of 
all 
the 
clear 
and 
simple 
notions 
that 
are 
in 
us; 
the 
second 
is 
Physics, 
in 
which, 
after 
finding 
the 
true 
principles 
of 
material 
things, 
we 
examine, 
in 
general, 
how 
the 
whole 
universe 
has 
been 
framed; 
in 
the 
next 
place, 
we 
consider, 
in 
particular, 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
earth, 
and 
of 
all 
the 
bodies 
that 
are 
most 
generally 
found 
upon 
it, 
as 
air, 
water, 
fire, 
the 
loadstone 
and 
other 
minerals. 
In 
the 
next 
place 
it 
is 
necessary 
also 
to 
examine 
singly 
the 
nature 
of 
plants, 
of 
animals, 
and 
above 
all 
of 
man, 
in 
order 
that 
we 
may 
thereafter 
be 
able 
to 
discover 
the 
other 
sciences 
that 
are 
useful 
to 
us. 
Thus, 
all 
Philosophy 
is 
like 
a 
tree, 
of 
which 
Metaphysics 
is 
the 
root, 
Physics 
the 
trunk, 
and 
all 
the 
other 
sciences 
the 
branches 
that 
grow 
out 
of 
this 
trunk, 
which 
are 
reduced 
to 
three 
principal, 
namely, 
Medicine, 
Mechanics, 
and 
Ethics. 
By 
the 
science 
of 
Morals, 
I 
understand 
the 
highest 
and 
most 
perfect 
which, 
presupposing 
an 
entire 
knowledge 
of 
the 
other 
sciences, 
is 
the 
last 
degree 
of 
wisdom. 


But 
as 
it 
is 
not 
from 
the 
roots 
or 
the 
trunks 
of 
trees 
that 
we 
gather 
the 
fruit, 
but 
only 
from 
the 
extremities 
of 
their 
branches, 
so 
the 
principal 
utility 
of 



philosophy 
depends 
on 
the 
separate 
uses 
of 
its 
parts, 
which 
we 
can 
only 
learn 
last 
of 
all. 
But, 
though 
I 
am 
ignorant 
of 
almost 
all 
these, 
the 
zeal 
I 
have 
always 
felt 
in 
endeavouring 
to 
be 
of 
service 
to 
the 
public, 
was 
the 
reason 
why 
I 
published, 
some 
ten 
or 
twelve 
years 
ago, 
certain 
Essays 
on 
the 
doctrines 
I 
thought 
I 
had 
acquired. 
The 
first 
part 
of 
these 
Essays 
was 
a 
"Discourse 
on 
the 
Method 
of 
rightly 
conducting 
the 
Reason, 
and 
seeking 
Truth 
in 
the 
Sciences," 
in 
which 
I 
gave 
a 
summary 
of 
the 
principal 
rules 
of 
logic, 
and 
also 
of 
an 
imperfect 
ethic, 
which 
a 
person 
may 
follow 
provisionally 
so 
long 
as 
he 
does 
not 
know 
any 
better. 
The 
other 
parts 
were 
three 
treatises: 
the 
first 
of 
Dioptrics, 
the 
second 
of 
Meteors, 
and 
the 
third 
of 
Geometry. 
In 
the 
Dioptrics, 
I 
designed 
to 
show 
that 
we 
might 
proceed 
far 
enough 
in 
philosophy 
as 
to 
arrive, 
by 
its 
means, 
at 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
arts 
that 
are 
useful 
to 
life, 
because 
the 
invention 
of 
the 
telescope, 
of 
which 
I 
there 
gave 
an 
explanation, 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
difficult 
that 
has 
ever 
been 
made. 
In 
the 
treatise 
of 
Meteors, 
I 
desired 
to 
exhibit 
the 
difference 
that 
subsists 
between 
the 
philosophy 
I 
cultivate 
and 
that 
taught 
in 
the 
schools, 
in 
which 
the 
same 
matters 
are 
usually 
discussed. 
In 
fine, 
in 
the 
Geometry, 
I 
professed 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
I 
had 
discovered 
many 
things 
that 
were 
before 
unknown, 
and 
thus 
afford 
ground 
for 
believing 
that 
we 
may 
still 
discover 
many 
others, 
with 
the 
view 
of 
thus 
stimulating 
all 
to 
the 
investigation 
of 
truth. 
Since 
that 
period, 
anticipating 
the 
difficulty 
which 
many 
would 
experience 
in 
apprehending 
the 
foundations 
of 
the 
Metaphysics, 
I 
endeavoured 
to 
explain 
the 
chief 
points 
of 
them 
in 
a 
book 
of 
Meditations, 
which 
is 
not 
in 
itself 
large, 
but 
the 
size 
of 
which 
has 
been 
increased, 
and 
the 
matter 
greatly 
illustrated, 
by 
the 
Objections 
which 
several 
very 
learned 
persons 
sent 
to 
me 
on 
occasion 
of 
it, 
and 
by 
the 
Replies 
which 
I 
made 
to 
them. 
At 
length, 
after 
it 
appeared 
to 
me 
that 
those 
preceding 
treatises 
had 
sufficiently 
prepared 
the 
minds 
of 
my 
readers 
for 
the 
Principles 
of 
Philosophy, 
I 
also 
published 
it; 
and 
I 
have 
divided 
this 
work 
into 
four 
parts, 
the 
first 
of 
which 
contains 
the 
principles 
of 
human 
knowledge, 
and 
which 
may 
be 
called 
the 
First 
Philosophy, 
or 
Metaphysics. 
That 
this 
part, 
accordingly, 
may 
be 
properly 
understood, 
it 
will 
be 
necessary 
to 
read 
beforehand 
the 
book 
of 
Meditations 
I 
wrote 
on 
the 
same 
subject. 
The 
other 
three 
parts 
contain 
all 
that 
is 
most 
general 
in 
Physics, 
namely, 
the 
explication 
of 
the 
first 
laws 
or 
principles 
of 
nature, 
and 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
heavens, 
the 
fixed 
stars, 
the 
planets, 
comets, 
and 
generally 
the 
whole 
universe, 
were 
composed; 
in 
the 
next 
place, 
the 
explication, 
in 



particular, 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
this 
earth, 
the 
air, 
water, 
fire, 
the 
magnet, 
which 
are 
the 
bodies 
we 
most 
commonly 
find 
everywhere 
around 
it, 
and 
of 
all 
the 
qualities 
we 
observe 
in 
these 
bodies, 
as 
light, 
heat, 
gravity, 
and 
the 
like. 
In 
this 
way, 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
I 
have 
commenced 
the 
orderly 
explanation 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
philosophy, 
without 
omitting 
any 
of 
the 
matters 
that 
ought 
to 
precede 
the 
last 
which 
I 
discussed. 
But 
to 
bring 
this 
undertaking 
to 
its 
conclusion, 
I 
ought 
hereafter 
to 
explain, 
in 
the 
same 
manner, 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
other 
more 
particular 
bodies 
that 
are 
on 
the 
earth, 
namely, 
minerals, 
plants, 
animals, 
and 
especially 
man; 
finally, 
to 
treat 
thereafter 
with 
accuracy 
of 
Medicine, 
Ethics, 
and 
Mechanics. 
I 
should 
require 
to 
do 
this 
in 
order 
to 
give 
to 
the 
world 
a 
complete 
body 
of 
philosophy; 
and 
I 
do 
not 
yet 
feel 
myself 
so 
old,--I 
do 
not 
so 
much 
distrust 
my 
strength, 
nor 
do 
I 
find 
myself 
so 
far 
removed 
from 
the 
knowledge 
of 
what 
remains, 
as 
that 
I 
should 
not 
dare 
to 
undertake 
to 
complete 
this 
design, 
provided 
I 
were 
in 
a 
position 
to 
make 
all 
the 
experiments 
which 
I 
should 
require 
for 
the 
basis 
and 
verification 
of 
my 
reasonings. 
But 
seeing 
that 
would 
demand 
a 
great 
expenditure, 
to 
which 
the 
resources 
of 
a 
private 
individual 
like 
myself 
would 
not 
be 
adequate, 
unless 
aided 
by 
the 
public, 
and 
as 
I 
have 
no 
ground 
to 
expect 
this 
aid, 
I 
believe 
that 
I 
ought 
for 
the 
future 
to 
content 
myself 
with 
studying 
for 
my 
own 
instruction, 
and 
posterity 
will 
excuse 
me 
if 
I 
fail 
hereafter 
to 
labour 
for 
them. 


Meanwhile, 
that 
it 
may 
be 
seen 
wherein 
I 
think 
I 
have 
already 
promoted 
the 
general 
good, 
I 
will 
here 
mention 
the 
fruits 
that 
may 
be 
gathered 
from 
my 
Principles. 
The 
first 
is 
the 
satisfaction 
which 
the 
mind 
will 
experience 
on 
finding 
in 
the 
work 
many 
truths 
before 
unknown; 
for 
although 
frequently 
truth 
does 
not 
so 
greatly 
affect 
our 
imagination 
as 
falsity 
and 
fiction, 
because 
it 
seems 
less 
wonderful 
and 
is 
more 
simple, 
yet 
the 
gratification 
it 
affords 
is 
always 
more 
durable 
and 
solid. 
The 
second 
fruit 
is, 
that 
in 
studying 
these 
principles 
we 
will 
become 
accustomed 
by 
degrees 
to 
judge 
better 
of 
all 
the 
things 
we 
come 
in 
contact 
with, 
and 
thus 
be 
made 
wiser, 
in 
which 
respect 
the 
effect 
will 
be 
quite 
the 
opposite 
of 
the 
common 
philosophy, 
for 
we 
may 
easily 
remark 
in 
those 
we 
call 
pedants 
that 
it 
renders 
them 
less 
capable 
of 
rightly 
exercising 
their 
reason 
than 
they 
would 
have 
been 
if 
they 
had 
never 
known 
it. 
The 
third 
is, 
that 
the 
truths 
which 
they 
contain, 
being 
highly 
clear 
and 
certain, 
will 
take 
away 
all 
ground 
of 
dispute, 
and 
thus 
dispose 
men's 
minds 
to 
gentleness 
and 
concord; 
whereas 
the 
contrary 
is 
the 
effect 
of 
the 



controversies 
of 
the 
schools, 
which, 
as 
they 
insensibly 
render 
those 
who 
are 
exercised 
in 
them 
more 
wrangling 
and 
opinionative, 
are 
perhaps 
the 
prime 
cause 
of 
the 
heresies 
and 
dissensions 
that 
now 
harass 
the 
world. 
The 
last 
and 
chief 
fruit 
of 
these 
Principles 
is, 
that 
one 
will 
be 
able, 
by 
cultivating 
them, 
to 
discover 
many 
truths 
I 
myself 
have 
not 
unfolded, 
and 
thus 
passing 
by 
degrees 
from 
one 
to 
another, 
to 
acquire 
in 
course 
of 
time 
a 
perfect 
knowledge 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
philosophy, 
and 
to 
rise 
to 
the 
highest 
degree 
of 
wisdom. 
For 
just 
as 
all 
the 
arts, 
though 
in 
their 
beginnings 
they 
are 
rude 
and 
imperfect, 
are 
yet 
gradually 
perfected 
by 
practice, 
from 
their 
containing 
at 
first 
something 
true, 
and 
whose 
effect 
experience 
evinces; 
so 
in 
philosophy, 
when 
we 
have 
true 
principles, 
we 
cannot 
fail 
by 
following 
them 
to 
meet 
sometimes 
with 
other 
truths; 
and 
we 
could 
not 
better 
prove 
the 
falsity 
of 
those 
of 
Aristotle, 
than 
by 
saying 
that 
men 
made 
no 
progress 
in 
knowledge 
by 
their 
means 
during 
the 
many 
ages 
they 
prosecuted 
them. 


I 
well 
know 
that 
there 
are 
some 
men 
so 
precipitate 
and 
accustomed 
to 
use 
so 
little 
circumspection 
in 
what 
they 
do, 
that, 
even 
with 
the 
most 
solid 
foundations, 
they 
could 
not 
rear 
a 
firm 
superstructure; 
and 
as 
it 
is 
usually 
those 
who 
are 
the 
readiest 
to 
make 
books, 
they 
would 
in 
a 
short 
time 
mar 
all 
that 
I 
have 
done, 
and 
introduce 
uncertainty 
and 
doubt 
into 
my 
manner 
of 
philosophizing, 
from 
which 
I 
have 
carefully 
endeavoured 
to 
banish 
them, 
if 
people 
were 
to 
receive 
their 
writings 
as 
mine, 
or 
as 
representing 
my 
opinions. 
I 
had, 
not 
long 
ago, 
some 
experience 
of 
this 
in 
one 
of 
those 
who 
were 
believed 
desirous 
of 
following 
me 
the 
most 
closely, 
[Footnote: 
Regius; 
see 
La 
Vie 
de 
M. 
Descartes, 
reduite 
en 
abrege 
(Baillet). 
Liv. 
vii., 
chap. 
vii.—T.] 
and 
one 
too 
of 
whom 
I 
had 
somewhere 
said 
that 
I 
had 
such 
confidence 
in 
his 
genius 
as 
to 
believe 
that 
he 
adhered 
to 
no 
opinions 
which 
I 
should 
not 
be 
ready 
to 
avow 
as 
mine; 
for 
he 
last 
year 
published 
a 
book 
entitled 
"Fundamental 
Physics," 
in 
which, 
although 
he 
seems 
to 
have 
written 
nothing 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
Physics 
and 
Medicine 
which 
he 
did 
not 
take 
from 
my 
writings, 
as 
well 
from 
those 
I 
have 
published 
as 
from 
another 
still 
imperfect 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
animals, 
which 
fell 
into 
his 
hands; 
nevertheless, 
because 
he 
has 
copied 
them 
badly, 
and 
changed 
the 
order, 
and 
denied 
certain 
metaphysical 
truths 
upon 
which 
all 
Physics 
ought 
to 
be 
based, 
I 
am 
obliged 
wholly 
to 
disavow 
his 
work, 
and 
here 
to 
request 
readers 
not 
to 
attribute 
to 
me 
any 
opinion 
unless 
they 
find 
it 
expressly 
stated 
in 
my 
own 
writings, 
and 
to 



receive 
no 
opinion 
as 
true, 
whether 
in 
my 
writings 
or 
elsewhere, 
unless 
they 
see 
that 
it 
is 
very 
clearly 
deduced 
from 
true 
principles. 
I 
well 
know, 
likewise, 
that 
many 
ages 
may 
elapse 
ere 
all 
the 
truths 
deducible 
from 
these 
principles 
are 
evolved 
out 
of 
them, 
as 
well 
because 
the 
greater 
number 
of 
such 
as 
remain 
to 
be 
discovered 
depend 
on 
certain 
particular 
experiments 
that 
never 
occur 
by 
chance, 
but 
which 
require 
to 
be 
investigated 
with 
care 
and 
expense 
by 
men 
of 
the 
highest 
intelligence, 
as 
because 
it 
will 
hardly 
happen 
that 
the 
same 
persons 
who 
have 
the 
sagacity 
to 
make 
a 
right 
use 
of 
them, 
will 
possess 
also 
the 
means 
of 
making 
them, 
and 
also 
because 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
best 
minds 
have 
formed 
so 
low 
an 
estimate 
of 
philosophy 
in 
general, 
from 
the 
imperfections 
they 
have 
remarked 
in 
the 
kind 
in 
vogue 
up 
to 
the 
present 
time, 
that 
they 
cannot 
apply 
themselves 
to 
the 
search 
after 
truth. 


But, 
in 
conclusion, 
if 
the 
difference 
discernible 
between 
the 
principles 
in 
question 
and 
those 
of 
every 
other 
system, 
and 
the 
great 
array 
of 
truths 
deducible 
from 
them, 
lead 
them 
to 
discern 
the 
importance 
of 
continuing 
the 
search 
after 
these 
truths, 
and 
to 
observe 
the 
degree 
of 
wisdom, 
the 
perfection 
and 
felicity 
of 
life, 
to 
which 
they 
are 
fitted 
to 
conduct 
us, 
I 
venture 
to 
believe 
that 
there 
will 
not 
be 
found 
one 
who 
is 
not 
ready 
to 
labour 
hard 
in 
so 
profitable 
a 
study, 
or 
at 
least 
to 
favour 
and 
aid 
with 
all 
his 
might 
those 
who 
shall 
devote 
themselves 
to 
it 
with 
success. 


The 
height 
of 
my 
wishes 
is, 
that 
posterity 
may 
sometime 
behold 
the 
happy 
issue 
of 
it, 
etc. 


TO 
THE 
MOST 
SERENE 
PRINCESS, 


ELIZABETH, 
ELDEST 
DAUGHTER 
OF 
FREDERICK, 
KING 
OF 
BOHEMIA, 
COUNT 
PALATINE, 
AND 
ELECTOR 
OF 
THE 
SACRED 
ROMAN 
EMPIRE. 


MADAM,—The 
greatest 
advantage 
I 
have 
derived 
from 
the 
writings 
which 
I 
have 
already 
published, 
has 
arisen 
from 
my 
having, 
through 
means 
of 
them, 
become 
known 
to 
your 
Highness, 
and 
thus 
been 
privileged 
to 
hold 
occasional 
converse 
with 
one 
in 
whom 
so 
many 
rare 
and 
estimable 
qualities 
are 
united, 
as 
to 
lead 
me 
to 
believe 
I 
should 
do 
service 
to 
the 
public 
by 
proposing 
them 
as 
an 
example 
to 
posterity. 
It 
would 
ill 
become 
me 
to 
flatter, 
or 
to 
give 
expression 
to 
anything 
of 
which 
I 
had 
no 
certain 
knowledge, 
especially 
in 
the 
first 
pages 
of 
a 
work 
in 
which 
I 
aim 
at 
laying 
down 
the 
principles 
of 
truth. 



And 
the 
generous 
modesty 
that 
is 
conspicuous 
in 
all 
your 
actions, 
assures 
me 
that 
the 
frank 
and 
simple 
judgment 
of 
a 
man 
who 
only 
writes 
what 
he 
believes 
will 
be 
more 
agreeable 
to 
you 
than 
the 
ornate 
laudations 
of 
those 
who 
have 
studied 
the 
art 
of 
compliment. 
For 
this 
reason, 
I 
will 
give 
insertion 
to 
nothing 
in 
this 
letter 
for 
which 
I 
have 
not 
the 
certainty 
both 
of 
experience 
and 
reason; 
and 
in 
the 
exordium, 
as 
in 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
work, 
I 
will 
write 
only 
as 
becomes 
a 
philosopher. 
There 
is 
a 
vast 
difference 
between 
real 
and 
apparent 
virtues; 
and 
there 
is 
also 
a 
great 
discrepancy 
between 
those 
real 
virtues 
that 
proceed 
from 
an 
accurate 
knowledge 
of 
the 
truth, 
and 
such 
as 
are 
accompanied 
with 
ignorance 
or 
error. 
The 
virtues 
I 
call 
apparent 
are 
only, 
properly 
speaking, 
vices, 
which, 
as 
they 
are 
less 
frequent 
than 
the 
vices 
that 
are 
opposed 
to 
them, 
and 
are 
farther 
removed 
from 
them 
than 
the 
intermediate 
virtues, 
are 
usually 
held 
in 
higher 
esteem 
than 
those 
virtues. 
Thus, 
because 
those 
who 
fear 
dangers 
too 
much 
are 
more 
numerous 
than 
they 
who 
fear 
them 
too 
little, 
temerity 
is 
frequently 
opposed 
to 
the 
vice 
of 
timidity, 
and 
taken 
for 
a 
virtue, 
and 
is 
commonly 
more 
highly 
esteemed 
than 
true 
fortitude. 
Thus, 
also, 
the 
prodigal 
are 
in 
ordinary 
more 
praised 
than 
the 
liberal; 
and 
none 
more 
easily 
acquire 
a 
great 
reputation 
for 
piety 
than 
the 
superstitious 
and 
hypocritical. 
With 
regard 
to 
true 
virtues, 
these 
do 
not 
all 
proceed 
from 
true 
knowledge, 
for 
there 
are 
some 
that 
likewise 
spring 
from 
defect 
or 
error; 
thus, 
simplicity 
is 
frequently 
the 
source 
of 
goodness, 
fear 
of 
devotion, 
and 
despair 
of 
courage. 
The 
virtues 
that 
are 
thus 
accompanied 
with 
some 
imperfections 
differ 
from 
each 
other, 
and 
have 
received 
diverse 
appellations. 
But 
those 
pure 
and 
perfect 
virtues 
that 
arise 
from 
the 
knowledge 
of 
good 
alone 
are 
all 
of 
the 
same 
nature, 
and 
may 
be 
comprised 
under 
the 
single 
term 
wisdom. 
For, 
whoever 
owns 
the 
firm 
and 
constant 
resolution 
of 
always 
using 
his 
reason 
as 
well 
as 
lies 
in 
his 
power, 
and 
in 
all 
his 
actions 
of 
doing 
what 
he 
judges 
to 
be 
best, 
is 
truly 
wise, 
as 
far 
as 
his 
nature 
permits; 
and 
by 
this 
alone 
he 
is 
just, 
courageous, 
temperate, 
and 
possesses 
all 
the 
other 
virtues, 
but 
so 
well 
balanced 
as 
that 
none 
of 
them 
appears 
more 
prominent 
than 
another: 
and 
for 
this 
reason, 
although 
they 
are 
much 
more 
perfect 
than 
the 
virtues 
that 
blaze 
forth 
through 
the 
mixture 
of 
some 
defect, 
yet, 
because 
the 
crowd 
thus 
observes 
them 
less, 
they 
are 
not 
usually 
extolled 
so 
highly. 
Besides, 
of 
the 
two 
things 
that 
are 
requisite 
for 
the 
wisdom 
thus 
described, 
namely, 
the 
perception 
of 
the 
understanding 
and 
the 
disposition 
of 
the 
will, 
it 
is 
only 
that 
which 
lies 
in 
the 
will 
which 
all 
men 
can 
possess 
equally, 



inasmuch 
as 
the 
understanding 
of 
some 
is 
inferior 
to 
that 
of 
others. 
But 
although 
those 
who 
have 
only 
an 
inferior 
understanding 
may 
be 
as 
perfectly 
wise 
as 
their 
nature 
permits, 
and 
may 
render 
themselves 
highly 
acceptable 
to 
God 
by 
their 
virtue, 
provided 
they 
preserve 
always 
a 
firm 
and 
constant 
resolution 
to 
do 
all 
that 
they 
shall 
judge 
to 
be 
right, 
and 
to 
omit 
nothing 
that 
may 
lead 
them 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
duties 
of 
which 
they 
are 
ignorant; 
nevertheless, 
those 
who 
preserve 
a 
constant 
resolution 
of 
performing 
the 
right, 
and 
are 
especially 
careful 
in 
instructing 
themselves, 
and 
who 
possess 
also 
a 
highly 
perspicacious 
intellect, 
arrive 
doubtless 
at 
a 
higher 
degree 
of 
wisdom 
than 
others; 
and 
I 
see 
that 
these 
three 
particulars 
are 
found 
in 
great 
perfection 
in 
your 
Highness. 
For, 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
your 
desire 
of 
self-
instruction 
is 
manifest, 
from 
the 
circumstance 
that 
neither 
the 
amusements 
of 
the 
court, 
nor 
the 
accustomed 
mode 
of 
educating 
ladies, 
which 
ordinarily 
condemns 
them 
to 
ignorance, 
have 
been 
sufficient 
to 
prevent 
you 
from 
studying 
with 
much 
care 
all 
that 
is 
best 
in 
the 
arts 
and 
sciences; 
and 
the 
incomparable 
perspicacity 
of 
your 
intellect 
is 
evinced 
by 
this, 
that 
you 
penetrated 
the 
secrets 
of 
the 
sciences 
and 
acquired 
an 
accurate 
knowledge 
of 
them 
in 
a 
very 
short 
period. 
But 
of 
the 
vigour 
of 
your 
intellect 
I 
have 
a 
still 
stronger 
proof, 
and 
one 
peculiar 
to 
myself, 
in 
that 
I 
have 
never 
yet 
met 
any 
one 
who 
understood 
so 
generally 
and 
so 
well 
as 
yourself 
all 
that 
is 
contained 
in 
my 
writings. 
For 
there 
are 
several, 
even 
among 
men 
of 
the 
highest 
intellect 
and 
learning, 
who 
find 
them 
very 
obscure. 
And 
I 
remark, 
in 
almost 
all 
those 
who 
are 
versant 
in 
Metaphysics, 
that 
they 
are 
wholly 
disinclined 
from 
Geometry; 
and, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
that 
the 
cultivators 
of 
Geometry 
have 
no 
ability 
for 
the 
investigations 
of 
the 
First 
Philosophy: 
insomuch 
that 
I 
can 
say 
with 
truth 
I 
know 
but 
one 
mind, 
and 
that 
is 
your 
own, 
to 
which 
both 
studies 
are 
alike 
congenial, 
and 
which 
I 
therefore, 
with 
propriety, 
designate 
incomparable. 
But 
what 
most 
of 
all 
enhances 
my 
admiration 
is, 
that 
so 
accurate 
and 
varied 
an 
acquaintance 
with 
the 
whole 
circle 
of 
the 
sciences 
is 
not 
found 
in 
some 
aged 
doctor 
who 
has 
employed 
many 
years 
in 
contemplation, 
but 
in 
a 
Princess 
still 
young, 
and 
whose 
countenance 
and 
years 
would 
more 
fitly 
represent 
one 
of 
the 
Graces 
than 
a 
Muse 
or 
the 
sage 
Minerva. 
In 
conclusion, 
I 
not 
only 
remark 
in 
your 
Highness 
all 
that 
is 
requisite 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
mind 
to 
perfect 
and 
sublime 
wisdom, 
but 
also 
all 
that 
can 
be 
required 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
will 
or 
the 
manners, 
in 
which 
benignity 
and 
gentleness 
are 
so 
conjoined 
with 
majesty 
that, 
though 
fortune 
has 



attacked 
you 
with 
continued 
injustice, 
it 
has 
failed 
either 
to 
irritate 
or 
crush 
you. 
And 
this 
constrains 
me 
to 
such 
veneration 
that 
I 
not 
only 
think 
this 
work 
due 
to 
you, 
since 
it 
treats 
of 
philosophy 
which 
is 
the 
study 
of 
wisdom, 
but 
likewise 
feel 
not 
more 
zeal 
for 
my 
reputation 
as 
a 
philosopher 
than 
pleasure 
in 
subscribing 
myself,— 


Of 
your 
most 
Serene 
Highness, 
The 
most 
devoted 
servant, 


DESCARTES. 


OF 
THE 
PRINCIPLES 
OF 
HUMAN 
KNOWLEDGE. 


I. 
THAT 
in 
order 
to 
seek 
truth, 
it 
is 
necessary 
once 
in 
the 
course 
of 
our 
life, 
to 
doubt, 
as 
far 
as 
possible, 
of 
all 
things. 
As 
we 
were 
at 
one 
time 
children, 
and 
as 
we 
formed 
various 
judgments 
regarding 
the 
objects 
presented 
to 
our 
senses, 
when 
as 
yet 
we 
had 
not 
the 
entire 
use 
of 
our 
reason, 
numerous 
prejudices 
stand 
in 
the 
way 
of 
our 
arriving 
at 
the 
knowledge 
of 
truth; 
and 
of 
these 
it 
seems 
impossible 
for 
us 
to 
rid 
ourselves, 
unless 
we 
undertake, 
once 
in 
our 
lifetime, 
to 
doubt 
of 
all 
those 
things 
in 
which 
we 
may 
discover 
even 
the 
smallest 
suspicion 
of 
uncertainty. 


II. 
That 
we 
ought 
also 
to 
consider 
as 
false 
all 
that 
is 
doubtful. 
Moreover, 
it 
will 
be 
useful 
likewise 
to 
esteem 
as 
false 
the 
things 
of 
which 
we 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
doubt, 
that 
we 
may 
with 
greater 
clearness 
discover 
what 
possesses 
most 
certainty 
and 
is 
the 
easiest 
to 
know. 


III. 
That 
we 
ought 
not 
meanwhile 
to 
make 
use 
of 
doubt 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
life. 
In 
the 
meantime, 
it 
is 
to 
be 
observed 
that 
we 
are 
to 
avail 
ourselves 
of 
this 
general 
doubt 
only 
while 
engaged 
in 
the 
contemplation 
of 
truth. 
For, 
as 
far 
as 
concerns 
the 
conduct 
of 
life, 
we 
are 
very 
frequently 
obliged 
to 
follow 
opinions 
merely 
probable, 
or 
even 
sometimes, 
though 
of 
two 
courses 
of 
action 
we 
may 
not 
perceive 
more 
probability 
in 
the 
one 
than 
in 
the 
other, 
to 
choose 
one 
or 
other, 
seeing 
the 
opportunity 
of 
acting 
would 
not 
unfrequently 
pass 
away 
before 
we 
could 
free 
ourselves 
from 
our 
doubts. 


IV. 
Why 
we 
may 
doubt 
of 
sensible 
things. 

Accordingly, 
since 
we 
now 
only 
design 
to 
apply 
ourselves 
to 
the 
investigation 
of 
truth, 
we 
will 
doubt, 
first, 
whether 
of 
all 
the 
things 
that 
have 
ever 
fallen 
under 
our 
senses, 
or 
which 
we 
have 
ever 
imagined, 
any 
one 
really 
exist; 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
because 
we 
know 
by 
experience 
that 
the 
senses 
sometimes 
err, 
and 
it 
would 
be 
imprudent 
to 
trust 
too 
much 
to 
what 
has 
even 
once 
deceived 
us; 
secondly, 
because 
in 
dreams 
we 
perpetually 
seem 
to 
perceive 
or 
imagine 
innumerable 
objects 
which 
have 
no 
existence. 
And 
to 
one 
who 
has 
thus 
resolved 
upon 
a 
general 
doubt, 
there 
appear 
no 
marks 
by 
which 
he 
can 
with 
certainty 
distinguish 
sleep 
from 
the 
waking 
state. 


V. 
Why 
we 
may 
also 
doubt 
of 
mathematical 
demonstrations. 
We 
will 
also 
doubt 
of 
the 
other 
things 
we 
have 
before 
held 
as 
most 
certain, 
even 
of 
the 
demonstrations 
of 
mathematics, 
and 
of 
their 
principles 
which 
we 
have 
hitherto 
deemed 
self-evident; 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
because 
we 
have 
sometimes 
seen 
men 
fall 
into 
error 
in 
such 
matters, 
and 
admit 
as 
absolutely 
certain 
and 
self 
evident 
what 
to 
us 
appeared 
false, 
but 
chiefly 
because 
we 
have 
learnt 
that 
God 
who 
created 
us 
is 
all-powerful; 
for 
we 
do 
not 
yet 
know 
whether 
perhaps 
it 
was 
his 
will 
to 
create 
us 
so 
that 
we 
are 
always 
deceived, 
even 
in 
the 
things 
we 
think 
we 
know 
best: 
since 
this 
does 
not 
appear 
more 
impossible 
than 
our 
being 
occasionally 
deceived, 
which, 
however, 
as 
observation 
teaches 
us, 
is 
the 
case. 
And 
if 
we 
suppose 
that 
an 
all-powerful 
God 
is 
not 
the 
author 
of 
our 
being, 
and 
that 
we 
exist 
of 
ourselves 
or 
by 
some 
other 
means, 
still, 
the 
less 
powerful 
we 
suppose 
our 
author 
to 
be, 
the 
greater 
reason 
will 
we 
have 
for 
believing 
that 
we 
are 
not 
so 
perfect 
as 
that 
we 
may 
not 
be 
continually 
deceived. 


VI. 
That 
we 
possess 
a 
free-will, 
by 
which 
we 
can 
withhold 
our 
assent 
from 
what 
is 
doubtful, 
and 
thus 
avoid 
error. 
But 
meanwhile, 
whoever 
in 
the 
end 
may 
be 
the 
author 
of 
our 
being, 
and 
however 
powerful 
and 
deceitful 
he 
may 
be, 
we 
are 
nevertheless 
conscious 
of 
a 
freedom, 
by 
which 
we 
can 
refrain 
from 
admitting 
to 
a 
place 
in 
our 
belief 
aught 
that 
is 
not 
manifestly 
certain 
and 
undoubted, 
and 
thus 
guard 
against 
ever 
being 
deceived. 


VII. 
That 
we 
cannot 
doubt 
of 
our 
existence 
while 
we 
doubt, 
and 
that 
this 
is 
the 
first 
knowledge 
we 
acquire 
when 
we 
philosophize 
in 
order. 

While 
we 
thus 
reject 
all 
of 
which 
we 
can 
entertain 
the 
smallest 
doubt, 
and 
even 
imagine 
that 
it 
is 
false, 
we 
easily 
indeed 
suppose 
that 
there 
is 
neither 
God, 
nor 
sky, 
nor 
bodies, 
and 
that 
we 
ourselves 
even 
have 
neither 
hands 
nor 
feet, 
nor, 
finally, 
a 
body; 
but 
we 
cannot 
in 
the 
same 
way 
suppose 
that 
we 
are 
not 
while 
we 
doubt 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
these 
things; 
for 
there 
is 
a 
repugnance 
in 
conceiving 
that 
what 
thinks 
does 
not 
exist 
at 
the 
very 
time 
when 
it 
thinks. 
Accordingly, 
the 
knowledge, 
I 
THINK, 
THEREFORE 
I 
AM, 
is 
the 
first 
and 
most 
certain 
that 
occurs 
to 
one 
who 
philosophizes 
orderly. 


VIII. 
That 
we 
hence 
discover 
the 
distinction 
between 
the 
mind 
and 
the 
body, 
or 
between 
a 
thinking 
and 
corporeal 
thing. 
And 
this 
is 
the 
best 
mode 
of 
discovering 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
mind, 
and 
its 
distinctness 
from 
the 
body: 
for 
examining 
what 
we 
are, 
while 
supposing, 
as 
we 
now 
do, 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
really 
existing 
apart 
from 
our 
thought, 
we 
clearly 
perceive 
that 
neither 
extension, 
nor 
figure, 
nor 
local 
motion,[Footnote: 
Instead 
of 
"local 
motion," 
the 
French 
has 
"existence 
in 
any 
place."] 
nor 
anything 
similar 
that 
can 
be 
attributed 
to 
body, 
pertains 
to 
our 
nature, 
and 
nothing 
save 
thought 
alone; 
and, 
consequently, 
that 
the 
notion 
we 
have 
of 
our 
mind 
precedes 
that 
of 
any 
corporeal 
thing, 
and 
is 
more 
certain, 
seeing 
we 
still 
doubt 
whether 
there 
is 
any 
body 
in 
existence, 
while 
we 
already 
perceive 
that 
we 
think. 


IX. 
What 
thought 
(COGITATIO) 
is. 
By 
the 
word 
thought, 
I 
understand 
all 
that 
which 
so 
takes 
place 
in 
us 
that 
we 
of 
ourselves 
are 
immediately 
conscious 
of 
it; 
and, 
accordingly, 
not 
only 
to 
understand 
(INTELLIGERE, 
ENTENDRE), 
to 
will 
(VELLE), 
to 
imagine 
(IMAGINARI), 
but 
even 
to 
perceive 
(SENTIRE, 
SENTIR), 
are 
here 
the 
same 
as 
to 
think 
(COGITARE, 
PENSER). 
For 
if 
I 
say, 
I 
see, 
or, 
I 
walk, 
therefore 
I 
am; 
and 
if 
I 
understand 
by 
vision 
or 
walking 
the 
act 
of 
my 
eyes 
or 
of 
my 
limbs, 
which 
is 
the 
work 
of 
the 
body, 
the 
conclusion 
is 
not 
absolutely 
certain, 
because, 
as 
is 
often 
the 
case 
in 
dreams, 
I 
may 
think 
that 
I 
see 
or 
walk, 
although 
I 
do 
not 
open 
my 
eyes 
or 
move 
from 
my 
place, 
and 
even, 
perhaps, 
although 
I 
have 
no 
body: 
but, 
if 
I 
mean 
the 
sensation 
itself, 
or 
consciousness 
of 
seeing 
or 
walking, 
the 
knowledge 
is 
manifestly 
certain, 
because 
it 
is 
then 
referred 
to 
the 
mind, 
which 
alone 
perceives 
or 
is 
conscious 
that 
it 
sees 
or 



walks. 
[Footnote: 
In 
the 
French, 
"which 
alone 
has 
the 
power 
of 
perceiving, 
or 
of 
being 
conscious 
in 
any 
other 
way 
whatever."] 


X. 
That 
the 
notions 
which 
are 
simplest 
and 
self-evident, 
are 
obscured 
by 
logical 
definitions; 
and 
that 
such 
are 
not 
to 
be 
reckoned 
among 
the 
cognitions 
acquired 
by 
study, 
[but 
as 
born 
with 
us]. 
I 
do 
not 
here 
explain 
several 
other 
terms 
which 
I 
have 
used, 
or 
design 
to 
use 
in 
the 
sequel, 
because 
their 
meaning 
seems 
to 
me 
sufficiently 
self-evident. 
And 
I 
frequently 
remarked 
that 
philosophers 
erred 
in 
attempting 
to 
explain, 
by 
logical 
definitions, 
such 
truths 
as 
are 
most 
simple 
and 
self-evident; 
for 
they 
thus 
only 
rendered 
them 
more 
obscure. 
And 
when 
I 
said 
that 
the 
proposition, 
I 
THINK, 
THEREFORE 
I 
AM, 
is 
of 
all 
others 
the 
first 
and 
most 
certain 
which 
occurs 
to 
one 
philosophizing 
orderly, 
I 
did 
not 
therefore 
deny 
that 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
know 
what 
thought, 
existence, 
and 
certitude 
are, 
and 
the 
truth 
that, 
in 
order 
to 
think 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
be, 
and 
the 
like; 
but, 
because 
these 
are 
the 
most 
simple 
notions, 
and 
such 
as 
of 
themselves 
afford 
the 
knowledge 
of 
nothing 
existing, 
I 
did 
not 
judge 
it 
proper 
there 
to 
enumerate 
them. 


XI. 
How 
we 
can 
know 
our 
mind 
more 
clearly 
than 
our 
body. 
But 
now 
that 
it 
may 
be 
discerned 
how 
the 
knowledge 
we 
have 
of 
the 
mind 
not 
only 
precedes, 
and 
has 
greater 
certainty, 
but 
is 
even 
clearer, 
than 
that 
we 
have 
of 
the 
body, 
it 
must 
be 
remarked, 
as 
a 
matter 
that 
is 
highly 
manifest 
by 
the 
natural 
light, 
that 
to 
nothing 
no 
affections 
or 
qualities 
belong; 
and, 
accordingly, 
that 
where 
we 
observe 
certain 
affections, 
there 
a 
thing 
or 
substance 
to 
which 
these 
pertain, 
is 
necessarily 
found. 
The 
same 
light 
also 
shows 
us 
that 
we 
know 
a 
thing 
or 
substance 
more 
clearly 
in 
proportion 
as 
we 
discover 
in 
it 
a 
greater 
number 
of 
qualities. 
Now, 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
we 
remark 
a 
greater 
number 
of 
qualities 
in 
our 
mind 
than 
in 
any 
other 
thing; 
for 
there 
is 
no 
occasion 
on 
which 
we 
know 
anything 
whatever 
when 
we 
are 
not 
at 
the 
same 
time 
led 
with 
much 
greater 
certainty 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
our 
own 
mind. 
For 
example, 
if 
I 
judge 
that 
there 
is 
an 
earth 
because 
I 
touch 
or 
see 
it, 
on 
the 
same 
ground, 
and 
with 
still 
greater 
reason, 
I 
must 
be 
persuaded 
that 
my 
mind 
exists; 
for 
it 
may 
be, 
perhaps, 
that 
I 
think 
I 
touch 
the 
earth 
while 
there 
is 
one 
in 
existence; 
but 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
that 
I 
should 
so 
judge, 
and 
my 



mind 
which 
thus 
judges 
not 
exist; 
and 
the 
same 
holds 
good 
of 
whatever 
object 
is 
presented 
to 
our 
mind. 


XII. 
How 
it 
happens 
that 
every 
one 
does 
not 
come 
equally 
to 
know 
this. 
Those 
who 
have 
not 
philosophized 
in 
order 
have 
had 
other 
opinions 
on 
this 
subject, 
because 
they 
never 
distinguished 
with 
sufficient 
care 
the 
mind 
from 
the 
body. 
For, 
although 
they 
had 
no 
difficulty 
in 
believing 
that 
they 
themselves 
existed, 
and 
that 
they 
had 
a 
higher 
assurance 
of 
this 
than 
of 
any 
other 
thing, 
nevertheless, 
as 
they 
did 
not 
observe 
that 
by 
THEMSELVES, 
they 
ought 
here 
to 
understand 
their 
MINDS 
alone 
[when 
the 
question 
related 
to 
metaphysical 
certainty]; 
and 
since, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
they 
rather 
meant 
their 
bodies 
which 
they 
saw 
with 
their 
eyes, 
touched 
with 
their 
hands, 
and 
to 
which 
they 
erroneously 
attributed 
the 
faculty 
of 
perception, 
they 
were 
prevented 
from 
distinctly 
apprehending 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
mind. 


XIII. 
In 
what 
sense 
the 
knowledge 
of 
other 
things 
depends 
upon 
the 
knowledge 
of 
God. 
But 
when 
the 
mind, 
which 
thus 
knows 
itself 
but 
is 
still 
in 
doubt 
as 
to 
all 
other 
things, 
looks 
around 
on 
all 
sides, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
the 
farther 
extension 
of 
its 
knowledge, 
it 
first 
of 
all 
discovers 
within 
itself 
the 
ideas 
of 
many 
things; 
and 
while 
it 
simply 
contemplates 
them, 
and 
neither 
affirms 
nor 
denies 
that 
there 
is 
anything 
beyond 
itself 
corresponding 
to 
them, 
it 
is 
in 
no 
danger 
of 
erring. 
The 
mind 
also 
discovers 
certain 
common 
notions 
out 
of 
which 
it 
frames 
various 
demonstrations 
that 
carry 
conviction 
to 
such 
a 
degree 
as 
to 
render 
doubt 
of 
their 
truth 
impossible, 
so 
long 
as 
we 
give 
attention 
to 
them. 
For 
example, 
the 
mind 
has 
within 
itself 
ideas 
of 
numbers 
and 
figures, 
and 
it 
has 
likewise 
among 
its 
common 
notions 
the 
principle 
THAT 
IF 
EQUALS 
BE 
ADDED 
TO 
EQUALS 
THE 
WHOLES 
WILL 
BE 
EQUAL 
and 
the 
like; 
from 
which 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
the 
three 
angles 
of 
a 
triangle 
are 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles, 
etc. 
Now, 
so 
long 
as 
we 
attend 
to 
the 
premises 
from 
which 
this 
conclusion 
and 
others 
similar 
to 
it 
were 
deduced, 
we 
feel 
assured 
of 
their 
truth; 
but, 
as 
the 
mind 
cannot 
always 
think 
of 
these 
with 
attention, 
when 
it 
has 
the 
remembrance 
of 
a 
conclusion 
without 
recollecting 
the 
order 
of 
its 
deduction, 
and 
is 
uncertain 
whether 
the 
author 
of 
its 
being 
has 
created 
it 
of 
a 
nature 
that 
is 
liable 
to 
be 
deceived, 
even 
in 
what 
appears 
most 
evident, 
it 



perceives 
that 
there 
is 
just 
ground 
to 
distrust 
the 
truth 
of 
such 
conclusions, 
and 
that 
it 
cannot 
possess 
any 
certain 
knowledge 
until 
it 
has 
discovered 
its 
author. 


XIV. 
That 
we 
may 
validly 
infer 
the 
existence 
of 
God 
from 
necessary 
existence 
being 
comprised 
in 
the 
concept 
we 
have 
of 
him. 
When 
the 
mind 
afterwards 
reviews 
the 
different 
ideas 
that 
are 
in 
it, 
it 
discovers 
what 
is 
by 
far 
the 
chief 
among 
them—that 
of 
a 
Being 
omniscient, 
all-powerful, 
and 
absolutely 
perfect; 
and 
it 
observes 
that 
in 
this 
idea 
there 
is 
contained 
not 
only 
possible 
and 
contingent 
existence, 
as 
in 
the 
ideas 
of 
all 
other 
things 
which 
it 
clearly 
perceives, 
but 
existence 
absolutely 
necessary 
and 
eternal. 
And 
just 
as 
because, 
for 
example, 
the 
equality 
of 
its 
three 
angles 
to 
two 
right 
angles 
is 
necessarily 
comprised 
in 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
triangle, 
the 
mind 
is 
firmly 
persuaded 
that 
the 
three 
angles 
of 
a 
triangle 
are 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles; 
so, 
from 
its 
perceiving 
necessary 
and 
eternal 
existence 
to 
be 
comprised 
in 
the 
idea 
which 
it 
has 
of 
an 
all-perfect 
Being, 
it 
ought 
manifestly 
to 
conclude 
that 
this 
all-perfect 
Being 
exists. 


XV. 
That 
necessary 
existence 
is 
not 
in 
the 
same 
way 
comprised 
in 
the 
notions 
which 
we 
have 
of 
other 
things, 
but 
merely 
contingent 
existence. 
The 
mind 
will 
be 
still 
more 
certain 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
this 
conclusion, 
if 
it 
consider 
that 
it 
has 
no 
idea 
of 
any 
other 
thing 
in 
which 
it 
can 
discover 
that 
necessary 
existence 
is 
contained; 
for, 
from 
this 
circumstance 
alone, 
it 
will 
discern 
that 
the 
idea 
of 
an 
all-perfect 
Being 
has 
not 
been 
framed 
by 
itself, 
and 
that 
it 
does 
not 
represent 
a 
chimera, 
but 
a 
true 
and 
immutable 
nature, 
which 
must 
exist 
since 
it 
can 
only 
be 
conceived 
as 
necessarily 
existing. 


XVI. 
That 
prejudices 
hinder 
many 
from 
clearly 
knowing 
the 
necessity 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
God. 
Our 
mind 
would 
have 
no 
difficulty 
in 
assenting 
to 
this 
truth, 
if 
it 
were, 
first 
of 
all, 
wholly 
free 
from 
prejudices; 
but 
as 
we 
have 
been 
accustomed 
to 
distinguish, 
in 
all 
other 
things, 
essence 
from 
existence, 
and 
to 
imagine 
at 
will 
many 
ideas 
of 
things 
which 
neither 
are 
nor 
have 
been, 
it 
easily 
happens, 
when 
we 
do 
not 
steadily 
fix 
our 
thoughts 
on 
the 
contemplation 
of 
the 
all-perfect 
Being, 
that 
a 
doubt 
arises 
as 
to 
whether 
the 
idea 
we 
have 
of 
him 
is 
not 
one 
of 



those 
which 
we 
frame 
at 
pleasure, 
or 
at 
least 
of 
that 
class 
to 
whose 
essence 
existence 
does 
not 
pertain. 


XVII. 
That 
the 
greater 
objective 
(representative) 
perfection 
there 
is 
in 
our 
idea 
of 
a 
thing, 
the 
greater 
also 
must 
be 
the 
perfection 
of 
its 
cause. 
When 
we 
further 
reflect 
on 
the 
various 
ideas 
that 
are 
in 
us, 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
perceive 
that 
there 
is 
not 
much 
difference 
among 
them, 
when 
we 
consider 
them 
simply 
as 
certain 
modes 
of 
thinking, 
but 
that 
they 
are 
widely 
different, 
considered 
in 
reference 
to 
the 
objects 
they 
represent; 
and 
that 
their 
causes 
must 
be 
so 
much 
the 
more 
perfect 
according 
to 
the 
degree 
of 
objective 
perfection 
contained 
in 
them. 
[Footnote: 
"as 
what 
they 
represent 
of 
their 
object 
has 
more 
perfection."—FRENCH.] 
For 
there 
is 
no 
difference 
between 
this 
and 
the 
case 
of 
a 
person 
who 
has 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
machine, 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
which 
great 
skill 
is 
displayed, 
in 
which 
circumstances 
we 
have 
a 
right 
to 
inquire 
how 
he 
came 
by 
this 
idea, 
whether, 
for 
example, 
he 
somewhere 
saw 
such 
a 
machine 
constructed 
by 
another, 
or 
whether 
he 
was 
so 
accurately 
taught 
the 
mechanical 
sciences, 
or 
is 
endowed 
with 
such 
force 
of 
genius, 
that 
he 
was 
able 
of 
himself 
to 
invent 
it, 
without 
having 
elsewhere 
seen 
anything 
like 
it; 
for 
all 
the 
ingenuity 
which 
is 
contained 
in 
the 
idea 
objectively 
only, 
or 
as 
it 
were 
in 
a 
picture, 
must 
exist 
at 
least 
in 
its 
first 
and 
chief 
cause, 
whatever 
that 
may 
be, 
not 
only 
objectively 
or 
representatively, 
but 
in 
truth 
formally 
or 
eminently. 


XVIII. 
That 
the 
existence 
of 
God 
may 
be 
again 
inferred 
from 
the 
above. 
Thus, 
because 
we 
discover 
in 
our 
minds 
the 
idea 
of 
God, 
or 
of 
an 
all-perfect 
Being, 
we 
have 
a 
right 
to 
inquire 
into 
the 
source 
whence 
we 
derive 
it; 
and 
we 
will 
discover 
that 
the 
perfections 
it 
represents 
are 
so 
immense 
as 
to 
render 
it 
quite 
certain 
that 
we 
could 
only 
derive 
it 
from 
an 
all-perfect 
Being; 
that 
is, 
from 
a 
God 
really 
existing. 
For 
it 
is 
not 
only 
manifest 
by 
the 
natural 
light 
that 
nothing 
cannot 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
anything 
whatever, 
and 
that 
the 
more 
perfect 
cannot 
arise 
from 
the 
less 
perfect, 
so 
as 
to 
be 
thereby 
produced 
as 
by 
its 
efficient 
and 
total 
cause, 
but 
also 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
we 
can 
have 
the 
idea 
or 
representation 
of 
anything 
whatever, 
unless 
there 
be 
somewhere, 
either 
in 
us 
or 
out 
of 
us, 
an 
original 
which 
comprises, 
in 
reality, 
all 
the 
perfections 
that 
are 
thus 
represented 
to 
us; 
but, 
as 
we 
do 
not 
in 
any 
way 
find 
in 
ourselves 



those 
absolute 
perfections 
of 
which 
we 
have 
the 
idea, 
we 
must 
conclude 
that 
they 
exist 
in 
some 
nature 
different 
from 
ours, 
that 
is, 
in 
God, 
or 
at 
least 
that 
they 
were 
once 
in 
him; 
and 
it 
most 
manifestly 
follows 
[from 
their 
infinity] 
that 
they 
are 
still 
there. 


XIX. 
That, 
although 
we 
may 
not 
comprehend 
the 
nature 
of 
God, 
there 
is 
yet 
nothing 
which 
we 
know 
so 
clearly 
as 
his 
perfections. 
This 
will 
appear 
sufficiently 
certain 
and 
manifest 
to 
those 
who 
have 
been 
accustomed 
to 
contemplate 
the 
idea 
of 
God, 
and 
to 
turn 
their 
thoughts 
to 
his 
infinite 
perfections; 
for, 
although 
we 
may 
not 
comprehend 
them, 
because 
it 
is 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
infinite 
not 
to 
be 
comprehended 
by 
what 
is 
finite, 
we 
nevertheless 
conceive 
them 
more 
clearly 
and 
distinctly 
than 
material 
objects, 
for 
this 
reason, 
that, 
being 
simple, 
and 
unobscured 
by 
limits,[Footnote: 
After 
LIMITS, 
"what 
of 
them 
we 
do 
conceive 
is 
much 
less 
confused. 
There 
is, 
besides, 
no 
speculation 
more 
calculated 
to 
aid 
in 
perfecting 
our 
understanding, 
and 
which 
is 
more 
important 
than 
this, 
inasmuch 
as 
the 
consideration 
of 
an 
object 
that 
has 
no 
limits 
to 
its 
perfections 
fills 
us 
with 
satisfaction 
and 
assurance."-FRENCH.] 
they 
occupy 
our 
mind 
more 
fully. 


XX. 
That 
we 
are 
not 
the 
cause 
of 
ourselves, 
but 
that 
this 
is 
God, 
and 
consequently 
that 
there 
is 
a 
God. 
But, 
because 
every 
one 
has 
not 
observed 
this, 
and 
because, 
when 
we 
have 
an 
idea 
of 
any 
machine 
in 
which 
great 
skill 
is 
displayed, 
we 
usually 
know 
with 
sufficient 
accuracy 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
we 
obtained 
it, 
and 
as 
we 
cannot 
even 
recollect 
when 
the 
idea 
we 
have 
of 
a 
God 
was 
communicated 
to 
us 
by 
him, 
seeing 
it 
was 
always 
in 
our 
minds, 
it 
is 
still 
necessary 
that 
we 
should 
continue 
our 
review, 
and 
make 
inquiry 
after 
our 
author, 
possessing, 
as 
we 
do, 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
infinite 
perfections 
of 
a 
God: 
for 
it 
is 
in 
the 
highest 
degree 
evident 
by 
the 
natural 
light, 
that 
that 
which 
knows 
something 
more 
perfect 
than 
itself, 
is 
not 
the 
source 
of 
its 
own 
being, 
since 
it 
would 
thus 
have 
given 
to 
itself 
all 
the 
perfections 
which 
it 
knows; 
and 
that, 
consequently, 
it 
could 
draw 
its 
origin 
from 
no 
other 
being 
than 
from 
him 
who 
possesses 
in 
himself 
all 
those 
perfections, 
that 
is, 
from 
God. 


XXI. 
That 
the 
duration 
alone 
of 
our 
life 
is 
sufficient 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
existence 
of 
God. 

The 
truth 
of 
this 
demonstration 
will 
clearly 
appear, 
provided 
we 
consider 
the 
nature 
of 
time, 
or 
the 
duration 
of 
things; 
for 
this 
is 
of 
such 
a 
kind 
that 
its 
parts 
are 
not 
mutually 
dependent, 
and 
never 
co-existent; 
and, 
accordingly, 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
now 
are, 
it 
does 
not 
necessarily 
follow 
that 
we 
shall 
be 
a 
moment 
afterwards, 
unless 
some 
cause, 
viz., 
that 
which 
first 
produced 
us, 
shall, 
as 
it 
were, 
continually 
reproduce 
us, 
that 
is, 
conserve 
us. 
For 
we 
easily 
understand 
that 
there 
is 
no 
power 
in 
us 
by 
which 
we 
can 
conserve 
ourselves, 
and 
that 
the 
being 
who 
has 
so 
much 
power 
as 
to 
conserve 
us 
out 
of 
himself, 
must 
also 
by 
so 
much 
the 
greater 
reason 
conserve 
himself, 
or 
rather 
stand 
in 
need 
of 
being 
conserved 
by 
no 
one 
whatever, 
and, 
in 
fine, 
be 
God. 


XXII. 
That 
in 
knowing 
the 
existence 
of 
God, 
in 
the 
manner 
here 
explained, 
we 
likewise 
know 
all 
his 
attributes, 
as 
far 
as 
they 
can 
be 
known 
by 
the 
natural 
light 
alone. 
There 
is 
the 
great 
advantage 
in 
proving 
the 
existence 
of 
God 
in 
this 
way, 
viz., 
by 
his 
idea, 
that 
we 
at 
the 
same 
time 
know 
what 
he 
is, 
as 
far 
as 
the 
weakness 
of 
our 
nature 
allows; 
for, 
reflecting 
on 
the 
idea 
we 
have 
of 
him 
which 
is 
born 
with 
us, 
we 
perceive 
that 
he 
is 
eternal, 
omniscient, 
omnipotent, 
the 
source 
of 
all 
goodness 
and 
truth, 
creator 
of 
all 
things, 
and 
that, 
in 
fine, 
he 
has 
in 
himself 
all 
that 
in 
which 
we 
can 
clearly 
discover 
any 
infinite 
perfection 
or 
good 
that 
is 
not 
limited 
by 
any 
imperfection. 


XXIII. 
That 
God 
is 
not 
corporeal, 
and 
does 
not 
perceive 
by 
means 
of 
senses 
as 
we 
do, 
or 
will 
the 
evil 
of 
sin. 
For 
there 
are 
indeed 
many 
things 
in 
the 
world 
that 
are 
to 
a 
certain 
extent 
imperfect 
or 
limited, 
though 
possessing 
also 
some 
perfection; 
and 
it 
is 
accordingly 
impossible 
that 
any 
such 
can 
be 
in 
God. 
Thus, 
looking 
to 
corporeal 
nature,[Footnote: 
In 
the 
French, 
"since 
extension 
constitutes 
the 
nature 
of 
body."] 
since 
divisibility 
is 
included 
in 
local 
extension, 
and 
this 
indicates 
imperfection, 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
God 
is 
not 
body. 
And 
although 
in 
men 
it 
is 
to 
some 
degree 
a 
perfection 
to 
be 
capable 
of 
perceiving 
by 
means 
of 
the 
senses, 
nevertheless 
since 
in 
every 
sense 
there 
is 
passivity 
[Footnote: 
In 
the 
French, 
"because 
our 
perceptions 
arise 
from 
impressions 
made 
upon 
us 
from 
another 
source," 
i.e., 
than 
ourselves.] 
which 
indicates 
dependency, 
we 
must 
conclude 
that 
God 
is 
in 
no 
manner 
possessed 
of 
senses, 
and 
that 
he 
only 



understands 
and 
wills, 
not, 
however, 
like 
us, 
by 
acts 
in 
any 
way 
distinct, 
but 
always 
by 
an 
act 
that 
is 
one, 
identical, 
and 
the 
simplest 
possible, 
understands, 
wills, 
and 
operates 
all, 
that 
is, 
all 
things 
that 
in 
reality 
exist; 
for 
he 
does 
not 
will 
the 
evil 
of 
sin, 
seeing 
this 
is 
but 
the 
negation 
of 
being. 


XXIV. 
That 
in 
passing 
from 
the 
knowledge 
of 
God 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
creatures, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
remember 
that 
our 
understanding 
is 
finite, 
and 
the 
power 
of 
God 
infinite. 
But 
as 
we 
know 
that 
God 
alone 
is 
the 
true 
cause 
of 
all 
that 
is 
or 
can 
be, 
we 
will 
doubtless 
follow 
the 
best 
way 
of 
philosophizing, 
if, 
from 
the 
knowledge 
we 
have 
of 
God 
himself, 
we 
pass 
to 
the 
explication 
of 
the 
things 
which 
he 
has 
created, 
and 
essay 
to 
deduce 
it 
from 
the 
notions 
that 
are 
naturally 
in 
our 
minds, 
for 
we 
will 
thus 
obtain 
the 
most 
perfect 
science, 
that 
is, 
the 
knowledge 
of 
effects 
through 
their 
causes. 
But 
that 
we 
may 
be 
able 
to 
make 
this 
attempt 
with 
sufficient 
security 
from 
error, 
we 
must 
use 
the 
precaution 
to 
bear 
in 
mind 
as 
much 
as 
possible 
that 
God, 
who 
is 
the 
author 
of 
things, 
is 
infinite, 
while 
we 
are 
wholly 
finite. 


XXV. 
That 
we 
must 
believe 
all 
that 
God 
has 
revealed, 
although 
it 
may 
surpass 
the 
reach 
of 
our 
faculties. 
Thus, 
if 
perhaps 
God 
reveal 
to 
us 
or 
others, 
matters 
concerning 
himself 
which 
surpass 
the 
natural 
powers 
of 
our 
mind, 
such 
as 
the 
mysteries 
of 
the 
incarnation 
and 
of 
the 
trinity, 
we 
will 
not 
refuse 
to 
believe 
them, 
although 
we 
may 
not 
clearly 
understand 
them; 
nor 
will 
we 
be 
in 
any 
way 
surprised 
to 
find 
in 
the 
immensity 
of 
his 
nature, 
or 
even 
in 
what 
he 
has 
created, 
many 
things 
that 
exceed 
our 
comprehension. 


XXVI. 
That 
it 
is 
not 
needful 
to 
enter 
into 
disputes 
[Footnote: 
"to 
essay 
to 
comprehend 
the 
infinite."—FRENCH.] 
regarding 
the 
infinite, 
but 
merely 
to 
hold 
all 
that 
in 
which 
we 
can 
find 
no 
limits 
as 
indefinite, 
such 
as 
the 
extension 
of 
the 
world, 
the 
divisibility 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
matter, 
the 
number 
of 
the 
stars, 
etc. 
We 
will 
thus 
never 
embarrass 
ourselves 
by 
disputes 
about 
the 
infinite, 
seeing 
it 
would 
be 
absurd 
for 
us 
who 
are 
finite 
to 
undertake 
to 
determine 
anything 
regarding 
it, 
and 
thus 
as 
it 
were 
to 
limit 
it 
by 
endeavouring 
to 
comprehend 
it. 



We 
will 
accordingly 
give 
ourselves 
no 
concern 
to 
reply 
to 
those 
who 
demand 
whether 
the 
half 
of 
an 
infinite 
line 
is 
also 
infinite, 
and 
whether 
an 
infinite 
number 
is 
even 
or 
odd, 
and 
the 
like, 
because 
it 
is 
only 
such 
as 
imagine 
their 
minds 
to 
be 
infinite 
who 
seem 
bound 
to 
entertain 
questions 
of 
this 
sort. 
And, 
for 
our 
part, 
looking 
to 
all 
those 
things 
in 
which 
in 
certain 
senses, 
we 
discover 
no 
limits, 
we 
will 
not, 
therefore, 
affirm 
that 
they 
are 
infinite, 
but 
will 
regard 
them 
simply 
as 
indefinite. 
Thus, 
because 
we 
cannot 
imagine 
extension 
so 
great 
that 
we 
cannot 
still 
conceive 
greater, 
we 
will 
say 
that 
the 
magnitude 
of 
possible 
things 
is 
indefinite, 
and 
because 
a 
body 
cannot 
be 
divided 
into 
parts 
so 
small 
that 
each 
of 
these 
may 
not 
be 
conceived 
as 
again 
divided 
into 
others 
still 
smaller, 
let 
us 
regard 
quantity 
as 
divisible 
into 
parts 
whose 
number 
is 
indefinite; 
and 
as 
we 
cannot 
imagine 
so 
many 
stars 
that 
it 
would 
seem 
impossible 
for 
God 
to 
create 
more, 
let 
us 
suppose 
that 
their 
number 
is 
indefinite, 
and 
so 
in 
other 
instances. 


XXVII. 
What 
difference 
there 
is 
between 
the 
indefinite 
and 
the 
infinite. 
And 
we 
will 
call 
those 
things 
indefinite 
rather 
than 
infinite, 
with 
the 
view 
of 
reserving 
to 
God 
alone 
the 
appellation 
of 
infinite; 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
because 
not 
only 
do 
we 
discover 
in 
him 
alone 
no 
limits 
on 
any 
side, 
but 
also 
because 
we 
positively 
conceive 
that 
he 
admits 
of 
none; 
and 
in 
the 
second 
place, 
because 
we 
do 
not 
in 
the 
same 
way 
positively 
conceive 
that 
other 
things 
are 
in 
every 
part 
unlimited, 
but 
merely 
negatively 
admit 
that 
their 
limits, 
if 
they 
have 
any, 
cannot 
be 
discovered 
by 
us. 


XXVIII. 
That 
we 
must 
examine, 
not 
the 
final, 
but 
the 
efficient, 
causes 
of 
created 
things. 
Likewise, 
finally, 
we 
will 
not 
seek 
reasons 
of 
natural 
things 
from 
the 
end 
which 
God 
or 
nature 
proposed 
to 
himself 
in 
their 
creation 
(i. 
e., 
final 
causes), 
[Footnote: 
"We 
will 
not 
stop 
to 
consider 
the 
ends 
which 
God 
proposed 
to 
himself 
in 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
world, 
and 
we 
will 
entirely 
reject 
from 
our 
philosophy 
the 
search 
of 
final 
causes!"—French.] 
for 
we 
ought 
not 
to 
presume 
so 
far 
as 
to 
think 
that 
we 
are 
sharers 
in 
the 
counsels 
of 
Deity, 
but, 
considering 
him 
as 
the 
efficient 
cause 
of 
all 
things, 
let 
us 
endeavour 
to 
discover 
by 
the 
natural 
light 
[Footnote: 
"Faculty 
of 
reasoning."—FRENCH.] 
which 
he 
has 
planted 
in 
us, 
applied 
to 
those 
of 
his 
attributes 
of 
which 
he 
has 



been 
willing 
we 
should 
have 
some 
knowledge, 
what 
must 
be 
concluded 
regarding 
those 
effects 
we 
perceive 
by 
our 
senses; 
bearing 
in 
mind, 
however, 
what 
has 
been 
already 
said, 
that 
we 
must 
only 
confide 
in 
this 
natural 
light 
so 
long 
as 
nothing 
contrary 
to 
its 
dictates 
is 
revealed 
by 
God 
himself. 
[Footnote: 
The 
last 
clause, 
beginning 
"bearing 
in 
mind." 
is 
omitted 
in 
the 
French.] 


XXIX. 
That 
God 
is 
not 
the 
cause 
of 
our 
errors. 
The 
first 
attribute 
of 
God 
which 
here 
falls 
to 
be 
considered, 
is 
that 
he 
is 
absolutely 
veracious 
and 
the 
source 
of 
all 
light, 
so 
that 
it 
is 
plainly 
repugnant 
for 
him 
to 
deceive 
us, 
or 
to 
be 
properly 
and 
positively 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
errors 
to 
which 
we 
are 
consciously 
subject; 
for 
although 
the 
address 
to 
deceive 
seems 
to 
be 
some 
mark 
of 
subtlety 
of 
mind 
among 
men, 
yet 
without 
doubt 
the 
will 
to 
deceive 
only 
proceeds 
from 
malice 
or 
from 
fear 
and 
weakness, 
and 
consequently 
cannot 
be 
attributed 
to 
God. 


XXX. 
That 
consequently 
all 
which 
we 
clearly 
perceive 
is 
true, 
and 
that 
we 
are 
thus 
delivered 
from 
the 
doubts 
above 
proposed. 
Whence 
it 
follows, 
that 
the 
light 
of 
nature, 
or 
faculty 
of 
knowledge 
given 
us 
by 
God, 
can 
never 
compass 
any 
object 
which 
is 
not 
true, 
in 
as 
far 
as 
it 
attains 
to 
a 
knowledge 
of 
it, 
that 
is, 
in 
as 
far 
as 
the 
object 
is 
clearly 
and 
distinctly 
apprehended. 
For 
God 
would 
have 
merited 
the 
appellation 
of 
a 
deceiver 
if 
he 
had 
given 
us 
this 
faculty 
perverted, 
and 
such 
as 
might 
lead 
us 
to 
take 
falsity 
for 
truth 
[when 
we 
used 
it 
aright]. 
Thus 
the 
highest 
doubt 
is 
removed, 
which 
arose 
from 
our 
ignorance 
on 
the 
point 
as 
to 
whether 
perhaps 
our 
nature 
was 
such 
that 
we 
might 
be 
deceived 
even 
in 
those 
things 
that 
appear 
to 
us 
the 
most 
evident. 
The 
same 
principle 
ought 
also 
to 
be 
of 
avail 
against 
all 
the 
other 
grounds 
of 
doubting 
that 
have 
been 
already 
enumerated. 
For 
mathematical 
truths 
ought 
now 
to 
be 
above 
suspicion, 
since 
these 
are 
of 
the 
clearest. 
And 
if 
we 
perceive 
anything 
by 
our 
senses, 
whether 
while 
awake 
or 
asleep, 
we 
will 
easily 
discover 
the 
truth 
provided 
we 
separate 
what 
there 
is 
of 
clear 
and 
distinct 
in 
the 
knowledge 
from 
what 
is 
obscure 
and 
confused. 
There 
is 
no 
need 
that 
I 
should 
here 
say 
more 
on 
this 
subject, 
since 
it 
has 
already 
received 
ample 
treatment 
in 
the 
metaphysical 
Meditations; 
and 
what 
follows 
will 
serve 
to 
explain 
it 
still 
more 
accurately. 


XXXI. 
That 
our 
errors 
are, 
in 
respect 
of 
God, 
merely 
negations, 
but, 
in 

respect 
of 
ourselves, 
privations. 


But 
as 
it 
happens 
that 
we 
frequently 
fall 
into 
error, 
although 
God 
is 
no 
deceiver, 
if 
we 
desire 
to 
inquire 
into 
the 
origin 
and 
cause 
of 
our 
errors, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
guard 
against 
them, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
observe 
that 
they 
depend 
less 
on 
our 
understanding 
than 
on 
our 
will, 
and 
that 
they 
have 
no 
need 
of 
the 
actual 
concourse 
of 
God, 
in 
order 
to 
their 
production; 
so 
that, 
when 
considered 
in 
reference 
to 
God, 
they 
are 
merely 
negations, 
but 
in 
reference 
to 
ourselves, 
privations. 


XXXII. 
That 
there 
are 
only 
two 
modes 
of 
thinking 
in 
us, 
viz., 
the 
perception 
of 
the 
understanding 
and 
the 
action 
of 
the 
will. 
For 
all 
the 
modes 
of 
thinking 
of 
which 
we 
are 
conscious 
may 
be 
referred 
to 
two 
general 
classes, 
the 
one 
of 
which 
is 
the 
perception 
or 
operation 
of 
the 
understanding, 
and 
the 
other 
the 
volition 
or 
operation 
of 
the 
will. 
Thus, 
to 
perceive 
by 
the 
senses 
(SENTIRE), 
to 
imagine, 
and 
to 
conceive 
things 
purely 
intelligible, 
are 
only 
different 
modes 
of 
perceiving 
(PERCIP 
IENDI); 
but 
to 
desire, 
to 
be 
averse 
from, 
to 
affirm, 
to 
deny, 
to 
doubt, 
are 
different 
modes 
of 
willing. 


XXXIII. 
That 
we 
never 
err 
unless 
when 
we 
judge 
of 
something 
which 
we 
do 
not 
sufficiently 
apprehend. 
When 
we 
apprehend 
anything 
we 
are 
in 
no 
danger 
of 
error, 
if 
we 
refrain 
from 
judging 
of 
it 
in 
any 
way; 
and 
even 
when 
we 
have 
formed 
a 
judgment 
regarding 
it, 
we 
would 
never 
fall 
into 
error, 
provided 
we 
gave 
our 
assent 
only 
to 
what 
we 
clearly 
and 
distinctly 
perceived; 
but 
the 
reason 
why 
we 
are 
usually 
deceived, 
is 
that 
we 
judge 
without 
possessing 
an 
exact 
knowledge 
of 
that 
of 
which 
we 
judge. 


XXXIV. 
That 
the 
will 
as 
well 
as 
the 
understanding 
is 
required 
for 
judging. 
I 
admit 
that 
the 
understanding 
is 
necessary 
for 
judging, 
there 
being 
no 
room 
to 
suppose 
that 
we 
can 
judge 
of 
that 
which 
we 
in 
no 
way 
apprehend; 
but 
the 
will 
also 
is 
required 
in 
order 
to 
our 
assenting 
to 
what 
we 
have 
in 
any 
degree 
perceived. 
It 
is 
not 
necessary, 
however, 
at 
least 
to 
form 
any 
judgment 
whatever, 
that 
we 
have 
an 
entire 
and 
perfect 
apprehension 
of 
a 
thing; 
for 
we 
may 
assent 
to 
many 
things 
of 
which 
we 
have 
only 
a 
very 
obscure 
and 



confused 
knowledge. 


XXXV. 
That 
the 
will 
is 
of 
greater 
extension 
than 
the 
understanding, 
and 
is 
thus 
the 
source 
of 
our 
errors. 
Further, 
the 
perception 
of 
the 
intellect 
extends 
only 
to 
the 
few 
things 
that 
are 
presented 
to 
it, 
and 
is 
always 
very 
limited: 
the 
will, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
may, 
in 
a 
certain 
sense, 
be 
said 
to 
be 
infinite, 
because 
we 
observe 
nothing 
that 
can 
be 
the 
object 
of 
the 
will 
of 
any 
other, 
even 
of 
the 
unlimited 
will 
of 
God, 
to 
which 
ours 
cannot 
also 
extend, 
so 
that 
we 
easily 
carry 
it 
beyond 
the 
objects 
we 
clearly 
perceive; 
and 
when 
we 
do 
this, 
it 
is 
not 
wonderful 
that 
we 
happen 
to 
be 
deceived. 


XXXVI. 
That 
our 
errors 
cannot 
be 
imputed 
to 
God. 
But 
although 
God 
has 
not 
given 
us 
an 
omniscient 
understanding, 
he 
is 
not 
on 
this 
account 
to 
be 
considered 
in 
any 
wise 
the 
author 
of 
our 
errors, 
for 
it 
is 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
created 
intellect 
to 
be 
finite, 
and 
of 
finite 
intellect 
not 
to 
embrace 
all 
things. 


XXXVII. 
That 
the 
chief 
perfection 
of 
man 
is 
his 
being 
able 
to 
act 
freely 
or 
by 
will, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
this 
which 
renders 
him 
worthy 
of 
praise 
or 
blame. 
That 
the 
will 
should 
be 
the 
more 
extensive 
is 
in 
harmony 
with 
its 
nature: 
and 
it 
is 
a 
high 
perfection 
in 
man 
to 
be 
able 
to 
act 
by 
means 
of 
it, 
that 
is, 
freely; 
and 
thus 
in 
a 
peculiar 
way 
to 
be 
the 
master 
of 
his 
own 
actions, 
and 
merit 
praise 
or 
blame. 
For 
self-acting 
machines 
are 
not 
commended 
because 
they 
perform 
with 
exactness 
all 
the 
movements 
for 
which 
they 
were 
adapted, 
seeing 
their 
motions 
are 
carried 
on 
necessarily; 
but 
the 
maker 
of 
them 
is 
praised 
on 
account 
of 
the 
exactness 
with 
which 
they 
were 
framed, 
because 
he 
did 
not 
act 
of 
necessity, 
but 
freely; 
and, 
on 
the 
same 
principle, 
we 
must 
attribute 
to 
ourselves 
something 
more 
on 
this 
account, 
that 
when 
we 
embrace 
truth, 
we 
do 
so 
not 
of 
necessity, 
but 
freely. 


XXXVIII. 
That 
error 
is 
a 
defect 
in 
our 
mode 
of 
acting, 
not 
in 
our 
nature; 
and 
that 
the 
faults 
of 
their 
subjects 
may 
be 
frequently 
attributed 
to 
other 
masters, 
but 
never 
to 
God. 
It 
is 
true, 
that 
as 
often 
as 
we 
err, 
there 
is 
some 
defect 
in 
our 
mode 
of 
action 
or 



in 
the 
use 
of 
our 
liberty, 
but 
not 
in 
our 
nature, 
because 
this 
is 
always 
the 
same, 
whether 
our 
judgments 
be 
true 
or 
false. 
And 
although 
God 
could 
have 
given 
to 
us 
such 
perspicacity 
of 
intellect 
that 
we 
should 
never 
have 
erred, 
we 
have, 
notwithstanding, 
no 
right 
to 
demand 
this 
of 
him; 
for, 
although 
with 
us 
he 
who 
was 
able 
to 
prevent 
evil 
and 
did 
not 
is 
held 
guilty 
of 
it, 
God 
is 
not 
in 
the 
same 
way 
to 
be 
reckoned 
responsible 
for 
our 
errors 
because 
he 
had 
the 
power 
to 
prevent 
them, 
inasmuch 
as 
the 
dominion 
which 
some 
men 
possess 
over 
others 
has 
been 
instituted 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
enabling 
them 
to 
hinder 
those 
under 
them 
from 
doing 
evil, 
whereas 
the 
dominion 
which 
God 
exercises 
over 
the 
universe 
is 
perfectly 
absolute 
and 
free. 
For 
this 
reason 
we 
ought 
to 
thank 
him 
for 
the 
goods 
he 
has 
given 
us, 
and 
not 
complain 
that 
he 
has 
not 
blessed 
us 
with 
all 
which 
we 
know 
it 
was 
in 
his 
power 
to 
impart. 


XXXIX. 
That 
the 
liberty 
of 
our 
will 
is 
self-evident. 
Finally, 
it 
is 
so 
manifest 
that 
we 
possess 
a 
free 
will, 
capable 
of 
giving 
or 
withholding 
its 
assent, 
that 
this 
truth 
must 
be 
reckoned 
among 
the 
first 
and 
most 
common 
notions 
which 
are 
born 
with 
us. 
This, 
indeed, 
has 
already 
very 
clearly 
appeared, 
for 
when 
essaying 
to 
doubt 
of 
all 
things, 
we 
went 
so 
far 
as 
to 
suppose 
even 
that 
he 
who 
created 
us 
employed 
his 
limitless 
power 
in 
deceiving 
us 
in 
every 
way, 
we 
were 
conscious 
nevertheless 
of 
being 
free 
to 
abstain 
from 
believing 
what 
was 
not 
in 
every 
respect 
certain 
and 
undoubted. 
Bat 
that 
of 
which 
we 
are 
unable 
to 
doubt 
at 
such 
a 
time 
is 
as 
self-evident 
and 
clear 
as 
any 
thing 
we 
can 
ever 
know. 


XL. 
That 
it 
is 
likewise 
certain 
that 
God 
has 
fore-ordained 
all 
things. 
But 
because 
what 
we 
have 
already 
discovered 
of 
God, 
gives 
us 
the 
assurance 
that 
his 
power 
is 
so 
immense 
that 
we 
would 
sin 
in 
thinking 
ourselves 
capable 
of 
ever 
doing 
anything 
which 
he 
had 
not 
ordained 
beforehand, 
we 
should 
soon 
be 
embarrassed 
in 
great 
difficulties 
if 
we 
undertook 
to 
harmonise 
the 
pre-ordination 
of 
God 
with 
the 
freedom 
of 
our 
will, 
and 
endeavoured 
to 
comprehend 
both 
truths 
at 
once. 


XLI. 
How 
the 
freedom 
of 
our 
will 
may 
be 
reconciled 
with 
the 
Divine 
preordination. 
But, 
in 
place 
of 
this, 
we 
will 
be 
free 
from 
these 
embarrassments 
if 
we 



recollect 
that 
our 
mind 
is 
limited, 
while 
the 
power 
of 
God, 
by 
which 
he 
not 
only 
knew 
from 
all 
eternity 
what 
is 
or 
can 
be, 
but 
also 
willed 
and 
preordained 
it, 
is 
infinite. 
It 
thus 
happens 
that 
we 
possess 
sufficient 
intelligence 
to 
know 
clearly 
and 
distinctly 
that 
this 
power 
is 
in 
God, 
but 
not 
enough 
to 
comprehend 
how 
he 
leaves 
the 
free 
actions 
of 
men 
indeterminate} 
and, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
we 
have 
such 
consciousness 
of 
the 
liberty 
and 
indifference 
which 
exists 
in 
ourselves, 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
we 
more 
clearly 
or 
perfectly 
comprehend: 
[so 
that 
the 
omnipotence 
of 
God 
ought 
not 
to 
keep 
us 
from 
believing 
it]. 
For 
it 
would 
be 
absurd 
to 
doubt 
of 
that 
of 
which 
we 
are 
fully 
conscious, 
and 
which 
we 
experience 
as 
existing 
in 
ourselves, 
because 
we 
do 
not 
comprehend 
another 
matter 
which, 
from 
its 
very 
nature, 
we 
know 
to 
be 
incomprehensible. 


XLII. 
How, 
although 
we 
never 
will 
to 
err, 
it 
is 
nevertheless 
by 
our 
will 
that 
we 
do 
err. 
But 
now 
since 
we 
know 
that 
all 
our 
errors 
depend 
upon 
our 
will, 
and 
as 
no 
one 
wishes 
to 
deceive 
himself, 
it 
may 
seem 
wonderful 
that 
there 
is 
any 
error 
in 
our 
judgments 
at 
all. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
remark, 
however, 
that 
there 
is 
a 
great 
difference 
between 
willing 
to 
be 
deceived, 
and 
willing 
to 
yield 
assent 
to 
opinions 
in 
which 
it 
happens 
that 
error 
is 
found. 
For 
though 
there 
is 
no 
one 
who 
expressly 
wishes 
to 
fall 
into 
error, 
we 
will 
yet 
hardly 
find 
any 
one 
who 
is 
not 
ready 
to 
assent 
to 
things 
in 
which, 
unknown 
to 
himself, 
error 
lurks; 
and 
it 
even 
frequently 
happens 
that 
it 
is 
the 
desire 
itself 
of 
following 
after 
truth 
that 
leads 
those 
not 
fully 
aware 
of 
the 
order 
in 
which 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
sought 
for, 
to 
pass 
judgment 
on 
matters 
of 
which 
they 
have 
no 
adequate 
knowledge, 
and 
thus 
to 
fall 
into 
error. 


XLIII. 
That 
we 
shall 
never 
err 
if 
we 
give 
our 
assent 
only 
to 
what 
we 
clearly 
and 
distinctly 
perceive. 
But 
it 
is 
certain 
we 
will 
never 
admit 
falsity 
for 
truth, 
so 
long 
as 
we 
judge 
only 
of 
that 
which 
we 
clearly 
and 
distinctly 
perceive; 
because, 
as 
God 
is 
no 
deceiver, 
the 
faculty 
of 
knowledge 
which 
he 
has 
given 
us 
cannot 
be 
fallacious, 
nor, 
for 
the 
same 
reason, 
the 
faculty 
of 
will, 
when 
we 
do 
not 
extend 
it 
beyond 
the 
objects 
we 
clearly 
know. 
And 
even 
although 
this 
truth 
could 
not 
be 
established 
by 
reasoning, 
the 
minds 
of 
all 
have 
been 
so 



impressed 
by 
nature 
as 
spontaneously 
to 
assent 
to 
whatever 
is 
clearly 
perceived, 
and 
to 
experience 
an 
impossibility 
to 
doubt 
of 
its 
truth. 


XLIV. 
That 
we 
uniformly 
judge 
improperly 
when 
we 
assent 
to 
what 
we 
do 
not 
clearly 
perceive, 
although 
our 
judgment 
may 
chance 
to 
be 
true; 
and 
that 
it 
is 
frequently 
our 
memory 
which 
deceives 
us 
by 
leading 
us 
to 
believe 
that 
certain 
things 
were 
formerly 
sufficiently 
understood 
by 
us. 
It 
is 
likewise 
certain 
that, 
when 
we 
approve 
of 
any 
reason 
which 
we 
do 
not 
apprehend, 
we 
are 
either 
deceived, 
or, 
if 
we 
stumble 
on 
the 
truth, 
it 
is 
only 
by 
chance, 
and 
thus 
we 
can 
never 
possess 
the 
assurance 
that 
we 
are 
not 
in 
error. 
I 
confess 
it 
seldom 
happens 
that 
we 
judge 
of 
a 
thing 
when 
we 
have 
observed 
we 
do 
not 
apprehend 
it, 
because 
it 
is 
a 
dictate 
of 
the 
natural 
light 
never 
to 
judge 
of 
what 
we 
do 
not 
know. 
But 
we 
most 
frequently 
err 
in 
this, 
that 
we 
presume 
upon 
a 
past 
knowledge 
of 
much 
to 
which 
we 
give 
our 
assent, 
as 
to 
something 
treasured 
up 
in 
the 
memory, 
and 
perfectly 
known 
to 
us; 
whereas, 
in 
truth, 
we 
have 
no 
such 
knowledge. 


XLV. 
What 
constitutes 
clear 
and 
distinct 
perception. 
There 
are 
indeed 
a 
great 
many 
persons 
who, 
through 
their 
whole 
lifetime, 
never 
perceive 
anything 
in 
a 
way 
necessary 
for 
judging 
of 
it 
properly; 
for 
the 
knowledge 
upon 
which 
we 
can 
establish 
a 
certain 
and 
indubitable 
judgment 
must 
be 
not 
only 
clear, 
but 
also, 
distinct. 
I 
call 
that 
clear 
which 
is 
present 
and 
manifest 
to 
the 
mind 
giving 
attention 
to 
it, 
just 
as 
we 
are 
said 
clearly 
to 
see 
objects 
when, 
being 
present 
to 
the 
eye 
looking 
on, 
they 
stimulate 
it 
with 
sufficient 
force. 
and 
it 
is 
disposed 
to 
regard 
them; 
but 
the 
distinct 
is 
that 
which 
is 
so 
precise 
and 
different 
from 
all 
other 
objects 
as 
to 
comprehend 
in 
itself 
only 
what 
is 
clear. 
[Footnote: 
"what 
appears 
manifestly 
to 
him 
who 
considers 
it 
as 
he 
ought."— 
FRENCH.] 


XLVI. 
It 
is 
shown, 
from 
the 
example 
of 
pain, 
that 
a 
perception 
may 
be 
clear 
without 
being 
distinct, 
but 
that 
it 
cannot 
be 
distinct 
unless 
it 
is 
clear. 
For 
example, 
when 
any 
one 
feels 
intense 
pain, 
the 
knowledge 
which 
he 
has 
of 
this 
pain 
is 
very 
clear, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
always 
distinct; 
for 
men 
usually 
confound 
it 
with 
the 
obscure 
judgment 
they 
form 
regarding 
its 
nature, 
and 
think 
that 
there 
is 
in 
the 
suffering 
part 
something 
similar 
to 
the 
sensation 
of 
pain 
of 



which 
they 
are 
alone 
conscious. 
And 
thus 
perception 
may 
be 
clear 
without 
being 
distinct, 
but 
it 
can 
never 
be 
distinct 
without 
likewise 
being 
clear. 


XLVII. 
That, 
to 
correct 
the 
prejudices 
of 
our 
early 
years, 
we 
must 
consider 
what 
is 
clear 
in 
each 
of 
our 
simple 
[Footnote: 
"first."— 
FRENCH.] 
notions. 
And, 
indeed, 
in 
our 
early 
years, 
the 
mind 
was 
so 
immersed 
in 
the 
body, 
that, 
although 
it 
perceived 
many 
things 
with 
sufficient 
clearness, 
it 
yet 
knew 
nothing 
distinctly; 
and 
since 
even 
at 
that 
time 
we 
exercised 
our 
judgment 
in 
many 
matters, 
numerous 
prejudices 
were 
thus 
contracted, 
which, 
by 
the 
majority, 
are 
never 
afterwards 
laid 
aside. 
But 
that 
we 
may 
now 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
these, 
I 
will 
here 
briefly 
enumerate 
all 
the 
simple 
notions 
of 
which 
our 
thoughts 
are 
composed, 
and 
distinguish 
in 
each 
what 
is 
clear 
from 
what 
is 
obscure, 
or 
fitted 
to 
lead 
into 
error. 


XLVIII. 
That 
all 
the 
objects 
of 
our 
knowledge 
are 
to 
be 
regarded 
either 
(1) 
as 
things 
or 
the 
affections 
of 
things: 
or 
(2) 
as 
eternal 
truths; 
with 
the 
enumeration 
of 
things. 
Whatever 
objects 
fall 
under 
our 
knowledge 
we 
consider 
either 
as 
things 
or 
the 
affections 
of 
things,[Footnote: 
Things 
and 
the 
affections 
of 
things 
are 
(in 
the 
French) 
equivalent 
to 
"what 
has 
some 
(i.e., 
a 
REAL) 
existence," 
as 
opposed 
to 
the 
class 
of 
"eternal 
truths," 
which 
have 
merely 
an 
IDEAL 
existence.] 
or 
as 
eternal 
truths 
possessing 
no 
existence 
beyond 
our 
thought. 
Of 
the 
first 
class 
the 
most 
general 
are 
substance, 
duration, 
order, 
number, 
and 
perhaps 
also 
some 
others, 
which 
notions 
apply 
to 
all 
the 
kinds 
of 
things. 
I 
do 
not, 
however, 
recognise 
more 
than 
two 
highest 
kinds 
(SUMMA 
GENERA) 
of 
things; 
the 
first 
of 
intellectual 
things, 
or 
such 
as 
have 
the 
power 
of 
thinking, 
including 
mind 
or 
thinking 
substance 
and 
its 
properties; 
the 
second, 
of 
material 
things, 
embracing 
extended 
substance, 
or 
body 
and 
its 
properties. 
Perception, 
volition, 
and 
all 
modes 
as 
well 
of 
knowing 
as 
of 
willing, 
are 
related 
to 
thinking 
substance; 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
to 
extended 
substance 
we 
refer 
magnitude, 
or 
extension 
in 
length, 
breadth, 
and 
depth, 
figure, 
motion, 
situation, 
divisibility 
of 
parts 
themselves, 
and 
the 
like. 
There 
are, 
however, 
besides 
these, 
certain 
things 
of 
which 
we 
have 
an 
internal 
experience 
that 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
referred 
either 
to 
the 
mind 
of 
itself, 
or 
to 
the 
body 
alone, 
but 
to 
the 
close 
and 
intimate 
union 
between 
them, 
as 
will 
hereafter 
be 
shown 
in 



its 
place. 
Of 
this 
class 
are 
the 
appetites 
of 
hunger 
and 
thirst, 
etc., 
and 
also 
the 
emotions 
or 
passions 
of 
the 
mind 
which 
are 
not 
exclusively 
mental 
affections, 
as 
the 
emotions 
of 
anger, 
joy, 
sadness, 
love, 
etc.; 
and, 
finally, 
all 
the 
sensations, 
as 
of 
pain, 
titillation, 
light 
and 
colours, 
sounds, 
smells, 
tastes, 
heat, 
hardness, 
and 
the 
other 
tactile 
qualities. 


XLIX. 
That 
the 
eternal 
truths 
cannot 
be 
thus 
enumerated, 
but 
that 
this 
is 
not 
necessary. 
What 
I 
have 
already 
enumerated 
we 
are 
to 
regard 
as 
things, 
or 
the 
qualities 
or 
modes 
of 
things. 
We 
now 
come 
to 
speak 
of 
eternal 
truths. 
When 
we 
apprehend 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
a 
thing 
can 
arise 
from 
nothing, 
this 
proposition, 
EX 
NIHILO 
NIHIL 
FIT, 
is 
not 
considered 
as 
somewhat 
existing, 
or 
as 
the 
mode 
of 
a 
thing, 
but 
as 
an 
eternal 
truth 
having 
its 
seat 
in 
our 
mind, 
and 
is 
called 
a 
common 
notion 
or 
axiom. 
Of 
this 
class 
are 
the 
following:—It 
is 
impossible 
the 
same 
thing 
can 
at 
once 
be 
and 
not 
be; 
what 
is 
done 
cannot 
be 
undone; 
he 
who 
thinks 
must 
exist 
while 
he 
thinks; 
and 
innumerable 
others, 
the 
whole 
of 
which 
it 
is 
indeed 
difficult 
to 
enumerate, 
but 
this 
is 
not 
necessary, 
since, 
if 
blinded 
by 
no 
prejudices, 
we 
cannot 
fail 
to 
know 
them 
when 
the 
occasion 
of 
thinking 
them 
occurs. 


L. 
That 
these 
truths 
are 
clearly 
perceived, 
but 
not 
equally 
by 
all 
men, 
on 
account 
of 
prejudices. 
And, 
indeed, 
with 
regard 
to 
these 
common 
notions, 
it 
is 
not 
to 
be 
doubted 
that 
they 
can 
be 
clearly 
and 
distinctly 
known, 
for 
otherwise 
they 
would 
not 
merit 
this 
appellation: 
as, 
in 
truth, 
some 
of 
them 
are 
not, 
with 
respect 
to 
all 
men, 
equally 
deserving 
of 
the 
name, 
because 
they 
are 
not 
equally 
admitted 
by 
all: 
not, 
however, 
from 
this 
reason, 
as 
I 
think, 
that 
the 
faculty 
of 
knowledge 
of 
one 
man 
extends 
farther 
than 
that 
of 
another, 
but 
rather 
because 
these 
common 
notions 
are 
opposed 
to 
the 
prejudices 
of 
some, 
who, 
on 
this 
account, 
are 
not 
able 
readily 
to 
embrace 
them, 
even 
although 
others, 
who 
are 
free 
from 
those 
prejudices, 
apprehend 
them 
with 
the 
greatest 
clearness. 


LI. 
What 
substance 
is, 
and 
that 
the 
term 
is 
not 
applicable 
to 
God 
and 
the 
creatures 
in 
the 
same 
sense. 
But 
with 
regard 
to 
what 
we 
consider 
as 
things 
or 
the 
modes 
of 
things, 
it 
is 



worth 
while 
to 
examine 
each 
of 
them 
by 
itself. 
By 
substance 
we 
can 
conceive 
nothing 
else 
than 
a 
thing 
which 
exists 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
stand 
in 
need 
of 
nothing 
beyond 
itself 
in 
order 
to 
its 
existence. 
And, 
in 
truth, 
there 
can 
be 
conceived 
but 
one 
substance 
which 
is 
absolutely 
independent, 
and 
that 
is 
God. 
We 
perceive 
that 
all 
other 
things 
can 
exist 
only 
by 
help 
of 
the 
concourse 
of 
God. 
And, 
accordingly, 
the 
term 
substance 
does 
not 
apply 
to 
God 
and 
the 
creatures 
UNIVOCALLY, 
to 
adopt 
a 
term 
familiar 
in 
the 
schools; 
that 
is, 
no 
signification 
of 
this 
word 
can 
be 
distinctly 
understood 
which 
is 
common 
to 
God 
and 
them. 


LII. 
That 
the 
term 
is 
applicable 
univocally 
to 
the 
mind 
and 
the 
body, 
and 
how 
substance 
itself 
is 
known. 
Created 
substances, 
however, 
whether 
corporeal 
or 
thinking, 
may 
be 
conceived 
under 
this 
common 
concept; 
for 
these 
are 
things 
which, 
in 
order 
to 
their 
existence, 
stand 
in 
need 
of 
nothing 
but 
the 
concourse 
of 
God. 
But 
yet 
substance 
cannot 
be 
first 
discovered 
merely 
from 
its 
being 
a 
thing 
which 
exists 
independently, 
for 
existence 
by 
itself 
is 
not 
observed 
by 
us. 
We 
easily, 
however, 
discover 
substance 
itself 
from 
any 
attribute 
of 
it, 
by 
this 
common 
notion, 
that 
of 
nothing 
there 
are 
no 
attributes, 
properties, 
or 
qualities: 
for, 
from 
perceiving 
that 
some 
attribute 
is 
present, 
we 
infer 
that 
some 
existing 
thing 
or 
substance 
to 
which 
it 
may 
be 
attributed 
is 
also 
of 
necessity 
present. 


LIII. 
That 
of 
every 
substance 
there 
is 
one 
principal 
attribute, 
as 
thinking 
of 
the 
mind, 
extension 
of 
the 
body. 
But, 
although 
any 
attribute 
is 
sufficient 
to 
lead 
us 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
substance, 
there 
is, 
however, 
one 
principal 
property 
of 
every 
substance, 
which 
constitutes 
its 
nature 
or 
essence, 
and 
upon 
which 
all 
the 
others 
depend. 
Thus, 
extension 
in 
length, 
breadth, 
and 
depth, 
constitutes 
the 
nature 
of 
corporeal 
substance; 
and 
thought 
the 
nature 
of 
thinking 
substance. 
For 
every 
other 
thing 
that 
can 
be 
attributed 
to 
body, 
presupposes 
extension, 
and 
is 
only 
some 
mode 
of 
an 
extended 
thing; 
as 
all 
the 
properties 
we 
discover 
in 
the 
mind 
are 
only 
diverse 
modes 
of 
thinking. 
Thus, 
for 
example, 
we 
cannot 
conceive 
figure 
unless 
in 
something 
extended, 
nor 
motion 
unless 
in 
extended 
space, 
nor 
imagination, 
sensation, 
or 
will, 
unless 
in 
a 
thinking 
thing. 
But, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
we 
can 
conceive 
extension 
without 
figure 
or 
motion, 
and 



thought 
without 
imagination 
or 
sensation, 
and 
so 
of 
the 
others; 
as 
is 
clear 
to 
any 
one 
who 
attends 
to 
these 
matters. 


LIV. 
How 
we 
may 
have 
clear 
and 
distinct 
notions 
of 
the 
substance 
which 
thinks, 
of 
that 
which 
is 
corporeal, 
and 
of 
God. 
And 
thus 
we 
may 
easily 
have 
two 
clear 
and 
distinct 
notions 
or 
ideas, 
the 
one 
of 
created 
substance, 
which 
thinks, 
the 
other 
of 
corporeal 
substance, 
provided 
we 
carefully 
distinguish 
all 
the 
attributes 
of 
thought 
from 
those 
of 
extension. 
We 
may 
also 
have 
a 
clear 
and 
distinct 
idea 
of 
an 
uncreated 
and 
independent 
thinking 
substance, 
that 
is, 
of 
God, 
provided 
we 
do 
not 
suppose 
that 
this 
idea 
adequately 
represents 
to 
us 
all 
that 
is 
in 
God, 
and 
do 
not 
mix 
up 
with 
it 
anything 
fictitious, 
but 
attend 
simply 
to 
the 
characters 
that 
are 
comprised 
in 
the 
notion 
we 
have 
of 
him, 
and 
which 
we 
clearly 
know 
to 
belong 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
an 
absolutely 
perfect 
Being. 
For 
no 
one 
can 
deny 
that 
there 
is 
in 
us 
such 
an 
idea 
of 
God, 
without 
groundlessly 
supposing 
that 
there 
is 
no 
knowledge 
of 
God 
at 
all 
in 
the 
human 
mind. 


LV. 
How 
duration, 
order, 
and 
number 
may 
be 
also 
distinctly 
conceived. 
We 
will 
also 
have 
most 
distinct 
conceptions 
of 
duration, 
order, 
and 
number, 
if, 
in 
place 
of 
mixing 
up 
with 
our 
notions 
of 
them 
that 
which 
properly 
belongs 
to 
the 
concept 
of 
substance, 
we 
merely 
think 
that 
the 
duration 
of 
a 
thing 
is 
a 
mode 
under 
which 
we 
conceive 
this 
thing, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
continues 
to 
exist; 
and, 
in 
like 
manner, 
that 
order 
and 
number 
are 
not 
in 
reality 
different 
from 
things 
disposed 
in 
order 
and 
numbered, 
but 
only 
modes 
under 
which 
we 
diversely 
consider 
these 
things. 


LVI. 
What 
are 
modes, 
qualities, 
attributes. 
And, 
indeed, 
we 
here 
understand 
by 
modes 
the 
same 
with 
what 
we 
elsewhere 
designate 
attributes 
or 
qualities. 
But 
when 
we 
consider 
substance 
as 
affected 
or 
varied 
by 
them, 
we 
use 
the 
term 
modes; 
when 
from 
this 
variation 
it 
may 
be 
denominated 
of 
such 
a 
kind, 
we 
adopt 
the 
term 
qualities 
[to 
designate 
the 
different 
modes 
which 
cause 
it 
to 
be 
so 
named]; 
and, 
finally, 
when 
we 
simply 
regard 
these 
modes 
as 
in 
the 
substance, 
we 
call 
them 
attributes. 
Accordingly, 
since 
God 
must 
be 
conceived 
as 
superior 
to 
change, 
it 
is 
not 
proper 
to 
say 
that 
there 
are 
modes 
or 
qualities 
in 
him, 
but 
simply 
attributes; 
and 
even 
in 
created 



things 
that 
which 
is 
found 
in 
them 
always 
in 
the 
same 
mode, 
as 
existence 
and 
duration 
in 
the 
thing 
which 
exists 
and 
endures, 
ought 
to 
be 
called 
attribute 
and 
not 
mode 
or 
quality. 


LVII. 
That 
some 
attributes 
exist 
in 
the 
things 
to 
which 
they 
are 
attributed, 
and 
others 
only 
in 
our 
thought; 
and 
what 
duration 
and 
time 
are. 
Of 
these 
attributes 
or 
modes 
there 
are 
some 
which 
exist 
in 
the 
things 
themselves, 
and 
others 
that 
have 
only 
an 
existence 
in 
our 
thought; 
thus, 
for 
example, 
time, 
which 
we 
distinguish 
from 
duration 
taken 
in 
its 
generality, 
and 
call 
the 
measure 
of 
motion, 
is 
only 
a 
certain 
mode 
under 
which 
we 
think 
duration 
itself, 
for 
we 
do 
not 
indeed 
conceive 
the 
duration 
of 
things 
that 
are 
moved 
to 
be 
different 
from 
the 
duration 
of 
things 
that 
are 
not 
moved: 
as 
is 
evident 
from 
this, 
that 
if 
two 
bodies 
are 
in 
motion 
for 
an 
hour, 
the 
one 
moving 
quickly 
and 
the 
other 
slowly, 
we 
do 
not 
reckon 
more 
time 
in 
the 
one 
than 
in 
the 
other, 
although 
there 
may 
be 
much 
more 
motion 
in 
the 
one 
of 
the 
bodies 
than 
in 
the 
other. 
But 
that 
we 
may 
comprehend 
the 
duration 
of 
all 
things 
under 
a 
common 
measure, 
we 
compare 
their 
duration 
with 
that 
of 
the 
greatest 
and 
most 
regular 
motions 
that 
give 
rise 
to 
years 
and 
days, 
and 
which 
we 
call 
time; 
hence 
what 
is 
so 
designated 
is 
nothing 
superadded 
to 
duration, 
taken 
in 
its 
generality, 
but 
a 
mode 
of 
thinking. 


LVIII. 
That 
number 
and 
all 
universals 
are 
only 
modes 
of 
thought. 
In 
the 
same 
way 
number, 
when 
it 
is 
not 
considered 
as 
in 
created 
things, 
but 
merely 
in 
the 
abstract 
or 
in 
general, 
is 
only 
a 
mode 
of 
thinking; 
and 
the 
same 
is 
true 
of 
all 
those 
general 
ideas 
we 
call 
universals. 


LIX. 
How 
universals 
are 
formed; 
and 
what 
are 
the 
five 
common, 
viz., 
genus, 
species, 
difference, 
property, 
and 
accident. 
Universals 
arise 
merely 
from 
our 
making 
use 
of 
one 
and 
the 
same 
idea 
in 
thinking 
of 
all 
individual 
objects 
between 
which 
there 
subsists 
a 
certain 
likeness; 
and 
when 
we 
comprehend 
all 
the 
objects 
represented 
by 
this 
idea 
under 
one 
name, 
this 
term 
likewise 
becomes 
universal. 
For 
example, 
when 
we 
see 
two 
stones, 
and 
do 
not 
regard 
their 
nature 
farther 
than 
to 
remark 
that 
there 
are 
two 
of 
them, 
we 
form 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
certain 
number, 
which 
we 
call 
the 
binary; 
and 
when 
we 
afterwards 
see 
two 
birds 
or 
two 
trees, 
and 
merely 



take 
notice 
of 
them 
so 
far 
as 
to 
observe 
that 
there 
are 
two 
of 
them, 
we 
again 
take 
up 
the 
same 
idea 
as 
before, 
which 
is, 
accordingly, 
universal; 
and 
we 
likewise 
give 
to 
this 
number 
the 
same 
universal 
appellation 
of 
binary. 
In 
the 
same 
way, 
when 
we 
consider 
a 
figure 
of 
three 
sides, 
we 
form 
a 
certain 
idea, 
which 
we 
call 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
triangle, 
and 
we 
afterwards 
make 
use 
of 
it 
as 
the 
universal 
to 
represent 
to 
our 
mind 
all 
other 
figures 
of 
three 
sides. 
But 
when 
we 
remark 
more 
particularly 
that 
of 
figures 
of 
three 
sides, 
some 
have 
a 
right 
angle 
and 
others 
not, 
we 
form 
the 
universal 
idea 
of 
a 
right-angled 
triangle, 
which 
being 
related 
to 
the 
preceding 
as 
more 
general, 
may 
be 
called 
species; 
and 
the 
right 
angle 
the 
universal 
difference 
by 
which 
right-angled 
triangles 
are 
distinguished 
from 
all 
others; 
and 
farther, 
because 
the 
square 
of 
the 
side 
which 
sustains 
the 
right 
angle 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
squares 
of 
the 
other 
two 
sides, 
and 
because 
this 
property 
belongs 
only 
to 
this 
species 
of 
triangles, 
we 
may 
call 
it 
the 
universal 
property 
of 
the 
species. 
Finally, 
if 
we 
suppose 
that 
of 
these 
triangles 
some 
are 
moved 
and 
others 
not, 
this 
will 
be 
their 
universal 
accident; 
and, 
accordingly, 
we 
commonly 
reckon 
five 
universals, 
viz., 
genus, 
species, 
difference, 
property, 
accident. 


LX. 
Of 
distinctions; 
and 
first 
of 
the 
real. 
But 
number 
in 
things 
themselves 
arises 
from 
the 
distinction 
there 
is 
between 
them: 
and 
distinction 
is 
threefold, 
viz., 
real, 
modal, 
and 
of 
reason. 
The 
real 
properly 
subsists 
between 
two 
or 
more 
substances; 
and 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
assure 
us 
that 
two 
substances 
are 
really 
mutually 
distinct, 
if 
only 
we 
are 
able 
clearly 
and 
distinctly 
to 
conceive 
the 
one 
of 
them 
without 
the 
other. 
For 
the 
knowledge 
we 
have 
of 
God 
renders 
it 
certain 
that 
he 
can 
effect 
all 
that 
of 
which 
we 
have 
a 
distinct 
idea: 
wherefore, 
since 
we 
have 
now, 
for 
example, 
the 
idea 
of 
an 
extended 
and 
corporeal 
substance, 
though 
we 
as 
yet 
do 
not 
know 
with 
certainty 
whether 
any 
such 
thing 
is 
really 
existent, 
nevertheless, 
merely 
because 
we 
have 
the 
idea 
of 
it, 
we 
may 
be 
assured 
that 
such 
may 
exist; 
and, 
if 
it 
really 
exists, 
that 
every 
part 
which 
we 
can 
determine 
by 
thought 
must 
be 
really 
distinct 
from 
the 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
same 
substance. 
In 
the 
same 
way, 
since 
every 
one 
is 
conscious 
that 
he 
thinks, 
and 
that 
he 
in 
thought 
can 
exclude 
from 
himself 
every 
other 
substance, 
whether 
thinking 
or 
extended, 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
each 
of 
us 
thus 
considered 
is 
really 
distinct 
from 
every 
other 
thinking 
and 
corporeal 
substance. 
And 
although 
we 
suppose 
that 



God 
united 
a 
body 
to 
a 
soul 
so 
closely 
that 
it 
was 
impossible 
to 
form 
a 
more 
intimate 
union, 
and 
thus 
made 
a 
composite 
whole, 
the 
two 
substances 
would 
remain 
really 
distinct, 
notwithstanding 
this 
union; 
for 
with 
whatever 
tie 
God 
connected 
them, 
he 
was 
not 
able 
to 
rid 
himself 
of 
the 
power 
he 
possessed 
of 
separating 
them, 
or 
of 
conserving 
the 
one 
apart 
from 
the 
other, 
and 
the 
things 
which 
God 
can 
separate 
or 
conserve 
separately 
are 
really 
distinct. 


LXI. 
Of 
the 
modal 
distinction. 
There 
are 
two 
kinds 
of 
modal 
distinctions, 
viz., 
that 
between 
the 
mode 
properly 
so-called 
and 
the 
substance 
of 
which 
it 
is 
a 
mode, 
and 
that 
between 
two 
modes 
of 
the 
same 
substance. 
Of 
the 
former 
we 
have 
an 
example 
in 
this, 
that 
we 
can 
clearly 
apprehend 
substance 
apart 
from 
the 
mode 
which 
we 
say 
differs 
from 
it; 
while, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
we 
cannot 
conceive 
this 
mode 
without 
conceiving 
the 
substance 
itself. 
There 
is, 
for 
example, 
a 
modal 
distinction 
between 
figure 
or 
motion 
and 
corporeal 
substance 
in 
which 
both 
exist; 
there 
is 
a 
similar 
distinction 
between 
affirmation 
or 
recollection 
and 
the 
mind. 
Of 
the 
latter 
kind 
we 
have 
an 
illustration 
in 
our 
ability 
to 
recognise 
the 
one 
of 
two 
modes 
apart 
from 
the 
other, 
as 
figure 
apart 
from 
motion, 
and 
motion 
apart 
from 
figure; 
though 
we 
cannot 
think 
of 
either 
the 
one 
or 
the 
other 
without 
thinking 
of 
the 
common 
substance 
in 
which 
they 
adhere. 
If, 
for 
example, 
a 
stone 
is 
moved, 
and 
is 
withal 
square, 
we 
can, 
indeed, 
conceive 
its 
square 
figure 
without 
its 
motion, 
and 
reciprocally 
its 
motion 
without 
its 
square 
figure; 
but 
we 
can 
conceive 
neither 
this 
motion 
nor 
this 
figure 
apart 
from 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
stone. 
As 
for 
the 
distinction 
according 
to 
which 
the 
mode 
of 
one 
substance 
is 
different 
from 
another 
substance, 
or 
from 
the 
mode 
of 
another 
substance, 
as 
the 
motion 
of 
one 
body 
is 
different 
from 
another 
body 
or 
from 
the 
mind, 
or 
as 
motion 
is 
different 
from 
doubt, 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
it 
should 
be 
called 
real 
rather 
than 
modal, 
because 
these 
modes 
cannot 
be 
clearly 
conceived 
apart 
from 
the 
really 
distinct 
substances 
of 
which 
they 
are 
the 
modes. 


LXII. 
Of 
the 
distinction 
of 
reason 
(logical 
distinction). 
Finally, 
the 
distinction 
of 
reason 
is 
that 
between 
a 
substance 
and 
some 
one 
of 
its 
attributes, 
without 
which 
it 
is 
impossible, 
however, 
we 
can 
have 
a 
distinct 
conception 
of 
the 
substance 
itself; 
or 
between 
two 
such 
attributes 
of 
a 



common 
substance, 
the 
one 
of 
which 
we 
essay 
to 
think 
without 
the 
other. 
This 
distinction 
is 
manifest 
from 
our 
inability 
to 
form 
a 
clear 
and 
distinct 
idea 
of 
such 
substance, 
if 
we 
separate 
from 
it 
such 
attribute; 
or 
to 
have 
a 
clear 
perception 
of 
the 
one 
of 
two 
such 
attributes 
if 
we 
separate 
it 
from 
the 
other. 
For 
example, 
because 
any 
substance 
which 
ceases 
to 
endure 
ceases 
also 
to 
exist, 
duration 
is 
not 
distinct 
from 
substance 
except 
in 
thought 
(RATIONE); 
and 
in 
general 
all 
the 
modes 
of 
thinking 
which 
we 
consider 
as 
in 
objects 
differ 
only 
in 
thought, 
as 
well 
from 
the 
objects 
of 
which 
they 
are 
thought 
as 
from 
each 
other 
in 
a 
common 
object.[Footnote: 
"and 
generally 
all 
the 
attributes 
that 
lead 
us 
to 
entertain 
different 
thoughts 
of 
the 
same 
thing, 
such 
as, 
for 
example, 
the 
extension 
of 
body 
and 
its 
property 
of 
divisibility, 
do 
not 
differ 
from 
the 
body 
which 
is 
to 
us 
the 
object 
of 
them, 
or 
from 
each 
other, 
unless 
as 
we 
sometimes 
confusedly 
think 
the 
one 
without 
thinking 
the 
other."—FRENCH.] 
It 
occurs, 
indeed, 
to 
me 
that 
I 
have 
elsewhere 
classed 
this 
kind 
of 
distinction 
with 
the 
modal 
(viz., 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Reply 
to 
the 
First 
Objections 
to 
the 
Meditations 
on 
the 
First 
Philosophy); 
but 
there 
it 
was 
only 
necessary 
to 
treat 
of 
these 
distinctions 
generally, 
and 
it 
was 
sufficient 
for 
my 
purpose 
at 
that 
time 
simply 
to 
distinguish 
both 
of 
them 
from 
the 
real. 


LXIII. 
How 
thought 
and 
extension 
may 
be 
distinctly 
known, 
as 
constituting, 
the 
one 
the 
nature 
of 
mind, 
the 
other 
that 
of 
body. 
Thought 
and 
extension 
may 
be 
regarded 
as 
constituting 
the 
natures 
of 
intelligent 
and 
corporeal 
substance; 
and 
then 
they 
must 
not 
be 
otherwise 
conceived 
than 
as 
the 
thinking 
and 
extended 
substances 
themselves, 
that 
is, 
as 
mind 
and 
body, 
which 
in 
this 
way 
are 
conceived 
with 
the 
greatest 
clearness 
and 
distinctness. 
Moreover, 
we 
more 
easily 
conceive 
extended 
or 
thinking 
substance 
than 
substance 
by 
itself, 
or 
with 
the 
omission 
of 
its 
thinking 
or 
extension. 
For 
there 
is 
some 
difficulty 
in 
abstracting 
the 
notion 
of 
substance 
from 
the 
notions 
of 
thinking 
and 
extension, 
which, 
in 
truth, 
are 
only 
diverse 
in 
thought 
itself 
(i.e., 
logically 
different); 
and 
a 
concept 
is 
not 
more 
distinct 
because 
it 
comprehends 
fewer 
properties, 
but 
because 
we 
accurately 
distinguish 
what 
is 
comprehended 
in 
it 
from 
all 
other 
notions. 


LXIV. 
How 
these 
may 
likewise 
be 
distinctly 
conceived 
as 
modes 
of 
substance. 

Thought 
and 
extension 
may 
be 
also 
considered 
as 
modes 
of 
substance; 
in 
as 
far, 
namely, 
as 
the 
same 
mind 
may 
have 
many 
different 
thoughts, 
and 
the 
same 
body, 
with 
its 
size 
unchanged, 
may 
be 
extended 
in 
several 
diverse 
ways, 
at 
one 
time 
more 
in 
length 
and 
less 
in 
breadth 
or 
depth, 
and 
at 
another 
time 
more 
in 
breadth 
and 
less 
in 
length; 
and 
then 
they 
are 
modally 
distinguished 
from 
substance, 
and 
can 
be 
conceived 
not 
less 
clearly 
and 
distinctly, 
provided 
they 
be 
not 
regarded 
as 
substances 
or 
things 
separated 
from 
others, 
but 
simply 
as 
modes 
of 
things. 
For 
by 
regarding 
them 
as 
in 
the 
substances 
of 
which 
they 
are 
the 
modes, 
we 
distinguish 
them 
from 
these 
substances, 
and 
take 
them 
for 
what 
in 
truth 
they 
are: 
whereas, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
if 
we 
wish 
to 
consider 
them 
apart 
from 
the 
substances 
in 
which 
they 
are, 
we 
should 
by 
this 
itself 
regard 
them 
as 
self-subsisting 
things, 
and 
thus 
confound 
the 
ideas 
of 
mode 
and 
substance. 


LXV. 
How 
we 
may 
likewise 
know 
their 
modes. 
In 
the 
same 
way 
we 
will 
best 
apprehend 
the 
diverse 
modes 
of 
thought, 
as 
intellection, 
imagination, 
recollection, 
volition, 
etc., 
and 
also 
the 
diverse 
modes 
of 
extension, 
or 
those 
that 
belong 
to 
extension, 
as 
all 
figures, 
the 
situation 
of 
parts 
and 
their 
motions, 
provided 
we 
consider 
them 
simply 
as 
modes 
of 
the 
things 
in 
which 
they 
are; 
and 
motion 
as 
far 
as 
it 
is 
concerned, 
provided 
we 
think 
merely 
of 
locomotion, 
without 
seeking 
to 
know 
the 
force 
that 
produces 
it, 
and 
which 
nevertheless 
I 
will 
essay 
to 
explain 
in 
its 
own 
place. 


LXVI. 
How 
our 
sensations, 
affections, 
and 
appetites 
may 
be 
clearly 
known, 
although 
we 
are 
frequently 
wrong 
in 
our 
judgments 
regarding 
them. 
There 
remain 
our 
sensations, 
affections, 
and 
appetites, 
of 
which 
we 
may 
also 
have 
a 
clear 
knowledge, 
if 
we 
take 
care 
to 
comprehend 
in 
the 
judgments 
we 
form 
of 
them 
only 
that 
which 
is 
precisely 
contained 
in 
our 
perception 
of 
them, 
and 
of 
which 
we 
are 
immediately 
conscious. 
There 
is, 
however, 
great 
difficulty 
in 
observing 
this, 
at 
least 
in 
respect 
of 
sensations; 
because 
we 
have 
all, 
without 
exception, 
from 
our 
youth 
judged 
that 
all 
the 
things 
we 
perceived 
by 
our 
senses 
had 
an 
existence 
beyond 
our 
thought, 
and 
that 
they 
were 
entirely 
similar 
to 
the 
sensations, 
that 
is, 
perceptions, 
we 
ad 
of 
them. 
Thus 
when, 
for 
example, 
we 
saw 
a 
certain 
colour, 
we 
thought 
we 
saw 
something 



occupying 
a 
place 
out 
of 
us, 
and 
which 
was 
entirely 
similar 
to 
that 
idea 
of 
colour 
we 
were 
then 
conscious 
of; 
and 
from 
the 
habit 
of 
judging 
in 
this 
way, 
we 
seemed 
to 
see 
this 
so 
clearly 
and 
distinctly 
that 
we 
esteemed 
it 
(i.e., 
the 
externality 
of 
the 
colour) 
certain 
and 
indubitable. 


LXVII. 
That 
we 
are 
frequently 
deceived 
in 
our 
judgments 
regarding 
pain 
itself. 
The 
same 
prejudice 
has 
place 
in 
all 
our 
other 
sensations, 
even 
in 
those 
of 
titillation 
and 
pain. 
For 
though 
we 
are 
not 
in 
the 
habit 
of 
believing 
that 
there 
exist 
out 
of 
us 
objects 
that 
resemble 
titillation 
and 
pain, 
we 
do 
not 
nevertheless 
consider 
these 
sensations 
as 
in 
the 
mind 
alone, 
or 
in 
our 
perception, 
but 
as 
in 
the 
hand, 
or 
foot, 
or 
some 
other 
part 
of 
our 
body. 
There 
is 
no 
reason, 
however, 
to 
constrain 
us 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
pain, 
for 
example, 
which 
we 
feel, 
as 
it 
were, 
in 
the 
foot 
is 
something 
out 
of 
the 
mind 
existing 
in 
the 
foot, 
or 
that 
the 
light 
which 
we 
see, 
as 
it 
were, 
in 
the 
sun 
exists 
in 
the 
sun 
as 
it 
is 
in 
us. 
Both 
these 
beliefs 
are 
prejudices 
of 
our 
early 
years, 
as 
will 
clearly 
appear 
in 
the 
sequel. 


LXVIII. 
How 
in 
these 
things 
what 
we 
clearly 
conceive 
is 
to 
be 
distinguished 
from 
that 
in 
which 
we 
may 
be 
deceived. 
But 
that 
we 
may 
distinguish 
what 
is 
clear 
in 
our 
sensations 
from 
what 
is 
obscure, 
we 
ought 
most 
carefully 
to 
observe 
that 
we 
possess 
a 
clear 
and 
distinct 
knowledge 
of 
pain, 
colour, 
and 
other 
things 
of 
this 
sort, 
when 
we 
consider 
them 
simply 
as 
sensations 
or 
thoughts; 
but 
that, 
when 
they 
are 
judged 
to 
be 
certain 
things 
subsisting 
beyond 
our 
mind, 
we 
are 
wholly 
unable 
to 
form 
any 
conception 
of 
them. 
Indeed, 
when 
any 
one 
tells 
us 
that 
he 
sees 
colour 
in 
a 
body 
or 
feels 
pain 
in 
one 
of 
his 
limbs, 
this 
is 
exactly 
the 
same 
as 
if 
he 
said 
that 
he 
there 
saw 
or 
felt 
something 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
which 
he 
was 
entirely 
ignorant, 
or 
that 
he 
did 
not 
know 
what 
he 
saw 
or 
felt. 
For 
although, 
when 
less 
attentively 
examining 
his 
thoughts, 
a 
person 
may 
easily 
persuade 
himself 
that 
he 
has 
some 
knowledge 
of 
it, 
since 
he 
supposes 
that 
there 
is 
something 
resembling 
that 
sensation 
of 
colour 
or 
of 
pain 
of 
which 
he 
is 
conscious; 
yet, 
if 
he 
reflects 
on 
what 
the 
sensation 
of 
colour 
or 
pain 
represents 
to 
him 
as 
existing 
in 
a 
coloured 
body 
or 
in 
a 
wounded 
member, 
he 
will 
find 
that 
of 
such 
he 
has 
absolutely 
no 
knowledge. 



LXIX. 
That 
magnitude, 
figure, 
etc., 
are 
known 
far 
differently 
from 
colour, 
pain, 
etc. 
What 
we 
have 
said 
above 
will 
be 
more 
manifest; 
especially 
if 
we 
consider 
that 
size 
in 
the 
body 
perceived, 
figure, 
motion 
(at 
least 
local, 
for 
philosophers 
by 
fancying 
other 
kinds 
of 
motion 
have 
rendered 
its 
nature 
less 
intelligible 
to 
themselves), 
the 
situation 
of 
parts, 
duration, 
number, 
and 
those 
other 
properties 
which, 
as 
we 
have 
already 
said, 
we 
clearly 
perceive 
in 
all 
bodies, 
are 
known 
by 
us 
in 
a 
way 
altogether 
different 
from 
that 
in 
which 
we 
know 
what 
colour 
is 
in 
the 
same 
body, 
or 
pain, 
smell, 
taste, 
or 
any 
other 
of 
those 
properties 
which 
I 
have 
said 
above 
must 
be 
referred 
to 
the 
senses. 
For 
although 
when 
we 
see 
a 
body 
we 
are 
not 
less 
assured 
of 
its 
existence 
from 
its 
appearing 
figured 
than 
from 
its 
appearing 
coloured,[Footnote: 
"by 
the 
colour 
we 
perceive 
on 
occasion 
of 
it."— 
FRENCH.] 
we 
yet 
know 
with 
far 
greater 
clearness 
its 
property 
of 
figure 
than 
its 
colour. 


LXX. 
That 
we 
may 
judge 
of 
sensible 
things 
in 
two 
ways, 
by 
the 
one 
of 
which 
we 
avoid 
error, 
by 
the 
other 
fall 
into 
it. 
It 
is 
thus 
manifest 
that 
to 
say 
we 
perceive 
colours 
in 
objects 
is 
in 
reality 
equivalent 
to 
saying 
we 
perceive 
something 
in 
objects 
and 
are 
yet 
ignorant 
of 
what 
it 
is, 
except 
as 
that 
which 
determines 
in 
us 
a 
certain 
highly 
vivid 
and 
clear 
sensation, 
which 
we 
call 
the 
sensation 
of 
colours. 
There 
is, 
however, 
very 
great 
diversity 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
judging: 
for 
so 
long 
as 
we 
simply 
judge 
that 
there 
is 
an 
unknown 
something 
in 
objects 
(that 
is, 
in 
things 
such 
as 
they 
are, 
from 
which 
the 
sensation 
reached 
us), 
so 
far 
are 
we 
from 
falling 
into 
error 
that, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
we 
thus 
rather 
provide 
against 
it, 
for 
we 
are 
less 
apt 
to 
judge 
rashly 
of 
a 
thing 
which 
we 
observe 
we 
do 
not 
know. 
But 
when 
we 
think 
we 
perceive 
colours 
in 
objects, 
although 
we 
are 
in 
reality 
ignorant 
of 
what 
we 
then 
denominate 
colour, 
and 
are 
unable 
to 
conceive 
any 
resemblance 
between 
the 
colour 
we 
suppose 
to 
be 
in 
objects, 
and 
that 
of 
which 
we 
are 
conscious 
in 
sensation, 
yet 
because 
we 
do 
not 
observe 
this, 
or 
because 
there 
are 
in 
objects 
several 
properties, 
as 
size, 
figure, 
number, 
etc., 
which, 
as 
we 
clearly 
know, 
exist, 
or 
may 
exist 
in 
them 
as 
they 
are 
perceived 
by 
our 
senses 
or 
conceived 
by 
our 
understanding, 
we 
easily 
glide 
into 
the 
error 
of 
holding 
that 
what 
is 
called 
colour 
in 
objects 
is 
something 
entirely 
resembling 
the 
colour 
we 
perceive, 
and 
thereafter 
of 
supposing 
that 
we 
have 
a 



clear 
perception 
of 
what 
is 
in 
no 
way 
perceived 
by 
us. 


LXXI. 
That 
the 
chief 
cause 
of 
our 
errors 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
prejudices 
of 
our 
childhood. 
And 
here 
we 
may 
notice 
the 
first 
and 
chief 
cause 
of 
our 
errors. 
In 
early 
life 
the 
mind 
was 
so 
closely 
bound 
to 
the 
body 
that 
it 
attended 
to 
nothing 
beyond 
the 
thoughts 
by 
which 
it 
perceived 
the 
objects 
that 
made 
impression 
on 
the 
body; 
nor 
as 
yet 
did 
it 
refer 
these 
thoughts 
to 
anything 
existing 
beyond 
itself, 
but 
simply 
felt 
pain 
when 
the 
body 
was 
hurt, 
or 
pleasure 
when 
anything 
beneficial 
to 
the 
body 
occurred, 
or 
if 
the 
body 
was 
so 
highly 
affected 
that 
it 
was 
neither 
greatly 
benefited 
nor 
hurt, 
the 
mind 
experienced 
the 
sensations 
we 
call 
tastes, 
smells, 
sounds, 
heat, 
cold, 
light, 
colours, 
and 
the 
like, 
which 
in 
truth 
are 
representative 
of 
nothing 
existing 
out 
of 
our 
mind, 
and 
which 
vary 
according 
to 
the 
diversities 
of 
the 
parts 
and 
modes 
in 
which 
the 
body 
is 
affected. 
[Footnote: 
"which 
vary 
according 
to 
the 
diversities 
of 
the 
movements 
that 
pass 
from 
all 
parts 
of 
our 
body 
to 
the 
part 
of 
the 
brain 
to 
which 
it 
(the 
mind) 
is 
closely 
joined 
and 
united."—FRENCH.] 
The 
mind 
at 
the 
same 
time 
also 
perceived 
magnitudes, 
figures, 
motions, 
and 
the 
like, 
which 
were 
not 
presented 
to 
it 
as 
sensations 
but 
as 
things 
or 
the 
modes 
of 
things 
existing, 
or 
at 
least 
capable 
of 
existing 
out 
of 
thought, 
although 
it 
did 
not 
yet 
observe 
this 
difference 
between 
these 
two 
kinds 
of 
perceptions. 
And 
afterwards 
when 
the 
machine 
of 
the 
body, 
which 
has 
been 
so 
fabricated 
by 
nature 
that 
it 
can 
of 
its 
own 
inherent 
power 
move 
itself 
in 
various 
ways, 
by 
turning 
itself 
at 
random 
on 
every 
side, 
followed 
after 
what 
was 
useful 
and 
avoided 
what 
was 
detrimental; 
the 
mind, 
which 
was 
closely 
connected 
with 
it, 
reflecting 
on 
the 
objects 
it 
pursued 
or 
avoided, 
remarked, 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
that 
they 
existed 
out 
of 
itself, 
and 
not 
only 
attributed 
to 
them 
magnitudes, 
figures, 
motions, 
and 
the 
like, 
which 
it 
apprehended 
either 
as 
things 
or 
as 
the 
modes 
of 
things, 
but, 
in 
addition, 
attributed 
to 
them 
tastes, 
odours, 
and 
the 
other 
ideas 
of 
that 
sort, 
the 
sensations 
of 
which 
were 
caused 
by 
itself; 
[Footnote: 
"which 
it 
perceived 
on 
occasion 
of 
them" 
(i.e., 
of 
external 
objects).—FRENCH.] 
and 
as 
it 
only 
considered 
other 
objects 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
were 
useful 
to 
the 
body, 
in 
which 
it 
was 
immersed, 
it 
judged 
that 
there 
was 
greater 
or 
less 
reality 
in 
each 
object, 
according 
as 
the 
impressions 
it 
caused 
on 
the 
body 
were 
more 
or 
less 
powerful. 
Hence 
arose 
the 
belief 
that 
there 
was 



more 
substance 
or 
body 
in 
rocks 
and 
metals 
than 
in 
air 
or 
water, 
because 
the 
mind 
perceived 
in 
them 
more 
hardness 
and 
weight. 
Moreover, 
the 
air 
was 
thought 
to 
be 
merely 
nothing 
so 
long 
as 
we 
experienced 
no 
agitation 
of 
it 
by 
the 
wind, 
or 
did 
not 
feel 
it 
hot 
or 
cold. 
And 
because 
the 
stars 
gave 
hardly 
more 
light 
than 
the 
slender 
flames 
of 
candles, 
we 
supposed 
that 
each 
star 
was 
but 
of 
this 
size. 
Again, 
since 
the 
mind 
did 
not 
observe 
that 
the 
earth 
moved 
on 
its 
axis, 
or 
that 
its 
superficies 
was 
curved 
like 
that 
of 
a 
globe, 
it 
was 
on 
that 
account 
more 
ready 
to 
judge 
the 
earth 
immovable 
and 
its 
surface 
flat. 
And 
our 
mind 
has 
been 
imbued 
from 
our 
infancy 
with 
a 
thousand 
other 
prejudices 
of 
the 
same 
sort 
which 
afterwards 
in 
our 
youth 
we 
forgot 
we 
had 
accepted 
without 
sufficient 
examination, 
and 
admitted 
as 
possessed 
of 
the 
highest 
truth 
and 
clearness, 
as 
if 
they 
had 
been 
known 
by 
means 
of 
our 
senses, 
or 
implanted 
in 
us 
by 
nature. 


LXXII. 
That 
the 
second 
cause 
of 
our 
errors 
is 
that 
we 
cannot 
forget 
these 
prejudices. 
And 
although 
now 
in 
our 
mature 
years, 
when 
the 
mind, 
being 
no 
longer 
wholly 
subject 
to 
the 
body, 
is 
not 
in 
the 
habit 
of 
referring 
all 
things 
to 
it, 
but 
also 
seeks 
to 
discover 
the 
truth 
of 
things 
considered 
in 
themselves, 
we 
observe 
the 
falsehood 
of 
a 
great 
many 
of 
the 
judgments 
we 
had 
before 
formed; 
yet 
we 
experience 
a 
difficulty 
in 
expunging 
them 
from 
our 
memory, 
and, 
so 
long 
as 
they 
remain 
there, 
they 
give 
rise 
to 
various 
errors. 
Thus, 
for 
example, 
since 
from 
our 
earliest 
years 
we 
imagined 
the 
stars 
to 
be 
of 
very 
small 
size, 
we 
find 
it 
highly 
difficult 
to 
rid 
ourselves 
of 
this 
imagination, 
although 
assured 
by 
plain 
astronomical 
reasons 
that 
they 
are 
of 
the 
greatest, 
—so 
prevailing 
is 
the 
power 
of 
preconceived 
opinion. 


LXXIII. 
The 
third 
cause 
is, 
that 
we 
become 
fatigued 
by 
attending 
to 
those 
objects 
which 
are 
not 
present 
to 
the 
senses; 
and 
that 
we 
are 
thus 
accustomed 
to 
judge 
of 
these 
not 
from 
present 
perception 
but 
from 
pre-conceived 
opinion. 
Besides, 
our 
mind 
cannot 
attend 
to 
any 
object 
without 
at 
length 
experiencing 
some 
pain 
and 
fatigue; 
and 
of 
all 
objects 
it 
has 
the 
greatest 
difficulty 
in 
attending 
to 
those 
which 
are 
present 
neither 
to 
the 
senses 
nor 
to 
the 
imagination: 
whether 
for 
the 
reason 
that 
this 
is 
natural 
to 
it 
from 
its 
union 
with 
the 
body, 
or 
because 
in 
our 
early 
years, 
being 
occupied 
merely 
with 



perceptions 
and 
imaginations, 
it 
has 
become 
more 
familiar 
with, 
and 
acquired 
greater 
facility 
in 
thinking 
in 
those 
modes 
than 
in 
any 
other. 
Hence 
it 
also 
happens 
that 
many 
are 
unable 
to 
conceive 
any 
substance 
except 
what 
is 
imaginable 
and 
corporeal, 
and 
even 
sensible. 
For 
they 
are 
ignorant 
of 
the 
circumstance, 
that 
those 
objects 
alone 
are 
imaginable 
which 
consist 
in 
extension, 
motion, 
and 
figure, 
while 
there 
are 
many 
others 
besides 
these 
that 
are 
intelligible; 
and 
they 
persuade 
themselves 
that 
nothing 
can 
subsist 
but 
body, 
and, 
finally, 
that 
there 
is 
no 
body 
which 
is 
not 
sensible. 
And 
since 
in 
truth 
we 
perceive 
no 
object 
such 
as 
it 
is 
by 
sense 
alone 
[but 
only 
by 
our 
reason 
exercised 
upon 
sensible 
objects], 
as 
will 
hereafter 
be 
clearly 
shown, 
it 
thus 
happens 
that 
the 
majority 
during 
life 
perceive 
nothing 
unless 
in 
a 
confused 
way. 


LXXIV. 
The 
fourth 
source 
of 
our 
errors 
is, 
that 
we 
attach 
our 
thoughts 
to 
words 
which 
do 
not 
express 
them 
with 
accuracy. 
Finally, 
since 
for 
the 
use 
of 
speech 
we 
attach 
all 
our 
conceptions 
to 
words 
by 
which 
to 
express 
them, 
and 
commit 
to 
memory 
our 
thoughts 
in 
connection 
with 
these 
terms, 
and 
as 
we 
afterwards 
find 
it 
more 
easy 
to 
recall 
the 
words 
than 
the 
things 
signified 
by 
them, 
we 
can 
scarcely 
conceive 
anything 
with 
such 
distinctness 
as 
to 
separate 
entirely 
what 
we 
conceive 
from 
the 
words 
that 
were 
selected 
to 
express 
it. 
On 
this 
account 
the 
majority 
attend 
to 
words 
rather 
than 
to 
things; 
and 
thus 
very 
frequently 
assent 
to 
terms 
without 
attaching 
to 
them 
any 
meaning, 
either 
because 
they 
think 
they 
once 
understood 
them, 
or 
imagine 
they 
received 
them 
from 
others 
by 
whom 
they 
were 
correctly 
understood. 
This, 
however, 
is 
not 
the 
place 
to 
treat 
of 
this 
matter 
in 
detail, 
seeing 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
human 
body 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
expounded, 
nor 
the 
existence 
even 
of 
body 
established; 
enough, 
nevertheless, 
appears 
to 
have 
been 
said 
to 
enable 
one 
to 
distinguish 
such 
of 
our 
conceptions 
as 
are 
clear 
and 
distinct 
from 
those 
that 
are 
obscure 
and 
confused. 


LXXV. 
Summary 
of 
what 
must 
be 
observed 
in 
order 
to 
philosophize 
correctly. 
Wherefore 
if 
we 
would 
philosophize 
in 
earnest, 
and 
give 
ourselves 
to 
the 
search 
after 
all 
the 
truths 
we 
are 
capable 
of 
knowing, 
we 
must, 
in 
the 
first 



place, 
lay 
aside 
our 
prejudices; 
in 
other 
words, 
we 
must 
take 
care 
scrupulously 
to 
withhold 
our 
assent 
from 
the 
opinions 
we 
have 
formerly 
admitted, 
until 
upon 
new 
examination 
we 
discover 
that 
they 
are 
true. 
We 
must, 
in 
the 
next 
place, 
make 
an 
orderly 
review 
of 
the 
notions 
we 
have 
in 
our 
minds, 
and 
hold 
as 
true 
all 
and 
only 
those 
which 
we 
will 
clearly 
and 
distinctly 
apprehend. 
In 
this 
way 
we 
will 
observe, 
first 
of 
all, 
that 
we 
exist 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
our 
nature 
to 
think, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
that 
there 
is 
a 
God 
upon 
whom 
we 
depend; 
and 
after 
considering 
his 
attributes 
we 
will 
be 
able 
to 
investigate 
the 
truth 
of 
all 
other 
things, 
since 
God 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
them. 
Besides 
the 
notions 
we 
have 
of 
God 
and 
of 
our 
mind, 
we 
will 
likewise 
find 
that 
we 
possess 
the 
knowledge 
of 
many 
propositions 
which 
are 
eternally 
true, 
as, 
for 
example, 
that 
nothing 
cannot 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
anything, 
etc. 
We 
will 
farther 
discover 
in 
our 
minds 
the 
knowledge 
of 
a 
corporeal 
or 
extended 
nature 
that 
may 
be 
moved, 
divided, 
etc., 
and 
also 
of 
certain 
sensations 
that 
affect 
us, 
as 
of 
pain, 
colours, 
tastes, 
etc., 
although 
we 
do 
not 
yet 
know 
the 
cause 
of 
our 
being 
so 
affected; 
and, 
comparing 
what 
we 
have 
now 
learne'd, 
by 
examining 
those 
things 
in 
their 
order, 
with 
our 
former 
confused 
knowledge 
of 
them, 
we 
will 
acquire 
the 
habit 
of 
forming 
clear 
and 
distinct 
conceptions 
of 
all 
the 
objects 
we 
are 
capable 
of 
knowing. 
In 
these 
few 
precepts 
seem 
to 
me 
to 
be 
comprised 
the 
most 
general 
and 
important 
principles 
of 
human 
knowledge. 


LXXVI. 
That 
we 
ought 
to 
prefer 
the 
Divine 
authority 
to 
our 
perception; 
[Footnote: 
"reasonings."—FRENCH]. 
but 
that, 
apart 
from 
things 
revealed, 
we 
ought 
to 
assent 
to 
nothing 
that 
we 
do 
not 
clearly 
apprehend. 
Above 
all, 
we 
must 
impress 
on 
our 
memory 
the 
infallible 
rule, 
that 
what 
God 
has 
revealed 
is 
incomparably 
more 
certain 
than 
anything 
else; 
and 
that, 
we 
ought 
to 
submit 
our 
belief 
to 
the 
Divine 
authority 
rather 
than 
to 
our 
own 
judgment, 
even 
although 
perhaps 
the 
light 
of 
reason 
should, 
with 
the 
greatest 
clearness 
and 
evidence, 
appear 
to 
suggest 
to 
us 
something 
contrary 
to 
what 
is 
revealed. 
But 
in 
things 
regarding 
which 
there 
is 
no 
revelation, 
it 
is 
by 
no 
means 
consistent 
with 
the 
character 
of 
a 
philosopher 
to 
accept 
as 
true 
what 
he 
has 
not 
ascertained 
to 
be 
such, 
and 
to 
trust 
more 
to 
the 
senses, 
in 
other 
words, 
to 
the 
inconsiderate 
judgments 
of 
childhood 
than 
to 
the 
dictates 
of 
mature 
reason. 


PART 
II. 



OF 
THE 
PRINCIPLES 
OF 
MATERIAL 
THINGS. 


I. 
The 
grounds 
on 
which 
the 
existence 
of 
material 
things 
may 
be 
known 
with 
certainty. 
Although 
we 
are 
all 
sufficiently 
persuaded 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
material 
things, 
yet, 
since 
this 
was 
before 
called 
in 
question 
by 
us, 
and 
since 
we 
reckoned 
the 
persuasion 
of 
their 
existence 
as 
among 
the 
prejudices 
of 
our 
childhood, 
it 
is 
now 
necessary 
for 
us 
to 
investigate 
the 
grounds 
on 
which 
this 
truth 
may 
be 
known 
with 
certainty. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
then, 
it 
cannot 
be 
doubted 
that 
every 
perception 
we 
have 
comes 
to 
us 
from 
some 
object 
different 
from 
our 
mind; 
for 
it 
is 
not 
in 
our 
power 
to 
cause 
ourselves 
to 
experience 
one 
perception 
rather 
than 
another, 
the 
perception 
being 
entirely 
dependent 
on 
the 
object 
which 
affects 
our 
senses. 
It 
may, 
indeed, 
be 
matter 
of 
inquiry 
whether 
that 
object 
be 
God, 
or 
something 
different 
from 
God; 
but 
because 
we 
perceive, 
or 
rather, 
stimulated 
by 
sense, 
clearly 
and 
distinctly 
apprehend, 
certain 
matter 
extended 
in 
length, 
breadth, 
and 
thickness, 
the 
various 
parts 
of 
which 
have 
different 
figures 
and 
motions, 
and 
give 
rise 
to 
the 
sensation 
we 
have 
of 
colours, 
smells, 
pain, 
etc., 
God 
would, 
without 
question, 
deserve 
to 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
deceiver, 
if 
he 
directly 
and 
of 
himself 
presented 
to 
our 
mind 
the 
idea 
of 
this 
extended 
matter, 
or 
merely 
caused 
it 
to 
be 
presented 
to 
us 
by 
some 
object 
which 
possessed 
neither 
extension, 
figure, 
nor 
motion. 
For 
we 
clearly 
conceive 
this 
matter 
as 
entirely 
distinct 
from 
God, 
and 
from 
ourselves, 
or 
our 
mind; 
and 
appear 
even 
clearly 
to 
discern 
that 
the 
idea 
of 
it 
is 
formed 
in 
us 
on 
occasion 
of 
objects 
existing 
out 
of 
our 
minds, 
to 
which 
it 
is 
in 
every 
respect 
similar. 
But 
since 
God 
cannot 
deceive 
us, 
for 
this 
is 
repugnant 
to 
his 
nature, 
as 
has 
been 
already 
remarked, 
we 
must 
unhesitatingly 
conclude 
that 
there 
exists 
a 
certain 
object 
extended 
in 
length, 
breadth, 
and 
thickness, 
and 
possessing 
all 
those 
properties 
which 
we 
clearly 
apprehend 
to 
belong 
to 
what 
is 
extended. 
And 
this 
extended 
substance 
is 
what 
we 
call 
body 
or 
matter. 


II. 
How 
we 
likewise 
know 
that 
the 
human 
body 
is 
closely 
connected 
with 
the 
mind. 
We 
ought 
also 
to 
conclude 
that 
a 
certain 
body 
is 
more 
closely 
united 
to 
our 
mind 
than 
any 
other, 
because 
we 
clearly 
observe 
that 
pain 
and 
other 
sensations 
affect 
us 
without 
our 
foreseeing 
them; 
and 
these, 
the 
mind 
is 
conscious, 
do 
not 
arise 
from 
itself 
alone, 
nor 
pertain 
to 
it, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
a 



thing 
which 
thinks, 
but 
only 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
united 
to 
another 
thing 
extended 
and 
movable, 
which 
is 
called 
the 
human 
body. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
the 
place 
to 
treat 
in 
detail 
of 
this 
matter. 


III. 
That 
the 
perceptions 
of 
the 
senses 
do 
not 
teach 
us 
what 
is 
in 
reality 
in 
things, 
but 
what 
is 
beneficial 
of 
hurtful 
to 
the 
composite 
whole 
of 
mind 
and 
body. 
It 
will 
be 
sufficient 
to 
remark 
that 
the 
perceptions 
of 
the 
senses 
are 
merely 
to 
be 
referred 
to 
this 
intimate 
union 
of 
the 
human 
body 
and 
mind, 
and 
that 
they 
usually 
make 
us 
aware 
of 
what, 
in 
external 
objects, 
may 
be 
useful 
or 
adverse 
to 
this 
union, 
but 
do 
not 
present 
to 
us 
these 
objects 
as 
they 
are 
in 
themselves, 
unless 
occasionally 
and 
by 
accident. 
For, 
after 
this 
observation, 
we 
will 
without 
difficulty 
lay 
aside 
the 
prejudices 
of 
the 
senses, 
and 
will 
have 
recourse 
to 
our 
understanding 
alone 
on 
this 
question 
by 
reflecting 
carefully 
on 
the 
ideas 
implanted 
in 
it 
by 
nature. 


IV. 
That 
the 
nature 
of 
body 
consists 
not 
in 
weight 
hardness, 
colour 
and 
the 
like, 
but 
in 
extension 
alone. 
In 
this 
way 
we 
will 
discern 
that 
the 
nature 
of 
matter 
or 
body, 
considered 
in 
general, 
does 
not 
consist 
in 
its 
being 
hard, 
or 
ponderous, 
or 
coloured, 
or 
that 
which 
affects 
our 
senses 
in 
any 
other 
way, 
but 
simply 
in 
its 
being 
a 
substance 
extended 
in 
length, 
breadth, 
and 
depth. 
For 
with 
respect 
to 
hardness, 
we 
know 
nothing 
of 
it 
by 
sense 
farther 
than 
that 
the 
parts 
of 
hard 
bodies 
resist 
the 
motion 
of 
our 
hands 
on 
coming 
into 
contact 
with 
them; 
but 
if 
every 
time 
our 
hands 
moved 
towards 
any 
part, 
all 
the 
bodies 
in 
that 
place 
receded 
as 
quickly 
as 
our 
hands 
approached, 
we 
should 
never 
feel 
hardness; 
and 
yet 
we 
have 
no 
reason 
to 
believe 
that 
bodies 
which 
might 
thus 
recede 
would 
on 
this 
account 
lose 
that 
which 
makes 
them 
bodies. 
The 
nature 
of 
body 
does 
not, 
therefore, 
consist 
in 
hardness. 
In 
the 
same 
way, 
it 
may 
be 
shown 
that 
weight, 
colour, 
and 
all 
the 
other 
qualities 
of 
this 
sort, 
which 
are 
perceived 
in 
corporeal 
matter, 
may 
be 
taken 
from 
it, 
itself 
meanwhile 
remaining 
entire: 
it 
thus 
follows 
that 
the 
nature 
of 
body 
depends 
on 
none 
of 
these. 


V. 
That 
the 
truth 
regarding 
the 
nature 
of 
body 
is 
obscured 
by 
the 
opinions 
respecting 
rarefaction 
and 
a 
vacuum 
with 
which 
we 
are 
pre-occupied. 

There 
still 
remain 
two 
causes 
to 
prevent 
its 
being 
fully 
admitted 
that 
the 
true 
nature 
of 
body 
consists 
in 
extension 
alone. 
The 
first 
is 
the 
prevalent 
opinion, 
that 
most 
bodies 
admit 
of 
being 
so 
rarefied 
and 
condensed 
that, 
when 
rarefied, 
they 
have 
greater 
extension 
than 
when 
condensed; 
and 
some 
even 
have 
subtilized 
to 
such 
a 
degree 
as 
to 
make 
a 
distinction 
between 
the 
substance 
of 
body 
and 
its 
quantity, 
and 
between 
quantity 
itself 
and 
extension. 
The 
second 
cause 
is 
this, 
that 
where 
we 
conceive 
only 
extension 
in 
length, 
breadth, 
and 
depth, 
we 
are 
not 
in 
the 
habit 
of 
saying 
that 
body 
is 
there, 
but 
only 
space 
and 
further 
void 
space, 
which 
the 
generality 
believe 
to 
be 
a 
mere 
negation. 


VI. 
In 
what 
way 
rarefaction 
takes 
place. 
But 
with 
regard 
to 
rarefaction 
and 
condensation, 
whoever 
gives 
his 
attention 
to 
his 
own 
thoughts, 
and 
admits 
nothing 
of 
which 
he 
is 
not 
clearly 
conscious, 
will 
not 
suppose 
that 
there 
is 
anything 
in 
those 
processes 
further 
than 
a 
change 
of 
figure 
in 
the 
body 
rarefied 
or 
condensed: 
so 
that, 
in 
other 
words, 
rare 
bodies 
are 
those 
between 
the 
parts 
of 
which 
there 
are 
numerous 
distances 
filled 
with 
other 
bodies; 
and 
dense 
bodies, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
those 
whose 
parts 
approaching 
each 
other, 
either 
diminish 
these 
distances 
or 
take 
them 
wholly 
away, 
in 
the 
latter 
of 
which 
cases 
the 
body 
is 
rendered 
absolutely 
dense. 
The 
body, 
however, 
when 
condensed, 
has 
not, 
therefore, 
less 
extension 
than 
when 
the 
parts 
embrace 
a 
greater 
space, 
owing 
to 
their 
removal 
from 
each 
other, 
and 
their 
dispersion 
into 
branches. 
For 
we 
ought 
not 
to 
attribute 
to 
it 
the 
extension 
of 
the 
pores 
or 
distances 
which 
its 
parts 
do 
not 
occupy 
when 
it 
is 
rarefied, 
but 
to 
the 
other 
bodies 
that 
fill 
these 
interstices; 
just 
as 
when 
we 
see 
a 
sponge 
full 
of 
water 
or 
any 
other 
liquid, 
we 
do 
not 
suppose 
that 
each 
part 
of 
the 
sponge 
has 
on 
this 
account 
greater 
extension 
than 
when 
compressed 
and 
dry, 
but 
only 
that 
its 
pores 
are 
wider, 
and 
therefore 
that 
the 
body 
is 
diffused 
over 
a 
larger 
space. 


VII. 
That 
rarefaction 
cannot 
be 
intelligibly 
explained 
unless 
in 
the 
way 
here 
proposed. 
And 
indeed 
I 
am 
unable 
to 
discover 
the 
force 
of 
the 
reasons 
which 
have 
induced 
some 
to 
say 
that 
rarefaction 
is 
the 
result 
of 
the 
augmentation 
of 
the 
quantity 
of 
body, 
rather 
than 
to 
explain 
it 
on 
the 
principle 
exemplified 
in 
the 



case 
of 
a 
sponge. 
For 
although 
when 
air 
or 
water 
is 
rarefied 
we 
do 
not 
see 
any 
of 
the 
pores 
that 
are 
rendered 
large, 
or 
the 
new 
body 
that 
is 
added 
to 
occupy 
them, 
it 
is 
yet 
less 
agreeable 
to 
reason 
to 
suppose 
something 
that 
is 
unintelligible 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
giving 
a 
verbal 
and 
merely 
apparent 
explanation 
of 
the 
rarefaction 
of 
bodies, 
than 
to 
conclude, 
because 
of 
their 
rarefaction, 
that 
there 
are 
pores 
or 
distances 
between 
the 
parts 
which 
are 
increased 
in 
size, 
and 
filled 
with 
some 
new 
body. 
Nor 
ought 
we 
to 
refrain 
from 
assenting 
to 
this 
explanation, 
because 
we 
perceive 
this 
new 
body 
by 
none 
of 
our 
senses, 
for 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
which 
obliges 
us 
to 
believe 
that 
we 
should 
perceive 
by 
our 
senses 
all 
the 
bodies 
in 
existence. 
And 
we 
see 
that 
it 
is 
very 
easy 
to 
explain 
rarefaction 
in 
this 
manner, 
but 
impossible 
in 
any 
other; 
for, 
in 
fine, 
there 
would 
be, 
as 
appears 
to 
me, 
a 
manifest 
contradiction 
in 
supposing 
that 
any 
body 
was 
increased 
by 
a 
quantity 
or 
extension 
which 
it 
had 
not 
before, 
without 
the 
addition 
to 
it 
of 
a 
new 
extended 
substance, 
in 
other 
words, 
of 
another 
body, 
because 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
conceive 
any 
addition 
of 
extension 
or 
quantity 
to 
a 
thing 
without 
supposing 
the 
addition 
of 
a 
substance 
having 
quantity 
or 
extension, 
as 
will 
more 
clearly 
appear 
from 
what 
follows. 


VIII. 
That 
quantity 
and 
number 
differ 
only 
in 
thought 
(RATIONE) 
from 
that 
which 
has 
quantity 
and 
is 
numbered. 
For 
quantity 
differs 
from 
extended 
substance, 
and 
number 
from 
what 
is 
numbered, 
not 
in 
reality 
but 
merely 
in 
our 
thought; 
so 
that, 
for 
example, 
we 
may 
consider 
the 
whole 
nature 
of 
a 
corporeal 
substance 
which 
is 
comprised 
in 
a 
space 
of 
ten 
feet, 
although 
we 
do 
not 
attend 
to 
this 
measure 
of 
ten 
feet, 
for 
the 
obvious 
reason 
that 
the 
thing 
conceived 
is 
of 
the 
same 
nature 
in 
any 
part 
of 
that 
space 
as 
in 
the 
whole; 
and, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
we 
can 
conceive 
the 
number 
ten, 
as 
also 
a 
continuous 
quantity 
of 
ten 
feet, 
without 
thinking 
of 
this 
determinate 
substance, 
because 
the 
concept 
of 
the 
number 
ten 
is 
manifestly 
the 
same 
whether 
we 
consider 
a 
number 
of 
ten 
feet 
or 
ten 
of 
anything 
else; 
and 
we 
can 
conceive 
a 
continuous 
quantity 
of 
ten 
feet 
without 
thinking 
of 
this 
or 
that 
determinate 
substance, 
although 
we 
cannot 
conceive 
it 
without 
some 
extended 
substance 
of 
which 
it 
is 
the 
quantity. 
It 
is 
in 
reality, 
however, 
impossible 
that 
any, 
even 
the 
least 
part, 
of 
such 
quantity 
or 
extension, 
can 
be 
taken 
away, 
without 
the 
retrenchment 
at 
the 
same 
time 
of 
as 
much 
of 
the 



substance, 
nor, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
can 
we 
lessen 
the 
substance, 
without 
at 
the 
same 
time 
taking 
as 
much 
from 
the 
quantity 
or 
extension. 


IX. 
That 
corporeal 
substance, 
when 
distinguished 
from 
its 
quantity, 
is 
confusedly 
conceived 
as 
something 
incorporeal. 
Although 
perhaps 
some 
express 
themselves 
otherwise 
on 
this 
matter, 
I 
am 
nevertheless 
convinced 
that 
they 
do 
not 
think 
differently 
from 
what 
I 
have 
now 
said: 
for 
when 
they 
distinguish 
(corporeal) 
substance 
from 
extension 
or 
quantity, 
they 
either 
mean 
nothing 
by 
the 
word 
(corporeal) 
substance, 
or 
they 
form 
in 
their 
minds 
merely 
a 
confused 
idea 
of 
incorporeal 
substance, 
which 
they 
falsely 
attribute 
to 
corporeal, 
and 
leave 
to 
extension 
the 
true 
idea 
of 
this 
corporeal 
substance; 
which 
extension 
they 
call 
an 
accident, 
but 
with 
such 
impropriety 
as 
to 
make 
it 
easy 
to 
discover 
that 
their 
words 
are 
not 
in 
harmony 
with 
their 
thoughts. 


X. 
What 
space 
or 
internal 
place 
is. 
Space 
or 
internal 
place, 
and 
the 
corporeal 
substance 
which 
is 
comprised 
in 
it, 
are 
not 
different 
in 
reality, 
but 
merely 
in 
the 
mode 
in 
which 
they 
are 
wont 
to 
be 
conceived 
by 
us. 
For, 
in 
truth, 
the 
same 
extension 
in 
length, 
breadth, 
and 
depth, 
which 
constitutes 
space, 
constitutes 
body; 
and 
the 
difference 
between 
them 
lies 
only 
in 
this, 
that 
in 
body 
we 
consider 
extension 
as 
particular, 
and 
conceive 
it 
to 
change 
with 
the 
body; 
whereas 
in 
space 
we 
attribute 
to 
extension 
a 
generic 
unity, 
so 
that 
after 
taking 
from 
a 
certain 
space 
the 
body 
which 
occupied 
it, 
we 
do 
not 
suppose 
that 
we 
have 
at 
the 
same 
time 
removed 
the 
extension 
of 
the 
space, 
because 
it 
appears 
to 
us 
that 
the 
same 
extension 
remains 
there 
so 
long 
as 
it 
is 
of 
the 
same 
magnitude 
and 
figure, 
and 
preserves 
the 
same 
situation 
in 
respect 
to 
certain 
bodies 
around 
it, 
by 
means 
of 
which 
we 
determine 
this 
space. 


XI. 
How 
space 
is 
not 
in 
reality 
different 
from 
corporeal 
substance. 
And 
indeed 
it 
will 
be 
easy 
to 
discern 
that 
it 
is 
the 
same 
extension 
which 
constitutes 
the 
nature 
of 
body 
as 
of 
space, 
and 
that 
these 
two 
things 
are 
mutually 
diverse 
only 
as 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
genus 
and 
species 
differs 
from 
that 
of 
the 
individual, 
provided 
we 
reflect 
on 
the 
idea 
we 
have 
of 
any 
body, 
taking 
a 
stone 
for 
example, 
and 
reject 
all 
that 
is 
not 
essential 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
body. 



In 
the 
first 
place, 
then, 
hardness 
may 
b 
liquefied 
or 
reduced 
to 
powder, 
it 
would 
would 
not 
cease 
to 
be 
a 
body; 
colour 
because 
we 
have 
frequently 
seen 
stones 
again, 
we 
may 
reject 
weight, 
because 
w 
very 
light, 
is 
still 
a 
body; 
and, 
finally, 
other 
qualities 
of 
this 
sort, 
either 
becau 
stone, 
or 
because, 
with 
the 
change 
o 
supposed 
to 
have 
lost 
the 
nature 
of 
body 
that 
nothing 
remains 
in 
the 
idea 
of 
body 
in 
length, 
breadth, 
and 
depth; 
and 
this 
s 
space, 
not 
only 
of 
that 
which 
is 
full 
of 
b 
space. 


XII. 
How 
space 
differs 
from 
body 
in 
our 
There 
is, 
however, 
some 
difference 
betw 
for 
if 
we 
remove 
a 
stone 
from 
the 
space 
that 
its 
extension 
also 
is 
taken 
away, 
bec 
inseparable 
from 
the 
stone 
itself: 
but 
m 
extension 
of 
place 
in 
which 
this 
stone 
w 
stone 
be 
occupied 
by 
wood, 
water, 
air 
supposed 
vacant, 
because 
we 
now 
cons 
that 
the 
same 
is 
common 
to 
stones, 
wo 
even 
to 
a 
vacuum 
itself, 
if 
there 
is 
any 
s 
magnitude 
and 
figure 
as 
before, 
and 
pr

bodies 
which 
determine

spa 


XIII. 
What 
external 
place 
is. 
The 
reason 
of 
which 
is, 
that

A 
Discourse 
OF 
A 
METHOD 
For 
the 
well 
guiding 
of 
REASON, 
And 
the 
Discovery 
of 
Truth 
In 
the 
SCIENCES. 


LONDON, 
Printed 
byThomas 
Newcombe 
MDCXLIX. 
[i] 


To 
the 
Understanding 
READER. 


The 
Great 
DESCARTES 
(who 
may 
justly 
challenge 
the 
first 
place 
amongst 
the 
Philosophers 
of 
this 
Age) 
is 
the 
Author 
of 
this 
Discourse; 
which 
in 
the 
Originall 
was 
so 
well 
known, 
That 
it 
could 
be 
no 
mans 
but 
his 
own, 
that 
his 
Name 
[ii]was 
not 
affix’d 
to 
it: 
I 
need 
say 
no 
more 
either 
of 
Him 
or 
It; 
He 
is 
best 
made 
known 
by 
Himself, 
and 
his 
Writings 
want 
nothing 
but 
thy 
reading 
to 
commend 
them. 
But 
as 
those 
who 
cannot 
compasse 
the 
Originals 
of 
Titian 
and 
Van-Dyke, 
are 
glad 
to 
adorne 
their 
Cabinets 
with 
the 
Copies 
of 
them; 
So 
be 
pleased 
favourably 
to 
receive 
his 
Picture 
from 
my 
hand, 
copied 
after 
his 
own 
Designe: 
You 
may 
therein 
observe 
the 
lines 
of 
a 
well 
form’d 
Minde, 
The 
hightnings 
of 
Truth, 
The 
sweetnings 
and 
shadowings 
of 
Probabilities, 
The 
falls 
and 
depths 
of 
Falshood; 
all 
which 
serve 
to 
perfect 
this 
Masterpiece. 
[iii]Now 
although 
my 
after-draught 
be 
rude 
and 
unpolished, 
and 
that 
perhaps 
I 
have 
touch’d 
it 
too 
boldly, 
The 
thoughts 
of 
so 
clear 
a 
Minde, 
being 
so 
extremely 
fine, 
That 
as 
the 
choisest 
words 
are 
too 
grosse, 
and 
fall 
short 
fully 
to 
expresse 
such 
sublime 
Notions; 
So 
it 
cannot 
be, 
but 
being 
transvested, 
it 
must 
necessarily 
lose 
very 
much 
of 
its 
native 
Lustre: 
Nay, 



although 
I 
am 
conscious 
(notwithstanding 
the 
care 
I 
have 
taken 
neither 
to 
wrong 
the 
Authours 
Sense, 
nor 
offend 
the 
Readers 
Ear) 
of 
many 
escapes 
which 
I 
have 
made; 
yet 
I 
so 
little 
doubt 
of 
being 
excused, 
That 
I 
am 
confident, 
my 
endeavour 
[iv]cannot 
but 
be 
gratefull 
to 
all 
Lovers 
of 
Learning; 
for 
whose 
benefit 
I 
have 
Englished, 
and 
to 
whom 
I 
addresse 
this 
Essay, 
which 
contains 
a 
Method, 
by 
the 
Rules 
whereof 
we 
may 
Shape 
our 
better 
part, 
Rectifie 
ourReason, 
Form 
our 
Manners 
and 
Square 
our 
Actions, 
Adorn 
our 
Mindes, 
and 
making 
a 
diligent 
Enquiry 
into 
Nature, 
wee 
may 
attain 
to 
the 
Knowledge 
of 
the 
Truth, 
which 
is 
the 
most 
desirable 
union 
in 
the 
World. 


Our 
Authour 
also 
invites 
all 
letterd 
men 
to 
his 
assistance 
in 
the 
prosecution 
of 
this 
Search; 
That 
for 
the 
good 
of 
Mankinde, 
They 
would 
practise 
and 
communicate 
[v]Experiments, 
for 
the 
use 
of 
all 
those 
who 
labour 
for 
the 
perfection 
of 
arts 
and 
sciences: 
every 
man 
now 
being 
obliged 
to 
the 
furtherance 
of 
so 
beneficiall 
an 
undertaking, 
I 
could 
not 
but 
lend 
my 
hand 
to 
open 
the 
curtain, 
and 
discover 
this 
new 
model 
of 
philosophy; 
which 
I 
now 
publish, 
neither 
to 
humour 
the 
present, 
nor 
disgust 
former 
times; 
but 
rather 
that 
it 
may 
serve 
for 
an 
innocent 
divertisement 
to 
those, 
who 
would 
rather 
reform 
themselves, 
then 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
world; 
and 
who, 
having 
the 
same 
seeds 
and 
grounds, 
and 
knowing 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
new 
under 
the 
sun; 
that 
novelty 
is 
but 
oblivion, 
[vi]and 
that 
knowledge 
is 
but 
remembrance, 
will 
study 
to 
finde 
out 
in 
themselves, 
and 
restore 
to 
posterity 
those 
lost 
arts, 
which 
render 
antiquity 
so 
venerable; 
and 
strive 
(if 
it 
be 
possible) 
to 
go 
beyond 
them 
in 
other 
things, 
as 
well 
as 
time: 
who 
minde 
not 
those 
things 
which 
are 
above, 
beyond, 
or 
without 
them; 
but 
would 
rather 
limit 
their 
desires 
by 
their 
power, 
then 
change 
the 
course 
of 
nature; 
who 
seek 
the 
knowledge, 
and 
labour 
for 
the 
conquest 
of 
themselves; 
who 
have 
vertue 
enough 
to 
make 
their 
own 
fortune; 
and 
who 
prefer 
the 
culture 
of 
the 
minde 
before 
the 
adorning 
of 
the 
body; 
[vii]to 
such 
as 
these 
I 
present 
this 
discourse 
(whose 
pardon 
I 
beg, 
for 
having 
so 
long 
detain’d 
them 
from 
so 
desirable 
a 
conversation;) 
and 
conclude 
with 
this 
advice 
of 
the 
divine 
plato: 


Cogita 
in 
te, 
præter 
Animum, 
nihil 
esse 
mirabile.

A 
DISCOURSE 
OF 
A 
METHOD, 



For 
the 
wel-guiding 
ofREASON; 
AND 
The 
discovery 
of 
TRUTH 
in 
the 
SCIENCES. 


If 
this 
Discourse 
seem 
too 
long 
to 
be 
read 
at 
once, 
it 
may 
be 
divided 
into 
six 
parts. 
In 
the 
first, 
are 
divers 
Considerations 
touching 
the 
Sciences. 
In 
the 
second, 
the 
principall 
Rules 
of 
that 
Method 
which 
the 
Author 
hath 
studyed. 
In 
the 
third, 
some 
of 
those 
in 
morality, 
which 
he 
hath 
drawn 
from 
this 
Method. 
In 
the 
fourth, 
the 
reasons 
whereby 
the 
existence 
of 
God 
and 
of 
the 
humane 
Soul 
is 
proved; 
which 
[2]are 
the 
grounds 
of 
his 
Metaphysicks. 
In 
the 
fift, 
the 
order 
of 
these 
Physicall 
questions, 
which 
he 
hath 
examined, 
and 
particularly 
the 
explication 
of 
the 
hearts 
motion; 
with 
some 
other 
difficulties 
relating 
to 
Physick; 
as 
also 
the 
difference 
between 
our 
Souls 
and 
those 
of 
beasts. 
In 
the 
last, 
what 
he 
conceives 
requisit 
to 
make 
a 
further 
inquiry 
into 
Nature, 
then 
hath 
hitherto 
been 
made. 
And 
what 
reasons 
induc’d 
him 
to 
write. 


PART. 
I. 


Right 
understanding 
is 
the 
most 
equally 
divided 
thing 
in 
the 
World; 
for 
every 
one 
beleevs 
himself 
so 
well 
stor’d 
with 
it, 
that 
even 
those 
who 
in 
all 
other 
things 
are 
the 
hardest 
to 
be 
pleas’d, 
seldom 
desire 
more 
of 
it 
then 
they 
have; 
wherein 
it 
is 
not 
likely 
that 
all 
[3]Men 
are 
deceived: 
But 
it 
rather 
witnesseth, 
That 
the 
faculty 
of 
right-judging 
and 
distinguishing 
truth 
from 
falshood 
(which 
is 
properly 
call’d, 
Understanding 
or 
Reason) 
is 
naturally 
equal 
in 
all 
Men. 
And 
as 
the 
diversity 
of 
our 
Opinions, 
is 
not, 
because 
some 
are 
more 
reasonable 
then 
others; 
but 
only 
that 
we 
direct 
our 
thoughts 
several 
ways, 
neither 
do 
we 
consider 
the 
same 
things. 
For 
’tis 
not 
enough 
to 
have 
good 
faculties, 
but 
the 
principal 
is, 
to 
apply 
them 
well. 
The 
greatest 
Souls 
are 
as 
capable 
of 
the 
greatest 
Vices, 
as 
of 
the 
most 
eminent 
Vertues: 
And 
those 
who 
move 
but 
very 
slowly, 
may 
advance 
much 
farther, 
if 
they 
always 
follow 
the 
right 
way; 
then 
those 
who 
run 
and 
straggle 
from 
it. 


For 
my 
part, 
I 
never 
presum’d 
that 
my 
Minde 
was 
more 
perfect 
in 
any 
thing 
then 
an 
ordinary 
Mans; 
nay, 
I 
have 
often 
wish’d 
to 
have 
had 
my 



thoughts 
as 
quick, 
my 
imagination 
as 
clear 
and 
distinct, 
and 
my 
memory 
as 
[4]large 
and 
as 
ready 
as 
some 
other 
Men 
have 
had. 
And 
I 
know 
no 
Qualities 
which 
serve 
more 
then 
those 
to 
the 
perfection 
of 
the 
Minde; 
for 
as 
for 
Reason 
or 
Understanding, 
forasmuch 
as 
it 
is 
the 
only 
thing 
which 
makes 
us 
Men, 
and 
distinguisheth 
us 
from 
beasts, 
I 
will 
beleeve 
it 
to 
be 
entire 
in 
every 
One, 
and 
follow 
herein 
the 
common 
opinion 
of 
the 
Philosophers, 
who 
say, 
That 
there 
is 
only 
more 
or 
less 
among 
the 
Accidents, 
and 
not 
amongst 
the 
Forms 
or 
nature 
of 
the 
Individuals 
of 
one 
species. 


But 
I 
shall 
not 
stick 
to 
say, 
That 
I 
beleeve 
my 
self 
very 
happy, 
in 
having 
encountred 
from 
my 
youth 
with 
certain 
ways 
which 
have 
led 
me 
to 
considerations 
and 
Maximes, 
from 
which 
I 
have 
found 
a 
Method; 
whereby 
methinks, 
I 
have 
the 
means 
by 
degrees 
to 
augment 
my 
knowledg, 
and 
by 
little 
and 
little 
to 
raise 
it 
up 
to 
the 
highest 
pitch, 
whereto 
the 
meaness 
of 
my 
capacity, 
& 
the 
short 
course 
of 
my 
life 
can 
permit 
it 
to 
attain. 
For 
I 
have 
[5]already 
reaped 
such 
fruits 
from 
it, 
that 
although 
in 
the 
judgment 
I 
make 
of 
my 
self, 
I 
endevour 
always 
rather 
to 
incline 
to 
mistrust, 
then 
to 
presumption. 
And 
looking 
on 
the 
divers 
actions 
and 
undertakings 
of 
all 
Men, 
with 
the 
eye 
of 
a 
Philosopher, 
there 
is 
almost 
none 
which 
to 
me 
seems 
not 
vain 
and 
useless. 
Yet 
I 
am 
extremely 
satisfied 
with 
the 
Progress, 
which 
(as 
it 
seems 
to 
me) 
I 
have 
already 
made 
in 
the 
search 
of 
Truth, 
and 
do 
conceive 
such 
hopes 
for 
the 
future, 
That 
if 
among 
the 
employments 
of 
Men, 
purely 
Men, 
there 
is 
any 
solidly 
good, 
and 
of 
importance, 
I 
dare 
beleeve 
it 
is 
that 
which 
I 
have 
chosen: 
Yet 
it 
may 
be 
that 
I 
deceive 
my 
self, 
and 
perhaps 
it 
is 
but 
a 
little 
Copper 
and 
Glass 
which 
I 
take 
for 
Gold 
and 
Diamonds. 
I 
know 
how 
subject 
we 
are 
to 
mistake 
in 
those 
things 
which 
concern 
us, 
and 
how 
jealous 
we 
ought 
to 
be 
of 
the 
judgment 
of 
our 
friends, 
when 
it 
is 
in 
our 
favor. 
But 
I 
should 
willingly 
in 
this 
Discourse, 
trace 
out 
unto 
you 
the 
[6]ways 
which 
I 
have 
followed, 
and 
represent 
therein 
my 
life, 
as 
in 
a 
Picture, 
to 
the 
end, 
that 
every 
one 
may 
judge 
thereof; 
and 
that 
learning 
from 
common 
Fame, 
what 
mens 
opinions 
are 
of 
it, 
I 
may 
finde 
a 
new 
means 
of 
instructing 
my 
self; 
which 
I 
shall 
add 
to 
those 
which 
I 
customarily 
make 
use 
of. 


Neither 
is 
it 
my 
design 
to 
teach 
a 
Method 
which 
every 
Man 
ought 
to 
follow, 
for 
the 
good 
conduct 
of 
his 
reason; 
but 
only 
to 
shew 
after 
what 
manner 
I 
have 
endevoured 
to 
order 
mine 
own. 
Those 
who 
undertake 
to 
give 
precepts, 
ought 
to 
esteem 
themselves 
more 
able, 
then 
those 
to 
whom 
they 
give 
them, 
and 
are 
blame-worthy, 
if 
they 
fail 
in 
the 
least. 
But 
proposing 
this 



but 
as 
a 
History, 
or 
if 
you 
will 
have 
it 
so, 
but 
as 
a 
Fable; 
wherein 
amongst 
other 
examples, 
which 
may 
be 
imitated, 
we 
may 
perhaps 
find 
divers 
others 
which 
we 
may 
have 
reason 
to 
decline: 
I 
hope 
it 
will 
be 
profitable 
to 
some, 
[7]without 
being 
hurtfull 
to 
any; 
and 
that 
the 
liberty 
I 
take 
will 
be 
gratefull 
to 
all. 


I 
have 
been 
bred 
up 
to 
Letters 
from 
mine 
infancy; 
& 
because 
I 
was 
perswaded, 
that 
by 
their 
means 
a 
man 
might 
acquire 
a 
clear 
and 
certain 
knowledg 
of 
all 
that’s 
usefull 
for 
this 
life, 
I 
was 
extremely 
desirous 
to 
learn 
them: 
But 
as 
soon 
as 
I 
had 
finish’d 
all 
the 
course 
of 
my 
Studies, 
at 
the 
end 
whereof 
Men 
are 
usually 
receiv’d 
amongst 
the 
rank 
of 
the 
learned. 
I 
wholly 
changed 
my 
opinion, 
for 
I 
found 
my 
self 
intangled 
in 
so 
many 
doubts 
and 
errors, 
that 
me 
thought 
I 
had 
made 
no 
other 
profit 
in 
seeking 
to 
instruct 
my 
self, 
but 
that 
I 
had 
the 
more 
discovered 
mine 
own 
ignorance. 
Yet 
I 
was 
in 
one 
of 
the 
most 
famous 
Schools 
in 
Europe; 
where 
I 
thought, 
if 
there 
were 
any 
on 
earth, 
there 
ought 
to 
have 
been 
learned 
Men. 
I 
had 
learnt 
all 
what 
others 
had 
learnt; 
even 
unsatisfied 
with 
the 
Sciences 
which 
were 
taught 
us, 
I 
had 
read 
over 
all 
[8]Books 
(which 
I 
could 
possibly 
procure) 
treating 
of 
such 
as 
are 
held 
to 
be 
the 
rarest 
and 
the 
most 
curious. 
Withall, 
I 
knew 
the 
judgment 
others 
made 
of 
me; 
and 
I 
perceiv’d 
that 
I 
was 
no 
less 
esteem’d 
then 
my 
fellow 
Students, 
although 
there 
were 
some 
amongst 
them 
that 
were 
destin’d 
to 
fill 
our 
Masters 
rooms. 
And 
in 
fine, 
our 
age 
seem’d 
to 
me 
as 
flourishing 
and 
as 
fertile 
of 
good 
Wits, 
as 
any 
of 
the 
preceding, 
which 
made 
me 
take 
the 
liberty 
to 
judg 
of 
all 
other 
men 
by 
my 
self, 
and 
to 
think, 
That 
there 
was 
no 
such 
learning 
in 
the 
world, 
as 
formerly 
I 
had 
been 
made 
beleeve. 


Yet 
did 
I 
continue 
the 
esteem 
I 
had 
of 
those 
exercises 
which 
are 
the 
employments 
of 
the 
Schools: 
I 
knew 
that 
Languages 
which 
are 
there 
learnt, 
are 
necessary 
for 
the 
understanding 
of 
ancient 
Writers, 
That 
the 
quaintness 
of 
Fables 
awakens 
the 
Minde; 
That 
the 
memorable 
actions 
in 
History 
raise 
it 
up, 
and 
that 
being 
read 
with 
discretion, 
they 
help 
to 
form 
the 
judgment. 
[9]That 
the 
reading 
of 
good 
books, 
is 
like 
the 
conversation 
with 
the 
honestest 
persons 
of 
the 
past 
age, 
who 
were 
the 
Authors 
of 
them, 
and 
even 
a 
studyed 
conversation, 
wherein 
they 
discover 
to 
us 
the 
best 
only 
of 
their 
thoughts. 
That 
eloquence 
hath 
forces 
& 
beauties 
which 
are 
incomparable. 
That 
Poetry 
hath 
delicacies 
and 
sweets 
extremly 
ravishing; 
That 
the 
Mathematicks 
hath 
most 
subtile 
inventions, 
which 
very 
much 
conduce 
aswel 
to 
content 
the 
curious, 
as 
to 
facilitate 
all 
arts, 
and 
to 
lessen 
the 
labour 
of 
Men: 
That 
those 
writings 



which 
treat 
of 
manners 
contain 
divers 
instructions, 
and 
exhortations 
to 
vertue, 
which 
are 
very 
usefull. 
That 
Theology 
teacheth 
the 
way 
to 
heaven; 
That 
Philosophy 
affords 
us 
the 
means 
to 
speake 
of 
all 
things 
with 
probability, 
and 
makes 
her 
self 
admir’d, 
by 
the 
least 
knowing 
Men. 
That 
Law, 
Physick 
and 
other 
sciences 
bring 
honor 
and 
riches 
to 
those 
who 
practice 
them; 
Finally 
that 
its 
good 
to 
have 
examin’d 
them 
[10]all 
even 
the 
falsest 
and 
the 
most 
superstitious, 
that 
we 
may 
discover 
their 
just 
value, 
and 
preserve 
our 
selves 
from 
their 
cheats. 


But 
I 
thought 
I 
had 
spent 
time 
enough 
in 
the 
languages, 
and 
even 
also 
in 
the 
lecture 
of 
ancient 
books, 
their 
histories 
and 
their 
fables. 
For 
’tis 
even 
the 
same 
thing 
to 
converse 
with 
those 
of 
former 
ages, 
as 
to 
travel. 
Its 
good 
to 
know 
something 
of 
the 
manners 
of 
severall 
Nations, 
that 
we 
may 
not 
think 
that 
all 
things 
against 
our 
Mode 
are 
ridiculous 
or 
unreasonable, 
as 
those 
are 
wont 
to 
do, 
who 
have 
seen 
Nothing. 
But 
when 
we 
employ 
too 
long 
time 
in 
travell, 
we 
at 
last 
become 
strangers 
to 
our 
own 
Country, 
and 
when 
we 
are 
too 
curious 
of 
those 
things, 
which 
we 
practised 
in 
former 
times, 
we 
commonly 
remain 
ignorant 
of 
those 
which 
are 
now 
in 
use. 
Besides, 
Fables 
make 
us 
imagine 
divers 
events 
possible, 
which 
are 
not 
so: 
And 
that 
even 
the 
most 
faithfull 
Histories, 
if 
they 
neither 
change 
or 
[11]augment 
the 
value 
of 
things, 
to 
render 
them 
the 
more 
worthy 
to 
be 
read, 
at 
least, 
they 
always 
omit 
the 
basest 
and 
less 
remarkable 
circumstances; 
whence 
it 
is, 
that 
the 
rest 
seems 
not 
as 
it 
is; 
and 
that 
those 
who 
form 
their 
Manners 
by 
the 
examples 
they 
thence 
derive, 
are 
subject 
to 
fall 
into 
the 
extravagancies 
of 
the 
Paladins 
of 
our 
Romances, 
and 
to 
conceive 
designes 
beyond 
their 
abilities. 


I 
highly 
priz’d 
Eloquence, 
and 
was 
in 
love 
with 
Poetry; 
but 
I 
esteem’d 
both 
the 
one 
and 
the 
other, 
rather 
gifts 
of 
the 
Minde, 
then 
the 
fruits 
of 
study. 
Those 
who 
have 
the 
strongest 
reasoning 
faculties, 
and 
who 
best 
digest 
their 
thoughts, 
to 
render 
them 
the 
more 
clear 
and 
intelligible, 
may 
always 
the 
better 
perswade 
what 
they 
propose, 
although 
they 
should 
speak 
but 
a 
corrupt 
dialect, 
and 
had 
never 
learnt 
Rhetorick: 
And 
those 
whose 
inventions 
are 
most 
pleasing, 
and 
can 
express 
them 
with 
most 
ornament 
and 
sweetness, 
will 
still 
be 
the 
best 
[12]Poets; 
although 
ignorant 
of 
the 
Art 
of 
Poetry. 


Beyond 
all, 
I 
was 
most 
pleas’d 
with 
the 
Mathematicks, 
for 
the 
certainty 
and 
evidence 
of 
the 
reasons 
thereof; 
but 
I 
did 
not 
yet 
observe 
their 
true 
use, 
and 
thinking 
that 
it 
served 
only 
for 
Mechanick 
Arts; 
I 
wondred, 
that 
since 
the 



grounds 
thereof 
were 
so 
firm 
and 
solid, 
that 
nothing 
more 
sublime 
had 
been 
built 
thereon. 
As 
on 
the 
contrary, 
I 
compar’d 
the 
writings 
of 
the 
Ancient 
heathen 
which 
treated 
of 
Manner, 
to 
most 
proud 
and 
stately 
Palaces 
which 
were 
built 
only 
on 
sand 
and 
mire, 
they 
raise 
the 
vertues 
very 
high, 
and 
make 
them 
appear 
estimable 
above 
all 
the 
things 
in 
the 
world; 
but 
they 
doe 
not 
sufficiently 
instruct 
us 
in 
the 
knowledg 
of 
them, 
and 
often 
what 
they 
call 
by 
that 
fair 
Name, 
is 
but 
a 
stupidness, 
or 
an 
act 
of 
pride, 
or 
of 
despair, 
or 
a 
paricide. 


I 
reverenc’d 
our 
Theology, 
and 
pretended 
to 
heaven 
as 
much 
as 
any; 
But 
having 
learnt 
as 
a 
most 
certain 
[13]Truth, 
that 
the 
way 
to 
it, 
is 
no 
less 
open 
to 
the 
most 
ignorant, 
then 
to 
the 
most 
learned; 
and 
that 
those 
revealed 
truths 
which 
led 
thither, 
were 
beyond 
our 
understanding, 
I 
durst 
not 
submit 
to 
the 
weakness 
of 
my 
ratiocination. 
And 
I 
thought, 
that 
to 
undertake 
to 
examine 
them, 
and 
to 
succeed 
in 
it, 
requir’d 
some 
extraordinary 
assistance 
from 
heaven, 
and 
somewhat 
more 
then 
Man. 
I 
shall 
say 
nothing 
of 
Philosophy, 
but 
that 
seeing 
it 
hath 
been 
cultivated 
by 
the 
most 
excellent 
wits, 
which 
have 
liv’d 
these 
many 
ages, 
and 
that 
yet 
there 
is 
nothing 
which 
is 
undisputed, 
and 
by 
consequence, 
which 
is 
not 
doubtfull. 
I 
could 
not 
presume 
so 
far, 
as 
to 
hope 
to 
succeed 
better 
then 
others. 
And 
considering 
how 
many 
different 
opinions 
there 
may 
be 
on 
the 
same 
thing, 
maintain’d 
by 
learned 
Men, 
and 
yet 
that 
there 
never 
can 
be 
but 
one 
only 
Truth, 
I 
reputed 
almost 
all 
false, 
which 
had 
no 
more 
then 
probability 
in 
it. 


[14]As 
for 
other 
Sciences, 
since 
they 
borrow 
their 
Principles 
from 
Philosophy, 
I 
judg’d 
that 
nothing 
which 
was 
solid 
could 
be 
built 
upon 
such 
unsound 
foundations; 
and 
neither 
honour 
nor 
wealth 
were 
sufficient 
to 
invite 
me 
to 
the 
study 
of 
them. 
For 
(I 
thank 
God) 
I 
found 
not 
my 
self 
in 
a 
condition 
which 
obliged 
me 
to 
make 
a 
Trade 
of 
Letters 
for 
the 
relief 
of 
my 
fortune. 
And 
although 
I 
made 
it 
not 
my 
profession 
to 
despise 
glory 
with 
the 
Cynick; 
yet 
did 
I 
little 
value 
that 
which 
I 
could 
not 
acquire 
but 
by 
false 
pretences. 
And 
lastly, 
for 
unwarrantable 
Studies, 
I 
thought 
I 
already 
too 
well 
understood 
what 
they 
were, 
to 
be 
any 
more 
subject 
to 
be 
deceived, 
either 
by 
the 
promises 
of 
an 
Alchymist, 
or 
by 
the 
predictions 
of 
an 
Astrologer, 
or 
by 
the 
impostures 
of 
a 
Magician, 
or 
by 
the 
artifice 
or 
brags 
of 
those 
who 
profess 
to 
know 
more 
then 
they 
do. 
By 
reason 
whereof, 
as 
soon 
as 
my 
years 
freed 
me 
from 
the 
subjection 



of 
[15]my 
Tutors, 
I 
wholly 
gave 
over 
the 
study 
of 
Letters, 
and 
resolving 
to 
seek 
no 
other 
knowledge 
but 
what 
I 
could 
finde 
in 
my 
self, 
or 
in 
the 
great 
book 
of 
the 
World, 
I 
imployed 
the 
rest 
of 
my 
youth 
in 
Travell, 
to 
see 
Courts 
and 
Armies, 
to 
frequent 
people 
of 
severall 
humors 
and 
conditions, 
to 
gain 
experience, 
to 
hazard 
my 
self 
in 
those 
encounters 
of 
fortune 
which 
should 
occurr; 
and 
every-where 
to 
make 
such 
a 
reflection 
on 
those 
things 
which 
presented 
themselves 
to 
me, 
that 
I 
might 
draw 
profit 
from 
them. 
For 
(me 
thought) 
I 
could 
meet 
with 
far 
more 
truth 
in 
the 
discourses 
which 
every 
man 
makes 
touching 
those 
affairs 
which 
concern 
him, 
whose 
event 
would 
quickly 
condemn 
him, 
if 
he 
had 
judg’d 
amisse; 
then 
amongst 
those 
which 
letter’d 
Men 
make 
in 
their 
closets 
touching 
speculations, 
which 
produce 
no 
effect, 
and 
are 
of 
no 
consequence 
to 
them, 
but 
that 
perhaps 
they 
may 
gain 
so 
much 
the 
more 
vanity, 
as 
they 
are 
farther 
different 
from 
[16]the 
common 
understanding: 
Forasmuch 
as 
he 
must 
have 
imployed 
the 
more 
wit 
and 
subtilty 
in 
endeavouring 
to 
render 
them 
probable. 
And 
I 
had 
always 
an 
extreme 
desire 
to 
learn 
to 
distinguish 
Truth 
from 
Falshood, 
that 
I 
might 
see 
cleerly 
into 
my 
actions, 
and 
passe 
this 
life 
with 
assurance. 


Its 
true, 
that 
whiles 
I 
did 
but 
consider 
the 
Manners 
of 
other 
men, 
I 
found 
little 
or 
nothing 
wherein 
I 
might 
confirm 
my 
self: 
And 
I 
observ’d 
in 
them 
even 
as 
much 
diversity 
as 
I 
had 
found 
before 
in 
the 
opinions 
of 
the 
Philosophers: 
So 
that 
the 
greatest 
profit 
I 
could 
reap 
from 
them 
was, 
that 
seeing 
divers 
things, 
which 
although 
they 
seem 
to 
us 
very 
extravagant 
and 
ridiculous, 
are 
nevertheless 
commonly 
received 
and 
approved 
by 
other 
great 
Nations, 
I 
learn’d 
to 
beleeve 
nothing 
too 
firmly, 
of 
what 
had 
been 
onely 
perswaded 
me 
by 
example 
or 
by 
custom, 
and 
so 
by 
little 
and 
little 
I 
freed 
my 
self 
from 
many 
errors, 
which 
might 
eclipse 
our 
[17]naturall 
light, 
and 
render 
us 
lesse 
able 
to 
comprehend 
reason. 
But 
after 
I 
had 
imployed 
some 
years 
in 
thus 
studying 
the 
Book 
of 
the 
World, 
and 
endeavouring 
to 
get 
experience, 
I 
took 
one 
day 
a 
resolution 
to 
study 
also 
within 
my 
self, 
and 
to 
employ 
all 
the 
forces 
of 
my 
minde 
in 
the 
choice 
of 
the 
way 
I 
was 
to 
follow: 
which 
(me 
thought) 
succeeded 
much 
better, 
then 
if 
I 
had 
never 
estranged 
my 
self 
from 
my 
Country, 
or 
from 
my 
Books. 


PART. 
II. 



I 
was 
then 
in 
Germany, 
whither 
the 
occasion 
of 
the 
Wars 
(which 
are 
not 
yet 
finished) 
call’d 
me; 
and 
as 
I 
return’d 
from 
the 
Emperors 
Coronation 
towards 
the 
Army, 
the 
beginning 
of 
Winter 
stopt 
me 
in 
a 
place, 
where 
finding 
no 
conversation 
to 
divert 
me 
[18]and 
on 
the 
other 
sides 
having 
by 
good 
fortune 
no 
cares 
nor 
passions 
which 
troubled 
me, 
I 
stayd 
alone 
the 
whole 
day, 
shut 
up 
in 
my 
Stove, 
where 
I 
had 
leasure 
enough 
to 
entertain 
my 
self 
with 
my 
thoughts. 
Among 
which 
one 
of 
the 
first 
was 
that 
I 
betook 
my 
self 
to 
consider, 
That 
oft 
times 
there 
is 
not 
so 
much 
perfection 
in 
works 
compos’d 
of 
divers 
peeces, 
and 
made 
by 
the 
hands 
of 
severall 
masters, 
as 
in 
those 
that 
were 
wrought 
by 
one 
only: 
So 
we 
may 
observe 
that 
those 
buildings 
which 
were 
undertaken 
and 
finished 
by 
one 
onely, 
are 
commonly 
fairer 
and 
better 
ordered 
then 
those 
which 
divers 
have 
laboured 
to 
patch 
up, 
making 
use 
of 
old 
wals, 
which 
were 
built 
for 
other 
purposes; 
So 
those 
ancient 
Cities 
which 
of 
boroughs, 
became 
in 
a 
succession 
of 
time 
great 
Towns, 
are 
commonly 
so 
ill 
girt 
in 
comparison 
of 
other 
regular 
Places, 
which 
were 
design’d 
on 
a 
flatt 
according 
to 
the 
fancy 
of 
an 
Engeneer; 
and 
although 
considering 
their 
buildings 
[19]severally, 
we 
often 
find 
as 
much 
or 
more 
art, 
then 
in 
those 
of 
other 
places; 
Yet 
to 
see 
how 
they 
are 
rank’d 
here 
a 
great 
one, 
there 
a 
little 
one, 
and 
how 
they 
make 
the 
streets 
crooked 
and 
uneven, 
One 
would 
say, 
That 
it 
was 
rather 
Fortune, 
then 
the 
will 
of 
Men 
indued 
with 
reason, 
that 
had 
so 
disposed 
them. 
And 
if 
we 
consider, 
that 
there 
hath 
always 
been 
certain 
Officers, 
whose 
charge 
it 
was, 
to 
take 
care 
of 
private 
buildings, 
to 
make 
them 
serve 
for 
the 
publique 
ornament; 
We 
may 
well 
perceive, 
that 
it’s 
very 
difficult, 
working 
on 
the 
works 
of 
others, 
to 
make 
things 
compleat. 
So 
also 
did 
I 
imagine, 
that 
those 
people 
who 
formerly 
had 
been 
half 
wilde, 
and 
civiliz’d 
but 
by 
degrees, 
made 
their 
laws 
but 
according 
to 
the 
incommodities 
which 
their 
crimes 
and 
their 
quarrels 
constrain’d 
them 
to, 
could 
not 
be 
so 
wel 
pollic’d, 
as 
those 
who 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
their 
association, 
observ’d 
the 
constitutions 
of 
some 
prudent 
Legislator. 
[20]As 
it 
is 
very 
certain, 
that 
the 
state 
of 
the 
true 
Religion, 
whose 
Ordinances 
God 
alone 
hath 
made, 
must 
be 
incomparably 
better 
regulated 
then 
all 
others. 
And 
to 
speak 
of 
humane 
things, 
I 
beleeve 
that 
if 
Sparta 
hath 
formerly 
been 
most 
flourishing, 
it 
was 
not 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
goodness 
of 
every 
of 
their 
laws 
in 
particular, 
many 
of 
them 
being 
very 
strange, 
and 
even 
contrary 
to 
good 
manners, 
but 
because 
they 
were 
invented 
by 
one 
only, 
They 
all 
tended 
to 
One 
End. 
And 
so 
I 
thought 
the 
sciences 
in 
Books, 
at 
least 
those 
whose 
reasons 
are 
but 
probable, 
and 
which 
have 
no 
demonstrations, 
having 
been 
compos’d 
of, 
and 
by 
little 
and 
little 



enlarg’d 
with, 
the 
opinions 
of 
divers 
persons, 
come 
not 
so 
near 
the 
Truth, 
as 
those 
simple 
reasonings 
which 
an 
understanding 
Man 
can 
naturally 
make, 
touching 
those 
things 
which 
occurr. 
And 
I 
thought 
besides 
also, 
That 
since 
we 
have 
all 
been 
children, 
before 
we 
were 
Men; 
and 
that 
we 
[21]must 
have 
been 
a 
long 
time 
govern’d 
by 
our 
appetites, 
and 
by 
our 
Tutors, 
who 
were 
often 
contrary 
to 
one 
another, 
and 
neither 
of 
which 
alwayes 
counsel’d 
us 
for 
the 
best; 
It’s 
almost 
impossible 
that 
our 
judgment 
could 
be 
so 
clear 
or 
so 
solid, 
as 
it 
might 
have 
been, 
had 
we 
had 
the 
intire 
use 
of 
our 
reason 
from 
the 
time 
of 
our 
birth, 
and 
been 
always 
guided 
by 
it 
alone. 


Its 
true, 
we 
doe 
not 
see 
the 
houses 
of 
a 
whole 
Town 
pull’d 
down 
purposely 
to 
re 
build 
them 
of 
another 
fashion; 
and 
to 
make 
the 
streets 
the 
fairer; 
But 
we 
often 
see, 
that 
divers 
pull 
their 
own 
down 
to 
set 
them 
up 
again, 
and 
that 
even 
sometimes 
they 
are 
forc’d 
thereunto, 
when 
they 
are 
in 
danger 
to 
fall 
of 
themselves, 
and 
that 
their 
foundations 
are 
not 
sure. 
By 
which 
example 
I 
perswaded 
my 
self, 
that 
there 
was 
no 
sense 
for 
a 
particular 
person, 
to 
design 
the 
Reformation 
of 
a 
State, 
changing 
all 
from 
the 
very 
foundations, 
and 
subverting 
[22]all 
to 
redress 
it 
again: 
Nor 
even 
also 
to 
reform 
the 
bodies 
of 
Sciences, 
or 
the 
Orders 
already 
established 
in 
the 
Schools 
for 
teaching 
them. 
But 
as 
for 
all 
the 
Opinions 
which 
I 
had 
till 
then 
receiv’d 
into 
my 
beleef, 
I 
could 
not 
doe 
better 
then 
to 
undertake 
to 
expunge 
them 
once 
for 
all, 
that 
afterwards 
I 
might 
place 
in 
their 
stead, 
either 
others 
which 
were 
better, 
or 
the 
same 
again, 
as 
soon 
as 
I 
should 
have 
adjusted 
them 
to 
the 
rule 
of 
reason. 
And 
I 
did 
confidently 
beleeve, 
that 
by 
that 
means 
I 
should 
succeed 
much 
better 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
my 
life, 
then 
if 
I 
built 
but 
on 
old 
foundations, 
and 
only 
relyed 
on 
those 
principles, 
which 
I 
suffer’d 
my 
self 
to 
be 
perswaded 
to 
in 
my 
youth, 
without 
ever 
examining 
the 
Truth 
of 
them. 
For 
although 
I 
observ’d 
herein 
divers 
difficulties, 
yet 
were 
they 
not 
without 
cure, 
nor 
comparable 
to 
those 
which 
occurr 
in 
the 
reformation 
of 
the 
least 
things 
belonging 
to 
the 
publick: 
these 
great 
bodies 
are 
too 
unweldy 
to 
be 
rais’d; 
being 
[23]cast 
down, 
or 
to 
be 
held 
up 
when 
they 
are 
shaken, 
neither 
can 
their 
falls 
be 
but 
the 
heavyest. 


As 
for 
their 
imperfections, 
if 
they 
have 
any, 
as 
the 
only 
diversity 
which 
is 
amongst 
them, 
is 
sufficient 
to 
assure 
us 
that 
many 
have. 
Custome 
hath 
(without 
doubt) 
much 
sweetned 
them, 
and 
even 
it 
hath 
made 
others 
wave, 
or 
insensibly 
correct 
a 
many, 
whereto 
we 
could 
not 
so 
well 
by 
prudence 
have 
given 
a 
remedy. 
And 
in 
fine, 
They 
are 
alwayes 
more 
supportable, 
then 
their 
change 
can 
be, 
Even, 
as 
the 
great 
Roads, 
which 
winding 
by 
little 
and 
little 



betwixt 
mountains, 
become 
so 
plain 
and 
commodious, 
with 
being 
often 
frequented, 
that 
it’s 
much 
better 
to 
follow 
them, 
then 
to 
undertake 
to 
goe 
in 
a 
strait 
line 
by 
climbing 
over 
the 
rocks, 
and 
descending 
to 
the 
bottom 
of 
precipices. 
Wherefore 
I 
can 
by 
no 
means 
approve 
of 
those 
turbulent 
and 
unquiet 
humors, 
who 
being 
neither 
call’d 
by 
birth 
or 
fortune 
to 
the 
[24]managing 
of 
publique 
affairs, 
yet 
are 
alwayes 
forming 
in 
Idea, 
some 
new 
Reformation. 
And 
did 
I 
think 
there 
were 
the 
least 
thing 
in 
this 
Discourse, 
which 
might 
render 
me 
suspected 
of 
that 
folly, 
I 
should 
be 
extremely 
sorry 
to 
suffer 
it 
to 
be 
published; 
I 
never 
had 
any 
designe 
which 
intended 
farther 
then 
to 
reform 
my 
own 
thoughts 
and 
to 
build 
on 
a 
foundation 
which 
was 
wholly 
mine. 
But 
though 
I 
present 
you 
here 
with 
a 
Modell 
of 
my 
work, 
because 
it 
hath 
sufficiently 
pleased 
me; 
I 
would 
not 
therefore 
counsell 
any 
one 
to 
imitate 
it. 
Those 
whom 
God 
hath 
better 
endued 
with 
his 
graces, 
may 
perhaps 
have 
more 
elevated 
designes; 
but 
I 
fear 
me, 
lest 
already 
this 
be 
too 
bold 
for 
some. 
The 
resolution 
only 
of 
quitting 
all 
those 
opinions 
which 
we 
have 
formerly 
receiv’d 
into 
our 
belief, 
is 
not 
an 
example 
to 
be 
followed 
by 
every 
One; 
and 
the 
world 
is 
almost 
compos’d 
but 
of 
two 
sorts 
of 
Men, 
to 
whom 
it’s 
no 
wayes 
convenient, 
to 
[25]wit, 
of 
those, 
who 
beleeving 
themselves 
more 
able 
then 
they 
are, 
cannot 
with-hold 
themselves 
from 
precipitating 
their 
judgments, 
nor 
have 
patience 
enough 
to 
steer 
all 
their 
thoughts 
in 
an 
orderly 
course. 
Whence 
it 
happens, 
that 
if 
they 
should 
once 
take 
the 
liberty 
to 
doubt 
of 
those 
principles 
which 
they 
have 
already 
received, 
and 
to 
stray 
from 
the 
common 
road, 
they 
could 
never 
keep 
the 
path 
which 
leads 
strait 
forwards, 
and 
so, 
would 
straggle 
all 
their 
lives. 
And 
of 
such 
who 
having 
reason 
and 
modesty 
enough 
to 
judg 
that 
they 
are 
less 
able 
to 
distinguish 
truth 
from 
falshood 
then 
others, 
from 
whom 
they 
may 
receive 
instruction, 
ought 
much 
rather 
to 
be 
content 
to 
follow 
other 
Mens 
opinions, 
rather 
then 
to 
seek 
after 
better 
themselves. 


And 
for 
my 
part, 
I 
had 
undoubtedly 
been 
of 
the 
number 
of 
those 
latter, 
had 
I 
never 
had 
but 
one 
Master, 
or 
had 
I 
not 
known 
the 
disputes 
which 
[26]have 
alwayes 
hapned 
amongst 
the 
most 
learned. 
For 
having 
learnt 
from 
the 
very 
School, 
That 
one 
can 
imagin 
nothing 
so 
strange 
or 
incredible, 
which 
had 
not 
been 
said 
by 
some 
one 
of 
the 
Philosophers; 
And 
having 
since 
observ’d 
in 
my 
travails, 
That 
all 
those 
whose 
opinions 
are 
contrary 
to 
ours, 
are 
not 
therefore 
barbarous 
or 
savage, 
but 
that 
many 
use 
as 
much 
or 
more 
reason 
then 
we; 
and 
having 
consider’d 
how 
much 
one 
Man 
with 
his 
own 
understanding, 
bred 
up 
from 
his 
childhood 
among 
the 
French 
or 
the 
Dutch, 
becomes 
different 
from 



what 
he 
would 
be, 
had 
he 
alwayes 
liv’d 
amongst 
the 
Chineses, 
or 
the 
Cannibals: 
And 
how 
even 
in 
the 
fashion 
of 
our 
Clothes, 
the 
same 
thing 
which 
pleas’d 
ten 
years 
since, 
and 
which 
perhaps 
wil 
please 
ten 
years 
hence, 
seems 
now 
to 
us 
ridiculous 
and 
extravagant. 
So 
that 
it’s 
much 
more 
Custome 
and 
Example 
which 
perswades 
us, 
then 
any 
assured 
knowledg; 
and 
notwithstanding 
that 
plurality 
of 
voices 
is 
a 
[27]proof 
of 
no 
validity, 
in 
those 
truths 
which 
are 
hard 
to 
be 
discovered; 
for 
that 
it’s 
much 
more 
likely 
for 
one 
man 
alone 
to 
have 
met 
with 
them, 
then 
a 
whole 
Nation; 
I 
could 
choose 
no 
Man 
whose 
opinion 
was 
to 
be 
preferr’d 
before 
anothers: 
And 
I 
found 
my 
self 
even 
constrain’d 
to 
undertake 
the 
conduct 
of 
my 
self. 


But 
as 
a 
man 
that 
walks 
alone, 
and 
in 
the 
dark, 
I 
resolv’d 
to 
goe 
so 
softly, 
and 
use 
so 
much 
circumspection 
in 
all 
things, 
that 
though 
I 
advanc’d 
little, 
I 
would 
yet 
save 
my 
self 
from 
falling. 
Neither 
would 
I 
begin 
quite 
to 
reject, 
some 
opinions, 
which 
formerly 
had 
crept 
into 
my 
belief, 
without 
the 
consent 
of 
my 
reason, 
before 
I 
had 
employed 
time 
enough 
to 
form 
the 
project 
of 
the 
work 
I 
undertook, 
and 
to 
seek 
the 
true 
Method 
to 
bring 
me 
to 
the 
knowledg 
of 
all 
those 
things, 
of 
which 
my 
understanding 
was 
capable. 


I 
had 
a 
little 
studyed, 
being 
young, 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
Philosophy, 
Logick, 
[28]and 
of 
the 
Mathematicks, 
the 
Analysis 
of 
the 
Geometricians, 
and 
Algebra: 
Three 
arts 
or 
sciences 
which 
seem’d 
to 
contribute 
somewhat 
conducing 
to 
my 
designe: 
But 
examining 
them, 
I 
observ’d, 
That 
as 
for 
Logick, 
its 
Sylogisms, 
and 
the 
greatest 
part 
of 
its 
other 
Rules, 
serve 
rather 
to 
expound 
to 
another 
the 
things 
they 
know, 
or 
even 
asLullies 
art, 
to 
speak 
with 
judgment 
of 
the 
things 
we 
are 
ignorant 
of, 
then 
to 
learn 
them. 
And 
although 
in 
effect 
it 
contain 
divers 
most 
true 
and 
good 
precepts, 
yet 
there 
are 
so 
many 
others 
mixed 
amongst 
them, 
either 
hurtfull 
or 
superfluous, 
That 
it’s 
even 
as 
difficult 
to 
extract 
them, 
as 
’tis 
to 
draw 
a 
Diana 
or 
a 
Mercury 
out 
of 
a 
lump 
of 
Marble, 
which 
is 
not 
yet 
rough-hewn; 
as 
for 
the 
Analysis 
of 
the 
Ancients, 
and 
the 
Algebra 
of 
the 
Moderns; 
besides 
that, 
they 
extend 
only 
to 
matters 
very 
abstract, 
and 
which 
seem 
to 
be 
of 
no 
use; 
The 
first 
being 
alwayes 
so 
tyed 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
figures, 
That 
it 
cannot 
exercise 
[29]the 
understanding, 
without 
very 
much 
tiring 
the 
imagination. 
And 
in 
the 
latter 
they 
have 
so 
subjected 
themselves 
to 
certain 
Rules 
and 
cyphers, 
that 
they 
have 
made 
a 
confus’d 
and 
obscure 
art 
which 
perplexeth 
the 
minde, 
in 
stead 
of 
a 
Science 
to 
instruct 
it. 
For 
this 
reason, 
I 
thought 
I 
ought 
to 
seek 
some 
other 
Method, 
which 
comprehending 
the 
advantages 
of 
these, 
they 
might 
be 



exempt 
from 
their 
defects. 
And 
as 
the 
multitude 
of 
Laws 
often 
furnisheth 
excuses 
for 
vice; 
so 
a 
State 
is 
fair 
better 
polic’d, 
when 
having 
but 
a 
few, 
they 
are 
very 
strictly 
observ’d 
therein: 
So, 
instead 
of 
the 
great 
many 
precepts 
whereof 
Logick 
is 
compos’d, 
I 
thought 
these 
four 
following 
would 
be 
sufficient 
for 
me, 
if 
I 
took 
but 
a 
firm 
and 
constant 
resolution 
not 
once 
to 
fail 
in 
the 
observation 
of 
them. 


The 
first 
was, 
never 
to 
receive 
any 
thing 
for 
true, 
but 
what 
I 
evidently 
knew 
to 
be 
so; 
that’s 
to 
say, 
Carefully 
to 
avoid 
Precipitation 
and 
Prevention, 
[30]and 
to 
admit 
nothing 
more 
into 
my 
judgment, 
but 
what 
should 
so 
clearly 
and 
distinctly 
present 
it 
self 
to 
my 
minde, 
that 
I 
could 
have 
no 
reason 
to 
doubt 
of 
it. 


The 
second, 
to 
divide 
every 
One 
of 
these 
difficulties, 
which 
I 
was 
to 
examine 
into 
as 
many 
parcels 
as 
could 
be, 
and, 
as 
was 
requisite 
the 
better 
to 
resolve 
them. 


The 
third, 
to 
lead 
my 
thoughts 
in 
order, 
beginning 
by 
the 
most 
simple 
objects, 
and 
the 
easiest 
to 
be 
known; 
to 
rise 
by 
little 
and 
little, 
as 
by 
steps, 
even 
to 
the 
knowledg 
of 
the 
most 
mixt; 
and 
even 
supposing 
an 
Order 
among 
those 
which 
naturally 
doe 
not 
precede 
one 
the 
other. 


And 
the 
last, 
to 
make 
every 
where 
such 
exact 
calculations, 
and 
such 
generall 
reviews, 
That 
I 
might 
be 
confident 
to 
have 
omitted 
Nothing. 


Those 
long 
chains 
of 
reasons, 
(though 
simple 
and 
easie) 
which 
the 
Geometricians 
commonly 
use 
to 
lead 
us 
to 
their 
most 
difficult 
demonstrations, 
[31]gave 
me 
occasion 
to 
imagine, 
That 
all 
things 
which 
may 
fall 
under 
the 
knowledg 
of 
Men, 
follow 
one 
the 
other 
in 
the 
same 
manner, 
and 
so 
we 
doe 
only 
abstain 
from 
receiving 
any 
one 
for 
true, 
which 
is 
not 
so, 
and 
observe 
alwayes 
the 
right 
order 
of 
deducing 
them 
one 
from 
the 
other, 
there 
can 
be 
none 
so 
remote, 
to 
which 
at 
last 
we 
shall 
not 
attain; 
nor 
so 
hid, 
which 
we 
shall 
not 
discover. 
Neither 
was 
I 
much 
troubled 
to 
seek 
by 
which 
it 
behooved 
me 
to 
begin, 
for 
I 
already 
knew, 
that 
it 
was 
by 
the 
most 
simple, 
and 
the 
easiest 
to 
be 
discern’d. 
But 
considering, 
that 
amongst 
all 
those 
who 
formerly 
have 
sought 
the 
Truth 
in 
Learning, 
none 
but 
the 
Mathematicians 
only 
could 
finde 
any 
demonstrations, 
that’s 
to 
say, 
any 
certain 
and 
evident 
reasons. 
I 
doubted 
not, 
but 
that 
it 
was 
by 
the 
same 
that 
they 
have 
examin’d; 
although 
I 
did 
hope 
for 
no 
other 
profit, 
but 
only 
that 
they 
would 
accustome 



my 
Minde 
to 
nourish 
it 
self 
with 
[32]Truths, 
and 
not 
content 
it 
self 
with 
false 
Reasons. 
But 
for 
all 
this, 
I 
never 
intended 
to 
endevour 
to 
learn 
all 
those 
particular 
Sciences 
which 
we 
commonly 
call’d 
Mathematicall; 
And 
perceiving, 
that 
although 
their 
objects 
were 
different, 
yet 
did 
they 
nevertheless 
agree 
altogether, 
in 
that 
they 
consider 
no 
other 
thing, 
but 
the 
divers 
relations 
or 
proportions 
which 
are 
found 
therein; 
I 
thought 
it 
therefore 
better 
to 
examine 
those 
proportions 
in 
generall, 
and 
without 
supporting 
them 
but 
in 
those 
subjects, 
which 
might 
the 
more 
easily 
serve 
to 
bring 
me 
to 
the 
knowledg 
of 
them. 
But 
withall, 
without 
any 
wayes 
limiting 
them, 
That 
I 
might 
afterwards 
the 
better 
sit 
them 
to 
all 
others 
whereto 
they 
might 
be 
applyed. 
Having 
also 
observ’d, 
That 
to 
know 
them, 
it 
would 
be 
sometimes 
needfull 
for 
me 
to 
consider 
every 
one 
in 
particular, 
or 
sometimes 
only 
to 
restrain 
them, 
or 
comprehend 
many 
together; 
I 
thought, 
that 
to 
consider 
them 
the 
[33]better 
in 
particular 
I 
ought 
to 
suppose 
them 
in 
lines, 
for 
as 
much 
as 
I 
find 
nothing 
more 
simple, 
nor 
which 
I 
could 
more 
distinctly 
represent 
to 
my 
imagination, 
and 
to 
my 
sences; 
But 
to 
hold 
or 
comprehend 
many 
in 
one, 
I 
was 
oblig’d 
to 
explain 
them 
by 
certain 
Cyphers 
the 
shortest 
I 
possibly 
could, 
and 
that 
I 
should 
thereby 
borrow 
the 
best 
of 
the 
Geometricall 
Analysis, 
and 
of 
Algebra, 
& 
so 
correct 
all 
the 
defects 
of 
the 
one 
by 
the 
other. 


As 
in 
effect 
I 
dare 
say, 
That 
the 
exact 
observation 
of 
those 
few 
precepts 
I 
had 
chosen, 
gave 
me 
such 
a 
facility 
to 
resolve 
all 
the 
questions 
whereto 
these 
two 
sciences 
extend; 
That 
in 
two 
or 
three 
months 
space 
which 
I 
employed 
in 
the 
examination 
of 
them, 
having 
begun 
by 
the 
most 
simple 
and 
most 
generall, 
and 
every 
Truth 
which 
I 
found 
being 
a 
rule 
which 
afterwards 
served 
me 
to 
discover 
others; 
I 
did 
not 
only 
compasse 
divers 
truths 
which 
I 
had 
formerly 
judged 
most 
difficult, 
But 
me 
thought 
also 
that 
towards 
the 
end 
I 
could 
determin[34]even 
in 
those 
which 
I 
was 
ignorant 
of, 
by 
what 
means 
and 
how 
farr 
it 
was 
possible 
to 
resolve 
them. 
Wherein 
perhaps 
I 
shall 
not 
appear 
to 
be 
very 
vain 
if 
you 
consider, 
That 
there 
being 
but 
one 
truth 
of 
every 
thing, 
who 
ever 
finds 
it, 
knows 
as 
much 
of 
it 
as 
one 
can 
know; 
And 
that 
for 
example 
a 
child 
instructed 
in 
Arithmatick 
having 
made 
an 
addition 
according 
to 
his 
rules, 
may 
be 
sure 
to 
have 
found, 
touching 
the 
sum 
he 
examined, 
all 
what 
the 
wit 
of 
man 
could 
finde 
out. 
In 
a 
word 
the 
method 
which 
teacheth 
to 
folow 
a 
right 
order, 
and 
exactly 
to 
enumerate 
all 
the 
circumstances 
of 
what 
we 
seek, 
contains, 
whatsoever 
ascertains 
the 
rules 
of 
Arithmatick. 


But 
that 
which 
pleas’d 
me 
most 
in 
this 
Method 
was 
the 
assurance 
I 
had, 



wholly 
to 
use 
my 
reason, 
if 
not 
perfectly, 
at 
least 
as 
much 
as 
it 
was 
in 
my 
power; 
Besides 
this, 
I 
perceived 
in 
the 
practice 
of 
it, 
my 
minde 
by 
little 
and 
little 
accustom’d 
it 
self 
to 
conceive 
its 
objects 
more 
clearly 
and 
distinctly; 
and 
having 
not 
subjected 
it 
[35]to 
any 
particular 
matter, 
I 
promised 
my 
self 
to 
apply 
it 
also 
as 
profitable 
to 
the 
difficulties, 
of 
other 
sciences 
as 
I 
had 
to 
Algebra: 
Not 
that 
I 
therefore 
durst 
at 
first 
undertake 
to 
examine 
all 
which 
might 
present 
themselves, 
for 
that 
were 
contrary 
to 
the 
order 
it 
prescribes. 
But 
having 
observ’d 
that 
all 
their 
principles 
were 
to 
be 
borrowed 
from 
Philosophy, 
in 
which 
I 
had 
yet 
found 
none 
that 
were 
certain, 
I 
thought 
it 
were 
needfull 
for 
me 
in 
the 
first 
place 
to 
endevor 
to 
establish 
some, 
and 
that 
this 
being 
the 
most 
important 
thing 
in 
the 
world, 
wherein 
precipitation 
and 
prevention 
were 
the 
most 
to 
be 
feared, 
I 
should 
not 
undertake 
to 
performe 
it, 
till 
I 
had 
attain’d 
to 
a 
riper 
Age 
then 
XXIII. 
which 
was 
then 
mine. 
Before 
I 
had 
formerly 
employed 
a 
long 
time 
in 
preparing 
my 
self 
thereunto, 
aswel 
in 
rooting 
out 
of 
my 
minde 
all 
the 
ill 
opinions 
I 
had 
before 
that 
time 
received, 
as 
in 
getting 
a 
stock 
of 
experience 
to 
serve 
afterwards 
for 
the 
subject 
of 
my 
reasonings, 
and 
in 
exercising 
my 
self 
[36]always 
in 
the 
Method 
I 
had 
prescribed. 
That 
I 
might 
the 
more 
and 
more 
confine 
my 
self 
therein. 


PART. 
III. 


but 
as 
it 
is 
not 
enough 
to 
pull 
down 
the 
house 
where 
we 
dwell, 
before 
we 
begin 
to 
re-edify 
it, 
and 
to 
make 
provision 
of 
materials 
and 
architects, 
or 
performe 
that 
office 
our 
selves; 
nor 
yet 
to 
have 
carefully 
laid 
the 
design 
of 
it; 
but 
we 
must 
also 
have 
provided 
our 
selves 
of 
some 
other 
place 
of 
abode 
during 
the 
time 
of 
the 
rebuilding: 
so 
that 
I 
might 
not 
remain 
irresolute 
in 
my 
actions, 
while 
reason 
would 
oblige 
me 
to 
be 
so 
in 
my 
judgments, 
and 
that 
I 
might 
continue 
to 
live 
the 
most 
happily 
I 
could, 
I 
form’d 
for 
my 
own 
use 
in 
the 
interim 
a 
moral, 
which 
consisted 
but 
of 
three 
or 
four 
maximes, 
which 
I 
shall 
communicate 
unto 
you. 


[37]The 
first 
was 
to 
obey 
the 
lawes 
and 
customes 
of 
my 
Country, 
constantly 
adhæring 
to 
that 
Religion 
wherein 
by 
the 
grace 
of 
God 
I 
had 
from 
mine 
infancy 
bin 
bred. 
And 
in 
all 
other 
things 
behaving 
my 
self 
according 
to 
the 
most 
moderate 
opinions 
and 
those 
which 
were 
farthest 
from 
excesse, 
which 
were 
commonly 
received 
in 
practice 
by 
the 
most 
judicious 
Men, 

amongst 
whom 
I 
was 
to 
live: 
For 
beginning 
from 
that 
very 
time, 
to 
reckon 
mine 
own 
for 
nothing, 
because 
I 
could 
bring 
them 
all 
to 
the 
test, 
I 
was 
confident 
I 
could 
not 
do 
better 
then 
follow 
those 
of 
the 
deepest 
sense; 
and 
although 
perhaps 
there 
are 
as 
understanding 
men 
amongst 
the 
Persians 
or 
Chineses 
as 
amongst 
us, 
yet 
I 
thought 
it 
was 
more 
fit 
to 
regulate 
my 
self 
by 
those 
with 
whom 
I 
was 
to 
live, 
and 
that 
I 
might 
truly 
know 
what 
their 
opinions 
were, 
I 
was 
rather 
to 
observe 
what 
they 
practic’d, 
then 
what 
they 
taught. 
Not 
only 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
corruption 
of 
our 
manners, 
there 
are 
but 
few 
[38]who 
will 
say, 
all 
they 
beleeve, 
but 
also 
because 
divers 
are 
themselves 
ignorant 
of 
it; 
for 
the 
act 
of 
the 
thought 
by 
which 
we 
beleeve 
a 
thing, 
being 
different 
from 
that 
whereby 
we 
know 
that 
we 
believe 
it, 
the 
one 
often 
is 
without 
the 
other. 
And 
amongst 
divers 
opinions 
equally 
receiv’d, 
I 
made 
choise 
of 
the 
most 
moderate 
only, 
as 
well 
because 
they 
are 
always 
the 
most 
fit 
for 
practice, 
and 
probably 
the 
best, 
all 
excess 
being 
commonly 
ill; 
As 
also 
that 
I 
might 
less 
err 
from 
the 
right 
way, 
if 
I 
should 
perhaps 
miss 
it, 
then 
if 
having 
chosen 
one 
of 
the 
extremes, 
it 
might 
prove 
to 
be 
the 
other, 
which 
I 
should 
have 
followed. 
And 
particularly 
I 
plac.rs 
d 
amongst 
extremities, 
all 
those 
promises 
by 
which 
we 
somwhat 
restrain 
our 
liberty. 
Not 
that 
I 
disapproved 
the 
laws, 
which 
to 
cure 
the 
inconstancy 
of 
weak 
minds, 
permit 
us 
when 
we 
have 
any 
good 
design, 
or 
else 
for 
the 
preservation 
of 
Commerce, 
one 
that 
is 
but 
indifferent, 
to 
make 
vows 
or 
contracts, 
which 
oblige 
[39]us 
to 
persevere 
in 
them: 
But 
because 
I 
saw 
nothing 
in 
the 
world 
remain 
always 
in 
the 
same 
state; 
and 
forming 
own 
particular, 
promised 
my 
self 
to 
perfect 
more 
and 
more 
my 
judgment, 
and 
not 
to 
impair 
it, 
I 
should 
have 
thought 
my 
self 
guilty 
of 
a 
great 
fault 
against 
right 
understanding, 
if 
because 
I 
then 
approved 
any 
thing, 
I 
were 
also 
afterwards 
oblig’d 
to 
take 
it 
for 
good, 
when 
perhaps 
it 
ceased 
to 
be 
so, 
or 
that 
I 
had 
ceased 
to 
esteem 
it 
so. 


My 
second 
Maxime 
was, 
To 
be 
the 
most 
constant 
and 
resolute 
in 
my 
actions 
that 
I 
could; 
and 
to 
follow 
with 
no 
less 
perseverance 
the 
most 
doubtfull 
opinions, 
when 
I 
had 
once 
determined 
them, 
then 
if 
they 
had 
been 
the 
most 
certain. 
Imitating 
herein 
Travellers, 
who 
having 
lost 
their 
way 
in 
a 
Forrest, 
ought 
not 
to 
wander, 
turning 
now 
this 
way, 
and 
then 
that, 
and 
less 
to 
abide 
in 
one 
place; 
but 
stil 
advance 
straight 
forwards, 
towards 
one 
way, 
and 
not 
to 
change 
on 
slight 
occasions, 
although 
perhaps 
at 
first 
Chance 
only 
[40]mov’d 
them 
to 
determine 
that 
choice: 
For 
by 
that 
means, 
if 
they 
do 
not 
go 
directly 
whither 
they 
desire, 
they 
will 
at 
least 
arrive 
somewhere 
where 
they 
will 
probably 
be 
better 
then 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
a 
Forrest. 
So 
the 
actions 
of 



this 
life 
admitting 
often 
of 
no 
delay, 
its 
a 
most 
certain 
Truth, 
That 
when 
it 
is 
not 
in 
our 
power 
to 
discern 
the 
truest 
opinions, 
we 
are 
to 
follow 
the 
most 
probable: 
Yea, 
although 
we 
finde 
no 
more 
probability 
in 
the 
one 
then 
in 
the 
other, 
we 
yet 
ought 
to 
determine 
some 
way, 
considering 
them 
afterwards 
no 
more 
as 
doubtful 
in 
what 
they 
relate 
to 
practice; 
but 
as 
most 
true 
and 
certain; 
forasmuch 
as 
the 
reason 
was 
so, 
which 
made 
us 
determine 
it. 
And 
this 
was 
sufficient 
for 
that 
time 
to 
free 
me 
from 
all 
the 
remorse 
and 
repentance 
which 
useth 
to 
perplex 
the 
consciences 
of 
those 
weak 
and 
staggering 
minds, 
which 
inconstantly 
suffer 
themselves 
to 
passe 
to 
the 
practice 
of 
those 
things 
as 
good, 
which 
they 
afterwards 
judge 
evill. 


[41]My 
third 
Maxime 
was, 
To 
endevour 
always 
rather 
to 
conquer 
my 
self 
then 
Fortune; 
and 
to 
change 
my 
desires, 
rather 
then 
the 
order 
of 
the 
world: 
and 
generally 
to 
accustome 
my 
self 
to 
beleeve, 
That 
there 
is 
nothing 
wholly 
in 
our 
power 
but 
our 
thoughts; 
so 
that 
after 
we 
have 
done 
our 
best, 
touching 
things 
which 
are 
without 
us, 
all 
whats 
wanting 
of 
success 
in 
respect 
of 
us 
is 
absolutely 
impossible. 
And 
this 
alone 
seem’d 
sufficient 
to 
hinder 
me 
from 
desiring 
any 
thing 
which 
I 
could 
not 
acquire, 
and 
so 
to 
render 
me 
content. 
For 
our 
will 
naturally 
moving 
us 
to 
desire 
nothing, 
but 
those 
things 
which 
our 
understanding 
presents 
in 
some 
manner 
as 
possible, 
certain 
it 
is, 
that 
if 
we 
consider 
all 
the 
good 
which 
is 
without 
us, 
as 
equally 
distant 
from 
our 
power, 
we 
should 
have 
no 
more 
regret 
for 
the 
want 
of 
those 
which 
seem 
due 
to 
our 
births, 
when 
without 
any 
fault 
of 
ours 
we 
shall 
be 
deprived 
of 
them, 
then 
we 
have 
in 
wanting 
the 
possessions 
of 
the 
Kingdoms 
of 
[42]China 
or 
Mexico. 
And 
making 
(as 
we 
say) 
vertue 
of 
necessity, 
we 
should 
no 
more 
desire 
to 
be 
in 
health 
being 
sick, 
or 
free 
being 
in 
prison, 
then 
we 
now 
do, 
to 
have 
bodies 
of 
as 
incorruptible 
a 
matter 
as 
diamonds, 
or 
wings 
to 
fly 
like 
birds. 
But 
I 
confess, 
that 
a 
long 
exercise, 
and 
an 
often 
reiterated 
meditation, 
is 
necessary 
to 
accustom 
us 
to 
look 
on 
all 
things 
with 
that 
byass: 
And 
I 
beleeve, 
in 
this 
principally 
consists, 
the 
secret 
of 
those 
Philosophers 
who 
formerly 
could 
snatch 
themselves 
from 
the 
Empire 
of 
Fortune, 
and 
in 
spight 
of 
pains 
and 
poverty, 
dispute 
felicity 
with 
their 
Gods, 
for 
imploying 
themselves 
incessantly 
in 
considering 
the 
bounds 
which 
Nature 
had 
prescribed 
them, 
they 
so 
perfectly 
perswaded 
themselves, 
That 
nothing 
was 
in 
their 
power 
but 
their 
thoughts, 
that, 
that 
onely 
was 
enough 
to 
hinder 
them 
from 
having 
any 
affection 
for 
other 
things. 
And 
they 
disposed 
so 
absolutely 
of 
them, 
that 
therein 
they 
had 
some 
reason 
to 
esteem 
themselves 
[43]more 
rich 
and 
powerfull, 
more 
free 
and 
happy 
then 
any 
other 
men; 
who 
wanting 

this 
Philosophy, 
though 
they 
were 
never 
so 
much 
favoured 
by 
Nature 
and 
Fortune, 
could 
never 
dispose 
of 
all 
things 
so 
well 
as 
they 
desired. 


Lastly, 
To 
conclude 
these 
Morals, 
I 
thought 
fit 
to 
make 
a 
review 
of 
mens 
severall 
imployments 
in 
this 
life, 
that 
I 
might 
endeavour 
to 
make 
choice 
of 
the 
best, 
and 
without 
prejudice 
to 
other 
mens, 
I 
thought 
I 
could 
not 
do 
better 
then 
to 
continue 
in 
the 
same 
wherein 
I 
was, 
that 
is, 
to 
imploy 
all 
my 
life 
in 
cultivating 
my 
Reason, 
and 
advancing 
my 
self, 
as 
far 
as 
I 
could 
in 
the 
knowledge 
of 
Truth, 
following 
the 
Method 
I 
had 
prescribed 
myself. 
I 
was 
sensible 
of 
such 
extreme 
contentment 
since 
I 
began 
to 
use 
this 
Method, 
that 
I 
thought 
none 
could 
in 
this 
life 
be 
capable 
of 
any 
more 
sweet 
and 
innocent: 
and 
daily 
discovering 
by 
means 
thereof, 
some 
Truths 
which 
seemed 
to 
me 
of 
importance, 
and 
commonly 
such 
as 
other 
[44]men 
were 
ignorant 
of, 
the 
satisfaction 
I 
thereby 
received 
did 
so 
possesse 
my 
minde, 
as 
if 
all 
things 
else 
concern’d 
me 
not. 
Besides, 
that 
the 
three 
preceding 
Maximes 
were 
grounded 
only 
on 
the 
designe 
I 
had, 
to 
continue 
the 
instruction 
of 
my 
self. 
For 
God 
having 
given 
to 
every 
one 
of 
us 
a 
light 
to 
discern 
truth 
from 
falsehood, 
I 
could 
not 
beleeve 
I 
ought 
to 
content 
my 
self 
one 
moment 
with 
the 
opinions 
of 
others, 
unlesse 
I 
had 
proposed 
to 
my 
self 
in 
due 
time 
to 
imploy 
my 
judgment 
in 
the 
examination 
of 
them. 
Neither 
could 
I 
have 
exempted 
my 
self 
from 
scruple 
in 
following 
them, 
had 
I 
not 
hoped 
to 
lose 
no 
occasion 
of 
finding 
out 
better, 
if 
there 
were 
any. 


But 
to 
conclude, 
I 
could 
not 
have 
bounded 
my 
desires, 
nor 
have 
been 
content, 
had 
I 
not 
followed 
a 
way, 
whereby 
thinking 
my 
self 
assured 
to 
acquire 
all 
the 
knowledge 
I 
could 
be 
capable 
of: 
I 
thought 
I 
might 
by 
the 
same 
means 
attain 
to 
all 
that 
was 
truly 
[45]good, 
which 
should 
ever 
be 
within 
my 
power; 
forasmuch 
as 
our 
Will 
inclining 
it 
self 
to 
follow, 
or 
fly 
nothing 
but 
what 
our 
Understanding 
proposeth 
good 
or 
ill, 
to 
judge 
well 
is 
sufficient 
to 
do 
well, 
and 
to 
judge 
the 
best 
we 
can, 
to 
do 
also 
what’s 
best; 
to 
wit, 
to 
acquire 
all 
vertues, 
and 
with 
them 
all 
acquirable 
goods: 
and 
whosoever 
is 
sure 
of 
that, 
he 
can 
never 
fail 
of 
being 
content. 


After 
I 
had 
thus 
confirmed 
my 
self 
with 
these 
Maximes, 
and 
laid 
them 
up 
with 
the 
Articles 
of 
Faith, 
which 
always 
had 
the 
first 
place 
in 
my 
Belief, 
I 
judg’d 
that 
I 
might 
freely 
undertake 
to 
expell 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
my 
opinions. 
And 
forasmuch 
as 
I 
did 
hope 
to 
bring 
it 
the 
better 
to 
passe 
by 
conversing 
with 
men, 
then 
by 
staying 
any 
longer 
in 
my 
stove, 
where 
I 
had 
had 
all 
these 
thoughts: 
before 
the 
Winter 
was 
fully 
ended, 
I 
returned 
to 
my 
travels; 
and 
in 



all 
the 
nine 
following 
yeers 
I 
did 
nothing 
but 
rowl 
here 
and 
there 
about 
the 
world, 
endeavouring 
[46]rather 
to 
be 
a 
spectator, 
then 
an 
actor 
in 
all 
those 
Comedies 
which 
were 
acted 
therein: 
and 
reflecting 
particularly 
on 
every 
subject 
which 
might 
render 
it 
suspected, 
or 
afford 
any 
occasion 
mistake. 
In 
the 
mean 
time 
I 
rooted 
out 
of 
my 
minde 
all 
those 
errours 
which 
formerly 
had 
crept 
in. 
Not 
that 
I 
therein 
imitated 
the 
Scepticks, 
who 
doubt 
onely 
to 
the 
end 
they 
may 
doubt, 
and 
affect 
to 
be 
always 
unresolved: 
For 
on 
the 
contrary, 
all 
my 
designe 
tended 
onely 
to 
fix 
my 
self, 
and 
to 
avoid 
quick-mires 
and 
sands, 
that 
I 
might 
finde 
rock 
and 
clay: 
which 
(me 
thought) 
succeeded 
well 
enough; 
forasmuch 
as, 
seeking 
to 
discover 
the 
falshood 
or 
uncertainty 
of 
those 
propositions 
I 
examined, 
(not 
by 
weak 
conjectures, 
but 
by 
clear 
and 
certain 
ratiocinations) 
I 
met 
with 
none 
so 
doubtfull, 
but 
I 
thence 
drew 
some 
conclusion 
certain 
enough, 
were 
it 
but 
onely 
this, 
That 
it 
contained 
nothing 
that 
was 
certain. 
And 
as 
in 
pulling 
down 
an 
old 
house, 
commonly 
[47]those 
materials 
are 
reserved 
which 
may 
serve 
to 
build 
a 
new 
one; 
so 
in 
destroying 
all 
those 
my 
opinions 
which 
I 
judg’d 
ill 
grounded, 
I 
made 
divers 
observations, 
and 
got 
severall 
experiences 
which 
served 
me 
since 
to 
establish 
more 
certain 
ones. 
And 
besides 
I 
continued 
to 
exercise 
my 
self 
in 
the 
Method 
I 
had 
prescribed. 


For 
I 
was 
not 
only 
carefull 
to 
direct 
all 
my 
thoughts 
in 
generall 
according 
to 
its 
rules, 
but 
I 
from 
time 
to 
time 
reserv’d 
some 
houres, 
which 
I 
particularly 
employd 
to 
practice 
it 
in 
difficulties 
belonging 
to 
the 
Mathematicks, 
loosening 
from 
all 
the 
principles 
of 
other 
Sciences, 
which 
I 
found 
not 
stable 
enough, 
as 
you 
may 
see 
I 
have 
done 
in 
divers 
explain’d 
in 
my 
other 
following 
discourses. 
And 
thus 
not 
living 
in 
appearance 
otherwise 
then 
those 
who 
having 
no 
other 
business 
then 
to 
lead 
a 
sweet 
and 
innocent 
life, 
study 
to 
separate 
pleasures 
from 
vices, 
and 
use 
honest 
recreations 
to 
enjoy 
their 
ease 
without 
wearinesse; 
I 
did 
not 
forbear 
[48]to 
pursue 
my 
design, 
and 
advance 
in 
the 
knowledg 
of 
truth, 
perhaps 
more, 
then 
if 
I 
had 
done 
nothing 
but 
read 
books 
or 
frequent 
learned 
men. 


Yet 
these 
nine 
years 
were 
vanished, 
before 
I 
had 
engaged 
my 
self 
in 
those 
difficulties 
which 
use 
to 
be 
disputed 
amongst 
the 
learned; 
or 
begun 
to 
seek 
the 
grounds 
of 
any 
more 
certain 
Philosophy 
then 
the 
Vulgar: 
And 
the 
example 
of 
divers 
excellent 
Men 
who 
formerly 
having 
had 
the 
same 
designe, 
seem’d 
not 
to 
me 
to 
have 
succeeded 
therein, 
made 
me 
imagine 
so 
much 
difficulty, 
that 
I 
had 
not 
perhaps 
dar’d 
so 
quickly 
to 
have 
undertaken 
it, 
had 
I 



not 
perceiv’d 
that 
some 
already 
had 
given 
it 
out 
that 
I 
had 
already 
accomplished 
it. 
I 
know 
not 
whereupon 
they 
grounded 
this 
opinion, 
and 
if 
I 
have 
contributed 
any 
thing 
thereto 
by 
my 
discourse, 
it 
must 
have 
been 
by 
confessing 
more 
ingeniously 
what 
I 
was 
ignorant 
of, 
then 
those 
are 
wont 
to 
do 
who 
have 
a 
little 
studyed, 
and 
perhaps 
also 
by 
comunicating 
those 
reasons, 
I[49]had 
to 
doubt 
of 
many 
things 
which 
others 
esteem’d 
most 
eminent, 
rather 
then 
that 
I 
bragg’d 
of 
any 
learning. 
But 
having 
integrity 
enough, 
not 
to 
desire 
to 
be 
taken 
for 
what 
I 
was 
not, 
I 
thought 
that 
I 
ought 
to 
endeavour 
by 
all 
means 
to 
render 
my 
self 
worthy 
of 
the 
reputation 
which 
was 
given 
me. 
And 
’tis 
now 
eight 
years 
since 
this 
desire 
made 
me 
resolve 
to 
estrange 
my 
self 
from 
all 
places 
where 
I 
might 
have 
any 
acquaintance, 
and 
so 
retire 
my 
self 
hither 
in 
a 
Country 
where 
the 
long 
continuance 
of 
the 
warre 
hath 
established 
such 
orders, 
that 
the 
Armies 
which 
are 
intertain’d 
there, 
seem 
to 
serve 
onely 
to 
make 
the 
inhabitants 
enjoy 
the 
fruits 
of 
peace 
with 
so 
much 
the 
more 
security; 
and 
where 
amongst 
the 
croud 
of 
a 
great 
people 
more 
active 
and 
solicitous 
for 
their 
own 
affaires, 
then 
curious 
of 
other 
mens, 
not 
wanting 
any 
of 
those 
necessaries 
which 
are 
in 
the 
most 
frequented 
Towns, 
I 
could 
live 
as 
solitary 
and 
retired 
as 
in 
the 
most 
remote 
deserts. 


[50] 


PART. 
IIII. 


I 
Know 
not 
whether 
I 
ought 
to 
entertain 
you 
with 
the 
first 
Meditations 
which 
I 
had 
there, 
for 
they 
are 
so 
Metaphysicall 
and 
so 
little 
common, 
that 
perhaps 
they 
will 
not 
be 
relished 
by 
all 
men: 
And 
yet 
that 
you 
may 
judge 
whether 
the 
foundations 
I 
have 
laid 
are 
firm 
enough, 
I 
find 
my 
self 
in 
a 
manner 
oblig’d 
to 
discourse 
them; 
I 
had 
long 
since 
observed 
that 
as 
for 
manners, 
it 
was 
somtimes 
necessary 
to 
follow 
those 
opinions 
which 
we 
know 
to 
be 
very 
uncertain, 
as 
much 
as 
if 
they 
were 
indubitable, 
as 
is 
beforesaid: 
But 
because 
that 
then 
I 
desired 
onely 
to 
intend 
the 
search 
of 
truth, 
I 
thought 
I 
ought 
to 
doe 
the 
contrary, 
and 
reject 
as 
absolutely 
false 
all 
wherein 
I 
could 
imagine 
the 
least 
doubt, 
to 
the 
end 
I 
might 
see 
if 
afterwards 
any 
thing 
[51]might 
remain 
in 
my 
belief, 
not 
at 
all 
subject 
to 
doubt. 
Thus 
because 
our 
senses 
sometimes 
deceive 
us, 
I 
would 
suppose 
that 
there 
was 
nothing 
which 
was 
such 
as 
they 
represented 
it 
to 
us. 
And 
because 
there 
are 
men 
who 
mistake 
themselves 
in 
reasoning, 
even 
in 
the 
most 
simple 
matters 
of 
Geometry, 
and 
make 
therein 



Paralogismes, 
judging 
that 
I 
was 
as 
subject 
to 
fail 
as 
any 
other 
Man, 
I 
rejected 
as 
false 
all 
those 
reasons, 
which 
I 
had 
before 
taken 
for 
Demonstrations. 
And 
considering, 
that 
the 
same 
thoughts 
which 
we 
have 
waking, 
may 
also 
happen 
to 
us 
sleeping, 
when 
as 
not 
any 
one 
of 
them 
is 
true. 
I 
resolv’d 
to 
faign, 
that 
all 
those 
things 
which 
ever 
entred 
into 
my 
Minde, 
were 
no 
more 
true, 
then 
the 
illusions 
of 
my 
dreams. 
But 
presently 
after 
I 
observ’d, 
that 
whilst 
I 
would 
think 
that 
all 
was 
false, 
it 
must 
necessarily 
follow, 
that 
I 
who 
thought 
it, 
must 
be 
something. 
And 
perceiving 
that 
this 
Truth, 
I 
think, 
therefore, 
I 
am, 
was 
so 
firm 
and 
certain, 
[52]that 
all 
the 
most 
extravagant 
suppositions 
of 
the 
Scepticks 
was 
not 
able 
to 
shake 
it, 
I 
judg’d 
that 
I 
might 
receive 
it 
without 
scruple 
for 
the 
first 
principle 
of 
the 
Philosophy 
I 
sought. 


Examining 
carefully 
afterwards 
what 
I 
was; 
and 
seeing 
that 
I 
could 
suppose 
that 
I 
had 
no 
body, 
and 
that 
there 
was 
no 
World, 
nor 
anyplace 
where 
I 
was: 
but 
for 
all 
this, 
I 
could 
not 
feign 
that 
I 
was 
not; 
and 
that 
even 
contrary 
thereto, 
thinking 
to 
doubt 
the 
truth 
of 
other 
things, 
it 
most 
evidently 
and 
certainly 
followed, 
That 
I 
was: 
whereas, 
if 
I 
had 
ceas’d 
to 
think, 
although 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
what-ever 
I 
had 
imagined 
were 
true, 
I 
had 
no 
reason 
to 
beleeve 
that 
I 
had 
been. 
I 
knew 
then 
that 
I 
was 
a 
substance, 
whose 
whole 
essence 
or 
nature 
is, 
but 
to 
think, 
and 
who 
to 
be, 
hath 
need 
of 
no 
place, 
nor 
depends 
on 
any 
materiall 
thing. 
So 
that 
this 
Me, 
to 
wit, 
my 
Soul, 
by 
which 
I 
am 
what 
I 
am, 
is 
wholly 
distinct 
from 
the 
Body, 
and 
[53]more 
easie 
to 
be 
known 
then 
it; 
and 
although 
that 
were 
not, 
it 
would 
not 
therefore 
cease 
to 
be 
what 
it 
is. 


After 
this 
I 
considered 
in 
generall 
what 
is 
requisite 
in 
a 
Proposition 
to 
make 
it 
true 
and 
certain: 
for 
since 
I 
had 
found 
out 
one 
which 
I 
knew 
to 
be 
so, 
I 
thought 
I 
ought 
also 
to 
consider 
wherein 
that 
certainty 
consisted: 
and 
having 
observed, 
That 
there 
is 
nothing 
at 
all 
in 
this,I 
think, 
therefore 
I 
am, 
which 
assures 
me 
that 
I 
speak 
the 
truth, 
except 
this, 
that 
I 
see 
most 
cleerly, 
That 
to 
think, 
one 
must 
have 
a 
being; 
I 
judg’d 
that 
I 
might 
take 
for 
a 
generall 
rule, 
That 
those 
things 
which 
we 
conceive 
cleerly 
and 
distinctly, 
are 
all 
true; 
and 
that 
the 
onely 
difficulty 
is 
punctually 
to 
observe 
what 
those 
are 
which 
we 
distinctly 
conceive. 


In 
pursuance 
whereof, 
reflecting 
on 
what 
I 
doubted, 
and 
that 
consequently 
my 
being 
was 
not 
perfect; 
for 
I 
clearly 
perceived, 
that 
it 
was 
a 
greater 
perfection 
to 
know, 
then 
to 
doubt, 
[54]I 
advised 
in 
my 
self 
to 
seek 
from 



whence 
I 
had 
learnt 
to 
think 
on 
something 
which 
was 
more 
perfect 
then 
I; 
and 
I 
knew 
evidently 
that 
it 
must 
be 
of 
some 
nature 
which 
was 
indeed 
more 
perfect. 
As 
for 
what 
concerns 
the 
thoughts 
I 
had 
of 
divers 
other 
things 
without 
my 
self, 
as 
of 
heaven, 
earth, 
light, 
heat, 
and 
a 
thousand 
more, 
I 
was 
not 
so 
much 
troubled 
to 
know 
whence 
they 
came, 
for 
that 
I 
observed 
nothing 
in 
them 
which 
seemed 
to 
render 
them 
superiour 
to 
me; 
I 
might 
beleeve, 
that 
if 
they 
were 
true, 
they 
were 
dependancies 
from 
my 
nature, 
as 
far 
forth 
as 
it 
had 
any 
perfection; 
and 
if 
they 
were 
not, 
I 
made 
no 
accompt 
of 
them; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
That 
they 
were 
in 
me, 
because 
I 
had 
something 
deficient. 
But 
it 
could 
not 
be 
the 
same 
with 
the 
Idea 
of 
a 
being 
more 
perfect 
then 
mine: 
For 
to 
esteem 
of 
it 
as 
of 
nothing, 
was 
a 
thing 
manifestly 
impossible. 
And 
because 
there 
is 
no 
lesse 
repugnancy 
that 
the 
more 
perfect 
should 
succeed 
from 
and 
depend 
[55]upon 
the 
less 
perfect, 
then 
for 
something 
to 
proceed 
from 
nothing, 
I 
could 
no 
more 
hold 
it 
from 
my 
self: 
So 
as 
it 
followed, 
that 
it 
must 
have 
bin 
put 
into 
me 
by 
a 
Nature 
which 
was 
truly 
more 
perfect 
then 
I, 
and 
even 
which 
had 
in 
it 
all 
the 
perfections 
whereof 
I 
could 
have 
an 
Idea; 
to 
wit, 
(to 
explain 
my 
self 
in 
one 
word) 
God. 
Whereto 
I 
added, 
that 
since 
I 
knew 
some 
perfections 
which 
I 
had 
not, 
I 
was 
not 
the 
onely 
Being 
which 
had 
an 
existence, 
(I 
shall, 
under 
favour, 
use 
here 
freely 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
Schools) 
but 
that 
of 
necessity 
there 
must 
be 
some 
other 
more 
perfect 
whereon 
I 
depended, 
and 
from 
whom 
I 
had 
gotten 
all 
what 
I 
had: 
For 
had 
I 
been 
alone, 
and 
depending 
upon 
no 
other 
thing, 
so 
that 
I 
had 
had 
of 
my 
self 
all 
that 
little 
which 
I 
participated 
of 
a 
perfect 
Being, 
I 
might 
have 
had 
by 
the 
same 
reason 
from 
my 
self, 
all 
the 
remainder 
which 
I 
knew 
I 
wanted, 
and 
so 
have 
been 
my 
self 
infinite, 
eternall, 
immutable, 
all-knowing, 
almighty; 
[56]and 
lastly, 
have 
had 
all 
those 
perfections 
which 
I 
have 
observed 
to 
be 
in 
God. 
For 
according 
to 
the 
way 
of 
reasoning 
I 
have 
now 
followed, 
to 
know 
the 
nature 
of 
God, 
as 
far 
as 
mine 
own 
was 
capable 
of 
it, 
I 
was 
onely 
to 
consider 
of 
those 
things 
of 
which 
I 
found 
an 
Idea 
in 
me, 
whether 
the 
possessing 
of 
them 
were 
a 
perfection 
or 
no; 
and 
I 
was 
sure, 
that 
any 
of 
those 
which 
had 
any 
imperfections 
were 
not 
in 
him, 
but 
that 
all 
others 
were. 
I 
saw 
that 
doubtfulness, 
inconstancy, 
sorrow 
and 
the 
like, 
could 
not 
be 
in 
him, 
seeing 
I 
could 
my 
self 
have 
wish’d 
to 
have 
been 
exempted 
from 
them. 
Besides 
this, 
I 
had 
the 
Ideas 
of 
divers 
sensible 
and 
corporeall 
things; 
for 
although 
I 
supposed 
that 
I 
doted, 
and 
that 
all 
that 
I 
saw 
or 
imagined 
was 
false; 
yet 
could 
I 
not 
deny 
but 
that 
these 
Ideas 
were 
truly 
in 
my 
thoughts. 
But 
because 
I 
had 
most 
evidently 
known 
in 
my 
self, 
That 
the 
understanding 
Nature 
is 
distinct 



from 
the 
corporeall, 
considering 
that 
all 
composition 
[57]witnesseth 
a 
dependency, 
and 
that 
dependency 
is 
manifestly 
a 
defect, 
I 
thence 
judged 
that 
it 
could 
not 
be 
a 
perfection 
in 
God 
to 
be 
composed 
of 
those 
two 
Natures; 
and 
that 
by 
consequence 
he 
was 
not 
so 
composed. 
But 
that 
if 
there 
were 
any 
Bodies 
in 
the 
world, 
or 
els 
any 
intelligences, 
or 
other 
Natures 
which 
were 
not 
wholly 
perfect, 
their 
being 
must 
depend 
from 
his 
power 
in 
such 
a 
manner, 
that 
they 
could 
not 
subsist 
one 
moment 
without 
him. 


Thence 
I 
went 
in 
search 
of 
other 
Truths; 
and 
having 
proposed 
Geometry 
for 
my 
object, 
which 
I 
conceived 
as 
a 
continued 
Body, 
or 
a 
space 
indefinitely 
spred 
in 
length, 
bredth, 
height 
or 
depth, 
divisible 
into 
divers 
parts, 
which 
might 
take 
severall 
figures 
and 
bignesses, 
and 
be 
moved 
and 
transposed 
every 
way. 
For 
the 
Geometricians 
suppose 
all 
this 
in 
their 
object. 
I 
past 
through 
some 
of 
their 
most 
simple 
demonstrations; 
and 
having 
observed 
that 
this 
great 
certaintie, 
[58]which 
all 
the 
world 
grants 
them, 
is 
founded 
only 
on 
this, 
that 
men 
evidently 
conceived 
them, 
following 
the 
rule 
I 
already 
mentioned. 
I 
observed 
also 
that 
there 
was 
nothing 
at 
all 
in 
them 
which 
ascertain’d 
me 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
their 
object. 
As 
for 
example, 
I 
well 
perceive, 
that 
supposing 
a 
Triangle, 
three 
angles 
necessarily 
must 
be 
equall 
to 
two 
right 
ones: 
but 
yet 
nevertheless 
I 
saw 
nothing 
which 
assured 
me 
that 
there 
was 
a 
Triangle 
in 
the 
world. 
Whereas 
returning 
to 
examine 
the 
Ideawhich 
I 
had 
of 
a 
perfect 
Being, 
I 
found 
its 
existence 
comprised 
in 
it, 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
it 
was 
comprised 
in 
that 
of 
a 
Triangle, 
where 
the 
three 
angles 
are 
equall 
to 
two 
right 
ones; 
or 
in 
that 
of 
a 
sphere, 
where 
all 
the 
parts 
are 
equally 
distant 
from 
the 
center. 
Or 
even 
yet 
more 
evidently, 
and 
that 
by 
consequence, 
it 
is 
at 
least 
as 
certain 
that 
God, 
who 
is 
that 
perfect 
Being, 
is, 
or 
exists, 
as 
any 
demonstration 
in 
Geometry 
can 
be. 


[59]But 
that 
which 
makes 
many 
perswade 
themselves 
that 
there 
is 
difficulty 
in 
knowing 
it, 
as 
also 
to 
know 
what 
their 
Soul 
is, 
’tis 
that 
they 
never 
raise 
their 
thoughts 
beyond 
sensible 
things, 
and 
that 
they 
are 
so 
accustomed 
to 
consider 
nothing 
but 
by 
imagination, 
which 
is 
a 
particular 
manner 
of 
thinking 
on 
materiall 
things, 
that 
whatsoever 
is 
not 
imaginable 
seems 
to 
them 
not 
intelligible. 
Which 
is 
manifest 
enough 
from 
this, 
that 
even 
the 
Philosophers 
hold 
for 
a 
Maxime 
in 
the 
Schools, 
That 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
the 
understanding 
which 
was 
not 
first 
in 
the 
sense; 
where 
notwithstanding 
its 
certain, 
that 
the 
Ideas 
of 
God 
and 
of 
the 
Soul 
never 
were. 
And 
(me 
thinks) 
those 
who 
use 
their 
imagination 
to 
comprehend 
them, 
are 
just 
as 
those, 
who 

to 
hear 
sounds, 
or 
smell 
odours, 
would 
make 
use 
of 
their 
eys; 
save 
that 
there 
is 
yet 
this 
difference, 
That 
the 
sense 
of 
seeing 
assures 
us 
no 
lesse 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
its 
objects, 
then 
those 
of 
smelling 
or 
hearing 
do: 
[60]whereas 
neither 
our 
imagination, 
nor 
our 
senses, 
can 
ever 
assure 
us 
of 
any 
thing, 
if 
our 
understanding 
intervenes 
not. 


To 
be 
short, 
if 
there 
remain 
any 
who 
are 
not 
enough 
perswaded 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
God, 
and 
of 
their 
soul, 
from 
the 
reasons 
I 
have 
produc’d, 
I 
would 
have 
them 
know, 
that 
all 
other 
things, 
whereof 
perhaps 
they 
think 
themselves 
more 
assured, 
as 
to 
have 
a 
body, 
and 
that 
there 
are 
Stars, 
and 
an 
earth, 
and 
the 
like, 
are 
less 
certain. 
For 
although 
we 
had 
such 
a 
morall 
assurance 
of 
these 
things, 
that 
without 
being 
extravagant 
we 
could 
not 
doubt 
of 
them. 
However, 
unless 
we 
be 
unreasonable 
when 
a 
metaphysicall 
certainty 
is 
in 
question, 
we 
cannot 
deny 
but 
we 
have 
cause 
enough 
not 
to 
be 
wholly 
confirmed 
in 
them, 
when 
we 
consider 
that 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
we 
may 
imagine 
being 
asleep, 
we 
have 
other 
bodies, 
and 
that 
we 
see 
other 
Stars, 
and 
another 
earth, 
though 
there 
be 
no 
such 
thing. 
For 
how 
doe 
[61]we 
know 
that 
those 
thoughts 
which 
we 
have 
in 
our 
dreams, 
are 
rather 
false 
then 
the 
others, 
seeing 
often 
they 
are 
no 
less 
lively 
and 
significant, 
and 
let 
the 
ablest 
men 
study 
it 
as 
long 
as 
they 
please, 
I 
beleeve 
they 
can 
give 
no 
sufficient 
reason 
to 
remove 
this 
doubt, 
unless 
they 
presuppose 
the 
existence 
of 
God. 
For 
first 
of 
all, 
that 
which 
I 
even 
now 
took 
for 
a 
rule, 
to 
wit, 
that 
those 
things 
which 
were 
most 
clearly 
and 
distinctly 
conceived, 
are 
all 
true, 
is 
certain, 
only 
by 
reason, 
that 
God 
is 
or 
exists, 
and 
that 
he 
is 
a 
perfect 
being, 
and 
that 
all 
which 
we 
have 
comes 
from 
him. 
Whence 
it 
follows, 
that 
our 
Idea’s 
or 
notions, 
being 
reall 
things, 
and 
which 
come 
from 
God 
in 
all 
wherein 
they 
are 
clear 
and 
distinct, 
cannot 
therein 
be 
but 
true. 
So 
that 
if 
we 
have 
very 
often 
any 
which 
contain 
falshood, 
they 
cannot 
be 
but 
of 
such 
things 
which 
are 
somewhat 
confus’d 
and 
obscure, 
because 
that 
therein 
they 
signifie 
nothing 
to 
us, 
that’s 
to 
say, 
that 
they 
are 
thus 
confus’d 
in 
us 
only, 
because 
[62]we 
are 
not 
wholly 
perfect. 
And 
it’s 
evident 
that 
there 
is 
no 
less 
contrariety 
that 
falshood 
and 
imperfection 
should 
proceed 
from 
God, 
as 
such, 
then 
there 
is 
in 
this, 
that 
truth 
and 
falshood 
proceed 
from 
nothing. 
But 
if 
we 
know 
not 
that 
whatsoever 
was 
true 
and 
reall 
in 
us 
comes 
from 
a 
perfect 
and 
infinite 
being, 
how 
clear 
and 
distinct 
soever 
our 
Idea’s 
were, 
we 
should 
have 
no 
reason 
to 
assure 
us, 
that 
they 
had 
the 
perfection 
to 
be 
true. 


Now 
after 
that 
the 
knowledge 
of 
God, 
and 
of 
the 
Soul 
hath 
rendred 
us 
thus 



certain 
of 
this 
rule, 
it’s 
easie 
to 
know; 
that 
the 
extravaganceys 
which 
we 
imagin 
in 
our 
sleep, 
ought 
no 
way 
to 
make 
us 
doubt 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
those 
thoughts 
which 
we 
have 
being 
awake: 
For 
if 
it 
should 
happen, 
that 
even 
sleeping 
we 
should 
have 
a 
very 
distinct 
Idea; 
as 
for 
example, 
A 
Geometritian 
should 
invent 
some 
new 
demonstration, 
his 
sleeping 
would 
not 
hinder 
it 
to 
be 
true. 
And 
for 
the 
[63]most 
ordinary 
error 
of 
our 
dreames, 
which 
consists 
in 
that 
they 
represent 
unto 
us 
severall 
objects 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
our 
exterior 
senses 
doe, 
it 
matters 
not 
though 
it 
give 
us 
occasion 
to 
mistrust 
the 
truth 
of 
those 
Ideas, 
because 
that 
they 
may 
also 
often 
enough 
cozen 
us 
when 
we 
doe 
not 
sleep; 
As 
when 
to 
those 
who 
have 
the 
Jaundies, 
all 
they 
see 
seems 
yellow; 
or, 
as 
the 
Stars 
or 
other 
bodies 
at 
a 
distance, 
appear 
much 
less 
then 
they 
are. 
For 
in 
fine, 
whether 
we 
sleep 
or 
wake, 
we 
ought 
never 
to 
suffer 
our 
selves 
to 
be 
perswaded 
but 
by 
the 
evidence 
of 
our 
Reason; 
I 
say, 
(which 
is 
observable) 
Of 
our 
Reason, 
and 
not 
of 
our 
imagination, 
or 
of 
our 
senses. 
As 
although 
we 
see 
the 
Sun 
most 
clearly, 
we 
are 
not 
therefore 
to 
judge 
him 
to 
be 
of 
the 
bigness 
we 
see 
him 
of; 
and 
we 
may 
well 
distinctly 
imagine 
the 
head 
of 
a 
Lion, 
set 
on 
the 
body 
of 
a 
Goat, 
but 
therefore 
we 
ought 
not 
to 
conclude 
that 
there 
is 
a 
Chimera 
in 
the 
world. 
For 
reason 
doth 
not 
dictate 
[64]to 
us, 
that 
what 
we 
see 
or 
imagine 
so, 
is 
true: 
But 
it 
dictates, 
that 
all 
our 
Idea’s 
or 
notions 
ought 
to 
have 
some 
grounds 
of 
truth; 
For 
it 
were 
not 
possible, 
that 
God 
who 
is 
all 
perfect, 
and 
all 
truth, 
should 
have 
put 
them 
in 
us 
without 
that: 
And 
because 
that 
our 
reasonings 
are 
never 
so 
evident, 
nor 
so 
entire 
while 
we 
sleep, 
as 
when 
we 
wake, 
although 
sometimes 
our 
imaginations 
be 
then 
as 
much 
or 
more 
lively 
and 
express. 
It 
also 
dictates 
to 
us, 
that 
our 
thoughts, 
seeing 
they 
cannot 
be 
all 
true 
by 
reason 
that 
we 
are 
not 
wholly 
perfect; 
what 
they 
have 
of 
truth, 
ought 
infallibly 
to 
occur 
in 
those 
which 
we 
have 
being 
awake, 
rather 
then 
in 
our 
dreams. 


[65] 


PART. 
V. 


I 
should 
be 
glad 
to 
pursue 
this 
Discourse, 
and 
shew 
you 
the 
whole 
Series 
of 
the 
following 
Truths, 
which 
I 
have 
drawn 
from 
the 
former: 
But 
because 
for 
this 
purpose, 
it 
were 
now 
necessary 
for 
me 
to 
treat 
of 
severall 
questions, 
which 
are 
controverted 
by 
the 
learned, 
with 
whom 
I 
have 
no 
desire 
to 
imbroil 
my 
self, 
I 
beleeve 
it 
better 
for 
me 
to 
abstain 
from 
it; 
and 
so 
in 
generall 
onely 



to 
discover 
what 
they 
are, 
that 
I 
may 
leave 
the 
wisest 
to 
judge 
whether 
it 
were 
profitable 
to 
inform 
the 
publick 
more 
particularly 
of 
them. 
I 
alwayes 
remained 
constant 
to 
my 
resolution, 
to 
suppose 
no 
other 
Principle 
but 
that 
which 
I 
now 
made 
use 
of, 
for 
the 
demonstration 
of 
the 
Existence 
of 
God, 
and 
of 
[66]the 
Soul; 
and 
to 
receive 
nothing 
for 
true, 
which 
did 
not 
seem 
to 
me 
more 
clear 
and 
more 
certain 
then 
the 
demonstrations 
of 
Geometry 
had 
formerly 
done. 
And 
yet 
I 
dare 
say, 
that 
I 
have 
not 
onely 
found 
out 
the 
means 
to 
satisfie 
my 
self, 
in 
a 
short 
time, 
concerning 
all 
the 
principall 
difficulties 
which 
are 
usually 
treated 
in 
Philosophy. 
But 
that 
also 
I 
have 
observed 
certain 
Laws 
which 
God 
hath 
so 
established 
in 
Nature, 
and 
of 
which 
he 
hath 
imprinted 
such 
notions 
in 
our 
Souls, 
that 
when 
we 
shall 
have 
made 
sufficient 
reflections 
upon 
them 
we 
cannot 
doubt 
but 
that 
they 
are 
exactly 
observed 
in 
whatsoever 
either 
is, 
or 
is 
done 
in 
the 
World. 
Then 
considering 
the 
connexion 
of 
these 
Laws, 
me 
thinks, 
I 
have 
discovercd 
divers 
Truths, 
more 
usefull 
and 
important 
then 
whatever 
I 
learn’d 
before, 
or 
ever 
hop’d 
to 
learn. 


But 
because 
I 
have 
endeavoured 
to 
lay 
open 
the 
principall 
of 
them 
in 
a 
Treatise, 
which 
some 
considerations 
[67]hinder 
me 
from 
publishing; 
I 
can 
no 
way 
better 
make 
them 
known, 
then 
by 
relating 
summarily 
what 
it 
contains. 


I 
had 
a 
designe 
to 
comprehend 
all 
what 
I 
thought 
I 
knew, 
before 
I 
would 
write 
it, 
touching 
the 
nature 
of 
material 
things. 
But 
even 
as 
Painters, 
not 
being 
able 
equally 
well 
to 
represent 
upon 
a 
flat 
all 
the 
severall 
facies 
of 
a 
solid 
body, 
chuse 
the 
principall 
of 
them, 
which 
they 
place 
towards 
the 
light; 
and 
shadowing 
the 
others, 
make 
them 
appear 
no 
more 
then 
they 
do 
to 
our 
sight: 
So, 
fearing 
lest 
I 
should 
not 
bring 
into 
this 
Discourse 
all 
which 
was 
in 
my 
thoughts, 
I 
onely 
undertook 
to 
set 
forth 
at 
large 
my 
conceptions 
touching 
the 
light; 
and 
upon 
that 
occasion 
to 
add 
somewhat 
of 
the 
Sun, 
and 
of 
the 
fix’d 
Stars, 
by 
reason 
that 
it 
proceeds 
almost 
all 
from 
thence; 
of 
the 
Heavens, 
because 
they 
transmit 
it; 
of 
the 
Planets, 
of 
the 
Comets, 
and 
of 
the 
Earth, 
because 
they 
cause 
it 
to 
reflect; 
[68]and 
in 
particular, 
of 
all 
Bodies 
which 
are 
on 
the 
earth, 
whether 
for 
that 
they 
are 
either 
coloured, 
or 
transparent, 
or 
luminous; 
and 
last 
of 
all, 
of 
Man, 
because 
he 
is 
the 
Spectator 
thereof. 
As 
also, 
in 
some 
manner 
to 
shadow 
out 
all 
these 
things, 
and 
that 
I 
might 
the 
more 
freely 
speak 
what 
I 
judg’d, 
without 
being 
obliged 
to 
follow, 
or 
to 
refute 
the 
opinions 
which 
are 
received 
amongst 
the 
Learned, 
I 
resolved 
to 
leave 
all 
this 
world 
here 
to 
their 
disputes, 
and 
to 
speak 
onely 
of 
what 
would 
happen 
in 
a 
new 
one, 
if 
God 
now 
created 
some 
where 
in 
those 
imaginary 
spaces 
matter 



enough 
to 
compose 
it, 
and 
that 
he 
diversly 
and 
without 
order 
agitated 
the 
severall 
parts 
of 
this 
matter, 
so 
as 
to 
compose 
a 
Chaos 
of 
it 
as 
confused 
as 
the 
Poets 
could 
feign 
one: 
and 
that 
afterwards 
he 
did 
nothing 
but 
lend 
his 
ordinary 
concurrence 
to 
Nature, 
and 
leave 
her 
to 
work 
according 
to 
the 
Laws 
he 
hath 
established. 


Thus 
first 
of 
all 
I 
described 
this 
Matter, 
[69]and 
endevoured 
to 
represent 
it 
such, 
that 
me 
thinks 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
the 
world 
more 
clear, 
or 
more 
intelligible, 
except 
what 
was 
beforesaid 
of 
God, 
and 
of 
the 
Soul. 
For 
even 
I 
expresly 
supposed 
that 
there 
was 
in 
it 
none 
of 
those 
forms 
and 
qualities 
which 
are 
disputed 
in 
the 
Schools; 
nor 
generally 
any 
thing 
but 
that 
the 
knowledge 
thereof 
was 
so 
naturall 
to 
our 
understandings, 
that 
we 
could 
not 
even 
feigne 
to 
be 
ignorant 
of 
it. 
Besides, 
I 
made 
known 
what 
the 
Laws 
of 
Nature 
were; 
and 
without 
grounding 
my 
reasons 
on 
any 
other 
principles, 
but 
on 
the 
infinite 
perfections 
of 
God, 
I 
did 
endeavour 
to 
demonstrate 
all 
those 
which 
might 
be 
questioned, 
and 
to 
make 
them 
appear 
to 
be 
such, 
that 
although 
God 
had 
created 
divers 
worlds, 
there 
could 
have 
been 
none 
where 
they 
were 
not 
observed. 
Afterwards 
I 
shewed 
how 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
Matter 
of 
this 
Chaos 
ought, 
according 
to 
those 
Laws, 
to 
dispose 
and 
order 
it 
self 
in 
a 
certain 
[70]manner, 
which 
would 
make 
it 
like 
our 
Heavens: 
And 
how 
some 
of 
these 
parts 
were 
to 
compose 
an 
Earth, 
and 
some 
Planets 
and 
Commets, 
some 
others 
a 
Sun 
and 
fix’d 
Starrs. 
And 
here 
enlarging 
my 
self 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
Light, 
I 
at 
length 
explain’d 
what 
that 
light 
was, 
which 
was 
to 
be 
in 
the 
Sun 
and 
Stars; 
and 
thence 
how 
it 
travers’d 
in 
an 
instant 
the 
immense 
spaces 
of 
the 
Heavens, 
and 
how 
it 
reflected 
it 
self 
from 
Planets 
and 
Commets 
towards 
the 
Earth. 
I 
added 
also 
divers 
things 
touching 
the 
substance, 
situation, 
the 
motions, 
and 
all 
the 
several 
qualities 
of 
these 
heavens 
and 
these 
stars: 
So 
that 
I 
thought 
I 
had 
said 
enough 
to 
make 
known, 
That 
there 
is 
nothing 
remarkable 
in 
those 
of 
this 
world, 
which 
ought 
not, 
or 
at 
least 
could 
not 
appear 
altogether 
like 
to 
these 
of 
that 
world 
which 
Idescribed. 


Thence 
I 
came 
to 
speak 
particularly 
of 
the 
Earth; 
how, 
although 
I 
had 
expresly 
supposed, 
that 
God 
had 
placed 
[71]no 
weight 
in 
the 
Matter 
whereof 
it 
was 
composed; 
yet 
all 
its 
parts 
exactly 
tended 
towards 
its 
center: 
How 
that 
there 
being 
water 
and 
air 
upon 
its 
superficies, 
the 
disposition 
of 
the 
Heavens, 
and 
of 
the 
Starrs, 
and 
chiefly 
of 
the 
Moon, 
ought 
to 
cause 
a 
floud 
and 
an 
ebb, 
which 
in 
all 
circumstances 
was 
like 
to 
that 
which 
we 
observe 
in 
our 
Seas; 
And 
besides, 
a 
certain 
course 
aswel 
of 
the 
water, 
as 
of 
the 
air, 
from 
East 
to 



West, 
as 
is 
also 
observed 
between 
the 
Tropicks: 
How 
the 
Mountains, 
the 
Seas, 
the 
Springs 
and 
Rivers 
might 
naturally 
be 
form’d 
therein, 
and 
Metals 
run 
in 
the 
mines, 
and 
Plants 
grow 
in 
the 
Fields, 
and 
generally 
all 
bodies 
be 
therein 
engendered 
which 
are 
call’d 
mixt 
or 
composed. 


And 
amongst 
other 
things, 
because 
that 
next 
the 
Stars, 
I 
know 
nothing 
in 
the 
world 
but 
Fire, 
which 
produceth 
light, 
I 
studied 
to 
make 
all 
clearly 
understood 
which 
belongs 
to 
its 
nature; 
how 
it’s 
made, 
how 
it’s 
fed, 
[72]how 
sometimes 
it 
hath 
heat 
onely 
without 
light, 
and 
sometimes 
onely 
light 
without 
heat; 
how 
it 
can 
introduce 
several 
colours 
into 
several 
bodies, 
and 
divers 
other 
qualities; 
how 
it 
dissolves 
some, 
and 
hardens 
others; 
how 
it 
can 
consume 
almost 
all, 
or 
convert 
them 
into 
ashes 
and 
smoak: 
and 
last 
of 
all, 
how 
of 
those 
ashes, 
by 
the 
only 
violence 
of 
its 
action, 
it 
forms 
glass. 
For 
this 
transmutation 
of 
ashes 
into 
glass, 
seeming 
to 
me 
to 
be 
as 
admirable 
as 
any 
other 
operation 
in 
Nature, 
I 
particularly 
took 
pleasure 
to 
describe 
it. 


Yet 
would 
I 
not 
inferre 
from 
all 
these 
things, 
that 
this 
World 
was 
created 
after 
the 
manner 
I 
had 
proposed. 
For 
it 
is 
more 
probable 
that 
God 
made 
it 
such 
as 
it 
was 
to 
be, 
from 
the 
beginning. 
But 
it's 
certain, 
and 
'tis 
an 
opinion 
commonly 
received 
amongst 
the 
Divines, 
That 
the 
action 
whereby 
he 
now 
preserveth 
it, 
is 
the 
same 
with 
that 
by 
which 
he 
created 
it. 
So 
that, 
although 
at 
the 
beginning 
[73]he 
had 
given 
it 
no 
other 
form 
but 
that 
of 
a 
Chaos 
(provided, 
that 
having 
established 
the 
Laws 
of 
Nature, 
he 
had 
afforded 
his 
concurrence 
to 
it, 
to 
work 
as 
it 
used 
to 
do) 
we 
may 
beleeve 
(without 
doing 
wrong 
to 
the 
miracle 
of 
the 
Creation) 
that 
by 
that 
alone 
all 
things 
which 
are 
purely 
material 
might 
in 
time 
have 
rendred 
themselves 
such 
as 
we 
now 
see 
them: 
and 
their 
nature 
is 
far 
easier 
to 
conceive, 
when 
by 
little 
and 
little 
we 
see 
them 
brought 
forth 
so, 
then 
when 
we 
consider 
them 
quite 
form’d 
all 
at 
once. 


From 
the 
description 
of 
inanimate 
Bodies 
and 
Plants, 
I 
pass’d 
to 
that 
of 
Animals, 
and 
particularly 
to 
that 
of 
Men. 
But 
because 
I 
had 
not 
yet 
knowledge 
enough 
to 
speak 
of 
them 
in 
the 
same 
stile 
as 
of 
the 
others; 
to 
wit, 
in 
demonstrating 
effects 
by 
their 
causes, 
and 
shewing 
from 
what 
seeds, 
and 
in 
what 
manner 
Nature 
ought 
to 
produce 
them; 
I 
contented 
my 
self 
to 
suppose, 
That 
God 
form’d 
the 
body 
[74]of 
a 
Man 
altogether 
like 
one 
of 
ours; 
aswel 
the 
exteriour 
figure 
of 
its 
members, 
as 
in 
the 
interiour 
conformity 
of 
its 
organs; 
without 
framing 
it 
of 
other 
matter 
then 
of 
that 
which 
I 
had 
described; 
and 
without 
putting 
in 
it 
at 
the 
beginning 
any 
reasonable 
soul, 
or 
any 
other 
thing 
to 
serve 
therein 
for 
a 
vegetative 
or 
sensitive 
soul; 
unless 
he 
stirr’d 
up 
in 
his 



heart 
one 
of 
those 
fires 
without 
light 
which 
I 
had 
already 
discovered; 
and 
that 
I 
conceiv’d 
of 
no 
other 
nature 
but 
that 
which 
heats 
hay 
when 
its 
housed 
before 
it 
be 
dry, 
or 
which 
causes 
new 
Wines 
to 
boyl 
when 
it 
works 
upon 
the 
grape: 
For 
examining 
the 
functions 
which 
might 
be 
consequently 
in 
this 
body, 
I 
exactly 
found 
all 
those 
which 
may 
be 
in 
us, 
without 
our 
thinking 
of 
them; 
and 
to 
which 
our 
soul 
(that 
is 
to 
say, 
that 
distinct 
part 
from 
our 
bodies, 
whose 
nature 
(as 
hath 
been 
said 
before) 
is 
onely 
to 
think) 
consequently 
doth 
not 
contribute, 
and 
which 
are 
all 
the 
[75]same 
wherein 
we 
may 
say 
unreasonable 
creatures 
resemble 
us. 
Yet 
could 
I 
not 
finde 
any, 
of 
those 
which 
depending 
from 
the 
thought, 
are 
the 
onely 
ones 
which 
belong 
unto 
us 
as 
Men; 
whereas 
I 
found 
them 
all 
afterwards, 
having 
supposed 
that 
God 
created 
a 
reasonable 
soul, 
and 
that 
he 
joyn’d 
it 
to 
this 
body, 
after 
a 
certain 
manner 
which 
I 
describ’d. 


But 
that 
you 
might 
see 
how 
I 
treated 
this 
matter, 
I 
shall 
here 
present 
you 
with 
the 
explication 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
heart, 
and 
of 
the 
arteries, 
which 
being 
the 
first 
and 
most 
general 
(which 
is 
observed 
in 
animals) 
we 
may 
thereby 
easily 
judge 
what 
we 
ought 
to 
think 
of 
all 
the 
rest. 
And 
that 
we 
may 
have 
the 
less 
difficulty 
to 
understand 
what 
I 
shall 
say 
thereof, 
I 
wish 
those 
who 
are 
not 
versed 
in 
Anatomy, 
would 
take 
the 
pains, 
before 
they 
read 
this, 
to 
cause 
the 
heart 
of 
some 
great 
animal 
which 
hath 
lungs, 
to 
be 
dissected; 
for 
in 
all 
of 
them 
its 
very 
like 
that 
of 
a 
Man: 
and 
that 
[76]they 
may 
have 
shewn 
them 
the 
two 
cels 
or 
concavities 
which 
are 
there: 
First 
that 
on 
the 
right 
side, 
whereto 
two 
large 
conduits 
answer, 
to 
wit, 
the 
vena 
cava, 
which 
is 
the 
principal 
receptacle 
of 
bloud, 
and 
as 
the 
body 
of 
a 
tree, 
whereof 
all 
the 
other 
veins 
of 
the 
body 
are 
branches; 
and 
the 
arterious 
vein, 
which 
was 
so 
miscall’d, 
because 
that 
in 
effect 
its 
an 
artery, 
which 
taking 
its 
origine 
from 
the 
heart, 
divides 
it 
self 
after 
being 
come 
forth, 
into 
divers 
branches, 
which 
every 
way 
spred 
themselves 
through 
the 
lungs. 
Then 
the 
other 
which 
is 
on 
the 
left 
side, 
whereunto 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
two 
pipes 
answer, 
which 
are 
as 
large, 
or 
larger 
then 
the 
former; 
to 
wit, 
the 
veinous 
artery, 
which 
was 
also 
il 
named, 
forasmuch 
as 
its 
nothing 
else 
but 
a 
vein 
which 
comes 
from 
the 
lungs, 
where 
its 
divided 
into 
several 
branches 
interlaid 
with 
those 
of 
the 
arterious 
vein, 
and 
those 
of 
that 
pipe 
which 
is 
called 
the 
Whistle, 
by 
which 
the 
breath 
enters. 
And 
the 
great 
artery, 
[77]which 
proceeding 
from 
the 
heart, 
disperseth 
its 
branches 
thorow 
all 
the 
body. 
I 
would 
also 
that 
they 
would 
carefully 
observe 
the 
eleven 
little 
skins, 
which, 
as 
so 
many 
little 
doors, 
open 
and 
shut 
the 
four 
openings 
which 
are 
in 
these 
two 
concavities; 
to 
wit, 
three 
at 
the 
entry 
of 



the 
vena 
cava, 
where 
they 
are 
so 
disposed, 
that 
they 
can 
no 
wayes 
hinder 
the 
bloud 
which 
it 
contains 
from 
running 
into 
the 
right 
concavity 
of 
the 
heart; 
and 
yet 
altogether 
hinder 
it 
from 
coming 
out. 
Three 
at 
the 
entry 
of 
the 
arterious 
vein; 
which 
being 
disposed 
quite 
contrary, 
permit 
only 
the 
bloud 
which 
is 
in 
that 
concavity 
to 
pass 
to 
the 
lungs; 
but 
not 
that 
which 
is 
in 
the 
lungs 
to 
return 
thither. 
And 
then 
two 
others 
at 
the 
entry 
of 
the 
veinous 
artery, 
which 
permits 
the 
bloud 
to 
run 
to 
the 
left 
concavity 
of 
the 
heart, 
but 
opposeth 
its 
return. 
And 
three 
at 
the 
entry 
of 
the 
great 
artery, 
which 
permit 
it 
to 
go 
from 
the 
heart, 
but 
hinder 
its 
return 
thither. 
Neither 
[78]need 
we 
seek 
any 
other 
reason 
for 
the 
number 
of 
these 
skins, 
save 
only 
that 
the 
opening 
of 
the 
veinous 
artery, 
being 
oval-wise, 
by 
reason 
of 
its 
situation, 
may 
be 
fitly 
shut 
with 
two; 
whereas 
the 
other, 
being 
round, 
may 
the 
better 
be 
clos’d 
with 
three. 
Besides, 
I 
would 
have 
them 
consider, 
that 
the 
great 
artery 
and 
the 
arterious 
vein 
are 
of 
a 
composition 
much 
stronger 
then 
the 
veinous 
artery 
or 
thevena 
cava. 
And 
that 
these 
two 
later 
grow 
larger 
before 
they 
enter 
into 
the 
heart, 
and 
make 
(as 
it 
were) 
two 
purses, 
call’d 
the 
ears 
of 
the 
heart, 
which 
are 
composed 
of 
a 
flesh 
like 
it; 
and 
that 
there 
is 
always 
more 
heat 
in 
the 
heart 
then 
in 
any 
other 
part 
of 
the 
body. 
And 
in 
fine, 
that 
if 
any 
drop 
of 
bloud 
enter 
into 
these 
concavities, 
this 
heat 
is 
able 
to 
make 
it 
presently 
swell 
and 
dilate 
it 
self, 
as 
generally 
all 
liquors 
do, 
when 
drop 
by 
drop 
we 
let 
them 
fall 
into 
a 
very 
hot 
vessel. 


For 
after 
this 
I 
need 
say 
no 
more 
for 
[79]to 
unfold 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
heart, 
but 
that 
when 
these 
concavities 
are 
not 
full 
of 
bloud, 
necessarily 
there 
runs 
some 
from 
the 
vena 
cava 
into 
the 
right, 
and 
from 
the 
veinous 
artery 
into 
the 
left; 
for 
that 
these 
two 
vessels 
are 
always 
full 
of 
it, 
and 
that 
their 
openings 
which 
are 
towards 
the 
heart 
cannot 
then 
be 
shut: 
But 
that 
assoon 
as 
there 
is 
thus 
but 
two 
drops 
of 
bloud 
entred, 
one 
in 
either 
of 
these 
concavities, 
these 
drops, 
which 
cannot 
but 
be 
very 
big, 
by 
reason 
that 
their 
openings 
whereby 
they 
enter 
are 
very 
large, 
and 
the 
vessels 
whence 
they 
come 
very 
full 
of 
bloud, 
are 
rarified 
and 
dilated 
because 
of 
the 
heat 
which 
they 
find 
therein. 
By 
means 
whereof, 
causing 
all 
the 
heart 
to 
swel, 
they 
drive 
and 
shut 
the 
five 
little 
doors 
which 
are 
at 
the 
entry 
of 
the 
two 
vessels 
whence 
they 
come, 
hindering 
thereby 
any 
more 
bloud 
to 
fall 
down 
into 
the 
heart, 
and 
continuing 
more 
and 
more 
to 
rarifie 
themselves, 
they 
drive 
and 
open 
the 
six 
other 
little 
[80]doors 
which 
are 
at 
the 
entry 
of 
the 
other 
two 
vessels 
whence 
they 
issue, 
causing 
by 
that 
means 
all 
the 
branches 
of 
the 
arterious 
vein, 
and 
of 
the 
great 
artery, 
to 
swel 
(as 
it 
were) 
at 
the 
same 
time 
with 
the 
heart: 
which 
presently 
after 
fals, 
as 



those 
arteries 
also 
do, 
by 
reason 
that 
the 
bloud 
which 
is 
entred 
therein 
grows 
colder, 
and 
their 
six 
little 
doors 
shut 
up 
again, 
and 
those 
five 
of 
the 
vena 
cava, 
and 
of 
the 
veinous 
artery 
open 
again, 
and 
give 
way 
to 
two 
other 
drops 
of 
bloud, 
which 
again 
swell 
the 
heart 
and 
the 
arteries 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
the 
preceding 
did. 
And 
because 
the 
bloud 
which 
thus 
enters 
into 
the 
heart, 
passeth 
thorow 
those 
two 
purses, 
which 
are 
call’d 
the 
ears; 
thence 
it 
comes, 
that 
their 
motion 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
heart’s, 
and 
that 
they 
fall 
when 
that 
swels. 


Lastly, 
That 
they 
who 
know 
not 
the 
force 
of 
Mathematical 
demonstrations, 
and 
are 
not 
accustomed 
to 
distinguish 
true 
reasons 
from 
probable 
ones, 
may 
not 
venture 
to 
deny 
this 
[81]without 
examining 
it, 
I 
shall 
advertise 
them, 
that 
this 
motion 
which 
I 
have 
now 
discovered, 
as 
necessarily 
follows 
from 
the 
onely 
disposition 
of 
the 
organs 
(which 
may 
plainly 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
heart,) 
and 
from 
the 
heat 
(which 
we 
may 
feel 
with 
our 
fingers,) 
and 
from 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
bloud 
(which 
we 
may 
know 
by 
experience,) 
as 
the 
motions 
of 
a 
clock 
doth 
by 
the 
force, 
situation 
and 
figure 
of 
its 
weight 
and 
wheels. 


But 
if 
it 
be 
asked, 
how 
it 
comes 
that 
the 
bloud 
of 
the 
veins 
is 
not 
exhausted, 
running 
so 
continually 
into 
the 
heart; 
and 
how 
that 
the 
arteries 
are 
not 
too 
full, 
since 
all 
that 
which 
passeth 
thorow 
the 
heart 
dischargeth 
it 
self 
into 
them: 
I 
need 
answer 
nothing 
thereto 
but 
what 
hath 
been 
already 
writ 
by 
an 
English 
Physician, 
to 
whom 
this 
praise 
must 
be 
given, 
to 
have 
broken 
the 
ice 
in 
this 
place, 
and 
to 
be 
the 
first 
who 
taught 
us, 
That 
there 
are 
several 
little 
passages 
in 
the 
extremity 
of 
the 
arteries 
whereby 
the 
[82]bloud 
which 
they 
receive 
from 
the 
heart, 
enters 
the 
little 
branches 
of 
the 
veins; 
whence 
again 
it 
sends 
it 
self 
back 
towards 
the 
heart: 
so 
that 
its 
course 
is 
no 
other 
thing 
but 
a 
perpetuall 
circulation. 
Which 
he 
very 
wel 
proves 
by 
the 
ordinary 
experience 
of 
Chirurgians, 
who 
having 
bound 
the 
arm 
indifferently 
hard 
above 
the 
the 
place 
where 
they 
open 
the 
vein, 
which 
causeth 
the 
bloud 
to 
issue 
more 
abundantly, 
then 
if 
it 
had 
not 
been 
bound. 
And 
the 
contrary 
would 
happen, 
were 
it 
bound 
underneath, 
between 
the 
hand 
and 
the 
incision, 
or 
bound 
very 
hard 
above. 
For 
its 
manifest, 
that 
the 
band 
indifferently 
tyed, 
being 
able 
to 
hinder 
the 
bloud 
which 
is 
already 
in 
the 
arm 
to 
return 
towards 
the 
heart 
by 
the 
veins; 
yet 
it 
therefore 
hinders 
not 
the 
new 
from 
coming 
always 
by 
the 
arteries, 
by 
reason 
they 
are 
placed 
under 
the 
veins, 
and 
that 
their 
skin 
being 
thicker, 
are 
less 
easie 
to 
be 
press’d, 
as 
also 
that 
the 
bloud 
which 
comes 
from 
the 
[83]heart, 
seeks 
more 
forcibly 
to 
passe 
by 
them 
towards 
the 
hand, 
then 
it 
doth 
to 
return 
from 
thence 
towards 
the 
heart 
by 
the 
veins. 
And 
since 
this 



bloud 
which 
issues 
from 
the 
arm 
by 
the 
incision 
made 
in 
one 
of 
the 
veins, 
must 
necessarily 
have 
some 
passage 
under 
the 
bond, 
to 
wit, 
towards 
the 
extremities 
of 
the 
arm, 
whereby 
it 
may 
come 
thither 
by 
the 
arteries, 
he 
also 
proves 
very 
well 
what 
he 
sayes 
of 
the 
course 
of 
the 
bloud 
through 
certain 
little 
skins, 
which 
are 
so 
disposed 
in 
divers 
places 
along 
the 
veins, 
which 
permit 
it 
not 
to 
pass 
from 
the 
middle 
towards 
the 
extremities, 
but 
onely 
to 
return 
from 
the 
extremities 
towards 
the 
heart. 
And 
besides 
this, 
experience 
shews, 
That 
all 
the 
bloud 
which 
is 
in 
the 
body 
may 
in 
a 
very 
little 
time 
run 
out 
by 
one 
onely 
artery’s 
being 
cut, 
although 
it 
were 
even 
bound 
very 
neer 
the 
heart, 
and 
cut 
betwixt 
it 
and 
the 
ligature: 
So 
that 
we 
could 
have 
no 
reason 
to 
imagine 
that 
the 
bloud 
which 
issued 
thence 
[84]could 
come 
from 
any 
other 
part. 


But 
there 
are 
divers 
other 
things 
which 
witness, 
that 
the 
true 
cause 
of 
this 
motion 
of 
the 
bloud 
is 
that 
which 
I 
have 
related. 
As 
first, 
The 
difference 
observed 
between 
that 
which 
issues 
out 
of 
the 
veins, 
and 
that 
which 
comes 
out 
of 
the 
arteries, 
cannot 
proceed 
but 
from 
its 
being 
rarified 
and 
(as 
it 
were) 
distilled 
by 
passing 
thorow 
the 
heart: 
its 
more 
subtil, 
more 
lively, 
and 
more 
hot 
presently 
after 
it 
comes 
out; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
being 
in 
the 
arteries, 
then 
it 
is 
a 
little 
before 
it 
enters 
them, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
in 
the 
veins. 
And 
if 
you 
observe, 
you 
will 
finde, 
that 
this 
difference 
appears 
not 
well 
but 
about 
the 
heart; 
and 
not 
so 
much 
in 
those 
places 
which 
are 
farther 
off. 
Next, 
the 
hardnesse 
of 
the 
skin 
of 
which 
the 
artery 
vein 
and 
the 
great 
artery 
are 
composed, 
sheweth 
sufficiently, 
that 
the 
bloud 
beats 
against 
them 
more 
forcibly 
then 
against 
the 
veins. 
And 
why 
should 
the 
left 
concavity 
of 
the 
heart, 
and 
the 
[85]great 
artery 
be 
more 
large 
and 
ample 
then 
the 
right 
concavity, 
and 
the 
arterious 
vein; 
unless 
it 
were 
that 
the 
bloud 
of 
the 
veinous 
artery, 
having 
bin 
but 
onely 
in 
the 
lungs 
since 
its 
passage 
thorow 
the 
heart, 
is 
more 
subtil, 
and 
is 
rarified 
with 
more 
force 
and 
ease 
then 
the 
bloud 
which 
immediately 
comes 
from 
the 
vena 
cava. 
And 
what 
can 
the 
Physicians 
divine 
by 
feeling 
of 
the 
pulse, 
unlesse 
they 
know, 
that 
according 
as 
the 
bloud 
changeth 
its 
nature, 
it 
may 
by 
the 
heat 
of 
the 
heart 
be 
rarified 
to 
be 
more 
or 
lesse 
strong, 
and 
more 
or 
lesse 
quick 
then 
before. 
And 
if 
we 
examine 
how 
this 
heat 
is 
communicated 
to 
the 
other 
members, 
must 
we 
not 
avow 
that 
’tis 
by 
means 
of 
the 
bloud, 
which 
passing 
the 
heart, 
reheats 
it 
self 
there, 
and 
thence 
disperseth 
it 
self 
thorow 
the 
whole 
body: 
whence 
it 
happens, 
that 
if 
you 
take 
away 
the 
bloud 
from 
any 
part, 
the 
heat 
by 
the 
same 
means 
also 
is 
taken 
a 
way. 
And 
although 
the 
heart 
were 
as 
burning 
as 
hot 
iron, 
it 
[86]were 
not 
sufficient 
to 
warm 
the 
feet 
and 
the 
hands 



so 
often 
as 
it 
doth, 
did 
it 
not 
continue 
to 
furnish 
them 
with 
new 
bloud. 


Besides, 
from 
thence 
we 
know 
also 
that 
the 
true 
use 
of 
respiration 
is 
to 
bring 
fresh 
air 
enough 
to 
the 
lungs, 
to 
cause 
that 
bloud 
which 
comes 
from 
the 
right 
concavity 
of 
the 
heart, 
where 
it 
was 
rarified, 
and 
(as 
it 
were) 
chang’d 
into 
vapours, 
there 
to 
thicken, 
and 
convert 
it 
self 
into 
bloud 
again, 
before 
it 
fall 
again 
into 
the 
left, 
without 
which 
it 
would 
not 
be 
fit 
to 
serve 
for 
the 
nourishment 
of 
the 
fire 
which 
is 
there. 
Which 
is 
confirm’d, 
for 
that 
its 
seen, 
that 
animals 
which 
have 
no 
lungs 
have 
but 
one 
onely 
concavity 
in 
the 
heart; 
and 
that 
children, 
who 
can 
make 
no 
use 
of 
them 
when 
they 
are 
in 
their 
mothers 
bellies, 
have 
an 
opening, 
by 
which 
the 
bloud 
of 
the 
vena 
cava 
runs 
to 
the 
left 
concavity 
of 
the 
heart, 
and 
a 
conduit 
by 
which 
it 
comes 
from 
the 
arterious 
vein 
into 
the 
great 
artery 
without 
[87]passing 
the 
lungs. 


Next, 
How 
would 
the 
concoction 
be 
made 
in 
the 
stomach, 
unlesse 
the 
heart 
sent 
heat 
by 
the 
arteries, 
and 
therewithall 
some 
of 
the 
most 
fluid 
parts 
of 
the 
bloud, 
which 
help 
to 
dissolve 
the 
meat 
receiv’d 
therein? 
and 
is 
not 
the 
act 
which 
converts 
the 
juice 
of 
these 
meats 
into 
bloud 
easie 
to 
be 
known, 
if 
we 
consider, 
that 
it 
is 
distill’d 
by 
passing 
and 
repassing 
the 
heart, 
perhaps 
more 
then 
one 
or 
two 
hundred 
times 
a 
day? 
And 
what 
need 
we 
ought 
else 
to 
explain 
the 
nutrition 
and 
the 
production 
of 
divers 
humours 
which 
are 
in 
the 
body, 
but 
to 
say, 
that 
the 
force 
wherewith 
the 
bloud 
in 
rarifying 
it 
self, 
passeth 
from 
the 
heart 
towards 
the 
extremities 
or 
the 
arteries, 
causeth 
some 
of 
its 
parts 
to 
stay 
amongst 
those 
of 
the 
members 
where 
they 
are, 
and 
there 
take 
the 
place 
of 
some 
others, 
which 
they 
drive 
from 
thence? 
And 
that 
according 
to 
the 
situation, 
or 
the 
figure, 
or 
the 
smalnesse 
of 
the 
pores 
which 
they 
[88]meet, 
some 
arrive 
sooner 
in 
one 
place 
then 
others. 
In 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
we 
may 
have 
seen 
in 
severall 
sieves, 
which 
being 
diversly 
pierc’d, 
serve 
to 
sever 
divers 
grains 
one 
from 
the 
other. 
And 
briefly, 
that 
which 
is 
most 
remarkable 
herein, 
is 
the 
generation 
of 
the 
animal 
spirits, 
which 
are 
as 
a 
most 
subtil 
wind, 
or 
rather, 
as 
a 
most 
pure 
and 
lively 
flame, 
which 
continually 
rising 
in 
great 
abundance 
from 
the 
heart 
to 
the 
brain, 
dischargeth 
it 
self 
thence 
by 
the 
nerves 
into 
the 
muscles, 
and 
gives 
motion 
to 
all 
the 
members; 
without 
imagining 
any 
other 
reason 
which 
might 
cause 
these 
parts 
of 
the 
bloud, 
which 
being 
most 
mov’d, 
and 
the 
most 
penetrating, 
are 
the 
most 
fit 
to 
form 
these 
spirits, 
tend 
rather 
towards 
the 
brain, 
then 
to 
any 
other 
part. 
Save 
onely 
that 
the 
arteries 
which 
carry 
them 
thither, 
are 
those 
which 
come 
from 
the 
heart 
in 
the 
most 
direct 
line 
of 
all: 
And 
that 
according 
to 
the 
rules 
of 



the 
Mechanicks, 
which 
are 
the 
same 
with 
those 
[89]of 
Nature, 
when 
divers 
things 
together 
strive 
to 
move 
one 
way, 
where 
there 
is 
not 
room 
enough 
for 
all; 
so 
those 
parts 
of 
bloud 
which 
issue 
from 
the 
left 
concavity 
of 
the 
heart 
tend 
towards 
the 
brain, 
the 
weaker 
and 
less 
agitated 
are 
expell’d 
by 
the 
stronger, 
who 
by 
that 
means 
arrive 
there 
alone. 


I 
had 
particularly 
enough 
expounded 
all 
these 
things 
in 
a 
Treatise 
which 
I 
formerly 
had 
design’d 
to 
publish: 
In 
pursuit 
whereof, 
I 
had 
therein 
shewed 
what 
ought 
to 
be 
the 
fabrick 
of 
the 
nerves 
and 
muscles 
of 
an 
humane 
body, 
to 
cause 
those 
animall 
spirits 
which 
were 
in 
them, 
to 
have 
the 
power 
to 
move 
those 
members. 
As 
we 
see 
that 
heads 
a 
while 
after 
they 
are 
cut 
off, 
yet 
move 
of 
themselves, 
and 
bite 
the 
ground, 
although 
they 
are 
not 
then 
animated. 
What 
changes 
ought 
to 
be 
made 
in 
the 
brain 
to 
cause 
waking, 
sleeping, 
and 
dreaming: 
how 
light, 
sounds, 
smels, 
tasts, 
heat, 
and 
all 
other 
qualities 
of 
exteriour 
objects, 
might 
imprint 
severall 
[90]Ideas 
by 
means 
of 
the 
senses. 
How 
hunger 
and 
thirst, 
and 
the 
other 
interiour 
passions 
might 
also 
send 
theirs 
thither. 
What 
ought 
to 
be 
taken 
therein 
for 
common 
sense, 
where 
these 
Ideas 
are 
received; 
for 
memory 
which 
preserves 
them; 
and 
for 
fancy, 
which 
can 
diversly 
change 
them, 
and 
form 
new 
ones 
of 
them; 
and 
by 
the 
same 
means, 
distributing 
the 
animal 
spirits 
into 
the 
muscles, 
make 
the 
members 
of 
the 
body 
move 
in 
so 
many 
severall 
fashions, 
and 
as 
fitly 
to 
those 
objects 
which 
present 
themselves 
to 
its 
senses; 
and 
to 
the 
interiour 
passions 
which 
are 
in 
them, 
as 
ours 
may 
move 
themselves 
without 
the 
consent 
of 
the 
Wil. 
Which 
wil 
seem 
nothing 
strange 
to 
those, 
who 
knowing 
how 
many 
Automatas 
or 
moving 
Machines 
the 
industry 
of 
men 
can 
make, 
imploying 
but 
very 
few 
pieces, 
in 
comparison 
of 
the 
great 
abundance 
of 
bones, 
muscles, 
nerves, 
arteries, 
veins, 
and 
all 
the 
other 
parts 
which 
are 
in 
the 
body 
of 
every 
Animal, 
will 
consider 
[91]this 
body 
as 
a 
fabrick, 
which 
having 
been 
made 
by 
the 
hands 
of 
God, 
is 
incomparably 
better 
ordered, 
and 
hath 
more 
admirable 
motions 
in 
it 
then 
any 
of 
those 
which 
can 
be 
invented 
by 
men. 
And 
herein 
I 
particularly 
insisted, 
to 
make 
it 
appear, 
that 
if 
there 
were 
such 
Machines 
which 
had 
organs, 
and 
the 
exteriour 
figure 
of 
an 
Ape, 
or 
of 
any 
other 
unreasonable 
creature, 
we 
should 
finde 
no 
means 
of 
knowing 
them 
not 
to 
be 
altogether 
of 
the 
same 
nature 
as 
those 
Animals: 
whereas, 
if 
there 
were 
any 
which 
resembled 
our 
bodies, 
and 
imitated 
our 
actions 
as 
much 
as 
morally 
it 
were 
possible, 
we 
should 
always 
have 
two 
most 
certain 
ways 
to 
know, 
that 
for 
all 
that 
they 
were 
not 
reall 
men: 
The 
first 
of 
which 
is, 
that 
they 
could 
never 
have 
the 
use 
of 
speech, 
nor 
of 
other 
signes 
in 
framing 
it, 
as 
we 



have, 
to 
declare 
our 
thoughts 
to 
others: 
for 
we 
may 
well 
conceive, 
that 
a 
Machine 
may 
be 
so 
made, 
that 
it 
may 
utter 
words, 
and 
even 
some 
proper 
to 
the 
[92]corporal 
actions, 
which 
may 
cause 
some 
change 
in 
its 
organs; 
as 
if 
we 
touch 
it 
in 
some 
part, 
and 
it 
should 
ask 
what 
we 
would 
say; 
or 
so 
as 
it 
might 
cry 
out 
that 
one 
hurts 
it, 
and 
the 
like: 
but 
not 
that 
they 
can 
diversifie 
them 
to 
answer 
sensibly 
to 
all 
what 
shall 
be 
spoken 
in 
its 
presence, 
as 
the 
dullest 
men 
may 
do. 
And 
the 
second 
is, 
That 
although 
they 
did 
divers 
things 
aswel, 
or 
perhaps 
better, 
then 
any 
of 
us, 
they 
must 
infallibly 
fail 
in 
some 
others, 
whereby 
we 
might 
discover 
that 
they 
act 
not 
with 
knowledge, 
but 
onely 
by 
the 
disposition 
of 
their 
organs: 
for 
whereas 
Reason 
is 
an 
universal 
instrument 
which 
may 
serve 
in 
all 
kinde 
of 
encounters, 
these 
organs 
have 
need 
of 
some 
particular 
disposition 
for 
every 
particular 
action: 
whence 
it 
is, 
that 
its 
morally 
impossible 
for 
one 
Machine 
to 
have 
severall 
organs 
enough 
to 
make 
it 
move 
in 
all 
the 
occurrences 
of 
this 
life, 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
our 
Reason 
makes 
us 
move. 
Now 
by 
these 
two 
means 
[93]we 
may 
also 
know 
the 
difference 
which 
is 
between 
Men 
and 
Beasts: 
For 
’tis 
a 
very 
remarkable 
thing, 
that 
there 
are 
no 
men 
so 
dull 
and 
so 
stupid, 
without 
excepting 
those 
who 
are 
out 
of 
their 
wits, 
but 
are 
capable 
to 
rank 
severall 
words 
together, 
and 
of 
them 
to 
compose 
a 
Discourse, 
by 
which 
they 
make 
known 
their 
thoughts: 
and 
that 
on 
the 
contrary, 
there 
is 
no 
other 
creature, 
how 
perfect 
or 
happily 
soever 
brought 
forth, 
which 
can 
do 
the 
like. 
The 
which 
happens, 
not 
because 
they 
want 
organs; 
for 
we 
know, 
that 
Pyes 
and 
Parrots 
can 
utter 
words 
even 
as 
we 
can, 
and 
yet 
cannot 
speak 
like 
us; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
with 
evidence 
that 
they 
think 
what 
they 
say. 
Whereas 
Men, 
being 
born 
deaf 
and 
dumb, 
and 
deprived 
of 
those 
organs 
which 
seem 
to 
make 
others 
speak, 
as 
much 
or 
more 
then 
beasts, 
usually 
invent 
of 
themselves 
to 
be 
understood 
by 
those, 
who 
commonly 
being 
with 
them, 
have 
the 
leisure 
to 
learn 
their 
expressions. 
[94]And 
this 
not 
onely 
witnesseth, 
that 
Beasts 
have 
lesse 
reason 
than 
men, 
but 
that 
they 
have 
none 
at 
all. 
For 
we 
see 
there 
needs 
not 
much 
to 
learn 
to 
speak: 
and 
forasmuch 
as 
we 
observe 
inequality 
amongst 
Beasts 
of 
the 
same 
kind, 
aswell 
as 
amongst 
men, 
and 
that 
some 
are 
more 
easily 
managed 
then 
others; 
’tis 
not 
to 
be 
believed, 
but 
that 
an 
Ape 
or 
a 
Parrot 
which 
were 
the 
most 
perfect 
of 
its 
kinde, 
should 
therein 
equall 
the 
most 
stupid 
child, 
or 
at 
least 
a 
child 
of 
a 
distracted 
brain, 
if 
their 
souls 
were 
not 
of 
a 
nature 
wholly 
different 
from 
ours. 
And 
we 
ought 
not 
to 
confound 
words 
with 
naturall 
motions, 
which 
witness 
passions, 
and 
may 
be 
imitated 
by 
Machines 
aswell 
as 
by 
Animals; 
nor 
think 
(as 
some 
of 
the 
Ancients) 
that 
beasts 
speak, 
although 
we 
do 
not 
understand 
their 
language: 



for 
if 
it 
were 
true, 
since 
they 
have 
divers 
organs 
which 
relate 
to 
ours, 
they 
could 
aswell 
make 
themselves 
understood 
by 
us, 
as 
by 
their 
like. 
Its 
likewise 
very 
[95]remarkable 
that 
although 
there 
are 
divers 
creatures 
which 
express 
more 
industry 
then 
we 
in 
some 
one 
of 
their 
actions; 
yet 
we 
may 
well 
perceive, 
that 
the 
same 
shew 
none 
at 
all 
in 
many 
others: 
So 
that 
what 
they 
do 
better 
then 
we, 
proves 
not 
at 
all 
that 
they 
have 
reason; 
for 
by 
that 
reckoning 
they 
would 
have 
more 
then 
any 
of 
us, 
and 
would 
do 
better 
in 
all 
other 
things; 
but 
rather, 
that 
they 
have 
none 
at 
all, 
and 
that 
its 
Nature 
onely 
which 
works 
in 
them 
according 
to 
the 
disposition 
of 
their 
organs. 
As 
wee 
see 
a 
Clock, 
which 
is 
onely 
composed 
of 
wheels 
and 
springs, 
can 
reckon 
the 
hours, 
and 
measure 
the 
times 
more 
exactly 
then 
we 
can 
with 
all 
our 
prudence. 


After 
this 
I 
had 
described 
the 
reasonable 
Soul, 
and 
made 
it 
appear, 
that 
it 
could 
no 
way 
be 
drawn 
from 
the 
power 
of 
the 
Matter, 
as 
other 
things 
whereof 
I 
had 
spoken; 
but 
that 
it 
ought 
to 
have 
been 
expresly 
created: 
And 
how 
it 
suffiseth 
not 
for 
it 
to 
be 
[96]lodg’d 
in 
our 
humane 
body 
as 
a 
Pilot 
in 
his 
ship, 
to 
move 
its 
members 
onely; 
but 
also 
that 
its 
necessary 
it 
be 
joyned 
and 
united 
more 
strongly 
therewith 
to 
have 
thoughts 
and 
appetites 
like 
ours, 
and 
so 
make 
a 
reall 
man. 


I 
have 
here 
dilated 
my 
self 
a 
little 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
Soul, 
by 
reason 
’tis 
of 
most 
importance; 
for, 
next 
the 
errour 
of 
those 
who 
deny 
God, 
which 
I 
think 
I 
have 
already 
sufficiently 
confuted, 
there 
is 
none 
which 
sooner 
estrangeth 
feeble 
minds 
from 
the 
right 
way 
of 
vertue, 
then 
to 
imagine 
that 
the 
soul 
of 
beasts 
is 
of 
the 
same 
nature 
as 
ours, 
and 
that 
consequently 
we 
have 
nothing 
to 
fear 
nor 
hope 
after 
this 
life, 
no 
more 
then 
flies 
or 
ants. 
Whereas, 
when 
we 
know 
how 
different 
they 
are, 
we 
comprehend 
much 
better 
the 
reasons 
which 
prove 
that 
ours 
is 
of 
a 
nature 
wholly 
independing 
from 
the 
body, 
and 
consequently 
that 
it 
is 
not 
subject 
to 
die 
with 
it. 
And 
that 
when 
we 
see 
no 
[97]other 
cause 
which 
destroys 
it, 
we 
are 
naturally 
thence 
moved 
to 
judge 
that 
it’s 
immortall. 


PART. 
VI. 


Its 
now 
three 
years 
since 
I 
ended 
the 
Treatise 
which 
contains 
all 
these 
things, 
and 
that 
I 
began 
to 
review 
it, 
to 
send 
it 
afterwards 
to 
the 
Presse, 
when 
I 
understood, 
that 
persons 
to 
whom 
I 
submit, 
and 
whose 
authority 
can 
no 
lesse 



command 
my 
actions, 
then 
my 
own 
Reason 
doth 
my 
thoughts, 
had 
disapproved 
an 
opinion 
in 
Physicks, 
published 
a 
little 
before 
by 
another; 
of 
which 
I 
will 
not 
say 
that 
I 
was, 
but 
that 
indeed 
I 
had 
observed 
nothing 
therein, 
before 
their 
censure, 
which 
I 
could 
have 
imagined 
prejudiciall 
either 
to 
Religion 
or 
the 
State; 
or 
consequently, 
[98]which 
might 
have 
hindred 
me 
from 
writing 
the 
same, 
had 
my 
Reason 
perswaded 
mee 
thereto. 
And 
this 
made 
me 
fear, 
lest 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
there 
might 
be 
found 
some 
one 
amongst 
mine, 
in 
which 
I 
might 
have 
been 
mistaken; 
notwithstanding 
the 
great 
care 
I 
always 
had 
to 
admit 
no 
new 
ones 
into 
my 
belief, 
of 
which 
I 
had 
not 
most 
certain 
demonstrations; 
and 
not 
to 
write 
such 
as 
might 
turn 
to 
the 
disadvantage 
of 
any 
body. 
Which 
was 
sufficient 
to 
oblige 
me 
to 
change 
my 
resolution 
of 
publishing 
them. 
For 
although 
the 
reasons 
for 
which 
I 
had 
first 
of 
all 
taken 
it, 
were 
very 
strong; 
yet 
my 
inclination, 
which 
alwayes 
made 
me 
hate 
the 
trade 
of 
Book-making, 
presently 
found 
me 
out 
others 
enough 
to 
excuse 
my 
self 
from 
it. 
And 
these 
reasons 
on 
the 
one 
and 
other 
side 
are 
such, 
that 
I 
am 
not 
only 
somewhat 
concern’d 
to 
speak 
them; 
but 
happily 
the 
Publick 
also 
to 
know 
them. 


I 
never 
did 
much 
esteem 
those 
[99]things 
which 
proceeded 
from 
mine 
own 
brain; 
and 
so 
long 
as 
I 
have 
gathered 
no 
other 
fruits 
from 
the 
Method 
I 
use, 
but 
onely 
that 
I 
have 
satisfied 
my 
self 
in 
some 
difficulties 
which 
belong 
to 
speculative 
Sciences, 
or 
at 
least 
endeavoured 
to 
regulate 
my 
Manners 
by 
the 
reasons 
it 
taught 
me, 
I 
thought 
my 
self 
not 
obliged 
to 
write 
any 
thing 
of 
them. 
For, 
as 
for 
what 
concerns 
Manners, 
every 
one 
abounds 
so 
much 
in 
his 
own 
sense, 
That 
we 
may 
finde 
as 
many 
Reformers 
as 
heads, 
were 
it 
permitted 
to 
others, 
besides 
those 
whom 
God 
hath 
established 
as 
Soveraigns 
over 
his 
people, 
or 
at 
least, 
to 
whom 
he 
hath 
dispensed 
grace 
and 
zeal 
enough 
to 
be 
Prophets, 
to 
undertake 
the 
change 
of 
any 
thing 
therein. 
And 
although 
my 
Speculations 
did 
very 
much 
please 
me, 
I 
did 
beleeve 
that 
other 
men 
also 
had 
some, 
which 
perhaps 
pleas’d 
them 
more. 
But 
as 
soon 
as 
I 
had 
acquired 
some 
generall 
notions 
touching 
naturall 
Philosophy, 
[100]and 
beginning 
to 
prove 
them 
in 
divers 
particular 
difficulties, 
I 
observed 
how 
far 
they 
might 
lead 
a 
man, 
and 
how 
far 
different 
they 
were 
from 
the 
principles 
which 
to 
this 
day 
are 
in 
use; 
I 
judg’d, 
that 
I 
could 
not 
keep 
them 
hid 
without 
highly 
sinning 
against 
the 
Law, 
which 
obligeth 
us 
to 
procure, 
as 
much 
as 
in 
us 
lies, 
the 
general 
good 
of 
all 
men. 
For 
they 
made 
it 
appear 
to 
me, 
that 
it 
was 
possible 
to 
attain 
to 
points 
of 
knowledge, 
which 
may 
be 
very 
profitable 
for 
this 
life: 
and 
that 
in 
stead 
of 
this 
speculative 
Philosophy 
which 
is 
taught 
in 
the 
Schools, 
we 



might 
finde 
out 
a 
practicall 
one, 
by 
which 
knowing 
the 
force 
and 
workings 
of 
Fire, 
Water, 
Air, 
of 
the 
Starrs, 
of 
the 
Heavens, 
and 
of 
all 
other 
Bodies 
which 
environ 
us, 
distinctly, 
as 
we 
know 
the 
several 
trades 
of 
our 
Handicrafts, 
we 
might 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
employ 
them 
to 
all 
uses 
to 
which 
they 
are 
fit, 
and 
so 
become 
masters 
and 
possessours 
of 
Nature. 
Which 
is 
not 
onely 
to 
be 
desired 
for 
[101]the 
invention 
of 
very 
many 
expedients 
of 
Arts, 
which 
without 
trouble 
might 
make 
us 
enjoy 
the 
fruits 
of 
the 
earth, 
and 
all 
the 
conveniences 
which 
are 
to 
be 
found 
therein: 
But 
chiefly 
also 
for 
the 
preservation 
of 
health, 
which 
(without 
doubt) 
is 
the 
first 
good, 
and 
the 
foundation 
of 
all 
other 
good 
things 
in 
this 
life. 
For 
even 
the 
minde 
depends 
so 
much 
on 
the 
temper 
and 
disposition 
of 
the 
organs 
of 
the 
body, 
that 
if 
it 
be 
possible 
to 
finde 
any 
way 
of 
making 
men 
in 
the 
generall 
wiser, 
and 
more 
able 
then 
formerly 
they 
were, 
I 
beleeve 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
sought 
in 
Physick. 
True 
it 
is, 
that 
which 
is 
now 
in 
use 
contains 
but 
few 
things, 
whose 
benefit 
is 
very 
remarkable: 
But 
(without 
any 
designe 
of 
slighting 
of 
it) 
I 
assure 
my 
self, 
there 
is 
none, 
even 
of 
their 
own 
profession, 
but 
will 
consent, 
that 
whatsoever 
is 
known 
therein, 
is 
almost 
nothing 
in 
companion 
of 
what 
remains 
to 
be 
known. 
And 
that 
we 
might 
be 
freed 
from 
very 
many 
diseases, 
aswell 
[102]of 
the 
body 
as 
of 
the 
mind, 
and 
even 
also 
perhaps 
from 
the 
weaknesses 
of 
old 
age, 
had 
we 
but 
knowledge 
enough 
of 
their 
Causes, 
and 
of 
all 
the 
Remedies 
wherewith 
Nature 
hath 
furnished 
us. 
Now 
having 
a 
designe 
to 
employ 
all 
my 
life 
in 
the 
enquiry 
of 
so 
necessary 
a 
Science; 
and 
having 
found 
a 
way, 
the 
following 
of 
which 
me 
thinks 
might 
infallibly 
lead 
us 
to 
it, 
unless 
we 
be 
hindred 
by 
the 
shortness 
of 
lifes, 
or 
by 
defect 
of 
experiments. 
I 
judg’d 
that 
there 
was 
no 
better 
Remedie 
against 
those 
two 
impediments, 
but 
faithfully 
to 
communicate 
to 
the 
publique, 
all 
that 
little 
I 
should 
discover, 
and 
to 
invite 
all 
good 
Wits 
to 
endevour 
to 
advance 
farther 
in 
contributing 
every 
one, 
according 
to 
his 
inclination 
and 
power, 
to 
those 
Experiments 
which 
are 
to 
be 
made, 
and 
communicating 
also 
to 
the 
publique 
all 
the 
things 
they 
should 
learn; 
so 
that 
the 
last, 
beginning 
where 
the 
precedent 
ended, 
and 
so 
joyning 
the 
lives 
and 
labors 
of 
many 
in 
one, 
we 
[103]might 
all 
together 
advance 
further 
then 
any 
particular 
Man 
could 
do. 


I 
also 
observ’d 
touching 
Experiments, 
that 
they 
are 
still 
so 
much 
the 
more 
necessary, 
as 
we 
are 
more 
advanc’d 
in 
knowledg. 
For 
in 
the 
beginning 
it’s 
better 
to 
use 
those 
only 
which 
of 
themselves 
are 
presented 
to 
our 
senses, 
and 
which 
we 
cannot 
be 
ignorant 
of, 
if 
we 
do 
but 
make 
the 
least 
reflections 
upon 
them, 
then 
to 
seek 
out 
the 
rarest 
and 
most 
studied 
ones. 
The 
reason 
whereof 



is, 
that 
those 
which 
are 
rarest, 
doe 
often 
deceive, 
when 
we 
seldome 
know 
the 
same 
of 
the 
most 
common 
ones, 
and 
that 
the 
circumstances 
on 
which 
they 
depend, 
are, 
as 
it 
were, 
always 
so 
particular, 
and 
so 
small, 
that 
it’s 
very 
uneasie 
to 
finde 
them 
out. 
But 
the 
order 
I 
observed 
herein 
was 
this. 
First, 
I 
endevoured 
to 
finde 
in 
generall 
the 
Principles 
or 
first 
Causes 
of 
whatsoever 
is 
or 
may 
be 
in 
the 
world, 
without 
considering 
any 
thing 
for 
this 
end, 
but 
God 
alone 
who 
created 
it, 
or 
[104]drawing 
them 
elsewhere, 
then 
from 
certain 
seeds 
of 
Truth 
which 
naturally 
are 
in 
our 
souls. 
After 
this, 
I 
examined 
what 
were 
the 
first 
and 
most 
ordinary 
Effects 
which 
might 
be 
deduced 
from 
these 
Causes: 
And 
me 
thinks 
that 
thereby 
I 
found 
out 
Heavens, 
Starrs, 
an 
Earth; 
and 
even 
on 
the 
Earth, 
Water, 
Air 
and 
Fire, 
Minerals, 
and 
some 
other 
such 
like 
things, 
which 
are 
the 
most 
common, 
and 
the 
most 
simple 
of 
all, 
and 
consequently 
the 
most 
easie 
to 
be 
understood. 
Afterwards, 
when 
I 
would 
descend 
to 
those 
which 
were 
more 
particular, 
there 
were 
so 
many 
severall 
ones 
presented 
themselves 
to 
me, 
that 
I 
did 
beleeve 
it 
impossible 
for 
a 
humane 
understanding 
to 
distinguish 
the 
forms 
and 
species 
of 
Bodies 
which 
are 
on 
the 
earth, 
from 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
others 
which 
might 
be 
there, 
had 
it 
been 
the 
will 
of 
God 
so 
to 
place 
them: 
Nor 
by 
consequence 
to 
apply 
them 
to 
our 
use, 
unless 
we 
set 
the 
Effects 
before 
the 
Causes, 
and 
[105]make 
use 
of 
divers 
particular 
experiments; 
In 
relation 
to 
which, 
revolving 
in 
my 
minde 
all 
those 
objects 
which 
ever 
were 
presented 
to 
my 
senses, 
I 
dare 
boldly 
say, 
I 
observed 
nothing 
which 
I 
could 
not 
fitly 
enough 
explain 
by 
the 
principles 
I 
had 
found. 
But 
I 
must 
also 
confesse 
that 
the 
power 
of 
Nature 
is 
so 
ample 
and 
vast, 
and 
these 
principles 
are 
so 
simple 
and 
generall, 
that 
I 
can 
observe 
almost 
no 
particular 
Effect, 
but 
that 
I 
presently 
know 
it 
might 
be 
deduced 
from 
thence 
in 
many 
severall 
ways: 
and 
that 
commonly 
my 
greatest 
difficulty 
is 
to 
finde 
in 
which 
of 
these 
ways 
it 
depends 
thereon; 
for 
I 
know 
no 
other 
expedient 
for 
that, 
but 
again 
to 
seek 
some 
experiments, 
which 
may 
be 
such, 
that 
their 
event 
may 
not 
be 
the 
same, 
if 
it 
be 
in 
one 
of 
those 
ways 
which 
is 
to 
be 
exprest, 
as 
if 
it 
were 
in 
another. 
In 
fine, 
I 
am 
gotten 
so 
far, 
That 
(me 
thinks) 
I 
see 
well 
enough 
what 
course 
we 
ought 
to 
hold 
to 
make 
the 
most 
part 
of 
those 
experiments 
[106]which 
may 
tend 
to 
this 
effect. 
But 
I 
also 
see 
they 
are 
such, 
and 
of 
so 
great 
a 
number, 
that 
neither 
my 
hands 
nor 
my 
estate 
(though 
I 
had 
a 
thousand 
times 
more 
then 
I 
have) 
could 
ever 
suffice 
for 
all. 
So 
that 
according 
as 
I 
shall 
hereafter 
have 
conveniency 
to 
make 
more 
or 
fewer 
of 
them, 
I 
shall 
also 
advance 
more 
or 
lesse 
in 
the 
knowledge 
of 
Nature, 
which 
I 
hop’d 
I 
should 
make 
known 
by 
the 
Treatise 
which 
I 
had 
written; 
and 
therein 



so 
clearly 
shew 
the 
benefit 
which 
the 
Publick 
may 
receive 
thereby, 
that 
I 
should 
oblige 
all 
those 
in 
general 
who 
desire 
the 
good 
of 
Mankinde; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
all 
those 
who 
are 
indeed 
vertuous, 
(and 
not 
so 
seemingly, 
or 
by 
opinion 
only) 
aswell 
to 
communicate 
such 
experiments 
as 
they 
have 
already 
made, 
as 
to 
help 
me 
in 
the 
enquiry 
of 
those 
which 
are 
to 
be 
made. 


But 
since 
that 
time, 
other 
reasons 
have 
made 
me 
alter 
my 
opinion, 
and 
think 
that 
I 
truly 
ought 
to 
continue 
[107]to 
write 
of 
all 
those 
things 
which 
I 
judg’d 
of 
any 
importance, 
according 
as 
I 
should 
discover 
the 
truth 
of 
them, 
and 
take 
the 
same 
care, 
as 
if 
I 
were 
to 
print 
them; 
as 
well 
that 
I 
might 
have 
so 
much 
the 
more 
occasion 
throughly 
to 
examine 
them; 
as 
without 
doubt, 
we 
always 
look 
more 
narrowly 
to 
what 
we 
offer 
to 
the 
publick 
view, 
then 
to 
what 
we 
compose 
onely 
for 
our 
own 
use: 
and 
oftentimes 
the 
same 
things 
which 
seemed 
true 
to 
me 
when 
I 
first 
conceived 
them, 
appear’d 
afterwards 
false 
to 
me, 
when 
I 
was 
committing 
them 
to 
paper: 
as 
also 
that 
I 
might 
lose 
no 
occasion 
of 
benefiting 
the 
Publick, 
if 
I 
were 
able, 
and 
that 
if 
my 
Writings 
were 
of 
any 
value, 
those 
to 
whose 
hands 
they 
should 
come 
after 
my 
death, 
might 
to 
make 
what 
use 
of 
them 
they 
think 
fit. 


But 
that 
I 
ought 
not 
any 
wayes 
to 
consent 
that 
they 
should 
be 
published 
during 
my 
life; 
That 
neither 
the 
opposition 
and 
controversies, 
whereto 
[108]perhaps 
they 
might 
be 
obnoxious, 
nor 
even 
the 
reputation 
whatsoever 
it 
were, 
which 
they 
might 
acquire 
me, 
might 
give 
me 
any 
occasion 
of 
mispending 
the 
time 
I 
had 
design’d 
to 
employ 
for 
my 
instruction; 
for 
although 
it 
be 
true 
that 
every 
Man 
is 
oblig’d 
to 
procure, 
as 
much 
as 
in 
him 
lies, 
the 
good 
of 
others; 
and 
that 
to 
be 
profitable 
to 
no 
body, 
is 
properly 
to 
be 
good 
for 
nothing: 
Yet 
it’s 
as 
true, 
that 
our 
care 
ought 
to 
reach 
beyond 
the 
present 
time; 
and 
that 
it 
were 
good 
to 
omit 
those 
things 
which 
might 
perhaps 
conduce 
to 
the 
benefit 
of 
those 
who 
are 
alive, 
when 
our 
designe 
is, 
to 
doe 
others 
which 
shall 
prove 
farr 
more 
advantagious 
to 
our 
posterity; 
As 
indeed 
I 
desire 
it 
may 
be 
known 
that 
the 
little 
I 
have 
learnt 
hitherto, 
is 
almost 
nothing 
in 
comparison 
of 
what 
I 
am 
ignorant 
of; 
and 
I 
doe 
not 
despair 
to 
be 
able 
to 
learn: 
For 
it’s 
even 
the 
same 
with 
those, 
who 
by 
little 
and 
little 
discover 
the 
truth 
in 
Learning; 
as 
with 
those 
who 
beginning 
[109]to 
grow 
rich, 
are 
less 
troubled 
to 
make 
great 
purchases, 
then 
they 
were 
before 
when 
they 
were 
poorer, 
to 
make 
little 
ones. 
Or 
else 
one 
may 
compare 
them 
to 
Generals 
of 
Armies, 
whose 
Forces 
usually 
encrease 
porportionably 
to 
their 
Victories; 
and 
who 
have 
need 
of 
more 
conduct 
to 
maintain 
themselves 
after 
the 
loss 
of 
a 



battail, 
then 
after 
the 
gaining 
one, 
to 
take 
Towns 
and 
Provinces. 
For 
to 
endeavour 
to 
overcome 
all 
the 
difficulties 
and 
errours 
which 
hinder 
us 
to 
come 
to 
the 
knowledg 
of 
the 
Truth, 
is 
truly 
to 
fight 
battails. 
And 
to 
receive 
any 
false 
opinion 
touching 
a 
generall 
or 
weighty 
matter, 
is 
as 
much 
as 
to 
lose 
one; 
there 
is 
far 
more 
dexterity 
required 
to 
recover 
our 
former 
condition, 
then 
to 
make 
great 
progresses 
where 
our 
Principles 
are 
already 
certain. 
For 
my 
part, 
if 
I 
formerly 
have 
discovered 
some 
Truths 
in 
Learning, 
as 
I 
hope 
my 
Discourse 
will 
make 
it 
appear 
I 
have, 
I 
may 
say, 
they 
are 
but 
[110]the 
products 
and 
dependances 
of 
five 
or 
six 
principall 
difficulties 
which 
I 
have 
overcome, 
and 
which 
I 
reckon 
for 
so 
many 
won 
Battails 
on 
my 
side. 
Neither 
will 
I 
forbear 
to 
say; 
That 
I 
think, 
It’s 
only 
necessary 
for 
me 
to 
win 
two 
or 
three 
more 
such, 
wholly 
to 
perfect 
my 
design. 
And 
that 
I 
am 
not 
so 
old, 
but 
according 
to 
the 
ordinary 
course 
of 
Nature, 
I 
may 
have 
time 
enough 
to 
effect 
it. 
But 
I 
beleeve 
I 
am 
so 
much 
the 
more 
obliged 
to 
husband 
the 
rest 
of 
my 
time, 
as 
I 
have 
more 
hopes 
to 
employ 
it 
well; 
without 
doubt, 
I 
should 
have 
divers 
occasions 
of 
impeding 
it, 
should 
I 
publish 
the 
grounds 
of 
my 
Physicks. 
For 
although 
they 
are 
almost 
all 
so 
evident, 
that 
to 
beleeve 
them, 
it’s 
needfull 
onely 
to 
understand 
them; 
and 
that 
there 
is 
none 
whereof 
I 
think 
my 
self 
unable 
to 
give 
demonstration. 
Yet 
because 
it’s 
impossible 
that 
they 
should 
agree 
with 
all 
the 
severall 
opinions 
of 
other 
men, 
I 
foresee 
I 
should 
often 
be 
diverted 
by 
[111]the 
opposition 
they 
would 
occasion. 


It 
may 
be 
objected, 
These 
oppositions 
might 
be 
profitable, 
as 
well 
to 
make 
me 
know 
my 
faults, 
as 
if 
any 
thing 
of 
mine 
were 
good 
to 
make 
others 
by 
that 
means 
come 
to 
a 
better 
understanding 
thereof; 
and 
as 
many 
may 
see 
more 
then 
one 
man, 
beginning 
from 
this 
time 
to 
make 
use 
of 
my 
grounds, 
they 
might 
also 
help 
me 
with 
their 
invention. 
But 
although 
I 
know 
my 
self 
extremely 
subject 
to 
fail, 
and 
do 
never 
almost 
trust 
my 
first 
thoughts; 
yet 
the 
experience 
I 
have 
of 
the 
objections 
which 
may 
be 
made 
unto 
me, 
hinder 
me 
from 
hoping 
for 
any 
profit 
from 
them; 
For 
I 
have 
often 
tried 
the 
judgments 
as 
well 
of 
those 
whom 
I 
esteem’d 
my 
friends, 
as 
of 
others 
whom 
I 
thought 
indifferent, 
and 
even 
also 
of 
some, 
whose 
malignity 
and 
envie 
did 
sufficiently 
discover 
what 
the 
affection 
of 
my 
friends 
might 
hide. 
But 
it 
seldom 
happened 
that 
any 
thing 
was 
objected 
against 
me, 
which 
I 
had 
not 
altogether 
foreseen, 
[112]unless 
it 
were 
very 
remote 
from 
my 
Subject: 
So 
that 
I 
never 
almost 
met 
with 
any 
Censurer 
of 
my 
opinions, 
that 
seemed 
unto 
me 
either 
less 
rigorous, 
or 
less 
equitable 
then 
my 
self. 
Neither 
did 
I 
ever 
observe, 
that 
by 
the 
disputations 
practiced 
in 
the 
Schools 
any 
Truth 
which 
was 
formerly 



unknown, 
was 
ever 
discovered. 
For 
whilest 
every 
one 
seeks 
to 
overcome, 
men 
strive 
more 
to 
maintain 
probabilities, 
then 
to 
weigh 
the 
reasons 
on 
both 
sides; 
and 
those 
who 
for 
a 
long 
time 
have 
been 
good 
Advocates, 
are 
not 
therefore 
the 
better 
Judges 
afterwards. 


As 
for 
the 
benefit 
which 
others 
may 
receive 
from 
the 
communication 
of 
my 
thoughts, 
it 
cannot 
also 
be 
very 
great, 
forasmuch 
as 
I 
have 
not 
yet 
perfected 
them, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
add 
many 
things 
thereunto, 
before 
a 
usefull 
application 
can 
be 
made 
of 
them. 
And 
I 
think 
I 
may 
say 
without 
vanity, 
That 
if 
there 
be 
any 
one 
capable 
thereof, 
it 
must 
be 
my 
[113]self, 
rather 
then 
any 
other. 
Not 
but 
that 
there 
may 
be 
divers 
wits 
in 
the 
world 
incomparably 
better 
then 
mine; 
but 
because 
men 
cannot 
so 
well 
conceive 
a 
thing 
and 
make 
it 
their 
own, 
when 
they 
learn 
it 
of 
another, 
as 
when 
they 
invent 
it 
themselves: 
which 
is 
so 
true 
in 
this 
Subject, 
that 
although 
I 
have 
often 
explain’d 
some 
of 
my 
opinions 
to 
very 
understanding 
men, 
and 
who, 
whilest 
I 
spake 
to 
them, 
seem’d 
very 
distinctly 
to 
conceive 
them; 
yet 
when 
they 
repeated 
them, 
I 
observ’d, 
that 
they 
chang’d 
them 
almost 
always 
in 
such 
a 
manner, 
that 
I 
could 
no 
longer 
own 
them 
for 
mine. 
Upon 
which 
occasion, 
I 
shall 
gladly 
here 
desire 
those 
who 
come 
after 
me, 
never 
to 
beleeve 
those 
things 
which 
may 
be 
delivered 
to 
them 
for 
mine, 
when 
I 
have 
not 
published 
them 
my 
self. 
And 
I 
do 
not 
at 
all 
wonder 
at 
the 
extravagancies 
which 
are 
attributed 
to 
all 
those 
ancient 
Philosophers, 
whose 
Writings 
we 
have 
not; 
neither 
do 
I 
[114]thereby 
judge, 
that 
their 
thoughts 
were 
very 
irrationall, 
seeing 
they 
were 
the 
best 
Wits 
of 
their 
time; 
but 
onely 
that 
they 
have 
been 
ill 
convey’d 
to 
us: 
as 
it 
appears 
also, 
that 
never 
any 
of 
their 
followers 
surpass’d 
them. 
And 
I 
assure 
my 
self, 
that 
the 
most 
passionate 
of 
those, 
who 
now 
follow 
Aristotle, 
would 
beleeve 
himself 
happy, 
had 
he 
but 
as 
much 
knowledge 
of 
Nature 
as 
he 
had, 
although 
it 
were 
on 
condition 
that 
he 
never 
might 
have 
more: 
They 
are 
like 
the 
ivie, 
which 
seeks 
to 
climb 
no 
higher 
then 
the 
trees 
which 
support 
it, 
and 
ever 
after 
tends 
downwards 
again 
when 
it 
hath 
attain’d 
to 
the 
height 
thereof: 
for, 
me 
thinks 
also, 
that 
such 
men 
sink 
downwards; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
render 
themselves 
in 
some 
manner 
lesse 
knowing, 
then 
if 
they 
did 
abstain 
from 
studying; 
who 
being 
not 
content 
to 
know 
all 
which 
is 
intelligibly 
set 
down 
in 
their 
Authour, 
will 
besides 
that, 
finde 
out 
the 
solution 
of 
divers 
difficulties 
of 
which 
he 
[115]says 
nothing, 
and 
perhaps 
never 
thought 
of 
them: 
yet 
their 
way 
of 
Philosophy 
is 
very 
fit 
for 
those 
who 
have 
but 
mean 
capacities: 
For 
the 
obscurity 
of 
the 
distinctions 
and 
principles 
which 
they 
use 
causeth 
them 
to 
speak 
of 
all 
things 
as 
boldly, 
as 
if 
they 
knew 



them, 
and 
maintain 
all 
which 
they 
say, 
against 
the 
most 
subtill 
and 
most 
able; 
so 
that 
there 
is 
no 
means 
left 
to 
convince 
them. 
Wherein 
they 
seem 
like 
to 
a 
blinde 
man, 
who, 
to 
fight 
without 
disadvantage 
against 
one 
that 
sees, 
should 
challenge 
him 
down 
into 
the 
bottom 
of 
a 
very 
dark 
cellar: 
And 
I 
may 
say, 
that 
it 
is 
these 
mens 
interest, 
that 
I 
should 
abstain 
from 
publishing 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
Philosophy 
I 
use, 
for 
being 
most 
simple 
and 
most 
evident, 
as 
they 
are, 
I 
should 
even 
do 
the 
same 
in 
publishing 
of 
them, 
as 
if 
I 
opened 
some 
windows, 
to 
let 
the 
day 
into 
this 
cellar, 
into 
which 
they 
go 
down 
to 
fight. 
But 
even 
the 
best 
Wits 
have 
no 
reason 
to 
wish 
for 
the 
knowledge 
of 
them: 
for 
[116]if 
they 
will 
be 
able 
to 
speak 
of 
all 
things, 
and 
acquire 
the 
reputation 
of 
being 
learned, 
they 
will 
easily 
attain 
to 
it 
by 
contenting 
themselves 
with 
probability, 
which 
without 
much 
trouble 
may 
be 
found 
in 
all 
kinde 
of 
matters; 
then 
in 
seeking 
the 
Truth, 
which 
discovers 
it 
self 
but 
by 
little 
and 
little, 
in 
some 
few 
things; 
and 
which, 
when 
we 
are 
to 
speak 
of 
others, 
oblige 
us 
freely 
to 
confesse 
our 
ignorance 
of 
them. 
But 
if 
they 
prefer 
the 
knowledge 
of 
some 
few 
truths 
to 
the 
vanity 
of 
seeming 
to 
be 
ignorant 
of 
nothing, 
as 
without 
doubt 
they 
ought 
to 
do, 
and 
will 
undertake 
a 
designe 
like 
mine, 
I 
need 
not 
tell 
them 
any 
more 
for 
this 
purpose, 
but 
what 
I 
have 
already 
said 
in 
this 
Discourse: 
For 
if 
they 
have 
a 
capacity 
to 
advance 
farther 
then 
I 
have 
done, 
they 
may 
with 
greater 
consequence 
finde 
out 
of 
themselves 
whatsoever 
I 
think 
I 
have 
found; 
Forasmuch 
as 
having 
never 
examined 
any 
thing 
but 
by 
order, 
it’s 
certain, 
[117]that 
what 
remains 
yet 
for 
me 
to 
discover, 
is 
in 
it 
self 
more 
difficult 
and 
more 
hid, 
then 
what 
I 
have 
already 
here 
before 
met 
with; 
and 
they 
would 
receive 
much 
less 
satisfaction 
in 
learning 
it 
from 
me, 
then 
from 
themselves. 
Besides 
that, 
the 
habit 
which 
they 
would 
get 
by 
seeking 
first 
of 
all 
the 
easie 
things, 
and 
passing 
by 
degrees 
to 
others 
more 
difficult, 
will 
be 
more 
usefull 
to 
them, 
then 
all 
my 
instructions. 
As 
I 
for 
my 
part 
am 
perswaded, 
that 
had 
I 
been 
taught 
from 
my 
youth 
all 
the 
Truths 
whose 
demonstrations 
I 
have 
discovered 
since, 
and 
had 
taken 
no 
pains 
to 
learn 
them, 
perhaps 
I 
should 
never 
have 
known 
any 
other, 
or 
at 
least, 
I 
should 
never 
have 
acquired 
that 
habit, 
and 
that 
faculty 
which 
I 
think 
I 
have, 
still 
to 
finde 
out 
new 
ones, 
as 
I 
apply 
my 
self 
to 
the 
search 
of 
them. 
And 
in 
a 
word, 
if 
there 
be 
in 
the 
world 
any 
work 
which 
cannot 
be 
so 
well 
ended 
by 
any 
other, 
as 
by 
the 
same 
who 
began 
it, 
it’s 
that 
which 
I 
am 
now 
about. 


[118]It’s 
true, 
That 
one 
man 
will 
not 
be 
sufficient 
to 
make 
all 
the 
experiments 
which 
may 
conduce 
thereunto: 
But 
withall, 
he 
cannot 
profitably 
imploy 
other 
hands 
then 
his 
own, 
unlesse 
it 
be 
those 
of 
Artists, 
or 
others 



whom 
he 
hires, 
and 
whom 
the 
hope 
of 
profit 
(which 
is 
a 
very 
powerfull 
motive) 
might 
cause 
exactly 
to 
do 
all 
those 
things 
he 
should 
appoint 
them: 
For 
as 
for 
voluntary 
persons, 
who 
by 
curiosity 
or 
a 
desire 
to 
learn, 
would 
perhaps 
offer 
themselves 
to 
his 
help, 
besides 
that 
commonly 
they 
promise 
more 
then 
they 
perform, 
and 
make 
onely 
fair 
propositions, 
whereof 
none 
ever 
succeeds, 
they 
would 
infallibly 
be 
paid 
by 
the 
solution 
of 
some 
difficulties, 
or 
at 
least 
by 
complements 
and 
unprofitable 
entertainments, 
which 
could 
not 
cost 
him 
so 
little 
of 
his 
time, 
but 
he 
would 
be 
a 
loser 
thereby. 
And 
for 
the 
Experiments 
which 
others 
have 
already 
made, 
although 
they 
would 
even 
communicate 
them 
to 
him 
(which 
those 
who 
call 
them 
Secrets 
[119]would 
never 
do,) 
they 
are 
for 
the 
most 
part 
composed 
of 
so 
many 
circumstances, 
or 
superfluous 
ingredients, 
that 
it 
would 
be 
very 
hard 
for 
him 
to 
decypher 
the 
truth 
of 
them: 
Besides, 
he 
would 
find 
them 
all 
so 
ill 
exprest, 
or 
else 
so 
false, 
by 
reason 
that 
those 
who 
made 
them 
have 
laboured 
to 
make 
them 
appear 
conformable 
to 
their 
principles; 
that 
if 
there 
were 
any 
which 
served 
their 
turn, 
they 
could 
not 
at 
least 
be 
worth 
the 
while 
which 
must 
be 
imployed 
in 
the 
choice 
of 
them. 
So 
that, 
if 
there 
were 
any 
in 
the 
world 
that 
were 
certainly 
known 
to 
be 
capable 
of 
finding 
out 
the 
greatest 
things, 
and 
the 
most 
profitable 
for 
the 
Publick 
which 
could 
be, 
and 
that 
other 
men 
would 
therefore 
labour 
alwayes 
to 
assist 
him 
to 
accomplish 
his 
Designes; 
I 
do 
not 
conceive 
that 
they 
could 
do 
more 
for 
him, 
then 
furnish 
the 
expence 
of 
the 
experiments 
whereof 
he 
stood 
in 
need; 
and 
besides, 
take 
care 
only 
that 
he 
may 
not 
be 
by 
any 
body 
hindred 
[120]of 
his 
time. 
But 
besides 
that, 
I 
do 
not 
presume 
so 
much 
of 
my 
Self, 
as 
to 
promise 
any 
thing 
extraordinary, 
neither 
do 
I 
feed 
my 
self 
with 
such 
vain 
hopes, 
as 
to 
imagine 
that 
the 
Publick 
should 
much 
interesse 
it 
self 
in 
my 
designes; 
I 
have 
not 
so 
base 
a 
minde, 
as 
to 
accept 
of 
any 
favour 
whatsoever, 
which 
might 
be 
thought 
I 
had 
not 
deserved. 


All 
these 
considerations 
joyned 
together, 
were 
the 
cause 
three 
years 
since 
why 
I 
would 
not 
divulge 
the 
Treatise 
I 
had 
in 
hand; 
and 
which 
is 
more, 
that 
I 
resolved 
to 
publish 
none 
whilest 
I 
lived, 
which 
might 
be 
so 
general, 
as 
that 
the 
Grounds 
of 
my 
Philosophy 
might 
be 
understood 
thereby. 
But 
since, 
there 
hath 
been 
two 
other 
reasons 
have 
obliged 
me 
to 
put 
forth 
some 
particular 
Essays, 
and 
to 
give 
the 
Publick 
some 
account 
of 
my 
Actions 
and 
Designes. 
The 
first 
was, 
that 
if 
I 
failed 
therein, 
divers 
who 
knew 
the 
intention 
I 
formerly 
had 
to 
print 
some 
of 
my 
Writings, 
might 
[121]imagine 
that 
the 
causes 
for 
which 
I 
forbore 
it, 
might 
be 
more 
to 
my 
disadvantage 
then 
they 
are. 
For 
although 
I 
do 
not 
affect 
glory 
in 
excess; 
or 
even, 
(if 
I 
may 
so 
speak) 
that 
I 



hate 
it, 
as 
far 
as 
I 
judge 
it 
contrary 
to 
my 
rest, 
which 
I 
esteem 
above 
all 
things: 
Yet 
also 
did 
I 
never 
seek 
to 
hide 
my 
actions 
as 
crimes, 
neither 
have 
I 
been 
very 
wary 
to 
keep 
my 
self 
unknown; 
as 
well 
because 
I 
thought 
I 
might 
wrong 
my 
self, 
as 
that 
it 
might 
in 
some 
manner 
disquiet 
me, 
which 
would 
again 
have 
been 
contrary 
to 
the 
perfect 
repose 
of 
my 
minde 
which 
I 
seek. 
And 
because 
having 
alwayes 
kept 
my 
self 
indifferent, 
caring 
not 
whether 
I 
were 
known 
or 
no, 
I 
could 
not 
chuse 
but 
get 
some 
kinde 
of 
reputation, 
I 
thought 
that 
I 
ought 
to 
do 
my 
best 
to 
hinder 
it 
at 
least 
from 
being 
ill. 
The 
other 
reason 
which 
obliged 
me 
to 
write 
this, 
is, 
that 
observing 
every 
day 
more 
and 
more 
the 
designe 
I 
have 
to 
instruct 
my 
self, 
retarded 
by 
reason 
of 
an 
infinite 
number 
[122]of 
experiments 
which 
are 
needful 
to 
me, 
and 
which 
its 
impossible 
for 
me 
to 
make 
without 
the 
help 
of 
others; 
although 
I 
do 
not 
so 
much 
flatter 
my 
self, 
as 
to 
hope 
that 
the 
Publick, 
shares 
much 
in 
my 
concernments; 
yet 
will 
I 
not 
also 
be 
so 
much 
wanting 
to 
my 
self, 
as 
to 
give 
any 
cause 
to 
those 
who 
shall 
survive 
me, 
to 
reproach 
this, 
one 
day 
to 
me, 
That 
I 
could 
have 
left 
them 
divers 
things 
far 
beyond 
what 
I 
have 
done, 
had 
I 
not 
too 
much 
neglected 
to 
make 
them 
understand 
wherein 
they 
might 
contribute 
to 
my 
designe. 


And 
I 
thought 
it 
easie 
for 
me 
to 
choose 
some 
matters, 
which 
being 
not 
subject 
to 
many 
Controversies, 
nor 
obliging 
me 
to 
declare 
any 
more 
of 
my 
Principles 
then 
I 
would 
willingly, 
would 
neverthelesse 
expresse 
clearly 
enough, 
what 
my 
abilities 
or 
defects 
are 
in 
the 
Sciences. 
Wherein 
I 
cannot 
say 
whether 
I 
have 
succeeded 
or 
no; 
neither 
will 
I 
prevent 
the 
judgment 
of 
any 
man 
by 
speaking 
of 
my 
own 
[123]Writings: 
but 
I 
should 
be 
glad 
they 
might 
be 
examin’d; 
and 
to 
that 
end 
I 
beseech 
all 
those 
who 
have 
any 
objections 
to 
make, 
to 
take 
the 
pains 
to 
send 
them 
to 
my 
Stationer, 
that 
I 
being 
advertised 
by 
him, 
may 
endeavour 
at 
the 
same 
time 
to 
adjoyn 
my 
Answer 
thereunto: 
and 
by 
that 
means, 
the 
Reader 
seeing 
both 
the 
one 
and 
the 
other, 
may 
the 
more 
easily 
judge 
of 
the 
Truth. 
For 
I 
promise, 
that 
I 
will 
never 
make 
any 
long 
Answers, 
but 
only 
very 
freely 
confesse 
my 
own 
faults, 
if 
I 
find 
them; 
or 
if 
I 
cannot 
discover 
them, 
plainly 
say 
what 
I 
shal 
think 
requisite 
in 
defence 
of 
what 
I 
have 
writ, 
without 
adding 
the 
explanation 
of 
any 
new 
matter, 
that 
I 
may 
not 
endlesly 
engage 
my 
self 
out 
of 
one 
into 
another. 


Now 
if 
there 
be 
any 
whereof 
I 
have 
spoken 
in 
the 
beginning, 
of 
the 
Opticks 
and 
of 
the 
Meteors, 
which 
at 
first 
jarr, 
by 
reason 
that 
I 
call 
them 
Suppositions, 
and 
that 
I 
seem 
not 
willing 
to 
prove 
them; 
let 
a 
man 
have 
but 



the 
patience 
[124]to 
read 
the 
whole 
attentively, 
and 
I 
hope 
he 
will 
rest 
satisfied: 
For 
(me 
thinks) 
the 
reasons 
follow 
each 
other 
so 
closely, 
that 
as 
the 
later 
are 
demonstrated 
by 
the 
former, 
which 
are 
their 
Causes; 
the 
former 
are 
reciprocally 
proved 
by 
the 
later, 
which 
are 
their 
Effects. 
And 
no 
man 
can 
imagine 
that 
I 
herein 
commit 
the 
fault 
which 
the 
Logicians 
call 
a 
Circle; 
for 
experience 
rendring 
the 
greatest 
part 
of 
these 
effects 
most 
certain, 
the 
causes 
whence 
I 
deduce 
them 
serve 
not 
so 
much 
to 
prove, 
as 
to 
explain 
them; 
but 
on 
the 
contrary, 
they 
are 
those 
which 
are 
proved 
by 
them. 
Neither 
named 
I 
them 
Suppositions, 
that 
it 
might 
be 
known 
that 
I 
conceive 
my 
self 
able 
to 
deduce 
them 
from 
those 
first 
Truths 
which 
I 
have 
before 
discovered: 
But 
that 
I 
would 
not 
expresly 
do 
it 
to 
crosse 
certain 
spirits, 
who 
imagine 
that 
they 
know 
in 
a 
day 
al 
what 
another 
may 
have 
thought 
in 
twenty 
yeers, 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
hath 
told 
them 
but 
two 
or 
three 
words; 
[125]and 
who 
are 
so 
much 
the 
more 
subject 
to 
erre, 
and 
less 
capable 
of 
the 
Truth, 
(as 
they 
are 
more 
quick 
and 
penetrating) 
from 
taking 
occasion 
of 
erecting 
some 
extravagant 
Philosophy 
on 
what 
they 
may 
beleeve 
to 
be 
my 
Principles, 
and 
lest 
the 
fault 
should 
be 
attributed 
to 
me. 
For 
as 
for 
those 
opinions 
which 
are 
wholly 
mine, 
I 
excuse 
them 
not 
as 
being 
new, 
because 
that 
if 
the 
reasons 
of 
them 
be 
seriously 
considered, 
I 
assure 
my 
self, 
they 
will 
be 
found 
so 
plain, 
and 
so 
agreeable 
to 
common 
sense, 
that 
they 
will 
seem 
less 
extraordinary 
and 
strange 
then 
any 
other 
which 
may 
be 
held 
on 
the 
same 
Subjects. 
Neither 
do 
I 
boast 
that 
I 
am 
the 
first 
Inventor 
of 
any 
of 
them; 
but 
of 
this 
indeed, 
that 
I 
never 
admitted 
any 
of 
them, 
neither 
because 
they 
had, 
or 
had 
not 
been 
said 
by 
others, 
but 
only 
because 
Reason 
perswaded 
me 
to 
them. 


If 
Mechanicks 
cannot 
so 
soon 
put 
in 
practise 
the 
Invention 
which 
is 
set 
forth 
in 
the 
Opticks, 
I 
beleeve 
that 
[126]therefore 
men 
ought 
not 
to 
condemn 
it; 
forasmuch 
as 
skill 
and 
practice 
are 
necessary 
for 
the 
making 
and 
compleating 
the 
Machines 
I 
have 
described; 
so 
that 
nocircumstance 
should 
be 
wanting. 
I 
should 
no 
less 
wonder 
if 
they 
should 
succeed 
at 
first 
triall, 
then 
if 
a 
man 
should 
learn 
in 
a 
day 
to 
play 
excellently 
well 
on 
a 
Lute, 
by 
having 
an 
exact 
piece 
set 
before 
him. 
And 
if 
I 
write 
in 
French, 
which 
is 
the 
language 
of 
my 
Country, 
rather 
then 
in 
Latin, 
which 
is 
that 
of 
my 
Tutors, 
’tis 
because 
I 
hope 
such 
who 
use 
their 
meer 
naturall 
reason, 
wil 
better 
judge 
of 
my 
opinions, 
then 
those 
who 
only 
beleeve 
in 
old 
Books. 
And 
for 
those 
who 
joyn 
a 
right 
understanding 
with 
study, 
(who 
I 
only 
wish 
for 
my 
Judges) 
I 
assure 
my 
self, 
they 
will 
not 
be 
so 
partiall 
to 
the 
Latin, 
as 
to 
refuse 
to 
read 
my 
reasons 
because 
I 
expresse 
them 
in 
a 
vulgar 
tongue. 



To 
conclude, 
I 
will 
not 
speak 
here 
in 
particular 
of 
the 
progresse 
I 
hoped 
to 
make 
hereafter 
in 
Learning; 
Nor 
[127]engage 
my 
self 
by 
any 
promise 
to 
the 
Publick, 
which 
I 
am 
not 
certain 
to 
perform. 
But 
I 
shall 
onely 
say, 
That 
I 
am 
resolved 
to 
employ 
the 
remainder 
of 
my 
life 
in 
no 
other 
thing 
but 
the 
study 
to 
acquire 
some 
such 
knowledge 
of 
Nature 
as 
may 
furnish 
us 
with 
more 
certain 
rules 
in 
Physick 
then 
we 
hitherto 
have 
had: 
And 
that 
my 
inclination 
drives 
me 
so 
strongly 
from 
all 
other 
kind 
of 
designes, 
chiefly 
from 
those 
which 
cannot 
be 
profitable 
to 
any, 
but 
by 
prejudicing 
others; 
that 
if 
any 
occasion 
obliged 
me 
to 
spend 
my 
time 
therein, 
I 
should 
beleeve 
I 
should 
never 
succeed 
therein: 
which 
I 
here 
declare, 
though 
I 
well 
know 
it 
conduceth 
not 
to 
make 
me 
considerable 
in 
the 
world; 
neither 
is 
it 
my 
ambition 
to 
be 
so. 
And 
I 
shall 
esteem 
my 
self 
always 
more 
obliged 
to 
those 
by 
whose 
favour 
I 
shal 
without 
disturbance 
enjoy 
my 
ease, 
then 
to 
them 
who 
should 
proffer 
me 
the 
most 
honourable 
imployment 
of 
the 
earth.
