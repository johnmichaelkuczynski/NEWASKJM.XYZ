FOREWORD 


HANS-HERMANN 
HOPPE 
IS 
ONE 
OF 
THE 
most 
remarkable 
libertarian 
scholars 
of 
our 
time. 
He 
began 
as 
a 
prize 
student 
of 
Jürgen 
Habermas, 
the 
famous 
German 
philosopher 
and 
social 
theorist. 
Habermas 
was, 
and 
remains 
to 
this 
day, 
a 
committed 
Marxist. 
He 
is 
the 
leader 
of 
the 
notorious 
Frankfurt 
school. 


Habermas 
was 
very 
impressed 
with 
Hans, 
and, 
under 
the 
patronage 
of 
this 
eminent 
Marxist, 
Hans 
had 
every 
reason 
to 
expect 
a 
stellar 
academic 
career 
in 
his 
native 
Germany. 
A 
problem 
soon 
arose, 
though, 
one 
which 
has 
had 
happy 
results 
for 
all 
those 
who 
love 
liberty. 
Hans 
soon 
came 
to 
realize 
that 
the 
leftism 
and 
socialism 
he 
had 
grown 
up 
with 
was 
intellectually 
barren 
and 
morally 
bankrupt. 
He 
discovered 
on 
his 
own 
the 
great 
works 
of 
Ludwig 
von 
Mises 
and 
Murray 
N. 
Rothbard. 


Austrian 
economics 
and 
Murray’s 
anarchism 
were 
not 
what 
Habermas 
had 
in 
mind. 
By 
becoming 
a 
libertarian, 
Hans 
effectively 
ended 
his 
chances 
for 
a 
chair 
at 
a 
major 
German 
university, 
even 
though 
his 
intellectual 
accomplishments 
easily 
qualified 
him 
for 
one. 
Like 
Murray, 
though, 
Hans 
is 
a 
scholar 
of 
complete 
intellectual 
integrity. 
He 
would 
not 
surrender 
what 
he 
had 
come 
to 
realize 
was 
the 
truth, 
whatever 
the 
cost 
to 
his 
own 
career. 


Hans 
decided 
to 
come 
to 
United 
States 
in 
order 
to 
study 
with 
Murray, 
who 
was 
then 
teaching 
in 
New 
York. 
When 
I 
met 
him, 
I 
was 
struck 
by 
Hans’s 
firm 
commitment 
to 
Rothbardian 
principles 
and 
his 
outstanding 
intellectual 
ability. 
Murray, 
of 
course, 
immediately 
grasped 
Hans’s 
potential. 
When 
Murray 
was 
named 
to 
an 
endowed 
chair 
in 
economics 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Nevada, 
Las 
Vegas, 
he 
worked 
to 
get 
Hans 
a 
position 
in 
the 
economics 
department 
as 
well. 
Together, 
the 
two 
of 
them 
made 
UNLV 
a 
major 
center 
for 
the 
study 
of 
Austrian 
economics; 
and 
they 
did 
so 
in 
the 
face 
of 
much 
opposition 
from 
some 
of 
their 
departmental 
colleagues. 


Murray 
was 
especially 
intrigued 
by 
one 
of 
Hans’s 
main 
arguments. 
Hans’s 
teacher 
Habermas 
pioneered 
an 
approach 
to 
ethics 
based 
on 
the 
conditions 
for 
engaging 
in 
rational 
argument. 
In 
a 
way 
that 
Habermas 
would 
hardly 
approve, 
Hans 
turned 
Habermas’s 
ethics 
on 
its 
head. 
Instead 
of 
support 
for 
socialism, 
argumentation 
ethics 
as 
Hans 
explained 
it 
provided 
powerful 
support 
for 
self-ownership 
and 
private 
property. 
Murray 
heartily 



approved 
and 
highly 
praised 
Hans’s 
argument: 


Hans 
Hoppe 
has 
... 
deduced 
an 
anarcho-Lockean 
rights 
ethic 
from 
self-evident 
axioms. 
Not 
only 
that: 
he 
has 
demonstrated 
that, 
just 
like 
the 
action 
axiom 
itself, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
deny 
or 
disagree 
with 
the 
anarcho-Lockean 
rights 
ethic 
without 
falling 
immediately 
into 
self-contradiction 
and 
self-refutation. 
(Liberty, 
November 
1988) 


Hans 
had 
reversed 
Habermas; 
but 
not 
content 
with 
this, 
he 
again 
overturned 
conventional 
opinion. 
Like 
Murray, 
Hans 
is 
an 
anarcho-capitalist. 
The 
best 
government 
is 
no 
government 
at 
all. 
The 
question 
nevertheless 
arises: 
in 
a 
world 
of 
states, 
what 
type 
of 
government 
is 
the 
least 
bad? 
Almost 
everybody 
says 
“democracy.” 
Unfortunately, 
many 
libertarians 
agree. 
Hans 
showed 
in 
his 
classic 
Democracy: 
The 
God 
That 
Failed 
that 
democracy 
leads 
to 
profligate 
spending 
and 
reckless 
policies. 
Those 
in 
power 
know 
that 
they 
will 
remain 
in 
charge 
only 
for 
a 
limited 
time. 
Their 
attitude 
will 
be 
“get 
all 
you 
can 
and 
get 
it 
now.” 
By 
contrast, 
a 
king 
will 
tend 
to 
be 
less 
exploitative. 
He 
will 
try 
to 
preserve 
the 
lives 
and 
property 
of 
his 
subjects, 
because 
he 
is 
no 
temporary 
ruler, 
and 
wants 
to 
pass 
on 
a 
prosperous 
kingdom 
to 
his 
heirs. 
Hans 
of 
course 
did 
not 
say 
that 
monarchy 
was 
a 
“good 
thing,” 
just 
that 
it 
tends 
to 
be 
better 
than 
democracy. 
The 
great 
Catholic 
classical 
liberal 
Erik 
von 
Kuehnelt-Leddihn, 
who 
had 
influenced 
Hans, 
said 
this 
was 
a 
brilliant 
insight. 


“From 
Aristocracy 
to 
Monarchy 
to 
Democracy,” 
one 
of 
the 
essays 
included 
in 
A 
Short 
History 
of 
Man, 
summarizes 
Hans’s 
position. 
Readers 
of 
this 
scintillating 
work 
will 
discover 
that 
if 
monarchy 
is 
better 
than 
democracy, 
aristocracy 
is 
better 
still. 
If 
you 
haven’t 
read 
Hans 
before, 
you 
have 
a 
treat 
in 
store 
for 
you. 
In 
just 
a 
few 
pages, 
he 
will 
make 
you 
question 
everything 
you 
have 
ever 
read 
about 
government. 


Throughout 
A 
Short 
History 
of 
Man, 
Hans 
shows 
how 
the 
lessons 
of 
Austrian 
economics 
can 
be 
used 
to 
help 
us 
understand 
history. 
In 
doing 
so, 
Hans 
is 
following 
the 
path 
laid 
down 
by 
his 
great 
mentor, 
Murray 
Rothbard. 
Like 
Murray, 
Hans 
is 
a 
scholar 
of 
near 
universal 
interests. 
He 
is 
fully 
at 
home 
in 
anthropology 
and 
sociology, 
as 
well 
as 
global 
history, 
economics, 
and 
philosophy. 



Drawing 
on 
his 
vast 
knowledge 
and 
Austrian 
insights, 
Hans 
addresses 
two 
questions. 
How 
did 
the 
family 
and 
private 
property 
originate? 
How 
did 
the 
Industrial 
Revolution 
get 
started? 
Readers 
will 
see 
how 
the 
development 
of 
secure 
property 
rights 
and 
the 
free 
market 
has 
been 
essential 
to 
human 
progress. 
The 
question 
for 
our 
times 
then 
is: 
Will 
these 
developments 
continue, 
to 
the 
great 
benefit 
of 
mankind, 
or 
will 
the 
state 
be 
able 
to 
thwart 
them? 


In 
its 
use 
of 
economics 
and 
philosophy 
to 
illuminate 
history, 
A 
Short 
History 
of 
Man 
brings 
to 
mind 
such 
libertarian 
classics 
as 
Oppenheimer’s 
The 
State, 
Nock’s 
Our 
Enemy 
the 
State, 
and 
Chodorov’s 
The 
Rise 
and 
Fall 
of 
Society. 
A 
Short 
History 
of 
Man 
is 
an 
ideal 
introduction 
to 
the 
thought 
of 
a 
major 
social 
thinker 
and 
outstanding 
libertarian.

INTRODUCTION: 
AN 
AUSTRO-LIBERTARIAN 
RECONSTRUCTION 


THE 
FOLLOWING 
STUDIES 
TRY 
TO 
EXPLAIN 
THREE 
of 
the 
most 
momentous 
events 
in 
the 
history 
of 
mankind. 


First, 
I 
explain 
the 
origin 
of 
private 
property, 
and 
in 
particular 
of 
ground 
land, 
and 
of 
the 
family 
and 
the 
family 
household 
as 
the 
institutional 
foundations 
of 
agriculture 
and 
agrarian 
life 
that 
began 
some 
11,000 
years 
ago, 
with 
the 
Neolithic 
Revolution 
in 
the 
Fertile 
Crescent 
of 
the 
Near-East, 
and 
that 
has 
since—until 
well 
through 
the 
late 
nineteenth 
century—come 
to 
shape 
and 
leave 
an 
imprint 
on 
human 
life 
everywhere. 


Second, 
I 
explain 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
Industrial 
Revolution 
that 
set 
off 
around 
1800, 
only 
some 
200 
years 
ago 
in 
England. 
Until 
then 
and 
for 
thousands 
of 
years, 
mankind 
had 
lived 
under 
Malthusian 
conditions. 
Population 
growth 
was 
constantly 
encroaching 
on 
the 
available 
means 
of 
subsistence. 
Every 
productivity 
increase 
was 
“eaten 
up” 
quickly 
by 
an 
expanding 
population 
size 
such 
that 
real 
incomes 
for 
the 
overwhelming 
bulk 
of 
the 
population 
were 
held 
down 
constantly 
near 
subsistence 
level. 
Only 
for 
about 
two 
centuries 
now 
has 
man 
been 
able 
to 
achieve 
population 
growth 
combined 
with 
increasing 
per 
capita 
incomes. 


And 
third, 
I 
explain 
the 
parallel 
origin 
and 
development 
of 
the 
State 
as 
a 
territorial 
monopolist 
of 
ultimate 
decision-making, 
i.e., 
an 
institution 
vested 
with 
the 
power 
to 
legislate 
and 
tax 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
a 
territory, 
and 
its 
transformation 
from 
a 
monarchic 
State, 
with 
“absolute” 
kings, 
to 
a 
democratic 
State 
with 
“absolute” 
people, 
as 
it 
has 
come 
to 
the 
fore 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century. 


While 
this 
could 
suffice 
as 
an 
introduction 
and 
the 
reader 
could 
proceed 
directly 
to 
the 
following 
chapters, 
a 
few 
additional 
remarks 
may 
be 
in 
order 
for 
the 
philosophically 
minded 
reader. 


Until 
the 
early 
twentieth 
century, 
the 
following 
would 
have 
been 
classified 
as 
sociological 
studies. 
But 
with 
the 
rise 
and 
increasingly 
dominant 
influence 
attained 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century 
by 
the 
empiricist



positivist-falsificationist 
philosophy, 
the 
term 
sociology 
in 
the 
meantime 
has 
acquired 
a 
very 
different 
meaning. 
According 
to 
the 
empiricist 
philosophy, 
normative 
questions—questions 
of 
justice, 
of 
“right” 
and 
“wrong”—are 
not 
scientific 
questions 
at 
all—and 
consequently 
most 
of 
modern, 
“scientific” 
sociology, 
then, 
is 
dogmatically 
committed 
to 
some 
variant 
of 
ethical 
relativism 
(of 
‘anything 
goes’). 
And 
the 
empiricist 
philosophy 
categorically 
rules 
out 
the 
existence 
of 
any 
non-hypothetical, 
non-falsifiable, 
or 
synthetic 
a 
priori 
laws 
and 
truths—and 
accordingly 
modern 
sociology 
is 
dogmatically 
committed 
also 
to 
some 
variant 
of 
empirical 
relativism 
(of 
‘everything 
is 
possible,’ 
of 
‘you 
can 
never 
be 
sure 
of 
anything,’ 
and 
‘nothing 
can 
be 
ruled 
out 
from 
the 
outset’). 


My 
studies 
are 
and 
do 
everything 
a 
“good 
empiricist” 
is 
not 
supposed 
to 
be 
or 
do; 
for 
I 
consider 
the 
empiricist-positivist 
philosophy 
wrong 
and 
unscientific 
and 
regard 
its 
influence 
especially 
on 
the 
social 
sciences 
as 
an 
unmitigated 
intellectual 
disaster. 


It 
is 
demonstrably 
false 
that 
ethics 
is 
not 
a 
science, 
and 
that 
no 
universal 
principles 
of 
justice 
exist 
and 
no 
“true” 
(non-arbitrary) 
criterion 
of 
distinguishing 
moral 
progress 
from 
decline. 
And 
it 
is 
likewise 
demonstrably 
false 
that 
no 
universal 
and 
invariant 
laws 
of 
human 
action 
and 
interaction 
exist, 
i.e., 
no 
laws 
of 
what 
is 
and 
is 
not 
possible 
and 
of 
what 
can 
and 
cannot 
be 
successfully 
done 
in 
human 
affairs, 
and 
no 
non-arbitrary 
criterion 
of 
judging 
actions 
as 
correct 
and 
successful 
or 
incorrect 
and 
faulty 
solutions 
to 
a 
given 
problem 
or 
purpose. 


As 
for 
the 
second, 
‘positive’ 
claim, 
it 
is 
contradicted 
by 
the 
entire 
body 
of 
Classical 
Economics. 
Classical 
Economics, 
reconstructed, 
refined, 
and 
further 
advanced 
during 
the 
“Marginalist 
Revolution,” 
in 
particular 
by 
its 
Viennese 
branch, 
founded 
by 
Carl 
Menger 
(1840–1921) 
with 
his 
Principles 
of 
Economics 
(1871) 
and 
culminating 
with 
Ludwig 
von 
Mises 
(1881–1973) 
and 
his 
unsurpassed 
Human 
Action 
(1940), 
and 
by 
what 
has 
since 
become 
known 
as 
Austrian 
economics, 
provides 
the 
intellectual 
material 
for 
a 
grand, 
comprehensive 
system 
of 
non-hypothetically 
true 
laws 
of 
human 
action, 
of 
praxeology—the 
logic 
of 
action—and 
of 
praxeological 
laws. 


Any 
explanation 
of 
historical 
events 
must 
take 
praxeology—and 
specifically 
Ludwig 
von 
Mises—into 
account, 
and 
it 
is 
the 
“empiricists” 
who 
are 
insufficiently 
empirical 
in 
their 
work. 
In 
denying 
or 
ignoring 
the 
underlying 
praxeological 
invariants 
and 
constants 
in 
their 
observations 
of 
the 



social 
world, 
they 
fail 
to 
see 
the 
forest 
for 
the 
trees. 


And 
as 
for 
the 
first, 
‘normative’ 
claim, 
it 
is 
contradicted 
by 
the 
entire 
body 
of 
private 
law, 
in 
particular 
the 
law 
of 
property 
and 
contract, 
that 
grew 
up 
in 
response 
to 
the 
continued 
occurrence 
of 
interpersonal 
conflict 
regarding 
scarce 
resources. 
From 
the 
old 
‘natural 
law’ 
tradition 
of 
the 
Stoics, 
through 
Roman 
law, 
to 
Scholastic 
law, 
to 
the 
modern, 
secular 
‘natural 
rights’ 
tradition, 
a 
body 
of 
law 
and 
of 
scholarly 
literature 
on 
matters 
of 
law 
had 
emerged 
by 
the 
nineteenth 
century, 
that 
should 
put 
any 
ethical 
relativist 
to 
shame. 


Buried 
for 
a 
long 
time 
under 
mountains 
of 
positivist 
legal 
rubbish, 
this 
tradition 
has 
been 
rescued 
and 
reinvigorated, 
refined, 
and 
rigorously 
reconstructed 
in 
our 
time 
above 
all 
by 
Murray 
N. 
Rothbard 
(1926–1995), 
most 
notably 
in 
his 
Ethics 
of 
Liberty 
(1981), 
to 
the 
until 
now 
most 
comprehensive 
system 
of 
natural 
law 
and 
the 
political 
philosophy 
of 
libertarianism. 
Any 
normative 
evaluation 
of 
historical 
events 
and 
developments 
that 
aspires 
to 
the 
rank 
of 
science, 
i.e., 
that 
claims 
to 
be 
more 
than 
an 
arbitrary 
expression 
of 
taste, 
must 
take 
account 
of 
libertarianism, 
and 
of 
Murray 
Rothbard 
in 
particular. 


Hence, 
to 
indicate 
the 
method 
guiding 
my 
studies 
in 
the 
history 
of 
man, 
the 
subtitle 
of 
my 
little 
book: 
An 
Austro-Libertarian 
Reconstruction. 


The 
events 
in 
human 
history 
that 
I 
want 
to 
explain 
are 
not 
necessary 
and 
predetermined, 
but 
contingent 
empirical 
events, 
and 
my 
studies 
then 
are 
not 
exercises 
in 
economic 
or 
libertarian 
theory. 
They 
will 
have 
to 
tell 
history 
as 
it 
really 
was 
and 
take 
account 
of 
all 
known 
facts. 
In 
this 
regard, 
I 
do 
not 
claim 
any 
originality. 
I 
do 
not 
unearth 
any 
unknown 
facts 
or 
dispute 
any 
established 
findings. 
I 
rely 
on 
what 
others 
have 
established 
as 
the 
known 
facts. 
But 
the 
facts 
and 
the 
chronology 
of 
events 
do 
not 
contain 
their 
own 
explanation 
or 
interpretation. 
What 
distinguishes 
my 
studies 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
explain 
and 
interpret 
the 
history 
of 
man 
from 
the 
conceptual 
vantage 
point 
of 
Austro-
Libertarianism: 
with 
the 
background 
knowledge 
of 
praxeology 
(economics) 
and 
of 
libertarianism 
(ethics). 
They 
are 
conducted 
in 
awareness 
of 
the 
non-
hypothetical 
or 
aprioristic 
character 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
praxeology 
and 
of 
ethics 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
such 
laws 
impose 
strict 
logical 
limitations 
on 
what—which 
one—explanation 
or 
interpretation, 
of 
all 
conceivable 
explanations 
and 
interpretations 
of 
some 
given 
historical 
data 
set, 
can 
be 
considered 
at 
all 
possible 
and 
possibly 
(hypothetically) 
true 
(and 
so 
be 
scientifically 



admissible), 
and 
which 
ones 
can 
and 
must 
be 
ruled 
out 
instead 
as 
impossible 
and 
impossibly 
true. 
History, 
then, 
is 
rationally 
re-constructed, 
i.e., 
with 
the 
knowledge 
that 
every 
possibly 
true 
empirical 
explanation 
and 
interpretation 
must 
be 
in 
accordance 
not 
only 
with 
the 
‘data’ 
but 
in 
particular 
also 
with 
praxeological 
and 
ethical 
law, 
and 
that 
every 
explanation 
or 
interpretation 
at 
variance 
with 
such 
laws, 
even 
if 
apparently 
‘fitting 
the 
data,’ 
is 
not 
only 
empirically 
false 
but 
not 
a 
scientifically 
admissible 
explanation 
or 
interpretation 
at 
all. 


The 
history 
so 
reconstructed 
and 
retold 
is 
to 
a 
significant 
extent 
revisionist 
history, 
opposed 
not 
only 
to 
much 
or 
even 
most 
of 
what 
the 
dominant 
leftist 
“mainstream” 
has 
to 
say 
on 
the 
matter, 
but, 
owing 
to 
the 
emphasis 
placed 
in 
my 
studies 
on 
human 
inequalities 
and 
in 
particular 
on 
unequal 
cognitive 
abilities 
and 
psychic 
dispositions, 
opposed 
also 
to 
much 
pronounced 
and 
proclaimed 
in 
this 
regard 
by 
some 
circles 
of 
“politically 
correct” 
and 
“progressive” 
so-called 
“cosmopolitan” 
establishment-
libertarians. 


Thus 
the 
first 
momentous 
event 
in 
the 
history 
of 
man, 
the 
Neolithic 
Revolution, 
is 
reconstructed 
as 
a 
cognitive 
achievement 
of 
the 
first 
order 
and 
a 
great 
progressive 
step 
in 
the 
evolution 
of 
human 
intelligence. 
The 
institution 
of 
private 
land 
ownership 
and 
of 
the 
family 
and 
the 
practice 
of 
agriculture 
and 
animal 
husbandry 
is 
explained 
as 
a 
rational 
invention, 
a 
new 
and 
innovative 
solution 
to 
the 
problem 
faced 
by 
tribal 
hunters 
and 
gatherers 
of 
balancing 
population 
growth 
and 
increasing 
land 
scarcity. 


Similarly, 
the 
Industrial 
Revolution 
is 
reconstructed 
as 
another 
great 
leap 
forward 
in 
the 
development 
of 
human 
rationality. 
The 
problem 
of 
balancing 
land 
and 
population 
size 
that 
had 
been 
temporarily 
solved 
with 
the 
original 
invention 
and 
subsequent 
spread 
and 
worldwide 
imitation 
of 
agriculture 
had 
to 
eventually 
re-emerge. 
As 
long 
as 
the 
population 
size 
increased, 
per 
capita 
incomes 
could 
be 
increased 
only 
if 
and 
for 
as 
long 
as 
productivity 
increases 
outstripped 
population 
growth. 
But 
steady 
productivity 
increases, 
i.e., 
the 
continuous 
invention 
of 
new 
or 
more 
efficient 
tools 
for 
the 
production 
of 
ever 
more, 
new 
or 
better 
products, 
requires 
a 
continuously 
high 
level 
of 
human 
intelligence, 
of 
ingenuity, 
patience, 
and 
inventiveness. 
Wherever, 
and 
as 
long 
as 
such 
a 
high 
level 
of 
intelligence 
is 
lacking, 
population 
growth 
must 
lead 
to 
lower—and 
not 
to 
higher—per 
capita 
incomes. 
The 
Industrial 
Revolution, 
then, 
marks 
the 
point, 
when 
the 
level 
of 



human 
rationality 
had 
reached 
a 
level 
high 
enough 
to 
make 
the 
escape 
from 
Malthusianism 
possible. 
And 
the 
escape 
is 
reconstructed 
as 
the 
result 
of 
the 
“breeding,” 
over 
many 
generations, 
of 
a 
more 
intelligent 
population. 
Higher 
intelligence 
translated 
into 
greater 
economic 
success, 
and 
greater 
economic 
success 
combined 
with 
selective 
marriage-and 
family-policies 
translated 
into 
greater 
reproductive 
success 
(the 
production 
of 
a 
larger 
number 
of 
surviving 
descendants). 
This 
combined 
with 
the 
laws 
of 
human 
genetics 
and 
civil 
inheritance 
produced 
over 
time 
a 
more 
intelligent, 
ingenious 
and 
innovative 
population. 


Lastly, 
while 
the 
Neolithic 
and 
Industrial 
Revolutions 
are 
reconstructed 
as 
correct 
and 
innovative 
solutions 
to 
a 
persistent 
problem: 
of 
a 
population 
size 
encroaching 
on 
living 
standards, 
and 
hence 
as 
great 
intellectual 
advances, 
the 
third 
momentous 
event 
to 
be 
explained 
is 
the 
invention 
of 
the 
State. 
The 
State 
is 
a 
territorial 
monopolist 
of 
ultimate 
decision-making 
and 
its 
successive 
transformation 
from 
a 
monarchic 
to 
a 
democratic 
State, 
is 
reconstructed 
as 
the 
outcome 
of 
a 
sequence 
of 
cumulative 
intellectual—moral 
and 
economic—errors 
and 
as 
a 
step 
back 
in 
the 
development 
of 
human 
rationality 
and 
a 
growing 
threat 
to 
the 
achievements 
attained 
with 
the 
Industrial 
Revolution. 
Per 
construction, 
the 
State 
cannot 
achieve 
what 
it 
is 
supposed 
to 
achieve. 
It 
is 
supposed 
to 
produce 
justice, 
i.e., 
to 
uphold 
and 
enforce 
the 
law, 
but 
with 
the 
power 
to 
legislate 
the 
State 
can—and 
inevitably 
will—break 
the 
law 
and 
make 
law 
in 
its 
own 
favor 
and 
so 
produce 
instead 
injustice 
and 
moral 
corruption. 
And 
the 
State 
is 
supposed 
to 
protect 
the 
property 
of 
its 
subjects 
from 
foreign 
invasion, 
but 
with 
the 
power 
to 
tax 
its 
subjects 
it 
can—and 
inevitably 
will—expropriate 
the 
property 
of 
these 
subjects 
not, 
obviously 
enough, 
to 
protect 
them 
and 
their 
property, 
but 
to 
‘protect’ 
itself 
and 
its 
expropriations 
against 
any 
so-called 
“invader,” 
foreign 
or 
domestic. 
As 
an 
“expropriating 
property 
protector,” 
i.e., 
as 
a 
fundamentally 
“parasitic” 
institution, 
the 
State 
can 
never 
help 
but 
will 
always 
hinder 
in 
the 
production 
of 
wealth 
and 
so 
lower 
per 
capita 
incomes. 


In 
combination, 
then, 
with 
the 
following 
studies 
I 
hope 
to 
make 
a 
small 
contribution 
to 
the 
old 
tradition 
of 
grand 
social 
theory 
and 
render 
the 
long 
course 
of 
human 
history 
from 
its 
very 
beginnings 
to 
the 
present 
age 
more 
intelligible.

ON 
THE 
ORIGIN 
OF 
PRIVATE 
PROPERTY 
AND 
THE 
FAMILY 


I. 
THE 
SETTING: 
HISTORY 
IT 
IS 
REASONABLE 
TO 
BEGIN 
HUMAN 
HISTORY 
five 
million 
years 
ago, 
when 
the 
human 
line 
of 
evolutionary 
descent 
separated 
from 
that 
of 
our 
closest 
nonhuman 
relative, 
the 
chimpanzee. 
It 
is 
also 
reasonable 
to 
begin 
it 
2.5 
million 
years 
ago, 
with 
the 
first 
appearance 
of 
homo 
habilis; 
or 
200,000 
years 
ago, 
when 
the 
first 
representative 
of 
“anatomically 
modern 
man” 
made 
its 
appearance; 
or 
100,000 
years 
ago, 
when 
the 
anatomically 
modern 
man 
had 
become 
the 
standard 
human 
form. 
Instead, 
I 
want 
to 
begin 
only 
50,000 
years 
ago, 
when 
“anatomically 
modern 
man” 
had 
evolved 
into 
“behaviorally 
modern 
man.” 
This 
is 
an 
eminently 
reasonable 
starting 
point, 
too.[1] 


“Behaviorally 
modern 
human” 
refers 
to 
the 
existence 
of 
hunter-
gatherers, 
of 
which 
even 
today 
some 
small 
pockets 
have 
remained. 
Based 
on 
archeological 
evidence, 
humans 
living 
100,000 
years 
ago 
were 
apparently 
still 
largely 
inept 
at 
hunting. 
They 
were 
certainly 
unable 
to 
take 
down 
large 
and 
dangerous 
animals, 
and 
it 
appears 
that 
they 
did 
not 
know 
how 
to 
fish. 
Their 
tools 
were 
almost 
exclusively 
made 
of 
stone 
and 
wood 
and 
made 
of 
materials 
of 
local 
origin, 
indicating 
the 
absence 
of 
any 
distance 
travel 
or 
trading. 
In 
distinct 
contrast, 
about 
50,000 
years 
later 
the 
human 
toolkit 
took 
on 
a 
new, 
greatly 
advanced 
appearance. 
Other 
materials 
were 
used 
besides 
stone 
and 
wood: 
bone, 
antler, 
ivory, 
teeth, 
shells, 
and 
the 
materials 
often 
came 
from 
distant 
places. 
The 
tools, 
including 
knives, 
needles, 
barbed 
points, 
pins, 
borers 
and 
blades 
were 
more 
complex 
and 
skillfully 
crafted. 
The 
missile 
technology 
was 
much 
improved 
and 
indicated 
highly 
developed 
hunting 
skills 
(although 
bows 
were 
invented 
only 
about 
20,000 
years 
ago). 
As 
well, 
man 
knew 
how 
to 
fish 
and 
was 
apparently 
able 
to 
build 
boats. 
Moreover, 
next 
to 
plain, 
functional 
tools, 
seemingly 
purely 
artistic 
implements: 
ornaments, 



figurines 
and 
musical 
instruments, 
such 
as 
bird-bone 
flutes, 
appeared 
on 
the 
scene 
at 
this 
time. 


It 
has 
been 
hypothesized 
that 
what 
made 
this 
momentous 
development 
possible 
was 
a 
genetic 
change 
leading 
to 
the 
emergence 
of 
language, 
which 
involved 
a 
radical 
improvement 
in 
man’s 
ability 
to 
learn 
and 
innovate. 
The 
archaic 
humans—homo 
ergaster, 
homo 
neanderthalensis, 
homo 
erectus—did 
not 
have 
command 
of 
a 
language. 
To 
be 
sure, 
it 
can 
be 
safely 
assumed 
that 
they 
employed, 
as 
do 
many 
of 
the 
higher 
animals, 
the 
two 
so-called 
lower 
functions 
of 
language: 
the 
expressive 
or 
symptomatic 
function 
and 
the 
trigger 
or 
signal 
function.[2] 
However, 
they 
were 
apparently 
incapable 
of 
performing 
the 
two 
higher, 
cognitive 
functions 
of 
language: 
the 
descriptive 
and 
especially 
the 
argumentative 
function. 
These 
unique 
human 
abilities—so 
uniquely 
human 
indeed 
that 
one 
cannot 
think 
them 
‘away’ 
from 
our 
existence 
without 
falling 
into 
internal 
contradictions—of 
forming 
simple 
descriptive 
statements 
(propositions) 
such 
as 
“this 
(subject) 
is 
‘a’ 
(predicate),” 
which 
claim 
to 
be 
true, 
and 
especially 
of 
presenting 
arguments 
(chains 
of 
propositions) 
such 
as 
“this 
is 
‘a’; 
every 
‘a’ 
is 
‘b’; 
hence, 
this 
is 
‘b’,” 
which 
claim 
to 
be 
valid, 
emerged 
apparently 
only 
about 
50,000 
years 
ago.[3] 


Without 
language, 
human 
coordination 
had 
to 
occur 
via 
instincts, 
of 
which 
humans 
possess 
very 
few, 
or 
by 
means 
of 
physical 
direction 
or 
manipulation; 
and 
learning 
had 
to 
be 
either 
through 
imitation 
or 
by 
means 
of 
internal 
(implicit) 
inferences. 
In 
distinct 
contrast, 
with 
language—that 
is 
with 
words: 
sounds 
associated 
with 
and 
logically 
tied 
to 
certain 
objects 
and 
concepts 
(characteristics)—coordination 
could 
be 
achieved 
by 
mere 
symbols; 
and 
learning 
thus 
became 
independent 
of 
sense 
impressions 
(observations) 
and 
inferences 
could 
be 
made 
externally 
(explicitly) 
and 
hence 
became 
inter-
subjectively 
reproducible 
and 
controllable. 
That 
is, 
by 
means 
of 
language 
knowledge 
could 
be 
transmitted 
to 
distant 
places 
and 
times 
(it 
was 
no 
longer 
tied 
to 
perception); 
one 
could 
communicate 
about 
matters 
(knowledge 
acquired 
and 
accumulated) 
far 
away 
in 
time 
and 
place. 
And 
because 
our 
reasoning 
process, 
our 
train 
of 
thought 
leading 
us 
to 
certain 
inferences 
and 
conclusions 
became 
‘objectified’ 
in 
external, 
inter-subjectively 
ascertainable 
arguments 
it 
could 
not 
only 
be 
easily 
transferred 
through 
time 
and 
space 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
be 
publicly 
criticized, 
improved, 
and 
corrected. 
It 
is 
no 
wonder, 
then, 
that 
hand 
in 
hand 
with 
the 
emergence 
of 
language 
revolutionary 
changes 
in 
technology 
would 
come 
about. 



About 
100,000 
years 
ago, 
the 
population 
size 
of 
“modern 
humans,” 
our 
immediate 
predecessors, 
is 
estimated 
to 
have 
been 
around 
50,000, 
spread 
across 
the 
African 
continent 
and 
northward 
into 
the 
Middle 
East, 
the 
region 
of 
today’s 
Israel.[4] 
From 
about 
80,000 
to 
70,000 
years 
ago, 
the 
earth 
experienced 
a 
significant 
cooling 
period. 
As 
a 
consequence, 
the 
Neanderthals, 
who 
lived 
in 
Europe 
and 
in 
the 
course 
of 
many 
millennia 
had 
adjusted 
to 
cold 
climates 
moved 
southward, 
where 
they 
clashed 
with 
and 
apparently 
destroyed 
their 
African 
relatives 
in 
large 
numbers. 
In 
addition, 
an 
extended 
dry 
period 
beginning 
about 
60,000 
years 
ago 
robbed 
“modern 
man” 
of 
much 
of 
his 
subsistence 
basis, 
such 
that 
50,000 
years 
ago 
the 
number 
of 
“modern 
humans” 
may 
not 
have 
exceeded 
5,000, 
confined 
to 
northeast 
Africa.[5] 


However, 
from 
then 
on 
the 
rise 
of 
modern 
humans 
has 
been 
uninterrupted, 
spreading 
all 
across 
the 
globe 
and 
eventually 
displacing 
all 
of 
their 
archaic 
relatives. 
The 
last 
Neanderthals, 
holed 
up 
in 
some 
caves 
near 
Gibraltar, 
are 
believed 
to 
have 
become 
extinct 
about 
25,000 
years 
ago. 
The 
last 
remnants 
of 
homo 
erectus, 
found 
on 
the 
Indonesian 
island 
of 
Flores, 
date 
back 
about 
13,000 
years. 


The 
“modern 
humans” 
led 
a 
nomadic 
hunter-gatherer 
life-style. 
Societies 
were 
composed 
of 
small 
bands 
of 
people 
(10–30), 
which 
occasionally 
met 
and 
formed 
a 
common 
genetic 
pool 
of 
about 
150 
and 
may 
be 
up 
to 
500 
people 
(a 
size 
which 
geneticists 
have 
found 
to 
be 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
dysgenic 
effects[6]). 
The 
division 
of 
labor 
was 
limited, 
with 
the 
main 
partition 
being 
that 
between 
women—acting 
mostly 
as 
gatherers— 
and 
men—acting 
mostly 
as 
hunters. 
While 
private 
property 
of 
tools 
and 
implements 
was 
known 
and 
recognized, 
the 
nomadic 
lifestyle 
only 
allowed 
for 
little 
possessions 
and 
hence 
made 
hunter-gatherer 
societies 
comparatively 
egalitarian.[7] 
Nonetheless, 
life 
initially 
appears 
to 
have 
been 
good 
for 
our 
forebears.[8] 
Only 
a 
few 
hours 
of 
regular 
work 
allowed 
for 
a 
comfortable 
life, 
with 
good 
(high 
protein) 
nourishment 
and 
plenty 
of 
leisure 
time. 
Indeed, 
fossil 
findings 
(skeletons 
and 
teeth) 
seem 
to 
indicate 
that 
our 
hunter-gatherer 
forebears 
enjoyed 
a 
life 
expectancy 
of 
well 
above 
30 
years, 
which 
was 
only 
reached 
again 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century.[9] 
Contra 
Hobbes, 
their 
life 
was 
anything 
but 
nasty, 
brutish, 
and 
short.[10] 


However, 
the 
life 
of 
hunters 
and 
gatherers 
faced 
a 
fundamental 
and 
ultimately 
unanswerable 
challenge. 
Hunter-gatherer 
societies 
led 
essentially 



parasitic 
lives. 
That 
is, 
they 
did 
not 
add 
anything 
to 
the 
nature-given 
supply 
of 
goods. 
They 
only 
depleted 
the 
supply 
of 
goods. 
They 
did 
not 
produce 
(apart 
from 
a 
few 
tools) 
but 
only 
consumed. 
They 
did 
not 
grow 
and 
breed 
but 
had 
to 
wait 
for 
nature 
to 
regenerate 
and 
replenish. 
At 
best, 
what 
they 
accomplished 
was 
that 
they 
did 
not 
overhunt 
or 
overgather 
so 
that 
the 
natural 
regeneration 
process 
was 
not 
disturbed 
or 
even 
brought 
to 
an 
entire 
standstill. 
In 
any 
case, 
what 
this 
form 
of 
parasitism 
obviously 
involved, 
then, 
was 
the 
inescapable 
problem 
of 
population 
growth. 
In 
order 
to 
permit 
the 
comfortable 
life 
just 
described, 
the 
population 
density 
had 
to 
remain 
extremely 
low. 
It 
has 
been 
estimated 
that 
one 
square 
mile 
of 
territory 
was 
needed 
to 
comfortably 
sustain 
one 
to 
two 
persons, 
and 
in 
less 
fertile 
regions 
even 
larger 
territories 
were 
necessary.[11] 
So 
what 
was 
one 
to 
do 
when 
the 
population 
size 
exceeded 
these 
more 
or 
less 
narrow 
limits? 


People 
could 
of 
course 
try 
to 
prevent 
such 
population 
pressure 
from 
emerging, 
and 
indeed 
hunter-gatherer 
societies 
tried 
their 
best 
in 
this 
regard. 
They 
induced 
abortions, 
they 
engaged 
in 
infanticide, 
especially 
female 
infanticide, 
and 
they 
reduced 
the 
number 
of 
pregnancies 
by 
engaging 
in 
long 
periods 
of 
breast-feeding 
(which, 
in 
combination 
with 
the 
low 
body-fat 
characteristic 
of 
constantly 
mobile 
and 
moving 
women, 
reduces 
female 
fertility). 
Yet 
while 
this 
alleviated 
the 
problem 
it 
did 
not 
solve 
it. 
The 
population 
kept 
increasing. 


Given 
that 
the 
population 
size 
could 
not 
be 
maintained 
at 
a 
stationary 
level, 
only 
three 
alternatives 
existed 
for 
the 
steadily 
emerging 
“excess” 
population. 
One 
could 
fight 
over 
the 
limited 
food 
supplies, 
one 
could 
migrate, 
or 
one 
could 
invent 
and 
adopt 
a 
new, 
technologically 
advanced 
societal 
organization-mode 
that 
allowed 
for 
a 
larger 
population 
size 
to 
survive 
on 
the 
same, 
given 
territory. 


As 
for 
the 
first 
option, 
i.e., 
fighting, 
a 
few 
remarks 
shall 
suffice. 
In 
the 
literature, 
primitive 
man 
has 
been 
frequently 
described 
as 
peaceful 
and 
living 
in 
harmony 
with 
nature. 
Most 
popular 
in 
this 
regard 
is 
Rousseau’s 
portrayal 
of 
the 
“noble 
savage.” 
Aggression 
and 
war, 
it 
has 
been 
frequently 
held, 
were 
the 
result 
of 
civilization 
built 
upon 
the 
institution 
of 
private 
property. 
In 
fact, 
matters 
are 
almost 
exactly 
the 
reverse.[12] 
True, 
the 
savagery 
of 
modern 
wars 
has 
produced 
unparalleled 
carnage. 
Both 
World 
War 
I 
and 
World 
War 
II, 
for 
instance, 
resulted 
in 
tens 
of 
millions 
of 
deaths 
and 
left 
entire 
countries 
in 
ruins. 
And 
yet, 
as 
anthropological 
evidence 
has 
in 
the 
meantime 
made 



abundantly 
clear, 
primitive 
man 
has 
been 
considerably 
more 
warlike 
than 
contemporary 
man. 
It 
has 
been 
estimated 
that 
on 
the 
average 
some 
30 
percent 
of 
all 
males 
in 
primitive, 
hunter-gatherer 
societies 
died 
from 
unnatural— 
violent—causes, 
far 
exceeding 
anything 
experienced 
in 
this 
regard 
in 
modern 
societies.[13] 
According 
to 
Lawrence 
Keeley’s 
estimates, 
a 
tribal 
society 
on 
the 
average 
lost 
about 
0.5 
percent 
of 
its 
population 
in 
combat 
each 
year.[14] 
Applied 
to 
the 
population 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century 
this 
would 
amount 
to 
a 
casualty 
rate 
of 
some 
2 
billion 
people 
instead 
of 
the 
actual 
number 
of 
“merely” 
a 
few 
hundred 
million. 
Of 
course, 
primitive 
warfare 
was 
very 
different 
from 
modern 
warfare. 
It 
was 
not 
conducted 
by 
regular 
troops 
on 
battlefields, 
but 
by 
raids, 
ambushes, 
and 
surprise 
attacks. 
However, 
every 
attack 
was 
characterized 
by 
utmost 
brutality, 
carried 
out 
without 
mercy 
and 
always 
with 
deadly 
results; 
and 
while 
the 
number 
of 
people 
killed 
in 
each 
attack 
might 
have 
been 
small, 
the 
incessant 
nature 
of 
these 
aggressive 
encounters 
made 
violent 
death 
an 
ever-present 
danger 
for 
every 
man 
(and 
abduction 
and 
rape 
for 
every 
woman).[15] 
Moreover, 
increasing 
evidence 
for 
the 
widespread 
practice 
of 
cannibalism 
has 
been 
accumulated 
in 
recent 
times. 
Indeed, 
it 
appears 
that 
cannibalism 
was 
once 
upon 
a 
time 
an 
almost 
universal 
practice.[16] 


More 
importantly, 
these 
findings 
regarding 
primitive 
man’s 
war-likeness 
are 
not 
just 
anthropological 
curiosities, 
i.e., 
features 
that 
one 
might 
consider 
incidental 
to 
the 
true 
nature 
of 
hunter-gatherer 
societies. 
To 
the 
contrary, 
there 
exist 
fundamental 
theoretical 
reasons 
why 
such 
societies 
were 
characterized 
by 
incessant 
warfare 
and 
peaceful 
relations 
were 
almost 
impossible 
to 
attain, 
in 
particular 
if 
the 
possibility 
of 
evading 
one 
another 
was 
foreclosed 
because 
all 
surrounding 
land 
was 
occupied. 
Because 
then 
it 
became 
unavoidable 
that 
the 
members 
of 
different 
hunter-gatherer 
tribes 
encountered 
each 
other 
more 
or 
less 
regularly 
on 
their 
various 
expeditions 
in 
search 
of 
plants 
and 
animals. 
Indeed, 
as 
the 
population 
size 
increased 
such 
encounters 
became 
ever 
more 
frequent. 
And 
because 
hunters 
and 
gatherers 
did 
not 
add 
anything 
to 
the 
nature-given 
supply 
of 
goods 
but 
only 
consumed 
what 
was 
provided 
by 
nature, 
their 
competition 
for 
food 
was 
necessarily 
of 
an 
antagonistic 
nature: 
either 
I 
pick 
the 
berries 
or 
hunt 
a 
given 
animal 
or 
you 
do 
it. 
No 
or 
little 
trade 
and 
exchange 
between 
the 
members 
of 
different 
tribes 
existed, 
because 
the 
members 
of 
one 
tribe 
engaged 
in 
essentially 
the 
same 
activities 
as 
those 
of 
any 
other 
tribe 
and 
neither 
one 
accumulated 
any 
surplus 



of 
goods 
that 
could 
be 
exchanged 
for 
others’ 
surplus-goods. 
There 
existed 
only 
ineradicable 
conflict 
and 
the 
more 
conflict 
the 
more 
the 
population 
number 
in 
each 
tribe 
exceeded 
its 
optimum 
size. 
In 
this 
situation, 
where 
everything 
appropriated 
by 
one 
person 
(or 
tribe) 
was 
immediately 
consumed 
and 
the 
total 
supply 
of 
goods 
was 
strictly 
limited 
by 
natural 
forces, 
only 
deadly 
antagonism 
could 
exist 
between 
men. 
In 
the 
words 
of 
Ludwig 
von 
Mises, 
men 
became 
“deadly 
foes 
of 
one 
another, 
irreconcilable 
rivals 
in 
their 
endeavors 
to 
secure 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
scarce 
supply 
of 
means 
of 
sustenance 
provided 
by 
nature. 
Each 
man 
would 
have 
been 
forced 
to 
view 
all 
other 
men 
as 
his 
enemies; 
his 
craving 
for 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
his 
own 
appetites 
would 
have 
brought 
him 
into 
an 
implacable 
conflict 
with 
all 
his 
neighbors. 
No 
sympathy 
could 
possibly 
develop 
under 
such 
a 
state 
of 
affairs.”[17] 
Only 
the 
death 
of 
one’s 
rivals 
provided 
a 
solution 
to 
one’s 
own 
desire 
to 
survive. 
Indeed, 
to 
spare 
another 
man’s 
life 
would 
have 
left 
him 
equipped 
to 
create 
even 
more 
offspring 
and 
hence 
reduced 
one’s 
own 
future 
chance 
of 
survival 
still 
further.[18] 


The 
second 
available 
option 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
steadily 
re-emerging 
problem 
of 
excess 
population 
was 
migration. 
While 
by 
no 
means 
costless— 
after 
all 
one 
had 
to 
leave 
familiar 
for 
unfamiliar 
territories—migration 
(as 
compared 
to 
fighting) 
must 
have 
appeared 
frequently 
as 
the 
less 
costly 
option, 
especially 
as 
long 
as 
some 
open 
frontier 
existed. 
Hence, 
setting 
out 
from 
their 
homeland 
in 
East 
Africa, 
successively 
the 
entire 
globe 
was 
conquered 
by 
bands 
of 
people 
breaking 
away 
from 
their 
relatives 
to 
form 
new 
societies 
in 
areas 
hitherto 
unoccupied 
by 
humans. 


It 
appears 
that 
this 
process 
began 
also 
about 
50,000 
years 
ago, 
shortly 
after 
the 
emergence 
of 
behaviorally 
modern 
man 
and 
the 
acquisition 
of 
the 
ability 
to 
build 
boats. 
From 
about 
this 
time 
on 
until 
around 
12,000 
to 
11,000 
years 
ago 
global 
temperatures 
gradually 
fell 
(since 
then 
we 
are 
in 
an 
interglacial 
warming 
period) 
and 
the 
sea 
levels 
accordingly 
fell.[19] 
People 
crossed 
over 
the 
Red 
Sea 
at 
the 
Gate 
of 
Grief, 
which 
was 
then 
merely 
a 
narrow 
gap 
of 
water 
dotted 
with 
islands, 
to 
land 
at 
the 
southern 
tip 
of 
the 
Arabian 
peninsula 
(which 
enjoyed 
a 
comparatively 
wet 
period 
at 
that 
time). 
From 
there 
onward, 
preferring 
to 
stay 
in 
tropical 
climate 
zones 
to 
which 
one 
had 
been 
adjusted, 
the 
migration—of 
possibly 
not 
more 
than 
150 
people— 
continued 
eastward. 
Travel 
was 
mostly 
by 
boat, 
because 
until 
about 
6,000 
years 
ago 
when 
man 
learned 
how 
to 
tame 
horses, 
this 
form 
of 
transportation 



was 
much 
faster 
and 
more 
convenient 
than 
travel 
by 
foot. 
Hence, 
migration 
took 
place 
along 
the 
coastline—and 
proceeded 
from 
there 
into 
the 
interior 
through 
river 
valleys—first 
all 
the 
way 
to 
India. 
From 
there, 
as 
the 
genetic 
evidence 
seems 
to 
indicate, 
the 
population 
movement 
split 
into 
two 
directions. 
On 
the 
one 
hand 
it 
proceeded 
around 
the 
Indian 
peninsula 
to 
southeast 
Asia 
and 
Indonesia 
(which 
was 
then 
connected 
to 
the 
Asian 
mainland) 
and 
finally 
to 
the 
now 
foundered 
former 
continent 
of 
Sahul 
(of 
Australia, 
New 
Guinea, 
and 
Tasmania, 
which 
were 
joined 
until 
about 
8,000 
years 
ago), 
which 
was 
then 
only 
separated 
from 
the 
Asian 
mainland 
by 
a 
sixty 
mile 
wide 
channel 
of 
water 
dotted 
with 
islands 
permitting 
short-distance 
island 
hopping, 
as 
well 
as 
northward 
up 
the 
coast 
to 
China 
and 
eventually 
Japan. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
migration 
process 
went 
from 
India 
in 
a 
northwesterly 
direction, 
through 
Afghanistan, 
Iran, 
and 
Turkey 
and 
ultimately 
Europe. 
As 
well, 
splitting 
off 
of 
this 
stream 
of 
migration, 
people 
pressed 
in 
a 
northeasterly 
direction 
into 
southern 
Siberia. 
Later 
migrations, 
most 
likely 
in 
three 
waves, 
with 
the 
first 
about 
14,000–12,000 
years 
ago, 
went 
from 
Siberia 
across 
the 
Bering 
Strait—then 
(until 
about 
11,000 
years 
ago) 
a 
land 
bridge—and 
onto 
the 
American 
continent, 
apparently 
reaching 
Patagonia 
only 
about 
1,000 
years 
later 
(archeological 
findings 
of 
human 
remains 
in 
southern 
Chile 
have 
been 
dated 
as 
12,500 
years 
old). 
The 
last 
migration 
route 
set 
out 
from 
Taiwan, 
which 
was 
occupied 
about 
5,000 
years 
ago, 
sailing 
across 
the 
Pacific 
to 
reach 
the 
Polynesian 
islands 
and 
finally, 
only 
about 
800 
years 
ago, 
New 
Zealand.[20] 


The 
process 
was 
essentially 
always 
the 
same: 
a 
group 
invaded 
some 
territory, 
population 
pressure 
mounted, 
some 
people 
stayed 
put, 
a 
subgroup 
moved 
further 
on, 
generation 
after 
generation, 
along 
the 
coastline, 
following 
rivers 
and 
game 
and 
avoiding 
deserts 
and 
high 
mountains. 
The 
migration 
from 
Africa 
all 
the 
way 
to 
Australia 
may 
have 
taken 
about 
4,000 
to 
5,000 
years, 
and 
migration 
to 
Europe 
7,000 
years 
(the 
oldest 
artifacts 
there 
ascribed 
to 
modern 
humans, 
found 
in 
Bulgaria, 
date 
about 
43,000 
years 
back) 
and 
another 
7,000 
years 
to 
reach 
western 
Spain.[21] 
Once 
broken 
up, 
practically 
no 
contact 
existed 
between 
the 
various 
hunter-gatherer 
societies. 
Consequently, 
although 
initially 
closely 
related 
to 
one 
another 
through 
direct 
kinship 
relations, 
these 
societies 
formed 
separated 
genetic 
pools 
and, 
confronted 
with 
different 
natural 
environments 
and 
as 
the 
result 
of 
mutations 
and 
genetic 
drift 
interacting 
with 
natural 
selection, 
in 
the 
course 
of 
time 
they 



took 
on 
distinctly 
different 
appearances. 
By 
and 
large, 
the 
genetic 
difference 
between 
various 
societies 
increased 
in 
correlation 
with 
the 
spatial 
distance 
between 
societies 
and 
the 
duration 
of 
their 
separation 
time.[22] 
Different 
ethnicities 
emerged, 
and 
later 
also 
distinctly 
different 
human 
races. 
These 
emerging, 
genetically 
based 
differences 
concerned 
matters 
such 
as 
skin 
color, 
physical 
build 
and 
strength, 
resistance 
to 
cold 
temperatures 
and 
to 
various 
diseases, 
and 
tolerance 
vis-à-vis 
certain 
substances. 
They 
also 
concerned 
cognitive 
matters, 
however. 
Thus, 
genetic 
evidence 
exists 
for 
two 
significant 
further 
developments 
regarding 
the 
size 
and 
cognitive 
powers 
of 
the 
human 
brain. 
One 
such 
development 
occurred 
about 
37,000 
years 
ago 
and 
affected 
most 
of 
the 
population 
in 
Europe 
as 
well 
as 
in 
East 
Asia 
(but 
left 
very 
few 
traces 
in 
Africa), 
and 
another 
occurred 
about 
6,000 
years 
ago 
and 
affected 
mostly 
people 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
Europe 
(but 
had 
less 
impact 
in 
East 
Asia 
and 
almost 
none 
in 
sub-Saharan 
Africa).[23] 


Moreover, 
hand 
in 
hand 
with 
the 
geographical 
and 
correlated 
genetic 
differentiation 
of 
humans 
went 
a 
linguistic 
differentiation. 
Very 
much 
in 
agreement 
with 
and 
supported 
by 
genetic 
(biological) 
evidence, 
some 
linguists, 
in 
particular 
Merritt 
Ruhlen,[24] 
following 
in 
the 
footsteps 
of 
the 
pioneering 
work 
of 
Joseph 
Greenberg, 
have 
made 
the 
plausible 
case 
for 
a 
single 
human 
proto-language, 
from 
which 
all 
human 
languages 
can 
be 
derived 
as 
more 
or 
less 
distant 
relatives. 
Obviously, 
the 
original 
emigrants 
from 
the 
African 
homeland, 
some 
50,000 
years 
ago, 
would 
have 
spoken 
the 
same 
language, 
and 
so 
it 
seems 
hardly 
surprising 
that 
the 
above-sketched 
population 
movement, 
and 
the 
splitting 
of 
groups 
of 
people 
into 
different 
genetic 
pools, 
more 
or 
less 
separated 
in 
time 
and 
space 
from 
one 
another, 
should 
be 
closely 
mirrored 
by 
a 
differentiation 
of 
languages, 
the 
grouping 
of 
different 
languages 
into 
language 
families, 
and 
the 
grouping 
of 
these 
into 
still 
larger 
super-families.[25] 
Likewise, 
the 
process 
of 
the 
proliferation 
of 
languages 
appears 
to 
have 
followed 
a 
predictable 
pattern. 
First, 
with 
the 
spread 
of 
humans 
around 
the 
world 
as 
hunters 
and 
gatherers 
and 
the 
concomitant 
proliferation 
of 
distinct, 
separated 
genetic 
pools, 
a 
successively 
increasing 
number 
of 
different 
languages 
emerged. 
Thus, 
for 
instance, 
of 
the 
6,000 
different 
languages 
still 
spoken 
today, 
some 
1,200 
languages 
are 
spoken 
in 
New 
Guinea, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
“primitive” 
remaining 
world 
regions, 
half 
of 
which 
have 
no 
more 
than 
the 
“magic” 
number 
of 
500 
speakers 
and 
none 
more 
than 
100,000. 
Then, 
however, 
with 
the 
beginning 
of 
human 



settlement 
some 
11,000 
years 
ago 
and 
the 
following 
transition 
to 
agriculture 
and 
the 
attendant 
expansion 
and 
intensification 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
(more 
on 
which 
later 
on), 
a 
countervailing 
and 
even 
contrary 
tendency 
appears 
to 
have 
come 
into 
existence: 
just 
as 
the 
genetic 
pools 
appear 
to 
have 
widened, 
so 
the 
number 
of 
different 
languages 
spoken 
has 
successively 
diminished. 


II. 
THE 
PROBLEM: 
THEORY 
About 
35,000 
years 
ago, 
i.e., 
15,000 
years 
after 
the 
initial 
exodus 
from 
Africa, 
practically 
all 
of 
Europe, 
Asia, 
Australia 
and, 
of 
course, 
Africa 
itself 
had 
been 
occupied 
by 
our 
ancestors, 
the 
modern 
humans, 
and 
archaic 
humans: 
homo 
neanderthalensis 
and 
homo 
erectus, 
were 
on 
the 
verge 
of 
extinction. 
About 
12,000 
years 
ago, 
humans 
had 
also 
spread 
all 
across 
the 
Americas. 
Apart 
from 
the 
Polynesian 
islands, 
then, 
all 
land 
and 
all 
of 
the 
naturally 
given 
supply 
of 
earthly 
(economic) 
goods: 
of 
plants 
and 
animals 
had 
been 
taken 
into 
human 
possession; 
and, 
given 
the 
parasitic 
lifestyle 
of 
hunter-gatherers, 
humans 
did 
not 
add 
anything 
to 
this 
land 
and 
the 
nature-
given 
supply 
of 
goods 
but 
merely 
reacted 
to 
natural 
changes. 


These 
changes 
were 
at 
times 
quite 
drastic. 
Changes 
in 
global 
climate, 
for 
instance, 
could 
and 
did 
significantly 
affect 
how 
much 
inhabitable 
land 
was 
available 
and 
the 
natural 
vegetation 
and 
animal 
population. 
In 
the 
time 
period 
under 
consideration, 
in 
the 
20,000 
plus 
years 
between 
35,000 
and 
11,000 
years 
ago, 
drastic 
changes 
in 
such 
natural 
conditions 
occurred. 
20,000 
years 
ago, 
for 
instance, 
during 
the 
period 
known 
as 
the 
Last 
Glacial 
Maximum, 
temperatures 
fell 
sharply 
and 
most 
of 
Northern 
Europe 
and 
Siberia 
became 
uninhabitable. 
Britain 
and 
all 
of 
Scandinavia 
was 
covered 
by 
glaciers, 
most 
of 
Siberia 
turned 
into 
polar 
desert 
and 
steppe-tundra 
extended 
as 
far 
south 
as 
the 
Mediterranean, 
the 
Black 
Sea, 
and 
the 
Caspian 
Sea. 
After 
5,000 
years, 
about 
15,000 
years 
ago, 
the 
glaciers 
began 
to 
retreat, 
allowing 
people, 
animals, 
and 
plants 
to 
re-occupy 
previously 
deserted 
regions. 
Twenty-five 
hundred 
years 
later, 
however, 
within 
merely 
a 
decade, 
temperatures 
again 
plummeted 
back 
to 
almost 
the 
previous 
frigid 
conditions; 
and 
only 
another 
1,000 
years 
later, 
about 
11,500 
years 
ago, 
and 
again 
quite 
suddenly, 
did 
temperatures 
then 
experience 
a 
long-sustained 
increase 
and 
the 
earth 
entered 
the 
so-called 
Holocene, 
the 
latest 
and 
still 
lasting 
interglacial 
warming 
period. 


[26] 
(The 
Sahara 
began 
to 
turn 
into 
the 
present, 
extremely 
hot 
desert 
only 
less 

than 
3,000 
years 
ago. 
In 
pre-Roman 
times, 
the 
Sahara—and 
similarly 
the 
central 
Asian 
deserts—was 
still 
a 
green 
savanna 
with 
an 
abundant 
supply 
of 
wildlife. 
The 
power 
and 
the 
attraction 
of 
Carthage, 
for 
instance, 
was 
based 
largely 
on 
the 
fertility 
of 
its 
hinterland 
as 
a 
center 
of 
wheat 
production; 
this 
fact 
was 
an 
important 
reason 
for 
Rome’s 
desire 
to 
destroy 
Carthage 
and 
gain 
control 
of 
its 
North 
African 
territories.[27]) 


In 
any 
case 
and 
regardless 
of 
all 
complicating 
details 
and 
all 
changes 
that 
future 
empirical 
researches 
will 
no 
doubt 
bring 
about 
concerning 
the 
foregoing 
historical 
narrative, 
at 
some 
point 
in 
time 
the 
landmass 
available 
to 
help 
satisfy 
human 
needs 
could 
no 
longer 
be 
enlarged. 
In 
economic 
jargon, 
the 
supply 
of 
the 
production 
factor 
“land” 
became 
fixed, 
and 
every 
increase 
in 
the 
size 
of 
the 
human 
population 
had 
to 
be 
sustained 
by 
the 
same, 
unchanged 
quantity 
of 
land. 
Of 
the 
formerly 
three 
available 
options 
in 
response 
to 
an 
increasing 
population 
pressure: 
to 
move, 
to 
fight, 
or 
to 
invent, 
only 
the 
latter 
two 
remained 
open. 
What 
to 
do 
when 
faced 
with 
this 
challenge? 


To 
bring 
the 
problem 
faced 
into 
even 
sharper 
relief 
it 
is 
useful 
to 
first 
take 
another, 
more 
detailed 
look 
at 
the 
admittedly 
rather 
limited 
extent 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
within 
a 
hunter-gatherer 
society. 


So 
far 
the 
antagonism 
between 
the 
members 
of 
different 
bands 
or 
clans 
has 
been 
explained 
while 
it 
has 
been 
taken 
for 
granted 
that 
within 
a 
given 
band 
or 
clan 
collaboration—peaceful 
cooperation—exists. 
But 
why 
should 
this 
be 
so? 
Intra-group 
cooperation 
is 
almost 
universally 
assumed 
as 
a 
matterof-
course. 
Nonetheless, 
it 
too 
requires 
an 
explanation, 
because 
a 
world 
without 
even 
this 
limited 
degree 
of 
cooperation 
is 
certainly 
conceivable. 
To 
be 
sure, 
there 
exists 
a 
biological 
basis 
for 
some 
forms 
of 
human 
cooperation. 
“The 
mutual 
sexual 
attraction 
of 
male 
and 
female,” 
writes 
Mises, 
“is 
inherent 
in 
man’s 
animal 
nature 
and 
independent 
of 
any 
thinking 
and 
theorizing. 
It 
is 
permissible 
to 
call 
it 
original, 
vegetative, 
instinctive, 
or 
mysterious.”[28] 
The 
same 
can 
be 
said 
about 
the 
relationship 
between 
mother 
and 
child. 
If 
mothers 
would 
not 
take 
care 
of 
their 
offspring 
for 
an 
extended 
period 
of 
time, 
their 
children 
would 
instantly 
die 
and 
mankind 
would 
be 
doomed. 
However, 
this 
necessary, 
biologically 
determined 
degree 
of 
cooperation 
is 
a 
far 
cry 
from 
that 
actually 
observed 
in 
hunter-gatherer 
societies. 
Thus, 
Mises 
continues, 


neither 
cohabitation, 
nor 
what 
precedes 
it 
or 
follows, 



generates 
social 
cooperation 
and 
societal 
modes 
of 
life. 
The 
animals 
too 
join 
together 
in 
mating, 
but 
they 
have 
not 
developed 
social 
relations. 
Family 
life 
is 
not 
merely 
a 
product 
of 
sexual 
intercourse. 
It 
is 
by 
no 
means 
natural 
and 
necessary 
that 
parents 
and 
children 
live 
together 
in 
the 
way 
they 
do 
in 
the 
family. 
The 
mating 
relation 
need 
not 
result 
in 
a 
family 
organization. 
The 
human 
family 
is 
an 
outcome 
of 
thinking, 
planning, 
and 
acting. 
It 
is 
this 
fact 
which 
distinguishes 
it 
radically 
from 
those 
animal 
groups 
which 
we 
call 
per 
analogiam 
animal 
families.[29] 


Why, 
for 
instance, 
did 
not 
each 
man 
and 
each 
woman, 
after 
they 
had 
left 
infancy, 
hunt 
or 
gather 
alone 
only 
to 
meet 
for 
occasional 
sex? 
Why 
did 
it 
not 
occur 
what 
has 
been 
described 
as 
having 
occurred 
for 
groups 
of 
humans 
already 
on 
the 
level 
of 
individuals: 
one 
person, 
faced 
with 
a 
strictly 
limited 
supply 
of 
nature-given 
goods, 
breaking 
away 
from 
another 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
conflict 
until 
all 
land 
was 
taken 
into 
possession 
and 
then 
a 
war 
of 
everyone 
against 
everyone 
else 
(rather 
than 
merely 
a 
war 
of 
the 
members 
of 
one 
group 
against 
the 
members 
of 
all 
other 
groups) 
breaking 
out? 
The 
answer 
to 
this 
is: 
because 
of 
the 
recognition 
that 
cooperation 
was 
more 
productive 
than 
isolated, 
self-sufficient 
action. 
Division 
of 
labor 
and 
cooperation 
based 
on 
such 
division 
of 
labor 
increased 
the 
productivity 
of 
human 
labor. 


There 
are 
three 
reasons 
for 
this: 
First, 
there 
exist 
tasks 
which 
exceed 
the 
powers 
of 
any 
single 
man 
and 
require 
instead 
the 
combined 
efforts 
of 
several 
men 
in 
order 
to 
be 
successfully 
executed. 
Certain 
animals, 
for 
instance, 
might 
be 
too 
large 
or 
too 
dangerous 
to 
be 
hunted 
by 
single 
individuals 
but 
require 
the 
cooperative 
engagement 
of 
many. 
Or 
there 
exist 
tasks 
which 
could, 
in 
principle, 
be 
executed 
by 
a 
single 
individual 
but 
that 
would 
take 
up 
so 
much 
time 
for 
an 
isolated 
actor 
that 
the 
final 
result 
does 
not 
appear 
worth 
the 
effort. 
Only 
concerted 
action 
can 
accomplish 
these 
tasks 
in 
a 
time 
span 
sufficiently 
short 
in 
order 
to 
deem 
the 
task 
worthwhile. 
Searching 
for 
edible 
plants 
or 
animals, 
for 
instance, 
is 
fraught 
with 
uncertainties. 
On 
one 
day 
one 
might 
stumble 
across 
suitable 
plants 
or 
animals 
quickly, 
but 
at 
another 
time 
one 
might 
search 
for 
them 
in 
vain 
seemingly 
without 
end. 
But 
if 
one 
pools 
this 
risk, 
i.e., 
if 
a 
large 
number 
of 
gatherers 
or 
hunters 
begin 
their 
search 
separately 
only 
to 
call 
upon 
each 
other 
once 
anyone 
of 
them 
has 
turned 
out 
to 



be 
lucky 
in 
his 
search, 
then 
gathering 
and 
hunting 
might 
be 
turned 
into 
routinely 
successful 
endeavors 
for 
each 
participant. 


Second: 
Even 
though 
the 
natural 
environment 
faced 
by 
each 
person 
might 
be 
more 
or 
less 
the 
same, 
each 
individual 
(even 
identical 
twins) 
is 
different 
from 
any 
other. 
Men, 
for 
instance, 
are 
significantly 
different 
in 
their 
abilities 
than 
women. 
By 
their 
very 
nature, 
men 
are 
typically 
better 
hunters 
and 
women 
better 
gatherers. 
Adults 
are 
significantly 
different 
in 
their 
abilities 
than 
kids. 
Some 
people 
are 
physically 
strong 
and 
others 
show 
great 
dexterity. 
Some 
are 
tall 
and 
others 
are 
quick. 
Some 
have 
great 
vision 
and 
others 
a 
good 
sense 
of 
smell. 
Given 
such 
differences 
it 
is 
obviously 
advantageous 
to 
partition 
the 
various 
tasks 
necessary 
to 
perform 
in 
order 
to 
secure 
a 
comfortable 
life 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
each 
person 
specializes 
in 
those 
activities 
in 
which 
he 
has 
an 
advantage 
over 
others. 
Women 
gather 
and 
men 
hunt. 
Tall 
individuals 
pick 
fruits 
from 
trees 
and 
short 
ones 
specialize 
in 
hunting 
mushrooms. 
Quick 
runners 
relay 
messages. 
Individuals 
with 
good 
eyesight 
will 
spot 
distant 
events. 
Kids 
are 
used 
for 
the 
exploration 
of 
small 
and 
narrow 
holes. 
People 
with 
great 
dexterity 
produce 
tools. 
The 
strong 
will 
specialize 
in 
going 
in 
for 
the 
kill, 
etc. 


Third: 
Moreover, 
even 
if 
the 
members 
of 
one 
tribe 
are 
so 
distinguished 
from 
one 
another 
that 
one 
person 
is 
more 
efficient 
in 
every 
conceivable 
task 
than 
another, 
division 
of 
labor 
is 
still 
all-around 
more 
productive 
than 
isolated 
labor. 
An 
adult 
might 
be 
better 
at 
any 
task 
than 
a 
kid, 
for 
instance. 
Given 
the 
inescapable 
fact 
of 
the 
scarcity 
of 
time, 
however, 
even 
in 
this 
conceivably 
worst-case 
scenario 
it 
makes 
economic 
sense—that 
is, 
it 
leads 
to 
a 
greater 
physical 
output 
of 
goods 
produced 
per 
unit 
of 
labor—if 
the 
adult 
specializes 
in 
those 
tasks 
in 
which 
his 
greater 
efficiency 
(as 
compared 
to 
that 
of 
the 
kid) 
is 
particularly 
pronounced 
and 
leaves 
those 
tasks 
for 
the 
kid 
to 
perform 
in 
which 
the 
latter’s 
all-around 
lower 
efficiency 
is 
comparatively 
smaller. 
Even 
though 
the 
adult 
might 
be 
more 
efficient 
than 
the 
child 
in 
collecting 
small 
firewood, 
for 
instance, 
the 
adult’s 
far 
greater 
superiority 
in 
hunting 
large 
game 
would 
make 
it 
a 
waste 
of 
his 
time 
to 
gather 
wood. 
Instead, 
he 
would 
want 
the 
child 
to 
collect 
fire 
wood 
and 
use 
all 
of 
his 
own 
precious 
time 
to 
perform 
that 
task 
in 
which 
his 
greater 
efficiency 
is 
especially 
marked, 
namely 
large 
game 
hunting. 


Nonetheless: 
While 
these 
advantages 
offered 
by 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
can 
explain 
intratribal 
cooperation 
(rather 
than 
fight) 
and, 
based 
on 
such 



initially 
maybe 
purely 
“selfishly-motivated” 
collaboration, 
the 
gradual 
development 
of 
feelings 
of 
sympathy 
(good 
will) 
toward 
one’s 
fellowmen, 
which 
go 
above 
and 
beyond 
whatever 
biological 
basis 
there 
may 
exist 
for 
the 
special, 
more-than-normally-friendly 
relationship 
between 
close 
kin, 
this 
explanation 
still 
only 
goes 
so 
far. 
Given 
the 
peculiar, 
parasitic 
nature 
of 
hunter-gatherer 
societies 
and 
assuming 
land 
to 
be 
fixed, 
invariably 
the 
moment 
must 
arise 
when 
the 
number 
of 
people 
exceeds 
the 
optimal 
group 
size 
and 
average 
living 
standards 
will 
fall, 
threatening 
whatever 
degree 
of 
intragroup 
solidarity 
previously 
might 
have 
existed.[30] 


This 
situation 
is 
captured 
and 
explained 
by 
the 
economic 
law 
of 
returns. 


The 
law 
of 
returns, 
popularly 
but 
somewhat 
misleadingly 
also 
called 
the 
law 
of 
diminishing 
returns, 
states 
that 
for 
any 
combination 
of 
two 
or 
more 
production 
factors 
an 
optimum 
combination 
exists 
(such 
that 
any 
deviation 
from 
it 
involves 
material 
waste, 
or 
“efficiency 
losses”).[31] 
Applied 
to 
the 
two 
original 
factors 
of 
production, 
labor 
and 
land 
(nature-given 
goods), 
the 
law 
implies 
that 
if 
one 
were 
to 
increase 
the 
quantity 
of 
labor 
(population) 
while 
the 
quantity 
of 
land 
and 
the 
available 
technology 
(hunting 
and 
gathering) 
remained 
fixed, 
eventually 
a 
point 
will 
be 
reached 
where 
the 
physical 
output 
per 
labor-unit 
input 
is 
maximized. 
This 
point 
marks 
the 
optimal 
population 
size. 
If 
there 
is 
no 
additional 
land 
available 
and 
technology 
remains 
fixed 
at 
a 
‘given’ 
level, 
any 
population 
increase 
beyond 
the 
optimal 
size 
will 
lead 
to 
a 
progressive 
decline 
in 
per 
capita 
income. 
Living 
standards, 
on 
the 
average, 
will 
fall. 
A 
point 
of 
(absolute) 
overpopulation 
has 
been 
reached. 
This 
is, 
as 
Mises 
has 
termed 
it, 
the 
Malthusian 
law 
of 
population. 


Because 
of 
the 
fundamental 
importance 
of 
this 
Malthusian 
law 
of 
population 
and 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
any 
possible 
misunderstanding, 
it 
is 
advisable 
to 
make 
also 
explicit 
what 
the 
law 
does 
not 
state. 
The 
law 
does 
not 
assert 
where 
exactly 
this 
optimal 
combination 
point 
lies—at 
so-and-so 
many 
people 
per 
square 
mile, 
for 
instance—but 
only 
that 
such 
a 
point 
exists. 
Otherwise, 
if 
every 
quantity 
of 
output 
could 
be 
produced 
by 
increasing 
only 
one 
factor 
(labor) 
while 
leaving 
the 
other 
(land) 
unchanged, 
the 
latter 
(land) 
would 
cease 
to 
be 
scarce—and 
hence 
an 
economic 
good—at 
all; 
one 
could 
increase 
without 
limit 
the 
return 
of 
any 
piece 
of 
land 
by 
simply 
increasing 
the 
input 
of 
labor 
applied 
to 
this 
piece 
without 
ever 
having 
to 
consider 
expanding 
the 
size 
of 
one’s 
land). 
The 
law 
also 
does 
not 
state 
that 
every 
increase 
of 
one 



factor 
(labor) 
applied 
to 
a 
fixed 
quantity 
of 
another 
(land) 
must 
lead 
to 
a 
less 
than 
proportional 
increase 
of 
the 
output 
produced. 
In 
fact, 
as 
one 
approaches 
the 
optimum 
combination 
point 
an 
increase 
of 
labor 
applied 
to 
a 
given 
piece 
of 
land 
might 
lead 
to 
a 
more 
than 
proportional 
increase 
of 
output 
(increasing 
returns). 
One 
additional 
man, 
for 
instance, 
might 
make 
it 
possible 
that 
an 
animal 
species 
can 
be 
hunted 
that 
cannot 
be 
hunted 
at 
all 
without 
this 
one 
extra 
hunter. 
The 
law 
of 
returns 
merely 
states 
that 
this 
cannot 
occur 
without 
definite 
limits. 
Nor 
does 
the 
law 
assert 
that 
the 
optimum 
combination 
point 
cannot 
be 
shifted 
upward 
and 
outward. 
In 
fact, 
as 
will 
be 
explained 
in 
the 
following, 
owing 
to 
technological 
advances 
the 
optimum 
combination 
point 
can 
be 
so 
moved, 
allowing 
a 
larger 
population 
to 
enjoy 
a 
higher 
average 
living 
standard 
on 
the 
same 
quantity 
of 
land. 
What 
the 
law 
of 
returns 
does 
say 
is 
only 
that 
given 
a 
state 
of 
technological 
development 
(mode 
of 
production) 
and 
a 
corresponding 
degree 
of 
specialization, 
an 
optimum 
combination 
point 
exists 
beyond 
which 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
supply 
of 
labor 
must 
necessarily 
lead 
to 
a 
less 
than 
proportional 
increase 
of 
the 
output 
produced 
or 
no 
increase 
at 
all. 


Indeed, 
for 
hunter-gatherer 
societies 
the 
difficulties 
of 
escaping 
the 
Malthusian 
trap 
of 
absolute 
overpopulation 
are 
even 
more 
severe 
than 
these 
qualifications 
regarding 
the 
law 
of 
returns 
might 
indicate. 
For 
while 
these 
qualifications 
might 
leave 
the 
impression 
that 
it 
is 
“only” 
a 
technological 
innovation 
that 
is 
needed 
to 
escape 
the 
trap, 
this 
is 
not 
the 
full 
truth. 
Not 
just 
any 
technological 
innovation 
will 
do. 
Because 
hunter-gatherer 
societies 
are, 
as 
explained, 
“parasitic” 
societies, 
which 
do 
not 
add 
anything 
to 
the 
supply 
of 
goods 
but 
merely 
appropriate 
and 
consume 
what 
nature 
provides, 
any 
productivity 
increase 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
this 
mode 
of 
production 
does 
not 
(or 
only 
insignificantly 
so) 
result 
in 
a 
greater 
output 
of 
goods 
produced 
(of 
plants 
gathered 
or 
animals 
hunted) 
but 
rather 
merely 
(or 
mostly) 
in 
a 
reduction 
of 
the 
time 
necessary 
to 
produce 
an 
essentially 
unchanged 
quantity 
of 
output. 
The 
invention 
of 
bow 
and 
arrow 
that 
appears 
to 
have 
been 
made 
some 
20,000 
years 
ago, 
for 
instance, 
will 
not 
so 
much 
lead 
to 
a 
greater 
quantity 
of 
available 
animal 
meat 
to 
consume, 
thus 
allowing 
a 
larger 
number 
of 
people 
to 
reach 
or 
exceed 
a 
given 
level 
of 
consumption, 
but 
rather 
only 
to 
the 
same 
number 
of 
people 
enjoying 
more 
leisure 
with 
an 
unchanged 
standard 
of 
living 
in 
terms 
of 
meat 
consumption 
(or 
else, 
if 
the 
population 
increases, 
the 
gain 
of 
more 
leisure 
time 
will 
have 
to 
be 
paid 
for 
by 
a 
reduction 



in 
meat 
consumption 
per 
capita). 
In 
fact, 
for 
hunter-gatherers 
the 
productivity 
gains 
achieved 
by 
technological 
advances 
such 
as 
the 
invention 
of 
bow 
and 
arrow 
may 
well 
turn 
out 
to 
be 
no 
blessing 
at 
all 
or 
only 
a 
very 
short-term 
blessing. 
Because 
the 
greater 
ease 
of 
hunting 
that 
is 
thus 
brought 
about, 
for 
instance, 
may 
lead 
to 
overhunting, 
increasing 
the 
supply 
of 
meat 
per 
capita 
in 
the 
short-run, 
but 
diminishing 
or 
possibly 
eliminating 
the 
meat 
supply 
in 
the 
long-run 
by 
reducing 
the 
natural 
rate 
of 
animal 
reproduction 
or 
hunting 
animals 
to 
extinction 
and 
thus 
magnifying 
the 
Malthusian 
problem, 
even 
without 
any 
increase 
in 
population 
size.[32] 


III. 
THE 
SOLUTION: 
THEORY 
AND 
HISTORY 
The 
technological 
invention, 
then, 
that 
solved 
(at 
least 
temporarily[33]) 
the 
problem 
of 
a 
steadily 
emerging 
and 
re-emerging 
“excess” 
of 
population 
and 
the 
attendant 
fall 
of 
average 
living 
standards 
was 
a 
revolutionary 
change 
in 
the 
entire 
mode 
of 
production. 
It 
involved 
the 
change 
from 
a 
parasitic 
lifestyle 
to 
a 
genuinely 
productive 
life. 
Instead 
of 
merely 
appropriating 
and 
consuming 
what 
nature 
had 
provided, 
consumer 
goods 
were 
now 
actively 
produced 
and 
nature 
was 
augmented 
and 
improved 
upon. 


This 
revolutionary 
change 
in 
the 
human 
mode 
of 
production 
is 
generally 
referred 
to 
as 
the 
“Neolithic 
Revolution”: 
the 
transition 
from 
food 
production 
by 
hunting 
and 
gathering 
to 
food 
production 
by 
the 
raising 
of 
plants 
and 
animals.[34] 
It 
began 
about 
11,000 
years 
ago 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
in 
the 
region 
typically 
referred 
to 
as 
the 
“Fertile 
Crescent.” 
The 
same 
invention 
was 
made 
again, 
seemingly 
independently, 
less 
than 
2,000 
years 
later 
in 
central 
China, 
and 
again 
a 
few 
thousand 
years 
later 
(about 
5,000 
years 
ago) 
also 
in 
the 
Western 
hemisphere: 
in 
Mesoamerica, 
in 
South 
America, 
and 
in 
the 
eastern 
part 
of 
today’s 
United 
States. 
From 
these 
centers 
of 
innovation 
the 
new 
technology 
then 
spread 
to 
conquer 
practically 
the 
entire 
earth. 


The 
new 
technology 
represented 
a 
fundamental 
cognitive 
achievement 
and 
was 
reflected 
and 
expressed 
in 
two 
interrelated 
institutional 
innovations, 
which 
from 
then 
on 
until 
today 
have 
become 
the 
dominant 
feature 
of 
human 
life: 
the 
appropriation 
and 
employment 
of 
ground 
land 
as 
private 
property, 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
family 
and 
the 
family 
household. 


To 
understand 
these 
institutional 
innovations 
and 
the 
cognitive 
achievement 
underlying 
them 
one 
must 
first 
take 
a 
look 
at 
the 
treatment 
of 



the 
production 
factor 
“land” 
by 
hunter-gatherer 
societies. 


It 
can 
be 
safely 
assumed 
that 
private 
property 
existed 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
a 
tribal 
household. 
Private 
property 
certainly 
existed 
with 
regard 
to 
things 
such 
as 
personal 
clothing, 
tools, 
implements, 
and 
ornaments. 
To 
the 
extent 
that 
such 
items 
were 
produced 
by 
particular, 
identifiable 
individuals 
or 
acquired 
by 
others 
from 
their 
original 
makers 
through 
either 
gift 
or 
exchange 
they 
were 
considered 
individual 
property. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
goods 
were 
the 
results 
of 
some 
concerted 
or 
joint 
effort 
they 
were 
considered 
collective 
household 
goods. 
This 
applied 
most 
definitely 
to 
the 
means 
of 
sustenance: 
to 
the 
berries 
gathered 
and 
the 
game 
hunted 
as 
the 
result 
of 
some 
intratribal 
division 
of 
labor. 
Without 
doubt, 
then, 
collective 
property 
played 
a 
highly 
prominent 
role 
in 
hunter-gatherer 
societies, 
and 
it 
is 
because 
of 
this 
that 
the 
term 
“primitive 
communism” 
has 
been 
often 
employed 
to 
describe 
primitive, 
tribal 
economies: 
each 
individual 
contributed 
to 
the 
household 
income 
“according 
to 
his 
abilities,” 
and 
each 
received 
from 
the 
collective 
income 
“according 
to 
his 
needs” 
(as 
determined 
by 
the 
existing 
hierarchies 
within 
the 
group)—not 
quite 
unlike 
the 
“communism” 
in 
“modern” 
households. 


Yet 
what 
about 
the 
ground 
land 
on 
which 
all 
group 
activities 
took 
place? 
One 
may 
safely 
rule 
out 
that 
ground 
land 
was 
considered 
private 
property 
in 
hunter-gatherer 
societies. 
But 
was 
it 
collective 
property? 
This 
has 
been 
typically 
assumed 
to 
be 
the 
case, 
almost 
as 
a 
matter-of-course. 
However, 
the 
question 
is 
in 
fact 
more 
complicated, 
because 
a 
third 
alternative 
exists: 
that 
ground 
land 
was 
neither 
private 
nor 
collective 
property 
but 
instead 
constituted 
part 
of 
the 
environment 
or 
more 
specifically 
the 
general 
conditions 
of 
action 
or 
what 
has 
also 
been 
called 
“common 
property” 
or 
in 
short 
“the 
commons.”[35] 


In 
order 
to 
decide 
this 
question 
standard 
anthropological 
research 
is 
of 
little 
or 
no 
help. 
Instead, 
some 
elementary 
as 
well 
as 
fundamental 
economic 
theory, 
including 
a 
few 
precise 
definitions, 
is 
required. 
The 
external 
world 
in 
which 
man’s 
actions 
take 
place 
can 
be 
divided 
into 
two 
categorically 
distinct 
parts. 
One 
the 
one 
hand, 
there 
are 
those 
things 
that 
are 
considered 
means—or 
economic 
goods; 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
there 
are 
those 
things 
that 
are 
considered 
environment—or 
also 
referred 
to 
sometimes, 
if 
somewhat 
misleadingly, 
as 
free 
goods. 
The 
requirements 
for 
an 
element 
of 
the 
external 
world 
to 
be 
classified 
as 
a 
means 
or 
an 
economic 
good 
have 
been 
first 



identified 
with 
all 
due 
precision 
by 
Carl 
Menger.[36] 
They 
are 
threefold. 
First, 
in 
order 
for 
something 
to 
become 
an 
economic 
good 
(henceforth 
simply: 
a 
good), 
there 
must 
be 
a 
human 
need 
(an 
unachieved 
end 
or 
an 
unfulfilled 
human 
desire 
or 
want). 
Second, 
there 
must 
be 
the 
human 
perception 
of 
a 
thing 
believed 
to 
be 
equipped 
or 
endowed 
with 
properties 
or 
characteristics 
causally 
connected 
(standing 
in 
a 
causal 
connection) 
with, 
and 
hence 
capable 
of 
bringing 
about, 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
this 
need. 
Third, 
and 
most 
important 
in 
the 
present 
context, 
an 
element 
of 
the 
external 
world 
so 
perceived 
must 
be 
under 
human 
control 
such 
that 
it 
can 
be 
employed 
(actively, 
deliberately 
used) 
to 
satisfy 
the 
given 
need 
(reach 
the 
end 
sought). 
Writes 
Mises: 
“A 
thing 
becomes 
a 
means 
when 
human 
reason 
plans 
to 
employ 
it 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
some 
end 
and 
human 
action 
really 
employs 
it 
for 
this 
purpose.”[37] 
Only 
if 
a 
thing 
is 
thus 
brought 
into 
a 
causal 
connection 
with 
a 
human 
need 
and 
this 
thing 
is 
under 
human 
control 
can 
one 
say 
that 
this 
entity 
is 
appropriated—has 
become 
a 
good—and 
hence, 
is 
someone’s 
(private 
or 
collective) 
property. 
If, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
an 
element 
of 
the 
external 
world 
stands 
in 
a 
causal 
connection 
to 
a 
human 
need 
but 
no 
one 
can 
(or 
believes 
that 
he 
can) 
control 
and 
interfere 
with 
this 
element 
(but 
must 
leave 
it 
unchanged 
instead, 
left 
to 
its 
own 
natural 
devices 
and 
effects) 
then 
such 
an 
element 
must 
be 
considered 
part 
of 
the 
unappropriated 
environment 
and 
hence 
is 
no 
one’s 
property. 
Thus, 
for 
instance, 
sunshine 
or 
rainfall, 
atmospheric 
pressure 
or 
gravitational 
forces 
may 
have 
a 
causal 
effect 
on 
certain 
wanted 
or 
unwanted 
ends, 
but 
insofar 
as 
man 
thinks 
himself 
incapable 
of 
interfering 
with 
such 
elements 
they 
are 
mere 
conditions 
of 
acting, 
not 
the 
part 
of 
any 
action. 
E.g., 
rainwater 
may 
be 
causally 
connected 
to 
the 
sprouting 
of 
some 
edible 
mushrooms 
and 
this 
causal 
connection 
may 
well 
be 
known. 
However, 
if 
nothing 
is 
done 
about 
the 
rainwater, 
then 
this 
water 
is 
also 
not 
owned 
by 
anyone; 
it 
might 
be 
a 
factor 
contributing 
to 
production, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
strictly 
speaking 
a 
production 
factor. 
Only 
if 
there 
is 
an 
actual 
interference 
with 
the 
natural 
rainfall, 
if 
the 
rainwater 
is 
collected 
in 
a 
bucket 
or 
in 
a 
cistern, 
for 
instance, 
can 
it 
be 
considered 
someone’s 
property 
and 
does 
it 
become 
a 
factor 
of 
production. 


Before 
the 
backdrop 
of 
these 
considerations 
one 
can 
now 
proceed 
to 
address 
the 
question 
regarding 
the 
status 
of 
ground 
land 
in 
a 
hunter-gatherer 
society.[38] 
Certainly, 
the 
berries 
picked 
off 
a 
bush 
were 
property; 
but 
what 
about 
the 
bush, 
which 
was 
causally 
associated 
with 
the 
picked 
berries? 
The 



bush 
was 
only 
lifted 
from 
its 
original 
status 
as 
an 
environmental 
condition 
of 
action 
and 
a 
mere 
contributing 
factor 
to 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
human 
needs 
to 
the 
status 
of 
property 
and 
a 
genuine 
production 
factor 
once 
it 
had 
been 
appropriated: 
that 
is, 
once 
man 
had 
purposefully 
interfered 
with 
the 
natural 
causal 
process 
connecting 
bush 
and 
berries 
by, 
for 
instance, 
watering 
the 
bush 
or 
trimming 
its 
branches 
in 
order 
to 
produce 
a 
certain 
outcome 
(an 
increase 
of 
the 
berry 
harvest 
above 
the 
level 
otherwise, 
naturally 
attained). 
Further, 
once 
the 
bush 
had 
thus 
become 
property 
by 
grooming 
it 
or 
tending 
to 
it 
also 
future 
berry 
harvests 
became 
property, 
whereas 
previously 
only 
the 
berries 
actually 
harvested 
were 
someone’s 
property; 
moreover, 
once 
the 
bush 
had 
been 
lifted 
out 
of 
its 
natural, 
unowned 
state 
by 
watering 
it 
so 
as 
to 
increase 
the 
future 
berry 
harvest, 
for 
instance, 
also 
the 
ground 
land 
supporting 
the 
bush 
had 
become 
property. 


Similarly, 
there 
is 
also 
no 
question 
that 
a 
hunted 
animal 
was 
property; 
but 
what 
about 
the 
herd, 
the 
pack 
or 
the 
flock 
of 
which 
this 
animal 
was 
a 
part? 
Based 
on 
our 
previous 
considerations, 
the 
herd 
must 
be 
regarded 
as 
unowned 
nature 
as 
long 
as 
man 
had 
done 
nothing 
that 
could 
be 
interpreted 
(and 
that 
was 
in 
his 
own 
mind) 
causally 
connected 
with 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
a 
perceived 
need. 
The 
herd 
became 
property 
only 
once 
the 
requirement 
of 
interfering 
with 
the 
natural 
chain 
of 
events 
in 
order 
to 
produce 
some 
desired 
result 
had 
been 
fulfilled. 
This 
would 
have 
been 
the 
case, 
for 
instance, 
as 
soon 
as 
man 
engaged 
in 
the 
herding 
of 
animals, 
i.e., 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
actively 
tried 
to 
control 
the 
movements 
of 
the 
herd. 
The 
herder 
then 
did 
not 
only 
own 
the 
herd, 
he 
thus 
became 
also 
the 
owner 
of 
all 
future 
offspring 
naturally 
generated 
by 
the 
herd. 


What, 
however, 
about 
the 
ground 
land 
on 
which 
the 
controlled 
movement 
of 
the 
herd 
took 
place? 
According 
to 
our 
definitions, 
the 
herdsmen 
could 
not 
be 
considered 
the 
owner 
of 
the 
ground 
land, 
at 
least 
not 
automatically 
so, 
without 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
a 
further 
requirement. 
Because 
herders 
as 
conventionally 
defined 
merely 
followed 
the 
natural 
movements 
of 
the 
herd 
and 
their 
interference 
with 
nature 
was 
restricted 
to 
keeping 
the 
flock 
together 
so 
as 
to 
gain 
easier 
access 
to 
any 
one 
of 
its 
members 
should 
the 
need 
for 
the 
supply 
of 
animal 
meat 
arise. 
Herdsmen 
did 
not 
interfere 
with 
the 
land 
itself, 
however. 
They 
did 
not 
interfere 
with 
the 
land 
in 
order 
to 
control 
the 
movements 
of 
the 
herd; 
they 
only 
interfered 
with 
the 
movements 
of 
the 
members 
of 
the 
herd. 
Land 
only 
became 
property 
once 
herders 
gave 
up 



herding 
and 
turned 
to 
animal 
husbandry 
instead, 
i.e., 
once 
they 
treated 
land 
as 
a 
(scarce) 
means 
in 
order 
to 
control 
the 
movement 
of 
animals 
by 
controlling 
land. 
This 
only 
occurred 
when 
land 
was 
somehow 
en-bordered, 
by 
fencing 
it 
in 
or 
constructing 
some 
other 
obstacles 
(such 
as 
trenches) 
which 
restricted 
the 
free, 
natural 
flow 
of 
animals. 
Rather 
than 
being 
merely 
a 
contributing 
factor 
in 
the 
production 
of 
animal 
herds, 
land 
thus 
became 
a 
genuine 
production 
factor. 


What 
these 
considerations 
demonstrate 
is 
that 
it 
is 
erroneous 
to 
think 
of 
land 
as 
the 
collectively 
owned 
property 
of 
hunter-gatherer 
societies. 
Hunters 
were 
not 
herdsmen 
and 
still 
less 
were 
they 
engaged 
in 
animal 
husbandry; 
and 
gatherers 
were 
not 
gardeners 
or 
agriculturalists. 
They 
did 
not 
exercise 
control 
over 
the 
nature-given 
fauna 
and 
flora 
by 
tending 
to 
it 
or 
grooming 
it. 
They 
merely 
picked 
pieces 
from 
nature 
for 
the 
taking. 
Land 
to 
them 
was 
no 
more 
than 
a 
condition 
of 
their 
activities, 
not 
their 
property. 


At 
best, 
very 
small 
sections 
of 
land 
had 
been 
appropriated 
(and 
were 
thus 
turned 
into 
collective 
property) 
by 
hunters 
and 
gatherers, 
to 
be 
used 
as 
permanent 
storage 
places 
for 
surplus 
goods 
for 
use 
at 
future 
points 
in 
time 
and 
as 
shelters, 
all 
the 
while 
the 
surrounding 
territories 
continued 
to 
be 
treated 
and 
used 
as 
unowned 
conditions 
of 
their 
existence. 


What 
can 
be 
said, 
then, 
to 
have 
been 
the 
decisive 
step 
toward 
a 
(temporary) 
solution 
of 
the 
Malthusian 
trap 
faced 
by 
growing 
hunter-gatherer 
societies 
was 
the 
establishment 
of 
property 
in 
land 
going 
above 
and 
beyond 
the 
establishment 
of 
mere 
storage 
places 
and 
sheltering 
facilities. 
Pressured 
by 
falling 
standards 
of 
living 
as 
a 
result 
of 
absolute 
overpopulation, 
members 
of 
the 
tribe 
(separately 
or 
collectively) 
successively 
appropriated 
more 
and 
more 
of 
the 
previously 
unowned 
surrounding 
nature 
(land). 
And 
underlying 
and 
motivating 
this 
appropriation 
of 
surrounding 
ground 
land—and 
turning 
former 
places 
of 
storage 
and 
shelter 
into 
residential 
centers 
of 
agriculture 
and 
animal 
husbandry—was 
an 
eminent 
intellectual 
achievement. 
As 
Michael 
Hart 
has 
noted, 
“the 
idea 
of 
planting 
crops, 
protecting 
them, 
and 
eventually 
harvesting 
them 
is 
not 
obvious 
or 
trivial, 
and 
it 
requires 
a 
considerable 
degree 
of 
intelligence 
to 
conceive 
of 
that 
notion. 
No 
apes 
ever 
conceived 
of 
that 
idea, 
nor 
did 
Australopithecus, 
Homo 
habilis, 
Homo 
erectus, 
nor 
even 
archaic 
Homo 
sapiens.”[39] 
Nor 
did 
any 
of 
them 
conceive 
of 
the 
even 
more 
difficult 
idea 
of 
the 
tending, 
taming, 
and 
breeding 
of 
animals. 


Formerly, 
all 
consumer 
goods 
had 
been 
appropriated 
in 
the 
most 
direct 



and 
quickest 
way 
possible: 
through 
foraging, 
i.e., 
by 
“picking” 
such 
goods 
wherever 
they 
happened 
to 
be 
or 
go. 
In 
contrast, 
with 
agriculture 
and 
animal 
husbandry 
consumer 
goods 
were 
attained 
in 
an 
indirect 
and 
roundabout 
way: 
by 
producing 
them 
through 
the 
deliberate 
control 
of 
ground 
land. 
This 
was 
based 
on 
the 
discovery 
that 
consumer 
goods 
(plants 
and 
animals) 
were 
not 
simply 
‘given’ 
to 
be 
picked, 
but 
that 
there 
were 
natural 
causes 
affecting 
their 
supply 
and 
that 
these 
natural 
causes 
could 
be 
manipulated 
by 
taking 
control 
of 
ground 
land. 
The 
new 
mode 
of 
production 
required 
more 
time 
in 
order 
to 
reach 
the 
ultimate 
goal 
of 
food 
consumption 
(and 
insofar 
involved 
a 
loss 
of 
leisure), 
but 
by 
interposing 
ground 
land 
as 
a 
genuine 
factor 
of 
production 
it 
was 
more 
productive 
and 
led 
to 
a 
greater 
total 
output 
of 
consumer 
goods 
(food), 
thus 
allowing 
for 
a 
larger 
population 
size 
to 
be 
sustained 
on 
the 
same 
quantity 
of 
land.[40] 


More 
specifically 
with 
respect 
to 
plants: 
Seeds 
and 
fruits 
suitable 
for 
nutritional 
purposes 
were 
no 
longer 
just 
picked 
(and 
possibly 
stored), 
but 
the 
wild 
plants 
bearing 
them 
were 
actively 
cultivated. 
Besides 
for 
their 
taste, 
seeds 
and 
fruits 
were 
selected 
for 
size, 
durability 
(storability), 
the 
ease 
of 
harvesting 
and 
of 
seed-germination, 
and 
they 
were 
not 
consumed 
but 
used 
as 
inputs 
for 
the 
future 
output 
of 
consumer 
goods, 
leading 
in 
the 
relatively 
short 
time 
span 
of 
maybe 
twenty 
to 
thirty 
years 
to 
new, 
domesticated 
plant 
varieties 
with 
significantly 
improved 
yields 
per 
unit 
land. 
Among 
the 
first 
plants 
thus 
domesticated 
in 
the 
Near 
and 
Middle 
East 
were 
the 
einkorn 
wheat, 
emmer 
wheat, 
barley, 
rye, 
peas, 
and 
olives. 
In 
China 
it 
was 
rice 
and 
millet; 
much 
later, 
in 
Mesoamerica 
it 
was 
corn, 
beans, 
and 
squash; 
in 
South 
America 
potatoes 
and 
manioc; 
in 
Northeast 
America 
sunflowers 
and 
goosefoot; 
and 
in 
Africa 
sorghum, 
rice, 
yams, 
and 
oil 
palm.[41] 


The 
process 
of 
animal 
domestication 
proceeded 
along 
similar 
lines, 
and 
in 
this 
regard 
it 
was 
possible 
to 
draw 
on 
the 
experience 
gained 
by 
the 
first 
domestication 
and 
breeding 
of 
dogs, 
which 
had 
taken 
place 
some 
16,000 
years 
ago, 
i.e., 
still 
under 
hunter-gatherer 
conditions, 
somewhere 
in 
Siberia. 
[42] 


Dogs 
are 
the 
descendants 
of 
wolves. 
Wolves 
are 
excellent 
hunters. 
However, 
they 
are 
also 
scavengers, 
and 
it 
has 
been 
plausibly 
argued 
that 
as 
such 
wolves 
regularly 
hung 
around 
human 
campsites 
for 
scraps. 
As 
scavengers, 
those 
wolves 
who 
were 
least 
afraid 
of 
humans 
and 
who 
displayed 
the 
friendliest 
behavior 
toward 
them 
obviously 
enjoyed 
an 
evolutionary 



advantage. 
It 
was 
likely 
from 
these 
semi-tame, 
camp-following 
wolves 
that 
cubs 
were 
adopted 
into 
tribal 
households 
as 
pets 
and 
where 
it 
was 
then 
discovered 
that 
these 
could 
be 
trained 
for 
various 
purposes. 
They 
could 
be 
used 
in 
the 
hunt 
of 
other 
animals, 
they 
could 
be 
used 
to 
pull, 
they 
made 
for 
good 
bed-warmers 
during 
cold 
nights, 
and 
they 
even 
provided 
a 
source 
of 
meat 
in 
cases 
of 
emergency. 
Most 
importantly, 
however, 
it 
was 
discovered 
that 
some 
of 
the 
dogs 
could 
bark 
(wolves 
rarely 
bark) 
and 
be 
selected 
and 
bred 
for 
their 
ability 
to 
bark 
and 
as 
such 
perform 
the 
invaluable 
task 
of 
warning 
and 
guarding 
their 
owners 
of 
strangers 
and 
intruders. 
It 
was 
this 
service 
above 
all, 
that 
appears 
to 
be 
the 
reason 
why, 
once 
the 
dog 
had 
been 
“invented,” 
this 
invention 
spread 
like 
wildfire 
from 
Siberia 
all 
across 
the 
world. 
Everyone 
everywhere 
wanted 
to 
possess 
some 
offspring 
of 
this 
new, 
remarkable 
kind 
of 
animal, 
because 
in 
an 
era 
of 
constant 
intertribal 
warfare, 
the 
ownership 
of 
dogs 
proved 
to 
be 
a 
great 
advantage.[43] 


Once 
the 
dog 
had 
arrived 
in 
the 
region 
of 
the 
Near 
East, 
which 
was 
to 
become 
the 
first 
center 
of 
human 
civilization, 
it 
must 
have 
added 
considerable 
momentum 
to 
the 
human 
“experiment” 
of 
productive 
living 
and 
its 
success. 
For 
while 
a 
dog 
used 
for 
sentry 
duty 
was 
an 
asset 
for 
mobile 
hunter-gatherers, 
it 
was 
an 
even 
greater 
asset 
for 
stationary 
settlers. 
The 
reason 
for 
this 
is 
straightforward: 
because 
in 
sedentary 
societies 
there 
were 
simply 
more 
things 
to 
be 
protected. 
In 
hunter-gatherer 
societies 
one 
had 
to 
fear 
for 
one’s 
life, 
be 
it 
from 
external 
or 
internal 
aggression. 
However, 
because 
no 
member 
of 
society 
owned 
much 
of 
anything, 
there 
was 
little 
or 
no 
reason 
to 
steal. 
Matters 
were 
different, 
though, 
in 
a 
society 
of 
settlers. 
From 
its 
very 
inception, 
sedentary 
life 
was 
marked 
by 
the 
emergence 
of 
significant 
differences 
in 
the 
property 
and 
wealth 
owned 
by 
different 
members 
of 
society; 
hence, 
insofar 
as 
envy 
existed 
in 
any 
way, 
shape, 
or 
form 
(as 
can 
be 
safely 
assumed)[44] 
each 
member 
(each 
separate 
household) 
also 
faced 
the 
threat 
of 
theft 
or 
destruction 
of 
his 
property 
by 
others, 
including 
especially 
also 
members 
of 
his 
own 
tribe. 
Dogs 
provided 
invaluable 
help 
in 
dealing 
with 
this 
problem, 
especially 
because 
dogs, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
biological 
fact, 
attach 
themselves 
to 
individual 
“masters,” 
rather 
than 
to 
people 
in 
general 
or, 
like 
cats, 
for 
instance, 
to 
particular 
places.[45] 
As 
such, 
they 
themselves 
represented 
a 
prime 
example 
of 
something 
owned 
privately, 
rather 
than 
collectively. 
That 
is, 
they 
offered 
a 
“natural 
refutation” 
of 
whatever 
taboo 
might 
have 
existed 
in 
a 
primitive 
society 
against 
the 
private 
ownership 
of 



property. 
Moreover 
and 
more 
importantly, 
because 
dogs 
were 
unquestionably 
the 
property 
of 
particular 
individuals 
they 
proved 
also 
uniquely 
serviceable 
in 
guarding 
the 
private 
property 
of 
their 
natural 
owners 
from 
every 
kind 
of 
“foreign” 
invader.[46] 


Animals, 
even 
more 
so 
than 
plants, 
were 
valuable 
for 
humans 
for 
a 
variety 
of 
reasons: 
as 
sources 
of 
meat, 
milk, 
skin, 
fur, 
and 
wool 
and 
also 
as 
potential 
means 
of 
transportation, 
pull, 
and 
traction, 
for 
instance. 
However, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
biological 
fact, 
most 
animals 
turn 
out 
to 
be 
undomesticable.[47] 
The 
first 
and 
foremost 
selection 
criterion, 
then, 
in 
the 
“production” 
of 
animals 
as 
livestock 
or 
pets 
was 
an 
animal 
species’ 
perceived 
degree 
of 
tame-
ability 
or 
controllability. 
To 
test 
one’s 
hypothesis, 
in 
a 
first 
step 
it 
was 
checked 
whether 
or 
not 
an 
animal 
was 
suitable 
to 
herding. 
If 
so, 
it 
was 
then 
tried 
if 
a 
herd 
of 
wild 
animals 
could 
also 
be 
penned. 
If 
so, 
one 
would 
subsequently 
select 
the 
tamer 
animals 
as 
parents 
of 
the 
next 
generation—but 
not 
all 
animals 
breed 
in 
captivity!—and 
so 
on 
and 
on. 
Finally, 
one 
would 
select 
among 
the 
tamed 
animal 
variety 
for 
other 
desirable 
properties 
such 
as 
size, 
strength, 
etc., 
thus 
breeding 
eventually 
a 
new, 
domesticated 
animal 
species. 
Among 
the 
first 
large 
mammalian 
animals 
thus 
domesticated 
in 
the 
Near 
and 
Middle 
East 
(around 
10,000 
years 
ago) 
were 
sheep, 
goats, 
and 
pigs 
(from 
wild 
boars), 
then 
cattle 
(from 
wild 
aurochs). 
Cattle 
were 
also 
domesticated, 
apparently 
independently, 
in 
India 
at 
about 
the 
same 
time 
(about 
8,000 
years 
ago). 
Roughly 
at 
about 
the 
same 
time 
as 
in 
the 
Near 
and 
Middle 
East, 
sheep, 
goats, 
and 
pigs 
were 
domesticated 
independently 
also 
in 
China, 
and 
China 
was 
also 
to 
contribute 
the 
domesticated 
water 
buffalo 
(about 
6,000 
years 
ago). 
Central 
Asia 
and 
Arabia 
contributed 
the 
domesticated 
Bactrian 
and 
Arabian 
camel 
respectively 
(around 
4,500 
years 
ago). 
And 
the 
Americas, 
or 
more 
precisely 
the 
Andes 
region 
of 
South 
America, 
were 
to 
contribute 
the 
guinea 
pig 
(about 
7,000 
years 
ago), 
the 
llama 
and 
alpaca 
(about 
5,500 
years 
ago). 
Finally, 
an 
“invention” 
of 
particularly 
momentous 
consequences 
was 
the 
domestication 
of 
the 
horse, 
which 
occurred 
about 
6,000 
years 
ago 
in 
the 
region 
of 
today’s 
Russia 
and 
Ukraine. 
This 
achievement 
initiated 
a 
genuine 
revolution 
in 
land 
transportation. 
Up 
until 
then, 
on 
land 
man 
had 
to 
walk 
from 
place 
to 
place, 
and 
the 
fastest 
way 
to 
cover 
distances 
was 
by 
boat. 
This 
changed 
dramatically 
with 
the 
arrival 
of 
the 
domesticated 
horse, 
which 
from 
then 
on 
until 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
with 
the 
invention 
of 
the 
locomotive 
and 
the 
motorcar, 
was 
to 
provide 
the 
fastest 



means 
of 
overland 
transportation. 
Accordingly, 
not 
quite 
unlike 
the 
“invention” 
of 
the 
dog 
some 
16,000 
years 
ago, 
the 
“invention” 
of 
the 
horse 
was 
to 
spread 
like 
wildfire. 
However, 
coming 
some 
10,000 
years 
later, 
the 
latter 
invention 
could 
no 
longer 
diffuse 
as 
widely 
as 
the 
former. 
While 
the 
dog 
had 
reached 
practically 
all 
corners 
of 
the 
world, 
the 
climatic 
changes— 
the 
global 
warming—that 
had 
taken 
place 
in 
the 
meantime 
made 
it 
impossible 
for 
the 
same 
success 
to 
be 
repeated 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
horse. 
In 
the 
meantime, 
the 
Eurasian 
land 
mass 
was 
separated 
from 
the 
Americas 
and 
from 
Indonesia, 
New 
Guinea, 
and 
Australia 
by 
bodies 
of 
water 
too 
wide 
to 
be 
bridged. 
Thus, 
it 
was 
only 
thousands 
of 
years 
later, 
after 
the 
European 
rediscovery 
of 
the 
Americas, 
for 
instance, 
that 
the 
horse 
was 
finally 
introduced 
there. 
(Wild 
horses 
had 
apparently 
existed 
on 
the 
American 
continent, 
but 
they 
had 
been 
hunted 
to 
extinction 
there 
so 
as 
to 
make 
any 
independent 
domestication 
impossible.) 


The 
appropriation 
of 
land 
as 
property 
and 
basis 
of 
agriculture 
and 
animal 
husbandry 
was 
only 
half 
of 
the 
solution 
to 
the 
problem 
posed 
by 
an 
increasing 
population 
pressure, 
however. 
Through 
the 
appropriation 
of 
land 
a 
more 
effective 
use 
was 
made 
of 
land, 
allowing 
for 
a 
larger 
population 
size 
to 
be 
sustained. 
But 
the 
institution 
of 
land 
ownership 
in 
and 
of 
itself 
did 
not 
affect 
the 
other 
side 
of 
the 
problem: 
the 
continued 
proliferation 
of 
new 
and 
more 
offspring. 
This 
aspect 
of 
the 
problem 
required 
some 
solution 
as 
well. 
A 
social 
institution 
had 
to 
be 
invented 
that 
brought 
this 
proliferation 
under 
control. 
The 
institution 
designed 
to 
accomplish 
this 
task 
is 
the 
institution 
of 
the 
family, 
which 
developed 
not 
coincidentally 
hand 
in 
hand 
with 
that 
of 
land 
ownership. 
Indeed, 
as 
Malthus 
pointed 
out, 
in 
order 
to 
solve 
the 
problem 
of 
overpopulation, 
along 
with 
the 
institution 
of 
private 
property 
“the 
commerce 
between 
the 
sexes” 
had 
to 
undergo 
some 
fundamental 
change 
as 
well.[48] 


What 
was 
the 
commerce 
between 
the 
sexes 
before 
and 
what 
was 
the 
institutional 
innovation 
brought 
about 
in 
this 
regard 
by 
the 
family? 
A 
precise 
answer 
to 
the 
first 
question 
is 
notoriously 
difficult, 
but 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
identify 
the 
principal 
structural 
change. 
In 
terms 
of 
economic 
theory, 
the 
change 
can 
be 
described 
as 
one 
from 
a 
situation 
where 
both 
the 
benefits 
of 
creating 
offspring—by 
creating 
an 
additional 
potential 
producer—and 
especially 
the 
costs 
of 
creating 
offspring—by 
creating 
an 
additional 
consumer 
(eater)—were 
socialized. 
That 
is, 
reaped 
and 
paid 
for 
by 
society 
at 
large 
rather 
than 
the 
“producers” 
of 
this 
offspring, 
to 
a 
situation 
where 
both 



benefits 
as 
well 
as 
costs 
involved 
in 
procreation 
were 
internalized 
by 
and 
economically 
imputed 
back 
to 
those 
individuals 
causally 
responsible 
for 
producing 
them. 


Whatever 
the 
details 
may 
have 
been, 
it 
appears 
that 
the 
institution 
of 
a 
stable 
monogamous 
and 
also 
of 
a 
polygamous 
relationship 
between 
men 
and 
women 
that 
is 
nowadays 
associated 
with 
the 
term 
family 
is 
fairly 
new 
in 
the 
history 
of 
mankind 
and 
was 
preceded 
for 
a 
long 
time 
by 
an 
institution 
that 
may 
be 
broadly 
defined 
as 
“unrestricted” 
or 
“unregulated” 
sexual 
intercourse 
or 
as 
“group 
marriage.”[49] 
The 
commerce 
between 
the 
sexes 
during 
this 
stage 
of 
human 
history 
did 
not 
rule 
out 
the 
existence 
of 
temporary 
pair 
relationships 
between 
one 
man 
and 
one 
woman. 
However, 
in 
principle 
every 
woman 
was 
considered 
a 
potential 
sexual 
partner 
of 
every 
man, 
and 
vice 
versa. 
“Männer 
(lebten) 
in 
Vielweiberei 
und 
ihre 
Weiber 
gleichzeitig 
in 
Vielmännerei,” 
noted 
Friedrich 
Engels, 
following 
in 
the 
footsteps 
of 
Lewis 


H. 
Morgan’s 
researches 
in 
Ancient 
Society 
(1871), 
“und 
die 
gemeinsamen 
Kinder 
(galten) 
daher 
auch 
als 
ihnen 
allen 
gemeinsam 
(gehörig). 
.... 
jede 
Frau 
(gehörte) 
jedem 
Mann 
und 
jeder 
Mann 
jeder 
Frau 
gleichmässig.”[50] 
What 
Engels 
and 
countless 
later 
socialists 
failed 
to 
notice 
in 
their 
glorifying 
description 
of 
the 
past—and 
supposedly 
again 
future—institution 
of 
“free 
love,” 
however, 
is 
the 
plain 
fact 
that 
this 
institution 
has 
a 
direct 
and 
clear 
effect 
on 
the 
production 
of 
offspring. 
As 
Ludwig 
von 
Mises 
has 
commented: 
“it 
is 
certain 
that 
even 
if 
a 
socialist 
community 
may 
bring 
‘free 
love,’ 
it 
can 
in 
no 
way 
bring 
free 
birth.”[51] 
What 
Mises 
implied 
with 
this 
remark, 
and 
what 
socialists 
such 
as 
Engels 
and 
Bebel 
apparently 
ignored, 
is 
that, 
certainly 
in 
the 
age 
before 
the 
availability 
of 
effective 
means 
of 
contraception, 
free 
love 
has 
consequences, 
namely 
pregnancies 
and 
births, 
and 
that 
births 
involve 
benefits 
as 
well 
as 
costs. 
This 
does 
not 
matter 
as 
long 
as 
the 
benefits 
exceed 
the 
costs, 
i.e., 
as 
long 
as 
an 
additional 
member 
of 
society 
adds 
more 
to 
it 
as 
a 
producer 
of 
goods 
than 
it 
takes 
from 
it 
as 
a 
consumer—and 
this 
may 
well 
be 
the 
case 
for 
some 
time. 
But 
it 
follows 
from 
the 
law 
of 
returns 
that 
this 
situation 
cannot 
last 
forever, 
without 
limits. 
Inevitably, 
the 
point 
must 
arrive 
when 
the 
costs 
of 
additional 
offspring 
will 
exceed 
its 
benefits. 
Then, 
any 
further 
procreation 
must 
be 
stopped—moral 
restraint 
must 
be 
exercised—unless 
one 
wants 
to 
experience 
a 
progressive 
fall 
in 
average 
living 
standards. 
However, 
if 
children 
are 
considered 
everyone’s 
or 
no 
one’s 
children, 
because 
everyone 
entertains 
sexual 
relations 



with 
everyone 
else, 
then 
the 
incentive 
to 
refrain 
from 
procreation 
disappears 
or 
is 
at 
least 
significantly 
diminished. 
Instinctively, 
by 
virtue 
of 
man’s 
biological 
nature, 
each 
woman 
and 
each 
man 
is 
driven 
to 
spread 
and 
proliferate 
her 
or 
his 
genes 
into 
the 
next 
generation 
of 
the 
species. 
The 
more 
offspring 
one 
creates 
the 
better, 
because 
the 
more 
of 
one’s 
genes 
will 
survive. 
No 
doubt, 
this 
natural 
human 
instinct 
can 
be 
controlled 
by 
rational 
deliberation. 
But 
if 
no 
or 
little 
economic 
sacrifice 
must 
be 
made 
for 
simply 
following 
one’s 
animal 
instincts, 
because 
all 
children 
are 
maintained 
by 
society 
at 
large, 
then 
no 
or 
little 
incentive 
exists 
to 
employ 
reason 
in 
sexual 
matters, 
i.e., 
to 
exercise 
any 
moral 
restraint. 


From 
a 
purely 
economic 
point 
of 
view, 
then, 
the 
solution 
to 
the 
problem 
of 
overpopulation 
should 
be 
immediately 
apparent. 
The 
ownership 
of 
children 
or 
more 
correctly 
the 
trusteeship 
over 
children 
must 
be 
privatized. 
Rather 
than 
considering 
children 
as 
collectively 
owned 
by 
or 
entrusted 
to 
“society” 
or 
viewing 
childbirths 
as 
some 
uncontrolled 
and 
uncontrollable 
natural 
event 
and 
accordingly 
considering 
children 
as 
owned 
by 
or 
entrusted 
to 
no 
one 
(as 
mere 
favorable 
or 
unfavorable 
“environmental 
changes”), 
children 
must 
instead 
be 
regarded 
as 
entities 
which 
are 
privately 
produced 
and 
entrusted 
into 
private 
care. 
As 
Thomas 
Malthus 
first 
perceptively 
noted, 
this, 
essentially, 
is 
what 
is 
accomplished 
with 
the 
institution 
of 
a 
family: 


the 
most 
natural 
and 
obvious 
check 
(on 
population) 
seemed 
to 
be 
to 
make 
every 
man 
provide 
for 
his 
own 
children; 
that 
this 
would 
operate 
in 
some 
respect 
as 
a 
measure 
and 
guide 
in 
the 
increase 
of 
population, 
as 
it 
might 
be 
expected 
that 
no 
man 
would 
bring 
beings 
into 
the 
world, 
for 
whom 
he 
could 
not 
find 
the 
means 
of 
support; 
that 
where 
this 
notwithstanding 
was 
the 
case, 
it 
seemed 
necessary, 
for 
the 
example 
of 
others, 
that 
the 
disgrace 
and 
inconvenience 
attending 
such 
a 
conduct 
should 
fall 
upon 
the 
individual, 
who 
had 
thus 
inconsiderately 
plunged 
himself 
and 
innocent 
children 
in 
misery 
and 
want.— 
The 
institution 
of 
marriage, 
or 
at 
least, 
of 
some 
express 
or 
implied 
obligation 
on 
every 
man 
to 
support 
his 
own 
children, 
seems 
to 
be 
the 
natural 
result 
of 
these 
reasonings 
in 
a 
community 
under 
the 
difficulties 
that 
we 
have 
supposed.[52] 



Moreover 
and 
finally: 
with 
the 
formation 
of 
monogamous 
or 
polygamous 
families 
came 
another 
decisive 
innovation. 
Earlier 
on, 
the 
members 
of 
a 
tribe 
formed 
a 
single, 
unified 
household, 
and 
the 
intratribal 
division 
of 
labor 
was 
essentially 
an 
intra-household 
division 
of 
labor. 
With 
the 
formation 
of 
families 
came 
the 
breakup 
of 
a 
unified 
household 
into 
several, 
independent 
households 
and 
with 
that 
also 
the 
formation 
of 
“several”—or 
private—ownership 
of 
land. 
That 
is, 
the 
previously 
described 
appropriation 
of 
land 
was 
not 
simply 
a 
transition 
from 
a 
situation 
where 
something 
that 
was 
earlier 
on 
unowned 
became 
now 
owned, 
but 
more 
precisely 
something 
previously 
unowned 
was 
turned 
into 
something 
owned 
by 
separate 
households 
(thus 
allowing 
also 
for 
the 
emergence 
of 
inter-
household 
division 
of 
labor). 


Consequently, 
then, 
the 
higher 
social 
income 
made 
possible 
by 
the 
ownership 
of 
land 
was 
no 
longer 
distributed 
as 
was 
formerly 
the 
case: 
to 
each 
member 
of 
society 
“according 
to 
his 
need.” 
Rather, 
each 
separate 
household’s 
share 
in 
the 
total 
social 
income 
came 
to 
depend 
on 
the 
product 
economically 
imputed 
to 
it, 
that 
is, 
to 
its 
labor 
and 
its 
property 
invested 
in 
production. 
In 
other 
words: 
the 
formerly 
pervasive 
“communism” 
might 
have 
still 
continued 
within 
each 
household, 
but 
communism 
vanished 
from 
the 
relation 
between 
the 
members 
of 
different 
households. 
The 
incomes 
of 
different 
households 
differed, 
depending 
on 
the 
quantity 
and 
quality 
of 
invested 
labor 
and 
property, 
and 
no 
one 
had 
a 
claim 
on 
the 
income 
produced 
by 
the 
members 
of 
a 
household 
other 
than 
one’s 
own. 
Thus, 
“free 
riding” 
on 
others’ 
efforts 
became 
largely 
if 
not 
entirely 
impossible. 
He 
who 
did 
not 
work 
could 
no 
longer 
expect 
to 
still 
eat.[53] 


Private 
ownership 
in 
the 
means 
of 
production 
is 
the 
regulating 
principle 
which, 
within 
society, 
balances 
the 
limited 
means 
of 
subsistence 
at 
society’s 
disposal 
with 
the 
less 
limited 
ability 
of 
consumers 
to 
increase. 
By 
making 
the 
share 
in 
the 
social 
product 
which 
falls 
to 
each 
member 
of 
society 
depend 
on 
the 
product 
economically 
imputed 
to 
him, 
that 
is, 
to 
his 
labour 
and 
his 
property, 
the 
elimination 
of 
surplus 
human 
beings 
by 
the 
struggle 
for 
existence, 
as 
it 
rages 
in 
the 
vegetable 
and 
animal 
kingdom, 
is 
replaced 
by 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
birth-rate 
as 
a 
result 
of 
social 
forces. 
“Moral 
restraint,” 
the 
limitations 
of 



offspring 
imposed 
by 
social 
positions, 
replaces 
the 
struggle 


for 
existence.[54] 


Having 
first 
established 
some 
permanent 
storage 
and 
sheltering 
places, 
then, 
step 
by 
step, 
having 
appropriated 
more 
and 
more 
surrounding 
land 
as 
the 
basis 
for 
agricultural 
production 
and 
the 
raising 
of 
livestock 
and 
transforming 
erstwhile 
centers 
of 
storage 
and 
shelter 
into 
extended 
settlements 
composed 
of 
houses 
and 
villages 
occupied 
by 
separate 
family 
households, 
the 
new 
lifestyle 
of 
the 
people 
of 
the 
Near 
and 
Middle 
East 
as 
well 
as 
the 
other 
regions 
of 
original 
human 
settlement 
began 
to 
spread 
outward, 
slowly 
but 
inescapably.[55] 
In 
principle, 
two 
modes 
are 
conceivable 
by 
which 
this 
diffusion 
could 
have 
taken 
place. 
Either 
the 
original 
settlers 
gradually 
displaced 
the 
neighboring 
nomadic 
tribes 
in 
search 
of 
new 
to-becultivated 
land 
(demic 
diffusion), 
or 
else 
the 
latter 
imitated 
and 
adopted 
the 
new 
lifestyle 
on 
their 
own 
initiative 
(cultural 
diffusion). 
Until 
recently, 
it 
had 
been 
generally 
believed 
that 
the 
first 
mode 
of 
diffusion 
was 
the 
predominant 
one.[56] 
However, 
based 
on 
newly 
discovered 
genetic 
evidence 
this 
view 
now 
appears 
to 
be 
questionable, 
at 
least 
insofar 
as 
the 
spread 
of 
the 
new, 
sedentary 
lifestyle 
from 
the 
Near 
East 
to 
Europe 
is 
concerned. 
If 
present 
Europeans 
were 
the 
descendants 
of 
Near 
Eastern 
people 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Neolithic 
Revolution, 
genetic 
traces 
for 
this 
should 
exist. 
In 
fact, 
however, 
very 
few 
such 
traces 
can 
be 
found 
among 
present-day 
Europeans. 
Thus, 
it 
appears 
more 
likely 
that 
the 
spread 
of 
the 
new 
sedentary 
lifestyle 
occurred 
largely, 
if 
not 
exclusively, 
via 
the 
latter, 
second-mentioned 
route, 
while 
the 
role 
in 
this 
process 
played 
by 
the 
original 
Near 
Eastern 
settlers 
was 
only 
a 
minor 
one. 
Perhaps 
a 
few 
such 
settlers 
pushed 
in 
a 
northern 
and 
western 
direction, 
where 
they 
were 
then 
absorbed 
by 
neighboring 
people 
adopting 
their 
new 
and 
successful 
lifestyle, 
with 
the 
effect 
that 
their 
own 
genetic 
imprint 
became 
more 
and 
more 
diluted 
with 
increasing 
distance 
from 
their 
Near 
Eastern 
point 
of 
origin. 


In 
any 
case, 
with 
the 
Neolithic 
Revolution 
the 
formerly 
universal 
hunter-
gatherer 
lifestyle 
essentially 
died 
out 
or 
was 
relegated 
to 
the 
outer 
fringes 
of 
human 
habitation. 
Without 
doubt, 
the 
newly 
developing 
farming 
communities 
were 
attractive 
targets 
for 
nomadic 
raiders, 
and 
owing 
to 
their 
greater 
mobility 
neighboring 
nomadic 
tribes 
for 
a 
long 
time 
posed 
a 
serious 
threat 
to 
agricultural 
settlers. 
But 
ultimately, 
nomads 
were 
no 
match 
for 
them, 



because 
of 
their 
greater 
numbers. 
More 
specifically, 
it 
was 
the 
organization 
of 
larger 
numbers 
of 
people 
in 
communities 
of 
households—the 
location 
of 
separate 
households 
in 
close 
physical 
proximity 
to 
each 
other—that 
made 
for 
military 
superiority. 
Community 
life 
did 
not 
merely 
lower 
the 
transaction 
costs 
as 
far 
as 
intratribal 
exchange 
was 
concerned. 
Community 
life 
also 
offered 
the 
advantage 
of 
easily 
and 
quickly 
coordinated 
joint 
defense 
in 
the 
case 
of 
external 
aggression. 
Moreover, 
besides 
the 
strength 
of 
greater 
numbers, 
settled 
agricultural 
communities 
allowed 
also 
for 
an 
intensified 
and 
expanded 
division 
of 
labor 
and 
for 
greater 
savings 
and 
thus 
facilitated 
the 
development 
of 
a 
weaponry 
superior 
to 
anything 
available 
to 
bands 
of 
nomads.[57] 


Fifty 
thousand 
years 
ago 
the 
human 
population 
size 
has 
been 
estimated 
to 
have 
been 
as 
low 
as 
5,000 
or 
possibly 
50,000 
people. 
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Neolithic 
Revolution, 
some 
11,000 
years 
ago, 
when 
essentially 
the 
entire 
globe 
had 
been 
conquered 
by 
tribes 
of 
hunters 
and 
gatherers 
having 
spread 
out 
in 
the 
course 
of 
thousands 
of 
years 
from 
their 
original 
homeland 
somewhere 
in 
East 
Africa, 
the 
world 
population 
size 
has 
been 
estimated 
to 
have 
reached 
about 
four 
million.[58] 
Since 
then, 
slowly 
but 
steadily, 
the 
new 
mode 
of 
production: 
of 
agriculture 
and 
animal 
husbandry 
based 
on 
private 
(or 
collective) 
ownership 
of 
land 
and 
organized 
around 
separate 
family 
households, 
successively 
displaced 
the 
original 
hunter-gatherer 
order. 
Consequently, 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Christian 
era, 
the 
world 
population 
had 
increased 
to 
170 
million, 
and 
in 
1800, 
which 
marks 
the 
onset 
of 
the 
so-called 
Industrial 
Revolution 
(the 
topic 
of 
the 
following 
chapter) 
and 
the 
close 
of 
the 
agrarian 
age 
or 
as 
it 
also 
been 
termed 
the 
“old 
biological 
order,” 
it 
had 
reached 
720 
million. 
(Today’s 
world 
population 
exceeds 
seven 
billion!) 
During 
this 
agrarian 
age, 
the 
size 
of 
cities 
occasionally 
reached 
or 
even 
surpassed 
one 
million 
inhabitants, 
but 
until 
the 
very 
end 
less 
than 
2 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
lived 
in 
big 
cities 
and 
even 
in 
the 
economically 
most 
advanced 
countries 
80–90 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
was 
occupied 
in 
agricultural 
production 
(while 
this 
number 
has 
fallen 
to 
less 
than 
5 
percent 
today).

The 
egalitarianism 
of 
hunter-gatherer 
societies 
should 
not 
be 
overemphasized 
or 
idealized, 
however. 
These 
societies 
were 
also 
characterized 
by 
pronounced 
hierarchical 
features. 
Not 
unlike 
what 
is 
known 
from 
the 
animal 
kingdom, 
men 
ranked 
above 
and 
dominated 
women. 
Often 
women 
were 
“taken” 
and 
treated 
by 
men 
like 
goods 
of 
the 
“outer” 
world 
are 
taken 
and 
treated: 
appropriated, 
stolen, 
used, 
abused, 
and 
traded. 
Children 
ranked 
below 
adults. 
Moreover, 
hierarchies 
existed 
among 
both 
male 
and 
the 
female 
members 
of 
society, 
down 
from 
the 
reigning 
alpha-male 
and 
female 
to 
the 
lowliest 
member 
of 
society. 
Status 
fights 
occurred, 
and 
whoever 
did 
not 
accept 
the 
established 
rank-order 
faced 
severe 
punishment. 
The 
losers 
in 
the 
fights 
for 
higher 
status 
were 
threatened 
with 
injury, 
even 
death 
and, 
at 
the 
very 
best, 
expulsion 
from 
the 
tribe. 
In 
a 
word: 
even 
if 
tribal 
life 
provided 
for 
a 
comfortable 
standard 
of 
living 
in 
terms 
of 
abundant 
food 
and 
leisure 
it 
was 
anything 
but 
comfortable 
in 
terms 
of 
today’s 
much 
cherished 
“individual 
autonomy.” 
To 
the 
contrary, 
life 
in 
the 
tribal 
household 
meant 
discipline, 
order, 
and 
submission.

Contrasting 
the 
ferocity 
of 
primitive 
vs. 
modern 
men, 
Wade, 
following 
Keeley, 
notes 
(Before 
the 
Dawn, 
p. 
152): 
When 
primitive 
warriors 
met 
the 
troops 
of 
civilized 
societies 
in 
open 
battle, 
they 
regularly 
defeated 
them 
despite 
the 
vast 
disparity 
in 
weaponry. 
In 
the 
Indian 
wars, 
the 
U.S. 
Army 
“usually 
suffered 
severe 
defeats” 
when 
caught 
in 
the 
open, 
such 
as 
by 
the 
Seminoles 
in 
1834, 
and 
at 
the 
battle 
of 
Little 
Bighorn. 
In 
1879 
the 
British 
army 
in 
South 
Africa, 
equipped 
with 
artillery 
and 
Gatling 
guns 
was 
convincingly 
defeated 
by 
Zulus 
armed 
mostly 
with 
spears 
and 
ox-hide 
shields 
at 
the 



battles 
of 
Isandlwana, 
Myer’s 
Drift 
and 
Hlobane. 
The 
French 
were 
sent 
off 
by 
the 
Tuareg 
of 
the 
Sahara 
in 
the 
1890s. 
The 
state 
armies 
prevailed 
in 
the 
end 
only 
through 
larger 
manpower 
and 
attritional 
campaigns, 
not 
by 
superior 
fighting 
skill.

von 
Mises,

Human 
Action: 
A 
Treatise 
on 
Economics 
(Chicago: 
Regnery,

p. 
144. 
[18] 
Indirectly, 
this 
insight 
into 
the 
irreconcilable 
antagonism 
between 
the 
members 
of 
different 
tribes 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
hunter-gatherer 
societies 
also 
provides 
a 
first 
clue 
as 
to 
the 
requirements 
for 
peaceful 
cooperation 
among 
men. 
In 
order 
for 
members 
of 
different 
tribes 
to 
view 
each 
other 
not 
as 
enemies 
but 
as 
potential 
collaborators, 
there 
must 
be 
genuine 
production 
of 
consumer 
goods 
(above 
and 
beyond 
the 
mere 
appropriation 
of 
nature-given 
consumer 
goods). 
At 
least, 
as 
a 
very 
minimum 
requirement, 
there 
must 
be 
production 
of 
consumer 
goods 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
storage 
of 
surplus 
goods 
(of 
saving 
for 
future 
consumption). 
For 
only 
if 
man 
thus 
adds 
something 
to 
nature 
which 
otherwise, 
without 
his 
deliberate 
effort, 
would 
not 
exist 
at 
all, 
can 
there 
be 
a 
reason 
for 
one 
man 
to 
spare 
another 
man’s 
life 
for 
his 
own 
good 
(for 
his 
own 
selfish 
motives 
and 
to 
his 
own 
advantage). 
To 
be 
sure, 
as 
proponents 
of 
the 
thesis 
that 
it 
is 
civilization, 
which 
breeds 
war, 
are 
fond 
to 
point 
out, 
the 
very 
fact 
that 
one 
man 
has 
added 
something 
to 
the 
supply 
of 
nature-given 
goods 
might 
also 
provide 
a 
reason 
for 
another 
man 
to 
engage 
in 
aggression: 
to 
rob 
him 
of 
his 
product. 
But 
there 
is 
certainly 
less 
reason 
to 
kill 
such 
a 
man 
than 
to 
kill 
a 
man 
who 
has 
added 
nothing 
but 
merely 
takes 
and 
consumes 
what 
is 
given 
(and 
hence 
inevitably 
reduces 
what 
remains 
available 
for 
another). 
Moreover, 
insofar 
as 
a 
man 
adds 
something 
to 
the 
total 
supply 
of 
available 
goods 
there 
exists 
also 
a 
reason 
for 
another 
man 
to 
not 
interfere 
with 
his 
activity 
but 
let 
him 
continue, 
and 
to 
benefit 
from 
him 
and 
his 
activity 
by 
engaging 
in 
mutually 
beneficial 
trade 
with 
him 
and 
hence, 
as 
a 
consequence, 
ultimately 
develop 
sympathetic 
feelings 
toward 
his 
fellow 
man. 
Thus, 
while 
civilization 
does 
not 
eliminate 
man’s 
aggressive 
impulses 
it 
can 
and 
did 
diminish 
and 
attenuate 
them. 
[19] 
Actually, 
the 
last 
great 
warming 
period, 
also 
called 
interglacial 
period, 

had 
already 
ended 
about 
120,000 
years 
ago. 
During 
this 
period, 
i.e., 
more 
than 
120,000 
years 
ago, 
hippopotamuses 
had 
lived 
in 
the 
Rhine 
and 
the 
Thames 
and 
northern 
Europe 
had 
something 
of 
an 
“African 
appearance.” 
From 
then 
on, 
glaciers 
moved 
steadily 
further 
southward 
and 
the 
sea 
level 
eventually 
fell 
by 
more 
than 
100 
meters. 
The 
Thames 
and 
the 
Elbe 
became 
tributaries 
of 
the 
Rhine, 
before 
it 
streamed 
first 
into 
the 
Northern 
Sea 
and 
from 
there 
into 
the 
Atlantic.

Naturgeschichte

pp. 
15f. 
When 
this 
period 
ended, 
quite 
suddenly, 
about 
12,000 
years 
ago, 
the 
glaciers 
rapidly 
retreated 
and 
the 
sea 
level 
rose, 
not 
by 
millimeters 
per 
year 
but 
very 
quickly 
in 
an 
almost 
flood-like 
fashion. 
Within 
a 
very 
brief 
period 
England 
and 
Ireland, 
which 
had 
previously 
been 
connected 
to 
the 
European 
continent, 
became 
islands. 
The 
Baltic 
Sea 
and 
much 
of 
the 
contemporary 
North 
Sea 
came 
thus 
into 
existence. 
Likewise, 
most 
of 
today’s 
Persian 
Gulf 
dates 
from 
about 
this 
time.

During 
the 
present 
Holocene 
period 
temperatures 
continued 
to 
show 

significant 
variations, 
however. 
About 
10,000 
years 
ago, 
after 
a 
warming 
period 
of 
thousands 
of 
years, 
temperatures 
reached 
the 
present 
level. 
Several 
times 
thereafter, 
temperatures 
rose 
significantly 
above 
this 
level 
(by 
up 
to 
2 
degrees 
Celsius): 
8,000 
to 
6,800 
years 
ago, 
6,000 
to 
5,500 
years 
ago, 
5,000 
to 
4,000 
years 
ago, 
2,500 
to 
2000 
years 
ago, 
and 
again 
from 
the 
tenth 
to 
the 
fourteenth 
century, 
during 
the 
so-called 
medieval 
warming 
period. 
As 
well, 
several 
periods 
with 
significantly 
lower 
than 
present 
temperatures 
existed: 
9,000 
to 
8,000 
years 
ago, 
6,800 
to 
6,000 
years 
ago, 
4,000 
to 
2,500 
years 
ago, 
from 
the 
second 
to 
the 
eighth 
century 
and 
again 
from 
the 
fourteenth 
until 
the 
mid-nineteenth 
century, 
the 
so-called 
Little 
Ice 
Age.

Empirically, 
it 
appears 
that 
the 
“magic 
number,” 
i.e., 
the 
optimum 
population 
size 
for 
a 
hunter-gatherer 
society, 
was 
somewhere 
between 
50 
to 
100 
people 
for 
a 
territory 
of 
about 
50 
to 
100 
square 
miles 
(one 
person 
per 
square 
mile). 
At 
around 
this 
combination 
point, 
all 
advantages 
offered 
by 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
were 
exhausted. 
If 
the 
population 
size 
increased 
beyond 
this 
“magic” 
number, 
average 
living 
standards 
became 
increasingly 
endangered 
and 
this 
threat 
grew 
still 
more 
if 
neighboring 
tribes, 
due 
to 
their 
own 
internal 
population 
growth, 
increased 
their 
territorial 
incursions 
thus 
further 
diminishing 
the 
nature-given 
supply 
of 
goods 
available 
to 
the 
members 
of 
the 
first 
tribe. 
Internal 
as 
well 
as 
external 
population 
pressure 
then 
called 
for 
a 
solution 
to 
an 
increasingly 
urgent 
problem: 
namely 
sheer 
survival.

In 
fact, 
overhunting 
and 
animal 
extinction 
played 
a 
fateful 
role 

especially 
in 
the 
Americas, 
which 
were 
only 
occupied 
after 
the 
invention 
of 
bow 
and 
arrow. 
While 
the 
Americas 
originally 
exhibited 
pretty 
much 
the 
same 
fauna 
as 
the 
Eurasian 
continent—after 
all, 
for 
thousands 
of 
years 
animals 
could 
move 
from 
one 
continent 
to 
another 
across 
the 
Beringian 
land 
bridge—by 
the 
time 
of 
the 
European 
rediscovery 
of 
America 
some 
500 
years 
ago 
all 
large 
domesticable 
mammals 
(except 
for 
the 
llama 
in 
South 
America) 
had 
been 
hunted 
to 
extinction. 
Likewise, 
it 
appears 
now 
that 
the 
entire 
mega-
fauna 
that 
once 
inhabited 
Australia 
was 
hunted 
to 
extinction 
(except 
for 
the 
red 
kangaroo). 
It 
seems 
that 
this 
event 
occurred 
around 
40,000 
years 
ago, 
only 
a 
few 
thousand 
years 
after 
man 
had 
first 
arrived 
in 
Australia, 
and 
even 
without 
the 
help 
of 
bow 
and 
arrow, 
only 
with 
very 
primitive 
weapons 
and 
the 
help 
of 
fires 
used 
for 
the 
trapping 
of 
animals.

While 
the 
changes 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
“Neolithic 
Revolution” 
allowed 
for 
a 
significantly 
higher 
sustainable 
population 
size, 
the 
Malthusian 
problem 
was 
bound 
to 
eventually 
arise 
again, 
and 
the 
seemingly 
ultimate 
solution 
to 
the 
problem 
was 
only 
reached 
with 
the 
so-called 
“Industrial 
Revolution” 
that 
began 
in 
Europe 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
seventeenth 
century.

Incidentally, 
genetic 
analyses 
have 
revealed 
that 
all 
present 
dogs, 
including 
those 
in 
the 
Americas, 
stem 
most 
likely 
from 
a 
single 
litter 
to 
be 
located 
somewhere 
in 
East 
Asia. 
That 
is, 
it 
appears 
that 
the 
domestication 
of 
the 
dog 
did 
not 
occur 
independently 
at 
various 
places 
but 
at 
a 
single 
place 
from 
where 
it 
spread 
outward 
to 
ultimately 
encompass 
the 
entire 
globe.

“Men 
lived 
in 
polygamy 
and 
their 
women 
simultaneously 

in 
polyandry, 
and 
their 
children 
were 
considered 
as 
belonging 
to 
all 
of 
them. 
.... 
Each 
woman 
belonged 
to 
every 
man 
and 
each 
man 
to 
every 
woman.” 


Incidentally, 
socialist 
authors 
such 
as 
Friedrich 
Engels 
did 
not 
merely 
describe 
but 
glorify 
this 
institution, 
very 
much 
like 
they 
glorified 
the 
already 
mentioned 
institution 
of 
“primitive 
communism.” 
Indeed, 
socialists 
typically 
recognized, 
quite 
correctly, 
the 
joint 
emergence 
of 
private 
property 
and 
the 
institution 
of 
the 
family, 
and 
they 
thought 
(and 
hoped) 
that 
both 
institutions 
—private 
property 
in 
the 
means 
of 
production, 
including 
land, 
and 
the 
(monogamous) 
family—would 
ultimately 
disappear 
again 
with 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
future 
socialist 
society 
characterized 
by 
plenty 
(plentitude) 
of 
wealth 
and 
free 
love. 
Thus, 
after 
an 
arduous 
if 
necessary 
historical 
detour 
characterized 
by 
misery, 
exploitation, 
and 
male 
sexual 
domination, 
mankind 
would 
at 
long 
last 
return—on 
a 
higher 
level—to 
the 
very 
institutions 
characteristic 
of 
its 
own 
prehistoric 
“golden 
age.” 
Under 
socialism, 
monogamous 
marriage 
was 
to 
disappear 
along 
with 
private 
property. 
Choice 
in 
love 
would 
become 
free 
again. 
Men 
and 
women 
would 
unite 
and 
separate 
as 
they 
pleased. 
And 
in 
all 
of 
this, 
as 
socialist 
August 
Bebel 
wrote 
in 
his 
(at 
the 
times 
in 
the 
1880s 
and 
1890s) 
enormously 
popular 
book 
Die 
Frau 
und 
der 
Sozialismus, 
socialism 
would 
not 
create 
anything 
really 
new, 
but 
only 
“recreate 
on 
a 
higher 
level 
of 
culture 
and 
under 
new 
social 
forms 
what 
was 
universally 
valid 
on 
a 
more 
primitive 
cultural

before

society.”

Rationally 
motivated 
as 
the 
institution 
of 
the 
family 
was, 
the 
transition 
from 
a 
regime 
of 
“free 
love” 
to 
one 
of 
family 
life 
did 
not 
come 
without 
costs, 
and 
the 
associated 
benefits 
and 
costs 
were 
different 
for 
men 
and 
women. 
Surely, 
from 
the 
male’s 
point 
of 
view 
it 
was 
advantageous 
to 
have 
every 
woman 
accessible 
for 
sexual 
gratification. 
In 
addition, 
this 
greatly 
improved 
his 
chances 
of 
reproductive 
success. 
By 
having 
children 
with 
as 
many 
women 



as 
possible 
the 
likelihood 
of 
his 
genes 
being 
passed 
on 
into 
future 
generations 
was 
increased. 
And 
this 
was 
accomplished 
seemingly 
without 
any 
cost 
to 
him 
if 
the 
responsibility 
of 
raising 
children 
to 
maturity 
could 
be 
externalized 
onto 
society 
at 
large. 
In 
contrast, 
if 
sexual 
access 
was 
restricted 
to 
just 
one 
woman 
(in 
the 
case 
of 
monogamy) 
or 
a 
few 
women 
(in 
the 
case 
of 
polygamy) 
his 
chances 
of 
sexual 
gratification 
and 
of 
reproductive 
success 
were 
diminished. 
Moreover, 
men 
now 
had 
to 
weigh 
and 
compare 
the 
pros 
(benefits) 
and 
cons 
(costs) 
of 
sex 
and 
procreation—something 
they 
previously 
did 
not 
have 
to 
do. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
also 
primitive 
men 
could 
not 
fail 
to 
notice, 
at 
least 
eventually, 
that 
even 
under 
a 
regime 
of 
free 
love 
the 
chances 
of 
sexual 
gratification 
and 
reproductive 
success 
were 
by 
no 
means 
equal. 
Some 
males 
—the 
stronger 
and 
more 
attractive 
alpha 
males—had 
much 
better 
chances 
than 
others. 
In 
fact, 
as 
every 
animal 
breeder 
knows, 
just 
one 
male 
is 
sufficient 
to 
keep 
all 
females 
constantly 
impregnated. 
Thus, 
free 
love 
effectively 
meant 
that 
very 
few 
males 
“had” 
most 
of 
the 
women, 
and 
especially 
most 
of 
the 
attractive 
and 
reproductively 
most 
appealing 
women, 
and 
fathered 
most 
of 
the 
offspring, 
while 
most 
of 
the 
males 
had 
the 
dubious 
obligation 
of 
helping 
to 
bring 
up 
other 
men’s 
children. 
Surely, 
even 
the 
dimmest 
recognition 
of 
this 
fact 
must 
have 
posed 
a 
permanent 
threat 
to 
any 
intratribal 
solidarity 
and 
especially 
to 
any 
inter-male 
solidarity 
that 
was 
called 
for, 
for 
instance, 
in 
the 
defense 
against 
rival 
tribes; 
and 
this 
threat 
must 
have 
grown 
ever 
more 
intense 
the 
farther 
the 
population 
exceeded 
its 
optimum 
size. 
In 
contrast, 
the 
institution 
of 
a 
monogamous 
family 
and 
to 
a 
somewhat 
lesser 
degree 
also 
of 
a 
polygamous 
family 
offered 
to 
each 
male 
a 
somewhat 
equal 
chance 
of 
reproductive 
success 
and 
thus 
created 
a 
much 
greater 
incentive 
for 
every 
male 
to 
engage 
and 
invest 
in 
cooperative 
behavior. 


Matters 
are 
significantly 
different 
from 
the 
female 
point 
of 
view. 
After 
all, 
it 
is 
women 
who 
must 
bear 
the 
risk 
of 
pregnancy 
associated 
with 
sexual 
intercourse. 
It 
is 
they 
who 
are 
particularly 
vulnerable 
during 
pregnancy 
and 
following 
childbirth. 
Moreover, 
it 
is 
women 
who 
have 
a 
unique 
natural 
tie 
to 
children; 
for 
while 
there 
can 
be 
always 
some 
doubt 
as 
to 
paternity 
no 
doubt 
is 
possible 
as 
far 
as 
maternity 
is 
concerned. 
Every 
woman 
knows 
who 
her 
children 
are 
and 
who 
the 
children 
of 
other 
women 
are. 
In 
light 
of 
these 
natural 
facts 
the 
principal 
advantage 
of 
a 
regime 
of 
free 
love 
from 
a 
female 
point 
of 
view 
becomes 
apparent. 
Because 
of 
the 
greater 
risk 
and 
investment 
associated 
with 
sex 
for 
women, 
women 
tend 
to 
be 
more 
selective 
as 
far 
as 



their 
mating 
partner 
is 
concerned. 
Thus, 
in 
order 
to 
increase 
the 
likelihood 
of 
their 
own 
reproductive 
success, 
they 
exhibit 
a 
strong 
preference 
for 
mating 
partners 
who 
appear 
healthy, 
vigorous, 
attractive, 
bright, 
etc., 
i.e., 
in 
a 
word: 
for 
alpha 
males. 
And 
because 
males 
are 
less 
choosy 
in 
their 
selection 
of 
sex 
objects, 
under 
a 
system 
of 
free 
love 
even 
the 
least 
attractive 
females 
can 
realistically 
expect 
to 
be 
able 
to 
mate 
occasionally 
with 
some 
of 
the 
most 
attractive 
males 
and 
hence 
possibly 
pass 
their 
“superior” 
genes 
on 
to 
one’s 
own 
offspring. 
Obviously, 
this 
advantage 
disappears 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
institution 
of 
the 
family 
replaces 
a 
regime 
of 
free 
love. 
Each 
woman 
is 
now 
supposed 
to 
try 
her 
reproductive 
luck 
with 
just 
one 
or 
maybe 
a 
few 
sets 
of 
male 
genes, 
and 
in 
the 
great 
majority 
of 
cases 
these 
genes 
do 
not 
rank 
among 
the 
very 
best. 
What 
did 
women 
get 
out 
of 
marriage, 
then? 
Very 
little, 
it 
would 
seem, 
as 
long 
as 
the 
population 
was 
at 
or 
around 
its 
optimum 
size 
and 
the 
life 
of 
the 
hunter-gatherer 
tribe 
was 
characterized 
by 
comfort 
and 
plenty. 
This 
had 
to 
change, 
however, 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
population 
grew 
beyond 
this 
point. 
The 
more 
the 
population 
exceeded 
its 
optimum 
size 
the 
more 
intense 
grew 
the 
competition 
for 
the 
limited 
food 
supplies. 
Whatever 
inter-female 
solidarity 
existed 
before 
increasingly 
weakened 
now. 
Naturally, 
each 
woman 
was 
interested 
in 
assuring 
her 
own 
reproductive 
success 
and 
helping 
her 
own 
children 
reach 
maturity 
and 
thus 
came 
into 
conflict 
with 
every 
other 
woman 
and 
her 
children. 
Even 
killing 
another 
woman’s 
child 
in 
order 
to 
further 
the 
prospect 
of 
survival 
for 
one’s 
own 
children 
was 
increasingly 
considered 
an 
option 
in 
this 
situation. 
(Incidentally, 
the 
same 
sort 
of 
inter-female 
competition 
for 
reproductive 
success 
still 
prevails 
to 
some 
extent 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
polygamous 
relationships 
and 
explains 
some 
of 
the 
peculiar 
instabilities 
and 
tensions 
inherent 
in 
such 
relationships.) 
In 
this 
situation, 
each 
woman 
(and 
her 
kids) 
is 
in 
increasing 
need 
for 
personal 
protection. 
But 
who 
would 
be 
willing 
to 
provide 
such 
protection? 
Most 
children 
have 
the 
same 
father—from 
among 
the 
few 
alpha 
males 
endowed 
with 
more-thanequal 
chances 
of 
procreation—but 
they 
have 
different 
mothers. 
Accordingly, 
the 
protection 
of 
one 
woman 
and 
her 
children 
from 
another 
cannot 
be 
expected 
to 
come 
from 
the 
children’s 
father, 
because 
the 
father 
is 
very 
often 
the 
same 
one. 
Nor 
can 
it 
be 
expected 
to 
come 
from 
another 
male; 
for 
why 
should 
a 
male 
offer 
personal 
support 
and 
protection 
to 
a 
woman 
who 
entertained 
sexual 
relations 
with 
other 
men 
and 
whose 
children 
were 
fathered 
by 
other 
men, 
especially 
if 
this 
offspring 
threatened 
his 
own 
standard 
of 



living? 
A 
woman 
could 
only 
secure 
personal 
protection 
from 
a 
man 
if 
she 
forewent 
all 
of 
the 
advantages 
of 
free 
love 
and 
promised 
instead 
to 
grant 
her 
sexual 
favors 
exclusively 
to 
him 
and 
thus 
managed 
to 
assure 
him 
also 
that 
her 
children 
were 
always 
his 
as 
well. 


Distinctly 
male 
and 
female 
perspectives 
exist 
not 
only 
as 
far 
as 
the 
very 
establishment 
of 
the 
institution 
of 
the 
family 
is 
concerned 
but 
also 
regarding 
the 
importance 
of 
marital 
fidelity 
in 
maintaining 
its 
stability. 
The 
difference 
between 
male 
and 
female 
calculations 
in 
this 
regard 
has 
its 
reason 
in 
the 
natural 
fact 
that, 
at 
least 
until 
the 
very 
recent 
development 
of 
reliable 
genetic 
paternity 
tests, 
a 
child’s 
mother 
was 
always 
known 
in 
a 
way—with 
a 
degree 
of 
certainty—that 
was 
unavailable 
and 
unattainable 
for 
the 
child’s 
father. 
As 
folk 
wisdom 
has 
it: 
mother’s 
baby, 
father’s 
maybe. 
This 
fact, 
again 
quite 
“naturally,” 
had 
to 
lead 
to 
significantly 
different—asymmetric—expectations 
regarding 
appropriate 
(and 
inappropriate) 
male 
and 
female 
marital 
conduct. 
Of 
course, 
in 
order 
to 
assure 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
institution 
of 
Thus, 
in 
response 
to 
mounting 
population 
pressure 
a 
new 
mode 
of 
societal 
organization 
had 
come 
into 
existence, 
displacing 
the 
hunter-gatherer 
lifestyle 
that 
had 
been 
characteristic 
of 
most 
of 
human 
history. 
As 
Ludwig 
von 
Mises 
summarized 
the 
matter: 
the 
family 
any 
form 
of 
marital 
infidelity 
had 
to 
be 
socially 
disapproved; 
but 
disapproval 
had 
to 
be 
far 
more 
pronounced 
and 
the 
possible 
sanctions 
far 
more 
severe 
in 
the 
case 
of 
female 
infidelity 
than 
in 
the 
case 
of 
male 
infidelity. 
While 
this 
may 
appear 
“unfair,” 
it 
was 
in 
fact 
quite 
rational 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
“nature 
of 
things,” 
because 
female 
infidelity 
involved 
a 
far 
greater 
risk 
for 
betrayed 
husbands 
than 
male 
infidelity 
involved 
for 
betrayed 
wives. 
A 
wife’s 
infidelity 
can 
be 
the 
first 
step 
leading 
to 
a 
divorce 
from 
her 
husband 
just 
as 
a 
husband’s 
infidelity 
can 
be 
the 
first 
step 
leading 
to 
a 
divorce 
from 
his 
wife. 
In 
this 
regard, 
the 
situation 
is 
the 
same 
(symmetric) 
in 
both 
cases 
and 
the 
“sin” 
committed 
is 
equally 
grave. 
However, 
if 
and 
insofar 
as 
marital 
infidelity 
does 
not 
lead 
to 
divorce, 
the 
“sin” 
committed 
by 
a 
woman 
must 
be 
considered 
far 
graver 
than 
that 
committed 
by 
a 
man. 
Because 
extramarital 
sexual 
affairs 
may 
lead 
to 
pregnancies, 
and 
if 
a 
so-impregnated 
woman 
then 
stays 
with 
her 
husband, 
the 
real 
danger 
arises 
that 
she 
might 
be 
tempted 
to 
present 
her 
illegitimate 
offspring 
to 
her 
husband 
as 
his 
own, 
thus 
deceiving 
him 
to 
support 
another 
man’s 
child. 
No 
such 
danger 
exists 
in 
the 
opposite 
case: 
no 
man 
can 
submit 
his 
illegitimate 
offspring 
to 
his 
wife 
without 
her 
knowing 
the 
truth 
of 
the 



matter. 
Hence, 
the 
far 
greater 
social 
stigma 
attached 
to 
female 
as 
compared 
to 
male 
infidelity. 
(Incidentally—and 
also 
quite 
rationally—in 
the 
case 
of 
male 
infidelity 
a 
similar 
distinction 
is 
made: 
the 
offense 
is 
considered 
more 
severe 
if 
a 
man 
has 
an 
affair 
with 
a 
married 
woman 
than 
with 
an 
unmarried 
one; 
for 
in 
the 
former 
case 
he 
becomes 
a 
potential 
accomplice 
to 
a 
further 
female 
act 
of 
deception 
whereas 
in 
the 
latter 
case 
he 
does 
not. 
Accordingly, 
in 
recognition 
of 
this 
distinction 
and 
so 
as 
to 
accommodate 
the 
rather 
indiscriminate 
male 
sex 
drive, 
prostitution 
has 
become 
a 
near-universal 
social 
institution.)

FROM 
THE 
MALTHUSIAN 
TRAP 
TO 
THE 
INDUSTRIAL 
REVOLUTION: 
REFLECTIONS 
ON 
SOCIAL 
EVOLUTION 


I. 
ECONOMIC 
THEORY 
FOR 
ECONOMIC 
THEORY 
THE 
QUESTION 
OF 
how 
to 
increase 
wealth 
and 
get 
rich 
has 
a 
straightforward 
answer. 


It 
has 
three 
components: 
you 
get 
richer 
(a) 
through 
capital 
accumulation, 
i.e., 
the 
construction 
of 
intermediate 
“producer” 
or 
“capital” 
goods 
that 
can 
produce 
more 
consumer 
goods 
per 
unit 
time 
than 
can 
be 
produced 
without 
them 
or 
goods 
that 
cannot 
be 
produced 
at 
all 
with 
just 
land 
and 
labor 
(and 
capital 
accumulation 
in 
turn 
has 
something 
to 
do 
with 
(low) 
time 
preference); 


(b) 
through 
participation 
and 
integration 
in 
the 
division 
of 
labor; 
and 
(c) 
through 
population 
control, 
i.e., 
by 
maintaining 
the 
optimal 
population 
size. 
Robinson 
Crusoe, 
alone 
on 
his 
island, 
has 
originally 
only 
his 
own 
“labor” 
and 
“land” 
(nature) 
at 
his 
disposal. 
He 
is 
as 
rich 
(or 
poor) 
as 
nature 
happens 
to 
make 
him. 
Some 
of 
his 
most 
urgently 
felt 
needs 
he 
may 
be 
able 
to 
satisfy 
directly, 
equipped 
only 
with 
his 
bare 
hands. 
At 
the 
very 
least, 
he 
can 
always 
satisfy 
his 
desire 
of 
leisure 
in 
this 
way: 
immediately. 
However, 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
most 
of 
his 
wants 
requires 
more 
than 
bare 
nature 
and 
hands, 
i.e., 
some 
indirect 
or 
roundabout—and 
time-consuming—production 
method. 
Most, 
indeed 
almost 
all 
goods 
and 
associated 
sorts 
of 
satisfaction 
require 
the 
help 
of 
some 
only 
indirectly 
useful 
tools: 
of 
producer 
or 
capital 
goods. 
With 
the 
help 
of 
producer 
goods 
it 
becomes 
possible 
to 
produce 
more 
per 
unit 
time 
of 
the 
very 
goods 
that 
can 
be 
produced 
also 
with 
bare 
hands 
(such 
as 
leisure) 
or 
to 
produce 
goods 
that 
cannot 
be 
produced 
at 
all 
with 
just 
land 
and 
labor. 
In 
order 
to 
catch 
more 
fish 
than 
with 
his 
bare 
hands 
Crusoe 
builds 
a 
net; 
or 
in 
order 
to 
build 
a 
shelter 
that 
he 
cannot 
build 
with 
his 
bare 
hands 
at 
all, 
he 
must 
construct 
an 
axe. 



However, 
to 
build 
a 
net 
or 
an 
axe 
requires 
a 
sacrifice 
(saving). 
To 
be 
sure, 
production 
with 
the 
help 
of 
producer 
goods 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
more 
productive 
than 
without 
it; 
Crusoe 
would 
not 
spend 
any 
time 
building 
a 
net 
if 
he 
did 
not 
expect 
that 
he 
could 
catch 
more 
fish 
per 
unit 
time 
with 
the 
net 
than 
without 
it. 
Nonetheless, 
the 
production 
of 
a 
producer 
good 
involves 
a 
sacrifice; 
for 
it 
takes 
time 
to 
build 
a 
producer 
good 
and 
the 
same 
time 
cannot 
be 
used 
for 
the 
enjoyment 
or 
consumption 
of 
leisure 
or 
other 
immediately 
available 
consumer 
goods. 
In 
deciding 
whether 
or 
not 
to 
build 
the 
productivity 
enhancing 
net, 
Crusoe 
must 
compare 
and 
rank 
two 
expected 
states 
of 
satisfaction: 
the 
satisfaction 
which 
he 
can 
attain 
now, 
without 
any 
further 
waiting, 
and 
the 
satisfaction 
that 
he 
can 
attain 
only 
later, 
after 
a 
longer 
waiting 
time. 
In 
deciding 
to 
build 
the 
net, 
Crusoe 
has 
determined 
that 
he 
ranks 
the 
sacrifice: 
the 
value 
forgone 
of 
greater 
consumption 
now, 
in 
the 
present, 
below 
the 
reward: 
the 
value 
of 
greater 
consumption 
later, 
in 
the 
future. 
Otherwise, 
if 
he 
had 
ranked 
these 
magnitudes 
differently, 
he 
would 
have 
abstained 
from 
building 
the 
net. 


This 
weighing 
and 
the 
possible 
exchange 
of 
present 
against 
future 
goods 
and 
associated 
satisfactions 
are 
governed 
by 
time 
preference. 
Present 
goods 
are 
invariably 
more 
valuable 
than 
future 
ones, 
and 
we 
exchange 
the 
former 
against 
the 
latter 
only 
at 
a 
premium. 
The 
degree, 
however, 
to 
which 
present 
goods 
are 
preferred 
to 
future 
ones, 
or 
the 
willingness 
to 
forgo 
some 
possible 
present 
consumption 
for 
a 
greater 
future 
consumption, 
i.e., 
the 
willingness 
to 
save, 
is 
different 
from 
person 
to 
person 
and 
one 
point 
in 
time 
to 
another. 
Depending 
on 
the 
height 
of 
his 
personal 
time 
preferences 
Crusoe 
will 
save 
and 
invest 
more 
or 
less 
and 
his 
standard 
of 
living 
will 
be 
higher 
or 
lower. 
The 
lower 
his 
time 
preference, 
i.e., 
the 
easier 
it 
is 
for 
Crusoe 
to 
delay 
current 
gratification 
in 
exchange 
for 
some 
anticipated 
greater 
satisfaction 
in 
the 
future, 
the 
more 
capital 
goods 
Crusoe 
will 
accumulate 
and 
the 
higher 
will 
be 
his 
standard 
of 
living. 


Second, 
people 
can 
increase 
their 
wealth 
through 
participation 
in 
the 
division 
of 
labor. 
We 
assume 
that 
Crusoe 
is 
joined 
by 
Friday. 
Because 
of 
their 
natural, 
physical, 
or 
mental 
differences 
or 
the 
differences 
of 
the 
“land” 
(nature) 
they 
face, 
almost 
automatically 
absolute 
and 
comparative 
advantages 
in 
the 
production 
of 
various 
goods 
emerge. 
Crusoe 
is 
better 
equipped 
to 
produce 
one 
good 
and 
Friday 
another. 
If 
they 
specialize 
in 
what 
each 
is 
particularly 
good 
at 
producing, 
the 
total 
output 
of 
goods 
will 
be 
larger 
than 
if 



they 
had 
not 
specialized 
and 
remained 
in 
a 
position 
of 
an 
isolated 
and 
self-
sufficient 
producer. 
Alternatively, 
if 
either 
Crusoe 
or 
Friday 
is 
the 
superior 
producer 
of 
every 
good, 
the 
all-around 
superior 
producer 
is 
to 
specialize 
in 
those 
activities 
in 
which 
his 
advantage 
is 
especially 
great 
and 
the 
all-around 
inferior 
producer 
must 
specialize 
in 
those 
activities 
in 
which 
his 
disadvantage 
is 
comparatively 
smaller. 
Thereby, 
too, 
the 
overall 
output 
of 
goods 
produced 
will 
be 
greater 
than 
if 
each 
had 
remained 
in 
self-sufficient 
isolation. 


Third, 
the 
wealth 
in 
society 
depends 
on 
the 
population 
size, 
i.e., 
on 
whether 
or 
not 
the 
population 
is 
kept 
at 
its 
optimum 
size. 
That 
wealth 
depends 
on 
the 
population 
size 
follows 
from 
the 
“law 
of 
returns” 
and 
the 
“Malthusian 
law 
of 
population,” 
which 
Ludwig 
von 
Mises 
has 
hailed 
as 


one 
of 
the 
great 
achievements 
of 
thought. 
Together 
with 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
it 
provided 
the 
foundations 
of 
modern 
biology 
and 
for 
the 
theory 
of 
evolution; 
the 
importance 
of 
these 
two 
fundamental 
theorems 
for 
the 
sciences 
of 
human 
action 
is 
second 
only 
to 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
regularity 
in 
the 
intertwinement 
and 
sequence 
of 
market 
phenomena 
and 
their 
inevitable 
determination 
by 
the 
market 
data. 
The 
objections 
raised 
against 
the 
Malthusian 
law 
as 
well 
as 
against 
the 
law 
of 
returns 
are 
vain 
and 
trivial. 
Both 
laws 
are 
indisputable.[1] 


In 
its 
most 
general 
and 
abstract 
form, 
the 
law 
of 
returns 
states 
that 
for 
any 
combination 
of 
two 
or 
more 
production 
factors 
there 
exists 
an 
optimum 
combination 
(such 
that 
any 
deviation 
from 
it 
involves 
material 
waste, 
or 
“efficiency 
losses”). 
Applied 
to 
the 
two 
original 
factors 
of 
production, 
labor 
and 
land 
(nature-given 
goods), 
the 
law 
implies 
that 
if 
one 
were 
to 
continuously 
increase 
the 
quantity 
of 
labor 
(population) 
while 
the 
quantity 
of 
land 
(and 
the 
available 
technology) 
remained 
fixed 
and 
unchanged, 
eventually 
a 
point 
will 
be 
reached 
where 
the 
physical 
output 
per 
labor-unit 
input 
is 
maximized. 
This 
point 
marks 
the 
optimal 
population 
size. 
If 
the 
population 
were 
to 
grow 
beyond 
this 
size, 
income 
per 
head 
would 
fall; 
and 
likewise, 
income 
per 
head 
would 
be 
less 
if 
the 
population 
were 
to 
fall 
below 
this 
point 
(as 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
would 
shrink, 
with 
an 
accompanying 
efficiency 
loss). 
To 
maintain 
the 
optimal 
level 
of 
income 
per 
person, 
then, 
the 



population 
must 
no 
longer 
grow 
but 
remain 
stationary. 
Only 
one 
way 
exists 
for 
such 
a 
stationary 
society 
to 
further 
increase 
real 
income 
per 
head 
or 
to 
grow 
in 
size 
without 
a 
loss 
in 
per 
capita 
income: 
through 
technological 
innovation, 
i.e., 
by 
the 
employment 
of 
better, 
more 
efficient 
tools 
made 
possible 
through 
savings 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
abstention 
from 
leisure 
or 
other 
immediate 
consumption. 
If 
there 
is 
no 
technological 
innovation 
(technology 
is 
fixed), 
the 
only 
possible 
way 
for 
the 
population 
to 
grow 
in 
size 
without 
a 
concomitant 
fall 
in 
per 
capita 
income 
is 
through 
taking 
more 
(and 
possibly 
better) 
land 
into 
use. 
If 
there 
is 
no 
additional 
land 
available 
and 
technology 
is 
fixed 
at 
a 
‘given’ 
level, 
however, 
then 
any 
population 
increase 
beyond 
the 
optimal 
size 
must 
lead 
to 
a 
progressive 
decline 
in 
per 
capita 
income. 


This 
latter 
situation 
has 
been 
referred 
to 
also 
as 
the 
“Malthusian 
trap.” 
Ludwig 
von 
Mises 
has 
characterized 
it 
thus: 


The 
purposive 
adjustment 
of 
the 
birthrate 
to 
the 
supply 
of 
the 
material 
potentialities 
of 
well-being 
is 
an 
indispensable 
condition 
of 
human 
life 
and 
action, 
of 
civilization, 
and 
of 
any 
improvement 
in 
wealth 
and 
welfare. 
... 
Where 
the 
average 
standard 
of 
living 
is 
impaired 
by 
the 
excessive 
increase 
in 
population 
figures, 
irreconcilable 
conflicts 
of 
interest 
arise. 
Each 
individual 
is 
again 
a 
rival 
of 
all 
other 
individuals 
in 
the 
struggle 
for 
survival. 
The 
annihilation 
of 
rivals 
is 
the 
only 
means 
to 
increase 
one’s 
well-being. 
... 
As 
natural 
conditions 
are, 
man 
has 
only 
the 
choice 
between 
the 
pitiless 
war 
of 
each 
against 
each 
or 
social 
cooperation. 
But 
social 
cooperation 
is 
impossible 
if 
people 
give 
rein 
to 
the 
natural 
impulses 
of 
proliferation.[2] 


It 
has 
been 
already 
described 
and 
explained 
(in 
the 
previous 
chapter) 
how 
all 
this 
worked 
out 
in 
hunter-gatherer 
societies. 
It 
is 
conceivable 
that 
mankind 
had 
never 
left 
the 
seemingly 
comfortable 
hunter-gatherer 
lifestyle. 
This 
would 
have 
been 
possible, 
if 
only 
mankind 
had 
been 
able 
to 
restrict 
all 
population 
growth 
beyond 
the 
optimal 
size 
of 
a 
hunter-gatherer 
band 
(of 
a 
few 
dozen 
members). 
In 
that 
case, 
we 
might 
still 
live 
today 
very 
much 
like 
all 
of 
our 
direct 
forebears 
had 
lived 
for 
tens 
of 
thousands 
of 
years, 
until 
some 



11,000 
or 
12,000 
years 
ago. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
however, 
mankind 
did 
not 
manage 
to 
do 
so. 
The 
population 
did 
grow, 
and 
accordingly 
increasingly 
larger 
territories 
had 
to 
be 
taken 
into 
possession 
until 
one 
ran 
out 
of 
additional 
land. 
Moreover, 
technological 
advances 
made 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
hunter-gatherer 
societies 
(such 
as 
the 
invention 
of 
bow 
and 
arrow 
some 
20,000 
years 
ago, 
for 
instance) 
increased 
(rather 
than 
decreased) 
the 
speed 
of 
this 
expansionism. 
Because 
hunters 
and 
gatherers 
(like 
all 
nonhuman 
animals) 
only 
depleted 
(consumed) 
the 
supply 
of 
nature-given 
goods, 
but 
did 
not 
produce 
and 
thus 
add 
to 
this 
supply, 
better 
tools 
in 
their 
hands 
hastened 
(rather 
than 
delayed) 
the 
process 
of 
territorial 
expansion. 


The 
Neolithic 
Revolution, 
which 
began 
about 
11,000 
years 
ago, 
brought 
some 
temporary 
relief. 
The 
invention 
of 
agriculture 
and 
animal 
husbandry 
allowed 
for 
a 
larger 
number 
of 
people 
to 
survive 
on 
the 
same, 
unchanged 
quantity 
of 
land, 
and 
the 
institution 
of 
the 
family, 
in 
privatizing 
(internalizing) 
the 
benefits 
as 
well 
as 
the 
costs 
of 
the 
production 
of 
offspring, 
provided 
a 
new, 
hitherto 
unknown 
check 
on 
the 
growth 
of 
population. 
But 
neither 
innovation 
brought 
a 
permanent 
solution 
to 
the 
problem 
of 
excess 
population. 
Men 
still 
could 
not 
keep 
their 
pants 
up, 
and 
the 
greater 
productivity 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
new, 
nonparasitic 
mode 
of 
production 
represented 
by 
agriculture 
and 
animal 
husbandry 
was 
quickly 
exhausted 
again 
by 
a 
growing 
population 
size. 
A 
significantly 
larger 
number 
of 
people 
could 
be 
sustained 
on 
the 
globe 
than 
before, 
but 
mankind 
did 
not 
yet 
escape 
from 
the 
Malthusian 
trap—until 
some 
200 
years 
ago 
with 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
so-called 
Industrial 
Revolution. 


II. 
ECONOMIC 
HISTORY: 
THE 
PROBLEM 
The 
problem 
to 
be 
explained 
in 
the 
following 
has 
been 
captured 
by 
two 
charts 
depicting 
world 
population 
growth 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
and 
the 
development 
of 
per 
capita 
income 
(average 
living 
standards) 
on 
the 
other. 


The 
first 
chart, 
taken 
from 
Colin 
McEvedy 
and 
Richard 
Jones,[3] 
shows 
human 
population 
growth 
from 
400 
BC 
until 
the 
present 
(2,000 
AD). 
The 
population 
size 
was 
about 
four 
million 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Neolithic 
Revolution. 
But 
up 
until 
about 
7,000 
years 
ago 
(5,000 
BC) 
the 
area 
under 
crops 
(first 
merely 
in 
the 
region 
of 
the 
Fertile 
Crescent 
and 
then 
also 
in 
northern 
China) 
was 
too 
small 
to 
have 
much 
of 
an 
effect 
on 
the 
global 



population 
size. 
By 
then 
the 
population 
had 
grown 
to 
about 
five 
million. 
But 
since 
then, 
population 
growth 
increased 
rapidly: 
2,000 
years 
later 
(3,000 
BC) 
it 
had 
almost 
tripled 
to 
fourteen 
million, 
3,000 
years 
ago 
(1,000 
BC) 
it 
had 
reached 
fifty 
million,[4] 
and 
only 
some 
500 
years 
later, 
when 
the 
chart 
sets 
in, 
the 
world 
population 
size 
stood 
at 
about 
100 
million. 
Since 
then, 
as 
the 
chart 
indicates, 
the 
population 
size 
has 
continued 
to 
increase 
slowly 
but 
more 
or 
less 
steadily 
up 
until 
about 
1800 
(to 
about 
720 
million), 
when 
a 
significant 
break 
occurred 
and 
the 
population 
growth 
sharply 
increased 
to 
presently, 
only 
some 
200 
years 
later 
to 
reach 
seven 
billion. 



FIGURE 
I 


TOTAL 
WORLD 
POPULATION 
(MILLIONS) 
UNITS—MEASURED 
IN 
MILLIONS 
OF 
PEOPLE 


The 
second 
chart, 
taken 
from 
Gregory 
Clark,[5] 
shows 
the 
development 
of 
per 
capita 
income 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
recorded 
human 
history 
to 
the 
present. 
It 
too 
shows 
a 
significant 
break 
occurring 
at 
around 
1800. 
Until 
that 
time, 
i.e., 
for 
most 
of 
recorded 
human 
history, 
real 
income 
per 
capita 
(in 
terms 
of 
food, 
housing, 
clothing, 
heating, 
and 
lighting) 
did 
not 
rise. 
That 
is, 
average 
living 
standards 
in 
eighteenth 
century 
England 
were 
not 
significantly 
higher 
than 
those 
in 
ancient 
Babylon, 
where 
the 
oldest 
records 
of 
wage 
rates 
and 
various 
consumer 
goods 
prices 
could 
be 
found. 
Naturally, 
with 
sedentary 
life 
and 
private 
landownership 
distinct 
differences 
in 
wealth 
and 
income 
came 
into 
existence. 
There 
existed 
large 
landowners 
(lords) 
who 
lived 
in 
enormous 
luxury, 
even 
by 
today’s 
standards, 
almost 
from 
the 
beginnings 
of 
settled 
life. 
Nor 
were 
average 
living 
standards 
always 
and 
everywhere 
equally 
low. 
There 
existed 
pronounced 
regional 
differences 
between, 
for 
instance, 
English, 
Indian, 
and 
West 
African 
real 
incomes 
in 
1800. 
And 
of 
course, 
as 
far 
as 
cross-time 
comparisons 
are 
concerned, 
many 
technologies 
existed 
in 
1800 
England, 
which 
were 
unknown 
in 
ancient 
Rome, 
Greece, 
China, 
or 
Babylon. 
Yet 
in 
any 
case, 
everywhere 
and 
at 
all 
times 
the 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
the 
population, 
the 
mass 
of 
small 
landowners 
and 
most 
laborers, 
lived 
near 
or 
only 
a 
little 
bit 
above 
subsistence 
level. 
There 
were 
ups 
and 
downs 
in 
real 
incomes, 
due 
to 
various 
external 
events, 
but 
nowhere 
was 
there 
a 
continuous 
upward 
trend 
in 
real 
income 
per 
person 
discernable 
until 
about 
1800.

In 
combination, 
both 
charts 
capture 
the 
world-historic 
significance 
of 
the 
so-called 
Industrial 
Revolution, 
which 
occurred 
some 
200 
years 
ago,

as 
the 
significance—and 
in 
particular 
the

the 
previous, 
Malthusian 
stage 
of 
human 
development. 
Until 
sometime 
around 
1800, 
little

in 
the 
economies 
of 
humans 
and 
nonhuman 
animals 
existed. 
For 
animals 
(and 
plants) 
it 
is 
always 
and 
invariably 
true 
that 
an 
increase 
in 
their 
number 
will 
encroach 
upon 
the 
available 
means 
of 
subsistence 
and 
eventually 
lead 
to 
overpopulation, 
to 
“supernumerary 
specimens,” 
as 
Mises 
has 
called 
them, 
which 
must 
be 
“weeded 
out” 
due 
to 
a 
lack 
of 
sustenance. 
Today, 
we 
know 
that 
as 
far 
as 
humans 
are 
concerned, 
this 
must 
not 
be 
so: 
no 
supernumerary 
specimens 
who 
are 
thus 
weeded 
out 
exist 
in 
modern, 
western 
societies. 
But 
for 
most 
of 
human 
life 
this 
was 
indeed 
the 
case. 


To 
be 
sure, 
the 
population 
size 
could 
grow, 
mostly 
because 
more 
land 
was 
taken 
into 
possession 
for 
agricultural 
use, 
and 
partly 
because 
of 
better 
technology 
incorporated 
in 
producer 
goods 
and 
an 
extended 
and 
intensified 
division 
of 
labor. 
But 
all 
such 
economic 
“gains” 
were 
always 
eaten 
up 
quickly 
by 
a 
growing 
population 
that 
again 
encroached 
upon 
the 
available 



means 
of 
subsistence 
and 
led 
to 
overpopulation 
and 
the 
emergence 
of 
the 
“supernumerary 
specimen” 
for 
whom 
there 
was 
no 
space 
in 
the 
division 
of 
labor 
and 
who 
consequently 
had 
to 
die 
out 
silently 
or 
become 
a 
menace 
(an 
economic 
“bad”) 
in 
the 
form 
of 
beggars, 
vagrants, 
plunderers, 
bandits, 
or 
warriors. 
Throughout 
most 
of 
human 
history, 
then, 
the 
iron 
law 
of 
wages 
held 
sway. 
Income 
and 
wages 
were 
held 
down 
near 
subsistence 
level 
owing 
to 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
substantial 
class 
of 
supernumerary 
specimens. 


III. 
HISTORY 
EXPLAINED 
Why 
did 
it 
take 
so 
long 
to 
get 
out 
of 
the 
Malthusian 
trap; 
and 
what 
happened 
that 
we 
finally 
succeeded? 
Why 
did 
it 
take 
so 
long 
until 
we 
gave 
up 
a 
hunter-
gatherer 
existence 
in 
favor 
of 
an 
existence 
as 
agricultural 
settlers? 
And 
why, 
even 
after 
the 
invention 
of 
agriculture 
and 
animal 
husbandry, 
did 
it 
take 
more 
than 
another 
10,000 
years 
until 
mankind’s 
seemingly 
final 
escape 
from 
the 
Malthusian 
trap? 
Economic 
theory, 
or 
what 
I 
have 
said 
about 
it, 
does 
not 
and 
cannot 
answer 
these 
questions. 


The 
standard 
answer 
among 
economists, 
in 
particular 
also 
among 
libertarian 
economists, 
is: 
there 
must 
have 
been 
institutional 
impediments, 
in 
particular 
an 
insufficient 
protection 
of 
private 
property 
rights, 
that 
prevented 
a 
quicker 
development 
and 
these 
impediments 
were 
removed 
only 
recently 
(about 
1800). 
This, 
essentially, 
is 
also 
Ludwig 
von 
Mises’s 
explanation.[6] 
Likewise, 
Murray 
N. 
Rothbard 
has 
advanced 
similar 
ideas.[7] 
I 
want 
to 
argue 
that 
this 
explanation 
is 
mistaken 
or 
at 
least 
insufficient 
and 
present 
the 
outline 
of 
an 
alternative 
(hypothetical) 
explanation. 


For 
one, 
hunters 
and 
gatherers, 
from 
all 
we 
know, 
had 
plenty 
of 
free 
time 
on 
their 
hands 
to 
invent 
agriculture 
and 
animal 
husbandry. 
Again 
and 
again 
and 
at 
countless 
places, 
they 
suffered 
from 
excess 
population 
and 
consequently 
falling 
incomes; 
and 
yet, 
although 
the 
opportunity 
cost 
of 
forgone 
leisure 
must 
have 
been 
low, 
no 
one 
anywhere, 
for 
tens 
of 
thousands 
of 
years, 
thought 
of 
agriculture 
and 
animal 
husbandry 
as 
an 
(at 
least 
temporary) 
escape 
from 
Malthusian 
conditions. 
Instead, 
until 
about 
11,000 
years 
ago 
hunter-gatherer 
tribes 
answered 
the 
recurring 
challenge 
of 
overpopulation 
always 
either 
by 
migration, 
i.e., 
by 
taking 
additional 
land 
into 
use 
(until 
they 
finally 
ran 
out 
of 
land) 
or 
by 
fighting 
each 
other 
to 
the 
death 
until 
the 
population 
size 
was 
sufficiently 
reduced 
to 
prevent 
real 
incomes 



from 
falling. 


As 
well, 
property 
rights 
in 
settled 
societies 
were 
well 
protected 
at 
many 
places 
and 
times. 
The 
idea 
of 
private 
property 
and 
the 
successful 
protection 
of 
private 
property 
are 
not 
inventions 
and 
institutions 
of 
the 
recent 
past 
but 
have 
been 
known 
for 
a 
long 
time 
and 
practiced 
almost 
from 
the 
beginnings 
of 
settled 
life. 
From 
all 
we 
know, 
for 
instance, 
property 
rights 
in 
1200 
England 
and 
in 
much 
of 
feudal 
Europe 
were 
better 
protected 
than 
they 
are 
today 
in 
contemporary 
England 
and 
Europe. 
That 
is, 
every 
institutional 
incentive 
favorable 
to 
capital 
accumulation 
and 
division 
of 
labor 
was 
in 
place—and 
yet 
nowhere, 
until 
about 
1800, 
did 
mankind 
succeed 
in 
extricating 
itself 
from 
the 
Malthusian 
trap 
of 
excess 
population 
and 
stagnating 
per 
capita 
incomes. 
Thus, 
the 
institution 
of 
property-protection 
can 
and 
should 
be 
regarded 
as 
only 
a 
necessary, 
but 
not 
also 
as 
a 
sufficient 
condition 
of 
economic 
growth 
(rising 
per 
capita 
incomes). 


There 
must 
be 
something 
else—some 
other 
factor, 
not 
appearing 
in 
economic 
theory—which 
will 
have 
to 
explain 
all 
this. 


Part 
of 
the 
answer 
is 
obvious: 
mankind 
did 
not 
get 
out 
of 
the 
Malthusian 
trap 
because, 
as 
noted 
before, 
men 
could 
not 
keep 
their 
pants 
up. 
If 
they 
had 
done 
so, 
there 
would 
have 
been 
no 
excess 
population. 
This 
can 
be 
only 
part 
of 
the 
answer, 
however. 
Because 
population 
control 
can 
prevent 
the 
fall 
of 
real 
incomes, 
but 
it 
cannot 
make 
incomes 
rise.[8] 
Some 
other, 
“empirical” 
factor 
not 
figuring 
in 
pure 
(aprioristic) 
economic 
theory 
must 
explain 
the 
length 
of 
the 
Malthusian 
age 
and 
how 
we 
finally 
got 
out 
of 
it. 
This 
missing 
factor 
is 
the 
historical 
variable 
of 
human 
intelligence, 
and 
the 
simple 
answer 
to 
the 
above 
questions, 
then, 
(to 
be 
elaborated 
in 
the 
following) 
is: 
because 
for 
most 
of 
history 
mankind 
was 
simply 
not 
intelligent 
enough—and 
it 
takes 
time 
to 
breed 
intelligence.[9] 


Until 
some 
11,000 
or 
so 
years 
ago, 
mankind 
was 
not 
intelligent 
enough, 
such 
that 
not 
even 
its 
brightest 
members 
were 
capable 
of 
conceiving 
the 
idea 
of 
indirect 
or 
roundabout 
consumer 
goods 
production 
that 
underlies 
agriculture 
and 
animal 
husbandry. 
The 
idea 
of 
first 
planting 
crops, 
then 
tending 
and 
protecting 
and 
finally 
harvesting 
them 
is 
not 
obvious 
or 
trivial. 
Nor 
is 
the 
idea 
of 
taming, 
husbanding, 
and 
breeding 
animals 
obvious 
or 
trivial. 
It 
requires 
a 
considerable 
degree 
of 
intelligence 
to 
conceive 
of 
such 
notions. 
It 
took 
tens 
of 
thousands 
of 
years 
of 
natural 
selection 
under 
hunter-
gatherer 
conditions 
to 
finally 
breed 
enough 
intelligence 
to 
make 
such 



cognitive 
achievements 
possible. 


Similarly, 
it 
took 
several 
thousand 
years 
more 
of 
natural 
selection 
under 
agricultural 
conditions, 
then, 
to 
reach 
a 
threshold 
in 
the 
development 
of 
human 
intelligence 
(or 
more 
precisely: 
of 
low 
time 
preference 
correlated 
with 
high 
intelligence) 
such 
that 
productivity 
growth 
could 
continuously 
outstrip 
any 
population 
growth. 
From 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Neolithic 
Revolution 
until 
about 
1800 
enough 
inventions 
(technological 
improvements) 
were 
made 
by 
bright 
people 
(and 
imitated 
by 
others 
of 
lesser 
intelligence) 
to 
account 
(in 
addition 
to 
more 
agriculturally 
used 
land) 
for 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
world 
population: 
from 
about 
four 
million 
to 
720 
million 
(now, 
seven 
billion). 
But 
during 
the 
entire 
era, 
the 
rate 
of 
technological 
progress 
was 
never 
sufficient 
to 
allow 
for 
population 
growth 
combined 
with 
increasing 
per 
capita 
incomes. 


Today, 
we 
take 
it 
for 
granted 
that 
it 
is 
solely 
the 
unwillingness 
to 
consume 
less 
and 
to 
save 
more 
that 
imposes 
limits 
on 
economic 
growth. 
We 
have 
a 
seemingly 
endless 
supply 
of 
natural 
resources 
and 
recipes 
how 
to 
produce 
more, 
better, 
and 
different 
goods, 
and 
it 
is 
only 
our 
limited 
savings 
that 
prevent 
us 
from 
employing 
these 
resources 
and 
implement 
such 
recipes. 
Yet 
this 
phenomenon 
is 
actually 
quite 
new. 
For 
most 
of 
human 
history 
savings 
were 
held 
back 
by 
a 
lack 
of 
ideas 
of 
how 
to 
productively 
invest 
them, 
i.e., 
of 
how 
to 
convert 
plain 
savings 
(storing) 
into 
productive 
savings 
(producer 
goods 
production). 
For 
Crusoe, 
for 
instance, 
it 
was 
not 
sufficient 
to 
have 
a 
low 
time 
preference 
and 
to 
save. 
Rather, 
Crusoe 
also 
had 
to 
conceive 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
net 
and 
must 
have 
known 
how 
to 
build 
it 
from 
scratch. 
Most 
people 
are 
not 
intelligent 
enough 
to 
invent 
and 
implement 
anything 
new 
but 
can 
at 
best 
only 
imitate, 
more 
or 
less 
perfectly, 
what 
other, 
brighter 
people 
have 
invented 
before 
them. 
Yet 
if 
no 
one 
is 
capable 
to 
do 
this 
or 
to 
imitate 
what 
others 
have 
invented 
before, 
then 
even 
the 
safest 
of 
property 
rights 
will 
make 
no 
difference. 
Every 
incentive 
needs 
a 
receptor 
to 
work, 
and 
if 
a 
receptor 
is 
lacking 
or 
insufficiently 
sensitive, 
different 
incentive 
structures 
do 
not 
matter. 
Hence, 
the 
institution 
of 
property-protection 
must 
be 
regarded 
as 
only 
a 
necessary 
(but 
not 
sufficient) 
condition 
of 
economic 
growth 
(rising 
per 
capita 
incomes). 
Likewise, 
it 
requires 
intelligence 
to 
recognize 
the 
higher 
physical 
productivity 
of 
the 
division 
of 
labor, 
and 
it 
requires 
intelligence 
to 
recognize 
the 
laws 
of 
human 
reproduction 
and 
thus 
allow 
for 
any 
form 
of 
deliberate 
population 
control, 
let 
alone 
an 
efficient—low-cost—control. 


The 
mechanism 
through 
which 
higher 
human 
intelligence 
(combined 



with 
low 
time 
preference) 
was 
bred 
over 
time 
is 
straightforward. 
Given 
that 
man 
is 
physically 
weak 
and 
ill-equipped 
to 
deal 
with 
brute 
nature, 
it 
was 
advantageous 
for 
him 
to 
develop 
his 
intelligence.[10] 
Higher 
intelligence 
translated 
into 
economic 
success, 
and 
economic 
success 
in 
turn 
translated 
into 
reproductive 
success 
(producing 
a 
larger 
number 
of 
surviving 
descendants). 
For 
the 
existence 
of 
both 
relationships 
massive 
amounts 
of 
empirical 
evidence 
are 
available.[11] 


There 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
that 
a 
hunter-gatherer 
existence 
requires 
intelligence: 
the 
ability 
to 
classify 
various 
external 
objects 
as 
good 
or 
bad, 
the 
ability 
to 
recognize 
a 
multiplicity 
of 
causes 
and 
effects, 
to 
estimate 
distances, 
time, 
and 
speed, 
to 
survey 
and 
recognize 
landscapes, 
to 
locate 
various 
(good 
or 
bad) 
things 
and 
to 
remember 
their 
position 
in 
relation 
to 
each 
other, 
etc.; 
most 
importantly, 
the 
ability 
to 
communicate 
with 
others 
by 
means 
of 
language 
and 
thus 
facilitate 
coordination. 
Not 
every 
member 
of 
a 
band 
was 
equally 
capable 
of 
such 
skills. 
Some 
were 
more 
intelligent 
than 
others. 
These 
differences 
in 
intellectual 
talents 
would 
lead 
to 
some 
visible 
status 
differentiation 
within 
the 
tribe—of 
“excellent” 
hunters, 
gatherers, 
and 
communicators 
and 
“lousy” 
ones—and 
this 
status 
differentiation 
would 
in 
turn 
result 
in 
differences 
in 
the 
reproductive 
success 
of 
various 
tribe 
members, 
especially 
given 
the 
“loose” 
sexual 
mores 
prevailing 
among 
hunter-gatherers. 
That 
is, 
by 
and 
large 
“excellent” 
tribe 
members 
would 
produce 
a 
larger 
number 
of 
surviving 
offspring 
and 
thus 
transmit 
their 
genes 
more 
successfully 
into 
the 
next 
generation 
than 
“lousy” 
ones. 
Consequently, 
if 
and 
insofar 
as 
human 
intelligence 
has 
some 
genetic 
basis 
(which 
seems 
undeniable 
in 
light 
of 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
entire 
species), 
hunter-gatherer 
conditions 
would 
over 
time 
produce 
(select 
for) 
a 
population 
of 
increasing 
average 
intelligence 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
an 
increasingly 
higher 
level 
of 
“exceptional” 
intelligence. 


The 
competition 
within 
and 
between 
tribes, 
and 
the 
selection 
for 
and 
breeding 
of 
higher 
intelligence 
via 
differential 
rates 
of 
reproductive 
success, 
did 
not 
come 
to 
a 
halt 
once 
the 
hunter-gatherer 
life 
had 
been 
given 
up 
in 
favor 
of 
agriculture 
and 
animal 
husbandry. 
However, 
the 
intellectual 
requirements 
of 
economic 
success 
became 
somewhat 
different 
under 
sedentary 
conditions. 


The 
invention 
of 
agriculture 
and 
animal 
husbandry 
was 
in 
and 
of 
itself 
an 
outstanding 
cognitive 
achievement. 
It 
required 
a 
lengthened 
planning 



horizon. 
It 
required 
longer 
provisions 
and 
deeper 
and 
farther-reaching 
insights 
into 
the 
chains 
of 
natural 
causes 
and 
effects. 
And 
it 
required 
more 
work, 
patience, 
and 
endurance 
than 
under 
hunter-gatherer 
conditions. 
In 
addition, 
it 
was 
instrumental 
for 
success 
as 
a 
farmer 
that 
one 
possessed 
some 
degree 
of 
numeracy 
so 
as 
to 
count, 
measure, 
and 
proportion. 
It 
required 
intelligence 
to 
recognize 
the 
advantages 
of 
interhousehold 
division 
of 
labor 
and 
to 
abandon 
self-sufficiency. 
It 
required 
some 
literacy 
to 
design 
contracts 
and 
establish 
contractual 
relations. 
And 
it 
required 
some 
skill 
of 
monetary 
calculation 
and 
of 
accountancy 
to 
economically 
succeed. 
Not 
every 
farmer 
was 
equally 
apt 
in 
these 
skills 
and 
had 
an 
equally 
low 
degree 
of 
time 
preference. 
To 
the 
contrary, 
under 
agricultural 
conditions, 
where 
each 
household 
was 
responsible 
for 
its 
own 
production 
of 
consumer 
goods 
and 
offspring 
and 
there 
was 
no 
longer 
any 
“free 
riding” 
as 
under 
hunter-gatherer 
conditions, 
the 
natural 
inequality 
of 
man, 
and 
the 
corresponding 
social 
differentiation 
of 
and 
between 
more 
or 
less 
successful 
members 
of 
a 
tribe 
became 
increasingly 
and 
strikingly 
visible 
(in 
particular 
through 
the 
size 
of 
one’s 
land 
holdings). 
Consequently, 
the 
translation 
of 
economic 
(productive) 
success 
and 
status 
into 
reproductive 
success, 
i.e., 
the 
breeding 
of 
a 
comparatively 
larger 
number 
of 
surviving 
offspring 
by 
the 
economically 
successful, 
became 
even 
more 
direct 
and 
pronounced. 


Further, 
this 
tendency 
of 
selecting 
for 
higher 
intelligence 
would 
be 
particularly 
pronounced 
under 
“harsh” 
external 
conditions. 
If 
the 
human 
environment 
is 
unchangingly 
constant 
and 
“mild”—as 
in 
the 
season-less 
tropics, 
where 
one 
day 
is 
like 
another 
year 
in 
and 
out—high 
or 
exceptional 
intelligence 
offers 
a 
lesser 
advantage 
than 
in 
an 
inhospitable 
environment 
with 
widely 
fluctuating 
seasonal 
variations. 
The 
more 
challenging 
the 
environment, 
the 
higher 
the 
premium 
placed 
on 
intelligence 
as 
a 
requirement 
of 
economic, 
and 
consequently 
reproductive 
success. 
Hence, 
the 
growth 
of 
human 
intelligence 
would 
be 
most 
pronounced 
in 
harsher 
(historically, 
generally 
northern) 
regions 
of 
human 
habitation. 


Humans 
live 
on—consume—animals 
and 
plants, 
and 
animals 
live 
on 
other 
animals 
or 
plants. 
Plants, 
thus, 
stand 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
human 
food 
chain. 
The 
growth 
of 
plants 
in 
turn 
depends 
on 
the 
presence 
(or 
absence) 
of 
four 
factors: 
carbon 
dioxide 
(which 
is 
evenly 
distributed 
across 
the 
globe 
and 
hence 
of 
no 
interest 
here), 
solar 
energy, 
water, 
and, 
very 
importantly, 
minerals 
(such 
as 
potassium, 
phosphates, 
etc.).[12] 



At 
the 
equator, 
where 
(nearby) 
the 
first 
modern 
humans 
lived, 
two 
of 
the 
three 
conditions 
of 
biological 
growth 
were 
met 
perfectly. 
There 
existed 
an 
abundance 
of 
sunlight 
and 
of 
rain. 
Rain 
fell 
predictably 
almost 
daily. 
Days 
and 
nights 
were 
equally 
long 
and 
temperatures 
year-round 
comfortably 
warm, 
with 
little 
to 
no 
difference 
between 
day 
vs. 
night 
and 
summer 
vs. 
winter 
temperatures. 
In 
the 
tropical 
rainforest, 
temperatures 
rarely 
exceed 
30 
degrees 
Celsius 
(86 
degrees 
Fahrenheit) 
and 
rarely 
fall 
below 
20 
degrees 
Celsius 
(68 
degrees 
Fahrenheit). 
Winds 
were 
generally 
calm, 
interrupted 
only 
by 
sudden 
brief 
storms. 
The 
conditions 
for 
human 
habitation, 
then, 
would 
appear 
quite 
appealing; 
and 
yet, 
the 
population 
density 
in 
tropical 
regions 
is 
and 
has 
always 
been 
extremely 
low 
as 
compared 
to 
that 
in 
regions 
further 
north 
(and 
south), 
sometimes, 
as 
in 
the 
rainforests 
of 
the 
Amazon, 
nearly 
as 
low 
as 
the 
population 
density 
typical 
of 
deserts 
or 
arctic 
regions. 
The 
reason 
for 
this 
is 
the 
extreme 
shortage 
of 
soil 
minerals 
in 
the 
tropics. 


The 
soil 
of 
the 
tropics 
is, 
geologically 
speaking, 
old 
(as 
compared 
in 
particular 
to 
those 
regions 
affected 
by 
the 
earth-historical 
sequence 
of 
glacial 
and 
interglacial 
periods) 
and 
almost 
completely 
drained 
of 
minerals 
(except 
for 
equatorial 
regions 
with 
volcanic—mineral 
producing—activity 
as 
on 
some 
Indonesian 
islands 
such 
as 
Java, 
for 
instance, 
where 
the 
human 
population 
density 
has 
in 
fact 
always 
been 
significantly 
higher). 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
enormous 
biomass 
characteristic 
of 
the 
tropics 
produces 
no 
new, 
surplus 
or 
excess 
growth. 
Growth 
is 
year-round, 
but 
it 
is 
slow, 
and 
it 
does 
not 
lead 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
total 
biomass. 
Once 
grown 
up, 
the 
rainforest 
only 
recycles 
itself. 
Moreover, 
the 
overwhelming 
proportion 
of 
this 
biomass 
is 
in 
the 
form 
of 
slow 
growing 
hardwood 
trees, 
i.e., 
of 
dead 
matter; 
and 
the 
leaves 
of 
most 
tropical 
plants, 
due 
to 
their 
peculiar 
need 
for 
protection 
(cooling) 
against 
the 
intense 
equator 
sun, 
are 
not 
only 
hard 
and 
tough 
but 
often 
poisonous 
or 
at 
least 
distasteful 
to 
humans 
and 
other 
plant-eaters 
such 
as 
cattle 
and 
deer. 
This 
absence 
of 
surplus 
growth 
and 
the 
special 
chemistry 
of 
tropical 
plants 
explains 
the 
fact 
that, 
contrary 
to 
what 
is 
frequently 
imagined, 
the 
tropics 
support 
only 
amazingly 
few 
and 
smallish 
animals. 
Indeed, 
the 
only 
animals 
existing 
in 
abundance 
are 
ants 
and 
termites. 
A 
tropical 
biomass 
(mostly 
of 
wood) 
of 
more 
than 
1,000 
tons 
per 
hectare 
produces 
no 
more 
than 
200 
kilograms 
of 
meat 
(animal 
mass), 
i.e., 
one-five-thousandth 
of 
the 
plant 
mass. 
(In 
contrast, 
in 
the 
East 
African 
grassland 
savannah 
a 
mere 
fifty 
tons 
of 
plant 
mass 
per 
square 
kilometer 
(100 
hectare) 
produces 
some 
twenty 
tons 
of 
animal 



mass: 
of 
elephants, 
buffalos, 
zebras, 
gnus, 
antelopes, 
and 
gazelles.) 
Yet 
where 
there 
are 
so 
few 
and 
nonsizeable 
animals, 
only 
few 
humans 
can 
be 
sustained. 
(In 
fact, 
most 
people 
who 
lived 
in 
the 
tropics 
lived 
near 
rivers 
and 
sustained 
their 
lives 
essentially 
from 
fishing 
rather 
than 
hunting 
and 
gathering). 


At 
their 
place 
of 
origin, 
then, 
humans 
very 
quickly 
arrived 
at 
the 
point 
where 
they 
had 
to 
leave 
the 
paradisiacal, 
warm, 
stable, 
and 
predictable 
environment 
of 
the 
tropics 
and 
enter 
other 
regions 
in 
search 
of 
food. 
The 
regions 
northward 
(and 
southward) 
of 
the 
equator 
were 
seasonal 
regions, 
however. 
That 
is, 
they 
had 
less, 
and 
less 
constant 
rainfall 
than 
the 
tropics, 
and 
the 
temperatures 
increasingly 
fell 
and 
varied 
more 
widely 
as 
one 
moved 
northward 
(or 
southward). 
In 
northern 
regions 
of 
human 
habitation, 
temperatures 
could 
easily 
vary 
by 
more 
than 
40 
degrees 
per 
day 
and 
seasonal 
temperatures 
by 
more 
than 
80 
degrees. 
The 
total 
biomass 
produced 
under 
such 
conditions 
was 
significantly 
less 
than 
in 
the 
tropics. 
However, 
further 
away 
from 
the 
equator 
the 
soil 
had 
(often) 
sufficient 
or 
even 
ample 
minerals 
to 
compensate 
for 
these 
climatic 
disadvantages 
and 
offered 
optimal 
conditions 
for 
the 
growth 
of 
vegetation 
suited 
for 
animal 
and 
human 
consumption: 
of 
plants 
that 
grew 
fast 
and, 
in 
spurts, 
produced 
large 
seasonal 
surpluses 
of 
fresh 
biomass—in 
particular 
of 
grasses 
(including 
grains)—that 
could 
support 
a 
large 
number 
of 
sizable 
animals. 


During 
the 
last 
ice 
age, 
which 
ended 
some 
10,000 
years 
ago, 
the 
regions 
which 
offered 
this 
less 
than 
paradisiacal 
climatic 
conditions 
but 
a 
superior 
food 
supply 
included 
(concentrating 
here 
on 
the 
northern 
hemisphere, 
where 
most 
of 
the 
considered 
development 
took 
place) 
all 
of 
supra-equatorial 
Africa 
—including 
the 
Sahara—and 
most 
of 
the 
Eurasian 
land 
mass 
(except 
for 
still-
arctic 
northern 
Europe 
and 
Siberia). 
Since 
then, 
and 
essentially 
continuing 
until 
today, 
a 
northern 
belt 
of 
deserts, 
which 
widens 
toward 
the 
east, 
has 
come 
to 
separate 
the 
entire 
zone 
of 
seasonal 
regions 
into 
a 
southern 
one 
of 
subequatorial 
regions 
and 
a 
northern 
one 
that 
includes 
now 
also 
most 
of 
northern 
Europe 
and 
Siberia. 
From 
the 
hunter-gatherer 
stage 
of 
human 
development 
essentially 
until 
today, 
then, 
the 
highest 
population 
density 
could 
be 
found 
in 
these 
“moderate” 
seasonal 
regions 
(a 
picture 
further 
modified 
only 
by 
altitudes). 


It 
is 
important 
to 
realize 
in 
this 
context, 
however, 
that 
what 
we 
have 
come 
to 
regard 
as 
“moderate” 
regions 
of 
human 
habitation 
were 
actually 



quite 
harsh 
living 
conditions, 
and 
in 
far 
northern 
latitudes 
even 
extremely 
harsh 
conditions 
as 
compared 
to 
those 
in 
the 
constantly 
warm 
tropics, 
to 
which 
humans 
first 
had 
been 
adapted. 
In 
contrast 
to 
the 
stable 
and 
unchanging 
environment 
of 
the 
tropics, 
moderate 
regions 
presented 
increased 
change 
and 
fluctuation 
and 
thus 
posed 
(increasingly) 
difficult 
intellectual 
challenges 
to 
hunters 
and 
gatherers. 
Not 
only 
did 
they 
have 
to 
learn 
how 
to 
deal 
with 
large 
animals, 
which 
did 
not 
exist 
in 
the 
tropics 
(except 
for 
the 
volcanic 
parts 
of 
Indonesia), 
and 
their 
movements. 
More 
importantly, 
outside 
equatorial 
regions 
seasonal 
changes 
and 
fluctuations 
in 
the 
human 
environment 
played 
an 
increasingly 
greater 
role, 
and 
it 
became 
increasingly 
important 
to 
predict 
such 
changes 
and 
fluctuations 
and 
to 
anticipate 
their 
effects 
on 
the 
future 
food 
supply 
(of 
plants 
and 
animals). 
Those 
who 
could 
do 
so 
successfully 
and 
make 
appropriate 
preparations 
and 
adjustments, 
had 
a 
better 
chance 
of 
survival 
and 
proliferation 
than 
those 
who 
could 
not. 


Outside 
the 
equatorial 
rainforest, 
to 
the 
north 
(and 
south), 
pronounced 
raining 
seasons 
existed 
and 
had 
to 
be 
taken 
into 
account. 
It 
rained 
during 
the 
summer 
and 
was 
dry 
in 
the 
winter. 
As 
well, 
the 
growth 
and 
distribution 
of 
plants 
and 
animals 
was 
affected 
by 
northeasterly 
(or, 
in 
the 
southern 
hemisphere, 
southeasterly) 
trade 
winds. 
In 
regions 
still 
further 
to 
the 
north 
(or 
south), 
increasingly 
separated 
since 
the 
end 
of 
the 
last 
ice 
age 
from 
the 
subequatorial 
regions 
by 
a 
belt 
of 
(northern 
and 
southern) 
deserts, 
the 
rain 
seasons 
shifted, 
with 
rain 
in 
the 
winter 
and 
drought 
in 
the 
summer. 
The 
winds 
affecting 
the 
distribution 
of 
rain 
were 
prevailingly 
westerlies. 
Summers 
were 
hot 
and 
dry, 
while 
winter 
temperatures, 
even 
in 
low 
altitudes, 
could 
easily 
reach 
“deadly” 
freezing 
levels, 
even 
if 
only 
for 
short 
periods. 
Growing 
seasons 
were 
accordingly 
limited. 
Lastly, 
in 
the 
northernmost 
regions 
of 
human 
habitation, 
i.e., 
north 
of 
Mediterranean 
latitudes, 
rain 
fell 
irregularly 
throughout 
the 
year 
and, 
with 
prevailing 
westerly 
winds, 
more 
in 
the 
west 
(northern 
Europe) 
than 
in 
the 
east 
(northern 
Asia). 
Otherwise, 
however, 
seasonal 
changes 
and 
fluctuations 
in 
this 
zone 
of 
human 
habitation 
were 
extreme. 
The 
lengths 
of 
days 
(light) 
and 
nights 
(dark) 
varied 
remarkably 
throughout 
the 
year. 
In 
extreme 
northern 
regions, 
a 
light 
summer 
day 
and 
a 
dark 
winter 
night 
both 
could 
last 
for 
more 
than 
a 
month. 
More 
importantly, 
the 
entire 
region 
(and 
especially 
pronounced 
as 
one 
moved 
in 
a 
northeasterly 
direction) 
experienced 
extended 
periods 
of 
often 
extreme 
freezing 
conditions 
during 
the 
winter. 
During 
these 
periods, 
lasting 
from 
many 
months 
to 
most 
of 



the 
year, 
all 
plant 
growth 
came 
essentially 
to 
a 
standstill. 
Plants 
died 
or 
went 
dormant. 
Nature 
stopped 
supplying 
food, 
and 
humans 
(and 
animals) 
were 
threatened 
with 
starvation 
and 
the 
danger 
of 
freezing 
to 
death. 
The 
growing 
seasons, 
during 
which 
a 
surplus 
of 
food 
and 
shelter 
could 
possibly 
be 
built 
up 
for 
this 
contingency, 
were 
accordingly 
short. 
Moreover, 
the 
extreme 
differences 
between 
long, 
harsh, 
and 
freezing 
winters 
and 
the 
short, 
mild 
to 
warm 
growing 
seasons, 
affected 
the 
migration 
of 
animals. 
Unless 
they 
had 
fully 
adapted 
to 
arctic 
conditions 
and 
could 
go 
into 
some 
form 
of 
hibernation 
during 
“dead” 
seasons, 
animals 
had 
to 
migrate 
from 
season 
to 
season, 
often 
over 
long 
distances 
to 
and 
from 
far 
apart 
locations. 
And 
since 
animals 
constituted 
a 
major 
part 
of 
the 
human 
food 
supply, 
hunter-gatherers, 
too, 
had 
to 
migrate 
regularly 
over 
large 
distances. 


Before 
the 
background 
of 
this 
rough 
picture 
of 
human 
ecology 
and 
geography, 
further 
modified 
and 
complicated 
of 
course 
by 
the 
existence 
of 
mountain 
ranges, 
rivers, 
and 
bodies 
of 
water, 
it 
becomes 
apparent 
why 
the 
natural 
selection 
in 
favor 
of 
higher 
intelligence 
among 
hunter-gatherers 
would 
be 
more 
pronounced 
as 
one 
moved 
in 
a 
northern 
(or 
southern) 
direction 
toward 
the 
coldest 
regions 
of 
human 
habitation. 
No 
doubt, 
significant 
intelligence 
was 
required 
of 
humans 
to 
live 
successfully 
in 
the 
tropics. 
However, 
the 
equilibrium-like 
constancy 
of 
the 
tropics 
acted 
as 
a 
natural 
constraint 
on 
the 
further 
development 
of 
human 
intelligence. 
Because 
one 
day 
was 
much 
like 
any 
other 
day 
in 
the 
tropics, 
little 
or 
no 
need 
existed 
for 
anyone 
to 
take 
anything 
into 
account 
in 
his 
actions 
except 
his 
immediate 
surroundings 
or 
to 
plan 
beyond 
anything 
but 
the 
immediately 
impending 
future. 
In 
distinct 
contrast, 
the 
increasing 
seasonality 
of 
regions 
outside 
the 
tropics 
made 
for 
an 
intellectually 
increasingly 
challenging 
environment. 


The 
existence 
of 
seasonal 
changes 
and 
fluctuations—of 
rain 
and 
drought, 
summer 
and 
winter, 
scorching 
heat 
and 
freezing 
cold, 
winds 
and 
calms—required 
that 
more, 
and 
more 
remote 
factors 
including 
the 
sun, 
the 
moon, 
and 
the 
stars, 
and 
longer 
stretches 
of 
time 
had 
to 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
if 
one 
wanted 
to 
act 
successfully 
and 
survive 
and 
procreate. 
More 
and 
longer 
chains 
of 
causes 
and 
effects 
had 
to 
be 
recognized 
and 
more 
and 
longer 
chains 
of 
argument 
thought 
through. 
The 
planning 
horizon 
had 
to 
be 
extended 
in 
time. 
One 
had 
to 
act 
now, 
in 
order 
to 
be 
successful 
much 
later. 
Both 
the 
period 
of 
production—the 
time 
lapse 
between 
the 
onset 
of 
a 
productive 
effort 
and 
its 
completion—and 
the 
period 
of 
provision—the 
time 
span 
into 
the 



future 
for 
which 
present 
provisions 
(savings) 
had 
to 
be 
made—needed 
to 
be 
lengthened. 
In 
the 
northernmost 
regions, 
with 
long 
and 
deadly 
winters, 
provisions 
of 
food, 
clothing, 
shelter, 
and 
heating 
had 
to 
be 
made 
that 
would 
last 
through 
most 
of 
a 
year 
or 
beyond. 
Planning 
had 
to 
be 
in 
terms 
of 
years, 
instead 
of 
days 
or 
months. 
As 
well, 
in 
pursuit 
of 
seasonally 
and 
widely 
migrating 
animals, 
extensive 
territories 
had 
to 
be 
traversed, 
requiring 
exceptional 
skills 
of 
orientation 
and 
navigation. 
Only 
groups 
intelligent 
enough 
on 
average 
to 
generate 
exceptional 
leaders 
who 
possessed 
such 
superior 
intellectual 
skills 
and 
abilities 
were 
rewarded 
with 
success—survival 
and 
procreation. 
Those 
groups 
and 
leaders, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
who 
were 
not 
capable 
of 
these 
achievements, 
were 
punished 
with 
failure, 
i.e., 
extinction. 


The 
greatest 
progress 
on 
the 
way 
toward 
the 
invention 
of 
agriculture 
and 
animal 
husbandry 
some 
11,000 
years 
ago, 
then, 
should 
have 
occurred 
in 
the 
northernmost 
regions 
of 
human 
habitation. 
Here, 
the 
competition 
within 
and 
between 
hunter-gatherer 
groups 
should 
have 
produced 
over 
time 
the 
most 
intelligent—provisionary 
and 
farsighted—population. 
And 
indeed, 
during 
the 
tens 
of 
thousands 
of 
years 
until 
about 
11,000 
years 
ago, 
every 
significant 
technological 
advance 
originated 
in 
northern 
regions: 
mostly 
in 
Europe 
or, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
ceramics, 
in 
Japan. 
In 
contrast, 
during 
the 
same 
period 
the 
toolkit 
used 
in 
the 
tropics 
remained 
almost 
unchanged. 


But 
the 
explanatory 
power 
of 
the 
above 
sketch 
of 
social 
evolution 
goes 
much 
further. 
The 
admittedly 
hypothetical 
theory 
presented 
here 
can 
explain 
why 
it 
took 
so 
long 
to 
get 
out 
of 
the 
Malthusian 
trap, 
and 
how 
such 
a 
feat 
was 
possible 
at 
all 
and 
we 
did 
not 
remain 
under 
Malthusian 
conditions 
forever: 
Mankind 
was 
simply 
not 
intelligent 
enough 
to 
achieve 
productivity 
increases 
that 
could 
continuously 
outstrip 
population 
growth. 
A 
certain 
threshold 
of 
average 
and 
exceptional 
intelligence 
had 
to 
be 
reached 
first 
for 
this 
to 
become 
possible, 
and 
it 
took 
time 
(until 
about 
1800) 
to 
“breed” 
such 
a 
level 
of 
intelligence. 
The 
theory 
can 
explain 
the 
well-established 
and 
corroborated 
(and 
yet 
for 
“political 
correctness” 
reasons 
persistently 
ignored) 
fact 
of 
intelligence 
research: 
that 
the 
average 
IQ 
of 
nations 
gradually 
declines 
as 
one 
moves 
from 
north 
to 
south 
(from 
about 
100 
or 
more 
points 
in 
northern 
countries 
to 
about 
seventy 
in 
sub-Saharan 
Africa).[13] 
More 
specifically, 
the 
theory 
can 
thus 
explain 
why 
the 
Industrial 
Revolution 
originated 
and 
then 
took 
hold 
immediately 
in 
some—generally 
northern—regions 
but 
not 
in 
others, 
why 
there 
had 
always 
existed 
persistent 
regional 
income 
differences, 



and 
why 
these 
differences 
could 
have 
increased 
(rather 
than 
decreased) 
since 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Industrial 
Revolution. 


As 
well, 
the 
theory 
can 
explain 
what 
may 
at 
first 
appear 
as 
an 
anomaly: 
that 
it 
was 
not 
in 
the 
northernmost 
regions 
of 
human 
habitation 
where 
the 
Neolithic 
Revolution 
began 
some 
11,000 
years 
ago 
and 
whence 
it 
gradually 
and 
successively 
conquered 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
world, 
but 
in 
regions 
significantly 
further 
south—yet 
still 
far 
north 
of 
the 
tropics: 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
in 
central 
China 
(the 
Yangtze 
Valley), 
and 
in 
Mesoamerica. 
The 
reason 
for 
this 
seeming 
anomaly 
is 
easy 
to 
detect, 
however. 
In 
order 
to 
invent 
agriculture 
and 
animal 
husbandry 
two 
factors 
were 
necessary: 
sufficient 
intelligence 
and 
favorable 
natural 
circumstances 
to 
apply 
such 
intelligence. 
It 
was 
the 
second 
factor 
that 
was 
lacking 
in 
extreme 
northern 
regions 
and 
thus 
prevented 
its 
inhabitants 
from 
making 
the 
revolutionary 
invention. 
The 
extreme 
freezing 
conditions 
and 
the 
extreme 
brevity 
of 
the 
growing 
season 
there 
made 
agriculture 
and 
animal 
husbandry 
practically 
impossible, 
even 
if 
the 
idea 
might 
have 
been 
conceived. 
What 
was 
necessary 
to 
actually 
implement 
the 
idea 
were 
natural 
circumstances 
favorable 
to 
sedentary 
life: 
of 
a 
long 
and 
warm 
growing 
season 
(besides 
suitable 
crops, 
and 
domesticable 
animals).[14] 
Such 
climatic 
conditions 
existed 
in 
the 
mentioned 
“temperate” 
regions. 
Here, 
the 
competitive 
development 
of 
human 
intelligence 
among 
hunter-gatherers 
had 
made 
sufficient 
progress 
(even 
if 
it 
lagged 
behind 
that 
in 
the 
north) 
so 
that, 
combined 
with 
favorable 
natural 
circumstances, 
the 
idea 
of 
agriculture 
and 
animal 
husbandry 
could 
be 
implemented. 
Since 
the 
end 
of 
the 
last 
ice 
age 
about 
10,000 
years 
ago, 
then, 
the 
zone 
of 
temperate 
climates 
expanded 
northward 
into 
higher 
latitudes, 
rendering 
agriculture 
and 
animal 
husbandry 
increasingly 
feasible 
there 
as 
well. 
Meeting 
there 
an 
even 
more 
intelligent 
people, 
the 
new 
revolutionary 
production 
techniques 
were 
not 
merely 
quickly 
imitated 
and 
adopted, 
but 
most 
subsequent 
improvements 
in 
these 
techniques 
had 
its 
origins 
here. 
South 
of 
the 
centers 
of 
the 
original 
invention, 
too, 
the 
new 
technique 
would 
be 
gradually 
adopted 
(with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
tropics) 
—after 
all, 
it 
is 
easier 
to 
imitate 
something 
than 
to 
invent 
it. 
Meeting 
a 
less 
intelligent 
people 
there, 
however, 
little 
or 
no 
contribution 
to 
the 
further 
development 
of 
more 
efficient 
practices 
of 
agriculture 
or 
animal 
husbandry 
would 
come 
from 
there. 
All 
further 
efficiency 
gains 
in 
these 
regions 
would 
stem 
from 
the 
imitation 
of 
techniques 
invented 
elsewhere, 
in 
regions 
further 
north. 



IV. 
IMPLICATIONS 
AND 
OUTLOOK 
Several 
implications 
and 
suggestions 
follow 
from 
this. 
First, 
the 
theory 
of 
social 
evolution 
sketched 
here 
entails 
a 
fundamental 
criticism 
of 
the 
egalitarianism 
rampant 
within 
the 
social 
sciences 
generally 
but 
also 
among 
many 
libertarians. 
True, 
economists 
allow 
for 
human 
“differences” 
in 
the 
form 
of 
different 
labor 
productivities. 
But 
these 
differences 
are 
generally 
interpreted 
as 
the 
result 
of 
different 
external 
conditions, 
i.e., 
of 
different 
endowments 
or 
training. 
Only 
rarely 
are 
internal, 
biologically 
anchored 
characteristics 
admitted 
as 
possible 
sources 
of 
human 
differences. 
Yet 
even 
when 
economists 
admit 
the 
obvious: 
that 
human 
differences 
have 
internal, 
biological 
sources 
as 
well, 
as 
Mises 
and 
Rothbard 
certainly 
do, 
they 
still 
typically 
ignore 
that 
these 
differences 
are 
themselves 
in 
turn 
the 
outcome 
of 
a 
lengthy 
process 
of 
natural 
selection 
in 
favor 
of 
human 
characteristics 
and 
dispositions 
(physical 
and 
mental) 
determinant 
of 
economic 
success 
and, 
more 
or 
less 
highly 
positively 
correlated 
with 
economic 
success, 
of 
reproductive 
success. 
That 
is, 
it 
is 
still 
largely 
overlooked 
that 
we, 
modern 
man, 
are 
a 
very 
different 
breed 
from 
our 
predecessors 
hundreds 
or 
even 
thousands 
of 
years 
ago. 


Second, 
once 
it 
is 
realized 
that 
the 
Industrial 
Revolution 
was 
first 
and 
foremost 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
evolutionary 
growth 
of 
human 
intelligence 
(rather 
than 
the 
mere 
removal 
of 
institutional 
barriers 
to 
growth), 
the 
role 
of 
the 
State 
can 
be 
recognized 
as 
fundamentally 
different 
under 
Malthusian 
vs. 
post-Malthusian 
conditions. 
Under 
Malthusian 
conditions 
the 
State 
doesn’t 
matter 
much, 
at 
least 
as 
far 
as 
macro-effects 
are 
concerned. 
A 
more 
exploitative 
State 
will 
simply 
lead 
to 
a 
lower 
population 
number 
(much 
like 
a 
pest 
would), 
but 
it 
does 
not 
affect 
per 
capita 
income. 
In 
fact, 
in 
lowering 
the 
population 
density, 
income 
per 
capita 
may 
even 
rise, 
as 
it 
did 
after 
the 
great 
pestilence 
in 
the 
mid-fourteenth 
century. 
And 
in 
reverse: 
a 
“good,” 
less-
exploitative 
State 
will 
allow 
for 
a 
growing 
number 
of 
people, 
but 
per 
capita 
incomes 
will 
not 
rise 
or 
may 
even 
fall, 
because 
land 
per 
capita 
is 
reduced. 
All 
this 
changes 
with 
the 
Industrial 
Revolution. 
For 
if 
productivity 
gains 
continuously 
outstrip 
population 
increases 
and 
allow 
for 
a 
steady 
increase 
in 
per 
capita 
incomes, 
then 
an 
exploitative 
institution 
such 
as 
the 
State 
can 
continuously 
grow 
without 
lowering 
per 
capita 
income 
and 
reducing 
the 



population 
number. 
The 
State 
then 
becomes 
a 
permanent 
drag 
on 
the 
economy 
and 
per 
capita 
incomes. 


Third, 
whereas 
under 
Malthusian 
conditions 
positive 
eugenic 
effects 
reign: 
the 
economically 
successful 
produce 
more 
surviving 
offspring 
and 
the 
population 
stock 
is 
thus 
gradually 
bettered 
(cognitively 
improved). 
Under 
post-Malthusian 
conditions 
the 
existence 
and 
the 
growth 
of 
the 
State 
produces 
a 
two-fold 
dysgenic 
effect, 
especially 
under 
democratic 
welfare-
state 
conditions.[15] 
For 
one, 
the 
“economically 
challenged,” 
as 
the 
principal 
“clients” 
of 
the 
welfare 
State, 
produce 
more 
surviving 
offspring, 
and 
the 
economically 
successful 
less. 
Second, 
the 
steady 
growth 
of 
a 
parasitic 
State, 
made 
possible 
by 
a 
growing 
underlying 
economy, 
systematically 
affects 
the 
requirements 
of 
economic 
success. 
Economic 
success 
becomes 
increasingly 
dependent 
on 
politics 
and 
political 
talent, 
i.e., 
the 
talent 
of 
using 
the 
State 
to 
enrich 
oneself 
at 
others’ 
expense. 
In 
any 
case, 
the 
population 
stock 
becomes 
increasingly 
worse 
(as 
far 
as 
the 
cognitive 
requirements 
of 
prosperity 
and 
economic 
growth 
are 
concerned), 
rather 
than 
better. 


Finally, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
note 
in 
conclusion, 
then, 
that 
just 
as 
the 
Industrial 
Revolution 
and 
the 
attendant 
escape 
from 
the 
Malthusian 
trap 
was 
by 
no 
means 
a 
necessary 
development 
in 
human 
history 
so 
its 
success 
and 
achievements 
are 
also 
not 
irreversible.

When 
Tahiti 
was 
rediscovered 
by 
Europeans 
in 
1767, 
some 
1,000 
or 
possibly 
2,000 
years 
after 
it 
had 
been 
first 
settled 
by 
Austronesian 
farmers, 
its 
population 
was 
estimated 
at 
50,000 
(today, 
180,000). 
According 
to 
all 
accounts, 
the 
Tahitians 
lived 
paradisiacal 
lives. 
Real 
income 
per 
capita 
was 
high, 
not 
least 
because 
of 
highly 
favorable 
climatic 
conditions 
in 
the 
Polynesian 
islands. 
Tahitian 
men 
could 
not 
keep 
their 
pants 
up 
either, 
but 
in 
order 
to 
maintain 
their 
high 
standard 
of 
living, 
the 
Tahitians 
practiced 
a 
most 
rigorous 
and 
ruthless 
form 
of 
population 
control, 
involving 
infanticide 
and 
deadly 
warfare. 
The 
place 
was 
paradise, 
but 
a 
paradise 
only 
for 
the 
living. 
Yet 
all 
the 
while 
Tahitians 
were 
still 
living 
in 
the 
Stone 
Age. 
Their 
tool 
kit 
had 
remained 
essentially 
unchanged 
since 
their 
first 
arrival 
on 
the 
island(s). 
There 
had 
been 
no 
further 
capital 
accumulation, 
and 
real 
income 
per 
capita, 
even 
if 
high 
due 
to 
favorable 
external 
circumstances, 
had 
remained 
stagnant.

FROM 
ARISTOCRACY 
TO 
MONARCHY 
TO 
DEMOCRACY 


IN 
THE 
FOLLOWING 
I 
WANT 
TO 
BRIEFLY 
describe 
a 
historical 
puzzle 
or 
riddle 
that 
I 
will 
then 
try 
to 
solve 
and 
answer 
in 
some 
detail. 


But 
before 
that, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
make 
a 
few 
brief 
general 
theoretical 
observations. 


Men 
do 
not 
live 
in 
perfect 
harmony 
with 
each 
other. 
Rather, 
again 
and 
again 
conflicts 
arise 
between 
them. 
And 
the 
source 
of 
these 
conflicts 
is 
always 
the 
same: 
the 
scarcity 
of 
goods. 
I 
want 
to 
do 
X 
with 
a 
given 
good 
G 
and 
you 
want 
to 
do 
simultaneously 
Y 
with 
the 
very 
same 
good. 
Because 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
you 
and 
me 
to 
do 
simultaneously 
X 
and 
Y 
with 
G, 
you 
and 
I 
must 
clash. 
If 
a 
superabundance 
of 
goods 
existed, 
i.e., 
if, 
for 
instance, 
G 
were 
available 
in 
unlimited 
supply, 
our 
conflict 
could 
be 
avoided. 
We 
could 
both 
simultaneously 
do 
‘our 
thing’ 
with 
G. 
But 
most 
goods 
do 
not 
exist 
in 
superabundance. 
Ever 
since 
mankind 
left 
the 
Garden 
of 
Eden, 
there 
has 
been 
and 
always 
will 
be 
scarcity 
all-around 
us. 


Absent 
a 
perfect 
harmony 
of 
all 
human 
interests 
and 
given 
the 
permanent 
human 
condition 
of 
scarcity, 
then, 
interpersonal 
conflicts 
are 
an 
inescapable 
part 
of 
human 
life 
and 
a 
constant 
threat 
to 
peace. 


Confronted 
with 
conflicts 
concerning 
scarce 
goods, 
but 
also 
endowed 
with 
reason 
or 
more 
precisely 
with 
the 
ability 
to 
communicate, 
to 
discuss 
and 
to 
argue 
with 
one 
another, 
as 
the 
very 
manifestation 
of 
human 
reason, 
then, 
mankind 
has 
been 
and 
forever 
will 
be 
faced 
with 
the 
question 
of 
how 
to 
possibly 
avoid 
such 
conflicts 
and 
how 
to 
peacefully 
resolve 
them 
should 
they 
occur.[1] 


Assume 
now 
a 
group 
of 
people 
aware 
of 
the 
reality 
of 
interpersonal 
conflicts 
and 
in 
search 
of 
a 
way 
out 
of 
this 
predicament. 
And 
assume 
that 
I 
then 
propose 
the 
following 
as 
a 
solution: 
In 
every 
case 
of 
conflict, 
including 
conflicts 
in 
which 
I 
myself 
am 
involved, 
I 
will 
have 
the 
last 
and 
final 
word. 
I 
will 
be 
the 
ultimate 
judge 
as 
to 
who 
owns 
what 
and 
when 
and 
who 
is 



accordingly 
right 
or 
wrong 
in 
any 
dispute 
regarding 
scarce 
resources. 
This 
way, 
all 
conflicts 
can 
be 
avoided 
or 
smoothly 
resolved. 


What 
would 
be 
my 
chances 
of 
finding 
your 
or 
anyone 
else’s 
agreement 
to 
this 
proposal? 


My 
guess 
is 
that 
my 
chances 
would 
be 
virtually 
zero, 
nil. 
In 
fact, 
you 
and 
most 
people 
will 
think 
of 
this 
proposal 
as 
ridiculous 
and 
likely 
consider 
me 
crazy, 
a 
case 
for 
psychiatric 
treatment. 
For 
you 
will 
immediately 
realize 
that 
under 
this 
proposal 
you 
must 
literally 
fear 
for 
your 
life 
and 
property. 
Because 
this 
solution 
would 
allow 
me 
to 
cause 
or 
provoke 
a 
conflict 
with 
you 
and 
then 
decide 
this 
conflict 
in 
my 
own 
favor. 
Indeed, 
under 
this 
proposal 
you 
would 
essentially 
give 
up 
your 
right 
to 
life 
and 
property 
or 
even 
any 
pretense 
to 
such 
a 
right. 
You 
have 
a 
right 
to 
life 
and 
property 
only 
insofar 
as 
I 
grant 
you 
such 
a 
right, 
i.e., 
as 
long 
as 
I 
decide 
to 
let 
you 
live 
and 
keep 
whatever 
you 
consider 
yours. 
Ultimately, 
only 
I 
have 
a 
right 
to 
life 
and 
I 
am 
the 
owner 
of 
all 
goods. 


And 
yet—and 
here 
is 
the 
puzzle—this 
obviously 
crazy 
solution 
is 
the 
reality. 
Wherever 
you 
look, 
it 
has 
been 
put 
into 
effect 
in 
the 
form 
of 
the 
institution 
of 
a 
State. 
The 
State 
is 
the 
ultimate 
judge 
in 
every 
case 
of 
conflict. 
There 
is 
no 
appeal 
beyond 
its 
verdicts. 
If 
you 
get 
into 
conflicts 
with 
the 
State, 
with 
its 
agents, 
it 
is 
the 
State 
and 
its 
agents 
who 
decide 
who 
is 
right 
and 
who 
is 
wrong. 
The 
State 
has 
the 
right 
to 
tax 
you. 
Thereby, 
it 
is 
the 
State 
that 
makes 
the 
decision 
how 
much 
of 
your 
property 
you 
are 
allowed 
to 
keep—that 
is, 
your 
property 
is 
only 
“fiat” 
property. 
And 
the 
State 
can 
make 
laws, 
legislate—that 
is, 
your 
entire 
life 
is 
at 
the 
mercy 
of 
the 
State. 
It 
can 
even 
order 
that 
you 
be 
killed—not 
in 
defense 
of 
your 
own 
life 
and 
property 
but 
in 
the 
defense 
of 
the 
State 
or 
whatever 
the 
State 
considers 
“defense” 
of 
its 
“state-property.” 


How, 
then, 
and 
this 
is 
the 
question 
I 
want 
to 
address 
at 
some 
length 
now, 
could 
such 
a 
wondrous, 
indeed 
crazy 
institution 
come 
into 
existence? 
Obviously, 
it 
could 
not 
have 
developed 
ab 
ovo, 
spontaneously, 
as 
the 
outcome 
of 
rational 
human 
deliberation. 
In 
fact, 
historically, 
it 
took 
centuries 
for 
this 
to 
happen. 
In 
the 
following 
I 
want 
to 
reconstruct 
this 
development 
in 
a 
step-by-step 
fashion: 
from 
the 
beginnings 
of 
a 
natural, 
aristocratic 
social 
order 
as 
it 
was 
approached, 
for 
instance, 
although 
still 
riddled 
with 
many 
imperfections, 
during 
the 
early 
European 
Middle 
Ages 
of 
feudal 
kings 
and 
lords, 
to 
and 
through 
its 
successive 
displacement 
by 
first 
absolute 
and 
then 



constitutional 
kings 
and 
classic 
monarchies, 
which 
took 
historic 
stage 
from 
about 
the 
seventeenth 
century 
on 
until 
the 
early 
twentieth 
century, 
and 
lastly 
to 
and 
through 
the 
successive 
displacement 
and 
final 
replacement 
of 
classic 
monarchies 
by 
democracies 
(parliamentary 
republics 
or 
monarchies), 
beginning 
with 
the 
French 
Revolution 
and 
coming 
into 
full 
swing 
with 
the 
end 
of 
World 
War 
I, 
since 
1918. 


While 
we 
have 
learned 
in 
school 
to 
regard 
this 
entire 
development 
as 
progress—no 
wonder, 
because 
history 
is 
always 
written 
by 
its 
victors—I 
will 
reconstruct 
it 
here 
as 
a 
tale 
of 
progressive 
folly 
and 
decay. 
And 
to 
immediately 
answer 
a 
question 
that 
will 
invariably 
arise 
in 
view 
of 
this, 
my 
revisionist 
account 
of 
history: 
Yes, 
the 
present 
world 
is 
richer 
than 
people 
were 
in 
the 
Middle 
Ages 
and 
the 
following 
monarchical 
age. 
But 
that 
does 
not 
show 
that 
it 
is 
richer 
because 
of 
this 
development. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
as 
I 
will 
demonstrate 
indirectly 
in 
the 
following, 
the 
increase 
in 
social 
wealth 
and 
general 
standards 
of 
living 
that 
mankind 
has 
experienced 
during 
this 
time 
occurred 
in 
spite 
of 
this 
development, 
and 
the 
increase 
of 
wealth 
and 
living 
standards 
would 
have 
been 
far 
greater 
if 
the 
development 
in 
question 
had 
not 
taken 
place. 
Again, 
then: 
How 
would 
real, 
rational, 
peace-seeking 
people 
have 
solved 
the 
problem 
of 
social 
conflict? 
And 
let 
me 
emphasize 
the 
word 
“real” 
here. 
The 
people 
I 
have 
in 
mind, 
deliberating 
on 
this 
question, 
are 
not 
zombies. 
They 
do 
not 
sit 
behind 
a 
“veil 
of 
ignorance,” 
à 
la 
Rawls, 
unconstrained 
by 
scarcity 
and 
time. 
(No 
wonder 
Rawls 
reached 
the 
most 
perverse 
conclusions 
from 
such 
a 
premise!) 
They 
stand 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
life, 
so 
to 
speak, 
when 
they 
begin 
their 
deliberations. 
They 
are 
only 
too 
familiar 
with 
the 
inescapable 
fact 
of 
scarcity 
and 
of 
time-constraints. 
They 
already 
work 
and 
produce. 
They 
interact 
with 
other 
workers 
and 
producers, 
and 
they 
have 
already 
many 
goods 
appropriated 
and 
put 
under 
their 
physical 
control, 
i.e., 
taken 
into 
possession. 
Indeed, 
their 
disputes 
are 
invariably 
disputes 
about 
previously 
undisputed 
possessions: 
whether 
these 
are 
to 
be 
further 
respected 
and 
the 
possessor 
is 
to 
be 
regarded 
their 
rightful 
owner 
or 
not. 


What 
people 
would 
most 
likely 
accept 
as 
a 
solution, 
then, 
I 
suggest, 
is 
this: 
Everyone 
is, 
first-off 
or 
prima 
facie, 
presumed 
to 
be 
the 
owner— 
endowed 
with 
the 
right 
of 
exclusive 
control—of 
all 
those 
goods 
that 
he 
already, 
in 
fact, 
and 
so 
far 
undisputed, 
controls 
and 
possesses. 
This 
is 
the 
starting 
point. 
As 
their 
possessor, 
he 
has, 
prima 
facie, 
a 
better 
claim 
to 
the 
things 
in 
question 
than 
anyone 
else 
who 
does 
not 
control 
and 
does 
not 



possess 
these 
goods—and 
consequently, 
if 
someone 
else 
interferes 
with 
the 
possessor’s 
control 
of 
such 
goods, 
then 
this 
person 
is 
prima 
facie 
in 
the 
wrong 
and 
the 
burden 
of 
proof, 
that 
is 
to 
show 
otherwise, 
is 
on 
him. 
However, 
as 
this 
last 
qualification 
already 
shows, 
present 
possession 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
be 
in 
the 
right. 
There 
is 
a 
presumption 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
first, 
actual 
possessor, 
and 
the 
demonstration 
of 
who 
has 
actual 
control 
or 
who 
took 
first 
control 
of 
something 
stands 
always 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
an 
attempt 
at 
conflict 
resolution 
(because, 
to 
reiterate, 
every 
conflict 
is 
a 
conflict 
between 
someone 
who 
already 
controls 
something 
and 
someone 
else 
who 
wants 
to 
do 
so 
instead). 
But 
there 
are 
exceptions 
to 
this 
rule. 
The 
actual 
possessor 
of 
a 
good 
is 
not 
its 
rightful 
owner, 
if 
someone 
else 
can 
demonstrate 
that 
the 
good 
in 
question 
had 
been 
previously 
controlled 
by 
him 
and 
was 
taken 
away 
from 
him 
against 
his 
will 
and 
consent—that 
it 
was 
stolen 
or 
robbed 
from 
him—by 
the 
current 
possessor. 
If 
he 
can 
demonstrate 
this, 
then 
ownership 
reverts 
back 
to 
him 
and 
in 
the 
conflict 
between 
him 
and 
the 
actual 
possessor 
he 
is 
judged 
to 
be 
in 
the 
right. 
And 
the 
current 
possessor 
of 
some 
thing 
is 
likewise 
not 
its 
owner, 
if 
he 
has 
only 
rented 
the 
thing 
in 
question 
from 
someone 
else 
for 
some 
time 
and 
under 
some 
stated 
conditions 
and 
this 
other 
person 
can 
demonstrate 
this 
fact 
by 
presenting, 
for 
instance, 
a 
prior 
rental 
contract 
or 
agreement. 
And 
the 
current 
possessor 
of 
a 
thing 
is 
also 
not 
its 
owner 
if 
he 
worked 
on 
behalf 
of 
someone 
else, 
as 
his 
employee, 
to 
use 
or 
produce 
the 
good 
in 
question 
and 
the 
employer 
can 
demonstrate 
this 
to 
be 
the 
fact 
by, 
for 
instance, 
presenting 
an 
employment 
contract.[2] 


The 
criteria, 
the 
principles, 
employed 
in 
deciding 
a 
conflict 
between 
a 
present 
controller 
and 
possessor 
of 
something 
and 
the 
rival 
claims 
of 
another 
person 
to 
control 
the 
same 
thing 
are 
clear 
then, 
and 
it 
can 
be 
safely 
assumed 
that 
universal 
agreement 
among 
real 
people 
can 
and 
will 
be 
reached 
regarding 
them. 
What 
is 
lacking 
in 
actual 
conflicts, 
then, 
is 
not 
the 
absence 
of 
law, 
lawlessness, 
but 
only 
the 
absence 
of 
an 
agreement 
on 
the 
facts. 
And 
the 
need 
for 
judges 
and 
conflict 
arbitrators, 
then, 
is 
not 
a 
need 
for 
law-making, 
but 
a 
need 
for 
fact-finding 
and 
the 
application 
of 
given 
law 
to 
individual 
cases 
and 
specific 
situations. 
Put 
somewhat 
differently: 
the 
deliberations 
will 
result 
in 
the 
insight 
that 
laws 
are 
not 
to 
be 
made 
but 
given 
to 
be 
discovered, 
and 
that 
the 
task 
of 
the 
judge 
is 
only 
and 
exclusively 
that 
of 
applying 
given 
law 
to 
established 
or 
to 
be 
established 
facts. 


Assuming 
then 
a 
demand 
on 
the 
part 
of 
conflicting 
parties 
for 



specialized 
judges, 
arbitrators, 
and 
peacemakers, 
not 
to 
make 
law 
but 
to 
apply 
given 
law, 
to 
whom 
will 
people 
turn 
to 
satisfy 
this 
demand? 
Obviously, 
they 
will 
not 
turn 
to 
just 
anyone, 
because 
most 
people 
do 
not 
have 
the 
intellectual 
ability 
or 
the 
character 
necessary 
to 
make 
for 
a 
quality 
judge 
and 
most 
people’s 
words, 
then, 
have 
no 
authority 
and 
little 
if 
any 
chance 
of 
being 
listened 
to, 
respected 
and 
enforced. 
Instead, 
in 
order 
to 
settle 
their 
conflicts 
and 
to 
have 
the 
settlement 
lastingly 
recognized 
and 
respected 
by 
others, 
they 
will 
turn 
to 
natural 
authorities, 
to 
members 
of 
the 
natural 
aristocracy, 
to 
nobles 
and 
kings. 


What 
I 
mean 
by 
natural 
aristocrats, 
nobles 
and 
kings 
here 
is 
simply 
this: 
In 
every 
society 
of 
some 
minimum 
degree 
of 
complexity, 
a 
few 
individuals 
acquire 
the 
status 
of 
a 
natural 
elite. 
Due 
to 
superior 
achievements 
of 
wealth, 
wisdom, 
bravery, 
or 
a 
combination 
thereof, 
some 
individuals 
come 
to 
possess 
more 
authority 
than 
others 
and 
their 
opinion 
and 
judgment 
commands 
widespread 
respect. 
Moreover, 
because 
of 
selective 
mating 
and 
the 
laws 
of 
civil 
and 
genetic 
inheritance, 
positions 
of 
natural 
authority 
are 
often 
passed 
on 
within 
a 
few 
“noble” 
families. 
It 
is 
to 
the 
heads 
of 
such 
families 
with 
established 
records 
of 
superior 
achievement, 
farsightedness 
and 
exemplary 
conduct 
that 
men 
typically 
turn 
with 
their 
conflicts 
and 
complaints 
against 
each 
other. 
It 
is 
the 
leaders 
of 
the 
noble 
families 
who 
generally 
act 
as 
judges 
and 
peace-makers, 
often 
free 
of 
charge, 
out 
of 
a 
sense 
of 
civic 
duty. 
In 
fact, 
this 
phenomenon 
can 
still 
be 
observed 
today, 
in 
every 
small 
community. 


Now 
back 
to 
the 
question 
as 
to 
the 
likely 
outcome 
of 
a 
deliberation 
among 
real 
people 
about 
how 
to 
resolve 
the 
ineradicable 
human 
problem 
of 
interpersonal 
conflicts. 
We 
can 
easily 
imagine, 
for 
instance, 
that 
there 
will 
be 
general 
agreement 
that 
in 
every 
case 
of 
conflict 
one 
will 
turn 
to 
some 
specific 
individual, 
to 
the 
head 
of 
the 
most 
noble 
of 
families, 
a 
king. 
But 
as 
already 
indicated, 
it 
is 
unimaginable 
that 
there 
will 
be 
agreement 
that 
this 
king 
can 
make 
laws. 
The 
king 
will 
be 
held 
to 
be 
under 
and 
bound 
by 
the 
same 
law 
as 
everyone 
else. 
The 
king 
is 
supposed 
to 
only 
apply 
law, 
not 
make 
it. 
And 
to 
assure 
this, 
the 
king 
will 
never 
be 
granted 
a 
monopoly 
on 
his 
position 
as 
judge. 
It 
might 
be 
the 
case 
that 
everyone 
does 
in 
fact 
turn 
to 
him 
for 
justice, 
i.e., 
that 
he 
has 
a 
‘natural’ 
monopoly 
as 
ultimate 
judge 
and 
peacemaker. 
But 
everyone 
remains 
free 
to 
select 
another 
judge, 
another 
noble, 
if 
he 
is 
dissatisfied 
with 
the 
king. 
The 
king 
has 
no 
legal 
monopoly 
on 
his 
position 
as 
judge, 
that 
is. 
If 
he 
is 
found 
to 
make 
law, 
instead 
of 
just 
applying 
it, 
or 
if 
he 
is 



found 
to 
commit 
errors 
in 
the 
application 
of 
law, 
i.e., 
if 
he 
misconstrues, 
misrepresents, 
or 
falsifies 
the 
facts 
of 
a 
given 
case, 
his 
judgment 
stands 
open 
to 
be 
challenged 
in 
another 
noble 
court 
of 
justice, 
and 
he 
himself 
can 
there 
be 
held 
liable 
for 
his 
misjudgment. 
In 
short, 
the 
king 
may 
look 
like 
the 
head 
of 
a 
State, 
but 
he 
definitely 
is 
not 
a 
State 
but 
instead 
part 
of 
a 
natural, 
vertically 
and 
hierarchically 
structured 
and 
stratified 
social 
order: 
an 
aristocracy. 


As 
I 
already 
indicated 
before, 
something 
like 
this, 
something 
resembling 
an 
aristocratic 
natural 
order 
had 
come 
into 
existence, 
for 
instance, 
during 
the 
early 
European 
Middle 
Ages, 
during 
the 
much-maligned 
feudal 
age. 
Since 
it 
is 
not 
my 
purpose 
here 
to 
engage 
in 
standard 
history, 
i.e., 
history 
as 
it 
is 
written 
by 
historians, 
but 
to 
offer 
a 
logical 
or 
sociological 
reconstruction 
of 
history, 
informed 
by 
actual 
historical 
events, 
but 
motivated 
more 
fundamentally 
by 
theoretical—philosophical 
and 
economic—concerns, 
I 
will 
not 
spend 
much 
time 
to 
prove 
this 
thesis. 
I 
simply 
refer 
summarily 
to 
a 
book 
on 
this 
subject 
by 
Fritz 
Kern, 
Kingship 
and 
Law 
in 
the 
Middle 
Ages 
(originally 
published 
in 
German 
in 
1914), 
and 
to 
numerous 
other 
references 
given 
to 
this 
effect 
in 
my 
book 
Democracy: 
The 
God 
That 
Failed. 
Only 
this 
much 
on 
the 
allegedly 
“dark” 
age 
of 
feudalism 
and 
in 
support 
of 
my 
assertion 
that 
the 
Middle 
Ages 
can 
serve 
as 
a 
rough 
historical 
example 
of 
what 
I 
have 
just 
described 
as 
a 
natural 
order. 


Feudal 
lords 
and 
kings 
could 
only 
“tax” 
with 
the 
consent 
of 
the 
taxed, 
and 
on 
his 
own 
land, 
every 
free 
man 
was 
as 
much 
of 
a 
sovereign, 
i.e., 
the 
ultimate 
decision 
maker, 
as 
the 
feudal 
king 
was 
on 
his. 
Without 
consent, 
taxation 
was 
considered 
sequestration, 
i.e., 
unlawful 
expropriation. 
The 
king 
was 
below 
and 
subordinate 
to 
the 
law. 
The 
king 
might 
be 
a 
noble, 
even 
the 
noblest 
person 
of 
all, 
but 
there 
were 
other 
nobles 
and 
not-so-nobles, 
and 
all 
of 
them, 
every 
noble 
and 
every 
free 
man 
no 
less 
or 
more 
than 
the 
king 
himself 
was 
subordinate 
to 
the 
same 
law 
and 
bound 
to 
protect 
and 
uphold 
this 
law. 
This 
law 
was 
considered 
ancient 
and 
eternal. 
“New” 
laws 
were 
routinely 
rejected 
as 
not 
laws 
at 
all. 
The 
sole 
function 
of 
the 
medieval 
king 
was 
that 
of 
applying 
and 
protecting 
“good 
old 
law.” 
The 
idea 
of 
kingship 
by 
birthright 
was 
absent 
during 
early 
medieval 
times. 
To 
become 
king 
required 
the 
consent 
of 
those 
doing 
the 
choosing, 
and 
every 
member 
and 
every 
section 
of 
the 
community 
of 
electors 
was 
free 
to 
resist 
the 
king 
if 
it 
deemed 
his 
actions 
unlawful. 
In 
that 
case, 
people 
were 
free 
to 
abandon 
the 
king 
and 
seek 
out 
a 
new 
one. 



This 
brief 
description 
of 
the 
feudal 
order 
or 
more 
specifically 
“allodial” 
feudalism 
shall 
suffice 
for 
my 
purpose. 
Let 
me 
only 
add 
this. 
I 
do 
not 
claim 
here 
that 
this 
order 
was 
perfect, 
a 
true 
natural 
order, 
as 
I 
have 
characterized 
it 
before. 
In 
fact, 
it 
was 
marred 
by 
many 
imperfections, 
most 
notably 
the 
existence, 
at 
many 
places, 
of 
the 
institution 
of 
serfdom 
(although 
the 
burden 
imposed 
on 
serfs 
then 
was 
mild 
compared 
to 
that 
imposed 
on 
today’s 
modern 
tax-serfs). 
I 
only 
claim 
that 
this 
order 
approached 
a 
natural 
order 
through 
(a) 
the 
supremacy 
of 
and 
the 
subordination 
of 
everyone 
under 
one 
law, 
(b) 
the 
absence 
of 
any 
law-making 
power, 
and 
(c) 
the 
lack 
of 
any 
legal 
monopoly 
of 
judgeship 
and 
conflict 
arbitration. 
And 
I 
would 
claim 
that 
this 
system 
could 
have 
been 
perfected 
and 
retained 
virtually 
unchanged 
through 
the 
inclusion 
of 
serfs 
into 
the 
system. 


But 
this 
is 
not 
what 
happened. 
Instead, 
a 
fundamental 
moral 
and 
economic 
folly 
was 
committed. 
A 
territorial 
monopoly 
of 
ultimate 
judgeship 
was 
established 
and 
with 
this 
the 
power 
of 
law-making, 
and 
the 
separation 
of 
law 
from 
and 
its 
subordination 
to 
legislation. 
Feudal 
kings 
were 
replaced 
first 
by 
absolute 
and 
then 
by 
constitutional 
kings. 


Conceptually, 
the 
step 
from 
a 
feudal 
king 
under 
the 
law 
to 
an 
absolute 
king 
above 
the 
law 
is 
a 
small 
one. 
The 
formerly 
feudal 
king 
only 
insists 
that 
henceforth 
no 
one 
may 
rightfully 
choose 
anyone 
else 
but 
himself 
as 
ultimate 
judge. 
Until 
then, 
the 
king 
might 
have 
been 
the 
only 
person 
to 
whom 
everyone 
turned 
for 
justice, 
but 
others, 
other 
nobles 
in 
particular, 
could 
have 
acted 
as 
judges 
if 
only 
they 
had 
wanted 
to 
do 
so 
and 
there 
had 
been 
a 
demand 
for 
such 
services 
on 
the 
part 
of 
justice-seekers. 
Indeed, 
everyone 
had 
been 
free 
to 
engage 
in 
self-defense 
of 
his 
person 
and 
property 
and 
in 
private 
self-
adjudication 
and 
conflict 
resolution, 
and 
the 
king 
himself 
could 
be 
held 
accountable 
and 
brought 
to 
justice 
in 
other 
courts 
of 
justice, 
i.e., 
courts 
not 
of 
his 
own 
choosing. 
To 
prohibit 
all 
this 
and 
insist 
instead 
that 
all 
conflicts 
be 
subject 
to 
final 
royal 
review, 
then, 
is 
no 
less 
than 
a 
coup, 
with 
momentous 
consequences. 
As 
already 
indicated 
before, 
with 
the 
monopolization 
of 
the 
function 
of 
ultimate 
judge, 
the 
king 
had 
become 
a 
State 
and 
private 
property 
had 
been 
essentially 
abolished 
and 
replaced 
by 
fiat 
property, 
i.e., 
by 
property 
granted 
by 
the 
king 
to 
his 
subjects. 
The 
king 
could 
now 
tax 
private 
property 
instead 
of 
having 
to 
ask 
private 
property 
owners 
for 
subsidies, 
and 
he 
could 
make 
laws 
instead 
of 
being 
bound 
by 
unchangeable 
pre-existing 
laws. 



Consequently, 
slowly 
but 
surely 
law 
and 
law 
enforcement 
became 
more 
expensive: 
instead 
of 
being 
offered 
free 
of 
charge 
or 
for 
a 
voluntary 
payment, 
they 
were 
financed 
with 
the 
help 
of 
a 
compulsory 
tax. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
quality 
of 
law 
deteriorated: 
Instead 
of 
upholding 
pre-existing 
law 
and 
applying 
universal 
and 
immutable 
principles 
of 
justice, 
the 
king, 
as 
a 
monopolistic 
judge 
who 
did 
not 
have 
to 
fear 
losing 
clients 
as 
a 
result 
of 
being 
less 
than 
impartial 
in 
his 
judgments, 
did 
successively 
alter 
the 
existing 
law 
to 
his 
own 
advantage. 


Moreover, 
a 
new 
level 
and 
quality 
of 
violence 
was 
introduced 
into 
society. 
To 
be 
sure, 
violence 
had 
characterized 
the 
relationship 
between 
men 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
history. 
But 
violence, 
aggression, 
is 
costly, 
and 
until 
the 
development 
of 
the 
institution 
of 
a 
State, 
an 
aggressor 
had 
to 
bear 
the 
full 
cost 
associated 
with 
aggression 
himself. 
Now, 
however, 
with 
a 
state-king 
in 
place, 
the 
costs 
of 
aggression 
could 
be 
externalized 
onto 
third 
parties 
(taxpayers 
and 
draftees) 
and 
accordingly 
aggression, 
or 
more 
specifically 
imperialism, 
i.e., 
attempts 
of 
aggressively, 
through 
war 
and 
conquest, 
enlarging 
one’s 
territory 
and 
one’s 
subject 
population, 
increased 
correspondingly. 


Yet 
how 
was 
such 
a 
development 
possible, 
predictable 
as 
its 
consequences 
are? 
While 
it 
is 
not 
difficult 
to 
understand 
why 
a 
feudal 
king 
might 
want 
to 
become 
an 
absolute 
king, 
i.e., 
the 
head 
of 
a 
State: 
for 
who, 
except 
angels, 
would 
not 
like 
to 
be 
in 
the 
position 
where 
he 
can 
decide 
all 
conflicts 
including 
conflicts 
involving 
himself? 
It 
is 
far 
more 
difficult 
to 
understand 
how 
the 
king, 
even 
if 
he 
is 
the 
most 
noble 
of 
noble 
people, 
can 
get 
away 
with 
such 
a 
coup. 
Obviously, 
any 
would-be-State 
king 
would 
run 
into 
immediate 
opposition, 
most 
likely 
and 
most 
ferociously 
from 
other 
nobles, 
since 
they 
are 
the 
ones 
who 
typically 
own 
more 
and 
have 
larger 
estates 
and 
hence 
would 
have 
to 
fear 
the 
most 
from 
the 
king’s 
power 
to 
tax 
and 
legislate. 


The 
answer 
to 
this 
question 
is 
actually 
quite 
simple 
and 
we 
are 
essentially 
familiar 
with 
it 
to 
this 
day. 
The 
king 
aligned 
himself 
with 
the 
“people” 
or 
the 
“common 
man.” 
He 
appealed 
to 
the 
always 
and 
everywhere 
popular 
sentiment 
of 
envy 
among 
the 
“underprivileged” 
against 
their 
own 
“betters” 
and 
“superiors,” 
their 
lords. 
He 
offered 
to 
free 
them 
of 
their 
contractual 
obligations 
vis-à-vis 
their 
lords, 
to 
make 
them 
owners 
rather 
than 
tenants 
of 
their 
holdings, 
for 
instance, 
or 
to 
“forgive” 
their 
debts 
to 
their 
creditors, 
and 
could 
so 
corrupt 
the 
public 
sense 
of 
justice 
sufficiently 
to 



render 
the 
aristocratic 
resistance 
against 
his 
coup 
futile. 
And 
to 
console 
the 
aristocracy 
over 
its 
loss 
of 
power 
and 
thus 
reduce 
their 
resistance, 
the 
king 
further 
offered 
them 
posts 
in 
his 
much 
enlarged 
and 
expanded 
royal 
courts. 


Moreover, 
to 
achieve 
his 
goal 
of 
absolute 
power 
the 
king 
also 
aligned 
himself 
with 
the 
intellectuals. 
The 
demand 
for 
intellectual 
services 
is 
typically 
low, 
and 
intellectuals, 
almost 
congenitally, 
suffer 
from 
a 
greatly 
inflated 
self-image 
and 
hence 
are 
always 
prone 
to 
and 
become 
easily 
avid 
promoters 
of 
envy. 
The 
king 
offered 
them 
a 
secure 
position 
as 
court 
intellectuals 
and 
they 
then 
returned 
the 
favor 
and 
produced 
the 
necessary 
ideological 
support 
for 
the 
king’s 
position 
as 
absolute 
ruler. 
They 
did 
this 
through 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
twofold 
myth: 
On 
the 
one 
hand 
they 
portrayed 
the 
history 
before 
the 
arrival 
of 
the 
absolute 
king 
in 
the 
worst 
possible 
light, 
as 
a 
ceaseless 
struggle 
of 
all 
against 
all, 
with 
one 
man 
being 
another 
man’s 
wolf 
—contrary 
to 
the 
actual 
history 
of 
a 
prior 
natural 
aristocratic 
order. 
And 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
they 
portrayed 
the 
king’s 
assumption 
of 
absolute 
power 
as 
the 
result 
of 
some 
sort 
of 
contractual 
agreement 
by 
his 
subjects, 
presumably 
reached 
rationally, 
based 
on 
the 
myth 
of 
the 
otherwise 
threatening 
return 
to 
the 
bellum 
omnia 
contra 
omnes. 


I 
have 
already 
shown 
that 
no 
such 
contract 
is 
conceivable, 
and 
that 
the 
notion 
of 
any 
such 
contract 
is 
sheer 
myth. 
No 
person 
in 
his 
right 
mind 
would 
sign 
such 
a 
contract. 
But 
as 
I 
hardly 
need 
emphasize, 
this 
idea, 
i.e., 
that 
the 
power 
of 
the 
State 
as 
a 
territorial 
monopolist 
of 
ultimate 
decision-making 
is 
grounded 
and 
founded 
in 
some 
sort 
of 
contract 
holds 
sway 
in 
the 
heads 
of 
the 
populace 
to 
this 
day. 
Absurd 
as 
it 
is, 
then, 
the 
court 
intellectuals 
were 
remarkably 
successful 
in 
their 
work. 


As 
the 
result 
of 
the 
intellectuals’ 
ideological 
work 
of 
promoting 
this 
twofold 
myth: 
of 
presenting 
the 
rise 
of 
absolute 
monarchs 
as 
the 
result 
of 
a 
contract, 
the 
king’s 
absolute 
monarchy 
was 
turned 
into 
a 
constitutional 
monarchy. 
In 
schoolbooks 
and 
the 
official, 
orthodox 
historiography 
this 
transition 
from 
absolute 
to 
constitutional 
monarchy 
is 
typically 
presented 
as 
a 
great 
step 
forward 
in 
human 
history, 
as 
progress. 
In 
fact, 
however, 
it 
represented 
another 
folly 
and 
initiated 
still 
further 
decay. 
For 
whereas 
the 
position 
of 
the 
absolute 
king 
was 
at 
best 
a 
tenuous 
one, 
as 
the 
memory 
of 
his 
actual 
rise 
to 
absolute 
power 
through 
an 
act 
of 
usurpation 
still 
lingered 
on 
and 
thus 
effectively 
limited 
his 
“absolute” 
power, 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
constitution 
actually 
formalized 
and 
codified 
his 
power 
to 
tax 
and 
to 
legislate. 



The 
constitution 
was 
not 
something 
that 
protected 
the 
people 
from 
the 
king, 
but 
it 
protected 
the 
king 
from 
the 
people. 
It 
was 
a 
State-constitution, 
which 
presupposed 
what 
was 
formerly 
still 
considered 
with 
greatest 
suspicion, 
namely 
the 
right 
to 
tax 
without 
consent 
and 
to 
make 
laws. 
The 
constitutional 
king, 
in 
subjecting 
himself 
to 
a 
few 
formalities 
and 
procedural 
routines, 
was 
thus 
enabled 
to 
expand 
his 
powers 
and 
enrich 
himself 
far 
beyond 
anything 
possible 
for 
him 
as 
an 
absolute 
monarch. 


Ironically, 
the 
very 
forces 
that 
elevated 
the 
feudal 
king 
first 
to 
the 
position 
of 
absolute 
and 
then 
of 
constitutional 
king: 
the 
appeal 
to 
egalitarian 
sentiments 
and 
the 
envy 
of 
the 
common 
man 
against 
his 
betters 
and 
the 
enlistment 
of 
the 
intellectuals, 
also 
helped 
bring 
about 
the 
king’s 
own 
downfall 
and 
paved 
the 
way 
to 
another, 
even 
greater 
folly: 
the 
transition 
from 
monarchy 
to 
democracy. 


When 
the 
king’s 
promises 
of 
better 
and 
cheaper 
justice 
turned 
out 
to 
be 
empty 
and 
the 
intellectuals 
were 
still 
dissatisfied 
with 
their 
social 
rank 
and 
position, 
as 
was 
to 
be 
predicted, 
the 
intellectuals 
turned 
the 
same 
egalitarian 
sentiments 
that 
the 
king 
had 
previously 
courted 
in 
his 
battle 
against 
his 
aristocratic 
competitors 
against 
the 
monarchical 
ruler 
himself. 
After 
all, 
the 
king 
himself 
was 
a 
member 
of 
the 
nobility, 
and 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
exclusion 
of 
all 
other 
nobles 
as 
potential 
judges, 
his 
position 
had 
become 
only 
more 
elevated 
and 
elitist 
and 
his 
conduct 
even 
more 
arrogant. 
Accordingly, 
it 
appeared 
only 
logical 
that 
the 
king, 
too, 
should 
be 
brought 
down 
and 
that 
the 
egalitarian 
policies 
which 
the 
king 
had 
initiated, 
be 
carried 
through 
to 
their 
ultimate 
conclusion: 
the 
control 
of 
the 
judiciary 
by 
the 
common 
man, 
which 
to 
the 
intellectuals 
meant 
by 
themselves, 
as, 
as 
they 
viewed 
it, 
the 
“natural 
spokesmen 
of 
the 
people.” 


The 
intellectual 
criticism 
directed 
against 
the 
king 
was 
not 
a 
criticism 
of 
the 
institution 
of 
a 
legal 
monopoly 
of 
ultimate 
decision-making, 
however, 
which, 
as 
I 
have 
explained, 
constitutes 
the 
ultimate 
moral 
and 
economic 
folly 
and 
the 
root 
of 
all 
evil. 
The 
critics 
did 
not 
want 
to 
return 
to 
a 
natural 
aristocratic 
order, 
in 
which 
they 
themselves 
would 
play 
only 
a 
minor 
albeit 
important 
role. 
But 
they 
did, 
in 
their 
criticism, 
make 
a 
superficial 
appeal 
to 
the 
old 
and 
ineradicable 
notion 
of 
the 
equality 
of 
everyone 
before 
the 
law 
or 
the 
superiority 
of 
law 
above 
all. 
Thus, 
they 
argued 
that 
monarchy 
rested 
on 
personal 
privilege 
and 
that 
such 
a 
privilege 
was 
incompatible 
with 
equality 



before 
the 
law. 
And 
they 
suggested 
that 
by 
opening 
participation 
and 
entry 
into 
State 
government 
to 
everyone 
on 
equal 
terms—that 
is, 
by 
replacing 
a 
monarchy 
with 
a 
democracy—the 
principle 
of 
the 
equality 
of 
all 
before 
the 
law 
was 
satisfied. 


Appealing 
as 
this 
argument 
might 
at 
first 
appear, 
it 
is 
fundamentally 
wrong, 
however. 
Because 
democratic 
equality 
before 
the 
law 
is 
something 
entirely 
different 
from 
and 
incompatible 
with 
the 
old 
idea 
of 
one 
universal 
law, 
equally 
applicable 
to 
everyone, 
everywhere 
and 
at 
all 
times. 
Under 
democracy, 
everyone 
is 
equal 
insofar 
as 
entry 
into 
state 
government 
is 
open 
to 
all 
on 
equal 
terms. 
Everyone 
can 
become 
king, 
so 
to 
say, 
not 
only 
a 
privileged 
circle 
of 
people, 
i.e., 
the 
king 
and 
whomever 
he 
in 
his 
absolute 
or 
constitutional 
powers 
designates 
as 
his 
successor. 
Thus, 
in 
a 
democracy 
no 
personal 
privilege 
or 
privileged 
persons 
exist. 
However, 
functional 
privileges 
and 
privileged 
functions 
exist. 
State 
agents, 
i.e., 
so-called 
public 
officials, 
as 
long 
as 
they 
act 
in 
an 
official 
capacity, 
are 
governed 
and 
protected 
by 
public 
law 
and 
occupy 
thereby 
a 
privileged 
position 
vis-à-vis 
persons 
acting 
under 
the 
mere 
authority 
of 
private 
law. 


For 
one, 
public 
officials 
are, 
just 
like 
any 
absolute 
or 
constitutional 
king, 
permitted 
to 
finance 
or 
subsidize 
their 
own 
activities 
through 
taxes. 
That 
is, 
they 
do 
not, 
as 
every 
private-law 
citizen 
must, 
earn 
their 
income 
through 
the 
production 
and 
subsequent 
sale 
of 
goods 
and 
services 
to 
voluntarily 
buying 
or 
not-buying 
consumers. 
Rather, 
as 
public 
officials 
they 
are 
permitted 
to 
engage 
in, 
and 
live 
off, 
what 
in 
private 
dealings, 
between 
private-law 
subjects, 
is 
considered 
robbery, 
theft, 
and 
stolen 
loot. 
Thus, 
privilege 
and 
legal 
discrimination—and 
the 
distinction 
between 
rulers 
and 
subjects—do 
not 
disappear 
under 
democracy. 
To 
the 
contrary. 
Rather 
than 
being 
restricted 
to 
princes 
and 
nobles, 
under 
democracy, 
privileges 
come 
into 
the 
reach 
of 
everyone: 
Everyone 
can 
participate 
in 
theft 
and 
live 
off 
stolen 
loot 
if 
only 
he 
becomes 
a 
public 
official. 
Likewise, 
democratically 
elected 
parliaments 
are, 
just 
like 
any 
absolute 
or 
constitutional 
king, 
not 
bound 
by 
any 
superior, 
natural 
law, 
i.e., 
by 
law 
not 
of 
their 
own 
making 
(such 
as 
and 
including 
so-
called 
constitutional 
law), 
but 
they 
can 
legislate, 
i.e., 
they 
can 
make 
and 
change 
laws. 
Only: 
While 
a 
king 
legislates 
in 
his 
own 
favor, 
under 
democracy 
everyone 
is 
free 
to 
promote 
and 
try 
to 
put 
into 
effect 
legislation 
in 
his 
own 
favor, 
provided 
only 
that 
he 
finds 
entry 
into 
parliament 
or 
government. 



Predictably, 
then, 
under 
democratic 
conditions 
the 
tendency 
of 
every 
monopoly 
of 
ultimate 
decision-making 
to 
increase 
the 
price 
of 
justice 
and 
to 
lower 
its 
quality 
is 
not 
diminished 
but 
aggravated. 


Theoretically 
speaking, 
the 
transition 
from 
monarchy 
to 
democracy 
involves 
no 
more 
(or 
less) 
than 
the 
replacement 
of 
a 
permanent, 
hereditary 
monopoly 
“owner”—the 
king—by 
temporary 
and 
interchangeable 
“caretakers”—by 
presidents, 
prime 
ministers, 
and 
members 
of 
parliament. 
Both, 
kings 
and 
presidents, 
will 
produce 
“bads,” 
i.e., 
they 
tax 
and 
they 
legislate. 
Yet 
a 
king, 
because 
he 
“owns” 
the 
monopoly 
and 
may 
sell 
and 
bequeath 
his 
realm 
to 
a 
successor 
of 
his 
choosing, 
his 
heir, 
will 
care 
about 
the 
repercussions 
of 
his 
actions 
on 
capital 
values. 


As 
the 
owner 
of 
the 
capital 
stock 
on 
“his” 
territory, 
the 
king 
will 
be 
comparatively 
future-oriented. 
In 
order 
to 
preserve 
or 
enhance 
the 
value 
of 
his 
property, 
his 
exploitation 
will 
be 
comparatively 
moderate 
and 
calculating. 
In 
contrast, 
a 
temporary 
and 
interchangeable 
democratic 
caretaker 
does 
not 
own 
the 
country, 
but 
as 
long 
as 
he 
is 
in 
office 
he 
is 
permitted 
to 
use 
it 
to 
his 
own 
advantage. 
He 
owns 
its 
current 
use 
but 
not 
its 
capital 
stock. 
This 
does 
not 
eliminate 
exploitation. 
Instead, 
it 
makes 
exploitation 
shortsighted, 
present-oriented, 
and 
uncalculating, 
i.e., 
carried 
out 
with 
no 
or 
little 
regard 
for 
the 
value 
of 
the 
capital 
stock. 
In 
short, 
it 
promotes 
capital 
consumption. 


Nor 
is 
it 
an 
advantage 
of 
democracy 
that 
free 
entry 
into 
every 
state 
position 
exists 
(whereas 
under 
monarchy 
entry 
is 
restricted 
to 
the 
king’s 
discretion). 
To 
the 
contrary, 
only 
competition 
in 
the 
production 
of 
goods 
is 
a 
good 
thing. 
Competition 
in 
the 
production 
of 
bads, 
such 
as 
taxation 
and 
legislation, 
is 
not 
good. 
In 
fact, 
it 
is 
worse 
than 
bad. 
It 
is 
sheer 
evil. 
Kings, 
coming 
into 
their 
position 
by 
virtue 
of 
birth, 
might 
be 
harmless 
dilettantes 
or 
decent 
men 
(and 
if 
they 
are 
“madmen” 
they 
will 
be 
quickly 
restrained 
or, 
if 
need 
be, 
killed 
by 
close 
relatives 
concerned 
with 
the 
possessions 
of 
the 
royal 
family, 
the 
dynasty). 
In 
sharp 
contrast, 
the 
selection 
of 
state 
rulers 
by 
means 
of 
popular 
elections 
makes 
it 
essentially 
impossible 
for 
a 
harmless 
or 
decent 
person 
to 
ever 
rise 
to 
the 
top. 
Presidents 
and 
prime 
ministers 
come 
into 
their 
position 
not 
owing 
to 
their 
status 
as 
natural 
aristocrats, 
as 
feudal 
kings 
once 
did, 
i.e., 
based 
on 
the 
recognition 
of 
their 
economic 
independence, 
outstanding 
professional 
achievement, 
morally 
impeccable 
personal 
life, 
wisdom 
and 
superior 
judgment 
and 
taste, 
but 
as 
a 
result 
of 
their 
capacity 
as 
morally 
uninhibited 
demagogues. 
Hence, 
democracy 
virtually 
assures 
that 



only 
dangerous 
men 
will 
rise 
to 
the 
top 
of 
state 
government. 


In 
addition: 
Under 
democracy 
the 
distinction 
between 
the 
rulers 
and 
the 
ruled 
becomes 
blurred. 
The 
illusion 
even 
arises 
that 
the 
distinction 
no 
longer 
exists: 
that 
with 
democratic 
government 
no 
one 
is 
ruled 
by 
anyone, 
but 
everyone 
instead 
rules 
himself. 
Accordingly, 
public 
resistance 
against 
government 
power 
is 
systematically 
weakened. 
While 
exploitation 
and 
expropriation—taxation 
and 
legislation—before 
might 
have 
appeared 
plainly 
oppressive 
and 
evil 
to 
the 
public, 
they 
seem 
much 
less 
so, 
mankind 
being 
what 
it 
is, 
once 
anyone 
can 
freely 
enter 
the 
ranks 
of 
those 
who 
are 
at 
the 
receiving 
end, 
and 
consequently 
there 
will 
be 
more 
of 
it. 


Worse: 
Under 
democracy 
the 
social 
character 
and 
personality 
structure 
of 
the 
entire 
population 
will 
be 
changed 
systematically. 
All 
of 
society 
will 
be 
thoroughly 
politicized. 
During 
the 
monarchical 
age, 
the 
ancient 
aristocratic 
order 
had 
still 
remained 
somewhat 
intact. 
Only 
the 
king 
and, 
indirectly, 
the 
members 
of 
his 
(exclusive) 
court 
could 
enrich 
themselves—by 
means 
of 
taxation 
and 
legislation—at 
other 
people’s 
and 
their 
properties 
expense. 
Everyone 
else 
had 
to 
stand 
on 
his 
own 
feet, 
so 
to 
say, 
and 
owed 
his 
position 
in 
society, 
his 
wealth 
and 
his 
income, 
to 
some 
sort 
of 
value-productive 
efforts. 
Under 
democracy, 
the 
incentive 
structure 
is 
systematically 
changed. 
Egalitarian 
sentiments 
and 
envy 
are 
given 
free 
reign. 
Everyone, 
not 
just 
the 
king, 
is 
now 
allowed 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
exploitation—via 
legislation 
or 
taxation—of 
everyone 
else. 
Everyone 
is 
free 
to 
express 
any 
confiscatory 
demands 
whatsoever. 
Nothing, 
no 
demand, 
is 
off 
limits. 
In 
Bastiat’s 
words, 
under 
democracy 
the 
State 
becomes 
the 
great 
fiction 
by 
which 
everyone 
seeks 
to 
live 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
everyone 
else. 
Every 
person 
and 
his 
personal 
property 
come 
within 
reach 
of 
and 
are 
up 
for 
grabs 
by 
everyone 
else. 


Under 
a 
one-man-one-vote 
regime, 
then, 
a 
relentless 
machinery 
of 
wealth 
and 
income 
redistribution 
is 
set 
in 
motion. 
It 
must 
be 
expected 
that 
majorities 
of 
have-nots 
will 
constantly 
try 
to 
enrich 
themselves 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
minorities 
of 
haves. 
This 
is 
not 
to 
say 
that 
there 
will 
be 
only 
one 
class 
of 
haves 
and 
one 
class 
of 
have-nots, 
the 
rich 
and 
the 
poor, 
and 
that 
the 
redistribution—via 
taxation 
and 
legislation—will 
occur 
uniformly 
from 
the 
rich 
onto 
the 
poor. 
To 
the 
contrary. 
While 
the 
redistribution 
from 
rich 
to 
poor 
will 
always 
play 
a 
prominent 
role 
and 
is 
indeed 
a 
permanent 
feature 
and 
mainstay 
of 
democracy, 
it 
would 
be 
naïve 
to 
assume 
that 
it 
will 
be 
the 
sole 
or 
even 
the 
predominant 
form 
of 
redistribution. 
After 
all, 
the 
rich 
and 
the 
poor 



are 
usually 
rich 
or 
poor 
for 
a 
reason. 
The 
rich 
are 
characteristically 
bright 
and 
industrious, 
and 
the 
poor 
typically 
dull, 
lazy 
or 
both. 
It 
is 
not 
very 
likely 
that 
dullards, 
even 
if 
they 
make 
up 
a 
majority, 
will 
systematically 
outsmart 
and 
enrich 
themselves 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
a 
minority 
of 
bright 
and 
energetic 
individuals. 
Rather, 
most 
redistribution 
will 
take 
place 
within 
the 
group 
of 
the 
non-poor, 
and 
it 
will 
actually 
be 
frequently 
the 
better 
off 
who 
succeed 
in 
having 
themselves 
subsidized 
by 
the 
poor. 
(Just 
think 
of 
“free” 
university 
education, 
whereby 
the 
working 
class, 
whose 
children 
rarely 
attend 
universities, 
pay 
for 
the 
education 
of 
middle-class 
children!) 
Indeed, 
many 
competing 
parties 
and 
coalitions 
will 
try 
to 
gain 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
others. 
In 
addition, 
there 
will 
be 
a 
variety 
of 
changing 
criteria 
defining 
what 
it 
is 
that 
makes 
a 
person 
a 
have 
(deserving 
to 
be 
looted) 
and 
another 
a 
have-not 
(deserving 
to 
receive 
the 
loot)—and 
it 
will 
be 
the 
intellectuals 
who 
play 
a 
major 
role 
in 
defining 
and 
promoting 
these 
criteria 
(making 
sure, 
of 
course, 
that 
they 
themselves 
will 
always 
be 
classified 
as 
have-nots 
in 
need 
of 
ever 
more 
loot). 
As 
well, 
individuals 
can 
be 
members 
of 
a 
multitude 
of 
groups 
of 
haves 
or 
have-nots, 
losing 
on 
account 
of 
one 
characteristic 
and 
gaining 
on 
account 
of 
another, 
with 
some 
individuals 
ending 
up 
net-losers 
and 
others 
net-winners 
of 
redistribution. 


In 
any 
case, 
however, 
since 
it 
is 
invariably 
something 
valuable, 
something 
“good” 
that 
is 
being 
redistributed—property 
and 
income—of 
which 
the 
haves 
supposedly 
have 
too 
much 
and 
the 
have-nots 
too 
little, 
any 
redistribution 
implies 
that 
the 
incentive 
to 
beget, 
have, 
or 
produce 
something 
of 
value—something 
“good”—is 
systematically 
reduced 
and, 
mutatis 
mutandis, 
the 
incentive 
of 
not 
getting, 
having, 
or 
producing 
anything 
valuable 
—of 
not 
being 
or 
not 
having 
anything 
“good”—but 
relying 
instead 
on 
and 
living 
off 
redistributed 
income 
and 
wealth 
is 
systematically 
increased. 
In 
short, 
the 
proportion 
of 
good 
people 
and 
good, 
value-productive 
activities 
is 
reduced 
and 
the 
proportion 
of 
bad 
or 
not-so-good 
people 
and 
of 
unproductive 
habits, 
character 
traits, 
and 
types 
of 
conduct 
will 
increase, 
with 
the 
overall 
result 
of 
impoverishing 
society 
and 
making 
life 
increasingly 
unpleasant. 


While 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
predict 
the 
exact 
outcome 
of 
the 
permanent 
democratic 
struggle 
of 
all 
against 
all, 
except 
to 
say 
that 
it 
will 
lead 
to 
ever 
higher 
taxes, 
to 
a 
never 
ending 
flood 
of 
legislation 
and 
thus 
increased 
legal 
uncertainty, 
and 
consequently 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
rate 
of 
social 
time-
preference, 
i.e., 
increased 
short-term 
orientation 
(an 
“infantilization” 
of 



society), 
one 
outcome 
of 
this 
struggle, 
one 
result 
of 
democracy 
can 
be 
safely 
predicted, 
however. 
Democracy 
produces 
and 
brings 
about 
a 
new 
power 
elite 
or 
ruling 
class. 
Presidents, 
prime 
ministers, 
and 
the 
leaders 
of 
parliament 
and 
political 
parties 
are 
part 
of 
this 
power 
elite, 
and 
I 
have 
already 
talked 
about 
them 
as 
essentially 
amoral 
demagogues. 
But 
it 
would 
be 
naïve 
to 
assume 
that 
they 
are 
the 
most 
powerful 
and 
influential 
people 
of 
all. 
They 
are 
more 
frequently 
only 
the 
agents 
and 
delegates—those 
doing 
the 
bidding—of 
other 
people 
standing 
on 
the 
sidelines 
and 
out 
of 
public 
view. 
The 
true 
power 
elite, 
which 
determines 
and 
controls 
who 
will 
make 
it 
as 
president, 
prime 
minister, 
party 
leader, 
etc., 
are 
the 
plutocrats. 
The 
plutocrats, 
as 
defined 
by 
the 
great 
but 
largely 
forgotten 
American 
sociologist 
William 
Graham 
Sumner, 
are 
not 
simply 
the 
super-rich—the 
big 
bankers 
and 
the 
captains 
of 
big 
business 
and 
industry. 
Rather, 
the 
plutocrats 
are 
only 
a 
subclass 
of 
the 
super 
rich. 
They 
are 
those 
super 
rich 
big 
bankers 
and 
businessmen, 
who 
have 
realized 
the 
enormous 
potential 
of 
the 
State 
as 
an 
institution 
that 
can 
tax 
and 
legislate 
for 
their 
own 
even 
greater 
future 
enrichment 
and 
who, 
based 
on 
this 
insight, 
have 
decided 
to 
throw 
themselves 
into 
politics. 
They 
realize 
that 
the 
State 
can 
make 
you 
far 
richer 
than 
you 
already 
are: 
whether 
in 
subsidizing 
you, 
in 
awarding 
you 
with 
state 
contracts, 
or 
in 
passing 
laws 
that 
protect 
you 
from 
unwelcome 
competition 
or 
competitors, 
and 
they 
decide 
to 
use 
their 
riches 
to 
capture 
the 
State 
and 
use 
politics 
as 
a 
means 
to 
the 
end 
of 
their 
own 
further 
enrichment 
(rather 
than 
becoming 
richer 
solely 
by 
economic 
means, 
i.e., 
in 
better 
serving 
voluntarily 
paying 
customers 
of 
one’s 
products). 
They 
do 
not 
have 
to 
get 
involved 
in 
politics 
themselves. 
They 
have 
more 
important 
and 
lucrative 
things 
to 
do 
than 
wasting 
their 
time 
with 
everyday 
politics. 
But 
they 
have 
the 
cash 
and 
the 
position 
to 
“buy” 


the 
typically 
far 
less 
affluent 
professional 
politicians, 
either 
directly 
in 
paying 
them 
bribes 
or 
indirectly, 
by 
agreeing 
to 
employ 
them 
later 
on, 
after 
their 
stint 
in 
professional 
politics, 
as 
highly 
paid 
managers, 
consultants, 
or 
lobbyists, 
and 
so 
manage 
to 
decisively 
influence 
and 
determine 
the 
course 
of 
politics 
in 
their 
own 
favor. 
They, 
the 
plutocrats, 
will 
become 
the 
ultimate 
winners 
in 
the 
constant 
income 
and 
wealth 
redistribution 
struggle 
that 
is 
democracy. 
And 
in 
between 
them 
(the 
real 
power 
elite 
staying 
outside 
the 
limelight), 
and 
all 
those 
whose 
income 
(and 
wealth) 
depends 
solely 
or 
largely 
on 
the 
State 
and 
its 
taxing 
power 
(the 
employees 
of 
the 
always 
growing 
state 
apparatus 
and 
all 
recipients 
of 
transfer 
payments, 
its 
“welfare 
clients”), 
the 



productive 
middle 
class 
gets 
increasingly 
squeezed 
dry. 


Not 
least, 
democracy 
has 
also 
a 
profound 
effect 
on 
the 
conduct 
of 
war. 
I 
already 
explained 
that 
kings, 
because 
they 
can 
externalize 
the 
cost 
of 
their 
own 
aggression 
onto 
others 
(via 
taxes) 
tend 
to 
be 
more 
than 
‘normally’ 
aggressive 
and 
war-like. 
However, 
a 
king’s 
motive 
for 
war 
is 
typically 
an 
ownership-inheritance 
dispute 
brought 
on 
by 
a 
complex 
network 
of 
inter-
dynastic 
marriages 
and 
the 
irregular 
but 
always 
recurring 
extinction 
of 
certain 
dynasties. 
As 
violent 
inheritance 
disputes, 
monarchical 
wars 
are 
characterized 
by 
limited 
territorial 
objectives. 
They 
are 
not 
ideologically 
motivated 
quarrels 
but 
disputes 
over 
tangible 
properties. 
Moreover, 
as 
inter-dynastic 
property 
disputes, 
the 
public 
considers 
war 
essentially 
the 
king’s 
private 
affair 
to 
be 
paid 
for 
by 
himself 
and 
as 
insufficient 
reason 
for 
any 
further 
tax 
increase. 
Further, 
as 
private 
conflicts 
between 
different 
ruling 
families 
the 
public 
expects, 
and 
the 
kings 
feel 
compelled, 
to 
recognize 
a 
clear 
distinction 
between 
combatants 
and 
non-combatants 
and 
to 
target 
their 
war 
efforts 
specifically 
and 
exclusively 
against 
each 
other 
and 
their 
respective 
personal 
properties. 


Democracy 
radically 
transforms 
the 
limited 
wars 
of 
kings 
into 
total 
wars. 
In 
blurring 
the 
distinction 
between 
the 
rulers 
and 
the 
ruled, 
democracy 
strengthens 
the 
identification 
of 
the 
public 
with 
the 
State. 
Once 
the 
State 
is 
owned 
by 
all, 
as 
democrats 
deceivingly 
propagate, 
then 
it 
is 
only 
fair 
that 
everyone 
should 
fight 
for 
their 
State 
and 
all 
economic 
resources 
of 
the 
country 
be 
mobilized 
for 
the 
State 
in 
its 
wars. 
And 
since 
public 
officials 
in 
charge 
of 
a 
democratic 
state 
cannot 
and 
do 
not 
claim 
to 
personally 
“own” 
foreign 
territory 
(as 
a 
king 
can 
do), 
the 
motive 
for 
war 
instead 
becomes 
an 
ideological 
one—national 
glory, 
democracy, 
liberty, 
civilization, 
humanity. 
The 
objectives 
are 
intangible 
and 
elusive: 
the 
victory 
of 
ideas, 
and 
the 
unconditional 
surrender 
and 
ideological 
conversion 
of 
the 
losers 
(which, 
because 
one 
can 
never 
be 
sure 
about 
the 
sincerity 
of 
the 
conversion, 
may 
require 
the 
mass 
murder 
of 
civilians). 
As 
well, 
the 
distinction 
between 
combatants 
and 
non-combatants 
becomes 
fuzzy 
and 
ultimately 
disappears 
under 
democracy, 
and 
mass 
war 
involvement—the 
draft 
and 
popular 
war 
rallies—as 
well 
as 
“collateral 
damage” 
become 
part 
of 
war 
strategy. 


These 
tendencies 
will 
be 
still 
further 
strengthened 
by 
the 
rise 
of 
the 
new 
ruling 
elite 
of 
plutocrats. 
For 
one, 
the 
plutocrats 
will 
quickly 
realize 
the 
enormous 
profits 
to 
be 
made 
by 
arming 
the 
State, 
by 
producing 
the 
very 



weapons 
and 
equipment 
used 
in 
war, 
and 
in 
being 
awarded 
most 
generous 
tax-funded 
cost-plus 
contracts 
to 
do 
so. 
A 
military-industrial 
complex 
will 
be 
built 
up. 
And 
second, 
unlike 
most 
people 
who 
have 
merely 
local 
or 
domestic 
interests, 
the 
super-rich 
plutocrats 
have 
financial 
interests 
also 
in 
foreign 
places, 
potentially 
all 
around 
the 
globe, 
and 
in 
order 
to 
promote, 
protect, 
and 
enforce 
these 
foreign 
interests 
it 
is 
only 
natural 
for 
them 
to 
use 
the 
military 
power 
of 
their 
own 
State 
also 
to 
interfere, 
meddle, 
or 
intervene 
in 
foreign 
affairs 
on 
their 
behalf. 
A 
business 
deal 
in 
foreign 
countries 
may 
have 
turned 
sour 
or 
a 
concession 
or 
license 
may 
be 
won 
there—almost 
everything 
can 
be 
used 
as 
a 
reason 
to 
pressure 
one’s 
own 
State 
to 
come 
to 
their 
rescue 
and 
intervene 
outside 
of 
its 
own 
territory. 
Indeed, 
even 
if 
this 
intervention 
requires 
that 
a 
foreign 
country 
be 
destroyed, 
this 
can 
be 
a 
boon 
for 
them, 
provided 
only 
they 
receive 
the 
contract 
to 
rebuild 
the 
country 
that 
their 
weapons 
had 
before 
destroyed. 


Finally, 
the 
tendency 
already 
set 
in 
motion 
with 
the 
war 
of 
kings 
of 
leading 
to 
increased 
political 
centralization, 
toward 
the 
building 
of 
empire, 
is 
continued 
and 
accelerated 
through 
democratic 
war. 


Every 
State 
must 
begin 
territorially 
small. 
That 
makes 
it 
easy 
for 
productive 
people 
to 
run 
away 
to 
escape 
its 
taxation 
and 
legislation. 
Obviously, 
a 
State 
does 
not 
like 
to 
see 
its 
productive 
people 
run 
away 
and 
tries 
to 
capture 
them 
by 
expanding 
its 
territory. 
The 
more 
productive 
people 
the 
State 
controls, 
the 
better 
off 
it 
will 
be. 
In 
this 
expansionist 
desire, 
it 
runs 
into 
opposition 
by 
other 
States. 
There 
can 
be 
only 
one 
monopolist 
of 
ultimate 
decision-making 
in 
any 
given 
territory. 
That 
is, 
the 
competition 
between 
different 
States 
is 
eliminative. 
Either 
A 
wins 
and 
controls 
the 
territory, 
or 
B. 
Who 
wins? 
At 
least 
in 
the 
long 
run, 
that 
State 
will 
win—and 
take 
over 
another’s 
territory 
or 
establish 
hegemony 
over 
it 
and 
force 
it 
to 
pay 
tribute— 
that 
can 
parasitically 
draw 
on 
a 
comparatively 
more 
productive 
economy. 
That 
is, 
other 
things 
being 
the 
same, 
internally 
more 
“liberal” 
States, 
i.e., 
States 
with 
comparatively 
low 
taxes 
and 
little 
legislative 
regulation, 
will 
win 
over 
less 
“liberal,” 
i.e., 
more 
oppressive, 
States 
and 
expand 
their 
territory 
or 
their 
range 
of 
hegemonic 
control. 


There 
is 
only 
one 
important 
element 
missing 
still 
in 
this 
reconstruction 
of 
the 
tendency 
toward 
imperialism 
and 
political 
centralization: 
money. 


As 
a 
territorial 
monopolist 
of 
legislation, 
every 
State, 
whether 
monarchic 
or 
democratic, 
immediately 
recognized 
the 
immense 
potential 
for 



its 
own 
enrichment—far 
beyond 
anything 
offered 
by 
taxation—provided 
by 
the 
monopolistic 
control 
of 
money. 
By 
appointing 
itself 
as 
the 
sole 
producer 
of 
money, 
the 
State 
could 
increase 
and 
inflate 
the 
money 
supply 
through 
currency 
depreciation: 
by 
producing 
an 
increasingly 
cheaper 
and 
ultimately 
“worthless” 
money, 
such 
as 
paper 
money, 
that 
could 
be 
produced 
at 
virtually 
zero 
cost, 
and 
thus 
enabled 
the 
State 
to 
“buy” 
real, 
non-monetary 
goods 
at 
no 
cost 
to 
itself. 
But 
in 
an 
environment 
of 
multiple, 
competing 
states, 
paper 
monies 
and 
currency 
areas, 
limitations 
to 
this 
policy 
of 
“expropriation 
through 
inflation” 
come 
into 
play. 
If 
one 
State 
inflates 
more 
than 
another, 
its 
money 
tends 
to 
depreciate 
in 
the 
currency 
market 
relative 
to 
other 
monies, 
and 
people 
react 
to 
these 
changes 
in 
selling 
the 
more 
inflationary 
money 
and 
buying 
the 
less 
inflationary 
one. 
“Better” 
money 
would 
tend 
to 
outcompete 
“worse” 
money. 


This 
can 
be 
prevented 
only 
if 
the 
inflationary 
policies 
of 
all 
states 
are 
coordinated 
and 
an 
inflation 
cartel 
is 
established. 
But 
any 
such 
cartel 
would 
be 
unstable. 
Internal 
and 
external 
economic 
pressures 
would 
tend 
to 
burst 
it. 
For 
the 
cartel 
to 
be 
stable 
a 
dominant 
enforcer 
is 
required—which 
leads 
back 
to 
the 
subject 
of 
imperialism 
and 
empire 
building. 
Because 
a 
militarily 
dominant 
State, 
a 
hegemon, 
can 
and 
will 
use 
its 
position 
to 
institute 
and 
enforce 
a 
policy 
of 
coordinated 
inflation 
and 
of 
monetary 
imperialism. 
It 
will 
order 
its 
vassal 
States 
to 
inflate 
along 
with 
its 
own 
inflation. 
It 
will 
further 
pressure 
them 
to 
accept 
its 
own 
currency 
as 
their 
reserve 
currency, 
and 
ultimately, 
to 
replace 
all 
other, 
competing 
currencies 
by 
a 
single 
paper 
money, 
used 
worldwide 
and 
controlled 
by 
itself, 
so 
as 
to 
expand 
its 
exploitative 
power 
over 
other 
territories 
and 
ultimately 
the 
entire 
globe 
even 
without 
further 
war 
and 
conquest. 


But—and 
with 
that 
I 
am 
slowly 
approaching 
the 
end 
of 
my 
tale 
of 
moral 
and 
economic 
folly 
and 
decay 
and 
have 
already 
touched 
upon 
a 
possible 
way 
out—imperialism 
and 
empire 
building 
also 
bears 
the 
seeds 
of 
its 
own 
destruction. 
The 
closer 
a 
State 
comes 
to 
the 
ultimate 
goal 
of 
world 
domination 
and 
one-world 
government 
and 
paper 
money, 
the 
less 
reason 
there 
is 
to 
maintain 
its 
internal 
liberalism 
and 
do 
instead 
what 
all 
States 
are 
inclined 
to 
do 
anyway, 
i.e., 
to 
crack 
down 
and 
increase 
their 
exploitation 
of 
whatever 
productive 
people 
are 
still 
left. 
Consequently, 
with 
no 
additional 
tributaries 
left 
and 
domestic 
productivity 
stagnating 
or 
falling, 
the 
empire’s 
internal 
policies 
of 
bread 
and 
circuses 
and 
its 
foreign 
policies 
of 
war 
and 



domination 
can 
no 
longer 
be 
maintained. 
Economic 
crisis 
hits, 
and 
an 
impending 
economic 
meltdown 
will 
stimulate 
decentralizing 
tendencies, 
separatist 
and 
secessionist 
movements, 
and 
lead 
to 
the 
breakup 
of 
empire. 


What, 
then, 
is 
the 
moral 
of 
my 
story? 
I 
have 
tried 
to 
make 
the 
current 
world 
intelligible, 
to 
reconstruct 
it 
as 
the 
predictable 
result 
of 
a 
series 
of 
successive 
and 
cumulative 
moral 
and 
economic 
errors. 


We 
all 
know 
the 
results. 
The 
price 
of 
justice 
has 
risen 
astronomically. 
The 
tax 
load 
imposed 
on 
property 
owners 
and 
producers 
makes 
the 
burden 
imposed 
on 
slaves 
and 
serfs 
appear 
moderate 
in 
comparison. 
As 
well, 
government 
debt 
has 
risen 
to 
breathtaking 
heights. 
Everywhere, 
democratic 
states 
are 
on 
the 
verge 
of 
bankruptcy. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
quality 
of 
law 
has 
steadily 
deteriorated 
to 
the 
point 
where 
the 
idea 
of 
law 
as 
a 
body 
of 
universal 
and 
immutable 
principles 
of 
justice 
has 
disappeared 
from 
public 
opinion 
and 
consciousness 
and 
been 
replaced 
by 
the 
idea 
of 
law 
as 
legislation. 
Every 
detail 
of 
private 
life, 
property, 
trade, 
and 
contract 
is 
regulated 
by 
increasingly 
higher 
mountains 
of 
paper 
laws. 
In 
the 
name 
of 
social, 
public, 
or 
national 
security, 
democratic 
caretakers 
“protect” 
us 
from 
global 
warming 
and 
cooling, 
the 
extinction 
of 
animals 
and 
plants 
and 
the 
depletion 
of 
natural 
resources, 
from 
husbands 
and 
wives, 
parents 
and 
employers, 
poverty, 
disease, 
disaster, 
ignorance, 
prejudice, 
racism, 
sexism, 
homophobia 
and 
countless 
other 
public 
“enemies” 
and 
“dangers.” 
Yet 
the 
only 
task 
government 
was 
ever 
supposed 
to 
assume—of 
protecting 
our 
life 
and 
property—it 
does 
not 
perform. 
To 
the 
contrary, 
the 
higher 
the 
state 
expenditures 
on 
social, 
public, 
and 
national 
security 
have 
risen, 
the 
more 
private 
property 
rights 
have 
been 
eroded, 
the 
more 
property 
has 
been 
expropriated, 
confiscated, 
destroyed, 
and 
depreciated, 
and 
the 
more 
have 
people 
been 
deprived 
of 
the 
very 
foundation 
of 
all 
protection: 
of 
personal 
independence, 
economic 
strength, 
and 
private 
wealth. 
The 
more 
paper 
laws 
have 
been 
produced, 
the 
more 
legal 
uncertainty 
and 
moral 
hazard 
has 
been 
created, 
and 
lawlessness 
has 
displaced 
law 
and 
order. 
And 
while 
we 
have 
become 
ever 
more 
dependent, 
helpless, 
impoverished, 
threatened 
and 
insecure, 
the 
ruling 
elite 
of 
politicians 
and 
plutocrats 
has 
become 
increasingly 
richer, 
more 
corrupt, 
dangerously 
armed, 
and 
arrogant. 


Likewise, 
we 
know 
about 
the 
international 
scene. 
The 
once-upon-a-time 
comparatively 
liberal 
USA, 
through 
a 
seemingly 
endless 
series 
of 
wars— 



wars 
supposed 
to 
make 
the 
world 
safe 
for 
democracy 
but 
in 
reality 
wars 
for 
US 
and 
its 
plutocrats’ 
world-domination—has 
risen 
to 
the 
rank 
of 
the 
world’s 
foremost 
empire 
and 
global 
hegemon, 
meddling 
in 
the 
domestic 
affairs 
and 
superimposing 
its 
rule 
on 
countless 
other 
countries 
and 
their 
local 
power 
elites 
and 
populations. 
Moreover, 
as 
the 
world’s 
dominant 
empire, 
the 
US 
has 
also 
established 
its 
currency, 
the 
US-dollar 
as 
the 
leading 
international 
reserve 
currency. 
And 
with 
the 
dollar 
used 
as 
reserve 
currency 
by 
foreign 
central 
(government) 
banks, 
the 
US 
can 
run 
a 
permanent 
“deficit 
without 
tears.” 
That 
is, 
the 
US 
must 
not 
pay 
for 
its 
steady 
excesses 
of 
imports 
over 
exports, 
as 
it 
is 
normal 
between 
“equal” 
partners, 
in 
having 
to 
ship 
increasingly 
more 
exports 
abroad 
(exports 
paying 
for 
imports!). 
Rather: 
Instead 
of 
using 
their 
export 
earnings 
to 
buy 
American 
goods 
for 
domestic 
consumption, 
foreign 
governments 
and 
their 
central 
banks, 
as 
a 
sign 
of 
their 
vassal 
status 
vis-à-vis 
a 
dominant 
US, 
use 
their 
paper 
dollar 
reserves 
to 
buy 
up 
US 
government 
bonds 
to 
help 
Americans 
consume 
beyond 
their 
means 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
foreign 
populations. 


What 
I 
have 
tried 
to 
show 
here 
is 
why 
all 
of 
this 
is 
not 
a 
historical 
accident, 
but 
something 
that 
was 
predictable. 
Not 
in 
all 
details, 
of 
course, 
but 
as 
far 
as 
the 
general 
pattern 
of 
development 
is 
concerned. 
That 
the 
ultimate 
error 
committed, 
leading 
to 
these 
deplorable 
results, 
was 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
territorial 
monopoly 
of 
ultimate 
decision 
making, 
i.e., 
a 
State, 
and 
hence, 
that 
the 
entire 
history 
we 
are 
told 
and 
taught 
in 
schools 
and 
standard 
textbooks, 
which 
presents 
democracy 
as 
the 
crowning 
achievement 
of 
human 
civilization, 
is 
just 
about 
the 
opposite 
of 
the 
truth. 


The 
final 
question, 
then, 
is 
“Can 
we 
rectify 
this 
error 
and 
go 
back 
to 
a 
natural 
aristocratic 
social 
order?” 
I 
have 
written 
and 
spoken 
about 
the 
ultimate 
solution: 
how 
a 
modern 
natural 
order—a 
private 
law 
society—could 
and 
would 
work, 
and 
I 
can 
only 
summarily 
refer 
you 
here 
to 
these 
works.[3] 
Instead, 
I 
only 
want 
to 
briefly 
touch 
here, 
at 
the 
very 
end, 
on 
matters 
of 
political 
strategy: 
how 
to 
possibly 
approach 
the 
ultimate 
solution 
that 
I 
and 
others 
such 
as 
my 
great 
teacher 
Murray 
Rothbard 
have 
proposed 
and 
outlined 
—given 
the 
current 
state 
of 
affairs. 


As 
indicated, 
the 
democratic 
system 
is 
on 
the 
verge 
of 
economic 
collapse 
and 
bankruptcy 
as 
in 
particular 
the 
developments 
since 
2007, 
with 
the 
great 
and 
still 
ongoing 
financial 
and 
economic 
crisis, 
have 
revealed. 
The 
EU 
and 
the 
Euro 
are 
in 
fundamental 
trouble, 
and 
so 
are 
the 
US 
and 
the 
US 



dollar. 
Indeed, 
there 
are 
ominous 
signs 
that 
the 
dollar 
is 
gradually 
losing 
its 
status 
as 
dominant 
international 
reserve 
currency. 
In 
this 
situation, 
not 
quite 
unlike 
the 
situation 
after 
the 
collapse 
of 
the 
former 
Soviet 
Empire, 
countless 
decentralizing, 
separatist 
and 
secessionist 
movements 
and 
tendencies 
have 
gained 
momentum, 
and 
I 
would 
advocate 
that 
as 
much 
ideological 
support 
as 
possible 
be 
given 
to 
these 
movements. 


For 
even 
if 
as 
a 
result 
of 
such 
decentralist 
tendencies 
new 
State 
governments 
should 
spring 
up, 
whether 
democratic 
or 
otherwise, 
territorially 
smaller 
States 
and 
increased 
political 
competition 
will 
tend 
to 
encourage 
moderation 
as 
regards 
a 
State’s 
exploitation 
of 
productive 
people. 
Just 
look 
at 
Liechtenstein, 
Monaco, 
Singapore, 
Hong 
Kong, 
and 
even 
Switzerland, 
with 
its 
still 
comparatively 
powerful 
small 
cantons 
vis-à-vis 
its 
central 
government. 
Ideally, 
the 
decentralization 
should 
proceed 
all 
the 
way 
down 
to 
the 
level 
of 
individual 
communities, 
to 
free 
cities 
and 
villages 
as 
they 
once 
existed 
all 
over 
Europe. 
Just 
think 
of 
the 
cities 
of 
the 
Hanseatic 
League, 
for 
instance. 
In 
any 
case, 
even 
if 
new 
little 
States 
will 
emerge 
there, 
only 
in 
small 
regions, 
districts, 
and 
communities 
will 
the 
stupidity, 
arrogance, 
and 
corruption 
of 
politicians 
and 
local 
plutocrats 
become 
almost 
immediately 
visible 
to 
the 
public 
and 
can 
possibly 
be 
quickly 
corrected 
and 
rectified. 
And 
only 
in 
very 
small 
political 
units 
will 
it 
also 
be 
possible 
for 
members 
of 
the 
natural 
elite, 
or 
whatever 
is 
left 
of 
such 
an 
elite, 
to 
regain 
the 
status 
of 
voluntarily 
acknowledged 
conflict 
arbitrators 
and 
judges 
of 
the 
peace. 


[1] 
Theoretically, 
all 
conflicts 
regarding 
the 
use 
of 
any 
good 
can 
be 
avoided, 
if 
only 
every 
good 
is 
always 
and 
continuously 
privately 
owned, 
i.e., 
exclusively 
controlled, 
by 
some 
specified 
individual(s) 
and 
it 
is 
always 
clear 
which 
thing 
is 
owned, 
and 
by 
whom, 
and 
which 
is 
not. 
The 
interests 
and 
ideas 
of 
different 
individuals 
may 
then 
be 
as 
different 
as 
can 
be, 
and 
yet 
no 
conflict 
arises, 
insofar 
as 
their 
interests 
and 
ideas 
are 
concerned 
always 
and 
exclusively 
with 
their 
own, 
separate 
property. 
Conflicts, 
then, 
are 
always 
conflicts 
regarding 
the 
answer 
to 
the 
question 
as 
to 
who 
is 
or 
is 
not 
the 
private 
(exclusive) 
owner 
of 
any 
given 
good 
at 
any 
given 
time. 
And 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
all 
conflicts 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
mankind 
on, 
it 
must 
be 
further 
always 
clear 
how 
private 
property 
is 
originally 
established 
(and 
here 
the 
obvious 
answer 
is: 
by 
original 
and 
thus 
undisputed 
appropriation 
of 

previously 
un-owned 
resources) 
and 
how 
property 
then 
can 
or 
cannot 
be 
transferred 
from 
one 
person 
to 
another 
(obviously: 
by 
mutual 
consent 
and 
trading 
rather 
than 
unilateral 
robbery). 


[2] 
It 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
the 
logical 
requirements 
for 
permanent 
peace, 
for 
the 
potential 
avoidance 
of 
all 
conflicts, 
are 
met 
precisely 
with 
this 
solution. 
It 
is 
always 
clear 
who 
provisionally 
owns 
what 
and 
what 
to 
do 
if 
rival 
claims 
regarding 
scarce 
resources 
exist.
